NASA asked\nthat the study also consider how these applications would influence or be\ninfluenced by the Space Shuttle System, the principal space transportation\nsystem of the 1980\'s. In December 1973, the Academy agreed to perform the\nstudy and assigned the task to the Space Applications Board (SAB).\nIn the summers of 1967 and 1968, the National Academy of Sciences had\nconvened a group of eminent scientists and engineers to determine what research\nand development was necessary to permit the exploitation of useful applications\nof earth-oriented satellites. The SAB concluded that since the NAS study,\noperational weather and communications satellites and the successful first\nyear of use of the experimental Earth Resources Technology Satellite had demonstrated conclusively a technological capability that could form a foundation\nfor expanding the useful applications of space-derived information and services,\nand that it was now necessary to obtain, from a broad cross-section of potential\nusers, new idCas and needs that might guide the development of future space\nsystems for practical applications.\nAfter discussions with NASA and other interested federal agencies, it\nwas agreed that a major aim of the "summer study" should be to involve, and\nto attempt to understand the needs of, resource managers and other decisionmakers who had as yet only considered space systems as experimental rather\nthan as useful elements of major day-to-day operational information and service\nsystems. Under the general direction of the SAB, then, a representative group\nof users and potential users conducted an intensive two-week study to define\nuser needs that might be met by information or services derived from earthorbiting satellites. This work was done in July 1974 at Snowmass, Colorado.\nFor the study, nine user-oriented panels were formed, comprised of present\nor potential public and private users, including businessmen, state and local\ngovernment officials, resource managers, and other decision-makers. A number\n\n*Effective July 1, 1974, the National Academy of Sciences and the National\nAcademy of Engineering reorganized the National Research Council into eight\nassemblies and commissions. All National Academy of Engineering program units,\nincluding the SAB, became the Assembly of Engineering.\niii\n\nof scientists and technologists also participated, functioning essentially\nas expert consultants. The assignment made to the panels included reviewing\nprogress in space applications since the NAS study of 1968* and defining user\nneeds potentially capable of being met by space-system applications.

A substantial amount of interaction with the user panels\nwas designed into the study plan and was found to be both desirable and necessary.\nThe major part of the study was accomplished by the paneis. The function\nof the SAB was to review the work of the panels, to evaluate their findings,\nand to derive from their work an integrated set of major conclusions and recommendations. The Board\'s findings, which include certain significant recommendations from the panel reports, as well as more general ones arrived at by\nconsidering the work of the study as a whole, are contained in a report prepared by the Board.**\nIt should be emphasized that the study was not designed to make detailed\nassessments of all of the factors which should be considered in establishing\npriorities.

The\noceans dominate the earth\'s weather systems and are the source of vast quantities of food and other material resources. Moreover, ocean commerce is of\ncr , ;Yial importance to man\'s capacity to maintain or enhance the way of life he\nnow enjoys. U.S. maritime commerce, as well as world commerce, doubles every\nten years \xe2\x80\x94 a striking indication of the increasing necessity for nations to\nsuppleme : -t their natural resources and manufactured products with those from\nother areas of the world.\nWithin its broad subject, the Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses perceives\nthe scope of its concern to embrace activities related to: (1) better understanding, control, and use of the ocean\'s biological and physical processes for food\nand energy production and ship design purposes; and (2) providing navigation,\ncommunication and data transmission technological aid; which improve efficiency\nand enhance safety in maritime operations. These areas of concern are recognized\nin the NASA Earth Observations Program, Earth and Ocean Physics Applications\nProgram, and are reflected in NASA\'s goals and objectives with respect to communication and position determination. The Panel has examined the general areas\nwithin its scope of study and concludes that three broad areas should receive\nmajor consideration: (1) monitoring of marine environment, (2) position determination, and (3) communication. Monitoring covers physical and biological\nprocesses within marine environment as well as shipping, fishing, and related\nmaritime activities. Communication is viewed as a vital function in itself and\nalso as an aid to monitoring, position determination, and navigation.\n\n1\n\nFOLLOWUP AND EVALUATION OF 1967-68 STUDY\n\nAPPLICATIONS TO DATE AND PROJECTED FOR NEAR FUTURE\nThe Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses finds that its scope includes certain\nphases considered previously by the Panel on Oceanography, the Panel on Pointsto-Point Communication, and the Panel on Navigation and Traffic Control of the\n1967-68 study*.\nTo a remarkable extent the observations and recommendations made by the\nPanel on Oceanography in the 1967-68 study remain valid today. It noted the need\nfor measurements of wind, waves, currents, tides, and biological activity over\nthe world\'s oceans, the usefulness of monitoring pollutants, sedimentation, shore\nerosion, storm surges, and wave diffraction in the coastal zone, and the benefits\nexpected to accrue from these observations. The Panel on Points-to-Point\nCommunication foresaw the need to collect small amounts of data from many buoys,\nships, ar:d fixed platforms.\nMuch work has p een done since 1968 to develop new and improved instruments\nto make these measurements. For example, radar altimeters have continued to\nimprove in accuracy until they now measure short-wavelength undulations of the\ngeoid to an accuracy of 30 centimeters. By the end of the present decade,\n10 centimeter measurements will be possible, and this accuracy is needed. Distortion of the altimeter\'s pulse provides information on average wave height.\nThis information will become more accurate as the altimeters improve. Sea surface\ntemperature is routinely measured to + 1.5\xc2\xb0 C over cloud-free areas of the ocean.\nPassive multifrequency microwave radiometers are now being flown and it is hoped\nthat they will provide measurements of sea temperature in cloudy areas with an\naccuracy of about 2 0 to 4\xc2\xb0C, surface windspeed, and atmospheric water vapor content. Multispectral sensors have been operated in space and have permitted\ndetermination of features that are needed by coastal planners, such as surface\nwaves, internal waves, pollution, sediment, coastlines, and depth of shallow\nwater. Operational systems that interrogate drifting and fixed data stations,\nplatforms, and ships will soon be available.

Imaging microwave radars record individual ocean waves and may\nprovide wave directional spectra, although comparisons with a measured spectrum\nare yet to be made. Microwave scatterometers are expected to measure ocean\nsurface winds, but the fundamental interpretation of the data has been a continuing source of controversey. Three ocean-color imaging spectrometers (two for\naircraft, one for satellites) have been developed by NASA but have not yet been\nused in an extended experimental program. In summary, it appears that within\nthis decade refinements of these instruments will meet the user needs that they\naddress.\nOf three research and development recommendations in the 1967-68 study\nreport by the Panel on Navigation and Traffic Control,* one that is relevant to\nthe work of the Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses involves radio propagation.\nSince 1967 there have been a number of experiments and test programs performed\nu .ng the NASA Applications Technology Satellites -- ATS-1, ATS-3, and ATS-S.\nIn:.;-ially, the experiments consisted of sending messages by teleprinter and\nvon ce at VHF radio frequencies via ATS-1. Signal quality, error rate, antenna\ngain and power output were measured and compared. Some line-of-position navigation experiments were conducted. r.s ATS-3 and ATS-5 became available, they\nals) were used in tests. Ships provided by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the\nmtr^:hant ship Santa Lucia participated in these test programs. The experiments\nwith the Santa Lucia represented the first involvement of the U.S. Maritime\nAdministration (MARAD) in the use of satellites to improve ship management and\noperation. An early study of maritime satellite systems was sponsored jointly\nby the Office of Telecommunications Policy, MARAD, the Department of\nTransportation (DoT) and the USCG. This study, completed in late 1970, became\nthe foundation for the United States positions on maritime satellite frequency\nallocation at the International Telecommunication Union\'s World Administrative\nRadio Conference for Space in 1971.\nStrong needs expressed by the U.S. and other maritime nations led the\nConference to allocate frequencies exclusively for a maritime satellite service\nin the radio frequency band between 1535 and 1660 MHz (L-band). An additional\n2 MHz was allocated for joint use of the maritime and aeronautical communities\nfor such applications as search and rescue. These frequency allocations are\nmuch greater than the total radio frequency spectrum otherwise available to the\nmaritime community.\nLack of a spacecraft with an adequate L-band capability delayed early experimentation with satellite maritime communication and navigation systems. ATS-S\nwas equipped with an L-band transponder, but failed to achieve stabilization\nof its antenna system. It was possible nevertheless to operate an at-sea\ndemonstration using ATS-5 in 1970. Under MARAD sponsorship, teleprinter messages\nwere exchanged between company offices and the merchant ship ESSO Baltimore\nusing the L-band capability of ATS-5.\nFollowing this limited demonstration, MARAD decided to initiate a multipleship experiment in communications and navigation. Nine U.S. merchant ships were\nselected to participate. Because an integrated navigation-communications\napproach was desired, two satellites, ATS-3 and ATS-5, were used. The C-band\n\n*Report of the Panel on Navigation and Traffic ControZ, 1969, n. 84.\n4\n\n(4 to 6 GHz) frequencies available on these spacecraft provided data and position\ndetermination capability in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In additicn,\na Maritime Coordination Center was established at the MARAD National Maritime\nResearch Center, King\'s Point, N.Y., to provide interfaces with shipping companies and participating agencies. Services demonstrated to shipping companies\nincluded shipping management, data ; p rocessing, and other services.\nAt-sea experiments using about 800 hours of satellite time were carried out\nfrom February to August, 1973. Digital data for communications and position\ndetermination were provided. Valuable experience was gained by the participating\ncompanies in developing both ship equipment and new ship management concepts.\nIn 1972 a communications experiment was conducted for a two-month period\ninvolving the Queen Elizabeth II, the Communications Satellite Corporation\n(COMSAT), and a satellite belonging to the International Telecommunications\nSate\'.lite Consortium (INTELSAT). The ship operated in passenger cruise service\nin tae Caribbean, across the North Atlantic, and in the Mediterranean. Voice,\nteletype, and facsimile information were transmitted successfully.\nDuring a four-month period in 1973 an experimental program by COMSAT with\nthe medical ship Hope, located in Brazil, was conducted through an INTELSAT\nsatellite. In addition to using voice, teletype, and facsimile,medical personnel\non board the Hope used slow-scan television for consulting, in real-time, with\nmedical professionals in the United States. This new capability was enthusiastically endorsed by the Hope\'s medical personnel.\nThe experience gained from the aforementioned C-band tests has been used\nto plan ATS-6 experiments for 1974-75. Although maritime experiments were not\ninitially included in NASA plans for the ATS-6, they have now become an important\npart of the program. Under MARAD sponsorship, two U.S. merchant vessels will be\nfitted with L-band ship terminals representative of what might be used in early\noperational systems. Experiments will include reception and transmission of\nvoice, data, facsimile, remotely sensed data, and experiments with position\ndetermination techniques. MARAD\'s Maritime Coordination Center will be upgraded\nand again will suppoi, the experimental effort. Experiments are also planned\nin which the USCG and a European Space Research Organization (ESRO) ship will\nuse ATS-6 for various communication modes and for position determination. In\naddition, an L-band emergency buoy for distress alerting and location will be\nevaluated.\nInterest shown in maritime satellite communications both in the U.S. and\nin other countries has encoura g ed COMSAT General Corporation (a subsidiary of\nthe Communications Satellite Corporation), Radio Corporation of American (RCA),\nWestern Union International (WUI) and International Telephone and Telegraph\n(ITT), to announce the implementation in mid-1975 of commercial satellite maritime communication services in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean areas using a\nsatellite system called MARISAT. Although the amount and type of service for\nthe early years of the system must be limited because of restrictions arising\nfrom concurrent government use of the satellites, it appears that MARISAT will\nprovide a service adequate to meet the communication needs of shipping companies.\nExperience in using it will permit the development of procedures and techniques\nfor future follow-on systems.\nSeveral series of experiments using a variation of side-tone ranging\ndeveloped by the General Electric Company (GE) have been conducted from 1968\nto the present. The technique used is called "tone-code ranging." It has been\n5\n\nused primarily with voice-equivalent channels on ATS-1 and ATS-3 at VHF (130 to\n150 MHz), and is a means of measuring the di, -nce from the satellite to the ship\nusing a voice channel at the same time that the channel is being used to transmit\ninformation by voice.\nAt-sea tests using U.S. merchant ships, buoys, and USCG ships have provided\nconsiderable data from which it can be concluded that accurate positions of ships\nand other marine vehicles can be obtained from concurrent ranging through two\nappropriately located geosynchronous satellites. Employing two satellites offers\nthe possibility of lower cost shipboard terminals for position determination.\nIn 1973 these techniques were further tested for NASA by GE using ATS-5 at\nL-band frequencies, using ground-based terminals. Results obtained were similar\nto those obtained at VHF; that is, they indicate that it is technically feasible\nto obtain position accuracy of approximately 0.1 nautical mile with tone-code\nranging from geosynchronous satellites.\nTests run concurrently by MARAD in 1973 with a pseudo-random code indicate\nthat position-fixing with this technique is also technically feasible. NASA has\nccnducted other experiments using side-tone ranging, and this technique also can\nprovide the desired results. Trade-off of power, equipment costs, processing\nrequired, and necessary radio bandwidth is essential to determine the optimum\nsystem for any particular set of circumstances. MARAD is currently completing\na study that looks at some of these aspects. The ATS-6 L-band experiments to\nbe conducted during June 1974 to May 1975 will continue to acouire data on\nposition determination through two satellite ranging techniques. Ships of the\nUSCG and ESRO will use side-tone ranging techniques developed by NASA in a system\ncalled the Position Location and Communication Experiment (PLACE). MARAD will\nuse the pseu(\'o-random code system used in 1973 on two U.S. merchant ships. Data\non both accuracy and radio-propagation anomaly will be obtained. Experiments\nin monitoring ship traffic using ship positions established with the help of\nspace systems are an element of the MARAD tests. Experiments will also be done\nin use of accurate ship locations to improve ship utilization and to improve\nship routing. The USCG will conduct a search and rescue demonstration and evaluate the impact of satellites on merchant vessel safety. In the search and rescue\ndemonstration, ATS-6 will be used with aircraft of the Federal Aviation\nAdministration and ESRO and an L-band buoy provided by ESRO. The limited time\nfor maritime experiments on ATS-6, however, will restrict these experiments to\nshort demonstration periods.\nThe 1967-68 study report of the Panel on Navigation and Traffic Control discusses "Operational and Management Communications" but in a rather limited way,\nsince the subject was outside the Panel\'s assigned tasks. However, major interest and need have developed for reliable communication services that can be used\n24 hours a day to improve the management and operation of ships and other marine\nactivities. Major efforts have been expended in the past six years to conduct\nexperiments, generate interest on the part of the commercial shipping industry,\nand stimulate the venture capital needed to launch a private commercial service.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS NOT FULLY IMPLEMLNTED OR NO LONGER VALID\nResponse to the recommendations of the Panel on Oceanography has not been\nentirely satisfactory. The Statement from the 1967-68 study report that\n\n6\n\n"satellite technology has not as yet had significant impact on oceanography"*\nis still true. This does not imply that progress is e ntirely lacking. Much has\nbeen done to develop new instruments and to improve existing ones, but this work\nhas not progressed to an operatior_al system. Aircraft were used full time to\ndevelop these instruments, but at present, no buoy or ship program is specifically\noperated to provide the sea truth data needed to calibrate spacecraft instruments\nand to aid in interpretation of signals from these instruments. All too often\nforecasted winds, nonreal-time wave measurements, and a few laser profiles of\nwaves, rather than comprehensive data from in situ instruments, have been used\nfor calibration of the space sensors. The help and advice of fishery biologists\nin the development of new systems have been lacking and a recommended vigorous\nprogram to assess and develop a chlorophyll spectroscopy system suitable for\nsatellite use has produced only a weak effort.\nRecommendations that are no longer valid are concerned \xe2\x96\xbane-inly with refinement of user needs; for example, conventional photography fror space (replaced\nby scanners operating in the visual .avelengths) and laser altimeters (replaced\nb; radar) ire no longer needed. The requirement for ground resolution has increased from 10 to 1 km for many oceanic measurements (for example, to detect\n\xc2\xad\nsm, : and intense oceanic features of importance to fisheries and to see through\nhr,eF to clouds) and to 100 m for small-scale phenomena such as coastal features,\n,nd pollutants. The accuracy needed in chlorophyll measurements is now\nis\t\nconsidered to be within a factor of 2 between 0.1 and 20 mg/m 3 and the emphasis\nhas shifted from the chlorophyll response at 0.67,um to the blue portion of the\nspectrum. Temporal coverage of coastal dynamics needs to be tailored to the\ntime scale of the local situation, including tidal effects. Observations on\nthe order of every half hour over regions of 100 to 200 km with resolutions of\n100 m or better are required. These data can come from observation with instruments of }igh spectral resolution in the visible part of the spectrum.\nThe 1969 report of the Panel on Navigation and Traffic Control includes a\nrecommendation for R&D on improved angle-measurement techniques. Little addi!:ional work has been done and current research has emphasized ranging techniques.\nIn ad4ition, the report recommends that a national policy statement and plan\nfor navigatiu., be established, and that international negotiation and arrangements necessary to implement the plan be initiated.\nThe report concludes that a satellite navigation aad traffic control system\nwili result in such benefits as (1) reduction in ship collisions and strandi.ngs,\n(2) savings in operating costs of shipping lines, (3) increased efficiency in\ncommercial shippi.;3, and (4) faster search and rescue at sea. These conclusions\nare considered to remain valid, but at this time (1974), an economical method\nof meeting these goals has not been achieved. Questions of who will provide\nthe system and how it will be funded remain unsettled. The user community has\nyet to take a strong position on it3 needs and probably will not until there\nis a clear understanding about future charges to users. in the meantime, the\nfederal government is continuing to fund and expand various position\ndetermination systems such as LORAN, OMEGA, "RANSIT, and a Department of Defense\n(DOD) satellite-based system proposed for the 1980 1 s, referred to as the\n\n"Report of the Panel on Oceanography, (1969), p. 83.\n7\n\nGlobal Positioning System. Although TRANSIT (properly referred to as the Navy\nNavigation Satellite System) has been made available to civilian users, it has\nnot been taken into consideration to any significent extent in the overall planning of navigation systems. It is reasonable to assume that the proposed Global\nPositioning System will permit position determination to a precision exceeding\nthe requirements of the maritime community, but it is not clear whether the civil\ncommunity will be permitted to use the s y stem, and if so, what precision will be\nprovided for civil users. No res p onse has been made to the users\' need for\ninternational agreement on a uniform system of radio navigation aids. Bilateral\nagreements have, however, been signed between the U.S. and six foreign countries\nfor implementation of a worldwide OMEGA system.\nIn addition to specific recommendations, the 1967-68 study proposed that a\ndevelopmental system be designed and tested for confluence-area and enroute\nnavigation for ships. Such a system is especially needed in outer confluence\nareas not served by land-based radar. There has been little or no evidence of\ninterest since the 1968 study in the use of land-based radar, except for some\nharbors where it has been adopted for vessel traffic monitoring systems. Studies\nof traffic systems for confluence areas have been made by the USCG; however, the\ntechniques studied have not included satellite-based systems. A study by MARAD\nin 1973 examined traffic advisory systems and provided some preliminary costbenefit data.\nMARAD has made limited studies relating to integrated navigation and communication systems, including cost-benefits of such systems. The experimental\ndemonstration of an integrated system, referred to earlier (pp. 4-5) in this\nreport,did not reach final conclusions nor fully validate projected benefits of\nan integrated system. A more recent experiment, from July 1973 to February 1974,\nby the EXXON Corporation and the General Electric Company provided additional\nexperience, from which it was concluded that both position determination and\nimproved communications could bring significant benefits.*\n\n*LaRosa, R.

Much overlap exists since throughout the whole marine community,\neach function is an end in itself and at the same time is interrelated with and\ncontributes to the other functions.\n\nMONITORING\nMonitoring requirements for a large portion of the marine community have\nbeen well expressed by NOAA* and the USCG .** Further, within the NASA Earth and\nOcean Physics Applications Program, a User Working Group has defined data needs\non physical oceanographic processes, as an imput to planning of a satellite\ncalled SEASAT. Current needs in monitoring are briefly summarized and include:\nImproved data on and forecasts of physical and biological processes within the marine environment, including winds, wave spectra,\ncurrents, ice, temperature, salinity, biological activity and\nproductivity, and coastal dynamics such as near - shore currents,\nsediment transport, erosion, shoaling, and wave diffraction.\nImproved monitoring of maritime activities, including merchange\nvessel operations, drilling and mining, and offshore dumping.\nDetection pollution from oil, sewage, sludge, industrial waste,\nand thermal outflows will be of particular interest in maintaining\nthe quality and productivity of coastal waters.\n\n*Apel, John R. and Sherman, John W., III.

Westinghouse Electric Company, November 1974.\n1\n9\n\nThe ability to monitor precisely the location of offshore\nstructures and anchored and free-floating buoys, to support\nfuture commercial and scientific programs.\nIn general, areas requiring environmental monitoring may be broadly grouped\ninto three geographic regions: estuarine and coastal, including the Great Lakes;\nopen ocean areas with major current systems; and open oceans. The polar regions\ncan be regarded as a fourth general area, but the requirements are quite similar\nto those for the coastal regions. Of the ocean regions, the U.S, territorial\nwaters and proposed coastal economic zone are the most important to the U.S.\n\nPOSITION DETERMINATION\nThere exist a number of ground-based position determination systems, including LORAN-A (being replaced by LORAN-C), DECCA, and OMEGA. None of the groundbased systems provides global coverage. The Navy satellite navigation system\n(TRANSIT), available for civil use, provides global coverage but its accuracy is\nlimited to about one-half mile and the procedure for using it is complicated and\nrequires costly shipboard equipment.\nThe present proliferation of terrestrial position determination. systems\nresults in a dissipation of public and private funds, necessitates carrying\naboard ships and aircraft different devices for navigating in various parts of\nthe world, and wastes valuable segments of the already over-crowded electromagnetic frequency spectrum. The substantial growth in air traffic and increases\nin ship size and speed during the 1960\'s and the 1970\'s have been accommodated\nby a complex of navigational aids, with little coordination on a national or an\ninternational scale among the various types of user (air and marine, military\nand civil). The last international meeting on marine aids to navigation was\nheld in 1947. The Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses foresees a need to replace\nexisting regional systems with a unified and continuously available position\ndetermination system of sufficient accuracy (200 m) for maritime navigatiun in\nthe high seas and in confluence regions. As a goal, such a system should be\ncomparable with or less costly to operate than the present aggregate of systems\nand the associated mobile receiving equipment must be economical for the user to\nlease or own. Such a position determination system proviaing coverage between\nabout 75 0 N or 75\xc2\xb0 S latitude can also be of benefit for ship movement advisory\nservices, for maritime traffic control, and for users other than in maritime\nshipping.\nThe Panel sees a further need for this unified global position determination\nsystem to become integrated with a communications system of comparable scope.\nSeveral methods of achieving such integration are being experimentally evaluated.\nPreliminary analyses indicate, at least from the viewpoint of the user, an integrated communications and navigation system can best provide the services that\nwill permit optimum ship ma p agement. Whether it will be more cost-effective to\nprovide position determination and communication in one satellite or in a combination of satellites needs further study.\nThe DOT, considering the views of the Radio Technical Commission for\nAeronautics (RTCA), the Radio Technical Commission for Marine Services (RTCM),\n\n10\n\nand various other transportation users, has issued a National Plan for\nNavigation.* An accompanying letter of promulgation states that the Plan is the\nofficial source of navigation policy and plans for the Department. The purpose\nof the Plan is to provide for the orderly and efficient development, implementation, and operation of aids to navigation responsive to both current and future\nneeds of civil air and maritime interests of the U.S. the Plan also acknowledges\nthe needs of military users of airspace and coastal waters. However, the Panel\nconcludes that the current Plan does not adequately take into account the\npotential benefits that can accrue from the use of space techniques. Little\nplanning or experimentation is evident in the Plan to indicate that the need\nfor an integrated system (that is, integrated from the user\'s viewpoint) of\ncommunications and position determination is being adequately addressed. The\nPanel believes that a forum for the introduction of new needs does not exist.\nThe Panel views such technical entities as RTCM as useful but not adequate in\nthemselves. The DOT is urged to establish a more effective means of determining\nuser needs, including sponsorship of user conferences, experiments, and demonstration projects. Other federal agencies responsible for promotion of U.S. merchant\nshipping have initiated programs to explore available techniques and evaluate the\nbenefits. A combined effort is considered essential.\nA separate plan for military navigation services is maintained by DOD. It\nis significant that nearly all radio navigation systems for position determination employed around the world by the U.S, have been developed initially by DOD\nto satisfy military requirements. The civilian user of military position determination systems does not have an opportunity to adequately voice his needs.\nIt is primarily in the planning and implementation of DOD systems with future\ncivil availability where the user is least heard.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nThe Panel considers that a need exists for continuously available and highly\nreliable maritime mobile communications. The Panel has identified a variety of\nneeds for which space applications may be useful. These include the dissemination of service announcements, such as time signals; weather, wave, and ice\nbulletins and forecasts; the interchange of voice, teleprinter, data and facsimile\nservices to manage better the operation of ships and offshore facilities; and\nthe timely reception of ship movement reports and distress transmissions which\ncontribute to a more rapid and efficient conduct of search and rescue operations.\nWithin the past three years, several factors have stimulated industry interest in communications improvement. Included are (1) discussions of U.S. positions regarding current international planning for maritime satellite communication services, (2) satellite communication experiments on U.S. merchant ships,\n(3) increasing capital cost of new ships, and (4) escalation of fuel costs with\na resulting need for better at-sea control and management. Modern rapid communication services are now essential for the management of shipping.\n\n*Department of Transportation, National\nWashington, D.C., April 28, 1972.\n\nPlan for Navigation,\n\n11\n\n2nd revision.\n\nBetter means of expressing needs of the maritime user must be developed.\nTo date, the ocean shipping community has expressed user views. Other commercial\nmarine users such as fishing, exploration, scientific, and other offshore operators have yet to express their needs for maritime satellite communication services.\nThe Panel has attempted to foresee the requirements of these users and to factor\nthem into its recommendations. The Panel has found that much documentation of\nneeds exists in the area of monitoring but that there has been little expression\nof user needs for position determination. The Panel has attempted to foresee at\nleast to the 1990\'s any significant changes in user needs and its views are\nbased both on the experience of this Panel and on interchange with other panels\nof the 1974 summer study. Maritime trade organizations have and should continue\nto voice the needs of commercial ocean shipping. Providers of commercial satellites can be expected to identify for users potential and profitable applications,\nboth current and future. Government research programs such as the MARAD commercial fleet management program, environmental science and forecast services by\nNOAA, and merchant vessel safety programs of the USCG also will stimulate new\nuses of improved communications.\nCurrent needs in navigation and communications are briefly summarized as:\nA unified and continuously available global navigation system of\nsufficient accuracy to replace existing regional, high seas, and\nconfluence area systems\nIntegration of position determination and communications systems\nReliable and rapid communication to better manage shipping and\noffshore operations through interchange of data and messages\nImproved dissemination of time signals and service announcements\nsuch as weather, wave, and ice information.\nImproved alerting and locating of ships and persons in distress\nas an aid to search and rescue.\nWhile the potential users of monitoring, position determination, and communications facilities include federal, state, and local governmental agencies with\nmaritime concerns (including law enforcement), the majority of users will be in\nthe private sector, and include ship operators and management, naval architects,\noperators of offshore platforms and other offshore industries (such as oil\nexploration and production), fishermen, oceanographers and ocean engineers, and\nthose engaged in search and rescue, recreation, coastal industries, and the\noperation of special ships (such as for cable laying and mining).\n\n12\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM SPACE APPLICATIONS\n\nThe Panel visualizes potential benefits within the three broad areas considered:\t\nmonitoring, navigation, and communications. In the whole subject of\nmarine resources, these broad areas are overlapping and interrelated. Specific\nbenefits therefore are not categorized but are seen to be valuable for many\nusers throughout the marine community. For example, it should be noted that the\nremote sensors which must be developed for monitoring are only a part of the\nentire system necessary to achieve full benefits. Not only is it necessary to\ndevelop the technology, but also involvement in and acceptance of the new technology by the user community are required. These ideas are illustrated by the\nexamples of potential benefits in areas outlined below.\n\nCOASTAL CIRCULATION\nCoastal circulation is an important feature that threads through all coastalrelated activities. It is important for (1) in fisheries, where larvae are moved\nfrom the spawning grounds through the prevailing current system to other regions\nwhere they either grow or perish, (2) water quality, which is subject to change\nat any point as a function of the tidal system and prevailing currents, and\n(3) protection of life and property, where the focusing of wave energy in the\ncoastal region is gradually altered both by the methodical action of daily\ncurrents and where the dramatic effects of storms change the bathymetry and the\nshape of the coastline.\nTo describe coastal circulation using space techniques, both natural identifiers of water masses and artificial means may be used. The prime natural watermass identifiers observable at a distance are sea surface temperature, salinity,\nsuspended sediments, and suspended chlorophyll. Further, each is needed on a\nquantitative basis by the appropriate marine user community, so that multiple\nbenefits are found in remotely observing and quantifying these parameters.\nArtificial means are primarily the injection of slowly released dyes from sources\nanchored near the surface and the use of free-drifting buoys which may be tracked\nby either satellites or shore-based radar, the latter being more appropriate\nwhere ocean current systems are highly influenced by tides.\nCoastal circulation can be effectively described only by coupling tidal\nphenomena to the prevailing current system. In many coastal areas, tidal current\nis normally the strongest current system. Surface wind fields can alter surface\n\n13\n\ncirculation and during storms can dominate the circulation from the surface to\nthe bottom of the sea.\nThe impact of these conditions on defining coastal dynamics makes it necessary to observe circulation on a temporal scale appropriate to the dynamics.\nHence, tidal systems require repeated coverage every 20 to 30 minutes during\nflood, slack, and ebb. The cost of equipment and its emplacement would be quite\nlarge if the density of coverage necessary to define the details of coastal\ncirculation were accomplished entirely by in situ means. For this reason, a\ncombination of in situ and remote sensing techniques is needed. The ability of\nremote sensors with appropriate temporal coverage to provide synoptic circulation\ndetails brings significant benefits to the coastal disciplines.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL FORECASTING\nBecause the total ocean area of the earth\'s --urface is large compared to\nthe land area and because the oceans and the atmos,-)here interact in an important\nand complex way, much of the world\'s weather is strongly influenced by the waters\nand ice that comprise the oceans. The combination of surface measurements and\nsatellite meteorological and oceanographic data will significantly assist in\nachieving the goal of meaningful one- to two-week forecasts. Accurate five-day\nforecasts will immediately improve U.S. shipping operations. These five-day\nforecasts should reduce by an estimated 5 to 10 percent the present global\nshipping cargo and damage losses of about $500 million per year and should permit reductions in trans-oceanic transit time up to 10 percent (in the Atlantic,\n12 to 24 hours; in the Pacific, 12 to 60 hours).\n\nHAZARD DETECTION\nIt is difficult to predict consistently, 24 hours in advance and within\n200 km, the landfall of a major weather disturbance (for example, a tropical\ncyclone) and the resultant storm surge. As the number of people living along\nthe coasts (where about 80 percent of the U.S. population now resides) and as\nthe offshore facilities contemplated for coastal regions increase, the potential\nfor loss of life and property increases proportionately. In the world\'s lowlying areas -- for example, in the region of the U.S. along the Gulf of Mexico,\nwhere more than 30 million people dwell -- early warning of severe hurricanes\nis absolutely essential to permit evacuation of the population. Observations of\nsea-air interactions, sea surface temperature, wind, and waves, as well as an\nincreased understanding of the storm-surge process, will permit a large step\nforward in providing the required warning.\nCompilation of data on wave spectra, focusing of wave energy, and storminduced longshore currents is critically needed to improve ship and ocean\nstructure design.\nThe location of some 2000 to 3000 shoals on world hydrographic charts is\nuncertain. Such shoals, although shown on navigation charts, may not even exist,\nand they currently require avoidance by as much as SO km for the conservative\nship navigator. The existence and precise location of the shoals can be\n\n14\n\ndetermined using high spatial resolution instruments operating in both the visible and the microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nFISHERIES\nFrom 1959 to 1969, imports of fishery products accounted for 19 percent of\nthe total deficit in the U.S. balance of payments. In the late 1950\'s, the\nannual deficit was on the order of several hundred million dollars. Currently\nabout 70 percent of fishery products used in the U.S. are imported, and the\ndeficit is about $1.5 billion per year. An increase in the productivity and\nprotection of fisheries in our own coastal waters is needed to reduce U.S.\ndependency on other nations. Remote sensing techniques can be of benefit in\n(1) understanding fisheries-related biology to conserve fish stock and establish\nmaximum sustainable yields for the stocks, (2) enforcing international and other\nconventions and agreements related to fisheries, and (3) forecasting environmental\nconditions best suited for specific species of fish to determine the most likely\nlocation of schools.\nIt is necessary not only to improve U.S. coastal fisheries, but also to\ninventory fish stocks on a global basis. The total world-wide needs for protein\nmust be met by the combined supply from the sea and from the land. The strain\non the U.S. supply of soybeans that occurred when the anchovies off the coast\nof Peru disappeared attests to the importance of the sea\'s conrribution.\nAntarctic krill may well be an untapped protein source of the same magnitude.\nTheir availability is not yet well established but they school together at the\nsurface during certain portions of their lifetime in dense numbers and over areas\nof hundreds of square kilometers. Analysis of satellite data in conjunction with\nsurface studies may be the most economical method for census of this stock.\n\nICE SURVEILLANCE\nIt has been estimated that at any given time approximately 10 percent of\nthe ocean surface in the Arctic region is open water. Thus, the concept that\nthe Arctic is covered by an insulating blanket of ice is in error. This quantity of open water significantly affects meteorological and climatological conditions. The heat flow through the water-air interface is oetween 2 and 3 orders\nof magnitude greater than the heat flow through the water-ice-air interface.\nThe dynamics and forecasting of ice strain in terms of ice type, leads, and\npolynyas (ice-free passages) are thus important\'not only to shipping but also\nto long-term weather forecasts which are significantly affected by the location\nof major points of energy. To achieve these ends, the Panel believes that the\nPolar Experiment (POLEX), as a part of the Global Atmospheric Research Program\n(GARP), should be supported as a major program by NASA during the next decade.\nThe benefits will at first be scientific, that is, (1) the synoptic view of\nice conditions, and (2) the availability of surface truth for instrument calibration and validation. An intangible benefit will be the provision of an area\nfor international cooperation. Economic benefits can be established only through\nimproved weather forecasting both for ocean and continental environments.\n\n15\n\nIn addition to effecting weather and climate, ice presents a hazard to\nmarine transportation in various parts of the continental U.S. and in Alaska.\nThe Great Lakes, the U.S. central river system, and New England are becoming more\nand more important to the transportation of commodities. Nearly all iron ore\nwhich moves in the Great Lakes region is carried by ship. Significant amounts\nof wheat, oil products, coal, and finished goods also move across the region by\nship. Most vessels operating in the U.S. are not designed to operate unaided\nthrough ice-covered waters and ice-breaking service is provided, usually by the\nfederal government (U.S. Coast Guard). Therefore, capabilities to determine\nice coverage, clear water passages, pressure ridges, and ice thickness are important to success in extending the navigation season. An interim report* on the\nextension of the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes navigation season beyond the\nDecember 15 closing date shows the following estimated economic gains:\n\nGain in Millions of Dollars\nJan.\t 31\n\nNavigation season extended to\n\nFeb.\t 28\n\nYear round\n\nBy 1975\n\n40\n\n58\n\n68\n\nBy 1985\n\n85\n\n123\n\n145\n\nThese gross estimates are based on a number of factors including improved ice\nsurveillance, better data analysis and better prediction, all-season aids to\nnavigation, and increased icebreaking activity. No attempt has been made to\nassess the individual economic benefit of each of these contributing elements.\nIt is not possible at this point, therefore, to estimate what portion of the\npotential benefit would be derived from improved ice surveillance and forecasting.\nArctic and Antarctic icebreaking has historically been conducted in support\nof scientific investigations and, to a limited degree, in military operations.\nRecent discovery of oil deposits on the Alaskan north slope, coupled with the\npolitical and economic ramifications of a dependency on Middle East oil supplies,\nhas spurred activity in the far north. Scientific and geological surveys, commercial oil drilling, ocean transport, and supporting icebreaking requirements\nin high latitudes will place increasing emphasis on all-weather sensing and predicting of ice extent, polynyas, ice thickness, pressure ridges, and the discrimination of new ice from multi-year ice. The benefits of more complete data gathering and ice forecasting should be\nMore efficient icebreaking operations\nReduced damage to vessels and structures\n\n*U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The frequency\nof occurrence of oil pollution incidents are generally agreed to be a function of\nthe number of transfer operations between vessels and shore facilities, volume\nof oil transferred, number and length of vessel passages within U.S. waters, and\nnumber of offshore oil wells.\nThe size of the area to be monitored is significant. It includes thousands\nof miles of rivers, lakes, harbors, and coastal waters. Remote sensing techniques which enhance the ability to observe pollutant discharge will materially\nassist in the enforcement of applicable laws and will tend to ameliorate environmental damage through more rapid response and cleanup.\nThe USCG has observed marked decreases -- up to 25 percent -- in the number\nof oil spills when continued surveillance of critical areas has been employed.*\nAlthough much of this decrease can be attributed to increased attention to handling and transfer methods, the fact that better and more complete surveillance\nis being conducted tends to dissuade the intentional polluter. The cost of\ndaily observation of certain harbors and waterways with existing vessels and aircraft by the USCG is estimated to be between $2 million and $4 million. The cost\nmay exceed $18 million if a dedicated system for surveillance of pollution is\nextended to all major U.S. continental lakes and coastal waters. At present,\nhigh-resolutiun radar, imaging microwave radiometers, and multispectral lowlight-level television are being installed on aircraft for surveillance in lowaltitude flights. It is estimated that yearly costs could be decreased by about\none-third or one-half through the use of sensor systems which can detect surface\noil sheens of 1,000 m 2 or greater from aircraft flying at high altitude (and thus\nhaving increased swath widths).\nAssessing long-term environmental changes is another benefit which can accrue\nfrom daily wide-area monitoring of oil spillage and waste dumping. There is a\nneed to observe, over a period of time, pollutant levels and their subsequent\nimpact on and toleration by the marine environment. Assessing the ability of\nocean and coastal processes to dissipate hazardous polluting and noxious substances is considered necessary. Until such time as these and other processes\nare better understood, it will be impossible to estimate the quantity of waste\nwhich can be safely disposed of in the oceans and to determine the long-term\neconomic impact of oil spills and waste dumping.\n\n*Gerhard, Glen: A Study\n\nof\n\nof\n\nthe Cost Effectiveness\nRemote Sensing Systems for\nOcean Slick Detection and Classification. National Sea Grant Program, U.S. Coast\n\nGuard, Washington, D.C., 1972.\n17\n\nENDANGERED MARINE LIFE\nThe Marine Mammal Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-S22) focuses on the need to assess\nstocks of specific species of marine life in order to assure their continued\nexistence as well as to obtain the ultimate goals of restoring and maintaining\na viable commerce with certain of these species. The prime current need is to\nconduct a census of many mammals including, for example, sea otters, gray and\nbowhead whales, walrus, and seals. Three techniques appear appropriate for the\npurpose: (1) tracking of animals by surface, aircraft, or spacecraft observations,\nto determine the habits of the creatures, in particular, the time in and out\nof the water, (2) determining areal extent of the herds and numbers of animals in\nthe herds by overflights by aircraft, and (3) where appropriate, tracking ice\nfields by satellite to assess and forecast locations of ice where these animals\nare most likely to be found and thus to reduce aircraft search time. Beyond\nthose arising from the preservation and conservation of these marine animals,\nbenefits are difficult to establish.\n\nPOSITION DETERMINATION\nCivil maritime navigation (of which an important element is position determination) has traditionally been divided into three categories: the high seas,\nthe coastal confluence regions, the harbor and harbor-entrance zones. The high\nseas are defined as areas remote from land masses where visual references to land\nor other fixed or floating aids are not possible. The coastal confluence region\nincludes those waters contiguous to major land masses or island groups where\nships tend to converge toward harbors and where significant traffic exists in\npatterns essentially parallel to the coastlines. The harbors and harbor-entrance\nzones include those waters inside the mouths of bays and rivers.\nThe primary benefit to shipping of a position determination system for the\nhigh seas is the capability for a ship to follow closely a minimum-time or leastenergy transit route across apen ocean areas between more complex coastal zones.\nSuch a system provides a means whereby a vessel may fix its position in the\nabsence of visual or other short-range references. It should be capable of providing position fixing adequate to enable the mariner to avoid charted obstructions\nsuch as reefs, remote island groups, and coasts where, for whatever reason,\nnavigational aids do not exist. Oceanographic activities require position fixing\nof even higher accuracy to correlate by position various measured data. Persons\nin distress will benefit if their position is known by search and rescue\nauthorities.\nIn the coastal confluence region, the ability to navigate in proximity to\nland masses during periods of reduced visibility is a general benefit to shipping\nthat results from a position determination system. Higher density of ship\ntraffic in these regions and a resulting increase in hazard for collision or\nstranding imposes greater requirements for accuracy than on the open sea. The\nsystem should provide position fixing capability having an accuracy of approximately 200 meters. This accuracy is necessary to support anti-collision procedures such as maintaining traffic separation. Some commercial fishermen have\nmore stringent requirements, such as navigating parallel tracks or operating as\nclosely as possible to known bottom obstructions without hazard to their equipment. Agencies responsible for marking navigation channels and tracking\n18\n\noceanographic buoys have expressed a desire for precise determination of the\npositions of anchored and free-floating buoys and structures. The accuracy\nrequired is about 30 to 50 meters. Such capability does not currently exist.\nVessels, aircraft, or possibly shore-based radar therefore are -equired periodically to locate these buoys and to determine their precise movements. Checks on\nthe position of anchored buoys is necessary to determine if they have broken loose\norlave shifted position.\nAn important feature of a position fixing system is its repeatability; that\nis, the ability to return to a position previously fixed, whether that position\ncorresponds to a true position or not. A system with high repeatability can be\nused to track buoys or locate positions (fishing areas, for example) to which it\nis desired to return. Today, many fishermen locate fishing grounds not by an\nextact geographical position, but by using LORAN-A or LORAN-C time-difference\ncoordinates, which have high repeatability. OMEGA and TRANSIT, on the other hand,\nhave lower repeatability because they req ,jire factoring in time-variant corrections to establish a position. Any future space-based position determination\nconcept should take into consideration the advantages of repeatability.\nThe Panel has considered alternative approaches which can provide position\ndetermination service on a worldwide basis. These include the present OMEGA and\nTRANSIT systems, the proposed DOD Global Positioning System, and the postulated\nsatellite system of integrated communications and navigation.\nThe Panel recognizes that a comparison of the cost of existing position\ndetermination systems with that of proposed satellite-based systems is desirable.\nSome cost data on operational systems are available Lu; They are incomplete.\nComparisons of systems with varying coverage and capability as well as with differing user equipment costs are too complex and difficult to be attempted within\nthe time and resources available to the Panel. The Panel notes that recent cost\nstudies of terrestrial hyperbolic systems for the coastal confluence area have\nbeen made by the USCG* and a general analysis of all position-determination\nsystems has been undertaken by the Office of Telecommunications Policy.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nThe Panel agrees that the marine community can derive many benefits from\nthe development of high-quality communications and feels that these benefits can\nbe extended to the U.S. inland waterway industry. A recent study of communications requirements within the inland waterway industry has -been conducted by\nARINC Research Corporation for MARAD** and delineates services that are needed.\nThis study concluded that a satellite system to serve solely the inland-waterway,\nindustry was not economical and that in any event it could not be provided by\nthe time it was needed (mid-1970\'s). Nevertheless, as other domestic uses of\nsatellite communications grow, there may come a time when satellite communication\n\n*Polhemus Navigation Sciences, Inc., Radio Aids to Navigation for the U.S. CoaataZ\nConfluence Region.

At the same time, satellites offer wider bandwidths than are available for terrestrial circuits, and thus permit highspeed data transmission and\nother services not available from terrestrial stations. In addition, the use of\nsatel\'.ite communications may reduce somewhat the present congestion on high\nfrequency radio channels.\n\nECONOMIC ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nIt is extremely Jiff:;. It to assess accurately the economics of the maritime\nindustry. Among the variables that must be taken into account are vessel size,\ntrade route, and class (for example, tanker, freighter, ore ship, etc.). In\naddition, freight rates for marine bulk cargo depend on a number of variables and\nFluc uate daily.\nOne aspect of marine economics is touched on in a recent report regarding\nU.S. energy posture and forecasted needs prepared by the National Petroleum\nCouncil.* The report indicates that by 1985, 50 percent of U.S. petroieum requirements may be imported. If this were the case, between 10 million and 11 million\n\n*Law\n\nof the Sea, National\n\nPetroleum Council, May 1973.\n\n20\n\nbarrels of oil a day .would )e transported by ship from the Middle East. lu fulfill this requirement, the U.S. would need to be served by 400 vessels each\nhaving a capacity of 250 thousand deadweight tons. Using the average freight rate\nof $10 . 59 per ton which prevailed as of ,1anliary 1, 1974, * the following factors\napply in ra:culating what the annual freight cost would be by 1985 if 50 percent\nof II-E. p-^i:oleLm requirements are imported:\n\t\nAnnual cost per vessel\nNumber of vessels\n\n$12.6 million\n\n\t\n\n4CO\n\nTotal freight cost per year by 1985 \t\n\n$ 5.04 billion\n\nDue to the many variables in operating cost, such as the price of bunker fuel\nand fluctuating freight rates, even what might appear to be insignificant savings\nin time, distance, or fuel actually accrue to important amounts. For example,\non December 31, 1972, the daily cost of operating a tanker of 250 thousand ton\ndeadweight capacity was $22 , 000. On January 1, 1974, this cost had escala`ed to\n$36,50. The difference resulted principally from increases in the cost of\nbunker fuel.\nA major U.S. dry - cargo company estimates that improved navigation capability\nwill result in a distance saving of about 80 kilometers on a trans-Atlantic\ncrossing from New York to Gibralter. Computed fuel savings, using a fuel cost of\n$10.80 per barrel and a consumption rate of about 2 barrels per mile, amounts to\napproximately $ 2,160 per round trip. Projecting these amounts to 570 U . S. ozeangoing ships and assuming six round trips per year, yields potential annual savings\non fuel alone of the order of $ 7.4 million. On an international scale, more\nthan 40,000 ocean-going vessels are involved and the potential savi;igs are\nenormous.\nIn the past five years, world-scale frA ght rates have fluctuated by as much\nas a factor of two to three times. The economic impact on marine transportation\nhas been devastating. Any potential saving of ship operating time therefore is\nof tremendous significance. Improved weather routing, which in some instances\nprovides time savings up to 10 percent, would offer significant economic benefits.\nFor example, a freighter of 250 , 000 tons deadweight capacity requires 60 days\nof steaming for a round trip from Portland, Maine, to Mina Al Ahmadi on the\nPersian Gulf. A 10 percent saving ( 6 days) at $36 , 543 per day provides a possible\nsavings of about $ 219,260. While savings of this magnitude will not be realized\nfor all vessels all of the time, improved weather forecasting and ship routing\nwill nevertheless significantly aid commerce, particularly on trans-Atlantic\nand trans - Pacific passages.\n\n*Since the summer study, the freight rate has decreased somewhat.\n21\n\nCAPABILITIES REQUIRED IN MARINE APPLICATIONS\n\nMONITORING\nOpen-ocean physical oceanographic requirements appear to the Panel to be\nwell-addressed by NOAA and the SEASAT User Working Group. The instrumentation\nplanned for SEASAT-A, which is expected to lead to operational systems for the\noceanographic community, includes an altimeter, scatterometer, multifrequency and\npolarization microwave radiometer, infrared imager, and high-spatial-resolution\nradar imager. This ensemble of instruments will permit the collection of data\non wind, wave spectra and their refractions, currents, and the shape of the geoid,\nand will satisfy the research and development required to achieve many of the\nbenefits envisioned in physical oceanogmaphy. Additional information can be\nderived by cross-analysis of the measurements from this collection of instruments.\nThe Panel strongly endorses the instrumentation plan.\nThe Panel believes that the observation of biological phenomena necessary\nto satisfy oceanic requirements is less well developed. In part this is due to\na lack of stress on the importance of monitoring ocean chlorophyll. Photosynthesis in the ocean fixes as much carbon in the form of glucose as all terrestrial\nforms of photosynthesis combined, includi p, . both controlled and uncontrolled\ngrowth. Chlorophyll-a is primarily respons,ble for the photosynthesis process in\nthe ocean as well as on land. The importance of minitoring ocean chlorophyll-a\nis multifold: (1) it is a means of water-mass identification, (2) it is the first\nform of food in the sea life cycle and its availability And distribution may be\nused to locate animals such as fishes, that are higher up in the food chain,\n(3) the rate of production of chlorophyll, or productivity, can be used to assess\nthe total yield of food potentially available from the sea and to determine the\nSlobal balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide when it is coupled with other ocean\nvariables such as temperature and terrestrial observations, and (4) the quality\nof the water can be determined in terms of chlorophyll concentration since high\nconcentrations, particularly at the surface, are typically regarded as an indication of pollution or an unhealthy situation, whereas low concentration ;nay be\nquite normal in terms of seasonal effects and location or ma y represent the\nresult of some form of pollution which has killed the previously available\nchlorophyll.\nTwo primary factors are believed by the Panel to be responsible for the\nfailure to advance the status of biological oceanography in the space program.\nFirst, the development of instr u mentation for both aircraft and spacecraft has\n\'Lrubeen slow and only limited data from aircraft exist; consequently, the\nmentation proposed for satellite observation (NIMBUS-G) is at best marginal.\n\nit\n\n23\n\nPRECMING PAGE BLANK NOT FHAM\n\nIt should be upgraded to include a channel in the orange part of the spectrum to\nsatisfy certain requirements set up by NASA.* Secondly, the biologicaloceanography community is not sufficiently involved in the NIMBUS-G program and\nonly to a limited extent in the planned research and development on a Scanning\nImaging Spectroradiometer (SIS) to be carried at high altitudes by an airplane.\nThe Panel regards biological remote sensing as a high priority item which should\nbe addressed by a NASA program and which should be explored fully by the\nbiological-oceanography community through experimentation.\nOnly in the area of data collection systems has the use of satellite systems\nin monitoring advanced to the operational phase. The Synchronous Meteorological\nSatellite (SMS) or the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nhas the capacity to handle 10,000 or more data collection platforms in either an\ninterrogated or self-timed mode of operation. This technology, as well as associated ground systems for terrestrial applications, is currently operational. A\nstudy is underway to insure compatibility between the Earth Resources Technology\nSatellite-1 (ERTS-1**) data collection system and the SMS or GOES data collection\nsystem. Polar-region coverage will be insured by the TIROS-N Data Collection\nPlatform (DCP). The application of the SMS or GOES system to marine needs is\nhindered primarily by additional costs of using the system in the harsh ocean\nenvironment. In the developmental phase, techniques for position location of\ndrifting buoys using a data collection system have shown that accuracies of 1 to\n2 kilometers can be achieved. It appears that in the use of data collection systems for marine activities, emphasis should now be placed on lowering the cost\nof in situ instruments and the associated surface operations. Perhaps this can\nbest be brought about by creating a broader awareness of what can be accomplished\nthrough making full use of the capabilities of existing spacecraft.\nResearch based on Skylab altimeter data has advanced measurement of the\ngeoid to the developmental phase. Although the altimeter on SEASAT-A is only a\nresearch instrument, it appears suitable for determining the level and the slope\nof the ocean surface which in turn cause deflections of the apparent "vertical"\nfrom that through the center of the earth. These features of the ocean are\nthought to be the result oL_ gravity anomalies. They are important to geodynamicists in understanding ocean dynamics and they have other effects such as on the\naccuracy of inertial navigation systems.\nAll other techniques for monitoring of other ocean variables from aircraft\nand satellites are in the research and development phase. Aircraft monitoring of\ncertain limited areas can be made operational during the next 5 years to support\nmonitoring of U.S. coastal environments just as aircraft are used for law enforcement in these regions. However, no plan yet exists for such an approach. A study\nis warranted to determine the requirements for an operational aircraft system to\nsupport multiple coastal needs and to decide how to implement and manage this\nprogram. Elements of a useful research and development program for instruments\npreviously proposed should include:\n\n*Advanced Scanners and Imaging Systems for Earth Observctions, NASA SP-33, 1973,\nCh. 1.\n**Sincr vL-amed LANL`SAT.\n24\n\nFurther development of instruments to measure wind, waves, and\ntemperature over the ocean. Data from these instruments have\nimmediate usefulness since they can be applied to fisheries,\nweather forecasting, and ship operations. Furthermore, users\nhave facilities to process these data.\nCalibration of instruments, including development, prototype,\nand operational models, against the best surface measurements\navailable. Space instruments may be better in some respects\nthan current conventional ones but this cannot be determined\nwithout va p id measurements and calibrations.\nDevelopment of instruments that are capable of providing data\nnecessary for improving fisheries and include better means of\nmeasuring biological productivity.\nImprovement of models to forecast weather, wave conditions, and\nice movement using data derived from these instruments. The\nweather-forecasting models should include the effects of oceanic\nwinds and the surface layer of the ocean. Improved 5-day forecasts will have immediate benefits.\nThe Panel believes that the major problem in achieving real benefits from\napplying space systems to maritime monitoring activities is an institutional one.\nA lack of focus, both in the marine community and in NASA, does not permit\nthe emphasis and management necessary to accomplish potential benefits. To date,\nmarine monitoring has ridden on the successes of other space applications programs\nand has not been a program in its own right. Some requirements of marine monitoring are similar to those of both meteorology and earth resources but, where differences in spectral coverage and resolution have become an issue, decisions\nhave not been made in favor of the marine community. Hence, it is the strong\nopinion of this Panel (1) that marine-monitoring interest should be focused in\na single seat of authority in NASA and (2) that necessary coordination should be\nthe responsibility of an interagency body such as the Interagency Committee for\nMarine Science and Engineering (ICMSE).\nThe Panel sees a necessity for the close involvement of users in\nSpecifying type, quality, and quantity of data needed to meet\ntheir goals\nEvaluating instruments from the developmental phase through the\noperational system\nSpecifying data processing systems.\nThe eventual goal is to provide operational information to users. It is\nspecifically noted by the Panel that while some federal agencies will be users,\nmost of the users will be fishermen, ship operators, offshore petroleum interests,\nand the millions of ordinary citizens who use the seashore and coastal waters\nfor recreation.\n\n25\n\nCOMMUNICATION AND POSITION DETERMINATION\nThe Panel concludes that innovative development actions must be taken to\ndetermine optimum techniques for providing an integrated navigation and communications system of appropriate capability for ocean shipping. The Panel agrees\nthat space systems can provide the economy and reliability necessary. Further\nstudy must be made to determine the most effective way to provide positiondetermination services at high latitudes which the Panel believes will be requireo\nin the early 1980\'s.\nFull advantage of satellite communications systems should be taken to insure\nthe availability of the integrated position determination and communications\nnecessary for modern ship management. An additional but moderate research effort\nis required. Emphasis must be placed on feasibility-demonstration systems to\nprovide evaluation in terms of availability and accuracy. Further information on\ncosts can be developed as alternative methods are demonstrated. User evaluation\ncan proceed concurrently. It may be expected that commercial shipping companies\nwill modify their management techniques in order to exploit continuously available\ndata on ship positions integrated with shipboard monitoring, ca-board information\nprocessing, and automatic transmittal of status data to management and control\nsystems ashore. Other users will be able to take advantage of the capabilities\ndeveloped for commercial shipping and thus economically meet many of their needs.\nCurrent planning for spacecraft systems is limited to or is tailored to the\nsize and weight limits of current space transportation vehicles. The Panel considers that future systems should permit payloads without such limitations. In\nthis way position determination capability can be combined with programs in other\nappropriate spacecraft at significant cost savings.\nTests now scheduled for ATS-6 (1974-75) will provide additional data on\nsatellite-based ranging techniques. NASA involvement in its own tests, in those\nof other agencies (DOT, ESRO, and MARAD), and in a current NASA research program\nin position determination and traffic control should provide sufficient data to\ndesign an adequate demonstration project. A major problem in the implementation\nof such a position determination demonstration is the availability of adequate\nspacecraft for a sufficiently long period. Looking to the immediate future,\nMARAD has been reviewing alternatives within its joint program with NASA to\ndevelop the demonstration. Shipping companies have indicated preliminary interest in participation. To be effective, the program requires frequent and relatively long evaluation, probably during a significant portion of each day for\n8 to 12 months. Current planning envisages integration of position determination\nwith communications and now centers around the 1977-80 time frame. Spacecraft\nwhich may be used include MARISAT, ATS-6, or Aerosat.\nAs has been discussed, a major national re-evaluation of government-provided\nposition determination services is required. Concurrently also, a forum for\ninternational discussions must be implemented, and this institutional matter may\nbe the most difficult to achieve.\nThe Panel is of the opinion that several areas still require productive\nresearch and development in the field of communications. In order of relative\nimportance these requirements include:\n1.\t\n\nLess expensive spacecraft power generation to increase channel\ncapacity and permit reduced message charges\n\n26\n\n2.\n\nImproved spacecraft antenna systems to reduce the size, complexity and cost of the shipboard equipment\n\n3.\n\nProvision of economical service in the polar regions and relay\nof service over multiple-system segments\n\n4.\n\nAdapting satellite capability to serve user needs, particularly\nin exploiting multiple-use satellites\n\n5.\n\nMore efficient (in terms of power and bandwidth) modulation\ntechniques\n\n6.\n\nIntegrated shipboard sensor and transponder systems for remote\ncollection and retransmission of environmental, structural, and\nmachinery parameters\n\n7.\n\nPropagation and multipath data for the maritime band (1535-1660\nMHz)\n\n8.\n\nInvestigation of spectra suitable for future needs of satellite\nmaritime mobile communications.\n\nThe Panel further concludes that future maritime operations will require\nhigh-latitude operations in both polar regions. Such operations will include commercial transport, research of polar areas, mineral and fuel production, structures highly related to marine operations, fishing, and acquisition and monitoring\nof ocean environmental data. Current satellite systems now being implemented\nwill use geosynchronous orbits of low inclination. Analysis and experimental\nevaluation of techniques must be initiated to insure that such service will be\nefficiently integrated into the communications services provided for the polar\nareas by the current design system.\nAn operational maritime satellite communication system, MARISAT, will be\navailable in mid-1975. Two geosynchronous satellites will provide coverage over\nmost of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. ATS-6 will be used for communication\nexperiments for a year starting in July 1974, with additional use planned in\n1976. ESRO plans to launch an experimental maritime satellite (MAROTS) in 1977.\nThe Panel concludes that emphasis should properly be placed on the extension\nand improvement of these systems and foresees larger satellites of greater capability for mobile uses. The near implementation of operational systems will stimulate new and innovative applications of space technology and will be a catalyst\nfor users to seek advancement of this technology. The Panel considers that\ncontinued federal research efforts are essential to permit significant exploitation of space applications by users within the U.S. marine industries. Termination of research and demonstration programs at this time will cause current\nprogress to be lost to these users and prevent use of the benefits obtained from\npast research funding.\n\n27\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses has examined the general area\nencompassed by its terms of reference and concludes that three broad functions\nshould receive major attention. These are monitoring of the marine environment,\nposition determination, and communications. As a part of the Panel\'s initial\nanalysis, potential users who can apply satellite data systems to their needs\nare identified in each area. Much overlap exists since each function is an end\nin itself and at the same time is interrelated with and contributes to the other\nfunctions. Needs in each area are examined and defined. The Panel finds much\ndocumentation of needs in some areas (for example, in monitoring) and little\nuser expression in others (for exam p le, in position determination). An attempt\nwas made to foresee at least to the 1990\'s any significant changes in user needs,\nrelying both on the experience of this Panel and on interchange with other panels\nwithin the 1974 simmer study.\n\nMONITORING THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT\nThe Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses reached the following conclusions\nrelating to the function of monitoring of the marine environment:\n1.\n\nMan\'s increasing activity on and near the oceans and his continuing\ndependence on the sea as a source of protein leads to an increased\nneed to monitor and forecast the natural environment and to manage\nmaritime activities. Satellites can make an important and unique\ncontributi ..,n by supplying the data on which forecasts and management depend.\n\n2.\n\nThe general goals outlined in the 1967-68 summer study are stir\nappropriate to marine needs today, but operational requirements\nhave been altered to some extent through subsequent studies within\nthe marine community.\n\n3.\n\nThere has been good development of instrumentation for the measurement of physical parameters noted as significant in the 1967-68\nstudy report.\n\n29\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FHAMF11\n\n4.\n\nImportance of the oceans as a source of protein is widely\nrecognized, yet there has been little involvement of the biological and fisheries community in specifying what data are\nnecessary to assess biological productivity and in determining\nthe best means of obtaining these data.\n\nS.\t\n\nResearch and development of sensors has concentrated on hardware\ntechniques. Continued comparison of specific data from these\nsensors with valid in situ measurements throughout the entire\ncycle of research and development has been inadequate.\n\n6.\n\nAn understanding of coastal circulation is necessary to help solve\nmany near-shore problems such as pollution, sedimentation, and\nerosion. Remote sensing techniques are well suited to provide the\nrequired temporal and spatial coverage.\n\n7.\n\nMany of the instruments used by the marine community for remote\nsensing have been designed primarily for other applications. Few\ninstruments have been specifically tailored to marine needs.\n\n8.\n\nMany of the difficulties stated herein are institutional in nature\nand acceptable solutions must be responsive to the needs of the\nmarine community.\n\n9.\n\nIt is difficult to anticipate monetary benefits that can be derived\nfrom the application of aerospace techniques to global monitoring.\nCargo and shipping losses are now around $500 million yearly.\nImproved weather and wave forecasts should reduce this amount by\n5 to 10 percent. The balance of payments deficit attributed to\nimporting of fish and fish products is now around $1.5 billion\nyearly. Improving U.S. fisheries will lessen dependence on foreign\nproducts and help to alleviate the deficit in balance of payments.\n\nThe Panel offers the following recommendations relating to the function of\nmonitoring of the marine environment:\n\n1.\n\nResearch and development should continue to address the basic\nrecommendations of the Panel on Oceanography in the 1967-68\nstudy.\n\n2.\n\n:;,creased emphasis should be placed on the needs of biological\noceanography and fisheries.\n\n3.\n\nIncreased attention must be paid to the 1967-68 study recommendation made by the Panels on Oceanography and Points-to-Point\nCormnunications that greater emphasis be placed on the collection\nand analysis of in situ and other relevant forms of sea truth,\nincluding information from buoys.\n\n30\n\nof\n\n4.\n\nremote\nStronger emphasis should be given to the application\nsensors in the coastal environment, in particular, in circulation\nanalyses, because immediate benefits are possible.\n\n5.\n\nCare should be taken not to compromise marine requirements in\nsensors that are designed for muZtiple-discipline use.\n\n6.\n\nA single seat of authority for marine interests should be established within the Office of Applications of NASA.\n\n7.\n\nEither an existing body should be designated or a new one should\nbe created to work with NASA to determine priorities, coordinate\nprograms, and maintain requirements for the marine community.\nThis body should include representatives from federal and state\nagencies and from commercial marine users. It should provide a\nforum for early, effective, and continuing voices in programs\ndesigned to use remote sensing in marine applications.\n\nNAVIGATION AND POSITION DETERMINATION\nConclusions closely related to navigation and position determination include\nthe following:\n1.\n\nThe recommendations of the Panel on Navigation and Traffic Control\nin the 1967-68 study are valid and have not been implemented.\n\n2.\n\nThe proliferation of current operational position determination\nsystems provides overlapping services, none of which is completely adequate. The result is wasteful to the operator and user\nand is wasteful of government funds and of the radio frequency\nspectra.\n\n3.\n\nA number of experiments using several techniques for satellite\nmaritime position determination have been completed and demonstrate\nbasic feasibility.\n\n4.\n\nA need exists for a unified and continuously available global\nposition determination system of sufficient accuracy to replace\nexisting regional systems.\n\nS.\t\n\nThe position determination system should, as an optimum method for\neconomy and effectiveness, be integrated with a satellite mobile\ncommunication system.\n\n6.\n\nCoverage is initially required between 70 0 N and 70 0 S latitude\nwith polar-region coverage to be added for the 1980\'s.\n\n7.\n\nAccuracy needed for the system should be about 200 meters.\n\n31\n\n8.\n\nA more effective forum is needed to enable users to state their\nrequirements and to provide for national coordination. International coordination and standardization also are urgently needed\nto provide adequate service to users.\n\n9.\n\nInnovative research and development are required to provide\nintegrated navigation and communications services, to improve\ntechniques for equatorial and polar accuracy, and to reduce\ncosts.\n\nRecommendations concerning navigation and position determination include the\nfollowing:\n\n1.\n\nResearch and development should be directed toward techniques\nthat are needed for establishing an economically viable maritime\nsatellite position determination system.\n\n2.\n\nA demonstration project should be conducted jointly by go.;eniment and industry users in order to evaluate the integration\nof satellite communications and position determination in maritime mobile uses.\n\n3.\n\nThe U.S. Department\nTransportation should exercise leadership\nin establishing a national policy on position determination and\nshould consult with other government agencies, with users, and\nwith other maritime interests.\n\n4.\n\nImmediate action should be taken to convene an international forum\nto agree on a global position determination system and to arrive at a\nplan to bring the system into being.\n\n5.\n\nA continuously available global position determination system\nof sufficient accuracy should be developed and impler-snted to\nreplace existing regional systems.\n\n6.\n\nApplications research and development should be conducted to\ndetermine an effective system for providing position determination\nservice in the polar regions.\n\nof\n\nCOhA MICATIONS\nConclusions that pertain specifically to communications are as follows:\n1.\n\nCurrent communication services available to maritime users do\nnot meet the needs for modern marine operations.\n\n2.\n\nAn adequate forum for users to express their needs does not\nexist and an improved forum is needed.\n\n32\n\n3.\n\nMarine users often are skeptical of new technological systems\nand a demonstration capability is needed to facilitate commercial\nimplementation and to optimize benefits.\n\n4.\n\nDuring the past 5 years a number of studies and experimental programs have been conducted on the use of satellite techniques in\nmaritime activities. The results of these efforts make available\nconsiderable information.\n\n5.\n\nBasic technology to implement satellite maritime service is available but additional specific applications research and development are required.\n\n6.\n\nExperiments which have been completed or which are scheduled in\nthe near future will offer innovative use of satellite capabilities\nin maritime communications. These have been done primarily with\nshipping companies and similar programs in other areas are\ndesirable.\n\n7.\n\nImplementation of a commercial satellite maritime system in mid1975 by a U.S. consortium covering the Atlantic and Pacific\nOceans will provide a means for long-term evaluation of techniques,\nboth technological and managerial.\n\n8.\n\nTo derive maximum benefits, the operational system should be\nextended as soon as possible to be worldwide (between 70 0 N and\n70 0 S latitude). Such global service must be reliable, continuously available, and cost effective.\n\n9.\n\nPolar-region coverage of communication services will be required\nin the 1980\'s.\n\n10.\n\nWhile current radio-frequency allocations are adequate, additional\nspectra will be required in the 1980\'s.\n\nRecommendations concerning communications include the following:\n\n1.\n\nOperational maritime satellite communications systems should be\nextended to provide worldwide coverage.\n\n2.\n\nResearch and development should provide a basis for significantly\ngreater and more economical satellite power sources and improved\nsatellite antennas.\n\n3.\n\nConcurrently with spacecraft improvements, industry should develop\nshipboard terminals that are compatible with satellite maritime\ncommunications facilities.\n\n33\n\n\t\n\n4. Techniques and a demonstration program should be developed to provide conrmmications services in polar regions and should include\nthe potential applications available with multi-service satellites.\n\nFUTURE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT\nThe Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses has summarized its findings concerning technological capabilities that must be developed in order to make feasible\nproposed applications of space systems to current maritime needs. The following\ndevelopments in specific capabilities are recommended:\n\n1.\n\nLow-light-level mapping systems for ocean bioluminescence\nsurveys.\n\n2.\n\nSystems to conduct quantitative chlorophyll-mass surveys.\n\n*3.\t\n\nAll-weather and global systems to measure sea surface temperature to about +0.2\xc2\xb0 C and salinity to about 2 parts per thousand\nwith a resolution of 1 km.\n\n4.\n\nSystems to determine ocean wave spectra and wave diffraction\npatterns, which depend on bottom topography.\n\n5.\n\nSystems for mapping the sea bottom to depths from 30 to 50 m.\n\n*6.\n\nSystems to determine global surface-wind fields to +10 percent\nor to less than 5 m/s in speed and to +0.35 radians in direction.\n\n*7.\n\nImaging radar systems to monitor sea ice and open-water areas in\nthe polar regions.\n\nof offshore\n\n8.\n\nSystems to monitor positions\n30 to 50 m.\n\n9.\n\nSimple and low-cost ($10,000) systems for continuous global voice\nand data transmission from ships between 75\xc2\xb0 N and 75\xc2\xb0 S latitude.\n\n10.\n\n*11.\t\n\nfacilities to within\n\nSimple and low-cost ($10,000) systems for continuous global ship\nposition determination between 75\xc2\xb0 N and 75\xc2\xb0 S latitude and to\n200 m near congested areas and to 2000 m for open oceans.\nSystems ro detect heavy rnzn areas over the open oceans.\n\nof the Panel on Weather and\nof Space Systems. National\n\n*Similar capabilities are recommended in the Report\nClimate (Supporting Paper 1), Practical Applications\nAcademy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1975.\n34\n\nIn addition to the foregoing \xc2\xb0,pecific capabilities, the Panel further recommends that:\n13, bollowup experiments including in situ measurements becarried\n\nout to prove the feasibility of the proposed technical developments.\n14. A central data management facility for marine use be established\nacrd that data (voice, teletype, cargo and ships status, time\narrival, etc.) be transmitted as is the case for normal teletype\ntraffic.\n\nof\n\nINFLUENCE OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE\nMany of the needed ocean observations can be made only from satellites on\npolar orbits. Further, in those cases where the observation must be made in the\nvisible portion of the spectrum, the polar orbits must be sun-synchronous. Geostationary orbits are needed for some marine monitoring, particularly for the\nmeasurement of coastal circulation. Until the space shuttle system can place\nsatellites in polar orbits and in geostationary orbits, conventional launch\nvehicles will be needed if the needs of the maritime community are to be met.\nLong-term needs for data on sea surface temperature and salinity may be the only\nfactors which will influence the development of the space transportation system.\nPolar-orbiting systems, which must monitor the oceans on a near-daily basis with\nresolutions of about 1 kilometer, will require microwave antennas of 100 to 200\nmeters in extent since the L-band (salinity) and the S- to C-bands (sea surface\ntemperature) are the frequencies to be used in observations. Aside from the\npotential problem with these large antennas, a fully developed space shuttle\nsystem having polar and geostationary orbit capability appears adequate to\naccomplish the marine monitoring anticipated during the remainder of the twentieth century.\n\n35\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nA Study of Maritime Mobile Satellite Service Requirements, Frequency Planning,\n\nModulation and Interference Analysis, Vol. 1 to V and Summary.
