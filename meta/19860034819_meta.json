In particular, attention is given to the feasibility of simulating such measurements from an airborne platform. A brief discussion of the proposed Doppler lidar system is presented along with a description of the computer simulation and airborne measurements. The measurements will be performed using a pulsed CO2 Doppler lidar in a scan configuration similar to that expected for the satellite system. Computer simulations will be used in addition to measurements to assess the accuracy of the scan technique and to determine the scalability of the measurements.", "title": "Airborne simulation of a satellite based Doppler lidar", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860034819, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bilbro, J.
