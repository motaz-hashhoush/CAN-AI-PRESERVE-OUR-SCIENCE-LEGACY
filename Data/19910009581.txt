We have\ncategorized and scoped the different types of commercial space\nactivities, assessed the unique requirements and issues affecting\nthe growth of each, and developed mechanisms to carry out a\ncomprehensive and aggressive program.\nWe witnessed this year the re-emergence of an active flight\nprogram of industrial research and development experiments in\nspace. These industry investigations into the practical commercial\nuses of space represent a growing interest by the U.S. private\nsector, stimulated and encouraged by NASA- sponsored\nprograms.\nThere is an increasing recognition, both in the U.S. and\nabroad, that space has attributes that are of great value. These\nresources and characteristics will play a major role in opening a\nnew economic frontier for the spacefaring nations of the world.\nIt is clear then that commercial development is both a logical\nnext step in America\'s civil space efforts and a prudent\ncompetitive strategy.\nOur challenge is to organize these efforts into a program that\ndevelops commercial space markets, low-cost commercial space\ntransportation systems, and a commercial space infrastructure\nindustry.\nThe rewards of our success will be significant contributions\nto America\'s future industrial competitiveness, and the maximum\neconomic returns to our stockholders - the American people.\n\nJames T.

We must\nextend American leadership in technology,\nincrease long-term\ninvestment, improve our\neducational system, and\nboost productivity. These\nare the keys to building a\nbetter future?"\nThe President\'s\ncomments not only\nechoed the concerns of a\nnation, but also form the\nbasis of recent legislative\nand executive directives\nconcerning technology\ntransfer.\nThe failure of many\nU.S. firms to capitalize\non the research and\ntechnologies generated in\nfederal programs is widely\nviewed as a major factor\nin the U.S?s declining\nglobal marketplace\nposition.\nIn an effort to bridge\nthis critical gap, NASA\nhas continued to review\nand strengthen its own\ntechnology utilization\nprogram, comply quickly\nwith specific directives,\nand work closely with\nother organizations.\nIn 1989, the agency\nbegan implementation of\na new strategic plan,\nwhich serves as a\nguideline for NASA\ntechnology tranfers. The\nplan was formulated\nfollowing a thorough\nreview of the program\nin 1988.\n\nA demonstration\nat MIT\'s Artificial\nIntelligence\nLaboratory\nshows use of a\nprototype robot\nhand, developed\nas a result of a\nNASA program\nto promote\nadvancements in\nthe development\nof dextrous\ntelemanipulators\nfor space and\nindustrial\napplications.\n\n-\n\nCOL..\ntwelve\n\nA California\ncompany\ndiscovered a\ncommercial\nmarket among\nprincipal electronic systems\nmanufacturers\nfor a training\ncircuit board\nused to instruct\nand qualify\nworkers. The\nmarket was\nidentified as a\nresult of work\nthe firm\nperformed for\nthe Jet\nPropulsion\nLaboratory.\n\nNASA was also the\nfirst federal agency to\ndistribute its patent\nroyalty income as\nrequired by Public Law\n99-502. On June 3, 1988,\nchecks totaling $56,944\nwere issued to 35 current\nand former NASA\nemployee-inventors.\nThe checks paid the\ninventor\'s share of NASA\'s\npatent royalty income\nreceived between the\neffective date of the\nFederal Technology\nTransfer Act of 1986\n(October 20, 1986) and\nDecember 31, 1987 Some\n$61,000 in royalties\nreceived during 1988 are\ncurrently being\ndistributed.\nIn addition, NASA\nresponded to a mandate\nfrom congressional\nconferees of the\nCommittees on\nAppropriations aimed at\ncoordinating federal\ntechnology transfer\nefforts by providing\nindustry with a single\npoint of contact.\nThe mandate directed\nNASA\'s Office of\nCommercial Programs to\n"conduct a definition/\ndesign study of the fiveyear master plan for the\nestablishment of a\nnational repository for\nfederal research and\ndevelopment (technology\ntransfer), which would\nbe located in West Virginia.....Five-year cost\nestimates and a proposal\nfor cost sharing were also\nrequested.\nNASA assigned preparation of the study to the\nTechnology Utilization\nDivision, which in turn\n\nLL:\n\nCOL\t\n\nH\n\nthirteen\n\nformed a task team of\ntechnology transfer\nexperts to assist with\nthe effort.\nFollowing the development of a preliminary\nNational Technology\nTransfer Center design,\nthe task team solicited\ncomments from\nrepresentative federal\nagencies involved in the\ntechnology transfer\nprocess.\nThe incorporation\nof these inputs helped\nproduce a plan that\npromises significant\nbenefits for the public\nand private sectors.

An assessment\nof the SBIR program\nconducted by the General\nAccounting Office\nconcurred with NASAs\nfindings.\nThe NASA survey\nfound that the results of\nmore than half the SBIR\nprojects reviewed have\nalready been incorporated or will soon be\nincorporated into NASA\nmission programs and\nthat many projects have\nsubstantially advanced the\ntechnology base in several\nareas. The survey\nrevealed that the quality\nof research conducted in\nSBIR projects was as\nhigh or higher than\ncomparable research\nfunded through other\nR&D means, and that at\nleast one-fourth of the\nprojects had already\nresulted in commercial\nproducts or enterprises by\nthe small businesses.\nNASA data also\nindicate that a substantial\nnumber of minority and\ndisadvantaged firms have\nwon SBIR contracts for\nhigh-technology projects.\n\nProgram Elements\nThe SBIR program\nconsists of three distinct\nphases. Phase I objectives\nare to establish the\nfeasibility of innovative\nconcepts proposed by\nsmall businesses to meet\nNASA program objectives, solve problems, or\nexploit new technological\nopportunities. Phase I\nprojects are completed in\nsix months and are\nfunded up to $50,000.\nPhase II is the principal\nSBIR activity, in which\nmore than half of the\nPhase I projects are more\nfully developed. Phase II\nprojects may be funded\nup to $500,000 and may\ntake up to two years to\ncomplete.\nIn Phase III, the small\nfirm uses private sector\ncapital to commercialize\nits SBIR project result, to\nsell its product or service\nto a government agency\nor contractor, or to obtain\ngovernment support for\nfurther R&D. Phase III\nmay not employ SBIR setaside funding.\n\nOCP Budget for Small Business Innovation Research\n(Current Dollars)\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nFY86\t\n\nFY87\t\n\ntwenty-one\n\nFY88\t\n\nFY89\n\nCR NL PAGE\r\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\nFY 1989 SBIR Activities\n\n-\n\n\xc3\xb8\n\n.\\\n.. .e\n\nA\n\nGMD Systems of\nHendersonville,\nPennsylvania,\nunder contract to\nNASA\'s Kennedy\nSpace Center,\ndeveloped a\nbadge for monitoring workers\'\nexposure to the\ntoxic propellant\nhydrazine.\n\nThrough an SBIR\ncontract with\nNASA\'s Johnson\nSpace Center,\nHouston, BoMed\nMedical\nManufacturing\nLtd., an Irvine,\nCalifornia, firm,\ndeveloped a noninvasive heart\nmonitor that has\nbeen incorporated into a\ncommercially\nsuccessful\nsystem.\n\ntwenty-two\n\nSBIR activities during\nFY 1989 included the\nselection of 228 Phase I\nawards from the nearly\n2,400 proposals submitted\nin response to the 1988\nProgram Solicitation.\nDuring 1989, 100 Phase II\nawards were made for\nfurther development of\nPhase I projects initiated\nduring 1988. The 1989\nSBIR program was initiated with the issuance\nof the 1989 SBIR\nsolicitation.

The\ncompany delivered a\nsuccessful device now\n\nbeing used in research on\nthe effects of weightlessness on astronauts.\nThe company sold a\nversion of this monitor\nfor use in hospital\noperating rooms and\nintensive care units and\ninvested in the development of a comprehensive\nsystem for non-invasive\nhemodynamic and\ncardiodynamic patient\nmonitoring and\ntherapeutic management.\nIn 1988 it launched its\nnew system. Revenues\nhave increased seven-fold\nsince 1984, and the\ncompany is now\nprofitable. BoMed\nattributes much of its\nsuccess in this field to\nthe opportunity provided\nby SBIR.\nGMD Systems, Inc.,\nof Hendersonville,\nPennsylvania, has been\nworking with the Kennedy\nSpace Center to develop a\nbadge that will measure a\nworker\'s exposure to\nhydrazine. Hydrazine is\nan extremely toxic fuel\nwith various applications,\n\nincluding use in the Space\nShuttle\'s Orbital\nManeuvering Vehicle.\nThe badge monitors\na worker\'s cumulative\nexposure by changing\ncolor and responds to\nthe current permissible\nexposure limit for\nhydrazine in as little as\n15 minutes. This will allow\nemployees to evacuate a\ncontaminated work zone\nbefore hydrazine has\naccumulated to\ndangerous levels.\nBecause this is the first\nhydrazine detector to\nmeasure personal exposure levels, the firm\nexpects there to be a\nsignificant market\nwherever it is used,\nwhether in spacecraft,\nmissiles, boiler cleaning,\nor fertilizer production.\n\ntwenty-three\n\n1381\n\nFuture Focus\n\nBased on the FY 1990\nbudget request, the\nNASA SBIR budget is\nexpected to exceed $60\nmillion, from which\nNASA anticipates\nconsiderable growth in\nthe numbers of SBIR\ncontracts awarded and of\nsmall businesses\nparticipating in NASA\'s\nR&D programs.\nEfforts to promote\ncommercial development\nof SBIR project results\nwill continue to focus on\ndisseminating project\nresults more widely and\ndeveloping linkages\nbetween the SBIR\nprogram and the NASA\nIndustrial Application\nNetwork, the Small\nBusiness Development\nCenters, and the Centers\nfor the Commercial\nDevelopment of Space.\n\n\t\n\nInternational and\nDomestic R&D Trends\nrercentage of Total\nFunded by Business\n\nThe charts and graphs included in this section\t\ncharacterize key international and domestic trends in\t\nresearch and development expenditures.
