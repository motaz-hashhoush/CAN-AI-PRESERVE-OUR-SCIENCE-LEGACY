b'ARC-15684-1\n\nInteractive Inventory Monitoring\nThis system queries the location and status of an item in an inventory.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nThe invention is a radio frequency identity detector (RFID)-based system that assists a user in location of an item\n, in response to an electronic query for the status of the item. The item(s) being sought may be a book on a library shelf,\nan item from a store inventory, a legal or financial document, a medical record, a weapon system or weapon component\n(presumably) located in an armory, or similar item.\nEach item is tagged by an RFID, which does not require a battery, but is preferably powered using an electromagnetic\ncoil that is embedded in, or associated with, the item. The shelving, or other container, provides an alternating\nelectromagnetic field to power the embedded coils, and can identify the item location if the item is on, or adjacent to,\nthe shelving/container, even if the item is not in its assigned location. Each coil includes a low-power, programmable\nchip containing relevant information on the item (ID number, class to which the item belongs, present status of the\nitem, relevant item characteristics, recent activity affecting the item, etc.). Removal of the item from the shelf/container\nmay first require entry of specified information, including but not limited to user name, user contact information, user\npriority level (if applicable), date the item was removed, and user authentication information. An associated light\nemitting diode (LED) array containing different colored LED light sources is optionally included for visual indication\nof location(s) of the item.\nA desired item is specified and/or categorized using a database system with a computer interface. The interface may be\na portable interrogator wireless electronic unit that communicates with the database, and with the item(s) sought. When\nthe portable interrogator unit queries an RFID Tag, the computer interface downloads information on the item from the\ndatabase, and/or from the shelving/container (e.g. availability and/or recent location and/or present status of the item).\nOptionally, based upon a color code scheme assigned to the particular handheld unit, the shelving/container LED array\ndisplays the corresponding distinguishable color scheme wherever the item(s) is/are located.\nThis system can also provide security for an inventory of weapon systems, weapon components, and\nbiological/mechanical warfare substances or other sensitive items that require extreme protection. In this instance, the\ninventory receptacle is powered continuously, and each protected item emits a unique, encrypted code associated with\nthe item, when the item is on, in, or adjacent to the receptacle at its assigned location. When the protected item is not on\nor adjacent to the receptacle at its assigned location, or is located elsewhere on or adjacent to the receptacle, an alarm or\nnotification signal is issued by the system, indicating when the item was last sensed at its assigned location. Use of an\nencrypted code of appropriate complexity can minimize or eliminate the possibility of \xe2\x80\x9cspoofing\xe2\x80\x9d to cover absence of\nthe protected item. Entry of an encrypted password allowing access to the protected item could be used to avoid prompt\nissuance of an alarm signal.\n\r\x17\x18! %\x1d \x19 %\x10! \x13\x1d\x1c\x14 \x11& \x0c"\x14$\x10\x1c \' \x0c\x1e \x14\x1b\x1d \x10\x1c\x13 \x0e!\x14\x1c \' \x0e\x13\x1d\x17 \x1d\x15 \x1b\x14! \x0b\x14!\x14\x10 \x12\x17 \x14\x1c"\x14 \' \x15\x17 \x13\x15\x17\x0c \x10\x14\r\x15\x17\x13 \x19\x10\x15\x14\x1d\n\x0b\x15\x1b\x14\x12\x15 \x0b \x19\x0f\x0c \x0c\n\x0f\x14\x10\n \x12 \x1a\x16\x16\x15\x17\x19 \n\x11 \x0e\x0c \r\x17\x0c\x0c \x1b\x0f\x10\x19\x0c \x16 \x16\x0c\x17! \x19 \x1b\x1b\x1b\x1e\x19\x0c\n\x0f \x17\x10\x0c\r\x18\x1e\n\x15\x13\x1f\x19\x18\x16 \x1a\x14\x0b\x0c\x17 \x19\x0f\x0c\n\x12\x0c\n\x19\x17\x15\x14\x10\n\x18\x1f \x15\x13\x16\x1a\x19\x0c\x17\x18 \n \x19\x0c\x0e\x15\x17\x1c\x1e \x1c\x1f#\x18 \x18\x14! \x12\x1d\x1c\x12\x14 \x1c\x18\x1c\x16 \x18\x16\x17"! \x15\x1d "\x17\x14 \x12\x1d\x1b\x1b\x14 \x12\x18\x10\x1a #!\x14 \x1d\x15 "\x17\x18! \x18\x1c$\x14\x1c"\x18\x1d\x1c !\x17\x1d#\x1a\x13 \x11\x14\n\x10\x13\x13 \x14!!\x14\x13 "\x1d "\x17\x14 \x1b\x14! \r\x14\x12\x17\x1c\x1d\x1a\x1d\x16& \n\x10 "\x1c\x14 !\x17\x18\x1e! \x18$\x18!\x18\x1d\x1c \x10" ,(2//( \x0c ( \x0f ),(2//(0-1-(-.3* \x1d\n!#\x1b\x14\x13\x17\x10\'\x16\x10 #\x13+\x1c\x10!\x10\'\x16\x1d$\' \x0b\x14\x15\x14 "\x1d \x0b (,/02.(,\n\nUnited States Patent\n\n(10) Patent\n\nSpremo et al.\n\n(12)\n\n(45)\n\n(54)\n\nL"TERACTIVE INV ..: NTonv MONITOlW,\' G\n\n(75)\n\nInventors: S It\'va n M.
