b'INTERN ABSTRACT\nHolodeck \xe2\x80\x93 ISS Experience\n\nPhillip Rainbolt\nSummer 2016\n\nFor the duration of my internship here at JSC for the summer 2016 session, the main\nproject that I worked on dealt with hybrid reality simulations of the ISS. As an ER6 intern for the\nspacecraft software division, the main project that I worked alongside others was with regards to\nthe Holodeck Virtual Reality Project, specifically with the ISS experience, with the use of the\nHTC Vive and controllers.\nFor the project itself, the main duties I was assigned dealt with making the overall ISS\nexperience as realistic as possible, trying to incorporate more user interaction between the station\nand user. In doing so, my task was to incorporate moveable hatch doors on the station, as the\ncurrent version of the ISS experience has a set of hatches that are always open and there is no\nway for users to interact with them and close them. Besides that, I was also assigned to attempt\nand make a model of a Robonaut that is on the space station possessable, in the sense that the\nuser could go up and be able to take control of the Robonaut. While controlling the Robonaut,\nthe user\xe2\x80\x99s point of view would become that of the Robonaut, allowing them to see from the\nRobonaut\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. On top of seeing from the Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s view, the user would also be able\nto control and move the Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s arms, moving them as their own, with the aid of the HTC\nVive controllers. The user\xe2\x80\x99s controllers would become the Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s arms and thus the user\ncould move its arms around as such.\nRegarding the accomplishments that I made for the project, I was able to go into Blender,\nwhich is an animation modeling software that we used to design objects to use on the ISS, and\nremove the hatches that were already there. By doing so, it allowed me to go back into Unreal\nEngine 4, the game development software that is being used for the entire project, and import a\nmodel of the space station with hatches. Thus, this gave me the opportunity to go and import the\nhatch that I removed back into unreal engine 4 to use as an animation object, and thus use it for\n\nmaking both intractable manual and automatic hatches for the user. From there, I was able to go\nin and make automated hatches as well as manual hatches that the user could interact with. Due\nto technical difficulties and unexpected problems, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to work on the Robonaut task as\nmuch as I had planned and was only able to get the hatch capability implemented.\nThe experience that I gained from my internship here is simply amazing, and the things\nthat I learned from it are even more so, in the sense that I never would\xe2\x80\x99ve seen myself learning\nand working with the programs and software that I did while here at JSC. I learned the basics of\nusing the game development rendering engine Unreal 4, how Blueprints within Unreal Engine 4\nwork, and how visual scripting works (which is basically a visual form of coding). On top of\nthat, I learned how to use Blender for creating 3D animated objects, and was able to import\nobjects to be used inside Unreal Engine 4. Additionally, I got a glimpse of how to code and\ncreate my own plugins that could be used inside the Unreal Engine 4 to perform the functions\nthat the task required.\nMy internship at JSC has allowed me to see what goes on inside of NASA and what kind\nof projects are being worked. It has allowed me to see another perspective on the type of career\nthat I may want to pursue after I have graduated from the University of Houston. Working with\nvirtual reality, the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine 4 has given me a peek as to what goes into\ndeveloping games. However, it has also let me see what kind of things can be done using the\nsame concepts game developers us in other areas. In the end, I see myself coming to the decision\nof whether or not I want to pursue a career into video game design and development, or continue\nmy time here at NASA and be able to come back as a full-time employee in the future.\n\n'
