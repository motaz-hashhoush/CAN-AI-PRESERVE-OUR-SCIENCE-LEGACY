The HOST program is concerned with oxidation and hot corrosion attack of metallic coatings as well as their degradation by interdiffusion with the substrate. The effects of the environment and coatings on creep/fatigue behavior are being addressed through a joint effort with the Fatigue sub-project. An initial effort will attempt to scope the problem of thermal barrier coating life prediction. Verification of models will be carried out through benchmark rig tests including a 4 atm. replaceable blade turbine and a 50 atm. pressurized burner rig.", "title": "Surface protection overview", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850002670, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Levine, S.
