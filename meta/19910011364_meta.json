Orbiter processing entails all the inspection, testing, repair, and maintenance necessary to prepare the Shuttle for launch and takes place within the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) at KSC, the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), and on the launch pad. The problems are extremely combinatoric in that there are thousands of tasks, resources, and other temporal considerations that must be coordinated. Researchers are building a scheduling tool that they hope will be an integral part of automating the planning and scheduling process at KSC. The scheduling engine is domain independent and is also being applied to Space Shuttle cargo processing problems as well as wind tunnel scheduling problems.", "title": "The Ames-Lockheed orbiter processing scheduling system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910011364, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zweben, Monte"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA., United States"}}, "id": "3b52b099efa44f29a4cdc31bf0079eac"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910011364, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gargan, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.", "location": "Palo Alto, CA., United States"}}, "id": "11a1f296eb2f4888a2fb976fbd091aa7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910011364, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910011364, "id": "1ff7b98e2c5d469caf33040693930ec9", "publicationName": "NASA, Lyndon B.
