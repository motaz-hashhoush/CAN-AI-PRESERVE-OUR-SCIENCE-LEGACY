The airplane has been evaluated in its closed-door configuration, as well as several open-door configurations. Work performed included: acoustic analysis tool development, cavity acoustic evaluation, stability and control parameter estimation, air data calibration, and external flow evaluation. Qualitative airflow data were obtained during the closed- and open-door flights using tufts on the aft portion of the fuselage. Video was taken from a chase plane. This video was analyzed for various flight conditions, and general flow descriptions of the aft fuselage of the 747SP were developed for the different closed and open door configurations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120006572, "id": "614c93535fbf4f6f93c0c56a36444915", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120006555, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120006572.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120006572/downloads/20120006572.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120006572/downloads/20120006572.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120006572/downloads/20120006572.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
