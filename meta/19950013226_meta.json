There are many methods of developing software, but at this time, the most promising is the object oriented (OO) method. This method involves an analysis to abstract the problem into separate 'objects' that are unique in the data that describe them and the behavior that they exhibit, and eventually to convert this analysis into computer code using a programming language that was designed (or retrofitted) for OO implementation. This paper discusses the creation of three different applications that are analyzed, designed, and programmed using the Shlaer/Mellor method of OO development and C++ as the programming language. All three, however, require the use of an expert system to provide an intelligence that C++ (or any other 'traditional' language) is not directly suited to supply. The flexibility of CLIPS permitted us to make modifications to it that allow seamless integration with any of our applications that require an expert system. We illustrate this integration with the following applications: (1) an after action review (AAR) station that assists a reviewer in watching a simulated tank battle and developing an AAR to critique the performance of the participants in the battle; (2) an embedded training system and over-the-shoulder coach for howitzer crewmen; and (3) a system to identify various chemical compounds from their infrared absorption spectra.", "title": "Adding intelligent services to an object oriented system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950013226, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Robideaux, Bret R."}, "organization": {"name": "LB and M Associates, Inc.", "location": "Lawton, OK, United States"}}, "id": "730becdbaac3472aa30daf9e79b2c0bf"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950013226, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Metzler, Theodore A."}, "organization": {"name": "LB and M Associates, Inc.", "location": "Lawton, OK, United States"}}, "id": "332f055db8b8494c8fea812fba4385c6"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950013226, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950013226, "id": "6d12bd3d12a344d3a7a35edbc44dfd32", "publicationName": "NASA.
