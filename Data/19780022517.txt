Tests showed that the combination 0.\xe2\x80\x99 the selected \xe2\x80\x98&neb and the\ndesigned corporate feed will meet the SIR-A performance requirement of 33 dB gain.\nThe effects of Orbiter structure proximity on performance were determined by scale\nmodel tests to be negligible. The potential for improved performance during\nsubsequent reflights includes a multiple-beam capability and dual pokrization.\n1.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA study was conducted to define the concept and preliminary design of the SIR-A\nantenna. Operational Flight Test Number 2 (9FT-2) is the first mission to include\nscientific experiments in the payload bay and SlR-A is the highest priority experiment\napproved for flight. It is presently scheduled for flight during the second half of 1979.\nThe primary consideration of the study was to provide the concepts for the antenna,\nsupporting structure, and corporate feed at the lowest possible cost, while meeting the\nperformance requirements and Orbiter interface requirements. The antenna was\nconstrained to fit in the area forward of the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI)\nwithout protruding from the payload bay envelope. The antenna points to the north\nside of the orbital track while the Orbiter flies with the payload bay opening facing the\nearth. This orieqtation is intended to thermally quulify the Orbiter to fly in this\nattitude for long durations. Results of the study included definition of the location in\nthe payload bay, selection of antenna panels, design and selection of the corporate\n\nfeed, design of supporting structure, and performance projections. The study has been\nfollowed by a program of detailed design, manufacturing, and test of the system.\n2.0\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nThe SIH-A antenna design relies heavily upon previous SEASAT technology and the\nutilization of standard components in an ..*fort to minimize cost and risk factors while\nIV-2-1\n\noptlmiziq system performenee.\nSeven honeycomb miaostrip antenna paneb,\nidentical to tha panel ae~eropea tested for the SWAT Bngineering MW unit\nand\n(SMU), are arrayed to form a 9.38m x 2.08111planer, longitudinally polarized, rt?diating\n8Vfqtce. A unique coaxial corporate feed distributes power to each panel in-phase, but\nwith a stepped amplitude taper such that the center three panels each radiate onesixth of the total power and the outer four panels each one-eighth. Power to each\nradiate petch on the panel is carried by a microstrip feedline network etched on the\nfacq of the panel.\n\nThe antenna panels and corparate feed, as shown in Figure 1, are mechanically\nslpp#ted and aligned to a planar surface by a fixed stm@ac& truss. An installation\ntcm. with adjustable fittings to the OFT4 spacelab-hybrid pallet, supports the\nmtcrma/stranebad< in a fired high-in-thepeyload bay location and allows vernier\naajtgtment of the antenna boresight pointing angle to 47 degrees from nadir.\nInitial truss collcepfs were constructed with graphite epoxy material, but reduction in\nthe pallet-mounted, structural fundamental frequency requirements has permitted the\nuse of less costfy, aluminum trusswork. With either material, thermal and mechanical\ndistortions of the truss structure are sufficiently small to cause the array to deviate\nless than +0.635cm from a planar surface during on-orbit operations. Multilayer aluminized mylar on the trusswork and teflon-impregnated quartz cloth on the radiating\npanels provide passive thermal control. The multilayer insulation i covered y i t h the\ns\nquartz cloth to reduce the surface reflectivity, thus avoiding potential glare to the\n\n-\n\nCRW.\n\n3.0\n\nANTENNA PANELS\n\nThe 1.34m x 2.08m EMU panel combines microstrip array techniques with amique\nfiberglass honeycomb construction [ 1J to yield an efficient, lightweight, monolithic\nantenna. All radiating elements and feedlines are precision photo-etched on a copper\nlaminate and supported above a bonded capper ground plane by the honeycomb structure, thus significantly reducing dielectric losses. The complete EMU array is\nillustrated in Figure 2, with nominal measured performance for individual panels\ntabulated below. L w development and manufacturing costs, rugged construction, and\no\nadequate performance made the EMU design particularly attractive for application to\nthe SIR-A antenna. Only minor attachment fitting modifications have been made in\nthis SEAS-4T design for the SIR-A program.\n\nIV-2-2\n\ne\n\nY\n\nQ:\n\nw\n\nz-\n\n8\n\nN\nL\n\nD\nh\nY\n\nw\nw\n\nLL\n\nv)\nv)\n\n3\n\na\nI\n-\n\nt;;\n\n\\\n\nIV-2-3\n\n\\\n\nTABLE 1\nEMU PANEL CHARACTERISTICS\nPERFORMANCE\n25.9 dB\n\nPARAMETER\nGain\nSidelobes\nE-Plane\nH Plane\nBeam w idth\nE-Plane\nH-Plane\nVSWR\n\n(-12.5 dB\n(-16.0 dB\n\n-\n\n4.0\n\n9 . lo\n6.20\nc\n\n1.3:l\n\nCORPORATE FEED\n\nA seven-way corporate feed, composed of standard air-loaded coaxial line and reactive\npower dividers, efficiently distributes power to the array panels and implements the\nreguired phase and amplitude distribution. As depicted in Figure 3, t h e power divider\nconfiguration theoretically yields a\namplitude taper across the array. If\n\nrequired, minor power distribution variations due to load mismatches in the reactive\nnetwork can be compensated by modifying the power split of the first reactive divider,\nthe only nonstandard electrical component. Equal phase illumination is ensured by\ntrimming similar lines to equivalent electrical lengtb and critically phasing the 127\ninch line.)shown in Figure 3, such that the electrical length from input to panel\nterminations is equivalent for all ports. Multipcctor breakdown considerations dictate\nthe use of TNC-type connectors an& dielectrically loaded power dividers. A 3 dB\nmultipactor margin is maintained throughout the system. Based on vendor data,\nsystem insertion is calculated as less than 0.7 dR.\nA prototype SIR-- feed system composed of Andrews H5550 7/8" coaxial cable with\n\nN-type connectors and Microlab DZTN power dividers was constructed and tested\nduring this study in order to establish confidence in the proposed design. The feed\nexhibited good control over the amplitude distribution and total system insertion loss\nwas 0.3 dB vith input VSWR less than 1.15 < 1. Theoretical insertion loss for the\nprctotype system was 0.2 ,\' dB.\n\n50\n.\n\nSYSTE C PERFORMANCE\n~\n\n~~\n\n~\n\nProjected nominal performance of the SIR-A antenna is shown in Table 2. When the\narray of seven EMU panels is uniformly illuminated, the E-Plane beamwidth (-8 dB) is\nIV-2-5\n\n\\\n\nQ\n\n5\n\nIV-2-6\n\ntheoretically 1.Y9 degrees with 13 dB sidelobes, but the amplitude taper implemented\nby the corporate feed increases this beamwidth to 2.07 degrees and potentially reduces\nsidelobes to -15.2 dB. Array distortions, and particularly phase damplitude errors in\nthe feed, rill cause deviations from these nominal values [2 1.\n\nThe panel gain (25.9 a i ) , plus the seven4ement array factor gain of 8.45 dB, yields a\ntheoretical 34.35 dBi gain for the SIR-A antenna array; however, several nominal\ndirectivity arrd efficiency losses must be corrsidered (Table 2).\n\nTABLE 2\nDIRECTiVITY AND EFFICIENCY LOSSES\n\nE-Plane Taper\nFeed Network\n\n.\n-0 .\n70\n-0 .\n08\n-0 02\n\nMechanical Distortions\n\nFeed Phese and Amplitude Errors\nThermal Blanket\nFrequency and Temperature Effects\nN E T LOSS\n\n-0.13\n\n-G. 05\n-0.2\n-1. 18\n\nThw, the nominal projected gain of the seren-panel SIR-A antenna array i 33.17 dBL\ns\n\nDue to the proximity of the SIR-A antenna to potential reflecting surfaces within the\nShuttle payload bay, a 1/10 scale model radiation pattern test at 12.75 GHz *as\nconducted to assess the impact of the Shuttle structural surfaces on the SIR-A antenna\nperformance. The test configuration is depicted in Figure 4. This figure shows the\nantenna in a scale model payload bey with the DFI pallet installed. The Orbiter\nradiator panel on the side of the bay is also mocked up. Radiation patterns with the\nn\n.antenna mounted high i the bay, as in Figure 1, indicated no measurable bearnwidth\nvariation from free space conditions and only a minor increase (0.8 dB) in one H-Plane\nsidelobe. Shuttle structural surfaces will not adversely affect SIR - A performance.\n6.0\n\nPOTENTIAL FGR IMPROVEMENT\n\nBecause the SIR-A experiment remains inside the Shuttle vehicle and returns to earth,\nthe potential for evolution in system configuration during subsequent reflights is\npossible. Probablt reflights, as yet unscheduled, will provide greater ground coverage\nthan i possible during t h e S-day OFT-2 Mission. Improvements in performance could\ns\nbe achieved, with small additional costs, by adding an H-Plane multiple-beam\ncapability to the antenna. Dual polarization could also be added with some\n\nIV-2-7\n\nmodification to the antenna circuit artand transmitter. The antenna could have\nan on-orbit pointing adjustment capabili. neorporeted. Another improvement would\nbe to fold the antenna so that it occupies approximately the width of one Spacelab\npallet during launch and descent, and deploys over the aft payload bay doors during\noperation. This change would reduce t h e length of payload bay occupied, without\naffectiq Orbiter thermal radiator performance, thus allowing a larger variety and\nnumber of additional other payloads to share t h e mission. In order to accomplish this,\na foldable feed system, as impiemented on the SEASAT SAR antenna and a DoD SAR\nantenna, would be required. Such changes would result in additional scientific data and\nprovide evolutionary improvemen t.\nREFERENCES\n\n7.0\n\ni 1;\n\nBrejcha A. G., Keeler L. G., Sanford G.
