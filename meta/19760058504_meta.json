A guidance logic is developed for this VTOL application, although the results may be applicable to curved approaches by STOL or CTOL aircraft as well. The guidance concept attempts to maintain constant airspeed along a fixed radius nominal spiral. The presence of wind requires a continuous variation in bank angle and heading rate to remain on the desired path. Linear perturbation analysis is used to select satisfactory feedback gains for commanded bank angle, longitudinal acceleration and vertical speed. A wind estimator detects differences between the predicted and observed wind and uses the result to modify the nominal control. For 4-D guidance the nominal time must be computed as a function of turn angle, which requires the solution of an elliptic integral. Time-varying longitudinal accelerations are necessary for 4-D guidance when the observed wind differs from the predicted wind, or when wind shear is present. The logic and the linear feedback gains have been tested in a nonlinear simulation. Results have generally verified the performance predicted by linear analysis.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760058504, "endDate": "1976-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "9e255334c3df43d5bca583cd6126c718", "startDate": "1976-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760058504, "id": "9281a4c03bd84a83a50a18e1ab0bb912", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
