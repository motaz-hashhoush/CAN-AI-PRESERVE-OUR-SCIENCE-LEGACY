A commercial phase array SODAR line was developed and operated at Roissy International Airport for a few days. Some radial wind data are presented. Even though this system was not optimized for such application, it showed ranges of about 800 m for an averaging time of 10 min and an elevation angle of 20 deg. Some strong echo regions are present in the data and seem to be related to wake vortex.", "title": "MEGASODAR experiment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910014856, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Donzier, Alain"}, "organization": {"name": "Remtech", "location": "S.A., Paris, France"}}, "id": "70932fe6078a48b8b4f0f45fefa822b4"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910014856, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910014856, "id": "d1795e5fa38f40589d66acbd24fd3571", "publicationName": "NASA.
