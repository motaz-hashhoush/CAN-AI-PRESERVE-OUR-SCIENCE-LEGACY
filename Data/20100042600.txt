b'n _\t __,\n\nNASA-DoD LEAD-FREE ELECTRONICS PROJECT:\nOVERVIEW\nKurt Kessel\nITB, Inc.\nNASA Technology Evaluation for Environmental Risk Mitigation (TEERM) Principal Center\nKennedy Space Center, FL, USA\nkurt.r.kessel@nasa.gov\n{On behalf of the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project Consortium}\nABSTRACT\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), depots, and\nsupport contractors have to be prepared to deal with an\nelectronics supply chain that increasingly provides parts\nwith lead-free finishes, some labeled no differently and\nintermingled with their SnPb counterparts. Allowance of\nlead-free components presents one of the greatest risks to\nthe reliability of military and aerospace electronics. The\nintroduction of components with lead-free terminations,\ntermination finishes, or circuit boards presents a host of\nconcerns to customers, suppliers, and maintainers of\naerospace and military electronic systems such as:\n1. Electrical shorting due to tin whiskers\n2. Incompatibility of lead-free processes and parameters\n(including higher melting points of lead-free alloys)\nwith other materials in the system\n3. Unknown material properties and incompatibilities that\ncould reduce solder joint reliability\nAs the transition to lead-free becomes a certain reality for\nmilitary and aerospace applications, it will be critical to\nfully understand the implications of reworking lead-free\nassemblies.\nKey words: lead-free, reliability, harsh environments\ntesting, aerospace\nBACKGROUND\nThe NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project builds on\nthe results from the Joint Council on Aging Aircraft/Joint\nGroup on Pollution Prevention (JCAA/JG-PP) Lead-Free\nSolder Project, the first group to test the reliability of leadfree solder joints against the requirements of the aerospace\nand military community, while focusing on the rework of\nSnPb and lead-free solder alloys and includes the mixing of\nSnPb and lead-free solder alloys. The majority, of testing\nbeing conducted for this effort will mirror the testing\ncompleted for JCAA/JGPP LFS Project. Some changes\nwere made in order to optimize the usefulness of the data.\nOBJECTIVE\nIn response to concerns about risks from lead-free induced\nfaults to high reliability products, the NASA-DoD LeadFree Electronics Project Consortium outlined a multi-year\nproject to provide manufacturers and users with data to\n\nclarify the risks of lead-free materials in their products. The\nproject also . provides useful data to component\nmanufacturers supplying to high reliability markets. The\nproject was launched in November 2006. The primary\ntechnical objective of the project is to undertake\ncomprehensive testing to generate data on failure modes /\ncriteria to better understand the reliability of packages (e.g.,\nthin small outline package, ball grid array, plastic (dual\'\ninline package), chip scale package, quad flat pack (no\nleads) assembled and reworked with lead-free alloys and\nwith mixed (lead/lead-free) alloys).\nThe intended goal of this project is to:\n1. Determine the reliability of reworked solder joints in\nhigh-reliably military and aerospace electronics\nassemblies.\n2. Assess the process parameters for reworking highreliability lead-free military and aerospace electronics\nassemblies.\nDevelop baseline recommendations for process guidelines\nand a risk assessment for assembling high-reliability leadfree military and aerospace electronics assemblies.\nPROCEDURES\nTest Vehicle\nThe test vehicle is a printed wiring assembly (PWA),\ndesigned to evaluate solder joint reliability. Test vehicle\nraw boards comply with IPC-6012 (Qualification and\nPerformance Specification for Rigid Printed Boards), Class\n3, Type 3. Test vehicle size is 14.5 X 9 X 0.09 inches with\nsix 0.5-ounce copper layers. The design incorporates\ncomponents representative of the parts used for military and\naerospace systems and is designed to reveal relative\ndifferences in solder alloy performance. A variety of plated\nthrough-hole (PTH) and surface mount technology (SMT)\ncomponents are included. All components are "dummy"\ndevices with pins internally daisy-chained and contain\nsimulated die. The circuit board was designed with daisychained pads that are complementary to the components.\nTherefore, the solder joints on each component will be part\nof a continuous electrical pathway that can be monitored\nduring testing by an event detector (Anatech or equivalent).\nFailure of a solder joint on a component will break the\ncontinuous pathway and be recorded as an event. Each\n\ncomponent has its own distinct pathway (channel). Figure 1\nillustrates the test vehicle design.\n\nFigure 1\n\nTest Vehicle Design\n\nAll test vehicles were assembled using immersion silver\n(Ag) and a limited number of electroless nickel / immersion\ngold (ENIG) finished glass fiber (GF) laminate (IPC4101/26) printed circuit boards with a glass transition\ntemperature, Ts, of 170\xc2\xb0C minimum and categorized as\neither "Manufactured" or "Rework". "Manufactured" test\nvehicles represent printed wiring assemblies newly\nmanufactured for use in new product. Test vehicles being\nsubjected to thermal cycle and combined environments\ntesting will include forward and backward compatibility.\nTest vehicles assembled for vibration and mechanical shock\nwill not include forward and backward compatibility.\n"Rework" test vehicles represent printed wiring assemblies\nmanufactured and reworked prior to being tested. Solder\nmixing will be comprised of forward and backward\ncompatibility:\nI. Forward compatibility is a SnPb component attached to\na printed wiring assembly using lead-free solder with a\nlead-free profile.\n2. Backward compatibility is a lead-free component\nattached to a printed wiring assembly using SnPb solder\nwith a SnPb solder profile.\nIn addition to the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project\ntest vehicles, Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare\nCenter, a NASA-DoD Consortium member, added 30 test\nvehicles to the NASA-DoD project in support of their Naval\nSupply Command (NAVSUP) sponsored "Logistics Impact\nof Lead-Free Circuits/Components" project. The primary\npurpose of the 30 test vehicle add-on was to perform\nmultiple pass SnPb rework I and 2 times on random Pb-free\nDIP, TQFP-144, TSOP-50, LCC and QFN components\nfrom SAC305 and SN l OOC soldered assemblies.\nThe reworked test vehicles will be integrated into the\nNASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project -55\xc2\xb0C to +125\xc2\xb0C\nthermal cycling testing (Rockwell Collins; Cedar Rapids,\nIowa). Drop testing (Celestica; Toronto, Ontario, Canada)\n\nwas run as an identical parallel test to minimize variation\nbetween the NASA-DoD and Crane test data. Celestica\n(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) also performed the vibration\ntesting for the Crane test vehicles.\nThe goal of the Crane test vehicle effort is to generate initial\ndata supporting the qualification of existing SnPb rework\nprocedures for all military hardware built with lead-free\nprocesses through analysis of thermal cycling, vibration, and\ndrop test data, with subsequent microsection analysis.\nQuestions to be answered by the Crane testing effort\ninclude:\n1. What effect does X 1 and X2 rework have on assembly\nreliability as tested by thermal cycle, vibration, and\ndrop testing?\n2. Are lead-free assemblies reworked with SnPb as\nreliable as as-built lead-free hardware?\n3. How do residual Pb-free solder contamination levels in\nSnPb joints after XI and X2 rework correlate to\nreliability?\n4. What effect does X1 and X2 SnPb rework have on\nsurface mount land thickness (copper erosion) by cross\nsection?\n5. Observed visual evidence of X and X2 rework damage\nto 170Tg laminate?\nAll test results from the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics\nProject and Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center\neffort will be made publicly available on the NASA\nTEERM website [ I ].\nTest Components\n\nA variety of component types and component finishes were\nincluded on the test vehicle. The CLCC and TSOP\ncomponent types were selected due to industry\nacknowledged solder joint integrity issues in Class 111 High\nPerformance electronic products. The DIP components were\nselected to represent plated through-hole technology. The\nPLCC, TQFPs BGAs, CSPs and QFNs (MLF) were selected\nto represent surface mount technology.

A detailed description of the\nspecific tin/lead and lead-free soldering processes was\ndetailed in the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project\nPlan [2].\nThe lead-free solder alloys selected for this project were:\n1.

In\norder to get the rework procedures completed in a timely\nmanner, multiple facilities performed the rework activities\n(BAE Systems; Irving, Texas, Lockheed Martin; Ocala,\nFlorida, and Rockwell Collins; Cedar Rapids, Iowa).\n\nSolder Process\nReflow\nWave\nManual\nX\nSAC305\nN/A\nX\nX\nSN1000\nX\nX\nSnPb baseline\nX\nX\nX\nTable 2 Solder Alloys and Processes\n{N/A = Due to limitations on board numbers and\ncomponents, these solder alloys were not used during the\nnoted assembly processes)\nSolder Alloy\n\nTest vehicles were assembled using these solders and a\nvariety of component types. The following harsh\nenvironment testing was then conducted:\n1. Vibration (Boeing; Seattle, Washington and Celestica;\nToronto, Ontario, Canada)\n2. Thermal Cycle -20 to +80\xc2\xb0C (Boeing; Seattle,\nWashington) and -55 to +125\xc2\xb0C (Rockwell Collins;\nCedar Rapids, Iowa)\nEnvironments\t\n3.

Copper Dissolution (Celestica; Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada and Rockwell Collins; Cedar Rapids,.Iowa)\n\nComponents reworked were grouped by rework solder alloy\n/ material (SnPb, Flux only, SAC305 and SN 1000). The\nlocation performing the rework chose what order to rework\nthe solder alloy / material groups, but had to use the\nnumbered order below for specific component locations\nwithin the solder alloy / material group. When reworking a\ncomponent, the component was to be removed and replaced\nbefore moving to the next component. All details regarding\nthe rework procedure, including temperature profiles, are\ncontained in the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project\nPlan.\nThermal Aging\nThe project consortia members desired to have the test\nvehicles begin the various testing procedures with a\ncommon starting state point . in an effort to eliminate\npotential assembly differences which could possibly\ninadvertently/unintentionally influence the testing results.\nThe project consortia members reviewed intermetallic\ncalculations generated by Rockwell Collins and compared\nthe calculations to data sets from the Center for Advanced\nVehicle Electronics (CAVE) at Auburn University, the\nNational Physics Laboratory (NPL), the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (KIST), and the Center for\n\nAdvanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at University\nof Maryland.\nThe thermal aging procedure was selected to establish a\ncommon, standard starting point such that all test vehicles\nwere relatively equal in terms of solder joint microstructure,\nprinted wiring board stress state, surface finish oxidation\ncondition, and intermetallic phase formation/thickness. The\nthermal aging procedure is not necessarily, nor intended to\nbe, representative of the various burn-in, bake-out, or other\nenvironmental stress screening (ESS) procedures that are\nused to evaluate electronics hardware quality/functionality.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that the thermal aging\nprocedure being used by the NASA-DoD LFE Project\nconsortia is not meant to be representative of operational\nfield life.\nAssembly Irregularities\nWith all of the complexities built into the NASA-DoD\nLead-Free Electronics Project design of experiment, test\nvehicle irregularities were bound to occur.\nWhen reviewing the CSP data, please note that the CSP\ncomponents on all test vehicles only have continuity in the\noutside solder balls. The wrong component configuration\nwas used during test vehicle drafting. Traces\ninterconnecting internal rows of balls to the outside row of\nballs do not exist on the test vehicles, Figure 2\n\nY I\'~11I\t I\nF,00\n...

The next step was to select test\nmethods recognized and agreed upon by the technical team\nmembers. A key factor was selecting test parameters that\nwould subject enough environmental stress to cause solder\njoints to fail, thus permitting differentiation between lead vs.\nlead-free performance. Military document MIL-STD-81OF\n[3] and industry documents IPC-SM-785 [4] and IPC-TM650 [5] were primary references used for writing the test\nplan. One test\xe2\x80\x94the Combined Environments test\xe2\x80\x94\nfollowed a procedure developed and used by Raytheon.\nVibration ( Boeing; Seattle, Washington and Celestica;\nToronto, Ontario, Canada)\nThe vibration test was conducted at two separate locations.\nThe NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics Project test vehicles\nwere tested at Boeing while the Crane Division test vehicles\nwere tested at Celestica.\nThe vibration test determines solder joint failures during\nexposure to vibration conditions. The stakeholders agreed\nthat MIL-STD-810F, Method 514.5 (Vibration), would be\nthe starting point for developing a vibration test that would\ndetermine the reliability of the various solder alloys under\nsevere vibration. Specific details on the vibration test can\nbe found in the Joint Test Protocol [6].\n\nThe stakeholders agreed that a stress step test representing\nincreasingly severe vibration environments was appropriate\nfor this test, see Figure 4. A step stress test is required since\na test conducted at a constant 8.0 g,,,,, level (Step 1) would\ntake thousands of hours to fail the same number of\ncomponents as a step stress test. This is because some\nlocations on a circuit assembly experience very low stresses\nand severe vibration is required in order to fail components\nat these locations. The shape of the PSD (Power Spectral\nDensity) curve for each step stress level was designed so\nthat all of the major resonances of the test vehicles would be\nexcited by the random vibration input. The PSD curves\npresented in MIL-STD-810F were used as guides for the\ncreation of this step stress test but were not directly\nduplicated.\n\njoints. In order to maximize the effects of solder alloy\ncreep, a 30-minute high temperature dwell will be used for\nthis project.\n\nFigure 5 Test Vehicles in the Thermal Cycle Chamber\n\na^\n\nnom I\n\no\t\n\n,00\t\n\nI=\t\n\nI=\n\nF requemy (HZ)\n\nFigure 4 Vibration Spectrum\nThermal Cycle -20 to +80\xc2\xb0C (Boeing; Seattle,\nWashington) and -55 to +125e C ( Rockwell Collins;\nCedar Rapids, Iowa)\nThe thermal cycle testing determines the capability of a\nsolder to withstand extreme thermal cycling. This test will\nbe performed in accordance with IPC-SM-785. Figure 5\nillustrates the test vehicles loaded into the -55 to +125\xc2\xb0C test\nchamber.\nThermal cycling will be conducted at two different\nconditions, -20 to +80\xc2\xb0C and -55 to +125\xc2\xb0C, technical\nrepresentatives from the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile\nCommand (AMCOM) suggested two temperature ranges to\nallow for acceleration factors to be determined, which will\npermit extrapolation of the data to actual use conditions of\ntheir systems. The thermal cycle tests were run until a\nsignificant number (greater than 63 percent) of component\nfailures were achieved in order to provide statistically\nmeaningful data. Specific details on the thermal cycle test\ncan be found in the Joint Test Protocol.\nAfter examining the available data on dwell time effect, the\nlead-free solder project participants agreed that the high-\n\ntemperature dwell time would be 30 minutes. Solder alloy\ncreep during the high temperature dwell of the thermal\ncycle is largely responsible for damage within the solder\n\nCombined Environments Testing ( Raytheon; McKinney,\nTexas)\nThe Combined Environments Test (CET) determines the\nreliability of solders under combined thermal cycle and\nvibration. The CET for the NASA-DoD Lead-Free\nElectronics Project is based on a modified Highly\nAccelerated Life Test (HALT), a process in which products\nare subjected to accelerated environments to find weak links\nin the design and/or manufacturing process. The project\nstakeholders felt that the CET would provide a quick\nmethod to identify comparative potential reliability\ndifferences in the test alloys vs. the SnPb baseline. The\nprimary accelerated environments are temperature extremes\n(both limits and rate of change) and vibration (pseudorandom six degrees of freedom used in combination).\nSpecific details on the combined environments test can be\nfound in the Joint Test Protocol.\nThis test utilized a temperature range of \xe2\x80\x9455 to 125\xc2\xb0C with\n20\xc2\xb0C/minute ramps. The dwell times at each temperature\nextreme are the times required to stabilize the test sample\nplus a 15-minute soak. 10 gr,,,, pseudo-random vibration was\napplied for the duration of the thermal cycle. Testing\ncontinued until sufficient data was generated to obtain\nstatistically significant Weibull plots indicating relative\nsolder joint endurance (cycles to failure) rates. If significant\nfailure rates were not evidenced after 50 cycles, the\nvibration levels were increased in increments of 5 grrn, and\ncycling continued for an additional 50 cycles. This process\nwas repeated until all parts failed or 55 g,, n, was reached.\nFigure 6 illustrates the test vehicles loaded into the\nHALT/HASS Chamber.\n\n\t\n\n1000.0\n\xe2\x80\x94Level 6\n\n-- Leve15\n100.0\t\n\n-\t\n\n-\t\n\n---\n\n(!\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Level J\n\nv\n\n2\n\ny\t\nE\t\nQ\t\n\n-- ModRletl Clash\nHazard (Ground Eq.l\n10.0\n\xe2\x80\x94ModRled Functional\nTest I Ground Eq. l\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Modfied Functional\nTest I FYght E q.l\n1.0\n0\t\n\n200\t\n\n400\t\n\n600\t\n\n600\t\n\n1000\n\nFrequency (HZ I\n\nFigure 6 Test Vehicles in the HALT/HASS Chamber\n\nFigure 7 Mechanical Shock SRS Test Levels\n\nMechanical Shock (Boeing; Seattle, Washington)\nThe purpose of the mechanical shock test is to determine the\nresistance of the solder to the stresses associated with highintensity shocks induced by rough handling, transportation,\nor field operation. The mechanical shock test procedure\nwas changed from the procedure used for the JCAA/JGPP\nLead-Free Solder Project. The consortia members felt that\nthe procedure change was necessary since it is very difficult\nto meet both the SRS shape and the pulse duration for this\ntest as outlined in MIL-STD-810F. Pulse duration is\napproximately equal to the inverse of lowest SRS frequency,\n10 Hz. SRS requirement means pulse duration >100 msec\nwhile MIL-STD-810F outlines pulse durations < 23 msec.\nSpecific details on the mechanical shock test can be found\nin the Joint Test Protocol.\n\nDrop (Celestica; Toronto, Ontario, Canada)\nThis test determines the resistance of board level\ninterconnects to board strain induced by dynamic bending as\na result of drop testing. Boards tested using this method\ntypically fail either as interfacial fractures in the solder joint\n(most common with ENIG) or as pad cratering in the\ncomponent substrate and/or board laminate. These failure\nmodes commonly occur during manufacturing, electrical\ntesting (especially in-circuit test), card handling and field\ninstallation. The root cause of these types of failures is\ntypically a combination of excessive applied strain due to\nprocess issues and/or weak interconnects due to process\nissues and/or the quality of incoming components and/or\nboards. Specific details on the drop test can be found in the\nJoint Test Protocol. Figure 8 illustrates the test vehicles\nloaded onto the drop test fixture.\n\nTesting followed MIL-STD-810F, Method 516.5 with the\nfollowing modifications: (1)100 shocks were applied per\ntest level (rather than 3) and all of the shocks were applied\nin the Z-axis, and (2) the shock transients applied at the\nlevels specified in MIL-STD-810F, Method 516.5 for the\nFunctional Test for Flight Equipment, the Functional Test\nfor Ground Equipment, and the Crash Hazard Test for\nGround Equipment followed modified parameters detailed\nin the Joint Test Protocol. An additional step stress test will\nthen be conducted (see Figure 7) with the shocks being\napplied in the Z-axis only. For Level 6 (300 G\'s), 400\nshocks will be applied instead of 100. Testing continued\nuntil a majority (approximately 63 percent) of components\nwas failed.\n\n111M\n\nFigure 8 Test Vehicles on the Drop Test Fixture\n\nInterconnect Stress Test (PWB Interconnect Solutions\nInc.; Nepean, Ontario, Canada)\nInterconnect Stress Test (IST) is an industry recognized test\nmethod (IPC) that accelerates thermal cycling testing by\nheating a specifically designed test coupon to 150\xc2\xb0C in\nexactly 3 minutes followed by cooling to ambient in\napproximately two minutes. IST test coupons have two\ncircuits, a sense circuit and a power circuit, to monitor\n\nmaterial delamination and crazing. The power circuit heats\nthe coupon. The sense circuit is a passive circuit that\nmonitors temperature and measures damage accumulation\nof the interconnect structure, typically a plated through-hole\n(PTH). There are usually 400 to 800 structures per circuit to\nachieve a higher, statistically relevant, sample size. Both the\npower and sense circuits change in resistance (milliohms)\nand temperature (\xc2\xb0C) throughout the coupons during the\nthermal cycle. Thermal cycling continues until end of test\nor a 10% increase in resistance on either circuit. Each\ncoupon is heated, monitored, and tested individually. This\ngives a number of advantages that include no hold time at\ntemperature, tight test control in the ability to achieve any\ntest temperature in three minutes +/- 5 seconds, the ability to\nstop testing within seconds of the circuit achieving a 10%\nincrease in resistance allowing analysis of a developing\nfailure rather than a catastrophic failure. Testing stops\nimmediately when the circuit achieves 10% increase in\nresistance, allowing a failed circuit to have a low amount of\npower applied that creates a hot spot at the failure site\nvisible by a thermal imaging camera. Specific details on\nIST can be found in the Joint Test Protocol.\nCopper Dissolution (Celestica; Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada and Rockwell Collins; Cedar Rapids, Iowa)\nThe purpose of the copper dissolution testing is to\ncharacterize, document, and compare the impact of\nsoldering process on the copper plated through-hole and\nsurface pad structures for the NASA-DoD test vehicles with\nthe SAC305 and SN100C solder alloy systems. The copper\ndissolution test results will provide a data set which can be\nused as a first order approximation of the copper plating\nthickness loss due to lead-free solder processing.\nAdditionally, the copper dissolution test results can be\ncompared to other published industry results for alternative\nsolder alloy systems and different soldering processes.\nPrinted Circuit Board (PCB) and plated through-holes can\nbe eroded or dissolved away in the presence of molten\nsolder rendering the PCB non-functional. Significant\ndissolution can occur with the use of certain new Sn-rich\nalloys and is further exacerbated by higher process\ntemperatures. Clearly this phenomenon represents a serious\nrisk. to circuit reliability. There is a clear need to determine\nthe dissolution rate of copper pads with lead-free solders\nunder various conditions.\t\nSpecific details on copper\ndissolution can be found in the Joint Test Protocol.\nTEST RESULTS\nAt the time this document was drafted, only a portion of the\ntesting activities had been completed. For the testing\nactivities that were complete, failure analysis activities were\nongoing or in the planning stages. All test reports will be\nmade available on the NASA TEERM website.\nDISCUSSION\nBased on the work that has been completed to date,\nassembly of high-performance electronics using lead-free\n\nsolder alloys is possible without a total retrofit of the\nfactory.\nSome control of equipment is necessary to eliminate , the\ncross contamination of lead-free and SnPb solder alloys to\nensure optimal reliability for some component types.\nSignificant resources will be required for component\nconfiguration management to assure that incompatible\nmetallurgies are not mixed in the factory. The huge\npotential for mixed components from suppliers will drive\nvalidation and inspection costs throughout the factory.\nFUTURE WORK\nFor the testing activities that have been completed, failure\nanalysis activities are schedule to be conducted later this\nyear.\nThe thermal cycle testing (-20 to +80\xc2\xb0C and -55 to +125\xc2\xb0C)\nwas on going at the time this paper was drafted. -55 to\n+125\xc2\xb0C testing is expected to be completed over the summer\nwith data and failure analysis to be completed later in the\nyear. It is unknown when the -20 to +80\xc2\xb0C testing will be\ncomplete.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Lety Campuzano-Contreras\nof BAE Systems; Dr. Tom Woodrow of Boeing; Dave\nHillman of Rockwell Collins; Cynthia Garcia and Jeff\nBradford of Raytheon; Dr. Polina Snugovsky, Jason Bragg,\nand Jeff Kennedy of Celestica; Linda Woody and Ed Morris\nof Lockheed Martin; Paul Reid and Bill Birch of PWB\nInterconnect Solutions Inc; Jim Blanche of Jacobs\nEngineering; Vance Anderson of Defense Microelectronics\nActivity; Andy Ganster and Gary Latta of Crane Division,\nNaval Surface Warfare Center and David Amidei and\nChuck Griffin of NASA.\nThe author would also like to acknowledge the other\nmembers of the NASA-DoD Lead-Free Electronics\nConsortium not mentioned by name.

This is especially true with reworked\nlead-free CSP-1 00, reworked lead-free BGA-225\n\nCombine Environments Testing\nFrom this testing, it appears the selection of component type and lead-free\nsolder combinations should be considered critical factors when considering\nconverting to lead-free solder assembly, especially for surface mount\ntechnology design configurations.\nBoa rd Finish\n\nFin ish\n\nManufactured\nTest Vehicles\n\nSAC405\nIm.
