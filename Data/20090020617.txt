Another feature involves a\nhigh-voltage printed-wiring board that\nwas corona-free at \xe2\x80\x9320 kV DC with a 3kV AC swing. The corona-free multilayer high-voltage board is used to simulate fields of less than 200 V/mil\n(\xe2\x89\x887.87 kV/mm) at 20 kV DC. Drive\ntechniques for the modulator FETs\n(field-effect transistors) (four to 10 in a\nseries) were created to change states\n(3,000-V swing) without abrupt steps,\nwhile still maintaining required delays\nand transition times. The packing\nscheme includes a potting mold to\nhouse a ten-stage modulator in the\nspace that, in the past, only housed a\nfour-stage modulator.\nProblems keeping heat down were\nsolved using aluminum oxide substrate\nin the high-voltage section to limit temperature rise to less than 10\xc2\xb0 while withstanding \xe2\x80\x9320 kV DC voltage and remaining corona-free.\nThis work was done by Johnny Duong, Scot\nStride, Wayne Harvey, Inam Haque, Newton\nPackard, Quintin Ng, and Julie Y.

This is the first\ntime that an airborne temperature profiler has been used to measure the mixing layer height. Normally, this is done\nusing a radar wind profiler, which is\nboth noisy and large.\nThe MTP was deployed during the\nTexas 2000 Air Quality Study (TexAQS2000). An objective technique was developed and tested for estimating the ML\nheight from the MTP vertical temperature profiles. In order to calibrate the\ntechnique and evaluate the usefulness of\nthis approach, estimates from a variety of\nmeasurements during the TexAQS-2000\nwere compared. Estimates of ML height\nwere used from radiosondes, radar wind\nprofilers, an aerosol backscatter lidar,\nand in-situ aircraft measurements in addition to those from the MTP.\nRelative to the benchmark radiosonde\nestimates, radar wind profiler ML height\nestimates were nearly bias-free. Airborne\nlidar and profiler estimates generally were\nin good agreement inland, but spatial gradients of ML heights made comparisons\ndifficult near the coast. The presence of a\nresidual layer above the sea breeze was\nprobably responsible for a gross overestimate of ML height by lidar in a few instances. The accuracy of the MTP-based\nML height estimates is similar to that of\nother techniques for estimating ML\nheight. The airborne MTP thus shows\n\npromise for measuring the spatial distribution of ML structure, especially in\ncoastal environments where aerosol lidars\nmay have difficulty identifying the ML.\nThis work was done by John Nielson-Gammon and Christina Powell of Texas A&M\nUniversity; Michael Mahoney of Caltech;\nand Wayne Angevine of CIRES for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

NPO43887\n\nMultiple-Cone Sunshade for\na Spaceborne Telescope\nA document describes a sunshade assembly for the spaceborne telescope of\nthe Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph mission. During operation, the telescope is aimed at target stars in the semihemisphere away from the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Sun.\nThe observatory rotates about its pointing axis during a single star observation,\nresulting in relative movement of the\nSun. The sunshade assembly protects the\ntelescope against excessive solar-induced\nthermal distortions for times long\nenough to complete observations.\nThe assembly includes a cylindrical baffle immediately surrounding the telescope, and a series of coaxial conical\nshields at half-cone angle increments of\nbetween 3\xc2\xba and 6\xc2\xba. The black inner surface of the cylindrical baffle suppresses\nstray light. The outer surface of the cylindrical baffle and all the surfaces of the\nconical shields except the outermost one\nare specular and highly reflective in the infrared. The outer surface of the outer\nshield is a material with low solar absorptance and high infrared emittance, such as\nsilverized Teflon or white paint. This\narrangement strongly radiatively couples\neach shield layer more effectively to cold\nspace than to adjacent shield layers. The\nresult is that the solar-driven temperature\ngradients in the cylindrical baffle are\nnearly negated, and only weakly communicated to the highly-infrared-reflective\nface of the primary telescope mirror.\nThis work was done by Terry Cafferty of TC\nTechnology and Virginia Ford of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
