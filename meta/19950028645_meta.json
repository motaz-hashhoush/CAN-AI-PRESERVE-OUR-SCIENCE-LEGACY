The theoretical and observational foundations for this development are reviewed in this paper. By now, the basic physics governing cloud collapse is well understood, as is the structure of the resulting protostars. However, the theory predicts protostellar luminosities that are greater than those of most infrared sources. Observationally, it is thought that protostars emit powerful winds that push away remnant cloud gas, but both the origin of these winds and the nature of their interaction with ambient gas are controversial. Finally, the theory of pre-main-sequence stars has been modified to incorporate more realistic initial conditions. This improvement helps to explain the distribution of such stars in the H-R diagram. Many important issues, such as the origin of binary stars and stellar clusters, remain as challenges for future research.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "106", "submissionId": 19950028645, "issue": "698", "issn": "0004-6280", "id": "bd0d78a0f95a46b5891736a8fa6cae4f", "publicationName": "Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific", "publicationDate": "1994-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
