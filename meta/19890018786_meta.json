The approach to advance the understanding in this area is as follows: (1) Conduct rigorous theoretical studies of the ocean surface wave dynamics and statistical properties; (2) Conduct process-oriented laboratory experiments to verify the theoretical results, and to provide guidance for further studies; and (3) Prepare testable hypotheses for field verifications and comparisons during the ONR/NASA sponsored Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE). An analytic model was established for wave breaking probability to study the influence of wave breaking on the spectrum shape in both deep and finite-depth waters. The spectrum was processed along with the structures of the water surface under the influence of wind and existing waves.", "title": "Microscale ocean dynamics", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T00:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890018786, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Huang, N."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "f5e5b067d8d6409ea06d636c93b80b43"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890018786, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890018786, "id": "0cb90f74d67e404d9931379e44e3d42b", "publicationName": "Laboratory for Oceans", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890018786.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890018786/downloads/19890018786.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890018786/downloads/19890018786.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890018786/downloads/19890018786.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
