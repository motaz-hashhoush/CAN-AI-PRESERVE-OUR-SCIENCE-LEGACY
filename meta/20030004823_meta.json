Winglets are lifting surfaces designed to operate in the \"vortex\" or air whirlpool which occurs at an airplane's wingtip. Complex flow of air around wingtip creates drag which retards the plane's progress. Winglet reduces strength of vortex and thereby reduces strength of drag. Additionally, winglet generates its own lift, producing forward thrust in the manner of a boat's sail. Combination of reduced drag and additional thrust adds up to significant improvement in fuel efficiency.", "title": "Longhorn Business Jets", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030004823, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030004823, "id": "e8ba9d182e14497bbf8d170e5ba9c90f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1980", "publicationDate": "1980-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030004823.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030004823/downloads/20030004823.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030004823/downloads/20030004823.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030004823/downloads/20030004823.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
