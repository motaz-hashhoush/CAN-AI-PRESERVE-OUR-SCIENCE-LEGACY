Mission reports for the first three Shuttle Orbiter flights discuss all anomalies which occurred and their resolution, such as the solid rocket booster ignition overpressure spike, and thermal tile damage. Two emergency rescue systems for orbiting space stations are proposed: a dish type rescue capsule and a reusable orbit vehicle. Prebreathing and stage decompression are considered as means of protecting astronauts against decompression effects. The Spacelab Space Sled experiments are described, as is a test program on the assembly of large space structures completed in mid-1981. Finally, collision hazards for space missions are estimated, and operational procedures for minimizing these hazards are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 19820061170, "endDate": "1982-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "9b78adcf028b4c2ba82c3dac623a31a2", "id": "1bb4d96fcfac420292727315fe92684c"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Paris", "id": "9b78adcf028b4c2ba82c3dac623a31a2"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820061170, "id": "4f637d758adf4bb9b2d93c38d5007e46", "publicationDate": "1982-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
