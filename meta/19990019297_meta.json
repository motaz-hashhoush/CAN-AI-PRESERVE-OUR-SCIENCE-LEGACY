First, we prove rigorously that if one species has a competitive advantage over each of the others, then eventually it takes over all the sites in the system. Second, we examine tradeoffs between competition and dispersal distance in a two-species system. Third, we consider a cyclic competitive relationship between three types. In this case, a nonspatial treatment leads to densities that follow neutrally stable cycles or even unstable spiral solutions, while a spatial model yields a stationary distribution with an interesting spatial structure.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "53", "submissionId": 19990019297, "issue": "1", "issn": "0040-5809", "publisher": "Academic Press", "id": "28cf68652e7541668e4233593ee5070a", "publicationName": "Theoretical Population Biology", "publicationDate": "1998-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
