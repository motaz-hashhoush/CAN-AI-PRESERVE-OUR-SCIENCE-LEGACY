The sensor\n1 .0 electron volts)\nincludes a high energy gap (i.e.,\nsemiconductor wafer. Mechanical force is measured by\nemploying a non-centrosymmetric material for the\nsemiconductor. Distortion of the semiconductor by the\nforce creates a contact potential difference (cpd) at the\nsemiconductor surface, and this cpd is determined to\ngive a measure of the force. When such a semiconductor is subjected to illumination with an energy less than\nthe energy gap of the semiconductors, such illumination also creates a cpd at the surfxe. Detection of this\ncpd is employed to sense the illumination itself or, in a\nvariation of the system, to detect a gas. When either il\ngas or light is to be detected and a crystal of a non-centrosymmetric material is employed, the presence of gas\nor light, in appropriate circumstances, results in a strain\nwithin the crystal which distorts the same and the distortion provides a mechanism for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the gas or the light, as the case\nmay be.\n\nAppl.

During bend..\ning the distance between the central part of the wafer\nand the reference electrodes remained constant. The l o\nstrain induced by bending was measured with strain\ngauges attached to the wafer surface.\nTypical cpd transients resulting from bending and\nunbending of a (00.1) wafer are shown in FIG. 4B. 15\nThey are analogous to field effect transients. They were\nperfectly reproducible and reversible after the initial\nbending-unbending cycle, which is not shown here.\nDuring the initial bending the decrease in the surface\nbarrier (increase in cpd) stimulates filling of the surface states since their occupation is below the equilibrium value. Upon unbending this increased (equilibrium) occupation of the surface states is clearly manifested as a decrease in the steady state cpd (an increase 25\nin the surface barrier). No further change in the steady\nstate occupation of the surface states (in the unbent\ncondition) takes place in subsequent bending-unbending cycles. Accordingly, the present results represent\nthe cpd transients after the initial bending-unbending 30\ncycle. The cpd transients of FIG. 4B correspond to\nstress-induced discharging and charging of the surface\nstates.\nThe dependence of the cpd on the radius of bending\nand on the induced strain at the surface are shown in 35\nFIG. 4D for the (00.11, Cd, and (00.11, sulfur, surfaces\nat two steady state values of the surface barrier height\nlabeled V,O. ]It is seen that bending induces a polarization (a change in surface barrier height) which is of\nopposite sign in the two types of surfaces. This result 40\nconfirms the peizoelectric nature of the present effect.\nThe two steady state values of V,O shown in FIG. 4D\ncorrespond to two different ambients: room atmosphere (higher value of I V," I ) and vacuum of about\n104 torr (lower value of I V?I 1 The sensitivity of the 45\n.\npresent effect on the surface barrier height indicates\nthat it is primarily a surface effect with no appreciable\ncontributions from stress-induced bulk effects. Consistent with this conclusion, it was found that the magni- 50\ntude of the effect decreased by lowering the surface\nbarrier height with white light illumination; in fact the\neffect could no longer be observed when a flat band\ncondition was reached under white light illumination.\nA model will now be outlined for explaining the pre- 55\nsent results. According to the piezoelectric characteristics of CdS, mechanical bending of an (00.1) wafer\nabout the [OlO] axis induces polarization P3 in the\n[OOI J direction:\n\n6\nui=\n\n(2)\n\nC*\xe2\x82\xacl,\n\nwhere c * is the elastic stiffness; its value calculated for\nthe present bending configuration is 5.6 X 1 0 \' O N/m2.\nA macroscopic manifestation of the polarization in\neq. ( 1 is not possible in the bulk since the carrier\nconcentration is high (n,+Oi6/Cm3) and their redistribution shorts out the polarization. However, in the\ndepleted surface regon where the free carrier cmcentration is essentially zero, polarization P3 Can be readily\nmanifested macroscopically. Assuming that, upon\nbending (at time\nthe observed changes in CPd at\nt=o+ are not shielded by the surface states and that a\nSchottky-type surface barrier is present, then it can be\nshown that the system at hand can be described by the\nfollowing set of one-dimensional equations:\n\nS D J S X ~ pdEJ&. ==\n\nI AD,I surface = Q\n\nE3.\n\n~ ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere 0, is electric displacement; E is the dielectric\nconstant; eo is the permitivity of free space; Ea is the\nelectric field; p is the charge density; V is the potential\nbarrier; Qapis the surface state charge density.\nFor V,=V,O\nAV, << - kT/q (Schottky-type surface barrier), it follows from the above set of equations\n(for t=O+):\n\n+\n\nI V / +AV. I"\' I V: I\n=\n\nir\n\n(6)\n\nwhere e/(\n2qnaeEo)-"2,nb is the free carrier concentration in the bulk and E- is the strain at the surface.\nIntroducing a measurable quantity Z defined as\nZ=ldAV,/deBjl=o :there is obtained from eq. (6) the\nfollowing expression:\n2%4dd3,\'1\n\nV\n\'\n.\n\n+ Ai\', I\n\n(7)\n\nAccording to eq. (7), Z2is linearly related to AVs, i.e.,\nthe cpd upon bending (eo+).\nExperimental results\nbear out this relationship. It will be appreciated on the\nbasis of the foregoing discussion that very small magnitudes of force can be sensed by employing the sensor\nherein disclosed.\nAn a-c displacement signal can also be generated if\nthe wafer-reference electrode 5 capacitance is maintained in a constant (non-vibrating) configuration and\nthe cpd is varied periodically, as is previously noted.\nThe periodic variation in cpd can be produced by\nchopped incident light. The a-c signal properly (Fourier) analyzed can serve for determining (and continuously recording) a-c surface photovoltage. The samplereference electrode configuration shown in FIG. 1 can\n6o be employed as can, also, the cpd-measuring circuit.\nThe chopping is effected by the light chopper 4, as\npr-231\nUZ.\n(1)\nmentioned, which is provided with its own input reference signal.

Thus, cpd can be employed to sense impinging radiation itself. Furthermore, if the wafer 1 is enclosed within a vacuum cham- 25\n,\nber, represented by the block designated 11 in FIG. 3\nand subjected to a high vacuum (- lo-\xe2\x80\x9d torr), the cpd\ncan be employed to sense very small magnitudes of a\ngas which may enter the chamber 11 through a controlled leak or through a gas inlet valve. The gas such as 30\noxygen, for example, entering the chamber 11 is absorbed upon the surface of the wafer 1 and effects\nchanges in the cpd. A most important use of the concepts herein disclosed is measurement of traces of a gas\nby means of noting changes of mechanical stress of the 35\nsemiconductor wafer caused by the gas, an original bias\nstress being caused by light impinged upon a properly\noriented, non-centrosymmetric semiconductor wafer.\nThis latter concept is discussed in the next several para40\ngraphs.\nIn FIG. 3 the semiconductor wafer is designated 1A.\nThe wafer 1A is fastened rigidly at one end 12, as\nshown. The free end of the wafer 1A is, thus, free to\nvibrate. In this situation the thin CdS wafer 1A exhibits\npronounced bending when illuminated with white light. 45\nChopped white light can be employed to excite the\nwafer to its natural frequency. However, the amplitude\nof vibration has been found to be a function of the\nfrequency of the incident radiation. Thus, the embodiment of FIG. 3 can be used to detect radiation fre- 50\nquency in and around the visible spectrum or the presence of gases when light of a known frequency is used.\nSome experimental work is discussed in the next several paragraphs, the wafer being made of CdS, GaAs or\nother such semiconductors in work discussed in con- 55\nnection with FIGS. 3 and 5. It should be preliminarily\nnoted that two parameters can be measured to give a\nmeasurable indication of the thing to-be-sensed. First,\nthe cpd can be sensed employing an arrangement similar to FIG. 1 and, second, mechanical vibration of the 60\nwafer can be sensed employing the weak light beam\nshown schematically at 17 and a pick-up mechanism\n18; the latter can be merely a movie-type screen.\nThe wafers, employed in the arrangement depicted\nby FIG. 3, measured about 10 X 3 X 0.015 mm. They 65\nwere cut from carefully selected high-purity n-type CdS\nsingle crystals with a resistivity of about 1 a m . They\nwere mechanically ground and then were chemically\n\n< 2.5\n\n- 2.35\n\netched in 0.5N kzCrzO,: 16N\nto their final dimensions. They exhibited initial \xe2\x80\x9cspontaneous bending\xe2\x80\x9d consistent with previously noted results on wafers\nof 111-V compounds. The illumination arrangement\nconsisted of a xenon lamp, a double prism monochrometor and a variable frequency chopper. Typically, lOI4 photonhec. (hu- 2.5 eV) were used to excite the wafers to their fundamental frequency vibration, which was of the order of 100 Hz. The resulting\nrelative amplitude (amplitude divided by the length of\nthe sample) of the vibration was of the order of 5 X 1O*.\nThe amplitude was determined by means of a colli7\nmated laser beam 1 reflected from the CdS wafers\nupon the screen 1 .The intensity of the cw laser beam\n8\n( A =0.63 pm) was reduced to a level that did not affect\nthe bending of the wafers under study. Background\nillumination had to be excluded. Surface photovoltage\nwas also measured as the light-induced change in the\ncontact potentia1 difference by employing a gold reference electrode 5, as before.\nThe spectrum of the amplitude of vibration as a function of the wavelength of the incident radiation exhibited by the CdS wafers is very similar to their surfacephotovoltage spectrum and differs considerably from\ntheir photoconductivity spectrum. Accordingly, it is\nconcluded that the observed photomechanical effect is\na surface effect associated with the light-induced\nchanges in the electric field at the surface (surface\nbarrier). In view of the piezoelectric properties of CdS,\nthe electric field can be related to the resulting strain\non the basis of the converse piezoelectric effect. Thus,\nto explain the observed photomechanical effect, a\nmodel is proposed involving (a) a surface-photovoltage\nstep and (b) an electromechanical step. Step (a) has\nbeen discussed previously herein and analyzed for CdS\nsurfaces. Regarding step (b) in a matrix notation the\nelectric field E in FIG. 5 is related to the strain compo3\nnents ~j by\nej = d&i,\n\n(8)\n\nwherein dg is piezoelectric coefficient.

Accordingly; an electric\neration of mechanical waves (e.g., ultrasonic phonons)\nfield E = (O,O&) perpendicular to the basal planes\nby modulating the lattice strain in single crystals or,\n(FIG. induces strain e = (~1&2&3,0,0,0) compo5)\nwith\nconversely, as a phonon detector.\nnents in the xl, [ 1001 and x2, [ 1201, directions as well\nIt should be further pointed out that when ambient\nas in the x3,[001 I, direction. The electric field (and 5 molecules introduce surface states through absorption\nthe amplitude of vibration of a wafer like the wafer 1A\nthus the strain components) in the basal surfaces of the\nwafer is in opposite directions since both surfaces have\nis very sensitive to even trace amounts of these molea depletion layer. Consequently, one surface is under\ncules at the energy of illumination corresponding to the\ncompression and the other under tension and the wafer\nenergy of the introduced surface states. Accordingly,\nundergoes spontaneous bending (this bending is in I O the photomechanical effect serves as the basis for exaddition to that caused by the elastic strain associated\ntremely sensitive detectors of gaseous (or liquid) spewith the bonding configuration of the surfaces). Under\ncies. By employing a variety of non-centrosymmetric\nillumination the electric field decreases in both sursemiconductors it is possible to encompass a number of\nmolecular species which, through absorption, introfaces leading to a decrease in the strain and, thus, in the\nextent of bending.
