The\n\nto\t\n\nmethod includes the steps of subjecting a section of the\nEarth\'s ground surface to an air pressure P from an air\nsupply; venting to the atmosphere a cross-sectional area S\nof the subterrain at a depth of H from the section of the\nEarth\'s surface under test; measuring the volume velocity U\n\n15\t\n\nof air flow to the section of the Earth\'s surface under test\nto obtain the air flow to said subterranean area; and\ncomputing the flow resistivity R from the formula:\nR = PSC/UH\nwhere C Is a correction factor.\n\nzu\t\n\nThe apparatus that constitutes the invention is a\nspecimen holder which is adapted to make in-situ flow\nresistivity measurements of the Earth\'s ground surface. A\nfirst inner cylinder with a cross-sectional area S is\nadapted to receive an air pressure into one of its ends and\n\n\'L5\t\n\nadapted to penetrate the Earth\'s surface at its other end.\nA second outside cylinder concentric with the first cylinder\nalso penetrates the ground. A recess on the inside surface\nof the outer cylinder creates an air space between the two\ncylinders whenever they penetrate the ground surface. A\n\n30\n\nseries of holes in the part of the outer cylinder that does\nnot penetrate the ground surface vents the air space to the\natmosphere. Consequently, the subterrain at the penetrating\nend of the first cylinder is vented to the atmosphere. The\n\n35\t\n\nflow of air through the first cylinder and through the air\nspace to the atmosphere is the measure of the volume \t\n\nf\n\nvelocity U. \t\n\nf\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
