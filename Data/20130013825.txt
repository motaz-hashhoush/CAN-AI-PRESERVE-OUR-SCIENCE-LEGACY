b'Software\nEnsemble Eclipse: A Process\nfor Prefab Development\nEnvironment for the\nEnsemble Project\nThis software simplifies the process of\nhaving to set up an Eclipse IDE programming environment for the members of the cross-NASA center project,\nEnsemble. It achieves this by assembling\nall the necessary add-ons and custom\ntools/preferences.\nThis software is unique in that it allows developers in the Ensemble Project\n(approximately 20 to 40 at any time)\nacross multiple NASA centers to set up a\ndevelopment environment almost instantly and work on Ensemble software.\nThe software automatically has the\nsource code repositories and other vital\ninformation and settings included.\nThe Eclipse IDE is an open-source development framework. The NASA (Ensemble-specific) version of the software\nincludes Ensemble-specific plug-ins as\nwell as settings for the Ensemble project.\nThis software saves developers the time\nand hassle of setting up a programming\nenvironment, making sure that everything is set up in the correct manner for\nEnsemble development.\nExisting software (i.e., standard\nEclipse) requires an intensive setup\nprocess that is both time-consuming and\nerror prone. This software is built once\nby a single user and tested, allowing\nother developers to simply download\nand use the software.\nThis work was done by Michael N. Wallick,\nDavid S. Mittman, and Khawaja S. Shams\nof Caltech; and Andrew G. Bachmann and\nMelissa Ludowise of NASA Ames Research\nCenter for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor more information, contact iaoffice@\njpl.nasa.gov.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

ISSLive! uses the push technology to display real-time telemetry and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2013\n\nmission timeline data from the space station in any common Web browser or Internet-enabled mobile device.\nISSLive! is designed to fill a unique\nniche in the education and outreach\nareas by providing access to real-time\nspace station data without a physical\npresence in the mission control center.\nThe technology conforms to Internet\nstandards, supports the throughput\nneeded for real-time space station data,\nand is flexible enough to work on a large\nnumber of Internet-enabled devices.\nISSLive! consists of two custom components: (1) a series of data adapters\nthat resides server-side in the mission\ncontrol center at Johnson Space Center,\nand (2) a set of public html that renders\nthe data pushed from the data adapters.\nA third component, the Lightstreamer\nserver, is commercially available from a\nthird party and acts as an intermediary\nbetween custom components (1) and\n(2). Lightstreamer also provides proprietary software libraries that are required\nto use the custom components.\nAt the time of this reporting, this is the\nfirst usage of Web-based, push streaming\ntechnology in the aerospace industry.\nThis work was done by Jennifer Price and\nPhilip Harris of Johnson Space Center; Bruce\nHochstetler, Mark Guerra, and Israel Mendez\nof Tietronix Software, Inc.; and Matthew\nHealy and Ahmed Khan of the United Space\nAlliance.

MSC-25253-1\n\nSpace Operations Learning\nCenter (SOLC)\niPhone/iPad Application\nThis iPhone application, Space Junk\nSammy, is intended to be an educational\napplication designed for Apple iPhones\nand iPads. This new concept educates\nkids in an innovative way about how orbital debris affects space missions.\nOrbital debris is becoming a very significant concern for NASA and all Earthorbiting space missions. Spacecraft in\nlow-Earth orbit are in constant danger of\nbeing potentially damaged or destroyed\nby debris. High-profile spacecraft such\nas the International Space Station (ISS)\nand Hubble Space Telescope are dealing\nwith orbital debris on a regular basis.\nOther basic educational concepts that\nare portrayed are low-Earth orbits, satel-\n\nlites, ISS, attitude control, and other\nfacts that can be presented in betweenlevel popup screens.\nThe Orbital Debris Cleanup game is\nrelatively simple from the user\xe2\x80\x99s technical standpoint. It is a 2D game where the\nuser\xe2\x80\x99s avatar is a satellite buddy, named\nSammy, in orbit around Earth. Sammy is\ncontrolled by the user with the device\xe2\x80\x99s\ngyroscope as well as touchscreen controls. It has equipment used for taking\ncare of the space debris objects on the\nscreen. Sammy also has a claw, a laser deflector, and hydrazine rockets to grab or\npush the debris objects into a higher\norbit or into a lower orbit to burn up in\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nThe user interface shows Sammy and\nspace debris objects constantly moving\nfrom left to right, where Sammy is trying\nto \xe2\x80\x9ccatch\xe2\x80\x9d the debris objects before they\nmove off the right side of the screen.\nEverything will be in constant motion to\nincrease fun and add to the realism of\norbiting the Earth. The satellite buddy is\nused to clean up the space debris and\nprotect other satellites. Later levels will\ninclude a laser deflector and hydrazine\nrockets instead of a robotic claw to push\nthe orbital debris into a higher orbit and\nout of the path of other satellites.\nThis work was done by Daniel Binebrink,\nHeng Kuok, Malinda Hammond, and Scott\nHull of Goddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-16612-1\n\nSoftware to Compare NPP\nHDF5 Data Files\nThis software was developed for the\nNPOESS (National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System)\nPreparatory Project (NPP) Science Data\nSegment. The purpose of this software is\nto compare HDF5 (Hierarchical Data\nFormat) files specific to NPP and report\nwhether the HDF5 files are identical. If\nthe HDF5 files are different, users have\nthe option of printing out the list of differences in the HDF5 data files.\nThe user provides paths to two directories containing a list of HDF5 files to compare. The tool would select matching\nHDF5 file names from the two directories\nand run the comparison on each file.\nThe user can also select from three\nlevels of detail. Level 0 is the basic level,\nwhich simply states whether the files\n\n23\n\n'
