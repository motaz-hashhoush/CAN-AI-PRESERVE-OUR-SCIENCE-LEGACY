The change\nin the cantilever mass can be accurately quantified by monitoring a resonance frequency shift of the cantilever. For biodetection, antibodies or other specific receptors oftarget antigens may be immobilized on the cantilever surface,\npreferably on the non-piezoelectric tip. For chemical detection, high surface-area selective absorbent materials are\ncoated on the cantilever tip. Binding of the target antigens or\nanalytes to the cantilever surface increases the cantilever\nmass. Detection of target antigens or analytes is achieved by\nmonitoring the cantilever\xe2\x80\x99s resonance frequency and determining the resonance frequency shift that is due to the mass of\nthe adsorbed target antigens on the cantilever surface. The use\nof a piezoelectric unimorph cantilever allows both electrical\nactuation and electrical sensing. Incorporating a non-piezoelectric tip (14) enhances the sensitivity of the sensor. In\naddition, the piezoelectric cantilever can withstand damping\nin highly viscous liquids and can be used as a viscosity sensor\nin wide viscosity range.\n43 Claims, 7 Drawing Sheets\n\nX\n\nIO\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n14\n\n>\n\nI-\n\nI1\n\nf\n\n//\n\n15\n\n12\n\nJ\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\nPage 2\nU.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS\n5,162,691\n5,283,037\n5,719,324\n5,742,377\n5,883,705\n6,252,335\n6,289,717\n6,336,366\n6,545,273\n6,813,815\n7,061,166\n7,089,813\n7,262,546\n7,329,536\n2005/0248235\n2006/0123910\n2007/0089519\n2008/0035180\n\nA\n11/1992 Mariani\nA * 2/1994 Baer et al. ............... 422/82.01\nA\n2/1998 Thundat\nA\n4/1998 Minne\nA\n3/1999 Minne\nB1\n6/2001 Nilsson\nB1\n9/2001 Thundat\nB1\n1/2002 Thundat\nB1\n4/2003 Singh\nB2 * 11/2004 Namerikawa et al. ...... 29/25.35\nB2 * 6/2006 Kuniyasu ....................\n310/365\nB2 * 8/2006 Takeuchi et al. .............. 73/865\nB2 * 8/2007 Namerikawa et al. ....... 310/366\nB2 * 2/2008 Zeng et al. ............... 435/287.2\nA1 * 11/2005 Namerikawa et al. ....... 310/328\nA1 * 6/2006 Cunningham et al. ......... 73/580\nA1 * 4/2007 Hao et al. .....................\n73/649\nA1 * 2/2008 Mutharasan et al. .......... 134/32\n\nOTHER PUBLICATIONS\nYi, Jeong Woo et al., Effect of Length, Width, and Mode on the Mass\nDetection Sensitivity of Piezoelectric Unimorph Cantilevers, Journal\n\nofApplied Physics, Feb. 1, 2002, pp. 1-7, vol. 91, No. 3, American\nInstitute of Physics, USA.\nYi, Jeong W. et al., In Situ Cell Detection using Piezoelectric Lead\nZirconate Titanate-Stainless Steel Cantilevers, Jan. 1,2003,pp. 619625, vol. 93, No. 1, American Institute of Physics, USA.\nThaysen, J. et al., Cantilever-Based Bio-Chemical Sensor Integrated\nin a MicroliquidHandling System, 2001, pp. 401-404.\nL, Junjun et al., Micromachined Biomimetic Sensor Using Modular\nArtificial Hair Cells, pp. 1-3.\nThaysen, J., Label Free Detection, BioMEMs Materials and Fabrication Methods, Track 2, 3:00pm, Sep. 7, 2002, pp. 1-3.\nLee, Chengkuo et al., Self-Excited Piezoelectric PZT\nMicorantilevers for Dynamic SFM-With\nInherent Sensing and\nActuating Capabilities, Sensors and Actuators A72, 1999, pp. 179188.\nHuiming Gu et al., Single-Calcination Synthesis of Pyrochlore-Free\nO.SPb(Mg 1/3NB2/3)03-0. 1PbTiO3 and Pb (Mg1/3Nb2/3)03\nCeramics Using a Coating Method, Journal of the American Ceramic\nSociety, 2003, pp. 217-221, vol. 86, No. 2.\n\n* cited by examiner\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nDec. 2,2008\n\nSheet 1 of 7\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\n44\n\n/\n\n15\n\nFIG.

The\ndeflection at the tip of the silicon-based cantilever is driven by\nthe vibration driver located at the base of the silicon-based\ncantilever and is detected by external optical components.\nDriving a cantilever at its base is not the most effective way to\ngenerate deflections at the tip of the cantilever. While the\nrelatively weak deflection signal generated by the vibration\ndriver at the base is sufficient for in-air detection it does not\nwithstand the damping of water.\nSilicon-based micro-cantilever sensors therefore have the\nfollowing shortcomings when used for mass detection using\nthe resonance mechanism: (1) A silicon-based micro-cantilever sensor needs to be driven by an external actuator. (2) A\nsilicon-based micro-cantilever sensor loses its detection sensitivity in water due to viscous damping. (3) A silicon-based\nmicro-cantilever requires a complex external optical detection system. The resolution of the optical detector puts a limit\non how small the displacement can be and therefore, how\nsmall the cantilever can be, which places significant constraints on detection sensitivity.\nFor detection of stress, the silicon-based micro-cantilever\nsensor does not need a driver, but requires an external optical\nsystem or a piezo-resistive layer. Stress detection using a\npiezo-resistive layer involves DC electrical measurements.\nFurthermore, detection using a piezo-resistive layer is not\nvery sensitive. Therefore, most silicon cantilevers use an\nexternal optical means for detection. In silicon-based microcantilevers, the adsorption induced stress decays in 20 minutes and the adsorbed amount cannot be quantified.\nCompared to silicon-based sensors, piezoelectric microcantilever sensors are not as bulky and complex. Piezoelectric\ndevices are excellent transduction candidates because of their\nshort response time and high piezoelectric coefficients.\nBecause they are piezoelectric, both the driving and sensing\nof the mechanical resonance can be conveniently done electrically within the resonator. Currently, piezoelectric biosensors are based on commercially available quartz crystal\nmicrobalances (QCM), a disk device that uses thicknessmode resonance for sensing.Although quartz is a weakpiezoelectric material, it is widely used as a layer thickness monitor\nin part due to the availability of large quartz single crystals to\nmake the membranes. The typical mass detection sensitivity\nof a 5 MHz QCM that has a minimum detectable mass density\n(DMD) of\ng/cm2 is about lo-\xe2\x80\x99 g/Hz, about two orders of\nmagnitude less sensitive than millimeter sized piezoelectric\ncantilevers. Moreover, because QCMs are larger in size, they\nare harder to develop into array sensors for multiple antigens.\nQuartz is a weak piezoelectric, much like the silicon-based\ncantilever, when immersed in water, the resonance peak\nintensity of QCM is reduced to less than one twentieth of the\nin-air peak intensity due to viscous damping of water, thus\nlimiting the use of QCMs in water.\nQCMs employ a piezoelectric crystal that serves as the\nactuator, resonator, and detector. However, it involves shear\nwaves of the thickness mode of the crystal rather than the\nflexural mode of the cantilever geometry. QCMs have a lower\nmass sensitivity than a silicon-based micro-cantilever.QCMs\n\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST\nThis invention was reduced to practice with Government\nsupport under Grant No. NAG2-1475 awarded by NASA,\nGrant No. R01 EB00720-01 awarded by NIH and Grant No.\nR-82960401 awarded by the EPA; the Government is therefore entitled to certain rights to this invention.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n1. Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to the field of sensors. In particular\nthe invention relates to methods and apparatus for sensing\nbiological and chemical species, as well as the measurement\nof viscosity.\n2. Description of the Related Technology\nMost of the current work done with biosensing technologies relies on fluorescence, lasers, fiber-optics-based methods, quartz crystal microbalance technology, electrochemical\nenzyme immunoassays, and binding to metal particles. Most\nof these techniques are neither direct, nor quantitative. Many\nof these techniques are also quite slow. In addition, most of\nthe aforementioned techniques do not lend themselves to\nmeasurement of changes in mass, which may provide a convenient way to measure a variety of different parameters.\nA mass sensor based on resonance frequency needs three\ncomponents, an actuator (driver), a resonator, and a detector.\nApopularmass sensor is a silicon-basedmicro-cantilever due\nto its commercial availability and ease of integration with\nexisting silicon based methodologies. In a silicon-based\nmicro-cantilever mass sensor, the micro-cantilever acts as the\nresonator and is driven by an external lead zirconate titanate\n(PZT) actuator at the base of the micro-cantilever to generate\nvibrations in the resonator, which may be detected by an\nexternal optical detector. For bio-detection, receptors are\nimmobilized at the micro-cantilever surface. Binding of antigens to the receptors immobilized on the cantilever surface\nincreases the cantilever mass and causes a decrease in the\nresonance frequency. Detection of target molecules is\nachieved by monitoring the mechanical resonance frequency.\nIn spite of the popularity of silicon-based micro-cantilevers,\nthey rely on complex external optical components for detection. In addition, the PZT vibration driver adds to the weight\nand complexity of the sensor. Further, the external actuator\ncan only be located at the base of the micro-cantilever, which\ngreatly limits its effectiveness in driving the cantilever\xe2\x80\x99s\nvibration. The optical means of detection also limits how\nsmall the micro-cantilever can be fabricated, and therefore\nlimits the mass detection sensitivity.\nIn addition to mass detection, silicon-based micro-cantilevers have also been used as sensors for small molecules by\ndetecting the stress generated on the cantilever by the adsorption of species onto receptors associated with the cantilever.\nAntibody or DNA receptors are coated on the surface of the\nmicro-cantilevers to bind target protein or DNA molecules.\nThe stress generated at the time of binding or unbinding of the\ntarget molecules to the receptors on the micro-cantilever surface induces a temporary deflection of the micro-cantilever\nthat may be detected by external optical components or by an\nadsorption-stress-induced DC voltage on a piezo-resistive\ncoating layer on the cantilever surface. Because the bindinginduced stress decays with time, it can only be detected when\nthe micro-cantilever is first introduced to the target molecules. The induced stress, and hence the induced DCvoltage,\ndissipates within 20 minutes. Also, detecting the adsorption-\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\n3\n\n4\n\nare also limited by the following shortcomings. Due to its\nplanargeometry, formass detection, QCMs arenot capable of\ndetecting very small amounts of mass, which limits the detection sensitivity. Also, QCMs use higher resonance frequencies (>5 MHz), which reduces the relative sensitivity, (Afif),\nwhere f and Af denote the initial resonance frequency and the\nresonance shift. QCMs are also difficult to miniaturize in\norder to improve the detection sensitivity.\nComparing the two direct biosensor technologies, siliconbased-micro-cantilever sensors', exhibit high mass-detection\nsensitivity,but the optical detection system is large and complex. QCM-based sensors have the merit of simple electrical\ndriving and electrical detection but they exhibit a much lower\nmass sensitivity than silicon-based micro-cantilevers.\nQCMs are also larger in size thus harder to develop into\narray sensors for multiple antigens.\nTherefore, there exists a need for improvement of the sensing capabilities of existing sensors.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a diagram of a piezoelectric cantilever sensor\nillustrating the parameters used in determining the geometry\nof the piezoelectric cantilever sensor.\nFIG. 5 shows a diagram of a piezoelectric cantilever sensor\nillustrating the locations of various points on the piezoelectric\ncantilever sensor where specific equations govern the boundary conditions.\nFIG. 6 shows a graph depicting the experimental data for a\npiezoelectric cantilever sensor compared to theoretically calculated values.\nFIG. 7 shows a graph depicting the sensitivity of a piezoelectric cantilever sensor for different modes.\nFIG.

The\nlength of one of the layers is less than the length of the other\nof the layers. The apparatus also has electrodes located proximate to the piezoelectric layer.\nAccording to a second aspect of the invention,a method for\nthe detection of mass is provided.

The viscosity measurement\nmethod involves the initial step of providing an apparatus\nhaving a non-piezoelectric layer, and a piezoelectric layer\nbonded to the non-piezoelectric layer, wherein the length of\none of the layers is less than the length of the other of the\nlayers. The apparatus also includes electrodes located proximate to the piezoelectric layer. The method also involves the\nsteps of placing the provided apparatus in a liquid, measuring\na resonance frequency of the apparatus, comparing the resonance frequency to a baseline to determine a resonance frequency shift, and determining a viscosity of the liquid based\nupon the resonance frequency shift.\nThese and various other features and advantages that characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the\nclaims annexed hereto and forming a part hereof.

PECS combine the\nmerits of silicon based sensors and QCMs and (i) exhibit high\ndetection sensitivity, (ii) use electrical means for driving and\nsensing, (iii) have a minimal damping effect, and (iv) are\ncompact, light-weight, and simple to operate. A PECS can be\nused in water for biological or chemical sensing. A PECS can\nalso be used in oil or other highly viscous fluids for chemical\nand viscosity sensing.\nAn important aspect of the present invention involves the\ndetection mechanism employed in the device ofthe invention,\nas well as the placement of the actuator. Detection using\nPECS 15, shown in FIG. 1, is achieved electrically using the\npiezoelectric layer, while detection by a silicon-based microcantilever is achieved by optically monitoring the resonance\nfrequency shift. The driver of the PECS 15 is the same as the\nresonator in PECS 15, which facilitates the most effective\ndriving, whereas the external driver of a silicon-based microcantilever sits at the base of the cantilever, which makes the\ndriving less effective.\nPiezoelectric cantilever sensors may be used as mass detectors for bio-detection applications and chemical detection\napplications. FIG. 1 shows a general diagram of how a PECS\n15 is constructed. PECS 15 is a piezoelectric unimorph cantilever with a piezoelectric layer 10 bonded to a longer nonpiezoelectric layer 12. Both piezoelectric layer 10 and nonpiezoelectric layer 12 are attached to clamp 11. The portion of\nnon-piezoelectric layer 12 that extends beyond the end of\npiezoelectric layer 10 forms a non-piezoelectric tip 14. Alternative embodiments may have piezoelectric layer 10 extend\nbeyond non-piezoelectric layer 12 and, in such alternative\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\n5\n\n6\n\nembodiments a piezoelectric tip (not shown) would be\nformed. In order to achieve the best results one of the piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric layers must extend beyond the\nother.\nFIG. 2 shows a diagram of an alternative embodiment of\nthe cantilever sensor 17 having two piezoelectric layers 10\nand 13. In this embodiment, non-piezoelectric layer 12 is\nplaced between piezoelectric layers 10 and 13. In alternative\nembodiments, it is also possible to have a piezoelectric layer\nplaced between two non-piezoelectric layers, if desired.\nAn important aspect of the current invention lies in the use\nof a highly piezoelectric layer as part of the cantilever structure, which enables electrical means for detection and actuation within the cantilever. Piezoelectric material produces\nelectricity via mechanical pressure on certain crystals (notably quartz or Rochelle salt); or, alternatively, electrostatic\nstress produces a change in the linear dimensions of the\ncrystal. Some advantages of the present invention include\nallowing simple electrical measurements for detection with\nbetter signal sensitivity compared to silicon-based microcantilevers. This is clearly evidenced in Q values, where\nQ=f/6fwith f representing the resonance frequency and 6f the\nwidth of the resonance peak at half the peak height. A higher\nQ represents a better signal intensity. PECS 15 has a Q value\nwell above 50 in water, whereas silicon-based micro-cantilevers have a Q value of about 1 in water.\nIn addition, using electrical measurements for detection\ndoes not impose a limit on how small the cantilever can be.\nThis allows the cantilevers to be miniaturized to further\nimprove the mass detection sensitivity. For example, by miniaturizing cantilevers to smaller than 50 pm long, the mass\ndetection sensitivity can reach\ng/Hz. The piezoelectric\nlayer 10, which is the driver, is part of the cantilever. Because\nthe driver of a PECS 15 is also the resonator, it leads to more\neffective actuation and better signal intensities for detection.\nThis is very different from the external PZT actuator used in\na silicon-based micro-cantilever that sits at the base of the\ncantilever.Driving a cantilever from the base of the cantilever\nis the most ineffective way to drive a cantilever (This is\nanalogous to bouncing off a diving board from the base rather\nthan from the tip).\nPECS 15 uses AC electrical impedance measurements to\ndetect the resonance frequency shift, whereas the siliconbased-micro-cantilever uses optical means for detection.\nSome silicon-based micro-cantilevers use a piezo-resistive\nlayer to measure a DC voltage induced by the stress generated\nby the adsorption. This is different from the AC impedance\nmeasurements used by PECS 15 for monitoring the resonance\nfrequency shift. Moreover, cantilevers with a piezo-resistive\nlayer do not provide the same level of signal intensity as\ncantilevers with a highly piezoelectric layer, as in the present\ninvention.\nThe differences between PECS 15 and QCM are just as\nstriking. PECS 15 uses a flexural (bending) mode resonance\nfor detection rather than the thickness mode, thereby employing a much lower frequency and thus having a higher sensitivity. The flexural mode resonance frequency is typically\nbelow 100 H Z . In contrast, the thickness mode resonance\nfrequency of QCM is typically above 5 MHz. The lower\nfrequencies used by PECS 15 allows a better resolution in\nfrequency. For the same amount of frequency shift, Af, the\nrelative frequency change Af/f is higher with PECS 15 than\nwith QCM. Due to the planar geometry of the QCM, a QCM\ncannot detect very small masses. The piezoelectric coefficient\nof quartz is two orders of magnitude smaller than PZT. This\nresults in a smaller signal intensity, which makes QCM unfavorable for in-water detection.\n\nDetection is achieved by monitoring the cantilever's resonance frequency shift due to the mass increase of, for\nexample, an adsorbed target antigen on cantilever tip 14,\nusing electrical means. The use of the highly piezoelectric\nlayer facilitates the all-electrical actuation and monitoring of\nthe resonance frequency shift. With, for example, an antibody\nimmobilized at the cantilever tip, piezoelectric unimorph cantilever sensors with a tip permit rapid, direct, quantitative\ndetection of bioagents such as proteins and cells in water with\nsimple all electrical measurements.\nFurthermore, as noted above, using electrical measurements for detection allows the use of very small cantilevers,\nfor example, cantilevers 50 pn long can be used to achieve\nunprecedented mass detection sensitivity.A 50 pn long cantilever can detect masses on the order of femtograms.\nThe design of the non-piezoelectric tip of the cantilever\ncontributes to the detection sensitivity and versatility: (1) by\nincreasing the adsorption area for detection, (2) by amplifying the vibration amplitude at the tip to increase the mass\ndetection sensitivity, and (3) by enhancing the intensity ofthe\nsecond and higher order resonance peaks to allow detection at\nhigher order peaks (which in turn further increased the mass\ndetection sensitivity). The result of the invention is a sensor\nthat can be used to detect biological agents andor chemical\nagents that can (1) sense and quantify mass, (2) directly detect\nthe target antigen or chemical without labeling and amplification, (3) be used in an aqueous solution without reducing its\nQ factor, (4) both actuate and detect by electrical means,\nthereby enabling it to be portable, (5) be miniaturized to\ng/Hz\nachieve unprecedented detection sensitivity e.g.,\n(smaller than the mass of the single bacterium) and also be\ncompatible with microelectronic circuitry, and (6) be able to\nwithstand damping of highly viscous fluids such as oil for\nviscosity measurements and performing chemical sensing in\noil or other viscous fluids.\nThe mass detection sensitivity of piezoelectric unimorph\ncantilevers with no tip (i.e. the tip length L,=O) has been\nanalyzed experimentally.Denoting Am as the adsorbed point\nmass at the cantilever free end, the frequency change, A t , in\nthe ith-moderesonance frequency, <,due to the mass change,\nAm, can be approximated as\n\n5\n\nio\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nAA =-AAm/M,,\n45\n\nwhere Me is the effective mass of the cantilever. The frequency change can be further related to the cantilever length,\nL,, and width, w, as\nAf4Am.r l/wLp3.\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe mass change per Hz is therefore AndAfzmwLp3,\nindicating that reducing the cantilever size by a factor a, the mass\nchange per Hz will decrease with the fourth power of a as\nAndAf,ma4. AndAf is expected to reach\ng/Hz with a\n50-pm long piezoelectric micro-cantilever with no tip, which\nallows the detection of a single particle of 60 nm in size; and\n10-l' g/Hz with a 15 pm long piezoelectric micro-cantilever\nthat makes detection of a single sphere of 10 nm in diameter\nor a single DNA molecule (lo6 Dalton) possible. With a tip of\nan optimal length and thickness, detection sensitivity is further enhanced.\nBecause PECS 15 utilizes mechanical resonance as the\nmeans for sensing, the ratio of the thickness (t,) of the nonpiezoelectric layer to the thickness (t,) of the piezoelectric\nlayer plays an important role. The optimal thickness ratio\ndepends on the Young's modulus ratio of the two layers.\nDenoting the thickness and Young's modulus of the piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric layers as t,, E and t,, En,\n,\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\n7\n\n8\n\nrespectively,and the thickness ratio (t,/t,) andyoung\xe2\x80\x99s modulus ratio (E,/E,) as a and b respectively, the optimal resonance\nstrength occurs at aman satisfies\nthat\n\n(PEMS) 100 can be arranged into arrays using micro-fabrication techniques. The piezoelectric micro-cantilever sensor\n100 can be utilized for in-situ rapid, simultaneous, direct\nquaglification of molecules with unprecedented attogram\n(10 g) sensitivity.\nThe possible resonance frequency for mass sensing ranges\nfrom 1 kHz to 10 MHz, to preferably 50 kHz to 5 MHz Using\nthe resonance frequency shift to quantify the mass change of\na piezoelectric micro-cantilever sensor 100 as a detection\nmechanism for biological systems has the advantages that (1)\nthe post-adsorption resonance frequency change will remain\nunchanged as long as the adsorbed target antigens remain\nadsorbed, (2) the amount of the adsorbed antigens can be\ndetermined from the resonance frequency shift, and (3) it uses\nall-electrical actuation and detection. This is different from\nbio-detection using silicon-based micro-cantilevers with a\npiezo-resistive layer, which detects a DC voltage induced by\nthe stress upon adsorption of the antigens.\nAs described above, miniaturization of the piezoelectric\nunimorph cantilevers to make piezoelectric micro-cantilever\nsensors (PEMS) 100 allows unprecedented mass detection\nsensitivity. Another benefit of piezoelectric micro-cantilever\nsensors (PEMS) 100 is the potential forreduction of detection\ntime. The attachment of target bio-agents, or target substances requires diffusion of the target bio-agents to the surface PEMS 100. A smaller detectable mass change, Am,\nmeans smaller amounts of bio-agents, or other substances,\nneed to absorb on the PEMS 100 surface for detection, which\nis important for ultra-low concentration detection. A smaller\nminimal detectable amount means a smaller diffusion volume\nand therefore a shorter diffusion time for materials, to reach\nthe cantilever surface. When the cantilever is shrunk by a\nfactor of a in all dimensions, the time needed for the minimal\ndetectable amount of material, to reach the surface of PEMS\n100 is reduced by a factor a4j3. example, when cantilever\nFor\nsize is reduced from 1 cm to 50 pm, the detection time is\nreduced by a factor of about 1000. Thus, reducing the cantilever size not only increases the sensitivity of the device, it\nmay also significantly decrease the detection time.\nCurrently, with a 5-mm long cantilever, the detection time\nis about 60 minutes in a concentration of 1 g/L. With a\ncantilever 50 pm in length, the adsorption time may be significantly less than 1 minute, allowing for real-time concentration quantification.\nIt is to be understood that the geometry shown in FIG. 3 is\nonly one of the possible geometries that the PEMS 100 could\nhave. The shape of PEMS 100 can be full or open, rectangular,\nrounded, or various other polygonal shapes. Non-piezoelectric tip 114 canbe an extensionofnon-piezoelectric layer 112,\nor could alternatively be constructed of a different, non-piezoelectric material than the non-piezoelectric layer 112. Furthermore, it is possible to have the piezoelectric layer be\nlonger than the non-piezoelectric layer in order to form a\npiezoelectric tip. The length of piezoelectric layer 110 can\nrange from 2.5 centimeters to 0.5 microns, or from 1.5 centimeter to 1.Omicron. The thickness ofpiezoelectric layer 110\ncan range from a 10 millimeters to sub-micron thickness\xe2\x80\x99, or\nfrom 1.0 millimeter to sub-micron thickness\xe2\x80\x99. The width of\nthe piezoelectric layer can range from 10 millimeters to 0.5\nmicrons, or from 1.O millimeter to 1.O micron. The length of\nnon-piezoelectric layer 112 can range from 2.5 centimeters to\n0.5 microns, or from 1.5 centimeters to 1.0 micron. The\nthickness of non-piezoelectric layer 112 can range from 10\nmillimeters to sub-micron thickness\xe2\x80\x99, or from 1 millimeter to\nsub-micron thickness\xe2\x80\x99. The width of the non-piezoelectric\nlayer 112 can range from 10 millimeters to 0.5 microns, or\nfrom 1.0 millimeter to 1.0 micron. The PEMS 100 can be\ntapered in the lateral and/or thickness direction. Likewise, the\nnon-piezoelectric tip can be tapered in the lateral and/or\nthickness direction, and can also be muchnarrower or thinner\n\n1-2b-2ba,,x2-2ba,,3-(4b+3b2)a,,x4+3b2a,,5=0\n\nfor a fixed piezoelectric layer thickness and a varied nonpiezoelectric layer thickness. For a fixed total thickness, the\noptimal thickness ratio occurs at aman=b-1/2. practice, the\nIn\noptimal range ofthe thickness ratio, aman, from about 0.2 to\nis\nabout 1. A working range of the thickness ratio (t,/t,) is from\nabout 0.1 to 3.\nThe length ratio influences the strength of higher-mode\nresonance peak intensity and detection sensitivity. The ratio\n1,/1, for optimal high-mode intensity occurs around about\n1,/1,=0.5 where 1, is the length ofthe section containing both\nthe piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric layer and 1, is the\nlength of the layer that extends beyond the section containing\nboth layers to form the tip, respectively. The length ratio\n(l,/l,) may range from about 0.2 to 2.\nThe resonance intensity of PECS 15 is also strongly influenced by the total thickness of the cantilever and more importantly by the piezoelectric layer thickness. This is because\nmost highly piezoelectric layers are ceramic with high density and elastic modulus. For sensors with a total length 2 cm\nto 0.5 pm, the piezoelectric layer thickness, t,, ranges from\n250 pm to 0.5 pm. When piezoelectric layer thickness, t,,\nranges from 250 pn to 0.5 pm, the total cantilever thickness\nt,+t, ranges from 350 pm to 1 pm.\nFIG. 3 shows a schematic of a micro-fabricated piezoelectric micro-cantilever sensor 100, which is a type of PECS 15.\nIt is important to note that while the embodiment shown in\nFIG. 3 shows non-piezoelectric layer 112 being longer than\npiezoelectric layer 110 it is possible to have piezoelectric\nlayer 110 be longer than non-piezoelectric layer 112 in order\nto form a piezoelectric tip. As shown in FIG. 3, Piezoelectric\nlayer 110 and non-piezoelectric layer 112 are on the order of\nmicron thicknesses. For example, lead zirconate titanate\n(PZT), lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate solid solutions\n(PMN,,,-PT,,,)\nand strontium lead titanate (Sr,Pb,,TiO,)\nfilms can be used to form the highly piezoelectric layers 110.\nIn FIG. 3, non-piezoelectric layer 112 is Si,N4. Other material choices for layer 112 include ceramics such as SiO, or\nmetals such as copper, stainless steel, Ti, or polymers or the\ncomposites ofceramics, metals, orpolymers. Ontop ofpiezoelectric layer 110 is top electrode 116, which can be made\nfrom AdCr or Pt/Ti or SO,. Top electrode 116 can be patterned into several regions. Bonding pad 122 is placed on the\nnon-piezoelectric tip 114. Bonding pad 122, when used for\nbio-sensing, can be used to immobilize receptors to bind\nantigens, antibodies or DNA. Bonding pad 122 can also be\nmade of other absorbent materials to absorb analytes for\ndetection of various chemicals. It is also possible to use no\nbonding pad 122 an instead provide material for and use the\nnon-piezoelectric tip for sensing the viscosity of fluids. Bonding pad 122 can be constructed from, for example, gold or\nSiOzand any other material appropriate for the type of detection.\nBetween piezoelectric layer 110 and non-piezoelectric\nlayer 112 is bottom electrode 118, which can be constructed\nout of Pt/TiO, on SiO, or Pt/Ti on a metal substrate. On the\nbottom portion of non-piezoelectric layer 112 can be a layer\nof A1,0, or other electrically insulating materials for electrical insulation of the electrodes. The base of non-piezoelectric\nlayer 112 is placed on top of clamp 124, which can be constructed out of Si or glass or any substrate material. The\nthickness ratio between piezoelectric layer 110 and non-piezoelectric layer 112 is chosen such that it optimizes the\nresonance signal and the mass detection sensitivity. In alternative embodiments, piezoelectric micro-cantilever sensors\n\nl5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n3o\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nUS 7,458,265 B2\n9\nthan the piezoelectric layer. Furthermore, the cantilevers,\nsuch as PEMS 100 can be extended into a sandwich design\nemploying two piezoelectric layers 110 sandwiching a nonpiezoelectric layer 112.\nThe design of the PEMS 100 combines a piezoelectric\nunimorph cantilever with optimal actuation and sensing, as\nwell as a mass-detection-sensitivity-enhancing non-piezoelectric tip 114. The miniaturization of the cantilevers uses\nhighly piezoelectric layers on the order of micron thickness.\nThe benefits of non-piezoelectric tip 114 are nontrivial. The\nbenefits of non-piezoelectric tip 114 can be seen from a comparison of piezoelectric micro-cantilever sensors (PEMS)\n100 of various tip lengths and thicknesses. Solving the fourth\norder differential flexural wave equation of the cantilever\ndeveloped a transcendental equation, discussed below in\nexample 1. The transcendental equation permits accurate prediction of the appropriate non-piezoelectric tip 114 length\nand thickness for optimal sensitivity and Q-factor. Alternatively, this calculation can also be used calculate the optimal\nlength and thickness for the piezoelectric layer in embodiments where a piezoelectric tip is being employed.\nEXAMPLE 1\nFIGS. 4-8f show various graphs that demonstrate the performance of PECS 15, and the effects of variations in the\nlength of non-piezoelectric tip 14. PECS 15 detects mass\nchanges by electrically monitoring resonance frequency\nshifts in flexural modes. The measured resonance frequencies\nrange from 500 kHz to 1500 H z , or from 1 kHz to 1000 kHz.\nFIG, 4 shows a diagram of PECS 15 illustrating the parameters used in determining the geometry of PECS 15.
