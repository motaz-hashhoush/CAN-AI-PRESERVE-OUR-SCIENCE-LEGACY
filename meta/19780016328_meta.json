This simulator is the first to dynamically include the Orbiter reaction control system (RCS) plume effects on a payload being recovered after rendezvous operations. A procedure for braking, using the simultaneous firing of both jets, was evaluated and found very useful for proximity operations. However this procedure is very inefficient in the RCS usage and requires modifications to the digital autopilot (DAP) software. A new final approach, the lateral approach technique (LAT), or the momentum vector proximity approach, was also evaluated in the simulations. The LAT, which included a tailfirst approach for braking, was evaluated successfully with both inertial and gravity stabilized payloads.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780016328, "id": "cdda87fd3d444865b31a7755a9485ac0", "publicationDate": "1978-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780016328.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780016328/downloads/19780016328.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780016328/downloads/19780016328.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780016328/downloads/19780016328.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
