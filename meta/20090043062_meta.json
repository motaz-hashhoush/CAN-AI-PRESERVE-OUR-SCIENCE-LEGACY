A user operates a hand held interrogation and display (IAD) module that communicates with, or is part of, the base station, to provide an initial inquiry. Information on location(s) of the target inventory item is also indicated visibly and/or audibly on the receptacle(s) for the user. Status information includes an assessment of operation readiness and a time, if known, that the specified inventory item or class was last removed or examined or modified. Presentation of a user access level may be required for access to the target inventory item. Another embodiment provides inventory information for a stack as a sight-impaired or hearing-impaired person passes adjacent to that stack.", "title": "Interactive inventory monitoring", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T19:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090043062, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spremo, Stevan M."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "d5822459b6444ed69186a14ea6820cb0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20090043062, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Udoh, Usen E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "aa26333ada6b490f9fcde5ebd10a4ceb"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090043062, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090043062, "id": "6f83ed83c8ec462caf75a0e60e268464", "publicationDate": "2009-04-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090043062.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090043062/downloads/20090043062.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090043062/downloads/20090043062.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090043062/downloads/20090043062.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
