No. 12/128,817, filed May\n29, 2008 now abandoned and, hence, the applicant requests\nthis priority date. This application contains no new subject\nmatter (the specification and drawings are identical, but new\nclaims have been included that replace the original claims).\nThe applicant also requests that the Information Disclosure\nStatement previously filed by the applicant in application Ser.\nNo. 12/128,817 and the references considered by the examiner in said application be considered in this application.\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST\nThe invention described hereunder was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to\nthe provisions of Public Law #96-517 (35 U.S.C. 202) in\nwhich the Contractor has elected not to retain title.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThe instant disclosure generally relates to a mirror support\ncomprising a composite, the composite comprising a plurality of interlinked or inter-connected carbon nanotubes, and a\nmethod of making the mirror support.\nMirror supports for instruments requiring precision e.g.,\nfor large telescopes, often require a myriad of compromises.\nAn optimal mirror support would preferably include a low\nareal density, a high thermal conductivity, a low coefficient of\nthermal expansion, high stiffness, a high strength to weight\nratio, high reflectivity throughout much of the UV, IR and\nradio spectrum, and would be superconductive when cooled\nbelow 100\xc2\xb0 K.\nHowever, materials having the required stiffness often have\na large areal density. Materials having a low coefficient of\nthermal expansion often have relatively low strength to weigh\nratios and/or low thermal conductivity. Accordingly, there is\na need in the art for a mirror support which more closely\napproximates an optimal mirror support.\nIndividual carbon nanotubes may provide at least some of\nthe properties of a more optimal mirror support. Numerous\nreferences are directed to carbon nanotubes and there use in a\nvariety of applications. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,259,106\nto Jain (Jain-106) is generally directed to a circuitry sheet\ncomprising an electronic device layer stack containing electronic devices. Jain-106 discloses the use of a temporary\nsubstrate in which a suitable conductor material may also\ninclude graphite sheets, and conductive carbon nanotubes\nsheets, films and foils. Jain-106 also discloses the combination of this substrate with a stiffener.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,756,025; 6,756,026; 6,824,755; 6,939,\n525; 7,048,903; 7,052,666; 7,067,098; 7,097,820; and 7,115,\n864; and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004-0265209 and\n2005-0244326 to Colbert et al. (collectively referred to herein\nas Colbert) are generally directed to a single-wall carbon\nnanotubes purification process and more particularly to a\npurification process that comprises heating a single-wall carbon nanotube-containing felt under oxidizing conditions to\nremove the amorphous carbon deposits and other contaminating materials. The felt may be heated in an aqueous solution of an inorganic oxidant, such as nitric acid, a mixture of\nhydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid, or a potassium perman-\n\nganate to produce a high proportion of single-wall nanotubes\nthat are substantially free of other material.\nU.S. Pat. No. 7,264,990 to Rueckes et al. (Rueckes-990) is\ngenerally directed to nanotube films and articles, and methods\n5 of making the same. Rueckes-990 discloses conductive\narticles including an aggregate of nanotube segments in\nwhich the nanotube segments contact other nanotube segments to define a plurality of conductive pathways along the\narticle. The articles may be disposed on substrates, and may\n10\nform an electrical network of nanotubes within the article\nitself. Conductive articles may be made on a substrate by\nforming a nanotube fabric on the substrate, and defining a\npattern within the fabric in which the pattern corresponds to\nthe conductive article. According to Rueckes-990, nanotube\n15\nfabric may be formed by growing the nanotube fabric on the\nsubstrate using a catalyst, by depositing a solution of suspended nanotubes on the substrate, by spin-coating, by dipping a substrate into a solution of carbon nanotubes, or by\n20 spraying an aerosol having nanotubes onto a surface of a\nsubstrate.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,683,783 (Smalley-783) and its divisional\napplications 6,749,827, 6,949,237, 6,979,709, 6,986,876,\n7,008,604, 7041,620, 7,048,999, 7,087,207, 7,105,596,\n25 7,108,841, and 7,205,069 (collectively referred to as Smalley) are generally directed to membranes comprising an array\nof single-wall carbon nanotubes wherein the membrane is\nnanoporous. The Smalley references disclose a membrane\ncomprising a substantially two-dimensional array of a homo30 geneous population of single-walled nanotubes aggregated in\nsubstantially parallel orientation to form a monolayer extending in directions substantially perpendicular to the orientation\nof the individual nanotubes. Smalley discloses composite\nmaterials, defined as materials that are composed of two or\n35 more discrete constituents. According to Smalley, composites\ninclude a matrix, which serves to enclose the composite and\ngive it its bulk form, and a structural constituent, which determines the internal structure of the component. The matrix\ndeforms and distributes an applied stress to the structural\n40 constituent. Although composites are generally extremely\nstrong, their strength is generally anisotropic, being much\nless in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the composite material than any parallel direction. Smalley also discloses that composites formed in layers or in laminate strips\n45 are prone to delamination. Smalley discloses use of carbon\nnanotube structural constituents to improve the properties of\nconventional composite materials. One such example\ninvolves composites built-up of fibrous laminates impregnated and bonded with a polymer matrix material. Graphite\n50 fiber fabric layers bonded with an epoxy system is a wellknown example of such a composite. By using carbon nanotube ropes or fibers that exhibit a 3-D loopy structure added\nonly at the epoxy/graphite interfaces, resistance to delamination of the resulting laminar composite can be substantially\n55 increased. The carbon nanotube material can be dispersed in\nthe epoxy system before impregnation (or premixed into one\nof the reactive components thereof). The carbon nanotube\nmaterial can also be dispersed in a liquid carrier and sprayed\nor otherwise applied to the laminate as each graphite fabric\n60 layer is added.\nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0059452 to Debe et al.\n(Debe-452) is generally directed to a process for extending\nthe length of nanostructured support elements of thin film\nlayers. The processes involve the initial formation of nano65 structured support elements during a first annealing step, a\ncoating of material deposited on the nanostructured support\nelements, and a second annealing step wherein the initially\n\nUS 8,603,285 B1\n3\n\n4\n\nformed nanostructured support elements longitudinally\nmerely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of\nthe invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined\nextend.

Examples of doping materials include metals and/or metal containing compounds, metalloids (e.g.,\nboron) and/or metalloid containing compounds, combinations thereof, and the like.\nAs shown in FIG. 2, in an embodiment, the plurality of\ncarbon nanotubes 12 and 14 are dispersed within an interstitial material 18, preferably wherein at least one of the carbon\nnanotubes 12 are bonded to the interstitial material 18, either\ndirectly, indicated by arrow 24, or through a functional group\nindicated by arrow 26, or via bridging moiety 16, indicated by\narrow 28.\nIn an embodiment, at least a portion of the carbon nanotubes of the instant composite may further be aligned with\none-another. By aligned, it is meant that a plurality of carbon\nnanotubes, each having a minor axis parallel with the diameter of the tube, and a major axis perpendicular to the diameter\nof the tube, are oriented such that a portion of the carbon\nnanotubes has a major axis essentially parallel to the major\naxis of another carbon nanotube, in an amount greater than\nwould be present in a random distribution of carbon nanotubes. Accordingly, aligned carbon nanotubes do not require\nessentially all of the carbon nanotubes to be parallel to one\nanother, but merely requires alignment of more than would be\naligned in a random collection of carbon nanotubes under the\nsame set of conditions.\nAs shown in FIG. 3, a first layer of carbon nanotubes 304\nare arranged on a bottom substrate 302. An interstitial matrix\nmaterial 306 is applied to the carbon nanotubes 304. It should\nbe understood by one skilled in the art that the interstitial\nmatrix material 306, although depicted as a single layer atop\nthe carbon nanotubes 304 for the purposes of showing the\norder of assembly of the embodiment depicted in the figure,\nthat the interstitial matrix material 306 will fill the spaces\nbetween the carbon nanotubes 304. Optionally, a second layer\nof carbon nanotubes 304 and interstitial matrix material 306\nmay be applied atop the first layers as shown. A top substrate\n308 is placed upon the carbon nanotubes 304 and interstitial\nmatrix material 306. Force may be applied to the top substrate\n308 to compressed the carbon nanotubes 304 and interstitial\nmatrix material 306 as further described herein. An electric\npotential 310 may be applied to all of the layers to provide\nanodic bonding as described further below.\nIn an embodiment, at least two of the plurality of carbon\nnanotubes are bonded to each other using anodic bonding,\nfusion bonding, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, oxidation, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, combinations thereof, and the like.\nIn anodic bonding, the carbon nanotubes are bonded at\nelevated temperatures in the range from 100\xc2\xb0 C. to about 800\xc2\xb0\nC. by placing and preferably clamping a substrate comprising\nthe carbon nanotubes between two metal electrodes. An electric potential, preferably a DC potential greater than or equal\nto about 1 kV or higher is then applied between the electrodes\ncreating an electrical field, which penetrates the substrates.\nThe substrate comprises ions which are capable of migration\nwhen placed under the above DC potential. One substrate is\npreferably a glass that contains mobile ions, e.g., metal ions,\nsodium ions and/or ions that result from a doping compound,\nwhich at the elevated temperature are displaced from the\nbonding surface of the substrate by the applied electrical field.\n\n8\nThe depletion of these ions near the surface of the glass makes\nthe surface highly reactive with the surface of the other substrate, which preferably includes silicon, and/or other similarly chemically active material and thus forming a solid\n5 chemical bond between the carbon nanotubes and/or between\nthe carbon nanotubes and the substrate.\nIn an embodiment, a substrate may be prepared for anodic\nbonding by patterning, etching, oxidation, and/or the like, and\nthen the carbon nanotubes may be deposited onto the sub10\nstrate. One or more interstitial matrix layers, doping material\nlayers, and/or the like may be added, as may one or more\nadditional layers of carbon nanotubes. In an embodiment, the\ncarbon nanotubes my then be aligned. The layer of carbon\n15 nanotubes and the interstitial matrix may then be sandwiched\nbetween a second substrate, which may or may not include a\ndoping material. The layers may then be compressed and an\nelectric potential applied thereto. The temperature of the\nmaterials may also be increased. After a period of time, a\n20 carbon nanotube composite is produced.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include fusion bonding, wherein the substrates are first forced into intimate contact by applying a contact force. Once in contact the substrates hold together due to atomic attraction forces (e.g., Van\n25 der Waals forces), which are strong enough to allow the\nbonded substrates to be handled. The substrates are then\nplaced in a furnace and annealed at high temperature, after\nwhich a solid bond is formed between the substrates.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include an evaporation\n30\nstep, wherein the substrate is placed in a high vacuum chamber at a temperature wherein a crucible or other container\ncontaining the material is deposited, which may be a precursor of a functional group and/or a precursor of the bridging\n35 moiety. A heating source is used to heat the crucible causing\nthe material to evaporate and condense on all exposed cool\nsurfaces of the vacuum chamber and substrate. Typical\nsources of heating are: E-beam, resistive heating, RF-inductive heating, and the like. In some systems, the substrate can\n40 be heated during deposition to alter the composition/stress of\nthe deposited material.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include a low-pressure\nchemical vapor deposition step (LPCVD), which may be\nperformed in a reactor at temperatures up to about 900\xc2\xb0 C. and\n45 beyond. The deposited film is a product of a chemical reaction\nbetween the source gases supplied to the reactor.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include an oxidation\nstep, wherein the substrate is placed in a high temperature\nfurnace in which oxygen or water vapor is introduced. At\n50 elevated temperature the oxygen will diffuse into the substrate at high rate causing at least a partial oxidation of the\nmaterial. It is possible to speed up the process further by\noperating at elevated furnace pressures.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include a plasma\n55 enhanced chemical vapor deposition step (PECVD), which\nmay be performed in a reactor at temperatures up to about\n700\xc2\xb0 C. and beyond. The deposited film is a product of a\nchemical reaction between the source gases supplied to the\nreactor. A plasma is generated in the reactor to increase the\n60 energy available for the chemical reaction at a given temperature.\nIn an embodiment, the process may include spin casting,\nwherein a substrate is held by vacuum on a chuck. The material to be deposited is dissolved in a solvent. The solution is\n65 applied to the substrate, which is then rotated at high speed.\nThe rotation spreads the solution evenly over the surface and\nalso causes some of the solvent to evaporate leaving a thin\n\nUS 8,603,285 B1\n9\n\n10\n\nfilm of material on the substrate.
