b'Ag.air\n\nService\n\nAgricultural\naerial application--"ag-air"\nfor short--is\na\nbillion dollar industry in the United States, involving\nmore than 10,000 aircraft spreading insecticides,\nherbicides,\nfertilizer,\nseed and other materials over\nmillions of acres of farmland.\nIt is an extremely\nvaried\nindustry and no two ag-air businesses\nare exactly alike.\nAn operator may have one airplane or several. He may\nspray a 20-acre field one day and a 500-acre field the\nnext. The target field may be close to his base or some\ndistance away, a factor in airplane fuel expenditure.\nCrops treated differ from one job to the next, as do the\nmaterials applied\nand costs of both materials and fuel\nchange rapidly. In this unique, multivariable\nbusiness\natmosphere,\nag-air operators\nface unusual problems.\nFor\nexample, it is difficult for an operator to estimate costs\naccurately\nand thus decide what to charge, or to\ndetermine\nwhich airplane can handle which assignment\nmost efficiently.\nTo fill an informational\nneed in the industry, Econ,\nInc., a Princeton,\nNew Jersey economics\nresearch firm is\nproviding a computerized\nservice designed to improve\n\n_i_i+iii_iiiiiii+_i_ii!iiiii+i+i_iiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiii_i_ii_i_i_iiiiiiiiii!i\n\n82\n\nbusiness efficiency\nin two key decision-making\nareas:\nchoice of aircraft and determination\nof charge rates based\non realistic operating cost data. The Ag-air Cost\nEffectiveness\nAnalysis Service is a spinoff from a NASA\nstudy--performed\nby Econ--intended\nto help NASA\nchart a program of technology\ndevelopment\nin areas\nmost beneficial to operators\nand manufacturers\nof\nagricultural\naircraft.\nIn the course of the study, Econ built a comprehensive\ndata base on worldwide\nag-air operations,\nincluding\naircraft costs, materials costs, job times and many other\nvariables.\nUpdated and expanded,\nthis information\nserved as the keystone for Econ\' s economic\nanalysis\nservice. Econ asks subscribers\nto fill out detailed forms\ndescribing the characteristics\nof aircraft in service or\nplanned, together with information\nabout the operator\' s\napplications--types\nof crops treated, materials used,\nfield sizes, hours flown and a variety of other factors.\nFor a moderate fee, Econ supplies a custom-tailored\ncomputer\nprintout which allows easy computation\nof\ntime, cost and charge for a specific job. Also provided is\na cost/productivity\ncomparison\nof various types of\nag-aircraft,\nenabling the operator to select the craft best\nsuited to his particular business mix.\n\n'
