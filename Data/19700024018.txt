No. 842,171\n9 Claim& (Ci. 2 0 1 2\n4-.)\n(Granted under Title 3 , US.Code ( 9 2 , see. 266)\n5\n15)\nThe invention described herein may be manufactured\nand used by o r for the Government of the United States\nof America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon o r therefor.\nThis invention relates generally to a travelled surface\nlight and more particularly to an aircraft runway light\ncapable of being seen from the air and of being struck\nby landing gear of airplanes on landing and takeoffs without causing adverse structural effects to the airplane and\nwithout causing damage to the light.\nA great deal of effort has been devoted to the improvement of runway lighting in order to reduce the\nminimum visibility requirements which currently impose\na severe limitation on flight operations in inclement\nweather. The results of some recent flight tests have\nindicated that, when lights are installed along the runway\ncenter line in the landing area, most aircraft are capable\nof landing safely under conditions that approach zero\nceiling and zero visibility. Because of the favorable results obtained during these tests, a great interest in installing runway center line lighting on all major runways\nhas developed. The button type runway lights which\nhave been used heretofore protrude from the runway\nsurface and can cause adverse effects on the airplane\nstructure when struck by the aircraft landing gear on\ntakeoff and landing. Furthermore, the illumination\nwhich these button type lights produce on the runway\nsurface is somewhat inadequate. Another disadvantage\nof the button t y p e lights is that runways provided with\nthem cannot have snow removed by snowplows as the\nplows would damage these lights. A still another disadvantage of the button type lights is that reevaluation\nof runways from which high speed jet aircraft operate\nindicates highly adverse structural effects produced on\nthese aircraft by striking protruding objects such as button\ntype lights.\nAccordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide\na light for location on and illumination of a vehicular\ntravelled surface.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a runway\nlight capable of giving substantial illumination to the\nrunway surface under poor visibility weather conditions.\nA further object of the invention is to provide a runway\nlight that will not produce adverse structural effects on\naircraft striking or running over the light.\nStill another object of the invention is to provide a\nrunway light which may be used on runways from which\nsnow is to be removed by snowplows.\nAnother still further object of the invention is to provide a runway light that will not be damaged if struck\nby an aircraft during takeoff, landing or taxiing.\nA still fcrther object of the invention is to provide a\nrunway light that will not lose its lighting intensity due\nto the blackening caused by jet aircraft operating on the\nrunway.\nOne still further object of the invention is to provide\na runway light that will provide adequate illumination\n\neven after a particular accumulation o snow on the mnf\nway surface.\nGenerally speaking, the foregoing objects as well as\nothers are accomplished in accordance with this invention\n6 by providing a light unit capable of emitting light to mark\nand illuminate the runway surface and of folding flush\nwith the runway surface when struck by an airplane landr\ning wheel without causing any adverse effects o damage\nto the light unit or the wheel striking the light.\nA more complete understanding of the invention and\n10\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily\nappreciated as the same becomes better understood by\nreference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings\n15 wherein:\nFig. 1 is a side elevational view, partly broken away,\nof the runway light unit in an elevated position.\nFig. 2 is a schematic elevational view of the runway\nlight unit in an erected condition; and\n20\nFig. 3 is a perspective view of the runway light unit\nin a retracted position.\nReferring now to the drawings wherein like reference\nnumerals designate identical or corresponding parts\nthroughout the several views, and more particularly to\n25 Fig. 1 whereon the runway light unit, generally indicated\nby the reference numeral 10 is shown as consisting essentially of a reflector carriage 11, top plate 12, and a receptacle 13. The receptacle 13 is generally cup shaped and\nadapted to be buried into the ground or within the run30 way. The receptacle houses a lighting unit 14 and is\nprovided with a lip 15 which supports the top plate 12.\nThe lighting unit may be any type which will give adequate illumination to the surface of the runway. The\nreceptacle 13 may be provided with a drain 16, as seen\n36 on Fig. 2, which enables rain, snow and any other water\nfinding its way into the receptacle to escape and thereby\nkeep the receptacle 13 free of water.\nThe top plate 12, as seen on Fig. 2 is preferably a\ncircular disc adapted t o be rigidly secured to receptacle\n40 13 by means of bolts 18 positioned within corresponding\nclearance holes 19 formed along the periphery at predetermined intervals in the top plate 12 and top holes\n20 in the lip 15 of the receptacle. The upper surface\nof top plate 12 is flush with the runway surface.\n1\nThe top plate 12 has an opening 2 formed therein\n45\nthrough which light passes from the lighting means 14.\nThe top plate 12 has grooves, or indentations, 22 formed\ntherein, as seen on Fig. 1, which are adaptable to receive the reflector carriage 11. The reflector carriage is\n60 pivotally connected at one end to the top plate 12 by a\nhinge pin 23. The hinge pin extends through corresponding apertures formed in the carriage 11 and an\naperture 24 formed in the top plate 12. The carriage\n11 is capable of being elevated, as seen in Figs. 1 and 2,\n55 and retracted, as seen in Fig. 3. The reflector carnage\n11 in a retracted position is flush with the top plate 12\nand runway surface 17.\nThe reflector carriage 11 consists of three parallel\nfrontal links 25 which are rigidly connected to a cover\n60 plate 26 by means of screws 27,as seen in Fig. 1, thereby\nforming the top flush surface of the reflector carriage in\na retracted position, as seen in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig, 1\nthe grooves 22 formed in the top plate 12 receive the\nfrontal links 25 when the reflector carriage 11 is in a\n65 retracted position thereby forming a flush surface with\nthe top plate. As seen in Fig. 2 a frontal link extension\n28 is rigidly secured to one of the frontal links and projects downwardly therefrom. A reflector plate 29 is\nsecured to the underside of the coverplate 26 in a man70 ner to project downwardly and outwardly so that a line\ndrawn perpendicularly from the outermost edge of the\ncoverplate 26 will intersect the lowest .point on the re-\n\na,oa4,7a15\n\n3\n\n4\n\nflector 29. A brace 30 may be rigidly secured to the\nused by aircraft landing from either direction on the\nreflector 29 and coverplate 26 to give the structure added\nsame runway by retracting one group of lights.\nstrength and maintain the reflector in a fixed position.\nThe lighting means employed in the present invention\nA spring 31 is attached a t one end to the lower end of\nfor lighting runway surfaces may also be used to light\nthe frontal link extension 28 and at the other end to the 5 other vehicularly traveled surfaces, such for example as,\nunder side of the top plate 12.
