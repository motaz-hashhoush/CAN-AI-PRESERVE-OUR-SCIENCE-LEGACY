Despite an\nassessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and\nboundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice\nthinner than $2 m and underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about $2 m.\nIn the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than\n25\xe2\x80\x9330 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and\nrates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and\nmore than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions\nof fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack\nice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic\nice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller\ndifferences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the\nOcean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.\nCitation: Johnson, M., et al.

Assessment of model performance regarding sea ice\nwould include, at least, comparisons with observations of the\ninterrelated sea ice characteristics of motion, strain, deformation, concentration, age, and thickness. Evaluation of\nmodeled sea ice behavior, however, is limited by incomplete\nobservational data across the scales that characterize sea ice\ngrowth, melt, motion, and deformation.\n[3] With the beginning of the satellite record in the late\n1970s, sea ice concentration became widely available as\na product derived from passive microwave brightness temperatures [Gloersen et al., 1992]. However, estimating sea\nice thickness remotely is not straightforward although procedures for estimating thickness as well as velocity from the\nsatellite record have been developed [Laxon et al., 2003;\nKwok et al., 2004]. Thickness is important to probability\nestimates of sea ice survival over the melt season [Untersteiner,\n1961] and its distribution appears to be undergoing rapid\nchanges [Wadhams, 1990; Rothrock et al., 1999; Wadhams\nand Davis, 2000].\n[4] The focus of this paper is the ability of six coupled\nArctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP)\nmodels to simulate sea ice thickness and to identify trends\n\nC00D13\n\n1 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nand differences among the AOMIP model ice thickness\nresults by comparing them with the broad range of derived\nsea ice thickness data that is now available. The observational\ndata include (1) gridded ice thickness derived from the\nICESat satellite for 10 campaigns from fall and winter 2004\nto 2008; (2) ice thickness transect data from electromagnetic\nairborne measurements (2001\xe2\x80\x932009); (3) ice draft from 24\nmoored instruments equipped with upward looking sonars\n(ULS) and ice profiling sonars (IPS) from 1992 to 2008 from\nthe Beaufort Sea, Fram Strait, and the Greenland Sea; (4) ice\ndraft from submarines equipped with upward looking sonar\n(1975\xe2\x80\x932000); (5) ice thickness at drill holes through sea ice\nfrom 187 sites taken in spring from 1982 to 1986 across the\nSiberian marginal seas; and (6) fast ice thickness from 51\nRussian coastal stations (1998\xe2\x80\x932009).\n[5] While one advantage of using model results can be the\navailability of ice freeboard, draft, snow depth, and similar\nvariables to be compared directly with observations, our\noriginal AOMIP experiment focused on ice thickness. With\nsix models and six data sets, the need to simplify our\napproach became apparent. All data were converted to thickness as described below. A range of thickness measurements\nis important to assess model performance. When and where\nice is thin and/or in low concentration there is potential for\nthermodynamic ice growth and/or high speed drift.\n[6] Because of differences among model forcing and\nparameterizations, our goal is to identify differences between\nmodeled and observed sea ice thickness as a foundation for\nmodel improvement. However, the complexity of isolating\nspecific model attributes from among the full suite of parameterizations, forcing, and boundary conditions is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. Indeed, Kim et al. [2006] have shown\nthat model parameters need to be varied simultaneously to\ntune models to optimal values and identifying the most\nimportant parameters is \xe2\x80\x9cnot trivial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2. Summary of Previous Work\n[7] Bourke and Garrett [1987] first reported on the mean\nice thickness distribution in the Arctic Ocean from data taken\nbetween 1960 and 1982. Rothrock et al. [1999] showed that\nthe mean ice draft in most of the central portion of the Arctic\nOcean had declined from 3.1 m in 1958\xe2\x80\x931976 to 1.8 m in the\n1990s (a 40% decrease). The submarine ice draft data in the\ndata release area (DRA) were fit with multiple linear regression expressions of location, time and season by Rothrock\net al. [2008] for the period 1975\xe2\x80\x932000. They found the\nannual mean ice draft declined from a peak of 3.42 m in 1980\nto a minimum of 2.29 m in 2000. ICESat ice thickness estimates for 2003\xe2\x80\x932008 for the same area of the Arctic Ocean\nas represented by the regression equations show a continued\ndecline to less than 1.0 m in the DRA in the fall of 2007.\nWadhams and Davis [2000] found a 43% decline in the ice\ndraft at the pole from 1976 to 1996. Winsor [2001], however,\nfound no trend in six cruises between the pole and the\nBeaufort Sea from the 1990s. Airborne electromagnetic (EM)\nsurveys by Haas et al. [2009] showed a thinning of 20% in\nthe region of the North Pole between 1991 and 2004, with a\nsharp drop to only 0.9 m in the summer of 2007 related to the\nreplacement of old ice by first-year ice.\n[8] Direct comparison of model results to observed sea\nice thickness has been limited because pan-Arctic sea ice\n\nC00D13\n\nthickness data were not widely available at useful resolutions. The lack of observational data was carefully circumvented by Gerdes and K\xc3\xb6berle [2007] who compared\nresults from several IPCC modeled outputs against sea ice\nthickness from a hindcast model (AWI1) positively evaluated against other AOMIP models. They concluded that\ndifferences among the IPCC models were likely due to the\ndifferent effective wind stress forcing and the coupling\nmethodologies with the ocean, a conclusion consistent with\nstudies showing that atmospheric forcing fields essentially\ndrive the results of sea ice simulations [Walsh and Crane,\n1992; Bitz et al., 2002; Hunke and Holland, 2007] more so\nthan the details of the sea ice model itself [Flato et al., 2004].\n[9] Recently however, several studies have compared\nmodel results with available sea ice thickness data sets to\ncalibrate, validate and improve sea ice representation in the\nregional and global models. For example, Koldunov et al.\n[2010] analyzed Arctic sea ice parameters simulated by the\nfully coupled climate model ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute\nfor Meteorology Hamburg Primitive Equation Ocean Model\n(MPI-OM) for the period from 1980 to 1999 and compared\nthem with observations collected during field programs and\nby satellites. It was found that the major biases in sea\nice thickness arise from errors in the ECHAM5/MPI-OM\natmosphere and associated errors in surface forcing fields\n(especially wind stress). In contrast, the identical coupled\nocean\xe2\x80\x93ice model, when driven by NCEP\xe2\x80\x93NCAR reanalysis\nfields showed increased skill in its ice and ocean circulation\nparameters. However, common to both model runs was too\nstrong ice export through the Fram Strait and a substantially\nbiased heat content in the interior of the Arctic Ocean.\n[10] An individual model evaluation using sea ice thickness observational data is a paper by Schweiger et al. [2011]\n(this section). Practically all available sources of sea ice\nthickness were used for comparison with Pan-Arctic IceOcean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) simulated results. It was concluded that in general PIOMAS\nrelative to observations, appears to overestimate the thickness of thin ice and underestimate the thickness of thick ice.\nIn this paper we are able to compare PIOMAS output with\nother models and to evaluate them based on several data sets\nincluding coastal station data and drill hole data.\n[11] For sea ice concentration, satellite-derived values\nwere compared with several AOMIP models to show that\nthey reproduced wintertime observations reasonably well\nwhen ice concentration was near 100% but underestimated\nthe September ice concentration minimum [Johnson et al.,\n2007]. The variability among model results exceeded the\nvariability among four satellite-derived observational data\nsets suggesting the need to further constrain model performance and reduce sensitivity to prescribed forcing.\n[12] Assessment of the ice age-thickness relationship using\nmodel results shows that for Northern Hemisphere\xe2\x80\x93wide\naverages the notion of thicker ice being older is reasonable at\ndecadal scales, but for specific years and at scales less than\nhundreds of kilometers, ice age is not a good proxy for ice\nthickness [Hunke and Bitz, 2009]. At interannual timescales,\nthe Northern Hemisphere\xe2\x80\x93averaged ice age is not well correlated with any of the three common ice descriptors: thickness, area or volume.\n[13] This paper is organized as follows. Sections 3 and 4\ndescribe the different AOMIP model characteristics and the\n\n2 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\ndata sets against which they are compared. Section 5 on the\ndata biases follows. The methods used to prepare the model\nand observational data are then discussed in section 6. Next\nwe compare model results and data using Taylor diagrams\nmodified to retain units of ice thickness residuals and modeldata correlations (section 7). Linear regressions between the\nmodel and observed data are also presented and analyzed\n(section 8). This is followed by a comparison of modeled ice\ngrowth rates to empirically derived thermodynamic ice\ngrowth rates and observed sea ice growth rates taken from\nselect coastal stations (section 9). A discussion and summary\nare last in sections 10 and 11.\n\n3. Models\n[14] The AOMIP project and its models are described by\nHolloway et al. [2007] with considerable detail to be found\non the AOMIP Web site (http://www.whoi.edu/projects/\nAOMIP/). The six models used in this paper are from the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2)), Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC), Institute of Numerical Mathematics Ocean\nModel (INMOM) Russian Academy of Science, the Naval\nPostgraduate School Arctic Modeling Effort (NAME), the\nNational Oceanography Centre Southampton (ORCA), and\nthe PIOMAS of the University of Washington (hereinafter\nUW model). Specific sea ice parameters for these models are\nshown in Table 1 and discussed below.\n3.1. ECCO2\n[15] The Arctic domain of ECCO2 uses a regional configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\ngeneral circulation model (MITgcm) [Marshall et al., 1997;\nLosch et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2011]. The domain has\nsouthern boundaries at $55\x14 N in the Atlantic and Pacific\nsectors. The grid is locally orthogonal with horizontal grid\nspacing of approximately 18 km. There are 50 vertical levels\nranging in thickness from 10 m near the surface to approximately 450 m at a maximum model depth of 6150 m. The\nmodel employs the rescaled vertical coordinate \xe2\x80\x9cz*\xe2\x80\x9d of\nAdcroft and Campin [2004] and the partial cell formulation\nof Adcroft et al. [1997] which permits accurate representation\nof the bathymetry. Bathymetry is from the S2004 (W. Smith,\nunpublished manuscript, 2004) blend of the Smith and\nSandwell [1997] and the General Bathymetric Charts of the\nOceans (GEBCO) 1 arc min bathymetric grid. The nonlinear\nequation of state of Jackett and McDougall [1995] is used.\nVertical mixing follows Large et al. [1994]. A seventh-order\nmonotonicity-preserving advection scheme [Daru and\nTenaud, 2004] is employed and there is no explicit horizontal diffusivity. Horizontal viscosity follows Leith [1996] but\nis modified to sense the divergent flow [Fox-Kemper and\nMenemenlis, 2008].\n[16] The ocean model is coupled to the MITgcm sea ice\nmodel described by Losch et al. [2010]. Ice mechanics follow\na viscous-plastic rheology and the ice momentum equations\nare solved numerically using the line successive overrelaxation (LSOR) solver of Zhang and Hibler [1997]. Ice\nthermodynamics are represented using a zero heat capacity\nformulation and seven thickness categories. Salt rejection\nduring sea-ice formation is explicitly treated with a subgrid\nsalt plume parameterization [Nguyen et al., 2009]. The model\n\nC00D13\n\nincludes prognostic variables for snow thickness and for sea\nice salinity. Boundary conditions are monthly and taken from\nthe global optimized ECCO2 solution [Menemenlis et al.,\n2008]. Initial conditions are from the World Ocean Atlas\n2005 [Antonov et al., 2006; Locarnini et al., 2006]. Atmospheric boundary conditions are from the Japanese 25 year\nReanalysis Project (JRA25) [Onogi et al., 2007]. The integration period is from 1992 to 2008. A comprehensive\nassessment of the solution used in this study is given by\nNguyen et al. [2011] where the model parameters are optimized from 1992 to 2004 using ice thickness data from\nsubmarine and mooring ULS, sea ice concentration and\nvelocity, and ocean hydrography.\n3.2. GSFC\n[17] The GSFC model is based on the generalized Princeton Ocean Model (POM) which can accommodate s coordinates (the original POM), but also z levels and a mixture of\ns and z levels, as the vertical coordinate [Blumberg and\nMellor, 1987; Mellor et al., 2002]. The results presented\nhere are from a version which uses only z levels. The model\ndomain covers the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic and\nextending to 15\x14 S, with a horizontal resolution of 0.35\xe2\x80\x93\n0.45\x14 . Vertical resolution is 26 levels ranging from 6 to\n500 m layer depths. Transport at the open boundaries is\ndefined by an inflow of 0.8 Sv through Bering Strait, which\nequals the amount that exits through the model\xe2\x80\x99s southern\nboundary at approximately 15\x14 S. Monthly T and S are\nrestored at the open boundary buffer zones, but no other\nrestoring is used in the GSFC model.\n[18] The vertical mixing coefficients are determined from\n2.5-layer turbulence closure [Mellor and Yamada, 1974]\nwhich requires computation of the kinetic energy and kinetic\nenergy times mixing length as additional prognostic quantities. The ocean model is coupled to a two-layer dynamicthermodynamic snow-ice model where sea ice is described as\na generalized viscous medium [Mellor and Kantha, 1989;\nH\xc3\xa4kkinen and Mellor, 1992; H\xc3\xa4kkinen and Geiger, 2000].\nIce-ocean momentum, heat and salt exchange is described by\na flow over a rough surface based on the theory of Yaglom\nand Kader [1974]. The solar radiation can penetrate below\nthe ocean surface to distribute shortwave solar heating. P-E is\nfrom Rasmusson and Mo [1996] and the Sellers formula as\nused by Parkinson and Washington [1979] for shortwave\nradiation. The model uses NCEP wind stress with results\nfrom a cold start at January 1948 using daily NCEP Reanalysis data.\n3.3. INMOM\n[19] The INMOM is a \xe2\x80\x9cterrain-following\xe2\x80\x9d s coordinate\nocean model [Moshonkin et al., 2011]. The global version of\nthe INMOM with low spatial resolution is used as the oceanic\ncomponent of the IPCC climate model INMOM [Volodin\net al., 2010] presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change [2008]. The present version of the model\ncovers the North Atlantic (open boundary at approximately\n20\x14 S), Arctic Ocean, and Bering Sea regions including the\nMediterranean and Black Seas. A rotation of the model grid\navoids the problem of converging meridians over the Arctic\nOcean. The model North Pole is located at the geographical\nequator, 120\x14 W. The 1/4\x14 horizontal eddy-permitting resolution is used. There are 27 unevenly spaced vertical s levels.\n\n3 of 21\n\nMellor\n\nMY2.5\n\nLin et al.

The vertical viscosity and diffusion coefficients\nare calculated by Monin-Obukhov-Kochergin [Kochergin,\n1987] parameterization. The elastic-viscous-plastic dynamicthermodynamic sea ice model [Hunke, 2001; Yakovlev,\n2009] is coupled to the ocean model. Surface forcing is\nfrom the CORE forcing data set [Large and Yeager, 2004].\nThe surface turbulent fluxes are calculated using the bulk\nformulae. A climatological monthly runoff from CORE is\napplied along the coasts. Surface salinity is restored toward\nmonthly climatology with a relaxation scale of approximately 12 days both for the open ocean and under sea ice.\nTemperature and salinity restoring toward monthly climatology is used at the open boundaries.\n3.4. ORCA\n[20] The ORCA model is a global z level OGCM based on\nthe NEMO ocean code [Madec, 2006] and uses the global\ntripolar ORCA grid at 1/4\x14 horizontal resolution. The\neffective resolution is $27.75 km at the equator, increasing\nto 6\xe2\x80\x9312 km in zonal and $3 km in meridional directions in\nthe Arctic Ocean. Thus the model resolves large eddies in the\nArctic Ocean and \xe2\x80\x9cpermits\xe2\x80\x9d smaller ones. The configuration\nwas developed by the DRAKKAR project and is described\nby Bernard et al. [2006] as the ORCA025-G70 configuration. The version of the model used here has a higher vertical\nresolution (64 vertical levels) than the ORCA025-G70, with\nthicknesses of the model levels ranging from $6 m near the\nsurface to $204 m at 6000 m. The \xe2\x80\x9cpartial step\xe2\x80\x9d topography\n[Adcroft et al., 1997; Pacanowski and Gnanadesikan, 1998]\nis used, whereby the bottom cell is variable and more able to\nrepresent small topographic slopes near the Arctic shelves,\nresulting in the more realistic along-shelf flow [e.g., Bernard\net al., 2006; Penduff et al., 2007]. The ocean model is\ncoupled asynchronously to the sea ice model every five\noceanic time steps through a nonlinear quadratic drag law\n[Timmermann et al., 2005].\n[21] The sea ice model LIM2 [Fichefet and Morales\nMaqueda, 1997] is based on the viscous-plastic (VP) rheology with an elliptic yield curve [Hibler, 1979] and Semtner\xe2\x80\x99s\ntwo-layer ice, one-layer snow thermodynamics [Semtner,\n1976]. The latter is updated with sea ice thickness distribution [Fichefet and Morales Maqueda, 1997]. Other features\nof the model are the positive-definite, second-order, second\nmoments conserving advection scheme [Prather, 1986], ice\nthickness\xe2\x80\x93dependent albedo [Payne, 1972], lateral ice thermodynamics and a simple snow-ice formation mechanism\ndue to hydrostatic imbalance [Fichefet and Morales\nMaqueda, 1997]. Sea ice salinity is taken equal to 4, the\naverage value of sea ice salinity in the Central Arctic Ocean.\nHeat exchange between the ocean and sea ice is calculated as\na product from the departure of surface temperature from the\nsalinity-dependent freezing point and friction velocity at the\nice-ocean interface. Solar radiation penetrates snow-free ice,\nincreasing latent heat storage in brine pockets [Fichefet and\nMorales Maqueda, 1997].\n[22] Surface forcing is provided by the DRAKKAR Forcing Set 3 [Brodeau et al., 2010]. This data set is a combination of precipitation and downward longwave and shortwave\nradiation fields from the CORE forcing data set [Large and\n\nC00D13\n\nYeager, 2004] and 10 m wind, 2 m air temperature, and\n2 m specific humidity from the ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis\nproduct. The turbulent air/sea and air/ice fluxes are calculated by the model using the bulk formulae [Large and\nYeager, 2004]. A climatological monthly runoff [Dai and\nTrenberth, 2002] is applied along the coasts. Surface salinity is restored toward monthly climatology with a relaxation scale of 180 days for the open ocean and 12 days under\nsea ice.\n3.5. NAME\n[23] The pan-Arctic coupled ice-ocean model used in\nthis study consists of a Hibler-type sea ice model [Zhang and\nHibler, 1997] coupled to a regional adaptation of the Parallel\nOcean Program (POP) [Smith et al., 1992; Smith and Gent,\n2002]. The sea ice model employs a viscous-plastic rheology, two ice thickness categories (mean ice thickness and\nopen water), the zero-layer approximation of heat conduction\nthrough ice and a simplified surface energy budget [Zhang\net al., 1999; Maslowski et al., 2000]. The ice strength is\nparameterized in this model as a function of the mean grid\ncell ice thickness, which tends to underestimate ice drift and\ndeformation [Maslowski and Lipscomb, 2003; Kwok et al.,\n2008]. The ocean model is a z coordinate ocean model with\nan implicit free surface and 45 vertical levels, with layer\nthickness ranging from 5 m near the surface to 300 m at\ndepth.\n[24] The model domain includes all sea ice covered oceans\nand marginal seas of the Northern Hemisphere, extending to\n$30\x14 N in the North Pacific and to $45\x14 N in the North\nAtlantic. Both components of the coupled model use identical horizontal grid configured at 1/12\x14 ($9 km) in a rotated\nspherical coordinate system to eliminate the North Pole singularity. The model lateral boundaries are solid and no mass\nflux is allowed through them, however, a virtual annual cycle\nsalt flux is prescribed for most major rivers as a function of\nriver run-off. Surface layer (0\xe2\x80\x935 m) temperature and salinity\nare restored toward monthly climatology (PHC) [Steele et al.,\n2001] on timescales of 365 and 120 days, respectively.\n[25] The model was forced with daily average atmospheric\nfields (downward longwave and shortwave radiation, surface\nair temperature, specific humidity, wind velocity and stress)\nfrom the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF) 1979\xe2\x80\x931993 reanalysis and 1994\xe2\x80\x932004\noperational products. Additional details of model configuration, initialization, and integrations are given by Maslowski\net al. [2004, 2008].\n3.6. UW\n[26] The UW model is the coupled PIOMAS, a regional\nversion of the global Parallel Ocean and Ice Model (POIM)\n[Zhang and Rothrock, 2003]. The sea ice model is the multicategory thickness and enthalpy distribution (TED) sea ice\nmodel [Zhang and Rothrock, 2001; Hibler, 1980]. It employs\na teardrop plastic rheology [Zhang and Rothrock, 2005], a\nmechanical redistribution function for ice ridging [Thorndike\net al., 1975; Hibler, 1980], and a line successive relaxation\ndynamics model to solve the ice momentum equation [Zhang\nand Hibler, 1997]. The TED ice model also includes a snow\nthickness distribution model following Flato and Hibler\n[1995]. TED has 12 categories each for ice thickness, ice\nenthalpy, and snow depth. The centers of the 12 ice thickness\n\n5 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\ncategories are 0, 0.26, 0.71, 1.46, 2.61, 4.23, 6.39, 9.10,\n12.39, 16.24, 20.62, and 25.49 m. The ocean model is based\non the POP developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory\n[Smith et al., 1992]. The model domain of PIOMAS covers\nthe Northern Hemisphere north of 48\x14 N. The POP ocean\nmodel has been modified to incorporate open boundary\nconditions [Zhang and Steele, 2007] so that PIOMAS is able\nto be one-way nested to a global POIM [Zhang, 2005] with\nopen boundary conditions along 49\x14 N. The PIOMAS finite\ndifference grid is based on a generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system with the \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Pole\xe2\x80\x9d of the model\ngrid placed in Greenland. The model horizontal resolution\nranges from 6 to 75 km with a mean resolution of 22 km for\nthe Arctic, Barents, Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Sea, and\nBaffin Bay. The POP ocean model has 30 vertical levels of\nvarying thicknesses to resolve surface layers and bottom\ntopography. The first 13 levels are in the upper 100 m and the\nupper six levels are each 5 m thick. The model bathymetry is\nobtained by merging the IBCAO (International Bathymetric\nChart of the Arctic Ocean) data set and the ETOPO5 (Earth\nTopography Five Minute Gridded Elevation) data set [see\nHolland, 2000]. PIOMAS is forced by daily NCEP/NCAR\nreanalysis [Kalnay et al., 1996] surface forcing fields, i.e.,\n10 m surface winds, 2 m surface air temperature (SAT),\nspecific humidity, precipitation, evaporation, downwelling\nlongwave radiation, sea level pressure, and cloud fraction.\nCloud fraction and SAT are used to calculate downwelling\nshortwave radiation following Parkinson and Washington\n[1979]. Model forcing also includes river runoff of freshwater in the Arctic Ocean. Climatological river runoff\n(i.e., no interannual variability) is provided as in the work\nof Hibler and Bryan [1987]. The calculations of surface\nmomentum and radiation fluxes follow Zhang and Rothrock\n[2003]. No climate restoring is allowed. No data assimilation\nis performed for this study, although PIOMAS is able to\nassimilate ice concentration and sea surface temperature data.\n\n4. Observational Data\n[27] Ice thickness from models is compared with thickness\nderived from freeboard (ICESat), indirect measurements\nof thickness (airborne electromagnetic), thickness computed\nfrom ice draft (moorings and submarines), and thickness\nmeasured directly (drill holes). Much of the data used in\nthis study is available from the new Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record [Lindsay, 2010]. The CDR has\nsummary statistics for moorings, submarines, aircraft, and\nsatellite measurements of ice draft and ice thickness. The\nsummary statistics include mean, minimum, maximum, and\nstandard deviation of the measurement as well as the full\nprobability density distribution. There are currently over\n3000 samples in the archive which can be accessed along\nwith documentation and metadata at http://psc.apl.washington.\nedu/sea_ice_cdr/.\n4.1. ICESat Campaigns\n[28] The Arctic Ocean sea ice thickness grid with 25 \xc3\x82\n25 km resolution is shown (Figure 1a) for 2004\xe2\x80\x932008 and\nfive fall and five winter ICESat campaigns [Kwok et al.,\n2009]. The duration, start and end dates of the fall and winter campaigns are variable (Table 2) with a typically three to\n\nC00D13\n\nfour month separation between the fall and winter campaigns.\nThe five fall campaigns start between 24 September and\n25 October and end between 8\xe2\x80\x9327 November. Winter campaigns start between 17 February and 12 March and end\nbetween 21 March and 14 April.\n[29] The ICESat thickness data are derived from freeboard\n(distance above the water line to top of the snow cover)\nobtained from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System\n(GLAS). The methodology for determining freeboard, snow\ndepth, and ice thickness from ICESat\xe2\x80\x99s 70 m footprint is\ngiven by Kwok et al. [2007, 2009]. The empirical relationship\nbetween thickness and freeboard for the first year (FY) ice in\nlate winter is discussed by Alexandrov et al. [2010]. Satellite\ngrid point values were computed and a 50 km Gaussian\nsmoothing applied. The satellite hole is filled using an\ninterpolation procedure described by Kwok et al. [2009]. The\ngridded ICESat ice thickness estimates are available at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory at http://rkwok.jpl.nasa.gov/icesat/\nindex.html.\n4.2. Electromagnetic Airborne Soundings\n[30] Thickness data were obtained using EM induction\nsounding that computes the distance to the ice/water interface\nby evaluating the amplitude and phase of a secondary EM\nfield induced by eddy currents in the seawater. With airborne\nmeasurements, the height of the EM instrument above the\nair-snow surface is measured with a laser altimeter. Ice plus\nsnow thickness is the difference between the EM distance\nmeasurement to the ice/water interface and the laser height of\nthe snow [Haas et al., 2009].\n[31] The accuracy of the EM method is \xc3\x860.1 m over level\nice under typical summer conditions [Haas et al., 1997;\nPfaffling et al., 2007] with only small effects from melt ponds\n[Haas et al., 1997; Eicken et al., 2001]. The horizontal extent\nof induced eddy currents results in a measurement footprint\narea of up to 3.7 times the instrument height above the water\n[Reid et al., 2006]. Surveys (Figure 2) were performed using\na sensor (\xe2\x80\x9cEM-Bird\xe2\x80\x9d) towed from helicopters and fixed wing\naircraft from icebreakers and land bases in various regions of\nthe eastern and western Arctic [Haas et al., 2006, 2008,\n2009, 2010] generally in April/May and August/September.\n4.3. Upward Looking Sonar and Ice Profiling Sensors\nFrom Moorings\n[32] Eleven moorings with upward looking sonars (ULS)\ndeployed in Fram Strait and the Greenland Sea (Figure 1b) by\nthe Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research,\nBremerhaven, Germany acquired almost 25 station years\nof data between 2002 and 2004 as a contribution to the\nWorld Climate Research Programme\xe2\x80\x99s Arctic Climate System Study/Climate and Cryosphere (ACSYS/CliC) Project.\nThe ice draft data are available from the CDR as well as the\nNational Snow and Ice Data Center Web site with data\ndescriptions by Witte and Fahrbach [2005].\n[33] Sea ice draft data are available on the continental\nshelf of the Eastern Beaufort Sea for the period April 1990\nto September 2003 from IPS instruments deployed by\nH. Melling at the Institute for Ocean Sciences (IOS), Canada.\nData are described by Melling and Riedel [2008, and references therein].

The ACSYS/CliC\nWorkshop [Steffen, 2004] on sea ice thickness requires an\naccuracy of \xc3\x860.05 m for draft for ULS and IPS.\n4.4. Upward Looking Sonar Measurements\nFrom Submarines\n[35] Submarines have traversed the Arctic regularly since\n1958 measuring the draft of the overhead sea ice using\nupward looking sonar (ULS). The processed and publicly\navailable data (archived at National Snow and Ice Data\nCenter (NSIDC) and available as 50 km averages at the\nCDR) include 42 cruises from 1975 to 2000 covering\n\nC00D13\n\n120,000 km. The cruises took place between April and\nNovember, although most of the data were collected in\nlate spring (April\xe2\x80\x93May) and in late summer\xe2\x80\x93fall (August\xe2\x80\x93\nOctober) [Rothrock and Wensnahan, 2007].\n[36] The draft data are produced for periods when the\nsubmarine was traveling in a straight line at constant speed\nand depth. The basic data product is ice draft along the cruise\ntrack (Figure 2). The original data typically have a spacing\nof 1\xe2\x80\x938 m with a footprint size of 2\xe2\x80\x937 m depending on the\nsubmarine depth. Processed data segments vary in length\nfrom a few to several hundred kilometers.\n4.5. Pack Ice and Fast Ice Measurements\nFrom Drill Holes\n[37] Historical ice thickness data are available from the\n\xe2\x80\x9cAtlas of ice and snow of the Arctic Basin and Siberian Shelf\nSeas\xe2\x80\x9d [Romanov, 1995]. This data set contains sea ice and\nsnow from spring (mid-March\xe2\x80\x93mid-May) measurements\ncollected during aircraft landings associated with the Soviet\nUnion\xe2\x80\x99s Sever airborne and North Pole drifting station programs. The High-Latitude Airborne Annual Expeditions\nSever took place in 1937, 1941, 1948\xe2\x80\x931952, and 1954\xe2\x80\x931993\n[Konstantinov and Grachev, 2000]. The data set is derived\nfrom as few as 7 landings (1937) to nearly pan-Arctic coverage in the 1970s. The data set contains measurements of 23\nparameters, including (1) ice thickness and snow depth on the\nrunway and surrounding area; (2) ridge, hummock, and sastrugi dimensions and areal coverage; and (3) snow density.\nThe data used in this paper are a subset of those used to create\n\nFigure 2. Locations of the airborne EM thickness data (dark) and submarine ULS ice draft data (light).\n8 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nthe atlas \xe2\x80\x9cMorphometric Characteristics of Ice and Snow in\nthe Arctic Basin\xe2\x80\x9d (self published by I. P. Romanov in 1993\nand republished by Backbone in 1995). Romanov provided\nthese data to NSIDC in 1994 (see http://nsidc.org/data/\ng02140.html for full description and data in ASCII format).\nWe use two data sets from Romanov Atlas. The first one\nreferenced as Siberian Seas data set includes observations\nfrom drill hole in springs of 1982\xe2\x80\x931986 covering the Kara,\nLaptev, East Siberian, and Russian part of the Chukchi Sea.\nThe second part, named \xe2\x80\x9cRomanov Atlas\xe2\x80\x9d includes all digital\ndata from NSIDC data archive and covers the entire Arctic\nBasin for 1930s\xe2\x80\x931980s.\n[38] We also use data from 51 coastal stations where sea\nice thickness was measured monthly through drill holes. The\ndata represent thicknesses of fast sea ice in the vicinity of the\ncoastal station, mostly first-year ice, undeformed by ridging\nor rafting. Monthly data are available for 1998\xe2\x80\x932009. The\ndata were provided by the Arctic and Antarctic Research\nInstitute, St. Petersburg, Russia. Although these data and the\ndata from the Romanov Atlas are unique, and the accuracy of\nsuch direct measurements is likely less than 0.05 m, we\ncannot make here a formal statement regarding error of drill\nhole position and accuracy.\n\n5. Data Biases\n[39] ICESat estimates [Kwok et al., 2009] of ice drafts are\nconsistently within 0.5 m (one standard deviation) of profiles\nfrom a mid-November 2005 submarine cruise and 4 years of\nice draft from moorings (BGEP-WHOI and AIM-IOS) in the\nChukchi and Beaufort Seas. The standard deviation of the\nuncertainty in ICESat thickness estimates is 0.37 m [Kwok\nand Rothrock, 2009]. The ICESat measurements, when\nconverted to drafts, are smaller on average by 0.1 \xc3\x86 0.42 m\nthan adjusted ULS submarine drafts and by 0.14 \xc3\x86 0.51 m\nthan ULS moored drafts [Kwok et al., 2009]. ICESat ice\nthickness estimates for 2003\xe2\x80\x932008 for the same area of the\nArctic Ocean as represented by their regression equations\nmatch well with the earlier submarine records [Kwok and\nRothrock, 2009]. Shifts in the individual satellite campaign\ntiming introduce seasonal and interannual variability within\nthe data set, although thicknesses represent near maximum\nend of winter and minimum end of summer data and this bias\nmay be small.\n[40] Assessment of model performance using sea ice drift\nand deformation derived from satellite data indicates little\nagreement between modeled patterns of sea ice deformation\nfields and the linear features produced from the RADARSAT\nGeophysical Processor System (RGPS) at days to seasons\nand from kilometers to near basin scale [Kwok et al., 2008].\nCompared to the RGPS products, specific model shortcomings included slow ice drift along coastal Alaska and\nSiberia, poor temporal rates of regional ice cover divergence,\nand low deformation-related ice volume production [Kwok\nand Sulsky, 2010].\n[41] Ice thickness from electromagnetic induction is computed by differencing the EM inferred distance to the ice/\nwater interface with the laser height of the snow plus ice.\nThus, the ice thickness from the EM measurements includes\nsnow thickness. Due to the footprint, the measured, unconsolidated ridge thickness can be less than 50% of its \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nC00D13\n\nthickness from (primarily) drill holes [Haas et al., 2008] and\nfrom ULS [Haas and Jochmann, 2003]. This would result in\nunderestimates of mean ridge thicknesses. However, due to\nthe footprint, EM measurements would overestimate ice\nthickness if the sensor is over the flanks of a ridge, which\nwould compensate for too small estimate over ridge crests\n[Haas et al., 1997]. The EM thickness distributions are most\naccurate with respect to modal thickness, while mean thickness can still be used for relative comparisons between\nregions and years.\n[42] Ice draft from moorings is converted to thickness as\nthe product of draft and the seawater to sea ice density ratio\n(1.115) [e.g., Bourke and Paquette, 1989]. This assumes that\ncontributions to thickness are negligible from variations in\nthe seawater density and any overlying snow water equivalent. Snow cover, melt ponds and deformed ice provide\nsources of error. Ice draft from ULS and IPS mounted on\nmoorings is overestimated on average in rough ice. Note that\nNSIDC has been alerted to an error in the way a bias correction was applied for the AWI data, but pending further\nclarification these data are used assuming the accuracy noted\nabove.\n[43] Rothrock and Wensnahan [2007] identify the following submarine ice draft measurement errors: precision error;\nerror in identifying open water (ice of zero draft); sound\nspeed error; error caused by sonar footprint size variations;\nerror from uncontrolled gain and thresholds; error due to\nvessel trim. There are also differences between analog versus\ndigitally recorded data with paper charts biased toward\nthicker ice by over 0.30 m due to their coarser temporal resolution. The drafts are obtained from the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst return\xe2\x80\x9d or\nfrom the depth of the deepest ice within the footprint.\nRothrock and Wensnahan [2007] estimate the overall bias\ndue to this effect of the submarine ULS data from the actual\ndraft as +0.29 m with a standard deviation of \xc3\x860.25 m.\nRodrigues [2011] finds a bias based on the sonar beam width\nand ice roughness larger than that found by Rothrock and\nWensnahan [2007]. For this study we have corrected for the\nsubmarine draft bias of +0.29 m described by Rothrock and\nWensnahan [2007].\n[44] The Romanov ice thickness data were obtained at sites\nadjacent to aircraft landing sites such as refrozen leads.\nAlthough measurements were taken from nearby ice floes,\nthese data may overrepresent level, undisturbed ice. Hunke\n[2010] compared model output with the aircraft landing\ndata (1958\xe2\x80\x931986) and found that model output was too thick\nwhile the same model output was comparable to submarine\ndraft data from 1986 to 1988, although the landing and submarine time periods do not overlap. If the Romanov data are\nindeed biased \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d it may not reflect the prevailing ice\nthickness with large degree of deformation away from\nlanding sites.\n[45] The observational data have very different spatial\nresolutions; moored instruments and drill holes produce point\ndata, while the ICESat data were processed using a 50 km\nGaussian smoothing; and the Unified Sea Ice Thickness\nClimate Data Record provides the statistical mean ice thickness at 50 km intervals for the submarine ULS data.\n[46] Although the data sets have the above mentioned\nbiases, we are not aware of a thorough comparison among\n\n9 of 21\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nC00D13\n\nC00D13\n\nFigure 3.

Methods\n\n7. Comparisons Between Observations\nand Model Results\n\n[47] In the following discussion, model minus observed\nthickness values are referred to as residuals; a positive\nresidual indicates a model overestimates observation. Where\nmodel results overlapped observed data temporally, model\nice thicknesses were extracted from the nearest model grid\npoint and monthly averaged. We compare the observed data\nwith the nearest model grid point, an approach perhaps\nadvantageous to models with finer resolution. For models\nwith coarse resolution, a 50 km weighted average which\nis used by Rothrock and Wensnahan [2007], might be\nadvantageous.\n[48] Record length correlation coefficients and residuals\nwere computed from the monthly time series for each of the\nmoored ULS and the 51 coastal stations data. Annual correlation coefficients and residuals were computed for each of\nthe model-data pairs from ICESat, airborne EM, Romanov\nAtlas, and submarine data sets. From these, grand mean\ncorrelation coefficients and residuals for each observational\nplatform were computed.\n[49] To show the residuals and correlation coefficients,\na modified Taylor Diagram [Taylor, 2001] is used where\nthe radial angle is proportional to the residual with \xc3\x86p\ncorresponding to \xc3\x862 m residuals, and the distance from the\norigin is proportional to the correlation coefficient where r\nequals 1 on the unit circle (Figure 3). Model performance is\nquantified by comparing the area swept \xe2\x88\xa3(1 \xc3\x80 r)q\xe2\x88\xa3 by the\nradial \xe2\x80\x9ctip\xe2\x80\x9d (1 \xc3\x80 r) rotated from zero to the residual value (q).\n[50] The linear relationships between observed ULS and\ncoastal station thickness data and model output are computed\nfrom the record lengths determined from each instrument or\nstation location. Seasonally averaged thickness is used for\nICESat and Romanov\xe2\x80\x99s data and monthly averages were used\n\n7.1. Siberian Seas\n[51] The residuals from the Romanov drill hole data from\nthe Siberian Seas (Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, and Chukchi)\nwere averaged from 1982 to 1986 and contoured using a\ncolor bar defined so that zero is white (Figure 4). Except for\nthe GSFC, the models have positive residuals (consistent\nwith the argument that the Romanov data are \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d).\nSpatially, residuals are larger in the east (East Siberian and\nChukchi Seas) than in the west (Kara and Laptev Seas),\nparticularly for INMOM. GSFC has near-zero residuals in\nthe eastern Siberian marginal seas, and small, negative residuals in the west.\n7.2. ICESat\n[52] The residuals are all less than 0.75 m (Figure 5a).\nThe UW, ECCO2, and NAME are correlated with data above\n0.6 and have residuals smaller than \xc3\x860.20 m. The GSFC\ncorrelation is larger than 0.6 and the residual is negative,\nabout \xc3\x800.60 m. The INMOM correlation is less than 0.5\nand the residual exceeds 0.60 m. (Post-2001 results from the\nORCA model were not available at the time of our analysis.)\n7.3. Airborne EM\n[53] The correlations are all less than 0.5. UW, NAME,\nINMOM, GSFC and ORCA underestimate ice thickness by\nas much as 0.40 while ECCO2 overestimates by $0.30 m\n(Figure 5b). GSFC, UW and NAME have almost identical\nresiduals, underestimating the observations by $0.5 m. The\nnegative residual occurs, perhaps, because the EM measurements include snow depth with the ice thickness and EM\n\n10 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nC00D13\n\noverestimates ice thickness if the sensor is over the flanks of\na ridge.\n7.4. Moored ULS\n[54] All six models have residuals less than \xc3\x860.25 m and\nmoderate correlations with the data (Figure 5c). ECCO2, UW\nand GSFC are correlated at $0.6. INMOM, NAME, and\nORCA correlations are weaker with similarly sized residuals\nof $0.25 m. ECCO2 demonstrates the best agreement with\nthe moored ULS data with its very small residual and correlation of 0.6. GSFC and UW have negative residuals of\n$\xc3\x800.15 m.\n7.5. Submarine ULS\n[55] ECCO2 has the highest correlation ($0.7) and a\nresidual less than +0.2 m (Figure 5d). UW and GSFC have\ncorrelations above $0.6. INMOM and NAME have positive\nresiduals less than +0.70 m with correlations less than 0.6.\nORCA has the weakest correlation (0.48) and a negative\nresidual slightly larger than \xc3\x800.30 m.\n7.6. Coastal Stations\n[56] All models overestimate thickness at the coastal stations except GSFC (Figure 5e) which has a near zero residual. The correlations are similar, between $0.4 and $0.6\nwith NAME having the largest correlation (>0.6). INMOM\nand ORCA have the largest residuals.\n7.7. Romanov Atlas Data at NSIDC\n[57] All models overestimate thickness for these data\nexcept GSFC (Figure 5f), consistent with Figure 4. GSFC has\na negative residual ($\xc3\x800.20 m) while INMOM, NAME,\nUW, and ORCA have positive residuals, larger than residuals\nfrom any other measurements. The largest residuals are\nconsistent with other findings discussed above suggesting\nthe Romanov data probably underrepresent thicker, likely\nheavily ridged ice.\n\n8. ULS Residuals\n[58] Here we focus on assessment of ULS residuals\nbecause of (1) broad spatial and temporal coverage, (2) relatively well understood accuracy and biases, and (3) similarities between measurements in time at a point from a\nmooring and a model grid point. Figure 6 displays the correlations and residuals from the moored ULS instruments to\nshow that UW and ECCO2 have residuals generally less than\n0.70 m (Figures 6a and 6b), with progressively larger residuals for GSFC and NAME (Figures 6c and 6d), and the\nlargest residuals (approaching \xc3\x862 m) from INMOM and\nORCA (Figures 6e and 6f). Model correlations range\nbetween zero and one without any apparent relationship with\nthe residuals.\n\n9. Linear Relationships\n\nFigure 4.

Thicker red lines show cases where September ice thickness was zero, as observed.\nModel solutions (red lines) outside the gray \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamic\xe2\x80\x9d region include dynamics forcing such as\nridging. Model is noted at the top of each frame.\n[60] The slopes are less than one in all but four cases and\nthe y intercepts are positive in all but three of the 32 cases.\nThe regression lines cross y = x at variable locations with a\nmean of 2.2 m (range is \xc3\x803.4 to 7.7 m) which we now use to\nseparate \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cthick\xe2\x80\x9d ice in the remaining discussion.\n[61] INMOM, ECCO2, UW, and GSFC overestimate\nsatellite-derived thickness less than 1m (Figure 7a). INMOM,\nECCO2 and UW overestimate satellite-derived thickness\nwhen less than 2.0 m, and INMOM overestimates ice less\nthan 3 m. The models underestimate the thickest ice by two\nor more meters. NAME is omitted as it overlapped the satellite record in 2004 only.\n[62] INMOM, UW, and ECCO2 overestimate EM thickness less than $1 m, and all models underestimate airborne\nEM thickness when thicker than $3.5 m (Figure 7b). ORCA\nis omitted.\n[63] GSFC strongly underestimates moored ULS thickness\nless than 2 m and NAME and ORCA overestimate ice thinner\nthan 1.5 m (Figure 7c). ECCO2 estimates thickness quite\nwell across the range.\n[64] All models overestimate thickness when submarine\nULS measurements are less than $2 m (Figure 7d) and\nunderestimate ice measured to be thicker than $4 m. The\nslopes of the INMOM, UW, GSFC, ECCO2, and ORCA\nregression lines are similar. UW, GSFC, ECCO2, and ORCA\nhave y intercepts near one, with larger y intercepts for\nINMOM and NAME showing the potentially large errors\nfor \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d water.\n[65] All models except NAME and GSFC overestimate\nfast-ice ice thickness from coastal stations when measured to\nbe less than 1.5 m (Figure 7e). GSFC is unable to reproduce\nthe range of the observed fast-ice measurements. UW and\nECCO2 have similar slopes and y intercepts.\n\n[66] INMOM, NAME, UW, and ORCA overestimate the\nRomanov Atlas thickness less than 3 m, and all models\noverestimate thickness where it is measured to be less than\n1 m (Figure 7f). (ECCO2 is omitted as mode output does not\noverlap the Romanov Atlas data.)\n\n10.\n\nDiscussion\n\n[67] We have compared six AOMIP models having different numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and\nboundary conditions against ice thickness acquired using six\ndifferent methodologies. Despite differences among models\nand data, the model performance is dominated by an overestimate of thickness of measured ice thinner than $2 m and\nan underestimate of thickness of measured ice thicker than\n$2 m.\n[68] For all observational platforms, models generally have\nregression slopes less than one (m \xc2\xbc 0:7), positive y intercepts (b \xc2\xbc 0:9), and cross the y = x line (perfect fit) at a mean\nobserved thicknesses of about 2 m. Overestimating thin ice is\nlarger for the satellite and submarine ULS data (Figures 7a\nand 7d). For the thickest ice measured by satellite, airborne\nEM and submarine ULS, the models underestimate thickness\nby several meters (Figures 7a, 7b, and 7d), a consistent pattern across platforms and across models.\n[69] The AOMIP models compare well, in the mean, with\nthe submarine ULS with a mean residual of 0.12 m. We note\nthat the Louvain-la-Neuve (LIM3) model [Vancoppenolle\net al., 2009a] underestimated submarine draft observations\nconverted to thickness by \xc3\x800.55 \xc3\x86 1.04. They obtained a\npositive model bias for thin ice and a negative bias for the\nthick ice, similar to our results. Vancoppenolle et al. [2009b]\nperformed sensitivity study of ice thermodynamics to the sea\nice salinity and demonstrated a 0.30 m reduction in the model\n\n15 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nbias when the salt evolution model is used instead of constant\nor prescribed varying salt profiles.\n[70] The model biases indicate a regional dependency with\nsmall residuals in the Beaufort Sea and the central Arctic\nOcean (moored and submarine ULS data) and an increase in\nthe size of the positive residuals on the Siberian Shelf (station\ndata and Siberian Seas data). Rothrock et al. [2003] and\nVancoppenolle et al. [2009a], comparing model results with\nsubmarine ULS, obtained a persistent pattern of model biases\nwith positive values in the Beaufort Sea, north of Greenland\nand toward the Alaskan and East Siberian Shelves, and with\nnegative values in the Arctic Transpolar Drift and toward\nFram Strait. Wilchinsky and Feltham [2004] found a similar\npattern in their simulations and demonstrated that using\nsliding friction in sea ice rheology can reduce the biases.\n[71] Adjusting the albedo may compensate for missing\nmodel physics, in particular the lack of parameterization of\nalbedo with ice age or melt fraction. This is a common\nproblem with many of the AOMIP sea ice models where\nalbedos were obtained from an 18 km regional Arctic optimized solution where we minimized the misfits between all\noceanic and sea ice data available to us, and not just sea ice\ndata alone. Sea ice models typically use only a few sea ice\nand snow albedos to obtain basin-scale mean sea ice thickness that is on the same order as basin-wide observed thickness. In the case of ECCO2, albedos were optimized by\nminimizing data-model misfits between all oceanic and sea\nice data. However, we note that adjusting the albedo may\ncompensate for missing model physics, in particular the lack\nof parameterization of albedo with ice age or melt fraction.\n[72] The mechanisms that create the thickest ice in the\nArctic include the complex dynamics of ridging. However, in\nareas away from strong dynamic processes, such as shallow,\ncoastal regions covered by landfast ice, thermodynamics are\nresponsible for ice growth. We look next for cases where\nthermodynamic ice growth, based on observed air temperature, explains observed ice thickness by evaluating the data\nfrom fast-ice stations along the Russian coast. We expect that\nheat from the ocean here is small or negligible.\n[73] We select from the set of 51 coastal stations specific\nyears and stations where the observed ice thickness is consistent with the thermodynamic thickness computed from\nempirical formula and observed air temperatures. When the\nmonthly mean observed sea ice thickness agrees with estimates from thermodynamics, then modeled ice thickness at\nthese stations and months different from observed must be\ndue to errors in modeled thermodynamic ice growth, the\ninclusion of model dynamics that do not apply under the\nobserved conditions, or the application of forcing substantially different from observations.\n[74] The thermodynamic ice thickness (hi) is computed for\nall coastal stations for September\xe2\x80\x93April. A subset of monthly\nice thicknesses is created with the criteria that the observed\nmean September ice thickness is zero, the observed mean\nSeptember air temperature is less than 0\x14 C, and the observed\nthickness agrees with the computed thickness for at least\nSeptember\xe2\x80\x93December.\n[75] Thickness is computed from Zubov\xe2\x80\x99s [1943] formula\nh\ni1\n2\nhi \xc2\xbc \xc3\x8025 \xc3\xbe \xc3\xb025 \xc3\xbe hi\xc3\x801 \xc3\x9e2 \xc3\x80 8 \xc3\x82 30 \xc3\x82 Ti\xc3\x801 where hi\xc3\x801 is\nthe ice thickness in cm and T i\xc3\x801 the temperature (\x14 C) for the\nprior 30 days. A useful discussion of this empirical formula\n\nC00D13\n\nand the thermodynamics of sea ice is given by Makshtas\n[1998]. A different formula, such as Maykut and\nUntersteiner\xe2\x80\x99s [1971] relationship for snowless (or snow\ncovered) ice [Weeks and Hibler, 2010], could be used. We\ncompared these formulas (not shown) to highlight differences in resulting thicknesses. Some formulas produce faster\ngrowth. Which formula is \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d? In the case of the Zubov\nformula above, we identified 22 \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d of observed ice\nthickness from the coastal station data that closely match\nthe thermodynamic ice thickness for at least 4 consecutive\nmonths and as much as 9 consecutive months. These cases\nare from 13 unique coastal stations, 8 unique years, and\nconsist of 132 months of ice thickness values.\n[76] The resulting data are divided into a \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d group consisting of observed ice thickness that agrees\nwith the Zubov calculation, and \xe2\x80\x9cmodels\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of the\nmodeled ice thickness from the locations and months where\n\xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d apply. Figure 8 shows \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d\nas the gray area (drawn as a set of gray lines connecting\nthicknesses through the months) and \xe2\x80\x9cmodels\xe2\x80\x9d as red lines\nconnecting monthly thickness for the 22 cases. The thicker\nred lines identify modeled ice thickness that was zero in\nSeptember, as observed.\n[77] It is evident from Figure 8 that all models have ice\nthickness values outside the range of \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d\nsuggesting the inclusion of dynamics such as ridging that\nthicken the ice. While all models except INMOM have cases\nwhere the September thicknesses are zero, as observed, all\nmodels also have cases where the September ice thickness is\nnonzero. The September thickness for INMOM is always\ngreater than zero, more than 150 cm in one case. In these\ncases, modeled ice thickness greater than \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d\nindicates the model has included dynamic factors such as\nridging.\n[78] For ECCO2 there are cases where the ice becomes\nthicker than observed by October and substantially thicker by\nDecember\xe2\x80\x93March. For those cases with zero ice thickness in\nSeptember, the UW model tracks just above \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d through November, GSFC tracks \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d closely through December and then decreases noticeably\nbelow \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d through May. ORCA and NAME\nhave only one case with a zero September thickness, and both\ntrack \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d well.\n[79] Ice growth was computed using forward differences\nfrom both \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmodels.\xe2\x80\x9d While model\nsea ice \xe2\x80\x9cgrowth\xe2\x80\x9d likely includes nonthermodynamic processes, we refer to both observed and modeled changes as ice\n\xe2\x80\x9cgrowth,\xe2\x80\x9d for ease of this discussion. Dynamic processes\nmay be relevant in modeled sea ice thickness, particularly\nwhen the values fall outside \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics.\xe2\x80\x9d Nonthermodynamic processes must be involved when the ice\ngrowth exceeds a rate limit based on the coldest (monthly) air\ntemperatures.\n[80] Figure 9 (top) shows the ice growth rates for \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d and for the \xe2\x80\x9cmodels.\xe2\x80\x9d For September all\nmodels have mean ice growth greater than one standard\ndeviation from \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d except GSFC. ECCO2,\nUW, and ORCA have October mean ice growth larger than\none standard deviation from \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics.\xe2\x80\x9d There are\ncases where ECCO2 and GSFC ice growth substantially\nexceeds $3.0 cm d\xc3\x801. In November ECCO2 has the largest\nmodel growth rate and exceeds \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d by more\n\n16 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nC00D13\n\nFigure 9.

From December to February the\nmean model growth rates are within approximately one\nstandard deviation of \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n[81] The ratios of modeled ice growth to the thermodynamic ice growth (for each \xe2\x80\x9ccase,\xe2\x80\x9d each model mean, and the\nmean of all models) are shown for each month in Figure 9\n(bottom). In September, mean model ice growth is\n$4.5 times faster than \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics.\xe2\x80\x9d INMOM has\nindividual cases where the model to observed rate exceeds\nten, and UW and INMOM have mean September growth\nrates approximately 8 times the observed. In October the ice\ngrowth ratio is reduced but still above one. For November\xe2\x80\x93\nMarch the ratios are near one.\n[82] If the bias is driven by the applied surface forcing, then\nerrors exist in the CORE surface forcing, DRAKKAR Forcing Set 3, ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis, the JRA25, and\nNCEP/NCAR Reanalysis radiation fields in September and\nOctober but not November\xe2\x80\x93April. This seems an unlikely\ncause for overestimating thickness. Rather, the inclusion of\ndynamics processes such as ridging is present.\n[83] To compensate for missing or poorly known physical\nprocesses, model parameters such as the ice demarcation\nthickness Ho between thin and thick ice are adjusted [Hibler,\n1979; Smedsrud, 2011]. For example, the optimization\ndescribed by Nguyen et al. [2011] uses both hydrographic\nand sea ice data to obtain Ho of 0.6, and albedos of 0.71 for\nwet ice, 0.87 for dry snow, and 0.81 for wet snow. AOMIP\nmodels use a range of 0.25\xe2\x80\x930.5 m for Ho. Although assigning\nnew ice to an instant thickness often greater than \xe2\x80\x9creality\xe2\x80\x9d\ncould account for \xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d growth, eliminating those cases from\nFigure 9 (cases with the thick red lines) does not substantially\nchange the results that growth is frequently too \xe2\x80\x9cfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[84] All models except INMOM are capable of producing\nsea ice thickness at rates comparable to \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamic\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause they have thickness values that overlay the observations (Figure 8). INMOM consistently overestimates\nthickness, and in no cases has thickness values at the \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d\nend of observed. Sea ice that is thicker than observed is likely\ndue to dynamic factors such as ridging in these fast ice\nregions.\n[85] Finally, in order to better understand the role of sea ice\ndynamics in the simulated sea ice thickness in the regions of\nprevailing immobile fast ice conditions, we conducted two\nnumerical experiments with ORCA model. All parameters\nand forcing conditions in these experiments were identical\nexcept that in our second experiment we introduced an\nempirical algorithm to parameterize immobile fast ice. In this\nalgorithm, we assumed that in the regions with depths less\nthan 28 m (typical observed fast-ice edge locations) and for\ntimes after 1 November and until 1 May, sea ice does not\nmove and therefore cannot be deformed and/or ridged. Differences in sea ice thickness between control and experimental model runs after 10 years of simulation (1983\xe2\x80\x931992)\nare shown in Figure 10. As it was expected from our\nhypothesis that dynamics are increasing sea ice thickness\nbeyond \xe2\x80\x9cthermodynamics,\xe2\x80\x9d the simulated sea ice thickness in\nthe coastal regions with fast ice was decreased significantly,\napproaching observed values at coastal stations. Interestingly, the areas of intensive sea ice ridging in the experimental model run are located at the fast ice edge and we can\nexpect that significant changes have to be observed not only\nin sea ice characteristics but also in oceanic parameters such\nas currents, temperature and salinity fields due to the\n\n17 of 21\n\nC00D13\n\nJOHNSON ET AL.: EVALUATION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE THICKNESS\n\nC00D13\n\nthreshold of $2 m, the thickness from our analysis that\ndiscriminates positive from negative model biases, is similar\nto the commonly accepted thickness distinguishing undeformed, first-year from multiyear Arctic sea ice [World\nMeteorological Organization, 1985]. Our results show that\nthe overestimation of \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d sea ice is, in part, due to ice\ngrowth that is much too rapid for areas where thermodynamic\nice growth is expected such as the Russian coastal fast-ice\nregions.\n\nFigure 10.

The analysis of these results will be the\nsubject of a different paper.\n\n11.\n\nSummary\n\n[86] Sea ice thickness from six AOMIP models were\ncompared with thickness across the Arctic basin from\n(1) satellites; (2) airborne EM; (3) moored ULS in Fram\nStrait, Greenland Sea, and the Beaufort Gyre (ULS, IPS);\n(4) submarine ULS across the central basin; and (5) drill\nholes through fast along coastal Russia and within the ice\npack. We find that the models overestimate thickness of ice\nthinner than $2 m and underestimate the thickness of measured ice thicker than $2 m. Overestimating thin ice is\nproblematic for forecasting areas of open water and perhaps\nthe timing of the seasonal cycle. Underestimating thick ice\nhinders long-term forecasts where the proper role of multiyear ice is critical. For locations and years along the arctic\ncoastline where fast-ice growth closely follows a thermodynamic growth law, the AOMIP models produce ice at rates\nsubstantially higher than those expected from observations\nand thermodynamics for September. Averaging over all\nobservational data sets, the correlations and smaller differences from observed thickness are better in the ECCO2 and\nUW models.\n[87] The processes of fast-ice formation need to be\nparameterized in the AOMIP models to bring ice thickness\nvalues and ice growth rates closer to observations particularly\nin the early months of the ice growth cycle.
