It is\nan iconic image, first captured November 10, 1967, by the\nApplications Technology Satellite (ATS)-3, an unmanned\ncraft conducting payload experiments and examining the\nspace environment. Since then, astronauts and spacecraft\nhave sent back hundreds of pictures of Earth, and each\none has had the same breathtaking effect.\nSeeing our home planet from space is one of those selfreflective experiences, like seeing yourself in a picture, or\nhearing your voice on tape. It tells you something about\nyourself from outside of yourself. It is an experience that\nchanges your understanding of the world and your place\nin it.\nThis phenomenon is best illustrated by the words\nof space travelers who, upon reaching orbit, have gazed\nback at Earth and felt the profound impact of viewing the\nplanet in its entirety.\nFrank Borman, Apollo 8 commander, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe view\nof the Earth from the Moon fascinated me\xe2\x80\x94a small disk,\n240,000 miles away. . . . Raging nationalistic interests,\nfamines, wars, pestilence don\xe2\x80\x99t show from that distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother veteran of the Apollo 8 mission, William\nAnders, had this to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe came all this way to explore\nthe Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNeil Armstrong, the first person to step foot on the\nMoon, described the feeling of perspective he experienced\nwhen staring out at the Earth from the spacecraft window:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue,\nwas the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and\nmy thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like\na giant. I felt very, very small.\xe2\x80\x9d\n66\t\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t\n\nAlan Shepard, commander of the Apollo 14 mission,\nthe eighth manned mission to the Moon, said of the\nexperience of seeing the home planet in its entirety, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nsomebody had said before the flight, \xe2\x80\x98Are you going to\nget carried away looking at the Earth from the Moon?\xe2\x80\x99 I\nwould have said, \xe2\x80\x98No, no way.\xe2\x80\x99 But yet when I first looked\nback at the Earth, standing on the Moon, I cried.\xe2\x80\x9d\nApollo 15 astronaut, James Irwin, said of the\nexperience, \xe2\x80\x9cAs we got further and further away, it [the\t\nEarth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size\nof a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That\n\nbeautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,\nthat if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and\nfall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAstronaut Alfred Worden, another of the original\nApollo crew, and pilot of the Apollo 15 mission, said of\nhis experience, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I know why I\xe2\x80\x99m here. Not for a\ncloser look at the Moon, but to look back at our home,\nthe Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYears later, space shuttle astronauts are still finding the\nview of Earth from space a humbling and profound experience. Don Lind, astronaut aboard the STS-51B mission\n\nThis 16-foot-diameter, pedestal-mounted, rotating globe was featured at the 2006 Wirefly X-Prize Cup in Las Cruces, New\nMexico. This exposition of personal space flight is a \xe2\x80\x9ccelebration of forward-looking technology, space exploration, and\neducation,\xe2\x80\x9d attracting thousands of people every October.\n\nSpinoff 2007\n\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThink about the picture of the Earth coming up\nover the horizon of the Moon, which I call the picture\nof the century. Every crew that went to the Moon took\nthat same picture. It is probably as moving as anything in\nreorienting people\xe2\x80\x99s idea to the whole world concept.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe experience was perhaps best illustrated, however,\nby Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a Saudi\nArabian payload specialist aboard STS-51G, a space\nshuttle mission comprised of American, French, and\nSaudi astronauts, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe first day or so, we\nall pointed to our countries. The third or fourth day, we\nwere pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, we were\naware of only one Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPartnership\nIn 1985, inspired by the pictures he had seen of the\nEarth from space, Eric J. Morris founded a company\ndevoted to designing and producing photorealistic replicas of our planet. The company, Orbis World Globes, is\nlocated in Eastsound, Washington, and creates inflatable\nglobes in many sizes that depict Earth as it is seen from\nspace, complete with atmospheric cloud cover.\nUtilizing available technology of the mid-1980s, the\noriginal EarthBall design was derived from an artist\xe2\x80\x99s\ncompilation of NASA photographs and National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellite faxes. Over the following 2 decades, as 3-D imaging\nsoftware, more powerful computers, and superwide inkjet\nprinters became readily available, Orbis employed these\nevolving capabilities to develop larger and more accurate\nworld globes. Applying proprietary cartographic software\nto transform flat-map imagery into multiple gores (2-D\ntapered sections) for creating spherical globes, Orbis now\ndesigns and produces the most visually authentic replicas\nof Earth ever created.\nNASA took notice of Orbis globes and employed a\t\n16-inch-diameter EarthBall for an educational film\nit made aboard the STS-45 shuttle mission. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nAtmosphere Below,\xe2\x80\x9d shot during the 9-day mission\nSpinoff 2007\t\n\nThis 6-foot-diameter rotating Orbis globe is installed in the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Wing Atrium of Northland Church in\nLongwood, Florida.\n\naboard Atlantis in 1992, features astronauts using the\nEarthBall to explain how scientists use the unique vantage\npoint of space to study the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nOrbis later collaborated with NASA to create two\ngiant world globes for display at the 2002 Olympic\nWinter Games in Salt Lake City. Creating the two\t\n16-foot-diameter Earth globes with NASA involved\nupdating the lower-resolution imagery the company had\nbeen using with more detailed, recent satellite imagery.\nThis imagery was taken by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer satellite, combined with\n\nobservations of Antarctica made by NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced\nVery High Resolution Radiometer sensor.\nThough the cloud cover has been slightly reduced\t\nin order for most of the landforms to be visible, Orbis\nglobes are otherwise meteorologically accurate. In the\nNorthern Hemisphere, it is fall, and it is spring in the\nSouthern Hemisphere.\nThe satellite image now printed on all Orbis globes\ndisplays 1-kilometer resolution, which means that each\npixel in the digital image represents 1 square kilometer\nof the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface. It is 21,600 by 43,200 pixels in\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t 67\n\nsize. According to Orbis, while specific portions of the\nEarth have been imaged with higher detail, as of 2002,\nthe satellite image it uses was the most detailed composite\nimage of the entire world in existence.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s new Blue Marble: Next Generation satellite\nimagery now provides even higher 500-meter resolution,\nwhich Orbis is planning to utilize for giant (30-foot plus)\ndiameter world globes.\nOrbis also developed the exclusive NightGlow Cities\nfeature, enabling EarthBalls to display the world\xe2\x80\x99s cities\nas the globes revolve from daylight into night. Using light\nemissions data from U.S. Department of Defense satellites, city lights are identified with photoluminescent ink,\nfluorescing brightly under black ultraviolet light, adding a\nnew dimension of authenticity to these world replicas.\n\nProduct Outcome\nOrbis inflatable globes are available in sizes from 1 to\n100 feet in diameter, with the most common being the\nstandard 16-inch and 1-meter diameter EarthBalls. These\nsmaller globes are ideal for educational purposes and have\nbeen used everywhere from preschools to universities.\nThey come with a 20-page book of facts, games, and\nsuggested activities, including a game of indoor classroom\nvolleyball. They have been sold in thousands of gift shops,\ntoy stores, museum shops, and specialty stores.\nOver 100 Orbis world globes from 2 to 20 feet\nin diameter have been custom-built for a variety of\ndisplay purposes. They have been used as temporary\nexhibits at numerous events, such as conferences, trade\nshows, festivals, concerts, and parades. For these types\nof purposes, the company maintains a fleet of rental\nglobes ranging from 3 to 16 feet in diameter. Globes\nof various sizes have been exhibited at numerous events\nThis un-retouched photograph of a 4-foot-diameter Orbis\nglobe features the world\xe2\x80\x99s cities fluorescing under black\nultraviolet light.\xc2\xa0It was printed on special blackout digital\nfabric with the city lights added using ultraviolet-sensitive\nfluorescent paint.\xc2\xa0\n\n68\t\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t\n\nSpinoff 2007\n\nEric J.

Morris mused, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nonly others could see Earth as the astronauts observe it,\n\nperhaps they would be similarly inspired.\xe2\x80\x9d Considering\nthe success of Orbis World Globes, people of all ages\nare being inspired everyday to appreciate our wondrous\nplanet, Earth. v\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t 69\n\n'
