Introduction\nSince the introduction of carbon fiber composites in the 1960\'s, they have proven their merit in high\nperformance\napplications that are generally associated with military aircraft. These high performance\napplications have demonstrated that primary aircraft structures made from carbon fiber composites can\nachieve weight savings of 20% to 30% over similarly designed metal structures.\nHowever, this level of\nweight saving and improved performance\nwas only realized by accepting a significant cost penalty for the\nenhanced composite structure. Future advanced commercial aircraft applications will place a high\npriority on developing cost effective designs, and improved performance\nwill rarely be accepted as\njustification for a higher cost composite structural component. The realization of this situation has put\npressure on governmental\nresearch agencies and aircraft manufacturers\nto fund various efforts that strive\nto lower constituent material costs and developing cost effective manufacturing\nprocesses for composite\nstructmes.\nPart of this research effort to develop cost effective composite manufacturing\nprocesses includes the\nNASA Airframe Materials and Structures element of the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST)\nprogram, which grew out of the Advanced Composite Technology (ACT) program. The latter ACT\nprogram was initiated in 1989, and its composite research results identified both manufacturing\ncost and\ndamage tolerance barriers to the application of these materials in commercial transport primary structures.\nThis long-term government and industry development effort is continuing to show positive results, and\nthe Boeing Company is participating\nin the AST program through the development of stitched/resin\nfilm\ninfusion (S/RFI) technology under NASA Langley contract NAS 1-20546.\nVarious types of textile composites have been evaluated for theh ability to provide low cost composite\nstructures.\nThrough-the-thickness\nstitching of dry preforms, combined with resin infusion, showed a\ngood potential for overcoming cost and damage tolerance issues related to using carbon fiber composites\nin primary structmes of commercial aircraft. Stitching through dry fabric made it possible to incorporate\nvarious elements of a wing torque box (i.e., wing skin, stiffeners, intercostal clips, and spat caps) into an\nintegral structme that eliminates the requirement for thousands of mechanical fasteners. Replacing\nmechanical fasteners with a highly automated stitching process has the potential of significantly reducing\nmanufacturing\ncosts of composite structures. This advance in composite structme fabrication is a positive\nindication that progress is continuing to be made toward reaching the long desired affordability goals for\nthese materials, while retaining their weight advantage over metallic designs.\nIn the 1980\'s, toughened resin systems began to show promise for improving the damage tolerance of\ncarbon fiber composites, but the high cost of these new resin systems detracted from their damage\ntolerance benefits. Development\nof through-the-thickness\nstitching of dry preforms was viewed as a low\ncost alternative to toughened resin systems in the previous ACT program efforts. Combining less\nexpensive brittle resins with through-the-thickness\nstitching offered improved damage tolerant composite\nstructures at an affordable cost.\nAST program element goals included making composite wing structures 25 percent lighter, reducing\nfabrication costs by 20 percent, and reducing airline operating costs by 4 percent as compared to current\naluminum wing designs. These goals were shown to be achievable by the NASA/Boeing\nAST Composite\nWing Program (NAS 1-20546). These achievements\nare documented and discussed in this executive\nsummary of the AST Composite Wing Program. This report describes a weight trade study utilizing a\nwing torque box design applicable to a 220-passenger\ncommercial aircraft and was used to verify the\nweight savings a S/RFI structure would offer compared to an identical aluminum wing box design. This\ntrade study was performed in the AST Composite Wing program, and the overall weight savings for the\n\ncompositeoxarereportedelative thealuminum\nb\nr\nto\nbaseline.\nPrevious rogram\np\nworkinvolvedthedesign\nof a S/RFI aseline ingboxstructural\nb\nw\ntestcomponent\nanditsassociated\ntesting\nhardware.\nThisdetail\nstructural\ndesign\neffortwhichis knownasthe"semi-span" thisreport, ascompletednderaprevious\nin\nw\nu\nNASAcontract.\n(ref.NAS1-18862)\nThefull-scale\nwingdesign\nwasbased configuration aMD-90-40X\nona\nfor\nairplane,\nandtheobjective\nof\nthisstructural\ntestcomponent\nwastodemonstrate\nthematurity theS/RFItechnology\nof\nthrough\nthe\nevaluationf a full-scale\no\nwingbox/fuselage\nsection\nstructural\ntest.However,\nscope\nreductions theAST\nin\nComposite ingProgram\nW\nprevented\nthefabrication\nandevaluation f thiswingboxstructure. esults\no\nR\nobtained\nfromtheweighttrade\nstudyandthefull-scale component\ntest\ndesign\neffortwill bediscussed\nherein.\n\n2.

The configuration used for the study was\nthe MD-90-40X airplane, which would be representative\nof a tail-mounted engine design. Loads data and\nsystems analyses were performed by the Twin-Jet commercial design division of the Douglas Products\nGroup (DPG) in Long Beach. All of the structural analysis studies were performed by the Phantom\nWorks Divisions located in Long Beach and St. Louis.\nAirplane\n\nDescription\n\nBaseline Configuration.\nThe MD-90-40X configuration\nwas selected for the AST Composite Wing\nProgram (see Figure 1). The X2 wing was developed flom the DPG MD9040W2\nwing and then\nre-optimized to include additional Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) program constraints. In\naddition to changes in performance requirements,\nseveral manufacturing-specific\nconstraints were added\nto minimize fabrication costs: straight rear spat, a 112-inch maximum spat-to-spat\nspacing (stitching\nmachine limit), minimum radius of curvature between spars of 200 inches, and constraint of the chord and\nincidence at the side of body to facilitate integration into the MD-80/90 fuselage. These requirements\nled\nto a larger chord at the planform break and also influenced the wing sweep.\nS83889\n\nFigure 1.

This increase was due primarily\nbe necessary to accept the chevron-shaped\nchevron center box are listed below.\n\nto extensive modifications\nto the existing fuselage that would\ncenter wing box. Some of the problems associated with the\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe V-shaped front spar encroaches on the under-floor cargo volume. It also requires a complete\nreconfiguration\nof the existing pressure bulkhead at the forward end of the cutout in the fuselage\npressure shell.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe box cross section at the centerline is deeper than for a constant-section\ncenter box. It extends\nbelow the fuselage shell and requires a larger wing/fuselage\nfillet fairing and more complex keel\nstructure.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe sudden changes of load paths at the centerline require a heavy bulkhead to react the kick loads.\nThese kick loads act in opposing directions in the upper and lower cover panels, which creates a\ntwisting moment on the box. The resulting nonuniform loading in the center box adds a significant\nweight penalty.\n\nSide-of-Body\nSplice Concept. This type of splice is used on MD-11 aircraft. It has the advantage of\nhaving a constant-section\ncenter box, with identically shaped interior ribs. The constant section is\ncompatible with the constant bending moment that results from symmetric loading conditions.\nRegardless of where the splice is located, there will be a heavy side-of-body bulkhead to transfer wing\nshear and torque loads into the fuselage. These bulkheads also react the kick loads that occm at a side-of\nbody splice. At this location, external splice plates with protruding-head\nbolts can be used in the cover\npanel joints, because these are within the wing/fuselage\nfairing and aerodynamic flushness is not requhed.\nOn the basis of manufacturing\nand engineering evaluations, the side-of-body bulkhead concept was found\nto be the most favorable location for splicing the wing on the MD-90-40X configuration.\nManufacturing\npersonnel contributed their views to the study and it was agreed that the center wing box should not be\ndelivered as a complete assembly but as separate pieces. This allows the wing (tip-to-tip) to be assembled\nas a single unit before installation on the fuselage.\nSpar Reference Planes. Spars are in vertical planes in the full-scale box. This simplifies the intercept at\nthe side-of-body bulkhead between the outer and center spar segments. Sloping spar planes were\nconsidered in 1996 as a means of reducing the angle with the direction of stitching motion, but this was\nnot adopted.\nRib Planes. Ribs are in a vertical plane relative to the airplane coordinate system. It would be\nstructurally advantageous to make them perpendicular\nto dihedral planes, but this advantage is offset by\nthe increase in manufacturing\ncosts. Following conventional\npractice, planes were originally\nperpendicular\nto the rear spar [References 1, 2]. They were later redesigned perpendicular\nto the mid-box\naxis for the full-scale box to simplify the manufacture of intercostal rib clips.\nHuman factor studies led to an increase in the width of the root bay for the semi-span\nconsiderations\nwere incorporated\ninto the full-scale wing design.\n\ndesign, and these\n\nFAA Compliance\nThe full-scale wing box was designed to meet all applicable FAR requirements\nfor composite structures.\nThe methodology used as the certification basis was taken directly from the FAA Advisory Circular\n20-107A (Composite Aircraft Structure).\nCompliance for the full-scale wing will be shown either\nanalytically or by test and will take full advantage of the building-block\napproach established earlier in\nthe program.\n\n2.2\n\nDefinition\n\nof Aircraft\n\nSystem\n\nInfluences\n\nA Unigraphics solid model layout was created for each of the systems components\nverify the volumetric requirements\nfor the wing.\n\nshown in Figure 3 to\n\nSlats. The hybrid systems are based upon MD-12X hydraulic drive/torque tube designs coupled with the\nexisting MD-90-30 cable/track design. These systems utilize gem boxes in lieu of rotary actuators to\ndrive the cable system and slat segments. Cany-over\nof a slat track design minimizes cuts/breaks in the\nwing-under-slat\n(WUS) structure, which allows the skin structure to contribute to wing bending and\ntorsional load carrying capability.\nThis feature was particularly attractive for the composite wing because\nof its lower torsional stiffness.\nDuring the preliminary design phase of the project, no definition of WUS structure, slat X-section, or slat\nsegments was available. Slat mechanical systems were conceived around best-guess approximations\nof\nexisting MD-90-30 features. Baseline assumptions included a six-slat segment on each side of the wing\n(0 through 5), each of which was scaled to meet the MD-90-40X wing loads. Each set of slats was scaled\nusing two different factors, one for the inboard slats (fuselage to inbomd/outbomd\naero split line) and\nanother for the outboard slats. Slat segment splits were altered slightly to clear existing wing box fibs.\nThe drive gear box envelope was sized to fit the outboard location in the wing; all seven of the gem boxes\nare identical for the sake of commonality.\nDrive points for the slats were chosen at each segment split,\nand an idler track was located at the midpoint. For slats 0 and 5, the second drive track was located at\neach edge of the segment. This arrangement gives two independent drive tracks per slat segment and\nsatisfies design requhements\nfor redundancy.\nDual system hydraulic power drive units (PDU) were sized at 66% of the MD-12X Sundstrand design.\nThis resulted in a very conservative envelope estimate (the wing span of the MD-90-40X is one-half the\nwing span of the MD-12X).\nLocation of the PDU in the wing was as far outboard as the wing leading\nedge (L/E) cross section would allow. In the drawing file previously mentioned, the PDU and gear boxes\nare simplified depictions representing only the part envelope. The mounting interfaces for these\ncomponents are also simplified.\nThe locations of the drive gear boxes can be altered inbornd/outboard\nas required for detailed cable\nsystem design (e.g., turnbuckle locations) or to alleviate space conflicts with other systems. Cable\ndiameters and displacements\nwere estimated directly from the MD-90-30 without any scaling factors.\nTorque tube supports and specific cable pulleys/brackets\nwere not modeled.\nFlaps. An MD-12X flap system was baselined.\nIt consists of a dual system hydraulic PDU with\ninterconnecting\ntorque tubes and rotary actuators at each flap hinge to drive the segments.\nComponents were sized using a 66% factor relative to the MD-12X Sundstrand design. For the\npreliminary design, the goal was to size one actuator for the inboard flaps and the other actuator for the\noutboard flaps. This was achieved with only one exception\nthe outboard actuator on the outboard flap.\nBecause of insufficient spar depth, the actuator was sized slightly below 66% to fit. This deviation was\nconsidered acceptable because the systems design effort is only supporting the structures design at this\npoint in the program. In reality, the rear spar plane, L/E flap, and actuators would all undergo iterative\ncompromises/changes\nto reach an integrated solution that resulted in identical PDUs for the flaps and\nslats.\n\nS83891\n\n\\\n\ni\no\n\no\nw\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\nw\n\n_\nD.\n\n.a\n\n_-\n\nm.u\n\nuu tu\n\nP\n\ncm\n\nw\n\n,c\n\nw\n\nz\n\n_\n\ncO\n\nI\xc2\xb01\n_.......,...\n\nE* e_\n\nOE\n_)\'._\n\n_\n\n0\n\n-_..,\n\nU.\n@\n\noO\n\n_\n\n_\xc2\xa2\n\n-z\n\no\n\n,2\n\n..iw\nwz\n3_\n\ni\n\n_._u\nzJw\nw._.\n\n\\\n\nFigure 3. Baseline\n\nsystem design for full-scale\n\nwing.\n\nBecause no definition of flap cross section or flap extend positions was available (though a single\nsegmented Fowler flap was specified in the configuration\nmemo), a number of assumptions were made\nfor the baseline flap design. A Fowler mechanism was not defined for the model. This was beyond the\nscope of the project and could not be accomplished\nwithout specific definition of flap cross section and\nextended positions. Instead, the number of hinges per segment and hinge station locations were taken\nfrom the initial structural arrangement drawing. Then, structural attach points were estimated to facilitate\na conceptual design. Again, without an exact Fowler mechanism definition, exact attach/hinge points\ncould not be modeled. Although the envelope and mounting interfaces of rotary actuators were\nsimplified, they still have the general look of the MD-12X Sundstrand actuators and provide an adequate\nrepresentation\nfor the structural design of the composite wing.\nSpoilers.\nThe fly-by-wire system is modeled after the MD-95 spoiler controls. This system utilizes\n"banana links" between the spoiler surface and the actuator. These are identical to those used on all twinjets. No torsion bats are used to maintain a closing force on the surface, as this is done by the actuator.\nThe actuator was modeled after the MD-95 spoiler actuator, which was not finalized at the time of the\nmodel creation. Thus, the actuator shown in the composite wing model is only representative\nof the\napproximate envelope required.\nElectrical.\nThe electrical systems on a composite wing are slightly different from those of a conventional\nwing. Because the structure no longer serves as a conductive path, separate provisions must be made to\naccommodate\nelectrical system grounding.\nWing systems that were previously grounded to the structure\nmust now carry their grounds back to the fuselage via a common ground wire. While this consideration\nis\nimportant for the electrical system design, its impact on the structural design and wing volume\nrequirements is negligible.\nIn the electrical system preliminary design layout, the wire routing is shown\nalong with cross-sectional\narea requirements for the wire bundles at each rib station.\nIn addition to the grounding issue, there are other unique requirements\nof a composite wing that should be\nconsidered.\nStandoff brackets will be aluminum with a layer of fiberglass at the interface to avoid\ndissimilar-metals\ncorrosion with the composite structure. Metal conduits (fuel pipes) within the\ncomposite wing may need to be grounded.\nFor lightning strikes, the external surface must have a\nconductive material applied. Electrical system brackets and supports should be bonded rather than\nmechanically attached to the structure.\nFuel Systems.\nthe MD-90-40X\n\nThe fuel systems in this wing are based on the MD-90-30 twin-jet design but are sized for\nrequh-ements.\nThere were no unique requh-ements for fuel systems on a composite wing.\n\nThe fill receptacle, manifold, and a fill shutoff valve for each tank are located in the right wing leading\nedge. A fuel pipe from each valve takes the fuel to its assigned tank. A flat switch system signals the fill\nvalve to close when the tank is full.

Each panel has integral stringers, spar caps, rib intercostals, and skin buildups co-cured together\ninto a final skin panel assembly. The general structural concepts for the cover panels are shown in\nFigure 4.\nFor the full-scale design, the 0-degree direction is parallel to the mid-box axis for the outer wing and the\nrear spat plane for the center wing box. This was done to keep the fuel access cutouts as fat from the\nspars as possible.\nThe use of a repeatable balanced stack of layers was used for the full-scale\nare restricted to fall within a given design envelope for bolted repairs.\n\ncomponent.\n\nFiber percentages\n\nThe Saertex warp/knit approach uses a 44/44/12 pattern. The fiber areal weight for the 44/44/12 layup is\n1425 grrdm 2 with a cured laminate thickness of 0.055 inch per stack. To reduce the warp/knit stack,\n0-degree layers are combined in pairs. Because the 0-degree layers would not be held in place by\n0-degree stitching, 45-degree fibers are placed on the outer layers of the stack. AS4 fibers were selected\nas a standard. IM7 fibers were substituted for AS4 fibers in 0-degree layers of tension panels. This fiber\nselection was baselined for the full-scale component, and for the semi-span wing (this will be discussed in\na later section). Stiffening members (stringers, spar caps, and rib clips) are stitched to the skin to form an\nintegral dry perform. The skin between the stringers is also stitched.\n\n10\n\niiiiiiiiiiiSECTiliDINiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n\nFigure 4. Cover panel structural\n\nconcept.\n\nIn the baseline design, spar caps are similar to stringers but, in addition to carrying spanwise loads, they\nare also loaded in shear and transverse tension or compression.\nThree design concepts for an improved\ncap flange to skin interface were evaluated for the full-scale component:\n.\n\nFor High Shear Loads: This design concept is used in the semi-span box design and is conservative\nbut costly to fabricate. Skin and spar cap flange stacks are terminated in steps such that when joined\ntogether they form a series of staggered butt splices. The whole assembly is then stitched through\nthe thickness to form an integral part of the cover panel dry perform.\n\n.\n\nFor Moderate Shear Loads: This design concept would be similar to a stringer section but with a\nhigher stitching density for attaching the flanges to the skin. The strength of this arrangement was\nestablished by analysis, and where this strength is exceeded, Concept 1 would be used.\n\n.\n\nFor Low Shear Loads: A single stitched resin interface is capable of transferring loads in the lightly\nloaded regions of the front spar. This concept would be less labor-intensive\nthan the other two, yet it\nwould still provide adequate strength.\n\nThe final determination of spar cap configurations\ndepends on the detail design integration requirements\nand on the established spar cap design values. The approach is to use different concepts at different\nlocations depending on the magnitude of the shear stresses. The front spar, for example, is not highly\nloaded in shear, and a simple design such as Concept 3 may suffice, whereas the inboard end of the rear\nspar will requhe a much stronger design such as Concept 1.\n\n11\n\nSkinBuildups.In therootsplice\nregion, here\nw\ntheouterwingsattach\n\nto the center wing section, there is\na buildup of skin thickness to accommodate\nthe splice bolt loads. In this region, skin thickness is\nincreased to the same level as the stringer flanges, where possible, to present a flush face that will permit\nthe installation of inner splice plates without the need for shimming.\nThe lower loft surface of the full-span box has significant compound curvature.\nIt was not possible to lay\ndown large Saertex stack pieces on this surface without developing wrinkles and fiber crimping. The\nselected solution was to cut the stack pieces lengthwise and join them, in the fuel access door region, in a\nstaggered butt-joint fashion. The full-scale wing, having no under-wing engines, has a reduced amount of\ncompound curvature.\nThis, combined with the possible availability of a more loosely knit stack, may\nmake it possible to eliminate the spanwise butt-splice.\nStringers.\nBoth the upper and lower stringers use braided material. The slight drop in modulus for the\nbraided stringers compared to warp knitted stringers can be accommodated\nand does not affect the final\npanel strengths or significantly impact final panel weights.\nThese include the maximum overall height permitted by the stitching machine, blade instability, and the\nprovision of adequate widths to allow bolted repahs. Common stringer configurations\nand height\ntransitions are used, and where the stringers joggle over a stack drop-off in the skin, a single-taper cut is\nmade in the IML tooling to accommodate\nthe step in stringer height.\nFor the full-scale wing box design, one stringer is located pmallel and next to the front spin and another is\nlocated parallel and next to the rear spar. This is done to ensure no interference with internal fittings at\ndiscrete load locations (such as flap mounting locations).\nThe remainder of the stringers are oriented\nparallel to the mid-box plane and run out at rib locations before intercepting the stringers that are parallel\nto the spars. Stringer planes on both upper and lower surfaces of the full-scale box will be essentially\nidentical in planform to permit rib vertical stiffeners to be parallel.\nThe basic cross section of stringers is shown in Figure 5. Material for all stringers, upper and lower cover\npanels, is Fiber Innovations (0_+60)-degree triaxially braided tubes. Tubes are folded flat, forming a "stack"\nthat cures out to a thickness of 0.048 inch. Stringers are made in an "onion skin" style with a 14-tube\nstringer as the largest. By removing the outer stacks on either side of a 14-tube stringer, a 12-tube stringer\nis formed with the same internal cross-section.\nThis applies to each successively smaller stringer\n10\ntubes, 8 tubes, etc. Stringers vary in height in 0.25-inch increments, measured from the intersection of the\nstringer centerline and the IML. This incremental stringer height constraint was imposed to minimize the\nnumber of stringer height transitions, which also reduced the manufacturing\ncosts of the full-scale cover\npanels.\nEach tube of the stringer is the same width. Termination of the tubes at the skin IML is shown in\nFigure 5. An angle of 45 degrees was selected for the flange bevel. When the width of each tube is\ncalculated around the blade-to-flange\nradius, the outer tubes fall short of reaching the skin.\nFill material in the triangulm-like\nvoid under the blade will be made of woven cmbon fiber that is nearly\ntriangular in shape. Because the void has a constant cross section, with the exception of very minor\ngeometric changes due to the blade-to-flange\nangle, the fill material is the same for the full length of each\nstringer. Stringers are made by stacking tubes of correct length, and stitching the blade portion together.\nFlanges can then be bent out and the stringer stitched to the IML of the skin. The first stitch row defines\nthe tangent point of the radius between the blade and the flanges and is a constant distance from the\nflange end of the tubes. Blade height can then be trimmed. Note that this trim operation is delayed to the\nlast possible point, after the blade is stitched together.\n12\n\n--\n\n$83900\n\nBlade Thickness\n\nStrin\nHei\n\nCentroid\nHeight\n\nFill M\n\nW\n//Flange\n\nFigure\n\nSubstructure\n\nDesign.\n\nprimarily\nwebs\n\non hand\n\nto meet\n\nbulkheads\n\nSubstructure\n\nlay-up\n\ndamage\n\nwith limited\n\nthe full-scale\n\nwing\n\nconcepts\nscale\n\nthe semi-span\nenough\n\ncomponent,\n\nfor the ribs\n\nfabrication\n\ninto three\nwere:\n\nand bulkheads\n\nconfigmation\nrealistic\n\ncost\n\n*\n\nWebs\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStiffeners\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStiffener/Web\n\nthat\n\nand evaluated\n\ndesign/manufacturing\n\ninitially\n\nsubsequently\ndesign\n\nwing\n\nas a baseline\n\nfor these\n\ndesign\n\napproaches.\n\nFor\n\ndesign/manufactming\n\nmanufacturing\n\nconfiguration\n\nfor spar\n\nfor the ribs and\n\nto meet\n\nfabrication\n\non establishing\n\nfocused\nselected\n\nwork\n\nand stiflness\n\nfor low-cost\n\nof low-cost\n\nMD-90-40X\n\n2) was used\n\nstrength\n\nconcentrated\n\ntake advantage\n\nwas\n\nSubstructure\n\nthe substructure\n\nefforts\n\nconfigmation\n\napproach\n\nrequirements.\n\nto optimize\n\nestimates\n\ndesign/manufactming\ncategories\n\nS/RFI\n\nthe necessary\n\nThe full-scale\n(Figure\n\non the full-span\nThe\n\njoint\n\nstringer.\n\nthat provides\n\npreliminary\n\nenvironment.\n\nto allow\n\ntSeliminmy\n\nattempts\n\nFourteen-tube\n\napproaches.\n\nand bolted\n\nto structme\n\nrequirements\n\n5.\n\ndevelopments\n\nfabrication\n\ntolerance\n\nwas limited\n\nWidth\n\nJ\n\nCenterline\n\nprocesses\n\nin a large-\n\nwas still being\n\nstudies\n\nbecause\n\ndefined,\n\nso\n\nit was mature\n\nto be created.\n\nconcepts\n\nfor the full-scale\n\nby an Integrated\n\nconcepts\n\ndesign/manufacturing\ndesign/manufactming\n\nProduct\n\npertaining\n\nconcepts\n\nsubstructure\n(IPD)\n\nto web fabrication\n\npertaining\n\nconcepts\n\ntest component\nDevelopment\n\nto stiffener\n\npertaining\n\nteam.\n\nwere\n\narranged\n\nThe categories\n\nonly.\nfabrication\n\nto combined\n\nonly.\n\nstiffener/web\n\nfabrication.\n\n13\n\nMain Landing Gear Bulkhead.\nThe main landing gem (MLG) bulkhead was designed from the\nbeginning to be an integrally stiffened aluminum machining.\nThis is in part due to the high concentrated\nloads introduced to the wing at this location from the braked-roll, takeoff roll, and one-wheel landing load\nconditions.\nIn addition, previous analyses performed for the semi-span wing indicated that significant\nstress concentrations\nexisted around the mouseholes for the skin stringers. An optimized composite\nbulkhead design would require large ply buildups in the area of the mouseholes, resulting in a part that\nwould be very labor intensive and expensive to fabricate by hand layup. As previously noted, all other\ncomposite ribs for the full-scale wing were designed with a laminate family tailored for use with an\nautomated tape laying fabrication process to provide for ply drop-offs. The thickest laminate in this\nfamily is approximately\n0.25 inch. The requhed thickness near the aft MLG bulkhead mouseholes would\nneed to be significantly thicker and would not necessarily belong to the same laminate family. Thus, a\nseparate setup and run would be required for tape laying the MLG bulkheads, plus the associated costs to\nstore a number of bulkheads if more than one were made at a time. A machined part would allow the use\nof integral stiffeners in the design, reducing part count. A machined part also allows for the use of local\nthickness increases near areas of stress concentrations\nto be inexpensively\nincorporated.\nCenter\n\nWing Box\n\nFront Spar Splice. Front and rear spars also splice at the side-of-body bulkhead. The front spar splice is\na double-shear joint. Aluminum interior and exterior splice plates sandwich the composite center and\noutboard front spar webs and caps. Splice plates are dog bone shaped to splice both webs and caps. Two\nstaggered rows of 5/16-inch-diameter\nbolts are used through each spar web to meet sealing requirements.\nSix 5/16-inch-diameter\nbolts through each spar cap transfer the cap loads across the joint. Larger\nfasteners were preferred. However, the 4.0-inch spar cap height limitation (due to the stitching machine\ncapacity) restricted the size.\nRear\n\nSpar\n\nSplice\n\nTrapezoidal\n\nPanel\n\nThe trapezoidal panel is a cantilevered beam attached to the rear spar at the side-of-body joint. It extends\naft as a moment arm to react torque in the wing box. The bending loads in the trap panel are transferred\nto the wing box through an external cap (ski fitting) on the lower surface, which extends forward of the\nrear spar and mates to the lower skin splice plate. On the upper surface, the base flange of the flex tee\nextends aft, mating to the top of the trapezoidal panel. Vertical shear loads are transferred through\nfasteners common to the rear spar splice plate bathtub. In addition, two large tension bolts carry vertical\nshear loads by fastening through the bathtub portion of the lower external skin splice and the ski fitting.\n2.4\n\nAssembly\n\nTooling\n\nDesign\n\nand Build\n\nAssembly Fixture and Build Process. The integral cover panels used in the baseline design greatly\nsimplify the wing box assembly process. Because the rib and spar caps are already stitched and cured to\nthe skin, the substructure details are reduced to flat plates with vertical stiffeners. As the box is\nassembled, these members are mechanically attached to the integral caps that are part of the cover panel\nin a manner similar to the semi-span design (see reference 3.0 Semi-Span).\nThe major structural\ncomponents needed to complete the outboard section of the full-scale wing are shown in Figure 6.\nAn assembly jig was designed and built to allow assembly of the outer wing boxes (left and\nOne side of the jig, attached to the upper cover panel, can be moved along tracks to provide\nribs and the inner moldline (IML) of the skin panels.

Rib webs are located on the intercostals using pilot holes. Temporary attachments are\nused to position the ribs to the upper and lower covers. The lower cover temporary attachments are then\nremoved and the jig is opened with the ribs attached to the upper cover. The attachment holes are then\nprocessed in this opened condition.\nAfter the jig is closed, the ribs are again temporarily attached to the\nlower cover. The upper cover temporary attachments are then removed and the jig is opened. Fastener\nholes in the lower cover are then processed and the permanent fasteners installed. When the jig is again\nclosed, permanent fasteners are used to attach the upper cover to the fibs. The outboard and inboard spar\nweb sections are then located and installed. After the MLG fitting has been craned into position on the\nassembly fixture, the skin doublers are placed into position and used to attach the MLG fitting to the\nupper and lower covers of the wing box. The MLG-to-spar web attach angles are then installed. Final\nclose-out of the outboard wing box occurs with installation of the outboard and then inboard front spar\nweb sections.\nThe two completed outboard boxes are then joined to the center wing box at the side-of-body (SOB)\nbulkhead. The center wing box is then assembled around each outboard wing. Once the entire wing is\ncompleted, it would be mated with a section of fuselage barrel. The full-scale test article would then be\ncomplete, and installation of the load application/reaction\nhardware would be initiated.\n2.5\n\nFull-Scale\n\nTesting\n\nComposite\n\nConsiderations\n\nWing\n\nStructural\n\nVerification\n\nand Development\n\nThe full-scale test component consists of a composite wing box attached to an aluminum fuselage barrel.\nThe approximate overall dimensions of the component relative to the MD-90-40X airplane baseline are\nshown in Figure 7. The fuselage barrel is supported at each end and the wing is loaded by a series of load\njacks. Apart from the features that affect load transfer across the wing/fuselage\ninterface, the fuselage\nitself will not be evaluated during the test.\nThe objective of the test program was to validate the structural integrity of the design by subjecting the\ntest component to a variety of load conditions that closely simulated the actual flight loads of the baseline\nahcraft. This close simulation is of critical importance, because the weight and cost of the ahcraft must\nbe accurately predicted based on the design and performance\ndatabase developed for the full-scale test\ncomponent.\nThe testing approach selected for the full-scale wing is a commonly used technique that approximates\nthe\nflight loads environment\nfor the ground testing of large-scale wing structures.\nTo truly replicate the flight\nconditions, the applied loads must be proportionally\ndistributed across both the upper and lower surfaces\nof the wing box as pressure forces. Because this is difficult to achieve, and would place a constraint on\nthe out-of-plane deformations\nof skin elements, a more practical approach is to apply individual point\nloads at discrete locations on the wing. Then, as the number of point loads is increased, the discrete\nloading will more closely resemble the continuous pressure distribution of a true flight condition.\nFabrication and testing of the full-scale wing was not conducted due to NASA funding constraints and\nsubsequent reductions in program scope.\n\n16\n\nS 84041\n\nWing Test Section\n\n1\n\nSupport Structure\n\n86 ft\n/\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nMD-90-40X\nBaseline Air[\n\n",. ,_",,\n\n_42\n\nft\n\nFuselage Barrel\n\nFigure 7.

In the following discussion, the\nskin with stringers, spar caps, and intercostals will be referred to as the cover panel. The substructure\nincludes the spat webs, rib webs, stiffeners, and rib-to-spat attach brackets. The results are discussed\nbelow.\nThe composite wing box weight results, both in the room\nenvhonmental\nconditions, are shown in Figure 8. Because\nhot/wet and cold/dry conditions, the weights of upper and\nenvhonmental\nconditions are slightly higher than those in\nweight of the fasteners remains the same because they are\n\ntemperattue/dry\nand in the extreme\nof the reductions of design strength values in\nlower covers and skin pad-ups in the extreme\nthe room temperattue/dry\ncondition. The total\nmade of metal and influences from extreme\n\nenvhonmental\nconditions are minor. The total weight of the substructure changes slightly only because\nthey were designed mainly from the stiffness requirements.\nIt is noticed that even though the weights of\nupper and lower cover panels increase slightly, the weight percentages of structural components\nare\nsimilar in the RT/dry and in the extreme environmental\nconditions.\nThe cover panels, including the skin\npad-ups, make up 75% (in the RT/dry condition) or 76% (in the extreme environmental\nconditions) of the\ntotal weight. The substructure makes up 20% (in the RT/dry condition) or 19% (in the extreme\nenvhonmental\nconditions)\ncomposite wing.\n\nof the total weight, and the fasteners\n\nmake up 2% of the total weight of the\n\n17\n\n$84098\n\nRT/Dry\n\nCondition\n\nSubstructures\n20%\n\nFasteners\n(Bolts and\n2%\n80 Ib\n\nExtreme Environmental\nConditions\nUpper\nCover\n\nFasteners\n(Bolts and Nuts)\n\nSubstructures\n19%\n\nUpper\nCover\n\nUpper\nLower Skil\nPad-u\n3%\n1O0 Ib\n\n34%\n1385 Ib\n\n1444 Ib\n\nTotal Wing Box Weight = 4019 Ib\n\nFigure\n\n8.

The upper skin is heavier than the\nlower skin (895 pounds versus 761 pounds in the RT/dry condition and 974 pounds versus 803 pounds in\nthe extreme environmental\nconditions).\nAlso, the upper stringers/caps\nare heavier than the lower\nstringers/caps\n(694 pounds versus 544 pounds in the RT/dry condition and 707 pounds versus 561 pounds\nin the extreme environmental\nconditions).\nThis is because the upper cover was mainly designed by\ncompression loads, and the lower cover was mainly designed by tension loads in the 2.5-g upbending\ncondition.\nThe stringent CAI strength and structural stability criteria imposed on the upper cover (for\ncompression)\ngave it some weight penalty over the lower cover. Another reason for the lighter lower\ncover is that the IM7/AS4 hybrid fibers were used in the lower skin and the AS4 fibers were used in the\nupper skin as the basic fabrics. The IM7/AS4 hybrid fibers outperformed\nthe AS4 fibers in tension\nproperties and gave the lower cover some weight saving advantages over the upper cover.\nThe weight breakdowns of each cover panel are shown in Figures 10 and 11. It is interesting to note that\nin both cover panels, the upper and lower skin weights make up similar percentages (54% and 56% for\nthe upper and 55% for the lower) of the panel weights.\nSubstructure weights are summarized in Figure 12. Because substructures were designed mostly by\nstiflness requhements\nrather than by strength criteria, their weight differences are minimal in the RT/dry\nand in the extreme envhonmental\nconditions.\nThe substructures\ninclude the spars, ribs, and bulkheads but\nnot the side-of-body bulkhead or any external fittings. The weights in Figure 12 also exclude fasteners\nand spar access hole cover panels. The front spars make up 23% (in the RT/dry condition) or 24% (in the\nextreme environmental\nconditions), the rear spars make up 21%, and the ribs make up 38% of the\nsubstructure weight. Also, the MLG bulkhead makes up 10% (in the RT/dry condition) or 9% (in the\nextreme\nweight.\n\n18\n\nenvironmental\n\nconditions)\n\nand the rib/spar\n\nattachment\n\nbrackets\n\nmake up 8% of the substructure\n\nS84099\n\nRT/Dry\n\nExtreme\nEnvironmental\nConditions\n\nCondition\n\n1200 .........................................................................................................................................\n\n1200 ...........................................................................................................................................\n\n1000-\n\n1000-\n\n895\n\n800-\n\n&\n\n600400200-\n\n6no\n\nFigure\n\n9.\n\nComparison\n\n800600400200-\n\nof composite\n\nwing\n\nupper\n\nand\n\nlower\n\ncover\n\npanel\n\nweights.\nS84100\n\nExtreme\nRT/Dry\n\nCondition\n\nEnvironmental\nConditions\n\nUpper Intercostals\n4%\n\nUpper Intercostals\n4%\n\nStringers/\nCaps\n42%\n694 Ib\n\nSkin\n54%\n895 Ib\n\nUpper\n\nCover\nFigure\n\nThe weight\nresults\n\nsavings\n\nconstraint,\n\nconditions.\nare used\n\n10.\n\nWeight\n\nwing\n\n= 1659\n\nComposite\n\nof the composite\n\nof the composite\n\nenvhonmental\n\nPanel\n\nwing\n\nwing\n\nWeights\n\nfor the weight\n\nIb\nupper\n\ncover\n\ncalculations.\n\npanel\n\nstudies\n\ntemperature/dry\n\nof the aluminum\nsaving\n\nSkin\n56%\n974 Ib\n\nUpper\n\nin the trade\n\nboth in the room\n\n40%\n707 Ib\n\nwing,\n\nCover\nweight\n\nare listed\n\nThe results\n\n= 1751\n\nIb\n\n1.

The tension repair test, which failed\nin the grips with a total load of 822 kips, generated a design stress of 50 ksi for the upper cover panels\n(with all AS4 fibers in the fabric) and 55 ksi for the lower cover panels (with IM7/AS4 hybrid fibers in\nthe fabric). The compression\nrepair test, which failed at the bolt hole of the supporting structure with the\ntest rib subjected to a load of 863 kips, generated a design stress of -45 ksi for both the upper and the\nlower panels. However, the above noted tension repair design values (50 ksi for upper cover panels and\n55 ksi for lower cover panels) and compression repair design values (-45 ksi for both upper and lower\ncover panels) are considered to be too conservative.\nSince there is no other justifiable repair design\nvalues to use at the time the trade studies were performed, these low repair design values were still used\nin the analysis.\nThe optimal airfoil and planform configurations\nchosen for the generic 220-passenger\naircraft composite\nwing resulted in an aspect ratio of 12.1, which is too high for the aluminum wing. Generally, the aspect\nratio of production aluminum wings is around 8.5. The advantage of using the high aspect ratio for the\ncomposite wing is to be able to achieve a better aerodynamic performance.\nHowever, using the high\naspect ratio for aluminum wings generates a high wing tip deflection that makes designers worry about\nthe wing\'s aileron effectiveness\nand aeroelasticity effects (such as flutter). Therefore, deflection\nconstraint, which is similar to applying the equivalent bending stiffness as the composite wing, was\nimposed on the wing tip of the aluminum wing. The aluminum wing weight was re-calculated\nby\nimposing a stiffness constraint that requfl-ed the wing tip deflection of the aluminum wing to be the same\n\n21\n\nasthatof thecomposite ing.

It is preferable to use less moistureabsorbent stitching fibers for future designs. Resin/fiber combinations that are micro-crack resistant\nshould be evaluated.\nThe CAI strengths for the upper cover are low for thin-laminate\nstructures, even with stitching. The\nlow strengths had a significant impact on the weight savings in the wing tip area. A more impactresistant resin should be considered for the upper cover in order to achieve a higher weight saving.\nThe composite intercostals are much heavier than the butterfly clips used for the aluminum wing.\nis suggested that the intercostal design concept be further investigated in future composite wing\ndesigns from a weight and manufacturing\ncost consideration.\n\nIt\n\nThe torsional stiffness of the composite wing is less than the stiffness of the aluminum wing. As a\nresult, the composite wing tip twists more than the aluminum wing. This can be improved by using\nmore 45-degree fibers in the fabric. The contents of the 0-, 45-, and 90-degree fibers should be\noptimized for future composite wing designs.\n\n.\n\nThe non-buckling\ndesign requirement at DUL on the upper and lower covers may be too stringent.\nA different criterion, which allows the skins to buckle at DLL, should be investigated and\nanalytically validated by large component tests.\n\n23\n\n3.\n\nSemi-Span\n\nWing\n\nDesign,\n\nAnalysis,\n\nand Supporting\n\nTechnology\n\nA specific objective of the semi-span wing development was to demonstrate technology readiness through\nprocessing, scale-up, and structural testing. This semi-span wing box was initially aimed at developing\nand verifying design and manufactming\ntechniques to be used in the design, manufacture,\nand test of a\nfollow-on full-scale aircraft wing.\nTo develop detail design features of a composite wing, along with the associated analytical and\nmanufactming\ntechniques, a representative\ncomposite wing box structure was established.\nThe wing box\nwas derived from an aircraft representative\nof the next generation of commercial aircraft. This nextgeneration twin-engined\naircraft carries up to 220 passengers.\nIt has a supercritical airfoil wing with an\naspect ratio of 12:1 that was optimized using composite material properties. The semi-span test box\nrepresents the first 42 feet of the wing starting from the aircraft side-of-body splice out towards the wing\ntip (Figure 13).\nThe semi-span wing box consists of an upper and lower S/RFI cover, two spars, and 18 fibs. The rib\nspacing is a nominal 30 inches. To take advantage of the S/RFI process, many components were\nintegrated into the cover panels to reduce the assembled part count, thousands of fasteners, and their\nassociated costs. Each cover panel consists of multiple stacks ofuniaxial\nwarp knit carbon fiber material\nthat is stitched together to form the wing skin. Additional structural details are also stitched into the skin\npanel to form an assembly: blade stiffeners to give added stability, and interleaved spar caps and\nintercostal clips for substructure attachment.\nThe completed dry preform assembly (Figure 14) is then\nplaced inside rigid tooling and infused with resin in an autoclave. The spacing between the stringers was\nset at 7.6 inches. As a comparison, typical aluminum wing panels normally have a 6.5-inch stringer\nspacing.\n\n42ft.\n\nFigure 13.

The spar webs are S/RFI multiaxial warp knit\nmaterial dominated by 45-degree fibers. The substructure stiffening elements are fabricated by\nsecondarily bonding precured stiffeners to precured flat webs. The ribs and bulkheads have\npredetermined\npilot holes. The spin webs me drilled full size in place with the covers using drill\ntemplates prior to bonding of the stiffeners. The substructure is assembled to the cover panels using\nmechanical fasteners to complete the box assembly (Figure 15).\nThe semi-span wing box is not an optimized wing box design. It does, however, contain many important\ndesign features which have emerged as potential solutions to issues that need to be addressed in the\ndesign of an S/RFI composite wing box for commercial aircraft applications.\nThey include:\nStringer and spin cap blade height and thickness transitions.\nInterleaving of the spar caps.\nMetallic fittings at load-introduction\npoints.\nTight tolerance planer mating surfaces (no shims).\nStringer transitions over skin stacks.\nBuildups for root splice and oft-axis material buildup at MLG attachment.\nSpanwise stack splice.\nStrengthened\nintercostal tab attachments with mechanical fasteners.\nAccess and systems cutouts in the lower cover, spar webs, ribs and bulkheads.\nInternal and external skin stack terminations both chordwise and spanwise.\nInboard (joint) and outboard stringer runouts.\nSpar cap darting.\nThe use of filler material in the intercostal-to-sUinger\nflanges.\n\n25\n\n$84849\n\nUpper\n\ncover\n\npanel\n\nnding\n\ngear fitting\n\nBulkheads\nRear spar\n\nLower\n\ncover\n\npanel\n\nRibs\nFront spar\n\nFigure 15.

Loads were introduced with\nhydraulic jacks to simulate representative\naircraft design requirements.\nA series of tests concluded with\nthe box being damaged by impact, repaired, and tested to design limit load and then to the ultimate failure\nload.\nAnalysis\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis section presents the stress analysis for the advanced subsonic technology (AST) semi-span\ncomposite wing box fabricated under NASA contract NAS 1-20546. The baseline aircraft selected for this\nstudy is the D-3308-4 configuration\nof the proposed Boeing 220-passenger,\nsingle-class, transport aircraft\nshown in Figure 15. The design weights for this aircraft are maximum take off gross weight (MTOGW)\n= 180 kips and maximum landing weight (MLW) = 167.5 kips. The semi-span wing component is a\nproof-of-concept\ntest article that will reduce the manufacturing\nrisk for fabrication of a full-scale\ncomposite wing. The semi-span wing box does not include optimized stringer and rib spacing.

This material is a\nmultiaxial carbon fiber fabric. Type 1 laminates consist of AS4 fibers only. Type 2 laminates consist of\nIM7 fibers in the 0-degree direction and AS4 fibers in the 45- and 90-degree directions. The laminate\nclasses also specify the fiber pattern (0\xc2\xb0/45\xc2\xb0/90\xc2\xb0).\nClass 72 and Class 74 have fiber pattern percentages of\n(44.9/42.9/12.2)\nand (30.0/59.9/10.1)\nrespectively.\n\n28\n\nTable 2.

This material is a 2-D\ntriaxial braided fabric that consists of (0_+60)-degree braid, AS4 6k bias fibers, and IM7 36k axial fibers.\nThe bias fibers and axial fibers make up, respectively, 56% and 44% of the total fibers.\nThe lower cover skin and spar caps use Type 2 laminates because they have higher tensile strength. Other\nstructural members using Type 2 laminates include the spar webs and intercostals.\nThe upper cover skin,\nstringers, and spar caps use Type 1 laminates because they have higher compression strength. The lower\nstringers use the triaxial braided composite material because of the lower surface curvature of the lower\ncover panel. The bulkheads and ribs are stiffened panels that use a carbon/epoxy\n(AS4 fibers/3501-6\nresin) prepreg tape DMS 2224 material.

Design\n\nDevelopment\n\nTest Articles\n\n(DDTA\'s)\n\nIntroduction\nThe fabrication and evaluation of the Design Development\nTest Articles (DDTAs) were conducted in\nparallel to the development of the semi-span wing test article. Fabricating and testing the DDTAs\nprovided building block manufacturing\nexperiences with larger S/RFI structures, provided design values\nfor key structmal features, enabled different design approaches to be evaluated, and demonstrated the\nstructural performance on the subcomponent\nlevel for S/RFI structmes.\nEach of these goals benefited the\ndevelopment of S/RFI technology and aided in the development of the semi-span test article. In this\nsection, the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Wing DDTA program is summarized\n\nMaster\n\nPanel\n\nGeneral\n\nTooling\n\nFabrication\n\nand Respective\n\nApproach\n\nDescription\n\nA stitching fiame for both the thick and thin master panel configurations was designed to support two full\npreforms in a side by side stitching configuration.\nThe primary purpose of a stitching frame is to secure\nthe Saertex material edges down with a series of clamps and allow the stitching head to stitch the preform.\nA typical skin stitching pattern for a full-sized two preform master panel is shown in Figure 19.\nHowever, fabric handling problems such as sagging at the center section of the side-by-side preforms was\nexperienced during initial DDTA stitching tasks. The solution to this issue was to stitch only one preform\nat a time.\nFigure 20 is an illustration of the master panel stitching frame tool used to stitch the large DDTA\npreforms. To reduce fabricating cost and weight issues associated with fabricating the stitching frames,\n6061-T6 aluminum alloy material was selected and used to fabricate all the required stitching frame\ncomponents.\nThe stitching frame details were precision machined with computer controlled equipment\nand then jig-bored to control tolerances between mating detail assemblies.\nAssembly of the stitching\nframe was accomplished\nusing a series of steel brackets, clamps, and fasteners. The stitching frame was\nalso equipped with a number of precision pins along the edges of the aluminum frame. These pins were\nrequfled for the precise location of stringers and intercostal clip preform details on the skin during the\nstitching process. A complete master panel consists of as many as five stiffeners and two rib planes of\nintercostal clips.\nUse of the stringer and intercostal jig tooling requfles that the preform details me properly trimmed to the\ncorrect dimensions.\nNext, these stringer and intercostal details are loaded into their appropriate jig such\nthat the blades are located solidly into the tool. A series of bolts is then tightened to secure the stringer or\nintercostal preforms in these locating tooling jigs. Once the blades me secured in the tooling, the preform\nflanges me folded out and fillets are inserted into the void zone left by the flanges. Fillets me requfled in\nstringer or intercostal preforms that have more than four stacks of Saertex material, and both unidirectional\ntwisted tow and woven fillet materials were used over the course of the DDTA fabrication effort.\nOnce a jig is located in its proper position, the flanges of the specific preform component me stitched to\nthe panel skin. In order to prevent the jig from interfering with the stitching head motion, the first flange\nstitch row begins 0.40 inches from the stringer blade. This stitching constraint still allowed five stitch\nrows to be sewn on either flange of a stringer or intercostal preform.\n\n33\n\nS84522\n\nPreform #1\n\nPreform #2\n\nFigure 19.

Master Panel Stitching\n\n34\n\nFrame\n\nTool.\n\nJig\n\nDuring the early RFI process development\nstages on the AST Composite Wing program, autoclave\nprocedures for cure cycles were established.\nIt was determined the heat-up rate and cool down period for\nsmaller structural panels could be achieved using a solid aluminum block design approach for the inner\nmold line (IML) tools. The RFI tooling blocks are designed to form the inner mold line of the panel by\napplying pressure to the stringer blades, intercostal clips, and IML interface during the RFI cure process.\nAdditionally, the use of solid aluminum blocks was found to also save machining cost and processing\ntime. The size and complexity of the DDTA panels were determined to be within the established\nprocessing boundaries where the use of aluminum blocks was an adequate RFI tooling approach.\nAll RFI tooling blocks for DDTA panels were solid and fabricated from 6061-T6 Aluminum alloy\nmaterial as illustrated in Figme 21. After the machining process was complete, all tooling blocks were\nthoroughly inspected to cover unacceptable\ndimensions or defects.\nDescription\n\nof the DDTA Master\n\nPanel Configurations\n\n"A" and "B"\n\nThe master panel concept was developed by manufacturing engineering\'s\ndesire to use common stitching\nand resin film infusion (RFI) tools to fabricate the design development test articles (DDTA). DDTA\npanels that utilized this master panel concept included the following panels: DDTA #3 and D4, Stringer\nRunout (tension and compression); DDTA #6, Upper Skin and Stringer (compression);\nDDTA #9,\nBulkhead (shear), DDTA #19, Skin Ply Drop-Off (tension and compression); and DDTA #20, Rib Clip\nPull-Off.\nThe "A" version of the master panel represented a thick configuration;\nwhereas, master panel "B"\nthin configuration.\nA typical master panel preform, shown in Figure 22, consisted of a skin panel\na 90-inch length and a 58-inch width. This preform was fabricated with three full-length stringers,\nstringer runout, an angled spar-cap, and intercostal clips. The schematic diagram shown in Figure\nhighlights the differences between panel versions "A" and "B" in terms of number of Saertex skin\nstringer thickness, and stringer height.\n\nwas a\nthat had\na\n23\nstacks,\n\n$84524\n\nTypical Solid Aluminum\n\nRFI Block\n\nFigure 21.

DDTA Test Specimens (number in parenthesis refers to the\nnumber of replicates for each different specimen).\n\nFinal\n\nConclusions\n\nfor DDTA\n\nTesting\n\nIn the Design Development\nTest Article test program, many large test elements were fabricated and\ntested. The test program provided valuable fabrication experience and structural verification of stitched\nresin film infusion component designs. It demonstrated\nthe structural performance\nof many different\ndesign features including heavily loaded splice joints, stringer runouts, intercostals, and spar caps. It also\nprovided verification of the analytical methods developed for S/RFI structure. For example, the test of\nthe Upper Cover Root Splice Joint (DDTA #1) established that the analysis methods used for the semispan test article were conservative.\nAdditionally, design values were derived for intercostal shear and\ntensile strengths, spar cap shear strength, and stack drop-offs.\nFor instance, the DDTA #9 tests defined an\nintercostal shem design value of 2.16 kips/in, and the DDTA #9 analysis indicated that this was\nconservative because in the test specimen the load was not evenly distributed to three intercostal tabs.\nThe information generated from the DDTA tests was essential for the development\nand analysis of the\nsemi-span wing test article. The DDTA testing also provided a means to compare different structural\ndesign configurations.\nSome of these comparisons\nare discussed in the following paragraphs.\nIn the DDTA #3 and D4 tests, a constant height and two tapered height stringer runout designs were\nevaluated for both a thin and a thick configuration.\nTable 4 provides a summary of the tension stringer\nrunout tests and Table 5 summarizes the compression stringer runout tests. In each of the tension stringer\nrunout tests, the terminated stringer delaminated from the skin. The initial delamination\nwas arrested by\nthe stitches, but at higher loads the delamination propagated along the entire length of the terminated\nstringer transferring the load to the remaining two stringers and skin prior to the overall failure.

In all of the tension runout\nspecimens, final delamination occurred at loads 15 to 32% below the ultimate failure load. Although the\nfinal delaminations\noccurred above the design ultimate loads, additional design improvement\nshould be\ninvestigated to prevent delamination and enable better structural performance.\nThis might include\nreducing the taper angle, increasing the compliance of the stringer, or adding double density stitching or\nmechanical fasteners at the tip of the runout.\nIn the compression runout tests, stringer delamination was less of a problem. In the thin tapered\nspecimens and the thick tapered specimens with an 8\xc2\xb0 runout taper, post test examinations showed no\nindication of delamination between the terminated stringer and skin. In the thick tapered specimens with\nan 11 \xc2\xb0 runout taper, strain gage data indicated the occurrence of limited delamination in the two\nspecimens at 610 kips and extended delamination in one specimen at 700 kips just prior to failure. The\nthick constant height specimen had limited delamination\n(5-6 inches) at the tip, but the delamination did\nnot propagate further along the stringer as was observed in the tension specimens.\nOverall, the constant\nheight runouts performed better than the tapered runout for both the thick and thin configurations\nin these\ncompression evaluations.\n\n39\n\nIn theDDTA#16andG1tests,heshear trength sparcaps\nt\ns\nof\nwasdetermined several\nfor\ndifferent\nconfigurations\nasshown Figure These\nin\n25.\nresults\nclearlyshowthattheintroduction darts\nof\n(cutsin the\nsparcapwhichprevent rinkling)donotaffecttheshear trength thesparcap.

The AST\nprogram uses the Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25 document as its principal certification guideline. A\ndiscrete source damage (DSD) event is described in Section 25.571 of this document as one facet of a\ndamage-tolerant design that must be considered for certification. A DSD event is an incident that is\nimmediately apparent to an aircraft\' s flight crew or ground personnel at the time of its occurrence, and the\ndamaged structure must withstand at least 70% of its design limit load. This type of damage is often\ncaused by projectiles emanating fiom disintegrating\nengine components with variations in projectile mass,\nvelocity, and impact location. These variables create a complex problem for engineers designing\nstructures that are DSD tolerant. To reduce this design complexity, DSD evaluations are typically\nsimplified by evaluating the residual strength of multi-stringer\ntest panels containing a two-bay crack or\nslot across a principal stiffening element. Certification guidelines also state that any future application of\ncomposite materials in primary structures will be required to demonstrate a level of damage tolerance\nafter the occurrence of such an event. Therefore, the successful development and verification of a DSD\nanalysis methodology for stitched composites would reduce future certification costs of any advanced\ncomposite structures fabricated with these materials.\nTest Panel and Material\nDescription.\nEight panel configurations\nwere used in the Durability and\nDamage Tolerance (D&DT) evaluations of S/RFI structures.\nThe DSD test matrix (Table 6) shows the\ntest specimens were evenly divided between tension and compression\ntest mticles. Both compression\nand\ntension test panels were constructed from orthotropic stacks of warp-knit fabric having a cmbon fiber\norientation of [45/-45/02/90/02/-45/45].\nAs noted in Table 6, the only difference between the materials\nused for either the tension or compression specimens was the type of fibers used to construct the fabric.\nThe compression specimens contained only the standmd modulus HTA 5131 fibers from Tenax, while the\ntension specimens contained intermediate modulus IMS 5131 fibers from Tenax in the zero-degree\ndirection and HTA 5131 fibers in the other three orientations.\nFour panel geometries were evaluated for each type of warp-knit fabric used to fabricate the test\nspecimens.\nBlade height and skin thickness were the two variables selected for evaluation.\nAll the panels\nwere fabricated with three warp-knit stiffeners, and the height measurement was made from the base of\nthe blade-stiffener\nto the blade tip, as shown at location A in Figure 26. Blade heights of 1.8 inches and\n2.3 inches were used in this study. Two skin thickness combinations,\nas indicated at location B in\nFigure 26, were also used to construct the panels described in Table 6. These geometry variations\nallowed this study to compare how a panel\'s stiffening ratio affected its DSD damage tolerance behavior.\nA panel\'s stiffening ratio is defined as stiffener cross-sectional\narea divided by the section\'s total crosssectional area because the same material is used for both the skin and stringers.\nEach panel\'s stiffening\nratio is shown in the last column of Table 6. Blade thickness was held constant for each panel at eight\nstacks. This dimension is indicated at location C in Figure 26. Figure 26 also shows the width of each\npanel at location D.\n\n41\n\nTable 6.

Cross-section\n\nof typical three-stringer\n\nDSD test article.\n\nAll the test specimens were derived from individual stitched dry fiber preforms fabricated to a consistent\nset of manufacturing\nspecifications\ndeveloped by the AST Composite Wing program. These preforms\nwere all stitched at 40 penetrations per square inch, with a 0.2 inch row spacing. A 1600-denier Kevlar\n29 penetration thread and a 400-denier Kevlar 29 bobbin thread were used to stitch these preforms\ntogether. Hexcel\'s 3501-6RC epoxy resin system was used to infuse the preforms.\nAll the panels were\nsuccessfully processed without any abnormalities.\nUltrasonic inspections were conducted after preform\ninfusion as a final check on panel quality. No fabrication abnormalities\nwere identified in any panel by\nthese C-scan inspections.\nDSD Geometry.\nAn initial demonstration\nof discrete somce damage tolerance of S/RFI materials\napplicable to primary wing structures used machined slots (saw cuts) to simulate DSD sites. Also, prior\ndiscussions with Federal Aviation Administration\nand B-2 bomber durability and damage tolerance\npersonnel strongly suggested the use of a two-bay slot to demonstrate DSD residual strength of composite\nstructures.\nThis geometry provides a low-cost alternative to ballistic tests, and it produces a repeatable\n\n42\n\ndamage\nwere\n\nsite at a precise\n\npositioned\n\nin the

A tension\n\ntest article positioned\n\nin the loading frame.\n\nA photoelastic film was mounted on the outer mold line (OML) surface of each three-stringer panel. This\nfilm was 0.125-inch thick with a 0.15 strain optical coefficient.\nPhotoelastic fringe patterns were\nobserved using a NASA-Langley\nsupplied polariscope.\nSuch data provided information on the strain\nfields that developed under the film in each panel. The strain fields around the slot radii were monitored\nusing this technique, and the loads introduced into the test sections of each panel were also recorded.\nPhotoelastic data were recorded by still photography\nthrough the polariscope.\nTwo video cameras were used to record how damage developed in each specimen\'s test section. One\ncamera recorded damage propagation on the OML surface of a test article, and the second camera\nobserved damage growth on the IML surface. With audible load call outs at each 10 kip load increment,\nthese video recordings proved an invaluable aid in assessing when damage propagation occurred in the\ntest specimens.\nCompression\nDSD Failure Behavior.\nDamage development\nin the compression specimens progressed\nin a stable manner from the slot radii toward the outer stringer flanges. The development\nof this type of\nfailure mode from a flaw site is consistent with behavior observed in compression-dominated\npost-impact\nfatigue tests performed on S/RFI materials.\nThe stringer-flange regions of the test articles are indicated at\nlocation E in Figure 26. Once the compression damage reached the flanges of the test articles, the\ndamage progress was halted until at least an additional 5 kips was applied to the panel. The additional\nload required to cause ultimate panel failme through the outer stringers indicates the stitched stringers can\ninhibit damage growth. The minimum load value of 5 kips requhed to cause catastrophic failure was\nobserved in the test article having the highest stiffener ratio (0.462). Therefore, this stiffener ratio appears\nto be near a design limit that can halt damage propagation in S/RFI structures due to a DSD event.\n\n45\n\nA close-up\nviewof oneedge afailedcompression\nof\ntestarticle shown Figure Thispictureis a\nis\nin\n30.\ntypicalviewof thefailures\nobserved thecompression\nin\ntestarticles.Thecompression\nfailures\ndisplayed\nclassic\ntransverse surfaces\nshear\ntypicallyobserved stitched\nin\ncomposites.\nAnothereature thefailure\nf\nof\nmode these\nof\ncompression\ntestarticles\nincluded\nnoobservedtringer ull-off.\ns\np\nTension\nDSD\n\nFailure Behavior.\nGenerally, the three-stringer\ntension specimen failures are\ncharacterized by initiation of damage at the radii of the slots. Increasing the applied load on each panel\ncaused the tension failure damage to rapidly propagate transversely to the loading direction until it\nreached the inner flanges of the outer stringer region of each specimen.\nOnce this tension damage\nreached the outer stringer flanges, the damage then propagated parallel to the flanges in the loading\ndirection. This vertically oriented translaminar shear failure mode was observed in all four tension test\narticles, and the stable propagation of this shear failure mode continued until the damage neared the\nloading tabs and caused catastrophic panel failure. A post-test view of a tension panel is shown in\nFigure 31.\nBecause of the highly orthotropic material properties of the S/RFI panels, failure modes could be directly\nrelated to material directionality.\nOnce tension failures propagated from the slot radii to the inner flanges\nof the outer stringers, the load on the skin in the bays adjacent to the outer stringers diminished\nsignificantly.\nThe strain gage data shown in Figure 32 are graphical representations\nof this behavior. The\nstrain gages are located as shown in the inserted diagram of the panel. The large strain variation can be\nobserved between the flange-mounted\ngage (#32 IML) and skin gage (#34 IML) that are separated by less\nthan 0.5-inch. Development\nof translaminar damage in the tension test articles necessitated the\ndevelopment\nof shear coupon test data to refine the material database, and this led to the creation of the\nunified S/RFI database. The development\nof this strain pattern also indicates the tension panels were not\nlong enough to allow loads in the outer stringers to be transferred into the adjacent skin bay and central\nstringer through shear-lag.\nIt is suggested that this finite length issue be evaluated in future DSD\nevaluations on S/RFI test specimens.\n\ners\n\n3aw Cut\n\nFigure 30.

Analytical predictions of tension residual strengths were also reasonably\nclose to the experimental values. The pre-test tension predictions were conservatively\nbelow the test\nresults by no more than 5%, and the post-test analyses were within 12% of panel failure loads using the\nunified material database.\nConclusions\nThe primary focus of this study was the evaluation of discrete source damage tolerance of S/RFI\nstructures applicable to commercial primary wing designs. Four three-stringer panel configurations\nwere\ntested under both tension and compression loads. After discrete source damage was introduced into each\npanel using a machined slot, theh residual strength was determined.\nThese experimental results were then\ncompared to analytical results obtained through the use of a discrete source damage analysis\nmethodology.\nExperimental\nresults provided positive evidence of the discrete source damage tolerance that stitched\nstructures can offer to advanced aircraft designs. Damage always initiated at the slot radii and then was\nhalted at the stringers for both the compression\nand tension test articles. The compression specimens\ninitiated stable damage growth away from the slot radii toward the stringers, and then these panels\ndisplayed no further damage propagation until they failed catastrophically\nacross the stringers at a higher\nload. However, tension damage propagation was characterized by rapid initiation of damage from the\nradii to the stringers.\nOnce the damage was stopped at the stringers, increasing loads caused the\ndevelopment\nof stable translaminar shear damage propagation along each stringer.\nA discrete source damage analysis methodology was compared to the experimental results. Initially,\nresidual strength predictions were made prior to each test using this DSD analysis methodology,\nand these\npredictions demonstrated\nthe analysis process was capable of reasonable accuracy when calculating the\nresidual strength of the S/RFI panels containing discrete source damage. Post-test refinements to this\nmethodology used a unified material database for S/RFI composite materials to recalculate the residual\nstrengths of each test article. These post-test analytical results showed the methodology was able to\npredict failures within 12% of the experimental values.\nThese analytic results were obtained using a relatively coarse GENOA FEA mesh and a minimally\ndemonstrated\nmaterial database. Refinements to both these elements of the DSD analysis methodology\ncould improve its failure prediction capabilities.\nIssues concerning the computational\nintensity of this\nanalysis methodology should also be mitigated in the future as faster computer processors become more\navailable. Such an analysis process, if completely developed, should reduce the cost and time required to\ncertify the damage tolerance of S/RFI primary wing structures subjected to DSD events. While additional\nrefinements and verifications will be required to gain added confidence in this discrete source damage\nanalysis methodology,\nthis study demonstrated\nthe potential of the approach to adequately model residual\nstrengths of S/RFI structures.\n5O\n\n5. Manufacturing\n5.1\n\nStudiesmProcess\n\nDevelopment\n\nS/RFI\n\nIntroduction\nIn order to determine the most critical parameters in the S/RFI process, Boeing performed a QFD (Quality\nFunction Deployment)\nassessment.\nIn this analysis, key quality and processing parameters were placed in\na matrix and ranked as to theft correlation\nstrong, moderate, or weak. Additionally, the importance of\nthe quality requirements\nto the customer were also ranked in a similar manner\nvery strong, strong,\nmoderate, weak, or very weak. The quality vs. processing matrix was then multiplied by the customer\nimportance matrix to rank the most critical processing parameters.\nA summary of these rankings is\nshown in Table 8.\nThe QFD process permitted a quantifiable technical evaluation of all critical parameters identified.\nFurthermore,\nthe parameters that were most critical to the customer could similarly be identified.\nThe\nQFD matrix, as shown in Table 8, allowed the technical rankings to be combined with the items of most\nimportance to the customer such that these could be ranked in a meaningful way. In this manner the areas\nof most importance could be identified to permit the planning of a process development program that\nwould yield the greatest benefit to improving the S/RFI process.\nThis study addresses several critical parameters affecting preform quality in the S/RFI process.\nTechniques to measure the thickness of carbon fabrics accurately were developed and the effects of\nstitching speed, thread tension, and presser foot pressure were quantified.\nControlled thickness\nmeasurements\nled to improved material quality control. Improved control of stitching parameters resulted\nin more consistent stitched preform quality. Furthermore,\nthe improvement in the understanding\nof these\nitems led to the creation of a visual guide in the form of a stitching standard that provides stitch machine\noperators with a guide to stitch preforms properly. Such a visual standard is provided for each machine to\nfurnish a visual aid at all times to the stitching operator to aid in identifying suitable stitch formation.\nIn addition to these developments,\nthe effects of needle wear on knot formations were examined to further\naid stitch machine operators in identifying worn needles so that timely replacement could be made before\nany damage to the preforms occurs. The visual stitch standard helps the operator in identifying needle\nwear as well. Lastly, 3-D woven fillets were selected from a variety of fillets to improve the quality of\nT-blade stiffeners. These 3-D fillets significantly reduced the handling and cost compared to the\npreviously used fillets. All these developments\nled to significant improvements\nin the quality of preforms\nused in the Composite Wing Program.\n5.2\n\nRFI Temperature\n\nCycle\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe objective of the temperature cycle investigation was to examine the 3501-6 reduced catalyst (RC)\nepoxy resin system (Hexcel, Magna, UT) using rheology testing and part fabrication to determine the\ntemperature ramp rates that would satisfy RFI processing requirements.\nSpecifically, the minimum\nallowable temperature-rise\nrate for 3501-6 RC resin was to be determined and temperature cycle\nguidelines to reduce risk in the RFI processing of semi-span wing cover panels.\n\n51\n\n9NIqOO.LI_\n\nuo!lnq!Jls!a\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nqlo13 peel8\n\nlunouJvqloI3\n\npeel8\n\npeel8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3E\n\n[]\n\nQ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n\n6\xc2\xa3\n\n\xc2\xa3!.\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\nZ\xc2\xa3\n\n#!.\n\n[]\n\nQ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n\nZ!.!.\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa3#\n\n6!.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\n\xc2\xa36\n\n9\n\nu!se_l\n\nuo!Inq!J1SK3 u!se_l le!l!Ul\n\nu!se_l le!l!Ul\n\nuo!leOollV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\npoqlelAI 6u!sse6eo/6u!uJl!=l\nlueluo3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\n2-Z\n\nu!se_l\n\neJnsseJd\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa38\n\n8\n\nuJnnoeAle!l!Ul\n\nleu!-I\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n\nO\n\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nL\xc2\xa3\n\n#!.\n\neJnsseJd le!l!Ul\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQ\n\n\xc2\xa3E!.\n\nelo/_O eJnsseJd\n\no\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1ooqsJeA O pu_\n\n[]\n\nelleO ]Jed puE\nplOH pu_\n\n[]\n\nduJe_l leeH puE\n1ooqsJeAO lS !.\nelle(3 _ed\n\nIs!.\n\nplOH ls!.\nduJe_l leeH ls!.\n\n0\n0\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n0\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0_\n\n\xc2\xa3!.\n\n\xc2\xa3_\n\n\xc2\xa3Z\n\n0!.\n\n\xc2\xa3Z\n\n0!.\n\n\xc2\xa38\n\n8\n\n\xc2\xa36\n\n0[3\nOn\nOn\n0[3\n\n_\n\n9\n\n[]\n\n6\ng\n\n_\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nelo/_O eJ nleJeduJe/\n\n-_\n\no\n\n6U!lOO.LuJJojJed\n\n[3[30[3\n\nZZ\n\noz\n\n>\ne\n\nODO0\n\nE9\n\nE!.\n\no\n\n[]\n\nODO0\n\n\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\n\n9!.\n\nuo!sue.L peeJq.L elpeeN\n\n[]\n\n0\n\n\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\n\n9!.\n\nuo!sue.L peeJq.L u!qqo8\n\n[]\n\nOI-IO0\n\n\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3\n\n9!.\n\n_6\n\npeeds\n\nqol!lS\n\n[]\n\nJeeAA elpeeN\n\nDD\n\neoJO-I Ioo-IeJnsseJd\no\n\nI-IO\n\n0\n\n.-\n\nX\n\nduJoo uJJOJeJdl\'uJJO-I LIO:I!:IS\nuo!leuJJO-I lell!-I\n\neoueIJoduJ I JeuJolsn 0\n\n[]\n\n00\n\nI \xe2\x80\xa2 0 0 [] [] []\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 _!_\n\n._o__\n\n"0\ne"\n\nO_OOso_#\n\n=_\no\n\n_\n\nII\nLO\n\nCO\n\n0\n\n_\'_\n\n_"\n\n._ -_\n\n001]\n\n__\n\n_\n....\n\n_8\n\n_\n\ng\n\n_\no\n\n52\n\n.-\n\nN\n\n_\n\nThe baseline requirement, outlined in DMS 2439 - "B" Stage Bulk Resin for the Resin Film Infusion\n(RFI) Process, states that "the resin shall have a minimum viscosity of 10 poise or less and a maximum\nviscosity of 30 poise for 120 minutes during the RFI processing cycle. Previous work in monitoring resin\nflow through preforms using dielectric sensors has shown, however, that only a 90-minute process\nwindow is requh-ed for this resin system. Because the same resin and preform types were used in the\npresent study as were used in generating these previous results, the 90-minute limit was used.\nThe temperature cycle investigation was divided into two studies. The first study, the Resin Viscosity\nStudy, evaluated the effect of thermal history, due to resin degassing and filming, and RFI processing\ntemperatme-rise\nrate on the viscosity characteristics\nof 3501-6 RC resin using rheology testing. The\nviscosity data from this study were used to establish a degassing procedure and minimum allowable\ntemperatme-rise\nrate for successful RFI processing.\nThe second phase of the temperature cycle\ninvestigation verified the minimum allowable temperature-rise\nrate during the RFI manufacturing\nprocess. Temperature cycle requirements for successful semi-span wing cover panel processing were\nestablished.\nBoth rheological tests as well as part manufacturing\ntests were used in the second phase.\nPreliminary resin rheology/temperature-rise\nrate studies of the 3501-6 RC epoxy resin system show that\nthis resin system when heated at 2\xc2\xb0F/min satisfies resin viscosity requirements\nas given in DMS 2439.\nHowever, due to the addition of a resin-degassing\nrequirement to the RFI process to improve surface\nquality, further study was needed.\nAlthough higher temperature-rise\nrates may be desired to reduce autoclave processing time, faster\ntemperatme-rise\nrates, while lowering the minimum viscosity, may unacceptably\ndecrease the processing\nwindow. This can be seen in the RDS dynamic ramp viscosity profiles of 3501-6 RC resin degassed and\nfilmed at 180\xc2\xb0F for 60 minutes and tested at temperatme-rise\nrates of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\xc2\xb0F/rain.\nThese test\nresults show that the minimum viscosity decreases from 6.12 to 5.68 to 4.01 poise while the processing\nwindow decreases from 135 to 115 to 105 minutes. All of these values still satisfy RFI processing\nminimum viscosity and process window requirements, however.\nBecause resin flows faster at lower viscosities resulting in reduced processing times, maximum\ntemperatme-rise\nrates are desired for RFI processing.\nThis maximum temperatme-rise\nrate is limited,\nthough, based on a required processing window greater than or equal to 90 minutes. Based on the 3501-6\nRC resin viscosity profiles, the maximum allowable temperature-rise\nrate for RFI processing cannot yet\nbe determined because the fastest temperatme-rise\nrate tested to date, 4.0\xc2\xb0F/rain., with a process window\nof 100 minutes, still satisfies the RFI process window requh-ement. Until additional rheology tests are\nperformed at greater temperature-rise\nrates, 4.0\xc2\xb0F/rain. should be used as the upper temperature-rise\nrate\nbound for RFI processing.\nAlso, the slowest temperature-rise\nrate that satisfies RFI processing resin\nviscosity and processing window requirements for 3501-6 RC was found to be 0.5\xc2\xb0F/rain.\nResin rheological studies provided a good basis for establishing RFI temperature cycle processing\nparameters.\nThese studies were useful in establishing guidelines for processing the semi-span cover\npanels.\n5.3\n\nEffects\n\nof Processing\n\nPressure\n\nThe objectives of this study were to determine how processing pressure and resin bleed interact in the RFI\nprocess. In order to determine the interactive relationships between pressure and resin bleed, preform\ncompaction and resin-bleed RFI processing characteristics\nwere simultaneously\nevaluated. The pressure\ncycle and resin bleed studies were established to determine the preform compaction characteristics\nand\nwhether processing/compaction\npressure alone could be used as the controlling process parameter instead\nof the amount of bleeder cloth allocated to control resin bleed and final resin content.\n53\n\nEarlier\nworkin thisprogram\nidentified\ntheneed\nforahigher-flow\nresin.In thatstudy,it wasdetermined\nthattheoriginalepoxyresinuse_Hexcel 3501-6 didnothaveasufficiently\nlarge\nprocess indowor a\nw\nlowenough\nviscosity infuse\nto\nthickstiffened\nstructuresuchasthewingcoverpanels\ns\nmade this\nfor\nphase theprogram.Asa consequencethis,a series experiments\nof\nof\nof\nwasconducted,\nattheendof\nwhichareduced-catalyst\nversion 3501-6\nof\nepoxy\nresinwasselected\ntoprovidetheneededrocessing\np\nparameters\nwithoutsacrificing\nmechanical\nperformance. workdescribedelowwasdone\nAll\nb\nwiththis\nreduced-catalyst\nresin.\nThepressureycle/resin leed\nc\nb\ninvestigation ascompleted twophases. thefirstphase the\nw\nin\nIn\nof\ninvestigationry preforms ereevaluated. hese\nd\nw\nT\nresults\nwerethenutilizedduringthesecondhase\np\nusingsaturated\npreforms\ntodetermineressureycleandresinbleedparameters\np\nc\nforhigh-quality\nRFI\nprocessing.\nResultsromthisstudywereused\nf\ntoestablishressurendresinbleed\np\na\nrequirements the\nfor\nfabrication semi-span\nof\nwingupper\nandlowercover anels.\np\nThecompactionharacteristicsdrypreforms\nc\nof\nvarywiththenumber f stacks warpknit carbon\no\nof\nfabric,\nwhetherhepreform heat-set not,thelevelof heat-set\nt\nis\nor\npressure,\nandwhetherhepanelis flator\nt\nstiffened.Results aveshown\nh\nthatthickerdry preforms ompact\nc\ntohigherfibervolume\nfractions\nthan\nthinner reforms\np\natthesame\ncompactionressure.\np\nThisis believed\ntooccurbecause\nfibersnest ore\nm\neasily thickthanin thinpreforms. hedifference preformcompactability,\nin\nT\nin\nhowever,\ndecreases\nwith\nincreasingompactionressure.\nc\np\nHeat-settingpreform,egardless thickness,\na\nr\nof\nincreases\nits\ncompactability\nandhigherheat-set\npressures\nhavehigher ompactibilities\nc\nthanlowerpressures.\nAfter\nheat-setting\napreform, hepreformdoes\nt\nnotreturntoitsoriginaluncompacted\nthickness. henthe\nW\npreform compactedgain,hefibersarebelieved\nis\na\nt\ntonestbetter\nandthusthepreform\nrequhes\nless\npressure\ntoachieve\nthesame\nfibervolume\nfraction.Thedifferences fibervolume\nin\nfractionof heat-set\nandnon-heat-set\npanels,\ncompactedtthesame\na\npressure,\ndecrease\nwithincreasingressure.\np\nRegardless panelthickness,\nof\nsaturated\npreforms\nachieve\nsimilarfibervolume\nfractions within\n0.3percentage\npoints foranygivencompactionressure.\np\nThismeanshatif pressurelonewere\nt\na\nallowed\ntocontrol artthicknessndfinalresincontent yusingexcess leed\np\na\nb\nb\ncloth,anRFIprocessing\npressuref 40psiwouldberequired\no\ntofabricate\navariable\nthicknessartwithinthepartthickness\np\ntolerance\nrequirements 0.055 0.015" per stack.\nof\n+\nHowever, pressure alone cannot be used to control final resin content because fabricating a panel in this\nmanner leads to poor part quality in the form of dry fibers and visible surface porosity\nthe former listed\nas one of the most critical parameters in Table 6. Additionally, such panels have void contents greater\nthan 2.5%, which is above the RFI processing criterion of less than 2%, which can adversely affect\ncompression properties.\nThese manufacturing\ndefects do not occur when final resin content or resin bleed\nis controlled through the allocation of bleeder cloth. For this reason, bleeder cloth allocation using a fixed\npressure is the recommended\nmethod for controlling final resin content and resin bleed during RFI\nprocessing.\nTo be able to control resin content through bleeder cloth allocation, the processing pressure needs to be\nhigh enough to force the desired amount of resin through the preform and into the bleeder material prior\nto resin gel, and low enough to prevent over-compaction.\nResin gel prior to complete infiltration leads to\nresin-rich and resin-starved\nareas and out-of-tolerance\nskin thicknesses.\nResin-rich OML surfaces can\nalso occur when a preform\n\nis over-compacted\n\nby excessive\n\nautoclave\n\npressure.\n\nCompaction pressure studies indicate that performs will relax as much as 4 percentage points of fiber\nvolume fraction after pressure is removed.

However, the higher the pressure, the more the preform is compacted and the greater the\nrisk of resin-rich OML surfaces unless resin allocation is properly adjusted.\n5.4\n\nResin\n\nAllocation\n\nBecause full and uniform infiltration of the preform has been identified as being among the most critical\nfactors for success in producing high-quality parts in the S/RFI process (shown schematically\nin\nFigure 35) a set of experiments was designed to characterize the resin and its flow behavior for use in the\nRFI process. These experiments included rheometry to measure the process window and useful outlife of\nthe resin as well as subscale part manufacture to quantify different means of resin allocation and resin\nflow. Another goal was to improve the thickness uniformity of cured S/RFI parts. Proper allocation and\nbleed of the resin play a major role.\nS84129\n\nIML (Inner\n\nMold\n\n4\n\nTOOLING\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n%\n\nIOML(Outer\n\nLine)\n\nBLOCKS\n\npRFmRM\n"%\n\nI\n/\n\nMold Line) TOOL\n\nI\nDIRECTION\n\nFigure 35.

The preforms were stitched at 40 penetrations per square inch. The epoxy\nresin used to infuse each preform was 3501-6 RC (Reduced Catalyst) manufactured\nby Hexcel. The resin\nis degassed prior to use in the RFI process to reduce the potential for void formation in the processed part.\nBleeder packs used to absorb excess resin after it had infiltrated the preform and passed through vent\nholes in the IML tooling blocks were made from fiberglass cloth. Typically, these bleeder packs were\nlocated above stringer blades and intercostal rib clips. A fluorescent dye powder from Ciba Specialty\nChemicals was used as tracer material to track resin flow by placing plugs of it into resin tiles prior to RFI\nprocessing.\nThe RFI cme cycle used for all the experiments was 2\xc2\xb0F/rain ramp to 250\xc2\xb0F followed by a hold at this\ntemperatme for 60 minutes, a second ramp at 2\xc2\xb0F/rain to 350\xc2\xb0F followed by a hold for 120 minutes at this\ntemperature before cool-down.\nFull vacuum plus 85 psi pressure were applied until the end of the 250\xc2\xb0F\nhold, at which time the vacuum was vented and the pressure increased to 100 psi.

The purpose of these tests was to establish the\nuseful outlife of this resin system by considering several of the heat conditions that represent the\ndegassing and tiling process.\nSummary\n\nof Processing\n\nStudies\n\nIn the process development work presented above, it was determined that the 3501-6 RC resin has\nsufficient outlife to accommodate production process flows of composite wing structures for large\ntransport aircraft.\nA series of scale-up panels made to simulate sections of the semi-span lower cover panel provided useful\ninformation as to resin flow and resin allocation. These experiments also demonstrated\nthat simplified\nflat geometries may be used to simulate more complicated stiffened and curved structures in developing\nproper processing parameters.\nResin allocation experiments showed that, because of the limited in-plane flow, significant customization\nis required in resin allocation. Many regions must thus be overallocated\nto prevent regions from being\nincompletely infused.\n5.5\n\nVARTM\n\nProcess\n\nStudies\n\nThe VARTM (vacuum assisted resin transfer molding) process was studied in this contract to further\nextend the possibilities of reducing up front tooling and capital costs associated with conventional\nautoclave processed composite systems.\n\n56\n\nTheVARTMprocess a composite\nis\nfabrication\nprocess y whichadryfiberpreform vacuum-bagged\nb\nis\nagainst single-sided\na\ntoolandis infused\nwithresinthatis drawn acontrolled\nin\nmannerntothe\ni\nevacuated\npreform.Vacuum\npressurelone usedtocompact\na\nis\nthepreform\nandatleastaninitial cure\noccurs thevacuum\nin\nbag(full curemayoccurin thebagor usinga freestanding\npost-cure ependingn\nd\no\ntheresinformulation). swith anyliquid-molding rocess,\nA\np\ncontrolof theresinflow frontis necessary\nto\nassure\nthatthepreformis completely nduniformlyinfused\na\nwithresin.\nA one-sided\n(typicallyoutermoldline)\ntoolis used\ntosupporthepreform\nt\nduringinfusionandcurewith\nthepreform\naccurately\nlocated\nonthetool,thenbagged ith eitherareusabler nylonbag.A resin\nw\no\ndistribution\nmedium usedtoassist\nis\ntheflow of theresinoverthepreform\nsurface. hemedium\nT\nhelpsto\ncontrolanddirecttheresinflow.

Typically a complex part is broken down into\nmultiple pieces of simple design that are subsequently\nassembled into a larger complex structure. The\ncost to manufacture\nstructures in this manner is significantly higher than molding a single part. The\napplication of Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) has also grown over the past ten\nyears to include the fabrication of large composite structures for the marine industry as well as secondary\nstructure for military aircraft (engine inlet ducts). Recently, advances have been made under the\nComposite Wing Program in the development\nof a new process called VARTM-PB (VARTM with\npressure bleed). VARTM-PB combines traditional VARTM with an autoclave cure to achieve the high\nfiber volume fractions requh-ed of aircraft primary composite structure, a requirement VARTM by itself\nhas failed to meet.\nCurrently there are only two liquid-molding\nmethods that have proven applicable to the fabrication of\nhigh performance large composite structures such as ah-craft wings: RFI and VARTM.\nRFI involves the\nuse of a resin film placed directly in contact with the dry fiber preform and mold tool. The tool/part\nassembly is vacuum bagged and, under temperature and pressure inside an autoclave, the film of resin\ninfuses through the thickness of the preform. This process requh-es the displacement\nof the mold tool and,\nin some cases, the fiber preform itself. As a result of this displacement,\ntool sealing has proven difficult\nwhen large thick films of resin are employed.\nThis results in a certain degree of risk associated with\ncomplete impregnation of the preform. VARTM, on the other hand, offers the potential for a more robust\nprocess for impregnation\nof the dry fiber preform. In VARTM a liquid resin is infused into the preform\nby pulling a vacuum on the mold tool. The resin is introduced to the preform with inlet tubes and a\nmanifold system located on the outer surface of the preform. In this process, the mold tool requires only\nslight movement to compensate for bulk reduction in the preform as force is applied through vacuum.\nTool sealing is extremely simple compared to current RFI methods. However since VARTM only uses\n\n57\n\n$84242\n\nR\n\ne sin\n\nVa c uum Pu m p\nFigure 36. Schematic\n\nof a typical VARTM\n\nprocess.\n\nvacuum pressure (out of the autoclave process) to infuse the preform, resulting fiber volume factions me\ntoo low (54% or less) for the performance levels typically required on aircraft heavy gauge primmy\nstructures.\nFiber preforms with thick cross sections typical of transport aircraft primmy structure require\nsignificant pressures during processing to remove bulk and raise fiber volume fractions to acceptable\nlevels (57% - 60%).\nVARTM offers a robust process for resin infusion of thick dry fiber preforms. However, because\ntraditional VARTM uses vacuum pressure only, it cannot produce high fiber volume fractions on thick\npreforms unless debulking of the preform is performed prior to VARTM processing.\nBy contrast,\nVARTM-PB is a robust resin infusion process capable of producing lmge fiber-reinforced\ncomposite\nstructures with high (57%+) fiber volume fractions. In addition, when used with the new mold tool\nsystem developed by Boeing, VARTM-PB is capable of holding critical dimensional features within\nnarrow tolerance ranges for lmge complex composite structures (Figure 37).\n5.6\n\nVARTM\n\nUnitized\n\nStructure\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn order to assess the benefits of unitized structure to reduce the costs of aircraft part manufacture,\na\nmanufacturing\nstudy was initiated using the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process.\nThis study describes various candidate manufacturing\napproaches that might be used for a generic\nunitized wing box structure using stitched preform technology combined with the VARTM process. A\nsummmy of the material and configuration\nselection process and a discussion of the tooling and\nprocessing methods necessmy to produce a unitized wing box me presented.\nTrade studies were performed to identify innovative concepts for composite wing structure with the goal\nof achieving additional significant cost savings through the use of low cost manufacturing\nmethods and/or\nunitized structure designs. These concepts were rated against the \'baseline\' S/RFI composite wing\nconfiguration\ndeveloped in the NASA AST Composite Wing Program. This baseline wing is already a\nhighly unitized design with integral stringers, spin caps, and rib-attach clips on the cover panels. It\n58\n\nFigure 37. Wing Cover Panel part processed\n\nusing the VARTM\n\n-PB process\n\nrepresents a substantial part count reduction compared to a conventional metal wing, and approximately\nan 86% reduction in fasteners compared to a metal wing. The goal of this trade study was to identify\nadditional cost savings beyond those aheady achieved in the \'baseline\' configuration.\nUnitized structure concepts were developed by an Integrated Product Development\n(IPD) team and\nevaluated using a standardized\nscoring system. The team consisted of representatives\nfrom major\ndisciplines representing\nDesign, Strength, Materials and Processes, Tooling, Manufacturing,\nand Quality.\nEight evaluation criteria were established for rating the cost, performance\nand risk of each concept, and\nweighting factors were assigned to each team members\' ratings to emphasize cost more than performance\nand risk since cost reduction was the primary objective of these design studies.\nFollowing initial evaluations of 28 different concepts, the top five were identified and moved into a more\ndetailed evaluation phase. In this phase, an enthe wing box was conceptually laid out using these\nconcepts. Individual joint configurations\nwere identified as well as manufacturing\nplans for all parts.\nThis exercise identified potential tooling, strength and assembly problem areas. Projected part count and\ncost savings relative to the baseline wing were also identified during this phase. At the end of these\ndetailed evaluations, the best overall concept was chosen to carry forward for a manufacturing\ndemonstration\n(Figure 38). However, due to funding restrictions, the manufacturing\ndemonstration\narticle\nwas not fabricated.\n\n59\n\n30\n\n25\nRelative\nInstalled\n\n20\n\nFastener\nCost\n15\n\n10\nBaseline\nVARTM\nVARTM (Auto VARTM (Auto\n(Manual\n(Manual\nDrill/Auto\nDrill/Manual\nDrill/Manual Drill/Manual\nInstall Blind Install Hi-Lok)\nInstall Hi-Lok) Install Hi-Lok) Fastener)\n\nMetal\n\nBaseline\n\nBaseline\n\nComposite\nDesign\n\nConcept\n\nFigure\n\n60\n\nt\n\nVARTM\n\n38.\n\nCost\n\nsavings\n\n53%\n\nReduction\nvs Current\nDesign\n\nfrom\n\nreduced\n\nMetal wing fastener count parametrically derived\nfrom actual MD-11 numbers.

Since 1989 under\nNASA contract, Boeing has conducted research in this composite technology with a primary focus on\nbasic material forms, resin film infusion and scale up to various element and subcomponent\npanels. That\nresearch culminated in the design, manufacture and test of a 8 ft. by 12 ft. wing stub box test article.\nTo support this initial eflbrt two stitching machines were purchased by NASA. One multi-needle\nquilting\nmachine and one computer controlled single needle machine were designed and manufactured\nby Pathe\nTechnologies\nInc. in hvington, NJ under the direction of Boeing. The multi-needle machine was utilized\nfor the assembly of the basic skin stack material as well as heavy density stitching of wing skins for\nelement and subcomponent\npanels. The single needle sewing machine was designed with computer\ncontrolled, X-Y motion, and consisted of a gantry type configuration\ncontaining one single needle\nstitching head capable of sewing up to 1.00 in. in thickness. The primary purpose of this machine was to\ncreate detailed stitch patterns and to attach the prefabricated\nstringer and intercostal clip details to the\npreviously stitched wing skins.\nIn 1992, phase "B" of the Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) program, the task of procuring an\nadvanced sewing machine capable of stitching 3-dimensional\nlofted wing cover panels for transport\naircraft began. This effort included the development\nof a machine specification\nas well as the solicitation\nfor proposals from potential suppliers. Based upon lessons learned from operating existing machines at\nPathe, it was determined that the experience of the machine tool industry would need to be brought\ntogether with the sewing technology developed by Pathe. Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. and Pathe\nTechnologies\nInc. were selected as the contractors to work with Boeing and NASA in the design,\nfabrication and development of the ASM. The primary objective of this project was to deliver a machine\ncapable of stitching complex contour wing cover panels for a 42-ft. semi-span wing [Reference 4].\nThe requirements\ndriving the application of stitching in transport aircraft composite wing skins is damage\ntolerance and cost reductions.\nBoeing has proven through mechanical property testing that the cost to\nmanufacture is significantly reduced while the retained strength of damaged composite structure is\nsignificantly increased with through the thickness stitching of the structure. In an effort to meet these\nrequirements and to keep manufacturing\ncosts down, Boeing has incorporated\nthe use of stitched cmbon\nfiber preforms in its wing cover panel design.\nThe ability of the stitched structure to retain a given level of strength is directly related to the stitch\ndensity, stitch formation, and the tensile strength of the thread itself. These three factors determine the\neffect stitching has on preventing the propagation of delamination for a given amount of impact energy\ninflicted on the structure. Current design stress levels for the semi-span wing dictate a stitching density of\n40 penetrations per square inch using a Kevlar 29, 1600d thread. The formation of the stitch must be such\nthat the penetrating thread passes completely through the thickness of the material with the lock between\nitself and bobbin thread lying on the lower surface of the part.\nIn addition to providing damage tolerance to the structure, the application of stitching also\neffective manufacturing\napproach to the fabrication of the cover panel.

The variable thickness skin ranges from 5 to 11 stacks\nbut has localized buildups at the root and main landing gem stations. A maximum of 17 stacks or 0.940-in.\ncured thickness is represented in this part. Along the leading and trailing edges of the panel are the front and\nrear spar caps. The spar caps are interleaved with the base skin stacks for efficient shear load transfer from\nspars to skin. The vertical blade of the spar cap is 0.440-in. thick and 3.40-in. tall. Ten (10) stringers ranging\nfrom 0.470-in. to 0.800-in. thick and up to 3.40-in. tall are located on top of the wing skin inner mold line\nsurface. In between the stringers orientated in a cordwise direction are 16 rows of intercostal clips, which\ndefine rib planes for wing assembly. Intercostal clips range from 0.220 in. thick for lightly loaded ribs to\n0.440-in. thick for fuel pressure and main landing gem bulkheads. Height of intercostal clips coincides with\nthe height of interfacing stringer blades. All stringer and intercostal clip details are stitched to the wing skin.\nThe wing cover panel skin, spar cap and intercostal clip details are all constructed of multi-axial wrap/knit\ncarbon fiber fabric. This material consists of 7 layers of carbon fiber knitted together with a 72 denier\npolyester thread using warp/knitting machinery from the textile industry.\nPreform\n\nAssembly\n\nAssembly of the wing cover panel preform began with the lay up of the wing skin on the tooling bed of\nthe ASM. Located on top of the ASM bed were 50 loft support modules. The series of modules were\npinned and bolted to the lift tables to create the outer loft surface of the lower cover panel. Positioned\naround the perimeter of the loft modules was the aluminum-stitching\nframe. The frame was supported off\nof each module by steel angles, which contained large tapered pins for indexing the stitching frame to the\nloft modules. The precut wing skin stacks were positioned by hand inside the stitching frame on the loft\nsurface of the modules, utilizing a ceiling mounted laser projection system (LPS). Technicians precisely\nlocated each piece of material by lining up the edges of the fabric with the laser projection outline.

Semi-Span\n\nwing cover panel design.\n\nthe base (plies of material covering entire loft surface) lay-up was complete, the front and rear spar caps\nwere positioned and secured in place using jig tooling (Figure 42). The remaining skin stacks were then\nplaced on top of the base skin stacks between the front and rear spat cap details. The leading and trailing\nedges of the skin stacks were butt spliced with the inner spat cap flange stacks in a stepped sequence to\ncreate an interleaved spat cap flange and skin. Lay-up of the wing skin was completed with the\nplacement of build up stacks at the root end of the panel.\nA total of 25 NC programs were executed in stitching the wing skin/spat cap assembly. Stitching consists\nof parallel rows spaced at 0.200-in. apart with a stitch pitch of 8 stitches per inch. Those areas of the skin\nthat fell under a stringer flange were left unstitched for subsequent attachment stitching of the stringers to\nthe wing skin. This process eliminated double stitching of the skin. The leading and trailing edges of the\npanel were stitched last to complete the assembly of the skin stacks and spat cap details (Figure 43).\nStringer details were first located over the skin assembly by hand. Outline templates projected from the\nLPS were used to define critical stringer positions and establish proper location of the stringer in the\nspanwise direction. A jig was used to hold the root end of each stringer detail during attachment stitching\nof the stringer flange to the wing skin to prevent movement of the stringer longitudinally.\nA locating\ndevice was mounted to the stitching head to locate the stringer details during the stitching process\n(Figure 44). Once both flanges of the stringer had received a single row of stitching, the tooling devices\nwere removed and the remaining stitch rows were inserted into the stringer flanges.\n\n65\n\n$83876\n\nFigure 42.

Stitching\n\nof stringer\n\nto skin.\n\nThe intercostal clip details were placed onto the preform assembly at each rib station. Aluminum locator\njig tooling was used to position the intercostal clips in their respective rib planes. The inboard flange of\neach clip received a single stitch row to hold location. The locator jig was then removed and the\nremaining stitch rows were inserted into the inboard and outboard flanges of the clip (Figure 45). Once\ncomplete (Figure 46), the preform was transferred from the stitching machine to the cure tool. The\ncompleted preform then sits on top of the resin tiled OML tool. IML tooling blocks are then added on top\nof the preform and coordinated to the OML tool by a series of metal bars that define the shear web plane.\nOnce locked in place, bleeder packs and sealing material are used along with a reusable rubber vacuum\nbag to seal the cover panel completely.\nThe preform and tooling are then wheeled into the autoclave for\ncuring.\nPost Cure Analysis\n\nof Lower\n\nCover Panel\n\nUpon completion of the cure cycle, a detailed post cure analysis was conducted on the cured cover panel\n(Figure 47). The predicted vs. actual results are given in Table 9. The results show that a cured resin\ncontent of 31.4% by weight was achieved. Resin bleed analysis showed that the actual resin bleed was\nwithin 2.25% of predicted value.

The results indicate that large\ncomplex structures can be processed to tight engineering tolerances using the S/RFI process. Large\nintegrally stiffened carbon fiber performs with complex contoured loft surfaces can be fabricated using\nfull width multi-axial fabrics and stitching technology derived from the textile industry. Subsequent\nimpregnation of these enormous performs with epoxy resin was demonstrated\nwith the film infusion\nprocess.\n69\n\nWing Box Assembly\nTraditional metallic wings are assembled in a picture frame fashion. Spat web assemblies and the main\nlanding gear (MLG) fitting are located in the assembly jig first followed by machined bulkheads and\nremaining ribs. Rib installation completes the framing process of the wing box. The wing skins are then\nlocated to the substructure for fastener hole processing and final installation.\nThe AST Composite Wing\nassembly process differs significantly from metallic wing assembly. The cover panels, for example,\ncombine traditional wing skins, stringers, intercostal clips, and rib locating features into one co-cured\ndetail, see Figure 48. This greatly reduces the number of required parts and fasteners. Approximately 80\ndetails make up the 42-ft. AST Composite Wing Box, excluding load introduction structure/hatdware.\nFinal assembly of the composite wing begins with the cover panels. Both cover panels are located to the\ncontour boards, rear spat plane, and MLG bulkhead plane on the assembly fixture. The ribs are then\nlocated to the cover panel intercostal clips. The last details to be installed are the forward and aft spat webs.\nAssembly\n\nProcess\n\nA key objective in defining the assembly process was to provide as much\npossible, particularly when processing thousands of rib web-to-intercostal\nassembly sequences for the semi-span wing box is as follows: The upper\npositioned to the contour boards and indexed to three locating features of\nrear spat plane and one at the rib 6 plane, Figure 49.\n\naccess to the work area as\nfastener holes.

Cover panel locating\n\nfeatures.\n\nRib webs are located on the cover panel intercostals insuring adequate fastener edge distance. Temporary\nattachments are used to secure the ribs to the upper and lower covers. The lower cover temporary\nattachments are then removed and the jig is opened with the ribs attached to the upper cover. The rib web\nto upper cover panel attachment holes are then processed to full size in this opened condition.\nAfter the\njig is closed, the ribs are again temporarily attached to the lower cover. The upper cover temporary\nattachments are then removed and the jig is opened. Fastener holes in the lower cover are then processed\nto full size and the permanent fasteners installed, Figure 50.\nWhen the jig is again closed, permanent fasteners are used to attach the upper cover to the ribs. After the\nribs are permanently installed, all rib web to spar web t-clips are installed, Figure 51. The root splice\ntransition structure fittings are located, drilled, and installed next, Figures 52 and 53. The outboard and\ninboard rear spar web sections are then located and installed, Figure 54. After the MLG fitting has been\ncraned into position on the assembly fixture, the skin doublers are placed into position and used to attach\nthe MLG fitting to the upper and lower covers of the wing box. The MLG-to-spar web attach angles are\nthen installed, Figure 55. Final close-out of the outboard wing box occurs with installation of the\noutboard and then inboard front spar web sections. The remaining load introduction structures are then\ninstalled including the root splice spar extensions, side-of-body bulkhead (Figure 56), rib 6 front spar\nfitting, forward and aft pylon mounts, rib 13 saddle (Figure 57), and rib 18 close-out structure.\n\n71\n\n$84286\n\nFigure\n\n50.\n\nLower\n\ncover\n\npanel\n\nfastener\n\nhole processing.\n\n$84287\n\nFigure\n\n72\n\n51.\n\nRib web\n\nto spar web\n\nclip installation.\n\n$84288\n\nFigure\n\n52.\n\nUpper\n\ncover\n\nTransition\n\nSplice\n\nFitting\n\n(TSF)\n\ninstallation.\n$84289\n\nFigure\n\n53.\n\nLower\n\ncover\n\nTransition\n\nSplice\n\nFitting\n\n(TSF)\n\ninstallation.\n\n73\n\n$84290\n\nFigure\n\n54.\n\nRear\n\nspar\n\ninstallation.\n$84291\n\nFigure\n\n74\n\n55.\n\nMain\n\nlanding\n\ngear fitting\n\ninstallation.\n\n$84292\n\nFigure\n\n56.\n\nSide-of-body\n\nbulkhead.\n$84293\n\nFigure\n\n57.\n\nRib\n\n13 saddle\n\ninstallation.\n\n75\n\nCost Studies\n\nand Analyses\n\nThe primary objective of the cost study activity was to validate the cost effectiveness of the stitched/resin\nfilm infusion (S/RFI) manufacturing\nprocess. This was to be achieved by collecting labor data throughout\nthe fabrication of ten semi-span lower cover panels. Additionally,\nthe data collection and analysis fiom\nfabrication and assembly of the S/RFI semi-span wing box test article has been incorporated into this\nsection. The semi-span wing box consists of an upper and lower cover panel and the substructure\n(primarily the spars and ribs). This data is the basis for cost projections and comparisons\nto the program\ncost goal of 20% below the cost of a comparable present day aluminum wing box structure. An\naluminum wing box cost baseline and the S/RFI cost goal were developed fiom a large parametric cost\nmodel drawing upon over 300 cost estimating relationships.\nThe S/RFI wing box cost analysis incorporates actual labor data collected during the manufacture of eight\nlower cover panels along with projections for the manufacture of wing box substructure and projections\nfor assembly of the components into a wing box structure (based on historical industry data and cost\nestimating relationships).\nResults of this analysis are summarized in Table 10.\nThe actual labor data collected during the "one-time" manufacture of the substructure and assembly of the\nsemi-span wing box test article is not sufficient to predict with any certainty the real world production\nimplications.\nAdditionally,\nthe observation of the assembly of the transition structure fittings and other\ndevelopment\ntasks for test purposes rather than the actual assembly of the landing gem and pylon fittings\nand the absence of other production operations such as sealing and shimming for fuel pressure integrity is\nquestionable in terms of a direct comparison.\nIt does, however, provide a gage or starting point for\nrealizing the potential impact of S/RFI technology to the manufacture of military and commercial aircraft\ncomponents.\nThe labor data and weight have been analyzed and adjusted by a "sizing" factor to develop\nMD-XX configuration\nlabor and weight projections.\nPerformance ratings, and personal, fatigue, and\ndelay allowances have been applied to develop the projected "actual production" labor hours. Although\nsubstructure labor is higher than anticipated, assembly labor is significantly lower than projected by\nparametric and historical extrapolations.\nThis is in part due to the considerations\ndiscussed earlier in this\nsection.\nA final look at the S/RFI wing box cost analysis incorporates actual material cost which is based on the\n"development"\nquantities and pricing used during this contract which is approximately\ndouble the\nexpected cost of higher quantities of material in a production environment.\nThe potential impact to the\nstructural wing box cost, based on the single data point for substructure and assembly and actual material\ncosts, is shown in Table 10. The demonstrated\nlearning curve for cover panel manufacturing\nis also\nincorporated into this analysis.\nIn this analysis, the increased cost of manufacturing\nS/RFI cover panels compared to\na direct result of the actual "development"\nquantity material cost being at least double\nof higher production quantities of material. The substructure comparison is based on\nwhich was extrapolated\nfrom financial records rather than observed and documented.\nanalysis are necessary to further substantiate the findings.\n\naluminum panels is\nthe expected cost\none data point\nAdditional data and\n\nThe assembly comparison is also based on the analysis of the one time assembly of the wing box. The\nsignificant improvement in labor hours compared to assembly of an aluminum wing box is due primarily\nto the S/RFI integrated structure concept which eliminates many traditional assembly tasks. Also, the\nparametric (weight-based)\nprojections of the aluminum wing assembly, as well as the S/RFI assembly\nprojections, are being compared to actual labor horns accounting for the significant reduction in hours.\n\n76\n\nTable 10.

The\nNASA-requested\nmodifications\nto the transition structure that ties the structme to the test wall to react the\ntest loads were also provided.\nThis task also identified, checked, refurbished, and shipped the required\nBoeing load jacks, end fittings, and pins needed to introduce the loads through the test hardware into the\nbox.\nThe load introduction hardware developed under this task included attachment fittings at the front and\nrear spat at the main landing gear bulkhead, the Rib 13 "picture frame," and Rib 18 closeout bulkhead\n(Figure 58). Load jacks are also attached at the pylon mounts. Front and rear spar web shear connections\nwere requested after the critical design review to reduce the risk of a connection failure.\n7.2\n\nStructural\n\nLoading\n\nHardware\n\nThe objective of semi-span wing box is to demonstrate that a carbon epoxy wing box using the S/RFI\nprocess for the spat webs and skin covers can be fabricated to aircraft quality standards.\nAlong with\nbuilding the box, it must also be demonstrated that this wing box and its detail features are capable of\nmeeting structural design requirements.\nThis is done by subjecting the wing box to loads that are\nrepresentative\nof flight and ground loads. Therefore, only representative\nloads, shears, moments, and\ntorques that influence the design of the wing are introduced by load jacks in a minimal number of\nlocations to closely approximate the loads this wing box would experience if it were being tested to FAR\n25 requirements.\nThe load introduction hardware transfers the load from the jacks and applies it to the\nwing test box.\n\nTest Wall\n\nFigure\n\n78\n\n58. Test hardware\n\nsetup.\n\nThe loads at Positions 1 and 2 are applied to the box through Rib 18. The rib is a 3/4-inch-thick\naluminum plate (7075-T651) mechanically\nattached to the upper and lower covers by machined\naluminum fittings acting as shear clips attached to the OML of each skin. It is also mechanically attached\nthrough the front and rear spar webs (double shear) by internal and external aluminum angle fittings. The\ncritical load conditions for this hardware, the 2.5-upbending\nand -1.0-downbending,\nare introduced into\nthe plate by angles pinned to monoball fittings, which allow rotation of the jack connection.\nBecause of\nthe introduction of large concentrated loads at the end of the box, the internal loads in the outboard rib\nbay of the box are not representative\nof those experienced in typical wing box structure.\nThe loads at Positions 3 and 4 are introduced into the semi-span box by using a picture frame fixture to\napply loads through pads into the upper and lower covers of the box at the intersection of Rib 13 with the\nfront and rear spars. This low-cost arrangement is thought to minimize the influence of attaching\nstructure on the behavior of the box, thus limiting the area of nonrepresentative\ninternal loads. The\nwelded and mechanically\nassembled frame that wraps around the box consists of an upper and lower\nbeam mechanically\nattached to vertical braces at each spat. Two pads are welded onto each beam and\nbonded to the upper and lower skins at the spars. The lower beam also has pads welded on to attach\nclevis-type actuator fittings where loads are introduced by the jacks.\nLoad Points 5and 6 take advantage of the existing fittings designed to represent the engine pylon\nattachment.\nAttachment Points 7b and 8 are at the MLG bulkhead and rear and front spat intersections,\nrespectively.\nBecause of the internal fittings at the MLG bulkhead, which are needed to handle the high\nshear loads from the simulated braked roll test condition, a machined fitting forward of the front spat web\nand a welded fitting at the rear spar are used to introduce the loads into the box. The welded fitting, made\nfrom ASTM A36 steel, is fastened through the lower MLG doubler and connects to a monoball fitting\nattached to a load jack. The front spar fitting is machined from 7075-T651 plate. An adapter fitting,\nbolted through the skin to the spat and to an internal bulkhead fitting, matches the lower cover contour\nand is used to attach the angles used to secure a monoball fitting with a pin. Like all previously\nmentioned load points, the critical loading conditions used to design the attaching hardware are the\n2.5-upbending\nand - 1.0-downbending\nload cases.\nLoad Point 7a hardware is designed for the braked-roll load case. The design of the attachment hardware\nwas based upon a design used for an internally funded Boeing MLG joint test. A large steel arm made\nfrom ASTM A36 steel is used to introduce loads from the actuator into a representative\nMLG fitting\nattached to the wing box by two 6-inch-diameter\nbolts.\nThe purpose of the transition structure is to react the loads introduced into the box by the load jacks. The\nstructure connects the root portion of the box with a stationary wall. The region of the box connecting to\nthe transition structure is not representative\nof a wing design. Modifications\nwere made after the Critical\nDesign Review to add the front and rear spat web extensions.\nThese are made from 7075-T651\naluminum plate and are 3/8-inch-thick.\nThe web extensions are tied to the wall and transition structure\nusing aluminum angle shear ties.\nThe appropriate Boeing load actuators (jacks) with end fittings and pins where located\nload capacity, stroke length, and rotational movement because of wing box bending.\n7.3\n\nCover\n\nPanel\n\nRepair\n\nusing criteria for\n\nDesign\n\nPrior to ultimate loading, several discrete source damage sites were chosen to apply two, 7-inch saw-cuts.\nAccording to the Semi-Span test plan, two major bolt-on repairs were attached to the upper and lower\ncover panels of the Semi-Span.\nThe repair splices the region which was damaged by the saw-cuts, which\ncut through a stringer and the two adjacent skin bays.

The purpose of these\ngages is to provide a comparison between actual strains verses predicted strains and to validate the\ngeneral load distributions and the level of stress concentrations.\nThe general load distributions\nand the\nlevel of stress concentrations\nat structural discontinuities\nare determined by relating the strain data near\nthe cut-out to the far field laminate strains. Also, at locations where failure could occur, gages are placed\nwith the intent of possibly indicating load redistribution or imminent failure. The cover gage locations\nand labels are shown in Figure 60 and Figure 61. Sets of gages were placed chordwise across several\nsections of the cover panels so the strain distribution across the panels could be checked. Rosettes are\nplaced on all the cover skins, rib webs and spar webs to check the shear strain in these members.\nGages\nare placed on the root splice plates to check the bending and axial loads in this joint. Gages are placed on\nthe main landing gear splice plates to check the axial loads in this joint. Back-to-back\ngage sets were\nplaced on top of stringers and the skin it is attached to check the axial and bending loads in the stiffened\nsections. Gages were placed next to the impact damage sites and the saw-cuts to provide a possible\nindication of imminent failure. Gages were placed near structural discontinuities\nwhich caused stress\nconcentrations\nsuch as access holes, stringer runouts, the root joints, the main landing gem joints or\nrepairs.\nStrain gage predictions for the Semi-Span were made throughout the wing box. The strain gage\npredictions were determined from finite element analyses which model the regions where the gages are\npositioned on the test article. The global model as shown in Figure 62 was used for the gages away from\nstructural discontinuities.\nHowever, special local models such as the one for the upper cover runout\nshown in Figure 63 were made for gages near these features where strain would be affected by the\ngradient produced by these structural discontinuities.\nThese local models can account for the effect of\nthese discontinuities\non the strain. Also, nonlinear analysis were performed near access doors that had\nlow margins of safety. Linear strain gage predictions were made for all gages except those near the root\nwhich is the only location where significant nonlinemites were expected.\n\n8O\n\ni\n\ns84839\n\n/_+++++ + ,++ + +++++\'1\n+\n.........................................................................................\n\nI..........................................................................................\n\nf ++++\n\n!\n\n++++if\n\n+ + 4- +\ni 4" 4" 4" 4"_\ni\n+++\n/\n\n_\n\n_\ni\ni\ni\n\n/\n\n4- 4- 4- 4- i Composite\n4- 4- 4- 4- i Stringer\ni\n\n_\n_\n\n4-\n\n4-\n\nI_\nSkin\nSplice\n\n4-i\n\nr\n\nPlate\n\n1---t-1....I--_-,--\'-...,..\n. .....I.....\'..... \'-.....\' ....\'-....\'-.... \'---\'-_--t----\'---\'---I.....\n14- 4- 4" \\\ni\n_\ni -I" 4- 4- 44-4"4-4-\n\n_\n\n/\n\n/\n\nJ\n\n_\n\n_++++\n\n4- 4" 4-i\n.\n.\n. i\n4- 4- 4- -I"i\n\nV\n",,\nStringer\nSplice\nII\n\n4- 4- 4- 4- i\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n!\n\nPiate\n\n++++i_\n\nTlice\nP\n\nJI\n\n_-II\n\n_\'++++ + + + + + + +++\xc3\xb7i/_I\n+\n\n..........................................................................................\ni..........................................................................................\n._...........---_-\'\nComposite Skin\nFigure 59.

Testing concluded with the 2.5-g wing up-bending testto-failure June 1, 2000. Final failure occurred in the lower cover panel of the wing box at 97% of the\n2.5-g design ultimate load (DUL) (Figure 64). Failure initiated from lower cover access hole between\nRibs 8 and 9 based on strain gage data. The access hole strain gage readings dropped off at 91.4% DUL.\nThis failure initiation location coincides with the lowest margin of safety location. The failure propagated\nfrom the access hole and through the lower cover into both spars. The cover panels had discrete source\ndamage repairs (one per cover panel) and selected impact damage sties (including one stringer runout site\nper cover panel). Prior to the semi-span ultimate test, NASA had conducted a pre-test analysis on wing\ntip condition displacement during structural loading and prior to reaching failure. The results are shown\n(Figure 65). The exact failure sequence is difficult to determine.\nNASA is performing the post test\nanalysis that may provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding\nof the failure events.\n\n83\n\nFigure\n\n64.

Concluding\n\nRemarks\n\nThe work summarized in this report describes the development or maturation of technologies related to\nS/RFI processing to reduce the risk and improve the quality of parts processed in this manner. The\nDurability and damage tolerance studies and the process modeling work demonstrated that the use of\nsophisticated computer models can, with reasonable accuracy, predict the behavior of S/RFI parts.\nSpecifically, the software code GENOA was shown to give reasonable estimates of damage progression\nand residual structural strength for the structural components tested. Although these tools need fmther\nrefinement, they clearly demonstrate that large cost reductions in design and processing analyses may be\nachieved through the use of these computational tools by reducing the necessity for large structmal tests\nor process trials.\nThrough the design and manufacture of a semi-span wing test article, the goals of this program\nweight reduction and 20% cost reduction over metallic structure were realized.\n\nof 25%\n\nThrough the design and test verification process, credibility has been given to the utilization of heavily\nloaded composite structmes for primary wing structure of commercial aircraft. Fmthermore,\nthe\nstitched/resin film infusion (S/RFI) concept of manufacture has evolved to offer a unique and effective\nsolution for the production of large, heavily loaded wing primary aircraft structure. The manufacturing\nand processing characteristics\nand risk of scale-up using the S/RFI process have been largely mitigated\nthrough the successful manufacture of eight (8) lower cover panels. The quality of each panel saw\nmarked improvement as process refinements were implemented.\nAlso, dming the same time, process\nimprovements,\nwork flow changes, and new concepts for tooling and manufacturing\nwere implemented to\nbring marked and fundamental improvement to the cost data curve development.\nThe evolution of this\nprocess during the manufacture of the eight lower cover panels resulted in cost projections of 19.6%\nbelow the cost of an aluminum wing box essentially achieving the 20% cost reduction goal.\nMaterials and process studies demonstrated\nhow a systematic approach could be successfully used to\nreduce the risk of processing large, integrated composite structures. This systematic approach focused on\nthe basic parameters in S/RFI technology:\nstitching preforms, preform quality, and resin infusion.\nStitching studies concentrated on improving stitching quality by determining the factors that would ensure\nproper thickness and knot formation while simultaneously\nmaintaining or enhancing stitching speed. By\ncreating a visual guide as well as a set of stitching parameters for each machine, stitching machine\noperators were given tools with which they could maintain preform quality, detect problems, and resolve\nthem efficiently.\nProcessing guidelines for resin handling (temperature and pressure) were developed to\nensure that cured parts would meet the desired thickness, and hence resin-content\nlevels. Moreover, these\nparameters served to reduce the risk of producing out-of-specification\nparts. The resin allocation study\nshowed a systematic process for reducing the risk associated with scaling-up the resin film infusion of\nstitched preforms.\nThe result of this study was the requhement\nfor a highly customized resin allocation in\norder to provide both within-specification\npart thicknesses as well as thickness uniformity.\nThe VARTM process studies demonstrated\nthat significant work is still required before this technology\nreaches the maturity level of RFI or RTM for producing aerospace-quality\ncomposite parts. However, it\nwas demonstrated using the VARTM-PB process that many of the lessons learned in S/RFI development\nmay be directly applied to VARTM. Furthermore,\nVARTM-PB showed the benefits of autoclave\npressure to overcome the low fiber volumes associated with vacuum-only\nprocesses for thick structures.\n\n85\n\nTheeffortsdescribed thisreportsummarize aterials ndprocessevelopments reducing\nin\nm\na\nd\nfor\nthecosts\nandrisksassociated themanufacture\nwith\nanddesign structural\nof\ncomponents\nusingtheS/RFIprocess.\nAdoption themethods escribederein\nof\nd\nh\nhasbeen\nsuccessfully\ndemonstrated\ntoimprove\npartquality\nduringthemanufacture coverpanels\nof\nunder\ntheASTComposite ingProgram.\nW\n\n86\n\n9.

This report describes a weight trade study utilizing a wing torque box design applicable to a 220-passenger\ncommercial\naircraft and was used to verify the weight savings a S/RFI structure would offer\ncompared to an identical aluminum wing box design. This trade study was performed in the AST Composite Wing\nprogram, and the overall weight savings are reported. Previous program work involved the design of a S/RFI-baseline wing box structural test component\nand its associated\ntesting hardware. This detail structural design eftort\nwhich is known as the "semi-span"\nin this report, was completed under a previous NASA contract (NAS 1-18862).\nThe full-scale wing design was based on a configuration for a MD-90-40X\nairplane, and the objective of this structural test component was to demonstrate the maturity of the S/RFI technology through the evaluation of a full-scale\nwing box/fuselage\nsection structural test. However, scope reductions\nof the AST Composite Wing Program prevented the fabrication and evaluation of this wing box structure. Results obtained from the weight trade study, the\nfull-scale test component design eftort, fabrication,\ndesign development\ntesting, and full-scale testing of the semispan wing box are reported.\n\n14.\n\nSUBJECT\n\nTERMS\n\nComposite\n\nWing,\n\n15.\n\nStitched\n\nComposites,\n\nResin Film Infusion,\n\nBraiding\n\nNUMBER\n\nOF\n\nPAGES\n\n98\n16.\n\nPRICE\n\nCODE\n\nA05\n17.\n\nSECURITY\nOF\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nREPORT\n\nUnclassified\nNSN\n\n7540-01-280-5500\n\n18.
