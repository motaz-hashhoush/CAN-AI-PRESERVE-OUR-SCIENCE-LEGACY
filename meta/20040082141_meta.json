The ISIM structure is a three dimensional truss with asymmetric gusseting and metal fittings. One of the primary challenges for ISIM's analysis team is predicting the thermal distortion of the structure both from the bulk cooldown from ambient to cryo, and the smaller temperature changes within the cryogenic operating environment. As a first cut to estimate thermal distortions, a finite element model of bar elements was created. Elements representing joint areas and metal fittings use effective properties that match the behavior of the stack-up of the composite tube, gusset and adhesive under mechanical and thermal loads. These properties were derived by matching tip deflections of a solid model simplified T-joint. Because of the structure s asymmetric gusseting, this effective property model is a first attempt at predicting rotations that cannot be captured with a smeared CTE approach. In addition to the finite element analysis, several first order calculations have been performed to gauge the feasibility of the material design. Because of the stringent thermal distortion requirements at cryogenic temperatures, a composite tube material with near zero or negative CTE is required. A preliminary hand analysis of the contribution of the various components along the distortion path between FGS and the other instruments, neglecting second order effects were examined. A plot of bounding tube longitudinal and transverse CTEs for thermal stability requirements was generated to help determine the feasibility of meeting these requirements. This analysis is a work in progress en route to a large degree of freedom hi-fidelity FEA model for distortion analysis. Methods of model reduction, such as superelements, are currently being investigated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040082141, "endDate": "2004-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "NASA/GSFC FEMCI Workshop", "location": "Greenbelt, MD", "id": "512f34bd4b494d769581d75949e9a356", "startDate": "2004-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040082141, "id": "7b73292aad3844bdb4adca2e6be719cf", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040082141.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040082141/downloads/20040082141.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040082141/downloads/20040082141.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040082141/downloads/20040082141.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
