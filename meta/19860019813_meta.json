Those data sets planned for future access through the PCDS were also listed, and their current installation status was stated. The tasks involved in supporting data sets within the PCDS were identified and described. After a data set is approved for implementation into the system and communication with the data producers is established, the information for the detailed catalog entry is gathered. This information then is reviewed with the scientists involved before producing a catalog summary. Once this is done, the catalog information can be provided to users, even before the data set is installed. The next several tasks involve software development and can prove to be the most time-consuming aspect in the data set support. These tasks can be simplified if the data producers provide complete and accurate documentation of their product. Software for reading and interpreting the data sets is developed and the data sets, or portions therefore, that will be made available for use within the PCDS are inventoried. Users can access this information via the INVENTORY Subsystem of the PCDS.", "title": "Data set management", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860019813, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reph, M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "6b28c5728372404f86a696eb14ee9cfa"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860019813, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860019813, "id": "7fd4ed0bc46348999c1fc09501f99842", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Second Pilot Climate Data System Workshop", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860019810, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Second Pilot Climate Data System Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860019813.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860019813/downloads/19860019813.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860019813/downloads/19860019813.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860019813/downloads/19860019813.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
