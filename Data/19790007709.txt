Science rationale includes measurement of the motion\n\n\nof Venus\' pole, ephemeris improvement, cartographic reference points for\n\n\nprecision mapping, and the possibility of measurement of large crustal\n\n\nmotion if it exists.\n\n\nAlso discussed are some interesting offshoot applications including\n\n\nthe use of radar corner reflectors as landing beacons on the planetary\n\n\nsurfaces and some deep space applications that may yield a greatly\n\n\nenhanced knowledge of the gravitational and electromagnetic structure\n\n\nof the solar system.\n\n\nIt is shown that passive retroreflectors with dimensions of about\n\n\n4 meters and weighing about 10 kg are feasible for use with orbiting\n \n\nradar at Venus and Mars. Earth-based observation of passive reflectors,\n\n\nhowever, would require very large and complex structures to be delivered\n\n\nto the surfaces. For Earth-based measurements, it is concluded that\n\n\nsurface transponders offer a distinct advantage in accuracy over passive\n\n\nreflectors. A conceptual design for a high temperature transponder is\n\n\npresented. The design appears feasible for the Venus surface using\n\n\nexisting electronics and power components.\n \n\n\niv\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\n1\t\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \t\n\n2 \t\n\nSCIENCE

evaluate\n\n\nthe feasibility of placing long-life devices on the surfaces of planets\n \n\nto allow accurate tracking from Earth or from planetary orbit., Primary\n\n\nemphasis has been placed on conceptual design of a passive radar retrore\xc2\xad\n\nflector capable of being fixed to the surface of Venus or Mars.\n\nSuch\n\n\n\nreflectors could provide a body-fixed reference system for measurement of\n\n\nrotational motion, for cartography, for improvement of the ephemeris, and\n \n\nfor the detection of tectonic activity.\n\n\nSeveral methods of establishing such devices have been stud\xc2\xad\n\nied.\n\nThey include radar (Venus) and laser corner reflectors, large quan\xc2\xad\n\n\ntities of super-thin needles, very long wires, and high-temperature, -long\xc2\xad\n\nlife transponders.\n\nOf these, the most promising method appears to be a\n\n\n\nfunction of the application.\n\nIt is shown that a 2-meter octahedral corner\n\n\n\nreflector, visible to Venus orbiting radar can be built for a mass of\n\n\nabout 10kg.\n\nSmall retroreflectors can probably withstand the severe condi\xc2\xad\n\n\ntions of the Venusian surface for a period of the order of 20 to 50 years.\n\n\nMeasurements from Earth-based radar, however, would require a corner\n\n\nreflector of from 6 to 10 meters on an edge that would necessarily weigh\n \n\nseveral hundred kilograms at best and would probably require the delivery\n\n\nof about one ton of mass to the surface.\n\n\nThis rather negative result, while not totally precluding the\n\n\npossibility of a large Venus benchmark, led to consideration of technology\n\n\nrequirements for long-life, high-temperature transponders that could pro\xc2\xad\n\nvide the same function for perhaps an order of magnitude less mass deliv\xc2\xad\n\nered to the surface.\n\nThe severe conditions of temperature and pressure\n\n\n\nat Venus yield requirements for a very rugged device whose lifetime is\n\n\ndifficult to predict.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect lifetimes of sev\xc2\xad\n\n\neral years for .such transponders but the desire to make measurements over\n\n\ndecade-long periods for comparative planetology will not be easily ful\xc2\xad\n\nfilled by a new-technology transponder.\n\nBoth the large (10-meter) retro\xc2\xad\n\n\nreflector and the long-life high-temperature transponder offer exciting\n\n\nchallenges of technology development that can lead to an enhanced capabil\xc2\xad\n\nity to understand the dynamics of the solar system.\n\n\n1-1\n\n\n\nThe report is the result of a short study conducted during the\n\n\nsummer of 1978 as part of NASA\'s planetary advanced studies program.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nfundamental idea was to examine the value and difficulty of placing a\n\n\nnumber of semi-permanent benchmarks on the planetary surfaces for use as\n\n\nreference points for long-term studies of planetary motion and structural\n\n\ndynamics.\n\nThe concept was suggested by G. Colombo and has been discussed\n\n\n\ninformally for several years by Shapiro, Pettingill, and Colombo.\n\n\nThe report begins with a major section on science rationale\n\n\noutlining the several types of planetological data that can be obtained\n\n\nfrom long-term, high accuracy, radar measurements of range and doppler\n\n\nshift.\n\nIncluded in a later section on transponder design are arguments\n\n\n\nshowing that the direction of the Venus pole can be measured with an\n\n\naccuracy of one or (perhaps) two orders of magnitude improvement over\n\n\ncurrent techniques.\n\nThis knowledge, coupled with a similar improvement\n\n\n\nin spin rate determination, should lead to a parallel improvement in\n\n\nknowledge of the internal structure of Venus and its possible modes of\n\n\nresonance interaction with the Earth\'s motion.\n\n\nA similarly important but not so striking improvement in\n\n\nknowledge of the ephemeris of Venus could have long-term implications\n \n\nfor our knowledge of the dynamics of the inner solar system.\nephemeris errors are about 40 km.\n\nCurrent\n\n\n\nEarth-based ranging to fixed bench\xc2\xad\n\n\nmarks on the Venusian surface could improve this knowledge by a factor\n\n\nof two or three with most of the residual error remaining in the direc\xc2\xad\n\ntion normal to Venus\' orbit plane.\n\nTracking of surface benchmarks from\n\n\n\norbiting spacecraft could yield an even greater advantage if the space\xc2\xad\n\ncraft orbit can be accurately determined from Earth.\n\nCombinations of\n\n\n\nEarth-based and orbital tracking could yield an extremely accurate\n \n\ndetermination of the motion of the center of mass of Venus, perhaps to\n\n\nthe level of tens of meters over a long observation time.\n\nMeasurements\n\n\n\nof this type would provide major inputs for comparison of the predictions\n\n\nof several hypotheses of relativity.\n\n\nLong-life, passive benchmarks fixed to the surfaces of the\n \n\nplanets would provide a cartographic reference system that could be used\n\n\nfor all mapping and landing missions in the next several decades.\n\nFur\xc2\xad\n\n\nthermore, the data from several orbital missions could be accurately\n\n\n1-2\n\n\n\ncoordinated through knowledge of the locations of a few benchmarks\n\n\nrelative to the motion of each independent spacecraft.\n\nThis reference\n\n\n\nsystem would allow accurate compilation of data from several missions\n\n\nwidely spaced in time and would help to provide discrimination between\n\n\nthe temporal and spatial character of the observed phenomena.\n\n\nThe most rewarding application of benchmark technology is,\n\n\nnot surprisingly, the most demanding.\n\nOne of the major objectives of\n\n\n\nthis study has been to evaluate the potential of a system of benchmarks\n\n\nto provide a base for realistic comparative planetary morphology and\n\n\nstructural dynamics.\n\nIf measurements accurate to the level of tens of\n\n\n\ncentimeters are feasible on Earth, they will someday be so on Venus and\n\n\nMars.\n\nIt was our hope, in this study, to find a way of making such\n\n\n\nmeasurements on the surface of Venus but, because of power (bandwidth)\n\n\nlimitations on available equipment, it appears that the best one can\n\n\nhope for in the near future is a range resolution of the order of a\n\n\nfew meters to a few tens of meters, although these values may be improved\n\n\nby clever modeling and extended observation.\n\n\nNevertheless, these kinds of measurements are of such funda\xc2\xad\n\nmental importance to a clear understanding of the roles of the several\n\n\nprocesses at work in the formation and evolution of planets that viable\n\n\nmethods of obtaining the required accuracy are laudable goals worthy\n\n\nof more effort than we\'have been able to devote in this study.\n\nThis is\n\n\n\nnot to say that centimeter level accuracy is not obtainable with the\n\n\ntechniques examined here but that we have not been able to find a clear\n\n\ndemonstration that they are.\n\nAs the methods of radio science are\n\n\n\nimproved with innovations like Very Long Baseline Interferometry and\n\n\nsophisticated pulse compression techniques, the viability and then\n\n\ncurrent usefulness of long-life benchmarks will increase proportionally.\n\n\nBecause of this potential usefulness, the application of\n\n\nbenchmark technology to measurement of planetary tectonic activity is\n\n\ndiscussed in some detail.\n\nThe importance of the mantle (and plate)\n\n\n\ndynamics to discrimination of formation processes is emphasized and some\n\n\nthought experiments are performed to estimate the number and position of\n\n\nbenchmarks that would be required to detect the motions of the Earth\'s\n\n\nplates from orbit or from a distant planet.\n\nIt is shown that six bench\xc2\xad\n\n\nmarks would be sufficient to detect the gross features of terrestrial\n\n\n1-3\n\n\n\nplate tectonics over an observation period of about 20 years if the\n\n\nmeasurement system is accurate to about one meter.\n\n\nBut there is one caveat to the arguments that such measure\xc2\xad\n\n-ments are-wi-thin- the range of near-future capability; atmospheric tur\xc2\xad\n\nbulence may introduce errors that make centimeter level accuracy very\n\n\ndifficult or impossible to achieve.\n\nThe complexity of this problem puts\n\n\n\nit well beyond the scope of this study and it was quickly decided that\n\n\nsuch deliberations should be left to more near-term projects like VOR\n\n\nwhere their solutions are more urgent.\n\n\nWith the exception of possible neutral atmospheric turbulence\n\n\nproblems, however, it is suggested that a valuable program of compara\xc2\xad\n\ntive planetology could be started for very low cost and within the next\n\n\nfew years by delivery of a small number of rugged passive or (shorter\xc2\xad\n\nlived) active benchmarks to the surface of Venus.\n\n\nSection 3 of this report contains calculations of the radar\n\n\nsystem requirements for obtaining useful measurements from benchmarks.\n \n\nPrimary emphasis is placed on estimation of the size and gain charac\xc2\xad\n\nteristics of wire mesh corner reflectors in the form of octahedral\n\n\nstructures that tend to return a radar signal to its source no matter\n\n\nwhat direction the signal comes from.\n\n\nThe discussion is divided into two parts that characterize\n\n\nthe two basic areas of study.\n\nFirst is the problem of distinguishing\n\n\n\nthe signal returned by a distant benchmark from the inherent thermal\n\n\nnoise in the receiver.\n\nSecond is the problem of distinguishing the\n\n\n\nsignal returned by a benchmark from the signal returned by the surround\xc2\xad\n\ning terrain (clutter) if the benchmark is on a planet.\n\nThese aspects\n\n\n\nof detectability are discussed in turn and it is shown that corner\n\n\nreflectors on Venus of the order of 6 to 10 meters on a side should\n \n\nbe detectable by Earth-based radar installations like Arecibo or Gold\xc2\xad\n\nstone using observing times of one to four hours at S band frequencies.\n\n\nThe reflective and focusing characteristics of radar corner\n\n\nreflectors are considered and it is shown that the radar cross section\n\n\nof these devices is proportional to the fourth power of the length of an\n\n\n\n1-4\n\n\n\nedge and to the square of the frequency of the radar signal.\n\nFrom this\n\n\n\nresult, one might expect that the highest attainable frequency would be\n\n\nused but, because of atmospheric attenuation at Venus, the highest use\xc2\xad\n\nful frequency is S band (X 12 cm).\n\n\nSmaller benchmarks are shown to be easily detectable by\n\n\norbital radar; octahedral structures forming eight corner reflectors\n\n\nwith edges of 2 meters should appear very bright to orbital radar systems\n\n\nlike VOIR even at L band (X = 25 cm).\n\nDetails of the reflectivity of\n\n\n\ncorner reflectors and their relative brightness against backgrounds of\n\n\nvarious terrain are presented parametrically.\n\n\nIt was not surprising that a study of this nature led to\n\n\nconsideration of other applications and techniques of benchmark tech\xc2\xad\n\nnology.\ntions.\n\nMany possible reflectors were considered for various applica\xc2\xad\n\nThese included wire-mesh phased arrays, large groups of randomly\n\n\n\noriented needles, and very long wires with radar dipoles spaced in phase\n\n\nalong the wires.\n\nNone of these ideas under preliminary examination\n\n\n\nseemed to offer any advantage over corner reflectors, and the concepts\n\n\nwere shelved for possible rejuvenation in other applications.\n\n\nBut the broader range of thinking brought out the possibil\xc2\xad\n\nity of very long distance communication using high-powered lasers.\n\nAn\n\n\n\noptical corner reflector, it was found, could return a laser beam from\n\n\nincredible distances.\n\nThis line of thinking led to the question of\n\n\n\nwhether or not it is feasible to track an array of optical corner reflec\xc2\xad\n\ntors in very deep space or to track them in orbits near the sun to deter\xc2\xad\n\nmine the gravitational structure of the inner solar system.\n\nThe possibil\xc2\xad\n\n\nity became clear that one might discriminate between the several\n\n\nhypotheses of general relativity through an accurate determination of the\n \n\norbit of an optical benchmark and through the simultaneous determination\n\n\nof the quadrapole moment of the Sun.\n\n\nThese studies brought out yet another unexpected aspect of\n\n\nthe benchmark problem, the problem of relative motion of benchmark and\n\n\nreceiver.\n\nFor communication with a distant corner reflector, the\n\n\ntransmitter/receiver must be within a certain angular range of the signal\n\n\n\npath in order to receive the returned signal.\n\nIn other words, if the\n\n\n\nmotion of the Earth (transmitter/receiver) across the signal path is\n\n\n\n1-5\n\n\n\nlarger than a certain small fraction of the speed of light, the receiver\n\n\non Earth will no longer be within the beamwidth of the reflected signal\n\n\nand a passive reflector is useless except during the few days per year\n\n\nwhen the Earth moves along the line of .sight to the benchmark.\n\n\nThus we came to discover that for deep space applications,\n\n\nthe original goal of long life through design of a completely passive\n\n\ndevice was extremely difficult for the distances we had begun to consider\n\n\n(30 to 100 A.U.).\n\nIt became apparent that the passive radar retrore\xc2\xad\n\n\nflector was probably untenable for very long-range applications and that\n\n\nthe next best thing for the intended application was a very simple, very\n\n\nrugged, overdesigned transponder that required no antenna pointing even\n\n\nat the outer limits of the solar system.\n\nWith the development of\n\n\n\nincreased laser power potentially available in the next decade, the deep\n\n\nspace laser retroreflector concept might become feasible.\n\nInner solar\n\n\n\nsystem applications of passive laser and radar retroreflectors are prob\xc2\xad\n\nably feasible now.\n\n\nThe discussion of radar systems includes consideration of\n\n\nsimple transponders that might be designed to have lifetimes of many\n\n\nyears, perhaps many decades.\n\nThe major advantage of such devices comes\n\n\n\nfrom the increased signal return that makes possible more precise mea\xc2\xad\n\nsurements for a given level of Earth-based radar capability.\n\nThe major\n\n\n\ndisadvantage, of course, comes from the expected short lifetimes of such\n\n\ndevices for use on -Venus if they are built with conventional electronic\n\n\ntechnology.\n\n\nThe challenge of building a high-temperature, long life\n\n\ntransponder and the possibility of realizing the scientific value of\n\n\nsuch a device led to conceptual design for a one-watt simple repeater\n\n\nusing technology that is currently being developed at Los Alamos for\n\n\nsubterranean applications.\n\nThe conceptual design and an interesting\n\n\n\ndiscussion of how it might be developed is reported in Section 4.\n\n\nThe work at Los Alamos involved development of components\n\n\ncalled integrated thermionic circuits (ITC\'s) to be used at temperatures\n\n\nof about 5000C and expected to last for several decades.\n\nThese devices,\n\n\n\nconsisting of vacuum-tube components mounted on sapphire substrate, were\n\n\nassumed as part of the design for a Venus surface transponder.\n\n\n\n1-6\n\n\n\nThis section includes discuss-ions of fused salt batteries that\n\n\nare naturally high-temperature devices, convection cooled radioisotope\n\n\nthermionic generators for power, and vacuum tube cathode heating power\n\n\nsupplied directly by a few grams of radioactive material without the need\n\n\nto convert the energy to electrical and then back to thermal motion of\n\n\nthe cathode electrons.\n\n\nThe most difficult problem of the conceptual design is in the\n\n\nassurance of a stable local oscillator to control the heterodyne process\n\n\nrequired to obtain sufficient isolation of the received signal from the\n\n\nretransmitted radiation.\n\n\nThese factors are discussed in conjunction with other diffi\xc2\xad\n\nculties, and some clever possible solutions to the local oscillator\n\n\nstability problem are presented.\n\nIt is suggested that the development\n\n\n\nof Venus surface transponders may not be so difficult as one might imag\xc2\xad\n\nine in view of the credible design outlined here \'that is composed entire\xc2\xad\n\nly of existing components.\n\nThe only pervading problem with the high\n\n\n\ntemperature transponder is that of making certain of a long lifetime.\n\n\nIt is pointed out that long-life electronic components have been in use\n \n\nfor over 20 years in the transatlantic cables and that the development\n\n\nof similar technology for use on the planetary surfaces represents an\n\n\nexciting challenge for the Laboratory that might very well yield the\n\n\nlong-term, high accuracy results necessary to the comparative plane\xc2\xad\n\ntology experiments discussed in Section 2.\n\n\nThe discussion of high-temperature transponders was placed\n\n\nafter the section on radar systems for reasons of continuity.\n\nIn Section\n \n\n\n5, we return to the problem of passive benchmark design which was one of\n\n\nthe original goals of the study.\n\nThe structural analysis shows that\n\n\n\noctahedral retroreflectors with dimensions of the order of a few meters\n\n\ncan be built to withstand the Venusian environment using techniques\n\n\ncurrently available for deployable space antennas.\n\nLenticular welded\n\n\n\nbeams used for the Lockheed wrapped-rib antenna form the basis of a\n\n\nconceptual design for a 2-meter octahedral wire-mesh retroreflector that\n\n\ncan be distinguished from the surface clutter by orbital radar systems\n\n\nnow being designed for use at Venus.\n\n\n\n1-7\n\n\n\nBut a Venus surface retroreflector detectable by Earth-based\n\n\nradar is a much more difficult problem.\n\nEstimates show that an octahe\xc2\xad\n\n\ndral reflector with 6-meter compression beams would be barely detectable\n\n\nfrom Earth under the best observing conditions.\n\nA very preliminary con\xc2\xad\n\n\nceptual design for a 10-meter reflector showed that the strongest lentic\xc2\xad\n\nular welded beams were incapable of self-deployment by their own stored\n\n\nenergy.\n\n\nThe lenticular beam concept allows one to flatten the semi\xc2\xad\n\ncylindrical structure and roll it up like photographic film.\n\nWhen the\n\n\n\nbands around the rolled-up beam are released, the elastic energy in the\n\n\ncompressed structure is released and the beam deploys as the main-spring\n\n\nof a mechanical watch would if released from its constraining case.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is a practical limit to the thickness\n\n\nof the walls of lenticular welded beams that precludes its use for sus\xc2\xad\n\ntaining Venus surface loads if the compression members are longer than\n\n\na few meters.\n\n\nThe 10-meter design, then, seemed to require the use of astro\xc2\xad\n\nmast technology with complications of deployment and stabilization in\n\n\nthe expected winds.\n\nEstimates of the mass of such a structure quickly\n\n\n\nreached. several hundred kilograms and the difficulties of deployment\n\n\nwere so formidable that it was decided to give up on the idea of a pas\xc2\xad\n\nsive reflector of that size and complexity on the surface of Venus.\n\n\nThe decision to give up on the large benchmark should not be\n\n\nconstrued as a statement that it is impossible but it seems unlikely that\n\n\na project of such complexity and mass requirement would have much chance\n\n\nof being approved.\n\nAs the technology for large deployable structures\n\n\n\nimproves and as the capability of Earth-based radar increases, the long\xc2\xad\n\nlife passive Venus benchmark should be reviewed from time to time.\n\n\nA possibly very low cost, cooperative venture would be pos\xc2\xad\n\nsible by placement of a small (2-3 meter) retroreflector atop future\n\n\nRussian Venus landers.\n\nA conceptual design is presented showing that a\n\n\n\nten kilogram benchmark could be mounted near the top of a lander and\n\n\ncould be deployed by a timer device after the main lander mission is\n\n\n\n1-8\n\n\n\nfinished.\n\nThe lander/benchmark combination would then form a semi\xc2\xad\n\n\npermanent reference point on the surface for future missions and perhaps\n \n\nfor future improved Earth-based or Earth-orbital based radar.\n\n\nFinally, in Section 5, there is a discussion of the possibil\xc2\xad\n\nity of constructing large octahedral retroreflectors for deep space and\n\n\norbital tracking.\n\nThe lenticular w$lded beam concept is at its best in\n\n\n\ndeep space where the loads are minimized and, it is shown, some very\n\n\nlarge self-erecting reflectors can be built for modest mass requirements.\n\n\nSection 6 contains discussions of several miscellaneous\n\n\napplications of benchmark technology including a promising application\n\n\nof passive retroreflectors as landing beacons.\n\nThe benchmarks can be\n\n\n\nused as surface reference points for active radar transmitters on landers\n \n\nto permit accurate landing capability.\n\nThe details of a conceptual\n\n\n\nlander control system have been worked out in a preliminary way and the\n\n\nidea looks quite promising.\n\n\nAlso in Section 6 is a discussion of an application that\n\n\ntakes advantage of the low power requirements of a transmitter in the\n\n\nouter solar system.\n\nIt was shown in Section 3 thatpower requirements\n\n\n\nfor transponders as far away as 80 to 100 A.U. are less than one watt\n\n\nto be detectable by the large radio telescopes on Earth.\n\nIt may be pos\xc2\xad\n\n\nsible to launch a large number of very small, very simple, probes to the\n\n\nouter solar system to determine the gravitational and electromagnetic\n\n\nstructure of the space beyond Pluto\'s orbit.\n\nThe concept is discussed\n\n\n\nonly briefly in this report as it came to mind at the end of the study\n\n\nand will be the subject of more thorough examination during FY 1979.\n\n\nIn this study we have tried to strike a balance between cov\xc2\xad\n\nering many possibilities for benchmark technology and covering some\xc2\xad\n\noptions in enough detail to allow a rational evaluation of feasibility.\n\n\nBecause of this approach, parts of the report will appear somewhat dis\xc2\xad\n\n.joint.\n\nThe reader is asked to remember the preliminary nature of the\n\n\n\nstudy and to bear with the authors in regions where the subject matter\n\n\nmay appear unrelated to earlier sections.\nof conclusions and recommendations.\n\n\n\n1-9\n\n\n\nSection 7 has a brief summary\n\n\n\nSECTION 2\n\n\n\nSCIENCE RATIONALE\n\n\n\n2.1\n\nSUMMARY OF SCIENCE RATIONALE\n\n\nCurrently our detailed knowledge of Venus is restricted\n\n\n\nprimarily to upper atmospheric structure and phenomena.\n\nAt the surface,\n\n\n\nonly the very basic environmental parameters are known from the success\xc2\xad\n\nful Russian landers.\n\nPioneer Venus will again concentrate on the atmo\xc2\xad\n\n\nsphere but is expected to yield some surface topography data.\n\nIf VOIR\n\n\n\nbecomes a mission, the planet surface will be mapped morphologically,\n\n\nbut ongoing surface dynamics will not be unambiguously revealed.\n\n\nThe Venus Benchmark offers the potential of answering cur\xc2\xad\n\nrent dynamical questions in several areas, as well as supporting some\n\n\nVOIR objectives.\n\nThrough precise tracking of radar reflectors or trans\xc2\xad\n\n\nponders fixed to Venus\' surface, the planet\'s ephemeris may be\n\n\nimproved considerably beyond the capabilities of current radar and\n\n\noptical techniques.\n\nCertain aspects of internal dynamics, such as\n\n\n\nrotation rate, angular momentum vector direction (pole position), and\n\n\nany perturbations such as would be characteristic of Chandler wobble may\n\n\nbe measured with high precision.\n\nWith a highly accurate benchmark sys\xc2\xad\n\n\ntem, crustal motion and plate tectonic activity, if present, may be\n\n\ndetected and the past distinguished from the present.\n\nSome lower atmo\xc2\xad\n\n\nspheric phenomena unmeasurable by orbiting spacecraft, such as wind\n\n\ndirection, turbulence, and parameters like temperature, pressure and\n\n\nintegrated density may be monitored over long time periods.\n\nIn support\n\n\n\nof VOIR and later mapping missions, a small system of benchmarks may be\n\n\nused to establish cartographic control from a very early stage, per\xc2\xad\n\nmitting a more coordinated study of global data.\n\n\nBy providing a unique solution to operating in a harsh\n\n\nenvironment, the Venus Benchmark can plug some gaps in our knowledge of\n\n\nEarth\'s nearest planetary neighbor.\n\nWith a long lifetime, the passive\n\n\n\nBenchmark provides the ability to monitor variable parameters over long\n\n\ntime periods and creates an opportunity for measurement which has to\n\n\ndate been available only on Earth.\n\nExtension of the Benchmark concept\n\n\n\n2-1\n\n\n\nand these advantages to bodies other than Venus is almost certainly\n \n\npossible, though some operational and design changes are necessary to\n\n\noperate in different environments and farther from Earth.\n \n\n\n2.2\n\nCURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF VENUS (Ref. 2-1 - 2-4)\n\n\nDetailed observations of Venus from spacecraft first began\n\n\n\nwith the flyby of Mariner 2 in 1962.\n\nBecause of its nearness, Venus was\n\n\n\na logical choice as a first planetary target, but ever since then con\xc2\xad\n\ncrete information has been slow in coming despite-active programs here\n\n\nand in the Soviet Union.\n\nEarly data from telescopic observations con\xc2\xad\n\n\nsisted of measurements of albedo and the radius of Venus at the cloud\xc2\xad\n\ntop level.\nobscured.\n\nIt was generally believed that the surface was totally\n\n\nRadar measurements showed a surface not uniformly smooth at\n\n\n\nthe 1962 conjunction, indicating at least that the whole planet was not\n\n\nocean-covered.\n\nMicrowave radiometers (3-20 cm) indicated a surface with\n\n\n\nan- 700K black body temperature, but some believed this emission could\n\n\nresult from ionospheric or lightning emissions with a cool surface.\n\nA\n\n\n\nmagnetic field was presumed.\n\n\nMariner 2 had a limited scientific capability, but made two\n\n\nespecially important measurements.\n\nTracking data yielded Venus\' mass,\n\n\n\nwhich in turn revealed the bulk density to be similar to Earth.\n\nInfra\xc2\xad\n\n\nred radiometers measured cloud-top temperatures and showed limb darken\xc2\xad\n\ning, indicating a thick atmosphere.\n\nGround-based polarimetry by Clark\n\n\n\nand Kuz\'min were considered consistent with a hot surface, but this\n\n\nhypothesis was not uniformly accepted.\n\n\nPrior to 1965, only carbon dioxide had been identified as a\n\n\nsignificant constituent without question, but its percentage was quoted\n\n\nin the literature from 5-100%.\n\nWater was reported in small quantities.\n \n\n\nSpectroscopic observations in 1966 identified CO, HCl and HF.\n\nSurface\n\n\n\npressures were completely uncertain, with quoted ranges from 5 to\n \n\n300 bars.\n\nNo ionosphere was observed and nothing about solar wind\n\n\n\ninteraction was known.\n\n\nRussia announced the landing of Venera-4 (on 18 October\n\n\n1967), measuring a cooler atmosphere and lower pressure than anticipated.\n\n\n\n2-2\n\n\n\nHowever, the Mariner 5 flyby data (closest approach occurred on 19\n\n\nOctober 1967, the day after the Venera-4 entry), after considerable\n\n\nanalysis, indicated higher surface temperatures and pressures than the\n\n\nVenera data, forcing the eventual conclusion that Venera-4 in fact did\n \n\nnot land prior to loss of signal, and requiring a considerable change\n\n\nin theories of the Venus environment.\n\n\nA post-Mariner-5 synthesis of Venera and Mariner data gave\n\n\nquantitative credibility to the heavy atmosphere/hot surface Mariner-2\n\n\ndata, yielding a surface equatorial radius of 6053 km and cloud-top\n\n\naltitude of 67 \xc2\xb1 10 km, a CO2 content exceeding 85% with upper limits\n\n\non N 2 , 02 and H20.\n\nTemperature and pressure profiles were calculated\n\n\n\nfrom 25 to 90 km with further extrapolation to the surface indicating\n\n\na temperature of 700 K and a pressure of 100 bars.\natmospheric data were also compiled.\n\nDetailed upper\n\n\n\nA bow shock was detected and a\n\n\n\nmagnetic field found virtually non-existent.\n\n\nHigh resolution radiometry has demonstrated that there is\n\n\nno significant temperature variation over the disc of Venus (\xc2\xb150C)\n\n\n(Ref. 2-5).\n\nThus, the poles appear to be as hot as the equator, and the\n\n\n\ndark side is as hot as the illuminated side.\n\nThis suggests that the\n\n\n\nlower atmosphere is well mixed by global convection.\n\nDirect measure\xc2\xad\n\n\nments of the atmosphere have established that CO2 represents 97% of the\n\n\ngasses.\n\nA surface temperature of 4500C and a pressure of about 90 atmo\xc2\xad\n\n\nspheres seem to be consistent with both the direct and remote sensing\n\n\ndata.\n\nThe upper atmosphere also contains a number of trace gases.\n\n\nVery small quantities of carbon monoxide, water vapor,\n\n\n\nhydrochloric acid, and hydrofluoric acid have been identified spectro\xc2\xad\n\ngraphically.\n\nIt also believed that sulfuric acid exists in the upper\n\n\n\natmosphere at a height where the temperature is low enough to condense\n\n\nthe acid which falls as small droplets into the hotter atmosphere where\n\n\nit again evaporates.\n\nThus a perpetual rain of sulfuric acid may be\n\n\n\noccurring.\n\n\nSince Mariner 5, the Soviets have enjoyed considerable\n\n\nsuccess in their Venus program.\n\nVenera 7-10 all reached the surface,\n\n\n\nwith the latter two making numerous detailed in situ measurements on\n\n\n\n2-3\n\n\n\nthe surface as well as taking atmospheric data during descent.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nsurface temperature, pressure, optical and wind environments are all\n\n\nknown for two widely separated locations over about an hour\'s time.\n\n\nHowever, the difficulty of characterizing the.-surface--or-meteorology\n\n\nof Earth with a single hour\'s measurements taken under similar condi\xc2\xad\n\ntions should be kept in mind.\n\n\nThree important surface properties which are not as subject\n\n\nto the above spatial and temporal limitations were measured by Venera 9\n\n\nand 10, with some supporting Venera 8 data.\n\nA gamma-ray experiment on,\n\n\n\nVenera 8 measured inherent surface rock radioactivity (which can vary\n\n\nover a quite broad range for different rock types) indicative of sili\xc2\xad\n\nceous rocks (like granite), while the later landers measured emissions\n\n\nfrom naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium and\n\n\npotassium indicative of more maf-ic rocks (like basalts).\n\nVenera 10 per\xc2\xad\n\n\nformed a gamma-ray scattering experiments to measure the density of\n\n\nsurface rocks (as opposed to the bulk density of Venus).\n\nPrior to this,\n\n\n\nground-based radar measurements attempting to correlate density with\n\n\npermitivity had given a broad range of density from 1 to 4.3 gm-cm-3\n\n\n-3\n(with some confidence in the 1.5 to 2.8 gm-cm\nrange), which tells very\n\n-3\nlittle. Venera 10 data narrowed the range to 2.88 \xc2\xb10.1 gm-cm , con\xc2\xad\n\nsistent with the basaltic interpretation of the gamma spectrometer\n\n\nexperiment.\n\nThese data taken together very strongly indicate that Venus\n\n\n\nhas undergone differentiation and even\'suggest different types of sur\xc2\xad\n\nface rock with at least regional variation.\n\n\nMuch of what is known about the surface of Venus, except\n\n\nfor radiometric brightness, has been discovered by radar.\n\nA number of\n\n\n\nsurface features having anomalous ability to backscatter microwaves\n\n\nwere discovered by Goldstein and Carpenter in 1964 (Ref. 2-6, 2-7).\n\n\nThese were confirmed by groups at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the\n\n\nArecibo Observatory.\n\nRecently higher resolution radar mapping of the\n\n\n\nequatorial region has revealed that the surface of Venus has many\n\n\ncraters, small mountains, long ridges and rilles, and a large canyon.\n\n\nObservations of these features have been useful in refining the measure\xc2\xad\n\nment of the spin vector of Venus.\n\nMost recently Zohar at JPL has\n \n\n\nreleased new measurements which are given with prior values in\n\n\nTable

of four recent conjunctions.\n\nThe rotation period\n\n\n\nsuggested by these determinations is just slightly off the earth\xc2\xad\n\nsynchronous value of 243.16 days.\n\nThis value would cause Venus to\n\n\n\npresent the same longitude to an observer on earth at each inferior\n \n\nconjunction.\n\nThe rotation is actually retrograde, so the spin axis\n \n\n\nis directed in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThis rotation period implies\n \n\n\na Venusian solar day of 117 days, so the subsolar point moves at a\n\n\nrelatively slow rate of 13.54 km/hr.\n\n\nVenus has no significant magnetic field and therefore has no\n\n\ncomplicated ionosphere like the Earth and Jupiter.\ninteracts directly with the solar wind.\n\nIts upper atmosphere\n\n\n\nRadio occultations of Venus by\n\n\n\nMariners 5 and 10 were able to measure the electron density profiles,\n\n\nthe neutral atmosphere profile down to about 35 km, as well as fluctua\xc2\xad\n\ntions in the signal caused by turbulence in the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nmaximum electron density is less than 5 x 105 per cm3 on the day side.\n\n\nNone of the Russian Venera landers contained phase coherent repeaters,\n \n\nso only amplitude fluctuations of the signal demonstrate the effects of\n\n\n\n2-5\n\n\n\nturbulence (Ref. 2-9).\n\nThe percent log-amplitude fluctuations vary\n\n\n\nfrom about 2% at 40 km altitude to 7% at the surface.\n\nThe power spec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntrum of the phase fluctuations can be estimated from these data if\n\n\ncertain constants. in the -turbulent model are assumed (Ref. 2-0, 2-lT.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the values of these constants are not known with any\n\n\ncertainty.\n\n\nTo date, then, only a few basic facts about Venus and its\n\n\nenvironment have been unambiguously determined.\n\nWith the exception of\n\n\n\nupper atmosphere data from Mariner 10, the same level of information\n\n\nabout Earth could be summarized in a few papers.\n\nOur knowledge is\n\n\n\nespecially weak in temporal data, though upper atmospheric behavior\n \n\nhas been reasonably characterized diurnally as the result of numerous\n\n\nradio occultation measurements.\n\nThe Pioneer Venus mission currently in\n\n\n\nflight is mainly atmosphere-oriented, while the nature of planned\n\n\nRussian investigations is unknown (there is a Soviet mission also under\xc2\xad\n\nway).\n\nThe Benchmark, whether an active or passive spacecraft, is the\n\n\n\nonly in situ experiment proposed to date capable of making long-term\n\n\ntemporal measurements, whether of atmospheric parameters, planetary\n\n\ndynamics or crustal motion.\n\nIn this way it offers a substantial con\xc2\xad\n\n\ntribution to the data base acquired from Soviet and U.S. activities.\n\n\n\n2.3\n\nATMOSPHERIC PROFILE MEASUREMENT FROM SIGNAL ALTERATION BY\n\n\nTHE VENUS ATMOSPHERE\n\n\nThe ultimate resolution attainable in imaging the surface\n\n\n\nof Venus is probably set by the atmosphere.\n\nThis is because the phase\n\n\n\ncoherence of the illuminating signal and the return is degraded by tur\xc2\xad\n\nbulence, and some of the energy is absorbed by atmospheric carbon diox\xc2\xad\n\nide and clouds (especially at shorter wavelengths).\n\nIf the benchmark\n\n\n\nis a strong enough source, as it would be if it were a transponder,\n\n\nthe extent of the turbulence could be measured by detecting in some way\n\n\nthe amount of phase demodulation of the signal.\n\nIn addition, if the\n\n\n\ntransponder emitted signals at two different frequencies, say X-band\n\n\nand S-band, the total atmospheric absorption could be determined by\n\n\nmeasuring the relative signal strength, since it has been shown by\n\n\nlaboratory experiments that the refractive properties of CO2 are the\n\n\n\n2-6\n\n\n\nsame at these two frequencies.\n\nBy-experiments such as these using long\xc2\xad\n\n\nlived benchmarks our knowledge of the Venus atmospheric parameters could\n\n\nbe improved greatly, especially regarding their diurnal and seasonal\n\n\nvariability.\n\nMore detailed examination of atmospheric experiments\n\n\n\nusing the benchmark merits further consideration.\n\n\n\n2.4\n\nPOSSIBLE BENCHMARK ADAPTATIONS TO MEASURE SURFACE\n\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA\n\n\nThe harsh environment on Venus\' surface precludes the opera\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion of conventional landers for extended periods of time.\n\nHowever, to\n\n\n\nunderstand lower atmosphere meteorology, which is of interest on Venus\n\n\n(and Mars) for terrestrial comparisons, it is necessary to make some\n\n\nsimple measurements repeatedly over several local days and at several\n\n\nlocations.\n\nThe phenomenon of super refraction prevents radio occulta\xc2\xad\n\n\ntions from penetrating below a few tens of kilometers, so in situ or\n\n\nnear vertical viewing orbital instruments must be employed.\n\nThe Pioneer\n\n\n\nVenus orbiter may provide some of the latter capability for measuring\n\n\nsurface temperature, but many other measurements are prevented by the,\n\n\ndense cloud layers and pressure-broadened CO2 absorption.\n\n\nA possible long-term in situ capability could be provided by\n\n\nunconventional landers operating near ambient temperatures as discussed\n\n\nelsewhere in this report in the context of an active transponder on the\n\n\nsurface.\n\nIndeed many experiments may be operated if the required\n\n\n\nelectronics are within the capability of high temperature technology\n \n\nsuch as might be developed.\n\nAny serious Venus exploration program\n\n\n\nbeyond the current mission should consider this technology.\n\n\nThere may also be an entirely passive approach to measuring\n\n\nwind direction by making suitable modifications to passive radar retro\xc2\xad\n\nreflector design.\n\nThe design presented for a wire-and-strut octahedral\n\n\n\nretroreflector reflects in a roughly uniform pattern from all illumina\xc2\xad\n\ntion geometries; it also does not introduce any polarization bias to the\n\n\nreflected signal.\n\nWith some minor modifications to the baseline retro\xc2\xad\n\n\nreflector design, it is possible to introduce a polarization bias in the\n\n\nreflected signal at some expense to average returned signal strength.\n\n\n\n2-7\n\n\n\nBy introducing polarization into the reflected signal, a\n\n\nnew measurable variable becomes available which can be used as an indi\xc2\xad\n\ncator of surface phenomena.\n-indicating the-direction\n\nsignal.\n\nThis variable is a polarization angle\n\n4,\n\nif the plane of polarization of the returned\n\n\n\nThe polarization angle may be employed to measure wind direc\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion with three modifications to the baseline retroreflector.\n\nFirst,\n\n\n\nthe penetrator (or central mounting support employed on a smaller bench\xc2\xad\n\nmark to secure it to a lander) is provided with a simple free-moving\n\n\nrotary joint whereby the reflector portion of the benchmark may rotate\n\n\nwith respect to its support.\n\nSecond, the regular octahederal shape of\n\n\n\nthe reflector is distorted somewhat to create an aerodynamic center of\n\n\npressure offset from the cental vertical axis of rotation.\n\nIn this way,\n\n\n\nwhen the wind blows, the reflector structure rotates to a preferred ori\xc2\xad\n\n-entation with respect to the wind. Alternatively, a small solid surface\n\n\ncould be placed at one corner of the reflector to act as a weather vane\n\n\nas shown in Figure 2-1.\n\nThe third modification requires that the\n\n\n\nreflective properties of the reflector be altered to introduce a polari\xc2\xad\n\nzation bias.\n\nOne possible method is to use both titanium wires (reflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntive) and glass threads (non-reflective) in place of the all-metal wire\n\n\nmesh on some faces of the benchmark.\n\nFigure 2-2 illustrates one possible\n\n\n\nconfiguration where wires oriented in one direction on the faces in the\n\n\nhorizontal plane are replaced with glass threads.\n\nThe component of\n\n\n\nwaves with their E-vectors parallel to the wires is reflected, while the\n\n\nperpendicular component is not.\n\nThis scheme works best with near\xc2\xad\n\n\nvertical viewing, and not at all for limb viewing, but limb viewing may\n\n\nbe difficult in any case as a result of atmospheric super-refraction.\n\n\nThere is also a 1800 ambiguity in wind direction.\n\nAtmospheric modeling\n\n\n\nmight reduce this ambiguity to at least the more probable of the two\n\n\ndirections.\n\n\nWhile not very sophisticated by comparison with data avail\xc2\xad\n\nable from the surfaces of Mars or Earth, these wind direction measure\xc2\xad\n\nments, especially if-made in a network, would greatly enhance current\n \n\nknowledge of Venus meteorology.\n\nMariner 10 imaging data mapped global\n\n\n\ncirculation in the upper atmosphere and discovered a very distinct\n\n\npattern.\n\nThe total global circulation situation must also include the\n\n\n\nlower atmosphere.\n\nWind direction data alone would be valuable from a\n\n\n\n2-8\n\n\n\nsmall number of benchmark stations scattered around the planet (as would\n\n\nbe the case if crustal motion detection were also a goal of a Venus bench\xc2\xad\n\nmark program).\n\nTemporal variations in any circulation pattern would be\n\n\n\nof very great interest, especially in comparison with the upper atmo\xc2\xad\n\nsphere.\n\nSuch variations in the lower atmosphere are only detectable\n\n\n\nwith a long-life in situ measurement system.\n\n\n\n2.5\n\nINTERNAL STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS\n\n\n\n2.5.1\n\nEphemeris\n\n\nThe ephemeris of Venus is currently determined from optical\n\n\n\nobservations, spacecraft tracking data, and radar observations.\n\nOf\n\n\n\nthese, the primary constraint on the orbital parameters comes from the\n\n\nset of radar data.\n\nThe upgraded Arecibo facility allows precision on\n\n\n\nthe order of 0.1 psec.\n\nThe topography of the equatorial regions of\n\n\n\nthe inner planets limits, however, the usefulness of these data to\n\n\naccuracies of up to 10.kilometers.\n\nVenus equatorial topographic varia\xc2\xad\n\n\ntions are on the order of \xc2\xb13 km, with maximum variation around 5 km.\n\n\nModels for the topography introduce a large number of solve-for param\xc2\xad\n\neters (100) and still leave much high spatial frequency "noise".\n\nMicro\xc2\xad\n\n\nwave retroreflectors fixed on the surface of Venus would be a great\n\n\nadvance over the situation outlined above.\n\nOnly 3 parameters would be\n \n\n\nnecessary to describe exactly each retroreflector position.\n\n\nThe ephemeris of Venus could be significantly improved by a\n\n\nfew years of continuous, accurate range measurements.\n\nAt present, range\n\n\n\ndata for Venus exists over the past decade, but it is rather intermittent\n\n\nand of uncertain accuracy -- 2 km at best.\n\nCombined with the optical\n\n\n\ndata, this yields an Earth-relative ephemeris uncertainty of about\n\n\n50 km.\n\nThe inclusion of continuous accurate (100 m) ranging over the\n\n\n\ntime of one or two synodic periods (1.6 yrs) would decrease the ephemeris\n\n\nuncertainty by a factor of 2 or 3.\n\nThe majority of this uncertainty\n\n\n\nwould lie in the out-of-plane direction since the accuracy in this com\xc2\xad\n\nponent is proportional to 1/sinl where I is the inclination of the orbit\n\n\nof Venus to the ecliptic.\n\nFurthermore, the orbit of the Earth is\n\n\n\npresently determined mainly by the preponderence of the Earth-Mars range\n\n\n\n2-9\n\n\n\ndata from Mariner 9 and Viking.\n\nRanging to Venus.would provide an inde\xc2\xad\n\n\npendent determination of the Earth\'s orbital parameters and as such would\n\n\ngreatly increase the overall integrity of the planetary ephemerides.\n\n\n\n2.5.2\n\nDirect Measurement of Venus Rotational Dynamics\n\n\nAccurate measurements through use of the retroreflectors of\n\n\n\nthe Venus rotation rate and pole orientation would be very valuable new\n\n\nThe state of the Venus angular velocity vector\n\n\n\nscientific,information.\n\nrepresents a major puzzle today for celestial mechanics; the rotation\n\n\nrate appears to be very close but measurably different from the synodic\n\n\nresonance of 243.16 days with the Earth.\n\nIn addition the pole position\n\n\n\nis close to several stable Cassini states but again apparently measur\xc2\xad\n\nably different from each of them.\n\nContinued conventional doppler radar\n\n\n\nmeasurements may not yield definitive determination of this problem,\n\n\nsince "aspect angle" systematic effects on the order of 0.1 day appear\n\n\npossible in\'such data.\n\nPioneer-Venus ranging accuracy will be on the\n \n\n\norder of 0.5 km, with 0.25 km sometimes possible, over a relatively\n\n\nshort lifespan of 1-3 years.\n\nUnambiguous answers to the problems above\n\n\n\nprobably can only be obtained from data with accuracy on the order of\n\n\nthe 100 meters or better.\n\nThe measurement of Venus precession, some\n\n\n\nlarge nutations, and the effects of atmospheric tides on the spin state\n\n\nare other possible scientific returns from the retroreflectors.\n\n\nIf advances in radar technology (e.g., reception of returns\n\n\nby Earth-orbiting antennas and very wide bandwidth reception) make pos\xc2\xad\n\nsible the use of the retroreflectors at decimeter or even centimeter\n\n\naccuracy, then a much larger set of goals can be addressed.\n\nThe advan\xc2\xad\n\n\ntages of such comparisons have been emphasized previously in such fields\n\n\nas planetary atmospheres, ionospheres, and-magnetism.\n\n\nActive systems such as radio transmitters and receivers are\n\n\nnecessary for obtaining in situ planetary measurements and can be used\n\n\nas benchmark components.\n\nHowever, passive systems become desirable for\n\n\n\nmeasuring long time scale phenomena and/or in hostile environments such\n\n\nas the surface of Venus (where the necessary technology for active\n\n\nsystems is still in a primitive development stage).\n\n2-10\n\n\n\nThe value of\n\n\n\nco-located active transmitters with passive long-lived benchmarks has\n\n\nbeen demonstrated with the lunar laser ranging retroreflectors and the\n\n\nApollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) transmitter.\n\n\nThe rotation period and pole position of Venus have been\n\n\ndetermined using radar observations of highly reflective regions on the\n\n\nsurface.\n\nThese regions are sufficiently distinctive that they can be\n\n\n\nidentified from one inferior conjunction to the next.\n\nThe identifica\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion is greatly aided by the (nearly) synodic resonance with the Earth,\n\n\nalthough these "features" are clearly presenting slightly different\n\n\naspects to the radar due to relative orbital and spin orientation\n\n\nchanges between the two planets.\n\nMeasurement uncertainties from ten\n\n\n\nyears of such radar observation are dominated by systematic errors due,\n\n\nin fact, to such aspect changes.\n\nThese uncertainties are estimated for\n\n\n\nthe period at \xc2\xb10.04 (terrestrial) days (the value is at 4 standard\n\n\ndeviations from synodic resonance), and -0.3\ntion.\n\ndegrees for the pole posi\xc2\xad\n\n\nThe synodic lock with Earth requires a "rough" gravitational\n\n\n\nfield, which appears to be also contradicted by observation.\n\nThe long\n \n\n\nperiod and nearly 1800 obliquity strongly suggest, however, that the\n\n\nVenus spin state is the product of an evolution to an equilibrium state.\n\n\nThe equilibrium state which it is observed to have achieved presents\n\n\ndifficulties for which theoretical explanations appear to lack complete\xc2\xad\n\nness.\n\nIf the Venus spin is still evolving under solar solid-body tides,\n\n\n\nthen Venus is within -108 years of being fully despun to solar syn\xc2\xad\n\nchronous rotation (Ref. 2-12, 2-13).\n\nThe probability of our observing\n\n\n\nVenus just at this point in its evolution appears small.\n\nIn addition,\n\n\n\natmospheric tides appear capable of balancing the solar solid-body tides\n\n\n(Ref. 2-14) and make an equilibrium state possible.\n\n\nThe determination of the amplitudes of forced nutations,\n\n\nwhich can be predicted for a rigid body once its gravity field is\n\n\naccurately measured, could yield very important results for planetary\n\n\nphysics.\n\nThe differences from rigid-body predictions will provide\n\n\n\nvaluable information about important questions on the state of the Venus\n\n\ninterior; i.e., whether the core is fluid, and what is the amount of\n\n\ninternal dissipation at the forcing frequencies.\n \n\n\n2-11\n\n\n\nThe detection of free motions similar to the terrestrial\n\n\n"Chandler wobble" would be another case of valuable comparative plane\xc2\xad\n\ntology.\n\nThe Eulerian or Chandler wobble is one-of the motions of the\n\n\n\nrotation axis with respect to a--r-e-f-erence- frame fixe& with respect to\n\n\nthe (non-moving) crust of the Earth.\n\nThis wobble must be distinguished\n\n\n\nfrom changes of the orientation of the rotation axis in inertial space,\n\n\nsuch as precession (26,000 year period for Earth), nutation, long\xc2\xad\n\nperiod variations in the obliquity ("23.05), etc.,\n\n(see Fig. 2-3).\n\nThe\n\n\n\ndetection of the Eulerian of Earth motion from variations in-astronom\xc2\xad\n\nical latitude of various observations was made by S. Chandler in 1891.\n\n\nThe width of the spectral peak centered at -the Chandler frequency\n\n\nimplies that the motion is strongly damped, with a damping time on the\n\n\norder of a few decades ( 20-50 years).\n\nThe Chandler excitation mech\xc2\xad\n\n\nanism and the location of the energy sink for its damping remain unex\xc2\xad\n\nplained, despite much recent theoretical work.\n\nDetection on Venus of\n\n\n\nthe comparable Eulerian motion would provide valuable additional clues\n\n\nto this puzzle.\n\nHow the periods of the free motion are different from\n\n\n\nrigid body values would measflre a whole body value for the effective\n\n\nelasticity of the Venus (interior) at those periods.\n \n\n\n2.5.3 \t\n\nMeasurement of Plate Tectonics on Venus and its\n\n\nPlanetological Significance\n\n\nVarious global features on Earth, such as long mountain\n\n\n\nbelts, island arcs, sea floor spreading and apparent matching fits of\n\n\ncontinents are currently best explained by an overall theory of plate\n\n\ntectonics.\n\nFrom Reference 2-15, "Tectonics refers to the formation and\n\n\n\ndeformation of the Earth\'s crust resulting in large-scale structural\n\n\nfeatures..."\n\nRecent ground-based radar imagery 6f Venus has indicated\n\n\n\nto some interpreters that such large-scale features as rift valleys\n\n\nmight be of \t\ntectonic origin.\n\nIf their interpretations are correct, it\n\n\n\nis reasonable to expect that this tectonic activity has played a signi\xc2\xad\n\nficant role in the surface evolution of at least two planets, and that\n\n\ntectonic activity may still be present on Venus as it is on Earth.\n\n\n\n2-12\n\n\n\nFrom Reference 2-15, "Several major hypotheses stand out...\n\n\nin the study of tectonics:\n\n1) the contracting Earth concept, 2) con\xc2\xad\n\n\ntinental drift, 3) convection currents in the Earth\'s interior, 4) sea\n\n\nfloor spreading, and 5) global expansion."\n\nThe contracting Earth con\xc2\xad\n\n\ncept has been largely rejected as an explanation for terrestrial\n\n\nfeatures, but is apparently analogous to the process responsible (along\n\n\nwith rotational spin-down) for a global -omplex of linear scarps\n\n\nrevealed on Mercury by Mariner 10.\n\nThe expanding Earth hypothesis is\n\n\n\ndisputed, but is supported by several areas of evidence.\n\nIts proof by\n\n\n\ndirect measurement remains impossible at the present time, with the\n\n\nimplied rate on the order of 0.6 mm increase in radius per year.\n\nHow\xc2\xad\n\n\never, groundwork laid by the National Geodetic Satellite Program (NGSP)\n\n\n(Ref. 2-16) and the Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS) probably ensures\n\n\nconfirmation or disproof of this hypothesis sometime in the future.\n\n\nThe bulk of evidence for terrestrial crustal motion is\n\n\nstatic and associational (i.e;, fossil and rock-type correlation, glacial\n\n\ncoverage and polar motion), rather than dynamic, however, direct measure\xc2\xad\n\nments of drift may have been enabled by the NGSP.\n\nSince the first indi\xc2\xad\n\n\ncations of continental drift, seismic measurements and modelling have\n\n\ncontributed to its understanding by mapping regions of plate interaction\n\n\nin three dimensions.\n\nVarious continental drift theories have been pro\xc2\xad\n\n\nposed, all based on static evidence and dating back to A. Snider in\n\n\n1858.\n\nAfter considerable debate and several shifts in "generally\n\n\n\naccepted" geological theory, crustal motion is again generally accepted.\n\n\nDirect measurement may be possible on Venus, as will be addressed later.\n\n\nConvection currents in the Earth\'s mantle were first pro\xc2\xad\n\nposed by Pekeris in 1935, and may enter as a driving mechanism for con\xc2\xad\n\ntinental drift and sea floor spreading.\n\nDriven by the decay of radio\xc2\xad\n\n\nactive isotopes of uranium, potassium and thorium, convection apparently\n\n\ndoes not take the form of simple cells, but may act in concert with\n\n\nother processes not fully understood.\n\nPlate boundaries might be modelled\n\n\n\n(as on Earth) and inferred from surface features of Venus.\n\nIt should be\n\n\n\nnoted that rotation rate differences on Venus and Earth could create a\n\n\ndynamic difference in motion of mantle materials.\n\nAlso, one might\n\n\n\nexpect a lower driving thermal gradient on Venus due both to its smaller\n\n\n\n2-13\n\n\n\nsize (limiting the maximum interior temperature) and its higher surface\n\n\ntemperature.\n\nMaterial transport, if it exists on Venus (and crustal\n\n\n\nmotion would almost certainly require its existence), would imply-a\n\n\npseudoviscofls(plastic)\xc2\xb0mantle.\n\nThis property, in turn, places certain\n\n\n\nrestrictions on materials, density, temperature and pressure regimes\n\n\nwithin the mantle, besides revealing the existence of a mantle itself.\n\n\nSea floor spreading on Earth probably does not require a\n\n\nmarine environment ("sea floor" spreading is active far above sea level\n\n\nin Iceland), and we might expect an analogous process on Venus.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nfirst hypotheses of sea floor spreading were advanced in the early 1960s\n\n\nbased on static evidence left by reversals of the Earth\'s magnetic field\n\n\nin marine basalt on either side of mid-ocean ridges.\n\nBased on positions\n\n\n\nof field reversals and radiosotope dating of the marine basalts, spread\xc2\xad\n\ning rates have been calculated at from 2 to 12 cm per year, depending on\n\n\nlocality.\n\nSuch magnetic evidence will be unavailable on Venus until\n\n\n\nunforeseeably far in the future and perhaps was not produced at all.\n\n\nInference from surface features and direct measurement remain the\n\n\nonly potential methods for ascertaining crustal motion on Venus.\n\nWith\xc2\xad\n\n\nout a long lifetime seismic network on the surface, only the latter\n\n\nmethod is capable of measuring current plate tectonic activity on Venus\n\n\nand allowing the most useful terrestrial comparisons.\n\n\nVertical motions are also of potential interest in ascer\xc2\xad\n\ntaining tectonic activity.\n\nSeveral modestly sized areas on Earth\n\n\n\nexhibit marked variation in vertical movement.\n\nSome measurements have\n\n\n\nbeen made dynamically, while others are inferred by measuring elevations\n\n\nand dating vacated shorelines.\n\nMost vertical uplifts are due to iso\xc2\xad\n\n\nstatic rebound after glacier melting, so are of course not applicable\n\n\nto Venus.*\n\nOther local scale uplifts occur in volcanic areas (e.g.,\n\n\n\nTharsis Ridge, rate = ?, Palmdale Bulge, +30 mm/yr).\n\nLarger scale\n\n\n\nuplifts on Earth are associated with mountain building (as in the\n\n\nHimalayas), but rates are very low (perhaps of order 0.1 mm/yr).\n\n\n\nIf short-period climate variations are the case on Mars, such uplift\n\n\nmight be detectable there especially in polar regions.\n\n\n\n2-14\n\n\n\nIn case rates differ from Earth, however, measurement of vertical\n\n\nuplift should be considered in the design of any planetary benchmark\n\n\nsystem.\n\n\nComparisons made between the inner planets (including the\n\n\nMoon) have lead to the terminology "live" and "dead" planets, the former\n\n\nreferring to bodies with major interior geological processes still\n\n\nongoing.\n\nEarth is unquestionably "live" and the Moon virtually "dead".\n\n\n\nMars must be classed "controversial",\n\nwith Venus and Mercury "unknown".\n\nRadar reflectors on Venus and other planets may offer the opportunity\n\n\nto positively class those planets with respect to interior geological\n\n\nactivity, and to make important comparisons with Earth.\n\n\n\n2.5.4 \t\n\nFeasibility of Dynamically Detecting Tectonic Motion on\n\n\nVenus\n\n\nThe first dynamic measurements on Earth which indicated\n\n\n\ntectonic activity consisted of mapping earthquake epicenters and depth.\n\n\nConcentration of earthquakes in narrow, linear bands of varying depths\n\n\nwas eventually taken to indicate ongoing interaction between crustal\n\n\nplates (only after viewing seismic records along with a great deal of\n\n\nstatic evidence was the seismic data understood).\n\nSeismic networks\'are\n\n\n\ncertainly feasible on Mars and Mercury, and a net has already operated\n\n\non the Moot, but the environment of Venus places obvious restrictions\n\n\non long term operations of any active hardware.\n\nTherefore it seems\n\n\n\nreasonable to use radar benchmarks on the surface as a yardstick to\n\n\nmeasure crustal displacement between benchmarks over the years.\ntwo questions remain-:\n\nNow\n\n\n\n1) Can we reasonably expect a high enough dis\xc2\xad\n\n\nplacement rate between benchmarks to be measurable with a feasible\n\n\nbenchmark design, and 2) how many benchmarks are required to determine\n\n\nif crustal motions exist on Venus?\n\n\n\n2.5.4.1 \t\n\nDisplacement Rates.\n\nSea floor spreading rates on Earth have\n\n\n\nbeen calculated from 2 to 12 cm/yr, measured relative to the mid ocean\n\n\nridge.\n\nTherefore, two markers placed on opposite sides of the ridge\n\n\n\nwould be seen to move at a rate from 4 to 24 cm/yr relative to one\n\n\nanother.\n\nIf we assume the Earth as model (we have little choice) then\n\n\n\n2-15\n\n\n\nwith a benchmark position measurement accuracy on the order of 1 m, this\n\n\nsuggests that detection of movement could occur after 5-20 years, and\n\n\nreasonably accurate rate measurements could be made over a period of 20\n\n\nto 0D \tyears.. While this sounds like a long time, it has only been in\n\n\nthe last decade that such measurements have been possible over long\n\n\ndistances on Earth.\n\n(Improvements in accuracy afforded by benchmark\n\n\n\nposition measurements from orbit might permit roughly a fivefold reduc\xc2\xad\n\ntion in the times listed here.)\n\n\nWithout utilizing fixed landmarks on a planet surface known\n\n\nto high position accuracy, there is piobably no method of ascertaining\n\n\nthe presence of crustal motion on Venus and its current rate.\n\nHowever,\n\n\n\nbased on terrestrial rates, we should note that accuracies of 1 m or\n \n\nbetter are required to conduct these experiments.\n\nAnother important\n\n\n\nfeature of the measurement system must be the ability to repeatedly\n\n\ncalculate the distance between at least two widely separated benchmarks\n\n\non Venus, and this accuracy must be maintained over a period of years.\n\n\n\n2.5.4.2\n\nDetection of Motion.\n\nWhile investigating crustal motion on\n\n\n\nVenus or elsewhere, we actually wish to answer several questions:\n\n\n(1) \t Is there crustal motion on Venus?\n\n\n(2) \t Have we\'made a thorough search?\n\n\n(3) \t (If results are negative) can we be sure it does\n\n\nnot exist (above a certain rate associated with\n\n\na particular maximum surface area)?\n\n\n(4) \t (If results are positive) what are the relative\n\n\ndirections of motion and their rates?\n \n\n(5) \t Can we construct an accurate map of crustal motions\n\n\nand boundaries by correlation with imagery of surface\n\n\nfeatures?\n\n\nAnswering each question requires a more complex benchmark system.\n\n\nSince all crustal motion on a planet surface is relative\n\n\nbetween plates, rather than to a fixed point, it is obvious that to\n\n\nanswer question (1), we need a minimum of 2 benchmarks.\n\nHowever, only\n\n\n\nfortuitous placement is likely to permit detection of displacement.\n\n\nLacking a priori knowledge, it is instructive to imagine that we are\n\n\n\n2-16\n\n\n\ndealing with a cloud-shrouded Earth of unknown crustal structure and\n\n\nthen examine the results we might get with different benchmark distri\xc2\xad\n\nbutions.\n\nFigure 2-4 is a map of the six major and about a dozen of the\n\n\n\nmore significant minor plates on the Earth.\n\nEven widely separated, two\n\n\n\nbenchmarks could be moving in the same direction at similar rates,\n \n\nrendering relative motion undetectable.\n\n\nTo answer question (2) on Earth, four widely spaced bench\xc2\xad\n\nmarks might be capable of assuring detection.\n\nHere one might see motion\n\n\n\nof one point relative to the other three, but this might also be the\n\n\nresult of Earth\'s particular plate configuration.\n\nIt is estimated that\n\n\n\n6 benchmarks are required to assure detection of crustal motion or to\n\n\nconfirm its non-existence on a significant scale (answering questions\n\n\n1-3).\n\n\nSix benchmarks, at the ends of 3 orthogonal axes originating\n\n\nat the planet center, should also provide a qualitative answer to\n\n\nquestion (4), which will reveal a pseudoviscous mantle, mantle heating\n\n\nand other indications of pressure, temperature and density regimes.\n\n\nQuestion (5) will require more study but is probably beyond\n\n\nthe scope of the proposed Venus Benchmark project.\n\nIt would be sensible\n\n\n\nto not consider (5) until questions (1)-(4) are answered conclusively.\n \n\nMapping could also be addressed in a much more sensible manner after\n\n\nsome knowledge and study of global surface features at the resolution\n\n\nprovided by the proposed Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar (VOIR) mission.\n\n\nIf we were to map Venus crustal motions to the accuracy shown in Fig\xc2\xad\n\nure 2-4, using benchmarks alone, probably several hundred would be\n\n\nrequired.\n\nInterpretation of imagery might reduce this number somewhat\n\n\n\nbelow 100, but clearly this is beyond our present scope.\n\n\n\n2.5.4.3\n\nPossible Experiment Result Scenarios.\n\nAssuming surface radar\n\n\n\nimaging and multiple benchmark data (from perhaps 6 benchmarks) could be\n\n\nexamined together in the future, there are several possible scenarios of\n\n\nthe geologic picture we might get, as illustrated in Table 2-2.\n\nWithout\n\n\n\nbenchmarks, presumably only the imaging data are available and we have the\n\n\nthree possible scenarios listed vertically in Table 2-2.\n\nThe utility of\n\n\n\nstudying crustal motion on Venus using benchmarks is illustrated by\n\n\n\n2-17\n\n\n\nTable 2-2.\n\nSome possible future scenarios of plate tectonic evidence on Venus. Six scenarios of\n\n\ngeneral plate tectonic evidence are considered, with each combination suggesting\n \n\ndirection of possible geological conclusions. The possible conclusions are by no means\n\n\nexhaustive, nor do they account for the wealth of detail and subtleties which will be\n\n\npresent in the data. Detail in the data is likely to permit discrimination between the\n\n\npossibilities suggested or to introduce new possibilities.\n\n\nBenchmarks Indicate:\n\n\nCrustal Motion \t\n\nPlate tectonics is

on planetary\n\n\nsurfaces, or may indicate surface erosion rates.\n\nTaken out of the con\xc2\xad\n\n\ntext of surface imagery and mapping, benchmarks alone can tell about\n\n\nthe interior processes and activity on Venus, especially if crustal\n\n\nmotion is detected.\n\nObserving all these possible scenarios together,\n\n\n\nit is apparent that a small network of benchmarks on Venus can contri\xc2\xad\n\nbute uniquely to answering some very important questions about Venus\n\n\nitself and evolution of all solid-surface bodies, including Earth.\n\n\n\n2.6\n\nCARTOGRAPHIC AND GRAVITATIONAL MAPPING APPLICATIONS\n\n\nTerrestrial geodetic measurements are in the midst of a\n\n\n\ngreat revolution in their accuracy and the capability to interpret these\n\n\ndata for their geodynamic information content.\n\nThree-dimensional vector\n\n\n\ndifferences between benchmarks which are accurate to the centimeter\n\n\nlevel over intercontinental distances are supplanting classical geodetic\n\n\ntechniques.\n\nSatellite observations of the geoid and gravity field are\n\n\n\nalso rapidly advancing in technology employed and accuracy obtained.\n\n\nThe potential accuracy of these measurements requires the definition of\n\n\nmore stable-reference frames than those defined by the classical crust\xc2\xad\n\nfixed locations of a net of observatories.\ncandidates.\n\nSeveral reference frames are\n\n\n\nSome examples are:\n\n\n1)\n\nthe frame convenient for VLBI observations which is\n\n\ndefined by positions of extragalactic radio sources\n\n\n\n2)\n\ninertial frames dynamically determined by the motion\n\n\nin space of planets, spacecraft, earth satellites, etc.\n\n\n\nThe common feature of these frames is their fundamentally\n\n\nextraterrestrial definition.\n\nThe geodynamic information about the\n\n\n\n2-19\n\n\n\ncomplex internal structure of the Earth to be extracted from these new\n\n\ndata will require sophisticated modelling techniques, and data analysis\n\n\nefforts extending over many years to measure reliably tectonic plate\n \n\nmotions, for example,\n\n\nrevolution is measuring the\n\n\n\nAn exciting\n\ndynamics of the interior and surface of the Earth and the immediate\n\n\napplicability of this developing technology and analysis capability to\n\n\nthe other terrestrial jlanets.\n\nThe extraterrestrial nature of the\n\n\n\ndefining reference frames makes this extension to other planets very\n\n\nnatural.\n\nThe\'largest potential payoff is the depth and breadth of\n\n\n\nunderstanding of geophysics that could be obtained from the comparative\n\n\ngeodynamics between the terrestrial planets.\n \n\nAs each celestial body is mapped with increasingly better\n\n\nresolution, the difficulty of tieing different map segments acquired at\n\n\ndifferent times becomes greater.\n\nMapping uncertainties on Mars after\n \n\n\nMariner 9 in fact resulted in a large percentage of the required size\n\n\nof the Viking landing target ellipses.\n\nThese uncertainties, charac\xc2\xad\n\n\nterized by not knowing the location of a particular surface feature\n\n\n(a dangerous crater for example) in inertial space, placed considerable\n\n\nrestrictions on the landing sites and eliminated sites which might have\n\n\nbeen scientifically more desirable.\n\n\nCartographic control may be established on a body by fixing\n\n\na location on the surface in inertial space (at a particular time) to\n\n\nbetter than the desired mapping accuracy.\n\nFrom this location, all other\n\n\n\nlocations are referenced by offset coordinates.\n\nIn practice, more than\n\n\n\none fixed reference location (or benchmark, as such locations are often\n \n\ncalled on Earth) is required to reduce offset errors propagating over\n\n\nlong distances.\n\nSophisticated techniques such as satellite geodesy may\n\n\n\nthen be applied economically to interrelate a small number of benchmarks\n\n\naround a globe, allowing more economical (and less.accurate) techniques\n\n\nto be applied to mapping the smaller intervening areas to a given level\n\n\nof accuracy determined by the quality of data and instrumentation avail\xc2\xad\n\nable.\n\n\nRadar mapping data acquired by a spacecraft orbiting Venus\n\n\nwill be uncertain in position to the extent that the spacecraft\'s\n\n\n\n2-20\n\n\n\nposition at a particular time is uncertain with respect to the center of\n\n\nVenus.\n\nTracking inaccuracies from Earth, aggravated by gravity field,\n\n\n\natmospheric and solar perturbations to the spacecraft orbit, will limit\n\n\nthe ability to precisely relate one set of data to another. However, if\n\n\nthere are several sharp radar return sources (retroreflectors or trans\xc2\xad\n\nponders) scattered around the globe and appearing in radar maps, then\n\n\nradar returns from objects in their proximity may be located as an off\xc2\xad\n\nset position from the radar source.\n\nBecause of its small size and strong\n\n\n\nsignal, more sophisticated techniques may be used to locate the refer\xc2\xad\n\nence benchmark and in determining the relative locations of several\n\n\nbenchmarks, thereby reducing the uncertainties in knowing the relative\n\n\npositions of all features on the map.\n\n\nSimilar difficulties are encountere& in gravitational map\xc2\xad\n\nping of a body, which is a powerful tool for studying a planet\'s interior.\n\n\nThe Lunar Orbiter and first Apollo missions were plagued by unexpected\n\n\ndeviations from anticipated positions and velocities.\n\nAnalysis of the\n\n\n\ndata coupled with a conceptual model of the mechanism led to the dis\xc2\xad\n\ncovery and confirmation of mascons, or sub-surface regions of density\n\n\nhigher than the normal distribution in spherical shells.\n\nKnowledge of\n\n\n\nthese mascons has since been instrumental in developing theories\n\n\ndescribing the evolution of the Moon to its present state.\n\n\nOther less dramatic, but perhaps more significant inhomo\xc2\xad\n\ngeneities in planetary mass distribution may be mapped by tracking a\n\n\nsatellite\'s path through a planet\'s gravity field in inertial space and\n\n\nin relation to the planet center.\n\nSub-surface intrusions of dense rock\n\n\n\nand non-spherical bulges in the surface may be detected and reveal\n\n\ninformation about past processes occurring in the planet.\n\nComparisons\n\n\n\nmay then be drawn between the terrestrial planets for which this data\n\n\nis available.\n\n\nGravitational mapping accuracy may be improved by having a\n\n\nfixed reference on the planet from which the satellite may frequently\n \n\nreference its position.\n\nSuch a device also helps to relate the gravi\xc2\xad\n\n\ntational map more precisely to the planet center, which is better known\n\n\nby tracking a device fixed on the planet surface.\n\n\n\n2-21\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n2-1\n\nMariner-Venus 1962 Final Project Report, NASA SP-59, 1965.\n\n2-2\n\nMariner-Venus 1967 Final Project Report, NASA SP-190, 1971.\n\n2-3\n\nJames A.

increase the visibility of small targets such\'as\n\n\nboats and buoys and as aids to navigation.\n\nAlthough extending the\n\n\n\nprinciple to interplanetary or deep space targets might seem overly\n\n\nambitious because of the tremendous distances involved, it should be\n\n\nremembered that modern radar astronomy and synthetic aperture imaging\n\n\ntechniques make the detection and measurement of extremely weak signals\n\n\npossible.\n\nFor example, the power returned from a 10 km square area on\n\n\n\nVenus to the Goldstone 64 meter antenna during a typical imaging experi\xc2\xad\n\nment is about 10- 2 2\n watts.\n\nProperly designed passive reflectors or\n\n\n\ntransponders of sufficient cross section or power output should be\n\n\ndetectable by such systems.\n\n\nIn this section we will discuss the measurement of weak\n\n\nsignals and the size of reflectors and transponders necessary to produce\n\n\nthem.\n\nRadar ranging and imaging techniques will be reviewed along with\n\n\n\nthe resolution attainable using currently existing and proposed systems.\n\n\nFor Earth-based observations we will presume the use of the Goldstone\n\n\n64 meter antenna operating at S or X-band, or the Arecibo observatory at\n\n\nS-band.\n\nOrbital radars we will consider are Seasat or VOIR type\n\n\n\nsynthetic aperture imagers.\n\n\n\n3t 1\n\nDETECTABILITY BY EARTH-BASED RADAR\n\n\n\nThere are two questions to be answered in determining the\n\n\ndetectability of a radar target:\n\n(1) does the target return enough\n\n\n\npower to the radar for the signal to be recognizable above the system\n\n\nnoise, and (2) can the return from the target be differentiated from\n\n\nthose caused by nearby or background objects or terrain (clutter)?\n\n\n\n3.2\n\nREFLECTORS IN SPACE\n\n\nTo answer the first question we will assume the target is\n\n\n\nsuspended in space with no nearby objects to create interference, and\n\n\n\n3-1\n\n\n\ncalculate the size necessary for its detection on Earth.\n\nThe result\n\n\n\nwould be applicable to a deep space mission where range information is\n\n\ndesired to detect orbit perturbations, or to a reflector placed on a\n\n\nsmall object such as an asteroid -or one of the Mart-ian satelTites.\n\n\'The\n\n\n\ncalculation involves solving the so-called "radar equation", which\n\n\nrelates the visibility of a target to the parameters of the radar system\n\n\nand the target properties.\n\n\nThe radar\'equation (which also applies to optical frequencies)\n\n\ncan be derived in the following way.\n\nConsider an isotropic radiator\n\n\n\ntransmitting power Pt and illuminating a target at-distance r.\n\nThe power\n\n\n\nP\n\nreceived at the transmission point (monostatic case) per unit area\n\n\nr\nafter being reflected by the target is\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\np\n\nt 2\n\nO 2i\n\n4nr 2\n\nr\n\n47r\n\n2\n\n\nwhere a is the cross section 9f the target and is the projected area of\n\n\na perfectly reflecting sphere which would return the same flux to the\n\n\nreceiver if placed in the same position.\n\nThe transmitting antenna is\n\n\n\nusually not isotropic but has a gain given by\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n4TA\n\nA,\n\n\nwhere A is the transmitting antenna area and X is the wavelength.\n\nIf\n\n\n\nthe receiving antenna also has area A then the radar equation is\n\n\nP\nP\n\na GA\n\nt\n\nr\n\n(3)\n\n22\n\n(4 r\n\n)\n\nTo determine detectability we must compare the received\n\n\npower to the system noise:\n

(see Section 5).\n\nThe peak cross section for\n\n\n\nsuch an object is given by\n\n\n4 a4\n\n-a =\n3X\n\nwhere a is the length of one edge.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\nCorner reflectors are generally\n\n\n\npreferred over other types of artificial target because they can be\n\n\ndetected from almost any angle.\n\nThe incoming ray undergoes a triple\n\n\n\nbounce and returns in the direction of illumination, while maintaining\n\n\nthe phase coherence and polarization of the signal.\nhowever, truly omnidirectional.\n\nThey are not;\n\n\n\nThe detailed angular backscatter\n\n\n\nresponse has been calculated theoretically and verified experimentally\n\n\nmany times and is plotted in Figure 3-1.\n\nNotice that there is a small\n\n\n\nrange of angles where the backscatter is at least 10 dB (factor of 10)\n\n\ndown from its peak, so if the radar happens to be located in one of\n\n\nthese nulls detection of the reflector might be prevented.\n\nThis problem\n\n\n\nwould be minimized if the reflector is located on a planetary surface\n\n\nsince, over time, observations would be made through a range of angles.\n\n\nIf the reflector were in space it could be spun at some rate, although\n\n\n\n3-4\n\n\n\nthis would introduce a modulation that would have to be accounted for in\n\n\nthe data processing.\n \n\nSubstituting (8) into (7),\n\nwith the appropriate observing\n \n\n\ntimes (4 hours for Goldstone, 1 hour for Arecibo) we find the reflector\n\n\nsize necessary for detection to be\n\n\n\na\n\n=\n\n8\n\nr 7/ -

3-2.\n\n\nIf the reflector is located in space an additional complica\xc2\xad\n\ntion is provided by the relative motion of the radar and target.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nchange in range during the observation can be eliminated during the data\n \n\nprocessing since it will be known approximately, but the difference in\n\n\nvelocities perpendicular to the line of sight might catry the Earth\n \n\nout of the reflector beam during the round trip transit time of the\n\n\nsignal.\n\nFor the receiver to remain in the beam of a reflector in the\n\n\n\nouter solar system for the round trip time the Earth\'s projected velo\xc2\xad\n\ncity time TRT must be less than half the beamwidth times the distance:\n\n\n\nV\n\n2r < Xr\np c - 2a\n\nor,\n\n\n\na\n\nXc\n\n\n\n4V\np\n\n\n\n3-5\n\n\n\nwhere c = the speed of light, and Vp is the orbital speed V e of the\n\n\nEarth (30 km/sec) projected onto a perpendicular to the Sun-reflector\n\n\nline.\n\nIf we let\n\n\n\nV\n\nwhere\n\ne=\n\np\n\n=\n\nV\n\ne\n\ncos O\n\nthe angle reflector-Sun-Earth, and substitute the appropriate\n\n\n\nvalues, we get\n\n\n\na!\n\n2500 X\nCos\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\nFor example, Figure 3-2 shows that at S-band at 40 AU a 1400 meter\n\n\nreflector is necessary.\n\nFrom (10) this implies\n\ne=\n\n77.10, or about\n\n\n\n26 days every 6 months when observations can be made.\n\nFor X-band this\n\n\n\ndecreases to 9 days.\n\n\n\n3.2.2\n\nOther Reflectors\n\n\nIn addition to trihedral corners, several other suggestions\n\n\n\nfor passive reflectors in space have been investigated.\n\nThese include\n\n\n\narrays of resonant dipoles printed on wires and stabilized by rotation,\n \n\nand large sheets of reflective material stabilized and oriented toward\n\n\nthe Earth or Sun by various combinations of rotation and radiation\n\n\npressure.\n\nIn all cases these proved to be necessarily too large (the\n\n\n\ncorner reflector is apparently the brightest passive target for a given\n\n\namount of payload), and as a result suffered from even more stringent\n\n\nbeamwidth restrictions.\n\n\nSince the cross section of the corner reflector is inversely\n\n\nproportional to the square of the wavelength, the use of optical systems\n\n\nwas also considered.\n\nEquations (1) through (3) apply to visible wave\xc2\xad\n\n\nlengths, so the power output of a laser necessary to illuminate a\n\n\nLageos-type array of large optical cubes was calculated assuming that\n\n\nthe return signal was being observed with a 2.4 meter telescope and the\n\n\nmost sensitive currently available photometer.\n\n3-6\n\n\n\nThe results indicated\n\n\n\nthat a pulsed laser with peak power output of several tens of megawatts\n\n\nwould be sufficient for a reflector at 50 AU, if the considerable atmo\xc2\xad\n\nspheric problems could be eliminated.\n\nThese power levels are not out of\n\n\n\nthe question for weapon-type lasers that will probably be built in the\n\n\nnear future.\n\nThe relative motion problem, however, remains.\n\nThe same\n\n\n\nsize-to-wavelength factor responsible for the large cross section of\n\n\noptical reflectors also implies an extremely narrow beamwidth.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nEarth rapidly moves out of the return beam even at moderate distance and\n\n\nthere is apparently no solution to this dilemma.\n\nSlight defocusing of\n\n\n\nthe reflectors was considered but this lowered the cross section and\n\n\ntherefore increased the laser power necessary to unacceptably high\n\n\nlevels.\n\n\n\n3.2.3\n\nTransponders\n\n\nOne way to keep the size and weight of a radar benchmark\n\ndown is to relax slightly the requirement that it be totally passive.\n\nA\n\ntransponder that repeats a code transmitted from the Earth, or even a\nsimple transmitter that generates its own code has several advantages\nover totally passive reflectors.\n\nFirst of all, the radar equation for\n\nan isotropically radiating transmitter in space being detected from the\nEarth is\n\np\n\nr\n\n_\n\nPA\n\n\nt\n4g2\n\nwhere the terms are all defined as previously.\n\n(11)\n\nIn this case Pt is the\'\n\n\n\npower transmitted by the transponder, not from the Earth.\napparent that the r\n\n-2 \n\n\ninstead of r\n\n-4\n\nIt should be\n\n\n\ndistance dependence will lessen the\n\n\n\npower requirements considerably.\n \n\nIf we assume that the device is generating its own phase\n\n\ncoded continuous wave (CW) signal (or that it is\' keying it to one pre\xc2\xad\n\nviously received from the Earth), the round trip time is not a factor\n\n\nand the signal-to-noise ratio can be written\n \n\n\n3-7\n\n\n\nSNR\n\nwhere T\n\nP r Tobs\nKT\n\n(12)\n\nis now about 8 hours for Goldstone and 2 hours for Arecibo,\n\n\n\nand T must now include the noise temperature of the transmitter (300\n\nK).\n\n\n\ncombining (11) and (12) along with (5), we find the power necessary for\n\n\nthe benchmark to transmit:\n\n\n\nPt\n\nSubstituting from Table 3-1, we find, for SNR\n\nPt\n\n(13)\n\n\n16r2 \n\nd2 KT SNR\nTobs\n\n\n\nCtr r2 (AU) watts\n\n=\n\n10:\n\n(14)\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n=\n\n4\n2.94 x 10-\n Goldstone X-band\n\n\n\n=\n\n2.11 x 10- 4\n Goldstone

to be\n\n\ndetectable from 50 AU!\n\n\nThe only drawback to this method is that the range accuracy\n\n\nis ultimately a function of the stability of the oscillator, both over\n\n\nthe transmission time and over the length of the mission. \n The first of\n\nthese is probably not a problem since oscillators are commercially\n\n\none part in 10 1 over periods of tens\n\navailable today that are stable to \n\nThis is sufficient to allow range measurements with accuracies\n\n\neven hundreds of meters, adequate for detecting grav-i\xc2\xad\n\nof kilometers or \n\ntational perturbations in the outer solar system. \n The second problem\n\nof hours.\n\ncan be solved by having the transponder perform the same sort of process\n\n\nwe would on the Earth, i.e., cross correlate the incoming signal (let us\n\n\n\n3-8\n\n\n\nsay a very long pseudo-random code) with a code generated internally\n\n\nthereby synthesizing a very narrow pulse, and beginning transmission of\n\n\nits own signal with some preset time following the reception of this\n\n\npulse.\n\n\nThis type of transponder can be a quite simple device.\n\nIt\n\n\n\nrequires a very small antenna (a wire of some sort of simple array) and\n\n\nneed not be oriented so no control system is necessary.\n\nThe transmitted\n\npower required is so low -(<1 watt) that currently available long-life\npower sources like RTGs could keep them operating for the scores of\nyears necessary for a deep-space mission.\n\n3.3\n\nREFLECTORS ON PLANETARY SURFACES\n\n\nFor a benchmark located on a planetary surface the problem\n\n\n\nof differentiating the radar echo from the reflector from those caused\n \n\nby nearby objects and surrounding terrain becomes dominant.\n\nTo be\n\n\n\ndetectable the cross section of the reflector must be some factor f\n\n\nlarger than the cross section\n\n0\n\nf\n\ncell of neighboring cells:\n\n\n\na\n\n(15)\n\ncell\n\n\n\nThus, detectability is determined only by the resolution of the radar,\n\n\nwhether it be orbital or Earth-based.\n\n\nThe reflectivity of terrain is usually described by a\n\n\n"normalized cross section" u0, or radar cross section per unit area.\n\n\nThis quantity varies widely with terrain type and incidence angle (angle\n\n\nbetween a ray from the radar and the normal to the surface).\n\nFigure 3-4\n\n\n\nshows a0 in dB as a function of incidence angle for several terrain\n\n\ntypes measured on the Earth, and two curves derived for the average\n\n\nreturns from Venus.\n\nSince the reflectivity of terrain has a strong\n\n\n\nangular dependence and that of a corner reflector has very little, it\n\n\nis clearly best to try to observe at as high an incidence angle as\n\n\npossible.\n\n\n\n3-9\n\n\n\nFrom the definition above, cross section of a resolution\n\n\ncell is a0 for the appropriate terrain type times the area of a cell:\n\n\n\nacell\n\n=\n\nU0 L2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere L = surface radar resolution.\n\n\n\n3.3.1\n\nCorner

plotted in\n\n\n\nFigures 3-5 and 3-6 as a function of resolution for these two wavelengths\n\n\nfor several values of f.\n\nFor these plots a0 has been assumed equal to\n\n\n\n-15 dB, an average value for Venus at an incidence angle of about 400.\n\n\nIf the reflector is placed into a "radar dark" area, determined for\n\n\nexample from previous Earth-based images,\n\ny could be as much as -30 dB.\n\n\n0\n\nFigure 3-7 shows a synthetic aperture radar image of a num\xc2\xad\n\nber of corner reflectors set out in a cross pattern on Goldstone Dry\n\n\nLake in the Mojave Desert.\n\nThe image was obtained with the JPL L-band\n\n\n\nimaging radar, which is flown on board the NASA Convair 990.\n\nThis\n\n\n\ninstrument operates at a wavelength of 25 cm with a resolution of\n\n\n25 meters, and the reflectors have a equal to about 1.83 meters.\n\'fore, from Equation (17),\nthe background if it has\nincidence angles.\n\nThere\xc2\xad\n\n\nthey should appear about 15.8 dB brighter than\n\no\n\n=\n\n-15 dB, a typical value for desert at these\n\nThe reflectors do not appear quite that bright, in the\n\nimage, so it is suspected that either (1) the radar was operating at\n\n\nreduced resolution, or (2) subsurface moisture created a dielectrically\n\n\n\n3-10\n\n\n\nrough interface several tens of cm below the playa surface, which raised\n\n\na0 to approximately 10 dB (the image was obtained during the summer\n\n\nfollowing an unusually rainy spring).\n\nThis reiterates the importance\n\n\n\nof the background scattering in detection of a benchmark.\n\n\n\n3.3.2\n\nTransponders\n\n\nThe problem of differentiating the benchmark from background\n\n\n\nreflections can be solved quite nicely by use of a transponder radiating\n\n\na signal at a slightly different wavelength than the illuminating radar.\n\n\nIn this case the background is very low and the transmitted power\n\n\nnecessary is the same as that given in Figure 3-3.\n\nA more detailed\n\n\n\ntreatment of the operation of a transponder in the harsh Venus environ\xc2\xad\n\nment is given in Section 4.\n\n\n\n3.4\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that\n\n\n\nfor most applications totally-passive radar reflectors are unsatisfactory\n\n\nas benchmarks for Earth-based observations.\n\nFor deep space missions,\n\n\n\nreflectors with dimensions of several hundred meters are required\n\n\n(Figure 3-2), while for planetary surfaces 10 meters would just suffice\n\n\nto make the benchmark visible against the background (Figures 3-5 and\n\n\n3-6).\n\nSmaller passive benchmarks, visible to orbiting radar, appear to\n\n\n\nbe viable in the near future.\n\n\nGreat savings in weight and complexity can be realized,\n\n\nhowever, by the use of simple transponders.\n\nFigure 3-3 shows that the\n\n\n\ntransmitted power required from the transponders is extremely modest in\n\n\nall cases, well within the capabilities of modern equipment.\n\nIn addi\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion, no orientation or antenna pointing is required, eliminating the\n\n\nneed for a control system.\n\nIt is concluded here from detectability and\n\n\n\naccuracy considerations that if they can be constructed to withstand\n\n\nthe expected severe environmental conditions and to have lifetimes\n\n\nsufficient for measurements of planetological significance, transpon\xc2\xad\n\nders are greatly preferred over any kind of passive reflector.\n\n\n\n3-11\n\n\n\n5\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nCROSS SECTION OF TRIANGULAR\nCORNER

This image demonstrates the\n\n\nimportance of placing passive reflectors in "radar dark" surroundings.\n\n\n\nOccultation data from Mariners 5 and 10 give information on\n\n\nthe turbulence in the Venusian atmosphere above 40 km.\n\nUnfortunately\n\n\n\nmore than 90% of the atmosphere lies below-this -level, and its effect is\n\n\nunknown except to the extentthat ground based radar astronomy has suc\xc2\xad\n\ncessfully achieved lineal resolutions on the order of 4 km.\n\n\nAlso not so obvious is the use of a simple radio repeater\n\n\nto determine the rotation rate and spin axis of the planet.\n\nThe proce\xc2\xad\n\n\ndure for such a determination is well known and has been applied to\n\n\ndelay-Doppler signatures of a number of small radar features presumed to\n\n\nbe fixed to the surface of the planet.\n\nThe repeater simply acts as a\n\n\n\npoint feature permitting delay and Doppler signatures to be measured\n\n\nseveral orders of magnitude more accurately than possible with the\n\n\nintrinsic features.\n\nEven a short span of data (a few months) from two\n \n\n\nor three properly placed repeaters can yield a determination of the pole\n\n\nand rotation rate between two and three orders of magnitude better than\n\n\npresently possible from the totality of ground-based radar data.if high\n\n\nresolution ranging can be incorporated.\n\nThe point source repeaters also\n\n\n\navoid certain systematic errors that are introduced in the radar feature\n \n\ndata caused by the apparent shift of the location of the maximum reflec\xc2\xad\n\ntion as the angle of incidence changes.\n\nThe accurate measurement of the\n\n\n\nrotation rate and direction of the Venusian pole seems to have diverse\n\n\nimplications with respect to everything from the planet\'s internal struc\xc2\xad\n\nture to the mass of Pluto.\n\nThe atmospheric turbulence, on the other\n\n\n\nhand, places limits on a.number of scientific experiments including the\n\n\nmeasurement of the pole direction and rotation rate and the ultimate\n\n\nresolution of synthetic aperture radars (SAR\'s).\n\n\n\n4.2\n\nSCOPE OF STUDY\n\n\nThis study is primarily concerned with the state of. tech\xc2\xad\n\n\nnology applicable to electronics and support systems that could operate\n\n\nat the environmental temperature of Venus.\n\nAlso considered are the\n\n\n\nground based station capability and a highly preliminary design for a\n\n\nsimple continuous wave (C.W.) repeater.- The designs of telemetry sys\xc2\xad\n\ntems and other atmospheric measuring devices are not considered.\n\n4-2\n\n\n\nAreas\n\n\n\nwhere certain technological advances are required or where critical\n \n\ndesign data are unknown are isolated and discussed.\n\nThe remainder of\n\n\n\nthe section is broken into major system subsections and supporting\n\n\ntechnological subsections.\n\n\n\n4.3\n\nUP-LINK REQUIREMENTS\n \n\nThe complexity or simplicity of a radio repeater is primarily\n\n\n\ncontrolled by the signal strength that can be delivered to its receiving\n\n\nantenna.\n\nIn its simplest form the repeater is a passive reflector, but\n\n\n\nbecause the signal strength returned to the observer decreases by the\n\n\nreciprocal of the 4th power of distance, it is often impractical to use\n\n\nsuch a simple repeater.\n\nAn active radio repeater, on the other hand, is\n\n\n\nbroken into two independent paths such that the path loss increases only\n\n\nas the 2nd power of distance, and active amplification is introduced in\n\n\nthe center of the link.\n\nThe up-link portion of the system turns out to\n\n\n\nbe the most demanding half of the loop for a simple C.W. repeater.\n\n\nThe up-link difficulties are partially caused by a strong\n\n\ndesire to keep the system simple.\n\nThe electronics and servomotors\n\n\n\nrequired in pointing a high gain antenna system seem unnecessarily com\xc2\xad\n\nplicated; therefore, a simple omnidirectional antenna appears to be the\n\n\nonly choice.\n\nAlso, the up-link receiver cannot be designed with the low\n\n\n\nnoise technology used in the ground stations.\n0\n\ntemperature may be as high as 10,000 K.\n\nThe effective receiver\n \n\n\nA further limitation is imposed\n\n\n\nby the stability of any local oscillator that may be required in the\n\n\nreceiver.\n\nThat is, wider bandwidths may be required in the receiver sys\xc2\xad\n\n\ntem in order to tolerate the long term drifts of the local oscillators.\n\n\nThe feasibility of the repeater and its ability to meet the\n\n\nscience objectives are highly dependent upon the signal to noise ratio\n\n\nthat can be achieved prior to the final frequency conversion.\n\nThe spec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntral purity of the retransmitted signal depends upon the signal to noise\n\n\nratio, and this is ultimately dependent upon the stability of the various\n\n\nlocal oscillators.\n\nTherefore, we approach the problem in reverse and ask\n\n\n\nwhat signal to noise ratio is required and what stability does it imply.\n\n\nThe receiving antenna of the repeater is assumed to be a\n\n\nsimple crossed dipole device with gain between 1 and 2 depending upon\n\n\n\n4-3\n\n\n\nits orientation.\n\nThe power received by such an antenna is given by\n\nEq. (1),\nPT 6 T A\n\nPR\n\nR T47r-D 2\n4\n\nwatts,\n\ni\n\nwhere\n\n\nPT\n\nis the power transmitted in watts;\n\n\n\nGT \t\n\nis the antenna gain of the transmitting antenna rela\xc2\xad\n\ntive to an isotropic radiator;\n\n\n\nAR \t\n\nis the effective collecting area of the receiving\n\n\nantenna in meters squared;\n\n\n\nD \t\n\nis the path distance in meters.\n\n\n\nD varies from 0.3 to 1.7 A..U. for Venus.\n\nSince it might be desirable to\n\n\n\nuse the repeater at all times, both limits are considered in Table 4-1.\n\n\nTable 4-1 shows the critical parameters of the up-link transmission path\n\n\nfor several ground based transmitting facilities.\n\nThe Arecibo radar at\n\n\n\nS-Band can deliver the largest flux density to the surface of Venus and\n\n\nwould be ideal for Doppler frequency measurements if the tracking time\n\n\nwere not so short.\n\nThe Goldstone radar at X-Band is next best, however,.\n \n\n\nthe collecting area of an omnidirectional receiving antenna is very\n\n\nsmall, and an X-Band receiver is more difficult to design. Also, atmo\xc2\xad\n\nspheric absorption will decrease the signal strength greatly as the path\n\n\nlength through the atmosphere increases.\n\nThe power density of the Gold\xc2\xad\n\n\nstone S-Band system is only a factor of 10 smaller than the Arecibo sys\xc2\xad\n\ntem and if the receiver bandwidth can be reduced, either system could be\n\n\nused.\n\n\nTable \t\n4-1 also contains a few parameters not shown explicitly\n\n\nin Eq.

This would correspond to a few tenths of a Hertz\n\n\nparts in 10\nper day at S-Band.\n\nHere again only a fairly small bandwidth is required\n\n\n\nif the operational life-time is on the order of a year or two.\n\nIt is not\n\n\n\nexpected that a quartz crystal operating at 450\'C will have a stability\n\n\nthat comes close to those of crystals operating near room temperature.\n\n\nTherefore, the signal to noise ratio that may be achieved depends upon\n\n\nthe receiver design and any tricks that can-be used to provide immunity\n\n\nto drifts in the local oscillators.\n\nThe next section considers a few\n\n\n\nsimple receivers that are immune to drifts in the local oscillators.\n\n\nIn order to get some feel for the P1 and P 2 values of Table\n\n\n4-1, one may consider a typical vacuum tube receiver having an expective\n\n\ninput temperature of 10,000\xc2\xb0K and a bandwidth of 104 Hertz.\n\nThe effec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntive noise power is given by PN= k TB where k is Boltzmann\'s constant\n\n\n(1.38 x 10- 2 3 watts/0 K).\n\nThe noise power is then about 1.38 x 10 15\n\n\n\nwatts and provides reasonable signal to noise ratios for some of the\n\n\nreceived powers shown in Table 4-1.\n\n\n\n4-6\n\n\n\nIf the repeater is not to expend its transmitting power on\n\n\nnoise, it is clear that some improvement is necessary if the repeater is\n\n\nto be used at the greatest distance with the Goldstone Antenna System\n\n\nat S-Band.\n\n\n\n4.4\n\nDOWN-LINK REQUIREMENTS\n\n\nThe basic dbwnlink requirement is only that an adequate sig\xc2\xad\n\n\nnal to noise ratio be present at the ground station to permit high reso\xc2\xad\n\nlution spectral analysis.\n\nSince the broadening of the spectral line is\n\n\n\nknown to be less than 0.01 Hz from previous radar observations, we can\n\n\npresume that the predetection bandwidth of 0.01 Hz is entirely possible\n\n\nand design the transmitter for adequate detectability.\n\nAgain the power\n\n\n\nreceived by the ground station is given by Eq. (1) where PT is the trans\xc2\xad\n\nmitted power from the lander, GT its antenna gain, and AR is the collect\xc2\xad\n\ning area of the ground station.\n\nIf we presume a 1 watt transmitter and\n\n\n\nthe receiver temperatures as tabulated, the resulting signal to noise\n\n\nratios are shown for inferior and superior conjunctions of the planet\n\n\nfor each receiving station.\n\nObviously there is no problem in detecting\n\n\n\nthe signal, and transmitter power requirement could be relaxed.\n\nBistatic\n\n\n\noperation is clearly possible, for example, it would be desirable for\n\n\nthe Arecibo radar to transmit and Goldstone radar to receive in order to\n\n\nobtain a continuous 2.5 hour C.W. data span for high spectral resolution.\n\n\nLarger continuous time spans are possible if the Goldstone antennas are\n\n\nA smaller antenna (26 m diameter) would be\n\n\n\nused in a bistatic system.\nadequate on the downlink.\n\n\n\n4.5\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION RANGING\n\n\nThe previous section considered the design of a simple CW\n\n\n\nrepeater or transponder.\n\nAlthough valuable scientific objectives can be\n\n\n\nmet with such a device, the ability to repeat a wideband signal has a\n\n\ndefinite advantage in that high resolution ranging becomes possible.\n\n\nPresent day transponders designed for deep space ranging utilize band\xc2\xad\n\nwidths as large as several megahertz.\n\nTherefore, consider a modified\n\n\n\n4-7\n\n\n\ntransponder for Venus having a bandwidth of about 2 MHz.\n\nThe wider\n\n\n\nbandwidth has the advantage that it simplifies the design of the I.F.\n\n\namplifiers and relaxes the stability required of the passive components.\n\n\n-\n\n.\n\n- In -the -simpte C.W. repeaher, the design was such as to\n\nattempt to maintain a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio so as to\n\n\ndevote most of the transmitter\'s power to sending the signal rather than\n\n\nthe noise.\n\nThis was accomplished by making the IF bandwidth narrow\n\n\n\nenough to reject most of the noise power; however, it is not necessary\n\n\nto do so.\n\nThe signal to noise ratio is so good on the down link that the\n\n\n\ntransmitter power could be reduced by a factor of 103, therefore, the\n\n\ntransmitter could just as well transmit 0.999 watts of noise and 1 milli\xc2\xad\n\nwatt of signal (see Table 4-2).\n\nCalculation of the uplink signal to\n\n\nnoise ratio for a bandwidth of 2 MHz, and a receiver temperature of l04\n\n\ndegrees K can be found by using the parameters in Table 4-1.\n-13 \n\n\npower, kTB, is 2.76 x10\n\nwatts.\n\nThe noise\n\n\n\nThus the noise power is about one half\n\n\n\nof the signal power obtained by using the Arecibo system at S-Band when\n\n\nVenus is close.\n\nThe worst case to be considered might be to use the\n\n\n\nGoldstone system at S-Band with Venus at the greatest distance.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nsignal to noise ratio would be 0.0058, and would mean that about 5.8\n\n\nmilliwatts of signal power would be radiated.\n\nThe question of Thich\n\n\n\npart of the loop controls the final signal to noise density can now be\n\n\ndetermined.\n\nSince both paths contain the same distance, the only con\xc2\xad\n\n\nsideration is the quantity (P\n\nT AR)/TR for each path.\n\nIn this case,\n\n\n\nbecause the narrow bandwidth of the ground station is not being con\xc2\xad\n\nsidered, the up link signal to noise density is much greater than that\n\n\nof the downlink.\n\nThen, from the standpoint of analysis, it is only\n\n\n\nnecessary to consider the experiment as a 5 milliwatt transmitter send\xc2\xad\n\ning to the ground station, i,e., the uplink noise density contribution\n\n\ncan be ignored.\n \n\nAt this point it is necessary to consider the range encoding\n\n\nand decoding process.\n\nWhatever system is used, it is essential that it\n\n\n\ndoes not eliminate all of the carrier component.\n\nSome part of the\n\n\n\ncarrier is required to operate the phase-locked-loop in order to effect\n\n\n\n4-8\n\n\n\nTable 4-2.\n\nUplink Band\n\nDownlink Detectability for a 1 watt Transmitter with a 0.01 Hz Bandwidth for Distances\n\n\nof 0.3 and

produce an exact phase coherent\n\n\n\ncopy of the incoming signal translated in frequency.\n\nThe design of such\n\n\n\na repeater is--generallynot possible due to frequency drifts and phase\n\n\nfluctuations of various local oscillators used in the heterodyne process\n\n\nrequired to effect the frequency translation.\n\nPhase coherence can be\n\n\n\nachieved by phase locking the master oscillator or clock to the incoming\n\n\nsignal.\n\nThe frequency translation is then in an exact ratio of the incom\xc2\xad\n\n\ning signal, but phase jitter will remain and appears as a spectral\n\n\nbroadening of the repeated frequency.\n\nIn a properly designed phase lock\n\n\n\nreceiver the phase noise or jitter can generally be held approximately\n\n\nto that inherent in the master oscillator or clock.\n\nThe master oscilla\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor is presumed to be voltage controllable such that a feedback signal\n\n\nfrom a phase comparator can force the frequency to be exactly that\n\n\nrequired to maintain phase lock.\nloops (PLL\'s).\n\nSuch systems are called phase locked\n\n\n\nUnder conditions of high signal to noise ratio, an ideal\n \n\n\nfirst order PLL has a variance of the phase noise given by\n\n\n\n2\n\nNO BL\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nwhere N\n\nis the spectral density of the assumed white noise, BL is the\n \n\n\nloop bandwidth, and A is the amplitude of the sinusoidal input signal\n\n\n(Ref. 4-2).\n\nIf both the incoming signal and the oscillator being locked\n\n\n\nare stable, BL may be made as narrow as desired, however, phase noise\n\n\non either the incoming signal or the local oscillator require BL to be\n\n\non the order of the bandwidth of the incoming signal or the bandwidth\n\n\nof the local oscillator whichever is the largest.\n\n\nPhase jitter in the incoming signal may be caused by the\n\n\natmospheric turbulence and is one of the quantities to be measured.\n\n\nPhase noise inherent in the master oscillator can\'be thought of as a\n\n\ncontamination signal applied to an ideal master oscillator.\n\nThe design\n\n\n\ngoal hopefully would be to make the phase noise of the master oscillator\n\n\nsignificantly smaller than that produced by the turbulence.\n\n4-12\n\n\n\nThe loop\n\n\n\nbandwidth, BL\' would have to be determined automatically, since the\n\n\nspectral spreading caused by the turbulence is an a priori unknown and\n\n\npresumably variable.\n\nThe signal to noise ratio is also variable.\n\n\n\nThe question of whether or not an adequate master oscillator\n \n\nor clock can be designed to operate at 7-50 0 K is perhaps one of the least\n\n\nwell answered questions of this study and is one of the primary areas\n\n\nrequiring research.\n\nIt would seem unlikely that any of the complicated\n\n\n\natomic frequency references could be made to operate at 750\'K without a\n\n\nmassive research effort.\n\nSimplicity of design is also a paramount fac\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor for any system exposed to new and difficult environments.\n\nThe simpli\xc2\xad\n\n\ncity of the quartz crystal oscillator seems ideally suited to this appli\xc2\xad\n\ncation if adequate stability can be achieved.\n\nUnfortunately, little is\n\n\n\nknown about the operation of quartz crystal oscillators at high tempera\xc2\xad\n\ntures.\n\nQuartz crystals change from a to\n\nquartz at 543 0 C; this is\n\n\n\nsufficiently above the Venusian ambient temperature that no problem is\n\n\nexpected.\n\nAnother property of quartz called "twinning" also renders the\n\n\n\ncrystal inoperative if the rate of temperature increase is greater than\n\n\nabout 500 C per minute.\nexpected.\n\nAgain such rapid temperature changes are not\n\n\n\nThe question of what long term stability and what short term\n\n\n\nphase noise may be expected at 750 0 K is not known.\n\nThe temperature\n\n\n\nsensitivity is expected to be in the order of 1 part in 105 per degree\n\n\ncentigrade.\n\nThis is sufficiently poor that the bandwidth of the receiver\n\n\n\nmay have to be as broad as 50 kHz just to contain the drifts due to tem\xc2\xad\n\nperature.\n\nFortunately, the temperature variation at the surface of Venus\n\n\n\nis believed to be fairly stable, perhaps as small as a few degrees cen\xc2\xad\n\ntigrade.\n\nThis still would cause rather large drifts in frequency, and\n\n\n\nif the local oscillator can be made no better than this, severe diffi\xc2\xad\n\nculties exist in designing phase locked loops capable of frequency track\xc2\xad\n\ning while maintaining high spectral purity.\n\n\nReceivers can be designed to be relatively immune to the\n\n\ndrifts in the local oscillators.\n\nThere are certain drawbacks to each\n\n\n\ndesign, however, the use of a combination of several techniques may\n\n\ngive an adequate design.\n\n\n\n4-13\n\n\n\nFigure 4-la shows a simple superheterodyne receiver which\n\n\nconverts the incoming signal to a lower intermediate frequency-where it\n\n\nis filtered.\n\nThe signal is then converted up to the original signal fre\xc2\xad\n\n\nquency by the same local oscillator.\n\nThe major difficu-l-ty-of this design\n\n\n\nis obtaining adequate isolation from the input to output so as to prevent\n\n\nfeedback.\nwell.\n\nAn oscillation path exists through the local oscillator as\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of this procedure is that all drifts and phase\n\n\n\nnoise inherent in the-local oscillator are cancelled out in the second\n\n\nconversion mixer as long as the bandwidth of the first IF amplifier is\n\n\nwide enough to pass the spectrum of the local oscillator.\n\nThis proce\xc2\xad\n\n\ndure can be applied to double and triple conversion systems.\n\n\nA simple repeater can be formed by following the amplifier\n\n\nwith a frequency multiplier, as shown in Figure 4-lb.\n\nA square law\n\n\n\ndevice followed by an amplifier tuned to two times f\n\nis all that is\n\n\n\nrequired.\n\nThe signal to noise ratio of the output signal remains the\n\n\n\nsame as the input signal in the high signal to noise case.\n\nThus, there\n\n\n\nis no significant reduction of the signal to noise ratio in such a trans\xc2\xad\n\nponder, and its main drawback is the large isolation required to pre\xc2\xad\n\nvent feedback.\n \n\nIn order to prevent internal feedback it is advantageous to\n\n\nobtain the required amplification at several different frequencies and\n\n\nnot convert up to the original signal frequency.\n\nThis can be accomplished\n\n\n\nby a phase locked offset oscillator that generates an apparent local\n\n\noscillator at a frequency of f0 + fl/n as shown in Figure 4-2.\n\nAs n is\n\n\n\nmade large the output frequency, f3\' approaches fI making it more diffi\xc2\xad\n\ncult for the R.F. amplifiers to separate the upper and lower sidebands\n\n\nfollowing mixers 2 and 3.\n\nThe advantage is that the spectral width of\n\n\n\nthe offset oscillator decreases as 1/n at the VCO.\n\nIf phase lock is\n\n\n\nobtained,.the phase differences at the comparator-must be less than +900.\n\n\nThe phase variation of the VCO must be less by a ratio of 1/n, and that\n\n\nphase noise is reflected directly at the output.\n\nThe system shown in\n\n\n\nFigure 4-2 is also immune to variations in the free-running local oscil\xc2\xad\n\nlator provided that the heterodyned sigqal from Mixer 1 does not drift\n\n\nout of the IF amplifier passband.\n\n\n\n4-14\n\n\n\nGiven an adequately stable local oscillator, it should be\n\n\npossible to design a full phase locked receiver.\n\nIn such a receiver a\n\n\n\nvoltage controlled master oscillator is used to drive a phase locked\n \n\nfrequency synthesizer which generates all local oscillator frequencies\n \n\nand the offset reference frequency.\n\nThe analysis of such a system is\n\n\n\nbeyond the scope of this initial study, but most likely is the form of\n\n\nrepeater that will be required.\n\nAgain it is possible to design all con\xc2\xad\n\n\nversion stages such that the phase noise cancels except where offset\n \n\nfrequencies are generated.\n\n\n\n4.7\n\nTHERMIONIC ACTIVE DEVICES\n\n\nThe need for high temperature electronic devices has been\n \n\n\napparent ever since the first germanium transistors appeared on the mar\xc2\xad\n\nket in the late 1950\'s.\n\nThe thermal instability of these devices com\xc2\xad\n\n\npletely changed electronic design procedures in a few short years.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nwider energy band gap of silicon soon offered a solution to operation up\n\n\nto about 200\'C, however, applications in space and geophysics existed for\xc2\xad\n\ndevices operating at even higher environmental temperature.\n\nAttempts to\n\n\n\nproduce semiconductors with higher band gap energies than silicon have\n\n\nnot been very successful, and the amount of effort required to advance\n\n\nthis technology appears to be fairly large.\n\n\nBecause of the difficulties in the area of high temperature\n\n\nsemiconductors, one is soon driven to consider what can be done with the\n\n\nhighly developed thermionic devices of the late 1950\'s.\n\nIn particular\n\n\n\nspecification sheets appeared from General Electric Company advertising\n\n\nsmall ceramic triodes designed to operate at the cathode temperature of\n\n\n750\'C.\n\nThese devices have been used in industry to handle a number of\n\n\n\nhigh temperature instrumentation applications.\n\nThe original intent of\n\n\n\nthe manufacturer was directed more toward UHF radio applications where\n\n\nvery close spaced planar elements were required to reach frequencies up\n\n\nto X-Band.\n\n\nThe only major drawback of these triodes is the energy\n\n\nrequired to increase the cathode temperature from the Venusian ambient\n\n\nof 750\'K to the temperature required for proper operation of the\n\n\n\n4-15\n\n\n\nthermionic cathode which is near 1000 0 K.\n\nLower cathode temperatures\n \n\n\ngreatly reduce the cathode current density.\n\nThe current density gener\xc2\xad\n\n\nated by a thermionic cathode is given by\n\n\nJ = 120 x 104 T2\n\n-11,600 Ew/T amps/m2\n\nwhere Ew is the work function of the cathode (Ref. 4-3).\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nThese ceramic\n\n\n\ntriodes employ an oxide cathode having a work function of about 1.0 e.v.\n\n\nOperation of the cathode at 750\'K would reduce the available current\n\n\ndensity by nearly a factor of 100, and proper space charge limited opera\xc2\xad\n\ntion would not be possible.\n\nThe power required to raise the cathode to\n\n\n\n1000\'K from room temperature is about 1.5 watt.\n\nApproximately 1.03 watts\n\n\n\nwould be required to raise the temperature from 750\'K to 1000 0 K if the\n\n\nheat losses are primarily radiative.\n\nThe high ambient temperature of\n\n\n\nthe surface of Venus is not a great help unless a cathode of lover work\n\n\nfunction can be manufactured.\n\n\nMore recently, McCormick and others at Los Alamos Laboratory\n\n\nhave developed integrated\'thermionic circuits, ITC\'s, by extending earlier\n\n\nwork by Geppert, Dore, anh Mueller at Stanford which was reported in 1969\n\n\nand 1971 (Refs. 4-4 ... 4-6).\n\nThese circuits are produced by a photo\xc2\xad\n\n\nlithographic process much in the same manner as the semiconductor inte\xc2\xad\n\ngrated circuits.\n\nA cathode and grid structure is deposited on a sapphire\n\n\n\nsubstrate in an interlaced zig-zag geometry.\n\nA second anode structure is\n\n\n\nsupported above the cathode-grid structure by separators, and the region\n \n\nbetween is evacuated.\n\nThe sapphire substrate is operated at a temperature\n\n\n\nbetween 6500 and 750\xc2\xb0C.\n\nExperimental line drivers and thermocouple\n\n\n\namplifiers have been designed using this technology for applications in\n\n\ngeothermal energy exploration.\n\nThe present research is aimed at develop\xc2\xad\n\n\ning an adequate package and socket system for the ITC\'s.\n\nIt appears these\n\n\n\ndevices will be very useful for low frequency applications such as phase\xc2\xad\n\nlocked-loops and active filter elements that may be required in the\n \n\nrepeaters or especially for instrumentation associated.with weather sen\xc2\xad\n\nsors and telemetry amplifiers.\n\n\n\n4716\n\n\n\n4.8\n\nLANDER POWER SYSTEM\n\n\nThe design of a high temperature power system is not without\n\n\n\nsome problems, however, it is presently believed that adequate information\n\n\nis available to design a power system that could remain operative for\n\n\nseveral years.\n\nThe heart of the system is a small fused-salt battery\n\n\n\npack designed to supply the plate supply Voltage for the ceramic button\n \n\ntriodes, integrated thermionic circuits, and heater power if necessary.\n\n\nThe batteries can be fairly small in weight as experimental versions of\n\n\nmany fused-salt batteries have provided in excess of 200 watt-hours/kg.\n\n\nMost of these batteries act as secondary cells and are rechargeable\n \n\nseveral thousand times.\n\nIt is conceivable that a precharged pack of\n\n\n\nadequate size could run a repeater for several months without recharging,\n \n\nhowever, a much smaller battery pack would be possible if a recharging\n\n\nsystem were available.\n\n\n\n4.8.1\n\nWind Power\n \n\nThe only natural power source on Venus that may be capable\n\n\n\nof providing adequate power is a windmill.\n\nThe wind velocity near the\n\n\n\nsurface of Venus is known to be small (less than a few meters* per secohd).\n\n\nA fairly large windmill would be required to generate more than a few\n\n\nwatts.\n\nThe windmill could be coupled to a generator which has multiple\n\n\n\nwindings to permit generation of both plate voltages and heater voltage\n\n\nif required.\n\nThe problems of designing a high temperature dc to dc power\n\n\n\nconverter is avoided in this way.\n\nNo serious problem is expected in\n\n\n\ndesigning a high temperature generator.\n\nGeneral Electric Company has\n\n\n\nhad motors in operation inside the cores of nuclear reactors for at least\n\n\nten years.\n\nThese motors operate at temperatures in excess of 500\'C.\n\n\n\nThe only problem is the wind or lack of it.\n\n\n\n4.8.2\n\nRTG Power Sources\n\n\nAn alternate possibility for an electrical power source is\n\n\n\nto use radio isotopes to generate a temperature higher than the Venusian\n\n\nambient temperature.\n\nRadioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG\'s)\n\n\n\nhave been built in the 25 watt size for use in a room temperature\n\n\n\n4-17\n\n\n\nThese generators require a temperature difference between\n\n\n\nenvironment.\n\na pair of electrical junctions and have a theoretical efficiency limited\n\n\nby some percentage of the Carnot efficiency.\n\nA device designed to\n\n\n\noperate at room temperature-woul& be less efficient with the low temper\xc2\xad\n\nature sink operating in the Venusian environment.\n\nThermal generators\n\n\n\nhave a distinct advantage, however, if the high temperature heat source\n\n\ncan be coupled directly to the thermionic devices used in the radio\n \n\nrepeater.\n\nThis would reduce the electric power requirement to that\n\n\n\nneeded only by plate supply which is expected to require less than\n\n\n30%\n\nof\n\nthe total\n\npower requirement.\n\nIt may\n\nbe that\n\nradioisotope\n\n\n\nheaters can be designed separately for each of the thermionic cathode\n\n\nsources rather than attempting to share the heat from the master power\n\n\nsource.\n\n\nPresently the high temperature side of the RTG\'s operates\n\n\nnear 10000 C.\n\nThis temperature is a little high for thermionic emission\n\n\n\nwith the low work function cathodes but may be too low for efficient\n\n\nelectric power generation in the Venusian atmosphere at 750 0 K.\n\nThe\n\n\n\ndesign of an efficient power gystem for the repeater represents an area\n\n\nwhere some research will be required to optimize the use and forms of\n\n\nenergy with respect to mass and size.\n\n\n\n4.8.3\n\nFused Salt Batteries\n \n\nThe fused-salt battery technology is somewhat newer with\n\n\n\nmajor research beginning in the late 1960\'s.\n\nMany combinations of mate\xc2\xad\n\n\nrials have been tested, and some operate in. the temperature range of\n\n\ninterest.\n\nUnfortunately the majority of the research and development\n\n\n\nhas been concerned with the lower temperature batteries, but many of the\n\n\ntechniques for keeping the liquid electrodes in place and solidifying\n\n\nthe electrolite appear to be applicable to the higher temperature cells.\n\n\nOne of the most well developed types of fused-salt batteries employs\n\n\nlithium-sulphur or the sodium-sulphur electrodes operating near 300\'C.\n\n\nExperimental batteries of the same composition have been reported opera\xc2\xad\n\nting to temperatures of 47000 by workers at General Electric Company\n\n\n(Ref. 4-7).\n\nThese batteries are reported to have-energy densities over\n\n\n\n200 wh/kg making them very attractive with respect to weight.\n\nIt is not\n\n\n\nclear that the developmental batteries can be operated at higher\n\n\n4-18\n\n\n\ntemperatures., Increased temperature causes greater activity of the highly\n\n\ncorrosive electrodes which could cause deterioration of the separators\n\n\nand seals.\n\n\nThe next most promising battery has a lower energy density\n \n\n(79 wh/kg) and employs a iithium-silicon negative electrode and an iron\n\n\nsulfide positive electrode (Ref. 4-7).\n\nThis cell operates between 400 0 C\n\n\n\nto 450\'C making it ideal for this application (Ref. 4-8, 4-9).\n\nDevelop\xc2\xad\n\n\nmental batteries are being tested by Atomic International Division of\n\n\nRockwell International.\n\nThese batteries are of the 150 to 200 wh capa\xc2\xad\n\n\ncity and have been cycled 200 times from full charge to discharge.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nmajor limitation in lifetime is caused by corrosion of the negative elec\xc2\xad\n\ntrode and the hermetically sealed can.\n\nThis corrosion can be almost\n \n\n\nentirely eliminated by use of more expensive materials such as molybdenum\n\n\nor titanium (Ref. 4-10).\n\nThe lifetime of these modified batteries is\n\n\n\nunknown and no testing program has been started.\n\nEarlier experimental\n \n\n\nbatteries which have been reported by Sudar, Heredy, Hall, and McCoy have\n\n\nsurvived 2500 discharge cycles with less than 20% loss in capacity.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nuse of the more exotic metals in the negative electrode and enclosure\n\n\nwould most likely yield cells that could approach the life of the experi\xc2\xad\n\nmental cells and might easily operate for several years in the Venusian\n-\n\nenvironment.\n\n4.9\n\nENERGY BUDGET\n\n\nThe total energy budget of a simple repeater based on ther\xc2\xad\n\n\nmionic devices heated directly by radioisotope sources and electrically\n\n\npowered by an RTG can be estimated by considering the number of active\n\n\ncomponents that may be required to realize a simple repeater.\n\nThe total\n\n\n\nweight of the repeater is also of interest but is more difficult to esti\xc2\xad\n\nmate accurately.\n\nThe data presented here are only intended as a rough\n\n\n\nguess based on crude ideas about the energy requirements of presently\n\n\navailable components.\n \n\nFor most applications at radio frequencies and intermediate\n\n\namplifier frequencies two triode devices connected in a cascode configu\xc2\xad\n\nration may be required to eliminate the need of neutralization of plate\n\n\n\n4-19\n\n\n\nTable 4-3.\n\nPower Budget for a Quadra-Conversion Phase-Locked\n\n\nReceiver Using Standard Ceramic Triodes and

This sta\xc2\xad\n\nbility is .adequate for most applications except for very narrow band\n\n\nfilter designs.\n\nThe major unknown presently is the stability that can\n \n\n\nbe achieved by various local oscillators that are required to effect the\n\n\nfrequency translation.\n\nVariable reactance controlled quartz crystal\n\n\n\noscillators appear to be the simplest type of design for use as VCOs in"\n\n\nphase locked loops.\n\nUnfortunately, little is known about the stability,\n\n\n\nand phase noise of quartz controlled oscillators at 450\'C.\nis an area requiring immediate investigation.\n \n\n4-22\n\n\n\nThis then\n\n\n\nThe power requirements for a simple repeater are not very\n\n\nlarge.\n\nThe addition of other instrumentation could increase the power\n\n\n\nrequirements significantly unless most of the instrumentation amplifiers,\n\n\nmultiplexers, encoders, and modulators utilize specially designed ITCs.\n\n\nThe power requirements for thermionic devices are significantly larger\n\n\nthen those of present day transistor devices, and every effort should be\n\n\nmade to keep the electronics as simple as possible and the energy budget\n\n\nas small as possible.\n\n\nAlthough technology adequate to implement a survivable lander\n\n\nfor Venus either exists or is under development, few components can be\n\n\npurchased off the shelf that are adequate for a final design.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n\nthe vacuum tubes having externally heated cathodes are no longer manu\xc2\xad\n\nfactured.\n\nThe coupling of radioisotope heaters to these devices quite\n\n\n\npossibly has never been tried, and information concerning the lifetime\n\n\nof irradiated cathodes is unknown.\n\nTherefore, several years of testing\n\n\n\nthe various components will be required to gain experience related to\n\n\nthe efficient design and measurement of reliability of many of the\n\n\ncomponents.\n\n\nInformation that such a radio repeater and environmental\n\n\nmonitoring system can provide is needed now for the design of future\n\n\nradio science experiments for Venus.\n\nUnfortunately it is already late\n\n\n\nfor this system to provide data for missions that are already planned\n\n\nor in the design phase.\n\nIrrespective of this, the design of a simple\n\n\n\nradio repeater for Venus will provide the engineering and technological\n\n\ndata base required for more ambitious projects in the future.\n\nData from\n\n\n\nthe repeater will provide vital information pertaining to the ultimate\n\n\nradio "seeing" through the dense atmosphere as well as more refined\n\n\nmeasurements of the rotation rate and direction of the pole.\n\nUlti\xc2\xad\n\n\nmately, if the seeing is adequate and the stability of the radio repeater\n\n\nadequate, -the measurement of crustal motion may be possible if a number\n\n\nof repeaters are placed on the surface.\n\n\n\n4-23\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n4-1.\n\n"A Model of the Venus Atmosphere from Radio, Radar, and\nOccultation Observations", Muhleman, D\'.O.; Orton, G.S.; and\nBerge, G.L., (In Preparation).\n\n4-2.\n\n"Theory and Practical Design of Phase-Locked Receivers, Volume I",\nTausworthe, R.C., Technical Report No. 32-819, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, Feb. 1966.\n\n4-3.\n\n"Electronic Engineering", Seely, S., McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc.\n1956.\n\n4-4.\n\nHigh-Temperature Electronics Workshop," Progress in the Develop\xc2\xad\nment of Micro-electronics for the 5000 C Environment", LA-7409-C,\nLos Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Jan. 1978.\n\n4-5.\n\n"A New Electronic Gain Device for High Temperature Applications,"\nMcCormick, J.

of several possible configura\xc2\xad\n\n\ntions for octahedral benchmarks for various applications.\n\nLenticular\n\n\n\nwelded beams are used in a preliminary design for a deployable 2-meter\n\n\nbenchmark weighing about 10 kg and estimates of entry and deployment\n\n\nequipment are obtained.\n\nIt was found that a 10-meter benchmark for Venus\n\n\n\nwill weigh a minimum of about 200 kg without accounting for delivery and\n\n\nanchoring equipment.\n\n-A\n\nminimum estimate for a delivered 10-meter reflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor is about 300 to 500 kg.\n\nFurthermore, such a device would require\n\n\n\ndevelopment of astromast and deployment equipment technology similar to\n\n\nthat required for square solar sail deployment.\n\nA technique of fixing a\n\n\n\n2-meter benchmark to the top of a lander has been worked out and esti\xc2\xad\n\nmates of the mass of very large (100-200 meter) retroreflectors have been\n \n\nobtained for possible deep-space applications.\n\n\nConfigurations were developed for a 2-meter and 10-meter cor\xc2\xad\n\nner radar retroreflectors to be deployed on the surface of Venus.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nbasic concept is an eight cell array of tetrahedral corner reflectors\n\n\narranged such that incoming radar from any direction will be reflected\n\n\ntoward its source.\n\nThis arrangement is achieved with twelve 450 right\n\n\n\ntriangular wire mesh planes stretched between six compression members as\n\n\ndepicted in Figure 5-1.\n\nThe maximum deflection of the planes allowable\n\n\n\nfrom wind forces and gravity is 2\' from being at right angles to each\n\n\nother.\n\nThe Venusian environment assumed for design and analysis has the\n\n\n\nfollowing parameters (Reference 5-1):\n755 0

5-2).\n\nThe compression members are lenticular\n\n\n\nwelded beams which can be flattened and rolled up.\n\nWhen released, they\n\n\n\nwill deploy under their own stored tension and unroll to become rigid\n\n\nbeams (see Figure 5-3).\n\nIn the Benchmark\'s collapsed configuration, the\n\n\n\nlenticular welded beams are flattened and rolled up in a spiral with the\n\n\nmesh accordion folded in between them.\n\nThe rolled up beams and mesh are\n\n\n\nconstrained in this shape by two ring shaped bands.\n\nAt the desired time\n\n\n\nof deployment, the two bands are released in sequence (perhaps by pyro\xc2\xad\n\ntechnic devices set to detonate at a preset atmospheric pressure or\n\n\ntemperature) allowing the beams to deploy somewhat violently under their\n\n\nown stored tension.\n\nThe deployment is very similar to the Lockhead\n\n\n\nWrapped Rib Parabolic Antenna.\n\n\nIn the structural analysis, jhe equation for deflection of\n\n\neach wire in the mesh is (Reference 5-2):\n\n\n\nI 32 \\i/3\n6\n\nU4\n\nEA)\n\nwhere\n\n\nt = wire length\n\n\nw= loiding on wire\n\n\nE = modulus of elasticity of wire\n\n\n\nA = cross-sectional area of wire\n\n\nThe horizontal component of tension in the wire is (Reference 5-2):\n\n\n12\n\n\n1\n\n8 \n\n\n6\n\n\nwhere 6 = deflection.\n\n\n\n5-2\n\n\n\nThe wire mesh is composed of square cells of 1.27 cm to the\n\n\nside.\n\nThe wire mesh and the compression members are assumed to be com\xc2\xad\n\n\nposed of titanium 6A1-4V with the following material properties at 755 0 K\n\n\n(Reference 5-1):\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n7.53 x 106 newtons/cm\n\nE = \n\n\n2\n\n\n\naallowable = 4.14 x 104 newtons/cm\n\n\nThe structural wire mesh elements which take out the bending moments in\n\n\nthe lenticular welded beam compression members were sized 0.23 mm in\n\n\ndiameter in order to meet the 20 deflection criteria.\n\nThe non-structural\n\n\n\ncross wire elements of the mesh were sized 0.025 mm in diameter.\n\nIn siz\xc2\xad\n\n\ning the lenticular welded beam compression members, it was found that the\n\n\nmost severe loading was generated by impacting the Venusian surface at an\n\n\nSized for this impact load, the\n\n\n\nassumed 3 meters/sec during touch-down.\n\nbeams are 4.128 cm in diameter with a wall thickness of 0.89 mm.\n\nThe com\xc2\xad\n\n\nponent weights were estimated as follows:\n\n\n6 lenticular welded beams (titanium)\n\n7.3 kg + 20%; - 10%\n\n\n\nTitanium mesh\n\n0.45 kg \xc2\xb1 20%\n\n\n\nWelding, fittings, etc.\n\n2.25 kg \xc2\xb1 30%\n\n\n\n* mass of corner

package = 41 kg\n\n\nThe wind drag on the structure was calculated to be approximately 236 new\xc2\xad\n\ntons giving an over-turning moment of 332 newton-meters.\n\nThe weight of\n\n\n\nthe benchmark is insufficient to overcome this over-turning moment, and\n\n\nit will tumble across the planet\'s surface unless anchored.\n\n5-3\n\n\n\nAn 8.6 kg\n\n\n\nweight would be sufficient for anchoring; therefore, one solution would\n\n\nbe to keep the benchmark attached to-the entry capsule\'s heat shield\n\n\nwhich would serve as the anchoring weight.\n\n\n\n10 METER VENUS BENCHMARK\n\n5.3\n\nA 10 meter benchmark (Figure 5-4) is too large to allow the\nuse of lenticular welded beams for the compression members, given the\nforces it would be subjected to on the Venusian surface.\n\nFor larger\n\nstructures, lenticular welded beams become inefficient due to the wall\nthinness required to have them be collapsible and rollable.\n\nLarge,\n\nthin-walled tubes are more susceptible to local buckling.\nAstromasts were considered for these large corner reflectors\n\n\nsince they are generally the lightest and most compactly stowed deploy\xc2\xad\n\nable booms.\n\nIf the structure was not heavy enough to keep it anchored\n\n\n\nin the Venusian wind, then the corner reflector could be deployed from a\n\n\nplatform which had been anchored to phe soil with some sort of active\n\n\npenetration device (Figure 5-5).\n\n\nComplications arise in th\n\ndeployment of these structures.\n\n\n\nTo have the masts deploy straight out of the can instead of the usual\n\n\nrotating fashion requires a more complex storage cannister than typically\n\n\nused for astromasts (Figure 5-6).\n\nSince the reflective mesh cannot bE\n\n\n\npre-attached to the astromast while stowed, the mesh will have to attach\n\n\nto the deploying astromast through transfer rings (Figure 5-7) in a man\xc2\xad\n\nner similar to that devised for the square sail.\n\nA scheme for stowage\n\n\nThe guy\n\n\n\nand controlled deployment of the mesh would have to be devised.\n\nwires for the configuration in Figure 5-5 could be stored on ejectable\n\n\nreels (Figure\'5-8).I\n\n\ntype sizing of the astromasts\n\n\nA rough "order-of-magnitude \' \n\nfor an assumed:669 newton compressive forceis as follows (Reference 5-4):\n\n\nAstromast

Weight\n\n-\xc2\xad\n\n18 kg\n\n5-4\n\n\n\nThe weight of the wire mesh would be negligible compared to the\n \n\nastromasts.\n\nObtaining a weight estimate for deployment mechanisms and\n\n\n\ntransfer rings is very difficult since systems like these have not been\n\n\ndeveloped.\n\nDoubts arise as to the reliability of the involved deploy\xc2\xad\n\n\nment schemes required for large collapsible structures such as the\n\n\n10 Meter Venus Benchmark.\n\n\n\n5.4\n\n2 METER VENERA LANDER BENCHMARK\n\n\nThe 2 meter benchmark using lenticular welded beams could\n\n\n\nprobably be adapted as a 10 kg experiment to be deployed from a Soviet\n\n\nVenera class lander.\n\nThe Venera would provide a massive stable platform\n\n\n\nfrom which to deploy a radar retroreflector (see Figure 5-9).\n\nThe pack\xc2\xad\n\n\nage could be located atop the science instrument housing cylinder which\n\n\nis atop the aerodynamic braking device (Reference 5-5).\n\nThe benchmark\n\n\n\npackage would be exposed when the parachute was jettisoned.\n\nThe reflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor would be deployed after the vehicle\'s data transmission had ceased\n\n\nso as not to interfere with the transmission antenna which is helically\n\n\nwound around the science instrument housing.\n\nA four-cell corner reflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor array is depicted in Figure 5-9 in which the horizontal lenticular\n\n\nwelded beams are stabilized on the lower end by guy wires running to the\n \n\nscience instrument housing.\n\n\n\n5.5\n\nLARGE SPACE BENCHMARKS\n\n\nLarge space benchmarks similar in design to the 2 Meter\n\n\n\nVenus Benchmark (Figure 5-1) could conceivably be constructed.\n\nWith no\n\n\n\nwind, gravity, or impact forces, lenticular welded beams hundreds of\n\n\nmeters long might be feasible.\n\nThe most severe forces on the structure\n\n\n\nwould be those encountered in deployment.\n\nIt is felt by Lockheed that\n\n\n\nthey could build 100 meter Wrapped Rib Antennas and perhaps even larger.\n\n\nThe surface accuracy requirements for the benchmark are not as severe as\n\n\nthose for the parabolic antenna, so benchmarks larger than 100 meters\n\n\nare probably not unreasonable.\n\nA rough curve for estimating the mass of\n\n\n\nlarge space benchmarks is provided in Figure 5-10.\n\nThis is based on esti\xc2\xad\n\n\nmated weight curves for deployable mesh parabolic antennas such as the\n \n\nLockheed Wrapped Rib Antenna which are similar in concept to the bench\xc2\xad\n\nmark (Reference 5-6).\n\n\n5-5\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n5-1\n\nMoore, D., "Parametric Structural Weight Study of Benchmark\nAntenna for Venus and Mars," JPL Interoffice Memorandum:\n354:78:l01, April 14, 1978 (JPL

first, small planets at the required distance from\n\n\nthe Sun (z 50 a.u.) are too dim to be easily detected, and second, there\n\n\nis too much sky,, even near the ecliptic, to search in a reasonable time\n\n\nwith the required telescope.\n\n\nThis study recommends an entirely different approach to a\n\n\nplanet search (Reference 6-1).\n\nA set of small tracking beacons or retro\xc2\xad\n\n\nreflectors are placed into very high eccentricity heliocentric orbits\n\n\nnear the ecliptic, with eccentricity vectors pointing in equal increments\n\n\naround the solar system, as shown in Figure 6-1.\n\nThe set consists of a\n\n\n\nnumber of identical lightweight and simple spacecraft, perhaps from 8 to\'\n\n\n24, depending on available tracking accuracy.\n\nEach one is tracked peri\xc2\xad\n\n\nodically with its actual position compared with a prediction based upon\n\n\nknown bodies in the solar system and any systematic perturbations such\n\n\nas light pressure which act equally on all spacecraft.\n\n6-1\n\n\n\nDeviations in\n\n\n\nthe path of one or two spacecraft may then be solved for both the\n\n\nlocation (orbit) and mass of any planetary body passed by the probes.\n\n\nA low level of perturbations on all spacecraft would conclusively set\n\n\nan upper limit on the masg of any body within the search region which\n\n\ncould blanket the ecliptic plane out to =100 a.u., or more than twice\n\n\nPluto\'s aphelion.\n\nThe mass upper limit could be set by design to some\n\n\n\narbitrary value, such as the mass of Mercury.\n\nA strong case has been\n\n\n\nmade against major planets out of the ecliptic based on solar system\n\n\ndynamic stability (Reference 6-2).\n\n\nA number of possible spacecraft configurations have been con\xc2\xad\n\nsidered to date; the best probably has yet to be proposed.\nconcepts are discussed in greater detail in Section 3.2.\n\nSome of these\n \n\nVery large\n\n\n\nradar reflectors deployed by inflation or folded lenticular welded beams\n\n\nneeded to be too large for reasonable mass constraints (see Section 5.5).\n\n\nLong strings of phased reradiating dipoles (Reference 6-3) suffered from\n\n\npointing problems.\n\nOther large reflectors not based on corner cubes also\n\n\n\nsuffered from the inability to reliably point at Earth for long periods.\n\n\nCorner cube laser reflectors (Reference 6-4) were considered, but very\n\n\nlarge lasers are needed at Earth.\n\nAll retroreflector arrangements with\n\n\n\na narrow enough return beam to achievb the required signal suffered from\n\n\nthe fact that the Earth and the sending sites are not in the same place\n \n\nwhen the return signal arrives as when the incident signal was sent,\n\n\nbecause of Earth\'s rotation and its motion around the Sun.\n\nWith advanc\xc2\xad\n\n\ning technology and schemes involving airborne lasers, the laser technique\n\n\nmay merit further consideration since mean-motion effects of the Earth\n\n\naround the Sun are minimized every six months when Earth is at maximum\n\n\nelongation as seen from the spacecraft.\n\nTransponders were considered,\n\n\n\nbut apparently a large receiving antenna at the spacecraft must be pre\xc2\xad\n\ncisely pointed at Earth to receive the interrogation signal. -Several\n\n\nspinning spacecraft schemes were considered to alleviate the -roblem,\n\n\nbut they apparently preclude the required integration time.\n\n\nNear the close of this year\'s study, the use of an external\n\n\nclock such as a pulsar (Reference 6-5) observable by the spacecraft and\n\n\nEarth was suggested to key the spacecraft signals without requiring an\n\n\n\n6-2\n\n\n\nEarth-originated signal.\n\nPulsars are probably too dim and introduce\n\n\n\npointing problems, while signals from the Sun (Reference 6-6) and Jupiter\n\n\n(Reference 6-6) may not carry sharp enough time variations and may suffer\n\n\nserious differential atmospheric distortions.\n\nThe most recent suggestion\n\n\n\ninvolves flying a clock on the spacecraft which; rather than controlling\n\n\na simple train of signals with fixed time intervals (this scheme suffers\n\n\nfrom long-term clock drift), simply broadcasts the time it senses (Ref\xc2\xad\n\nerence 6-7).\n\nThis time is tracked through the mission to determine the\n\n\n\nonboard clock rate, which in turn allows accurate ranging measurements.\n\n\nWork will continue examining this option.\n\n\n\n6.1.2\n\nDetermination of Outer Planet Masses\n\n\nIn order to make accurate predictions of the trajectories of\n\n\n\nextra-plutonian planet probes for comparison with actual orbits, it is\n\n\nnecessary to know precisely the mass and position of the outer planets\n\n\n(Jupiter and beyond) so a gravitational map of the known solar system\n\n\nPositions are determinable from Earth measurements,\n\n\nand masses may be determined by other spacecraft flybys (though not as\n\n\naccurately if the spacecraft expells propellant) or by measuring the\n\n\n\nmay be constructed.\n\nperiods and orbit sizes of the moons. \n Beyond Saturn, however, optical\n\ninaccuracies may limit mass determination. It is planned that at least\n\n\none probe then be flown past each of the outer planets so their mass may\n\n\nbe determined for use in the gravitational model and as valuable informa-\n\ntion in itself. \n Flybys of Jupiter and Saturn may be used to calibrate\n\nthe techniques for undiscovered planet use.\n\n\n\n6.1.3\n\nMeasurement of the Solar Gravity Field\n\n\n\nA simple mission with near-term promise arose from discus\xc2\xad\n\nsions of laser reflectors for outer solar system applications. Appar\xc2\xad\n\nently through narrow-band filtering, using a laser at the appropriate\n\n\nwavelength, an optical retroreflector may be tracked even in transit\n\n\nacross the solar disc.\n\nThe very high accuracies available from laser\n\n\n\ntracking allow precise mapping of the solar gravitational field (Refer\xc2\xad\n\nence 6-7), which may then permit the determination of non-spherical\n\n\nshell distributions in the solar interior.\n\n\n\n6-3\n\n\n\nGravitational mapping data is best obtained with a fairly\n\n\nmassive (in relation to its size) laser reflector in a low solar orbit\n\n\nof high inclination.\n\nThis sort of data will prove most complementary to\n\n\n\nthe Solar Polar data obtained regarding the surface and7 solar upper\n\n\natmosphere environment at high solar latitudes.\n\nOnly a close-orbiting\n\n\n\nspacecraft making a number of orbits can provide the refined data which\n\n\nis desirable.\n\nBecause of its low mass and available tracking precision,\n\n\n\nthe laser corner reflector is very well suited to this solar physics\n \n\nexperiment.\n\n\n\n6.1.4\n\nOther Applications\n\n\nA number of other applications were also suggested for which\n\n\n\nthere was not time to conduct any serious analysis.\n\nSome of those are\n\n\n\nlisted here, with the originator referenced where known.\n\n\nDuring passes through the outer solar system, ephemerides\n\n\ncould perhaps be improved for the outer planets by determining their\n\n\npositions from probe perturbations (Reference 6-8).\n\nBecause of their\n\n\n\nindefinite lifetime, long-term residence in the solar system, and the\n\n\nability to track a retroreflector at virtually any time in the future,\n\n\nretroreflectors would be an ideal location to place materials samples\'\n\n\nwhich would provide most valuable exposure effects data for future gen\xc2\xad\n\nerations (Reference 6-8).\n\nVery long baseline and precise tracking might\n\n\n\npermit a variety of gravity wave and relativity experiments to be con\xc2\xad\n\nducted (Reference 6-8).\n\nBy mounting magnets on the retroreflector and\n\n\n\nmaking their reflection and polarization change with orientation, it\n\n\nmight be possible to track a retroreflector\'s long-term alignment with\n\n\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (Reference 6-1).\n\nExamining time and\n\n\n\nphase variations (scintillations) in returned signals caused by the\n\n\nintra-solar system plasma environment could provide a passive data source\n \n\nfor many widely-spaced locations in the solar system (Reference 6-9).\n\n\nReflectors or transponders orbiting the outer planets could\n\n\nbe used both to yield very precise ephemerides and as navigation beacons\n\n\nto guide spacecraft into orbit around those planets (Reference 6-8).\n\nA\n\n\n\nspacecraft on a fast escape trajectory alternatively could provide the\n\n\n\n6-4\n\n\n\nDeep Space Network and its follow-on systems with an extreme distance\n\n\ntest (Reference 6-8), providing useful experience prior to such long dis\xc2\xad\n\ntance missions as the Interstellar Precursor already studied (Refer\xc2\xad\n\nence 6-10).\n\n\n\n6.2\n\nLANDER OFFSET TERMINAL GUIDANCE USING RADAR REFLECTORS\n\n\n\n6.2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nIn connection with studies of the uses of radar retroreflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntors, located on planetary surfaces, it has been suggested by W. O\'Neil\n\n\nthat they may be used as terminal landing aids for other programs, such\n\n\nas sample return missions.\n\nHere this concept is examined, a specific\n\n\n\nimplementation is proposed, and a few preliminary feasiblity calculations\n\n\nare furnished.\n\nTo anticipate, the idea looks promising.\n\n\n\nSuppose a microwave retroreflector is deployed on a planet,\n\n\nand that its location is known, both absolutely, and relative to nearby\n\n\nfeatures of interest.\n\nThis could be accomplished directly by a side\n\n\n\nlooking radar from orbit, or indirectly by multiple doppler ranging\n\n\ncoupled with photographs, also from orbit.\n\nThen suppose that a landing\n\n\n\nsite is chosen in a precise location relative to the retroreflector.\n\n\nThe idea is that by augmenting the usual landing altimeter with a dop\xc2\xad\n\npler measurement from the reflector, it is-possible to observe three\n\n\naxis position and velocity variations from the nominal landing trajec\xc2\xad\n\ntory.\n\nFrom this, variations in thrust vector or aerodynamic controls\n\n\n\ncan be computed to return to a desirable landing trajectory.\n\n\nAs for the hardware, the doppler system needs about 3 w of\n\n\noutput power at X-band, using a steerable antenna of about 0.37 m aper\xc2\xad\n\nture.\n\nA conventional receiver and phase-locked doppler extractor com\xc2\xad\n\n\npletes the doppler electronics.\n\nMost of this will probably be needed\n\n\n\nanyway by the command and telemetry systems.\n\nThe control system elec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntronics includes a digital memory to store altitude, doppler, and con\xc2\xad\n\ntrol variables for the nominal trajectory; a linear state estimator, to\n\n\nextract the position and velocity variations from the measurements; and\n\n\nactuator amplifiers that would exist even without the doppler measurement.\n\n\n\n6-5\n\n\n\n6.2.2\n\nDiscussion of Controls\n\n\nIn the absence of the doppler measurement, thrust (and possi\xc2\xad\n\n\nbly lift) controls u 0 would be programmed from memory, with corrections\n\n\nu supplied by the attimeter in the terminal phase.\n\nWith the addition\n\nof the doppler system, it is possible in principal to observe the entire\nstate x (position and velocity in some appropriate coordinates).\n\nIf\n\nx 0 (t) is the state along the nominal (optimal) trajectory, then the\nob served difference 6R = R - x0 can be used to generate an incremental\ncontrol Su = u\n\n-\n\nu0 .\n\nImagine that the original optimal control problem was satis\xc2\xad\n\nfied by a field of extremals, for which the associated control vectors\n\n\nSince explicit functions G are rarely availa\xc2\xad\n\n\nare given by u = G(x, t).\n\nble, a full table of potentially useful u values requires that m\n\n\n6-dimensional arrays of numbers be stored on board at each t, where m\n\n\nis the number of controls.\n\nThis is almost surely unfeasible.\n\n\n\nTo avoid this, u may be linearized about the nominal:\n\n\n\n6u\n\n=\n\nxG(x0 ,t)*\n\n= C(t)aR\n\nHere, the actual 6x has been replaced by the available estimate 6R to\n\n\nproduce a viable control law.\nonly 7 m numbers at each t.\n\nThe storage of C(t) and u0 (t) requires\n\n\nThis approach is assumed hereafter.\n\n\n\nOptimal controls are often saturated; e.g., zero or maximum\n\n\nthrust.\n\nThis can be enforced either by programing u0 well beyond the\n\n\n\ncommandable limits, or by zero elements in C(t), 6r both.\n\n\n\n6.2.3\n\nState Error Estimator\n\n\nSuppose the landing vehicle dynamics can be described by a\n\n\n\nset of state equations:\n\n\n\nx = F(x, u, t) + w(x, t)\n\n6-6\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a set\n\n\n\nwhere w(x, t) is an unmodellable disturbance.\nof measurements y can be modelled as:\n\n\n\ny = H(x, t) + v(x, t)\n\n\n\nwhere v(x, t) is measurement noise.\n \n\nIn principle, a state estimator can be constructed directly\n\n\nIn practice it is much easier\n\n\n\nfrom these equations and the control law.\n\nto linearize about the nominal trajectory, just as with the control law.\n\n\nThus:\n\n\n\nx= k0\ny\n\n+ 8xF0 (t)(x - x 0 ) +\n\nF0(t)(u - u0) + w(x, t)\n\nH0(t) + 8xH0 (t)(x - x 0) + v(x, t)\n\nwhere\n\n\nF0(t) H F(x0 , u0 , t);\n\nH0 (t) = H(x 0 , t)\n \n\n\nAn estimator based on these has the structure:\n\n\n0F(t)DR + 8FO (t)Su + K(t)sy\n\n\n\n0\n\nis the difference between the actual and estimated\n\n\ny\n\n\nmeasurements:\n\n\nin which c\n\nEy\n\ny -9\n\ny - Ho(t) -\n\nxH0(t)*\n\nand in which K(t) is the Kalman gain matrix, which is derivable from the\n\n\n(presumably) given statistics of w and v.\n\n\nAs for the storage requirements, if k is the number of meas\xc2\xad\n\nurements, then at each t, 36 numbers are needed for 3xF 0(t), 6 m for\n\n\nSF 0(t), 6 k for K(t), k for H 0 (t), and 6 k for 8xH0(t), for a total of\n\n\n13 k + 6m + 36.\n\nOverall, after adding the controls requirements this\n\n\n\nbecomes 13(k + m) + 36.\n\nFor example, if there are 3 engine controls and\n\n\n\n3 measurements, 114 numbers are needed at each time step.\n\nAt, say, 100\n\n\n\ntime steps and 16 bits per number plus 2 parity bits, a total of 2.052\n\n\nx 105 bits are needed.\n\nThis will conveniently fit on one magnetic bub\xc2\xad\n\n\nble memory chip.\n\n\n\n6-7\n\n\n\nThere are several questions on the performance of this\n\n\nestimator that will need to be explored.\nally converge to an accurate estimate SR?\n\nFirst, will this system actu\xc2\xad\n\nThis can be answered directly\n\n\n\nby simulation on a general purpose computer.\n\nAnother way is to examine\n\n\n\nthe rank of the observability matrix, which is constructed from\nand\n\nR1 (t).\n0\n\nFO(t)\n\n\n\nThis test is sure to fail in the case that the retroreflec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntor is in the plane of the descent orbit, as then lateral displacements\n\n\nfrom the path are unobservable.\n\nThere is actually a finite band about\n\n\n\nthe surface track of the orbit that should be avoided, as the closer to\n\n\nthis track that the retroreflector is placed, the worse the crosstrack\n\n\nestimation errors.\n\n\nAnother problem is that the retroreflector should not be too\n\n\nfar from the landing point, as then the doppler system will lose lock too\n\n\nearly due to horizon effects.\n\nThis is not normally disastrous, as the\n\n\n\nfinal portion of the trajectory is nearly vertical, and the estimator\n\n\nwill not diverge rapidly just from the loss of the doppler signal.\n\nA\n\n\n\nsimilar effect occurs if the ,altimeter will not function at the initial\n\n\norbit altitude, or if the initial position is too far from, or below the\n\n\nhorizon of the retroreflector.\n\nIf there are no inputs to the estimator,\n\n\n\nit becomes a dead reckoning device, and navigates optimally based on the\n \n\ninitial state information.\n\n\nIf the retroreflector distance and cross-track restrictions\n \n\nare considered together a plot of favorable landing sites from the navi\xc2\xad\n\ngational standpoint, can be made up.\n\nBy plotting contours of constant\n\n\n\nexpected navigational error, something like Figure 6-2 should emerge.\n\n\nThe line from the right is the desired ground track, terminating at the\n\n\ndesired landing point.\n\n"Best", "good", and "poor" then refer to possi\xc2\xad\n\n\nble locations of the retroreflector.\n\n\n\n6.2.4\n\nDoppler Tracker\n \n\nA fairly conventional implementation of a doppler tracker is\n\nshown in Figure 6-3.\n\nIn the RF section, an oscillator signal f1 is con\xc2\xad\n\nverted to X-band (or higher) f1 + f2 , and.transmitted.\n\nThe return is\n\ndoppler shifted by amount fD , and heterodyned down to fl + fD .\n\n6-8\n\n\n\nA phase\n\nlock loop recovers the phase error between this and an equivalent signal\n\nconstructed from the estimated doppler shift.\n\nWhen the loop locks up,\n\n\nthis phase error is a measure-of the error in the estimated doppler fre\xc2\xad\nquency\n\nD - D.\n\nD \n=\n\ney, y, and\n\n9\n\nThese quantities are the doppler components of the\n\nvectors in the estimator theory of the last section.\nA useful feature of phase lock systems is that the effective\n\n\n\nnoise bandwidth is twice the width of the low pass filter in the phase\n\n\nThe smaller this is, the less power will be needed.\n\nlock loop.\n\nIn a\n\n\n\nfree phase lock system (no D input), the minimum filter width is set by\n\n\nthe requirement to track a variable fD* Here, the minimum is lowered by\n\n\n"guiding" the loop with the estimated doppler shift D. Using the esti\xc2\xad\nmator definitions in the last section this is:\n\n\nD = D0(t) + DxD0(t)SR\n\n\nwhere D0(t) is the doppler component of H0(t).\n\n\nIf the loop is accurately guided, minimum bandwidth tends to\n\n\ndepend on acquisition requirements.\n\nCircular\n\n\n\nConsider a Mars landing.\n\norbit speed at the surface is 3.55 km/sec.\n\nAllowing a bit for Mars rota\xc2\xad\n\ntion, a reasonable closing speed might be 3.2 km/sec.\n\nThen using a\n\ntransmitter frequency f1 + f2 = 10 GHz, we get fD = (2)(1010)(3.2)/\n(3 x 105)\n\n=\n\n213 khz.\n\nAssuming a deboost from orbit of 500 m/sec, and,\n\nsay, a 2% execution error, the uncertainty in fD is 667 Hz.\n\nIf 1 minute\n\nis permitted to find fD\' something like 11 Hz is needed in the filter,\n\n\nfor a 22 Hz noise bandwidth.\n \n\nThe other major design determinant is the antenna.\n\nWhile an\n\n\n\narticulated paraboloid would be needed for communications in any case, a\n\n\ntracking loop must be regarded as highly undesirable.\n\nThus beamwidths\n\n\n\nmust be large enough to accommodate position and attitude errors without\n\n\ntoo much gain loss.\n\nAssuming an overall error of 3\' will degrade the\n\n\n\nantenna gain by 50%, and that the system will then operate, the forward\n\n\nantenna gain is limited to\n\n\n\nG < 6750 = 750\n\n\n-2 2\n\n\n\nHH\n\n\n\n6-9\n\n\n\nHowever, the actual gain at 3\' error is only GT = 375.\n\nFor a 50%\n\n\n\nefficient aperture, this is a 0.37 m diameter dish.\n\n\nNext consider the corner cube.\ndimension of -a= 2 m has been assume-d.\n\nIn this study, a cubic edge\n\n\n\nThis gives an effective area of\n\n\n\napproximately A = gara2 /4 an effective retransmission gain of\n\n\n2\nC\nGc = (aIX) , neglecting reflection losses. The illumination at the\nC\n2\nreflector is I = PTG /(4rL ), where PT is the transmitted power and L\nis the distance from the lander to the reflector.\n\nThus the retransmitted\n\n\n\npower is\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nc\n\nc e\n\n2\n\n\n\nT(L\n\nand the illumination back at the lander is:\n\n\n\nP G\n\nPcc\n\nTa4\n\nIrPG\nPTGT\n\n\n\n4L 2\n\n642L4\n\n\n\nI(4fr),\n\nNow, the effective receiving area is A. = GT\n\nso the received\n\npower is:\n21a \\4\n\n\nPR= LPR\n\n=\n\n\'T GT(41)\n\nTo compute the required transmitter power PTV we must compare this to\nthe noise power P. = kTB, where B is the noise bandwidth, T is the\n- 23\n\nreceiver noise temperature, and k = 1.38 x 10\nstant.\n\n.\n\nj/K = Boltzmann\'s con\xc2\xad\n\n\nThus to achieve a giten minimum signal to noise ratio (S/N)min\n\n\n\nkTB(4L 4 \t\n\nmin\n\nC\'\' \n\n\nP>\n\nman\n\nLetting (S/N),in = 10 for fast acquisition T - 300 K, and assuming ini\xc2\xad\n\ntial acquisition at L = 300 km gives\n\n\n\n6-10\n\n\n\n[(4)(5 x 10)]\n< (1.38 x 10-23)(300)(22)(10)\n\n2\n\n(375)2 \n\n\nP\n\n2\n\n6.48w\n\nAt, say, 15% efficiency, 43.2 w of electrical power is needed; however,\n\n\nas a variety of RF losses have been neglected, 100 w seems more realis\xc2\xad\n\ntic.\n\nWhile this is probably feasible, a substantial reduction could be\n\n\n\nachieved by adding an accelerometer along the thrust axis.\n\nThis would\n\n\n\npermit a big reduction in the effect of the deboost execution error on\n\n\nthe initial doppler uncertainty.\n\nThus, the bandwidth B could be low\xc2\xad\n\n\nered to perhaps 5 Hz; so that PT > 1.47 w, and the required electrical\n\n\npower is now 23 w.\n\nThe accelerometer is assumed in what follows, and in\n\n\n\nfact was the reason for supposing 3 measurements in the last section.\n\n\nSome additional comments on the doppler tracker are in order.\n\n\nFirst, Figure 6-3 shows antenna pointing commands taken from a stored\n\n\nprogram in the digital memory.\n\nThis is simplest, in that it requires no\n\n\n\non board computation, but it does not make full use of the available\n\n\ninformation.\n\nOther possibilities are that pointing commands be computed\n\n\n\ndirectly from the estimated state, or that corrections are computed from\n\n\nthe estimated state variations, using stored partial derivatives.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nformer requires substantial calculation, but no memory; while the latter\n\n\nhas very little calculation, but substantial additonal memory.\n\nIt is\n\n\n\npossible that gyro information could reduce the effect of attitude\n\n\nerrors.\n\nThe benefit of this is that a higher gain GT could be employed,\n\n\n\nthus reducing power.\n\n\nAnother possible improvement is an all digital phase lock\n\n\nloop.\n\nIn this case, a relatively low f\n\nwould be chosen, and the signal\n\n\n\nfrom the IF amplifier would be pre-filtered, sampled at about 5 fl\' and\n\n\ndigitized.\n\nThen the detector, modulator, and filters would all be digi\xc2\xad\n\n\ntal; and the D/A and A/D converters would be deleted.\n\nThe requirement\n\n\n\nfor very low frequency filters makes this especially attractive.\n\n\nFinally it should be noted that most of the design parame\xc2\xad\n\nters have been chosen rather arbitrarily.\n\nA few weeks of preliminary\n\n\n\ndesign effort would serve to clarify the power-weight-performance trade\xc2\xad\n\noffs needed for a full landing system design.\n\n\n\n6-11\n\n6.2.5\n\nAltimeter\n\n\nSince a lander would carry some sort of altimeter in any\n\n\n\ncase, no special study of it will be made here.\noffered on the present Application.\n\nOnly a few comments are\n\n\n\nFirst, any kind of radar or laser\n\n\n\naltimeter, suitable for vertical landing, can be employed here.\n\nSecond,\n\n\n\na fairly high maximum altitude is desirable, since the sooner the esti\xc2\xad\n\nmator gets reliable altitude data, the better the system performance.\n\n\nOn the other hand, once a full state estimator is used, it may be possi\xc2\xad\n\nble to relax the minimum altitude requirement.\n\nThat is, many altimeters\n\n\n\nwill not work when too close to the ground; but here, the estimator\'s\n\n\ndead reckoning should be adequate in the last few hundred meters.\n\n\nFinally, one altimeter configuration could have a big impact\n\n\non the design.\n\nIf a 3 or 4 beam "JANUS" configuration is used, informa\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion on the local vertical is available, and could be combined with gyro\n\n\nand accelerometer data to yield a better estimate of the state.\n\nIn addi\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion, some of these instruments can do 3 axis doppler measurements as\n\n\nwell as range, thus yielding.relative ground velocity.\n\nIf this informa\xc2\xad\n\n\ntion were available to the estimator, much tighter control would be pos\xc2\xad\n\nsible; and if it were available early in ;the trajectory, the acceler\xc2\xad\n\nometer could be dispensed with as an aid in acquiring phase lock in the\n\n\ndoppler tracker.\n\n\n\n6.2.6\n\nOverall Landing System\n\n\nThe complete system is pictured in Figure 6-4.\n\nThe configu\xc2\xad\n\n\nration is the simplest variation discussed above, except that an acceler\xc2\xad\n\nometer has been added to reduce the initial dopper error.\n\nThe oscillator\n\n\n\non the left is the system\'s basic timing reference, and should have very\n\n\ngood stability, especially over the range of round trip travel times (up\n\n\n\nto a few milliseconds).\n\nThe clock is needed to synchronize all the sys\xc2\xad\n\n\ntem\'s digital operations, and as shown, merely counts down f\noscillator.\n\nfrom the\n\n\n\nIn the case of a digital phase lock loop, a higher frequency\n\n\n\nwould be needed\' for sampling; but this might come from the f2 multiplier\n\n\nin the doppler system.\n \n\n\n6-12\n\n\n\nLittle has been said about what the controls control.\nvertical lander must have a throttle.\n\nA\n\n\n\nSide vector control is also\n\n\n\nrequired, and can be provided by side jets, engine gimbals, rotating\n\n\nthe whole vehicle, or some combination.\n\nAlso, for Mars at least, aero\xc2\xad\n\n\ndynamic lift and braking might be employed to reduce the thrust require\xc2\xad\n\nments.\n\nThe memory and estimator could then be regarded as an autopilot,\n\n\n\ncontrolling rudder, elevators, ailerons, or whatever.\n\nThe additional\n\n\n\nmemory and logic are insignificant, compared to the hardware of the\n\n\nadded controls.\n \n\nTo sum up, the use of a benchmark retroreflector as a navi\xc2\xad\n\ngator aid for a planetary lander seems quite feasible from the stand\xc2\xad\n\npoint of the necessary extra lander weight, power, and complexity.\n\nAs\n\n\n\nonly a few days have been available for this study, it has not been pos\xc2\xad\n\nsible to synthesize the estimator, and thus find the tradeoff between\n\n\nweigh\'t, power, and performance.\n\nA few man-months should be sufficient to\n\n\n\ndo this, and get good estimates on achievable maximum levels of terminal\n\n\nposition and velocity errors.\n\n\n\n6-13\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n6-1\n\nStaehle, Robert, "Uses of Radar Retroreflectors in the Outer\nSolar System," JPL--IOM -31-2-/78-.3-652, July 1978 (ftL internal\ndocument).\n\n6-2\n\nGoldreich, Peter, and Ward, William "The Case Against Planet\nX," Pub. of Astron.

The study was performed by a small group of individuals\n\n\nwith inputs from a larger number of consultants. The conclusions and\n\n\nrecommendations are not unanimous nor do they necessarily represent a\n\n\nmajority opinion. What follows are the general conclusions drawn by the\n\n\nstudy manager based upon inputs from the contributors and consultants.\n\n\nIt has been shown that long-term tracking of a number of passive\n\n\nor active radar reflectors offers great potential for improvement of our\n\n\nunderstanding of planetary structure and dynamics. Earth-based Doppler\n \n\ntracking with ranging to the level of several tens of meters could pro\xc2\xad\n\nvide an order of magnitude improvement in our knowledge of the spin\n \n\nstate of Venus. Long-term (decades) observation of the motion of several\n\n\nbenchmarks could yield another order of magnitude of improvement in our\n\n\nknowledge. Substantial improvements in knowledge of the in-plane com\xc2\xad\n\nponents of the Venus ephemeris could be obtained by Earth-based benchmark\n\n\ntracking over one Earth-Venus synodic period but residuals of the order\n\n\nof 20 km would remain in the direction normal to the Venus orbit plane.\n\n\nA conceptual design has been completed for a 2 meter, 10 kg octa\xc2\xad\n\nhedral corner reflector suitable for deployment on the Venus surface and\n\n\nvisible to orbital radar but not visible to Earth-based radar. Ranging\n\n\naccuracy to the benchmark would be limited only by the characteristics\n\n\nof the orbital radar. For the proposed VOIR mission the resolution\n\n\nwould be about 50 meters. Attempts to design a 10 meter passive bench\xc2\xad\n\nmark for Earth-based observation showed that such a device would weigh\n \n\nseveral hundred kilograms at least and would require a complex deployment\n\n\nand anchoring system. Ranging accuracy to a large Venus benchmark would\n\n\nbe of the order of 100 m using our largest radio telescopes on Earth. It\n\n\nis suggested that this idea be shelv&d for possible application as Earth\xc2\xad\n\nbased radar capability improves. The concept should definitely be\n\n\nreexamined if a large Earth-orbital radio telescope becomes available.\n\n\nA design for a high-temperature transponder for use on the surface\n\n\nof Venus has been worked out and appears to be feasible. Mass estimates\n\n\nfor the device are in the 20 to 30 kilogram range. The only drawback is\n\n\nthe difficulty of guaranteeing a lifetime sufficiently long for measure\xc2\xad\n\nments of planetological significance. It has been suggested that this\n\n\nconcept be pursued as a promising means of achieving the scientific\n\n\ngoals discussed in Section 2.\n\n\nSeveral offshoot applications of benchmark technology have been\n \n\nstudied briefly and appear to offdr exciting possibilities. High\n\n\npowered lasers of the type being built by the military are probably\n\n\nadequate for tracking LAGEOS-type corner reflectors throughout the inner\n\n\nsolar system for a number of relativity and planetary dynamics applica\xc2\xad\n\ntions. The small passive benchmark was also shown to serve well as a\n\n\n\n&\n7-1\n\n\n\nN\n\nPAGE BLANK. NOT\n\nlanding reference for Martian or Venusian landers having moderate steer\xc2\xad\n\nable radar capability. It is shown that the benchmark enables a straight\xc2\xad\n\nforward implementation of offset guidance technology. The application is\n\n\nprobably adequate for landing systems under consideration now for Mars.\n\n\nInvestigation of several deep space applications of the benchmark\n\n\nconcept led to the realization that a very low power transmitter is\n\n\ndetectable on Earth even when the transmitter if as far away as 100 A.U.\n\n\nThis rather remarkable fact led to consideration of a number of very\n\n\nsimple, over-designed spacecraft to be launched from Earth orbit into\n\n\ntrajectories with aphelia beyond 100 A.U. As the spacecraft spread out\n\n\nin all directions, they form an expanding circle that passes Uranus\'\n\n\norbit in only 7.7 years. In addition to providing a full map of the\n\n\nelectromagnetic environment, the probes would yield an accurate mass\n\n\ndetermination for each outer planet, and, after they pass Pluto\'s orbit\n\n\n20 years after launch, some of them would be assured of being perturbed\n\n\nby a tenth planet if it exists and has a mass greater than about one\xc2\xad\n\nthird the Earth\'s mass. The concept is under further investigation as\n\n\npart of the FY 1979 Advanced Concepts Study.\n\n\nSpecific recommendations are as follows:\n\n\n(1)\n\nContinue study of small (2-3 m) benchmarks.\n\n(2)\n\nIntensify study of simple, high temperatures, long-life\ntransponders.\n\n(3)\n\nShelve the concept of a large passive retroreflector on the\nplanetary surfaces for Earth-based observations. Reexamine\nif Earth-orbital radio telescope is built.\n\n(4)\n\nContinue study of interplanetary and deep space benchmarks.\n\n(5)\n\nInvestigate use of high-power laser technology for inner\nsolar system tracking.\n\n7-2\n\nNAS-Jt-Co,.
