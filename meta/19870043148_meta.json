The former problems of vibrational assignments are unambiguously established in view of a study of isotopic oxygen molecules. A systematic examination of the known Rydberg series is conducted, and new assignments and interpretations for several autoionization states leading to the various states of O2(+) are suggested.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "37", "submissionId": 19870043148, "issn": "0022-4073", "id": "db72323192f745569831f3424cdfd4b4", "publicationName": "Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
