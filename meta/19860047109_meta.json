Liquid nitrogen is allowed to vaporize, making gaseous nitrogen the test medium with temperatures extending down to approximately 100 degrees Kelvin. These factors have created unique, new challenges to those developing sensors and instrumentation. Pressure vessels, thermal enclosures or elaborate temperature compensations schemes, are needed for environmental protection and special materials are needed for sensors and model fabrication. The need for a new measurement, model deformation, was also created. An extensive program to develop the unique sensors and instrumentation was initiated. The data acquisition system and systems to measure aerodynamic forces and pressures, model attitude, and model deformation, are discussed.", "title": "The National Transonic Facility", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T20:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860047109, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Holmes, H.
