One of the biggest problems today within the airline industry is the constant complaining from customers regarding the deterioraton of service (McCollough, Berry, & Yadav, 2000). Since 1995, unfortunately no airline has been immune from service deterioration, as reported by the Airline Quality Rating, an annual report by two airline industry experts who analyzed Department of Transportation statistics (Harrison & Kleinsasser, 1999). The airline' refusal to recognize the issue of customer service has perpetuated an environment that has become dangerous and detrimental to the traveling public as well as to airline employees, which in turn has fueled a new phenomenon, now referred to as \"air rage\".", "title": "A Correlational Study of How Airline Customer Service and Consumer Perception of Airline Customer Service Affect the Air Rage Phenomenon", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20070022531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hunter, Joyce A."}, "organization": {"name": "Saint Xavier Univ.", "location": "Chicago, IL, United States"}}, "id": "7a8812924bf349ebb83cfd2c497596b8"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2016-04-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070022531, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070022531, "id": "a6dca8cafb944f89abcb083d5bdaf502", "publicationName": "Journal of Air Transportation, Volume 11, No. 3", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070022527, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Journal of Air Transportation, Volume 11, No. 3", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070022531.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070022531/downloads/20070022531.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070022531/downloads/20070022531.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070022531/downloads/20070022531.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
