b'Cloud Imagers Offer New Details on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Health\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nA\n\n\t stunning red sunset or purple sunrise is an\naesthetic treat with a scientific explanation: The\ncolors are a direct result of the absorption or reflectance of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols, minute\nparticles (either solid or liquid) in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere\nthat occur both naturally and because of human activity.\nAt the beginning or end of the day, the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays travel\nfarther through the atmosphere to reach an observer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\nand more green and yellow light is scattered, making the\nSun appear red. Sunset and sunrise are especially colorful\nwhen the concentration of atmospheric particles is high.\nThis ability of aerosols to absorb and reflect sunlight is\nnot just pretty; it also determines the amount of radiation and heat that reaches the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, and can\nprofoundly affect climate.\n\nIn the atmosphere, aerosols are also important as nuclei\nfor the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals.\nClouds with fewer aerosols cannot form as many water\ndroplets (called cloud particles), and consequently, do not\nscatter light well. In this case, more sunlight reaches the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. When aerosol levels in clouds are high,\nhowever, more nucleation points can form small liquid\nwater droplets. These smaller cloud particles can reflect\nup to 90 percent of visible radiation to space, keeping the\nheat from ever reaching Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nThe tendency for these particles to absorb or reflect the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s energy\xe2\x80\x94called extinction by astronomers\xe2\x80\x94depends\non a number of factors, including chemical composition\nand the humidity and temperature in the surrounding\nair; because cloud particles are so small, they are affected\nquickly by minute changes in the atmosphere. Because\nof this sensitivity, atmospheric scientists study cloud particles to anticipate patterns and shifts in climate.\nUntil recently, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s study of atmospheric aerosols\nand cloud particles has been focused primarily on satellite images, which, while granting large-scale atmospheric\nanalysis, limited scientists\xe2\x80\x99 ability to acquire detailed\ninformation about individual particles. Now, experiments\nwith specialized equipment can be flown on standard jets,\nmaking it possible for researchers to monitor and more\naccurately anticipate changes in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and\nweather patterns.\n\nPartnership\n\nStratton Park Engineering Company Inc. (SPEC) installed its\nCloud Particle Imager (CPI) on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s High Altitude Research\nProgram aircraft. Research facilities around the world\nhave since used the commercially available CPI to further\natmospheric study.\n\n104\t Environmental and Agricultural Resources \t\n\nBoulder, Colorado-based Stratton Park Engineering\nCompany Inc. (SPEC) has won 16 Phase I Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts and 11\nPhase II contracts with NASA since 1990. These contracts\nall related to developing atmospheric instrumentation\nand included: a Phase II Small Business Technology\nTransfer (STTR) contract in 1996 from Langley\nResearch Center for cloud radiation measurement; a\nPhase II SBIR in 1999 from Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nfor cloud particle imagers; a Phase I SBIR in 2001 from\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center for in situ lidar for cloud\nand aerosol radiation studies; a Phase II SBIR in 2003 for\ncloud micro-sensors from Goddard; and a Phase I SBIR\nin 2008 from Wallops Flight Facility and Goddard for\nadvanced cloud particle probes.\nDeveloped with funding from the 1999 SBIR, the\nSPEC Cloud Particle Imager (CPI) was installed on\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s High Altitude Research Program aircraft, the\ntwo WB-57s based at Ellington Field near Johnson Space\nCenter. Research facilities around the world have since\nused the commercially available CPI to further atmospheric study. SPEC has sold its CPIs to the National\nCenter for Atmospheric Research, the University of\nWashington, the University of North Dakota, and Sandia\nNational Laboratories, in addition to other agencies and\ninstitutions in the United States, Australia, and Canada.\n\nProduct Outcome\nRecognizing the need to analyze cloud particles from\nclose range, SPEC designed its CPI to be mounted to\nairplane exteriors; this robust design allows the CPI to\noperate in most airspeeds, altitudes, and air pressures,\nand to withstand vibrations and extreme temperatures as\nlow as -70 \xc2\xb0C. The system can also be adapted for harsh\nground studies, and has been used at locations at the\nSouth Pole and New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s Mount Washington.\nAs a research aircraft flies through clouds, the externally mounted CPI captures digital images of cloud\nparticles. As they enter the CPI\xe2\x80\x99s detection subsystem,\nparticles cause light to scatter from two overlapping laser\nbeams. That scattered light hits detectors and triggers the\nCPI\xe2\x80\x99s imaging system to capture a high-resolution digital\nphotograph of the particles using a 1-megapixel charge\ncoupled device camera, which can image between 75 and\n500 frames per second, depending on camera upgrades.\nThe CPI captures images of particles that range in size\nfrom 15 to 2,500 micrometers, and the high-resolution\nimages have a nominal resolution of 2.3 micrometers,\ndisplaying unprecedented detail for researchers. After\nSpinoff 2009\n\nThe company is now developing extremely small\ninstruments that can image cloud particles continuously\nfor up to 24 hours. Under the 2008 Wallops and Goddard\nSBIR agreement, SPEC has designed a small version of\nits CPI, the Micro-CPI, for small Uninhabited Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) which span fewer than 6 feet across.\nNASA and other agencies are using UAVs for atmospheric\nmeasurements because, among other reasons, they can\nfly in extremely cold or oxygen-poor altitudes. MicroCPI\xe2\x80\x94like the original CPI\xe2\x80\x94measures the properties of\nice crystals and water droplets, records the data onboard\nthe UAV, and then sends them back to a computer.\nSPEC also continues to develop the other particle\nimaging products funded by SBIR and STTR contracts,\n\nincluding the in situ lidar. This instrument can measure\nthe absorption in liquid clouds with sampling volumes of\nmillions of cubic meters. In this technique, a laser sends\nout pulses of light horizontally from an aircraft inside\nan optically thick cloud. Meanwhile, wide field-of-view\ndetectors measure the time series of the number of photons returned. The ultimate use of these instruments is to\nprovide a large volume of high-quality data about clouds\nfor climate prediction models.\nFor its own studies and research using the CPI, the\nMicro-CPI, and the in situ lidar, SPEC makes the collected data available to the scientific community for\nanalysis and further study, helping promote a better\nunderstanding of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate. v\n\nAs a research aircraft flies through clouds, the externally\nmounted CPI captures digital images of cloud particles that\nrange in size from 15 to 2,500 micrometers.\n\ncapturing a particle\xe2\x80\x99s image, the system transmits the\ninformation to a computer and SPEC\xe2\x80\x99s CPI software,\nwhich crops and compresses the images. The system then\nstores the images and information for further analysis.\nSPEC\xe2\x80\x99s customized post-processing software, CPIView,\nperforms some analysis automatically, calculating perimeters, areas, lengths, and volumes. It also creates graphical\ndisplays to show researchers certain distributions, such as\npatterns over time and in certain locations.\nWith such long-term studies and histograms of particle\nsizes, SPEC\xe2\x80\x99s CPI system can help alert scientists to how\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate is changing, and how quickly. SPEC\npresident and CEO, Dr. Paul Lawson, explains that\nclouds and cloud particles have a major impact on global\nclimate change: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we change the mean size of cloud particles by a micron, a millionth of a meter, then that\xe2\x80\x99s the\nsame as doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby drastically increasing the lower\natmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to trap heat on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nAfter SPEC\xe2\x80\x99s externally mounted CPI captures a particle\xe2\x80\x99s image, the system transmits the information to a computer and\nSPEC\xe2\x80\x99s CPI software, which crops and compresses the images. The system then stores the images and information for\nfurther analysis.\n\nEnvironmental and Agricultural Resources \t 105\n\n'
