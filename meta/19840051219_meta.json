It was, however, found that state-of-the-art technology would not provide for the evolutionary growth aspects of a long life system. In the process of its reviews, the SSTSC identified 10 specific disciplines to categorize the technology which was found to be relevant or potentially applicable to a future space station design. Attention is given to the objectives for the advanced development program, systems and operations, data management, crew and life support, power, thermal management, human capability, auxiliary propulsion, fluid management systems, attitude control and stabilization, structures and mechanisms, and communications.", "title": "Space station technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840051219, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tumulty, W.
