b'Computer Technology\n\nProblem-solving Software\n\nase-based reasoning (CBR) is\ndefined as "a problem-solving paradigm that adapts stored problem\nsolutions - or cases - to solve new\nproblems specified by a user." CBR is applicable to a wide range of classification and\nconstruction tasks. It is particularly useful in\ntasks where a formal set of rules for generating solutions is difficult to obtain, but examples of correct solutions to similar problems\nare readily available.\nInference Corporation, El Segundo,\nCalifornia has introduced a stand-alone commercial software product based on CBR.\nKnown as CBR ExpressTM, it\nincorporates technology\nA COMMERCIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING PRODUCT\noriginally developed by\nEMERGED FROM NASA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nInference in work on the\nAdvanced Software Development\nWorkstation (ASDW) for Johnson Space\nCenter (JSC). Shown below are the three\nmembers of the company\'s original CBR\ndesign team, from left, Elizabeth Ralston,\nDaniel Lee and David Lee.\n\nC\n\nThe JSC project focused on reuse of\nsoftware designs and software components as\na means of reducing costs and relieving a\nbottleneck in software development and in\nmaintenance of deployed systems. Software\nreuse involves the retrieval and modification\nof existing software components. The\nmethod used was a knowledge-based system\nthat provided a software parts composition\nsystem, which consists of a language for modeling software parts and their interfaces; a\ncatalog of existing parts; an editor for combining parts; and a code generator that takes\na specification and generates code for that\napplication in the target language.\nIn the ASDW project, Inference\nCorporation employed CBR in the reuse\nprocess as part of the ACCESS prototype\nsoftware. ACCESS is a knowledge-based\nsoftware information system designed to\nassist the user in modifying or configuring\nretrieved software or design objects to the\nuser\'s specifications.\nThe commercial CBR Express that\nemerged as a spinoff from the\nASDW project is used as a "help\ndesk" for customer support,\nenabling reuse of existing information when necessary. It has been\nadopted by a number of companies,\namong them American Airlines,\nGTE Corporation and Nippon Steel.\nAn example of its utility: if\nAmerican Airlines\' reservation system software did not work, CBR\nExpress would solve the problem by\nidentifying similar problems in its\ndatabase; essentially it classifies a\ngiven problem situation on the basis\nof past problems.\n\nI\n\nTMCBR Express is a trademark o f Inference\nCorporation.\n\n'
