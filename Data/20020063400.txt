b'Performance Boosting Additive\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\nA\n\nQwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2,\ndeveloped by\nMainstream\nEngineering\nCorporation, is a\nrefrigerant additive\nthat increases cooling\ncapacity.\n\nn inexpensive way to increase the\nperformance of air conditioners, heat\npumps, refrigerators, and freezers has found\na home in the commercial sector,\nspurred into existence by the need to\nthermally control NASA spacecraft.\nThrough Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funds from the\nGoddard Space Flight Center,\nMainstream Engineering Corporation\nof Rockledge, Florida, developed a\nchemical/mechanical heat pump. The\nsystem makes use of environmentally\nacceptable working fluids, in particular, non-ozone-depleting substances.\n\nAs an indirect result of the SBIR-supported\nresearch, Mainstream Engineering has developed a\nunique, patented, low-cost refrigerant additive, called\nQwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2. The product works by increasing the\ncooling capacity of the refrigerant. QwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2\ncirculates through the refrigeration system in a\nmanner similar to that of the lubricant. It has a high\naffinity for liquid hydrofluorocarbon and\nhydrochlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and also\nexhibits a significant heat of solution when mixed\nwith them. This solution heat increases the available\ncooling capacity\xe2\x80\x94the latent heat of the refrigerant\nduring evaporation. Thus, the performance of the\nsystem is increased.\n\n56\n\nConsumer/Home/Recreation\n\nWhen production of ozone-depleting refrigerants\nwas halted in the United States as part of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Air Act,\naffected units switched to another type of refrigerant.\nHowever, in doing so, these same units suffered a\nperformance and efficiency reduction. Lower vaporcompression system efficiencies meant more electrical consumption resulting in the production of more\npower plant emissions.\nQwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 has shown to be an environmentally safe fluid with zero ozone depletion potential,\nimproving the performance of vapor-compression\nheat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigeration\nsystems by as much as 20 percent. This results in a\nreduction in energy use and expenses for the\nequipment owners and a reduction in pollution\ngenerated by power plants.\nQwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 is currently being marketed and\nsold in certain automotive air-conditioning systems\nand refrigeration units. The product is packaged in a\n3-ounce can, pressurized with R-134a refrigerant.\nOnce the additive is introduced into the system, it\nremains active for the life of the system and does not\nneed to be replaced. An increase in automotive airconditioning cooling capacity means faster car cooldowns and more cooling. This is a desirable attribute\ngiven the reduced capacities of new auto airconditioning systems operating with or retrofitted to\nuse R-134a refrigerant.\nTesting of the product has shown that it will not\nadversely affect system lubrication or compressor life.\nAdding QwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 resulted in reduced wear\nproperties compared to the lubricant alone. These\ntests also indicated that the product reduced the\naccumulation of wear metals in the lubricant.\nMainstream Engineering Corporation received\nthe Tibbetts award from the Small Business Administration during an October 1997 White House\nceremony for its commercialization of the performance enhancing additive technology.\nFuture use of QwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 appears bright, as\nresidential and commercial air-conditioning and\nrefrigeration systems will undoubtedly face regulations to reduce energy consumption. This additive\noffers a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to meet these\nfuture goals.\nMeanwhile, new military and NASA units that\ntake advantage of QwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 will be more\nefficient, smaller, and lighter\xe2\x80\x94all desirable features\nfor aircraft and spacecraft applications.\nQwikBoost\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Mainstream Engineering Corporation\n\n'
