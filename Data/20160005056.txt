A percussive\ncone penetrometer was used in this study to penetrate a regolith/ice mixture by\nbreaking up ice and un-compacting the regolith. As compared to a static cone\npenetrometer, percussion allows low reaction forces to push a penetrometer probe tip\nmore easily into dry regolith in a low gravity environment from a planetary surface\nrover or a landed spacecraft. A percussive cone penetrates icy regolith at ice\nconcentrations that a static cone cannot penetrate. In this study, the percussive\npenetrator was able to penetrate material under 65 N of down-force which could not\nbe penetrated using a static cone under full body weight. This paper discusses using a\npercussive cone penetrometer to discern changes in the concentration of water-ice in\na mixture of lunar regolith simulant and ice to a depth of one meter. The rate of\npenetration was found to be a function of the ice content and was not significantly\naffected by the down-force.\nThe test results demonstrate that this method may be ideal for a small\nplatform in a reduced gravity environment. However, there are some cases where the\nsystem may not be able to penetrate the icy regolith, and there is some risk of the\nprobe tip becoming stuck so that it cannot be retracted. It is also shown that a\npercussive cone penetrometer could be used to prospect for water ice in regolith at\nconcentrations as high as 8% by weight.\nINTRODUCTION\nData from remote sensing and from the LCROSS mission indicate the\nexistence of vast quantities of water ice and other volatiles in the lunar regolith,\nfrozen into the permanently shadowed craters near the poles. This is game-changing\nbecause of the magnitude and importance of such a resource outside Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity\nwell. It will be important to ground-truth these findings by putting an instrument into\nthe lunar regolith to measure the ice content directly. This will be difficult to do with\na small-class or medium-class rover in the low lunar gravity because these platforms\nwill not have adequate weight to provide the necessary downforce. In the Apollo\nprogram, astronauts found it extremely difficult to push tubes into the dense,\nfrictional lunar soil in 1/6 G. It will be even worse as we take core samples, anchor\nonto, and mine asteroids and small moons like Phobos, or mine icy soil on the Moon.\nLow-force penetration systems will be required in all these situations.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nPrior work by Honeybee Robotics Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation has\nshown that percussive cone penetrometers are capable of penetrating lunar regolith\nwith only a small fraction of the force of an ordinary penetrometer. This study asks\nthe question whether percussion is a suitable method to insert instruments into that\nregolith when it contains various quantities of water ice. We performed preliminary\nexperiments to measure penetration resistance in lunar soil simulant with varying\nquantities of water ice. We also performed a demonstration of percussive penetration\ninto a 1-meter deep column of ice and soil mixtures in layers of varying proportions.\nOne meter is the expected depth to reach the ice beneath the desiccated upper layers\nof lunar soil. A companion study (ISDS for Water Detection on the Lunar Surface)\nhas performed preliminary investigation of a dielectric/thermal sensor that may be\ninserted into the regolith by this percussive penetration method to positively identify\nlunar ice. This system combining the sensor with percussive penetration has to\npotential to provide the first-ever ground truth of vast quantities of dense ice layers in\nthe lunar regolith.\nEXPERIMENTS\nExperiments were performed jointly by Honeybee and NASA at the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC). The percussive penetrator was provided and operated by\nHoneybee Robotics. The mixtures of lunar soil simulant and water ice were prepared\nby NASA/KSC. Descriptions of the hardware and experiments are provided below.\nPercussive Cone Penetrometer\nOriginally we had planned to use both percussion and gas pulsing in the cone\npenetrometer. Further analysis of the icy soil mixtures indicated that gas pulsing was\nnot an appropriate approach due to the low permeability of ice-impregnated lunar soil\nand due to its extremely high mechanical strength. Therefore, the gas pulsing\napproach was abandoned. For this effort, we used a percussive dynamic cone\npenetrometer originally developed under a separate Honeybee SBIR Phase 1 effort. In\nthe configuration tested, this device delivers 2.6 Joules of percussive energy per blow\nat a frequency of approximately 1500-1750 blows per minute. This device was\noriginally designed as a geotechnical instrument: By driving a cone into soil using a\nknown percussive energy and recording the rate of penetration, soil strength can be\nderived. This device is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Honeybee Robotics percussive cone penetrometer.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nIce/Soil Mixtures\nLunar soil simulant JSC-1A was used in this project to represent lunar soil.\nCarrier et al [1991] have summarized the geotechnical properties of actual lunar soil\nwithout ice. The mechanics of JSC-1A without ice have been studied by Alshibli and\nHasan [2009] and Zeng et al [2010]. The mechanics of the original version of this\nsimulant, JSC-1, was reported by Klosky et al [2000]. No data have been returned\nfrom the Moon to indicate the mechanics of the soil with or without ice as it may be\nfound in the permanently shadowed craters. Gertsch et al [2006] used JSC-1A in\nice/simulant mixtures to experimentally study the resistance to a surface indentor\n(chipping the surface) and found that resistance is a strong function of ice content.\nThey reported that ice concentrations of 0.6 to 1.5% by mass behave like weak shale\nor mudstone, whereas concentrations of 10.6% behave like strong limestone or\nsandstone and thus would be very difficult to excavate. Gamsky and Metzger [2010]\nused JSC-1A without ice on shake tables and in ovens and report that iceless regolith\nin the permanently shadowed craters may be less compacted than elsewhere on the\nMoon due to the lack of the strong, localized, diurnal quakes to shake down the soil\nand due to the lack of thermal cycling to directly compact it [Chen et al, 2006]. We\nare unaware of any other studies addressing soil mechanics in the permanently\nshadowed craters. The JSC-1A in this study was dried thoroughly in an oven and\nmassed then monitored as it cooled and re-adsorbed humidity in the laboratory\nenvironment. The percent mass of adsorbed water was not significant, so pre-drying\nwas not performed for further sample preparation. JSC-1A was mixed with water in\npercentages ranging between 0% and 8% by mass in 1% increments. The water/\nsimulant mixtures were placed in layers into six 1-gallon cans (paint cans) as shown\nin Fig. 2 (left). Each can had three layers, the layer with the greatest moisture content\nat the bottom. Each layer was tamped to compact it as it was laid down. The\nmoisture did not migrate significantly from their original layers to the adjacent layers\ndue to the relative impermeability of JSC-1A and because they were quickly frozen.\nFreezing was performed to -60\xc2\xba C overnight. The cans were removed from the\nfreezer for testing, and although some warming may have occurred, it should have\nbeen small relative to the freezing point of water due to the large bulk of frozen\nmaterial. The cans are described in Table 1. A 1-meter column, shown in Fig. 2, was\nprepared in a similar manner with ten layers. The first and every other layer were dry\n(0% ice). The interleaving layers contained 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% water ice by\nmass (from top to bottom), as shown in Fig. 3, and was frozen at -60\xc2\xba C overnight.\n\nFigure 2. (Left) Ice/soil can.

On some occasions, an effort was made to push it into the\nicy regolith without percussion but with moderate downforce provided by the\noperator. For all samples, percussion was activated, providing 2.6 Joules per blow at\nabout a 15 Hz repetition rate. Each can was penetrated using only the 61.7 N weight\nof the penetrator for downforce or sometimes using additional downforce provided by\nthe operator pushing down on the penetrometer\xe2\x80\x99s handles. In each case the can was\nsitting on an Acculab electronic mass scale, which provided a measurement of the\ndownforce. Each penetration event, including the reading of the mass balance, was\nvideo recorded. The rate of penetration was obtained post-test by observing the\nlength indicators on the shaft of the penetrator as they entered the ice/simulant\nmixture.\n\nFigure 4. Cone penetration into sample can.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nTest Results\nPenetration into cans #1 and #2, which had ice contents between 0% and 5%\nby mass, was not difficult. The percussive penetrator made progress under its own\nweight. The speed of penetration decreased as the percent water content increased.\nIn the case of can #3, the percussive penetrator acting under its own weight achieved\na maximum depth of 7.5 cm, passing through the top layer and some portion of the\nsecond layer before progress halted. The top few centimeters of icy regolith was\nbroken into chunks as the cone passed through it. Increasing down force was then\napplied by the operator. No further progress beyond this was possible with only\noperator applied weight. Video shows that the sheet metal top surface of the mass\nscale was vibrating in response to the sample can. It is possible that this motion\nrendered the percussive cone less effective by absorbing some of the percussive\nenergy. To investigate this, the can was moved to the floor next to the scale. The\npercussive cone was operated with a large down force applied from 2 people\namounting to about 750 N. There was a small, barely perceptible additional\npenetration. This was also tried with the can back on the scale to measure the load\nwith no further cone penetration noted. Penetration into the third layer, 6% ice, was\nnot achieved. Figure 5 shows the depth versus time profile for can #3, obtained from\npost-test video analysis. Figure 6 shows the downforce versus time profile.\n\nFigure 5. Penetration depth versus time for sample can #3.\n\nFigure 6. Down-force versus time for sample can #3.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nCan #4 performed similarly to can #3. The cone acting only under its own\nweight penetrated the first layer at 6% ice and a portion of the second layer at 7% ice.\nAdditional down-force was applied momentarily at ~300 seconds to see if further\nprogress could be made. Minor additional penetration was achieved. After this the\npercussor frequency was increased to maximum without significant added penetration\nprogress. Video shows that the sheet metal top surface of the mass scale was vibrating\nin reaction to the sample can. It is possible that this motion rendered the percussive\ncone less effective by absorbing some of the percussive energy. Figure 7 shows the\npenetration depth versus time for can #4, and fig. 8 shows the down-force versus\ntime. Figure 9 shows the fracturing of the sample\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\n\nFigure 7. Penetration depth versus time for sample can #4.\n\nFigure 8. Down-force versus time for sample can #4.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\n\nFigure 9. Fractured surface of can #4. Shaft demonstrates depth of penetration.\nIn the case of can #5 with 100% water ice (no simulant), the penetrator\nfractured the ice, and the resulting large pieces moved apart or slid past each other as\nthe cone moved deeper into the target. The cone penetrated to the bottom of the can\nmuch more quickly than it had penetrated the different mixtures that contained lunar\nsoil simulant. Figure 10 shows the fractured surface of can #5.\n\nFigure 10. Fractured surface of can #5 with 100% water ice.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nIn the case of can #6 with 8% and higher water ice, the cone penetrated the\nsurface but it did not do so by fracturing the top layer of icy regolith into chunks as\nbefore. The hole that the cone created in the icy regolith had very clean sides.\nPowdered material was observed on top of the target\xe2\x80\x99s original surface, and this\npowdered material could be brushed aside to reveal the original surface. From this,\nwe infer that the cone was pulverizing icy regolith and ejecting it from the resulting\nborehole though the force of its own vibration. When the borehole became too deep\nfor the pulverized material to be ejected, progress came to a halt.\nFor the 1-meter column, the cone penetrated its entire length to a depth of\n90.7 cm. The rate of penetration varied, and was observed to correspond with the\nlayering as shown in Fig. 11, where the slopes of the fitted linear segments are the\npenetration rates. The 8% slope is not valid since the cone was on the container\nsidewall and the container was splitting, relieving the soil\xe2\x80\x99s stress. However, the\npenetrator did not maintain a straight vertical path, and struck the side of the column\n67.2 cm below the surface, or 2.6 cm into the 8% layer. We were unable to extract\nthe penetrator from the frozen soil after driving it in to its full depth. Figure 12 shows\nthe top surface (unfractured) with the rod still embedded in the icy regolith after the\npercussive penetrometer was de-attached.\n\nFigure 11. Depth of penetration and down-force versus time for 1-meter column.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\n\nFigure 12. Top surface of 1-meter column with embedded\npenetrometer rod.\nDISCUSSION\nIce Content\nIn general we find as expected that, in the range of 0% to 10% ice content by\nmass, the greater ice content is more resistant to penetration. However, it is\ninteresting that the top layer of can #4 with 6% ice could be penetrated, whereas the\nsecond layer of can #3 with only 5% ice could not be penetrated. Thus, we found that\nit is not simply the percentage of ice that matters, but whether the fracturing ice has\nroom to move into the surrounding volume. In the case of top layers, there was\nalways room at the free surface for fractured chunks of ice to move upward. In the\nsecond and deeper layers of the cans, the ice could not always fracture and move.\nThus, a lower percentage of ice at depth could resist penetration whereas a higher\npercentage of ice at the surface could not.\nThe mechanics are apparently different than the case of penetration into dry\nregolith. Dry regolith is free to rearrange at the grain-scale to make room for the\npenetrator. The strain field of cone penetration into ordinary, terrestrial sands and\nsoils has been studied in detail (see for example [Tumay at al, 1985] and [Acar and\nTumay, 1986]), indicating soil motion (of decreasing amplitude) at long distances\nfrom the cone. Furthermore, comminution of the individual grains allows their\nmaterial to move into the pore spaces between other grains, increasing the bulk\ndensity of the material around the penetrometer to make the room. For frozen soils,\nhowever, the grains cannot move individually, and comminuted material may not be\nable to move into pore spaces between neighboring grains. Therefore, to make room\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nfor a cone and rod, the frozen soil must exhibit a combination of pulverization with\npowder removal and fracturing with relative motion of the fractured domains. As\nlong as the cone is near the surface of the icy regolith, powder could exit the\ndownshaft around the sides of the rod, and likewise near the surface the fractured\ndomains could move upward above the free surface of the sample.\nFor the small sample cans with three layers of icy/soil mixture, when the ice\ncontent was sufficiently high the cone could not penetrate through the second layer\nbecause it was trapped between the overlying and underlying frozen layers. For\nsample cans #1 and #2 this was not a problem. Presumably the low ice content did\nnot stop the soil from deforming at the grain scale to densify within each layer, or to\npush into the neighboring layers that then deformed at the grain scale to absorb the\nadditional volume of material. Therefore, it appears that the transition in penetration\nmechanics occurs somewhere in the range of 3% to 5% ice content by mass.\nFor sample can #5 with 100% water ice, the soil did fracture but was able to\nrearrange all the way to the bottom of the can, permitting the penetrator to reach the\nbottom. Apparently, the ice has less friction than an ice/regolith mixture, and thus the\nfractured chunks even deep in the can are able to push the fractured chunks above\nthem out of the way.\nFor the case of the 1-meter column, the fractured domains could make room\nby expanding into the interleaving dry layers of regolith. A fractured domain\nexpanding into neighboring space would presumably experience more resistance if it\nwere moving into dry regolith than if it were moving into empty space above the free\nsurface of the sample, as was the case with the top layers of the smaller sample cans.\nHowever, the dry regolith did not produce enough resistance to stop this penetration\nas evidenced by the cone passing successfully through layers of up to 10% ice. To\nmake room for adjacent fractured domains, the dry regolith layers must have\ndensified through the ordinary processes discussed above for cone penetration.\nHowever, in this experiment only half the volume of the column was dry regolith\nwhereas the other half was icy. Half the domain must have been adequate to absorb\nthe full volume of the penetrating cone and rod.\nBased on these results, it is likely that bulk volumes of greater than 4-6% ice\n(by mass) will be resistant to percussive cone penetrometers unless a method is\ndeveloped to remove pulverized material. Fortunately, the instrument that will go\nonto the cone, which is being developed in the companion project, is capable of\ndetecting and measuring ice content at concentrations less than these values. Also,\nsince the percussive penetrometer can always penetrate at least the top few\ncentimeters of material higher than 4-6% (since the fractures can expand upward into\nthe material that has less ice), the system is guaranteed to enter at least that\nconcentration of ice even if no modifications are made. If the lunar ice lies beneath a\nmeter of desiccated soil, or soil that contains less than 4-6% ice, or layers less than a\nfew centimeters thick of any concentration interleaved by layers less than 4-6% ice,\nthen the system will successfully pass through it to the bulk quantities of more\nconcentrated ice. In any case, when it finds the bulk of the more concentrated ice, it\nshould penetrate several centimeters. Therefore, the delivery method appears to be\nsuccessful but with room for increased performance.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nPenetration Rate\nThe penetration rate was not a strong function of down-force. In most cases\nit was a strong function only of the ice content. Therefore, penetration rate may serve\nas a useful secondary measurement of ice content to corroborate what is measured by\nthe primary instrument. By comparing the primary instrument\xe2\x80\x99s findings with the\npenetration rate, it may also be possible to back out information about the compaction\nof the soil and thus the volume of pore space not occupied by frozen volatiles. This\nmay support analysis of the permeability of the regolith and modeling of ice stability\nand transport mechanisms.\nIt makes sense that penetration rate would be dependent on ice content. The\nice must be fractured or pulverized to permit movement of material to admit the cone.\nThe more volume ice there is bonding the soil grains together, the more energy that\nmust be expended to break those grains apart. Thus, more percussive blows are\nneeded to free equivalent volumes of regolith when there is more ice. Penetration\ncould be sped up by increasing the percussion rate, but (as seen with can #4) if the\nblows are incapable of moving material, then increasing their frequency will not\nrestore motion.\nOn the other hand, toward the bottom of the 1-meter column, increased\ndown-force did help penetration (see \xe2\x80\x9cDownload\xe2\x80\x9d curve in Fig. 11). This might be\nbecause the fracturing ice layers deep in the column needed to be mechanically\npushed into the neighboring volumes of dry regolith. Because the large chunks\nwould be moving dry regolith far away from the percussing cone, their motion relied\nupon the direct down-force. Thus, additional information is available by analyzing\nboth down-force and penetration rate together that may indicate the structure of ice\nlayers beneath the surface.\nRetracting the Rod\nIn the one test with the 1-meter column, the rod could not be retracted. This\nmay have been due to the fact that the rod became bent as it struck the wall of the\ncolumn, but other factors may have contributed. For example, the base diameter of\nthe cone is larger than the diameter of the rod, and compacted JSC-1a can exert high\nfriction on a rod that has been driven into it. There is also some concern that ice\ncould freeze to the cone or shaft. The instrument on the cone will have a heater\nelement to enable volatilization of the ice as a part of measuring its concentration.\nThe heater element could serve a secondary function of de-icing the regolith around\nthe cone or shaft to help free it. Also, the team has identified mechanical changes to\nthe design of the system to enable easier retraction.\nSummary of results\n1. A percussive cone can penetrate icy regolith at ice concentration layers that a\nstatic cone cannot penetrate. The percussive penetrator was able to penetrate\nmaterial under 65 N of down-force that the static cone could not penetrate under\nfull body weight.\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\n2. The percussive cone could penetrate:\na. 100% water ice (-60 C);\nb. dry soil that is compacted and cold (-60 C);\nc. ice/soil mixtures up to 4-6% ice by weight (note that 5% ice is more\nresistant than 100% ice) with much less resistance than non-percussive;\nd. mixtures with 6% and 8% ice as long as there is a free surface above the\nlayer to allow the icy chips room to move;\ne. a little more than a cone-length into the top surface of mixtures that have\n8% or more ice;\nf. completely through layers of 8% ice as long as they are interleaved with dry\nlayers to allow the icy chips room to move.\n3. These percentages of ice are within the range that can be detected by the sensor\ndeveloped in the companion project, \xe2\x80\x9cISDS for Water Detection on the Lunar\nSurface.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore, the system is capable of penetrating deeply enough into the\nregolith to detect ice.\n4. The ability of a percussive cone to displace material affects its ability to penetrate\nmaterial. The device proved capable of penetrating material with 8% ice, but did\nnot penetrate very far because it could not displace the resulting chip. A certain\namount of material must be displaced for the cone to advance.\n5. Increased down-force on the percussive system did not result in increased\npenetration capability. In hard material, the percussive penetrator made no more\nprogress under 750 N than it did under 65 N. This suggests that increasing the\nenergy delivered in each percussive blow would be a more effective than\nincreasing down-force for penetrating stronger materials. When the ice is too\ndense, pushing harder will not make it penetrate. The percussive system either\npenetrates or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n6. There may be cases with layers of ice interleaved by dry regolith in which\nincreased down-force helps move the fractured ice and thus increases penetration\nrate, but this condition is not the baseline expectation for lunar regolith. If such a\ncondition does exist on the Moon, then it can be detected by measuring both\npenetration rate and down-force to corroborate other instruments on the cone.\n7. A percussive cone can become stuck in frozen regolith. For anchoring, this is\nbeneficial. A rod driven in under 65N (15 lbs) of down-force could not be pulled\nout with at least that much force. For repeated probing, this must be addressed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis investigation successfully demonstrated percussive penetration of\nregolith with varying ice concentrations. It demonstrated that percussive penetration\nis feasible in situations where non-percussive is not. It successfully demonstrated\npenetration to a meter in depth, which is the expected depth to lunar ice. It\ndemonstrated that the device is capable of entering ice concentrations that are easily\nwithin the measurement range of instruments that will go on the cone. This serves as\n\nASCE Earth and Space Conference\nApril, 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Orlando, FL\nexperimental proof-of-concept of the critical function, and so percussive insertion of\nlunar ice instruments has now achieved Technology Readiness Level 3.\nThese experiments have developed preliminary correlation data between\npenetration rate and ice content, and thus the data from the penetration process can be\nused to corroborate the findings of another sensor. This project also produced\ninsights into the mechanics of the penetration resistance of ice and ice/soil mixtures.\nIt provided an opportunity to develop and test methods to prepare ice/soil mixtures\nfor mechanical testing. It provided insights into how to improve the test stands and\nhardware. It also indicated a number of modifications that may be made to improve\nthe penetration system, which will be the subject of on-going projects.\nREFERENCES\nAcar, Yalcin B., and Mehmet T.
