This is our primary focus. It is why we are pursuing\n0 PPM.\nAnd it is why Stahl has consistently received quality awards from such demanding customers as Caterpillar, Deco Grand and the Ridgid Tool Company.\nFor built-in quality, verified by the latest technology, call Stahl at 1-800-821-7852.\t\n\nKingsville, Missouri USA 64061 [816)597-3322 (8001821-7852 \r\nFax [816]591-3485 http://www.stahlspeciafly.com\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 530\n\n15 A.\n\n:iw& ,\n\n7 (11CW71 [I]\n4\n4\n\n4)\n"\n\n\'I\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\x94.\n\n.\n\nad\n\n4fII\n\n\t\n\nj1II1\n\n:u I!I vpvr\n\nlot\n\ntrraIIi1!!1\n___\t\n\nL1[111t!\n\niflhi7i75/k41\n\n-\n\nJJiri wInr\n;I Ii1\'ZI1\nLr iJIthiiJ\t\n\n\'r.mTi7i,i\n\n\t\n\n!IJIJI JUiU1 thJ JI 1iiuuiiijJ\n\n!JJfJJJ J :/\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTjl\nIJJ?1, JJ j .niJ i.i\n\nDC/DC Converters\nfor Space Applications\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\'iI flIlir\n\nConverter\nSMHF\n\nPower\n15 Watts\n\n3.3,5,12 or 15 single\n12 or 15 dual\n\n1.460 xl.130 x 0.330\n(3708 x 28.70s 8.38)\n\nClass H\t or K\nRed hard -3 levels\n\nInhibit\nSynchronization\n\n1.0750 10.75o 0.270\n(27.31 x 27.31 x 6.86)\n\nClass H\t or K\nRed hard -3 levels\n\nInhibit\n\n2.110 x 1.115 x 0.400\n(53.59028.32010.16)\n\nClass H\t or K\nRed hard -2 levels\n\nAttenuates\nSMHF and SMSA\nto MIL-STD-461C\nCE03 spec.\n\nFlanged (shown)\n\n2.005 x 1.130 x 0.330\n(50.93 x 28.70 x 8.38)\na.\n\nConverter\nSMSA\n\nPower\n5 Watts\n\nFilter\nSFMC\n\n5, 12 or 15 single\n12 or 15 dual\n\nThroughput\nCurrent\n2.7 Amps\n\nFlanged (shown)\n\n2.910x1.115o0.400\n(73.91 x 28.32 x 10.16)\n\n\\ 9C5\nI\t\nPer MILPnF.38534\t\n\nlnterpoint\xe2\x80\x94we\'ve been building\nDC/DC converters for 29 years.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Industry leader\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ISO 9000 facility\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Program Experience:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Class K, MTL-PRF38534 facility\n\nSpace Station Freedom\nSpace Shuttle\nMIR Space Station\nHubble Telescope\nand more\n\n(_.\n\nC)\n\n-feg\nC0\nSG\n\nwww.interpoint.com/tba\nAsk for your free space brochure or a complete catalog.\nNorth America\ne-mail: powert intp.com\n800-822-8782\n(fax: 425-882-1990)\nRedmond, Washington, USA\n\nInternational\ne-mail: poweruk@intp.com\n+44-1252-815511\n(fax: +44-1252-815571)\nFleet.

The answer is at the bottom of this\npage - you may be surprised.\nFor this simple situation, the force can\nbe approximated by working out an\nenergy balance. This approach will not\nwork, however, for real-world situations due to the difficulty in calculating\nthe stiffness.\nThe easy way to predict the result of\nthis or any impact problem is to use\nA1eor\' Accupak/VE Mechanical Event\n\nSimulation software for Virtual\nPrototyping. Model the bar and hammer head weight with Superdraw III or\nyour CAD system. Apply the dimensions and material properties in\nAccupak/VE and it will automatically\nrun the virtual experiment and generate\na replay showing the stresses and displacements at any or all instants during\nthe time of the event.\nAccupak/VE\'s Monitor virtual instrumentation program shows results\ngraphically during run time. The\nMonitor program can show displacement, velocity, acceleration, frequency\nresponse, reaction forces and maximum stresses versus time as the event\nunfolds. Also available is an on-board\nFF1\' (Fast Fourier Transform) analyzer\nthat converts displacement versus time\ninto frequency versus energy so design\nengineers can see the energy absorption spectrum of the model during the\nevent.\nFor more information on Accupak/VE\nfor Mechanical Event Simulation,\ncontact us or visit our website at\nww.akor.com .\n\nGet your free video and CD-ROM to see Algor\nsoftware in action by ordering from the web\xe2\x80\x94\nVideo includes all-new impact bar demonstration,\nplus action-packed, real-world examples demonstrated with Algor FEA.

New features of the software include a material data management\nsystem that replaces previous methods of storing and applying material data\nto a model. The system can he interfaced with other information sources for\nmaterial properties. New Windows-compliant interactive model data input\nscreens allow entering of FEA-specific model data and parameters. Users are\nnot required to complete the entire model geometr y before entering the\nFEA-specific model data. CAD interfacing improvements include the addition\nof an auto-shaded, solid display that improves mesh refinement capabilities on\nthe visible surface of a model. Each model is organized as a separate database,\nso a change to a model\'s input screen is reflected immediatel y in its database.\nFor More Information Circle No. 762\n\nA "Growing" Understanding of Diabetes\niabetics may be able to reduce\nD their insulin injections and lead\nmore normal lives because of new\ninsights gained through space research\nin which the largest insulin crystal,\never studied were grown on the Spa((\nShuttle.

Prior art devices\nincluded resolver or Hall-effect devices\nused in conjunction with two-phase\nbrushless motors. But a disadvantage of\nHall devices is that they do not always\nproduce clean and accurate sinusoidal\nwaveforms. This directly translates into\nrate error. A disadvantage of differentiating position data from resolvers is that\nit tends to be very noisy. The present system is a resolver rate sensor in which\ndual brushless resolvers are mechanically coupled to the same output shaft.\nDiverse inputs are provided to each\nresolver by providing the first with a DC\ninput and the second with an AC sintisoidal input. A trigonometric identity in\nwhich the sum of the squares of the sine\nand cosine components equals one is\nused to advantage in providing a sensor\nof increased accuracy.\nBevel Gear Driver and\nMethod Having Torque\nLimit Selection\n(U.S Patent No. 5,647,254)\n\nInventor: Joseph S. Cook, Jr.,\nJohnson Space Center\n\nPrior methods of applying torque to\nfasteners, such as nuts, screws, etc., do\nnot provide an uncomplicated mechanism that reliably holds the torque to a\nselectable limit. This invention provides\na method and apparatus for an improved tot-que-controlled driver. It has a\nhousing with a first shaft, supported by\nthe driver housing, whose axis extends\nlongitudinally through it. A first gear is\ncarried by this shaft for rotation about its\naxis. The first gear has teeth mounted\naround a circumferential portion of it. A\nsimilar second gear is disposed within\nthe housing for displacement in a direction having a component substantially\nparallel to the first shaft\'s axis. This gear\n\nmoves between an engaged and a disengaged position. A variable bias assembly\nis disposed substantially within the driver housing to bias the second gear\ntoward the engaged position. In operation, torque is transferred from the first\nto the second gear and to the fastener.\nAn angled tooth profile on one of the\ngears produces a separating force\nbetween the gears during the transfer of\ntorque. A desired limit for torque to be\napplied to the fastener is selected from a\nrange provided on the driver. The first\ngear is rotated to apply torque to the second gear and the fastener until the separating force overcomes the selected\nbias and separates the gears.\nSystem and Method for\nModeling the Flow\nPerformance Features\nof an Object\n(U.S. Patent No. 5,649,064)\nInventors: Charles Jorgensen and\nJames Ross, Ames Research Center\n\nA neural network is used to generate a\nmodel of the flow performance features\nof an object in a wind tunnel from performance data on the object. Initial pairs\nof test input signals or conditions (flap\npositions, slat positions, deflection\nangles, stabilizer position, roll, pitch, and\nyaw positions) and test output conditions\n(lift, drag, side-force, pitching moment,\nyawing moment, and rolling moment)\nare used to train the neural network. As\nwind tunnel testing proceeds, the network learns a complete static aerody\n-namicodelfthbj.Bcause\nmodel is generated simultaneously with\nthe testing procedure, it can be immediately used to dynamically adjust the procedure to focus on interesting points.\nFor example, the model can be used to\ndetermine optimal geometric configurations of maximum lift, high alpha performance, or other flight performance\nfeatures. The invention can also be\napplied in other similar flow-modelling\napplications in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and other such disciplines: for\nexample, the testing of cars, sails, foils,\npropellers, keels, rudders, and turbines.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the appropriate NASA Field \r\nCenter\'s Commercial Technoiog,y Office.

Landsat\'s remote sensing data, computer-processed into tapes and images, enables differentiation among a variety of Earth features, and allows Earth\nprocesses to be monitored for changes over time.\nLandsat, now operated on a commercial basis, has provided\nresource management benefits to thousands of businesses in\nareas such as agrictdtiiial iilvrnloiv. oil mid niiiiitml )rc&\'siimg,\nwildlifepreservation, charting\nsources of fresh\nwater, monitoring air and water\npollution, and\nstudying floods.\nAnother benefit\nis the Landsatspawned inditstr\ndevoted to the\ncommercial . 1 1)-\t\nplications of mcmote sens\nInternational\nImaging Systems enhances a Landsat image to include geographic\n(PS) of Milpitas. coordinates.\nCA, is one of\nthose spinoff companies. A manufacturer of equipment and software for image processing, PS developed its initial equipment in\n1975, with the help of NASA, to process Landsat data for Earth\nresources management. The company continued to work with\nsix NASA centers, and has sold thousands of systems for processing Landsat data.\nWorking with NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center, PS\ndeveloped meteorological analysis systems that led to sales of\nhardware and software to NASA. In addition, hospitals are\nusing the systems to develop special software for presenting\ncross-section and 3D body images for diagnostic purposes.\nAnother company that was spun out of the Landsat programim\nis Delta Data Systems (DDS) of Pica y une, MS, formed by a\ngroup of former NASA and industry engineers experienced in\ndesigning hardware and software for digital image processing\nsystems. The company also adapted a NASA-developed computer program into its ATLAS software system.\nDDS President Ferron Risinger is a former systems\nanalyst for the NASA Earth Resources Lab, and former\nproject leader at NASA\'s Ames Research Center for installations of the NASA-developed software called ELAS (Earth\nResources Laboratory Applications Software). ELAS was\nused as the shell for the company\'s ATLAS geographic\ninformation system, and was used to process satellite and\n24\t\n\naircraft data, digitize soil and topographic maps, and generate land use maps.\nRisinger estimated that the use of the NASA-developed software saved the company an additional four man-years that\nwould have been spent developing the 100 application modules in the ATLAS system.\n\nr\nMayor Harold R. Lee of Haughton, LA, was notified in 1985\nthat his town\'s wastewater treatment facility violated environmental protection standards. Add-on modifications to its actisated sludge facility would cost $1.2 million. That\'s when NASA\ntechnology came to the rescue.\nThe mayor had read about research conducted b y Dr. Billy\nC. Wolverton, then head of the Environmental Research Lab at\nNASA\'s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Wolverton\'s work\ninvolved natural water purification using aquatic plants to\nremove pollutants from wastewater at a low cost. Haughton\nofficials visited a test site for Wolverton\'s artificial marsh filtering system, and decided that the NASA technology would allow\nthe town to develop a wastewater treatment facilit y at less than\none-third the cost of improving the old system.\nThe resulting facility is an 11-acre sewage lagoon with a 70 x\n900-foot artificial marsh called a vascular aquatic plant/microbial filter cell in which microorganisms and rooted aquatic\nplants combine to absorb and digest wastewater pollutants,\nconverting sewage effluents to relatively clean water. The raw\nwastewater flows from the lagoon over a rock bed populated by\nmicrobes that digest nutrients and minerals from the sewage.\nThe facility went on line in 1987; a year later, the town\nreduced its sewer user fees by 25 percent. The new facilit y easily met the more stringent wastewater cleaning standards.\nToday, a number of southern U.S. towns with populations ranging from 2.000 to 15,000 people employ the Stennis aquaculture techniques as their year-round primary method of wastewater treatment. The Stennis techniques, unlike other similar\non water Irvacinths to absorb and metabolize\ns\\sliitis, fin mis\npollutants from\na-.tewater.

Wolverton has developed the first combined indoor\nwastewater treatment/air purification system employing\ncommon houseplants.\nThe plants absorb harmful gases and chemical compounds\nto purify home or office air and water. Wastewater from the\nbathroom and fumes from the kitchen are pumped into a living room filtration system of plants such as ferns, ficus, and\nphilodendrons, that is reinforced by activated carbon filters.\nThe wastewater is used as water fertilizer for the plants. The\nfirst public building to use the systern is a math and science\ncomplex at Northeast Mississippi Community College in\nBooneville. The system routes ventilation air through a twostory atrium equipped with filter boxes of plants, clay, and\ncharcoal.

Through a\ncombined use of techniques and software, the ERL scientists\nwere able to input, study, and identify hundreds of data points\nof a particular location on Earth.\nThey assisted users in finding practical applications for the\nremotely sensed data, including farmers, geologists, city and\nstate planners, environmental monitors, fishermen, firefighters, foresters, law enforcement officers, road builders, and\narchaeologists. In 1987, a new remote sensing program was\nput in place at Stennis that better fit the growing trend toward\nentrepreneurship beginning to blossom in the business coinmllnitv. The program has since evolved into the CRSP.\n\nThe Current Program\nStennis was named NASA\'s lead center fbr commercial\nremote sensing in April 1997. The lead center role originally\nwas in support of the Mission to Planet Earth Enterprise,\nwhich was renamed Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) in April\nof this year. One of four strategic enterprises of NASA, ESE\nfocuses on a long-term coordinated research effort to study\nthe total Earth system and the effects of natural and human-\n\n28\t\n\ninduced changes to the global environment. CRSP\'s lead center role supports the development of a commercial remote\nsensing industry that can contribute to long-term ESE strategic goals - to expand scientific knowledge of the Earth s ystem using NASA\'s unique vantage points of space, aircraft,\nand in situ platforms; creating an international capability to\nforecast and assess the health of the Earth system; to widely\ndisseminate information about the Earth system; and to\nenable the productive use of Earth science results and related\ntechnology in the public and private sectors.\nMany commercial companies already use remotely sensed\ninformation to develop their products. These companies can\nform partnerships with data producers, value-added\nproviders, and remote-sensing customers and submit proposals to the Earth Observations Commercial Applications\nProgram (EO(AP). If chosen, a company and its business\npartners join with NASA in demonstrating the market effectiveness (if new products.\n\nNew Opportunities\nNASA is extending LOCAP partnership experience\nthrough two recent projects - EOCAP-SAR (Synthetic\nAperture Radar) and EOCAP-Hperspectral. These projects,\ncach structured in a three-phase approach, are designed to\ndemonstrate the commercial viability of specific remote sensing technologies. Participation in either project must involve\ndevelopment teams headed by private-sector companies. All\ncategories or organizations are in vited to participate, as long\nas a for-profit industry partner acts as the principle investigator responsible for commercial development and implementation of the project.\nSince the launch of the U.S. SeaSat spacecraft in 1978, the\n\nsvisw.nasatech.coni\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1998\n\n\t\n\niF iLs M\t\n\nt.\n\nThe next revolution in space technologies is already underway D\nat the Air Force Research Laboratory.

Alyeska operates the 800-mile-long\npipeline, through which more than 20% of the United\nStates\' domestic oil production flows. Alveska currently uses\na variety of leak detection technologies to identify possible\nspills at or below the levels required by regulations. The\nagreement will include the investigation of technologies that\ncan provide remote-sensing detection of oil releases below\nthe present leak detection threshold. Alyeska had launched\nan initiative last summer that solicited both private and public firms to present available technologies to detect leaks as\nsmall as ten gallons. When none of the submitted systems\nmet the company\'s specifications for the futuristic pipeline\nmonitoring system they envisioned, Alyeska looked at ways\nof putting one or more of them together to make an operational system. JPL\'s Joan Horvath, who has been working\nwith the Alaska Technology Transfer Center, thought that "a\nlot of our instruments for close-up studies of Mars and\nEuropa, a moon ofJupiter, might have some applicability for\nAlyeska\'s issues." The two parties came together, resulting in\nthe agreement.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transamerica Real Estate Information Companies (TREIC)\nof Dallas, TX, has created a new business unit, TerraPoint"\nLLC, a compan y combining the business expertise of\nTransamerica with the technologies of NASA\'s Goddard Space\nFlight Center and the Houston Advanced Research Center\n(HARC). Based in The Woodlands, TX, TerraPoint will proide customers with digital, topographic data generated by\nlaser technology, rather than by microwave and photographic\n\ntechnologies. The laser technology combines Goddard and\nHARC\'s laser ranging, global positioning systems, and mapping software into a miniaturized package that can be mounted in a light aircraft. Potential commercial uses include flood\nplain mapping, pipeline and utility surveys, highway design\nsimulations, shoreline and erosion surveys, river cross-sections\nfor hydrologic modeling, and forest/ biodiversity/habitat\nassessments. The technology can operate in a range of\nday/night, weather, and vegetation conditions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA Goddard also is involved in the ongoing\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nsystem with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA). The GOES project satellites carry\ninstruments that provide half-hour or near-continuous observations of Earth. A new generation of satellites, GOES I\nthrough GOES M, are now a key element in the modernization of NOAA\'s National Weather Service. NASA Goddard is\nresponsible for the procurement, development, and verification testing of the spacecraft, instruments, and ground equipment for the project. The GOES I-M system serves the central\nand eastern Pacific Ocean: North, Central, and South\nAmerica; and the central and western Atlantic Ocean. This\nnew series of satellites provides half-hourly radiometric observations to fill the need for continuous, dependable, timely,\nand high-quality observations of Earth and its environment.\nProcessed data are received at the National Weather Service\nforecast offices across the U.S., and at the National Centers for\nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) in Camp Springs, MD. The\nGOES products also are used by universities, the Department\nof Defense, NASA, and the global research community. The\nmost recent satellite, GOES-K, was launched on April 25, 1997.\nGOES-L is scheduled for launch in March 1999.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefc, August 1998\n\nPRIM\t\n\nEJ\n\nEfficient and Versatile\nHeat Exchangers for\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Space Simulators\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wind Tunnels\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Jet Engine and Rocket Engine Test Stands\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sub-zero Cooling of Superconductive Materials\nTrariter, inc. supplies efficient and flexible\nPLATECOIL prime surface heat exchangers for a\nwide variety of space age projects\xe2\x80\x94from large and\nsmall solar simulator space chambers, to components\nfor jet and rocket engine test stands, to heat exchange\nsurfaces for helium cryopumping, to bell jar shrouds.\nTranter produces these special space-oriented\nheat exchangers in a large, dedicated location at\nits Wichita Falls, TX facility.\nThese outstanding heat exchangers can be supplied\nwith grit blasted and blackened interior surfaces for\n\nlow emissivity and high absorptivity to enhance\nacceptance of radiation from test objects.

Basic NanoLaser Configuration.\n\nsince the laser was innted in 1960, large-scale\ntumercial applications for\ner technology have been\nnature of the lasers themselves. In general, they have not only\nbeen large, inefficient, and very expensive, but have also required a high level\nof maintenance and tender loving care\nto maintain their performance. As a consequence, only the helium-neon and the\ndiode lasers have experienced sales in\nexcess of a few thousand units per year.\nBut even these lasers have their drawbacks. Helium-neon lasers are low in\ncost and exhibit excellent beam quality;\nhowever, they are inefficient, their size\ngrows dramatically with increasing output power, and they are relatively fragile.\nDiode lasers are small, inexpensive, and\nrobust but generally exhibit relatively\npoor beam quality.\nToday, NanoLasers\'\xe2\x80\x94monolithic diodepumped, passively Q-switched solid-state\nmicrochip lasers\xe2\x80\x94closely approach the\nideal. These new devices produce highintensity, linearly polarized laser light\nwith superb beam quality in a variety of\nwavelengths ranging from the infrared\nto the ultraviolet\xe2\x80\x94all from small, extremely rugged, maintenance-free modules that can be manufactured in high\nvolume at very low cost. In 1995 Uniphase Corporation, a leading manufacturer of helium-neon and air-cooled\nargon-ion lasers for OEM applications,\nand Daniel Guillot, formerly president\nof Uniphase Laser Division, formed a\njoint venture, Nanolase SA, to develop\nthis new technology commercially.\nI\n\n6a\t\n\nORIGINS OF\nTHE TECHNOLOGY\n\nurable absorber on a YAG wafer using liquid-phase epitaxy. In the NanoLaser,\nthese steps are combined, as shown in\nFigure 1, to make the device shown in\nFigure 2. The pulse repetition rate of the\nNanoLaser is determined by the diode\npumping power: The higher the pumping power, the faster the absorber saturates and becomes transparent, and the\nhigher the resulting pulse rate.\nSince Q-switching is always initiated at\nexactly the same intracavity energy densitv, pulse energy is independent of\np i lip I er and repetition rate, but is\ndirectly proportional to the\nthickness of the saturable\nabsorber (assuming constant\n(r4 doping). Finally, pulse\nwidth is determined primariiv by the cavity\'s round-trip\ntime. The shorter the overall\nlaser cavity, the shorter the\nround-trip time, resulting in\npulse widths that are routinely less than a nanosecond.\nPulse energies as high as\n100 pJ, pulses as short as 218\nps, average powers as high as 120 mW,\nand pulse repetition rates as high as 75\nkHz have been demonstrated in the laboratory in various laser configurations.\nAt pulse repetition rates below 15 kHz,\nthe laser pulses are extremely uniform,\nand by carefully controlling the diode\npump laser, pulse-to-pulse timing jitter\ncan be kept below 0.5%.\nThe high peak intensity of the short\npulses generated by the NanoLaser, coupled with the extremely short optical\ncavity geometry, makes it an ideal candidate for harmonic generation. Second,\nthird, and fourth harmonics can be generated simply by sliding the appropriate\nnonlinear cr ystals directly against the\ny\nlaser cavit itself (Figure 3). Focusing op-\n\nThe technique of passive Q-switching\nis well understood. A saturable absorber\nin a laser cavity prevents lasing until the\nenergy within the cavity reaches a critical\nvalue. The onset of lasing produces a\nhigh intracavity optical field that quickly\nbleaches the absorber, increasing the\noptical quality of the cavity and resulting\nin a Q-switched optical pulse.\nIn 1993 John J . Zayhowski and his colleagues at MIT\'s Lincoln Laboratory\nbonded a thin, flat wafer of Nd:YAG\ngain medium to a similar saturable\nabsorber wafer of Cr:YAG. This composite structure was then coated with dielectric mirrors and diced into 1\nwith approximately a I x I\nmm2 cross section. Coupling light from a diode\nlaser into the cavity resulted in a train of subnanosecond infrared laser\npulses at 1.06 mm. The\nsimplicity of this monolithic passively Q-switched\nmicrochip laser and the\nsmall amount of material\nrequired to make it gave It\nthe potential to be manufactured at low cost and\nhigh volume, as well as an\ninherent robustness and\nreliability.\nAt about the same time.\na group from CEA/Leti in\nFrance developed a method of depositing a sat- Figure 3, Harmonic Generation in NanoLsers\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nAugust 1998\n\n0\n2_i.\n\nA\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSingle Photon sensitivity\t\n\n7S\n\n4\n\nFiberoptic and lens mounting\nThermoelectric & air cooled convenience\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Modern sealed design - no gas flushing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spectroscopy or imaging options for Laser Ablation,\nCombustion, Fluorescence Lifetime, TR 3 or FIlM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCompact Solid State Design\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High Speed PCI Interface and 32-bit software\nICCD Photothod.

With sufficiently short laser pulses and very fast\nelectronics, spatial resolution of one foot can be achieved. Due to compromises\nbetween speed and power consumption, spatial resolution on the X-33 sensor\nis limited to one meter.\nThe NanoPulse laser was selected because of its small size, robustness, and\nability to produce subnanosecond laser pulses, In the DTS system, the laser is\nmounted directly on a VME card that will be exposed to shock and random vibration of 12.5 G and temperature variation of-30 to +80 degrees centigrade. Since\nthe system will be operated in a vacuum, the lasers ability to be fully conduction-cooled is critical.\nFor more information on distributed-temperature-measurement systems, Contact Leif Fredin at (512) 479-7732, E-mail at fredin@spec.com , or visit the SPEC\nweb site at http:/lvvwwspec.com .

Furthermore, the beam quality of a NanoUV system is dramatically better than that of a\npulsed nitrogen laser.\nNonetheless, it is the very short pulse\nwidth of these lasers that will enable\nmany new and successful commercial\napplications Many pulsed laser applications are much more dependent upon\npeak pulse power than on average power\nor overall pulse energy. Since most\nactively Q-switched pulsed lasers exhibit\npulse widths of between 10 and 50 ns,\nthe I-ns pulse of a NanoLaser will have\nup to 50 times the peak power of a conventional Q-switched laser with the same\npulse energy, and it will often do the job\nof a much larger, more expensive, and\nless reliable system. Furthermore, because of the short pulse width, the heataffected zone will be much narrower,\nreducing collateral damage on the work\npiece. NanoLasers can photoablate most\nabsorbing materials, including metals,\nsemiconductors, glasses, and biological\ntissues. At MIT, Zayhowski was able to\ncut 5-pm lines cleanly in the metallization on semiconductor wafers and to\ndrill holes through the substrate.\nAs mentioned above, the high peak\npulse power facilitates harmonic generation, and the UV output generated by\n\nthe NanoUV systems enables a broad\nbase of new applications, particularly in\nthe areas of environmental monitoring\nand remote sensing. Not only is LTV\nlight the optimum measurement wavelength for many of these applications, it\nis also an excellent source for generating time-resolved and UV-Raman spectra for on-line process control, since the\nfluorescence that plagues most Raman\nmeasurements is far removed from the\nsignal.\nIn medical and biological applications, these NanoUV lasers have a bright\nfuture in diagnostic applications such\nas capillary cataphoresis and DNA sequencing, drawing on the natural tendency of biological materials to fluoresce in the UV. The short pulses are\nalso well suited to such emerging applications as diffuse optical tomography as\nwell as existing applications in ranging\nand micro-LIDAR.\n\nINTO THE FUTURE\nNanoLaser technology is still in its\ninfancy, and rapid advances are being\nmade in output power, pulse energ y , and\npackaging. Current NanoLaser models\nare specified at 3 pJ at 1.06 pm, at 6 m\nat 532 rim, or at 1 mW at either 355 nm\nor 266 rim. Tens of milliwatts of average\n\nIJV power have been demonstrated in\nthe laboratory, however, and Uniphase\nplans to offer a product with more than\n5 mW of output at 266 nm before the\nend of the year. Other plans include\nfiber-coupling the diode laser pump into\nthe laser head to reduce the overall head\nsize to a few cubic centimeters, which\nwill simplify many process-control applications by avoiding the need to transmit\nUV output through a fiber. Lasers will\nalso be provided with pulse-on-demand\nfor triggered applications. NanoLaser\ntechnology is not limited to YAG lasers.\nWork on other materials, including\nerbium/glass, is progressing, holding\nout the promise of an eye-safe 1.5-pm\nNanoLaser in the near future.\nThe future of laser technology lies in\nthe development of small, high-power,\ninexpensive solid-state lasers with beam\nquality at least equal to that of the traditional gas lasers like helium-neon,\nhelium-cadmium and argon-ion lasers.\nNanoLaser technology will be a significant part of that future.\nFor more information, contact the author\nof this article, Torn Babcock, the Product\nManager for NanoLaser Products at Il/niphase Corporation in San Jose, CA.

Already virtuall y all have had job\noffers, some more than one. But offsetting that good news, as Robert Novak, the\nlongtime chairman of the optical systems technology department at MCC, points\nout, this number will not even satis local needs for optical technicians.\nThe graduating class is the first in a new program spearheaded by Lawrence\nLivermore National Laborator y (LLNL) in California. Livermore will soon\nbegin construction of the 192-beam $1.2-billion laser for the National Ignition\nFacility (NIF), the Department of Energy\'s center for inertial confinement\nfusion and high-energy-density scientific research. The NIF laser will be the\nworld\'s largest optical instrument, requiring more than 7000 large\xe2\x80\x94greater\nthan two feet diagonally\xe2\x80\x94optical components and more than 15,000 small ones.\nMeanwhile optics companies nationwide are suffering from a shortage of trained\noptical technicians, whether their work is scientific, militar y, or commercial.\nI LNL chose Monroe because of its well-established and highly regarded twoar curriculum in optics technology. MCC agreed to add to that a related singic-vear course focused on the machinery and methods of optical fabrication.\nThe laboratory is providing MCC with tools and equipment worth hundreds of\nthousands of dollars for use in the training program. According to David Aikens,\nan optics manufacturing manager for the NIF, MCC was chosen because of the\nexcellence of its existing facilities and faculty, its close ties to precision optics\ncompanies in the Rochester area, and the national reputation of its optics program. LLNL may also suppl y guest lecturers in photonics disciplines.\n"The optics program at MCC has been a leader in delivering training and education to LLNL\'s industrial partners and to other local and nationall y based\noptics firms for many years," Aikens said. "The close relationship to these cornpanics in the future will he crucial to the success of the program."\nI.LNL is joined by the 86-member American Precision Optics Manufacturers\'\n\\\'sociation (APOMA) in supporting the new certificate program: Rochestermembers have made about $400,000 in in-kind contributions to\nthe\nFurther support came from what might seem an unexpected source. Last\n\\ovember, LOH Optikmaschinen AG of Wetzlar, Germany, donated to the colan SPM/SPS 20 Spheronorm spherical generator and polisher system, so\nthat MCC students could receive hands-on computer-numerical-controlled\n(,NC) equipment training in the college\'s optical fabrication laboratory. More\ni entiv LOH, an APOMA member, donated a state-of-the-art SPM 50SL gener.0 r and SPS 50SL polisher, bringing the total value of the company\'s gifts to\nlj)proximately half million dollars.\n\\ICC\'s optical science technology facult y still teach students the conventional\nmanual process for producing lenses, but with the LOH equipment students also\nlearn how to use CNC equipment, a key skill for today\'s technicians. In February,\nManfred Hanisch, LOH\'s manager of process engineering, came to MCC and\nprovided advanced training to the faculty, demonstrating that generating a\nspherical lens with the SPM/SPS systems would take only five to six minutes.\n"We can now provide CNC-trained technicians, and the y are a hot commodity," Novak said. "It\'s extremely difficult to find such well-trained technicians, particularly in CNC technology.

These filters would\nfunction at both visible and infrared\nwavelengths. Whereas liquid-crystal tunable optical filters now on the market\nexhibit efficiencies of 20 percent or less,\ntheoretical calculations predict that the\nefficiencies of the proposed tunable surface-plasmon filters could exceed 60\npercent in some cases.\nFigure 1 schematically illustrates one\nof two types of the proposed filters. A\nthin film of a suitable electro-optical\nmaterial (for example, a liquid crystal)\nwould be sandwiched between two highindex-of-refraction prisms coated with\nthin metal films at the prism/electrooptical-film interfaces. If p-polarized\nwhite light were to impinge on this\ndevice at a certain angle (denoted the\nsurface-plasmon angle), then the energies of some of the incident photons\nwould be converted into collective\nmotions of free electrons in the upper\nmetal film. Because of the thinness of\nthe electro-optical film, the optical field\nwould penetrate the film and excite the\nsame collective motion of electrons in\nthe lower metal film. As a result, light\nwould be transmitted in the sense that it\nwould be re-radiated from the bottom.\nOnly the photons at the surface-plasmon\nresonance frequency could generate surface plasmon waves and could thereby\nbe coupled through the thickness to\ncontribute to the transmitted light; consequently, the transmitted light would be\ncolored.\nThe surface-plasmon resonance frequency would depend on the indices of\nrefraction of both the metal film and the\nliquid crystal or other electro-optical\nmaterial. If a voltage were applied to\ncontrol the index of refraction of the\nelectro-optical material, then the voltage\nwould control surface-plasmon resonance frequency and thus the spectrum\nof the transmitted light.\nFor example, theoretical calculations\nwere performed for a device like that of\nFigure 1 comprising TiO prisms with\n450 angles, silver films 35 urn thick, and\na 150-nm-thick electro-optical film made\nof a recently developed liquid crystal,\nthe index of refraction of which can be\nmade to shift as much as 0.5. According\nto the calculations, with no voltage\napplied to the silver films, the device\nwould exhibit peak transmission at a\nwavelength of 450 nm (blue), with an\n18a\t\n\nWhite Light\n\nApplied\nVoltage\nPrism\n\nReflected\nColor Light\n\nElectro-Optical Material\n(Liquid Crystal)\t\nPrism\n\'\t\nThin Metal\t\nFilms\t\n\nTransmitted\nColor Light\n\nFigure 1.

With enough\nvoltage applied to shift the index of\nrefraction by 0.5, the peak of the transmission spectrum would be shifted to\n650 nm (red), and the efficiency would\nbe 70 percent.\nIf a metal other than silver were used,\nthe device could be made to work in\ninfrared light. For example, if the silver\nfilms in the device described in the preceding paragraph were replaced with\npotassium films, then the wavelength of\npeak transmission could be made to\nrange from 1,050 to 1,700 nm.\nA proposed tunable surface-plasmon\noptical filter of the second type would\n\nalso include pi-isms partly coated with\nthin metal films (see Figure 2), but there\nwould be no electro-optical film with a\nvoltage applied to control its index of\nrefraction. Instead, an airgap would be\nleft between the metal films, and the distance between the prisms would be varied to vary the airgap and thereby vary\nthe surface-plasmon resonance frequency. A practical device of this type could\nbe made from sheets of microprisms,\nwith piezoelectric spacers for varying the\nairgap.\nThis work was done &v Yu Wang of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

However, because these systems\nuse either sophisticated liquid crystal\nlight valves, CCD detectors, and/or a\ncomputer to perform Fourier transforms, they do not meet the low-cost\nrequirement.\nThe proposed optical correlator\nuses highly efficient photorefractive\npolymers developed at the University\nof Arizona. These materials are at\nthe cutting edge in plastics research\nand are promising for several applications, including holographic storage, optical processing, phase conjugation, and imaging. In the pro-posed optical correlation system the\nphase mask used is a 64-x-64-pixel\nbinary random pattern. To authenticate the document it is compared with a\nmaster that is an exact copy. The hologram written by the interference of a reference beam and a laser beam going\nthrough the test mask forms a holographic filter for the master mask. If the\ntwo phase patterns match, light will be\nstrongly diffracted by the photorefractive polymer. The figure shows the intensity distribution of the signal that is\nproduced by two matching masks.

Otherwise, the\nbonding between atoms across the interface of the components will be irregular\nand weak. As a result, the films can peel\noff, crack, or contain a large density of\ncrystalline defects. With such an approach, multila yer films are limited to\ncases where the lattice mismatch is on\nthe order of 1 or 2 percent at the maximum. This constraint of close lattice\nmatching limits the combination of\nmaterials that can be mated together,\nand therefore limits the diversity of\ndevices that can be achieved. The ability\nto fuse together highly lattice-mismatched materials can open up a multitude of possibilities for device engineers.\nAn important shortcoming in the conventional approach to heteroepitaxial\ngrowth is that the chemical interaction,\ni.e., the bonding between component\n\n.-........\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n.\xe2\x80\xa2.\t\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn example of the Heteroepitaxial Structure is schematically illustrated in the figure. The circles represent different atoms of various sizes and in different crystalline structures. The bottom four rows\nrepresent a silicon substrate, the middle single row an interfacial "template" containing barium\natoms, and those at the top a barium fluoride thin film. In this heterostructure, the silicon and the\nbarium fluoride retain their normal crystalline structure. Strains arising from differences (15 percent)\nin lattice spacing between the BaFI and the Si, exaggerated by the arrows, is taken up by the barium\nlayer at the interface. Without the intervening template layer, lattice mismatches of more than one\nor two percent will adversely affect the crystal structure of the thin film. The dielectric strength of the\nBaFI thin film is close to that of the bulk crystal.\n\nlasers are built. These devices are usually\nbuilt on wafers about 0.015-in, thick.\nEven so, the materials being actively used\noccupy only a small thickness near the\nsurface of the substrate. The rest of the\nwafer is used simply to provide mechanical support. Therefore a successful thinfilm technology can provide substantial\nsavings in materials and processing costs.\nIn addition, a successful thin-film technology will allow rapid development of\n\nnew electronic and E-O devices by passing over the more expensive approach of\nbulk crystal development. Furthermore,\nwith a multilayer thin film, the desirable\nproperties of each of the layers can be utilized in a single integrated package.\nMultifunction devices can be made during the manufacturing process, complete\nwith packaging; assembly of discrete components into functional units can thus be\nbypassed completely.

Thus, an\nimportant factor in the film deposition\nprocess is not exploited to advantage.\nThe Dahlgren group has adopted a contrary approach in which the chemical\ninteraction is taken into account. In\naddition, this interaction is capitalized\non further to create a structure favorable\nto the subsequent growth of single-crystalline films on the substrates. The basic\nidea is similar to the use of an "atomic\nglue," which can bond with a variety of\nmaterials. An important criterion for\nthis glue, for applications in the making\nof multilayer crystalline films, is that it\nmust he compliant. That means it must\nbe easily deformable in the lateral direction so that strains resulting from the\nmismatch of atomic spacings will be\naccommodated by the glue, allowing the\ndeposited material to adopt its natural\nlattice spacing.\nThis new method for making epitaxial\nfilms was developed by the molecular\nbeam epitaxy (MBE) process, in conjunction with in-situ surface analysis and exsitu film characterization methods. In the\nMBE process, single-crystal substrates are\nplaced in a vacuum chamber where they\nare exposed to a beam (or beams) of\natoms or molecules evaporated from\nheated sources. The thin film is formed\non the substrate surface when the incident atoms coalesce into crystals. The\nmethod developed has yielded highly\nreproducible results. In fact, recipes have\nbeen generated for the preparation of a\nvariety of thin-film combinations. These\ninclude barium fluoride on silicon and\non gallium arsenide, lead telluride and\ncadmium telluride on silicon, and a gallium arsenide/barium fluoride/gallium\narsenide sandwich. The lattice mismatch\nin these combinations goes as high as\npercent. Mismatch of this magnitude was\npreviously considered fatal for epitaxial\ngrowth using the conventional approach\nto heteroepitaxial thin films.\nThe technology developed here is\ngeneric, and thus has wide application\npotential. The multilayer films are now\nbeing used as substrate materials for the\nmaking of gallium and aluminum nitride\nfilms. This technology is being transitioned to small business to make monolithic low-cost infrared focal plane arrays\nfor applications in surveillance and temperature/fire detection.\nThis work was carried out at the Naval\nSurface Warfare Center, Dahigren Division, S\'stems Research and Technology\nDepartment, Dahigren, VA 22448.

Unlike a\n\nmonolithic cavity, it would be somewhat adjustable.\n\nA typical semimonolithic structure\n("cavity") of the proposed type would\ninclude a nonlinear optical crystal fitted with optical components of glass or\nother suitable linear optical material on\nboth ends (see figure). The glass chosen for this application must have an\nindex of refraction as close as possible\nto that of the nonlinear crystal. The\ncurved end mirrors of the cavity (cavity mirrors," for short) would not be fabricated on the nonlinear crystal as in a\nmonolithic cavity; instead, the cavity mirrors would be fabricated on the glass\nendpieces. The second-harmonic output\ncould be extracted from the cavity\'\nthrough one of the cavity mirrors or\nthrough a dichroic beam splitter.\nIn a monolithic cavity, if any error\noccurs in fabrication of the cavity-mirror\nsurfaces, or if the apices of these curved\nsurfaces are not exactly coaligned, then\nthe entire piece of nonlinear mates-ial\nmust be discarded or completely\nreworked. In a semimonolithic cavity\nlike the one proposed here, one could\nreplace the glass endpieces or make\nsmall corrections on them. The polishing and coating characteristics of optical\nglasses and the techniques for fabricating mirror surfaces on them are well\nknown.

In thus freeing the\ncavity designer from limitations on the\navailable size of the nonlinear crystal,\nthe semirnonolithic cavity would offer a\nmajor advantage.\nOne disadvantage of the semimonolithic cavity would lie in the potential for\noptical losses that occur at the multiple\nsurfaces traversed by the laser beam.\nSome of these surfaces could be antireflection-coated to reduce losses. The\npolished surfaces at the ends of the nonlinear crystal and the facing surfaces of\nthe glass blocks could be formed at the\nBrewster angle to reduce losses further.\nThis work was done b Ha raid Heininati\nof Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory and funded under the AITP\nProgram.

This springback\nability can compensate for hardware changes due to extreme\npressure and temperature variations. These seals also feature\nsuperior static sealing performance for the most demanding\napplications.\nThe low seating load of the Wills\nRings\xc2\xae C results in a size and\nweight reduction of the mating\nhardware. In addition, the system\npressure energizes the seal profile to enhance the leak-tight seal\nperformance.

In\ncomparison with currently available\nborescopes and endoscopes, MDBRs\nwould be more versatile, more controllable, and better able to maneuver\naround obstacles. The MDBRs would differ from the serpentine inspection robots reported previously in NASA Tech\nBriefs [see "Small, Lightweight Inspection Robot With 12 Degrees of Freedom" (NPO-19367) Vol. 20, No. 2 (February 1996), page 73 and "Control of a\nSerpentine Robot for Inspection Tasks"\n(NPO-19506) Vol. 20, No. 3 (March\n1996), page lb.]\nEach link in an MDBR contains linear\nactuators that are part of a kinematic\nlinkage for controlling the relative orientations of the adjacent links. The\nkinematic linkage (see Figure 2) includes a base plate at one end and an articulation plate at the other end. The\nbase and articulation plates also serve as\nthe articulation and base plates, respectively, of the preceding and following\nlinks. The base and articulation plates\nare connected by six struts with compensated universal joints at their ends.\nThree of the struts are of fixed length\nand are crossed; three of the struts are\nthe linear actuators and are not\ncrossed. Together, the six struts and the\nbase and articulation plates constitute a\ntruss with a unique configuration and a\nhigh strength-to-weight ratio.

VIGILANTE serves as a test\nbed for generic automatic-target-recognition (ATR) applications, with emphasis on demonstrating ATR capabilities\nfor military defense against cruise missiles. Other applications for sensor systems derived from VIGILANTE could\ninclude medical imaging and machine\nvision for industrial robots and robotic\nvehicles.\nVIGILANTE comprises two main subsystems (see figure). The VIGIL subsystem is an airborne telescope used to acquire image data for target-recognition\nexperiments and to test novel passive\nand active focal-plane image sensors.\nThe telescope will ultimately include a\n15-cm Cassegrain unit, a gimballed mirror, and optical and electronic channels\nfor multiband (infrared, visible, and ultraviolet) image sensors.\nThe ANTE subsystem is a prototype\nimage-processing/target-recognition analog/digital computer system. The core\ncomputing engine in this system is a\nthree-dimensional artificial neural\nnetwork (3DANN) of a type described\nin "Neural-Network Modules for\nHigh-Speed Image Processing" (NPO19881), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 21, No. 10\n(October 1997), page 26. A 3DANN is a\nlow-power-consumption digital/analog\nintegrated-circuit module, about the\nsize of a sugar cube, that can process\ndata at a rate as high as 1012 operations\nper second. The integrated-circuit stack\nof a previous SDANN was mated to an\narray of infrared sensors. The 3DANN\nin ANTE is a modified version of the\nprevious 3DANN, denoted "3DANNM." The modifications enable VIGILANTE to accept data from an image\nsensor of arbitrary size and format.\nMore importantly, the 3DANN-M can\nbe used to perform general convolution operations on image kernels as\nlarge as 64 x 64 pixels.\nVIGILANTE is designed to make the\nmost of whatever imagery is presented,\nwhether that imagery be monochromatic, multispectral, still, or moving.\nFor this purpose, the VIGILANTE processing architecture is modeled after\nthe image-processing architecture of\n46\t\n\nthe human eye and brain. The VIGILANTE image-recognition process is\ndivided into four stages: collection of\nimages from sensors, generation of synthetic images that augment raw images\nwith additional information, fusion of\nall images, and semantic interpretation\nof fused images. The use of synthetic\nimages is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat the brain uses synthetic imagery to\nanalyze scenes by comparing corre-\n\nRefrigerator\t\n\nthat can implement a variety of algorithms. In particular, the special-purpose processing unit for generation of\nsynthetic images (by such processes as\nspatial filtering, detection of motion,\nand identification of corresponding\npixels in related images) is the 3DANNM convolution device. Pixel-level fusion\ncan he formed on such parallel-processing devices as single-instruction/multiple-data (SIMD) arrays.

ANTE contains a 3DANN, a point-operation processor, and ancillary circuits, all acting\ntogether to perform ATR functions in real time.\n\nsponding pixels among images of various types. This hypothesis is equivalent\nto a "rich pixel" concept, according to\nwhich the brain becomes a data-fusion\nmachine at the pixel level, before it analyzes the entire scene in a semantic\nwas\'.\nBy breaking complex image-recognition tasks into a series of regular operations, the VIGILANTE processing\narchitecture maps image-recognition\nfunctions to a relatively small set of special-purpose electronic processing units\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nother functions, semantic analysis seldom presents a significant computational bottleneck and can ordinarily be\nperformed by general-purpose computing hardware.\nThis work was done by Suraphol\nUdornkesmalee, Curtis Padgett, Wai-Chi\nFang, and Steven Suddarth of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

However, prior\nto the experiments reported here, SiC\nsemiconductor devices had exhibited\nunstable breakdown-voltage characteristics and were therefore questionable for\nincorporation into high-power circuits.\nIn this context, a stable or unstable\nbreakdown-voltage characteristic of a\nsemiconductor rectifier is synonymous\nwith a positive or negative value, respectively, of the temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage. Silicon\npower rectifiers in use today are highly\nreliable, partly because they have positive temperature coefficients of breakdown voltages.\nDuring large overvoltage transients, a\ndevice can become momentarily reverse-biased at a potential greater than\nits reverse breakdown voltage. If the device has a negative temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage, then local\njunction heating from breakdown current causes the local breakdown voltage\nto decrease, thereby giving rise to a further local increase in breakdown current. The breakdown current becomes\nconcentrated into one or more high-\n\ncurrent-density filaments at junction\nhot spots, which leads to physical junction damage and device failure. If the\ndevice has a positive temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage, then\nlocal junction heating from breakdown\ncurrent increases the local breakdown\nvoltage, preventing local concentration\nof breakdown current; thus, breakdown current distributes nearly evenly\nacross the entire area of the diode\njunction.\nThe experiments were performed to\ndetermine whether the unstable breakdown observed previously is a fundamental property of SiC or whether it\narises because of impurities and crystalline imperfections that could be reduced by improvements in techniques\nfor growing SiC crystals. For the experiments, SiC rectifier diodes were fabricated by use of the crystal-growth\nprocess described in "Chemical Vapor\nDeposition of Silicon Carbide With\nControlled Doping" (LEW-15803),\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 20, No. 12 (December 1996), page 80. The figure\nshows the diode structure and current\nand voltage waveforms recorded when\n\none of these diodes was subjected to\nan overvoltage pulse with a duration\nof 200 ns. These waveforms show that\nas the device becomes heated by the\nbreakdown current during the pulse interval, the voltage across the device increases, while the current through the\ndevice decreases; this behavior is consistent with a positive temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage and thus\nwith a stable breakdown-voltage characteristic needed for reliability. The diode\nsustained repeated overvoltage pulses\nwithout measurable degradation of its\njunction.\nThis work was done b y Philip G.

The design of the present\nsingle-block fixture makes it possible to\ncomplete the testing of a microwave\ncomponent without interrupting a vacuum and/or cryogenic condition.\nA planar microwave device under test\n(DUT) is typically characterized by use\nof an automatic network analyzer\n(ANA). To be able to characterize the\nDUT as a discrete, isolated device, one\nmust be able to compensate mathematically for the electromagnetic characteristics of the test fixture, coaxial-to-microstrip transitions, coaxial cables, and\nother components used to couple test\nsignals between the ANA and the DUT.\nFor this purpose, one must perform cal54\t\n\nElm-\n\nD\xe2\x80\x94\n\n*\n0 C\nThrough" Configuration\t\n\nEliiE 0\n\n\'Reflect\' Configuration\t\n\nDo\n0\n\n=\n0-7\n\n=\n\n\'Line" Configuration\n\nFigure 1.

In the splitblock version of the TRL technique, the\nsplit block is configured in three different wa y s to obtain different calibration\nstandards (see Figure 1). The split-block\nversion of the TRL technique works well\nat room temperature. However, this version is too cumbersome for vacuum and\ncryogenic testing, in that the block must\nbe rewired and reconfigured between\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\ncalibration steps. The rewiring and reconfiguration must be performed under\nambient conditions and they take time,\nadding to the cost of testing. During the\nrewiring and reconfiguration time, ANA\nreference levels can drift, with consequent increases in measurement errors.\nIn contrast, there is no need to reconfigure or rewire the present single-block\nfixture; therefore, calibration can be\ncompleted more easily and quickly at\nany temperature, and measurements\ncan be more repeatable.\nThe single-block fixture (see Figure 2)\nholds the DUT plus through, reflect,\nand delay (line) calibration standards in\ntheir prescribed test setups and is placed\nin a vacuum/cryogenic chamber.

The system has been used to measure inlet\nand exhaust velocities on an F-100\nEMD engine from an F-15 airplane (see\nFigure 1). To perform this work successfully, it was necessary to develop\nseveral novel subsystems, including a\nrugged LDV transceiver, a high-performance frequency-domain signal processor, and equipment for adding seed\nparticles to the inlet and exhaust flows.\nIn addition, it was necessary to provide\nfor remote control of the system from a\nblockhouse at a distance of 30 m from\nthe engine.\nThe LDV transceiver features a special ruggedized design: The main\nstructural component of the transceiver was machined from a billet of\naluminum, and all optics were hardmounted on this component. This was\nnecessary to enable the LDV transceiver to survive the intense vibrational\nand acoustical fields that surround a\npractical gas-turbine engine.\nA 40-MHz Bragg cell provides frequency shifting for the LDV. The laser\nbeam is generated by an argon-ion\nlaser in the blockhouse and delivered\nto the LDV transceiver by a 30-rn-long,\nsingle-mode, polarization-preserving\noptical fiber (see Figure 1). The intensity of the laser beam emerging from\nthe end of the fiber-optic link in the\nLDV transceiver is monitored remotely;\nthat is, from within the blockhouse. A\nsecond 30-m-long multimode optical\nfiber delivers the scattered light received from seed particles passing\nthrough the interferometric LDV\nprobe volume to a photodetector in\nthe blockhouse. This photodetector is\na photornultiplier/preamplifier combination developed specially to perform\nat signal frequencies >120 MHz - well\nin excess of characteristic response frequencies of typical photodetectors in\nolder LDV systems.\nThe frequency-domain signal processor, known as the Real-Time Signal\nAnalyzer (RSA), was developed to\nprovide an easy-to-operate, extremely\n56\t\n\nFigure 1.

Since the year\n1988, it has been known that partial\nsubstitution of Sn for some of the Ni in\nLaNi5 slows the deterioration of reversible hydrogen-storage capacity and\nlowers the operating pressure for gasphase cycling. However, prior to these\nexperiments, the effects of the partial\nsubstitution on charge/ discharge capacities on Ni/MH cells and on retention of their charge/ discharge capacities during electrochemical reactions\nwas not known.\nCyclic lifetime is an important issue\nin the technology of Ni/MH cells. Hydride-forming electrodes made of\nLaNi5 undergo severe deterioration of\ncharge/ discharge capacities during\ncharge/ discharge cycling and thus\nhave short cycle lives. It has been\nknown since 1984 that the deterioration can be slowed by substituting small\namounts of other elements for both La\nand Ni. Unfortunately, early attempts\nto prolong cycle lives in this way produced undesired side effects in the\nform of decreases in hydrogen-absorption capacities, slow kinetics, and prolongation of activation intervals (intervals of initial charge/discharge cycling\nneeded to achieve full capacities).\nThe experiments showed that the\nelectrochemical (charge/ discharge)\ncapacity of LaNiSn increases significantly with x up to about 0.25 (see\nFigure 1).

These TBCs can be applied to components in gas turbines\nand in diesel engines.\nA typical TBC comprises a single\nmetallic bond-coat layer, 0.005 to 0.008\nin. (about 0.13 to 0.020 mm) thick,\ncoated with a single ceramic top-coat\nlayer, 0.005 to 0.020 in. (about 0.13 to\n0.50 mm) thick. The bond-coat layer is\ntypically MCrA1X, where M signifies Ni,\nCo, or Fe and X signifies Y, Zr, Hf, Yb,\nor another reactive element. The ceramic top-coat layer is typically zirconia\npartially stabilized with 6 to 8 weight\npercent of yttria. The bond coat is typically processed by plasma spraying,\nwhile the top coat can be processed by\neither plasma spraying or electronbeam physical vapor deposition. For\nTBCs using a plasma-sprayed top coat,\nthe bond coat is prepared with a rough\nsurface to improve bonding.\nIn spite of the necessity of bond-coat\nroughness to enhance adhesion, the\nroughness also tends to intensify the\nstresses that occur at the interface between the ceramic and the bond coat.\nRecent work has shown that the high\nstresses are particularly significant in\nthe vicinity of the peaks in the rough\nbond coat (see Figure 1). Detailed investigation has further shown that the\nstresses can be minimized by matching\nthe thermal expansion of the peaks of\nthe bond coat to the ceramic top coat.\nFigure 2 illustrates a TBC design that\naddresses these problems through the\nuse of a two- layer bond coat. The first\nlayer of the bond coat is a typical\nMCrAIX, as described for a conventional TBC above. The second layer of\nthe bond coat incorporates a fine dispersion of a particulate second phase\nin an MCrAIX matrix. The second\nphase is required to have a coefficient\nof thermal expansion as low as, or\npreferably lower than, the yttria stabilized zirconia ceramic layer, it must be\nstable up to the intended use temperature, chemically inert with respect to\nthe MCrAIX matrix, and must be chemically compatible with the thermally\ngrown alumina scale. Candidate second-phase materials include alumina,\nchromia, yttrium-aluminum garnet,\nnickel-aluminum spinel, yttria, mullite,\nand other oxides.\nSince the goal is to achieve expansion matching of the second-layer\npeaks to the yttria stabilized zirconia,\nOie particulate second phase must\nhave dimensions less than that of the\npeaks, typically less than 5 pm, and\nmust he well dispersed in the MCrAIX\nmatrix.

For the case of alumina additions to MCrAIX, an alumina volume\nfraction of 0.71 is required to achieve a\nnear-zero thermal expansion mismatch.

The\ndistance from the inner terminus of the\nflexures to the rotational axis is made as\nsmall as possible to minimize rotational\nstiffness. The three lobes of the inner\nsupport are joined at the rotation axis to\nprovide an extremely rigid attachment\nfor the flexure elements, allowing high\nradial and axial stiffnesses. The tn-lobed\nsupport rotates relative to the outer\ncylinder on the flexures to create the\nflexural pivot motion. The total rota-\n\ntional range of \xc2\xb112\xc2\xb0 is defined\nby hard stops in the lobes and\nthe outer cylinder.\nThe lobes, fins, and outer\ncylinder are integral parts of\nthe monolithic device, which\nwas fabricated by electricaldischarge machining of a solid\nmetal rod.

The rate of growth changes\nwith both the temperature and the gradient of temperature between the\nsource and the growing crystal.\nExperiments have been performed to\ndetermine the optical absorption spectra, electrical resistivities, photorefractive properties, and microstructures of\nspecimens of doped ZnTe. Among other\nthings, it has been found that the yield\nof photorefractive crystals is very low\nwhen vanadium is the only dopant, but\nthat one can increase the yield, the photorefractive gain, and the diffraction efficiency by doping with manganese in\naddition to vanadium.\nAn experiment was performed to investigate optical power limiting in\nZnTe:V by the field-shielding effect,\nwhich is a nonlinear effect that occurs\nin the presence of an applied electric\nfield and that results in partial darkening. For example, in one case, the\ntransmission of a specimen at a wavelength of 0.83 pm was 20 percent at an\nincident radiant flux density of 6\nmW/cm 2 , but decreased to 1 percent\nwhen the flux density was increased to\n1 W/cm2.\nExperiments were performed to investigate the utility of ZnTe:V:Mn for realtime resonant holographic interferometry. These experiments involved,\nvariously, two- or four-wave mixing, using\npulsed dye or continuous-wave He/Ne\nor diode lasers. Holographic image\ntransfer and two-wavelength resonant\nholographic interferometry were\ndemonstrated; in particular, a ZnTe:\nV:Mn crystal was used in a demonstration of resonant holographic interferometric spectroscopy, which is a technique for obtaining chemical-speciesspecific interferograms by recording two\nholograms simultaneously at two slightly\ndifferent wavelengths near an absorption spectral peak of the species in question (see figure).\nThis work was done by Waiter M.

A scattering reticle comprises\na polymeric plano-convex microlens,\ntypically with a diameter of about 60\nrim, on a glass substrate about 4 mm\nthick. In operation, a three-axis positioning stage is used to hold the substrate and move the microlens into the\nintersection of laser beams that defines\nthe probe volume of a PDPA. The PDPA\ncollects and analyzes the light scattered\nfrom the microlens.\nHeretofore, PDPAs have been cali-\n\nbrated by use of droplet generators,\nwhich are difficult to use, are unreliable,\nand do not give repeatable results. Scattering reticles are easy to use, are small\nand inexpensive in comparison with\ndroplet generators, and exhibit a high\ndegree of repeatability.\nTo be useful for calibrating a PDPA,\nan optical device must scatter light in a\nmanner similar to that of the droplets to\nbe observed by the PDPA.\nIdeally, the microlens on a scattering\nreticle should be hemispherical, but\nsmall deviations from hemisphericity are\npermissible.\nTypically, a PDPA responds to light\nscattered by a microlens in the same way\nas to light scattered by droplets with a\n\nmonodisperse size distribution. Scattering reticles with microlenses have been\ntested on two PDPAs, yielding results\nthat were in agreement.\nThis work was done t Edward A.

The technique involves (1) excitation of a symmetrical\nelectromagnetic mode or modes in a\nsymmetrical microwave cavity and (2)\npositioning the samples symmetrically\nin the cavity so that all samples are exposed to the same electromagneticfield conditions and thus the same\nheating conditions.

To a first approximation,\nassuming that the samples perturb the\nelectromagnetic field minimally, the\nsamples should be positioned on one of\nthese surfaces to maximize heating: If\nthe samples are electrically resistive or\nnonconductive, then they should be positioned at r/r0 0.6941 for maximum\ncoupling to the electric field; if the samples are highly electrically conductive,\nthen they should be positioned at r/rl\n0.9658 for maximum\r\n().3336 or r/r11\t\ncoupling to the magnetic field.\nOf course, the samples can be expected to perturb the electromagnetic\nfield, the degree of perturbation increasing with the size of the samples.

These systems include straingauge units comprising Pd/Cr wires\nbonded to high-temperature metal-alloy\nshims by flame spraying of ceramic materials. Optionally, a strain-gauge unit can\nhe supplied alone, but ordinarily, it is delivered as part of a system that also includes an integral, weldable-terminal\nhigh-temperature cable and a bridge-circuit-completion module at the cool end\nof the cable (see figure).\nStrain gauges made from Pd/Cr-alloy\nwires, and techniques and materials used\nto fabricate them, have been described\nin a number of previous articles in NASA\nTech Briefs. Pd/Cr-wire strain gauges can\nbe used to measure static strains at temperatures up to 1,400 \xc2\xb0F (760 \xc2\xb0C) However, the successful use of these strain\ngauges entailed considerable difficulty\nprior to the development of the present\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nsystems. This is because in order to realize the full potential of Pd/Cr strain\ngauges, it is necessary to adhere strictly to\ninstallation, stabilization (heat treatment), and calibration procedures unlike those of conventional practice for\nlower-temperature strain gauges. The\nmajor advantage afforded by the development of present systems does not lie in\nany single fundamental ph ysical concept,\nhut, rather in the establishment of the\npractice of performing all critical steps in\na controlled laboratory environment at\nthe factory, before use in the field.\nThe prefabrication of strain-gauge\nunits containing Pd/Cr wires bonded to\nshims overcomes the installation difficulty. The critical flame-spraying steps\nare performed under controlled factory\nconditions, rather than b\' the end user.\nEach unit includes a margin of shim material around its periphery; the margin\ncan be used to attach the strain-gauge to\na test structure (a structure on which\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1998\n\nPRECISION MACHINING\nCOMPLEX MULTI-FACETED PARTS \r\nTHE WAY You WANT THEM\nEXACT To PRINT.\n\n-4\n\n/\nRIGID ADHERENCE TO SI\'IcIIIc% 110 \\S\nTOLERENCES TO \xc2\xb10.00004\nPROTOTYPE TO PRODucT1o. ...\n\n, - I\' Z;Sq^\nqz\n\nVERY SMALL TO LARGE\n\nP,uu\n\nEXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH\nHIGH STRENGTH ALLOYS & TITANIUM\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT\n8-Axis Swiss, 5-Axis MACHINING CENTERS,\nLARGE TURNING WITH C&Y AXIS, FULL C-AXIS CNC GRINDING\n\nMIL - I - 45208A, GMP, ISO 9002 & ISO - 10012 - 1\nGOVERN MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES\n\n&\n\nQUALITY CONTROL TO THE LEVEL OF ZERO DEFECT\nOVER 90 YEARS Of EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENCE\nMANUFACTURING IN A MODERN 50,000 SQ FT FACILITY\n\nFAST QUOTE ON YOUR PRThJTS & SPECS\nE-MAIL lpi@lavezzi.com OR FAX 630-582-1238\n.\t\n\nRELY ON ACCURATE ESTIMATES & ASSISTANCE WITH\nINNOVATIVE ENGINEERING SERVICES &\n__\n\nPRECISION MANUFACTURING\n\nULAVEZ ZI\nQUALITY. .

Care is taken to maintain this\ntemperature within a narrow margin of\nerror; underheating causes changes in\nelectrical resistance to be smaller than\nexpected, while even momentary overheating destroys a temperature-compensation feature. In other words, both\nunderheating and overheating introduce calibration errors.\nTo prepare for calibration, a straingauge unit is tack-welded to a bar of\nthe same material on which it is to be\nused to measure strain. Strain readings\nare taken at temperature intervals\nspanning the full test temperature\nrange, using a calibrated ballast\n(bridge-completion) resistor inserted\nin the bridge-circuit-completion module. If necessary, the calibration procedure is repeated with different bridgecompletion resistors until a satisfactory\ncalibration curve is obtained.\nOnce calibration has been performed in the laboratory, the strainmeasurement systena (including the\nfinal chosen bridge-completion resistor) is ready for use. The strain-gauge\nunit can be spot-welded to a test structure, and the system plugged into any\ncommon strain-measuring instrument\nand operated without need for further\nstabilization or calibration.\nThis work was done b\'vJ.F Le, of Lewis Research Center and S.

The most\naccepted and sensitive means for\ndetecting breast lesions, for example, is with x-ray mammography.\nWhile this method is sensitive for\ndetecting lesions, only about 20%\nof those identified by mammography are found to be cancers when\nbiopsied.\nReducing the number of unnecessary biopsies is an important goal in\nbreast cancer management. The\naverage biopsy costs between $2,000\nand $3,000 and causes considerable\nstress to patients. Given the cost and\ntrauma associated with surgically\nsampling all cases where patients\nhad mammographically detected\nlesions, there is a strong incentive to\ndevelop additional non-invasive\nmethods to accurately determine if\na lesion is benign or malignant.\nResearchers are working on just\nsuch a technique that relies on ultrasound imaging. They call it elastography and it uses ultrasound to\ndetect lesions and tumors and helps\ndoctors determine whether the y are\nmalignant or benign. Elastography\n\nScientists Use Finite Element Method \r\nin Developing New Cancer Detection Technique\nimages the strains induced in the tissue as a result of a small external\nmechanical compression. To develop this imaging technique, researchers have employed a valuable\nmodeling and analysis tool from the\ncomputer-aided engineering (CAE)\nfield: the Finite Element Analysis\n(FEA) software of Pittsburgh-based\nAlgor, Inc.\n\nTissues and Tumors\nThe elasticity of soft tissue\ndepends to a large extent on its\nmolecular building blocks (fat, collagen, etc.) and the microscopic\nand macroscopic structure of these\nblocks. In the normal breast, for\nexample, glandular structures may\nbe firmer than surrounding connective tissue, which in turn is\nfirmer than subcutaneous fat. The\nstandard medical practice of soft\ntissue palpation (examination by\ntouch) to search for lumps is based\non the qualitative assessment of tissue stiffness and the fact that certain pathologic conditions, such as\nmalignant tumors, often manifest\nthemselves as changes in the tissue\'s\nmechanical properties. But in many\ncases, despite stiffness differences,\nthe small size of a pathological\nlesion and its location deep in the\nbody, or both, prevent detection\nand evaluation by palpation or\nother techniques.\n\nHow Elastography Works\nTissues deform slightly when a\nsmall displacement is externally\napplied. Tissues that are more elastic deform more than tissues that\nare harder or less elastic. These\ninternal deformations show up on\nelastograms, letting doctors assess\nthe hardness or stiffness of tissues\nand decide whether or not there is a\ntumor in the imaged tissue. If a\ntumor\'s elastic properties are fairly\nuniform throughout, it tells doctors\nthe tumor is benign. Cancerous\ntumors, on the other hand, grow in\na very disorganized way. Therefore,\nmalignant tumors have elastic properties that vary from one area to\nanother, which should also show up\non the elastogram.\nTo create an elastogram, two\nultrasound images of the same\nbreast tissue are taken: one of the\ntissue in its normal, uncompressed\nstate, and another when the tissue is slightly compressed. These\nimages are compared point-bypoint using signal processing algorithms to determine how the tissue\nelements moved when compressed,\nthen converted into an image or\nelastogram.\n\nUsing FEA to Develop\nElastography\nTo make sure the technique\nworks on different types of tumors\n\nThe sonogram and the elastograin of breast were taken simultaneously Jrom the identical anatomical site on a volunteer puIu\'nt. The sonogram shows the piesence oJ a sal/tart hypoerhow (dark) lesion. The elastogram shows the same lesion as being hard and largrr most likel y due to\ndesmoplasia that causes hardening only around cancerous lesions. It also shows a soft core, suggestive of a necrotic center. Additionally, a second\nsmall (-6mm) lesion is detected on the elastogram at 100 \'clock relative to the main lesion. This anatomical structure is not visible on the sonogram.\nThe elastogram \'s ability to displa\' the smaller lesion demonstrates its capability of detecting tumors in the earlier stages of development.\n\n86\t\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1998\n\nA gelatin test object contains an inclusion that has the same ultrasonic proptities as the surrounding medium, but is three limes horde,: The sonogram (left) does not detect the presence of the inclusion, while the elastograos (ceo/ri) demonstrates it well. The bright region centered on the inclusion in the elastogram is a stress-concentration artifact predicted from the Algor software simulation of the sample at a 45 degree angle (right).\n\n(Test object courtesy of Dr. T. Hall from the University of Kansas Medical Center.)\n\nin various locations, researchers\ncreated and imaged simulated\ntumors with varying conditions:\nfrom a malignant tumor near the\nchest cavity to a cyst near glandular\ntissue. These models are processed\nto create a simulated elastogram,\nletting doctors determine whether\nthey could use the new method to\ndetect tumors in those situations.\nWhile it might be more accurate to\nuse human subjects rather than\ncomputer models, it would be nearI) impossible to find people with\nall the necessary combinations of\ntumors and body locations for\ntesting.\nFor each hypothetical placement\nof tissue the researchers wish to\nstudy, Algor\'s Superdraw is used to\ncreate a 2-D computer model of the\ntissue in its normal state. Building\nand analyzing three-dimensional\nmodels for this application does not\noffer significant advantages because\nelastograms are two-dimensional.\nAutomatic meshing quickl y prepared the models for analysis. Since\nelastograms render all areas of a\nsample with the same resolution,\nthere\'s no need to refine meshes\neven in areas of interest.\nWith a standard mechanical hydraulic-testing apparatus, researchers determined the material properties of real breast tissue including\nmuscle, fat, glandular tissues and\nvarious types of lesions. Data from\nreal-life tests of breast tissues are\nmade available to the FF.A\'s linear\nstress processor.\nTypically, tissue models are compressed about one percent. This is\nclone by applying fixed boundar y con-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1998\t\n\nditions and boundary elements to\nsimulate pressure. AlgorIs linear stress\nanalysis software then determines\nstresses, deflections and strains.\nWhile most design engineers are\ninterested in stress values from the\nanalysis, those developing elastographv look at displacements and\nstrains in a model to predict what an\nelastrogram of that tumor/location\ncombination will look like.\nFrom the analysis, researchers\ndetermine if it will be difficult for\ndoctors to detect a tumor in a particular tissue arrangement using\nelastograph y. If so, they perform\nreal-life testing on gelatin models\nconstructed to imitate the hard-toimage lesions and breast tissues.\nComparing results of the finite element analyses on models with elastograms of gelatin test objects lets\nresearchers optimize the procedure\nand develop new software algorithnis that better display strain.\nAlthough still in an early stage,\nthe initial results of this clinical work\nare promising. Researchers have\nidentified several possible indicators\nfor distinguishing between benign\nand cancerous lesions. In the future,\nthe researchers will try using elastography to detect and evaluate\nother kinds of cancer, particularly\nprostate cancer. Currentl y, two diagnostic methods are used to detect\nprostate cancer: digital rectal examination and traditional sonographv.\nEven with these two detection options, however, a large number of\nprostate cancer cases go unrecognized. Successful cancer treatment\nwill still depend on early detection\nand evaluation.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nAdditional contributors:\nDr. Faomei Kallel, University of Texas\nMedical School at Houston\nDr. Thomas Krouskop, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston\nDr. Michael Insana, Professor of\nRadiology, University of Kansas\nMedical Center\nAlgor produces premium mechanical engineering tools for\nVirtual Prototvping based on the\nfinite element method.

Using the latest RISC\nprocessors and VLSI components, the company\'s product\nline features compact, highperformance CCD and intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras,\nas well as a new, easy-to-use\nRaman spectrophotometer RAMAN SPEC.\nAndor\'s CCDs are ideal for\nlow-light spectroscopy. Exposure times of several hours\nare possible thanks to hard\nvacuum seals and softwarecontrolled thermoelectric\ncooling down to -90\xc2\xb0C. At\nsuch low temperatures, "dark\nsignal" (a phenomenon inherent in silicon-based CCDs) is\ngreatly reduced. Moreover,\nsoftware control allows the\nuser to set and maintain an\noperating temperature that\noptimizes the CCDs quantum\nefficiency for a particular\nwavelength. Until recently.\ncomparable - but rather less\n\naccurate - cooling performance was possible only by\nusing liquid nitrogen.\nAndor\'s ICCDs are the\nchoice for transient spectroscopy, in areas such as plasma dynamics and laser ablation diagnostics. The ICCD\'s\nintensifier can be rapidly\ngated on and off to serve as\nan ultra-fast shutter operating\non nanosecond timescales:\n\ngate widths of 5 ns are standard, and gate widths below 2\nns can be achieved with specially selected intensifiers. For\nvery low light measurements\n(e.g. fluorescence lifetimes)\nthe gain on the intensifier can\nbe increased to achieve photon counting performance.\nRAMANSPEC is Andor\'s latest instrument. When an intense beam of light scatters\n\nfrom a material, some of the\nlight is shifted to new wavelengths according to the\nvibrational energy levels in\nthe material. This "Ramanscattered" light serves as a\n"fingerprint" of the compounds in the material.\nAndor\'s RAMANSPEC combines into one neat, benchtop\npackage the laser source,\noptics, and detector needed\nto produce high-quality\nRaman data. Requiring minimal sample preparation,\nRAMANSPEC can analyze\nsolids, liquids, or powders, in\na standard cuvette, or even in\nglass bottles or evidence bags of particular advantage in the\nforensics lab. Combining\nhigh sensitivity with push-button operation, RAMANSPEC\nis suited to both routine\nanal y sis and leading-edge\nresearch.\nFor more information, contact\n.1 ndor Technology; www. andortech, corn\n\nR.

August 1998\n\nS T4HL SPL (1 ILl) COP/P 1 \\T\nStahl Specialty Company is\na leader in the aluminum\nfoundr y industr y and has\nbeen making castings from\nthe tilt-pour permanent mold\nprocess since 1946. Applications such as automotive,\nagricultural, heavy truck,\nmarine, and food service are\nsome of the many markets\nserved in which a casting\ndesign can prove to be more\nviable than other manufacturing processes. Stahl has been\nmaking parts for the automotive industr y since 1978. One\narea of application for automobiles that Stahl has expertise in is suspension parts\nsuch as control arms. Stahl\nhas supplied control arms to\nthe automobile industr y since\n1993 and currently has applications on Cadillac, Pontiac,\nand Oldsmobile cars.\n\nWeight Savings Plus\nOther Benefits\nThe main reason for converting suspension parts to alitminuin from other materials\n\nsuch as iron castings and steel\nstampings is weight savings.\nThis translates into lower vehicle weight and better fuel\neconomy. One important side\nbenefit discovered after the\nimplementation of aluminum\ncontrol arms was an improvement in unsprung weight of\neach wheel. Unsprung weight\nrefers to the amount of mass of\neach wheel that is available to\n\nbe "thrown around" as the\nvehicle encounters road\nimperfections such as bumps\nand potholes. When the wheel\nof a car with lightweight aluminum control arms passes\nover an abnormal road surface, the impact is less violent\n\nand yields a smoother ride.\nAdditionally, aluminum control arms dampen the impact\nof bumps and potholes better\nthan steel stamped control\narms, resulting in less vibration\ntransmitted through the car.\n\nImportant Features of\nAluminum Control Arms\nAluminum control arms\nare fairly new to the automo-\n\nfive industry, but they are\nbecoming more widespread\neach model year as the confidence level increases in their\nability to perform in many\ndifferent vehicle applications. Superior mechanical\nproperties\t\nand\t\ncasting\n\nsoundness are a must for the\naluminum control arm to he\nsuccessful. Castings with high\nultimate tensile strength are\nrequired, but ductility of the\ncasting is a prime consideration. Aluminum control arms\nmust show signs of deformation before failure, which\nplaces a premium on the\nelongation percentage of the\ncasting. To achieve the elevated mechanical properties\nrequired for control arm\napplications, the castings\nmust also have minimal internal anomalies such as porosity and oxides. A sound casting, combined with a custom\ntailored heat treat, will yield\na casting with exceptional\nmechanical properties and\ndurability.\nFor more information, contact\nStahl Specialty Company, 111\nEast Pacific, P0 Box 6,\nKingsville, MO 64061-0006; Tel:\n800-821-7852; Fax 816-5973489: www.stahlspecialtv.com\nCircle No. 779\n\nBt SAK+SJIA iT/lB.

Impact forces are transmitted through actual\ncontact between the teeth during gear acceleration.\n\nOld:\nIn traditional linear static stress analysis, you begin by\nbuilding an FEA model. Then you set up boundary\nconditions to anchor the model in three-dimensional\nspace.\nIf the boundary conditions fail to stop the model from\nmoving in all six primary directions (three degrees of\nfreedom in translation and three in rotation), the static\nFEA process cannot work. After setting up the boundary conditions, you then apply the moment (M) or\ntorque, which could be generated by an electric motor,\nand an assumed force (F) or pressure to simulate the\nreaction of the second gear. After analysis you will\nhave a stress contour for one point in time.\nBecause the gear teeth are constantly clashing in a\nrandom way, the impact forces cannot be known with\nany precision.\n\nNew:\n\nWhen the analysis runs, you will\nknow it\'s set up\nproperly when\nyou see the gears\naccelerating and\nstresses changing\nas you view the\nlive on-screen\nPlot of acceleration vs. time shows\nhigh-frequency impacts.\ngram."\t\nAt the end, you see the stresses on all the gear teeth\nat every point in time.\nAnd, you can make an analysis replay to see the\nresults in real time or slow motion. In addition, you\ncan run a Fast Fourier Transform on the displacement\ndata to highlight any dangers from resonance.\n"monitor pro-\t\n\nIn Algor\'s Mechanical Event\nSimulation, you begin the same\nway by building an FEA model.\nHowever, this time you include the\nsecond gear.\nYou place boundary conditions at\nthe pivots. The big gear is free to\nrotate when forced by the driving\ngear. Inertia of the entire gear system resists the force of the motor.\n\n+ PLEUR\xc2\xae\n\nWhen the Engineering\r\nHas to be Right\nAlgor, Inc.\n150 Beta Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15238-2932\nUSA\nPhone: +1(412) 967-2700\nFax: +1(412) 967-2781\nCalifornia: +1(714) 564-0844\nEurope (UK): +44 (1784) 442 246\nE-mail: info@algor.com\n\nFor More information Circle No. 507\n\n\t\nATTN\n\nBUC/LIBRARY-E\nRM. 1533\n\nALAR\n\nOpenGL based graphics\nPowerful development tools\nActiveX Control\nMapping, image processing, math and stats\nCompatible language\n\nAll in one integrated environment\n\n\t\n::: TTIT\n\nAA RESEARCH\n\n'
