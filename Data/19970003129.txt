The second topic discussed\nis the limited\ndegree of freedom\n(DOF) trajectory\ngeneration\nstudy that is being conducted\nto determine\nthe\nrelative severity of a multitude\nof paths through a wake vortex.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile the number of aircraft in the world fleet is projected to more than double by the\nyear 2015,\nmany of the world\'s major airports are already capacity\nlimited.(1)\nThe National\nAeronautics\nand Space Administration\n(NASA) is currently\nconducting\nresearch\nto enable safe\nimprovements\nin the capacity of the nation\'s air transportation\nsystem.\nOne part of the NASA\nresearch program\nis the Terminal\nArea Productivity\n(TAP) Program.\nThis program\nis responsible\nfor conducting\nthe necessary\nresearch\nto support the Federal Aviation\nAdministration\n(FAA) and\nthe aviation industry in safely achieving\nfair weather airport capacity\nin instrument\nmeteorological\nconditions.\nThe TAP Program\nis subdivided\ninto four elements:\nAir Traffic\nManagement,\nAircraft-Air\nTraffic Control Systems Integration,\nLow-Visibility\nLanding,\nand\nReduced\nSpacing Operations.\n\nreducing\n\nThe Reduced\nthe in-trail\n\nSpacing Operations\nelement\nis responsible\nfor conducting\nresearch\non\nspacing distance\nbetween airplanes.\nImprovements\nin landing frequency\n\nby\n\nreducing\nin-wall spacing distances\nhave the potential\nto increase\nsystem capacity\nby 10-15%.(2)\nThe limiting factor in reducing\nthe spacing distances\nis the wake turbulence\nphenomena.\nThe\nwake of an aircraft is characterized\nby two counter-rotating\nvortices that are spaced at a distance\nof slightly less than the aircraft span. Another\naircraft encountering\none of these vortices\ncould\neither be mildly perturbed\nor catastrophically\nupset.\nThe degree of upset is dependent\non a\nnumber of factors including\nrelative sizes of the aircraft.\nThe current aim of the wake vortex research program at NASA Langley\nResearch\nCenter\n(LaRC) is to create a methodology\nthat will allow researchers\nto accurately\nmodel wake vortices\nand characterize\nthe hazard posed by them. The purpose\nof this hazard characterization\nresearch\nis to relate the potential\nvortex hazard to sensor observable\nquantities.\nA sensor based system\ndesignated\nas Aircraft\nVortex Spacing System (AVOSS)\nwill then be developed\nto predict,\ndetect, track, and quantify\nwake vortices.(3)\nHazard analyses\nwill be applied\nto determine\nif an\naircraft could safely penetrate\na vortex that has been detected\nin the approach\ncorridor.\nThis\nreport will discuss the development\nof a freeflight\nmodel control system and the trajectory\ngeneration\nstudy conducted\nat LaRC as part of the wake vortex research program.\n\n818\n\nFreeflight\n\nModel Control System\n\nAs part of the wake vortex research\nprogram,\ntests will be conducted\nto determine\nthe\ndynamic effects of flying a Boeing 737 within the wake of another aircraft.\nIn one test, a scale\nmodel of the Boeing 737 aircraft will be flown behind a simulated\nsecond aircraft within the test\nsection of the 30- by 60- foot tunnel at LaRC.\nControl laws were developed\nfor the Boeing 737\nfreeflight\nmodel based on the control system for the Boeing 737-100\nat LaRC.\nThe control laws\nrepresent\nthe Boeing 737 for eight candidate\napproach\nflight conditions\nin which the flap settings\nand airspeed vary. Aerodynamic\ndata for each of the eight flight conditions\nwere obtained\nfor\nthe state-space\nmatrices\nfrom a Boeing 737 simulation\ndatabase.\nActuator\nmodels, maximum\ncontrol surface deflections,\nand yaw damper models were obtained\nfrom Boeing documentation.\nA SIMULINK\nfile was then created to analyze the dynamics\nof the full scale aircraft.\nThe\ncontrol laws for the full scale aircraft were scaled down to the model size using Froude number\nscaling as explained\nby Wolowicz,\net al.(4)\nThe model control system was then analyzed\nto\nensure dynamic\nsimilarity\nexisted between the model and the actual aircraft.\n\nTrajectory\n\nGeneration\n\nStudy\n\nThe purposes of the trajectory\ngeneration\nstudy were twofold.\nThe first objective\nwas to\ndetermine\nthe validity of using simple and approximate\nplanform\nand mass characteristics\nto\npredict the severity of vortex encounters.\nThe primary\nadvantage\nof using such relatively\nsimple\ntechniques\nis the ease of which the study could be applied as a means of hazard prediction\nfor the\nentire commercial\nfleet. The second objective\nof the study was to obtain a database\nabout the\nseverity of a vortex-induced\nupset for a multitude\nof paths through a wake for several followergenerator\naircraft pairs.\nFor this study, a MATLAB\nsimulation\nwas developed\nbased on simplified\nmath models\nof aircraft.\nGenerator\naircraft were assumed to have elliptic spanwise\nlift distributions.\nUsing\nthe known characteristics\nof vortices shed from aircraft with ellipitic spanwise\nlift distributions,\nthe wake vortices of the generator\naircraft were then modeled by an accepted\nvortex velocitydistribution.\nStrip theory was used to calculate\nthe aerodynamic\nforces and moments\ninduced\non\nthe follower\naircraft by the vortices.\nExplicit solutions\nfor the induced\nlift and rolling moment\ncoefficients\nwere obtained\nfrom Tatnall by integration\nof the strip theory equations.(5)\nUsing the\ninduced\nlift and rolling moment coefficients,\nBowles\ndetermined\nthe equations\nof motion of the\nfollower\naircraft in the wake of the generator\naircraft.(6)\nWith these equations,\nthe simulation\ncould be altered to allow the follower\naircraft either one degree of freedom\n(DOF), roll, or three\nDOF, roll and translation\nalong the Y and Z axes.\nTo simulate the decay of actual vortices\nwith time in the atmosphere,\nthe wake vortices\nin the vortex encounter\nsimulation\nwere decayed linearly with non-dimensional\ntime. This\nvortex decay model is based on worst case situation\nof tower fly-by data in research conducted\nby Greene.\n(7)\nIn the simulation\nruns completed\nfor this report,\nthe Boeing 737 was used as the follower\naircraft.\nIn previous\nvortex encounter\nsimulations,\nthe follower-generator\nspan ratio was\ndetermined\nto be a key parameter\nin predicting\nthe severity of a vortex encounter.\nAccordingly,\ngenerator\naircraft were selected to represent\na range of follower\nto generator\nspan ratios.\nThe\n\n819\n\nselected ratios were 0.5 (Boeing 747 as the generator\naircraft), 1.0 (Boeing\n737), and 2.0\n(Learjet 60).\nAn additional aircraft pair with a span ratio of 0.7 was analyzed.\nThis span ratio\nrepresents the Lockheed C-130 as the generator aircraft and was selected since the C-130 is a\ncandidate vehicle for flight experiments.\nEach simulation run consisted\nof 99 passes through the generator\nwake in which each\npass differed\nin the lateral and vertical approach\nangles.\nThe lateral approach\nangles selected\nwere -20" to 20" in 5" increments.\nThe vertical approach\nangles used were -10 \xc2\xb0 to 10" in 2"\nincrements.\nThe Boeing 737 began each pass two generator\nspans away from the location\nof\nmaximum\ninduced\nrolling moment in the wake and aimed for this location.\nThe pass ended\nwhen the follower\naircraft was once again two generator\nspans away from the location of\nmaximum\nrolling moment.\nSimulation\nruns will be completed\nfor cases in which the follower\naircraft will have no roll control power and full roll control power.\nAfter the data is collected,\na sensitivity analysis will be conducted\nfor a nominal\napproach\ncondition.\nThe objective\nof the analysis is to evaluate\nthe relative importance\ncertain parameters\nin determining\nthe outcome of a vortex encounter.\nThis information\nuseful in hazard prediction.\n\nTrajectory\n\nGeneration\n\nStudy\n\nof\nwill be\n\nResults\n\nThe trajectory\ngeneration\nstudy was not completed\nat the time this report was written.\nSample\n1 and 3 DOF results of a Boeing 737 encountering\nthe wake of a Boeing 747 are\navailable\nand will be discussed\npresently.\nThese results are for the follower\naircraft with no roll\ncontrol inputs.\nFigure 1 is a series of plots which contain the results of a 1 DOF penetration\nof the\nlocation of maximum\nrolling moment.\nThe penetration\noccurs at the FAA specified\nseparation\ndistance\nof 5 nautical\nmiles for this aircraft combination.\nThe encounter\nshown in Figure\n1\noccurs when the Boeing 737 is on a 4" glideslope\nin the approach\nflight condition.\nThe plot in\nthe upper fight comer indicates\nthe follower\naircraft reaches a maximum\nbank angle of -243".\nThe plot on the middle fight shows that the maximum\ninduced roll rate is -58 "/see. These results\nare unrealistic\nbut are explained\nby the fact that since the penetration\noccurs a such a slow rate,\nthe aircraft is allowed\nto remain inside the vortex for a considerable\nperiod of time. Furthermore,\nthe follower\naircraft is constrained\nto only roll. As will be seen in Figure 2, if the aircraft would\nhave had additional\ndegrees of freedom,\nthe magnitudes\nof the vortex induced\nperturbations\nwould have been smaller.\nFigure 2 contains\nthe 3 DOF results for the same initial trajectory\nas in Figure\n1. As can\nbe seen in the plot in the upper left comer,\nthe follower aircraft is removed\nfrom the intended\npath and is driven over 200 feet off course.\nIt is apparent from the plot in the lower left that the\naircrazt is also accelerated\ndownward.\nIf this dangerous\nsituation had occurred,\nthe follower\naircraft could have potentially\ncrashed.\nAt the very least, the aircraft would have been forced out\nof the approach\ncorridor\nand would have had to execute a \'go-around\'.\nIt should also be noted\nthat the bank angle and roll rate perturbations\nare smaller that the 1 DOF values but nonetheless\nresult in unacceptable\npassenger\ncomfort\nlevels.\nOnce the trajectory\na criteria for the estimating\ncase trajectory\nfor a vortex\n\n820\n\ngeneration\nstudy is completed,\nthe data will be analyzed\nthe potential\nof a wake vortex upset on a given trajectory.\nencounter\nwill then be determined.\n\nto determine\nA worst\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank the personnel\nat NASA Langley Research\nCenter who have assisted with\nthe research\nconducted\nin this paper.
