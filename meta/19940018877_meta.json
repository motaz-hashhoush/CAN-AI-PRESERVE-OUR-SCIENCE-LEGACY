Its specific energy yield of 60.6 wh/kg is believed to be the highest yet achieved in a slurry-process nickel-hydrogen cell, and its 10 C capacity of 113.9 AH the highest capacity yet of any type in a 3.5 inch diameter size. The cell also demonstrated a pulse capability of 180 amps for 20 seconds. Specific cell parameters and performance are described. Also covered is an episode of capacity fading due to electrode swelling and its successful recovery by means of additional activation procedures.", "title": "High specific energy, high capacity nickel-hydrogen cell design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940018877, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wheeler, James R."}, "organization": {"name": "Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc.", "location": "Joplin, MO, United States"}}, "id": "d96bd47d8d624461aa0e2121bf2d3e72"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940018877, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940018877, "id": "a378281ccf444d17a40bb84c33239f6f", "publicationName": "NASA.
