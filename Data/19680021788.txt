Reductions in diameter, number of stages, o r number of\nblades all result in smaller and/or lighter turbines.\n\nThese reductions, how-\n\never, are accompanied by decreasing values of reaction and/or solidity, both\nof which result in a requirement for more work per blade. As the loading\nper blade is increased, the flow on the blade surfaces is characterized by increased decelerations. It is these decelerations, which are associated with\nincreased profile loss and eventual separation of the boundary layer, that i n\nrpose limitations on the amount of loading that can be used.\nI increased bllade loadings are to be utilized in advanced turbine designs,\nf\n\nthen these high loadings must be obtained without the previously mentioned\nhigh losses., Some factors useful for representing blade loading were presented in [I]. These were a surface diffusion parameter and a loading coefficient. Similar factors have been used previously to correlate blade loss\n(e+,\n\n[21b\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine means for obtaining increased\nloading in terms of these diffusion and loading factors. Advanced blading concepts designed for efficient utilization of each of these factors are described,\nand experimental results demonstrating the design concepts are presented.\n\n2\n\nSYMBOLS\ncX\n\naxial chord\n\nIDs\n\nsuction surface diffusion parameter, Equation (3)\n\nP\n\nstatic pressure\n\nR\n\nreaction, Equation (5)\n\nS\n\nspacing\n\nv\n\nvelocity\n\nAp\n\nturning angle, deg\n\nP\n\nmass density\n\nOx\n\naxial solidity, cx/s\n\n@\n\nloading effectiveness\n\n@Z\n\nZweifel loading coefficient\n\nSubscripts\nm a maximum\n\nmin\n\nminimum\n\ns\n\nsuction surface\n\nU\n\ntang entia1\n\nX\n\naxial\n\n1\n\ninlet\n\n2\n\noutlet\n\nSuperscript\n1\n\ntotal\nLOADING FACTORS\n\nBlade loading can be related to blade solidity and reaction by means of a\ncoefficient relating actual to ideal loading. A typical blade row with the asso-\n\n3\nciated surface velocity distribution (loading diagram) and nomenclature is shown\nin Fig. 1. In this paper, the ideal loading force is defined by the static pressures being constant at the inlet total pressure on the pressure surface and at\nthe minimum static pressure on the suction surface. Using this aefinition, a\nloading effectiveness is defined as\n\nThis loading effectiveness differs from the loading coefficient presented in\n\n[ 11 in the definition of the ideal constant pressure on the pressure surface.\nSince the static pressure at the stagnation point is theoretically the inlet total\npressure, it is used here to represent the ideal value on the pressure surface.\nThe loading effectiveness also differs from the well-known Zweifel loading\ncoefficient [3], which is based on an ideal suction-surface static pressure equal\nto the exit static pressure.\n\nThus, the value of Zweifel\'s coefficient can exceed\n\nunity in cases where high suction-surface diffusions are encountered. The\nloading effectiveness, which is based on an ideal suction-surface static press u r e equal to the minimum pressure on that surface, is limited to a maximum\nvalue of unity. These two loading factors are related as\n\nFor incomp r essibl e flow with no loss, and using the suction-surface diffusion\nparameter defined in [ 1 as\n1\n\n4\nEquation (2) becomes\nJ/Z\n-- -D\nS\n\nIC/\n\nEquation (1) can be transformed into the desired interrelationship among\n\nthe factors affecting blade loading by assuming incompressible flow with no\n\nloss, using the suction-surface diffusion parameter definition of Equation (3),\nand the definition of reaction, which is\n( 5)\n\nMaking these substitutions in Equation (1)and solving for solidity (ox = cx/s)\nyields\n\nEquation (6) indicates that for given velocity-diagram requirements\n(constant R and A@), lower solidity can be obtained if increased loading\neffectiveness and/or suction surface diffusion can be achieved. Also indicated by Equation (6) is an increase in solidity with decreasing reaction.\n\nTO\n\noffset this consequence of lowering reaction, higher values of diffusion and/or\neffectiveness are again desired.\n\nThe increase in blade loading, as represented\n\nby higher values of suction surface diffusion and/or loading effectiveness, however, must be accomplished without greatly increasing the flow losses. Increasing suction surface diffusion is known to result eventually in flow separation and associated severe losses. Methods must be found, therefore, to utilize high diffusion without high losses o r to eliminate the diffusion from the\n\nsuction surface and thus increase loading effectiveness by maintaining a high\n\n5\n\nloading over the length of the blade.\nADVANCEDCONCEPTS\nIn accordance with the previous discussion, advanced concepts for maintaining high diffusion without excessive loss and also for increasing the loading\neffectiveness while eliminating high diffusion from the blade suction surface\n\nare currently the subject of both in-house and contract [4, 51 studies.\nThe concepts being studied are the tandem blade, jet flap, tangential jet,\nand vortex generators.\n\nTo illustrate concepts designed for high diffusion and\n\nhigh effectiveness, the tandem blade and jet flap will be discussed in this\npaper.\nThe tandem blade concept, shown in Fig. 2(a), is designed to utilize high\ndiffusion without separation.\n\nThe slot between the two airfoils serves to\n\nbreak and reenergize the thickening boundary layer, and thus retard separa-\n\ntion.\n\nThe jet flap concept, shown in Fig. 2(b), is designed to alter the velo-\n\ncity distribution by using a secondary jet of air to eliminate high cliffusion on\nthe suction surface and increase loading effectiveness.\nTandem Blade\nA photograph of the tandem blade rotor being studied as part of the pro-\n\ngram discussed in [4] is shown in Fig. 3. The mean section of a slightly\nmodified version of this blade row was the subject of a cascade study by Nosek\nof Lewis Research Center. A velocity distribution obtained from these cascade\n\ntests is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that high suction-surface diffusions\nwere obtained, especially on the rear airfoil. The exit survey of total pressure for the data shown in Fig. 4 is presented in Fig. 5. The flow did not sep-\n\narate from the suction surface of the rear airfoil despite the high diffusion\nthat existed. This was evident from the shape of the exit survey trace and\n\n6\n\nother associated data and calculations. It can be noted that the w e e from\nthe front airfoil still exists to some extent at the blade-row exit.\n\nJet- Flap Blade\nA photograph of an annular cascade sector containing jet-flap blades is\nshown in Fig. 6. The blades are representative of a highly-loaded stator\nand are being tested in the program discussed in [ 51. Experimental velocity distributions obtained from the cascade tests are presented in Fig. 7\nfor the cases of no jet flow and 4 percent jet flow. It is seen that the use of\njet flow eliminates the diffusion on the suction surface, thus increasing the\n\nloading in the exit region of the blade. In this manner, the loading effectiveness is increased.\nSince secondary air must be used for the jet-flap concept, the gains in\nloading must be weighed against any penalties associated with the use of the\nsecondary air. In a case where the blades must be cooled, the secondary\n\nair is already available within the blade and opportunity exists \xe2\x82\xacor using the\nsame air for both cooling and increasing blade loading.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nMeans for obtaining the increased blade loadings desired for advanced\napplications were examined in terms of surface diffusion and loading effectiveness factors. The surface diffusion t e r m represents the velocity deceleration\non the blade suction surface.\n\nThe loading effectiveness represents the loading\n\nt h t is actually achieved as a fraction of the ideal loading defined by the suction\nsurface maximum velocity. Increases in the value of each of these parameters\ncan result in increased blade loadings.\nAdvanced concepts for obtaining high diffusion without excessive loss and\nalso for eliminating high diffusion from the blade surface while increasing\n\n.-\n\n7\n\nloading effectiveness are currently being investigated. A concept designed\nto utilize high diffusion without separation is the tandem blade, while the jetflap blade is a concept designed to eliminate high suction surface diffusion on\n\nthe blade while yielding a high loading effectiveness.\n\nExperimental results\n\nthus far obtained have served to encourage further work in these areas.\n\n8\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
