b'Fie Proteaian Jacket\nAt right is one of the\n\nZbejacke~\nprotect the\nequipment\nfrom the\nextreme\ntemperatures\n\nof intense\nhydrocarbon\n\nfires\n\nPC1200 Series Fire\nProtection Jackets\ndeveloped by PaulMunroe Engineering,\nOrange, California, to\nprotect the oil conduit\nsystem that carries crude\noil and gas from wells\nbeneath the sea to an\noffshore drilling\nplatform. The jacket is\nshown after protecting a\nvalve actuator from a 30minute exposure to high\nvelocity, gas-fed flames.\nFitted over pumps,\ncable trays, electrical\nequipment, riser\ntensioners, valve\nactuators and other\napparatus, the jackets protect the equipment from\nthe extreme temperatures of intense hydrocarbon\nfires that cause buckling and could cause structural\nfailure of the entire platform. Protection of vital\nstructural components can save lives and give\nfirefighters additional time to extinguish oil field fires.\nThe jackets are designed to withstand\ntemperatures of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit for four\nhours or more; this window of extra time before\ndestruction of equipment is significant in relation to\nimproved evacuation methods and healwsafety\nstandards. The flame-proof jacketing was developed\n\nfrom a combination of ceramic cloth and other\nlaminates used in astronaut space suit designs. The\nceramic material developed for the cloth is similar to\nthat developed by NASA for the tiles that protect\nSpace Shuttle surfaces from the heat of reentry.\nPaul-Munroe was aided in the jacketing\ndevelopment by NERAC, Inc., Tolland, Connecticut,\none of 10 NASA-sponsored Industrial Applications\nCenters that provide informational and problemsolving assistance to industrial and other clients.\nThrough information obtained from NERAC, PaulMunroe was able to locate specialists that used the\nShuttle-type ceramic fibers and as a result they\nconcluded an agreement for production and\nmarketing of the jacketing system.\n\n'
