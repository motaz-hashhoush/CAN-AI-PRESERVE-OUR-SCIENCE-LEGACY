The vacuum-jacketed apparatus consisted of a vertical tube followed by a near horizontal tube. The apparatus was equipped with view ports in the near horizontal section to allow visual observation of the flow patterns. Wall temperatures were measured at various locations along the length of the transfer line. Each test was conducted at a constant liquid volumetric flowrate at the transfer line inlet until saturation temperatures were obtained throughout the system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040027865, "endDate": "2003-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Cryogenic Engineering Conference", "location": "Anchorage, AK", "id": "c16cf0ecd90a4af1a873d2acb3139430", "startDate": "2003-09-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040027865, "id": "61c49fa497214ca7bd31808bcd789481", "publicationDate": "2003-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040027865.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040027865/downloads/20040027865.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040027865/downloads/20040027865.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040027865/downloads/20040027865.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
