( B 317-38)\nC.\n\nThe power supply of the present invention is designed\nso that the manufacturer specifications for the series stage\ntransistor are not exceeded. Should a short circuit on\nthe outplut side of the series stage transistor occur, the 11\ntransistor will not be destroyed because the decrease\nin output voltage is utilized to drive the transistor toward\ncut-off. Furthermore, Protection of the regulated power\nsupply output wiring and the unregulated power supply input need not be provided since the maximum current can 20\nbe predicted.\nThis invention ldescribed herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Section 3015 of the National\nAeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-568\n(72 Stat. 435, U.S.C. 2457).\nThis invention relates in general to tegulated power\nsupplies and, more partioularly, to a power supply containing overload protection for a series stage transistor.\nIn a traqsistorized direct-current (D.C.) power supply\nwhere an unregulated voltage is applied to the input terminals and a regulated ouoput voltage is taken off the output terminals, normally the collector-emitter circuit of\na series stage transistor is connected between one of\nthe input and output terminals. Should the load current\nbecome excessive at the output terminals thus causing\na large amount of current to flow through the series\ntransjistor, normally the transistor would be destroyed.\nFurther, the unregulated input power supply could also\nbe damaged by the excessive current flow.\nIn order to overcome the attendant disadvantages\nof prior art regulated power supplies, the power supply\nof the present invention is designed so that the manufacturer Specifications for the s e r i q stage transistor are\nnot exceedad. Should a short circuit on the output side\nof the series stage transistor occw, the transistor will\nnot be destroyed because the decrease in output voltage\nis utilized to drive the transistor toward cut-off. Furthermore, protection of the regulated pcrwer supply output\nwiring and the unregulated power supply input need not\nbe provided since the maximum current can be predicted.\nMore particularly, the circuit commises a first input\nterminal for supplying a source of unregulated D.C. voltage to the emitter of a series stage transistor. The collector of the series stage transistor is connected to a\nregulated voltage output terminal and the base is connected to a pecond input terminal through a first resistor. Also connected to the output terminal is the\ncathode of a Zener diode, the anode of which is connected to both one side of a second resistor and the\nbase of a first control transistor. The other side of\nthe second resistor is connected to the collector of the\nfirst control transistor while the emitter is connected to\nthe second input terminal. Further, the collector of the\nfirst control transistor is connected through a third resistor to the first output terminal and through a fourth\nresistor to the base of a second control transistor.\nThe emitter of the second control transistor is connected to the second input terminal and the collector\nis (Connected to the base of the series stage transistor.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\nAny changes in the output regulated voltage varies the\ncurrent in the Zener diode causing the signal to the\ncontrol sections to vary the impedance of the collectoremitter circuit of the series stage transistor thus maintaining a regulated output voltage. If the load current\nbecomes excessive, the ourrent through the Zener diolde\ndecreases and bias for the amplifying section is obtained\nthrough the second resistor which is chosen so that it\nwill drive the series stage transistor toward cut-off. Thus,\nany load up to and including a short circuit can be\nimposed upon the regulator circuit described with no\nadverse effect.\nThe advantages of this invention, both as to its construction and made of operation, will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered\nin connection with the accompanying drawing, and wherein :\nThe figure is a circuit diagram of a mgulated power\nsupply containing the overload protection circuit in\naccordance with this invention.\nReferring now to the drawing, there is shown a regulated power supply containing the novel load protection\ncircuit of the subject invention. Unregulated D.C voltage\nis applied across a pair of input terminals 10, 82. A series\nstage trmsistor 14 having a base 16, collector 18, and\nemitter 22 is connected by means of the emitter terminal\nto the unregulated voltage line terminal I@,and its collector 18 is connected to a regulated voltage line terminal\n24. The base of the transistor 14 is connected through a\nresistor 26 to terminal 12.A Zener diode 28 having its\ncathode connected to the unregulated output voltage\nline terminal 24 is connected by its anode terminal to\na first control transistor 32 at its base terminal 34. The\nemitter 36 of the transistor 32 is connected to the terminal\n12 whereas the collector 38 is connected through a biasing resistor 42 to the output voltage line terminal 24.\nAn overload protection resistor 44 is connected between\nthe anode of Zener diode 28 and the collector 38 of the\ntransistor 32. Further, the collector 36 is connected\nthrough a resistor 46 to a second control transistor 4s\nat its babe terminal 52. The emitter 54 of the second control transistor is connected to the terminal 12 and the\ncollector 56 is connected to the base 16 of the series stage\ntransistor.\nWith the foregoing in mind, operation of the above\ndescribed circuit is as follows:\nWith an unregulated positive D.C. voltage applied to\n, the emitter-base circuit of the transistor\n14 is forward biased allowing base current of the transis1\ntor 1 4 to flow through the resistor 24. Thus, initial conduction of the transistor 14 occurs and the voltage at\noutput terminal 24 starts to rise. The output voltage at\nterminal 24 is sensed by a Zener diode 28. When the voltage to the output terminals of circuit exceeds a value\nwhich is greater than the breakdown voltage of the Zener\ndiode 28 and the voltage across the base-emitter circuit\nof the control transistor 32, any further increases in output voltage will cause an increase in the current through\nthe Zener diode.\nAs can readily be seen, this increase will change the\nvoltage across that emitter-base circuit ,of transistor 32,\nwhich in turn is amplified by control transistor 48. The\noutput signal of transistor 48 is applied to the base of\ntransistor 84 which in turn varies the impedance of the\ncollector-emitter circuit of the series stage transistor 24.\nThus, the change in impedance across the collectoremitter circuit of transistor I4 will increase o r decrease\nthe output voltage across the output of the circuit. Therefore, rises in the output voltage are sensed by the Zener\ndiode 28 causing the impedance of collector-emitter cir-\n\n3,393,347\n3\ncuit of transistor I 4 to increase wnereas voltage drops\nacross the output terminal will in turn cause the impedance across the collector-emitter circuit of transistor\n34 to decrease. Due to this closed-loop operation the out.\nput voltage will stabilize within a few tenths of a volt 5\nof the Zener diode voltage provided the load current is\nnot excessive and the input voltage is greater than the\nvoltage necessary to break down the Zener diode 28.\nIf, however, the load current becomes excessive, the\ncurrent through the Zener diode 28 will decrease and the\nbias for the transistor 32 will be obtained through the\nresistor 44. Under these conditions, the output signal of\nthe transistor 32 will drive the transistor 48 and hence\nthe series stage transistor 11 to a near cut off condition.\nThe same sequence will also occur if the input voltage to\nthe terminals BO, 12 decreases below the level required to\noperate the Zener diode in reverse bias condition.\nWith the resistor 44 installed in the circuit, an increase\nin load current bevond a Predetermined level will cause\na decrease in outpit voltage, thereby limiting the current 20\nto a maximum amount which is adjusted by the resistor\n44. Thus, the series stage transistor 14 can be designed\ninto the circuit and the resistor 44 chosen so that the\nmanufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s specification for maximum current through\nthe transistor 14 is never exceeded. Thus, a short circuit 25\nacross the output terminals of the voltage regulator will\nnot destroy the series transistor because this decrease in\noutput voltage drives the transistor 14 toward cut-off.\nFurthermore, the input current through the terminals I@>\n12 of the regulated power supply is only equal to the load 30\ncurrent plus the small current drain from amplifier sections comprising the transistors 32 and\nprotection of the unregulated power supply need not be\nprovided since the maximum current is known and can\nbe anticipated for any output up to and including a short 35\ncircuit.\nThus, an output u p to and including a short circuit\ncan be imposed upon the voltage regulator described\nwith no adverse effect and no reset turnoff or readjustment required to enable the regulator to recover from 40\nan ex,cessive load current. Thus, it is not necessary to\neither totally remove the load or to remove power from\nthe input terminals 10, 12 to enable the regulator to once\nagain regulate the output circuit.\nThe Zener diode 28 further provides filtering proper- 45\nties for the regulator. A ripple in the input unregulated\nvoltage normally would create an error signal in the\noutput across the Zener diode 28. This error signal in\nturn would be fed to the base of the transistor 32 and\nin turn a corrective signal imposed on the base of the\n4\ntransistor B reducing the ripple across the output terminals of the circuit. Thus, a ripple or transient in the input\nunregulated voltage is reduced by the combined gain of\nthe transistors 32, 48, and 14, as long as the ripple exceeds the Zener diode 28 breakdown voltage.\n55\nIt is clear that other variations of the protective circuit\nare possible, bat, of course, the circuit operation would\nbe basically the same. Also, modifications could be provided whereby the series stage transistor would be on a\nnegative line instead of a positive line.\nIt should be further understood that the foregoing dis- 60\nclosure relates only to preferred embodiments of the invention, and that it is intended to cover all changes and\nmodifications of the examples in the invention herein\nchosen for the purposes of the disclosure which do not 65\nconstitute departures from the spirit and the scope of the\ninvention.\nWhat is claimed and desired to be secured by Letters\nPatent is:\n1.
