Hemispherical-nosed models 1/2 and 5/8 inch i n diameter\nwere used i n these t e s t s .

The sketches a t the top of the f i g u r e i n d i c a t e the mode of\na b l a t i o n which was generally observed f o r both the hemispherical and\nf l a t - f a c e d models. The hemispherical noses tended t o maintain t h e i r\nhemispherical shape, and likewise the f l a t - f a c e d models tended t o maint a i n t h e i r f l a t face with some s l i g h t rounding a t the corners. The\nweight l o s s of the nose was determined i n most cases by weighing the model\nbefore and a f t e r t e s t i n g t o obtain a t o t a l weight l o s s and applying a corr e c t i o n t o account f o r the material l o s s from the s i d e s of the model. I n\nsome cases the nose weight l o s s was determined by c a l c u l a t i n g volumetric\nchanges from enlargements of high-speed motion-picture film. It was\nfound t h a t t h i s l a t t e r method agreed r a t h e r c l o s e l y with t h e weighing\nmethod except f o r the materials which have high c o e f f i c i e n t s of expansion.\n\n-\n\nThe average a b l a t i o n r a t e of the nose i j was determined by simply\ndividing the nose weight l o s s by the elapsed t e s t time. Test times of 2\nt o 7 seconds were used f o r the ceramic-heated j e t t e s t s , and f o r the\nelectric-arc-powered-jet t e s t s the t e s t times were 112 t o 2 seconds\nexcept f o r t h e graphite t e s t which was conducted f o r a period of about\n4 seconds.

Also, the nose surfaces\neroded as would be expected with laminar heating d i s t r i b u t i o n s .

Likewise, i n t e g r a t i o n of the\nlaminar heating d i s t r i b u t i o n f o r a f l a t face a t M, = 2.0 from the\nr e s u l t s of reference 4 yielded the r e s u l t t h a t the average heating r a t e\nt o the f l a t face i s about 314 of t h e stagnation-point heating r a t e of a\nhemisphere of the same diameter. The theory of reference 5 , modified f o r\nconditions behind the normal shock and including the appropriate v e l o c i t y\ngradient, has been found t o agree q u i t e well with calorimeter measurements\nof t h e stagnation-point heating of hemispherical noses i n these two\nf a c i l i t i e s and was thus used t o obtain the stagnation-point heating r a t e s .\nI n the case of the electric-arc-powered a i r j e t the average heating\nr a t e t o the hemispherical-nosed models w a s obtained by converting calorime t e r measurements of the heating r a t e s t o a copper model. Since t h e\nt e s t Reynolds number (based on mcdel diameter) i s a l s o quite low i n t h i s\nf a c i l i t y , and since t h e models here too eroded a s would be expected with\nlaminar heating d i s t r i b u t i o n s , it was assumed t h a t the heating t o these\nmodels was a l s o of a laminar l e v e l .\nSurface temperatures used i n calculating heat t r a n s f e r f o r the\nvarious materials a r e given i n the following t a b l e :\n\nMaterials\nTeflon\nPhenolic r e s i n and g l a s s\nHaveg Rocketon\nNylon\nLucite\nAnpnonium chloride ( N H ~ C )\nz\nSodium carbonate (Na2C03)\n\nMelting o r decomposition\ntemperature, O\nF\n1,000\n2,000\n2,000\n600\n250\n635\n1,560\n\nL\n\nCurrent l i t e r a t u r e on properties of Teflon ( r e f s . 6 and 7, f o r\nexample) does not give any fixed sublimation or decomposition temperat u r e f o r t h i s material, but indicates t h a t it tends t o become s o f t and\nj e l l y l i k e a t temperatures approaching 600\' F.

The data a r e presented a s the\neffective-heat-of-ablation parameter h~~~ p l o t t e d against the average\naerodynamic heating r a t e and were obtained with 1/2- and 5/8-inchdiameter models i n the ceramic-heated j e t and l/4-inch-diameter models i n\nthe arc-powered j e t . The heating-rate s c a l e i s broken i n t h i s f i g u r e i n\norder t h a t the t r e n a s i n the lower range of heating w i l l not be obscured.\nThe lower heating-rate range (75 t o about 350 ~ t u / ( s qf t ) ( s e c ) ) i s comparable t o the heating r a t e s which may be encountered by unmanned r e e n t r y s a t f ~\ne l l i t e vehicles, whereas the higher heating r a t e ( 4 , 5 7 0 ~ t u / ( s t ) (sec) )\ni s i n the category of heating r a t e s associated with reentry b a l l i s t i c miss i l e s . Another range of heating r a t e s e x i s t s f o r the manned r e e n t r y s a t e l l i t e vehicle, from 0 t o about 75 ~ t u / ( s qf t ) ( s e c ) , a s has been i n d i cated i n heating s t u d i e s f o r such vehicles of reference 9. It i s f e l t\nt h a t caution should be used i n extending t h e present data t o t h i s lower\nrange of heating, since these materials may be a f f e c t e d by heat conduct i o n and hence e x h i b i t d e t e r i o r a t i o n of physical s t r e n g t h under prolonged\nlow heating r a t e s .\nFor the lower heating r a t e s the p l a s t i c materials Teflon, nylon,\nand Lucite show a decreasing effectiveness with increasing heating r a t e .\nThe high values of effectiveness indicated f o r these materials a t t h e\nlower heating r a t e s a r e believed t o be influenced somewhat by conduction\ni n t o t h e s o l i d and hence do not r e f l e c t values of effectiveness f o r\nsteady a b l a t i o n . This conduction e f f e c t was investigated experimentally\nf o r Teflon by t e s t i n g a s e r i e s of models a t an a p p r o x h a t e l y constant\nheating r a t e (H -- 68 ~ t u / ( s qf t ) ( s e c ) ) f o r successively longer periods\n\nNACA RM L58E15a\n\nof time i n order t o determine t h e elapsed time before t h e a c t u a l beginning of a b l a t i o n . A t t h i s low heating r a t e it was found t h a t approximately 0.7 second elapsed before steady a b l a t i o n began. For a t e s t time\nof approximately 2.0 seconds t h e uncorrected a b l a t i o n r a t e w a s about\n90 percent of t h e asymptotic or steady a b l a t i o n r a t e value. Correcting\nt h e a c t u a l observed time with t h e time increment f o r beginning of abla(3,100 Btu/lb) a t\n= 76 ~ t u / ( f t ~( s e c )\ns j\nt i o n f o r t h e value of hm\nr e s u l t s i n h m = 2,830 Btu/lb. Therefore, conduction accounts f o r only\nabout LO percent of t h e uncorrected value of h m . The correction f o r\nconduction would, of course, decrease with increasing heating r a t e and\nshould be well within t h e experimental accuracy a t heating r a t e s of 200\nt o 300 Btu/(sq f t ) ( s e c )\n\n-\n\n.\n\nI n the case of the phenolic r e s i n and f i b e r g l a s s composition and\nthe Haveg Rocketon, which i s a resin-asbestos composition, it i s seen\nt h a t hEm increases with increasing heating r a t e . This can be explained\nby t h e f a c t t h a t the r e s i n i n these materials burns readily, and hence a t\nthe lower heating r a t e s the heat of combustion of the r e s i n must countera c t a s i g n i f i c a n t portion of the shielding e f f e c t . However, a s the heat\ninput i s increased the shielding e f f e c t apparently a l s o increases.\nBoth sodium carbonate and ammonium chloride displayed higher average\ne f f e c t i v e h e a t s of a b l a t i o n than any of t h e other materials a t t h e lower\nheating values a t which they were t e s t e d . The ammonium chloride has an\neffectiveness more than twice as g r e a t a s t h a t of the other materials a t\na heating r a t e of about 200 Btu/(sq f t ) ( s e c ) . It should be mentioned\nt h a t both these materials displayed low r e s i s t a n c e t o thermal shock, poss i b l y because of the method of manufacture, which consisted of simply\ncold-pressing c r y s t a l s of these materials t o form the t e s t specimen.\nThis d i f f i c u l t y might be overcome by t h e use of s u i t a b l e binders o r\nreinforcement materials during manufacture.\nThe values of ~ E F F f o r Teflon, nylon, and Rocketon a t the higher\nheating r a t e s of the arc-powered j e t show an increasing trend of e f f e c tiveness with heating r a t e . The Rocketon and nylon show more than a\n200 percent increase i n effectiveness over the values a t lower heating\nr a t e s ; however, Teflon does not show such a marked increase i n performance. This l a r g e r increase f o r nylon and Rocketon may be due t o the more\ncomplete vaporization of the l i q u i d l a y e r which was seen t o form on these\nmaterials a t the lower heating r a t e s . Teflon, on the other hand, d i d not\nd i s p l a y t h i s l i q u i d phase a t any of the t e s t heating r a t e s but went\nd i r e c t l y from the s o l i d t o t h e gaseous s t a t e . l The trend of increased\neffectiveness with increased heating r a t e agrees with t h e theory of Lees\n%hese observations can be seen i n a motion-picture f i l m supplement\nwhich i s a v a i l a b l e on loan.

The t r e n d of increased effectiveness f o r Teflon a t higher\nheating r a t e s i s a l s o predicted by t h e previously mentioned theory of\nLeonard Roberts, which was s p e c i f i c a l l y developed f o r materials which\nsublime r a t h e r than melt.\nA photograph showing several materials a f t e r t e s t i n the laboratory\ns c a l e model ceramic-heated j e t is given as f i g u r e 3. It can be seen\nt h a t t h e p l a s t i c materials Teflon, nylon, and Lucite ablated q u i t e\nuniformly with r e l a t i v e l y small change i n the hemispherical-nose shape.\nThe Rocketon does not show as uniform a b l a t i o n a s the p l a s t i c s and\ne x h i b i t s some charring a t the nose due t o burnout of the r e s i n binder.\nThe specimen of phenolic r e s i n and f i b e r g l a s s shown here was t e s t e d f o r\na s h o r t e r period of time than the other materia.ls and hence shows pract i c a l l y no e f f e c t . Other models of t h i s m a t e r i a l , t e s t e d f o r longer\nperiods of time, showed considerable charring a c t i o n a s the r e s i n binder\nwas consumed.\n\nThe e f f e c t of the r e s i n content of the phenolic r e s i n and g l a s s\nspecimens on t h e average e f f e c t i v e heat of a b l a t i o n was investigated by\nt e s t i n g specimens of d i f f e r e n t r e s i n content f o r constant stagnation\ntemperature or constant heating r a t e .

The\nprogram a s outlined f o r this s e r i e s of t e s t s i s shown i n f i g u r e 5 , and\nincludes the previously discussed i n i t i a l t e s t s .

Likewise the e f f e c t of s i z e on both f l a t - f a c e d and\nhemispherical-nosed models was investigated a t the higher pressure l e v e l\nand a t near-constant stagnation temperature.
