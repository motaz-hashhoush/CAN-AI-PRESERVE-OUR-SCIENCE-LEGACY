Computer codes were developed to provide quantitative prediction, design, and analysis capability for several aircraft engine noise sources. The objective was to provide improved, physics-based tools for the exploration of noise-reduction concepts and the understanding of experimental results. Methods and codes focused on fan broadband and \u201cbuzz saw\u201d noise and on low-emissions combustor noise and complement work done by other contractors under the NASA AST program to develop methods and codes for fan harmonic tone noise and jet noise. The methods and codes developed and reported herein employ a wide range of approaches, from the strictly empirical to the completely computational, with some being semiempirical, analytical, and/or analytical/computational. Emphasis was on capturing the essential physics while still considering method or code utility as a practical design and analysis tool for everyday engineering use. Codes and prediction models were developed for: (1) an improved empirical correlation model for fan rotor exit flow mean and turbulence properties, for use in predicting broadband noise generated by rotor exit flow turbulence interaction with downstream stator vanes; (2) fan broadband noise models for rotor and stator/turbulence interaction sources including  3D  effects,  noncompact-source effects,  directivity modeling, and extensions to the rotor supersonic tip-speed regime; (3) fan multiple-pure-tone in-duct sound pressure prediction methodology based on CFD analysis; and (4) low-emissions combustor prediction methodology and computer code based on CFD and actuator disk theory. In addition, the relative importance of dipole and quadrupole source mechanisms was studied using direct CFD source computation for a simple cascade/gust interaction problem, and an empirical combustor-noise correlation model was developed from engine acoustic test results. This work provided several insights on potential approaches to reducing aircraft engine noise. Code development is described in Volume I, and those insights are discussed. Volume II documents the computer codes developed and gives instructions on how to use them.
