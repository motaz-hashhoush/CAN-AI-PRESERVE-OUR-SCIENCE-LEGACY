Since it is manned and reusable it provides new opportunities for unique approaches for cost effective utilization of its capabilities. The STS also places additional requirements and constraints on advanced spacecraft deployment systems that did not previously exist for expandable launch vehicles. To fully utilize these new capabilities designers must be prepared by having cost effective technologies available. Advanced propulsion technology that would provide flexibility, performance, and economic benefits to future Air Force missions was identified. Both electric and chemical propulsion systems are discussed. An LO2/LH2 stage with a torus LO2 tank and 500 lbf pumb fed engine is high on the list of propulsion technology.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800022949, "id": "011336897e3b45e48dad1c1bc2550f3e", "publicationName": "NASA.
