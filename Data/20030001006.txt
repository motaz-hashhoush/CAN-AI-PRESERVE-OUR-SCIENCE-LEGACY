Some of\nthe events that have influenced this growth are\nreviewed in this paper. This review will include\nsome events prior to World War I; the influence\nof the war itself; the events during the post-war\nyears including the establishment\nof aeronautical\nresearch laboratories; and the influence of World\nWar II which, among other things, introduced\nnew technologies that included rocket and jet\npropulsion and supersonic aerodynamics.\n\nOrville and Wilber Wright were credited with\nachieving the first flight of a heavier-than-air,\npowered, man-carrying airplane at Kitty Hawk,\nNorth Carolina, USA on December 17, 1903.\nThis event marked the beginning of a dramatic\nhistory of aviation growth. The airplane has\nchanged from a curiosity to a vehicle of many\nuses that include transportation, exploration,\nrecreation and warfare. The growth in aviation\nhas occurred in many countries around the world\nand has been fostered by the native talent of\nindividuals as well as by the exchange of\ninformation between countries and by the import\nand export of hardware. Driving factors in this\ngrowth have included the innate curiosity of\nman, an inherent desire for adventure, the quest\nfor economic benefits, and the feeling of need for\nsecurity and superiority.\nDiscussion\n\nThe subsequent era of aeronautical research\nand the attendant growth in aviation over the past\nhalf century will be reviewed from the view\npoint of the author who, since 1944, has been\ninvolved in the NACA/NASA aeronautical\nresearch effort at what is now the Langley\nResearch Center in Hampton, Virginia. The\nreview will discuss some of the research\nprograms related to the development of some\nexperimental aircraft, the Century series of\nfighter aircraft, multi-mission aircraft, advanced\nmilitary aircraft and missiles, advanced civil\naircraft, supersonic transports, spacecraft and\nothers\n\n* Senior Technical Specialist\nSystems Analysis Branch\nAssociate Fellow, AIAA\nCopyright (c) 2002 by the American Institute of\nAeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The Wright\'s\ncould also benefit from the works of several\nother\'s. One of the first to concentrate on the\ndevelopment of a heavier-than-air,\nfixed-wing\nflying machine was Sir George Cayley of\nEngland. In 1853, Cayley made a glider in\nwhich it is said that his unwilling coachman\nmade what was probably the first flight in a\nmanned, heavier-than-air\ncraft. While Cayley\nwas laying much of the foundation for modem\naircraft, he could not provide what he called a\nprime mover - a suitable lightweight engine.\nAmong other innovative glider designers was\nOtto Lilienthal, a German, who, in the 1890\'s\nbuilt and flew many successful hang-gliders.\nLilienthal was killed in 1896 when a wind gust\ncaused the glider on which he was flying to stall\nand crash. Lilienthal did record his work so that\nothers might benefit from his experience. One\nfollower, Percy Pilcher in Scotland, constructed\nseveral promising gliders in the late 1890\'s and\nwas working toward a powered machine when a\ncrash ended his career. In the United States, a\nFrench-born American, Octave Chanute, became\ninterested in aeronautics and flight. He wrote\n\nseveral\njournal\narticlesnthedevelopment\no\nofthe\nflying\nmachine in1894\nand\nthearticles\nappeared\ninbook entitledrogress\nform\nP\ninFlying\nMachines.\nChanute hisassociates\nand\ndiddesign,\nbuild flyseveral\nand\nmodified\nversions\nofthe\nLilienthal-type Inabout\nglider.\nthesame\nperiod\noftime\ninthe\nlate1800\'s\nanother\nAmerican\nscientist,\nSamuel\nPierpoint\nLangley\nbecame\nconvinced powered was\nthat\nflight achievable.\nLangley\ndidnotexperiment\nwithgliding\nflight\nbutwithmodels\npowered\nwithrubber at\nbands\nfirstand withsteam\nthen\nengines.\nInNovember\n1896,\nhissteam-powered\nAerodrome\nNo.6\nsuccessfully\ndemonstrated flightwhen\npowered\nit flewforthree-quarters\nofamilebefore\nrunning\noutoffuel.The\nWright\nbrothers awaref\nwere\no\nLangley\'s\nexperiments wrote\nand\nformore\ninformation\nonhiswork. he\nT Wright\nbrothers\nalso\nwrote\ntoChanute described of\nand\nsome\ntheir xperiments This thebeginning\ne\ntohim. was\nofafriendship which\nduring\nChanute\nprovided\nassistanceencouragement Wright\'s.\nand\ntothe\nThe\nWright\'s\nstudies included work\nalso\nthe\nof\nLilienthal.\n\nofaerodynamics tomeans\nand\nlead\nofstability,\ncontrol, balance. development\nand\nThe\nofthe\nlightweight\ninternal\ncombustion\nreciprocating\nengine\ncompleted approach\nthe\ntomanned\nflight.\nThe\nreciprocating isstillinuse\nengine\ntoday nd\na\nwas\nessentially\ntheonly ofairplane\ntype\nengine\nformore 40yearsefore turbojet\nthan\nb\nthe\nengine\nwas\nperfected.\nThe Concept Spreads. A French artillery\ncommander, Captain Ferdinand Ferber became\ninterested in flying because of the exploits of\nLilienthal and Chanute. In corresponding with\nChanute, Ferber learned about the Wright\'s and\nbegan to correspond with them. Through his\nwritings and lectures, Ferber had a significant\ninfluence on the advancement of flight in France.\nOne early flyer in France was Brazilian-born\nAlberto Santos-Dumont who built and flew\ngasoline-powered\nairships in the late 1800\'s,\nturned to gliders and then to powered airplanes.\nHe earned the credit for making the first\npowered, manned aircraft flight in France in\n1906. The Wright\'s finally demonstrated their\nairplane to the U.S Army and sold the first\nairplane to the Army in 1908. The Wright\'s also\ndemonstrated in France to an enthusiastic\naudience. The first heavier-than-air\nmachine to\nfly in England, the Army Aeroplane No. 1, flew\nin October 1908. The machine, similar to the\nWright design, was created by Samuel Cody, an\nAmerican-born naturalized Briton. The first\nheavier-than-air\nflight in Germany was a 1908\ndemonstration by J.C.H. Ellehammer, a Danish\nvisitor. The German\'s were intrigued with the\nrigid airships being built by Count von Zepplin\nand paid little attention to the airplane. In an\neffort to catch up, however, the German\'s were\nsoon to borrow from France and from other\'s.\nGermany capitalized on the talent of Anthony\nFokker, a Dutchman who came to Germany to\nstudy engineering. In Russia, a young designer,\nIgor Sikorsky, was experimenting unsuccessfully\nwith helicopters. He then turned his attention to\nlarge, fixed-wing airplanes and produced what\nwould become a forerunner of large bombers and\ncommercial airplanes. Latter Sikorsky left Russia\nand came to the United States where he was to\nsuccessfully produce helicopters. Following the\ninitial success of the Wright Brother\'s, little\nattention was given to the airplane in the United\nStates. Another U.S. designer, Glenn Curtiss,\nwas becoming well known and a Curtiss airplane\nwas the second airplane to be bought by the U.S.\nArmy in 1911.\n\nWhile\ngliding\nflightdemonstrated\nmanned,\nheavier-than-air asatisfactory to\nflight,\nengine\nprovideowered was\np\nflight needed. early\nSome\nattempts\nforpowered were using\nflight\nmade\nsteam\nengines\ntodrive\narotor\norpropeller\nbut\nnone ere\nw successful\ninachieving\nsustained,\ncontrollable\nflight.Langley\ndidproceed his\nfrom\npowered success\nflight\ntoanattempt\ntoflya\nmanned\nversionfthe\no Aerodrome.\nHewas\ndissatisfied\nwithsteam\npower\nbecause low\nofthe\npower-to-weight had\nratioand changed\ntoan\ninternal\ncombustion\ngasoline similar\nengine\nto\nthat eingsed\nb u onearly utomobiles.\na\nAnattempt\nwas\nmade nOct.7, toachieve\no\n1903\nmannedpowered-flight Aerodrome\nwiththe\nbutit\ncrashed\nimmediately toaproblem\ndue\nattributed\ntothe\ncatapult\nlaunch echanism.\nm\nAnother\nattempt made\nwas\ntoflythemanned-powered\nAerodrome\nonDec. ,1903 ut gain crash\n8\nb a a\nattributed catapult\ntothe\nlaunchccurred.\no\nNine\ndays onDec.\nlater\n17,1903,\nOrville\nWright\nsuccessfully\nachieved\npowered atKitty\nflight\nHawk,\nNC.The\nWright\'s also\nhad turned\ntothe\ngasoline-fueled combustion and\ninternal\nengine\nhad\nbuilttheirown\nengine onthe\nbased type\nbeing\ndeveloped\nforautomobiles.\nManned-powered-flight areality.\nwas\nnow\nMan\'s\ninnateuriosity sparked\nc\nhad\nthedesire\nto\nfly.Gliding had\nflight demonstrated\nthe\ntheory\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe Airplane at War. The idea that an airplane\nmight be used in warfare was adopted in the\nearly 1900\'s by European countries where war\nwas imminent. The French, the most air-minded\nin Europe, had 254 airplanes in the Army by\n1912. Two prominent French designers\'s at the\ntime were Louis Bechereau and Edouard\n\nIn the final days of World War I, Russia, in\nthe midst of a revolution was also accumulating\nforeign aircraft and engines from various sources\nincluding French, German, British, Italian and\nDutch. Soon after the war, the Russians also\nobtained the rights to build the U.S. Liberty\nengine. These acquisitions were of great value to\nthe newly formed Soviet Union in establishing a\nbase in aviation technology.\n\nNieuport. Bechereau designed the Deperdussin\nracer in 1913 that was the first airplane to have a\nmonocoque fuselage. Later he designed the Spad\nfighter of World War I fame. Nieuport was to\nbecome the designer of the famous Nieuport\nfighters of World War I. The British, after\nacquiring Army Aeroplane No. 1, were slow in\ngetting into military aviation. At the urging of\nsuch politicians as Winston Churchill, the Royal\nFlying Corps was established in April 1912.\nSome Among the British designers of the era\nwhere A.V. Roe, Geoffrey de Haviland, and\nT.O.M. Sopwith, each of who made important\ncontributions to British airpower. In Germany\nthe efforts of Fokker lead to the monoplane,\nbiplane, and triplane fighter airplanes of World\nWar I fame. The U.S. showed less interest in\ndeveloping air power than did the European\nnations since the threat of war was less ominous.\nHowever, some interesting developments did\ntake place. The Army produced the world\'s first\nbombsight and conducted live bombing tests\nfrom a Wright Flyer in 1911. In the winter of\n1910-1911, the U.S. Navy conducted the first\nshipboard takeoff and landing with a Curtiss\nairplane. Curtiss airplanes were also used for\ncatapult launch testing. In 1911, Curtiss\nproduced a practical seaplane. With wheels\nattached to the seaplane, Curtiss also\ndemonstrated the world\'s first amphibian. Curtiss\nwent on to build a watertight fuselage and\nproduced the world\'s first flying boat.\n\nBetween World War I and II. During the\n1920\'s and 1930\'s many nations were developing\nindigenous airplane types for both military and\ncivil use. Among the producers in the U.S. were\nCurtiss, Boeing, Douglas, Martin, Lockheed,\nKeystone, North American, Consolidated, Ryan,\nGrumman, Bell, Vultee, Republic, Northrop,\nVought, Sikorsky, Berliner-Joyce, Brewster,\nStearman, Beech, Cessna, Fairchild, Seversky in Great Britian producers included DeHaviland,\nBristol, Avro, Handley-Page, Fairey, Hawker,\nSupermarine, Armstrong-Whitworth,\nBlackburn,\nWestland, Saunders-Roe,\nGloster, Boulton-Paul,\nShort, Bristol - in France producers included\nLeo, Bregnet, Dewoitine, Farman, Amiot, Potez,\nLoire, Bloch, Morane-Saulner,\nLatecoere,\nNieuport, Hanriot - in Germany producers\nincluded Focke-Wulf, Heinkel, Dornier, Arado,\nHenschel, Junkers, Messerschmitt,\nFieseler,\nBlohm and Voss - in Italy producers included\nCaproni, Savoia-Marchetti,\nFiat, Breda, CANT,\nMacchi, Piaggio - in Japan producers included\nMitsubishi, Kawaski, Nakajima, Aichi, Showa,\nKawanishi, Hiro - in the Netherlands producers\nincluded Fokker, Koolhoven - in the Soviet\nUnion producers included Antonov, Beriev,\nIlyushin, Lavochkin, Lisunov, Guryevich,\nMikoyan, Myasishchyev,\nPetlyakov, Polikarpov,\nSukhoi, Tupelov, Mil, Yakovlev, Bratukhin,\nKamov, Kalinin.\n\nThe U.S. was slow in building airpower. When\nwar broke out in Europe in August 1914 the U.S.\nhad a total of 23 airplanes for military use. In\ncontrast, France had 1400, Germany had 1000,\nRussia had 800 and England had 400. By 1915,\nthe U.S. was producing the Curtiss JN-4 Jenny\nthat was used primarily as a trainer. Some\nEuropean airplanes were also manufactured in\nthe U.S. as an aid to the war effort and this\nprovided valuable experience to American\nindustry. In the World War I era, the U.S\nacquired several European airplanes including\nthose of Spad, Nieuport, Sopwith, deHaviland,\nand Breguet. American airplanes, in addition to\nthe Curtiss Jenny, included those of ThomasMorse, Packard-Le Pere, Standard, and Martin.\n\n3\n\nSome technology transfer between nations\noccurred in the 1920\'s and 1930\'s through the\ninterchange of hardware. Junkers of Germany\noperated a plant in the Soviet Union from 1923\nto 1927 as a way for Germany to overcome some\nof the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of\nVersailles and as a way for the USSR to\naccelerate their aircraft technology in areas such\nas the use of duralumin in the design and\nconstruction ofmetal, cantilever wings. Some\nEuropean designed airplanes found a place in the\ngrowth of U.S. aviation - for example, the Dutch\nFokker T-2, a single-engine, cantilevered highwing monoplane was used by the Army Air\nService and made the first non-stop flight across\n\n3\n\nthe U.S. in 1923. The Fokker C-2 trimotor\n\nsingle-place aircraft referred to as the "sky\nflivver". At least three versions of the flivver\nwere built and flown but it never reached the\n\ntransport, also used by the Army Air Service,\nwas used by Admiral Byrd in a flight over the\nNorth Pole in 1926 and by the Army in the first\nCalifornia to Hawaii flight in 1927. The Fokker\ntrimotor also saw early airline service in the U.S.\npreceding the Ford Trimotor.\nThus a considerable\n\namount\n\npublic. Other early civil transports included the\nBoeing Model 80-trimotor biplane and the\nCurtiss Condor twin-engine biplane. In the\n1930\'s some transports using more advanced\ntechnology began to appear. One of the these\nwas the Boeing Monomail which first flew in\n1930. The Monomail was a single-engine design\nthat had a smooth, low, cantilever, all-metal\nmonoplane wing, a cowled engine and a\nretractable landing gear. This was followed in\n1933 by the Boeing 247, a twin-engine design\nwith cowled supercharged engines, hydraulically\ncontrolled variable-pitch propellers,\na low allmetal cantilever monoplane wing and a\nretractable gear. Also in 1933, Douglas produced\nthe DC-1 that was followed by the DC-2 and\nDC-3. These were all-metal designs with twincowled engines, a low cantilever monoplane\nwing, retractable gear, and variable-pitch\npropellers.\nThe DC-3 was faster than the 247\nand carried more passengers and thus was able to\ncapture most of the domestic air transport market\nby 1940.\n\nof aviation\n\ntechnology was transferred between nations in\nthe 1920\'s and 1930\'s through the interchange of\nhardware. Another source of aeronautical\ntechnical information was beginning to become\nprominent during the 1920\'s. This was the\ncreation of aeronautical research laboratories by\nmany governments for the purpose of achieving\npreeminence in aviation. In the United Stares,\nthe National Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics (NACA) was created by an act of\nCongress in 1915 and the first NACA wind\ntunnel was running at Langley Field, Virginia in\nJune 1920. In Russia, the Central AeroHydrodynamic\nInstitute (TsAGI) was\nestablished in December 1918. In Great Britain,\nthe Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) was\nbegun and, in France, a research center was\nstarted at Villacoublay.\nThe NACA was quite\nprolific in the time period between World War\'s\nII and I in producing reports of investigations in\nmany areas of aeronautical research. Among the\nresults reported were those related to airfoil\nsections; drag cleanup; high lift devices; the\nNACA cowling; the engine supercharger;\nstressed-skin construction; cantilevered wings;\nretractable landing gear; enclosed cockpit;\npropellers; stability and control; boundary layers;\ndynamic stability; flying qualities and so on.\nThese developments were directed toward\nincreased efficiency; increased speed; increased\nsafety and comfort; increased utility and\nproductivity.\n\nA notable transfer of technology occurred in\nthe mid 1930\'s when the U.S. permitted Soviet\nUnion technicians to visit the Douglas Aircraft\nCompany to examine the revolutionary DC-3\nairplane. Subsequently, manufacturing\nrights\nwere granted to the USSR where the airplane\nwas produced under the direction of B.P.Lisunov\nas the Li-2. The Li-2 was soon placed in military\nand civil service where it remained until well\ninto the 1940\'s.\nIn the 1930\'s, several clean streamlined\nairplanes were produced in the belief that there\nwas a market for a small, high-speed transport.\nIncluded in this category were the Lockheed\nVega and Orion, Northrop Alpha and Gamma,\nVultee V-1A, and the Lockheedl0/14/18\nfamily.\n\nCivil aircraft development in the U.S. was\ndelayed by World War I. Some airplanes used in\nearly airline service were open cockpit, singleengine biplanes such as the Douglas M-2 and the\nBoeing Model 40. Among the first of the\ndedicated airliners was the Ford 2-AT, singleengine, all metal, high-wing monoplane with an\nenclosed cabin. This was followed by the Ford\n4-AT, all-metal, tri-motor with an enclosed cabin\nfor 11 passengers (the author of this paper made\nhis first flight on a Ford Trimotor at the age of\n16.) Before the trimotor was produced, He W\nFord\'s interest in aviation was noted in the\ndevelopment\n\n4\n\nof a small, 350-pound,\n\nAnother event in the 1930-1940 time period\nwas the flying-boat activity. These relatively\nlarge aircraft were primarily to support the\noceanic routes of Pan American Airways. They\nincluded the Sikorsky S-38, S-40, S-42, Martin\nM-130 and Boeing 314. The flying boat concept\nwas later replaced by large, new land-based\nairplanes.\nOver 800 civil aircraft types were certified by\nthe CAA in the U.S. from the mid 1920\'5 to the\n\nroadable,\n\n4\n\nmid 1950\'s. Among these were airplanes from\nAeronca, Arrow, Beech, Bellanca, Bird, Boeing,\nBudd, Buhl, Cessna, Culver, Curtiss, Douglas,\nErco, Fairchild, Fleet, Fokker, Ford, Gee-Bee,\nGreat Lakes, Howard, Inland, Kellett. Kinner,\nLaird, Lockheed, Loening, Luscombe, Martin,\nMonocoupe, Mooney, Northrop, Piper, Pitcairn,\nPorterfield, Rearwin, Republic, Ryan, Sikorsky,\nSpartan, Stearman, Stinson, Swallow, Taylor,\nTravel Air, Verville, Waco and many others.\n\noutdated Douglas B-18\'s, Curtiss P-36\'s, and\nNorthrop A- 17\'s. By contrast, the British had\nabout 2000 first-line airplanes. French air power\nhad deteriorated badly following World War I\nand the French had adopted a homeland defense\npolicy to prohibit invasion that was based on\nheavily fortified fixed ground bases such as the\nMaginot Line. In Germany, where a military\nbuildup had been underway, the Luftwaffe had at\nleast 4000 essentially new airplanes. While the\nWestern world was debating over the German\nbuildup, another unusually large buildup was\ngoing on almost unnoticed on the small islands\nof Japan. The Japanese Air Force had about 2100\nairplanes in 1937 and Japan was building two\naircraft carriers yearly in the late 1930\'s. The\nGerman might was unleashed in Europe in\nSeptember 1939 and the Japanese attacked the\nU.S. in December 1941.\n\nMilitary aircraft of various types were under\ndevelopment in the U.S. between World War I\nand II. Biplanes were prevalent in the1920\'s as\nthe U.S. was following World War I designs.\nArmy aircraft of that period included the\nConsolidated primary trainers, the Curtiss PW-8\nHawk family, Boeing PW-9, Martin MB-2, the\nKeystone bombers, Curtiss Condor, Curtiss O-1\nand A-3, Douglas 0-2, 0-25 and 0-38. The\nBoeing Company, in a private venture, began the\ndevelopment of a new biplane fighter in 1928 by\nchanging from the liquid-cooled engine of the\nPW-9 to an air-cooled radial engine. The\nairplane was purchased by the U.S. Navy as the\nF4B-1 shipboard fighter. Based on enthusiastic\nNavy reports, the Army tested the airplane and\nbought it as the first of a long line of P-12\'s.\n\nThe U.S. airpower continued to grow in the\nlate 1930\'s and early 1940\'s. Among the\nairplanes that appeared were the Seversky P-35,\nthe Curtiss P-36 and P-40, the Boeing B-17 and\nB-29, the Consolidated B-24, the North\nAmerican B-25, the Douglas A-20, the Douglas\nA-26, the Martin B-26, the Bell P-39, the\nLockheed P-38, the Republic P-47, Northrop P61, and the North American P-51. American\nindustry accelerated to meet the wartime\ndemands. A prewar rate of 2000 airplanes per\nyear was up to 4000 airplanes per month by\n1943. In the years from 1940 to 1945, the Air\nForces accepted almost 230,000 airplanes\n\nMonoplane designs became more prevalent in\nthe 1930\'s with the expectation that the\nperformance would exceed that for biplanes. An\nearly Boeing design designated XP-9 had a high,\nbody-mounted,\nstrut-braced wing. The XP-9 had\nan all-metal structure and a semi-monocoque\nfuselage that was to set the pace for future\ndesigns. The wing location limited the pilot\'s\nvisibility and the airplane was not produced. The\nnext monoplane effort by Boeing was the XP-15\nwhich was essentially a P-12 with the lower\nwing removed.\nThe XP-15 was never produced.\nThe next Boeing monoplane design was the\nP-26, which had a wire-braced low wing, an\nopen cockpit and a fixed gear. The P-26 was\naccepted and was a front-line fighter until the\nearly 1940\'s. The follow-on fighter\'s to replace\nthe P-26 were the SeverskyP-35 and the Curtiss\nP-40. Some monoplane observation airplanes\nproduced by Douglas were the 0-43 and 0-46.\nNew monoplane bombers that appeared were the\nBoeing B-9 and the Martin B-10.\nOnce again in the 20th century, warfare was to\nplay a part in the growth of aviation. In 1939, the\nUnited States had an air strength of about 1700\nairplanes of which only about 800 could be\nconsidered first- line. These were primarily\n\n5\n\nThe rapid growth in aviation was paced by a\ngrowing need for an expansion of the research\neffort. The NACA laboratory at Langley Field\nwas being stretched to the limit by the late\n1930\'s. To aid in expanding the research effort,\nnew NACA research centers were established in\nCalifornia (Ames in 1939) and in Ohio (Lewisnow Glenn in1940). During the World War II\nyears, the workload changed and increased.\nAttention was turned to the short-term problems\nof airplanes already in production as well as to\nexploring new fields of knowledge for those\nairplanes still under design. During the years\nfrom 1941 to 1944, the NACA laboratories\nworked on 115 different airplane types with\nspectacular results. Fighter speed, altitude, and\nmaneuverability\nwere increased; buffet, stall and\nspin problems were cured; bomber range and\npayload was increased. Many outstanding\nwartime airplanes were based on fundamentals\n\n5\n\ndeveloped\nbyNACA\n-such airfoil ections;\nas\ns\ncooling ethods; lift devices so\nm\nhigh\nand on.\nMany\nofthe\nwartimeevelopments also\nd\nwere to\nbeused\nincommercial\nairplanes.\n\njet engine technology was acquired from the\nBritish. The Soviets produced two British jet\nengines under license. Thus the early Soviet jet\naircraft were powered by German and British\nengines.\n\nThe\nAmerican\ndesigned builtairplanes\nand\nof\nWorld II were\nWar\ngenerally\nproduced\nin\nresponse\ntoArmy\nrequirements. exception,\nOne\nhowever, the\nwas North\nAmerican This\nP-51.\nairplane about\ncame inresponse\ntoaBritish\nsearch\nforafighter\nairplane\ntoreplenish\nthe\ndwindling AirForce\nRoyal\nfighter trength.\ns\nOne\nof theAmerican\ncompanies\napproached\nbythe\nBritish,\nNorth\nAmerican\nAviation,\nInc.,\nundertook\nthedesign NA-73\nofthe\nairplane\nthat\nwas\nproduced117 The\nin days. airplane a\nused\nnewly\ndeveloped laminar\nNACA\nflowlow-drag\nwing\nsection aradiator\nand\ningeniously\npositioned\nforlowdrag. he\nT airplane atfirst\nwas\nignored U.S. rmy\nbythe A butwas tobe\nlater\ntested,\naccepted, procured as P-51\nand\nand, the\nMustang,\nbecame ofthe\none\noutstanding\nfighters\nofitsday. irst owered\nF p\nwithaU.S. llison\nA\nengine,\ntheairplane equipped\nwas\nbytheBritish\nwithaRolls-Royce engine,\nMerlin\nwhich\nresulted\ninsubstantial\nincreases\ninspeed,\nrange,\nand\naltitude.\n\nFurther growth in commercial transports\nbegan in the late 1930\'s and continued into the\n1950\'s after an interruption caused by World\nWar II. Douglas had begun the development of\nthe DC-4, a 4-engine enlarged version of the\nDC-3. The airplane entered military service as\nthe C-54. Lockheed developed the 4-engine\nConstellation that also saw military service.\nOther civil derivatives of the military were the\nBoeing 307 Stratoliner 4-engine transport\ndeveloped from the B-17 bomber and utilizing,\nfor the first time, a pressurized fuselage. Boeing\nalso developed the 377 Stratocruiser a 4-engine\ntransport derived from the B-29 and B-50\nbombers. The 377 had a twin-lobe 2-level cabin.\n\nAnother oftechnology\ntype\ntransfer\naccelerated\nthegrowthfaviation\no\nintheSoviet\nUnion.\nUnder\ntheLend-Lease\nprogram\ntheSoviets\nreceived\nover18,000\nairplanes\n-including\nthe\nBellP-39\nAiracobra Curtiss Tomahawk\nand\nP-40\nfrom\ntheU.S. s assome ritish\na well\nB\nSpitfires\nand\nHurricanes.\nInaddition, Soviets\nthe\nreceived\nmachine and\ntools factories\nincluding\nan\naluminum mill;2.25\nrolling\nmillion ofsteel;\ntons\n400,000 ofcopper; 250,000 of\ntons\nand\ntons\naluminum to2yearsf production\n(equal\no\nat\n1945 oviet\nS rates).\nAllofthese aterials\nm\npermitted\ntheSoviets\ntochange wooden\nfrom\nto\nmetal\nairplanes inthe\nlate\nwar.\nPost World War II. - Much transfer of aviation\ntechnology followed the end of World War II.\nThe Soviet Union, for example, began to study\ncaptured and interned airplanes of both friend\nand foe. One example was the exploitation of an\nAmerican Boeing B-29, three of which had made\nforced landings in the Far East in 1944. A\nTupolev design team dismantled the B-29 and\ncopied the components and in 1947 the Soviet\ncopy, designated the Tu-4 (NATO Bull), was\nshown in the Tushino Air Show. The Soviets\nacquired much in the way of airplane design and\njet engine technology from the Germans. More\n\n6\n\nFollowing the war, in 1945, a team of American\nscientists visited Europe to survey the state of\ntechnology related to aviation. Soon large\nquantities of scientific information was flowing\nin to the U.S. In addition, a number of scientists\nand technicians from Germany and Italy came to\nwork in the U.S. Probably the most impressive\nnew technology had to do with high-speed\naerodynamics and included data on jet and\nrocket propulsion and on airframe shaping. Jet\npropulsion for airplanes was under development\nin Germany (von Ohain) and in Great Britain\n(Whittle) in the 1930\'s and 1940\'s. The German\'s\nwere flying jet-propelled airplanes before the end\nof the war (He-178, Me-262) and the British\ntwinjet Gloster Meteor was in service by the end\nof the summer in 1944. The U.S. began the\nsecret development of a jet airplane in 1941\nusing an American version of the Whittle engine.\nThe airplane, the Bell P-59 Airacomet first flew\nin October 1942.\nThe increase in airspeed made possible by the\njet engine lead to studies of airplane shapes with\nreduced drag. One method was through the use\nof wing sweep that would delay the onset of\ncompressible flow. Wing sweep had been\nthoroughly studied in Germany. Basic airfoil\ntheory for swept and yawed wings by Dr.\nAdolph Betz was published in 1935. Based on\nthe work of Betz, a low-speed wind-tunnel study\nof the aerodynamic characteristics of swept and\nyawed wings of various planforms was\nundertaken at NACA Langley in 1944 - a study\n\n6\n\nto which the author of this paper was assigned.\nThis testing included planforms that were swept\nback, swept forward, skewed, M-shaped,\ntriangular, rectangular and trapezoidal.\nSome flight results for sweptback wings were\nalso obtained at NACA-Langley\nin 1947 using\nthe Bell L-39 research airplane. The L-39 was a\nBell P-63 modified to accommodate a swept\nwing. The use of wing sweep in many countries\nwas to have a pronounced effect on the design of\naircraft for years to come. The first operational\nswept-wing fighter airplane in the U.S. was the\nNorth American P-86 that flew in October 1947.\nThe airplane began its life in 1944 as the\nstraight-wing Navy jet XFJ-1 Fury. As the\nswept wing data became available, the design\nevolved to the 35 degree swept wing.\n\nsupersonic transport; the Navy combat air patrol\n(CAP); the Tactical Air Command (TAC) low\naltitude penetration; and the multipurpose\ncommonality airplane directed by Secretary\nRobert McNamara for the Navy and the Air\nForce - the Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX)\nwhich lead to the F-111. While the fundamental\npurpose of developing a multi-service airplane\nfor the Air Force and the Navy was not\nsuccessful in the TFX program, there have been\nother cases where commonality was achieved.\nExamples are the Boeing F4B Navy fighter and\nP-12 Army fighter; the McDonnell F4H Navy\nfighter that was later adopted by the Air Force as\nthe F4.\nThe research airplane program that was begun\nin the late 1940\'s proved to be an effective way\nto advance the growth of aviation insofar as\nactual flight hardware is concerned. Before the\nadvent of transonic wind tunnels. Early testing in\nthe transonic range was sometimes done with\nfree-flight rocket models; with the wing-flow\ntechnique; and with the transonic-bump\ntechnique. Early transonic data were obtained for\nwhat was to become the X-1 airplane by testing a\nhalf-model mounted on a curved bump on the\nfloor of the Langley High-Speed 7-by- 10-Ft.\nwind tunnel. When new hypersonic, supersonic\nand transonic tunnels became available,\nexperimental data was obtained to accelerate the\nflight research program as well as the\ndevelopment of various types of missiles, launch\nvehicles and spacecraft.\n\nFurther growth in civil transports occurred\nfollowing the war with the application of jet\npropulsion and wing sweep. The Boeing 707, the\nfirst jet transport in the U.S., flew in 1954. The\n4-jet, swept-wing design was a private venture of\nthe Boeing company based on the B-47 and B-52\nswept-wing, jet bombers. The Douglas DC-8\nwas the second U.S. 4-jet swept wing transport.\nConvair also produced a 4-jet swept wing\ntransport but production was limited because\nBoeing and Douglas took the market.\nAnother approach to low-drag wings was the\nuse of delta shaped planforms with a highly\nswept leading edge and a low thickness ratio.\nResearch on delta wing designs had been done in\nGermany by Lippisch. Lippisch came to the U.S.\nafter the war and, working with the Air Force\nand Convair, aided in the design of the tailless\ndelta airplane XF-92A which, in turn, lead to the\nConvair F-102, F-106 and B-58 delta wing\nairplanes. Many delta wing designs have been\ndeveloped in many other countries.\n\nAdvances in the understanding of supersonic\naerodynamics was underway in the 1950\'s with\nthe era of the \'Century Series\' airplanes. The\ndistribution of volume and weight with most\nhigh-speed jet designs was such that problems of\ninertia coupling and longitudinal and directional\nstability and control were encountered.\nThe\nattainment of low drag was also a concern.\nThese concerns lead to the development of the\narea rule for drag improvement and various tail\narrangements for stability and control\nimprovements.\n\nFurther studies of the use of wing sweep lead\nto the concept of variable sweep to combine the\nlow-speed advantages of low-sweep with the\nhigh-speed advantages of high sweep into one\nairframe. The concept lead to the development\nof the Bell X-5 variable sweep research airplane.\nFurther impetus for variable sweep research\ncame in the mid 1950\'s when the British designer\nBarnes Wallis shared his concept of a variable sweep airplane, the Swallow, with John Stack of\nNACA-Langley.\nThis lead to a series of wind\ntunnel studies of the use of variable sweep on\ntransports, fighters and bombers. Among the\npurposes envisioned were for the commercial\n\n7\n\nThe development of aircraft after World War II\nproceeded at a rapid rate.
