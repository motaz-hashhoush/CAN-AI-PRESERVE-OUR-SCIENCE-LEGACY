Bhattacharyya\nPhysical and Earth Science Division\nIndian Statistical Institute\nCalcutta-700035,\nIndia\nSome cosmic ray events with very large multi[_licities and very high transverse momenta have recently been\nreported in balloon-borne emulsion chamber ex_riments.\nThe explanation for these events by the standard approaches\nhas become a bit problematical.\nWe have attempted here to\nunderstand and interpret them in the light of a dynamical\nmodel of multihadron production phenomena with power-law\nnature of average multiplicity and automatic scale-breaking\nderived in the model.\n\ni. I_ntrod_u_c_t__o_n_\nIn the recent past some cosmic ra# events with very\nhigh multiplicities and large average transverse momenta\nhave been observed in a balloon-borne emulsion chamber\nexperiment(l) in the collisions between Si-Ag_ nuclei.\nThe charged multiplicity range is 750 ,,- 1000 and the range\nof the average transverse momentum lies between 550-700\n_[ev/c and the observed event number is two. The rising\nbehaviour of the average transverse momentum with ener_v\nis also confirmed by the CERN 2_ oollider experiments._)\nBut the CERN PP colllder results, it is believed, set an\nupper limit (<_>_$)\nto the nature of growth of multiplicity which cannot accommodate such high multiplicity\nevents. Herein lies the problem.\n.There has in recent times been a lot of theoretical\nstudies(J) in understanding these events which are just\nflukes.\nWe would llke to apply here a model for o_oduction\nof secondaries by BANDYOPADHYAY and BHATTACHARYYA_4-) in\norder to see whether such events can be explained with the\nhelp of the expressions we arrive at from the viewpoint of\nthis model.\n2.\n\nThe_model and the method.\n\nWe will put our model for nucleon-nucleon reactions\ninto use here for nucleus-nucleus collisions on the assumption that all nucleus-nucleus collisions c_l be treated\nwith the basic dynamics of nucleon-nucleon interactions and\ntaking into account an A-dependence term into final\ncalculation in a somewhat hand-inserted manner, at least\nfor the.present.\n\nHE 3.1-8\n221\n\nAccording\nto the present model, nucleons are\nthought to be composed\nof pions and spectators\nso far as\nstrong interactions\nare concerned\nand all hadronic\ncollisions\nthus boil down to pion-pion\ninteractions.\nThe interactions\nproceed in a sequential\nchain through\nsome _-LD-_U exchanges with emission\nof free secondary\npions-at\neach vertex on both sides of the horizontal _._\nchain giving rise %o the spray-like\nnature of emission\nof the secondaries\n(and thus contributing\nto some form\nof \'jettiness\').\nThe chain ends as soon as both the\nmediating\nand final @\nmeson is absorbed by the pions\nin the target.\nKaons are oroduced from the decay of\nthe virtual\n_o mesons which are generated\nthrough _0\ncouplin$ and the secondary\nbar vons-antibaryons\n(non- -leading) are the products the decays of pions arising\nout of the sequential\n_60_Y chains as prescribed\nin\ntile plon product_.Thls\nmodel glve_ a unified description for production\nof both low and large PT secondaries,\nan explanation\nfor the leading particle effect and\naccounts for the by-now established\n<<universality>>\nof all hadron-involved\ninteractions\nas well as of e+e annhilations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nb\n\nTheoretical\n\n,--\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n\xc2\xa2_\n\nResults\n\nBy applying the Feynman diagram techniques\nand\nsome standard high energy assumptions\nthe following\nexpressions,\nvery crucial for our cosmic ray physics\n\npurpose,\n\nwith\n\n_\n]\n\nwere\n\n@lt\';P\n\nderived\n\n_-_ <ld.,l;+_p\n\n_\n\n=\n\n_#+_\n\n<,ld4t 0\n\npj>_ g\nand the inclusive\ncrosssection\nis just the mea_ of inclusive\n\n_\n\n\xc2\xb033\n\nfor the N\n(secondary)\n\n_T-orosssections.\nThe expression\nfor the average transverse\nany type of particle C is defined by\n\n-\n\n-\n\n]\n\n,.9%\n\n_\n\n_)\n\nproduction\n_ + and\nmomentum\n\nof\n\n--#)\n\nHE\n\n3.1-8\n\n222\n\nUsing the above definition\nand making use of the expressions (1-2) deduced by our dynamical model we finally\narrive at\n\nTI_^ expressior_\n\'\n"_\ni._\n(.2,_ with\ninco_poration 1\nof a maximum\n(actually _ A_\n) dependence\ncan account for the observed\nrange of mu_ltiplicity events and the expression\n(5) gives\ntheir average transverse\nmomenta in the expected limit.\n_y\nthe number of such events is limited to two only could\nprobablx _e explained\nin terms of phase transitional\nprobabilityV_a)\noccurring in the structure of hadrons ; the\npion clusters in the strong interaction\ndomain might\nexhibit further structures\nleading to a change in the\nnature of interactions\nat such high energies.\nThis aspect\nis now under study.\nSide by side, the explicit nalure of\nA dependence\nis also being looked into\xc2\xb0\n4.\n\nD_i_soussion and Conclusions\n\n_ir brief study shows that the problem might not be\nlinked up with the validity or violation\nof the KN0 scaling(3) or be connected\nwith the unknown heavies as proposed by Sukuyama and Watanbe(_)\n_ome further comments are\nin order here " (i) it is seen and suppled\nhere that\n"<p_> increases\ngradually with ener_r and this increase\nis _ssociated\nevents oorresponaing\nto average multi oilcities - not with events.h_gher\nthan average multiplicity"\nas was arg_,ed by Halzen, t_J (ii) our m_ltiplicity\npatte_\'n\nfollows power law (although th@ rate is a bit larger here)\nas advocated\nby Naraki.(6]\nThis inevitably\nleads to the\nviolation\nof both Feynman and KN0 scaling as argued and/o_\nobserved by many authors.(7,8)\nBut the fair agreement\nthat we claim here might be proven wrong by the uncertainties in the correctness as of the measurement\nof the(aver-9)\nage transverse\nmomentum\npointed out by Hagedorn.\nW e would like to emphasise here a few_2oints.
