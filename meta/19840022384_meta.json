Six elements of strategy are outlined as follows: implementation of the individual discipline missions as currently planned; use of sustained observational capabilities offered by operational satellites without waiting for the launch of new mission; put first priority on the data system; deploy an Advanced Data Collection and Location System; put a substantial new observing capability in a low Earth orbit in such a way as to provide for sustained measurements; and group instruments to exploit their capabilities for synergism; maximize the scientific utility of the mission; and minimize the costs of implementation where possible.", "title": "Implementation Strategy", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19840022384, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840022384, "id": "404afe9776ab4d14b27dbc8f7ae6d8d6", "publicationName": "Earth Observing System.
