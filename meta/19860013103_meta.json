The FINDS software was ported onto the target flight computer by reducing the code size by 65%. Several modifications were made to the computational algorithms resulting in a near real-time execution speed. Finally, a new failure detection strategy was developed resulting in a significant improvement in the detection time performance. In particular, low level MLS, IMU and IAS sensor failures are detected instantaneously with the new detection strategy, while accelerometer and the rate gyro failures are detected within the minimum time allowed by the information generated in the sensor residuals based on the point mass equations of motion. All of the results have been demonstrated by using five minutes of sensor flight data for the NASA ATOPS B-737 aircraft in a Microwave Landing System (MLS) environment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860013103, "id": "1ebbe50d2af24730b1d14ab0b6f1b318", "publicationDate": "1986-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860013103.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860013103/downloads/19860013103.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860013103/downloads/19860013103.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860013103/downloads/19860013103.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
