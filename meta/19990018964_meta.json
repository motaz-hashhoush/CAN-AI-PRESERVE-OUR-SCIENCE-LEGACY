Resolution theorem provers (such as Kestrel's KITP or SRI's SNARK) deal with first-order logic with equality but not the principle of mathematical induction. The Boyer-Moore theorem prover excels at proof by induction but cannot deal with full first-order logic. Both are highly automated but cannot accept user guidance easily. The purpose of this project, and the companion project at Kestrel, has been to use the category-theoretic notion of logic morphism to combine systems with different logics and languages.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990018964, "id": "9b97c9b181f04d93ad5a9ff0cc848489", "publicationDate": "1998-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990018964.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990018964/downloads/19990018964.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990018964/downloads/19990018964.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990018964/downloads/19990018964.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
