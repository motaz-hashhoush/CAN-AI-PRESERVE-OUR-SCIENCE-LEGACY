Typical of these CSTI efforts is the Aeroassist Flight Experiment, which will demonstrate techniques suitable in aerobrake design for slow trajectories to Mars and for lunar mission return. Long-duration human operations in space are a major element of Pathfinder, giving attention to such problems as space radiation exposure effects that could be several orders of magnitude greater on interplanetary exploration missions than on typical Space Shuttle flights. Mars Observer and Lunar Observer orbital missions are planned as a steppingstone to manned planetary exploration.", "title": "Making a home in space", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890046548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aaron, John"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "01d3611f903f4277bfd686c135e5fab4"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890046548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gabris, Edward A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "ad63dab0fb244d2f805188873bcc2ec8"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890046548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sulzman, Frank M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "8dd5f25c30cb4dc583b8568f0c5a356b"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19890046548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Connors, Mary M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "9a92f1be8fd746648887803a1b139b48"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19890046548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pilcher, Carl"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "686589925ced49718338bf6bbf3f0995"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890046548, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19890046548, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "99b1805a517740108186ba014c51a6b0", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
