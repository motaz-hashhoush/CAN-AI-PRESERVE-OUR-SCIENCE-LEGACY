The Open Data Repository\xe2\x80\x99s Data Publisher software strives to\nmake data archiving, management, and publication a standard part of a researcher\xe2\x80\x99s workflow using simple, webbased tools and commodity server hardware. The publication engine allows for uploading, searching, and display of\ndata with graphing capabilities and downloadable files. Access is controlled through a robust permissions system that\ncan control publication at the field level and can be granted to the general public or protected so that only registered\nusers at various permission levels receive access. Data Publisher also allows researchers to subscribe to meta-data\nstandards through a plugin system, embargo data publication at their discretion, and collaborate with other researchers\nthrough various levels of data sharing. As the software matures, semantic data standards will be implemented to\nfacilitate machine reading of data and each database will provide a REST application programming interface for programmatic access. Additionally, a citation system will allow snapshots of any data set to be archived and cited for\npublication while the data itself can remain living and continuously evolve beyond the snapshot date. The software\nruns on a traditional LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server and is available on GitHub\n(http://github.com/opendatarepository) under a GPLv2 open source license. The goal of the Open Data Repository is\nto lower the cost and training barrier to entry so that any researcher can easily publish their data and ensure it is\narchived for posterity.
