The LDR concept uses a droplet generator to create billions of 200-micron droplets of a heatsink fluid which will cool through radiation into deep space as they fly toward a dropet collector. This exposure to the space environment entails the maintenance of vapor pressure as low as 10 to the -7th torr; the fluid must also be very stable chemically. While certain oils are good fluids for LDR use at low temperatures, higher-temperature heatsink fluids include Li, Sn, and Ga liquid metals.", "title": "Big savings from small holes", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890049353, "meta": {"author": {"name": "White, Alan"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "e5f234f549b144c994f89f6261f3ece2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890049353, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19890049353, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "c9306b92f07b4b0dbef5fa3ef50edfa8", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
