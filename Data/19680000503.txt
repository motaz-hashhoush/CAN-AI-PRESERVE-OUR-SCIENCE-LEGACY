In many such techniques, transients (noise\npulses) can interfere with input pulse sequence in a\nmanner that destroys the integrity of the original\ninformation. Such unpredictable limiting conditions\nreduce accuracy of the retrieval of information presented to the delay line. In the past, designers chose\nto attenuate the problem by return-to-zero clocked\npulse techniques.\nThe system described here operates in the nonreturn-to-zero mode, maintaining the increased bit density capability of this mode but with much higher\nnoise immunity than conventional schemes offer. The\ncomplete system (shown in the upper figure) has a\ndriver circuit converting input voltage pulses into cur-\n\nrent pulses of specific magnitude. These are fed into\nthe delay line portion of the system.\nTypical waveforms within ultrasonic delay lines,\nsuch as magnetorestrictive lines, glass lines or others,\nare shown in the lower left figure. This represents an\nidealized timing diagram where an input current step\nis applied to the launch coil, causing a mechanical\nstress pulse in the delay medium to propagate through\nthe line at a certain velocity. It is to be noted that\nthis stress pulse is proportional to the derivative of\nthe input current step. The response of the output\npickup coil to the stress pulse is a voltage waveform\nwhich is proportional to the second derivative of the\ninput current step.\nThis output waveform is now (again referring to the\nupper figure) amplified several hundred times and fed\nto an operational integrator in order to present the\n(continued overleal)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\n\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The\nresult is a more reliable and predictable system since\nsporadic noise transients of appreciable amplitude are\nlargely attenuated. Additionally, a simpler detection\ntechnique can be used by feeding the positive pulses\nto the "set" side and the negative pulses to the "reset"\nside of a bistable device. In the present system, the\nsignal is detected by a Schmitt trigger.\nThe operational integrator, which is the innovation\nin this system, is illustrated in the lower right figure\nand features a "dead space" generator at both input\nand output for the purpose of removing baseline noise.\nThe baseline noise at the input is primarily caused by\nthe delay line itself, while the output baseline noise is\ncaused by dissymmetry of the input signal. This results\nin undesirable baseline offset and requires excessive\nfiltering of the +5v supply in order to maintain purity\nof the integration process. Removal of baseline noise\nthrough the use of "dead space" generators relaxes\nthis requirement.\n\nBrief 68-10547\t\n\nNotes:\n\nIn tests, power supply variations in excess of \xc2\xb110%\nresulted in no deterioration in performance.\nThe integrator described performs a mathematical\nintegrating function on inputs from 100 Hz\nthrough 100 MHz.\nDocumentation for the innovation is available\nfrom:\nClearinghouse for Federal Scientific\nand Technical Information\nSpringfield, Virginia 22151\nPrice $3.00\nReference: B68-10547\nPatent status:\n\nThis invention is owned by NASA and a patent \r\napplication has been filed.
