It is shown that the problems of Digital Flight Control Systems (DFCS) are the problems of systems whose complexity has exceeded the reach of the intellectual tools employed. It is also shown that intuition, experience, and techniques derived from mechanical and analog systems are insufficient for complex, integrated, digital systems. Formal Methods (FM) of computer science can offer DFCS systematic techniques for the construction of trustworthy software, including: techniques for the precise specification of requirements and the development of designs; systematic approaches to the design and structuring of distributed and concurrent systems; fault tolerance algorithms; and systematic methods of testing and analytic methods of verification.", "title": "What FM can offer DFCS design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008252, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rushby, John"}, "organization": {"name": "SRI International Corp.", "location": "Menlo Park, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ed300c035f5c41078b491c6a29aad067"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008252, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008252, "id": "a962e42623fb48869a5a1e7a62764e31", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, NASA Formal Methods Workshop, 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008252.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008252/downloads/19910008252.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008252/downloads/19910008252.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008252/downloads/19910008252.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
