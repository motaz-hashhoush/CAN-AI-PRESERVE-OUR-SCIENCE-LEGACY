Natural measures for strain and strain-rate, as I refer to them, are first expressed in terms of of the fundamental body-metric tensors of Lodge. These strain and strain-rate measures are mixed tensor fields. They are mapped from the body to space in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian configurations, and then transformed from general to Cartesian fields. There they are compared with the various strain and strain-rate measures found in the literature. A simple Cartesian description for Hencky strain-rate in the Lagrangian state is obtained.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970003258, "id": "e0a34a6d88cc43639558c654e8cbf399", "publicationName": "Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology", "publicationDate": "1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970003258.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970003258/downloads/19970003258.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970003258/downloads/19970003258.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970003258/downloads/19970003258.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
