The TANDEM functions as two lights in one. It features a long range spotlight and wide angle floodlight; simple one-hand electrical switching changes the beam from spot to flood. TANDEM developers made particular use of NASA's extensive research in ergonomics in the TANDEM's angled handle, convenient shape and different orientations. The shatterproof, water resistant plastic casing also draws on NASA technology, as does the shape and beam distance of the square diffused flood. TANDEM's heavy duty magnet that permits the light to be affixed to any metal object borrows from NASA research on rare earth magnets that combine strong magnetic capability with low cost. Developers used a NASA-developed ultrasonic welding technique in the light's interior.", "title": "Combination Light", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020087025, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087025, "id": "6b5b7a2d6c7043398531a7d90e9bb457", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020087025.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020087025/downloads/20020087025.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020087025/downloads/20020087025.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020087025/downloads/20020087025.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
