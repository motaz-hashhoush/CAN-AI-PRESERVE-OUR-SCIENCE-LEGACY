At its heart, sustainability integrates\nenvironmental, societal and economic solutions for present needs without compromising the ability of\nfuture generations to meet their needs. Building upon its pledge towards environmental stewardship, the\nAdministration generated a vision of sustainability spanning ten goals mandated within Executive Order (EO)\n13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade.\nIn November 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) responded to this EO by\nincorporating it into a new release of the NASA Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP). The SSPP\nrecognizes the importance of aligning environmental practices in a manner that preserves, enhances and\nstrengthens NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its mission indefinitely. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is following suit\nwith KSC\xe2\x80\x99s Sustainability Plan (SP) by promoting, maintaining and pioneering green practices in all aspects of\nour mission.\nKSC\xe2\x80\x99s SP recognizes that the best sustainable solutions use an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach\nspanning civil servant and contractor personnel from across the Center. This approach relies on the participation\nof all employees to develop and implement sustainability endeavors connected with the following ten goals:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nReduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nDesign, build and maintain sustainable buildings, facilities and infrastructure.\nLeverage clean and renewable energy.\nIncrease water conservation.\nImprove fleet and vehicle efficiency and management.\nPurchase sustainable products and services.\nMinimize waste and prevent pollution.\nImplement performance contracts for Federal buildings.\nManage electronic equipment and data centers responsibly.\nPursue climate change resilience.\n\nThe KSC SP details the strategies and actions that address the following objectives:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n4\n\nReduce Center costs.\nIncrease energy and water efficiencies.\nPromote smart buying practices.\nIncrease reuse and recycling while decreasing waste.\nBenefit the community.\nMeet or exceed the EO and NASA SSPP sustainability goals.\n\nKSC Sustainability Five Year Plan\n\nThis artist concept depicts a sleek, modern interior for the new Headquarters Building, centerpiece of Kennedy Space\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Central Campus.\n\nResponsibility for meeting these goals lies with KSC\xe2\x80\x99s Center Sustainability Officer (CSO) with support from\nthe KSC Sustainable Environment Management System (SEMS) Steering Committee, goal points of contact\n(POCs) and goal champions. The goal POCs and champions set strategies and tactics for each EO goal. Also,\nemployees at all levels are responsible and accountable for integrating sustainability into their day-to-day\nactivities to reduce their environmental impact.\nOur sustainability objectives help ensure mission success and our Center\xe2\x80\x99s obligations as the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s gateway\nto space. The Center strives to be recognized as a leader for sustainability within the Federal Government and\nthe external community. Kennedy collaborates and communicates with employees and the local communities\nto demonstrate the benefits of a more sustainable society and instill sustainability as a core value.\nKennedy has accomplished great feats in its storied history. The Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle\nprograms used the Center as their launch pad into space and into history. Kennedy must draw on the\ninnovative spirit that characterized past missions as it strives for sustainable solutions to support future\nendeavors. That includes growing as an economically sustainable multi-user spaceport supporting the Orion\nMulti-Purpose Crew Vehicle, Space Launch System, Commercial Crew, Launch Services and International\nSpace Station Ground Processing.\nIncorporating sustainability into the Center\xe2\x80\x99s work ethic is an important step in enhancing mission performance\nand being a leader in sustainability. Truly, we are Kennedy Space Center and we are GO FOR GREEN!\nNancy P. Bray\nCenter Sustainability Officer\nDirector of Spaceport Integration and Services\nKSC-PLN-8553 Rev. B\n\n5\n\nSection 2\n\nIntroduction\n2.0 Overview\nThe Kennedy Space Center recognizes the importance of sustainability in preserving, enhancing and strengthening\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform its mission indefinitely. The KSC SP reflects the Center\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to innovation and\nleadership in sustainability and support to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SSPP. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability vision exemplifies the importance\nthe Center places on sustainability:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKennedy Space Center will promote, maintain and\npioneer green practices in all aspects of our mission,\nstriving to be an agency leader in everything we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe SP lays the foundation for realizing this vision by incorporating sustainable practices into key Center activities.\nThe SP outlines strategies and actions that guide KSC in helping the Agency achieve the NASA SSPP goals. As\nthe Center\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability efforts progress, project status reports are reviewed quarterly at the SEMS Steering\nCommittee meetings. An annual report showcasing the status of the goals and projects is published. Additionally, the\nSP is updated every five years to refine and validate the strategies and actions.\n\n2.1 Team Structure\nTo better align the Center with the goals of EO 13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, the\nSEMS Support Teams were restructured in 2015 from a discipline-based to a goal-based hierarchy. Each goal\nnow has a POC and multiple goal champions. To ensure continued success, each goal POC, working with the goal\nchampions, is responsible for monitoring sustainability projects related to their respective goals. A cross cutting\nand tactical team supports efforts that span all the goals. This approach focuses on the goals and draws on the\nknowledge and experience of cross-functional resources while also uniting their efforts around the Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nsustainability vision. Responsibility for meeting the goals outlined in this SP ultimately lies with the KSC CSO. A\ndiagram of the organization and hierarchy of the sustainability team is show in Appendix 1.\n\n2.2 Success Criteria\nThroughout the year, the Center tracks its efforts in helping the Agency achieve each long-term SSPP goal by\nmeasuring KSC progress toward targets derived from those goals. The KSC Annual Report includes a goal scorecard\nthat gives a snapshot of KSC\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability performance for that year.\n\n6\n\nKSC Sustainability Five Year Plan\n\nKSC Sustainability Long-Term Success Criteria\nfor Fiscal Year (FY) 2025\nGHG Emissions Reduction\n\nReduce Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by at least 47 percent as compared to an FY 2008 baseline\nReduce Scope 3 GHG emissions by 32 percent as compared to an FY 2008 baseline\n\nSustainable Buildings\n\nReduce energy intensity (BTU/GSF) by 25 percent as compared to an FY 2015 baseline\nIdentify a percentage of the existing buildings above 5,000 square feet that are intended to be energy, waste or water net-zero\nbuildings by FY 2025 and implement actions that will allow those buildings to meet that target.

B\n\n7\n\nSection 3\n\nSustainability Goals\n3.1 Goal 1 \xe2\x80\x93 GHG Emissions Reduction\nGoal Description\nExecutive Order 13693 states that all agencies will be required to more aggressively pursue energy projects and\nenhance energy performance. NASA has set FY 2025 GHG emission reduction goals of 47 percent for scopes 1 and\n2 emissions, and 32 percent for scope 3 emissions relative to an FY 2008 baseline.\n\n3.1.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center is committed to meeting or exceeding scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions reduction targets established in\nthe NASA SSPP by proactively addressing areas of infrastructure, energy consumption, renewable energy production\nand transportation logistics. There is also a desire to increase energy awareness across the Center. These objectives\nwill be achieved by:\nScopes 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Right-sizing the KSC General Services Administration (GSA) vehicle fleet.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Procuring more electric vehicles, and promoting electric charging infrastructure to increase the number of\nKSC\xe2\x80\x99s alternate fuel vehicles (AFVs). As of FY 2016, 512 of 639 GSA vehicles at KSC are AFVs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Promoting and implementing energy conservation measures.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Increasing understanding and use of renewable energy.\nScope 3 GHG Emissions\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Installing another 29 electric vehicle charging stations, including 14 at the new Headquarters building\nbringing the total to 71 charging stations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Partnering with the KSC Visitor Complex to promote alternative fuel buses.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Optimizing the ordering and delivery processes at KSC to eliminate redundant deliveries.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Pursuing information technology solutions to expand telework program to reduce employee commuting.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Encouraging employee participation in vanpools and carpools.\nC5 Emergency Power\nStation - Oxidation\ncatalysts were installed\nat the exhaust side of\nthe engines in 2014\nreducing CO emissions\nby >= to 70%.\n\n8\n\nKSC Sustainability Five Year Plan\n\nThe Data Center\nConsolidation\nProject at KSC has\nsuccessfully migrated\nthree less efficient\nData Centers into a\nnew power efficient\nand more reliable Data\nCenter Facility.\n\n3.2 Goal 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Sustainable Buildings\nGoal Description\nThe EO states that all government agencies will promote building\nenergy conservation by reducing building energy intensity by 2.5\npercent annually, compared to an FY 2015 baseline, for a total\nof 25 percent by FY 2025, measured in British thermal units per\ngross square foot (BTU/GSF). NASA will operate and maintain its\nbuildings in a manner that reduces energy, water and material\nconsumption, thereby also achieving a reduction in operations and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs.\nThe EO states that all government agencies will identify a\npercentage of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s existing buildings above 5,000 square\nfeet that are intended to be energy, waste or water net-zero\nbuildings by FY 2025 and will implement actions that will allow\nthose buildings to meet that target. Targets will be established in\n2016.\nThe EO states that all government agencies will improve data\ncenter efficiency at agency facilities. NASA will establish a power\nusage effectiveness (PUE) target in the range of 1.2 to 1.4 for\nnew data centers and less than 1.5 for existing data centers. The\nPUE is a measure of how efficiently a computer data center uses\nenergy; specifically, how much energy is used by the computing\nequipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead).\n\n3.2.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center will strive to meet or exceed the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Sustainable\nBuilding goals by meeting the High Performance and Sustainable\nBuildings Guiding Principles for cost savings and increased\nefficiencies; operating and maintaining its buildings in a manner\nKSC-PLN-8553 Rev. B\n\nthat reduces energy, water and material consumption; improving\ndata center efficiency; reducing or consolidating unnecessary\ninfrastructure and implementing construction standards for\nsustainable building design across the Center. These objectives\nwill be achieved by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Promoting and implementing energy conservation projects.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Increasing employee awareness of unnecessary energy\nconsumption in order to reduce costs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Ensuring subject matter experts support the Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nEnergy and Water Working Groups to promote energy and\nwater conservation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Striving towards NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Net Zero Energy Buildings\nobjective by 2020 by using Leadership in Energy and\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) principles in all facilities.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Auditing the energy impacts of facility operations and\nsystems throughout the Center.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Developing a multi-phased plan for the construction of new\nfacilities to eliminate or reduce the environmental impacts\nof buildings, improve building performance, reduce longterm O&M costs and increase worker productivity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Building a Central Campus that consolidates several\nbuildings and services into an efficient and walkable\ncampus. Phase 1 of this project replaces an aging KSC\nHeadquarters (HQ) building and will be pursuing LEED-New\nConstruction (NC) Gold certification.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Coordinating with the KSC Partnership Development Office\nto ensure that the requirement for sustainable building\nconstruction is in every new agreement, as applicable.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Migrating the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) and\nthe Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Facility (O&C)\ndata centers into the Kennedy Data Center (KDC).\n\n9\n\nEnergy Pyramid\nThe Energy Pyramid shown below provides an illustration\nof layered actions that the Center implements to reduce our\nenergy footprint. The bottom lists initial planning steps that\nthen progress up the pyramid to representative projects. In\ngeneral, implementing renewable energy projects should be\nundertaken last. At KSC, Facility Comprehensive Evaluations\n(FCEs) consist primarily of facility condition assessments and\nenergy audits. Annually, FCEs are performed on 25 percent\nof KSC\xe2\x80\x99s goal subject facilities, thus covering 100 percent of\nsuch facilities every four years. Key objectives in doing an\nFCE include characterizing current facility infrastructure and\nsystem performance, identifying energy and water conservation\n\nmeasures (ECMs and WCMs) for consideration, and generating\ncost and schedule estimates for those conservation measures.\nNew construction projects are designed to incorporate\nsustainability principles such as maximizing internal natural\nlighting, selecting carpet that minimizes volatile organic\ncompound emissions, selecting low-flow restroom fixtures, and\nusing xeriscape landscaping with native species. One new KSC\nfacility captures rainwater from the roof and uses it to flush\ntoilets and for irrigation. Many KSC facilities already use motion\nsensors to control lighting, and automated temperature set\npoints geared for worker comfort. The Center is beginning to\nuse occupancy sensors (e.g. carbon dioxide sampling) to help\n\nWind\nSolar\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nReplacement\n\nWINDOWS\n\nHeat Pumps, Furnaces,\nAir Conditioning\n\nHEATING & COOLING\n\nHeat Recovery, Solar Thermal\n\nAttic, Ducts, Walls, Foundation, Pipes\n\nWATER HEATING\n\nINSULATION & VENTILATION\n\nEnergy Star Rated PCs, Laptops, TVs, etc.\n\nWeather Stripping, Caulking, Windows and Doors\n\nAPPLIANCES\n\nAIR SEALING\n\nCFLs, Fixtures, LEDs\n\nTemperature Settings, Motion and Occupancy Sensors, Turn Off Appliances, Unplug Mobile Devices\n\nEnergy Audits, Facility Condition Assessments, New Construction Design\n\n10 KSC Sustainability Five Year Plan\n\nLIGHTING\nLOW-COST/NO-COST\nIMPROVEMENTS\nUNDERSTANDING\n\nsmart systems determine how often a facility\xe2\x80\x99s internal air needs\nto be changed/refreshed. Employees are encouraged to turn\noff computer monitors when not in use, unplug mobile devices\nwhen they are fully charged, and completely shut down their\ncomputers during off-shift hours. A number of ECMs already being\nimplemented include replacement of standard fluorescent lighting\nwith light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures, both inside and outside\nfacilities.\nAll windows at KSC are required to be properly caulked and\nmost facilities have windows that are to remain closed or are\nsealed shut. Doors without weather stripping are reported for\nmaintenance. Small appliances, personal computers, etc. are\nprocured with an eye on energy efficiency. Because KSC makes\nextensive use of centralized chiller plants, ducting between\nfacilities is always insulated. Large central boilers are being\nphased out in favor of modular boilers co-located at the facilities\nwhere they are needed, eliminating long hot water lines and their\ninherent energy losses.\nOver the years, KSC has made limited use of solar hot water\nheating systems at various locations, and has recently begun\nlooking for cost-effective heat recovery options through\ncombined heat and power systems. As heating, ventilation and air\nconditioning (HVAC) systems reach the end of their serviceable\nlife, they are being replaced with much more efficient, software\ndriven systems and subsystems. A few years ago, KSC replaced\nmany of the Apollo-era windows at the Launch Control Center\nand also the Operations and Checkout building, installing glass\nwith better thermal efficiency characteristics. As for electricity\nfrom solar energy, KSC currently has 11 Megawatts (MW) of\nphotovoltaic (PV) solar panels onsite and is planning to expand its\nPV presence with up to another 2 MW of PV panels in FY 2017.\nAlthough KSC is not harvesting wind energy at this time, the\nCenter is following technological advances being made in the\nareas of bird friendly turbines that might also do well in KSC\xe2\x80\x99s\nfairly low-wind environment. Having a skilled and knowledgeable\nwork force responsible for operating and maintaining hundreds of\nbuildings, several of which are more than fifty years old, there is\nno shortage of energy and water conservation possibilities at KSC.\n\nKSC-PLN-8553 Rev. B\n\n3.3 Goal 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Clean and\n\t\nRenewable Energy\nGoal Description\nThe EO states that all government agencies shall ensure the\npercentage of the total amount of facility energy consumed shall\nbe clean energy, accounted for by renewable electric energy and\nalternative energy:\n10 percent in FY 2016 - FY 2017\n13 percent in FY 2018 - FY 2019\n16 percent in FY 2020 - FY 2021\n20 percent in FY 2022 - FY 2023\n25 percent in FY 2025 and each year thereafter\nThe EO states that all government agencies shall ensure that the\npercentage of the total amount of facility energy consumed shall\nbe renewable energy that is not less than:\n10 percent in FY 2016 - FY 2017\n15 percent in FY 2018 - FY 2019\n20 percent in FY 2020 - FY 2021\n25 percent in FY 2022 - FY 2023\n30 percent in FY 2025 and each year thereafter\n\n3.3.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center will strive to meet or exceed the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s clean and\nrenewable energy goals by expanding KSC\xe2\x80\x99s clean and renewable\nenergy position beyond the existing solar farms. These goals will\nbe achieved by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Increasing KSC\xe2\x80\x99s renewable energy generation through\nsolar farm expansions. In 2016, the Center had more than\n11 MWs of photovoltaic (PV) panels and will add up to\nanother 2 MWs of PV panels.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Pursuing Agency funding opportunities to expand KSC\xe2\x80\x99s\nsolar energy footprint.\n11\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Investigating cost effective geothermal and combined heat\nand power applications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Partnering with public and private entities to encourage the\nuse of KSC as a renewable and/or clean energy test bed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Increasing employee awareness of the uses of renewable\nand clean energy.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Maintaining an on-going synergistic atmosphere within\nthe KSC Energy Working Group, including discussions with\nutility partners.\n\n3.4 Goal 4 - Water Use Efficiency\n\t\nand Management\nGoal Description\nThe EO states that all government agencies must improve\nwater use efficiency and management, including stormwater\nmanagement. It requires all government agencies to reduce\npotable water consumption intensity by at least 2 percent annually\nthrough FY 2025 relative to an FY 2007 baseline for a total of 36\npercent by FY 2025. This can be accomplished by identifying and\nimplementing water reduction and reuse management strategies.\nThe EO also states that each agency shall reduce industrial,\nlandscaping and agricultural water consumption use by at least 2\npercent annually relative to an FY 2007 baseline.\n\nmanagement guidance provided by the Agency. These objectives\nwill be achieved by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Gathering information and educating employees on water\nusage at KSC.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Reducing the demand on the water system by focusing on\nthe primary water users and develop specific projects to\nreduce their water utilization at the point of consumption.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Reducing flushing through water distribution system\nalterations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Defining partnership strategies with neighboring Cape\nCanaveral Air Force Station for water and wastewater flow\nto improve efficiency and reduce consumption.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Maintaining the ongoing synergistic atmosphere within the\nKSC Water Working Group, including discussions with utility\npartners.\n\n3.5 Goal 5 \xe2\x80\x93 Fleet Management\nGoal Description\n\n3.4.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center will strive to meet or exceed the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s water use\nefficiency and management goals while maintaining water quality\nstandards. The Center will also act in accordance with stormwater\n\n12 KSC Sustainability Five Year Plan\n\nThe EO states that agencies with a fleet of at least 20\nmotor vehicles will improve fleet and vehicle efficiency and\nmanagement. It requires agencies to take actions that reduce\nfleet-wide per-mile GHG emissions from agency fleet vehicles\nrelative to a new FY 2014 baseline and sets new goals for\npercentage reductions:\nNot less than 4 percent by the end of FY 2017\nNot less than 15 percent by the end of FY 2020\nNot less than 30 percent by the end of FY 2025\nThe EO requires that agencies determine the optimum fleet\ninventory, including eliminating unnecessary or non-essential\nvehicles.\n\n3.5.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center will strive to meet or exceed the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s fleet\nmanagement goal by tracking fleet-wide average GHG emissions\nand replacing existing vehicles that are nearing the end of their\nservice life with more fuel-efficient vehicles. KSC will achieve\nthese objectives by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Replacing existing vehicles nearing the end of their service\nlife with more fuel-efficient vehicles. Over the next 5 years,\nKSC will be replacing up to 94 vehicles annually.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Procuring more hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Polling the fleet user community to re-evaluate their\ntransportation needs and reduce vehicle count when\nappropriate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Promoting ride-sharing to meetings.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Increasing use of telecommunications and software for\nconducting online meetings.\n\n3.6 Goal 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Sustainable Acquisition\nGoal Description\nThe EO requires agencies to promote sustainable acquisition\nby ensuring that environmental performance and sustainability\nfactors are considered to the maximum extent practicable for all\napplicable procurements in the planning, award and execution\nphases of acquisition. It also requires that until agencies have\nachieved at least 95 percent compliance with the bio-preferred\nand bio-based purchasing requirement, an annual target must\nbe established for the number of contracts to be awarded with\nbio-preferred and bio-based criteria and a dollar value of biopreferred and bio-based products to be delivered and reported\nunder those contracts in the following FY. To establish these\ntargets, agencies shall consider the dollar value of designated biopreferred and bio-based products reported in previous years, the\nspecifications reviewed and revised for inclusion of bio-preferred\nand bio-based products, and the number of applicable product\nand service contracts to be awarded, including construction,\noperations and maintenance, food services, vehicle maintenance\nand janitorial services.\n\n3.6.1 - KSC Strategies and Actions\nThe Center will strive to meet the outlined Agency acquisition\ngoals by modernizing and streamlining its current acquisition\nprocess to ensure bio-preferred/bio-based products and services\nare procured.
