The program includes mission studies to determine energy use patterns and requirements and define specific applications for wind energy systems, wind energy resource assessment and development, and development of cost-effective components and subsystems. The program is also directed towards the development of energy storage systems to make wind powered systems firm power sources where appropriate. A 100 kW experimental wind generator (Model Zero) is being designed as a flexible test bed for a variety of system components. Designs will be developed for units in the 50 to 200 kW and 500 to 3000 kW size ranges.", "title": "The U.S.-NSF/NASA", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "Sweden", "submissionId": 19760045284, "name": "Advanced wind energy systems", "location": "Stockholm", "id": "42e4846412eb427b9e874b88310f56c3"}], "id": 19760045284, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760045284, "id": "6e80ab586d724cb8a51cfa371a5c3941", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
