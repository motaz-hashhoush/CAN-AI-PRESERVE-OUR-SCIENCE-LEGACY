Many\ndramatic remedial programs have been enacted which are showing early evidences of emerging successes; but the increasing accumulation of human\nerrors and misjudgements require unrelenting competent actions in identifying, evaluating, and eradicating base causes of environmental problems.\nPublic awareness of this situation has been growing rapidly over the\npast two decades.\n\nThere are clear examples that the enactment of land and\n\nwater resource use controls are intensifying spectacularly, and "on-land"\nactions for ameliorating, and even eliminating, abusive practices are\nmounting in number and frequency.\n\nThere are, however, on-land activities\n\nthat continue to be serious problems despite recent federal, state, and\nlocal governmental enactments for modifying or eradicating negative consequences.\nA brief consideration of some prominent current issues evoke multiple\nassociations of related problems and concerns.\n\nExploration, excavation/\n\ndrilling for energy fuels; open-pit extraction of metallic ores and aggregate soils; nuclear power generation; water and air pollution; energy\nconservation; environmental health hazards from disease-carrying\n\ninsects,\n\n-4-\n\nverrain, etc.; continuing urban intrusions into crucial, diminishing lands\nand waters; movements for rigorous growth management of urban settlements;\nthe private auto versus mass transportation; ecological and material, issues\nrelated to coastal lands, flood plains, estuarine areas, and other shore\nlands; inadequacies of urban structure; carrying capacities of the natural resource base. . .these kinds of real, on-land events will be generating needs for high priority research and remedial actions for a very long\ntime.\nAny effective addressing of such issues requires solid information. . .\ninformation of enlarged scope and detail; of high reliability; of recent\nrecording and availability; and low in acquisition cost is essential for\nachieving competent analyses which can provide the bases for effective\nformulations of policies, for decisions on remedial programs, and for implementing actions.\nClearly, remotely sensed imagery as a source for a substantial range\nof information meets all of these criteria.\n\nThe Michigan State University\n\nProject in Remote Sensing has been utilizing appropriate kinds of imagery\nin a continuing process to contribute essential information to agencies\nat all levels of government in Michigan, as well as to private organizations, for bringing about on-land actions of many kinds by which corrective and preventative measures can be carried out for preserving and conserving remaining qualities of the natural and human environments.\n\nAs an\n\nextension of the many applications accomplished within previous grant\nperiods (attention is invited to the accompanying Table 1: "Characteristics of Remote Sensing Applications in Michigan," pages 6-8), the\n\n-5-\n\nachievements within this reporting period demonstrate the persistence of\nthe MSU program in broadening the community of information users. . .\nsteadily adding to the effectiveness of state, regional, local, and some\nfederal agencies in satisfying the increasingly insistent demands for\ncompetent territorial and resource management.\nIn addition to conducting demonstration applications of remote sensing,\nthe Project faculty investigators and research staff augment these efforts\nwith various kinds of services to users, including some instruction and\ntraining.\n\nThe synopses which follow describe the individual activities\n\ncarried out during the June 1 to November 30, 1977 portion of the current\n1977-78 grant year.\nIt continues to be useful to report Project activities under the three\nbroad groupings noted in previous period reports, namely: (a) demonstration\napplications; (b) user services; (c) contracted services.\n\nNot all of these\n\nare carried out with NASA grant funds, particularly contracted services in\nwhich the user pays for all related costs.\n\nUser services often are paid\n\nfor by the beneficiaries; but in this period the two categories of service\nreported involved limited costs.\n\nFor example, the printing and distribu-\n\ntion of the Guide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan was financed by the\nMichigan State University Agricultural Experiment Station with the Michigan\nState Department of Natural Resources paying for the loose-leaf binders.\n\n-600 E\nQ i*\nto\n\na o\na -H\n\xc2\xab\n\n* 31\n\n<M a\n\nb\nO\n\ncu E a\n\nu O\n\nu\nCJ\neg\n\na b\no o\niH 1*4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xc2\xa7 u.\niH 4J\nco eg\n-< -a\nu\na u\nrH\nrH\n\nCO CU\nB U N\n\niH \xe2\x80\x94. iH\n\nC o a\n\xe2\x80\xa2r< a\n3: x\n\n\xc2\xb0 b\n\na u co\n\nE\nb CU tu\nQ B E\nUH CU iH\n\nb\n\nu\n\nE\n\nb S\n\nCO\n\n4-1\n\ntu H\n\n\xc2\xa7 \xe2\x80\xa2co 9\n0x\nco\n\nrH O\nCX O CU\n\nB b J2\n\nrH\n\ng co\n\nS rH\n00 CO\n\n3 -a\n*\nq\na\n\nCX W\n\nE b B\nSB4-1\nB\n13\nO CU IH\n0 > >\nCU iH CO\nOS\n\nU\n\nrH\n\nI\n\n1\nX\nX\n\na\n\nCO IH\n.\n\nrH\n\nb 4J\nO co\n^4\n\nE 10\n\nC rH\n\nCU\n\n"^\n\n13\n\no 5\nu\nas o\n\no\n\n& -rt\n4>J\nrH CO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\no en o u\n\n0\nCO\nC3\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nC\n4-t\n\no\n\n144\n\n00 0\nE\n\xe2\x80\xa2H O\nE\n\nE\n3\n\nW\n\nb\n\nrO\n\nc o\ne\no\n\nCU\n\n-rt\n\neu\n\ne\nto cu\n\n-H\n4J\n\n> E\n\neg eu\n\xc2\xa3i\n\n4J\n\nB q\n\nCU\nCO b\nCX\n\nO E TJ B\n14 O rH B\nV4\nO\n\n-4 b\nJ= O\nQ **4\n\ng S\nCO 3\nu -0\nCO E\n\n0\nCO\n.\n\n4J\n\n> B\neg CJ\n\niH\n\nCX\n\nTJ\n\nrH\n\n4J\n\nE\n\nCO\nrO\n\n6\n\nCO\nCU\n\nCO\n\neu B 4j b\n\xe2\x80\xa2o IH a o\n\na IH\n\nas 4-t\n\nCJ 00 00\n\ne3 -O -r^\n\nrH\n\n4J\n\n>\n\nI*.\n\nIH\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\no -a\neg\nin rH\n\nO E b\n\neg o\neg m\n>\n\nE CO\n\no a b\nb\n\nrH CJ\n\nex cx-o\n\nCX\nb\neo eu O\nb \xe2\x80\x94 1 Ji\nO CO b\n0\nrH U 3\n10 00 1\n11 E CX\nB O O\nCU -C 4J\n\nQ\n\n4J\np\n\neg\n\ncy\ng\n\nCO\n3\nrH\n13\n\nCJ co\n\ne\n\nE\n\nX\n\nb\n\nCX\n\nb\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCX\n\n4J\n\ntj o\ncu B\nCO CO\n~\xc2\xab CO\n\n13\n1\n\neu\na\ntn\n10\n\nO T3\n\xe2\x80\xa2H b\n\xc2\xa3 O\nCO\n\na\n\n3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a\nE\neg\nE\n\nX\n\n4J\n\n-H\nCO\nb\n\nrH\nCJ\nIH\n\nJ3,\nrH\n\nO\niH\nX\n\niH\n\nCU\n\nO\n\ncu cu\n\n>\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nB CJ\n\nE\n\n**\n\neu 3\n\nOS\n\nO -0\n\n1-1\n\nb\n\ni\nH\n14H\n\nCO\nCO\n\nu\n\nE\n\nCJ\n\nI\nH\n\nb\nCX\n\nCJ\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\na x\n\na\n\n0\nb \xe2\x80\xa2\ncj C\n\n10 O\nCJ C\n\nb eg\nCJ\n\niH\n\nE CJ\n\n0\n\n> cu\n\n1*4\nO\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\neu 13\nOS\n\neu\n\nrH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCJ\nCJ\nE\n\neg eg\ncu B\n\nrH\n\nO\n\nto\nb\nex\nex\n\n\xe2\x80\xa24\n\neg\n\n4J\n\na.\no\n\na\n\nCJ\n\na\nB\neu\n\n00\nB\n\ncu\n\nCO\n\n4J\n\niH\n\n^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa20 E\ni* O\nQJ\n\nrH\n\neg a o\n\nCO eg\nC -H\n-. b\n\nrH\n\no\nc\n\nCO\n\nCU\n\nE\n\nU\n\nO -H B E\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCJ b\nO eo\n\n3 eg\n\n4J\n\nO T<\n\nU\n\nUJ\n\nE\n\nu\n\niH\n\neg c3 0} \xe2\x80\xa2\n.s i o. ta\n\nO\n\neg\n\nCJ\n\nTJ\n\nJS -H 4J\n\neu\n\nC -H b\n\n4J\n\n_4\n\n>\n\n09\nU\n\nO \xc2\xa3.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4-1 CD\n10 >*\xe2\x80\xa2\n-3 -H\n\nCO\n\nE\n00 O\nC ^\n\nCO\n\nb\n\nJ3\n\nB\n\nCO\n\n00 rH\n\nco eg cu\ne S b\no eg o\n\na eo \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nO\n\nV O\nO\n\n1\n\nUH eg c\nCO\no\n\nQ W\n\nca\nc\no\n\nX\n4J TJ\nB B\n\n|\n\nCJ\nCU\n\nc\n\nO\n\n4J\n\n13\nE u\nO O\n-r4\n4J\nCJ\n\nrH\n4-t\n\nCO\n\nE\n\nrH\n\nO\n\neg rH\n\nCO\n\nC.\n\n1*4\n-O "44\n\nCU\n\nCO\n\na oo\na.

Mason Building\nLansing, Michigan 48909\n\nOn August 3, 1972 the Governor of the State of Michigan approved House\nBill No. 4881, the "Wilderness and Natural Areas Act."\n\nThis bill authorizes\n\nthe state to create and regulate tracts of undeveloped state land or water\nfor natural preservation.\n\nResponsible for identification and recommenda-\n\ntion of these "wild areas," is the Michigan Department of Natural Resources\n(DNR).\n\nThe purpose of setting aside wild areas is to provide wilderness-\n\nlike areas in relative proximity to urban centers of more than 100,000 population that will offer outstanding opportunity for solitude and an environment for primitive and unconfined types of recreation.\n\nOnce dedicated,\n\nspecific activities are prohibited on these lands such as altering vegetation, creation of easements, mineral exploration and commercial enterprise.\nAlthough the Act has been in existence over five years-, no areas to\ndate have been set aside or dedicated as wild areas.\n\nThe provisions of\n\nsuch areas near large clusters of population, as the legislators intended,\nis indeed statutory.\n\nThe DNR, therefore, needs an inventory of potential\n\nwild areas in the southern lower peninsula of Michigan\xe2\x80\x94both those on private lands (for potential acquisition) and those on public lands (for possible dedication).\n\nThe DNR has requested assistance from the Remote Sens-\n\ning Project to develop an inventory methodology by which the DNR or MSU\nunder a contractual arrangement can identify wild areas throughout the\nState.\n\n-14-\n\nInvestigators for the Remote Sensing Project are currently involved\nin a study to develop a workable procedure for determining wild area locations near urban areas in Southern Lower Michigan.\n\nSubsequently, the pro-\n\ncedure is being applied to selected study sites to test its feasibility\nand to detect and eliminate problem sources.\n\nStudy Site\nThe study area (Fig. 2) consists of 6 counties in Southern Lower\nMichigan which the investigators believe offer a diverse variety of geography.\n\nThe variety of terrain, from flat lake beds in Bay County to the\n\nmoraine systems of Livingston County to sand dunes of Allegan County have\nbeen chosen to provide a rigorous test of wild area criteria that could\neventually be refined and applied throughout the entire Lower Peninsula.\n\nCriteria\nA list of criteria has been designed in outline form consisting of\nmany physical properties which could be expected to be found in the Lower\nPeninsula of Michigan (Fig. 3).\n\nSite characteristics such as relief, soils,\n\nlandforms, vegetation, hydrography are those which will need consideration\nin determining suitability for "wild area", designation

Scheme\nTo aid in the ordering of the desirability of "wild areas," a numerical\nvalue has been assigned to each portion of the checklist.\n\nFor example, if\n\ntwo sites are found containing different landforms, the one consisting of a\nriver cut bluff or cliff will be given a higher numerical value (grade) over\nan area completely made up of a gently sloping outwash plain.\n\nAll of these\n\nweight factors will be totaled for each potential "wild area" site, giving\na numerical total for each area.\n\nIn this way it will be possible to take\n\nthe great variety of natural features in a sample area and quantify them in\nan attempt to determine which of these areas will be best suited to be assigned as "wild areas."\nAs a method of implementing this grading procedure a checklist including numerical values has been drawn up by examining three sources of land\ncover/use information.\n\nThis list also provides a tally of available infor-\n\nmation from each of three identification sources.\n\nSource Level One\xe2\x80\x94Orbital Imagery\nThe initial identification of potential wild area locations is being\ndetermined from imagery taken from orbiting spacecraft.\n\n2\nAn initial search was undertaken using an I S Color Additive Viewer\nand LANDSAT imagery chips (bands 4, 5, 6, 7) of scenes which included each\nstudy county.\n\nGeneral "natural areas" maps were traced from these scenes,\n\noutlining large tracts of land which seemed likely to contain undisturbed\nacreage.\n\nA more detailed search is planned using LANDSAT false color com-\n\nposite transparencies.\n\nIt has been determined in a preliminary search with\n\none such scene containing Ionia County, that undeveloped forested areas show\n\n-18-\n\nup quite well under magnification.\n\nThis gives a good indication of locations\n\nsuitable for further, more scrutinizing evaluation.\nFrames of 70 mm. CIR SKYLAB photography, now being assembled, will also\nbe used to interpret broad scale features.\n\nAdditional detail not detected\n\nfrom LANDSAT will hopefully be visible on the larger scale SKYLAB photography .\nUsed in conjunction, orbiting spacecraft imagery will provide information in locating potential wild area sites and will give clues as to the\nspecific site characteristics of each.\n\nSource Level Two\xe2\x80\x94High & Medium Altitude Imagery\nTo better substantiate this initial search, a second review of the entire test area has taken place through interpretation of high altitude color\ninfrared photography taken from NASA aircraft at scales of 1:120,000, 1:60,000\nand 1:36,000.\n\nDuring this step in the procedure, areas delimited using LAND-\n\nSAT scenes which, upon closer inspection, did not meet "wild area" criteria\n(i.e., size: > 80 acres, < 3,000) were eliminated from consideration.\n\nCon-\n\nversely, smaller areas, which were overlooked using orbiting spacecraft imagery have been added to the potential list.\n\nAll considered areas have been\n\ndelineated on acetate overlays, measured in size using an overlay grid and\ntabulated.\n\nAt the completion of the first phase of this search, the number\n\nof potential wild areas by county are listed below.\nCounty\nAllegan\nBay\nBranch\nIonia\nLivingston\nSt. Clair\n\n// of WA Sites\n14\n7\n6\n5\n5\n12\n\nTotal Acreage\n9,030\n8,060\n1,775\n2,960\n3,200\n7,300\n\n-19-\n\nSource Level Three\xe2\x80\x94Maps\nAs a supplement to aerial photography and space imagery interpretation,\na third source of land use/cover information will be consulted.\n\nThis will\n\nincorporate the use of topographic, soils, and land use maps to extract\nadditional information which would be difficult, if not impossible to detect from photographs.\n\nData such as local relief, soil type and texture,\n\nslope, and drainage characteristics will be recorded for each potential\narea.\n\nAs in previous steps, a grading scheme will be applied to the re-\n\nsults of this portion of the investigation.\n\nField Check\nThe final step in the evaluation of potential wild area sites will\nconsist of on-site investigation.\n\nA number of potential "wild areas" will\n\nbe identified using the three sources of information.\n\nInvestigators will,\n\nas a final interpretation, inspect each area to determine 1) off-site quality, 2) human influences to the area, and 3) other considerations which may\nnot have been recognized through remote sensing evaluation.\n\nConclusion\nUltimately the DNR will be provided with a procedural scheme which can\nbe adapted to variation in study site size.\n\nShould a large area (state or\n\nregion) be chosen for "wild area" evaluation, techniques implementing LANDSAT and SKYLAB imagery will be more time/cost efficient and provide a good\nanalysis of potential "wild area" locations.\n\nIf a closer inspection is de-\n\nsired (county level), techniques applied to high and medium altitude aerial\nimagery analysis and the use of base and thematic maps can be used providing\nan even more scrutinizing search for wild areas.\n\n-20-\n\nThe limit to which each of these source levels can be applied to the\nsearch for wild area locations will become more apparent as they are more\nthoroughly evaluated by the use of the proposed grading scheme.\n\n-21-\n\nA3.\n\nMuskegon Sand Mining Inventory\nGeology Division\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources\nStevens T. Mason Building\nLansing, Michigan 48909\n\nIntroduction\nRecently, the bill aimed at protecting sand dunes along Michigan\'s\nGreat Lakes shoreline received final legislative approval.\n\nThe "Sand\n\nDune Protection and Management Act" (Act No. 222, State of Michigan,\nJuly 30, 1976) provides for study, protection and management of shoreland\ndunes, prescribing power and duties to the Michigan Department of Natural\nResources (DNR) for administration and enforcement, primarily in the zone\nwithin two miles of the ordinary highwater mark.\n\nA major part of the Act\n\ncalls for a comprehensive study and inventory of sand mining practices and\ntheir environmental impact.\nA specific management objective deals with sand mining operations\naffecting the future existence and use of major sand dune complexes along\nMichigan\'s\n\nshoreline.\n\nSuch a detailed assessment process aimed at qualifying and quantifying environmental indicators in areas with highly dynamic characteristics,\ncaused by natural and man-made processes seemed to present an excellent\nopportunity for remote sensing\n\ninvolvement.\n\nThe selection of the appropriate remote sensing techniques would allow\nfor a great flexibility in data extraction and ensure both the appropriate\nlevel of detail and timeliness of information, this being an essential\n\n-22-\n\nprerequisite in adequate management and law enforcement practices.\nMeetings between DNR\'s Geology Division and the Michigan State University Remote Sensing Project (RSP) resulted in the development of two inventory procedures for a selected test area.\n\nThe first one, to be carried out\n\nby the DNR, using readily available information such as USGS maps, ownership information and limited field data and the second one to be carried\nout by the Remote Sensing Project utilizing remote sensing sources, techniques, etc.\n\nThe Remote Sensing Project Inventory Procedure\nThe procedure as used in the Muskegon Sand Mining Inventory is outlined in Figure 4 (solid lines).\n\nThe Muskegon test area was selected\n\nbecause it represents one of the highest priority areas for inventory\nwork, and also because it is large enough to be representative, in terms\nof procedural developments and costs involved, for determining a statewide sand mining inventory effort.\nThe basic source of remote sensing imagery selected for use in manual\ninterpretation was NASA high altitude photography, Mission 103, scale\n1:118,000, flown on September 10, 1969, from 10.00-11.15 local time.\nFrames #5831, 5778, and 5779 cover the entire study area.\n\nFrames //70,\n\n71 and 98 from the same mission, but at the larger scale (1:59,000), were\nused to compare the manual interpretation and delineation of the sites on\nthe 1:118,000 imagery.\n\nMission 114, CIR (1:120,000), flown on September\n\n19, 1970 from 15.00-16.00 local time, was used to study the potential increase in surface mining acreage of the sites existing in September 1969,\n\n-23-\n\nSELECT PRIORITY AREAS\nFOR SANDMINING\nINVENTORY\n\nSELECT APPROPRIATE\nR,S, IMAGERY FOR\nSELECTED DUNE COMPLEX\n\nCOLLECT SANDMINING\nDATA ROM\nSECONDARY

sites appeared to have been mined during this period.\nAfter delineation of the sites on the CIR transparencies and transfer\nto 1:24,000 base maps, a low altitude aerial survey was carried out for\nthe entire test area.\n\nPhoto coverage was acquired for all of the 46\n\npotential sand mining sites.\n\nWith the use of a Bausch and Lomb 240 zoom\n\nstereoscope and a maximum magnification factor of 34, it was possible to\nverify the manual interpretation of the CIR high altitude imagery.\n\nThis\n\nproved especially useful for the smaller sites of 1 to 5 acres, that showed\nup as significant high reflectivity areas on the 1:118,000 scale photography,\nbut for which, because of a lack of specific interpretation features, a positive identification was hard to make.\nThe 35 mm. coverage allowed not only for a positive differentiation\nbetween small natural blow out areas and very small borrow pit/mining sites,\nbut made it also possible to differentiate between the active and nonactive status of the site, since sharply defined edges of man-made origin\nwere clearly visible on the images, especially if photographed with an\nappropriate sun-angle.\n\nFor about 15% of the mostly smaller sites, field\n\nchecks were carried out. In most cases these sites proved to be of transitory nature (construction) and were then classified as such.\nAfter the final updating and verifying process, areal measurements\nwere carried out using a standard dot grid over the corrected sites on\nthe base map.\nTable 2 lists all the identified sites, their surface area, the final\nclassification and the status of the mining site.\n\n-25-\n\nTable 2.\xe2\x80\x94List of Identified Potential Mining Areas by Means of Manual Interpretation of CIR Image, September 1969.

the Geological Survey of the\nDNR combines topographic relief information (primary dune complexes) with\nsoil information and ownership data of the major sand mining companies in\nthe area.\n\nUtilizing this procedure, the future potential for sand mining,\n\nbased on soil suitability and ownership parameters can be assessed.\n\nThe\n\ncurrent status of the large active sites in terms of total acreage being\nmined has not been determined.\n\nWith the information available to the DNR,\n\nthe three (major) sand mining operations have been identified for the\nMuskegon test area.\n\nThe estimated inventory cost involved amounts to\n\napproximately $250 for the complete area, including the preparation of\ncolor coded overlays on the 1:24,000 base maps, field checks, etc.\nThe Remote Sensing Project inventory identified a total of 10 active\nand 12 inactive mining sites in the test area.\n\nThese sites include the\n\nsmaller borrow pit areas which might or might not be in commercial use.\nHowever, as far as legal implications are concerned, they represent, in\nmany cases, illegal sand mining activities.\nThe RSP inventory is accurate, complete and current (July 1977) as\nfar as land use/mining information classification is concerned.\n\nThe sur-\n\nface area calculations are, however, based on the delineation of high reflectivity areas on the 1969 NASA imagery.\n\nUpdated and highly accurate\n\nacreage calculations could be acquired using low altitude 70 mm. coverage\nfor selected sites.\nThe current status of the sand mining sites reflects the photointerpretation based on surface texture of high reflectivity areas, shape, tonal\n\n-27-\n\nvariation and other clues of the particular site under investigation.\n\nIn\n\nsome cases where a borrow pit operation is concerned, the extent of the\nmining impact is so minimal that actual field checks might be required.\nIn the RSP inventory, field checks were carried out in all cases where\nany reasonable doubt existed about a definite classification.\nThe inventory cost per square mile was estimated at $10.30.\n\nThis\n\namounts to $31.84 per site identified and surveyed in the Muskegon test\narea.\n\nConclusions\nA number of conclusions can be drawn from the case study.\n\nProbably\n\nmost important is that by utilizing remote sensing techniques, it is possible to accurately inventory a relatively large area (68 square miles)\nwithin a limited time period and at a relatively low cost.\n\nThe informa-\n\ntion gathered is up to date, allowing for immediate legal action in case\nof discovered violations.\n\nIt provides, utilizing a time comparative analysis\n\napproach, the potential to assess past and future trends in sand mining,\nbroken down by planning area if so desired.\n\nThis type of analysis and the\n\nderived information would permit local and state decision makers to quantify\nthe environmental impact of surface mining, and to use the information as a\nbasis for the review of future permit applications.\n\nFurthermore, it is\n\nrelatively easy to update the current status and the areal extent of the\noperation on a continuous basis, after initial identification of the mining\nsites.\n\n-28-\n\nRecommendations\nA)\n\nBased on the inventory carried out in this case study, a procedure\n\nis proposed for future sand mining inventory work (see Fig. 4).\n\nThis pro-\n\ncedure allows for a systematic updating of the information gathered, based\non a selected updating cycle and a resolution level (information unit).\nThe cycle could vary from 1 to 4 times a year and the resolution level desired to monitor in detail mining impact over time could be 2.5 to 10 acres\n(1 to 4 ha. based on a UTM information grid).\nIn order to facilitate the updating procedure, a geographic information system should be designed which will allow for the systematic storage, retrieval and analysis of data in combination with appropriate location identifiers.\nB)\n\nResearch should be carried out to evaluate the best scale and type\n\nof aerial photography suitable to provide the desired level of detail of\ninformation needed for inventory and updating procedures.\n\nIn efforts to\n\nmonitor in detail the areal impact of the mining operation, the utilization of ground panels for survey purposes should be studied.\nWithin this basic research framework, a continuous evaluation\nshould be carried out of the overall remote sensing potential (platform\nlevels, systems, etc.) in order to determine the best method for data\nextraction, while taking into consideration time, cost and accuracy\nparameters.\nOutcome\nAs a result of this demonstration application conducted under the\nNASA grant, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has contracted\n\n-29-\n\nwith the Remote Sensing Project for the development of procedures to monitor sand mining activities in Michigan and to prepare an inventory of sand\nmining sites along the Lake Michigan Shoreline (see Contract Activity, C2\nreported elsewhere in this report).\n\n-30-\n\nA4.\n\nPreservation of the Grand Mere Dune Environment\nGrand Mere Association\nP.O. Box 140\nStevensville, Michigan 49127\n\nThe Grand Mere Area represents one of Michigan\'s most unique dune environments.\n\nIts uniqueness is based on the great diversity of ecosystems\n\nrepresented in the area; dunes (stable and unstable), open beaches, wooded\nuplands, wetlands, and lakes.\n\nThe Grand Mere Association, a group of citi-\n\nzens concerned with the preservation of this unique complex, has maintained\nfor the past three years a close working relationship with the NASA/MSU\nRemote Sensing Project.\n\nThey have expressed concerns in terms of informa-\n\ntion requirements allowing for improved management decisions of the lands\nowned by the Association and the assessment of new land acquisition priorities.\nLow altitude 70 mm. color aerial coverage was acquired in November\n1977 to update the environmental information of the Grand Mere Complex.\nCopies of the photography were supplied to a conservationist employed by\nthe Grand Mere Association, to be used for the mapping of the vegetation\ncover.\nAnalysis of the recession rates of vegetation as a result of intensive off-road-vehicle (ORV) use has provided data which the Grand Mere\nAssociation used to convince local property owners and township authorities of the need to prohibit ORV use in the area.\n\nAdditional funding was\n\nprovided to enforce this action by use of intensified police patrols resulting in approximately 200 traffic citations in the spring of 1977.\n\n-31-\n\nAnalysis of the November 1977 imagery has shown that this policy has\nresulted in a significant regrowth of vegetation.\nselected show an increase in vegetation cover.\n\nThe two sample areas\n\nFor sample area #1 an in-\n\ncrease of 2.635% and for sample area //2 an increase of 2.179%.\n\nThis means\n\na relative increase in vegetation regrowth of 8.52% for sample area //I, and\nof 4.44% for sample area #2.\n\nThe vegetation recession trend has been re-\n\nversed due to cooperation betx^een authorities and a concerned citizen\ngroup, based on information provided by the NASA/MSU Remote Sensing Project.\nIt is essential to monitor the status of the Grand Mere environment\nas a response to management practices, recreation use intensities, erosion\ndynamics, etc. in the future.\n\nA close working relationship between the\n\nGrand Mere Association and the Remote Sensing Project as established has\nprovided an excellent case study environment for environmental management\nefforts and examplifies the unique value of remote sensing techniques for\nareas x^ith similar characteristics as wildlife areas, state parks, etc.\n\n-32-\n\nB.\n\nU S E R\n\nS E R V I C E S\n\nConducting demonstration applications understandably generate demands\nfor further information by users.\n\nAs agency knowledge and expertise in\n\nremote sensing materials and methods develop, the need for review, instruction and updating becomes unavoidable.\n\nProject personnel routinely provide\n\nconsultation on relevant aspects of imagery usage, issue illustrative materials and offer guidance to foster further application engagements by current and prospective users.\nIn these ways the MSU Project staff serves as a reference service for\nan increasing number of public and private organizations.\n\nThis kind of a\n\nservice function involves providing NASA-generated imagery, training in the\nuse of equipment, giving other general technical assistance, and directing\ninquirers to appropriate sources of further materials and information (books,\narticles, conference proceedings, manufacturers\' catalogs, symposia, workshops, etc.).\nMore specifically, user services, among a larger checklist, commonly\ninclude such assistance activities as 1) problem identification; 2) data\nsource identification; 3) data classification procedures; 4) identification of decisions that need to be made (policy and action choices); 5) determining data efficiencies to get at the policy and action choices; 6)\nassistance in identifying available imagery; 7) assistance in acquiring\navailable imagery and equipment; 8) providing estimates of cost for conducting particular studies; 9) imagery interpretation training; 10) merging remotely-sensed data with other natural and cultural resource information (e.g. ground truth).\n\n-33-\n\nAny combination of such assistance activities produces varying scopes\nand intensities of primary instruction for selected agency personnel,\nthereby making them aware of the capabilities of remote sensing for dayto-day and long term needs.\nOther than the on-going myriad routine activities of serving users\nduring this reporting period, only tv/o major user services occurred which\ndeserve special mention.\n\nThe first one is atypical of the customary range\n\nof user services, and involves endeavors within the University community by\nthe Project leaders to petition for and receive official standing as a research and service unit.\n\nThis would provide a basic nucleus of continuing\n\nannual budget whereby Project continuity can be achieved and the scope of\nundertakings can be substantively broadened.\n\nSuch activities have limited\n\n"service" connotations except as related to the continuing effectiveness\nof the Remote Sensing Project.\nThe second citation describes a newly developing dimension which has\nthe potential of becoming a major service function to an untapped, enormous\npotential clientele throughout Michigan reached via the extensive network\nof the Michigan Cooperative Extension Service.\nthis activity of service a dominant function.\n\nThis involvement can make\n\n-34-\n\nBl.\n\nInstitutionalization of the Remote Sensing Project\n\nThe Michigan State University Remote Sensing Project has been in operation since 1971.\n\nOver the intervening years it has been a highly effective\n\nmulti-disciplinary group of faculty, research specialists, and graduate research assistants from the academic disciplines of botany and plant pathology, computer science (engineering), crop and soil sciences, forestry,\ngeography, geology, resource development, urban planning and landscape\narchitecture.\n\nThese areas are represented by eight University departments\n\nand schools, four colleges, plus the Agricultural Experiment Station and\nthe Cooperative Extension Service.\n\nAs of the end of this reporting period,\n\nnine faculty members participate actively, with four full-time research\nspecialists and a varying number (10-15) of graduate and undergraduate research assistants (see Acknowledgements, page 2).\nThe cohesiveness and productivity of this unit continues to be most\nencouraging and intellectually profitable; but it has been operating without any official recognition by the University administrative hierarchy.\nThe success of this Project continues to be engendered by three main\nforces: 1) by a strong mutual interest and motivation in the utility of\nremote sensing technology as an important instrument for societal needs;\n2) by a remarkable collegiality; and 3) by the continuing generous financial support from the Office of University Affairs of NASA.\nAs broad recognition for the work produced by the Project has grown\nthroughout Michigan, so have opportunities to serve a larger clientele,\nto engage in a greater variety of research and service activities beyond\n\n-35-\n\nth e scope of work agreed upon for coverage by the NASA Grant, and to build\ntoward a more assured continuity.\n\nProject leaders judged that the collec-\n\ntive operations in remote sensing should be officially recognized by the\nUniversity by endowing it with the status of a "center" or "institute" and\nproviding an annual budget for a small permanent administrative staff with\na given basic scope of continuing operation. . .to institutionalize the ongoing research and service functions being carried forward by the MSU Project\nin Remote Sensing.\nDuring this reporting period, major steps were initiated in seeking\nthis objective.\n\nFour major component goals are now being programmed as\n\nan overall organizational strategy:\n1.\n\nFamiliarize Key Administrators.\n\nThe Project has been in opera-\n\ntion for seven years and has significant achievements which have\nnot always been made fully evident to key administrators within\nthe University.\n\nAs a first priority, meetings were conducted to\n\nfamiliarize such officials (chairmen of participating departments\nand schools, college deans and directors, and central University\nadministrators) with the demonstration applications, the range\nof user services, and the increasing contract activities of the\nRemote Sensing Project.\n2.\n\nAdopt Functional Objectives.\n\nIn order to avoid any potential\n\nproblems of overlapping objectives with other University units,\na statement of functional objectives, both current and future,\nwill be the focus of subsequent discussions with key administrators.\n\n-36-\n\n3.\n\nReach Agreements.\n\nWith objectives clarified, it is intended that\n\nagreements regarding the nature of the institutionalized practices\n. . .organizational structure and operational scope and substance\n. . .will be reached by the faculty investigators, research staff,\ndepartment chairmen and college deans and directors.\n4.\n\nEffect Funding.\n\nAgreement on the nature of an institutionalized\n\nRemote Sensing Project between these multiple parties will then\nallow the identification of funding mechanisms and sources, and\nthe formulation of budgeting requests for the Project\'s future\noperations.\nAs of this reporting, Project familiarization sessions have been conducted with the Directors of the Agricultural Experiment Station (AES),\nthe Cooperative Extension Service (CES), and the Deans of the Colleges of\nSocial Science, Natural Science, and Engineering.\n\nThese presentations\n\nwere well received and the administrators expressed general support for\nthe institutionalization concept.\ncific proposal.\n\nThey encouraged formulation of a spe-\n\nThe Directors of AES and CES want to participate in ex-\n\npanding the scope of certain Project applications and services to a wider\naudience in the State (see section B2 of this report, which describes\nproposed initial activities under Cooperation Extension Service support).\nProject investigators are now clarifying the objectives of a proposed\n"center" (component #2), and will subsequently work on components of\n"Agreements" (#3), and the elements of budget support (#4).\n\nCompletion\n\nof the proposal and achievement of the official center is planned this\nyear.\n\n-37-\n\nB2.\n\nWorking Association with the Cooperative Extension Service\n\nArrangements were initiated to work with the Michigan State University\nCooperative Extension Service (CES) to provide remote sensing materials, assistance in program development, and in-service training to the county extension directors, as well as to appropriate program specialists and other staff.\nIt is expected that through this network of key CES personnel, many individuals, private enterprises, and local planning and management agencies will\nbe informed of the MSU remote sensing services.\nAs an initial step in this new association, a questionnaire was developed\nby which CES personnel interest in these various remote sensing services could\nbe surveyed and evaluated.\n\nThe questionnaire was scheduled for distribution\n\nearly in January 1977 to the substantial roster of county extension directors\nas part of a package of informational materials, including the newly published\nGuide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan.* As reported in the preceding Progress\nReport (December 1976-May 1977), preparation of the Guide to Aerial Imagery\nof Michigan had been a continuing effort for over two years.\n\nIt was built\n\nupon an earlier, more limited "Guide" and resulted in a document of considerable magnitude providing information on the full range of available remotely sensed imagery of Michigan.\n\nThe Director of the Cooperative Extension\n\nService pledged some financial support to compile responses to the questionnaire as well as assistance for other services, such as reproducing and distributing Remote Sensing Project publications, including appropriate followup activities*.\nIn these negotiations it was agreed that longer term efforts, with CES\nsupport, will focus on several other program objectives, namely: 1) the compilation of an index of basic natural resource information for the State, an\n\n* So accomplished as of February 1978.\n\n-38-\n\neffort which will update and expand upon the Mapping and Photography Directory prepared by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources; 2) the development of educational programs on "Natural Resources Inventory and Land Use"\nin cooperation with the Division of Land Programs in the Michigan Department\nof Natural Resources; and 3) the establishment of in-service remote sensing\nprograms for extension directors and local groups within the State.\nThe CES is an integral part of the University with representatives living in the local communities and closely related to people and their problems.\n\nCounty extension staff (or "agents") are located in each of Michigan\'s\n\n80 County Extension Service offices.\n\nProgram specialists in more than 26\n\nsubject-matter fields support the field staff in programs which require\nspecial knowledge to solve local problems.\nThe overall objective of the CES is to provide educational programs to\nhelp individuals and groups to make sound decisions to earn and manage in/\ncome, develop talents and capacities, foster optimum living environment for\nfamily and individual, and plan for wise use of natural resources and create\nbetter communities in which to live and work.\nA working association with the CES can carry considerable significance\nfor extending knowledge about remote sensing, reaching a substantial new\nclientele throughout Michigan, and possibly for opening up new opportunities for innovative demonstration applications.\n\nWith support from the CES,\n\nother kinds of service-related activities could be handled more effectively,\nsuch as responding to inquiries about remote sensing, with the general result of allowing research staff to concentrate with less interruption on\nNASA Grant related studies.\n\nThese kinds of benefits could reduce demands\n\non the NASA Grant funds and strengthen the effectiveness of the grantsupported research.\n\n-39-\n\nC.\n\nC O N T R A C T U A L\n\nS E R V I C E S\n\nJust as the steady flow of Project demonstration applications has generated an increasing amount of user services, it has also created a contractual demand for information derived from remotely-sensed data.\n\nMost agen-\n\ncies now have a rudimentary understanding of remote sensing techniques,\nhowever, they cannot afford to employ and retain staff with photointerpretation and cartographic skills to meet periodic needs.\n\nNeither do\n\nthey have the necessary equipment to derive the essential information from\nremotely-sensed data.\nWith more and more LANDSAT imagery becoming commonly available and\nused, considerable expertise is needed for both "manual" (visual) and digital interpretation.\n\nVery few private and public organizations have capa-\n\nbilities of deriving information from this source and they must therefore\ndepend on contracted services.\nLANDSAT 3\'s improved image resolution and quality will certainly increase this dependency on special contractors.\nThe MSU Project has been called upon repeatedly to provide such services when an application does not meet the established criteria for a\nNASA funded demonstration cited in Section A, Demonstration Applications\n(see page 9).\n\nThey have been performed for a variety of private organi-\n\nzations and federal, state, regional, and local government agencies.\n\nAll\n\nexpenditures are cost reimbursable unless some part of the service involves\na demonstration application.\n\nIn this situation, the agency pays for all\n\ncosts other than the innovative application research.\n\nAll of the follow-\n\ning contractual activities are on a cost reimbursable basis.\n\n-40-\n\nCl.\n\nComprehensive Resource Inventory and Evaluation System (CRIES)\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nEconomics, Statistics, and Cooperatives Service\nRoom 305, Manly Miles Building\n1405 South Harrison Road\nEast Lansing, Michigan 48823\n\nThe CRIES project continued throughout this reporting period. CRIES\nis a cooperative program between Michigan State University and the Economic\nResearch Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is funded by the\nAgency for International Development.\n\nThe objective of the project is to\n\ncreate the technical skills and institutional capabilities of developing\ncountries to conduct agricultural planning and other resource management\nstudies.\n\nThe project is a multi-agency and multi-disciplinary effort.\n\nThe Remote Sensing Project at MSU is contributing technical skills and\nservices in two major project areas: remote sensing and geographic information system development.\nDuring this reporting period, the LANDSAT test in the Dominican\nRepublic was completed and a report issued (reference #62 in Appendix).\nThe test comprised four test areas within the Dominican Republic, two of\nwhich were interpreted visually using LANDSAT imagery and digitally using\nthe LANDSAT data tapes.\n\nA comparison of results, costs, and benefits of\n\napplications for the two approaches is currently underway.\n\nAs an exten-\n\nsion of the remote sensing activity, preliminary plans were drawn up and\napproved to conduct a land use/cover inventory of Cost Rica using visual\ninterpretation of LANDSAT imagery.\n\nThis activity will be a more involved\n\none that in the Dominican Republic, with the data derived from LANDSAT\n\n-41-\n\ncontributing to a major extent in the subsequent economic analysis models\nof the CRIES project.\nThe Resource Analysis Program (RAP), which has been under development\nby the Remote Sensing Project for several years, was selected to comprise\nthe analytical program component of a national mapping system being installed in the Dominican Republic as part of the CRIES project.\n\nPlans for\n\ncustomizing the computer program to the needs of the Dominicans were developed.\n\nBy the end of the reporting period, the program was being con-\n\nverted from a CDC computer to an IBM 370/115, the host computer in the\nDominican Republic.\n\nThe compilation of the Dominican map data files was\n\ncompleted during this time period. The files contain data on km\ncells for an area of 300 km. by 400 km.\n\n2\n\ngrid\n\nThere are nine maps currently\n\nstored in these map files, resulting in nearly 1.1 million data elements\nin the map files.\n\nPreliminary activity also began regarding geographic\n\ninformation systems in the other CRIES cooperating countries, Costa Rica\nand Nicaragua.\n\n-42-\n\nC2.\n\nInventory of Sand Mining Sites in Michigan\'s High-Priority\nSand Dune Areas\nGeology Division\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources\nStevens T. Mason Building\nLansing, Michigan 48909\n\nThe objectives of this contract are: 1) determine the optimal remote\nsensing techniques and information system structure to periodically monitor\nsand mining activities; 2) acquire aerial photography of sand mining operations in the high-priority sand dune areas of Michigan; 3) prepare an inventory of sand mining activities in the high-priority sand dune areas of\nMichigan utilizing the information generated in objective one; and 4) develop a sand mining surveillance procedure manual.\nvThe\n\nproposed research and inventory efforts are aimed at satisfying\n\nthe sand mining monitoring requirement of the "Sand Dune Protection and\nManagement Act," (Act No. 222, State of Michigan, July 30, 1976) a direct\nspin-off from a recent case study in the Muskegon area carried out under\nthe NASA grant (see Application Activity A3, page 21 in this report).\nThe main research objective is to develop efficient cost effective\ndata extraction and analysis procedures for providing accurate and upto-date information on sand mining activities.\n\nThis information should\n\nbe suitable for the legal enforcement of the sand mining legislation and\nshould provide basic information for the evaluation of permit applications\nfor future sand mining operations.\nThis effort will focus on the development of appropriate inventory\nprocedures utilizing remote sensing techniques, associated data extraction,\n\n-43-\n\nstorage, retrieval, and updating procedures within the framework of a geographical information system.\n\nA secondary research objective will be the\n\ndevelopment and evaluation of tools to monitor and survey sand mining activities over time.\n\nGround and aerial survey techniques will be studied to\n\npinpoint the areal extent of mining sites utilizing specific survey panels\nof selected size, shape,\'color, construction, etc.\nUsing the research findings, an inventory will be carried out for\nseven high-priority sand dune areas along the Lake Michigan Shoreline\n(a total area of approximately 188 square miles).\nThe inventory procedure for the high-priority areas will include the\nacquisition of 35 mm. color oblique photography of all identified sites,\nand more detailed, larger scale 70 mm. vertical color infrared or color\nphotography of selected sand mining operations where area and volume\nmeasurements are required.\nThe result of this research will be prepared in the form of recommendations for inventory and monitoring procedures.\n\nThe results of the\n\ndetailed inventory will be presented according to the selected information system format including the compiled photo base of 35 and 70 mm.\nphotography.\n\n-44-\n\nC3.\n\nInventory of Sand Dune Types in Michigan\'s High-Priority Sand\nDune Areas\nGeology Division\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources\nStevens T. Mason Building\nLansing, Michigan 48909\n\nThe Sand Dune Protection and Management Act (State of Michigan, Act\n222, 1976) calls for an inventory of the barrier dunes along the Great\nLakes Shoreline in the State.\n\nThis contract is aimed at developing an\n\ninventory through the analysis of aerial imagery available from several\nsources in the State including the MSU Remote Sensing Project, and the\nMichigan Department of State Highways and Transportation.\nPreliminary work by Project personnel under the NASA Grant has established the feasibility of using aerial imagery for delimitation of\ndune complexes in the Grand Mere Area of Michigan (reported in the previous Semi-Annual Progress Report, December 1976-May 1977 and reference\n//60 in the Appendix of this report) .\nScientific documentation on Michigan\'s dune lands is, however, incomplete with respect to typology dynamics and human use so that preliminary definitional work will be necessary before the inventory is attempted.\n\nWith adequate definitions, remote sensing techniques can pro-\n\nvide the inventory information necessary to evaluate barrier dunes and\n"their effect on aesthetic, environmental, economic and agricultural interests in this state" (Act 222, Section 3d).\nThe objectives of this contract are: 1) to develop a classification\nsystem by which the various dune types of the state can be defined on the\n\n-45-\n\nbasis of their morphologic (quantitative and qualitative) characteristics,\nand 2) use appropriate remote sensing techniques to inventory all dune\ntypes and land uses within selected high-priority areas along Lake Michigan.\nThe inventory will specifically allow identification and designation of\nbarrier dunes as required by the Sand Dune Protection and Management Act\n(State of Michigan, Act 222, July 30, 1976).\nThe objectives, criteria, techniques, imagery and expected products\nare listed in Table 3.\n\n-46-\n\nCO\n\nH\nO\nf"~l\n\nO\n0\n\npi\np-l\n\nM-I\no\n>-\n\nCO\nrH\n\ncu\n\no\nw\n\no\n\nu\n\no\n\nC\n\n>>\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H Q) J2\nCO 4J G\n\nV-4\n\nH\n\nw\n\nPH\nP^\nw\n\n> S Q) O\n1-1 CO\n\n1 <J\no a> co\n\nrH\nO\n\n14-1\n\na. o p.\n\xc2\xa3\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2> M\n\nnj\n\na. cu a. co\n\nCO CX X\n\ncfl\n\nM-l\nO\n\nOH\n\n0 \xe2\x80\xa2H c**^\nCO \\O\n\n>. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nrH\nO\n\nJ2 rH\n\npq\n\n>\nO\n\nj5\nt-i\n\no\n\nU\n\nW\nH\n\ncfl CJ\n\n3\nCO\n\ncfl\nPQ t-i\nQ) Q) <C f=4\nCJOiH i-l\n\nM\n\nu\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o !3\nB\n\nco pa\ncu cu\n00 rH\n\na\n)-<\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nCX\n\ng\n\nO I\n\nG\n\ncu\nP.\n\nVJ\nO\n\n13 .C\n\nT3\n\n\xc2\xab\n>,\n\nrH\n\nCO -H -H\n\nO\nrG\nO\nCX M\nCO 4-1\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\n\na\n\nl-i CU\n\nW> E\nO O\n\n0) O\n\ncfl cfl O l-i I-l\nfj\nJ^ J^ ^^ O O\nP-i <fi H pn b>^| ^^\n\nC\nCO\nO -H\n\nCU O\n\n4-1 O O 4J\ncfl -H U CO\n\nK^\xc2\xbb\n\no co en i-i CO\nCO M -H CU fi\no M CO M-I\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4_l\nCO\n\nco o\n\ncfl O S <\n\nhJ to\n\nU 4J\n\xe2\x80\xa2H Q)\n\nC\n\nI U\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nT3 *&\nCU C\nS cfl\n\nW\n\nC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nci\n\ni\n\nfTj\n\n0 M\n\ncfl G\n\ncd\n\nM\n\nO,\n\nT3 (0\nT3 ps5 C 0)\n\nCO Pi\n\n"O\n\nw\no-\n\naC\n\nctJcfl\n\n|\n\n0)\n\niH\nCO\nM\nCO\n\nC\n\nH\n\n<U\nM-I H\nM h O\no cu\nT3\n\n2\xc2\xa7\nCOCO\n\ne\n3\n\nKH\njvj\nW\nO\n\ncu\nco\n\nT3\n>,\nQ)\nCO\nCO C\ni-H CO O -H\n\nW\n\nCO\n\nCU M\n\nO\n\nO QJ C\n4-1 E -H\n\xe2\x80\xa2H -H C\nWC\nC\n\nM\nCU\n<H\n4J\nCO\nCU /-s 3\n\nB -\xc2\xbbj to\n\nC\n\n<\n\nC cfl co B O- co\n\nO 00 P -H\nCO 3\nCO\nO> O T3 CO\n\nCU rH U O O -H\n\ncfl\n\na\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nM-I\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\nCfl\ncfl\nrH\nO\n\n0\nrH\nCO\n\nC\n\no\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa2>\n\nCO\n\no\n\nCU\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nC\ncfl\n\nH\nO\nW\n\nT3\n\nCO\n\ncu\na.\n\np-l\n\n4J\nCO cu\n4J f? <~) cfl B\ncO CJO 4J |J 3\nCJ \xe2\x80\xa2rH *O CU rH\n\n0\n\nCU jH\n\n>-,\n\n4-1\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n3\nC\n>H\nCfl 4J\nCU G\n\n> O M O\n\nC\n\n<U\nCO OJ l-i\n\nC <4-l\ncfl O\n\nM-I\n3\nH\n\no c M co ,a\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H O\n4-J -H\n\ncfl\n\n4->\n\nQ) vH\n60 O\n\nCO ^3\n\nC\n\nCO\n\n"4-1\n\nO <U CO 0)\nVJ > Cfl M\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H 60 O M 4-1\nrH Q) O.
