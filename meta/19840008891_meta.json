The apparatus includes a pair of curved extraction grids with multiple pairs of aligned holes positioned to direct a group of beamlets along converging paths. The extraction grids are closely spaced and maintained at a moderate potential to efficiently extract beamlets of ions and allow them to combine into a single beam. An accelerator electrode device downstream from the extraction grids is at a much lower potential than the grids to accelerate the combined beam. The application of the system to ion implantation is mentioned.", "title": "Ion beam accelerator system", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T15:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840008891, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aston, G."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "260348db3d9b4231bd4d1603b155ec3c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent Application", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19840008891, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840008891, "id": "887632f1c0f7469790dc18d364371d2d", "publicationDate": "1981-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840008891.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840008891/downloads/19840008891.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840008891/downloads/19840008891.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840008891/downloads/19840008891.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
