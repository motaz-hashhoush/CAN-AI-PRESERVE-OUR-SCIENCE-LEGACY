For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,597, which is\nincorporated herein in its entirety, describes an alternative\ndetector module configuration for such an abuttable detector\nmodule. In this patent, each detector module comprises a\nplurality of detection elements mounted to a circuit carrier, as\nshown in FIG. 1. The detection module comprises an integrated circuit mounted on a ceramic orplastic carrier 214. The\ncircuit carrier 214 houses the readout ICs and passive components, and provides interconnections from the ICs to the\ndetection elements 212 and to a module motherboard (not\nshown). The detection elements 212 are formed by an array of\nelectrodes on the lower surface of the CZT detector 210. The\nprior art detection module 206 shown in FIG. 1 is assembled\nwith thin plates positioned on both the top and bottom surfaces of the detector 210. The upper plate (not shown) provides a means for applying a bias voltage to the detection\nmodules 206, insulates the bias voltage from the detector\nhousing, and provides physical protection for the detector\nsubstrate. The upper plate is designed to allow the gamma\nrays emitted from the object 102 to penetrate the plate and to\nbe absorbed in the detection elements 212. A lower plate 230\nprovides the means for connecting the detector elements 212\nto the circuit carrier 214. The lower plate 230 includes a\nplurality of contact pads 232 that correspond in position to the\npositions of the detection elements 212. The plurality of contact pads 232 provide electrical connection for each detection\nelement to a corresponding input contact pad on the top\nsurface of the circuit carrier 214. The contact pads 232 are\nelectrically isolated from each other. In the prior art, conductive epoxy or indium bump bonds are used to bond the electrodes of these detection elements 212 to contact pads on the\nlower plate 230 and the contacts of the lower plate to input\ncontact pads of the circuit carrier 214. Thus, the detector\ninputs are connected to the readout ICs in the circuit carrier\n214 via the upper surface of the carrier 214 and the lower plate\n230. Other inputs and outputs are connected to the ICs via a\nplurality of pins 240 on the bottom surface of the circuit\ncarrier 214. The plurality of pins 240 are designed to mate\nwith insertion or socket connectors affixed to a motherboard.\nThe configuration of the detection module allows the module\n206 to be abutted on all four sides by other detectors on the\nmotherboard. Therefore, such a prior art detection module\n206 advantageously provides a modular element which can\nbe combined in a number of ways with other detection modules 206 to produce a large imager tiled array having a desired\nconfiguration.\nOne problem with prior art. approaches that use of indium\nbump bonding to bond the various elements electrically is that\nthe indium bump bonding process necessitates that the surfaces of the parts to be bonded be flat to very high tolerances.\nThis is expensive to achieve and difficult to accomplish\nrepeatedly in a production process. Also, if a conductive\nadhesive or indium bump bonding is used, a lower plate is\nrequired that is thick enough to mechanically isolate the semiconductor detector FIG. 1210 from the carrier 214. Without\nsuch a lower plate, the stresses induced in the assembly\'s\nbonds may be capable of breaking such bonds and causing\nelectrical failure of the element interconnects. Such stress can\nbe caused by thermal cycling due to temperature fluctuations\npresent under normal use, or due to mechanical shock, as\nwhen the assembly is dropped. However, the inclusion of a\nthick lower plate involves additional fabrication cost as well\nas increases the profile, or thickness, of the overall detector\nmodule. Low profile modules are desirable in many applications, e.g. modules employed in portable handheld gamma\nray detection electronics.\n\n4\n\n5\n\nTherefore there is a need to devise an improved method of\nbonding gamma ray array detectors, such as CZT and CdTe,\nto a readout device in such a way that it can withstand the\nstresses encountered in normal use. There is also a need to\ncreate lower cost abuttable detector modules having low profiles.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to x-ray or gamma ray detection\ndevices as well as x-ray or gamma ray imaging devices comprising a semiconductor detector substrate including a plurality of detector elements each of which is soldered to an\ninterposer card pad, wherein the solder joints are encapsu15 lated in a dielectric to increase their mechanical strength and\nprovide mechanical stability to the detector-interposer card\nsolder joints. The interposer card pads are in turn interconnected to the inputs of a readout device, such as a semiconductor readout device, that is mounted on the interposer card,\n20 the device including a corresponding plurality of readout\ncells. The interposer card further comprises one or more\nconnectors for interconnecting the device to power, ground\nand other signal processing electronics.\nThe instant invention describes an improved approach to\n25 configure semiconductor gamma ray detector modules\nemploying an interposer card rather than the conventional\ndirect bump hybridization used in the prior art of U.S. Pat. No.\n5,952,646 or the lower plate approach of U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,\n597. The novel scheme incorporates a unique combination of\n30 prior art flip-chip and multichip module technologies in combination with novel low-temperature flip-chip bonding materials and processes. This results in detector "tiles" containing\nintegrated readout devices and connectors in low-profile\nmodules that can be inserted into a motherboard, as illustrated\n35 in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. The benefit of the inventive configuration\nis that it is capable of withstanding the stress of normal use.\nThese modules employ new fabrication and packaging methods encompassing the following innovative elements:\n1. Solder bump flip-chip interconnections for assembly of\n40 the semiconductor detector to the interposer. The solder\nbumps are encapsulated in a solid resin that reduces the\nstresses on the solder joints, providing a practical assembly\nthat has superior reliability compared to the prior art. Such\nencapsulating resins, called underfills, are normally used to\n45 encapsulate solder bumps in prior art flip-chip assemblies that\nemploy conventional high-temperature solders. The novel\nfeature of the inventive encapsulation is that, unlike prior flip\nchip underfill resins, the encapsulant must be designed to cure\ncompletely at temperatures below 120 degrees C. in order to\n50 avoid damage to the heat-sensitive semiconductor detector.\nTypically such encapsulants are designed to be cured at 165\ndegrees C. or higher in order to achieve a high modulus and a\nlow expansion coefficient. Such requirements are not as\nimportant in CZT detector assemblies as they are in conven55 tional flip chips.\n2. By employing the inventive interposer and low-temperature encapsulated solder joint approach, it is possible to eliminate the lower plate of the prior art. This reduces the number\nof assembly operations as well as provides a low profile\n60 module.\nAn interposer is a high-density printed circuit that interconnects a detector array to one or more readout chips or\ndevices. It also interconnects the detector to a connector for\ninterconnecting the detector module\'s I/O, power and ground\n65 circuits to signal processing electronics and power sources on\na motherboard or backplane. The interposer eliminates the\nneed to interconnect silicon directly to the detector, allowing\n10\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nUS 7,531,809 B2\n\n\t\nthe detector modules to be abutted together on all sides. The\n\t\ninterposer provides a redistribution layer for the detector elements so that they can be interconnected to a semiconductor \t\nreadout array of any configuration. The readout chip is gen- \t\nerally designed to be smaller than the detector array, so the\n\t\ninterposer fans out the inputs from the readout chip to each\n\t\npixel element on the detector. The interposer has sufficient\n\t\narea available for attaching a connector. The readout chip may\n\t\nbe either solder bumped or wire bonded to the interposer.\n\n6\n\ndium, tin or some other solderable metal or alternately, an\norganic solderability promoter such as Entek Cu-106A available from Enthone.\nIn the instant invention, solder is used to bond the detector\n5 electrodes 312 to the input contact pads of the interposer 314.\nThe solder must comprise a low-temperature component that\nwets the contact pads at low temperature so that the assembly\nbonding can be carried out without heating the detector above\n120 degrees C. for any extended period of time. There are\nio several ways to achieve this. The three principal ones are:\n\t\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n1.
