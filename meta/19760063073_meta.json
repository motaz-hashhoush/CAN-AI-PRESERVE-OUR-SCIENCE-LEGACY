The STARPAHC telemedicine system accomplishes this by using physician's assistants complemented with space technology in communications, data handling, and systems engineering. It is presently in operation and undergoing a 2-year evaluation on the Papago Indian Reservation, Arizona. Results have established its feasibility as a solution for remote area health care on earth, while providing information useful to the planners of advanced manned spacecraft missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760063073, "endDate": "1976-10-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "eca0d0933bb34fa28a6138ea5c6773f7", "id": "453ff95b288149ca81cbdbc5a99c100d"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Anaheim, CA", "id": "eca0d0933bb34fa28a6138ea5c6773f7", "startDate": "1976-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760063073, "id": "8aab62ea5e7c4f4d8d94a7182f67d658", "publicationDate": "1976-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
