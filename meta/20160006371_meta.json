This framework is used for calibrating an agent based model of the air ticket buy-sell process - Airline Evolutionary Simulation (Airline EVOS) -that has fidelity of detail that accounts for airline and consumer behaviors and the interdependencies they share between themselves and the NAS. More specificially, this algorithm simultaneous calibrates demand and airfares for each O-D market, to within specified threshold of a pre-specified target value. The proposed algorithm is illustrated with market data targets provided by the Transportation System Analysis Model (TSAM) and Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B). Although we specify these models and datasources for this calibration exercise, the methods described in this paper are applicable to calibrating any low-level model of the ATS to some other demand forecast model-based data. We argue that using a calibration algorithm such as the one we present here to synchronize ATS models with specialized forecast demand models, is a powerful tool for establishing credible baseline conditions in experiments analyzing the effects of proposed policy changes to the ATS.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160006371, "endDate": "2015-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9974d36c121c430a84077dc6161fd4cc", "id": "232d08d91c444209aabdbbd249f2700a"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation 2015", "location": "Dallas, TX", "id": "9974d36c121c430a84077dc6161fd4cc", "startDate": "2015-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160006371, "id": "a4927cb6420f4aaba13df9091762c228", "publicationDate": "2015-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160006371.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160006371/downloads/20160006371.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160006371/downloads/20160006371.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160006371/downloads/20160006371.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
