Sisk and William H. Andrews\n\nSUMMARY\nDuring a flight investigation of the lateral stability characteristics of a high- speed delta- wing airplane) violent cross-coupled\nlateral and longitudinal motions were encountered . The maneuver which\nproduced these motions was an abrupt) rudder - fixed aileron roll performed at a Mach number of 0 . 75 at about 40)000 feet. The motions were\ncharacterized by extreme variations in angle of attack and angle of\nsideslip which caused the airplane to exceed the normal and transverse\nacceleration limitations .\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring flight testing of both the X- 3 straight- wing research airplane and a swept - wing fighter - type airplane) a number of aileron rolls\nwere performed which resulted in extremely violent inadvertent lateral\nand longitudinal motions. In all cases the motions were characterized\nby the attainment of large angles of\' sideslip and attack with resulting\nhigh load factors . These data are presented in reference 1. Reference 2\npoints out that this difficulty might be encountered with airplanes\nexperiencing high rates of roll and some analysis of this general problem of roll coupling is presented in references 3 and 4.\nThis paper presents data for a delta- wing airplane in which the\nsame difficulty was encountered during abrupt) rudder-fixed aileron\nrolls as was encountered with the airplanes of reference 1 . In order\nto expedite reporting) since it is felt that other current airplanes\nmight be expected to encounter similar behavior) the data are presented\nwith little attempt at analysis .\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n2\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nSYMBOLS\nnormal acceleration at center of gravity, g units\ntransverse acceleration at center of gravity, g units\nb\n\nspan, ft\nlift coefficient,\n\nrolling- moment coefficient,\n\nRolling moment\n1: pV2 Sb\n2\n\nPitching moment\n\npitching- moment coefficient,\n\n1\n- p V2 Sc\n2\n\nyawing- moment coefficient,\n\nYawing moment\n~ pV2 Sb\n2\n\nCy\n\nlateral- force coefficient,\n\nLateral force\n~ pV 2S\n2\n\nairplane normal-force coefficient,\n\nc\n\nmean aerodynamic chord, ft\naileron stick force, lb\nelevator stick force, lb\nrudder pedal force, lb\n\ng\n\nacceleration due to gravity, ftjsec 2\npressure altitude, ft\nmoment of inertia about longitudinal body axiS, slug- ft 2\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nJ\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nIXZ\n\nproduct of inertia, slug- ft 2\n\nIy\n\nmoment of inertia about lateral body axis, slug-ft 2\n\nIZ\n\nmoment of inertia about normal body axis, slug- ft 2\n\nM\n\nMach number\n\np\n\nrolling angular velocity, radians/sec\n\nq\n\npitching angular velocity, radians/sec\n\nq\n\npitching angular acceleration, radians/sec 2\n\nr\n\nyawing angular velocity, radians/sec\n\n.\n\nr\n\nyawing angular acceleration, radians/sec 2\n\ns\n\nwing area, sq ft\n\nt\n\ntime, sec\n\nv\n\nvelocity, ft/sec\n\nw\n\nairplane weight, lb\nindicated angle of attack, deg or radians\ndo,\n\ndt\'\n\nradians/sec\n\nindicated angle of sideslip, deg\n\nj3\n\naileron control angle,\n\nelevator control angle,\nDeL\n\nleft control surface deflection, deg\n\nDeR\n\nright control surface deflection, deg\n\nD\n\nlongitudinal stick position, in.\n\nZ\n\nDp\n\nrudder pedal position, in.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nrudder control angle, deg\ntransverse stick position, in.\nE\n\ninclination of pri ncipal axis, positive when below body axis\nat nose, deg\n\np\n\ndensity, slugs/cu ft\nbank angle, deg\n\nClo-.\nCl,\n\n_ dCl,\nP - d pb\n\n2V\n\nCl,\n\ndCl,\nrb\nd2V\n\nr\n\ndCl,\nCl,f3\n\ndf3\ndCl,\ndO a\n\nCl,\n\n\xc2\xb0a\nCUlq\n\n=\n\ndC m\n\n-\n\nd Qc\n2V\ndC m\n\nCIlla,\n\ndo,\n\ndC m\n\nCmu\n\ndcx,c\n2V\ndC m\n\n= -\n\nCrno e\n\nC~\n\n-\n\ndOe\n=\n\ndC n\npb\nd\n2V\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM\n\nH55H03\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n5\n\ndCn\nrb\nd\n2V\n\ndCn\ndf3\n== dCn\nC\nUOa\ndO a\n\nCYf3\n\ndCy\ndf3\n\nA:ffiPLANE AND INSTRUMENTATION\n\nThe mass and geometric characteristics of the airplane are presented in table I. A three- view drawing is shown as figure 1 and photographs are shown in figure 2 .\nThe airplane was instrumented to record those quantities pertinent\nto the stability and control investigation . The Mach numbers presented\nare corrected by the airspeed calibration obtained in level flight and\nfor this condition are estimated to be within \xc2\xb1O .Ol in Mach number. No\ncorrections have been applied to the static pressure for the \'large sideslip angles encountered . The angle of attack has been corrected for\nboom bending and for errors produced by pitching velocity. No attempt\nhas been made to correct for vane floating or upwash errors. Corre ctions\nto the sideslip angle for errors caused by rolling and yawing velocities\nare small and, therefore, have been neglected .\nACCURACY\n\nThe instrument accuracies are est i mated to be:\np, radians/sec\nq, r a dians/sec\nT, radians/sec\nCL, deg\nf3, deg\nan\' g units\nat, g units\nCa, deg . .\n\nto.010\nto.005\nto.005\nto.250\nto.250\n\xc2\xb1O.050\nto.025\n\xc2\xb1O.20\n\nThe weight was obtained from the pilot \' s reading of the fuel quantity\ngage at each maneuver and is believed accurate to \xc2\xb1lOO pounds.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n6\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nTESTS, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe aileron maneuvers presented in this paper were performed during\na handling-qualities investigation and consisted of one - quarter and one half deflection abrupt, rudder- fixed aileron rolls performed at Mach\nnumbers between 0 . 70 and 0.80 at an altitude of approxi mately 40,000 feet .\nThe center of gravity for these tests varied between 28 . 6 and 29 .0 percent\nmean aerodynamic chord.\nBecause the experiences of reference 1 indicated that handling difficulties might be encountered during aileron roll maneuvers at high\nrolling velocit i es, the investigation proceeded with cauti on . A high\ntest altitude, 40,000 feet, was selected to minimize the loads problem\n(ref . 3) . First, one - quarter deflect i on and then one - hal f deflecti on\nshort duration rolls were performed, generally from a wings - level atti tude . Sideslip motions of considerable amplitude were obtained at both\ndeflections as shown in the representative time histories of figure 3.\nThe time histories of figure 3 show the rolls, left and r ight, at\nMach numbers of 0 . 70 and 0 . 80 . It may be noted from an inspection of\nthese maneuvers that although large changes in angle of s i desl i p and\nangle of attack occurred, the maneuvers were controllable . The sideslip\ndeveloped (init i ally adverse) during these maneuvers was on the order\nof 10 0 , while the angle of attack decr eased appr oximately 20 . However,\nthe largest change i n angle of attack was on the order of a 6 0 increase .\nThe peak rolling velocity varied from 1 . 35 to 1 . 80 radians per second\nduring the maneuvers and the bank angles attained were approxi mately 200 0 .\nFigure 4 presents a time history of an aileron roll, performed at\na Mach number of 0 . 75, in which the airplane became uncontrollable. The\naltitude and center- of- gravity position were approximately the same as\nfor the other rolls presented . The initial bank angle was approximately\n20 0 right. An inspect i on of the time history reveals that the behavior\nis initially very similar to the other maneuvers, particularly those at\nM = 0 . 80, with adverse s i deslip developing when the roll started . Recovery from the maneuver was initiated at 7 . 3 seconds . At this time the\nangle of sideslip increased very rapidly from 12 0 to 30 0 and the angle of\nattack decreased to 13 0 down where it exceeded the i nstrument range. The\nroll velocity had attained a value of 2 .0 radians per second and began\nto decrease at the initiation of recovery ; however, as the angle of\nattack became more negative and sideslip increased, the roll velocity\nalso increased to approx i mately 4 .0 radians per second . As a result of\nthe increased roll velocity, the. angle of bank cont inued to increase\nfrom 360 0 to 500 0 . The normal acceleration trace exceeded the instrument range at - 2 . 6g, but the g- indicator in the cockpit reached its\nstop at - 5 .0g . During this maneuver the recorded maximum transverse\nacceleration was 1 . 3g at which point the acceleration exceeded the limit\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n7\n\nof the instrument. This load factor considerably exceeded the placard\nof 0.95g. The maneuver continued beyond the 10 seconds time shown on\nthe time history, but because of a shift of the electrical power to the\nemergency system, the instrument power was automatically cut off.\nThe pilot (who had also performed aileron rolls in the airplanes of\nref. 1) objected to the roll maneuvers in the delta- wing airplane as\nbeing exceedingly uncomfortable. He described the rolls as feeling\nmuch like the maneuvers of the swept - wing fighter of reference 1. He\nfelt the momentary hesitation in the development of sideslip which had\nbeen encountered in previous controllable manuevers and therefore p ermitted the roll to continue . Shortly thereafter the pronounced divergence in sideslip began and recovery attempts were initiated. Inspection of figure 4 substantiates the pilot\'s impressions in that at about\ntime 6 .25 seconds the angle of sideslip begins to stabilize, leading\nhim to believe that maximum sideslip had been reached.\nAt the time the maneuver of figure 4 was encountered, a 5-degreeof-freedom analytical study of the characteristics of the airplane in\nrolling maneuvers was being initiated using a Goodyear Electronic\nDifferential Analyzer. These general studies were to be used as a\nguide in extending the flight program to more critical conditions. Some\npreliminary work has been done on the GEDA in an attempt to match the\nflight records of figure 4. A typical comparison of the flight and\ncomputed results is shown in figure 5 . (A summary of the derivatives\nused is presented as table II . ) Although the degree of fit is quite\npoor) the basic divergent tendencies were manifested in the calculations.\nThe poor simulation is, perhaps, not too surprising in view of the\nabsence of lateral stability information for the cambered-reflexed wing\nconfiguration, which necessitated the use of uncambered wing-configuration\nderivatives.\nFurther calculations are being made (using, wherever pOSSible,\nstability derivatives obtained from flight data) to determine the extent\nto which the divergent tendencies of the subject airplane in rolling\nmaneuvers can be alleviated through rational design modification. It\nwould appear from a preliminary study that an increase in directional\nstability would be ben~ficial .\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nViolent cross-coupled lateral and longitudinal motions of a deltawing fighter-type airplane were encountered during an abrupt, rudderfixed aileron roll at a Mach number of 0 . 75.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\n8\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNACA RM H55H03\n\nThese motions produced large variations in angle of attack and angle\nof sideslip which resulted in load factors as large as 5g (negative)\nnormal acceleration and 1 . 3g transverse acceleration .\nA preliminary 5 - degree- of- freedom analog study of this maneuver\nindicated that basic divergent tendencies might be expected .\nHigh- Speed Flight Station,\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,\nEdwards, Calif . , J uly 26, 1955 .\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
