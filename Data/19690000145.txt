b'\t\n\nMay 1969\t\n\nBrief 69-10145\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nNASA Tech Briefs are issued to summarize specific innovations derived from the U.S. space program,\nto encourage their commercial application. Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information, Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nMixing Weld Gases Offers Advantages\n20% Argon\n80% Helium\n\n10% Argon\t\n90% Helium\t\n\n100% Helium\t\n\n5%Argon\t\n95% Helium\t\n\n15% Argon\t\n85% Helium\t\n\n25%Argon\n75% Helium\n\nCross Section of Cover Pass Welds\n(Bead-on-Plate Method) Made With\nVarious Percentage Mixtures of Argon\nto Helium. Note Undercut with 20 and\n25 Percent Argon Additions.\n\nThe addition of the inert gas argon to helium\nduring gas tungsten arc (GTA) cover-pass welding\nin the horizontal position results in a number of\nadvantages over employing 100 percent helium shielding gas. Among the advantages is a better controlled\nwider bead width, increased arc stability and reduction in heat input. Also, adequate filler material wetting and penetration pass coverage is possible with\nonly one cover pass. These improvements will be useful to the welding trade for precision applications,\nparticularly where a joint must also be a seal rather\nthan just a structure.\nTesting consisted of x-ray and penetrant inspections\nmade on two series of six 2014-T6 aluminum alloy\npanels, observation of bead width-to-penetration depth\nratio, and collection of room temperature mechanical\nproperty data.\n\nNote:\n\nFurther documentation is available from:\nClearinghouse for Federal Scientific\nand Technical Information\nSpringfield, Virginia 22151\nPrice $3.00\nReference: TSP69-10145\nPatent status:\n\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to NASA, Code\nGP, Washington, D.C. 20546.\nSource: M.
