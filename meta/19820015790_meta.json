This reduces the packing efficiency, which approaches 95% for square cells, to about 78% and reduces the conversion efficiency of the module by the same ratio. Shaping these ingots into squares with regrowth of cut silicon improves the packing factor, but increases growth cost. The cost impact on solar cell modules was determined by considering shaping ingots in stages from full round to complete square. The sequence of module production with relevant price allocation guidelines is outlined. The severe penalties in add-on price due to increasing slice thickness and kerf are presented. Trade-offs between advantages of recycling silicon and shaping costs are developed for different slicing scenarios. It is shown that shaping results in cost saving of up to 21% for a 15 cm dia. ingot.", "title": "Some tradeoffs in ingot shaping and price of solar photovoltaic modules", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820015790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Daud, T."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "3b9591081f674cb2b6c4c1d1e8eee6eb"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19820015790, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820015790, "id": "9d773e95277f44609e3e10f9d17e4bec", "publicationName": "Proc. of the Low-Cost Solar Array Wafering Workshop", "publicationDate": "1982-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19820015774, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Low-Cost Solar Array Wafering Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820015790.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820015790/downloads/19820015790.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820015790/downloads/19820015790.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820015790/downloads/19820015790.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
