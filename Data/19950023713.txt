b'BENCHMARK PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS\nChristopher K.W. Tam\n\nThe Scientific Committee, after careful consideration, adopted six categories of benchmark\nl\nproblems for the workshop. These problems do not cover all the important c o ~ p u t a t i o n aissues\nrelevant to Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA). The deciding factor to limit ihr niimber of categories to six was the amount of effort needed to solve these problems. For reference purpose, the\nbenchmark problems are provided below. They are followed by the exact or approximate analytical solutions. At present, an exact solution for the Category 6 problem is not available.\n\nBENCHMARK PROBLEMS\n\nCategory 1\nProblems to test the numerical dispersion and dissipation properties of a computation\nscheme (linear waves).\nUse nondimensional variables with the following scales\n\nAx = A r\na,\n\n= length scale\n\n(ambient sound speed) = velocity scale\n\nAx\n- = time scale\nam\n\np, = density scale\n2\npooa, = pressure scale\n\n1.

An approximate solution can be found by using the simple wave assumptions (Chapter 6, G.B. Whitham, "Linear and nonlinear waves"). These assumptions are\n1. The flow is isentropic\n2. The Riemann invariant\n- u = A \' which starts from the uniform region ahead of the\n7-1\npulse, is valid everywhere.\nWith these assumptions, the Euler equations reduces to the nonlinear simple wave equation\n\n%\n\nThis quasi-linear first-order equation can be solved by the method of characteristics. For the\ngiven initial conditions, a shock will form at the front of the pulse as the disturbance propagates\nto the right. The location of the shock may be found approximately by the use of Whitham\'s\nequal area rule.\nProblem 2. The standard shock tube solution is a good approximate solution.

These\nequations are ordinary differential equations but with variable coefficients. They can be integrated numerically.\nLet the solution be separated into a mean and a time-periodic part in the form\n\nThe physical quantities of the mean flow at the nozzle throat will be denoted by a subscript\nWith the area ratio A./Al known, where\nsolving the equation\n\nA1 is the area.of the\n\nuniform duct, p, is first found by\n\nThe other variables at the nozzle throat are given by\n\nThe mean flow solution is\n\n-2\n\nU\n7\n- + -- P*,-l--+--\n\n2\n\ny - l p *- f p\n\n-\n\n4\n2\n\nY\n\n*.\n\nP*\n\ny-lp*\nA\n\n*\n\nThe linearized governing equations for the amplitude functions p, u and p^ are\n\nIn the uniform region of the duct, the solution of (1) that matches the incoming acoustic\nwave is\n\nIn (2), the second term represents the reflected acoustic wave. The unknown amplitude c is to be\ndetermined later.\nEquations (1) have a regular singular point at the nozzle throat (x = 0). Near the throat,\nthere are two non-singular series solutions. The first two terms of these solutions are\n\nwhere uo and po are arbitrary constants. p l , u l and pl are functions of uo and po.\nA numerical solution of (1) can be constructed by starting the solution slightly upstream of\nthe nozzle throat at x = -6 ( << 1) using (3) as the starting solution. (For small 5, the terms\n6\nof the series involving S and powers of 6 may be neglected.) The numerical integration proceeds\nupstream until the uniform duct region is reached. At this point, the numerical solution must\nmatch solution (2). This provides three algebraic equations for the three unknowns po, uo and c.\nOnce these constants are found, the solution upstream of the nozzle throat is known.\nFor the solution downstream of the nozzle throat one can start integrating (1) numerically at\na point just downstream, say at x = 6. Again (3) is used as the starting solution. The numerical\nintegration proceeds downstream until the nozzle exit is reached. With po, uo already found, the\namplitude functions are now completely determined along the entire length of the nozzle.\n\nChristopher K.W.
