Patent\n\nSep. 12,1989\n\n4,864,847\n\n1\n\n4,864,847\n\nFLUID LEAK INDICATOR\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\n5\nThe invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Section 305 of the National\nAeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-568\n(72 Stat. 435; 42 U.S.C. 2457).\n10\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to leak detection, and\nmore particularly to a passive fluid leak detector and\nindicator which is particularly suited for detecting leaks 15\nin hidden, visually obstructed locations.\nMany hydraulic systems have several joints and/or\nfittings which are not readily visible, and are thus difficult to inspect during normal maintenance. Sometimes\nminor leakage at such joints is not a problem, so routine 20\ninspections are not necessary. With other equipment,\nsuch as aerospace systems like the Space Shuttle, leakage can be even more critical than on conventional\naircraft or ground hydraulic systems. Maintenance and\nturn-around inspection times in such specialized craft 25\nare therefore impacted by the necessity to verify the\nhydraulic system integrity. In such cases, hidden joints\nand fittings can considerably increase this inspection\ntime.\nMany so-called \xe2\x80\x9chidden\xe2\x80\x9d joints, while not directly 30\naccessible visually, can still be easily inspected, for example with inspection mirrors. However, when portions of the hydraulic system are insulated, as in spacecraft such as the Shuttle, such indirect observation is\nprecluded and leak detection becomes a difficult, time 35\nconsuming, and critical problem. (The Shuttle has over\n2,000 joints which must be inspected at the conclusion\nof each flight.)\nThe prior art, of course, includes various known\nmeans for remote detection of leaks. Much of this tech- 40\nnology, however, is elaborate and heavy, and not\nreadily adaptable to use with aerospace systems. There\nare a number of relatively simple leakage detectors\nknown, but these primarily reveal or provide a telltale 45\nat the location of the leak, and are not adequate to provide a remote indication in the environment just described. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,601,840 (M. F.\nSmith et al., issued July 1, 1952) and 2,708,896 (M. F.\nSmith et al., issued May 24, 1955) disclose protective 50\ncovers for pipe flanges and valves. The covers, which\nare intended to contain possibly harmful leakage materials, have indicating chemicals to reveal such a leak. In\nseveral embodiments a wick may be used to conduct the\nfluid to an indicator outside the cover by means of 55\ncapillary action. Remote indication as discussed above,\nhowever, is not addressed.\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,485,085 (W. M. Hawkins, Jr., issued\nDec. 23, 1969) discloses a leak detector around a joint,\nwherein moisture which leaks condenses and then trav- 60\nels by capillary action to a leak detecting tape. The\ncolor and resistivity of the tape then change to reveal\nthe detected leak. The leak detecting tape is displaced a\nshort distance from the joint not due to visual inaccessibility, but to provide room for intervening insulation to 65\nkeep the leak detecting tape cooler than the joint.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 2,918,033 (Snyder, issued Dec. 22,\n1959) and 2,918,893 (Norton, issued Dec. 29, 1959) pro-\n\n2\n\nvide in situ detection of leakage at joints which are\napparently already visibly accessible.\nU.S. Pat. No. 2,460,215 (K. J. Chase, issued Jan. 25,\n1949) discloses a telltale for frozen food packages. A\nwater capsule breaks upon freezing, and subsequent\nmelting causes a wick to convey the water to a visual\ncolor changing indicator at the surface of the package\nbeing monitored. The device is thus not directed to\nremote leakage detection. Also, it depends upon a\nchemical which changes color when wetted by the\nmoisture which is being detected.\nAs may be seen, therefore, a need still remains for an\nimproved, inexpensive, uncomplicated, and light\nweight fluid leak indicator for detecting fluid leaks in\nhidden, visually inaccessible locations. Such an indicator should be easy to install, should preferably be able to\nprovide an indication at a point distant from the leak,\nand should also be able to readily indicate the presence\nof leaks without requiring a chemical change in the\nindicator. Ideally, such an indicator should also be resistant to \xe2\x80\x9cfalse alarms\xe2\x80\x9d which might occur from exposure\nto fluid at locations other than that being monitored.\nFurther, such an indicator should, in the preferred embodiment, be physically self-sustaining, as may be required, such that it can retain its own shape in whatever\nconfiguration may be desired.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nBriefly, the present invention meets the above needs\nand purposes with an improved fluid leak indicator and\nmethod for detecting fluid leaks in hidden, visually\ninaccessible locations. In a preferred embodiment of the\ninvention, the fluid leak indicator includes a length of\nbraided \xe2\x80\x9cKEVLAR\xe2\x80\x99 wicking material having a portion\nat a visually inaccessible first location of potential fluid\nleakage. This location is preferably enclosed in a semisealed bag which helps direct any such fluid leakage to\nthe wicking material. The braided wicking material\nthen extends from the visually inaccessible first location\nto a visually accessible second location which is distant\nfrom the first location. In this manner the wicking material, by means of capillary action, conducts leakage fluid\nwhich may be present at the first location to the second\nlocation, where it can be collected as needed.\nA capturing transparent indicator bulb is positioned\nin contact with the wicking material at the visually\naccessible second location. The bulb thereby collects\nleakage fluid conducted thereto by the wicking material, to visually indicate the presence therein of the\nleakage fluid. The capturing transparent indicator bulb\nprovides this indication without requiring a chemical\nchange, by including therein, in the preferred embodiment, fibrous insulation which readily reveals the presence of leakage fluid without requiring a chemical\nchange.\nTo help the fluid leak indicator retain whatever configuration may be desired, and to make it resistant to\nexposure to fluids at locations other than that being\nmonitored, the corresponding portion(s) of the indicator includes an impervious transparent coating of heat\nshrink tubing applied to the exterior thereof. Having\nbeen shaped under heat, it then retains that shape while\ncool. Also, the capturing indicator bulb includes such\nheat shrink tubing surrounding the fibrous insulation,\nthis tubing being partially closed at each end thereof.\nIn operation, the detector is first fabricated and\nshaped as desired. Then the end thereof opposite the\ncapturing indicator bulb is placed within the semi-\n\n3\n\n4,864,847\n\nsealed bag in contact with the visually inaccessible region of potential fluid leakage. The capturing indicator\nbulb is then located in the second, visually accessible\nlocation, so that the wicking material can then conduct\nleakage fluid from the former to the latter for collection\nin the capturing indicator bulb. The presence of such\nfluid in the capturing transparent indicator bulb provides a visual indication, without requiring chemical\nchange in the indicator, which reveals a leak at the\nvisibly inaccessible location.\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to\nprovide an improved fluid leak indicator and method\nfor detecting fluid leaks in hidden, visually inaccessible\nlocations; such an indicator and method in which a\nwicking material extends from a visually inaccessible\nfirst location of potential fluid leakage to a visually\naccessible second location distant from the first location, for conducting leakage fluid from the first location\nto the second location; which includes an indicator\nmeans on the wicking material at the visually accessible\nsecond location; in which the indicator means collects\nleakage fluid conducted thereto by the wicking material\nfor visually indicating the presence of the leakage fluid\nat the indicator; in which the indicator provides such a\nvisual indication without requiring a chemical change in\nthe indicator; and to accomplish the above objects and\npurposes in an inexpensive, uncomplicated, durable,\nversatile, light weight, economical, and reliable method\nand apparatus which are easy to install and readily\nsuited to the widest possible utilization in the detection\nand indication of fluid leaks in hidden, visually inaccessible, and often remote locations.\nThese and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the\naccompanying drawings, and the appended claims.\n\n5\n\n4\n\nbag 25, located between the fittings and the insulation\n24. As illustrated, the insulation consists of an inner\nlayer 26 of fibrous insulation and an outer layer 27 of\nmetal foil (folded and secured with staples 28 at the\ntop). Clearly, due to the insulation 24, fittings 20 and 21\nare not visually accessible for inspection for leakage. To\nverify their integrity it has therefore ordinarily been\nnecessary to remove the insulation, inspect the fittings,\nand then apply a new insulative covering an expensive\nand time consuming process.\nThe present invention provides a visual detection\nsystem or fluid leak indicator 30 (FIG. 2) which provides for rapid inspection of joints or fittings such as\nfittings 20 and 21 without regard to visual obstructions\nsuch as the insulation 24. In the preferred embodiment,\nthis consists of a wicking material 34 which surrounds\nthe visually inaccessible joint areas 20 and 21 of the\nhydraulic system 10 and directs any leakage fluids, by\ncapillary action, to a remotely located and visually\naccessible capturing indicator bulb 35. When the fluid\nwhich is to be detected is hydraulic fluid, such as the\nred hydraulic oil (MIL-H-83282) used on the Shuttle\nsystem, the wicking material 34 in the preferred embodiment is braided aramid fiber sleeving sold under the\nTrademark \xe2\x80\x9cKEVLAR 4Y\xe2\x80\x99 and having characteristics\nas described in Dupont Bulletin K-5 \xe2\x80\x9cKEVLAR Aramid\xe2\x80\x9d, dated September, 1981.\nAs may be seen in FIG. 1, the wicking material 34 is\nwrapped around the fittings 20 and 21 and secured in\ncontact therewith, for example, by adhesive tape 37.\nThe semi-sealedbag 25 (e.g., polyimide film conforming\nto MIL-P-46112) forms a bagging means which encloses the fittings 20 and 21 and helps to collect any\nfluid which leaks, to keep such leakage fluid off the\ninsulation 26, and to direct the fluid to the wicking\nmaterial 34. The wicking material then absorbs the\nhydraulic fluid and conducts it by capillary action, as\nindicated above, to the capturing indicator bulb 35 at\nthe opposite end of the wicking material 34. The bulb 35\nis located remotely from fittings 20 and 21, outside the\ninsulation 24, and therefore visually accessible for inspection for leakage from fitting 20 or 21.\nFIG. 2 shows the fluid leak indicator 30 in greater\ndetail. As may be seen therein, a portion of the wicking\nmaterial 34 has an outer impervious transparent heat\nshrink tubing 42 (e.g., MIL-1-7444) applied thereto.\nTubing 42 prevents the wicking material 34 from transferring leakage fluid to adjacent insulation 26 when\npassing from bag 25 to the outside as shown in FIG. 1,\nand from absorbing liquids at locations other than the\nleakage areas being monitored (Le., fittings 20 and 21).\nIn the preferred embodiment, tubing 42 also strengthens\nthe wicking material and keeps it in whatever predetermined configuration may be desired. To accomplish\nthis, the tubing 42 in the preferred embodiment is simply\ntransparent heat shrink tubing, to which the desired\nshape or configuration is imparted while under heat. It\nis then cooled in that shape so that it then retains that\nshape in use.\nThe capturing indicator bulb 35, as particularly\nshown in FIG. 2, is likewise composed on the outside of\ntransparent heat shrink tubing 42, partially closed at\neach end thereof. Within the transparent heat shrink\ntubing bulb portion 35 is fibrous insulation material 45 in\ncontact with the wicking material 34. Any suitable material that meets the requirements of the environment\nmay be used which visually changes upon being wetted\nwith the leakage material, preferably without requiring\n~\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n3\n0\n\n35\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is a somewhat figurative illustration, partially\nin section, showing a fluid leak indicator according to\nthe present invention installed on two visually inaccessi- 40\nble hydraulic fittings which are surrounded with insulation;\nFIG. 1A illustrates the visible change in appearance\nof the indicator bulb shown in FIGS. 1 and 2;\nFIG. 2 is a plan view, partially in section, of the fluid 45\n;\nleak indicator shown in FIG. 1 and\nFIG. 3 is a plan view, flat pattern, of the polyamide\nfilm bag which encloses the visually obstructed hydraulic fittings shown in FIG. 1.\n50\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\nWith reference to the drawings, the new and improved fluid leak indicator for detecting fluid leaks in\nhidden, visually inaccessible locations, and the method 55\ntherefor according to the present invention, will be\ndescribed.

To help protect line 10 from the\nhostile environment conditions in region 15, the portions of line 10 in region 15 are accordingly surrounded 65\nwith thermal insulation 24. For reasons further explained below, portions of fittings 20 and 21 in region 15\nare also surrounded with a semi-sealed polyimide film\n\n4,8( 54,841\n\n6\n\n(c) impervious coating on the outside of at least a\na chemical change for the visual indication. Such a\nportion of said wicking means exterior to the fluid\nvisual change is depicted in FIG. lA, where the white\ncapturing means, and\ninsulation 45 is visibly darker due to being wetted by the\n(d) indicator means on said wicking means at said\nleakage liquid. When the liquid being detected is the\nvisually accessible second location for collecting\nhydraulic oil described above, a suitable fiber 45, for 5\nleakage fluid conducted thereto by said wicking\nexample, is fibrous insulation such as that which meets\nmeans for visually indicating the presence of the\nRockwell International Corporation Spec.
