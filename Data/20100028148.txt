As we continue to publish\nNTB, we will try to bring them to\nyour attention .\nOur series on NASA\'s field research\ncenters continues in this issue with Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,\nMaryland. Goddard has a very active program in secondary technology applications. Its Office of Commercial Programs,\nunder the direction of Don Friedman ,\ncoordinates technology transfer and\nutilization for a number of applications\nprojects, a few of which are mentioned on\npage 12.\nGoddard is also participating in the\nfederal government\'s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program . The\nSBIR program \'s operative assumption is\nthat the small business/entrepreneurial\ncompany has the best chance of taking\na fresh technical idea and rapidly bringing it to the marketplace. Dr. Noel Hinners, center director, sums up Goddard\'s\ninvolvement with the SBIR program this\nway: " One of the things we want to be\nsure we do at Goddard is to make the\n\nDon Frledm.n, left, clllef of Oodd.rd\'.

In terms of its ability\nto involve small business, the SBIR program is quite impressive. Based on announced \'Areas of Research Interest,\'\nGoddard may sponsor about a dozen or\nso phase I proposals, with funding in the\nrange of $25,000 to $50,000. Phase II funding may be available for up to around\n$500,000 if a project is particularly promising. Goddard has been involved in\nSBIR for two years, and has about 25 pro-\n\njects in progress."\nOverall , NASA\'s 1985 SBIR program\nincludes 150 research projects, which\nwere selected from a field of 1164 proposals. NASA\'s fiscal \'85 budget includes\napproximately $7.5 million for phase I of\nthe SBIR projects. The program is administered by NASA\'s Office of Commercial Programs.

A welldeveloped technology transfer program can substantially augment a\ncorporation\'s R&D effort, thus\nstretching its R&D investment\ndollar by a considerable margin.\nSimply stated, technology\ntransfer is the process of utilizing a\ntechnology for a purpose other than\nthat for which it was developed .\nWhile technology transfer focuses\non the application of previous\nresearch, there is no clear distinction\nbetween it and R&D-just as there\nis no clear separation between basic\nand applied research. Industrial\ntechnical development actually involves aspects of each .\nWhat is the value of a technology\ntransfer program? There are several\nbenefits:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can reduce the cost of a company \'s R&D effort.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can help increase company\nproductivity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It provides a broader set of\ntechnological alternatives, and\nincreases the probability of\nselecting the best technology\nfor a given task.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can effectively accelerate the\napplication of a technology in\nnew fields of use.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can provide a broader\ntechnological base for company\ndiversification.\n\nThese benefits are usually\nsufficient reasons for companies to\nestablish an internal technology\ntransfer program . To be effective,\n14\n\nhowever, such a program needs to\ninvolve a good deal more than a few\ndays\' research in the company library\nto learn about a particular technology or process. A well-developed\ntransfer program, while not inexpensive, can substantially increase the\npayback potential of the R&D effort\nin large and small companies alike.\nHow can my firm organize for\ntechnology transfer? One approach\n\n"A well-developed\ntechnology transfer\nprogram can\nsubstantially\nincrease the\npayback potential of\nthe R&D effort."\nis the establishment of a company\ntechnology transfer team which\nwould serve as a focal pOint for new\ntechnologies and new business\nopportunities. The team should be\nhighly sensitive to the company\'s\ntechnological problems and needs,\nand acquainted with outside technical information resources. Systematically searching or using such\nresources in a highly focused\nmanner should payoff. In making\nmatches, the team shou Id be concerned with these questions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the technology?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Has the technology been\ndemonstrated or reduced to\npractice?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are its unique\ncharacteristics?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can it be protected by a patent,\nor can my company be licensed\nto use the technology?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What would be the cost of\nfurther development or\ncommercial ization?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are the cost/performance\nand performance/benefit tradeoffs?\nIn addition, the team should seek\nout members of the company who\ncan be characterized as " technological gatekeepers." Such individuals tend to keep up with\ndevelopments in their chosen field\nand are usually very effective pOints\nof reference for others in the\norganization . They can be called\nupon to assist in evaluating the\npotential applicability of externally\ngenerated technologies to the\ncompany\'s needs.\nWhatever approach is taken in\ntechnology transfer, large organizations will find it a valuable adjunct\nto their R&D efforts, while smaller\ncompanies can use it as an alternative to R&D since access is easy\nonce channels of communication\nhave been established and large laboratory facilities are not usually\nneeded. The rewards from technology transfer can be great and\nshould be considered by all companies, both large and small, that\nare seeking methods of making\ntheir R&D more productive.

Goddard,\nprofessor of physics at Clark University\nin Worcester, Mass., wrote the following\ncomment in his experimental notebook:\n"The first flight with a rocket using\nliquid propellants was made yesterday at\nAunt Effie\'sfarm in Auburn. "Although\nGoddard wrote in a style which approaches\nthat of the press release, he had no\ndesire to publicize his historic accomplishment. With what has come to be\nregarded as classic New England reticence,\nGoddard carried out his pioneering\nrocket experiments in a manner verging\non secrecy. Exactly 35 years later,\nhowever, the "moon rocket man" and\nhis legacy of original research were\naccorded a highly public, if\nposthumous, tribute.\n\nG\n\noddard Space Flight Center was officially dedicated on March\n16, 1961 , " in commemoration of Dr. Robert H. Goddard,\nAmerican pioneer in rocket research." The center, located on\n550 acres in Greenbelt, Maryland , was the first to be established under\nthe aegis of NASA, which had been created by the National Aeronautics\nand Space Act of 1958.\nThe launch of the Soviet satellite SPUTNIK I a year earlier had ushered\nin a new era in human history-the space age. At the same time, it\nsparked what\'s commonly referred to as the "space race." For the U.S.,\nthis meant a stepped-up commitment to space exploration, which was\nmanifested by the creation of NASA.\nPrior to this, the development of launch vehicles and satellites for space\nexploration had been the province of the military services. Following\nWWII, American rocket research was given a boost by the example of\nthe German V-2, and by one of its developers, Dr. Wernher von Braun,\nwho joined researchers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) in\nHuntsville, Ala. This group would later develop and launch the first U.S.\nsatellite, EXPLORER I.\nThe Vanguard project, which called fdr the deSign, development and\nlaunch of a U.S. scientific satellite during the International Geophysical\nYear (July 1, 1957-December 31 , 1958) was assigned to the Naval\nResearch Laboratory. The Space Act, however, declared that "It is the\npolicy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to\npeaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind," and created a civilian\nagency to pursue these aims.\n\nThey Make Space Calls: Astronauts Dale A . Gardner (left) and Joseph P.\nAllen IV work together to retrieve the Westar VI communications satellite.\nThe satellite had been launched into an improper orbit, and was returned to\nearth by the shuttle Discovery for refurbishment and eventual reuse.\n\n19\n\nGoddard\nWith the advent of NASA, all military\nrocket and space-related programs not\nprimarily associated with defense were\ntransferred to the civilian agency . These\nincluded two Air Force lunar probe programs, three satellite and two more lunar\nprobe programs at ABMA, a variety of\nrocket engine projects, and the Naval\nResearch Laboratory\'s Project Vanguard .\nKey personnel from this last program\nwould later form the nucleus of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.\nOther programs inherited by Goddard\nincluded the Army Signal Corps\' meteorological program and the military\'s\nspace communications program . In\naddition, Goddard was charged with\nconducting an active space science program, which included the launching of\nsatellites. A global tracking, data acquisition and data reduction operation\nfor all of NASA\'s space missions was\nestablished at Goddard as well.\nThe development of these original\nGoddard programs-scientific,\nmeteorological and communications\nsatellites, and tracking, data acquisition\nand reduction-set the pace for the\nrapid growth and expansion which\noccurred at Goddard throughout the\n1960s.\nAlong with this expansion came a\nmyriad of scientific and technological\nsuccesses, many of them involving\n\nsatellites. Goddard engineers and\ntechnicians applied their expertise in all\nphases of satellite design and development, fabrication , integration, testing ,\nand launch services. Once a satellite\nhad been launched, Goddard personnel\nwould track the satellite, monitor communications, and reduce the data it\ntransmitted to Goddard\'s Space Operations Control Center. Satellites from the\nExplorer, Relay, Pioneer, Nimbus, Tiros,\nTelstar and Syncom families were\namong those managed by Goddard, and\nall of these contributed to laying a solid\nfoundation upon which the network of\nscientific, meteorological and communication satellites most of us take for\ngranted today could be built.\nThe wealth of data collected and\ntransmitted by Goddard-managed satellites helped the American scientific community take great strides toward a fuller\ncomprehension of the earth, its atmosphere, magnetic fields, radiation and\nother solar and cosmic phenomena. Yet,\nsince scientific experiments have a way\nof posing as many questions as they\nanswer, the data from early scientific\nmissions-the orbiting solar,\nastronomical and geophysical observatories, for example-pointed up the\nneed for further exploration. NASA\'s\ncommitment to the scientific exploration\nof space is well in evidence today at\n\nGoddard, where a number of scientific\nsatellites are being developed for launch\nduring the current decade.\n\nComing (and Going) Up\nThe Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) satellite will test the veracity of\nthe " big bang" theory of the origin of the\nuniverse\'. Scheduled for launch into a\npolar orbit in 1987, the 5-ton COBE will\nmeasure and map the diffuse microwave and infrared radiation that is\nthought to be leftover from the primeval\nexplosion-the big bang-and other formative events in the early universe.\nData from COBE will provide astronomers with maps of the entire sky at a\nvariety of microwave and infrared\nwavelengths. The maps are expected to\nfurnish answers to such questions as\nhow old is the universe? when did the\nfirst stars appear? is the universe expanding uniformly?\nGoddard is functioning as the prime\ncontractor for the COBE spacecraft. As\nsuch , Goddard scientists, engineers and\ntechnicians are designing, fabricating, integrating and testing the COSE spacecraft and its three instruments. Goddard\npersonnel will continue to manage\nCOBE after its launch from Vandenberg\nAir Force Sase in California. Goddard\'s\nall-around satellite capabilities are illustrated by the fact that, once in orbit,\nCOBE\'s data will be transmitted to Goddard\'s data system facility through the\nGoddard-managed Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite System (TDRSS). Finally,\nthe processed data will be stored at the\nNational Space Science Data Center at\nGoddard, where it will be available both\nas printouts and maps to cosmologists\nand to the public.\n\nOn the House\nIt is Goddard policy to have at least\none in-house design and engineering\nproject at all times. This way, the center\nassures that its technicians and\nengineers are conversant with the latest\ndevelopments in technology.

In the process, they uncovered the vast resources of\ntwo continents. And they opened up a new base for exploration, progress, and the\nhopes of mankind.\nIn 1992. coincident with the SOOth anniversary of Columbus\'s voyage, we plan to\nset sail for another New World. That year, or\nshortly thereafter, the United States and the world\nwill begin benefiting from the first manned Space\nStation. The Station will be more than another\ngiant step for mankind. It will be our stepping\nstone to living in new realms, and it will result\nin thousands of discoveries that will benefit earth.\nThis New World, free from gravity and atmospheric impurity, will provide that ideal environ~\nment for experimentation and production that\nis impossible on earth. Simultaneously we will\n_ have a permanent station for scanning the earth\nand the heavens - an unparalleled vantage point\nfor predicting weather, aiding agriculture, and\n,_____ .:::....:.-.-.____~_.... understanding the universe.\nOf course, like Columbus, we cannot foresee all the benefits ahead. But we do\nknow that we will have a new arena in which to conquer disease, transform the\nmaterials of earth, and generate precious energy. The resulting knowledge from\ncountless discoveries will come down to earth for our well~being.\nBut, unlike Columbus, our craft will be in constant contact with the Old World.\nHarris Aerospace, as a member of the Rockwell, Grununan and Sperry team, is re~\nsponsible for the Space Station\'s communications and tracking system. We are\ntotally committed to this great endeavor, and we bring to the challenge the capabili~\nties and experience necessary for success.\nHarris has had 27 years of successful involvement with the kind of space com~\nmunications and tracking required for the manned Space Station. Our space experi~\nence includes programs from Telstar to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite as well\nas the manned programs of Apollo, Lunar Module, and Space Shuttle. We are also a\nleader in the architecture and design of large communication networks.\nNow Harris is ready for the Space Station. Over the next years and centuries, the\nscope of scientific, commercial and technological opportunities and breadth of results\nare sure to exceed our wildest expectations.\nFor in 1992, we, too, will be very much like Columbus: carrying the sum of our\nknowledge into the unknown. And, like him, we, too, shall return with the bountiful\ngifts of a New World.\n\nHARRIS\n\nGoddard\ntions from a variety of perspectives , including design and development. Goddard\nmanagement believes it\'s essential for\npeople who will eventually become project\nmanagers to be knowledgeable in all\naspects of satellite production in order\nto make the most efficient use of the\ncenter\'s resources and available technology. At the same time, this policy ensures that center personnel will keep up\nwith steadily changing technology.\nGoddard is one of the four NASA\ncenters responsible for developing the\nfirst permanently orbiting Space Station\nin the early 1990s. Goddard\'s role\nfocuses on the development of\nautomated free-flying platforms, instruments and payloads which would be\nattached externally to the pressurized\nsection of the Space Station, and the\ndevelopment of pressurized modules to\nbe used for laboratory facilities.\nThe TDRSS will increase communications and data link coverage of orbiting\nsatellites through the use of satellites.\nOne satellite already is in operation, and\ntwo others are scheduled to be launched in 1986. The three-satellite system\nwill provide communications coverage\nfor approximately 85 percent of each\nsatellite\'s orbit. Prior to the development\nof the satellite relay system, which collects communications and data from an\norbiting sate II ite and relays them to\nEarth, a worldwide network of ground\nstations was used. With the ground stations, however, communications with a\n\nsatellite could be maintained over only\nabout 15 percent of each orbit.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope, also\ndue to be launched in 1986, is a groundsized observatory that will be placed in\norbit in order to view the universe unobscured by the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nOnce in orbit, it will become the principal\ntool for exploring the universe through\nthis decade and the next, and possibly\nbeyond . It will be operated from the\nGoddard Space Flight Center in support\nof astronomers working at the Goddardmanaged Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in\nnearby Baltimore .\nGoddard\'s Gamma Ray Observatory\n(GRO), a scientific satellite scheduled for\nlaunch aboard the shuttle in 1 988, is\ndrawing on in-house engineering and\ntechnical expertise for the design and\nfabrication of one of its four instruments.\nThe Naval Research Laboratory, West\nGermany\'s Max Planck Institute and\nNASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center\nare providing the other three instruments, and mission contractor TRW is\nresponsible for spacecraft design,\ndevelopment and fabrication , and instrument integration.\nGRO will weigh approximately 17\ntons and measure 70 feet between the\ntips of its two solar arrays. It will be the\nlargest scientific satellite ever launched\nby Goddard. Its design is based on the\nmultimission modular spacecraft (MMS)\nsystem, which was developed at God-\n\ndard by Frank Cepollina. The MMS\nsystem, which includes logistiCS support\nmodules for communications, power,\ndata, and attitude control , along w ith a\nflight support system located in the rear\nof the shuttle\'s cargo bay, was designed\nto facilitate the on-orbit repair and/or\nreplacement of defective satellite\nmodules. MMS development represents\na move toward spacecraft design standardization, which results in costsavings and life extension for satellite\nmissions. Should one of a satellite\'s\nmodules fail during its mission , the\ndefective module can be replaced by\ncrew servicing in the shuttle\'s cargo bay .\nThe efficacy of the MMS system was\ndemonstrated in April 1984, when\nastronauts George Nelson and James\nvan Hoften retrieved, repaired and redeployed the Goddard-managed Solar\nMaximum Mission spacecraft. After\ncompleting nine months of its missionobserving and documenting the sun\'s\nenergy build-up and release-the Solar\nMax spacecraft lost its ability for precision pointing at the sun, due to a failure\nin its attitude control system module.\nFollowing the successful repair mission ,\nwhich involved replacing the faulty\nmodule, Solar Max is back in business.\nSolar Max\'s faulty attitude control\nsystem module itself will be back in\nbusiness as of October 1989, when the\nUpper Atmosphere Research Satellite\n(UARS) is launched from the space shuttle.

This is yet another advantage of\nthe MMS system: It introduces the concept of " off the shelf\' satellite systems,\nconSisting of parts which can be deployed,\nretrieved , repaired and reused with new,\nmission-unique instruments.\nThe UARS spacecraft design makes\nadditional use of the MMS concept. A\nspare power module from the currently\norbiting Landsat satellite series will be\nused on UARS. Following the completion\nof its mission-determining the effects\nof natural and man-made causes on the\nupper atmosphere-UARS will be\nretrieved. Its MMS components then\nmay be reused on another satellite, representing considerable cost savings for\nNASA and the American taxpayers.\n\nSpace Science at a Bargain\nThe concept of reusing satellites even\nwithout retrieving them is the idea\nbehind another unique Goddard mission ,\nwhich resulted in the world\'s first\nspacecraft encounter with a comet last\nSeptember. A group of engineers under\n\nthe direction of Goddard\'s Dr. Robert W.\nFarquhar devised a series of complex\nmaneuvers whereby a satellite which\nhad been in orbit for seven years would\nbe re-routed to pass through the tail of\nthe Comet Giacobini-Zinner, 44 million\nmiles from Earth . Data from the historic\nencounter gave scientists new insights\ninto the enigmatic nature of comets and\nindicated that comets are not at all the\nbenign objects they were thought to be .\nAnother innovative Goddard program\ngives curious earthlings the opportunity\nto test their theories about the space environment aboard the space shuttle. The\nGet Away SpeCial (GAS) program makes\nuse of leftover space in the shuttle\'s\ncargo bay to allow for low-cost experimenting by individuals, small companies,\neducational institutions or research\norganizations which would otherwise be\nunable to afford the price of flying an experiment on the shuttle. For a $10,000\nfee, experimenters can fly their 200-1b.\npayloads in the Goddard-developed five\ncubic-foot cylindrical canisters, which\nare then mounted in the shuttle\'s cargo\nbay (smaller canisters are available for\n\nsmaller payloads and a lower fee).\nOriginally, the payloads merely were\nexposed to the space environment in\nthe shuttle\'s open cargo bay, but this\nyear a new ejection device makes it\npossible for experimenters to have their\npayloads ejected into independent orbits .\nThe program is very successful and,\napparently, very popular. It\'s received\nsome 400 reservations, while more than 20\nexperiments have already flown. Another\n20 are ready to go, space permitting.\nThe principles of economy, efficiency\nand Simplicity underly Goddard\'s Spartan program as well. The Spartan is a\nspace research subsatellite, which is\ndeployed and retrieved on-orbit by the\nshuttle\'s remote manipulator system .\nOnce in space , however, Spartan operates\nautonomously , via an onboard processor which activates stores pointing,\nmaneuvering and stabilizing commands.\nThe Spartan collects data in support of\nhigh-energy astrophysics, ultraviolet\nastronomy and solar physiCS research .\nThree Spartan carriers have already\nbeen built and two more are in the offing. The Spartan carriers , which are built\nin-house at Goddard , all incorporate the\nsame basic design, which, like the MMS\nsystem, allows for the interchangeability of\nstandard modules, while accommodating\nmission-unique systems as necessary.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nGoddard is probably the most diversified of the NASA research centers.\nThis is not surprising, considering the\nsweeping breadth of the center\'s fundamental mission-to make possible the\nexpansion of human knowledge of the\nearth, its environment, the solar system\nand the universe through the development and use of near-earth orbit spacecraft. Volumes can , and indeed have,\nbeen written on the variety of scientific\nand technical approaches Goddard\nemploys in pursuing its mission . Yet, if\nthe man for whom the center is named\nleft a legacy of some 214 patents, then\nit is to be expected that the work of\nthose who pursue his vision would be\nprodigious . Lt. Homer Boushey of the\nArmy Air Corps knew Robert Goddard.\nIn making the following comment, he\nprobably had little idea how true his\nwords would ring in describing the man\nand his public monument: " He reminded\nme of the man who plants the seed of a\ntree, so that others might one day sit in\nits shade." At Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, that tree is still growing. 0\n\nGAS Cans: Get A way Special (GAS) canisters\nare seen mounted at upper right and lower left\nof the space shuttle\'s cargo bay.\n\n26\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nNASA News in Briel\n\nA model of the Industrial Space Facility,\na pri vat ely financed commercial space\nplatform.

(SII) of Houston,\nTexas, has signed an agreement with\nNASA whereby the company will launch\nits privately-owned, commercial platform,\nthe Industrial Space Facility (ISF), from\nthe space shuttle in 1989. The ISF will be\nmodular in concept and will measure 35\nfeet by 14.5 feet initially. While it will not\nbe permanently manned, it is designed to\nbe habitable and will provide a "shirt\nsleeve" work environment for astronauts\nwhen docked with the shuttle or space\nstation.\nPhilip E. Culbertson, associate administrator for NASA\'s Space Station Office, says, " NASA considers the ISF to be\na complementary capability to the space\nstation. There are characteristics of the\nISF and space station that are similar. For\nthese reasons, there may be some\naspects of the two programs that are of\nmutual interest and use to both NASA\nandSII."\nTo this end, NASA\'s Space Station Office and SII signed a separate agreement\nto provide for the beneficial exchange of\ninformation during the definition and\npreliminary design phase of the space\nstation. The agreement also lays the\ngroundwork for subsequent discussions\nand negotiations during the space station\ndevelopment period, scheduled to begin\nin mid-1987. SII is the first private company to sign such an agreement, and it\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nis hoped that the information exchange\nwill result in a commercial facility capable\nof compatible operations with the space\nstation.\nNASA Administrator James M. Beggs\nsays, "We hope the ISF will be the first of\nmany such platforms to be funded and\nbuilt by private industry that will complement the permanently-manned space\nstation and lead eventually to an industrial\npark in space."\nAccording to Max Faget, president of\nSpace Industries, Inc., the ISF "will respond to a variety of private research and\nmanufacturing needs. Industry could take\nadvantage of the unique gravity-free environment of space to conduct experiments that cannot be effectively\nduplicated here on earth, particularly in\nthe areas of pharmaceuticals and\nbiological products, pure and exotic\ncrystals, and new metals and alloys."\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nAnother agreement between NASA\nand a private company provides for the\nsupply of NASA technical expertise in the\ndevelopment of a commercial liquid-fuel\nupper stage for boosting shuttle-deployed\nsatellites to geosynchronous orbit. Scott\nScience and Technology of Lancaster,\nCalifornia, is developing a privatelyfinanced satellite transfer vehicle, which\nwill have the capacity to boost satellites\nranging from 2000 to 19,000 pounds.\nEngineers at Johnson Space Center in\nHouston will monitor the stage\'s develo~\nment and will consult with Scott Science\nand Technology staff regarding technical\nproblems. Former astronaut David R.\nScott is president of the company, which\nhas agreed to reimburse NASA for the\nuse of any test facilities, and for salaries\nand travel expenses of Johnson Space\nCenter personnel.\n\nB\neHlnl Organized ...\nTo stimulate high technology research\nand development that takes advantage of\nthe characteristics of space, NASA has\nnamed five teams to establish Centers for\nthe Commercial Development of Space.\nThe five centers are jOint undertakings of\n\ngovernment, industry and academic\nteams, and all share the goal of develo~\ning new products which either have commercial potential or contribute to potential\nnew commercial ventures. Battelle Columbus Laboratories of Columbus, Ohio,\nwill focus its development efforts on\nmultlphase materials processing. The\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham will\nbe involved in macromolecular\ncrystallography in space. The remaining\nthree centers -Vanderbilt University, the\nInstitute for Technology Development,\nHancock, Mississippi, and the University\nof Alabama at Huntsville-will focus on\nmetallurgical processing in space, remote\nsensing, and materials processing,\nrespectively. All five centers will coocdinate their efforts with NASA field\ncenters. NASA will fund the centers for a\nperiod not to exceed five years. During\nthis period, the centers are expected to\nstimulate commercial ventures which will\nallow them to become financially selfsustaining.\n\nSpace Educallon ...\nNASA is making plans to broadcast live\nlessons from space during teacher-inspace Christa McAuliffe\'s shuttle flight,\nwhich is set for launch in late January.\nDuring the first lesson, "The Ultimate\nField Trip," McAuliffe will take viewers on\na tour of the shuttle. "Where We\'ve Been,\nWhere We\'re Going" will review technological advances resulting from the\nspace program, and outline expectations\nfor the future of space exploration. Other\non-board activities, such as demonstrations of Newton\'s laws in a microgravity\nenvironment, will be filmed as well, and\nthese will be used in developing a series\nof educational products.\nIn addition, three Student Involvement\nProject experiments will fly aboard the\nshuttle, and McAuliffe will assist mission\nspecialists in conducting them. One experiment will use a semi-permeable membrane to direct crystal growth. Another will\nstudy chicken embryo development in the\nspace environment, and the third will\nmonitor the effects of weightlessness on\ngrain formation and strength in metals.\n27\n\nNASA\n\nTeChnOlOgy\nutilization\nServices\n\nTECHNOLOGY UTILIZATION OFFICERS\nTechnology transfer experts can help you\napply the innovations in NASA Tech Briefs .\nThe Technology Utilization Officer\nat each NASA Field Center is an applications engineer who can help you make use\nof new technology developed at his center.\nHe brings you NASA Tech Briefs and other\nspecial publications, sponsors conferences, and arranges for expert assistance\nin solving technical problems.\n\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s)\nare prepared by the centerTUO\'s.

Gaining its increased efficiency\nthrough the incorporation of a junction\ntransistor, the solar-cell transistor would\nbe relatively immune to variations in the\ncommon-emitter current gain between\ndevices. Even for a 2-to-1 spread in this\ngain, the open-circuit voltage will vary\nonly about 20 mY.\n(See page 56 .)\nFront\nContact\n\np+\n\np+\n\nLow-Cost Humidity Sensor\nA simple, inexpensive, electronic humidity sensor produces an output that is\nreadily used by indicator or control circuits. The new sensor is a reSistor/capacitor oscillator in which a water-absorbent\nplastic film is the insulator in the capacitive element. As the film absorbs more\nwater with increasing atmospheric humidity, its capacitance increases, reducing the oscillation frequency. Because\nfrequency can be measured more readily\nthan the weak currents produced as outputs in the older sensors, the new sensor\noffers improved accuracy and resolution .\nThe sensor operates at a safe, low voltage - so low that a significant electrolysis of the absorbed water does not occur.\n(See page 55 .)\n\'u\nQloUVdcl\n\np + Si Substrate\n\nNew Product Ideas ....

In addition, the container holds\ncomponents in fixed positions so that\nthey can be serialized and identified from\ntheir locations. The container is suitable\nfor holding components during both storing and shipping. Because the container\ncontains a plastic strip magnet, magnetic\ncomponents will be held in place, even\nwhen the container is open.

The\nethynyl-containing phenoxy resins have\nan excellent shelf life in solution or in bulk.\nThey also offer lower moisture absorption\nand better thermal stability over state-ofthe-art cross-linked phenoxy resins. Depending upon the cross-link density, the\ncured ethynyl-modified phenoxy resins\nare solvent resistant but still thermoformable and relatively tough . These modified\nresins show potential for use as adhesives, composite matrices, solventresistant coatings, membranes, insulators,\nand films.\n(See page 109.)\n\n19_"0..:..- """-~\n~-\n\n.... ~\n\n_.\n\no\n\n"", ~ -@- f; .

In the first method one or more pins\nwould be scanned over a blank page and\nenergized at intervals to emboss the text\non paper, one or more dots at a time. In\nthe second approach (shown in the figure) a hand-held device containing one or\nmore character-generator cells would be\nused by the reader to scan the lines of\ntext manually. In both cases the text\nwould be read from the tape in a form that\nwould directly produce the Braille characters and would be fed into a RAM buffer one or more pages at a time.\n(See page 135.)\n\nSolid\xc2\xb7State Detector for\nTrace Materials\nA detector that senses as few as 10 12\nmolecules of a given trace chemical on\nits surface could find applications in industrial process control and in environmental analysis. Containing no moving\nparts , amenable to large-scale integration, and operating at room temperature,\nthe detector is a thin-film, solid-state tunnel junction composed of layers of aluminum , aluminum oxide, and gold on a\nglazed ceramic substrate. When the\ntrace chemical is adsorbed on the outer\ngold film and diffuses into it, the tunneling\ncharacteristics are altered, the nature of\nthe alteration depending on the trace material. After adsorbing (and detecting) a\ntrace chemical , the device can be restored to its initial state by heating or\nwashing with an appropriate solvent.\n(See page 88 .)\n\nRotary Speed Sensor for\nAntilocking Brakes\nA rotary speed sensor, developed as\npart of an antilocking brake system for\nmotorcycles, produces a negative pressure approximately proportional to rotational speed . This pressure is converted\nto a signal that prevents the brakes from\nlocking. The sensor is a centrifugal air\npump that is turned by a motorcycle\nwheel. Use of pump inlet pressure, rather\nthan pump output pressure, as the\nbraking-control signal eliminates the\npressure pulsations caused by the pump\nvanes. Because the pressure signal is\npulse free and directly proportional to rotational speed , a fluidic differentiation,\nrather than a more expensive fluidic accelerometer, is used to control the\nbrakes.\n(See page 128 .)\n\no\n\n1\n2\n3\nvAu - VAl .

The transmission line provides a constant impedance for pulses that come from\nthe switch and distributes the pulses across\nthe length of the laser as nearly uniform\nwave fronts. It also allows a smaller, more\nefficient magnetic core to be used in the\nswitch. Losses and circuit capacitance are\nless than for a full-Iaser-width line and core.\nThe tapered line (see figure) matches the\ndisparate geometries of the core and the\nlaser. At the same time, it reduces unwanted\nreflections and reversals of current and energy flux.\nThe line is fed from a pulse-shaping network composed of five sections, the dimensions of which are determined by the required characteristic impedance, current\ndensity, and core size. As the core saturates, it removes its impedance from between the laser and the pulse-shaping network and thus enables the network to couple\nrapidly to the laser.\nThe characteristic impedance of the tapered line can be adjusted by including discrete capaCitors spaced along the line. With\nan impedance mismatch thus created, the\npulse waveform can be peaked by circuit\nringing. The peak, superimposed on the\nmain pulse, can be used to increase the preionization electron density and thereby reduce the magnitude of the main pulse required to excite the laser. Alternatively, the\ntransmission line can be tapered nonuniformly to achieve the same effect.\nThe cross-sectional area of the core is\nchosen to ensure saturation at the desired\npulse magnitude: Saturation should occur at\n\nthe peak of the main discharge pulse so that\nthe entire main pulse is switched into the\npreionized laser. The magnetic path length\nof the core is chosen for efficient and fast\ncoupling of the pulse into the laser and thus\ntends to determine the width of the section\nof the transmission line on which the core is\nmounted. For minimum reflection and loss,\nthe line should generally match the impedance of the pulse-shaping network.\nThe size of the line should not result in too\nlarge a capacitance; this would cause an\nexcessive amount of energy to be stored in\nthe line and diminish overall efficiency. Increasing the taper angle reduces the capacitance, but too large a taper will produce\nan arced wave front in the pulse, and the\npulse energy will not arrive simultaneously\nat all parts of the laser.\nThe overall capacitance can be reduced\nby using parallel tapered lines from multiple\nswitches and pulse-shaping networks, joining in a single wide transmission line as they\napproach the laser. This alternative would\nrequire tuned pulse-shaping networks,\nmatched magnetic switches, and precisely\ndimenSioned, tapered sections, but would\nfurther reduce energy requirements and increase efficiency.\nThis work was done by Thomas J.

The new approach\nprovides greater independence between\nthe shape and magnitude of the preionizing\npulse and those of the main pulse. It also\nprovides a more sharply rising preionizing\npulse.\nA simple pulse-coupling winding is attached to the core of the magnetic switch\nthat energizes the laser (see figure). Under\nthe control of a synchronizing circuit, a\npulse is first applied to the pulse-coupling\nwinding and the magnetic switch core. In its\nunsaturated state, the core acts as an efficient pulse transformer, sending the pulse\nas a preionizing peak to the laser. The synchronizing circuit then turns on a second,\nmuch larger pulse to the magnetic switch\nproper, which sends a larger firing pulse to\nthe laser.\nThe pulse-coupling winding is simple,\nlight in weight, low in bulk and power consumption, and inexpensive. It allows the preionizing pulse to be shaped independently\nfor maximum efficiency and effectiveness\nand allows the main firing pulse to be given\n\nA Simple Pulse-Coupling Winding on a saturable reactor core lets t he core act as a pulse\ntransformer, passing a preionizing pu lse from the winding to the tapered transm ission\nli ne, then to t he laser.

A\nlong (rv100 ns) input pulse enables the radiation to pass a large number of times\nthrough the laser-cavity Fabry-Perot resonators, thereby improving the control of\nwavelength, bandwidth, polarization, and\ntransverse modes. Another advantage of\nthe increase in pulse length (from the previous value of 10 to 30 ns for an excimer\nlaser) is that timing becomes less critical.\nAs shown schematically in the figure,\nthe laser system includes a high-voltage\npower supply and a pulse-forming network. Before the main power pulse is applied, the laser is preionized by two rows of\n42\n\n30 resistively ballasted ultraviolet arcs, one\nrow on each side. While the main pulse is\nbeing formed, it is withheld from the laser\ndischarge tube by a saturable-inductor\nswitch mounted on a tapered transmission\nline. The inductor saturates at the peak of\nthe pulse, thereby allowing the pulse to\npass along the transmission line to the discharge tube. The operation of the switch\nand transmission line is discussed more\nfully in the two preceding articles; " Pulse\nCoupling for Laser Excitation " (NPO16403) and "Generating Independent Preionizing Pulses for Lasers" (NPO-16402).\nThe 8O-nF, O.6-Q pulse-forming network\nis charged to 16 kV in 150 ns from an 8O-nF\nstorage capacitor using a grounded-grid\n\nthyratron. The voltage rise time of the network is 10 ns. The rise time is e\'xtended by\nthe delay in saturation between the inner\nand outer laminations of the magnetic\nswitch and by the residual switch inductance during saturation. The total voltage\nrise time at the laser is 20 ns.\nThe laser discharge is 42 cm long, 0.7 cm\nwide, and 0.9 cm high.

The circuit thus allows the shaft angular position\nto be measured with 1-degree accuracy.\nWith simple modifications, the circuit can\nprovide higher or lower resolution from\nsingle- or multiple-pulse-per-revolution\nsources.\nMany existing shaft encoders have insufficient resolution for modern instrumentatm and data-di~y systems.

The\nperiod counter merely counts the number\nof pulses between two input trigger pulses.\nThis number is latched, and the counter is\nreset. The latch is refreshed by alternating\ninput pulses. The latched number is connected with a parallel bus to the program-\n\nable divider, which divides the reference\nfrequency by the number stored in the\nlatch.

Each amplifier is connected to the\ncombiner through a switch consisting of\nresonant structures, radio-frequency\nchokes, and a diode. The switchE\\s not only\npermit flexibility in the selection of amplifiers but also isolate the unused amplifiers\nfrom the network, all while operating at a\nrelatively low power loss.\nThe operation of the switches and combiner is illustrated schematically in the figure, neglecting parasitic capacitances and\ninductances. In the switch, the opencircuited quarter-wavelength section of\ntransmission line presents to the diode a\nradio-frequency (RF) short circuit to\nground. This section also presents an open\ncircuit for direct current, permitting the dc\ndiode-switching bias to be injected.\nThe half-wave section reflects the diode\nimpedance to the input/output line. When\nthe diode is reverse biased, it presents a\nhigh RF impedance across the input/output line, thereby allowing the input signal to\npass undisturbed along this line to the output. When the diode is forward biased, it\npresents a low RF impedance, which\ncauses the input power to be reflected\nback to the amplifier. Thus, the switch is on\nwhen the diode is reverse biased and off\nwhen the diode is forward biased.\nIn the combiner, each switch is connected to the combining junction through a\nquarter-wave section. When a switch is off,\nthe short circuit is transformed by the\nquarter-wave section to an open circuit at\nthe combining-junction end. Thus, when a\nswitch is off, it presents a high impedance\n\n46\n\nInput\n\n>---......--4~-----I~Outp ut\n\nTransmission\nlines\n\nDiode\nBias\n\nSWITCH\n\nImpedance\nTransformer\n\nInput\n1\n\nNOTE:\'\\ = Wavelength\n\nInput\n\n2\n\nInput\nn\n\nCOMBINER\n\nA Switching RF\xc2\xb7Power Combiner with no moving parts is assembled from diodes, RF\nchokes (RFC\'s), and sections of transmission line.

Therefore, it\nis desirable to include some kind of impedance transformer at the output. Since the\nimpedance changes with the state of the\nswitches, an engineering compromise has\nto be made in the design of the trans-\n\nformer: For example, it may be necessary\nto select a transformation to an average or\nmost frequently encountered output\nimpedance.\nDiodes for the switches must be selected to withstand the worst combination\nof operating faults. The peak-to-peak voltage that a reverse-biased diode may have\nto withstand could be several times the\nnormal value obtained when all impedances are matched and all phase relationships are correct. For example, if the output is shorted, the voltages at all the diodes\n\nare doubled. If an input is 180\xc2\xb0 out of\nphase, the voltage is multiplied several\ntimes at the affected diode. The diodes\nmust also be able to withstand the forwardbias and worst-case -fault current and\npower.\nThis work was done by Bruce L. Conroy,\nRichard B. Postal, and James F.

The new\nfeeds would each have two appropriatelyshaped reflecting elements (see figure).\nSuch an offset dual-shaped subreflector\n(DSS) feed would bring the gain of existing\nparaboloid or Cassegrain antennas up to\nthat of reflector antennas of more recent\ndesign at a cost considerably lower than\nthat for reshaping the existing reflecting\nsurfaces.\nMathematical procedures have been\ndeveloped for synthesizing nearly optimum\nshapes for the DSS elements of the new\nfeeds. The synthesis is based on an extension of an approximate geometrical optiCS\nformulation developed previously for an\noffset dual-shaped high-gain antenna. In\nthat antenna design, the power to be radiated was reflected first from a sub reflector\nand then from a large reflector that produced a uniform phase and amplitude distribution. In the present DSS feeds, the first\nand second reflections are from offset subreflectors. The second reflection produces\na spherical wave that feeds either the hyperboloidal element of a Cassegrain antenna or the main paraboloidal reflector.\nThe power distribution of the wave feeding the main reflector is designed to have a\nsec4 angular dependence and, if desired,\nan appropriate low spillover taper. This angular dependence cannot be produced by\nconic-section (spherical, paraboloidal, or\nhyperboloidal) reflecting surfaces unless a\nspecial relatively narrow-band feed is used\n(e.g., a Potter horn).\nThe synthesis problem is to find shapes\nfor the sub reflectors that satisfy the afore48\n\nSpherical Wave Fronts\nSec 4 (rt/2) Power\n(or Low-Spillover Pattern)\n\nPower\ncosp (6)\nFeed\n\n"1------\';---,.-;.1: -::}\n\'"\n\n- _ ..II:\'\n\nFocus of\nParaboloid\n\n----- ....\n\nTo Equivalent\nParaboloid\n\nSec 4 (1)12)\n(or Low-Spillover)\nPower\n\nAntenna Feed with dual-shaped subreflectors can yield a 10-to-20-percent Improvement in the efficiency of existing large-aperture paraboloidal or Cassegrainian\nantennas.\n\n,... MOOlfied\n\nmentioned phase and power-distribution\nconstraints. By differentiation of the pathlength equation, the phase constraint can\nbe expressed as a differential. The powerdistribution constraint is expressed as an\nintegral that relates the feed-pattern and\nobjective (sec4) pattern. Since there are to\nbe two sub reflector elements and only one\nsuch element is required to satisfy the\nphase constraint, some freedom remains\nin selecting the shape of the other element\nto obtain the required power distribution.\nThe key to finding approximate solutions\nthat satisfy both constraints is an ad hoc\nassumption about the angular dependence of certain transformation functions\nappearing in the problem. The justification\nfor the assumption is that when the feed\npattern and the final scattered pattern\nhave circular symmetric dependence, the\nassumption very often leads to practical\n\nsolutions.\nApplication of the assumption leads to a\nsimultaneous pair of nontotal partial differentials that can be integrated along any\npath as a pair of simultaneous ordinary differential equations of first order. These\nyield a series of contours for the first subreflector. From these, a corresponding set of\ncontours for the second subreflector is 0btained by applying the phase constraint.\nThe resulting DSS surfaces satiSfy the\nphase constraint exactly and satisfy the\npower-distribution constraint to a close\napproximation.\nThis work was done by Victor Galindo\nand Alan G.

This is because of the rectifier\ndrops, copper losses, and transformer\nleakage inductance.\nThe closed-loop regulation of a power\nconverter is improved from between 5 and\n10 percent for individual inductors to between 1 and 2 percent if the inductors are\nwound on a common core.

The new structure differs from the older ones in that the\ngain in the spaces between the laser channels is approximately equal to the gain in\nthe channels.\nIn the new structure, the laserlwaveguide channels are distinguished from the\ninterchannel spaces in refractive index but\nnot in gain. The refractive index of each\nchannel is slightly higher than the index of\nthe surrounding structure. This partially\nconfines the light to the channels.

The angles are measured with respect to the forward direction (the direction along\nthe channels).\n\nnels were absorptive. This favored oscillation in superrrodes that were least absorbed\nin the interchannel spaces; that is, in the\nhigh-order supermodes. In the new structure, there is no longer a mechanism that\nfavors the high-order supermodes, and the\nfundamental supermocle can dominate.\nWafers with the improved laser arrays\nwere prepared by liquid-phase epitaxial\ngrowth. First, the layers up to and including\nthe p-AI01 GaOgAs layer containing the\nlaser channels (see Figure 1) were grown\non an n + -GaAs substrate. The spaces between the channels were then formed by\netching with a 1:8:8 mixture of H2S0 4 ,\nH~2\' and H~. The remaining laser ridges\nwere then 0.5 /Am high. Two lateral ridge\n(channef) spacings were used: Ridges 4.5/Am\nwide with a 9-/Am period and ridges 2.5/Am\nwide with a 5-/Am period.\nThe ridges were covered with a 4-/Amthick layer of Ge-doped p-Alo4Gao.sAs.\nThe ridges thus became buried laserl\nwaveguide channels. The next layer was\nGe-doped p + -GaAs, which was followed\nby a Cr/Au positive-side electrode. After\nlapping, a contact of AuGelAu was deposited\non the bottom. Laser arrays were cleaved\nfrom the wafer to a length of 250 /Am .\nFigure 2 shows the far-field radiation\npatterns in the laser-junction plane produced by lasers with the 9- and 5-/Am spacings. The peaks at 0\xc2\xb0 and 5.5\xc2\xb0 in the 9-/Am\nlaser pattern correspond to those calculated when all lasers operate in phase. The\nlesser peaks surrounding the three main\npeaks correspond to a higher order mode.\nThe width of the three main peaks is 1.3\xc2\xb0,\nwhich is 1.6 times the diffraction-limited\nwidth.\nThe pattern for the 5-/Am laser shows a\nSingle central peak. The width of 1.6\xc2\xb0 to\n1.8\xc2\xb0 is only about 1.2 times the diffraction\nlimit. This single narrow peak indicates that\nthe radiation is well concentrated in the\nfundamental supermode.\nThis work was done by Seiji Mukai, C. P.\nUndsey, J. Katz, E. Kapon. A.

Previously, transistor "burn in" - that is, operating the\ntransistor continuously for an extended\nperiod to stabilize its characteristics - required a large heat sink to dissipate the\nheat generated at high power levels. Elaborate control electronics was also needed to\nmaintain the transistor cases at the specified temperature.\n.\nThe heat-transfer liquid is Fluorinert\nFC-77 (or equivalent). The liquid boils at\n100 0 C, which is the specified temperature\nat which the transistor cases should be\nmaintained during the burn-in with this\ntechnique. Refrigerants boiling at other\ntemperatures might be used for burn-in at\nthose temperatures, provided that they\nmeet the requirements of safety and\nchemical compatibility with the compo52\n\nnents under test.\nThe boiling fluid absorbs heat from the\ntransistors without itself increasing in temperature, keeping the transistors within an\nacceptably narrow range between 98 0 and\n101 0 C. In comparison with standard burnin methods, more power can be dissipated\nin less area, and a large heat sink is not\nneeded. Electronic controls are minimal,\nsince the fluid itself regulates the transistor\ntemperature.\nThe transistors are mounted on aluminum frames with cable harnesses for electrical power and grounding. The frames are\nIoNered into an aluminum tank measuring 36\nby 30 by 30 in. (91.4 by 76.2 by 76.2 cm). The\ntank is filled with the liquid to a level of 2 in.\n(5 cm) above the topmost row of transistors. A heavy aluminum lid containing coils\nof copper tubing is placed over the tank.\nTap water flowing through the tubing keeps\n\nthe lid cool. Power to the transistors is\nturned on, and, as their temperature rises\nto about 100 0 C, the fluid starts boiling. The\nvapor condenses on the cool lid and returns to the tank.\nSeveral safety controls are incorporated in the burn-in setup. A level sensor\nmonitors the depth of liquid in the tank. A\nflow sensor measures the flow of water\nthrough the condensing coils. A conductivity probe monitors the liquid for the presence of water and other conductive contaminants. Thermocouples measure the\ncase temperature of the transistors. If any\nof these instruments detects an abnormal\ncondition, the burn-in system is automatically shut down.\nThis work was done by Bernard C.

The monitor is used with interface\ncircuitry in the beacon, which acts as a buffer so that operation of the beacon is not\nadversely affected if the monitor is removed or if the connecting cable is accidentally short circuited.\n\nThe monitor is used with emergency locating transmitters (ELI\'s) on aircraft and\nemergency poSition-indicating radio beacons (EPIRB\'s) on boats. Both the ELI\'s\nand the EPIRB\'s are essentially the same\nsystems, transmitting an internationally recognized distress signal at 121.5 or 243 MHz,\nexcept the ELI\'s are activated by impact,\nand the EPIRB\'s by contact with water.\nTo test an ELT, a pilot sets the monitor\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\ncontrol switch to the reset/test position\n(see figure). The monitor then bypasses the\nimpact-actuated switch and turns the beacon on. At the same time, the monitor disables the frequency modulator in the beacon audio-signal generator, which ordinarily repeatedly sweeps from about 1,600 to\nalx>ut 300 Hz two to four times per second\n(the distress signal required by law). Consequently, the transmitter is operating but\nemits a single tone not recognized as a distress signal: This prevents false alarms. If\nthe beacon operates properly, the monitor\nemits the modulating tone and lights a\nlamp labeled "ELT transmitting."\nWhen the pilot sets the monitor switch to\nthe "armed" position, the beacon is ready\nto transmit a real distress signal. If the beacon battery power drops excessively or if\nthe beacon starts transmitting, the monitor\nwill illuminate indicator lamps and sound\nan alarm. The pilot also has the option of\nactuating the beacon distress Signal manually by turning on the monitor switch.\nAlthough ELT\'s transmit a standard distress signal and have similar circuits, there\nare some differences among units in\nswitching the distress signal. Some are\nelectrically latched, some mechanically.\nWith mechanical latching, the switch stays\nclosed once it is activated by impact. With\nelectrical latching, the impact switch is\nclosed only temporarily, but it turns on a\nsilicon-controlled rectifier, which then remains latched in conduction. These differences entail slight differences in some\nparts of the monitor and interface circuits\ndevoted to bypassing the impact switch.\nSince an EPIRB has no impact switch, it is\n\nMonitor Switch\n\n0\nTest-Control\nOscillator\n\n-\n\nPower\nInverter\n\no Armed\n0\n\n-}\n..\n\nResetlTest\n\nTo Beacon\nControl Points\n\n"ELTOn"\n\nFrom Beacon\n\nFrequency\nDivider\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"ELTOff"\nlamp\n\n(((((~\n\nComparator\n\nI-..

During\nperiods of darkness, the motor is made to\nact as a generator, drawing kinetic energy\nfrom the flywheel and supplying it to the\nload.\nThe control circuit (see figure) includes\nvoltage comparators and amplifiers that\nmeasure the load voltage, source voltage,\nmotor speed, and motor current. The\nmotor-current feedback signal is derived\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nfrom the voltage across a series resistor,\nwhile the tachometer output voltage\nserves as the motor-speed feedback. The\ncontrol signals developed by the amplifiers\nand comparators are applied to the\nSWitching transistors that commutate the\nmotor current.\nPulses of voltage from the power-supply\nbus are applied to the motor at a typical\nrepetition rate of 10 kHz. The repetition\nrate is that of an externally-generated sawtooth timing and voltage-comparison signal. The effective current and voltage applied to the motor, and therefore the average\ntorque, are controlled by varying the pulse\nduration.\n\nIn the energy-storing (accelerating)\nmode, the pulses are sufficiently long to\novercome the back emf of the motor and\nto force the accelerating motor current to\na commanded value. When the motor\nspeed reaches the maximum allowable,\nthe pulse duration is reduced to a value\njust great enough to overcome frictional\nlosses and maintain constant speed.\nWhen the insolation is below the minimum for charging, the pulse duration is\nshortened. The back emf of the motor is allowed to force a reversal of the motor current, so that the motor supplies power to\nthe bus.

The concept was originally developed for semiconductor thermocouples composed of lanthanum sulfide\n(the negative material) and boron carbide\n(the positive material).

The test makes it\nunnecessary to resort to X-ray inspection\nto distinguish the terminals.\nFor maximum reliability, the outside foil\nof a high-voltage capacitor should be connected to a particular point in a circuit for example, to ground or to a low voltage.\nIt is therefore necessary to determine\nwhich terminal is connected to the outer\nfoil.

The electrolytic medium and the voltage between them accelerate corrosion\nand migration interactions between the cell metal contacts and the plastic encapsulant.\n\nA study employing the technique\nshowed that the solar\xc2\xb7cell encapsulant\nacts as an electrolyte that contributes to\ncorrosion by allowing silver to migrate from\nthe metal contact grid. The silver in the en\xc2\xb7\ncapsulant reduces its transparency and\nthereby reduces cell efficiency.

Processor\n\nComputer Programs\n\nLaser Doppler velocimetry (LOV) has\nbeen used extenSively for measuring flow\nvelocities by tracking particles seeded into\nthe flow. The seeding requirement, however, is often undesirable and sometimes\nimpractical. A new method is under development to measure the flow velocity of the\nmolecules directly by nonintrusive laser\ntechniques. This method, combined with a\nvibration-free design, makes the flowvelocity measurements practical in severe\nvibrational environments.\nThe method is based on the Raman\nscattering of light from specific molecules\nin the flow, such as N2 , O2 , or H2. If the\nmolecules are moving, the scattered light\nalso exhibits a Doppler shift in frequency.\nThe shift in the Raman spectra, therefore,\ncan be related directly to the velocity of the\nmolecules. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy with a single laser could, in principle,\nbe used, but weak Signals and inadequate\nspectrometer resolution preclude such a\nmeasurement. The use of coherent (stimulated) Raman spectroscopy increases the\nSignal by orders of magnitude and has a\nconsiderably higher resolution due to the\nnarrow line widths associated with lasers.\ntn one version of coherent Raman spectroscopy, called stimulated Raman gain\nspectroscopy (SRGS), two lasers interact\nwith the molecules, and the difference in\nfrequency between these lasers is adjusted to be in resonance with a Raman\nshift exhibited by a specific molecule.\nMany geometrical arrangements can be\nenvisioned for these two lasers. Two configurations, however, define the limits to\ntheir interactions with the molecules;\nnamely, forward and backward scattering.\n\nIn forward scattering, the moving molecules "see" two laser beams, the frequencies of which are shifted in the same (spectral) direction and by about the same\namount; hence, there is very little Doppler\nshift (and breadth) by which to measure velocity. In backward scattering, on the other\nhand, the molecules "see" one laser beam\nshifted in one spectral direction, while the\nother laser beam is shifted in the opposite\ndirection. This results in a large Doppler\nshift (and breadth) that is considerably easier to measure. The ratio of Doppler shift to\nbreadth is actually the same in both cases,\nbut the larger shift exhibited in backward\nscattering (typically 15 times that for forward scattering) is easier to measure since\nit relaxes the stability and line width requirements placed on the lasers. This concept for measuring molecular velocities\nhas been demonstrated in the laboratory,\nbut the double-ended configuration employs tightly focused, counter-propagating\nlaser beams and would be impossible to\napply in severe vibrational environments\nsuch as in wind tunnels.\nThe solution to this problem is to mount\nboth lasers on a single optical table and retroreflect one of the beams back onto itself.\nIf this is done with a corner cube and lens\n(in effect, a retrometer), as shown in the figure, the retroreflected beam is brought to\nthe same focal point as the forward directed beams. This situation occurs\nsince a corner cube sends light back in the\nsame direction from which it came. A lens\nis used to render a collimated (parallel)\nbeam incident on the corner cube. This\ncombination renders the desired focal\npoint (within optical tolerances set by the\n\n7t Design of Un..r Quedr8tlc\nR... ul8tors end Kelmen flit.,.\n\nRaman Scattering and Retroreflection combine to yield a useful technique for wind tunnel gas-flow mapping.\n62\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nindividual components) for the retroreflected beam. The result is that this retroreflected focal point is practically independent of lateral or rotational movements of\nthe retrometer. In this manner, counterpropagating focused beams are easily attained with the simple requirement that the\nforward beams strike the retrometer. The\nretrometer can be moved (shaken) relative\nto the laser table, but this motion will not impact the overlapping of the two counterpropagating beams. Vibration-free overlap\nof the two counter-propagating beams is\ntherefore attained.\nThe laser pump beam (directed toward\nthe retrometer) simultaneously interacts\nwith the probe beam in both the forward\nand backward directions. The detector will\nfirst sense a signal (gain/loss) from the\nbackward scattering, followed by a Signal\nfrom the forward scattering. The latter signal will be observed at a later time,given by\nthe round-trip time for the probe beam to\ntravel from the focal point to the retrometer\n\nand back. Since the speed of light is about\n1 foot (0.3 meters) per nanosecond and since\nthe round trip is typically 10 feet (3 meters),\nthis delay is about 10 nanoseconds, easily\ndiscriminated with a boxcar averager.\nThus, an additional advantage of the\nretrometer configuration is the nearly simUltaneous observation of both forward\nand backward scattering. In this mode, the\nforward-scattered spectrum is essentially\nunshifted with respect to the backwardscattered spectrum and provides a nearlyzero-shift frequency reference. In other\nwords, there is no requirement in this setup\nfor an absolute frequency reference. It is\nalso possible to measure the translational\ntemperature of the gas by measuring the\nbreadth (predominantly Doppler broadened) of the backward-scattered line.\nFmlly, the breadth of the forwardocattered\nline can be related to the pressure of the\ngas, since pressure broadening generally\ndominates over Doppler broadening in this\ncase. Thus, the use of this system results in\n\na vibration-free velocimeter in which both\nforward and backward scattering can be\nobserved Simultaneously, yielding nonintrusive point measurements of velocity,\ntemperature, and pressure with a single\noptical system.\nThis work was done by Reginald J.

The\nphase relationship between the frequency\nof the field-magnitude pulses and the reference pulses is a measure of the angle of\nthe field, and an encoder adds this information to the digital pulse train.\nThe Signal-processing electronics rotate with the electrodes. An LED on the\nsensor converts the digital output of the encoder to light pulses for transmission by a\nfiber-optic light guide. A rotary optical\ncoupler transfers the encoded light pulses\nto the light-guide cable. At the remote readout device, the pulses are decoded and\n\ndisplayed as field magnitude and direction.\nA small de motor drives the electrode\nshaft. A 9-V battery powers the motor. With\na fresh battery, the sensor rotates at approximately 2,400 rpm. The rotational\nspeed decreases as the battery is used,\nbut the electric-field readout is independent of the speed within 1 percent down to\nabout 600 rpm. Separate watch batteries\nsupply power to the electronics. In its present form, this circuitry draws 8 mW.\nThe motor, batteries, electronics, and\nlight-guide coupler are housed within the\nrotating electrodes, which form a cylinder\n\n8 cm in diameter and 20 cm long. The size\ncan be reduced to approximately 1 by 2 cm\nin a subsequent refined version. With a\nsensor this size, fields that are relatively\nuniform over only a few centimeters can\nbe charted, and data can be gathered on\nelectric fields after they have been perturbed by animals or humans.\nThis work was done by Alan R.\nJohnston, Harold Kirkham, and Bjorn Eng\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Immediate applications are as\na local oscillator for heterodyne systems\nand as a tunable source for spectroscopy.\nThe tunable far-infrared output is the\nsidebands produced by the mixing of signals from a fixed-frequency far-infrared\nlaser and a tunable klystron. In the experimental apparatus (see figure), the laser\nbeam is first passed through a polarizing\nMichelson interferometer. The polarizers\nare polyester-backed wire grids positioned\nso that the laser beam passes through\neach one without change other than a\n10-percent attenuation.\nAn off-axis parabolic mirror with a focal\nlength of 2.2 cm focuses the laser beam\nonto the mixer, which is a GaAs Schottkybarrier diode at the apex of an open cornercube reflector. The laser power is quasioptically collected and coupled to the mixer\nby a 1.7-mm-long phosphor bronze whisker antenna. The diode is soldered to a\npost that passes through the center of a\nwaveguide in the corner cube.\nMillimeter-wave radiation is generated\nby the klystron, then chopped by a ferrite\nmodulator at the frequency best suited to\nthe detector used to monitor the sidebands. The chopper output then passes into\nthe waveguide and to the mixer.\nThe laser and klystron signals are mixed\nnonlinearly in the diode, producing sidebands at the sum and difference frequencies. The unused laser power and the sideband power return to the interferometer\nalong the path of the incident laser beam.\nThe interferometer path difference is\nchosen so that the sideband polarization is\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nrotated by 90\xc2\xb0, and the laser beam is not\nrotated.\nIn an ideal Michelson interferometer, all\nthe sideband power and none of the laser\npower would be reflected out. Because of\nimperfections in the polarizers and their\npositioning , some laser power leaks\nthrough with the sidebands. A tunable\nFabry-Perot interferometer filters most of\nthe laser power out of the beam and selects the desired sideband. Further sup-\n\npression of the laser component is 0btained with a mesh filter that acts as a\nsharp notch (narrow-band-rejection) filter.\nThe notch frequency is tuned by adjustment of the angle of the filter with respect\nto the beam.\nAn absorption cell for spectroscopic\nstudies is placed in the output path. The\ncell is filled with a material having a spectral absorption line within the frequency\nrange of the mixer output.

Initially, the laser\nwas operated at the 693-GHz line of formic\nacid ....nile the klystron was tuned to 93 GHz\nand chopped at 1 kHz. Unear sweeps of\nthe Fabry-Perot interferometer clearly indicated the generation of both sidebands with\n\nan excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Sidebands\nwere 0100 generated at the numerous frequencies up to 3,200 GHz. Absorption-cell\ntests were also successful; for example, by\nuse of the lower sideband of the formic\nacid line, the klystron was swept in frequency to scan the 599.92681-GHz absorption line of "heavy" water (HOG).\nThis work was done by Herbert M.\nPickett and Jam Farhoomand of Caltech\n\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, Orcle 69 on the\nTSP Request Card.\nInquiries concerning rights fa.,. the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to the Patent Counsel, NASA Resident Office.JPL [see page 29].

The convolver would produce a\nweighted sum of the nine picture elements\nand assign the sum as a new value to the\nelement in the center. The specific choice\nof the convolution weights determines\nwhether the convolver performs smoothing, spatial-frequency filtering, edge detection. or other forms of image processing.\nThe convolver (see figure) would be a\ncustom-made very-large-scale integratedcircuit chip. Since three image lines must\nbe available simultaneously for processing, two line buffers on external chips store\nthe two previously scanned lines while the\ncurrent line is being received and processed with them.\nIn low-level image-processing algo-\n\nConvolver\nOutput\n\n....-\n\n-tpw+s\n\nrithms, the convolution weights are usually\nsmall positive or negative integers, the extreme values of which differ by a factor of\n20 or less. Consequently, 6 bits (including\nthe sign) are used to represent the weights,\nsince such a representation is adequate\nfor all integers from - 31 to + 31 . To prevent overflow in the output stream, scaling\nis done by shifting the input or output or\nboth one or more bits; that is, dividing by a\npower of 2. In the internal chip data paths,\n17 bits are used so that 12 significant bits\xc2\xb7\nwill remain in the output even when an internal operation may require the subtraction of nearly equal quantities.\nSigned arithmetic is done by using the\nones complement of each picture-element\nvalue that is to be multiplied by a negative\nweight.

This\ncode enables the correction of up to 16 erroneous information symbols per word.\nThe Berlekamp algorithm is based on a\ncode-generating polynomial with 32 roots\nthat occur in reciprocal pairs. In contrast\n\nwith older RS encoders for long codes,\nthose employing the Berlekamp algorithm\ndo not require lookup tables to multiply two\nelements: Instead, they function only with\nshifting and exclusive-OR operations.\nThe encoder concept is illustrated in the\nfigure.

The\nmirror would be mounted on an object to\nbe grasped, while the light source and detector would be mounted on the manipulator arm (see figure). The sensor would\nmeasure the directions of the returning\nlight beams. From these measurements,\nthe position and orientation of the mirror\nwould be determined.\nThe mirror would be a composite of a\ncorner-cube reflector and plane reflectors.\nThe sensor would consist of a lens and a\ndetector in a package about 2 cm in diameter and 3 cm long. The detector, a silicon\nphotovoltaic cell , would be divided into\nquadrants by etching through the junction\nlayer. An output signal would be brought\nout by a lead from each quadrant. The lens\nwould focus the incoming light onto a small\nspot on the detector.\nThe light source would consist of three\nlight-emitting diodes, each pulsed in turn\nso that the origin of the reflected light being\nsensed at a particular instant could be\nidentified. The position of the light spot on\nthe sensor and therefore the proportions of\nthe Signals from the four sensor quadrants\nwould thus depend on which light-emitting\ndiode is being pulsed and upon the orientation and position of the mirror.\nWith this pulsating and quadrant-sensing\nscheme, the light source/sensor would\nproduce a total of six independent analog\noutputs. From the previously known geometric relationships among the lightemitting diodes, mirror facets, sensor components, and light beams, a microprocessor\nwould turn these six outputs into the six\n68\n\nspatial coordinates that describe the relative position and orientation of the mirror.\nIn the remote-manipulator application\n\n(see figure), the geometrical relationships\nbetween the object to be grasped and the\nmanipulator must also be known in ad-\n\nEnd\nEffector of\nManipulator\n\nObject To\nBe Grasped\n\nGrasping Becomes Automatic when the sensor begins to receive a signal from a reflector\non the object to be manipulated.

Once having sensed the position\nand orientation of the object, the microprocessor would move the manipulator to\nthe object.

The\nsensor output would drive the manipulator\nin such a way that the components of the\n\nsensor output would approach a null. The\neffector fingers would then be closed automatically, and control would be returned to\nthe operator.\nThe proposed scheme will be especially\nuseful when the manipulator arm tends to\nflex or when the object is moving. The\nsensor and microprocessor can be designed to compensate for manipulator-arm\noscillation.\nThis work was done by Alan R. Johnston\n\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The term\n"single-event upset" denotes a variety of\ntemporary or permanent bit flips or latchup\ninduced by single particles of ionizing radiation - such as appear in galactic cosmic\nrays or trapped radiation belts around\nsome planets. In the tests, operating devices are irradiated with ion beams of\nknown kinetic energy and flux density,\nwhile the devices are monitored for upsets.\nThe techniques are applicable to logic and\nmemory devices (random-access memories, microprocessors, and gate arrays, for\nexample) that may be vulnerable to this\ntype of radiation .\nWhile natural radioactive sources are of\nsome value, cyclotrons and Van de Graaff\ngenerators offer the advantages of selectability of ion species and adjustability of energy and particle flux. In addition to the devices under test (delidded to permit beam\npenetration), the equipment that must be\nbrought to the ion-beam facility includes\nthe following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vacuum chamber;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Beam-energy-measuring system;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Beam-flux-measuring system;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Beam-uniformity-measuring system;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Circuit cards to mount the devices under\ntest;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Electromechanical positioner to move\nthe circuit cards and devices; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An electronic testing system to exercise\nthe device and record upsets.\nThe vacuum chamber is connected to\nthe ion accelerator through the port that\nadmits the ion beam (see figure) and is\npumped down to a pressure of 10-5 torr.

Angular data\ncan be used to determine whether the\nbeam linear energy transfer (LET) is near\nthe threshold LET of the device (large increase in the number of upsets with increasing angle) or whether the beam has a\nrange that is limited in comparison with the\ndevice dimensions (large decrease in the\nnumber of upsets with increasing angle).\nA scintillation foil and photomultiplier detect the passage of individual ions to meas-\n\nure tre beam flux. A solid-state detector\nbehind the device under test measures the\nbeam energy. (A radioactive source can be\nslid into and out of place to calibrate this\ndetector.) The beam uniformity is measured by a movable surface-barrier detector (not shown) mounted above the test\ncard.\nThe complexity and cost of an ion-beam\nfacility require an efficient combination of\npretest and onsite preparation as well as a\nflexible approach to beam selection based\n\non experimental data. In addition, certain\nstandards for recording the data are described in order to satisfy the needs of\nmany different potential users.\nThis work was done by Donald K.\nNichols, William E.

A\nmajor benefit of the method is that the user\ncan distinguish between the delay along\nthe primary signal path and the delays\nalong the multiple-reflection signal paths\n(multipaths), so that multipath errors can\nbe minimized or made insignificant in the\ncalibration of antenna delays. Large\nCassegrain microwave antennas thus calibrated can measure the ranges of objects\nvery accurately and can be synchronized\nmore precisely with other antennas for\nvery-long-baseline interferometry.\nPreviously, a horn transmitter on an antenna dish generated a signal, and the time\n\nfor the signal to reach the receiving horn at\nthe antenna focal point was measured by a\nconventional phase-slope or amplitudemodulation technique. A major deficiency\nof this method was that the pattern of the\ntransmitting horn often had poor directivity\nand large side lobes. The calibration signal\ntherefore followed not only a direct path to\nthe receiving horn, but also other paths\nbecause of unintentional illumination of the\nstruts and sides of the receiving-horn\nhousing.\nIn the il"T\'proved technique, the instrument\nis a fault locator, a frequency-modulated\nradar system that can be operated at any\ncenter frequency in the microwave range\nfrom 1.7 to 12.4 GHz with sweep bandwidths ranging from 40 to 100 MHz. Ordinarily, the instrument is used to locate dis-\n\ncontinuities in microwave transmission\nlines and measure the magnitudes of return losses as functions of the distances to\nthe discontinuities. For the antenna measurements, the instrument was modified to\noperate in a one-way, transmission-only\nmode instead of its normal two-way, radar\nmode.\nThe principle of the operation is illustrated in Figure 1. The oscillator frequency\nis swept in a sawtooth pattern while the oscillator output is fed to a transmitting antenna and a receiving mixer. The mixer output\nis fed to a narrow-bandwidth IF amplifier,\ndetected, and recorded. Since the frequency of the transmitted Signal varies with\ntime, the delay between the transmitted and\nreceived signals can be determined from\nthe frequency differences between them.\n\nOscillator\nTransmitting\nAntenna\n\nFO\n\nReceiving\nAntenna\n\n+AF\n\nSawtooth\nGenerator\n\nDistance\xc2\xb7\nI-+--------------.....,.~Recorder\n\nOutput\n\n-AF\nf----\n\nT\n\n------l.1\n\nGain Controls\n- - Transmitted Signal\n- - - Received Signal\nIF Amplifier\n\nRecorder\nOutput\n\nFigure 1.

Then the distance dial is adjusted manually to move the recorder pen\nto the positions of peak response on the recording and noting the corresponding distance readings on the instrument. The distance values are then converted to time\ndelays.

The control solves\nthe unique problems encountered with the\nprecipitators in this application.\nThe electrostatic precipitators remove\nthe particulate matter from the smoke created by the burning refuse. \'ihe smoke is\nexposed to an electrostatic field, and the\nparticles become electrically charged and\nmigrate to the electricall} charged collecting surfaces.\nTo maximize particle collection, a precipitator should be operated at the highest\npractical field potential to increase both the\nparticle charge and the electrostatic collection field. However, the maximum field\npotential at which the precipitator can 0perate is limited by sparking and arcing\n(electrical breakdown), which, if not controlled, can damage the precipitator and\ncontrol system.\nWhen the same type of fuel is burned\ncontinuously and the combustion is held\nrelatively constant, the smoke is of a constant composition, and the magnitude of\nthe electrostatic field for maximum particulate collection can be fairly constant. However, when refuse is burned or there are\nchanges in the combustion, the composition of the smoke changes, requiring corresponding changes in the magnitude of the\nelectrostatic field. Therefore, the point of\nmaximum particulate collection cannot be\nheld constant and an electronic control\nthat can adjust rapidly to varying fuel and\ncombustion is necessary to maintain precipitator efficiency.\nThe new microprocessor-base<j electronic control maintains the precipitator\npower at the maximum particulate-collection\n76\n\nlevel. The control automatically senses\nchanges in the smoke composition due to\nvariations in fuel or combustion and adjusts the precipitator voltage and current\naccordingly. Also, sensitive yet stable fault\ndetection is provided.\nA constant spark rate and setback are\nselected by the operator. Thereafter, the\nprecipitator operation is fully automatic, requiring no further operator input.\nPower is applied to the electrostatic preCipitator in a series of ramps. At startup, the\npower level is increased aJ a fixed rate until\nthe occurrence of the first spark or electrical breakdown in the gas stream. At this\npoint, the control removes all power from\nthe precipitator for a timed interval to allow\nthe spark to extinguish.\nPower is then reapplied over a timed interval at a rate called "fast ramp." The fast\nramp quickly brings the power level back to\na setback point that is proportionally lower\nthan the spark level. The setback point and\nrate of rise of the fast ramp are calculated\nby the control from the varying spark level\nand the amount of setback desired (operator control).\nPower is then increased at a rate called\n"slow ramp." The slow ramp searches for\nthe new spark level. The rate of rise of the\nslow ramp is calculated by the control from\nthe spark level and the number of sparks\nper minute desired (operator control). This\nsequence continues unless the spark level\nexceeds the current limit. Once the current\nlimit is reached, the slow ramp stops climbing. Once another spark occurs, the ramp\nsequence is repeated. If the spark level is\nbelow the current limit, the number of\nsparks per minute will be the value selected independent of variations in fuel or\ncombustion. This results in the maximum\nparticulate collection possible for a given\nprecipitator.\n\nFor precipitator/control protection, the\nprimary ac current and voltage are sensed\nby the control , and the root mean square\n(rms) value of each is derived. This arrangement is used because each of these\nwaveforms contains switching transients\nand.spikes due to the switching action of\nthe power silicon-controlled rectifiers and\nthe dynamic impedance characteristics of\nthe precipitator and its transformer/rectifier. The rms values of primary current and\nvoltage are then compared; if an imbalance is found between them, a faulty condition is declared, and line power is removed from the precipitator.\nAlthough the new microprocessor-based\nelectronic control solves the problems encountered with electrostatic precipitators\nin refuse-burning applications, its features\nare applicable to any precipitator used with\nany fuel. True malfunctions are detected,\nyet the control does not needlessly shut\ndown the operation. All calibration adjustments can be preset before installation,\nand no normal maintenance or field calibration is required. Major modifications of\ncontrol parameters can be accomplished\nby reprograming a plug-in electrically programable read-only memory. The control\ncan be applied in new facilities or in present precipitators as a retrofit package and\ncan be tailored to any electrostatic-precipitator application.\nThis work was done by David F.\nJohnston of Langley Research Center.\nFor further information, Circle 52 on the\nTSP Request Card.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to the Patent Counsel, Lang/ey\nResearch Center [see page 29].

The circuit would\nalso be able to expand or shrink pixel regions. The circuit concept was developed\nfor the image-processing computer described in the preceding articles. The circuit handles a data stream of 12-bit pixels\nrather than the conventional 8 or 16 bits.\nThe circuit would consist entirely of stand\xc2\xb7\nard logic chips.\nThe circuit (see figure) stores two consecutive scan lines in line buffers. It performs a raster-to-window conversion with\nnine latches, thereby producing the nine\npixel values of a 3-by-3-pixel window. The\ncenter pixel is compared with a programable constant\xc2\xb7threshold value, and its eight\nneighbors are compared with the center\npixel or with the threshold. The outputs\nfrom the comparators form a representation of the greater-than, equal-to, or lessthan relationships of the pixels in a 9-bit number. Two bits are appended to this value to\nindicate whether the center pixel number\nalong its scan line is odd or even and\nwhether the number of the scan line for that\npixel is odd or evert The resutting 11-bit number is used to address a 2K-by-14-bit memory that has been programed to produce\ntwo numbers in response to the input; an\narbitrary 12-bit number from the memory\ntable and a 2-bit number that. depending\n\nBit\xc2\xb7Wlse\nLogical\nEight\n12-81t\nPixels\n\n12 Bits\n\nOR\n\n2 Bits\nNine\n9 Bits\nTable\nLookup\nComparators ~=+f\n(>, = , <)\n(11 Bits In,\n12 Bits\n14 Bits Out) ~==--+f Selector\n\nFixed\nThreshold\n\n12-81t\nOutput\n\nCenter\nPixel\n\n2-Bit Odd/Even\nInformation\nFrom Pixel\nand Line Clock\n\nThe Neighborhood Comparison Circuit examines relationships between adjacent pixels.\nFrom data in a lookup table, it produces a 12-bit number representing the relationship and\nthereby can identify ridges, peaks, and valleys.\n\non the input number, directs the selector to\nchoose as its 12-bit output the number\nfrom the table, the center pixel value, or a\nbit -wise logical OR derived from the eight\nneighbors of the center pixel.\nWhen two\'s-complement representation is used and signed data are compared,\nthe most significant bit (the sign bit) is first\ninverted. This procedure makes positive\nnumbers (for which the sign bit is zero)\ncompare as greater than negative numbers (for which the sign bit is 1).\nInformation about the oddness or evenness of the pixel position is included in the\nlookup table input so that subfields can be\n\nimplemented. The two odd-or-even bits allow four subfields to be defined, with different operations for each. This ensures that\na line expressed as binary data is not lost if\nit is thinned to the width of a single pixel.\n\nThis work was done by Donald B.\nGennery of Caitech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The processor would do feature extraction, smoothing, edge detection, texture measurement,\nand stereoscopic area correlation. It would\nalso plan routes for obstacle avoidance by\nrobots and would solve two-dimensional\npartial differential equations.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nParallel proceSSing would be used to\nachieve the necessary speed for processing image data. In contrast with generalpurpose computers, no time would be\nspent to repeatedly decode instructions\nduring processing because the same operations would be performed repeatedly on\nthe image data.\nIn the pipelined-image approach, the\n\nsystem performs more than one arithmetic\noperation at a time on each picture element. Some operations are also performed simultaneously on corresponding\nelements in parallel data paths. The data\nwould pass through the pipeline processor\nat the video-scanning rate On most cases).\nThe processor consists of identical programable computing modules (see figure,\n77\n\nleft) interconnected in a two-dimensional\nprogramable arrangement. Each module,\ntypically occupying one circuit card, contains binary arithmetic operators that use\nlookup tables. The module also includes\nconvolvers and neighborhood comparison\noperators that perform such operations as\nfinding local extrema, zero crossings, and\ndirectional extrema.\nThe processor receives image data as\nthey emerge from external buffers or, more\ndirectly, from television cameras through\nanalog-to-digital converters. The results of\nthe computations are fed into the same or\nother image buffers. The delays caused by\nprecessing are taken into account by the\ncircuit that reloads the buffers.\nA flexible scheme is used to direct the\nflow of data to subsequent stages of the\npipeline. For example, if a stage consists of\na column of synchronized modules, the interconnection network enables the output\n~ of a module in a given row and column to\n. . . . be sent to any or all of a designated set of\n~ rows in the next column (see figure, right).\nThe concept has been worked out for an\ninitial version of the processor, which is expected to process imagery of about 2,OOJ picture elements per line at 8 x 106 picture\nelements per second using 12-bit arithmetic. The processor would be programed by\na commercial host computer through a\ndirect-memory-access (OMA) interface.\nEach binary function (which uses a\nquarter-megabyte lookup table) should be\n\nColumn n+ 1\n\nNeighborhood\nComparison\nOperator\n\nA\n\nInputs\n\nF\nB\nInputs\n\nAI\n\nBI\n\nAC\n\nBC\nF\n\n.\n\nselector\n\nA\n\nOutput\n\nB\nOutput\n\nN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Includes Appropriate Delays\n\nThe Image Processor would consist of modular units (left), each of which includes a set of\ncomputing elements of the types that are particularly useful in pipelined-image processing.

The lookup table for each neighborhood comparison operator would be\nsimilarly programed in a 2K OMA transfer.\nThe convolution weights, input selection,\nand other programing data would be inserted in an 80-word OMA burst for each\nmodule needing reprograming .\n\nThis work was done by Donald B.\nGennery and Brian Wilcox of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion laboratory.

The concept was developed\nfor the programable image-feature extractor described in the preceding article.\nThe eight most Significant bits of two\n12-bit input-function arguments, A and B,\nare used to address the 64K-by-32-bit lookup\ntable (see figure). The four least significant\nbits in the input are directed to separate\nmJltipliers and used to interr:x:Jiate between the\n~-tabIe values. Twelve of the 32 tabIeoutput bits represent the value of the function at each of the 64K values stored in the\ntable. The remaining 20 bits represent the\ninterpolation slopes for arguments A and B.\n78\n\nThe Basic Elements of the Function Generator are memory chips and an interJjolator\nchip, which incorporates multipliers and adders. The memory includes CMOS static\nrandom-access devices. The 120 ns cycle time of these devices allows real-time processIng of image data.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nThe interpolator multiplies each slope by\nthe four least significant bits of the appropriate function argument and adds the two\nproducts. It discards the four least significant bits of the product sum and adds the\nremaining bits to the 12-bit function value\nlooked up in the table to produce the final\ninterpolated output.\nA 32-bit-wide table was chosen because\nit accommodates the 12-bit word length of\nthe system and still allows sufficient bits to\ndescribe the slopes over a wide range. The\nslopes can take positive or negative values\nfrom as low as 1/16 to as high as 32.\nThis work was done by Donald B.\nGennery and Brian Wilcox of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Two key problems\nsolved by AESOP are the linear quadratic\nregulator (LOR) design problem and the\nsteady-state Kalman filter design problem.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nAESOP is interactive. The user can\nsolve design problems and analyze the s0lutions in a single interactive session. Both\nnumerical and graphical information are\navailable to the user during the session.\nThe AESOP program is structured\naround a list of predefined functions. Each\nfunction performs a single computation associated with control, estimation, or system response determination. AESOP contains over 60 functions and permits the\neasy inclusion of user-defined functions.\nThe user obtains access to these functions\neither by inserting a list of desired functions\nin the order they are to be performed or by\nspecifying a single function to be performed. The latter case is used when the\nchoice of function and function order depends on the results of previous functions.\nThe available AESOP functions are divided into several general areas including\n(1) program control , (2) matrix input and revision, (3) matrix formation , (4) open-loop\nsystem analysis, (5) frequency response,\n(6) transient response, (7) transient function zeros, (8) LOR and Kalman filter design, (9) eigenvalues and eigenvectors, (10)\ncovariances, and (11) user-defined functions. The most important functions are\nthose that design linear quadratic regulators and Kalman filters. The user interacts\nwith AESOP when using these functions by\n\ninputting design weighting parameters and\nby viewing displays of designed system response. Support functions obtain system\ntransient and frequency responses, transfer functions, and covariance matrices.\nAESOP can also provide the user with\nopen-loop system information including\nstability, controllability, and observability.\nThe AESOP program is written in FORTRAN IV for interactive execution and has\nbeen implemented on an IBM 3033 computer using TSS 370. As currently configured, AESOP has a central-memory requirement of approximately 2M 8-bit bytes.\nMemory requirements can be reduced by\nredimensioning arrays in the AESOP program. Graphical output requires adaptation of the AESOP plot routines to whatever\ndevice is available.

By this method\nmuch sharper pictures can be\nobtained than was previously\npossible.\n\nOther Applications\nPhase retrieval algorithms are\nalso being used at ERIM to solve\nother problems, including\nsensing wavefronts for laser\napplications, producing\ndiffraction -limited images from\nimperfect optical systems, and,\nwith coherent light, possibly\neven producing images using no\nlenses at all.\nResearch in phase retrieval\nincludes analytical study of the\nuniqueness of the solution,\nanalyses of the sensitivity of\nimage quality to noise,\nimprovement of the convergence\nand robustness of reconstruc tion algorithms, and optical\nlaboratory experiments for\nfurther proof of concept.\nERIM is a leader in advancing the\nstate of the art in a number of\nareas in optics . Phase retrieval is\none example . Others include 3dimensional imaging sensors,\noptical computing, diffractive\noptics, and holography.\nThe Environmental Research\n\nInstitute of Michigan (ERIM) is a\nnon-profit scientific research\ninstitute that performs contract\nresearch services for a variety of\nsponsor!:>.

Projecting into\nthe outlet of this jet is the end of another\ntube, jet 2, which dips below the surface of\na scrubbing liquid in a small reservoir. The\nvelocity of the gas flowing past the end of\njet 2 creates a partial vacuum that draws\nscrubbing liquid up the tube. When this liquid spills out into the gas stream, it is atomized or broken up into very small droplets.\nThe fine spray formed by these droplets\nfills the chamber of the device, where intimate contact is made between the droplets and gaseous molecules.\nFor soluble gases, phase transfer occurs. The gaseous molecules of highly soluble constituents are collected in the droplets. The droplets of liquid impinge against\na porous hydrophobic membrane, which is\nsupported by a conical screen, where they\ncoalesce into drops large enough to roll off\nthe apex of the cone and return to the\nscrUbbing-liquid reservoir. Although the hydrophobic membrane virtually blocks all\ntransport of droplets, it offers little resistance to gas flow; hence, the device permits relatively large volumes of gas to be\nscrubbed efficiently with very small volumes of liquid. This means that analyzable\nquantities of contaminants can be concentrated" in extracting solutions in much\nshorter times than with conventional\ntechniques.\nThe hydrophobic membrane was made\nby shaping a commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene filter having a 1-I-lmdiameter pore size around a wire screen\ncone, which is used for structural support.\nThe shaped filter efficiently passes the\nvapor phase while almost completely repelling aqueous droplets. The droplets are\nsubsequently dropped into the scrubbingliquid reservoir to be recycled.

The system includes\na tracking mirror that is tilted by stepping\nmotors under microprocessor control to\ndeflect the beams toward the continually\nchanging reflector position.\nThe tracking system is part of a balloonborne infrared laser spectrometer that\nmeasures the composition of the upper atmosphere at altitudes of about 25 to 40 km.\nTo reduce the effects of outgassing from\nthe balloon and gondola, the spectrometer\nmeasures infrared absorption over a path\nto and from a reflector hanging as much as\nSOO m below the gondola. Most of this\n1,OOO-m path is far enough away that the\neffects of outgassing from objects adjacent to the instrument are negligible.\nThe suspended reflector swings like a\npendulum below the instrument gondola.\nThe tracking system, mounted in the gondola, uses a visible light beam from a helium/neon laser, distinct from the spectrometer beam from an infrared laser. The\nbeam is directed to the reflector by mirrors\nand lenses (see figure) and broadens to a\nspot of 2 m diameter at the distance of 500 m.\nThe reflector diameter is 14 cm. The axis of\nthe spectrometer beam is maintained in a\nfixed orientation relative to that of the tracking beam. The tracking beam returned by\nthe reflector to the gondola is projected on\nan array of light sensors in a television\ncamera, and the camera output is fed to\nthe microprocessor and controller.\nIn the first stage of tracking, the controller, under direction of the microprocessor, moves the tracking mirror so that\nthe visible laser beam traces a spiral pattern at the reflector distance. As soon as\nthe spiral scan picks up a glint from the reflected, visible tracking beam, the microprocessor moves the tracking mirror to\nposition the glint at the center of a 32-by32-picture-element central section of the\n64,OOO-element camera array.\nEvery 0.05 s, the microprocessor updates the position of the glint with respect\nto the center of the array and computes a\nnew scanning velocity that will move the\ntracking mirror in synchronism with any\nmotion of the reflector. When tracking is\nfully maintained, the microprocessor turns\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nHeiNe Visible\nTracking Laser\n\nInfrared\nSpectrometer\nBeam\nTransmitted\nVisible\nTracking\nBeam\n\n---..--\n\nTelescope\n\n500\xc2\xb7m Path\nReflected Tracking\nand Spectrometer\nBeams\n\nIT"-\n\nt -_\n\nTransmitted Spectrometer\nBeam (Expanded Over\nthe 5OO-m Distance)\nTransmitted Tracking\nBeam (Expanded Over\nthe 5OO\xc2\xb7m Distance)\nSuspended\nRetroreflector\n\nA Motor-Driven Tracking Mirror directs the visible tracking beam and the infrared spectrometer beam toward the reflector.

At\nthe same time, the microprocessor monitors the infrared beam reflected to the\nspectrometer receMng telescope.

Previously,\nit was necessary to i<n<JN the surface temperature profile to make such calculations.\nThe new theory was developed as an\naid in research on the growth of mercury\ncadmium telluride for infrared detectors. In\nparticular, it is applicable to BridgmanStockbarger growth, in which a round cylindrical ampoule of the molten ternary\nsemiconductor is solidified directionally,\nfrom one end to the other.\nSimplifying assumptions are made for\npurposes of developing the mathematical\nsolution: The cylinder is treated as being infinitely long, with constant thermal conductivity and specific heat, and without internal\nheat sources or sinks. In the steady state,\nthe temperature field satisfies Laplace\'s\nequation.\nThe temperature is assumed to be expressible as a dual power series. USing the\ncustomary solution technique, the powerseries coefficients are related to each\nuther by recursion relations derived by inserting the power series into Laplace\'s\nequation.\nIf the temperature T(b,z) is known as a _\nfunction of axial position z along a line of\nconstant radius r = b, this temperature\nprofile can be used to determine some of\nthe coefficients. The remaining coefficients are then determined from the recursion relations, thereby enabling the subsequent calculation of temperature T(r,z) at\nany position in the rod. For example, the\ntemperature T(O,z) could be measured\nalong the axis and the coefficients thereby\nobtained used to calculate T(r,z).\nTo test the theory, temperature measurements were taken along an axial hole in\nan alumina rod. The rod was placed in a\nfurnace (see figure) with hot and cold\nzones separated by an adiabatic zone. Although difficulties were encountered in fitting the theory to the experimental curves\naccurately, the calculated temperature\nprofiles and isotherm locations agreed\nqualitatively with the behavior that basic\nphysical principles would lead one to\nexpect.\nOnly in determining radial temperature\ngradients did the theory present real difficulties. The isotherms were nearly flat\n84\n\nAlumina\nRod\n\nHot-Zone\nHeat Pipe\n\nHot-Zone\nFurnace\n\nThermocouple\nAdiabatic\nZone\n\nFlber- Blanket\nInsulation\n\nCold-Zone\nHeat Pipe\n\nCold-Zone\nFurnace\nFirebrick\nInsulation\n\nThis Furnace was used to obtain the axial temperature profile of a rod of alumina.

The magnetic field applied to the\ndissociator could range from 0 to 600 G, in\xc2\xb7\ncreasing the overa ll efficiency of the\nsource by 10 to 200 percent. The degree of\nenhancement depends upon the field\nstrength; for example, 230 G results in one\nof the higher peaks of polarized atom\nproduction.\nThe hexapole focusing magnet preferentially selects atoms in the desired state.\nThe combination of the hexapole magnet\nand the dissociator with the applied magnetic field increases the number of desired\natoms by a factor of 60 to 70, as compared\nto the combination of the hexapole magnet\nand a dissociator without the applied field.\nThe source could be built with permanent\nmagnets or electromagnets.

Similar agreement can be expected\nfor all other hydrocarbons. The technique\nis based on the Nernst theorem for matching the partial pressure of oxygen in the\ncombustion product gases with that in normal air. It is simple, quick, and relatively\nsafe , particularly for toxic/poisonous\nhydrocarbons.\nMost current mass flowmeters for gaseous media depend on the thermal properties of the test gases. They are normally\ncalibrated for air and then used for other\ngases by means of either a theoretical con90\n\nversion factor or an empirical factor provided by the manufacturer. Since the theoretical conversion factors of many gases of\ninterest, such as H2 , N2 , O2 , CO, CO 2 ,\nCCI 2F2, and hydrocarbon (CxHy), do not\nagree with the experimental values, it is\noften necessary to determine their calibration conversion factors experimentally.\nThis is particularly true for most of the hydrocarbons. Even though the process of\ncalibrating mass flowmeters for hydrocarbons is not complicated, their conversion\nfactors often are not available, particularly\nwhen the gases involved are rare or toxic.\nAny scheme that permits in situ measurements of conversion factors for all hydrocarbons would thus be of great interest to\ncombustion chemists and others interested in synthetiC fuel development.\nThe figure shows the experimental setup used for equalizing partial pressures of\noxygen in the test gas and the calibration\n\nair. Typically, the hydrocarbon under test\nwould be burnt in oxygen-enriched air in a\nwell-stirred combustor to ensure complete\ncombustion. A fraction of the combustion\nproducts would be passed through the\noxygen-partial-pressure monitor. For a particular dial setting of the hydrocarbon flowmeter, the oxygen flow rate would be adjusted to make the oxygen partial pressure\nin the combustion products the same as in\nthe calibration air. This condition would be\nsignaled by the production of the same cell\noutput as is obtained when calibration air is\nused as the test gas. The hydrocarbon\nflowmeter conversion factor, F, would then\nbe given by:\nOxygen Flow Rate\nF=\nHydrocarbon\n(!!:!)Hydrocarbon x ( Flow Rate on Dial)\nn\nwhere m is the oxygen flow rate and n is the\nhydrocarbon flow rate.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nAir\n(Calibration)\nSolenoid\nValve 1\n\nHeater Tape\n\nVariable\nTransformer\n\nOxygen-Sensor\nDisk\n\nVariable\nTransformer\n\n):::==--\n\nSolenoid\nValve 2\n\nPump\n\nr ---:. _ _ Reference\nGas (Air)\n\nHeater Tape\nOxygen-Sensor\nControl (Readout)\n\no\n\nF = Flowmeter\n\nThe Oxygen Partial Pressure in hydrocarbon-combustion-product gases is monitored in this experimental arrangement.\n\nTyp;cal ,esulls ob!a;ned w;u, methane\nand acetylene test gases are in good\nagreement with the empirical values listed\nby the flowmeter manufacturer.

Vo1.8,\nNO. 4 (Summer 1984). The new spectrometer also differs from the older one in that the\nOA-to-2.5-lim passband is now divided into\ntwo subbands at 1 lim.\nRadiation from the scene strikes a reflecting Schmidt corrector plate located\nnear the center of curvature of the primal\'y\nspherical mirror (see figure). The reflected\nradiation illuminates the upper portion of\nthe primary mirror and forms an image at\nits focal surface. A reflecting slit at the primary focal surface acts as a field stop and\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nserves as the entrance slit for the spectrometer section of the instrument.\nThe primary mirror collimates the radiation rflflected by the slit and directs it toward a dichroic beam splitter, which separates the beam into the two wavelength\nbands. Separate dispersing prisms and\ncorrector-plate/mirrors are used for each\nwavelength band.\nPlacing the correction-plate mirrors in\nthe two beams at slightly different angles\nfrom the optical axes separates the two\nwavelength-dispersed images formed by\nthe rays returning to the focal surface of\nthe primary mirror. This image separation\nmakes it possible to use a different chargecoupled-device detector array for each\nband without any gap in wavelength cover-\n\nage. Handling the two bands separately\nimproves dispersion linearity.\nThe revised performance specifications\nof the spectrometer include spectral resolutions of 10 nm in the visiblelnear infrared\nsubband (to detect subtle changes in vegetation color) and 20 nm in the remaining infrared subband. The revised design includes two adjustable steering mirrors so\nthat the field of view of the instrument can\nbe aimed up to 45\xc2\xb0 forward or backward\nalong one axis (along the groundtrack if the\nspectrometer is flown) and up to 20\xc2\xb0 to\neither side of this axis (across the groundtrack if the spectrometer is flown). The aim\nis adjustable in 1\xc2\xb0 increments in each\ndirection.\nTo maintain accurate alinement, the\n91\n\n.~\n\nI\n\nmain optical system and the supporting\nstructure for the two aiming mirrors are all\nmounted to the top plate of the instrument\nhousing. The mirror that controls the aim\nalong the groundtrack also doubles as a\nprotective cover and, in the closed position, directs the instrument field of view to a\nspectral-line source for calibration.\nThe electronics and the detector cooler\nare located on the instrument baseplate;\nthey are cooled by an external refrigerator\nto 120 K. This arrangement isolates the\ncritical optical components from the heatproducing electronics and from the vibration of the cooler.\nThe optical parameters of the spectometer include a primary-mirror focal length\nof 416 mm and an effective circularaperture diameter of 11 cm (with a consequent focal ratio of f/3.8). The field of view is\n2.8\xc2\xb0. The signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument varies from about 100 to about 1,000\nover most of the spectral region of interest.\nThe raw-data reacbut rate is 103 X 106 b/s.\nFour simple editing modes reduce the rate\ntoorbelow50 X 106 b/s.Theseincludethe\nselection of any subset of 128 spectral\nbands, the averaging of any contiguous set\nof up to four bands, the spatial averaging of\nany group of up to four contiguous picture\nelements, and the reduction of spatial\ncoverage in increments of one picture\nelement.\n\nThis work was done by John B. l/1Ie/lman,\nAlexander F.

Tests indicate that the technique provides accurate (better than \xc2\xb1 10 percent) information\nabout the residual fluid content in sealed\nvessels.\nThe new method was originally devel92\n\noped for use on spacecraft, where the\nabsence of gravity causes a fluid to become distributed throughout the interior of\nits container.

If a cell is designated to\ncontain fluid, the electron density (and thus\nthe scattering properties) for that cell is assigned a value correS/X>nding to the fluid.\nAll cells are initially aSSigned an electron\ndensity value corresponding to air.\nThe program generates formatted output on two files.

The hybrid\nconcept was originally developed for optical communication over interplanetary distances. In space or on Earth. it would allow\ndigital transmission at data rates of several\nmegabits per second with a reasonably\nsized optical aperture of 20 cm.\nBy itself, a GaAs laser proouces only a\nfew tens of milliwatts of power with relatively low coherence and spectral purity. A\nNd:YAG laser. on the other hand. is difficult\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nto pump efficiently (an efficiency of only\nabout 0.1 percent is typical). A combination\nof the devices. howev.er, would allow efficient pumping and would yield 1 War more\nof optical power at an overall efficiency of\nabout 10 percent.\nThe light from two or more GaAs lasers\nwould be focused to small S/X>ts on the\nends of a Nd:YAG rod (see figure). The\nGaAs beams, at a wavelength of 0.81iJm,\nstimulate the Nd:YAG laser to emit light at\n1.06iJm. Wrth a suitable choice of focusing\noptics, the GaAs S/X>ts can be varied from\n50 to 100 I-Im in diameter to coincide with\nthe diameter of the resonant volume of the\n\nYAG rod . Moreover, the GaAs beams\nwould penetrate deeply into the rod: The\nNd:YAG crystal is highly absorbent to light\nat the GaAs wavelength. The end-pumping\nconfiguration thus allows (he Nd:YAG laser\nto make maximum use of the energy from\nthe GaAs lasers.\nThis is in contrast to a conventional sidepumping configuration in which GaAs\nlasers are arrayed along the length of the\nNd:YAG roo. Much of the light from the\nGaAs passes through the rod without being\nabsorbed in the resonant volume. As a result, a maximum efficiency of only about\n0.5 percent is possible with side pumping.\n\n93\n\nSeparating Mirror:\nHighly Reflective at 106 lIm\nTransmissive at 0.81 ,.m\n\nFocusing\n\nGaAs\n\nGaAs\n\nat 1.06"m,\nTransmissive\nat 0.81 lIm\n\nat 1.06"m,\nTransmissive\nat 0.81 lIm\n\nThe beams from Two GaAs lasers are efficiently coupled for pumping a Nd:YAG crystal. The combination of lasers exploits the best features of each.\n\nExtremely small optical elements can\nbe used to collect and deliver the pump\nlight, and the size and weight of the system\nwould therefore be small. The separation\nbetween mirrors in the laser resonator\nwould be 5 cm, and the mirrors would have\na radius of curvature of 5 cm.\n\nThe distortion fran temperature-induced\nchanges in the index of refraction of the\nNd:YAG crystal is expected to be minimal,\neven though the pumping intensity will be\nabout 10 kW/cm 2. Such effects as thermal\n"lensing," in which radial thermal gradients give the rod a lenslike distortion, and\n\nthermal birefringence, in which thermal\nstress tends to depolarize the light beam,\nshould be negligible.\nThis work was done by Donald L.

NPO-16173\n\nWedged Fibers Suppress Feedback of Laser Beam\nAn improved optical fiber has a beveled output end and\na wedged input end to reduce optical feedback losses.\n\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nWhen an injected laser is coupled into\nan optical fiber, emission instabilities arise\nbecause of optical feedback losses from\nthe fiber into the laser. Coupling efficiencies as high as 80 percent, however, have\nbeen obtained by shaping the end of a multimode fiber into an obtuse-angled wedge.\nBecause the slanted sides eliminate the\nback reflection, such a wedged fiber can\nachieve high coupling efficiency. The relation (see Figure 1) between the fiber acceptance half angle and the wedge angle\nin a typical wedge-ended fiber is given by:\n= sin\xc2\xb71{n~in[+ + cos\xc2\xb71(n~n 1)]} - +\n\ne\n\nIn order to investigate the ability of the\nwedged fiber to suppress optical feedback,\na laser was mounted on a temperaturestabilized block and operated at a constant\ncurrent with an output of about 3 mW. After\nthe spectrum was recorded, a wedged\nfiber was interposed between the laser and\nthe spectrometer, and the spectrum was\nagain recorded. The two spectra were in\nclose agreement. The advantage of the\nwedge, however, can be lost if there is in94\n\nshould be avoided too close to the critical\nangle where reflectivity rises steeply above\n4 percent. Most of the fiber terminations in\nthis work had angles in the 50\xc2\xb0 to 55\xc2\xb0\nrange, the bevel angle for total internal reflection being approximately 4r. The output beam with such terminations is inclined\ntoward the bevel, and the angle d between\nthe beam direction and the fiber axis is\ngiven by:\nd = sin\xc2\xb71(n1 sine) -\n\ne\n\nFigure 1.

These reflections can be eliminated\nwith a beveled output end (see Figure 2).\nThe bevel angle w must satisfy the inequality:\n90\xc2\xb0 - sin\xc2\xb71(1/n1)< w< 90\xc2\xb0 - cos\xc2\xb71 (n~n1)\nIt is desirable to use the smallest possible w to increase the attenuation of internally reflected light, but internal reflection\n\nFigure 2. The Output End of the Fiber Is\nBeveled to reduce optical feedback.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nHigh coupling efficiency and feedback\nsuppression can thus be combined by\nshaping the input end of a multimode fiber\ninto a wedge and by beveling the output\nend at a suitable angle. With such fibers,\n\nthe laser is not perturbed, and the spectrum measured at the fiber output is a faithful reproduction of the spectrum measured\nwhen the laser radiates into free space.\nThis work was done by Ivan Ladanyof\n\nRCA Corp. for Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available.\nLAR-13074\n\nDetermining Calibration Constants for Attitude Measurements\nAn algorithm based on the method of least squares\nis programed for a desk-top computer.\n\nLang/ey Research Center,\nHampton, Virginia\nAn algorithm based on the method of\nleast SQuares determines the calibration\nconstants of seismic instruments for precise attitude measurements.

The system\nwas modeled as three lumped masses\nconnected vertically by springs, with the\nlowest mass connected to a horizontal vi\xc2\xb7\nbrator (representing the ground) through\nsprings and a dashpot. The behavior of the\nsprings was described by elastic or elastoplastic forceldeformation relationships.\nThese relationships were used to approxi\xc2\xb7\nmate nonlinear system behavior as well a~\nsoil/foundation\xc2\xb7interface behavior.\nThe study includes a general back\xc2\xb7\nground discussion and review of the literature concerning the use of finite-element\nand lumped\xc2\xb7parameterlimpedance mod\xc2\xb7\nels. A review of seismicity in the Eastern\nUnited States is included. Theoretical con\xc2\xb7\nsiderations for the computer modeling of\nsoil/structure systems are presented,\nalong with a discussion of the capabilities\n(types of problems, input, and output) required of a program to perform such\nmodeling.\nTwo superstructure models, three soilbehavior models, and two soil stiffnesses\nwere examined in various combinations.\nThe simulation was carried out wi1h a FORTRAN computer program called " DYNA,"\nwhich was developed for such lumped\xc2\xb7\nparameterlimpedance models.\nThe analysis was performed in the time\ndomain rather than the frequency domain\nso that behavior parameters could be m0dified more easily during a program run and\nso that the immediate output could be interpreted more readily. Moreover, a time\xc2\xb7\ndomain analysis can simulate nonlinear\neffects directly, rather than base them on\naverage values of deformation. and can\naccount for a sequence of events as they\nactually occur.\n\n97\n\n_\nJ!\n\n2a\n\nSome preliminary conclusions were\ndrawn from the responses of the models to\nharmonic ground accelerations. For the\nsystems examined and a given soil behavior model, an increase in soil stiff\xc2\xb7\nness decreases foundation displacements\nand increases superstructure responses.\nFor a given soil stiffness, the response of\nthe superstructure tends to be greatest\nwhen the soil behavior is elastic and least\nwhen the soil behavior is plastic; that is,\nwhen the foundation wallows. Overall increases of damping in the structure and\nsoil/structure system decrease the peak\ndeformation of the first story and the displacement of the top mass while increasin g th e rotational response of the\nfoundation.\nThe DYNA computer program is expected to be used in future studies. Modifications that would increase the accuracy\nand utility of the program include certain\nelaborations of some of the simple model\nelements, increasing the number of response parameters in the output, and adding the ability to accept recorded seismic\nevents as inputs.

The model evolved from previous ones that were limited to calculating\nthe effects of interdendritic fluid flow on the\nfinal macrosegregation for a given input\n\ntemperature field under the assumption of\nno fluid flow in the bulk melt.\nThe theory incorporates the effects of\nthermally induced convection in the bulk\nmelt and of heat flow throughout the ingot\nin the macrosegregation calculation in the\nsolidlliquid region. The theoretical model\nenables one to calculate the rate of development of the solid and the temperature\ndistribution in the ingot; the only thermal input data required are the heat-transfer c0efficient at the chilled side of the mold and\nthe temperature of the chill.\nDue to subtleties in the nonlinear form of\nthe macrosegregation equations, it was\nnecessary to resort to a new numerical\ntechnique to solve the problem. This technique, called the "discrete-flux method,"\napplies to a broad class of movingboundary problems.\nIn the discrete-flux method, the phYSical\nconservation relations are preserved both\nanalytically and in discrete form. Finitedifference equations simulate the heat\nflow through a discrete computational\nmesh. The resulting discrete form of the\nmoving boundary conditions is explicit.\nThe heat- and mass-flow equations are\nfirst transformed to body-fitted curvilinear\ncoordinates, retaining both the enthalpy\nand the temperature as dependent variables. Conserving finite-difference approximations are then made for each of the interior and boundary coordinates . The\nmovements of the interfaces are then obtained, subject to the conditions that maintain the correct heat-flux relations at the\ninterfaces.\nAn interactive computer program to\nperform these calculations is designed for\nuse by nonprogramers. The user selects\nthe process parameters and the alloy composition and controls the selection of both\ngraphical and tabular output as modeling\nprogresses. The report includes an operating guide, flow charts, and a list of subroutine names and functions, but not the\nsource code.\nAs implemented, the model neglects\nconvection in the bulk liquid (the region\nwhere no solidification has taken place).\nThe report suggests an approach for including a coupling of the convective field in\nthe bulk liquid to the convective field in the\nsolidlliquid zone.\nThis work was done by David R.

(A kinematic engine has pistons connected by\nmechanical linkages to a crankshaft.) The\nprogram computes time-varying piston p0sitions, pressures, and gas temperatures\nin each of the gas-control volumes into\nwhich the engine working space is divided.\nThe engine performance is characterized\nby calculations of power and efficiency\n(both indicated and brake). The inputs to\nthe code are the engine geometrical parameter, engine-operating conditions, and\nindexes that specify various options available. This computer model represents a\ncompromise between other publicly available models that are either less mathematically rigorous and faster or more mathematically rigorous and slower than the\nmodel described here.\nThe model predicts engine performance for a given set of engine-operating\nconditions (i.e., mean pressure, boundary\ntemperatures, and engine speed). Rxed\nheater-tube and coolant-inlet temperatures are assumed; gas physical properties vary with temperature. For the testcase engine, one of the four identical\nengine working spaces is modeled, and\nthe resultant power is multiplied by 4 to account for the four working spaces. The\nworking-space model includes two pistons,\nthe piston-swept volumes - the expansion and compression spaces, three heat\nexchangers - the heater, regenerator and\ncooler, and four adiabatic connecting\nducts. The pistons are positioned as func-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\ntions of time according to the specified frequency. The working space is divided into\nappropriately sized control volumes for\nanalysis. Flow resistances and heattransfer coefficients are calculated for\neach control volume at each time step\nover the engine cycle. Within each gas volume, the continuity and energy equations\nare integrated with respect to time; a simplified momentum equation (pressure drop\nis a function of a friction factor and floo\nrate) and an equation of state are also used\nin the calculations.\nThe basic computer model equations\nare applied to each of the control volumes.\nThe temperatures, masses, heat-transfer\ncoefficients, and floo rates for each of the\ncontrol volumes and interfaces (except the\nappendix gap volumes and interfaces) are\nrepresented by dimensioned variable\nnames in the computer model.\nThe required engine-operating conditions that must be entered into the model\nare: Heater-tube outside-wall tefll)eratures\n(the combustor is not modeled), expansionand compression-space inside-wall temperatures, cooling-water-inlet temperature, COOling-water flow rate, engine\nspeed, and mean pressure. The coolertube inside-wall temperature is solved by iteration but is constant during anyone cycle.\nCylinder and regenerator-housing temperatures for conduction calculations can\neither be inputs or can be calculated from\nheater and cooler input temperatures.\nLosses due to imperfect heat transfer\nand appendix-gap pumping losses are an\nintegral part of the cycle calculations. The\nappendix-gap -pumping calculations assume isothermal appendix gaps. A cold appendix gap is included for the sake of generality; hO\'Never, its volume is very small for\nthe sample case, and its effect is negligible. Heat-conduction and piston-shuttle\nlosses are calculated and are accounted\nfor in the efficiency calculations.\nThe pressure-drop calculations are\nbased on a simplified momentum equation\nthat neglects gas inertia. Pressure-drop\ncalculations are also decoupled from the\nbaSic thermodynamic calculations for the\nworking space to neglect pressure-wave\ndynamics.\nTwo passes through the thermodynamic calculations are made to more accurately model the effect of the decoupled\npressure-drop calculations on engine performance. The calculated power loss due\nto pressure drop is about the same\nwhether one or two passes are made.\nHowever, in the second-pass calculations,\nthe effect of pressure drop on heat transfer\nto and from the engine and on mass trans-\n\nfer with the engine is more accurately\nmodeled; the net effect on predicted performance is to increase the basic power\n(power before pressure-drop loss) and efficiency of the engine.\nThe program is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor use on an IBM 370 computer.\nThis program was written by Roy C.\nTew, Jr., of lewis Research Center.

In the Qualitaflve and ",anti\xc2\xb7\ntative analysis of X-ray diffraction data,\noverlapping profiles introduce difficulties\nthat prevent an accurate determination of\npeak positions and the areas under the diffraction peaks. This problem is prevalent in\ncomplex multielement alloys and in certain\nmetal/matrix composites because of the\nlarge number of phases present. SOPAD\nhelps the analyst to get the most information out of the available diffraction data.\nSOPAD uses a Marquardt-type nonlinear\nregression routine to refine initial estimates\nof the individual peak positions, intensities,\nshapes, and half-widths.

It is suitable for\nmonofilament fibers with diameters of\nabout 10 to 50 /Am. It can also be adapted to\ntow fiber strands.\nA fiber, the diameter of which has been\nmeasured, is placed on a clean glass plate.\nA bead of silver-filled epoxy resin is applied\nto one end of the fiber, attaching it to the\nplate. After the fiber settles down to the surface from the disturbance of applying the\nresin, a bead of the resin is applied to the\nother end of the fiber. As the second bead\nis applied, the fiber is gently pulled taut so\nthat it stretches between the beads in a\nstraight line. It is not necessary to wait for the\nepoxy to cure. The mixed, uncured resin is\nviscous and holds the fiber securely.\nOhmmeter probes are placed on opposite ends of the fiber, and the resistance between the probes is measured (see figure).\n\nOne advantage of not waiting for the epoxy\nbeads to cure is that the probe points can\nbe pressed into them to establish good\nelectrical contact with the fiber. The contact resistance is negligible.\nThe distance along the fiber between\nthe resinlfiber junctions is then measured\nwith the aid of a divider, ruler, or other convenient instrument. The resistivity e is calculated from the measured resistance R,\nthe length L, and the cross-sectional area A\nof the fiber, according to e = RAIL.\nThis work was done by Julia Daniels,\nJohnny M.

Because of the carbonate unit. many of\nthese materials also exhibit high order or\ncrystallinity. All of the new imide\'containing\npolymers are insensitive to acetone.\nCommercial polymers based on the inclusion of carbonate units are thermoplastic (300 0 C processing temperature) and\nhave high impact resistance in an amorphous state. However. they lose their\ntoughness as they crystallize. The commercial polycarbonates have a heatdistortion temperature in the range of 130 0\nto 140 0 C and withstand continuous use at\ntemperatures up to 1200 C.These systems\nexhibit crazing and loss of properties when\nexposed to many organic solvents. Acetone is particularly deleterious to polycarbonates. Thus. there is a need for a solventand thermal-resistant aromatic resin that\ncan be cured between 180 0 and 300 0 C.\nThe new poly(carbonate-imide} exhibits\nsignificantly increased temperature resistance and shows less sensitivity to solvents\n\nthan commercial polycarbonates. By incorporating a carbonate unit into a poIyimide\nbackbone at varying levels and of varying\nstructures. a series of ordered or crystalline thermoplastic polymers is produced\nthat is solvent-resistant and has heatdistortion temperatures in excess of\n140 0 C.\nThe poly(carbonate-imides} are prepared according to the reaction scheme\nshown in the figure. They were characterized for heat-distortion temperature using\na differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).\nso the temperature of the transition of the\npolymer from the glassy state to the rubbery state (Tg) could be measured. All of\nthe poly(carbonate-imides} prepared have\nhigher temperature capabilities than the\ncommercial systems. In fact. the lowest T9\nis 190 0 C compared to 130 0 to 140 0 C for\nthe commercial systems. The highest T9 of\n278 0 C is twice that for the commercial\nsystems. The inherent viscosities for the\npoly(carbonate-imides} ranged from 0.59\nto 0.65 dl/g. indicating that all had very similar molecular weights.\n\nThe DSC studies show that systems\nwhere x is greater than 2 have crystalline\ntransitions or highly ordered glass-torubber transitions that are common with\nthe polycarbonates but not common with\nthe base polyimide where y = 10. The\ncrystalline melts occur in the temperature\nrange of 325 0 to 450 0 C. Also, for several\nof the copolymers.

Epoxy resins, however,\ntend to absorb moisture, causing objectionable plasticization of the material and\ndepression of the polymer glass-transition\ntemperature. Although chromium-complex\ncoupling agents have reduced moisture\nabsorption at the interface between resin\nand reinforcement, moisture absorption at\nthe resin surface and into the bulk of the\npolymer remains a problem. The relatively\nhigh water uptake capacity of epoxy resins\nis due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in\nthe epoxy chains that attract polar water\nmolecules.\nIn a new technique, a chromium-ioncontaining epoxy with improved resistance\nto moisture can be produced where the\nchromium ions are believed to prevent the\nabsorption of water molecules by coordinating themselves to the hydroxyl groups\n\non the epoxy chain . One of three processes developed in this new technique for\nproducing an epoxy with improved moisture resistance involves:\n1. Addition of chromium ions to a preheated epoxide;\n2.

The oxygen sensor\nis a Y203-stabilized Zr02 ceramic disk\nmaintained at 843 \xc2\xb0 C. The overall system\nresponse time has been reduced to about\n0.2 second, which is equal to or less than\n1 percent of the tunnel run time. When the\ntest gas oxygen concentration differs from\nthe normal air concentration by 25 percent\nor more, an alarm sounds, and an emergency tunnel shutdown Signal operates.\nThe most frequently used electrochemical oxygen detectors are the solid\xc2\xb7state\nceramic oxide devices such as Zr02 and\nTi02 sensors. Of these two types, Zr02\nsensors are faster and more dependable in\ntransient combustion environments. The\nZr02 device is based on the Nernst equation, which relates the oxygen partial pressures on its oppoSite sides with the voltage\npotential difference developed across\nthem. The recommended operating temperature range for Zr02 sensors is 600\xc2\xb0 to\n850 0 C. The high temperature is necessary\nin order to prqduce the vacancies that effect the oxygen ion diffUSion through the\nsensor disk.\nThe sensor is made of a hightemperature Y20a-stabilized Zr02ceramic\nelectrolyte disk coated with porous platinum electrodes on both sides (see figure).\nThe platinum electrodes are sufficiently\nporous to permit ready diffusion of gases\nthrough them.\nOxygen, or an oxygen-containing gas\nsuch as air, is supplied to one side of the\ndisk, and the test gas is supplied to the\nother side (see figure). Oxygen molecules\narriving at the heated electrode are dissociated and converted to doubly charged\noxygen ions, with the platinum electrode\nproviding the necessary electrons. The 0.2\nions combine with the vacancies and diffuse through the heated ceramic disk to\nthe other side, where they convert to neuNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\ntral O2 molecules with the platinum electrode taking up the extra electrons.\nWhen the concentration of oxygen is dif\xc2\xb7\nferent on the two sides of the disk, more oxygen ions migrate from the high-oxygenconcentration side to the low-oxygenconcentration side. This ion flow provides\nan electronic imbalance that results in a\nvoltage difference between the two platinum electrodes. The voltage difference is a\nfunction of the disk temperature and the\noxygen partial pressures on the two sides\nof the disk.\n\nBecause, in practice, the pressure is not\nusually exactly equal on the two sides of\nthe sensor and the sensor matrix has impurities and imperfections, a practical relationship between the sensor output and the\noxygen partial pressures on the two sides\nis given by the following equation:\nE=\n\nATln(:~) + C(P)\n\nwhere A = a mathematical constant, T =\nthe Zr02 disk temperature, and qP) = the\n\nperfonns reliably\n\n5uper c~Ei~=\'~~\ndurable\nKapton\n\nperformance in hostile environments\nand harsh chemicals.

Because of the extreme sensitivity of the Nernst voltage to the Zr02 disk\ntemperature, it is necessary to use a feedback loop, based on a thermocouple signal, to maintain the sensor temperature at\na constant, high level of 843 0 C. A\nNiCr/NiAi thermocouple is used to monitor\nthe temperature of the Zr02 sensor. An error signal, generated by comparing the\nthermocouple signal with a predetermined\nset point, is then used to maintain the sensor at 843 0 C.\nInitially, the Zr02 oxygen sensor was calibrated using various mixtures of N2 and O2\nat room temperature. The system was\nthen modified to include hydrocarbon\ncombustion products in the test gas\nstream. Finally, the system was modified\nso that a controlled amount of oxygen gas\nwas introduced in the air prior to methane\ncombustion, as would be the case in the\ncombustor of the wind tunnel. The 02-toCH 4 flow rate ratio was adjusted to produce the same oxygen sensor output as\nobtained with the room air.

Hall-voltage readings are accepted\nonly during the stable intervals A, C, E, and F. The Seebeck coefficient is determined from the differentiation of the least squares polynomial fit of the vOltage-versus-temperature curve.

The averaging procedure is repeated for eight different combinations of\nelectric probes and directions of current.\nThe computer also records the high and\nlow values for each measurement point. It\nperiodically displays results to the operator\nand asks whether they are acceptable. The\noperator can repeat any portion of the test\nif the data are suspect. The measurements\nare repeated for many temperatures over\nthe expected operating range of the material. Clearly, gathering Hall-voltage data\nwould be both tedious and error prone by\nmanual methods.\nFor measurements of the large-thermalgradient Seebeck coefficient. the microcomputer takes control once the test speeimen is inserted in a test fixture; no human\nintervention is necessary. The temperature\nof the cold side of the sample is held con-\n\nstant, while the temperature of the hot side\nis increased by the computer. At preset\ntemperature increments - every 10\xc2\xb0 C,\nfor example - the computer stores the\ncoId- and hot-side temperatures and the\nSeebeck voltage. Once the variation of the\nSeebeck voltage with temperature has\nbeen determined, the computer finds the\nSeebeck coefficient from the slopes of the\nvoltage-versus-temperature curve.\nThermal diffusivity is determined by the\nflash method, in which a sensor measures\nthe temperature of the back surface of a\nsample resulting from a flash of heat on the\nfront surface. The accuracy of the thermaldiffusivity measurement depends on the\naccuracy with which peak temperature\nand halftime (the time it takes for the rear\nsurface to reach one-half the peak temperature rise) can be measured, and this is\n\nwhere computerized data acquisition\ncomes into play.\nThe digitized points that make up the\ncurve of back-surface temperature versus\ntime are transferred from a digital oscilloscope to the computer. The computer then\nfinds a curve that fils the points and differentiates the curve. The point where the\nslope of the equation is zero-corresponds\nto the peak temperature. With the peak\ntemperature determined, the computer\nthen finds the halftime value by interpolating between the origin and the peak\ntemperature.\nThis work was done by Artur\nChmielewski and Charles Wood of Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Labora\xc2\xb7\ntory.

It is useful\nwhere high-temperature resistance, flexibility,\nand ease of installation are important for example, as insulation for odd-shaped\nfurnaces and high-temperature ducts, as\ncurtains for furnace openings and for fire\ncontrol, and as conveyor belts in hot\nprocesses.\nThe blanket is a quilted composite consisting of two face sheets: the outer one of\nsilica, the inner one of silica or other glass\ncloth with a center filling of pure silica glass\nfelt sewn together with silica glass threads\n(see figure). The felt fibers have diameters\nranging from 1 to 3 ,.an.

These films are between 90- and\n100-percent transparent at the visible\nwavelength of 500 nm, compared to 60 to\n70 percent for commercial polyimide film\nof equal thickness.\nLinear aromatic condensation polyimide film is used in many aerospace and\ncommercial applications. These polyimides are known for their bright yellow color.\nFurther, the intensely colored aromatic\npolyimides, upon aging in a space environment, become even less transparent, as\nlow as 30 percent. The need exists, therefore, for high-temperature, flexible polymeric film and coating materials that have\nhigh optical transparency in the 3OO-to600 -nm range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum for applications on antennas,\nsolar cells, and thermal-control coating\nsystems.\nThe new process involves two conditions: (1) Purification of both aromatic diamine and aromatic dianhydride monomers\nand the solvent used as a medium, and (2)\nseparation or removal of chromaphoric\ncenters and reduction of both inter- and\nintra-chain electronic interactions that\ncause absorption in the ultravioletlvisible\nrange by introducing bulky groups and\n"separator" groups into the polymer m0lecular structure. Both conditions must be\nused concurrently to produce polyimide\nfilms with maximum optical transparency.\n108\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC\n\nI\n\nc\n\n/\n\nN/\nC\n\n/\n\nC\n\n/\n\nFilm\n\nI\n\nR\n0\n\nOptICally\nTransparent\nPoIyImide\n\nNn\n\n0\n\nCF3\n\n-@-o-@- 6-@-o-@r\nI\n\nCF3\n\nCF3\n\nand\n\nIs\n\n)QL 6JQ(\nI\n\nC F3\n\nOptically Transparent Polylmide Films are made from a variety of aromatic condensation\npolyimides. The films range from very pale in color to colorless.\n\nFor the first condition, at least one recrystallization or sublimation of the aromatic diamine and dianhydride monomers\nwas necessary to prevent impure starting\nmaterials from discoloring the final polyim-\n\nide film. It was also necessary to use distilled solvent as a reaction medium.\nThe second condition involves use in the\nmonomers of bulky groups such as - CF3\nor S02 groups and "separator" groups\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nsuch as - 0 - linkages that can reduce\nelectron affinity and overall conjugation in\nthe polymer chain. Incorporation of\nelectron-withdrawing groups in the diamine ~ortion of the polymer structure reduces the formation of inter- and intrachain charge-transfer complexes that\ncause large absorptions in the UV-visible\nrange. Incorporation of large, bulky groups\ninto either the diamine or dianhydride monomers reduces the amount of chain-tochain electronic interactions and thereby\ndiscourages charge-transfer-complex\nformation.\nIn this process, a highly purified aromatic diamine is dissolved in a distilled\namide-type solvent such as dimethylacetamide. A highly purified dian hydride is then\nadded to the diamine solution at room temperature to form a polyamic acid. This\nresin is then spread onto a glass plate to\n\nform a film using a doctor blade with a\nspecified blade gap. The polyamic acid film\nis then thermally converted to the polyimide by heating to 300\xc2\xb0 C.\nOptical transparency of the films was\ndetermined not only by physical appearance but by transmission UV-visible spectroscopy. Spectra of 0.2 mil (0.005 mm)\nthick films showed strong absorptions with\ncutoffs located between 300 and 400 nm\n(UV region) compared to a cutoff between\n450 and 500 nm (visible region) for a commercial polyimide film of equal thickness.\nM a result of this process, high optical\ntransparency was obtained for a variety of\naromatic condensation polyimides (see\nfigure).\nFilms were prepared that range from\nvery pale in color to colorless, compared to\nthe bright yellow color of conventional!\ncommercial aromatic poiyimide film. This\n\nincreased transparency was achieved at\nno sacrifice in thermal stability, flexibility,\ntoughness, or mechanical properties.\nThese features make the films extremely\nattractive as films or coating materials for\naerospace applications or for any other applications where high optical transparency\nor thermal stability is required.\nThis INOrk was done by Anne K.

However, these resins are\nextremely sensitive to certain solvents and\nhave relatively low tolerance to heat. By reacting phenoxy resins with various\namounts of an ethynyl-contalning acid\nchloride, one obtains phenoxy resins containing different amounts of pendent ethynyl groups. When exposed to elevated\ntemperatures, a thermally induced reaction of the ethynyl groups results in branching and cross-linking. (A catalyst could be\nused to lower the cure temperature, but it\nis unnecessary.) As a result of the curing\nreaction, the use temperature and solvent\nresistance of the cured modified phenoxy\nresins are greatly increased over previous\nphenoxy and modified phenoxy resins.\nEthynyl-containing phenoxy resins were\nprepared from the reaction of phenoxy\nresins with ethynyl-substituted aryl acid\nchlorides such as 4-ethynylbenzoyl chloride, as shown in the figure. The ethynyl\ncontent can be readily controlied simply by\ncontrolling the amount of 4-ethynylbenzoyl\nchloride used or by coreaction of the pendent hydroxy groups on the phenoxy resins\nwith mixtures of the ethynyl-substituted\naryl acid chloride and other acid chlorides\nsuch as benzoyl chloride.

The\nspecimens were to be subjected to cyclic\nheating and cooling in a high-velocity, hot\ngas stream using coaI-in-oil fuel.\nDue to the energy crisis caused by the\nreduction in availability of crude oil, there\nwas a serious need for alternative energy\nschemes to reduce the dependence of the\nUnited States on foreign oil. One scheme\nthat had been attempted in the past involves the use of a mixture of coal particles\nin fuel oil (COM) with the coal in the mixture\nbeing as high as 50 weight percent. The\nuse of COM has the advantage of reducing\nthe amount of oil used while still allowing\nthe COM to be handled and bumed as a\nliquid.\nIn the past, most attempts to use COM\nhave been with regard to its use in utility\nboilers and blast furnaces. However, because of the rapidly expanding use of gas\nturbines for applications such as electrical\ngeneration, it would be extremely advantageous to operate such turbines on COM.\nAttempts to operate gas turbines on pow110\n\n~\n~-----4Cc1mbue1ion\n\nAIr Source\n\na,.....-\'1lJo---UJ---J\n\nAutomatic Fuel\nControl\nValve\n\nPressure\nRelief\nFuel\nDrum\n\nFigure 1.

First, there\nmust be adequate atomization of the COM\nand second. minimization of coking of the\nburner. Meeting these conditions will be\nachieved only by clean burning and flame\nstability.\nThe object of the facility is to provide for\ncoal-in-oil mixture in a combustor or burner\nsystem (see Figure 1) in which ash resulting from burning the mixture is of submicron particle size. The burner system comprises a burner section. a flame exit nozzle.\na fuel-nozzle section, and an air tube by\nwhich preheated air is directed into the\nburner section. A regulated airflow at a\ncontrolled pressure is delivered to a fuel\nnozzle where it is mixed with fuel. A liquid\npump is provided to direct a mixture of coal\nparticles and oil from a drum to the nozzle\nat a desired rate and pressure. The fuel\nmixer in the drum is provided to keep the\ncoal particles uniformly distributed in the\ncoal-in-oil mixture.\nThe burner section (see Rgure 2) has an\ninner wall that is separated from an outer\nwall. This arrangement reduces heat transfer from the combustion zone to provide\nmore complete burning of the fuel.

One\ndrawback of highly cross-linked epoxy\nresins is their brittleness and accompanying low mechanical strengths. A technique\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nhas been developed for improving the mechanical strength of epoxy resins by adding cobalt ions in the form of tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt (III) complex (abbreviated\n"Co(acach"].\nOne of three new processes for producing a cobalt ion-containing epoxy with im-\n\nproved mechanical properties involves:\n1.

Postcuring at 17]0 C.\nThe epoxy solution in this process comprises a tetraglycidylmethylenedianiline\n(TGMDA) epoxide (61 .5 percent by weight),\nan epoxidized phenolic novolac commercially known as SU-8 (5.0 percent by\nweight), and a low-boiling-temperature solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)\n(33.5 percent by weight). A premix is prepared separately containing Co(acach (1 .3\nto 11 .6 percent by weight), an aromatic diamine curing agent such as 4,4/-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) (20.1 to 22.4 percent\nby weight), and a low-boiling-temperature\nsolvent such as MEK (6.8 to 7.6 percent by\nweight). The cobalt/amine premix is added\nto the epoxy solution so that the final mixture contains 43.5 to 46.2 percent premix\nand 53.8 to 56.5 percent epoxy solution.\nThe reaction scheme is shown in the\nfigure.\nSolid cast disks prepared from cobalt\nion-containing epoxy resins were tested for\nflexural strength and stiffness. Incorporation of cobalt ions into the epoxies increased the flexural strength of the resins\nby 10 to 95 percent. Suitable resins for this\ntechnique include any liqui d or solid\nTGMDA resins.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe addition of refractory fibers and\nwhiskers to insulating tiles composed pri\xc2\xb7\nmarily of fibrous silica, such as those used\non the skin of the Space Shuttle orbiter,\ngreatly improves their properties. For example, rncdifying the formulation with 15 percent alumina fibers and 2.85 percent boron\nnitride multiplies the flexural strength by a\nfactor of 2 or 3 while maintaining the same\nlOIN density as that of the all-silica tiles (see\nfigure). Added benefits are an increase in\nthe modulus of elasticity and less deformation and shrinkage at temperatures above\n2,300\xc2\xb0 F (1,260\xc2\xb0 C).\nAlthough originally developed to provide\nthe Space Shuttle with tiles of greater\nstrength and dimensional stability, the new\ncomposition is also suitable for lightweight,\nthermallY\'stable mirror blanks and as furnace and kiln insulation. The improved tiles\nare made with current tile-fabrication\nprocesses.\nThe tile ingredients are blended with deionized water to form a thick slurry and\ncast to shape. After drying, the tiles are\nheated. Boron nitride is especially useful\nbecause it resists oxidation up to about\n1,830\xc2\xb0 F (1,000\xc2\xb0 C), then slowly dissociates to boron trioxide and nitrogen gas\nduring subsequent heating to higher\ntemperatures.\nThe boron addition promotes eutectic\nsintering and provides a strong borosilicate\nbond at fiber junctions. At the tile-firing temperature of 2,350\xc2\xb0 F (1,290\xc2\xb0 C), the slowlyreleased boron trioxide has time to react\nas it diffuses throughout the tile to all the silica fibers, producing uniformly bonded intersections.

Tests show that the temperature in the\nfurnace can be controlled to obtain a constant rate of movement of a hightemperature isotherm down the length of\nthe furnace. The tests also show that a\ntemperature gradient on the order of\n20\xc2\xb0 Ocm can be obtained in the furnace\nwhile a 900\xc2\xb0 C isotherm is moved. A functional dependency of growth rate on perturbations during the growth has been derived and shows the importance of avoiding nonsteady growth rates and changing\ntemperature gradients.\nLTT is a compound semiconductor that\ncan be considered a binary mixture of leadtelluride molecules and tin-telluride molecules. The pseudobinary phase diagram\nshows that the two materials are fully miscible. A mixture of 20 percent tin telluride\nand 80 percent lead telluride was chosen\nfor NASA\'s zero-gravity experiment. This\ncombination, which solidifies in a temperature range around 900\xc2\xb0 C, dictates the\ntemperature at which the furnace should\nbe characterized.\nA schematic of a furnace is shown in\nFigure 1. There are three heaters in the furnace and a water-cooled heat extractor\nthat makes contact with the end of the cartridge. Control software brings the sepaI\'9.te heaters to any desired temperature.\nCareful selection of temperature profiles\nallows a particular isotherm to be moved\ndown the length of the furnace at a fixed\nrate . Directional solidification can be\nachieved by either moving the furnace and\nthe sample relative to each other or by\nramping a temperature gradient through\nthe furnace at a constant rate. Since the\nfurnace is designed to be stationary with\nno moving parts, its temperature profiles\nmust be characterized, and a procedure\nmust be developed for controlling the temperatures in the three zones so that a solidification front passes down the specimen\nat a constant growth rate with a sufficiently\nhigh temperature gradient to avoid constitutional supercooling.\nSince the fabrication of an LTT sample\nis quite time consuming and the sample\ncan be solidified only once without risk of\nampoule breakage (which can result in\n114\n\nStainlessSteel\nCartridge\n\nHot\nElement\n\nSample\nMiddle\nElement\n\n1\nStainless\nSeating\nSleeve\n\nf\n2.79cm\n\n~\n\nCold\nElement\n\nHeat\nExtractor\n\nFigure 1.

At the same time, the garment would\nallow heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide to\npass from the inside to the outside so that\nthe wearer remains comfortable.\nThe garment would be made of cotton\nfabric on which a thin layer of polyacrylate\nrubber has been deposited by calendering\nor spraying. It would be lighter and cooler\nthan existing protective garments made of\ntwo layers of canvas separated by a core\nof activated charcoal and a chlorinated\ncompound. Moreover, it would not release\ngrains of core material. Such grains can\nembed themselves in the wearer\'s skin,\ncausing irritation.\nPolyacrylate rubber was selected for\nthe garment material because it transmits\nwater vapor and carbon dioxide at high\nrates. The rates could be adjusted to the\nvalues required for human comfort by\nvarying the rubber formulation. At the\nsame time, polyacrylate rubber would\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\ntransmit large-molecule chemical agents\nat low rates - many orders of magnitude\nlower than the rates for moisture and carbon dioxide. In addition, such agents could\nbe destroyed within the polyacrylate rubber layer by reactive additives.\nBecause the polyacrylate rubber is nonporous, it would not pass bacteria and viruses. For the same reason , the layer\nwould exclude radioactive dust. If radioactive materials become lodged on the surface of the garment or trapped in it by\nchemical reaction, the garment could be\ndiscarded.\nAn example of a reactive additive is calcined magnesium oxide, which could be\nmixed with the polyacrylate in proportiOns\nas great as 44 percent by weight. The magnesium oxide would react with moisture\nfrom the wearer to form magnesium hydroxide. This alkaline material would then\nreact with the phosphate moiety of the\nsmall amount of phosphate-based warfare\nagent that would penetrate into the rubber\nlayer. The agent would then be neutralized\n\nby the formation of insoluble magnesium\nphosphates.\nAcid hydrolysis additives could also be\nincluded in the rubber, either alone or in\ncombination with alkaline hydrolysis additives. Similarly, oxidants, precipitants, complexing reagents, and others could be\nadded to destroy harmful chemicals. Of\ncourse, such reagents and their products\nmust be bound in the rubber so that they\nwould not escape to become skin irritants,\nlung irritants, or carcinogens.\nIt would probably not be necessary to\nvulcanize the rubber. If vulcanizing is done,\nhowever, the curing agent should be selected carefully. Polyamines should be\navoided, for example, because they are\nskin irritants. Fortunately, nonallergenic\nvulcanizing compounds are available.\nThis work was done by Eugene R.\ndu Fresne of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pr0pulsion Laboratory_For further information, Circle 91 on the TSP Request Card.\nNPO-1651O\n115\n\nUltrasonic Mixing of Epoxy Curing Agents\nUniform mixing is obtained at relatively low\ntemperatures, without adding solvent.\n\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\n\nAircraft of the future will require highperformance polymer matrices to fully\nachieve the weight savings possible with\ncomposite materials. Some potentially\nuseful polymer/curing agent combinations\ncannot be mixed properly because of the\nhigh melting temperatures of the curing\nagents. fls an exarTl)le, when curing agent A\nis heated to its me~ temperature of 242\xc2\xb0 C\nand mixed into epoxy resin, the result is uncontrollable, very rapid curing. If solvent is\nused to lower the melt temperature, residual solvent evolution during subsequent\nprocessing causes voids and degradation\nof properties in the final part. Another curing agent is a fluffy, low-density crystalline\nmaterial that is difficult to blend into the\nepoxy.\nA new ultrasonic mixing technique alleviates these problems. The technique has\nbeen used to mix several curing agents!\nepoxy combinations. The major component of the commercially available base\nepoxy resin used is tetraglycidylmethylenedianiline (fGMDA).\nThe ultrasonic unit used is the commercial ultrasonic generator with transducer\nand horn shown in Figure 1. Maximum\npower output for the unit is 300 W. A polyimide release film is taped to the end of the\nhorn to form a cup for the resin and curing\nagent during excitation. The curing agents\nare hand mixed into the epoxy resin at 30\xc2\xb0 C\nbefore ultrasonic blending.\nThe mixing ratios of the samples are\n26.3 parts per hundred, by weight, for the\ntwo conventional systems and 22.5 parts\nper hundred for the two experimental systems. Prior to ultrasonic treatment, the\nsamples are opaque, lumpy, viscous liquids, each colored a darker shade than the\nnatural color of the curing agent.\nThe samples are placed in the cup with\nthe top of the ultrasonic horn forming the\nbottom of the cup. They are ultrasonically\ntreated until they became amber colored\nand transparent. The peak temperature\nreached while mixing the high-melting curing agent A with TGMDA is around 150\xc2\xb0 C\nafter mixing for 10 min. The other three curing agents take between 1 and 4 min to dissolve, reaching peak temperatures of 90\xc2\xb0\nto 100\xc2\xb0 C for very short times.\nAfter ultrasonic mixing, the resin\nsamples are cured in an air-circulating\noven. Because ultrasonic agitation drives\n116\n\nFigure 1.

A laboratory process\nwas scaled up to yield 50-gram quantities\nof the elastomer without loss of molecular\nweight.\nThe two-stage process proved to be far\nmore successful than synthesis from reactive monomers. The process involves the\nsynthesis of a silanol-terminated prepolymer and subsequent extension of the prepolymer chain with additional aminosilane\nmonomer.\nIn an experiment, a prepolymer was\nsyntheSized (see figure) by the reaction of\n1,4-bis(hydroxymethylsilyl)benzene with\nbis(dimethylamino)dimethylsilane in toluene in a nitrogen atmosphere at 109 0 to\n112 0 C. After cooling, the prepolymer was\npreCipitated in methanol, purified, and\ndried. The polymer was synthesized by reacting the prepolymer with more bis(dimethylamino)dimethysilane in the same\nmanner as before.\nMolecular weights near and above 106\nwere obtained conSistently. The greater effectiveness of the two-stage technique in\ncomparison with the reactive-monomer\nprocess is probably a result of the greater\ncontrol of stoichiometry afforded by the\nformer.

However, at\nlow gravity, the carbon particles would be\ndistributed homogeneously throughout the\niron.\nThe proposed method is based on experiments on solidification in an airplane\nflying parabolic arcs. Graphite flotation in\nsamples of a few millimeters in size was reduced to between_one-hundredth and one-\n\nthousandth its "normal" values.\nHypereutectic (high-carbon) cast iron\ndirectionally solidified in low gravity has\nlarge, unaggregated carbon nodules distributed evenly throughout the casting. In\ncontrast, cast iron of the same overall\ncomposition solidified in the same manner\nbut, at Earth gravity, has large, aggregated\nmodules concentrated at the top of the\ncasting.\nSimilarly, hypereutectic flake cast iron\ndirectionally solidified in low gravity has\nlarge flakes of carbon scattered uniformly\nthroughout the casting and often alined\nwith the direction of solidification. The\nsame cast iron solidified at Earth gravity\nhas no large flakes in the bottom portion of\n\nthe casting and large aggregated flakes in\nthe upper portion.\nMany different microstructures could\nbe obtained by the proposed technique,\nand the percentage by weight of carbon\nthat could be retained in the melt would be\nmuch higher than it is at present. For example, by increasing the weight fraction of\ncarbon to more than 10 percent, the volume fraction of carbon would be increased\nto over 50 percent, resulting in an iron/carbon composite of greatly reduced density.\nThis work was done by Peter A.

Silicon monoxide, generated by the\nreaction of carbon and silica at 1,450\xc2\xb0 C, is\nreacted with a stream of ammonia mixed\nwith hydrogen, carbon monoxide, andlor\nnitrogen. The JPL version of the process\nuses higher temperatures and flow rates in\nconjunction with a simple tubular configuration of the reaction chamber.\nThe silicon nitride forms as a layer of\nwhite corklike material, up to 6 mm thick,\ncovered with a satin-textured parallel\n\ngrowth of whiskers. The whiskers are\nsingle crystals of beta silicon nitride, about\n1 f4Tl in diameter and up to 5 cm long. The\ncorklike material appears to be a lightly\npacked mesh of submicron beta sial on\nwhiskers.\nThe whiskers are expected to find application as reinforcement in composite silicon\nnitride ceramic parts. The corklike material\nmay be useful in its present form for thermal barrier tiles. Work must still be done,\nhowever, to identify what catalyst, if any, is\noperating in the process and to relate process parameters to the form and composition of the products.\nThis work was done by R.

Dampers\nof this type have been shewn to be effective\nfor controlling rotor vibrations; however, a\nhistoric lack of design data and designer\nexperience with elastomer dampers has\ninhibited the expansion of their application.\nThe term "elastomer" refers to a large variety of synthesized polymers as well as to\nnatural rubber. The purpose of this handbook is to provide such data in a compact\nand convenient form and to encourage the\nuse of elastomer dampers and elastomeric\ndamping treatments.\nA portion of the design data contained in\nthis handbook is relevantto many mechanical design problems and applications of\nelastomers. For example, the elastomer\ndynamic-property data may be utilized in\nthe design of structural supports for shock\nand vibration isolation and insulation.\nSome basic information regarding the effect of structural damping is included in\nthis work. Specific information concerning\nthe design of such structural members is\nbeyond the scope of this handbook, but an\nextensive bibliography is provided at the\nconclusion of each chapter to aid the design engineer in finding a solution to the\nproblem.\nThe specific steps required for the design of elastomer dampers are reviewed in\ndetail and include the procedures and justifications for the selection of a particular\nelastomer material and a particular elas-\n\ntomer configuration as well as the details\ninvolved in the design of the damper hardware. In order to provide as complete a reference as possible, a full range of such\nphysical properties as density and thermal\nconductMty are also provided for a large\nvariety of elastomer compositions. Such\nconsiderations as compatibility with fluid,\nozone, and adhesives are also presented\nalong with specific compatibility data for\nseveral elastomer materials.\nFor the designer who finds it necessary\nto determine the dynamic properties for a\nparticular elastomeric material, or for an\nelastomeric material for which the dynamic properties are not available, a thorough\ndiscussion of the most common dynamicproperty test methods is presented. This\nhandbook includes a detailed description\nof the procedure for performing the baseexcitation resonant -mass test, which is the\nmost versatile and the least sensitive to instrumentation error. Detailed examples of\nexisting elastomer dampers are discussed, along with the steps encountered\nin the design process, to provide the reader\nwith a complete picture of the design\nprocedure.\nThis work was done by M.

These equations,\nwhich represent the coupled chemomechanica I behavior of a polymer, are quite\ngeneral and apply irrespective of the constitutive properties of a material. They are.\nhowever, complicated and highly nonlinear, and hence not tractable analytically in\nthe general case.\nIn applying the equations to particular\ncases, simplification is achieved by selecting such particular conditions as constant\ntemperature or by making specific, simplifying assumptions about the nature of the\nprocess being modeled. For example, in\nthe first of three cases considered, relaxation is assumed to occur without chain\nscission. The resulting equation states that\nthe shift factor due to the cross-link density\nis an exponential rather than a power function of chemical cross-linking density. The\ntemperature dependence is included\nimplicitly.\nIn the second case, chain scission is assumed to occur without physical relaxation\nand at constant temperature. The equation\nderived under these assumptions is shown\nto be in agreement with certain hightemperature sciSSion-process data where\n\nConstitutive Equations of\nAging in Polymers\nStress-relaxation and creep\nc hemomechanical behavior\nare analyzed .\nA theoretical paper presents solutions\nof equations that describe polymeric aging. The solutions apply under such loading\nconditions as constant strain (stress relaxation), constant strain rate, and stress relaxation with a sudden change of cross-link\ndensity. These theoretical models form a\nframework for predicting the chemomechanical aging behavior of elastomers and\npolymers.\nThe previous constitutive equation describing the relaxation behavior of timedependent, chemically unstable materials\nwas developed by employing the irreversible thermodynamics of internal variables\nand Eyring\'s absolute-react ion-rate theory.\nRelated equations (also developed previously) include a set of evolution equations\nthat can account for the effect of the\n\nMEASURE RPM INSTANTLY\n\nThere is a\n\nPioneer Model DT36 M Digital\n\nTACHOMETER\nwith memory\n\nContinous Digital\nReadout\n60 to 50,000 RPM\nVISible Light Beam\nmakes aiming easy\nNo Wires or\nMechanical\nConnections Required\nMemory stores\nlast reading\n\nno physical relaxation occurs.\nIn the third case, both physical relaxation and chemical aging are assumed to\noccur simultaneously With constant temperature assumed, three different loading\nhistories are investigated: Stress relaxation, constant strain rate, and stress relaxation with a sudden change of cross-link\ndensity.\nIn the final section of the report on creep\nbehavior, the introduction of the Gibbs free\nenergy leads to constitutive equations expressed as functions of stress and temperature. Using a three-element model that is\nmathematically equivalent to the model of\ntwo springs in parallel , with one of them in\nseries with a dashpot, the equations thus\nderived show, for the first time, the relations between mechanical models and internal variables in the creep expressions.\nThe final set of equations presented describes the coupled chemomechanical\nbehavior of a nonaging network polymer\nundergoing simple creep at constant temperature and stress. These equations explicitly express the effect of chain scission\non the creep rate.\nThis work was done by Steven T. J. Peng\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nlaboratory.

Because flotation, sedimentation, and\nconvection are suppressed, alloys that s0lidify at nearly zero gravity have unusual\nand potentially useful characteristics.\nThe study was conducted in an airplane\nthat repeatedly flew along parabolic trajectories. During these maneuvers, the gravitation perceived in the airplane was about\n0.001 to 0.1of its normal value for 20 to 30 seconds. A directional-solidification furnace\nwas used to slowly advance the solidlliquid\ninterfaces along rod-shaped cast iron\nsamples of 4-mm diameter. For each sample, controlled solidification was continued\nthrough several dives. The known solidification rate of the sample was then correlated with accelerometer data to determine the gravity level during solidification\nat any point in the sample.\nIn low-phosphorus, flake-graphite samples, bands of coarse graphite appeared in\n\nthe regions solidified under low gravity. The\ncoarsening is explained by the absence of\nflotation, which allows long flakes of graphite to be incorporated into the solidification\nfront.\nHigh-phosphorus, flake-graphite iron\nsamples had larger eutectic cells in the\nlow-graviity zones. These cells were followed by bands of coarse graphite. Thus, it\nseems that convection favors increased\nnucleation.\nThe spheroidal-graphite samples were\nsimilar to the flake-graphite samples in that\nthey had bands of larger graphite nodules\ncorresponding to regions of low gravity.\nThis is a consequence of graphite flotation\nin normal gravity and incorporation of the\ngraphite in the solidification front in low\ngravity.\nThus, it appears that iron/carbon alloys\nmade at low gravity can have greater carbon content (as high as 5 to 10 percent)\nthan those made at Earth gravity because\nthe carbon particles do not float to the top\nof the melt. With directional solidification,\nlow-gravity iron/carbon alloys might also\nbe made with highly directional properties.\nFor example, thermal conductivity can be\nmade very high along the solidification axis\nand very low across this axis.\n\nThis work was done by J.

The technique may be\nuseful for monitoring bacterial makeup in\nenvironmental stucfJeS and in places where\ncleanliness is essential, such as hospital 0perating rooms, breweries, and pharmaceutical plants.\nIn the laboratory version of the system,\nany one of three species of bacteria is allowed to deposit and grow for 40 hours in a\nculture medium composed of tryptone,\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nyeast extract,glucose, and sodium chloride.\nThe culture is harvested by repeated washing with distilled water, then suspended in distilled water and refrigerated. In preparation\nfor analysis, the sample medium is converted from water to ethanol by washing in a\nseries of water/ethanol solutions of increasing ethanol concentration, ending with 100\npercent ethanol.\nAn aerosol containing the biological particles is generated by nebulizing the liquid\nsuspension. A stream of nitrogen gas carries the aerosol through a charge neutralizer, then through a drier. The aerosol, after\nexpansion into vacuum through the capillary nozzle, produces a beam of bacteria\nparticles. The heavier aerosol particles con\xc2\xb7\ntinue on a straight path into the mass spec-\n\ntrometer (see Figure 1), whereas the light\ncarrier-gas molecules are pumped off upstream of the nozzles.\nThe particles impinge on a hot rhenium\nfilament at 740\xc2\xb0 C in the ion source of a\nquadrapole mass spectrometer.

The particleinjection-and-ion-generation scheme is\nhighly effICient: Up to 70 percent of the material in the aerosol reaches the\nspectrometer.\nA burst of ions lasting for about 100 microseconds is produced by each microorganism. Bacterial species can be distin123\n\nguished via slight differences in their mass\nspectra (see Figure 2).

The system\ncould prevent motion sickness, which is\noften experienced during the early part of\nan orbital flight. It may also help to prevent\nseasickness and other forms of terrestrial\nmotion sickness.\nIn one form of the proposed system, a\ntraining subject sits on a three-dimensional\nplatform that can pitch, roll, and yaw Slightly. Belts and braces prevent the subject\nfrom moving the head or torso. A box\nmeasuring 8 feet (2.4 meters) on a side surrounds the subject. Projectors outside the\nbox cast images of visual scenes on its\nwalls.\nThe system would change the scene in\nresponse to attempted head and body\nmovements by the subject. The change\nwould simulate the motion that would be\nobserved by the subject if he or she were\nweightless . In space, the entire visual\nscene moves in reaction to a head movement, and changes in the perceived scene\nare different from those that would be 0bserved if the body was not weightless. For\nexample, when the subject uses the controls to command forward movement, the\nscene on the front wall enlarges, the\nscenes on the side walls pan rearward,\nand the table pitches the subject back\nslightly.\n124\n\nCircle Reader Action No. 358\n\nIn addition to this simulation of translational movement, rotation is simulated by\nrotating the box instead of the subject. The\nsubject\'s head is prevented from moving,\nbut transducers in the head restraint sense\nthe forces of incipient movement and generate the signals that rotate the box.\nThe training would affect the subject\'s\nperception of inner-ear signals, visual signals, and kinesthetic motion perception.\nThe changed perception would resemble\nthat of astronauts who have spent many\ndays in space and have adapted to\nweightlessness.\nThe effect of the force of gravity on the\ninner ear is minimized during training by\nmaintaining the gravity vector close to the\nvertical axis of the subject\'s body regardless of the orientation of the box. The effect\nof gravity is further reduced by computer\ncontrol of the visual scene motion and the\nslight pitch, roll, and yaw of the table. Gravity "washout" algorithms, some of which\nhave already been developed for aircraft\nSimulators, can be used for this purpose.\nSubjects would probably become motionsick when they first use the simulator.\nWith repeated exposures, however, the\nbrain would learn how to deal with the unfamiliar stimuli, and the symptoms would\ndiminish.\nThis work was done by Millard F.\nReschke of Johnson Space Center, and\nDonald E.

The gage can be used \'to evaluate\nthe effects of water on lift and to detect\nwater weight excesses.\nThe gage is shown schematically in the\nfigure.

This determines the resistivity. If the gage has wires\nwith diameters several times the water\nthickness, the relationship between resistivity and thickness is linear. The combination of the two outputs then gives the water\n\nO\n\nthickness. If water thicknesses smaller\nthan the small wire sensor are encountered, results are in error. Thus, the small\nwire should be smaller than the thinnest\nsheet of water measured.\nThis work was done by Leonard M.\nWeinstein of Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available on\nthe dual-thickness gage.

The sensor is being developed as part of an antilocking brake system for motorcycles. It\nuses the inlet pressure rather than the outlet pressure as the braking-control signal,\neliminating the pressure pulsations caused\nby the pump vanes and thus ensuring a\nlow-noise signal.\nThe sensor is a centrifugal air pump that\nis turned by one of the motorcycle wheels.\nAir enters the pump through orifice plates,\nand the sUQtion is taken off through a port\nin the pump inlet plenum (see figure).\nThe suction (negative pressure) at a simple inlet would be proportional to the\nsquare of the pump angular speed. However, the combination of orifice plates and\nintake resistance results in a negativepressure output that varies approximately\nlinearly with angular speed.\nBefore the vacuum signal enters the\nmain fluidic amplifier of the control system,\nit passes through a fluidic differentiator.\nThis component produces a signal that is\napproximately proportional to the rotary\nacceleration of the pump.\nIn a prototype recently tested, the vacuum signal lagged changes in rotary speed\nby about 64 milliseconds. However, byoptimizing the volume of the inlet plenum and\nthe resistances of the orifices, it should be\npossible to reduce the response time one\nquarter of its present value.\nThis work was done by C.

Basically, the time of\npassage of an undeformed blade is computed very accurately. The actual time of\npassage of each blade as it passes each\noptical probe is measured. Time differences are then directly related to the\namount of blade-tip deflection. Samples of\nblade-tip deflection from all of the probes\nare then assembled to represent vibration\nhistories of each of the blades.\nThe measurement system coordinates\nand assembles the inputs of many optical\nprobes (see figure) in order to monitor all of\nthe blades on a spinning stage. Several\npoints on every blade are monitored in order to develop a quantitative measure of\nthe overall bladed-stage response.\nExperimental determinations of bladevibration phenomena in gas-turbine engines are extremely important to the advanced development of these engines.\nMany aspects of these vibrations were difficult to adequately predict or measure in\nany quantitative fashion . These include\ncertain aspects of response to forced vibrations, blade-flutter phenomena, and\ncomplex engine/structural interactions that\noccur during transient excitations. ,Advanced\nturbine-engine development requires a\nbroader accounting for blade-vibration\nphenomena to meet future design goals for\nincreased performance , decreased\nweight, fuel economy, and minimized user\ncost.\nTraditionally, blade-vibration phenomena on rotating members have been studied\nusing strain gages. Signals generated on\nthe blades are passed through either multichannel slip rings or telemetry devices. Significant problems with these approaches\ninclude the degradation or loss of straingage signals due to the hostile operating\nenvironment. Furthermore, the number of\nmeasurement points is limited by the capacity of available slipring devices.\nIt is very difficult to quantitatively determine actual vibration patterns on rotating\nbladed stages with the limited number of\nmeasurement points available with straingage techniques. In part, this is due to the\ncomplexity of these vibration patterns and\nthe need to monitor many points in order to\nfully characterize these motions. With this\nnew system, the difficulties normally asso130\n\nAn Optical Probe is fixed in a casing to mon itor the deflection of turbine-blade tips.\n\nciated with strain-gage life and durability\ncan be reduced. The costs associated with\nthe mounting of the strain gages and the installation and maintenance of sliprings can\nbe avoided.\nThe complex bladed-disk responses become increasingly more complicated as\nthe stage is spun at operating speeds. The\neffects of aerodynamic and centrifugal\nloading and nonharmonic excitation result\nin very complex deformation patterns. Experimental methods were required for the\nmeasurement of many points on these rotating systems in order to develop a better\nassessment of the dynamical state of the\nentire assembly. Holographic imaging\nmethods with optical derotating prisms\nprovide an excellent source of qualitative\nmodal information for rotating stages that\nare visible. Strain-gaging methods are limited when considering a many-bladed\nstructure because of the number of strain\ngages required and the limited number of\nchannels available on slipring devices or\ntelemetry systems.\nThe instrumentation concept for measuring blade-tip displacements employs 0ptical probes and an array of microcomputers. The concept represents a hitherto\nunknown instrumentation capability for the\nacquisition and direct digitization of deflection data concurrently from all of the blade\ntips of an engine rotor undergoing flutter or\nforced vibrations. System measurements\n\nare made using optical transducers that\nare fixed to the case. Measurements made\nin this way are the equivalent of those 0btained by placing three surface-normaldisplacement transducers at different p0sitions on each blade of a bladed stage.\nThe system directly digitizes a time deflection history containing a minimum of\n2,048 points for each of the three measurement locations on each blade. For a\n64-blade rotor operating at 18,000 rpm,\n393,216 data points are taken in a minimum sampling period of 70 ms. Alternate\nmodes of operation can expand the sampling period or acquire additional data from\nonly selected subsets of the blading. Provisions within the design automatically correct the data points for variations in rotor\nspeed, nominal blade-to-blade and instrumentation probe misalinements, and\neither blade data points that are missed or\nextraneous blade data generated by foreign objects passing the optical probes.\nThis work was done by Louis J.

Any rotational movement\nof the main pin traps a secondary pin.\nwhich then prevents further rotation and\ndisengagement of the main pin.\nThe secondary pin is inserted in a flange\non the main pin (see figure). The main and\nsecondary pins are inserted in a recepta\xc2\xb7\ncle in which a pair of rotating disks engage\nhelical grooves on the main pin. An O\xc2\xb7ring\nhelps to prevent the pins from rotating by\nexerting friction. A pull on the main pin can\nonly force it out if the pin could spiral out by\nrotating between the disks. However. the\nsecondary pin. secure in its own hole in the\nreceptacle, prevents the main pin from rotating. Moreover, the rotational force of the\nmain pin would also act on the secondary\npin, pressing it against its wall and locking it\neven more securely in its hole.\nA lanyard with end strands of different\nlengths can be used to extract the pull pin.\nA pull on the lanyard would first apply ten\xc2\xb7\nsion to the shorter strand, which is at\xc2\xb7\ntached to the secondary pin. The tension\nwould pull the secondary pin out of its hole.\nThe tension would then shift to the longer\nstrand attached to the main pin.

The\nblanket is built up from layers of silicon carbide cloth . The loose weave of a single\nlayer passes 30 to 35 percent of the incident thermal radiation .\nThe layers are stacked in order of diminishing area, with the greatest thickness at\nthe center. This thickness profile delays the\nheating of the middle but allows heat to be\nradiated quickly to the periphery of the\nspecimen, which is ordinarily hard to heat\nbecause of the cold chamber wall and unevenness of the lamp reflectors.\nThe blanket allows one to use the entire\nchamber area. It smooths out the temperature gradients that would otherwise be\ncaused by uneven reflector or sample surfaces, or by the differing emissivities. Since\nedge effects are reduced, the area of the\ninsulation specimen can be as large as the\nlamp array. A temperature probe is positioned at the center of the specimen.

Twodimensional roughness elements in laminar boundary layers are strategically\nshaped to increase the critical (allowable)\nheight of the roughness. This would facilitate the installation of the leading-edge devices by practical manufacturing methods.\nModern airframe construction methods\ninvolving bonded or milled aluminum skins\nor cpmposite skins are sufficiently free\nfrom roughness or waviness for successful\nuse of NLF for drag reduction. However,\ncurrently accepted NLF wing-design practices exclude the installation of leadingedge devices to preserve the smoothness\nof the leading edge so that laminar flow\ncan be maintained. On modern production\nairplane wings, an orthogonal step (forward or aft facing) or a gap typically results\nat the joint between the main skin panels\nand the leading edge. These steps or gaps\ntypically are sufficiently large to cause the\ntransition of the laminar boundary layer to\na turbulent boundary layer at the protuber132\n\nRegion of Free\nI\nShear Flow Over ~\nSeparation Bubbles\n\nTurbulent or\nLaminar\nReattachment\nof Boundary\nLayer\n\nFigure 1. laminar Separation Bubbles caused by a conventional two-dimensional roughness element step force the boundary layer off the surface, which can result in transition\nto a turbulent boundary layer.\n\nance, greatly increasing the wing drag.\nThe principal manufacturing challenge\nis to produce wings with skin joints that\nmeet the allowable step- or gap-size requirements for laminar flow.

It measures the tank air (or other gas)\npressure and the time required for the\npressure to change from one preselected\nlevel to another. This time measurement is\ndirectly proportional to the volume of air. A\ndata processor computes the relative volumes of air and fuel in the tank.\nConventional gages measure the level\nof the surface of the fuel at one or more locations in the tank. However, variations in\nfuel level due to sloshing and to changes in\nattitude and acceleration of the vehicle, especially in the shallow fuel tanks in airplane\nwings, lead to hazardous errors in the indication of the quantity of fuel remaining.\nThe new gage controls the flow of air (or\nother gas) into and out of the space above\nthe fuel in the tank and measures the pressure in the tank. The gage has the capability to reverse the direction of flow at selected pressure levels. A timer and data\nprocessing device measures the time interval required for the pressure in the tank\nto change between two preselected levels.\nThe volume of fuel remaining in the tank is\ncomputed by the data processor from the\nvalue of this time interval.\nFigure 1 shows a laboratory model of a\ngage. Details of the timerldata processor\nare shown in Figure 2.\nThe fuel tank is supplied with air from a\nNASA Tech Briefs.

The direction of airflow is controlled by a solenoid\nvalve that, when energized, allows air to\nflow from the pressure supply to the tank\nthrough a restriction. When not energized,\nthe solenoid vents the tank to the atmosphere through the same restriction.\nThe pressure switch consists of a dia-\n\nphragm. exposed on its lower side to the\ntank pressure. in contact with a microswitch. This assembly has mechanical hysteresis, so that the switch snaps CNer to one\ncootact W1en the pressure in the tank reaches\napproximately 0.4 psi (2.8 X 103 N/m2)\nand drops back to the other contact when\nthe pressure is reduced to about 0.2 psi\n133\n\n(1.4 X 103 N/m2). It is connected to the\n\nsolenoid valve in such a way that the pressure in the tank is cycled up and down continuously between these two levels.\nThe timer/data processor is also connected to the contacts of the pressure\nswitch and converts the time required for\nthe tank pressure to rise from 0.2 psi to 0.4 psi\ninto a proportional measure of the volume\nof air in the tank. This value is subtracted\nfrom the known total tank volume to obtain\nthe value of the fuel volume, which is then\ndisplayed on the digital indicator.\nFor example, when used with a 3O-gal\n(114-1) tank, the counter is loaded with the\nnumber " 30.0" during the time when the\ntank is vented to the atmosphere. The oscillator is disabled during this time of the cycle. As soon as the pressure switch indicates the low limit of 0.2 psi, the solenoid\nvalve is actuated to increase the tank pressure, and the oscillator is turned on so that\nthe counter starts counting down from\n30.0. When the upper pressure lim~ of 0.4 psi\nis reached, the solenoid valve cuts off the\nair pressure supply and vents the tank to\nthe atmosphere. At the same time, the oscillator is again disabled, and the number\nremaining in the counter is transferred to\nthe internal latch in the digital display assembly where it remains and is displayed\nuntil the next cycle is completed.

Accordingly, a technique and system have been\ndeveloped for the dynamic calibration of\npressure transducers at cryogenic\ntemperatures.\nThe dynamic calibration system is\nbased on the reciprocation of a sealed\nmetal bellows that produces a sinusoidal\npressure with a calculable peak-to-peak\nvalue. Given the linear bellows displacement L, the volume V of the transducerbellows assembly, the bellows cross134\n\n+\n\no\no\n\nTransducers\n\nCryogenic Environmental\nChamber\n\nTo Calibrate Transducers immersed in a cryogenic environment, a sealed reciprocating\nbellows generates a sinusoidal dynamic pressure.

The bellows is reciprocated\nusing a small vibration generator mounted\noutside the cryogenic chamber and linked\nto the bellows by a steel drive rod. Dynamic\npressure is controlled by adjusting the\nstatic helium pressure in the bellows and\nby controlling the amplitude of the vibration . The vibration generator, helium\npressure-control valves, and instrumentation are located outside the environmental\nchamber.\nThe linear displacement of the bellows\nis measured using a proximity probe\nmounted on the drive rod. The transducer\noutputs are measured and recorded using\na digital storage oscilloscope. The temperature inside the chamber is measured using a copper/constantan thermocouple,\nand the static helium pressure inside the\nbellows is measured using a digital pres-\n\nsure gage connected to the bellows\nthrough a tube.\nThe system has a dynamic pressure\nmeasurement uncertainty of approximately 11 percent and is capable of producing a\npeak-to-peak dynamic pressure amplitude\nof 1.4 kPa over a frequency range of 40 to\n100 Hz and a temperature range of 100 to\n300 K It provides an unprecedented capability of both static and dynamic calibration\nof pressure transducers from ambient to\ncryogenic temperatures.\nThis work was done by Barry II Gibbens\nof Langley Research Center.

Similar in operating principle to dot-matrix\nprinters, the two methods use electronically actuated pins to reproduce characters\nfrom information stored on magnetic tape.\nIn the first method, one or more pins\nwould be scanned over a blank page and\nenergized at intervals to emboss the text\non paper, one or more dots at a time. The\npins could be driven by solenoids, piezoelectric transducers, or pneumatic actuators. Inexpensive paper could be used for a\none-time reading, or more durable material\ncould be used for a permanent record.\nLow-definition graphics would also be possible. If speed were not important, this\nprinter would be simple and inexpensive to\nproduce.\nThe text for the printer would be read\nfrom a tape in a form that would directly\nproduce the braille characters and would\nbe fed into a RAM buffer one or more\npages at a time. The paper would be roller\nfed using a constant speed motor, and the\nsolenoid-operated embossing pins would\nbe scanned across the page by a lead\nscrew or cable drive operated by the same\nmotor. Optical pickoffs on the two drives\nwould address the buffer to produce the\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nBuffer\nLoading\nLogic\n\n-\n\nThe Braille "Mouse" could be used to step through the addresses of the RAM using an optical pickoff disk.\n\n135\n\nembossed dots in the proper sequence to\nbuild up the desired characters . The\nmachine could be arranged so that a person could read the text as it emerged from\nthe embosser.\nlri the second approach, a hand-held device containing one or more charactergenerator cells would be used by the\nreader to scan the lines of text manually.\nThis device, which is illustrated in the figure, would be similar to the "mouse" used\nas a computer input device. It would be\nswept manually over a flat surface and\nwould scan through the character addresses of the RAM containing the text by\nmeans of a wheel running on the flat surface and driving an optical pickoff disk,\nwhich consecutively steps through the ad-\n\ndresses of the RAM. As the RAM addresses are stepped through , the character contained in each address is presented\nto the reader\'s fingers by the character\ngenerator in much the same way as if he or\nshe had run the fingers over an embossed\nseries of characters. Several consecutive\ncharacters could be presented at one time,\nusing several character-generator cells on\nthe mouse, to speed up the reading process.\nA conventional mouse operates in two\ndimensions using two orthogonally oriented pickoff wheels. It would be easy for\nthe blind reader, using a two-dimensional\nscan, .to run off a "line of print. " It may be\npreferable, however, not to define line\nlength at all, but to simply store the characters in memory in a single line. The mouse\n\nwould then be constructed with a Single\npickoff wheel, oriented for horizontal motion, which would step through the RAM\ncontinuously from beginning to end. When\nthe reader reached a convenient point in\nthe text, he or she would simply lift the\nmouse and return it to the left-hand side of\nthe work area and thus start a new "line."\nThe mouse could also be "backed up" to\ncatch any missed characters.\nThis work was done by H.

The LVDT is contained completely\nwithin the actuator. The actuator was originally developed for use in the wind-tunnel\nmodel-helicopter suspension system at\nLangley Research Center. This system requires precise positioning and position\nreadout for computer control of model motions. Minimal space is available for motion\ncylinders, and precise, continuous position\nreadout (with no steps or pulses) is required. This device provides continuous\nand accurate position indication of a hy-\n\ndraulic cylinder by means of an integral,\ncoaxially mounted LVDT.\nThe LVDT (see figure) produces an electrical output proportional to the displacement of its movable iron core relative to its\nsurrounding coils. The core support rod is\nscrewed into the base of the barrel, and the\ncoil portion is welded into the piston rod\nwith the wires exiting beyond the rod seal\narea.\nWhen the piston of the actuator is extended and retracted, the coils of the LVDT\nmove back and forth over the fixed core,\nvarying the electrical output of the LVDT for\na remote readout of the exact distance that\nthe actuator rod is extended.\n\nThe LVDT is compact and does not require dynamic seals against hydraulic\npressure or any electronics mounted on\nthe actuator. This actuator, as a result, is no\nlarger than it would be without position indication. The LVDT is completely enclosed\nand protected from abuse, and the continuous position indication provided is the\nmost accurate and repeatable currently\navailable.\nThis work was done by Garland 0.\nGoodwin of Kentron International, Inc., for\nLangley Research Center.

The\nadaptation makes it unnecessary to install\na separate displacement sensor, which\nwould require an additional access port on\nthe pump. The combined speed/displacement sensor would be used for performance analysis and for pump control.\nThe modified sensor exploits an effect\nthat is ordinarily considered a less desirable\nfeature of magnetic speed sensors - the\ndecrease in output voltage with increasing\nsensor gap. The adaptation consists of\nbeveling certain lobes on the shaft-speed\nencoder nut. For example, lobes 2 and 4 on\na four-lobe nut can be beveled, the bevel\non lobe 2 being on a side opposite the bevel\non lobe 4 (see figure). Axial displacement of\nthe shaft then alters the gap between those\nlobes and the sensor tip, with a consequent\nalteration in the output waveform.\nIn the example of the figure, axial shaft\nmotion to the right makes lobe 2 pass\ncloser to the tip, while lobe 4 passes farther\nfrom it. The pulse output at lobe 2 then increases while that of lobe 4 decreases.\nConversely, a shaft motion to the left is indicated by an increase in sensor pulse output at lobe 4 and a decreased output at\nlobe 2.\nThis work was done by Arthur J.

Experiments have\ndemonstrated that extremely small\namounts of cracklike damage can be readily detected in small specimen cross secNASA Tech Bri efs, Winter 1985\n\ntions 0.125 in. (3.18 mm) in diameter. Also,\nthere is an optimum exposure time for accurate results.\nThe ne\'N method uses data from tests\non specimen sets that are exposed to a\ncorrosive environment at several levels of\napplied static tensile stress for selected exposure times and then subsequently ten-\n\nsile tested to failure. The breaking loads\nare converted to an "apparent" tensile\nstrength for further analysis. Comparing\nthese data with similar data from control\nspecimens, both unexposed and exposed\nunstressed to the corrosive environment,\nmakes it possible to separate the stresscorrosion cracking response from general\n137\n\nor localized corrosion.\nThe breaking-strength data with the alloy strength and toughness values are\nused in a new elasticlplastic fracturemechanics model to calculate an "effective flaw size." This estimation of the flaw\ndepth and growth rate is used to rate the\nstress-corrosion-cracking performance of\ncorrosion-resistant alloys. The results are\nnot biased by the material strength and\nfracture toughness or the test specimen\nsize.\nThe breaking-strength data are further\nanalyzed by an extreme-value statistical\nmethod to get survival probabilities and\nstatistically defined stress-corrosion\ncracking threshold stresses for the sample\n\nmaterial. These stress-corrosion performance ratings tend to be significantly\nmore discriminating than those obtained\nfrom traditional passlfail analysis of\nsmooth specimen data.\nThese new test procedures were used\nto investigate three tempers of 7075 aluminum alloy plate. The predicted combinations of breaking strength and flaw depth\nagree very well with actual measurements\nmade on tensile specimens 0.125 and\n0.225 in. (3.18 and 5.72 mm) in diameter\ncontaining "small" flaws introduced by\neither fatigue or stress-corrosion cracking.\nThis method is potentially applicable to\nother degrading phenomena (such as fatigue, corrosion fatigue, fretting, wear, and\n\ncreep) that promote the development and\ngrowth of cracklike flaws within a material.\nThis work was done by the Aluminum\nCompany of America for Langley Research Center.

Characteristically,\nthese devices lose sensitivity with increased frequency because of the length\nand diameter of the tube, the acoustic impedance of the microphone cartridge, and\nthe volume between the microphone diaphragm and the tube-terminating volume.\nSmall condenser microphones also have\nbeen used for aeroacoustic measurements, but t11ese suffer significant aeroacoustic disturbances because the adapters and preamplifier must be very close to\nthe microphone.\nA critical requirement for such a microphone probe tube is that it be small and\naerodynamically shaped to minimize aeroacoustic disturbances that distort the\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the\nneed for accurate, stable amplitude and\nphase calibration and uniform sensitivity\nover the frequency range of interest requires that the sensing element be located\nvery near the probe-sensing ports.\nThese design requirements are achieved\nby a new microphone adapter that permits\nthe installation of a commerCially available\ncondenser microphone 1/8 inch (3 mm) in\ndiameter at the location of the sensing\nports, with a remotely located preamplifier.\nThe microphone has a high-impedance\nsource and a low-level electrical output signal; therefore, the adapter was designed\nwith a mininum capacitance to avoid degradation of microphone sensitivity.

The system measures differences in elevdtm to within 0.002 in.(0.05 rrm).\nIn conventional leveling, a pair of telescopes are alined in the same plane by\nsighting them on a vertical scale. Operators at both telescopes then sight on the\ndesignated index marks on the part to be\nleveled. They direct another operator at a\nhoist or other lifting device to raise or lower\none end of the part until the index marks\nare in the plane of the scopes. At this point,\nthe part is known to be level.\nWith the new system, floats in water reseMlirs are suspended at index p:>ints on 0pposite ends of the part to be leveled (see figure). The floats are attached to core rods in\nthe windings of linear variable-differential\ntransformers (LVOT\'s). The output voltage\nof each LVOT is proportional to the difference in height between the middle of the\ncore rod and the middle of the winding.\nSince the reservoirs are connected to the\nsame water supply, the water in them is at\nthe same level. Thus, if the part is out of\nlevel - that is, if one end is higher than the\nother - the voltages of the LVOT\' s will be\ndifferent. On the other hand, if the part is\nlevel, the voltages will be identical.\nThe electrical outputs and the water\nsupply are connected to a console. EJectronic circuitry in the console converts the\nLVOT outputs into a level difference and\ndisplays the value to the operator on a digital indicator. The console also illuminates\nlamps that tell the operator in which direction to move the part to restore levelness.\nA small pump on the console fills the\nreservoirs.

The system incorporates a special valve into the\nmanifold in such a way that the leaks and\ncontamination problems of previous systems , which use tees and three -port\nvalves, are minimized or eliminated in both\nthe main manifold line and in the supply\nline.\nFigure 1 shows the new valve. The primary difference between this design and\nthat of the three-port valve consists of the\naddition of the fourth port, marked "A" on\nthe figure. This port virtually eliminates the\ndead airspace present on the supply side\nof the three-port valve in the closed position . Thus, a continuous flow of vapor from\nthe supply line through line "A" thoroughly\npurges contaminants that may initially remain in the valve when it is closed.\nIn addition, a continuous flow is permitted through the main manifold line whether\nthe valve is in the open or closed position.\nWhen the valve is closed, there is no intermixing between the two lines, and virtually\nno dead airspace exists in the manifold\nmain line or in the supplylpurge line. When\nthe valve is open, the two gas flows can intermix. Therefore, this valve constitutes a\ncross fitting when it is open and two separate lines when it is closed.\nFigure 2 shows a system incorporating\na gaseous source and the four-port valve\nas the manifold valve. With the manifold\nvalve closed and the purge valve open, the\nmass-flow controller is adjusted to the desired flow. The purge valve is then closed\nand the manifold valve opened to introduce the vapor to the manifold. When the\nvapor is no longer desired in the manifold,\nthe manifold valve is closed and the purge\nvalve opened to flush out any contaminating vapors that entered the supply line from\nthe manifold.\nThe manifold is currently being used at\nLangley Research Center to upgrade a\nNASA-owned chemical vapor-deposition\nsystem. It should be of considerable use in\ngas manifold systems where even small\namounts of gaseous impurities constitute a\nproblem or where more than one gaseous\nmaterial is used in a single system.\nThis work was done by Ivan 0.

Its thermal conductivity is\nonly one-seventh that of aluminum, and it\ncan therefore be used when a high thermal\nresistance is needed to prevent boiling of\nthe working fluid.\nIn a study, sintered titanium powder\nwicks were prepared under a variety of\nconditions. The wicks were tested to identify those conditions that yield the best\n\nwicking characteristics. The key sintering\nconditions were titanium particle size, alloy\nconstituents, time, pressure, and temperature. The best wicks were subjected to further measurements of such properties as\nthermal conductivity, density, pore size,\nand permeability.\nAn all-titanium heat pipe was made with\nthe best type of wick. Such characteristics\nas heat flux, evaporator temperature drop,\nand life expectancy were measured. Data\nwere gathered for a variety of working\n\nfluids: Acetone, ammonia, water, and\nchlorofluoromethanes.\nThis work was done by Robert\nShaubach, G. Yale Eastman, and Donald\nM.

Moffett Field, California\nA microphone for measuring aircraft\nengine noise is mounted on a lengthwise\nboom that is supported away from the\nfuselage and engine (see Figure 1). This\nconfiguration minimizes the boundarylayer effects and pressure doubling that\nwould be present if the microphone were\nmounted in the aircraft fuselage.\nThe microphone is mounted inside the\nboom with the diaphragm flush with the\noutside edge and facing the noise source\nparallel to the airflow (see Figure 2).

It has\nbeen proposed to control temperature in\nspacecraft and in supersonic missiles to\nprotect internal electronics. In combination with conventional heat pipes, it can be\nused in solar panels and other heatsensitive systems.\nThe diode sandwich panel (see figure)\nconsists of face sheets lined with wicking\nmaterial on a honeycomb core that is constructed from wicking material. The lower\nwick has smaller capillaries than the upper\nwick to ensure that the capillary force is\ngreater in the direction of the lower wick.\nThe honeycomb wick has pores of the\nsame or larger size than those of the lower\nwick but has pores smaller than those of\nthe upper wick. The entire sandwich panel\nis welded shut by sidewalls, hermetically\nsealing the panel.\nA processing tube is provided for filling\nthe panel with working fluid and for processing. During processing, the panel is\nfilled with working fluid of sufficient quantity\nto saturate the lower wick only, the upper\nwick remaining dry. Then, all noncondensable gases are pumped out, leaving the\nworking fluid and its vapor inside the panel.\nDuring the processing of heat pipes, noncondensable gases flow to the cold end\n(condenser) and are pumped out. In a\nhoneycomb sandwich panel, it is very difficult to confine noncondensable gases\nnear the exhaust port to permit their removal. The processing tube, which is lined\ninternally with a wick, is welded onto the\nsandwich panel. During processing, this\ntube is cooled, and the entire vapor chamber becomes an evaporator; the processing tube then becomes a condenser and a\n142\n\ntrap for noncondensable gases. The trapped\nnon condensable gas can then be evacuated to complete heat-pipe proceSSing.\nWhen heat is applied to the lower face of\nthe panel, fluid evaporates and condenses\nat the top. Then the condensate returns to\nthe lower wick by capillary action, producing normal heat-pipe operation. When heat\nis applied at the top, fluid evaporates and is\ntrapped in the lower wick. Since the capillary forces are greater at the lower wick,\nfluid remains at the bottom. The upper wick\n\ndries out, and heat-pipe action (heat transer) stops. Thus the heat-pipe sandwich\npanel becomes a thermal insulator. The\nterms "top," " bottom," "upper," and\n"lower" are used here to simplify the explanation of the panel\'s performance. This\ndevice will operate in zero gravity or any\norientation in a 1-g field.\nThis work was done by Algerd Basiulis\nof Hughes Aircraft Co. for Langley Research Center.

This pulsation not only creates unrealistic flow in the\ntunnel, but it also induces unsafe resonances in some model/sting systems.\nAn interim solution to this problem was\nthe installation of staggered triangular\nvanes around the perimeter of the jet exit\nnozzle. However, these vanes increased\nthe background noise levels above 5 kHz\nby 10 to 20 dB.\nThe vane-induced noise was reduced\nby adhering a thin layer of porous material\nsuch as foam to the downwind surface of\nthe vanes, particularly near the sharp trailing edges, to prevent the occurrence of\nedge tones (see Figure 1). Other modifica\xc2\xb7\ntions made to aerodynamically streamline\nthe vane structure were rounding the leading edges and smoothly fairing the trailing\nedges. A boundary layer trip was applied to\nthe leading edge to prevent laminar tone\nshedding from the trailing edge.\nMeasurements of background noise in\nthe open test section were made with the\nmodified vane structure and compared to\nbackground noise measured with th~ untreated vanes and the "clear tunnel." Figure 2 shows the measured background\nnoise levels for an inflow location at a tunnel speed of 120 kn (62 m/s). The effect of\nthe treatment is to reduce noise levels by\n10 to 20 dB in the higher frequency range.\nOnline observations of the velocity fluctua\xc2\xb7\ntions with the treated vanes installed con\xc2\xb7\nfirmed that the pulsation was favorably\nreduced.\nThis work was done by Ruth M.

A\nconventional squeeze-film damper would\nbe overloaded and no longer effective in\ncontrolling vibration amplitudes and bearing forces if the shaft imbalance would rise\nappreciably above the design value of the\ndamper. The new damper under normal\nconditions uses only one low-clearance\nfilm. Under high imbalance, both films are\nactive, controlling shaft vibration in a nearoptimum manner and allowing continued\noperation until a safe shutdown can be\nmade.\nAs shown in the figure, both squeezefilm dampers operate in series. During normal operation, the sleeve separating the\ntwo damper films is fixed in place by two or\nmore shearpins. Only the inner film is active; behavior is then identical to that of the\nsingle-film damper. The clearance is only\nas high as is required for the rotor imbalance likely to occur in normal operation;\nthus, the rotor radial location can be closely controlled.\nIn the event of rotor-blade loss or some\nother occurrence that increases the imbalance, the damper load rises until the\nstrength of the shearpins is exceeded.

The\ntwo films then operate in series; that is, the\nbearing load is transmitted first through the\ninner film, then through the sleeve and\nouter film to the machine structure. The\nouter film will generally have a larger clearance than the inner film to accommodate\nthe larger amplitude of motion necessarily\naccompanying the higher imbalance. The\nil\')ner and outer dampers will continue to\noperate together until the imbalance is corrected and new shearpins are installed.\nOil-supply passages are not shown in\nthe figure; however, oil is typically supplied\nthrough a feed hole in the outer side of the\nouter film.

Refer to MFS-27086.\n\nadvantage of high mass flow per frontal\narea, it can give very good aerodynamic\nperformance. However, good aerodynamic\nperformance over an acceptable range of\noperating conditions is not easily attained.\nBoth experimental and analytical programs can be used in the development\nprocess for multistage axial-flow compressors. Since compressor experimental\ndevelopment in test facilities is expensive\nand time consuming, any inSight into the\nonset and location of troublesome flow\nregimes that can reduce the amount of testing is very valuable. One natural information\nsource is experimental data from similar\ncompressor stages. But such data in sufficient detail are rarely available. New compressors are usually extrapolations from the\ndata of their predecessors.\nAnalytical methods that contain good\nflow modeling are an alternative way of\ngaining the insight needed for compressor\ndevelopment. There are several levels of s0phistication for anC\\lytical programs; but in\ngeneral, only the level of sophistication required to evaluate the relevant flow phenomenon is desired in order to minimize\ncomplexity and to give high computational\nefficiency. Compared with other more s0phisticated two- and three-dimensional\nmodels for compressor flow, the stagestacking method is very simple. The simplicity of a one-dimensional compressible flow\nmodel enables the stage-stacking method\nto have excellent convergence properties\nand short computer run time. The simplicity\nof the model results in manageable computer codes that ease the incorporation of\ncorrelations directly linked to experimental\ntest data to directly model real flow\nphenomena.\nThe stage-stacking computer code was\ndeveloped and used at the Lewis Research\nCenter during the past several years. It has\nbeen routinely used to generate performance maps for compressors evaluated experimentally. The performance predictions\n\nof the code have agreed with the measured\nperformance. The code either accepts nondimensional stage characteristics as input\nor calculates these characteristics from\naerodynamic input available from compressor design codes.\nMany of the code options use correlations that are normally obtained from experimental data. These empirical correlations\npermit modeling of the trends in stage and\noverall performance by a simple onedimensional, stage-stacking technique.\nHowever, the correlations may only be accurately applied to predict the performance\nof compressors similar to those used in deriving the empirical correlations. The code is\ndeveloped so that users may modify the correlations to suit their needs.\nFor off-design compressor performance\nprediction, the main features of the stagestacking method are simplicity, fast convergence, and the ability to directly incorporate correlations from experimental data\nto model real flow conditions. The method\nused has the follOWing properties:\n1. It is a orte-dimensional, compressibleflow model with fast convergence;\n2. Overall stage performance is represented by meanline velocity diagrams at\nthe rotor inlet and outlet;\n3. It includes options to calculate the stage\ncharacteristics and to adjust them for\nblade reset and real flow effects;\n4. Experimental test data can be applied directly to correlations that model real flow\nconditions; and\n5. Accurate off-design predictions can be\nmade for a limited range of compressors.\nThe computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for use on an IBM 370 computer.\nFor a related computer code see the following article.\nThis program was written by Ronald J.\nSteinke of Lewis Research Center.

The\ncode uses a meanline stage-stacking\nmethod; stage and cumulative compressor\nperformance is calculated utilizing representative triangles located at rotor inlet and\noutlet mean radii.\nThe aerothermomechanical interactions\narising during airlwater droplet mixture flow\nare taken into accbunt in terms of four processes: (1) Changes in blade performance\nparameters (deviation and efficiency), (2)\ncentrifugal action due to flow rotation, (3)\nheat and mass transfer processes between\nthe gaseous and liquid phases, and (4) droplet instability and breakup. The last three are\nintroduced at the exit of ~ch blade row. The\naerodynamic performance of a stage is\nbased on estimated rules for deviation and\nefficiency with airlwater mixture flO\'N.\nWater ingestion into jet engines may\narise due to various circumstantial reasons:\nHigh humidity in the air resulting in condensation of water at the inlet, tire-generated\nspray entering the airstream during takeoff\nand landing on rough runways with puddles\nof water, and flight through rainstorms. It has\nbeen found that such water ingestion can\nlead to a loss of performance, engine mismatch, loss of surge margin, and, in some\ncases, undesirable mechanical and aeroelastic effects. Both steady-state and transient performances are affected as well as\nthe operational margins in the control system.

LEW-14026\n\nFlow Through Gas-Turbine\nDucts\nIt describes ducts with struts,\nvanes, and 90\xc2\xb0 bends.\nAn existing computer program, the Axisymmetric Diffuser Duct code (ADD code),\nwhich calculates compressible turbulent\nswirling flO\'N through axisymmetric ducts,\nhas been modified to permit calculation of\nflows through small gas-turbine ducts with\nstruts, guide vanes, and large degrees of\ntuming. The code improvements include a\nnew coordinate generator, an endwallioss\nmodel, and a generalized geometry capability to describe struts and guide vanes in\nducts that turn more than 90 degrees. An\nimproved output format has been developed to provide the solution on any arbitrary plane in the duct.\nThe ADD code has produced accurate\nand reliable calculations of flows in gas-turbine engine components. It has been successfully applied to predicting the performance of the subsonic portion of mixed\ncompression inlets and to predicting the\npressure recovery of high-mach-number\ndiffusers. Additional applications have\nbeen to straight-wall annular diffusers, effects of inlet distortion on diffuser performance, and mixing of two coaxial streams,\nand further calculations were made for\nswirling flO\'N in a precombustion diffuser\nand for an inlet with inlet guide vanes.\nFinally, the ADD code has been applied\nto the solution of flows in small axial-flow\nturbines and has been modified to treat\nflows with a small separation bubble, flows\nwith large compressible axisymmetric\nstreamline curvatures, and non equilibrium\nturbulent flows that require a two-equation\n{k, \xc2\xa3} turbulence model.\nThe ADD code can be applied to the solution of flows in annular ducts that have\nsignificant radial flow components as\nfound in small gas-tUrbine engines. An algorithm is used to calculate the coordinate\nmesh with no restrictions as to flO\'N tuming\nin the axisymmetric plane. It employs a\nsecond-order integration formula that exactly integrates the singularities (poles)\nthat occur at each corner of the n-sided\npolygon used to represent the duct with a\nSchwartz-Christoffel transformation. This\nmethod is used to generate a coordinate\nmesh that is constructed from the streamlines and potential lines of the plane\npotential-flO\'N solution.\n\nIn the present approach, strut and\nguide-vane effects appear in the governing\nturbulent-flow equations as gap-averaged\na priori I::xxly forces. These I::xxly forces are\nobtained using blade-element theory,\nwhich treats the mainstream flO\'N through\nthe cascade as if it were two-dimensional\nand inviscid. The airfoil section cascade\nperformance is obtained using empirical\ndata.\nThe present version of the ADD code\ncontains these empirical relations for National Mvisory Committee for Aeronautics\n(NACA) 65 series airfoils and NACA fourdigit series airfoils. This procedure using\nthe ADD code produces good predictions\nof the flow field through a compressor inlet\nguide vane. In particular, the exit flow\nangles, the mean streamwise velocities,\nand the mean crossflow velocities in the\nendwall boundary layer were shO\'Nn to be\nmodeled quite well _The loss mechanism,\nhowever, accounted only for blade profile\nloss and endwall friction loss. Asimple endwall loss model to account for threedimensional effects in the blade passage\nbased on the Papailiou correlation has\nbeen incorporated into the code.\nThe calculated flow properties can be\npresented along the coordinate potential\nlines or arbitrary output lines. This option is\nspecified by the user and allows the ADD\ncode output to be readily compared to data\ntaken in nonorthogonal coordinates.

Accurate determination of the radiant flux is necessary for\nengineering analyses. The central program of this system (VI EWC) computes the\nlongwave radiant-energy exchange factors between the surfaces that make up an\nenclosure. Other VIEW programs support\nthe user working with VIEWC.\nVIEWC computes the view factors between surfaces. These views may be obstructed either by other surfaces or by the\nsurfaces for which the view factors are being computed. The view factors are generally computed by the contour-integration\ntechnique originally developed by Mittalas\nand Stevenson. When there is the possibility\nthat the radiation between any two surfaces is obstructed, their view factor is usually calculated by a double-area-integral\ntechnique because of the difficulties in defining the contour.\nStructures are defined to VIEWC in\nterms of a collection of flat surfaces, each\nof which has three or four edges (i.e., a triangle or a quadrilateral). There are several\nways to enter the data for VIEWC. One way\nis compatible with the usual finite-element\nsurface definitions, allowing the use of\nfinite-element mesh generation programs\nto create input for VIEWC. The VIEWCI program eliminates excess common nodes in\nfree-form data input, thus reducing the\namount of storage required.\nVIEWI is an interactive graphics program for generating the surface information needed for VIEWC. The surfaces may\n\nbe generated Singly or in groups, and the\nuser may manipulate them to create the\ndesired structure. VIEWI may also be\nused to generate finite-element, twodimensional meshes.\nVIEWCM combines the output from two\nVIEWI sessions to make a composite body.\nVIEWG provides interactive graphical display of the surfaces generated by VIEWI ,\nwith full hidden-line removal and storage of\nthe picture for high-speed processing (e.g.,\nrapid rotation or perspective viewing of the\nstructure).\nVI EWS computes the solar radiation failing on a structure and the solar radiation\nthat is reflected from the Earth (albedo). Input is the same as VIEWC, with additional\ndata on the position of the structure with respect to the Sun and Earth. VIEWS runs in\neither batch or interactive mode and computes the solar load as a function of orbital\nposition . Output from VIEWS includes:\nSolar view factor, Earth\'s longwave view\nfactor, reflected solar view factor, and total\nsolar load_\nThe VIEW programs are written in FORTRAN 77 for batch and interactive execution. They have been implemented on a\nCDC 6OOO-series computer with the largest program having a central-memory requirement of approximately 220K (octal) of\n50-bit words. The graphics routines are\nbased on the Tektronix PLOT10 system\nand assume the use of Tektronix 4010 terminals or emulators. Version 5.5 of VIEW\nwas released in 1984.\nThis program was written by Ashley F.\nEmery of the University of Washington for\nlangley Research Center.

The program is intended\nfor control analysis. The associated engine\nmodel has been simplified to shorten computer calculation time. The model includes\nengine mechanical-drive dynamics and\nvehicle-load effects. The computer program also includes subroutines that allow\n(1) acceleration of the engine by addition of\nhydrogen to the system and (2) braking of\nthe engine by short circuiting of the working spaces. Subroutines to calcuiate degraded engine performance (e.g., due to\npiston-ring and piston-rod leakage) are provided. The program is modular to allow\neasy modification of individual routines.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nProposed control schemes for fourcylinder Stirling engines require that the\nworking spaces not remain isolated. One\nsuch scheme is engine braking by short\ncircuiting. In this case, all four working\nspaces are connected to high- and lowpressure manifolds. Row enters or leaves\na working space depending on the pressure differential and the orientation of the\ncheck valves between the pressure manifolds and the working spaces. A complete\nfour -cylinder model was needed to analyze\nthis control problem.\nIn the model, four cylinders are interconnected by four working spaces. Each\nworking space contains three volumes one for the expansion space and the\nheater, one for the regenerator, and one for\nthe cooler and the compression space.\nEach volume is assumed to be at constant\ntemperature. Variations in volume temperature can be scheduled as a function of engine speed.\nDifferential forces on the pistons are\ntranslated into torque through the vehicle\ndrive geometry and summed to form total\ntorque. Torque due to engine friction is subtracted to form brake torque. This is available to drive the auxiliaries and the vehicle\nload. The vehicle inertia and the gear ratio\nare used to compute the effective load.\nThe summation of torques is integrated to\ngive engine speed and again to give crank\nangle. The crank angle is used to generate\npiston position. The model can be run in\nthis manner, or piston position can be inserted as a function of time with torque and\ncycle performance calculated at constant\nspeed.\nThe simulation is modular to allow for\neach modification of the model. An input\nroutine is provided in which the user specifies the transient to be run by setting\nswitches and supplying the proper geometric and engine data. The output is also\nselected by the user by setting a switch in\nthe input routine. A printout at the desired\nprintout increment can be selected.\nThe simulation has been run to generate\nboth steady-state and transient results.\nPower and torque predictions from the\nsimulation compare well with experimental\ndata over a wide range of engine speeds\nand pressures. The simulation is capable\nof predicting steady-state performance\nwith piston-ring leakage and short circuiting between the working spaces.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor use on an IBM 370 computer.\nThis program was written by Carl J.\nDaniele and Carl F. Lorenzo of Lewis Research Center.

The program can also accommodate a Significant variety of onedimensional heat-transfer problems that\ndo not correspond specifically to fin-type\napplications.\nThe objective was development of a\nrapid, efficient, and convenient computer\nprogram for solution of radiation fin problems in thermal analysis. Such problems\nare classified mathematically as double\nboundary-value problems. They are posed\nby an ordinary differential equation not\namenable to direct closed-form solution.\nPrior techniques involved laborious effort\nemploying parametric curves or, alternately, detailed numerical modeling for a\ngeneral-purpose heat transfer computer\nprogram. Prior techniques were extremely\ninefficient, and the parametric approach\ncould not accommodate lengthwise variations in thermophysical properties, environments, or geometry.\nThe heat-transfer application is represented by a second-order ordinary differential equation and is posed as a two-point\nboundary value problem. An implicit finitedifference method is used to approximate\nthe differential equation, and the NewtonRaphson method is employed with a tridiagonal linear equation technique to solve\nthe system of implicit difference equations.\nThe program computes fin-node temperature, while boundary-node temperatures are constrained. The vertical linkages may represent either radiation or\nconvection and could easily be contrived\nto represent conduction. Moreover, fin\nnodes may have additional heat flux and\nneed not have vertical linkages. Thus, the\nprogram can easily accommodate all but a\nfew specialized one-dimensional heattransfer analyses as well as many twodimensional analyses. However, it contains no special provision for computation\nof bol:mdary-condition heat rates.\nTemperature-dependent input data are\naccommodated by a simple namelist format. Graphical output data are displayed\ninteractively or in batch mode.\nThe program is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor the CYBER 172 computer. It can\nachieve an order-of-magnitude reduction\n\nSOLAR DYNAMIC\nPOWER SYSTEM\nSmall Scale Rankine Cycle Power Generation System is being\ndeveloped by Centrifugal Piston\nExpander Inc. to produce electrical power from any heat\nsource, incl uding solar energy,\nthrough the use of its Rotary Piston Expander/Engine Prototype\n(Pat.

The programs are set up to\nfind Hohmann-type solutions, with burns\nnear the perigee and apogee of the transfer orbit. They are not set up to find biellipticalor other non-Hohmann maneuver\ntypes. They will solve transfers with fairly long\nbum arcs but will not solve continuous-bum\nspiral transfers. They will solve "divided\nburn" transfers: Transfers in which the perigee (or apogee) burns are divided into repeated smaller perigee (or apogee) burns\nin order to reduce the average bum arc\nlength and improve transfer fuel efficiency.\n149\n\n~\n\nThe programs model the propulsion system as either constant thrust or constant\nacceleration. A spherical Earth gravity\nmodel is used.\nThe solutions obtained are optimal with\nrespect to fuel use; that is, the final mass of\nthe spacecraft is maximized with respect\nto the controls. The controls assumed here\nare the direction of thrust and the thrust\non/off times. The spacecraft continuously\nvaries its orientation during the burns so as\nto track the optimal thrust direction.\nTwo basic programs are given. The first,\nreferred to as the "exact solution," gives\ncomplete, exact time histories of transfers.\nThe exact spacecraft position, velocity,\nand optimal thrust direction are given\nthroughout the maneuver as are the optimal thrust switch points, transfer time, and\nfuel cost.\nThe exact solution programs are fairly\nlarge, iterative programs. Two versions are\ngiven: One for non coplanar (3-D) transfers\nand a faster version for transfers between\ncoplanar orbits (2-D transfers).\nThe second, or "approximate solution,"\nprogram gives approximate information on\nthe transfer time and fuel cost but provides\nno detail of the trajectory. The approximations are accurate for transfers when burn\narcs are relatively small.\nThe advantages of the approximate solution are that it is a much simpler and\nfaster program and that it has no difficulty\nconverging on a solution. The approximate\nsolution is used to estimate initial conditions for the exact solution. It can be used\nin divided-burn transfers to find best numbers of burns with respect to time. It is useful by itself in relatively efficient, short burnarc transfers. The programs are written in\nFORTRAN IV for use on a DEC computer.\nThis program was written by J.

The\nparameter is called the lubricant percent\nvolume or cavity factor (XCAV). It is used\nprimarily in the calculation of ball or roller\ndrag and, therefore, significantly affects\ncalculated bearing-heat generation and\ntemperature distribution.\n150\n\nAn equation for lubricant percent volume in the bearing cavity XCAV was derived based upon experimental data from\nthree sizes of angular-contact ball bearings\nrun over a range of speeds and lubricant\nflow rates. Previously, it had been established that values of XCAV in the range\nfrom 2 to 5 percent should be used, but little basis existed for selection of the actual\nvalue to be used. For more critical highspeed aerospace ball and roller bearing\napplications where jet lubrication or underrace lubrication is used, a more precise estimate of XCAV is required for reasonable\nthermal-performance predictions.\nBearing-heat generation and temperature distribution were calculated using the\ncomputer program SHABERTH, an existing program for analysis of shaft and bearing thermal performance [described in\n"Thermal Performance of Shaft Bearing\nSystems" (LEW-12761) on page 269 of\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 3, No. 2]. By comparing predicted and experimental heat\ngeneration and temperature, the following\nequation for XCAV was derived:\nXCAV = 8.62 x 105 Wo.37 N\xc2\xb71Dm\xc2\xb71 .7\neither jet or underrace lubrication. Using\nvalues of XCAV determined with this equation, the thermal performance of thrustloaded, angular-contact ball bearings can\nbe accurately predicted with the computer\nprogram SHABERTH. The new equation\naccounts for the sensitivity of XCAV to shaft\nspeed, lubricant flow rate, and bearing\nsize, and provides a Significant improvement over previous estimation methods.\nwhere W is the lubricant flow rate through\nthe bearing cavity, in gal/min; N is the shaft\nspeed, in rpm; and 0 is the bearing pitch\ndiameter, in in.\nThe equation was found to be valid for\nangular-contact ball bearings having bore\ndiameters ranging from 35 to 167 mm, with\nThis program was written by Richard J.\nParker of Lewis Research Center_ Further information may be found in NASA TP2275 [N84-18654INSP], "Comparison of\nPredicted and Experimental Thermal Performance of Angular Contact Ball Bearings"\n[$7].

This versatile program for\ncomprehensive flow-field analysis applies\nfinite-element methodology to nonlinear\nfield problems.\nA prime requirement in computational\nflow mechanics is flow prediction in juncture regions formed by the intersection of\naerodynamic surfaces, such as winglbody,\nwing/winglet, and pylon/wing. In most instances, the associated flow is threedimensional, subsonic wijh variable denSity,\nand turbulent. An order-of-magnitude analysis of the subsonic, three-dimensional,\nsteady time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for semibounded aerodynamic juncture geometries yields the parabolic\nNavier-Stokes equations . CMC3DPNS\nsolves these equations to predict the\njuncture-region flow.\nIn CMC3DPNS, the numerical solution\nof the pressure Poisson equation, resulting\nfrom the parabolic Navier-Stokes equations, is cast into complementary and particular parts, yielding an iterative interaction algorithm with an exterior threedimensional potential flow solution. A parabolic transverse momentum equation set\nis constructed, with robust enforcement of\nfirst-order continuity effects accomplished\nby a penalty differential constraint concept\nwithin a finite-element solution algorithm. A\nReynolds stress constitutive equation, with\nlow-turbulence ReynOlds-number wall\nfunctions, is employed for closure using\nparabolic forms of the two-equation, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation.\nCMC3DPNS is written in FORTRAN 77\nfor batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 205 computer\nwith a memory requirement of approximately 250K (octal) of 54-bit words. The\nCMC3DPNS code is not vectorized and\nshould be readily adaptable to the CDC\nCYBER 70/170-series computers with the\nFORTRAN V compiler.

WAVDRAG incorporates extended geometric\ninput capabilities to permit use of a more\naccurate mathematical model. With WAVDRAG, the engineer defines aircraft components as fusiform or nonfusiform in\nterms of traditional parallel contours or\nnonintersecting contours in any direction.\nIn addition, laterally asymmetric configurations can be simulated.\nThe calculations in WAVDRAGare based\non Whitcomb\'s area-rule computation of\nequivalent bodies, with modifications for\nsupersonic speed. Instead of using a single\nequivalent body, WAVDRAG calculates a\nseries of equivalent bodies, one for each\nroll angle. The total aircraft configuration\nwave drag is the integrated average of the\nequivalent-body wave drags through the\nfull roll range of 360 degrees.\nWAVDRAG currently accepts up to 30\nuser-defined components containing a\nmaximum of 50 contours as geometric input. Each contour contains a maximum of\n50 points. The mach number, angle of attack, and coordinates of angle-of-attack\nrotation are also input.

Alternatively, the system could heat equipment\nby delivering vapor and removing condensed liquid. The two-phase scheme,\nwhich was originally proposed for use on\nthe Space Shuttle, is effective for heat\ntransfer over long di~tances.\nWhen the system operates in the cooling mode, liquid is pumped to plates that\nabsorb the surrounding heat (see figure).\nThe plates contain capillary grooves\nthrough which the liquid flows, cooling the\nplates and the equipment mounted on\nthem. As the liquid absorbs heat from the\nplates, it evaporates into a vapor line and\npasses to a condenser. There, the liquid\ntransfers its heat to a radiator and condenses. The condensed liquid is recirculated by the pump.\nUquid flow is controlled by a valve on\neach plate. The valves may be conventional expansion valves like those in refrigerators. A valve would sense the plate temperature with a sensing bulb. As the bulb\ntemperature increases, its contents would\ncreate increasing pressure on a diaphragm in the valve, and the diaphragm\nwould open the valve to admit more liquid\nto the plate. Alternatively, the liquid flow\nmay be controlled by a valve equipped with\nan ultrasonic transducer that senses the\nliquid in the plate.\n\nIf the system is used to heat the plates,\nvapor would flow into the plates, where it\nwould release heat of condensation. A\ncontrol valve would admit the condensed\nliquid to a liquid-suction line, which would\nreturn it to the pump inlet for recirculation.\nThe two-phase system offers these advantages over a single-phase system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The loop would operate at a nearly constant temperature - with a differential\nof about 5\xc2\xb0 C instead of the 40\xc2\xb0 C of\nsingle-phase systems. Moreover, ali\nheat-transfer locations would operate at\nthe same temperatures, and equipment\ncould thus be placed on any plate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Less pumping would be needed because\nthe extra heat capacity afforded byevaporation and condensation would reduce\nthe required flow rate. Radiator weight\nwould be reduced for the same reason.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Equipment to be heated could draw waste\nheat more conveniently from other equipment instead of using electrical heating.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Parallel branches could readily be added\nto the loop.\nThis work was done by Fred Edelstein of\nGrumman Aerospace Corp. for Johnson\nSpace Center.

The unit\nwould be compact and light in weight. With\nvalves as the only moving parts, it should\nbe reliable for many years.\nThe new hydrogen refrigerator concept\nwas developed for cooling sensitive infrared detectors for airborne and aerospace\ncameras. It overcomes an earlier limitation\nof hydrogen cryogenic cooling systems in\nthat it can cool below the freezing temperature of hydrogen (13.8 1<). It offers advantages over helium-based systems for extremely low temperatures. For example, it\ncan operate on waste or solar heat instead\nof electrical energy. It is simpler mechanically and less subject to wear. It conserves\nand recycles Its working fiuid rather than\nexpending it and thus can function for\nmany years rather than just a few months.\nAside from aerospace applications, the hydrogen refrigeration concept might be\nadapted to cooling superconducting magnets on magnetically levitated railcars,\nnuclear-particle accelerators, and a variety of other cryogenic equipment.\nThe refrigerator employs two stages.\nThe first stage, using previously developed\ntechnology based on the absorption and\nrelease of hydrogen by lanthanum pentanickel, produces liquid hydrogen at a temperature of about 20 K. The liquid hydrogen\nfills one of two containers in the second\nstage (see figure). When the container is\nfull, the liquid-hydrogen supply is cut off,\nand the hydrogen vapor in the container is\nabsorbed in a vessel containing a lowpressure hydride material, such as palladium, which has a high affinity for hydrogen, at a temperature of 275 K. As a result of the absorption, the pressure in the\nliquid-hydrogen container dr~ to 1.7 torr\n(230 NJm2). As the pressure falls, the hydrogen cools and solidifies, stabilizing at about\n10 K. The solid hydrogen sublimates at the\nlow container pressure, removing heat\nfrom an infrared sensor (or other object) as\nit does so.\nThe sublimated gas enters a heat exchanger, where it precools gas that is being returned to an alternate liquid-hydrogen\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nr----------------~\nPREVIOUS TECHNOLOGY\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\niti~~\\\\}\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 ........\n~\n\n~\n\n:; ~\\.~::;: ~\'."\n\n50 atm\n\n(5 MPal\n450 K\n\n,\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nFlrst\xc2\xb7Stage\nRefrigerator\n65 to 120 K\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n_.J. _ _ ,\n\nr\nThermal\nSwitches\n\n760 torrt\n(0.1 MPa)\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n1.7 torr\n(230 pal:\n\n1\n\n10 K Sensor\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n760 torr\n(0.1 MPa)\n425 K\n\nl-===:!:.J\n\n1.7 torr\n(230 Pal\n275 K\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nL _________ _\nThe Hydride Refrigeration System with few moving parts comprises a 20-K first stage and\na below-10-K second stage.\n\nvessel from an alternate palladium absorber that has been heated to 425 K to\nrelease the hydrogen.

In the reduction\nof iron ore in a fluidized bed, for example,\nthe are particles do not sinter on the distributor and perhaps clog it or otherwise interfere with gas flow. The new distributor is\nalso relatively cool. Thus, in the fluidizedbed production of silicon, inflowing silane\ndoes not decompose until it is within the\nbed of hot silicon particles and can deposit\non them.\nCalled a "spiral distributor," the new unit\nconsists of overlapping plates, each plate\nbeing shaped like a sector of a circle (see\nfigure). The plates are welded together at\nthe center. Gaps between the plates admit\nflowing gas. The gas swirls into the bed,\ncreating a turbulent zone with a low density\nDistributor\nPlates\n\nof solid particles immediately above the\ndistributor plate. Above the turbulent zone,\nthe particles form a conventional fluidized\nbed.The turbulent flow above the spiral distributor keeps the particles moving so that\nthey do not rest on it and adhere.\nA working model of the spiral distributor\nwas compared with a conventional distributor made of porous, sintered stainless\nsteel. In the spiral distributor, the number of\nplates was varied between 24 and 32, and\nthe interplate gap was varied from 0.214 to\n0.813 millimeter. For both types of distributor,\nthree types of particles were used to fill the\nfluidized bed: Sand, silicon, and zirconia.\nFor the spiral distributor, the pressure\ndrop was always lower than for the conventional distributor, enabling the blower to\nconsume less power. At high gas speeds,\n\nCentral Weld\nPoint\n\nthe spiral distributor gives a better quality\nof fluidization; pressure fluctuations across\nthe bed are low, gas bubbles are small, and\ncontact of the gas with solids is greater. Indeed, for such high-density bed-particle\nmaterials as zirconia, the fluidization quality is better for all gas speeds. At low gas\nspeeds, for all types of particles, the transfer of heat from the bed to the spiral distributor is less than to a porous distributor 0perating at the same gas-feed conditions\nand bed temperature.\nThis work was done by Fan OuYang of\nthe Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Academia Sinica, and Octave Levenspiel of\nthe Oregon State University for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

The carbon/carbon piston concept\n(see figure) features a low piston-tocylinder wall clearance - so low, in fact,\nthat piston rings and skirts are unnecessary. These advantages are made fXlSSible\nby the negligble coefficient of thermal e~\nsion of carbon/carbon [0.3 x 10\xc2\xa3 in.linJO F\n(0.54 X 10-6 cm/cm/ o C)). Aluminum, in\ncomparison, has a coeffICient of thermal ex156\n\npansion over 40 times that of carbon/carbon.\nThe carbon/carbon material maintains\nits strength at elevated temperatures, allowing the piston to operate at higher temperatures and pressures than a comparable metal piston. The high emittance and\nlow thermal conductivity of the carbon/carbon piston will improve the thermal efficiency of the engine because less heat energy is lost to the piston and oooling system.\nThe elimination of rings reduces friction,\nthus improving mechanical efficiency.\nBesides being lighter than an aluminum\npiston for the same application, the carboni\n\nCarbon/Carbon\nMaterial\n\nPiston\nCrown\n\nWrlst\xc2\xb7Pin\nBoss\n\nA Carbon/Carbon Piston Eliminates Pis\xc2\xb7\nton Rings and allows a minimal piston\nskirt length.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\ncarbon piston will produce cascading effects\nthat will reduce the weight of other reciprocating components such as the crankshaft,\nconnecting rods, flywheel, and balances,\nthus improving specific engine performance. The engine can run at higher speeds\nthan an aluminum piston engine, again improving specific engine performance.\nAA alternate carbon/carbon piston con-\n\ncept includes the use of a carbon/carbon\ncylinder wall provided by a carbonlcarbon\nsleeve in a cylinder block of a more conventional material.

The formula can be used for inducers of mixedflow pumps. With the formula, calculations\ncan be made more quickly and accurately\nthan with previously available formulas\n(see figure).\nThe formula is adapted from a NASA formula for the impeller slip factor. The slipfactor formula is applied locally to an inducer or to a mixed-flow-rotor exit station to\nderive an equation for the local slip factor.\nThe slip-factor equation is then used to develop an equation for the local rotordischarge deviation angle. The deviation\nangle is expressed in closed form as a\nfunction of the local discharge blade angle,\nthe rotor axial-Iength-to-radius ratio, the local flow coefficient, and the local slip\ncoefficient.\nThis work was done by S.

The new seal acts as a strong journal\nbearing that provides high stiffness NASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nabout the same as that of the ball bearings\nfor the turbopump shaft. The seal thus\nshares the load with the ball bearings and\nprolongs their lives. At the same time, the\nseal allows minimal leakage of fluid from\n\nthe pump. By combining leakage control\nand bearing functions, the seal makes multiple seals unnecessary and thus allows\ncompact design.\nThe seal employs a stator section with a\n157\n\no\n\nrough surface (see figure) and a mating\nrotor section with a srrcoth surface. The stator is roughened to a finish of about 800 /-lin.\n(20 ~) , and the rotor is smoothed to a finish of 8 /-lin. (0.2 ~). The rough/smooth\nseal design reduces the axial velocity of\nthe fluid and thereby reduces leakage. It\nalso reduces the tangential velocity of the\nfluid, thereby increasing the dynamic\nstability.\nThe rough/smooth seal has been used\nin a high-pressure liquid-oxygen pump. Its\nhigh load capacity has been confirmed in\nrocket-engine tests, and its ability to control leakage has been demonstrated in a\nwater test.\nThis work was done by W C. Olen and\nE. D.

The liner is molded as a single\npiece of flexible plastic with helical internal\nchannels (see figure).\nThree rollers move around the inner wall\nof the liner, compressing the channels and\nforCing liquid before the constrictions. As\nthe rollers move on, the channels open\nelastically, drawing in liquid from the inlet\nport and making it available when the\nrollers return. The dimensions and shapes\nof the channels in the liner are chosen to\nminimize fatigue stresses caused by the\nrepeated squeezing. Therefore, the liner\nshould not acquire a noticeable set.\nEvery channel must be closed by a roller\nto prevent backflow. This means that the\nangle between rollers must always be less\nthan the helix angle of the channels. If only\none roller were used, for example, the helix\nangle would have to be greater than 360 0 .\nIn an alternative version of the pump,\nthe rollers would be on the outside wall of\nthe liner. In this configuration, the rollers\nwould be belt- or gear-driven, rather than\ndirectly driven by a motor, so that an inlet\nconnection could be made for the liquid.\nThis work was done by Joseph A.\nChandler of Johnson Space Center.

For aircraft and aerospace service,\nhigh-speed, high-performance turbomachinery should be as light in weight as possible. Of course, a certain amount of mass\nis needed in the turbomachine housing for\nstiffness. The report addresses the question\nof tlCM\' much extra weight is necessary.\nRotor stability was analyzed on six advanced turbcpumps designed to operate at\nspeeds ranging from 28,rJS7 to 110,CXXl rlmin\nand pressures up to 8,CXXllblin.2 (55 MPa).\nInterestingly, the analyses have shown that\nunder certain conditions, a flexible housing\nmay be more stable than a rigid one. Specifically, if the support stiffness ratio is at\nleast 3:1 and preferably 5:1, a turbopump\nwill tolerate higher rotational speeds than if\n\nit were completely rigid. A housing-to-rotor\nweight ratio of at least 6:1 is also recommended, partly to ensure the reliability of\ncomputational results and partly because\nthis ratio is representative of existing\nturbopumps.\nThe report also describes an analytical\nprogram developed for a personal computer from several large programs for a\nmainframe computer. The new program allows complex rotor and housing configurations to be analyzed in a much shorter time\nand in an interactive mode.

Spur\ngears have been used for many years and\nare important in transmitting power from\n\none rotating shaft to another. The use of an\nexternal gear inside of an internal gear provides a compact arrangement, but its dynamics have not been studied as much as\nthose of the more common arrangement\nof two external gears side by side. This new\nanalysis procedure can be used for gear\ncombinations leading up to and exceeding\nthe "very high contact ratio" (VHCR) of\nth~ee . Parametric studies with these new\ncomputer programs have already revealed\nan impressive list of advantages of internal\nspur-gear drives over external spur-gear\ndrives.\nThe analysis package consists of three\ncomputer programs that perform static,\ndynamic, and stress analyses. respectively. Output from the three programs includes\nthe static and dynamic loads. variations in\ntransmission ratio, sliding velocities, maximum contact pressures, and tooth-bending\nstress acting on the gear teeth. These new\nprograms provide an analysis procedure\napplicable to involute profiles and minor\ndeviations from this prOfile as a result of\nmodifications, imperfections, and circumferential deflections.\n\nBecause of the potential noninvolute\nprofile and the effect of radial deflection on\ntooth position, an interactive procedure is\nused to calculate the statically indeterminate problem of multitooth contacts. circumferential deflection, and contact ratio.\nThe static analysis can also be adapted for\ndetermining the gear mesh stiffness of a\nplanet and ring gear assembly. The maximum tooth-bending stress of the external\nand internal gear is determined by "Cornell\'s method." These programs provide\nfor the very detailed and advanced modeling of internal spur-gear drives.\nThese programs are written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and have\nbeen implemented on art IBM 370-series\ncomputer with the largest having a centralmemory requirement of approximately\n220K of 8-bit bytes.

Originally used to remove dents on the Space Shuttle mainengine nozzle, the tool is a variation of the\nsliding-hammer dent puller used in automotive bodywork.\nThe user first tack welds the tip of the\nslide rod to the dent (see figure). Next, the\nuser slides the hammer away from the\ndent so that the hammer strikes a flange at\n\nthe end of the rod. The impact of the hammer pulls out the dent. The hammering is\nrepeated until the dented metal is even\nwith the surrounding surface. The slide rod\nis unwelded, and the surface finish is\nrestored.\nThis work was done by Teresa Leipham\nand Jewel E. Mccarroll of Rockwell International Corp. for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The\nspecimen would be scanned with a focused cO2 laser beam in such a way that a\nthin zone of molten material would move\nalong the specimen and sweep impurities\nwith it.\nAs shown in the figure, the laser beam is\ndirected by mirrors to a galvanometerdriven scanning mirror, which in turn directs the beam to a stage driven by a stepping motor. The beam scans rapidly back\nand forth across the specimen as the\nspecimen is translated slowly by the main\n162\n\ntranslation stage in a direction perpendicular to the scanning motion. The center of\nthe beam thus traces a zigzag path on the\nspecimen. Because of the relative speed\nof the scanning motion, the heated zone\nappears as a line that translates along the\nspecimen.\nThe melt zone can be up to 1 centimeter\nwide and can be moved a maximum distance of 10 centimeters. The laser spot diameter at sharpest focus is 0.5 millimeter.\nThe focusing lens is mounted on a small\nstage, also driven by a stepping motor, so\nthat the laser spot size can be adjusted.\nThe laser power can be varied from 10 to\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nAmerican Business\nLeaders Who Do Not\nJoin The War On\nGovernlDent Waste\nAnd Fight\nThe DeficitAre Shooting\nThemselves\nOur Country\nIn The Foot!\nHere\'sWhy\nespite "prorrusing"\neconorruc forecasts and\nthe public\'s patient "Walt\nand see\' attItude, the deficit IS at\nrecord levels .

The\nequipment is ideally suited for research\nand development of new sizing solutions. It\nwas designed especially for applying thermoplastic sizing solutions to graphite tow\nconsisting of 3,000 to 12,000 filaments per\ntow, but it will accommodate other solutions, other filament counts, and materials\nother than graphite.\nThe new apparatus is diagramed in the\nfigure. A spool of unsized graphite tow,\ncommercially available and wound on\nstandard cardboard cores, is attached to\n164\n\nan unwinding creel. An idling spool guides\nthe tow and provides tension. The tow is\npulled through a tube furnace lined with\nPyrex (or equivalent) glass tube to drive off\natmospheric moisture. From there, it proceeds through the resin reservoir, which is\nmade by welding three polyethylene bottles together, installing orifices at both\nends, and adding spreader bars to spread\nthe tow as it travels through the solution. A\ntypical sizing solution is 0.5 percent by\nweight polysulfone in methylene chloride\nsolvent. The tow is pulled through a second\ndrying furnace to drive off the methylene\nchloride solvent, pulled through a second\nidler spool, and finally rewound on a spool\n\nfor further processing.\nThis technique was developed because\nthere is no commercial equipment available on a small (research) scale to mechanically unwind, size, dry, and rewind\nfiber tows. Poor wetting of fibers during\nresin impregnation results in resin-poor\nareas, or dry spots, after laminating and\nmolding. These areas subsequently result\nin voids within the composite, causing delamination and early failure. Sizing compounds\n(very low concentrations of the intended\nimpregnating resin system or constituents\nof such resin, usually less than 1 percent\nby weight) are applied to the fibers to provide environmental protection, to enhance\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nDrying\nFurnace\n\nDrying\nFurnace\n\nResin\nReservoir\n\nUnwinding\nCreel\n\nThe Resin Reservoir Is a Closed System containing the highly volatile methylene chloride vapors.

Slits would first be cut in the\nmasks by stamping or other economical\nprocess. Then the masks would be superimposed so that the slits define new openings that are narrower than the original slits\n(see figure).\nThis two-mask process may be cheaper\nthan making a narrow slit in a single mask\nby chemical etching or electricaldischarge machining.

Package\n\nSystem for Automated Troubleshooting\nAlgorithms follow human patterns in diagnosing\nfaults in electromechanical systems.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nNew algorithms for diagnosing problems in electromechanical systems based\non artificial intelligence techniques can be\nused to locate faults with minimal human\nintervention. After being given information\non the system architecture, electrical connections, types of parts, and failure modes,\nthe algorithms apply "reasoning" processes patterned after those of humans.\nThe system troubleshoots common\nproblems. If experience with the system\nshows that certain problems have been\noverlooked, it is easy to add the necessary\nrules and factual.knowledge to the program.\nThe diagnostician alternates between\nexplanation and either confirmation or denial (see figure). The explanation phase\nseeks to find the cause of a detected or hypothesized malfunction . The software\nworks backward from either the malfunction presented to it or the confirmed cause\nof the malfunction (itself a malfunction),\nthus building a chain of causes. The confirmation or denial phase seeks evidence for\nor against the hypothesized cause.\nIn the explanation process, a symptom\nor cause is matched against a rule in the\ndata base that contains the symptom or\ncause as its result. Usually, more than one\nrule matches, and the preconditions of all\nsuch rules then become candidate explanations. Some rules can be eliminated\nbecause they specify facts that cannot be\nmatched against given facts of the data\nbase - such as system architecture or\nconnections. Of the remaining candidates,\neach in turn undergoes a confirmatory\nprocess until only one confirmed cause remains. If no cause is confirmed, the chain\n\nI\n\nStart\n\nof explanation unwinds to a previously confirmed level, and the software tries alternative hypothetical causes. The process quits\nonly after it has exhausted all alternatives.\nWhen the process confirms a cause\njudged to be sufficiently explanatory, determined by the perron designing the diagnosis,\nit may find an "advice" message associated with the terminating rule that suggests\na cure for the problem and displays the\nmessage to the user. A user who wants a\nmore detailed explanation may request the\nprocess to continue and have the explanation extended to a deeper level of system\ndetail.\nTo confirm a diagnostic condition , the\nsystem searches its knowledge base for a\nrule having preconditions that match those\nof the candidate. The rule predicts what selected values of system performance will\nbe measured if the candidate explanation\nis true. Each such prediction is compared\nwith actual measurements until either all\npredictions are matched or any is denied.\nWhen a system consists of relatively independent subsystems, the software is\nprogramed to operate in a "focus" mode.\nSuch independent subsystems have unique\nsymptoms that characterize faulty operation . The diagnostician checks each subsystem in turn until a set of symptoms for\nfaulty operation is confirmed, or there are\nno subsystems left to check.\nWhen a system consists of subsystems\nthat influence each other by passing signals, the software uses a "trace" mode.\nSeveral kinds of knowledge have to be supplied to the program by the user for this\nmode.

The representations help in visualizing the requirements\nfor storing and manipulating transform\nvalues in computations. The representations are useful in any number of dimensions, but particularly in the one-, two-, and\nthree-dimensional cases, which are often\nencountered in practice.\nThe three-dimensional OFT (also called\nthe "fast" Fourier transform) X(kl,k2,k~ for\na function x(nl,n2,n3) has periodicity Nj in\neach axis: For example,\n\nk2\n\nI\n\n7.\n\n6.\n\n5.\n\nReal-Value\nPoint\n\n~\n\n4@\n3.\n\n=\n\nwhere kl and Nj are integers, and Nj the\nnumber of points in the Fourier sum along\nthe ith axis. This relationship enables one to\ngenerate the transform values for negative\narguments from those for positive arguments by means of X( - k) = X(N - k). One\nvery useful relation of this type is\n\nX(~ +\n\nm) = X (-\n\n~ + m).\n\n~\n\n~\n\nComplex-Conjugate\nPair\n\n1e\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n<Xi\n0\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 2. Within a Quadrant, two-dimensional 8-by-8 OFT values that are complex conjugates of each other lie at pOints opposite each other at equal distances from the point 4,4\non lines through the pOint 4,4.\n\nThus, it is possible to generate any transform value as long as any N contiguous\nvalue is known along each axis. These\nsymmetry and periodicity properties are illustrated geometrically in Figure 1 for a\ntwo-dimensional OFT.\nThe OFT also has the Hermitian property\n\nFigure 1. The Two-Dimensional OFT repeats all over the transform plane with\nperiodicity in each axis equal to the number, N, of sampling pOints along that axis.\nHere, corresponding points in boxes of\nidentical color have identical transform\nvalues.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nCombining this with the periodicity relations results in sets of equations for generating transform values thaf are complex\nconjugates of each other.

MFS-27072\n\nMaximum-Likelihood Parameter-Estimation Algorithm\nTreating errors as uncorrelated white noise is\nrealistic and computationally efficient.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn efficient version of a maximumlikelihood algorithm has been devised for\ncalculating normal-mode frequencies and\ndamping parameters of a vibrating system\nfrom experimental data where both process noise and measurement noise are\npresent. The method should be applicable\nin the vibration analysis of such complicated structures as vehicles, aircraft, and\nspacecraft.\nThe new algorithm is a simplification of\nan existing maximum-likelihood formulation using a Kalman filter that allows for\nboth process and measurement noise. The\nnew algorithm incorporates the assumption that measurement-noise covariance\ncan be treated as a given rather than as a\nparameter to be determined. This assumption simplifies the computation and guarantees that the Kalman filter gains correspond to a physical system.\nThe most likely parameters are identified by the minimization of a performance\nindex called the "likelihood functional."\nThe Newton-Raphson method is used to\nminimize the likelihood functional. Estimates of the values of the parameters,\nwhich are required to start the process, are\nused to design a Kalman filter for state estimation. A related filter that indicates the\nsensitivity of the state estimate to the parameters to be determined is obtained\nfrom derivatives of the Kalman filter. The\nstate estimates and the derivatives are\nused to calculate the gradient of the likeli-\n\n(ij\n\nc\n\n.2\nt)\n\nC\n::l\n\nLL.\n\n"0\n\n0\n0\n\n:\xc2\xa3\n\n0.4\n\nQ;\n\n-""\n::::i\n\n0.2\n\n\'0\nE\n\n:::\n~\nCO>\no\n...J\n\n0.0\n-0.2\n- 0.4 L -_ _-:-1:__---L:-----L:__--~::-----="::__--~\n\no\n\n~\n\nFrequency, Hz\nLocal Minimums in a Likelihood Functional for a flexible beam occur at the frequencies of\nthe first three vibrational modes.\nhood functional. In the Newton-Raphson\nupdate, new estimates of the parameter\nvalues are calculated. Using the new parameter values in each iteration as input\nfor the next, the entire process is repeated\nuntil convergence is achieved.\nWhen the likelihood functional is plotted\nas a function of frequency or da\'1lping\nratio, the result is a smoothly varying curve\nwith a round-bottomed local minimum at\neach modal frequency or damping ratio\n(see figure). In such a situation, rapid con-\n\nvergence is obtained when the parameter\nestimates used to start the first iteration\nare reasonably close to the correct values.\nNevertheless, one must select the initial\nparameters with care, since incorrect\nvalues sometimes cause the likelihood\nfunctional to diverge.\nThis work was done by Daniel B.

The User Interface\nGroup, comprising representatives of the\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\naerospace industry, universities, and govemment agencies, serves as a forum for\nthe discussion of such user-oriented\nissues as the selection of user languages,\nmanagement policy, equipment required\nfor remote access, and data protection.\nThe sustained computational speed of\nthe facility is expected to be 250 x 1()6\nfloating-point operations per second; its\nmemory at least 64 x 106 64-bit words.\nBy 1987, the speed and memory should\neach be increased by a factor of 4 and the\nnetwork will be expanded to support at\nleast 100 users simultaneously on a timesharing basis. The operating system and\nnetwork will be capable of using equipment\nfrom a number of manufacturers.\nThe facility will house the NAS Processing System network, which includes the following eight subsystems:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-speed processor,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Support processing,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Work stations,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Graphics,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mass storage,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Long-haul communications,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-speed data.network, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Local-area network.\nThe report lists nine candidate problems\nfor inclusion in initial tests of the system.\nThese (epresent a balance of fundamental\nfluid physics research and applied computational aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics. A computational chemistry problem;\nnamely, the simulation of crack initiation\nand propagation, is also a candidate.\nIt is expected that 90 percent of the\navailable high-speed processor time will be\ndevoted to fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and 10 percent to chemistry, atmospheric modeling, aircraft structural analysis, and astrophYSiCS. By user affiliation,\nusage is expected to be about 55 percent\nNASA, 20 percent Department of Defense,\n15 percent industry, and 5 percent universities. The report does not state the allocation of the remaining 5 percent.\nIn reviewing the history and future of\ncomputational aerodynamics, the report\nlists computational requirements for treating a series of increasingly complex problems involving the equations of fluid dynamics. The most demanding problem is\nthe full Navier-Stokes treatment of timevarying supersonic/subsonic flow with laminarlturbulent transitions and turbulence\ndissipation, requiring 10 12 to 10 15 grid\npoints.\nThis work was done by V. L Peterson, W\nF. BaJlhaus. Jr.. and F. R. Bailey of Ames\nResearch Center. To obtain a copy of the\nreport, "Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation (NAS), ..

Refer to ARG-11497.\n\nComparison of Decision\nModels\nThe results predicted by linear\nand multiplicative decision\nmodels are compared.\nTwo methods of multiattribute decision\nanalysis are compared in a report. One\nmethod employs a linear utility model. The\nother utilizes a multiplicative utility model.\nThe report is based on interviews with experts in automotive technology to obtain\ntheir preferences regarding 10 new types\nof vehicles.\nThirty-nine people were asked to express their preferences for these attributes: Initial cost, life-cycle cost, maintainability, safety, relative fuel economy, and refueling time. All the vehicles are intended to\noperate with nonpetroleum fuel and to\nhave a 250-mile (4oo-kilometer) range. The\npropulsion systems included a methanol\nspark-ignition engine, a solid-poIYmerelectrolyte fuel cell, three different types of\nbatteries in an all-electric configuration,\nand five different types of batteries in a hybrid configuration with a methanol-fueled\nengine.\nThe interviewees were drawn from the\nfollowing groups or functions associated\nwith advanced vehicles:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fleet purchasing or management,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Research in an automobile manufacturing firm,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Corporatedecisionmakers in automobile\nmanufacturing,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Consumer, professional, and marketanalysis organizations,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fuel suppliers,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Organizations conducting advancedvehicle research for utility companies,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Utility companies, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Government and university researchers.\nRankings were calculated for the 39 interviewees and for the Bgroups they represent. For the individuals, several variations\nof the multiattribute decision models were\nused, including versions in which the less\nimportant attributes were disregarded. For\nthe groups, three dITferent group-decision\nrules were used. In addition, direct rankings were obtained from 31 of the participants who responded to questionnaires.\nIn general, the rankings were consistent\namong individuals, different groupdecision rules, and dITferent multiattribute\nutility models. The rankings from the linear\nmodel were virtually identical to the rankings from the multiplicative model. Although some interview and computation\ntime could have been saved by using only\none model, the fact that both agree lends\nadditional credibility to the results.\nThe direct rankings required the least effort and, for the most part, agreed with the\nrankings from the linear and multiplicative\n175\n\n@\n\nmodels. The direct rankings, however, give\nno insight into risk preferences or the rela\'\ntive importance of various attributes. Such\ninsights are often at least as valuable as\nthe rankings themselves.\n\nComputer\nPrograms\nThese programs may be obtained\nat a very reasonable cost from\nCOSMIC, a facility sponsored by\nNASA to make raw programs available to the public. For information\non program price, size , and avail ability, circle the reference number\non the TSP and COSMIC Request\nCard in this issue.\n\nNumerical Methods for\nClassical Sampled\xc2\xb7System\nAnalysis\nAlgorithm selection is\nsimplified for the controlsystem analyst.\nSAMSAN provides the control-system\nanalyst with self-consistent computer algorithms that support large-order controlsystem design and evaluation studies. It\nemphasizes sampled-system analysis.\nControl-system analysts have access to\na vast array of published algorithms to\nsolve an equally large spectrum of computational problems related to controls. The\nanalyst usually spends considerable time\nand effort in bringing these published algorithms to an integrated operational status\nand often finds them less general than desired. SAMSAN reduces the burden on the\nanalyst by providing a set of algorithms that\nhave been well tested and documented\nand that can be readily integrated for solving control-system problems. Algorithm selection for SAMSAN has been biased toward numerical accuracy for large-order\nsystems with computational speed and\nportability being considered important but\nnot paramount.\nIn addition to containing relevant subroutines from EISPAK for eigenanalysis\nand from LlNPAK for the solution of linear\nsystems and related problems, SAMSAN\ncontains the following capabilities:\n1. Reduction of a real nonsymmetric matrix to block diagonal form via a real\nsimilarity-transformation matrix that is\nwell conditioned with respect to inversion;\n2. Solution of the generalized eigenvalue\nproblem with balancing and grading;\n176\n\nThis work was done by Abe Feinberg,\nRalph F. Miles, Jr., and Jeffrey H. Smith of\nCaltech and Ernest M.

Matrix exponentiation and the evaluation of integrals involving the matrix expontential with an option to first block\ndiagonalize;\n5. Root locus and frequency response for\nsingle-variable transfer functions in the\nS, Z, and W domains;\n6. Several methods of computing zeros\nfor linear systems;\n7. Reduction of a set of linear ordinary differential equations or finite-difference\nequations to a set of almost decoupled\ngeneralized coordinate equations;\n8. Integration of a system of ordinary differential equations using a fixed- or\nvariable-step standard Runge-Kutta algorithm or by using the generalpurpose package of numerical integration algorithms DEPAC;\n9. Computation of characteristic gains\nand phases, principal gains and\nphases, robustness, and sensitivity\nmeasures for a return-ratio (transferfunction) matrix at a particular point in\nthe complex plane;\n10.The ability to read a NASTRANgenerated OUTPUT2 data file and produce a data file compatible with the\nSAMSAN routines; and\n11 .The ability to generate documentation\n"on demand."\nAll matrix operations in the SAMSAN algorithms assume nonsymmetric matrices\nwith real double-precision elements. There\nis no fixed size limit on any matrix in any\nSAM SAN algorithm; however, it is generally agreed by experienced users, and in the\nnumerical error analysis literature, that\ncomputation with nonsymmetric matrices\nof order greater than about 200 should be\navoided or treated with extreme care.\nSAM SAN attempts to support the needs of\napplication-oriented analysis by providing:\n1. A methodology with unlimited growth\npotential,\n2. A methodology to insure that associated documentation is current and\navailable "on demand,"\n3. A foundation of basic computational algorithms that most control-analysis\nprocedures are based upon,\n4. A set of checkout and evaluation programs that demonstrate the use of the\nalgorithms on a series of problems that\nare structured to expose the limits of\neach algorithm\'s applicability, and\n5. Capabilities that support both a priori\nand a posteriori error analysis for the\n\ncomputational algorithms provided.\nThe SAM SAN algorithms are coded in\nFORTRAN IV for batch or interactive execution and have been implemented on a\nDEC VI*. series computer. An effort was\nmade to ensure that the FORTRAN source\ncode was portable and, thus, SAMSAN\nmay be adaptable to other machines. The\nSAM SAN package was developed in 1982\nand last updated in 1984.\nThis program was written by Harold P.\nFrisch and Frank H. Bauer of Goddard\nSpace Right Center. For further information, Circle 82 on the TSP Request Card.\nGSC-12827\n\nSoftware Comparison\nThe program compares\nsimilarly structured files,\nline by line.\nThe Software Comparison Package\n(SCP) compares similar files. Normally,\nthese are go-character files produced by\nthe CDC UPDATE utility from program\nlibraries that contain a FORTRAN source\ncode plus an identifier. The SCP can also\nbe used to compare load maps, crossreference outputs, and UPDATE corrections sets. In short, it can help wherever\nline-by-line comparison of similarly structured files is required.\nAn important feature of the SCP is the\nautomatic generation of update directives\n(in standard CDC UPDATE format) that can\nbe later applied to a program library to\nchange one set of routines into the other.\nOften, only part of this set may be useful,\nbut experience has shown it to be a timesaver. In cases where major modifications\nare anticipated and a complicated history\nof overlapping corrections have been applied to a routine, it is often easiest to use\nthe SCP to generate a single correction\ndeck that summarizes all changes.\nThe SCP program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been\nimplemented on a CDC CYBER 70-series\ncomputer. Dimensioned for comparing\nroutines up to 2,500 lines long, the program\nhas a central-memory requirement of approximately 200K (octal) of 6O-bit words.\nThe SCP program was developed in 1984.\nThis program was written by David C.\nBlanchard of McDonnell Douglas Corp. for\nJohnson Space Center.

User-friendly\nprompts provide access to explanations of\ncommon features of digital image processing and of sample programs that implement these features.\nCurrently available features include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Density Slicing - Assigns color codes to\nranges of gray scale values,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Statistics - Generates image statistics\nfor whole images or training areas,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Filter - Demonstrates the effects of\nbandwidth bypass filters,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transverse - Displays a histogram of\npixel values for a selected channel or line\nin an image, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contable - Calculates and displays a\n"confusion matrix" for two color-coded\nimages.\n.\nA sample image is included with the AIPE\nsystem so that instruction is self-contained.\nThe AlPE system is written in Applesoft\nBASIC and Integer BASIC for interactive\nexecution on the Apple 1\\ or Apple 1\\ +\ncomputers with the Disk II Subsystem,\nDOS 3.3, a color monitor, and 48K of &bit\nbytes.

It combines the doubfe-precision capabilities of a floating-point-variable format\nwith the baSically unlimited string length of\na literal-variable format to provide multipleNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nprecision results. The input and output are\nin literal format and are restricted only by\nmachine limitations, time considerations,\nor a user-defined limit to the number of\ndecimal places required _ The use of\nPRECISION will prevent underflow and\noverflow in programs that generate extreme numbers such as probability theory,\nstatistics, and scientific applications.\nBasic PRECISION functions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,\nand integer powers. Extremely large or\nsmall numbers can be handled by use of a\nPRECISION function that converts them to\nstandard scientific notation. PRECISION\nfunctions also exist for multiplication, division, and integer powers of numbers in scientific notation. A program is converted to\nPRECISION arithmetic by replacing +, - ,\n*, and + with the apprepriate PRECISION\noperator.\nPRECISION was written in APL for use\nwith interactive or batch programs and has\nbeen implemented on a Honeywell Sigmaseries computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 16K bytes. It\nwas written in 1984.\nThis program was written by Leonard W\nHowell and Marshall Patrick of Marshall\nSpace Right Center.

PGP was created to\nsupport development of a Heads-Up Display (HUD) simulation, and many of its\nstandard symbols were defined with the\nHUD in mind. Available symbols include\nthe circle, triangle, quadrangle, window,\nline, numbers, and text.l>dditional symbols\ncan be easily added or built up from available symbols. The user gains access to the\nPGP from a driver program. Output is a c0llection of line\xc2\xb7printer plots 13 inches (33 em)\nsquare. The available plotting area is 132\nby 106 print positions.\nThe PGP routines are written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and have\nbeen implemented on a CDC CYBER\n70-s~ries computer with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 52K (octal)\nof 6O-bit words. The PGP routines were developed in 1984.\nThese routines were written by David C.\nBlanchard of McDonnell Douglas Corp. for\nJohnson Space Center.

They represent\nthe collective wisdom of the more than 650 top executives from major American corporations,\ngovernment agencies and universities who attended the symposium, which focused on the\nchallenge of improving quality and productivity through effective managerial practices.\nThe major findings of the symposium are organized into nine themes, three of which were\npresented on pages 186-191 of the Fall 1985 issue of NASA TECH BRIEFS. In this issue, we continue our presentation with themes four through six. (The remaining three themes will be presented\nin a future issue.) Each theme encompasses a set of recommended actions and management practices that have been shown to contribute to high quality and productivity-organizational imperatives\nin this era of the increasingly competitive global marketplace .\n\nTHEME 4: Make Innovation\nRewarding: Encouraging\nInnovation and Risk-Taking\nMaintaining the creativity and the risk-taking attitude that\nmake an organization successful is a major task of maturing\norganizations. It is well known that innovation is key to organiza\xc2\xb7\ntional survival in a fast changing economy. The true risk for any\norganization is to believe risk\xc2\xb7taking is unnecessary for long\xc2\xb7term\nsurvival. Management needs to recognize the proper place for\ninnovation and risk\xc2\xb7taking and create an environment that sup\xc2\xb7\nports and rewards it.\n.. . . . One essential step in renewing an organization is to set\nup a system for the care and feeding of innovators ... a\nsponsor . .. proper awards ... and the need to know what\nwill happen to them if they fail . .. " (Lewis Lehr, 3M\nCompany)\nOrganizations typically go through a life cycle. When they are\nyoung, they are characterized by flexibility and innovation, and\nare usually staffed by a group of people with a strong drive for\nsuccess . As they expand and mature, organizations tend to\nbecome specialized and segmented. Informal dialogue tends to\nbe replaced by a preoccupation with formal policy and control.\nInstead of designing for success, Lehr points out, mature\norgan izations tend to be more concerned with avoiding errors.\n" Playing it safe" becomes paramount. George Seegers of\nCitibank, N.A., describes the fate of Central Leather, once the\nnation \'s 24th largest company:\n" Central Leather failed to adopt new shoemaking techniques and equ ipment, and some time ago took its rightful\nplace in the graveyard of compan ies that decided to \'play it\nsafe !\' "\nSurvival in today\'s economy depends on an organizational\nphilosophy that nurtures risk\xc2\xb7taking and innovation.\n182\n\n.. . . . companies that take risks generally prosper. The true\nrisk for any company is to believe that risk-taking is unnecessary for long-term growth and survivaL" (Seegers)\n\nRecommendation 4.1 Provide a Climate for Creativity\nLehr identifies three considerations in the care and feeding\nof innovators. First, they need a sponsor who can help obtain\nresources and shield the project if it falters. Second, innovators\nshould be appropriately rewarded according to individual values.\nIBM \'s Corporate Fellows Program provides one example.\nFellows are free to foam the company to select problems that interest them . The third consideration is the cost of failure. Innovators must be assured that failed projects will not cost them\ntheir jobs .\nHarold Edmondson of Hewlett-Packard describes a supportive cl imate for innovation as one that allows people to be\ncreative, challenges the person by providing progressively more\ndemanding creative experiences, provides direction for creative\nenergy, provides measures for assessing success, and provides\ntangible rewards, e.g., status, resource support and peer awards.\n" Zealous volunteer champions. Innovators. Quite simply, they are the key to renewal in an organization. And we\ndon \'t even need to look for them . They\'ll find us if we let\nthem." (Leh r)\nRecommendation 4.2 Recognize the Place for Rlsk.Taklng\nInnovation is not equally applicable ordesirable in all parts of\nan organization . Furthermore, innovation is frequently accompanied by risk and additional costs. Management must therefore\ndecide when these risks and costs are warranted by the poten\xc2\xb7\nt ial gains. As Seegers points out:\n" The first lesson to be learned is that you must have a\ndetailed, well-thought-out template .. . for reaching yourobjective. The second is that you have to know when to follow\nthe plan , and when to ignore parts of it ... What every large\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\norganization-and especially the government-needs is\nperiodic reviews of all activities, just to make sure that an\nobvious, somewhat risky, but better way of doing things is\nnot being overlooked."\nThe timing of innovation is also important. Should the focus\nbe at the early stage of a project, a later stage, or should one\nstrive for innovation throughout the process? The answer can be\nderived only from a well-thought-out business strategy which\nexplicitly addresses the areas in which innovation in product or\nprocess is appropriate. John Franke of the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture had an interesting point of view on the benefits of\nsome risk-taking .\n"Stirring the pot upsets and causes some disruption. But\nwe feel the disruption is worth it. It provides the energy for\nnew approaches and new methods."\n\nTHEME 5: Build Dedication, Pride\nand Team Effort: Promoting\nParticipative Management\n\nosophy, "The Dana Style," in a handout given to all employees:\n"The people of Dana, who are doing the job, know best\nhow it should be done and they share the responsibility to\ndecide what their job is, and to judge how well it is done."\n(Carl Hirsch, Dana Corporation)\nIn a unionized environment, the commitment to participation\nwill necessarily involve the joint actions of management and\nlabor and may be institutionalized through the collective bargaining process. In order to succeed, however, according to Jack\nSheinkman of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers\nUnion, union and management must view each other as equal\npartners in a long-term effort. He further notes that contractual\nagreements must include an explicit provision that the productivity improvement program will not lead to layoffs and will\nneither undermine nor supplant collective bargaining, but rather\nextend the process.\nRecommendation 5.2 Build Supportive Management\nStructures and Policies\n\nThere is a wide range of employee involvement techniques:\ne.g., suggestion systems, quality circles, multiple management,\nlabor management committees and employee stock ownership\nplans.

As\nand in accord with the organizational structure and systems.\nThe Dana Corporation management explains its company phil- David Hamilton from Intel put it:\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\n183\n\n"Senior management must set realistic goals for productivity improvement throughout . . . and be willing to hold\nmiddle management accountable for performance against\nthese goals."\nGaining enthusiastic support among rank-and-file employees\ngenerally presents few problems. Unfortunately, the benefits to\nbe derived from a productivity effort are not so readily apparent\nto middle management, forthey tend to perceive themselves as\nbeing held accountable for a process over which they exercise\nlittle control. Moreover, middle managers may grumble that their\nrole in the decision-making process has been usurped, at least\nuntil they become sufficiently involved in carving out a new\nrelationship with employees.\nOne barrier to this support is lack of skillin operating in this\n"new" mode. McCormick and Company has solved this problem\nthrough a well-established program called multiple management. This involves giving middle managers a greater voice in\nrunning the business through the establishment of "junior"\nboards of directors.\n"The result at McCormick was small teams of employees\nmeeting regularly on a voluntary basis to identify, to analyze,\nand to solve work-related problems-real company problems involving packaging, product development, productivity, cost reduction, distribution, sales, quality and inventory\ncontroL" (Felton)\nWhen introducing participative management processes, considerable effort should be devoted to identifying and confronting\nthe fears and concerns of middle managers. For example, is it\nrealistic to expect middle management support if top management does not allow middle managers to participate in decisions\nthat affect them?\n\nTHEME 6: Uncork Individual Talent:\nControlling Bureaucracy\nAs successful organizations mature, they tend to become\npreoccupied with controls and checks that are narrowly focused,\nparochial and inflexible. This process results in overregulation\nof activity, discourages initiative and slows down responsiveness to changing conditions. Management needs to thwart this\ntendency through decentralization and by providing freedom and\nprotection for its innovators.\n"Pushing responsibility to the farthest point of the organization is the best way to make entrepreneurism a reality." (Carl\nHirsch, Dana Corporation)\nOrganizational barriers that inhibit entrepreneurism need to\nbe broken. The true purpose of an organization is to support the\nindividuals within it so they can be responsive to the organization\'s goals and be innovative and effective. Experience has\nshown that as successful organizations mature, there is a\ntendency for bureaucratic symptoms to begin to erode the\norganization\'s effectiveness. Typically, it becomes preoccupied\nwith controls and checks that are narrowly focused, parochial\nand inflexible. This maturation process, if unabated, leads to\norganizational decline as it loses the ability to adapt to the needs\nof the customers and meet the challenges of technology and the\ngrowth of competition.\n"In any organization, the inertia is on the side of those\nwho play it safe ... Bureaucracy begins when people are\nless concerned with being right than with not being found\nwrong." (George Seegers, Cltibank, N.A.)\nGovernment laws, rules and regulations also have impeded\nthe ability of organizations to remain flexible and adapt to\nchange.\nRecommendation 6.1 Increase Employee Initiative\nThrough Decentralization\nF. Blake Wallace describes how GM is dealing with the\nbureaucracy Issue:\n"Decentralization is what our new GM organization is aU\n\n184\n\nabout. We\'ve got to move faster in designing new products\nand bringing them to market. We\'ve got to cut out bureaucracy, eliminate redundancy, and make more efficient use\nof our people. And probably most important of all, we\'ve got\nto uncork individual talent . .. by giving our people the\nopportunity to take risks, assume responsibility . . . and\neam rewards." (Wallace, quoting General Motors Chairman\nRoger Smith)\nIt is possible for management to thwart the bureaucratic\nsymptoms of maturing organizations through decentralization\nand by providing greater freedom for the innovators. Managers\nmust examine the given tasks and structure of an organiz.ation\nin such a way that the people who are supposed to make it work\nhave the best chance to do so. The danger can be in placing\npeople in various slots simply because it supports some form of\nan organization, whether it is effective or not. Often in bureaucracies, performance at lower organizational levels is hampered\nby the need to check with multiple layers of management before\na decision can be made. This stifles individual motivation, initiative and creativity. Arlene Triplett of the U.S. Office of Manage\xc2\xb7\nment and Budget describes a government field manager\'s\nfrustration:\n"One of the problems with productivity in the government is\nthat the poor guys out there in the field trying to deliver services\nto the taxpayers have to go through five and six layers of management before they can get simple decisions like, \'Can I replace my\nsecretary? Can I buy a file cabinet?\' "\nRecommendation 6.2 Resist the Tendency to Overregulate,\nand Provide Incentives for Productivity Improvement\n"For all the tools we have tried and texts we have studied,\nthe real secret to improved productivity in our society is that\nsimple but all-elusive commodity, plain old-fashioned trust\n-confidence in people and faith in their integrity."\n(Malcolm Stamper, The Boeing Company)\nAn example of overregulation in the Federal procurement\nprocess was discussed by John Mittino, who described the\nDepartment of Defense\'s efforts during the last three and a\nhalf years to improve productivity with its contractors. This\neffort began with 32 Initiatives to shorten and simplify the\nacquisition process. At the present time, priority is being given\nto six management areas which Mittino says provide the greatest\nchallenge and the greatest potential payback. These areas include: program stability, multi-year procurement, economic\nproduction rates, realistic budgeting, support and readiness,\nand competition.\nAnotherexample of continuing 000 efforts to enhance contractor quality and productivity is through the use of contract\nincentives in its Industrial Modernization Incentives Program.\nNASA also is using the contractual process to encourage improved contractor performance.\n"Incentive contracts have always been our primary tool\nto motivate business in the R&D environment. We are now\nplacing increasing reliance on this controversial tool\nto focus on developing even more innovative and costeffective ways of doing business." (Gerald Griffin, Johnson\nSpace Center)\nGriffin further stated that 15-year contracts were planned to\ngive contractors the opportunity to introduce long-range\nimprovements. Later on, a fixed-price contract is envisioned to\ninject greater productivity and cost consciousness incentives.\nThese new contracts will allow NASA to delegate extensive\nmanagement responsibilities to the contractor as NASA reduces\nits day-to-day involvement in operations support.\nIn his review of initiatives undertaken by the President\'s\nCommission on Industrial Competitiveness, Executive Director\nEgils Milbergs outlined some components of a recently passed\nbill which will " modify the antitrust laws to permit precompetitive R&D ventures." A central goal is to reduce paperwork and\ncosts for industry and government. 0\nLook formore on quality and productivity in the next issue of\nNASATechBriefs.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\nSperry and the future in Space:\nYou have the choice.\nSperry\'s Space Systems Division has openings for aerospace professionals who want to help us meet the challenges of tomorrow\'s space business.

Many of my associates have enjoyed\nreceiving copies and passing them around.\nThe thing that\'s ironic is that not one in\na thousand of us who read TANSTAAFL will\nadmit that we may be part of the problem,\nperformers in the government circus, at\nbest, and possibly workfare recipients,\nat worst.\nCircuses and space programs are won\xc2\xb7\nderful things. Both improve the quality of\nlife. But how much of either is enough can\nonly be decided by the free market, and any\nindustry that exists largely on government\nsubsidization is sure to provide more of its\ncommodity than we need, most likely where\nwe need it least.\nWhen government provides free clr\xc2\xb7\ncuses, we should all ask, "Instead of what?"\nTA NSTAA FL.\nAndrew E.Barnlskls\nPrincipal Consultant\nApplied Dynamics and Ballistics Co.\nLevittown, PA\nTECH BRIEFS AT WORK\nJust read my first copy of NTB-Summer\n1985, Vol. 9, NO. 2. How refreshing! One of\nthe most stimulating publications I\'ve seen\nIn years.\nHaving migrated from technical engln\xc2\xb7\neering Into managerial work over the years,\nI had concluded that technology had pass\xc2\xb7\ned me by. Your magazine restores my con\xc2\xb7\nfldence; even I am able to understand most\nof it. Your editors do communicate well.\n. I was particu larly delighted by the article\n"Low Friction Joint For Robot Fingers,"\npage 140. When I was a youngster building\nmodel airplanes, 35 years ago, this same\nconcept worked well for control surface\nhinges. Our design motivation then, however, was not low friction. We couldn \'t\nafford model shop hinges.\nThanks for an excellent publication.\nR.E. Hine\nClinton, TN\n\nI depend on Tech Briefs to keep me updated on solar power research and to catalyze creative thought In solar as well as\nother technical areas. I have used Tech\nBriefs as a source of information for advising builders and contractors of residential\nhomes for years. I generally find your\npublication most helpful.\nJames F. Long\nVP Research & Dev.\nSeaborn, Inc.\nFreeport, FL\nThe availability of the report " Predicting\nLeakage in Labyrinth Seals" (NTB, Summer\n\'85, p. 149) is of particular interest, because\nwe regularly supply lip seals and flow re-\n\n186\n\nstrictor bushings along with our mechanical seals. Because of our test lab work load,\nwe don \'t have time to test a lot of "small\nhardware," so the information on calculating labyrinth flow should help us in predictIng bushing behavior. We can also compare\nit with our own equations, which are developed in-house. The lip seal report may provide us with ar, alternate auxiliary sealing\nmethod.\nRich Piccirilli\nBorg-Warner\nTemecula, CA\nI like your new format and current style.\nNASA Tech Briefs has helped solve or suggested solutions to many problems too\nnumerous to mention here.\nAlvord Rubino\nSenior DeSign Engineer\nBudd Lake, NJ\nI have been selecting material for stress\nmeasurements at cryogenic temperatures\nin biological materials.

(left) and the East Towne\nMallin Knoxville, Tenn. are completely enclosed by permanent FIberglas fabric\nroofs. The material was originally used In the space program during the Apollo era.\n\nF\n\nabric structures are nothing\nnew-that is, temporary fabric\nstructures. Tents have been\naround for quite awhile, and although\ntepees and covered wagons have come\nand gone, a permanent fabric structure\nmaterial has recently taken its place on\nthe American landscape.\nWhat to wear to the moon is the\nquestion that spurred the develop\xc2\xb7\nment of a lightweight, flexible and\ndurable fabric made of woven Fiber\xc2\xb7\nglas\xc2\xae coated with Teflon~ During the\nApollo program, NASA sought to im\xc2\xb7\nprove upon the fabrics it had used in\nfashioning space suits for the Mercury\nand Gemini astronauts, and began its\nsearch for a durable and noncombusti\xc2\xb7\nble material that was also thin ,\nlightweight and flexible.\nAt the time, Owens\xc2\xb7Corning was\ndeveloping a glass fiber yam that\ncould be woven into a fabric. The fabric\nwas then coated with Teflon for added\nstrength, durability and hydrophobi\xc2\xb7\ncity-the ability to repel moisture. The\nmaterial met NASA specifications and\nwas used in space suits throughout\nthe Apollo era.\nThe technology developed for the\nspace program soon found additional\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1985\n\napplications. The health care market\nrequired flame\xc2\xb7resistant draperies and\nthe Fiberglas fabric was adapted for\nthat use. A more recent application is\nin the construction field, where a\nheavier version of the Fiberglas fabric\nis used as a permanent covering-or\nroof-for an airport terminal in Saudi\nArabia, animal enclosures at zoos in\nBoston and North Carolina, stadiums\nin Michigan and Canada, and shopping\nmalls in Miami, Fla, Knoxville, Tenn.,\nHouston, Texas, San Mateo, Cal., and\nAlbany, N.Y.\nThe construction adaptation of the\nFiberglas fabric is marketed under the\ntrade name Sheer\xc2\xb7FiII\xc2\xae by O.C. Bird Air\nof Buffalo, New York, a jOint venture\nfabric structures company owned by\nOwens-Coming and Chemical Fabrics.\n(Structo\xc2\xb7Fab, a trade name registered\nby Owens\xc2\xb7Corning prior to the joint\nventure agreement, is currently being\nphased out.)\nSheer\xc2\xb7FiII is gaining popularity with\nbuilding engineers and owners for a\nnumber of reasons. The fabric\'s trans\xc2\xb7\nlucency value, which ranges from 4 to\n18 percent, reduoes lighting needs and\nits reflectivity lowers cooling costs, so\nSheer\xc2\xb7Fill is considered energy effi\xc2\xb7\n\ncient. The Teflon coating reduces\nmaintenance costs by increasing the\nfabric\'s resistance to moisture,\ntemperature extremes and deteriora\xc2\xb7\ntion. Pound for pound, Sheer\xc2\xb7Fili is\nstronger than steel and weighs less\nthan five ounces per square foot.\nThese factors combine to lower initial\ncosts and speed construction.\nArchitects are favorably impressed\nwith Sheer\xc2\xb7Fili as well. It combines the\naesthetic appeal of light, airy and\nunobstructed spans with a degree of\nspace utilization that invites innovative\ndesign concepts-domes, atriums\nand sharply sloping roofs reminiscent\nof circus tents.\nTypically, fabric structures are built\nin one of two ways. Either they\'re ten\xc2\xb7\nsian structures that are supported by\na network of cables and pylons, or ai r\xc2\xb7\nsupported structures that consist of\nan outer membrane and an inner liner.\nThe area between these two layers is\ninflated to maintain the pressure dif\xc2\xb7\nferential necessary for roof rigidity.\nThe air\xc2\xb7supported structure concept\nis also being applied in creating domes\nto protect and shield radar and micro\xc2\xb7\nwave antennas. The radome\xc2\xae provides\nan electromagnetic window for the\nmicrowave landing control antennas\nused by air traffic controllers, and the\nFAA is currently using radomes in\ndeveloping its experimental wind\nshear detection radar system. Again,\nthe material in use is Teflon\xc2\xb7coated\nfiberglas fabric, all of which goes to\nshow just how far innovative tech\xc2\xb7\nnology can travel-from the earth to\nthe moon and back. 0\n189\n\nZero defects at zero gravity.\nWhen you\'re working on America\'s first space station, the ultimate goal is\nzero defects at zero gravity.\nWhich is why NASA depends on Honeywell Reliability to make outer space\nideas a reality.\nHoneywell hasplayed a major role in every one of NASA\'s manned space missions, from the X15 through Gemini and Apollo, to SkyLab and the Space Shuttle.\nAnd now we\'re working with other leaders in the aerospace industry to engineer\ncritical control systems for life support, power distribution and guidance and\nnavigation for NASA\'s first space station, scheduled for deployment in the mid-199Os.\nHoneywell combines advanced technology with reliable performance\nto insure America\'s space program will succeed well into the 21st century - ~\nand beyond.\n.....\n\n1"1\n\nHoneywell Reliability\nTogeth er. we can find the answe rs.\n\nHoneywell\nCircle Reader Action No. 364\n\n'
