The results are summarized and they indicate that the maximum delay in performing screen change requests should be less than 2.5 sec., occurring for a slow VAX host to video screen I/O rate of 50 KBps. This delay is due to the average I/O rate from the video terminals to their host computer. Software structure of the main computers and the host computers will have greater impact on screen change or refresh response times. The HOSC data system model was updated by a newly coded PASCAL based simulation program which was installed on the HOSC VAX system. This model is described and documented. Suggestions are offered to fine tune the performance of the ETERNET interconnection network. Suggestions for using the Nutcracker by Excelan to trace itinerate packets which appear on the network from time to time were offered in discussions with the HOSC personnel. Several visits to the HOSC facility were to install and demonstrate the simulation model.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880001487, "id": "4ce0ae60ff5143bc88cfa552b9b55af3", "publicationDate": "1987-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880001487.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880001487/downloads/19880001487.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880001487/downloads/19880001487.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880001487/downloads/19880001487.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
