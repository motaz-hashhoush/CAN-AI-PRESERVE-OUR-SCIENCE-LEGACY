These\naviation fueling requirements are outlined in MILDTL-83133F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 Annex\n(2011) standards, and are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d\nfuel replacements. This paper provides combustor\nperformance\ndata\nfor\nsynthetic-paraffinickerosene- (SPK-) type (Fisher-Tropsch (FT)) fuel\nand blends with JP-8+100, relative to JP-8+100 as\nbaseline fueling. Data were taken at various\nnominal inlet conditions: 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at\n500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K), 125 psia (0.86 MPa) at 625 \xef\x82\xb0F\n(603 K), 175 psia (1.21 MPa) at 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K),\nand 225 psia (1.55 MPa) at 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K).\nCombustor performance analysis assessments were\nmade for the change in flame temperatures,\ncombustor efficiency, wall temperatures, and\nexhaust plane temperatures at 3%, 4%, and 5%\ncombustor pressure drop (%\xef\x81\x84P) for fuel: air ratios\n(F/A) ranging from 0.010 to 0.025. Significant\ngeneral trends show lower liner temperatures and\nhigher flame and combustor outlet temperatures\nwith increases in FT fueling relative to JP-8+100\nfueling. The latter affects both turbine efficiency\nand blade/vane life.\n\nFinding an alternative fuel for aviation application\nrequires a fuel feedstock with sustainable supply at\na low cost with low or no negative environmental\nimpact. The requirements for these \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel\nreplacements are outlined in the MIL-DTL83133F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 Annex (2011),\napproved standards for military and civil use,\nrespectively. Alternate jet fuels need to be\ncompatible with current engines and aircraft fuel\nhandling systems in order to reduce the need for\nnew systems to accommodate new fuels that may\nperform differently than the currently used\npetroleum fuels.\n\nKeywords: gas turbine engines, combustors,\nSPK-FT fuel, alternate fuel, combustor\nperformance\n\nEven proven alternate fuels face tough issues such\nas secure, sustainable productivity at competitive\npricing.\nRecently,\nthe\nFederal\nAviation\nAdministration (FAA) announced support of eight\ncompanies conducting research into commercial jet\nfuel alternatives that conform to ASTM D 7566\nand are based on resources readily available in the\nUnited States [1]. One of the ideas being explored\nis to produce aviation fuels from carbon monoxide\ngiven off by industrial waste gases that would\notherwise add to atmospheric pollution. Another\nidea is to explore the conversion from cellulosic\nand conventional plant sugars to fuels. Others\ninvolve the development of catalysts to convert\ndifferent carbon sources into fuels in small-scale\nreactors to serve as distributed fuel production\n\n1\n\nsources. Currently, the biofuels used by the US\nNavy cost about $26/gal ($6.87/L) [2]. The money\nthat the FAA is funneling into these project could\nboost the production of cost-effective fuels from\nbiomass and waste feedstocks to afford a potential\nfor commercial and military aviation fueling. Yet\nto date, the alternate fuels industry competitive\ncosts and productivity have not responded to\nfeedstock restraints, incentives, subsides, or\nmandates, and compliance taxes are passed to\nconsumers [3].\nAdopting alternate fuels and fuel blends requires\nthe use of fuel-flexible systems (combustors and\nengines)\nwithout\nsacrificing\nperformance\nrequirements. For military aviation, an alternative\nfor traditional fuel for gas turbine and diesel\nsystems is required. However, in many proposed\nalternates, the lack of sufficient amounts of\naromatics that swell some fuel system seals and\nsulfur, which provides fuel injection pump\nlubricity, has the potential to reduce design\ncomponent useful life [4]. For these fuels, additives\nare needed to increase useful component life while\nmaintaining the performance. It is thought that FTtype fuels can support gas turbine engines at\nsimilar levels as well as have potential use for\ndiesel systems.\nThis paper provides preliminary combustor\nperformance data for SPK-type FT fuel and blends\nrelative to pure JP-8+100 (herein referred to as\n\xe2\x80\x9cJP-8\xe2\x80\x9d), the currently used aviation fuel. Data for\n\xe2\x80\x9cCombustor A,\xe2\x80\x9d a three-cup sector representative\nof current engine combustor technology (see CFD\nimages [6], proprietary details withheld), were\ntaken at 0%, 50%, and 100% FT fueling (denoted\nas JP-8, 50:50, and FT, respectively) with varied\nparameters of fuel:air ratio (F/A), percent\ncombustor pressure drop (%\xce\x94P), and absolute\npressure. The data collected show that higher\ncombustor operating temperatures have the\npotential to enhance system efficiency, but also\ntake a toll on component life, as they have a greater\nimpact on the oxidation and failure of the materials\nwithin the combustor and turbine. A small\ntemperature difference of combustor gas entering\nthe turbine can both be critical to turbine life and\naffect efficiency; there is a need for a good\nbalance. \xe2\x80\x9cBleed air,\xe2\x80\x9d used to cool the combustor,\ncase, turbine blades, vanes, and nozzles, could be\nincreased to compensate for the enhanced turbine\ninlet temperature; this parasitic air decreases the\n\nsystem efficiency but helps to maintain a\nreasonable turbine life.\nFuel specifications; the test facility conditions,\noperations, schematic, and fueling system;\nestimates of measurement errors; and combustor\nthermal data and postprocessing parameters of\nCombustor A are given in the Shouse, et al. paper\npresented at ISROMAC 13 [5]; the computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and figures of\ncombustor geometry and flow are in the Ryder, et\nal. paper [6] also presented there. Compositional\nexamination of the synthetic-paraffinic kerosene\nwith the compositional-explicit distillation curve\nmethod is discussed in Bruno et al. [7] who makes\na useful comparison for heats of combustion based\non molecular weight, volume, and mass.\nCombustor Thermal Performance\nThe proprietary-geometry combustor, labeled as\n\xe2\x80\x9cCombustor A,\xe2\x80\x9d used for data collection represents\na three-cup sector of a current engine combustor\ntechnology. The Shouse, et al. paper [5] outlines\nthe results given for the 225-psia (1.55-MPa) inlet\ncondition, for three fueling compositions and three\nF/A at 3% \xce\x94P, and this paper continues to analyze\nall four inlet combustor conditions at all three\ncombustor \xce\x94P values tested for the FischerTropsch fuel blends of 0%, 50%, and 100% with\nJP-8 fueling. Data were taken at various nominal\ninlet conditions as follows:\n1. FT fuel composition: 0%, 50%, and 100%\n(\xc2\xb15%)\n2. Pressure (P) and temperature (T): 75 psia\n(0.52 MPa) and 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K), 125 psia\n(0.86 MPa) and 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K), 175 psia\n(1.21 MPa) and 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K), and 225 psia\n(1.55 MPa) and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K).\n3.

Fuel:air ratios (F/A): 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, and\n0.025\nCombustor performance analysis assessments were\nmade for the change in flame temperatures (Tflame),\ncombustor efficiency, wall temperatures, and\nexhaust plane temperatures (Tplane).\nThe combustion efficiencies do not provide enough\ninsight for determining significant combustor\nchanges, yet they do show a trend to decrease with\nincreased %\xce\x94P; thus, other aforementioned (Tflame\nand Tplane) parameters will also be investigated.\n2\n\nTable 1 Combustor efficiency data summary\n[(P,T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa), 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)].]\n%\xef\x81\x84P\n3%\n4%\n5%\nF/A\n0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020 0.025 0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020 0.025 0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020 0.025\nFuel\nEfficiency, %\nJP-8\n99.61\n99.32\n99.56\n99.10\n99.46\n99.20\n50:50\n99.65\n99.24\n99.56\n99.09\n99.46\n98.90\nFT\n99.66\n99.20\n99.58\n98.96\n99.48\n98.87\nAverage\n99.64\n99.25\n99.56\n99.05\n99.47\n98.99\nSt. Dev.\n0.024\n0.058\n0.011\n0.080\n0.013\n0.181\n\nFig.1 Sidewall temperature variation along the combustor (from FWD to AFT) with F/A and fuel\ncomposition at 4% \xef\x81\x84P for (P,T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa), 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)], and (P,T)inlet = [125 psia\n(0.86 MPa), 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)].\nAt 75 psia (0.52 MPa) the combustion efficiency of\nall fuel blends are outlined in Table 1 [5].\nSurface Thermal Measurements\nThermocouples and pressure taps were placed\nthroughout the combustion chamber to record\ntemperature and pressure. The details of pressure\ndrop measurements will not be presented in this\npaper, but it should be noted that no inconsistent\npressure measurements were found. The\nconvection-cooled liner and wall surface\ntemperature measurements are noted as sidewall or\nliner (i.e., facing inside or outside of the liner).\nSidewalls\n\nThe forward, middle, and aft axial positions of the\nthermocouples along the sector combustor\nsidewalls are represented as FWD, MID, and AFT.\nFigure 1 represents the sidewall temperature data\nobtained from the (P,T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa),\n500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)], and (P,T)inlet = [125 psia\n(0.86 MPa, 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)], runs at 4% \xef\x81\x84P. This\nfigure adequately represents the sidewall\n\ntemperature trends shown for all inlet pressures\nand %\xef\x81\x84P. Sidewall temperature profiles illustrate a\ndecrease in temperature from the FWD to MID\nsections and an increase in temperatures from the\nMID to AFT along the combustor, where the\ntemperatures are highest. The temperatures also\nincrease as the F/A increases, the only exception\nbeing the F/A of 0.025 at 75 psia (0.52 MPa) inlet\npressure, which slightly decreases in temperature\nrelative to the F/A of 0.020. The 75 psia\n(0.52 MPa) data set is the only one that includes\nF/A of 0.025. Data for 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 3%,\n4%, and 5% \xef\x81\x84P at the F/A of 0.025 are consistent\nwith this trend, with insufficient data to conclude\nwhether this is a peak in combustor temperatures\naround F/A = 0.020. The sidewall temperatures\ndepend strongly on F/A and weakly on the fuel\nblend composition.\nUnwrapped Combustor Liner\n\nFigure 2 is a representative plot of the unwrapped\nliner surface temperatures; this for F/A of 0.010 at\n(P,T)inlet [75 psia (0.52 MPa), 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)], The\n3\n\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cunwrapped\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the normalized outside\nliner surface circumference (0 to 1) along with the\nnormalized inner liner circumferential surface (1 to\n2) as a continuous loop mapped onto a plane. The\nunwrapped combustor liner temperature profile\nshows a peak temperature increase measured by\nthe thermocouple as %\xef\x81\x84P increases as well as an\nincrease with F/A.\nThe absolute inlet pressure and temperature of the\nsystem also shows an effect on the peak liner\ntemperature (Fig. 2). Overall, the peaks in the\ntemperature profile become more pronounced as\nF/A increases. They also become more pronounced\nas %\xef\x81\x84P increases, but F/A appears to have the\ngreater effect.\n\nUsing Fig. 2, it is difficult to differentiate between\nthe temperature differences of the varied fuel\nblends. By calculating the difference in\ntemperatures read by the thermocouples at each\nlocation on the combustor for the blend and the\n100% FT fuel relative to those recorded for JP-8\n,that is, \xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8, a better sense for\neach fuel\xe2\x80\x99s performance may be obtained. Figure 3\nillustrates the trends seen for the average\ntemperature differences in relation to F/A at\n(P,T)inlet = [125 psia (0.86 MPa), 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)]\nand [225 psia (1.55 MPa) and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)] at\n\nFig.2 Unwrapped liner temperature profile for F/A = 0.010 and (P,T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa), 500 \xef\x82\xb0F\n(533 K)] at 3% and 5% \xef\x81\x84P.\n\nFig.3 Average liner temperature differences (\xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8) versus F/A for (P,T)inlet = [125 psia\n(0.86 MPa), 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)] and [225 psia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)] at 3% \xef\x81\x84P. The sidewall temperature\nat the FWD position (TSWFD) was found to be a possible outlier and was excluded from one set of averages\nfor a better comparison. Temperatures represent combined heat transfer effects.\n4\n\nTable 2 Average Unwrapped Liner Temperature Differences:a,b FT Fuel and 50:50 Blend\nWith Respect to JP-8+100 (Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8) (\xef\x82\xb0F) [\xef\x81\x84T (\xef\x82\xb0F) = 1.8\xef\x81\x84T (K)\nF/A = 0.010\nF/A = 0.015\nF/A = 0.020\nF/A = 0.025\nJP- FT 50:50 JP-8 FT 50:50 JP-8 FT 50:50 JP-8 FT 50:50\nInlet Pressure\n%\xef\x81\x84P\n8\n75 psia\n3%\n0\n\xe2\x80\x934\n\xe2\x80\x935\n0\n1\n\xe2\x80\x936\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9315 \xe2\x80\x9311\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9312 \xe2\x80\x9316\n(0.52 MPa)\n4%\n0\n\xe2\x80\x932\n0\n0\n\xe2\x80\x932\n\xe2\x80\x932\n0\n\xe2\x80\x939\n\xe2\x80\x937\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9312\n\xe2\x80\x938\n5%\n0\n\xe2\x80\x933\n\xe2\x80\x932\n0\n\xe2\x80\x931\n\xe2\x80\x932\n0\n\xe2\x80\x932\n\xe2\x80\x933\n0\n\xe2\x80\x933\n1\n125 psia\n3%\n0\n\xe2\x80\x936\n\xe2\x80\x936\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9320 \xe2\x80\x9315\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9328 \xe2\x80\x9318\n(0.86 MPa)\n4%\n0\n1\n\xe2\x80\x931\n0\n\xe2\x80\x936\n\xe2\x80\x936\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9329 \xe2\x80\x9316\n5%\n0\n6\n2\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9310\n\xe2\x80\x935\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9323 \xe2\x80\x9311\n175 psia\n3%\n0\n7\n2\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9325\n\xe2\x80\x936\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9339 \xe2\x80\x9318\n(1.21 MPa)\n4%\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9313 \xe2\x80\x9310\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9322 \xe2\x80\x9314\n5%\n0\n2\n1\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9311\n\xe2\x80\x937\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9326 \xe2\x80\x9317\n225 psia\n3%\n0\n12\n12\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9320 \xe2\x80\x9313\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9346 \xe2\x80\x9316\n(1.55 MPa)\n4%\n0\n18\n17\n0\n\xe2\x80\x939\n\xe2\x80\x934\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9331 \xe2\x80\x9314\n5%\n0\n6\n3\n0\n\xe2\x80\x939\n1\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9339 \xe2\x80\x9314\na\n\n[(P, T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa), 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K)], [125 psia (0.86 MPa), 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K)],\n[175 psia (1.21 MPa), 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K)], and [225 psia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)].\nb\n\xce\x94T < 0 implies cooler liner temperature.\n\n3% \xef\x81\x84P and gives a better picture for the heat\nperformance of the fuels. Table 2 outlines all the\naverage temperature differences (convective and\nradiation cooling) for all testing conditions.\nThe overall trend shows that at F/A = 0.010, both\nthe blend and the FT fuel generally run at higher\ntemperatures than JP-8 for all pressure values. As\nthe F/A increases, the 50:50 blend and the FT fuel\ntemperatures decrease, ending with cooler\noperating temperatures relative to JP-8 at the 0.020\nratio. With respect to the increasing F/A, there is a\nlarger deviation in the temperature performance of\nthe FT and 50:50 fuels. At the higher F/A, the FT\nfuel runs at temperatures cooler than both the JP-8\nand the blend, illustrating that at these higher F/A\nvalues, the impact of the FT performance within\nthe blend decreases and JP-8 performance\ndominates. This would mean that at high F/A, the\nFT fuel would decrease liner temperatures relative\nto the JP-8 and the 50:50 blend and could increase\ncomponent life within the combustor and yet not\nthe turbine. Also, greater temperature differences\nare shown for higher inlet pressures and\ntemperatures.\nCombustion Exhaust Rake Temperature\nThe exhaust plane temperature trends are\nillustrated in Fig. 4. These temperature profiles\n\nrepresent data-averaged temperature values\ncollected through use of a temperature probe (rake)\nplaced in the exhaust plane of the combustor. In\nthese data, the signal from the top thermocouple\nwas lost. For all data sets, there is a monotone\nincrease in the exhaust plane temperature as F/A is\nincreased. The increase in %\xef\x81\x84P also creates an\nincrease in the temperature. At higher percent\ncombustor pressure drop values and higher F/A, the\nFT fuel tends to run at higher exhaust temperatures\ncompared to JP-8 and the blend, which also gives\nslightly higher temperatures. Upon further analysis,\nas F/A increases, the FT fuel, while at higher\nexhaust plane temperature, generally has less effect\non the performance of the blend compared to that\nof JP-8. There is not a large temperature difference\nbetween the fuels at the higher %\xef\x81\x84P and F/A (\xef\x81\x84T =\nTfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8 = ~20\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0F (11\xe2\x80\x9327 \xc2\xb0C)) where\nthere are larger differences at higher inlet\ntemperatures and pressures; however, a small\nchange in temperature can have major impact on\nthe turbine life and efficiency, so these effects must\nbe taken into consideration when selecting an\nalternative turbine engine fuel.\nPlotting the combustor exhaust rake temperature\ndifferences versus the inlet pressure and F/A\n(Fig. 5) displays a minimum, above which the\nvariables have a positive effect on the combustor\nperformance of alternate fuels over JP-8 fuels.\n\n5\n\nFig.4 Variation of exhaust plume temperatures with percent fueling as a function of F/A for\n(P, T)inlet = [75 psia (0.52 MPa) and 500\xef\x82\xb0 F (533 K)] and [225 psia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)], at 3% \xef\x81\x84P.\n\nFig.5 Combustor exhaust rake temperature differences (\xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8, \xef\x82\xb0F) versus inlet pressure and\nF/A for 3% \xef\x81\x84P for 100% FT fuel, showing pressure and F/A combinations that improve performance\n(warmer colors) (1 MPa = 145 psia).\nPerforming the same analysis for all %\xef\x81\x84P\nconditions for both the 100% and 50:50 FT fuel\ntemperature difference data, it is clear that\nincreasing the inlet pressure increases the\ntemperature differences of the FT fuel compared to\nJP-8. There also appears to be a peak in\nperformance around 3\xe2\x80\x934% \xef\x81\x84P for the alternate fuel\nin relation to the performance of JP-8 (illustrated in\nFig. 6).\nCalculated flame temperature data are outlined in\nFig. 7 for 225 psia (1.55 MPa) at 3% \xef\x81\x84P. As the\ninlet pressure and temperature is increased, there is\na small increase in the flame temperature. The\nsame trend is displayed with increasing %\xef\x81\x84P,\n\nalthough %\xef\x81\x84P does not seem to affect the\ntemperature differences between the fuels to a\nsignificant extent. The %\xce\x94P trend is more\npronounced than that of the changing inlet pressure\nand temperature, especially when increasing F/A.\nAt higher F/A, there is a greater difference in flame\ntemperatures between the fuels. The FT generally\nhad higher flame temperatures than the JP-8, and\nthe 50:50 blend temperatures fell temperatures\nbetween the FT and the JP-8 fuel. These trends are\nalso displayed in Table 3, which contains the flame\ntemperature differences between JP-8 and the FT\nfuels. No significant trend determining whether the\nFT or JP-8 performance had the dominant role in\nthe flame temperature performance of the 50:50\nblend was found.\n6\n\nFig.6 Combustor rake temperature differences (\xef\x81\x84T = Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8, \xef\x82\xb0F) versus inlet pressure and F/A for\n3%, 4%, and 5% \xef\x81\x84P for 100% and 50:50 FT fuel with respect to JP-8, showing pressure and F/A\ncombinations that improve performance (warmer colors) [\xef\x81\x84T (\xef\x82\xb0F) = 1.8\xef\x81\x84T (K)] [1 MPa = 145 psia].\n\n7\n\nincreasing F/A and %\xef\x81\x84P but seem unaffected by\nthe type of fuel blend to a significant extent. Lower\nliner temperatures result from decreased radiative\nheat transfer from reduced aromatic content.\nThe 100% FT fuel tends to run at higher exhaust\ntemperatures compared to the JP-8 and 50:50 blend\nfuels, with a similar trend for flame temperature.\nOverall, increasing F/A and %\xef\x81\x84P increases the\nthermal performance of the combustor, which will\nalmost always occur unless there is a decrease in\nthe efficiency of combustion.\nFig.7 Calculated flame temperature (Tflame) variation\nwith F/A and fuel composition for (P,T)inlet = [225\npsia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)] at 3% \xef\x81\x84P.\nTable 3 Flame temperature differences (Tfuel blend \xe2\x80\x93 TJP-8)\n(\xef\x82\xb0F) for (P,T)inlet = [225 psia (1.55 MPa), 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)]\nFuel\nF/A\n%\xef\x81\x84P\n3%\n5%\n4%\n0.010 73 (41) 107 (59) 71 (39)\nFT \xef\x80\xadJP-8\n84 (47) 63 (35)\n0.015 94 (52)\n0.020 34 (19) 105 (58) 90 (50)\n90 (50) 33 (18)\n50:50 \xef\x80\xadJP-8 0.010 55 (31)\n0.015 43 (24)\n41 (23) 52 (29)\n0.020 \xe2\x80\x933 (\xe2\x80\x932)\n42 (23) 70 (39)\n\nValues in parenthesis are in Kelvins.\nConclusions\nThe data and analysis of combustor sector alternate\nfuel performance of Combustor A show lower\naverage liner temperatures and higher flame and\naverage combustor outlet temperatures with\nincreasing FT relative to JP-8+100 fueling. The\nlatter affects turbine efficiency and blade/vane life\nand may be due to the higher heat of combustion of\nthe FT fuel per unit mass. Thus, the engine would\nnot be running at higher F/A. A more accurate way\nto assess how these outlet temperatures will affect\nthe turbine life would be to look at the pattern\nfactor of the exhaust temperatures.\nSidewall temperatures depend mainly on F/A for\nperformance decreasing in temperature from the\nFWD to MID and increasing in temperature from\nthe MID to AFT. The unwrapped liner temperature\ndata show that the blend and the FT fuel run hotter\nthan JP-8 at lower F/A, but cooler at F/A above\n~0.015. At the higher F/A values the FT fuel\ntemperature differs moreso from the JP-8 than the\nblend. Peak liner temperatures also increase with\n\nReferences\n[1] Federal Aviation Administration, December 2011,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPress Release \xe2\x80\x93 FAA Announces Alternative Energy\nInvestments For Cleaner, More Sustainable Jet Fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\nhttp://www.faa.gov/news/\npress_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=13254.\n[2] DiMascio, J., 6 December 2011, AEROSPACE\nDAILY & DEFENSE REPORT, Vol.240, Issue 45, The\nMcGraw-Hill Companies Inc.\n[3] The Wall Street Journal, 13 December 2011, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nCellulosic Ethanol Debacle,\xe2\x80\x9d REVIEW & OUTLOOK\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/\nSB10001424052970204012004577072470158115782.htm\nl?mod=WSJ_Opinion_AboveLEFTTop\n[4] Batt, R.J., McMillan, J.A., Bradbury, I.P., \xe2\x80\x9cLubricity\nadditives - performance and no-harm effects in low sulfur\nfuels,\xe2\x80\x9d SAE Special Publications, 1215:9-18, Oct 1996,\nDiesel Performance and Additives.\n[5] Shouse, D.T., Neuroth, C., Hendricks, R.C., Lynch,\nA.C., Frayne, W., Stutrud, J.S., Corporan, E., Hankins,\nCapt.
