The design and analysis efforts in Phase I indicated that this is feasible.\nAerodynamic heating and loads were found to be orders of magnitude less than typical planetary\nentries due to the ultra-low ballistic coefficient craft and the low density and large scale height of\nthe Pluto atmosphere. The deceleration system is capable of delivering a 200-kg lander-hopper to\nthe surface or inserting an orbiter of a similar mass using aerocapture. Mission analysis work led\nto a reference mission with Earth launch in 2029, Jupiter assist in 2030, and Pluto arrival in 2040.\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation and its research partner, ILC Dover, have documented in this report\nthe results of the design and analytical modeling efforts during the contract period (9 May 2017 \xe2\x80\x93\n9 February 2018).

The next opportunity for a similar\nmission will not be available until 2042 when Jupiter is again positioned for a gravity assist.\nSo how can we land on or orbit Pluto without many hundreds of millions of dollars in nuclear\npower sources, a next generation launch vehicle, or a massive propulsion system?\nOne way is to launch a probe on a trajectory similar to New Horizons and on the approach trajectory\ndeploy a large, lightweight inflatable drag device. The low density Pluto atmosphere has a scale\nheight of ~60 km, nearly 8 times larger than at Earth, allowing the atmospheric drag to slowly\ndissipate the 50 gigajoules of kinetic energy from the incoming probe traveling at 14 km/s.\nContrary to prior thought, recent studies show that the Pluto atmosphere does not collapse and may\nhave increasing atmospheric pressure with time in the current epoch [1], making the 2029 window\nattractive for this mission.\nOnly one nuclear power source, a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG),\nwhich is currently in production by DOE, is needed to power onboard spacecraft systems.\nDepending on the trajectory and flight path angle, the probe can either descend to the surface and\ndeliver a 200-kg lander-hopper or insert an orbiter via aerocapture. We deem this spacecraft and\nentry vehicle architecture Entrycraft.\n\nFigure 1. Entrycraft components (not to scale). Inflated envelope diameter is 70-m.\nUpper-left: 70-m diameter inflated decelerator envelope with load lines, upper-right: interplanetary cruise\nconfiguration showing thrusters, RTG radiator, inflation tanks, and support structure, lower-left: lander-hopper\nshowing science payload, antenna, propellant tanks, structure, and RTG, lower-right: top view of the stowed\nEntrycraft.\n\n1\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\n2.1 Innovation\nThis mission concept is enabled by the use of ultra-light-weight, Enveloping Aerodynamic\nDecelerator (EAD) technology* (Figure 1). The Entrycraft combines the decelerator system with\nthe lander or orbiter payload that also performs all the needed function during the cruise to Pluto\nwithout a separate stage.\nWhy combine all systems into a single craft? Because the decelerator can enclose the lander within\nit during entry to protect it as it decelerates the system to terminal velocity. The non-rigid part of\nthe decelerator is an inflatable thin film envelope that can be made extraordinarily large while\nremaining lightweight, reducing entry heating rates and dynamic pressures by orders of magnitude\ncompared with current entry technology. Heat is radiated away through the film, on both the\ninterior and exterior, eliminating the need for bulky and massive high-temperature thermal\nprotection systems. The systems are also combined because the lander or orbiter can take\nadvantage of the same systems as interplanetary cruise mode (communications, computer, attitude\ncontrol, thrusters, power, etc.), and the rigid windward end of the decelerator can be used as the\nprimary spacecraft support structure.\nA roughly 330-kg, 70-meter diameter envelope and its load supporting elements can deliver a 200kg probe to the Pluto surface or into orbit. For perspective, the envelope is smaller in diameter than\nthe multi-ton scientific balloons NASA currently flies. Strong, lightweight load lines run from the\npayload to connection points at the envelope equator. The internal inflation pressure in the\nenvelope opposes the compressive loads resulting from the deceleration forces during entry. This\ndecelerator technology is easily transferrable to Entry, Deceleration and Landing (EDL) and\naerocapture into orbit at other planetary bodies with both significant and tenuous atmospheres,\nincluding Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan, and Triton. The focus of this study is on a Pluto mission,\nparticularly delivery of a Pluto lander to the surface though aerocapture was also studied to a\nlimited extent.\nThe current near Pluto lander sequence is as follows:\n(1) Deploy and inflate the decelerator envelope,\n(2) Jettison the inflation tanks and cruise RTG heat exchanger,\n(3) Enter the atmosphere at about 14 km/s with a nominal flight path angle of -63\xc2\xb0 at a reference\naltitude of 1600 km,\n(4) Decelerate to a speed of about 80-100 m/s at several hundred meters above the surface,\n(5) Separate the lander from the decelerator, deploy landing legs, and fire thrusters to land gently\nat the surface, making the propellant requirement for Pluto landing less than 8 kilograms,\n(6) Perform science measurements at the initial landing site, and\n(7) Fire the onboard thrusters to \xe2\x80\x9chop\xe2\x80\x9d around the surface and investigate up to 10s of kilometers\nof distance.\nThis ConOps is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n* US Patent 9,884,693 issued February 6, 2018.\n\n2\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n2.2 Science Application and Capabilities\nThe primary application for the Entrycraft is to deliver a lander-hopper to the surface of Pluto that\nhas the ability to perform scientific investigations of the crust and atmosphere. These\ninvestigations could (1) shed new light on its origins and relationship to other Kuiper Belt objects\nand other planets using in-situ surface sampling and chemical analysis; (2) characterize the\ndynamics between the subsurface and the atmosphere by investigating outgassing processes such\nas cryovolcanism (hop over a plume!); (3) expand the understanding of surface geomorphology\nusing hi-res imaging and IR spectrometry from multiple locations (on approach, during descent,\nand at the surface); (4) validate New Horizons measurements including atmospheric pressure and\ntemperature profiles; (5) study the nature of the its crust and search for hypothesized [2] liquid\nwater oceans using subsurface radar sounding, soil penetrometry, and perhaps a drill. In addition,\nthe approach and descent imaging and measurements will be used to develop and plan the sequence\nof hops and jumps at the surface.\nWhile the focus for this NIAC Phase I effort is a lander, another option for the Entrycraft is to\ninsert a spacecraft into Pluto orbit via aerocapture. An orbiter could enable high-resolution image\nmapping of the entire surface, well beyond what New Horizons was able to capture. Furthermore,\nan orbiting spacecraft would also allow for detailed investigation of atmosphere composition and\ndust particles. The orbiter could also have the capability to release a small lander that could\nperform a short-duration surface science mission.\n\nFigure 2. Concept of operations.\nEntrycraft enters from interplanetary speed and deploys the envelope prior to entry. The decelerator reduces the\nspeed to 100 m/s when the lander-hopper is released and performs a burn for landing. It subsequently uses its\nonboard propulsion system to explore the Pluto surface.\n\n3\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n3 Phase I Project Tasks\nIn this section we summarize the Phase I project tasks that were carried out. We refined\natmospheric models, system-level requirements, and concept of operations; evaluated entry\ntrajectories; carried out the decelerator conceptual design and analysis; developed the landerhopper conceptual design; and generated an integrated system mass breakdown.\n3.1.1.\n\nTask 1: Refine Atmospheric Models, System-Level Requirements, and Concept\nof Operations\n\nA detailed Pluto atmosphere model from New Horizons observations was compiled and integrated\ninto a format for EDL analysis. Next, we established the system-level requirements. This began\nby generating a reference interplanetary trajectory from which the launch and arrival parameters\ncould be established. We also selected a launch vehicle. We generated a notional payload design\nfrom which the lander design could be based. Finally, we considered an alternate Entrycraft\nConOps for orbit insertion using aerocapture.\n3.1.2.\n\nTask 2: Evaluate Entry Trajectories\n\nIn this second task, we used first-order planetary aeroassist simulations to characterize the Pluto\nentry environment including convective heating rates, dynamic pressures, and g-loads. We\nanalyzed flight path angle time histories to assess skip-out and examined the effect of atmospheric\nvariation on the decelerator performance. Next, we conducted an approach and landing analysis to\ndetermine the accessible landing sites given the Pluto orbit geometry and interplanetary velocity\nvector at time of arrival. Finally, we conducted an analysis to evaluate the feasibility of using EAD\ntechnology for orbit capture.\n3.1.3.\n\nTask 3: Decelerator Design and Analysis\n\nThe majority of the work in this task focused on developing models and performing simulations\nto establish feasibility of the decelerator design concept. First, we performed structural analysis on\nthe decelerator envelope to determine static stresses and deformations. This was used to establish\nthe material requirements. Next we performed a low-order aeroelastic analysis to assess the\nsusceptibility of the envelope to flutter during entry and descent. This was followed by an\naerothermodynamics CFD analysis that was used to evaluate total heat flux including radiative\nheating from molecular dissociation and ionization in the shock layer. A thermal analysis that\nincluded internal convection was also used to determine component temperatures and evaluate\ninflation gas pressures during entry. Finally, the results from these data were used to develop a\nrobust decelerator envelope design that could withstand the entry loads. This included materials\nselection, reinforcement design, envelope patterning, seam design, load distribution concept\ndevelopment, and generation of an envelope system mass breakdown.\n3.1.4.\n\nTask 4: Lander-Hopper Conceptual Design\n\nSince the primary technical innovation in this work is the entry system, we developed a conceptuallevel design of the lander-hopper. We generated a lander-hopper design with CAD models and a\ncomponent mass breakdown. We also computed hop trajectories and the propellant requirements.\n\n4\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n3.1.5.\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nTask 5: Conceptual Integrated System Design\n\nIn this final technical task, we compiled a list of components needed for the integrated Entrycraft\nduring cruise to Pluto and generated a total launch mass breakdown.\n3.1.1.\n\nTask 6: Planning and Reporting\n\nWe attended the NIAC orientation meeting on June 6-7, 2017, on September 21, 2018, we released\na press release on the NIAC symposium briefing, presented the concept at the NIAC Symposium\non September 25, 2017, submitted a Quarterly Report on December, 13, 2017, and submitted this\nFinal Report on February 8, 2018.\n\n5\n\n14 February

project:\n\xef\x83\xb0 The Pluto atmosphere, based on New Horizons measurements, has sufficient density for\ndeceleration by a large drag device at interplanetary speed, with a density from the

New Horizons Pluto atmosphere density and temperature profiles.\nAtmospheric density ranges from order 10-4 kg/m3 to order 10-13 kg/m3 from the surface to 1500 km. Temperature\nat the surface is about 40 K and increases higher in altitude.\n\n5.1 Atmospheric Modeling\nA detailed Pluto atmosphere model from New Horizons observations was compiled and integrated\ninto a format for EDL analysis. We obtained [3] the atmospheric pressure, number density,\ntemperature, and species composition as a function of altitude. Figure 3 shows a subset of the\nprocessed data, particularly total density and temperature. The key parameter for determining the\ndrag device feasibility at Pluto is the atmospheric density profile. The atmospheric density in the\naltitude range between the Pluto surface and 400 km is roughly equivalent in density to the 70 \xe2\x80\x93\n120 km altitude range on Earth, which we will later show to be ideal for the Entrycraft decelerator.\nFigure 3 also shows \xc2\xb1 50% density profiles that we will used to briefly assess effects of\natmospheric measurement uncertainty.\n5.2 System Requirements and Reference Interplanetary Trajectory\nThe next part of this task was to establish the system-level requirements. Key system-level\nrequirements include launch energy; launch mass; flight time to Pluto, landed mass; power;\nlanding site Earth communications and solar conditions; and lander duration of operation. A\npreliminary list of requirements is shown below.\n\n8\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\xef\x81\xb1\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nLaunch Energy - <166 km2/s2\nLaunch Mass <1030 kg\nFlight Time \xe2\x80\x93 <4400 days (12 years)\nLanded Mass \xe2\x80\x93 200 kg\nPower \xe2\x80\x93 Less than or equal to 100 W or one MMRTG\nEarth Communications \xe2\x80\x93 Significant direct line-of-sight communications, e.g. >80% of time\nSolar conditions \xe2\x80\x93 Significant daylight conditions, e.g. >80% of time\nLander duration of operation \xe2\x80\x93 >1 year\nNumber of lander hops \xe2\x80\x93 two or more\n\nIn order to do determine if we could satisfy most of these requirements, we first analyzed several\ninterplanetary launch windows for Earth to Pluto trajectories with a Jupiter gravity assist flyby.\nWe then generated a reference interplanetary trajectory from which the launch requirements could\nbe compared. We studied several launch opportunities and selected the 2028-2029 window for\nfurther analysis using a point-to-point conic (PPC) method. Because PPC analysis does not account\nfor the gravity of any body besides the Sun, the approach velocity at Pluto was adjusted in\naccordance with a comparison of the PPC and actual trajectories for the New Horizons (NH)\nmission.\nThe primary difference between the PPC and the actual NH trajectory is the effect of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s\ngravity on the interplanetary trajectory. Compared to the PPC analysis, the actual NH trajectory\nflies by Jupiter 10 days later than, arrives at Pluto about 9 months later, and with an arrival speed\nabout 1.5 km/s slower. Hence, we adjusted the PPC arrival speed by this amount. We decided not\nto change the arrival date for our analysis of arrival conditions since 9 months difference changes\nplanetary and arrival geometry conditions by less than a degree (Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s position relative to the\nSun changes by about 0.5\xc2\xb0). In Phase II, we intend to re-analyze the interplanetary trajectory and\nmake appropriate updates to account for a more accurate trajectory model. Note that we expect the\nlaunch C3 to be lower for this mission as compared to New Horizons, which means a somewhat\nlarger launch mass could be assumed.\nFigure 4 shows the Earth launch C3\xe2\x80\xa0, Pluto arrival velocity, and time of flight as a function of\nEarth launch date. Our reference trajectory has the following parameters: C3 of 116.64 km2/s2,\nPluto hyperbolic approach speed of about 14 km/s, total time of flight of 11 years 8 months, Earth\nlaunch date of January 4, 2029, Jupiter assist date of July 2, 2030, Pluto arrival date of September\n11, 2040. The Jupiter gravity assist requires a flyby at 3.6 Jupiter radii. Figure 5 shows the position\nof the planets at the Pluto arrival time.\nNote, for reference the New Horizons trajectory parameters are shown including the launch C3\nand equivalent Pluto hyperbolic approach speed (V-Infinity) as determined from PCC analysis.\nUsing the C3 from this reference trajectory, we determined the launch requirements. We assumed\nthe same launch vehicle that was used for the New Horizons probe, i.e., the Atlas 551 Star 48 V\nIOS, though it is unlikely that exact launcher would be available in 2029. The allowable launch\nmass for our reference launch energy is 1030 kg. This vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s payload fairing diameter is\nnominally 3.75-m and the cylinder height is 4.2-m. This is more than sufficient to accommodate\nour baseline Entrycraft with required cruise components. The payload (lander or orbiter) mass is\n\xe2\x80\xa0 Hyperbolic escape energy per kg in units of km2/s2\n\n9\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\ntherefore not limited by the launch vehicle in this case, but rather the entry loading limitations of\nthe decelerator envelope. The decelerator envelope size, mass and lander-hopper mass, however,\nare limited by the launcher payload limits. Figure 6 shows the range of acceptable envelope sizes\nand the effect on the current best estimate (CBE) launch and system mass. Allowable envelope\ndiameters are 70-100-m assuming an 8 \xef\x81\xadm film envelope with structural supporting elements and\na lander or orbiter payload of 200 kg.\nThere were no other imposed requirements on the system by NASA or other sources. A science\npayload definition was not yet available from the science community so we generated a baseline\nsuite of instruments with a current best estimate mass of 27.7 kg.\nTable 1.

Effect of envelope size on ballistic coefficient and CBE launch and entry mass.\nFor relevant envelope sizes ranging in diameter from 70 to 100 m, the ballistic coefficient ranges from 0.068 to\n0.055, the launch mass ranges from 625 to 1030 kg, and the entry mass ranges from 500 to 880 kg.\n\n11\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\n5.3 Concept of Operations\nThe launch of the Pluto Hop, Skip and Jump mission is assumed in early January of 2029 on board\na launcher with upper stage that can achieve the boost to high hyperbolic escape speed. At\ninjection, the Entrycraft is spin stabilized to enable the use of a simple solid rocket motor escape\nstage. After injection, the spin rate is reduced to about 3-5 rpm for the duration of cruise. The Earth\nescape velocity at infinity will be about 10.8 km/s, corresponding to a C3 of 116 km 2/s2 that will\ncarry the Entrycraft to a Jupiter in about a year and a half. At least two trajectory correction\nmaneuvers (TCMs) will be carried out between Earth and Jupiter; one shortly after launch and\nanother on the approach to Jupiter.\nFlyby of Jupiter in July of 2030 requires a close approach of 3.6 Jupiter radii of the planet or about\n188,000 km from the top of its atmosphere and inside Io\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. For this close approach to Jupiter,\nparticle radiation will be significant requiring protection in the form of radiation hard electronics\nand shielding. Fortunately, the flyby is fast keeping the total dose lower than NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Juno\nspacecraft, now orbiting Jupiter.\nDuring cruise the Entrycraft will periodically re-orient its spin axis and the high gain antenna\ntowards Earth for periodic communications and navigation radiometric data. After Jupiter flyby,\nthere will be at least two planned TCMs; one to correct the flyby errors at Jupiter and the last to\nadjust the approach trajectory for the proper flight path angle and timing for entry. After Jupiter,\nexcept for TCMs, the Entrycraft goes into a quiescent phase to reduce Entrycraft operations until\nnear Pluto approach about 10 years later. Prior to approach, the Entrycraft begins final navigation\noperations that could include optical images of Pluto and its star background by means of an optical\nnavigation camera located behind a protective glass window on the forward support structure\npointing approximately 180\xc2\xb0 to the direction of the high-gain antenna. This optical navigation\nactivity, combined with Earth-based radio navigation and a final TCM, will reduce the approach\ntargeting errors, facilitate achieving the proper Pluto entry flight path angle, and adjust the timing\nto ensure landing at a desired site on Pluto that was selected based on the New Horizons data.\nPrior to entry, the Earth communications are transferred to the low-gain antenna and attitude\norientation thrusters precess the Entrycraft\xe2\x80\x99s spin axis into the entry orientation. At this point the\ndecelerator envelope is deployed and inflated with helium gas. Deployment and inflation, which\nwill significantly reduce the spin rate, could occur several minutes to several hours before entry\nafter which the inflation tanks are jettisoned. Pluto entry interface occurs at a range of about 1600\nkm from the surface of Pluto about 15-20 minutes before landing. At this point the flight path angle\ntarget is -63\xc2\xb0 to ensure entry heating and deceleration loading does not exceed the material limits\nof the envelope. During entry and landing, the optical navigation camera images the Pluto surface\nat an increasingly higher resolution. These images will be used for subsequent planning for\nhopping operations. For a 70-m diameter envelope and a flight path angle of -63\xc2\xb0, peak stagnation\npoint heating rate, dynamic pressure and g-load of 3.4 W/cm2, 32 Pa, and 30 gees occur a little\nover 2 minutes into the entry sequence. Most of the entry sequence time is spent at an altitude\nbelow 100 km at a terminal velocity below about 125 m/s. Upon reaching ~700 m above the\nsurface, the lander separates from the envelope and performs a translation maneuver to avoid the\nslowed, but still descending, envelope and then the lander executes a propulsive burn to land on\nthe surface of Pluto.\nOnce on the surface, the high-gain antenna is deployed and begins a search maneuver in the\ndirection of the sun for a radio signal from Earth. After signal acquisition, entry and landing data\n\n12\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\ncan be communicated to Earth. Following lander-hopper systems checkout, science operations\ncommence with imaging, surface sampling and soil mass spectrometry, geophysical sounding, heat\nflow and seismometry, as well as atmospheric sampling.\nOnce, the initial landing site science objectives are completed, a hop to another landing site is\nplanned based on a combination of New Horizons data and the optical navigation camera images\ntaken on entry. A small propulsive burn is executed to put the lander on a parabolic trajectory\ntoward a second landing site. During the hop, imaging and spectroscopy data of the surface will\nbe obtained. A final propulsive burn is preformed just prior to touchdown for landing.\n\n13\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n6 Evaluate Entry Trajectories\nThis task involved three primary subtasks: (1) Lander entry trajectory parameter studies, (2) Pluto\napproach and landing analysis, and (3) Aerocapture analysis.\n6.1 Entry Trajectory Parameter Studies.\nThe lander entry trajectory parameters studies were conducted using GAC\xe2\x80\x99s Hypersonic Planetary\nAeroassist Simulation System (HyperPASS) trajectory analysis tool [4]. HyperPASS enables users\nto perform guided aerocapture, guided ballute aerocapture, aerobraking, orbit decay, or unguided\nentry simulations at any of seven target bodies (Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Titan, Neptune, or\nPluto). Pluto was added to the software for this NIAC effort and the most recent New Horizon\xe2\x80\x99s\nPluto atmosphere data (Figure 3) was used. HyperPASS has been validated using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nProgram to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST), a 3 degree of freedom entry analysis system.\nHyperPASS has been used by GAC for NASA aeroassist and launch approval studies and for US\nArmy missile trajectory studies.\nThe purpose of the Phase I effort was to determine a set of feasible working parameters for the\ndecelerator and entry trajectory that could deliver the lander-hopper to the surface. To do this we\ncomputed entry convective stagnation point heating rates, g-loads, dynamic pressures, and altitude\nand flight path angle time histories. HyperPASS computes convective heating rates based on the\nSutton-Graves approximation:\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x9e \xf0\x9d\x91\x90\xf0\x9d\x91\x9c\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3 = \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3 3 \xe2\x88\x9a\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x8c\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x85\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b\n\n(1)\n\nWhere v is the velocity, \xcf\x81 is the atmospheric density, Rn is the vehicle nose radius, and C is a\nconvective heating coefficient that depends on the atmospheric composition. HyperPASS does not\ncompute radiative heating but this analyzed separated using CFD and presented in Section 7.3.\nFour envelope diameters were considered: 70-m, 80-m, 90-m, and 100-m. We computed\ntrajectories for entry flight path angles (FPA) ranging from -59 to -65 degrees. Total entry masses\nranged from 450 to 750 kg and were based on a 200 kg lander payload plus the appropriatelyscaled decelerator envelope CBE mass based on envelope component mass estimates. The Pluto\narrival speed was fixed at 14 km/s based on the reference mission design.\nWe began by examining the altitude time history as a function of flight path angle and envelope\ndiameter. This analysis was used to determine the conditions in which atmospheric skip-out is\nlikely. Figure 7 shows that skip-out occurs for all envelope sizes when the entry FPA is -59 degrees\nor greater. Skip-out also occurs for the 70-m envelope at an entry FPA of -60 degrees. In all cases,\nan entry FPA of -61 degrees or less appears to prevent skip-out. However, analysis of FPA time\nhistories is necessary to ensure the FPA remains negative during the entire trajectory. A change in\nsign of the FPA from negative to positive could also indicate susceptibility to skip-out if there are\nsmall changes in atmospheric density. Figure 8 shows the FPA time histories for the four envelope\ndiameters. We see that an initial FPA of -60 is insufficient because the FPA temporarily becomes\npositive later in the trajectory. In a real mission scenario, it will be necessary to obtain an updated\natmosphere profile from Earth-based stellar occultation analysis and/or a precursor probe in order\nto determine the entry FPA. A precursor probe, if needed, would be a small, battery-powered,\ninstrumented sphere that would be released from the entrycraft a few weeks prior to arrival and\n\n14\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nplaced on a Pluto intercept trajectory. Upon entry, it would transmit data to the Entrycraft for relay\nto Earth. For the 2040 arrival, we expect the atmosphere to have remained nearly the same or\nincreased in density based on recent simulations [1]. Next we calculated convective stagnation\npoint heating rates, dynamic pressure, and g-load time histories. The results are given in Figure 9,\nFigure 10, and Figure 11, respectively. In this design space, peak convective heating rates range\nfrom 1.7-3.2 W/cm2, peak dynamic pressures range from 15-42 Pa, and peak g-load ranges from\n16-36 g depending on the entry FPA and envelope size. The g-loading is not very sensitive to\nenvelope diameter tends to increase very slightly with increasing size. However, g-loading is very\nsensitive to entry FPA and increases with steeper angles. Both heating rates and dynamic pressures\ndecrease with increasing envelope diameter and shallower FPAs.\n\nFigure 7.

Effect of atmospheric variation on the entry FPA time history. Entry FPA=-62\xc2\xb0.\nThe effect of increasing the nominal New Horizons atmosphere density by 50% is small and tends to keep the flight\npath angle slightly steeper during entry. Decreasing the nominal density by 50% causes a more significant\nshallowing of the flight path but skipout does not occur.\n\nThe entry system favors shallower entry FPAs from a g-load and heating perspective, but this\nincreases the risk of skip-out. Based on these data and the convective heating limits of the envelope\nmaterial, we believe the acceptable range of entry FPAs are -61\xc2\xb0 to -64\xc2\xb0 with the current New\nHorizons atmosphere. The nominal entry FPA should be -62\xc2\xb0 or -63\xc2\xb0 depending on the envelope\nsize. B-plane analysis using the acceptable range of entry FPAs indicates the maximum B-plane\ntarget error is about 175 km. This is commensurate with the 184 km B-plane target error that was\nseen for New Horizons 14 Days prior to arrival. Since New Horizons showed that trajectory control\nand targeting at Pluto can be done successfully, it is likely that these errors can be reduced even\nfurther for our proposed mission in 2029.\nNext, we analyzed the effect of atmospheric variability on the entry trajectories. We started with\nthe New Horizons density profile and generated new profiles that were increased and decreased by\na factor of 50% over all altitudes. We feel this is a very generous bound for the density variation\nbased on past measurements and predictions of Pluto atmospheric variation [6]. The effect of\natmospheric variability on the FPA time history for an entry FPA of -62\xc2\xb0 is given in Figure 12.\nWe observe the decrease in density by 50% causes a noticeable decrease in the FPA later in the\ntrajectory but it remains negative at all times, i.e. does not approach skipout. G-loading is reduced\nby 10% and heating rates decrease by 4%. An increase in density appears to have a less noticeable\neffect. In this case g-loading increases by 6% and heating rates increase by 2.6%. While it does\nnot appear that atmospheric density variation is a major driver of the system design, the atmosphere\nshould be sampled remotely, at least by Earth-based star occultations, a few weeks before entry\nsuch that the entry FPA can be updated if necessary.\nNext we down-selected the envelope diameter. A clear comparison of the effect of diameter on\nconvective heating and dynamic pressure is shown in Figure 13. The heating rates and dynamic\npressures are relatively low throughout the range of diameters. Heating is consistently below the\nhigh-temperature, operating limits of the envelope materials under consideration. Dynamic\npressures range from 25-32 Pa and are easily managed by inflating the envelope with a greater\ninternal pressure. These results seem to suggest that there is no significant system-design benefit\n\n20\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nof having an envelope larger than 70 meters in diameter. Also, larger envelopes will increase\nlaunch mass and inflation system weight. There is a small benefit to going to 80 meters with regard\nto skipout since the ballistic coefficient is smaller and there is more flexibility. We will consider\nboth 70-m and 80-m cases in our later analysis efforts.\n\nFigure 13. Effect of envelope diameter on stagnation point heating and dynamic pressure. FPA=-62\xc2\xb0.\nTop: Stagnation point heating time histories for envelope diameters of 70-100 m, bottom, dynamic pressure time\nhistories.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the effect of entry mass on heating rates for fixed envelope sizes. In the\nprevious analyses, we scaled the entry mass based on the envelope size, and the mass for a given\nenvelope size was fixed. Here, we look at varying that mass. Figure 14 shows the effect of entry\nmass on the convective stagnation point heating for the 80-m envelope and an entry FPA of -62\xc2\xb0.\nVarying the mass from 400 to 700 kg results in a change in heating from 2.36 to 3 W/cm2. Results\nfor the 70-m envelope and an entry FPA of -63\xc2\xb0 are shown in Figure 15. Varying the mass by the\nsame amount results in a change in heating from 2.9 to 3.8 W/cm2. This indicates that a large\nchange in entry mass has a relatively small effect on heating and provides greater flexibility in the\ndesign.\n\nFigure 14. Effect of total entry mass on the convective stagnation point heating for the 80-m diameter\nenvelope, entry FPA=-62\xc2\xb0.\nStagnation point heating rates range from about 2.36 to 3 W/cm2 for entry masses of 400 to 700 kg, respectively.\n\n21\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nFigure 15. Effect of total entry mass on the convective stagnation point heating for the 70-m diameter\nenvelope, entry FPA=-63\xc2\xb0.\nStagnation point heating rates range from about 2.9 to 3.8 W/cm2 for entry masses of 400 to 700 kg, respectively.\n\n6.2 Approach and Landing Analysis.\nAfter establishing feasibility of the decelerator for use at Pluto, we carried at an approach and\nlanding analysis to determine if placing a lander on the dayside of Pluto was possible given the\nentry flight path angle constraints. We generated the reference approach and landing geometry in\nthe V-infinity-sun plane using the position of Pluto in orbit at the arrival time. This is shown in\nFigure 16. Here we used the 80-m diameter envelope (the 70-m diameter envelope will have a\nnarrower entry corridor). The Earth-Sun terminator divides the dayside and night side, and we\ndesire to place a lander on the dayside for continuous communications with Earth. The green\nshaded region indicates the potential landing area and the green lines indicate the landing area on\nthe dayside. The flight path angle range allows us a ~375 km landing region on the dayside. The\neffect of atmospheric uncertainty on the landing footprint is an aspect that requires further study.\nWhile we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown that relatively large (\xc2\xb150%) changes in atmospheric density are not\nproblematic for decelerator feasibility at Pluto, an updated density profile at time of arrival is\ndesirable to targeting the optimal entry flight path angle. Stellar occultations or a precursor probe\nwould be able to provide this data. A Monte Carlo analysis is needed to evaluate quantitatively the\neffects of these and other uncertainties on the landing footprint.\nRegarding stellar occultations, the first confirmed detection of Pluto\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere was by Ellliot\nin 1993 [5] [6] [7]. We expect that a concerted international effort similar to that occurred two\nweeks prior to New Horizons flyby would make observations of the atmosphere of Pluto prior to\nan aerocapture mission to confirm atmospheric density prior to arrival. The New Horizons effort\nfound that Pluto\xca\xbcs atmosphere was still expanding, with a significant pressure increase of about\n5% since 2013 and a factor of almost three since 1988. They found that this trend ruled out an\natmospheric collapse associated with Pluto\xca\xbcs recession from the Sun, at least for the New\nHorizon\xe2\x80\x99s mission [8]. Earth-based stellar occultations would be a necessary aspect of this mission\nto provide final targeting information. An orthographic view on approach at the reference mission\narrival time is shown in Figure 17. We can access several surface features of interest in the\n\n22\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\nNorthern hemisphere depending on the timing of arrival. An example landing site and its path in\nthe Pluto day is also indicated.\n\nFigure 16. Pluto reference approach and landing region. Envelope diameter is 80-m in this analysis.\nThis figure shows the reference approach and landing geometry in the V-infinity-sun plane. The Earth-sun\nterminator divides the day side and night side. The angle between the Sun and V-infinity vector is about 6\xc2\xb0. The\nnominal FPA is -62\xc2\xb0 and an entry corridor width is 5 degrees. The day-side landing zone is about 375-km long in\nthis entry scenario. The shallower flight path angles tend towards landing on the night side.\n\nFigure 17. View on approach to Pluto.\nThis view on approach for the reference trajectory shows several possible landing sites that are accessible including\nthe Viking Terra, Tombaugh Regio, and Lowell Regio. The subsolar point is indicated at 53.5 deg latitude and the\nNorth Pole and Equator are also shown. The acceptable landing zone is indicated by a region of linear distance\nalong the edge of the Pluto surface. As Pluto rotates, different landing sites become accessible. An example landing\nsite is shown at about 35 degrees latitude.\n\n23\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n6.2.1.\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nTerminal Velocity Analysis\n\nNext we computed the terminal velocity of the decelerator before lander separation and used that\nto determine the propellant mass required for landing. These parameters are heavily dependent on\nthe drag coefficient. In this Reynolds number regime, the drag coefficients range from 0.1 to 0.5\ndepending on the surface roughness. Any roughness of the decelerator skin or seams is very small\nwith respect to the diameter so we assume the surface to be smooth. This results in a drag\ncoefficient of 0.5. The terminal velocity is about 80 m/s and the required propellant mass\n(assuming monopropellant with Isp=240s) is 7 kg. We will include substantial margin to assure\nenough propellant is available for a safe landing\n6.3 Aerocapture Analysis.\nWhile the primary focus of our study is on a decelerator for EDL and delivery of a lander to the\nsurface, significant science interest in a Pluto orbiter led us to study briefly the feasibility of\naerocapture at Pluto. We used\nHyperPASS to generate\naerocapture trajectories using\nthe\nexisting\nspherical\ndecelerator design. With an\ninitial flight path angle of 59.8\xc2\xb0 and the same entry\nspeed of 14 km/s, we can\nenter\ninto\nan\ninitial\naerocapture orbit of 200 x\n3000 km and then perform a\nburn to raise periapsis to 1600\nkm. This is illustrated in\nFigure 18. Heating rates and\ndynamic\npressures\nare\nslightly less than for EDL Figure 18. Aerocapture mission option using Entrycraft. Entry FPA = 59.8\xc2\xb0.\nbecause the entry angle is\nshallower. The velocity time The Entrycraft enters at a precise flight path angle and passes through the\nhistory and atmospheric Pluto atmosphere after which the envelope is jettisoned. An initial\naerocapture orbit of 200 x 3000 km is shown. We indicate a burn to raise\neffects on flight path angle are periapsis resulting in a final orbit of 1600 x 3000 km.\nshown in Figure 19. We see that aerocapture is possible even when the atmosphere is 50% greater\nor less dense than recent New Horizons measurements. The required entry flight path angles for\nthe nominal atmosphere, \xc2\xb10%, +50%, and -50% density are -59.23\xc2\xb0, -59.32\xc2\xb0, and -60.8\xc2\xb0,\nrespectively. Since the decelerator does not have lift, the atmospheric characteristics must be\nknown accurately at time of arrival. For an orbiter, a precursor probe or extensive Earth-based (and\npossibly space-based) stellar occultations could be used to obtain an atmospheric update, and thrust\nmaneuvers may be used to account for other off-nominal effects.\nIn addition, a ConOps could include post close approach, adaptive EAD envelope release based\non integrated acceleration measurements to obtain a precise final orbit. Other options could include\nthe use of small propulsive delta-Vs to shape the final orbit during the atmospheric pass.\nThis is a subject for further study.\n\n24\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nFigure 19. Aerocapture velocity profile (top) and effect of atmosphere variability on flight path angle\n(bottom).\nThe aerocapture velocity time history shows the velocity decreasing from 14 km/s to about 700 m/s after the pass\nthrough the atmosphere. The effect of atmospheric variability is to shift slightly the required entry flight path angle\nneeded to attain orbit capture.\n\n25\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n7 Decelerator Design and Analysis\nIn this task, we developed models of the decelerator envelope in order to establish key design\nrequirements. Structural analysis was performed to determine the required envelope strength.\nAeroelastic analysis was used to assess flutter instabilities. Aerothermodynamics CFD analysis\nwas used to evaluate radiative heating effects and verify the HyperPASS predictions of convective\nheating. A thermal model was also developed to determine more accuracy the surface and inflation\ngas temperatures. Finally, this analysis was used to develop a decelerator envelope materials\ndesign and fabrication approach, and an envelope patterning design.\n7.1 Structural Modeling\nThe two primary objectives of this modeling were to 1) calculate the stress field in the envelope\nmaterial to establish material strength requirements and 2) determine if any additional highpressure inflatable structures would necessary to prevent excessive inward deformation at the load\nline attachment points at the envelope equator. We carried out a structural stress and deformation\nanalysis using simple calculations and FEA simulations.\n7.1.1.\n\nStructural Model Assumptions\n\nThe assumptions used in this analysis are as follows:\n\xef\x83\xb0 Uniform envelope material, seams neglected (a seam design and analysis is provided in the\nAppendix\n\xef\x83\xb0 Uniform line loads at the envelope equator (neglects load line attachment points)\n\xef\x83\xb0 Thermal effects on material properties neglected\n\xef\x83\xb0 Payload-envelope attachment point neglected\n\xef\x83\xb0 80-m diameter envelope is considered (this is conservative due since stress ~ radius)\n\xef\x83\xb0 Envelope film thickness of 70 \xef\x81\xadm (2.75 mil)\n7.1.2.\n\nStructural Model\n\nThe maximum stress in the envelope can be estimated using the following equation:\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x9d\xf0\x9d\x91\x9f\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb9\xf0\x9d\x91\xa7\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x8e=\n+\n2\xe2\x84\x8e \xe2\x84\x8e\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the first term is the stress due to internal pressure in a spherical shell and the second term is\nthe stress due to the payload weight distribution into the equator. The equivalent tangential line\nforce per length, Fz, is computed by dividing the payload force during deceleration by the\ncircumference of the envelope. Table 2 provides the magnitudes of the accelerations, forces and\ninternal pressures assumed for this analysis.\nTable 2.

This model is\nan approximation of the structure and does not include the payload and load lines, though it does\ninclude their representative forces. The model\nconsists of a spherical envelope without a torus.\nThe forces due to the load lines are represented\nby a radial line force (Fr) and tangential line\nforce (Fz) per length applied at the equator as\nshown. An acceleration body force (a) is applied\nto the entire model. This corresponds to gloading experienced during entry. Internal\npressure from the gas (Pint) is applied and\nexternal static pressure is assumed to be zero. A\ndrag force (D) corresponding to the peak\ndynamic pressure is applied on the windward\nsurface of the envelope. A fixed-point boundary\ncondition, constraining displacements in all\nthree directions, is enforced at the stagnation\npoint. The payload mass is distributed into the\nenvelope as an increase in density which is\nsufficient for a static analysis.\nThe envelope is meshed with triangular shell\nelements. The mesh density is increased at the\nequator where the payload forced are\ndistributed. The higher mesh density in this\nFigure 20. Loads and displacements for the FEA\nmodel.\nregion allows the expected inward deformation\nand complex stress field to be resolved more A cross-section of the spherical envelope is shown with\nloads applied. There is a fixed constraint at the\naccurately.\n7.1.3.\n\nStructural Model Results\n\nstagnation point, drag, acceleration, internal pressure,\nand radial and tangential line forces applied at the\nequator.\n\nMaximum Stress. Using the parameters in\nTable 2, we performed stress calculations and found the maximum stress at peak heating and peak\ng-load to be 362 and 353 MPa, respectively. The stress is relatively constant between these two\nconditions for the following reasons. During peak heating the internal pressure is at a maximum\nand the g-loading is about 60% of maximum, but g-loading only accounts for 10-15% of the total\nenvelope stress. During peak g-loading the internal pressure is reduced by 4% and the g-load is at\na maximum. The two effects nearly cancel out and the envelope mechanical loading remains fairly\nconstant during the two loading regimes.\nStress and Deformation Fields. In order to determine the stress field and deformations within the\nenvelope, we initially performed a linear static analysis and determined that it was insufficient to\nresolve accurately the deformed shape of the envelope. We then switched to a nonlinear static\nanalysis that accounts for large deformation effects. While this approach was able to resolve the\n\xc2\xa7 Drag coefficient is a function of Mach number and is equal to 0.9 during peak heating and peak dynamic pressure\n\n27\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nstatic shape of the envelope, it would not converge due to an artifact of the FEA analysis when the\nenvelope thicknesses was less than about 70 \xce\xbcm (2.75 mil). As a result we had to artificially\nincrease the envelope thickness by about a factor of 8.33 (from 8.4 \xce\xbcm [0.33 mil] to 70 \xce\xbcm [2.75\nmil]) while reducing the envelope material density accordingly. As a result of this artifice, the\ncomputed stresses needed to be scaled by the thickness change to reflect the actual stress in the\nthinner material. We will need to refine this analysis in a later effort to solve the thinner material\nconfiguration, but believe the current approach to be sufficient in this initial feasibility study.\nAfter making this change to envelope thickness, we performed this nonlinear static analysis using\nthe parameters in Table 2. We verified that all the forces balanced and the model remained\nconstrained at the stagnation point during application of the loads. Application of the internal\npressure (calculated in the thermal analysis) caused the envelope volume to increase slightly,\nwhich in turn decreased the pressure slightly. The final pressure used in the analysis was\ndetermined by iteration. Volume changes due to material stretching were on the order of 4% and\nthe final pressures were found to be a few Pascals lower than the initial pressures. For example,\nthe initial and final pressures for the peak heating case were 148 and 142 Pa, respectively.\nThe FEA solutions for the peak heating and peak g-loading cases are provided in Figure 21. The\ntrue scale radial deformations indicate that the forces applied at the equator do not result in very\nlarge inward deformations. The maximum equatorial (inward) deformation for the 70 \xce\xbcm (2.75\nmil), 80 meter envelope is about 10 cm for peak heating and about 18 cm for the peak g-load cases.\nThis deformation does not change significantly with thickness, so we expect it to be similar in\nmagnitude for the 8.4 \xce\xbcm [0.33 mil] envelope. These relatively small deformations suggest that\nadditional inflatable structural elements, like an internal toroid, as originally proposed, are not\nneeded, but additional structural modeling should be performed.\nIn Figure 21 we present the deformation and stress results on 1X and 50X scaled meshes. The\n50X scale exaggerates the overall combined effect of the loads.\nNext we calculated the equivalent (Von Mises) stress. Von Mises stress is typically compared to\nthe yield strength of the material for safety factor calculations. The maximum equivalent stress of\nthe 70 \xce\xbcm (2.75 mil) envelope during peak heating and peak g-loading is 41.1 and 39.3 MPa,\nrespectively. Assuming linearity in thickness the equivalent stresses of the 8.4 \xce\xbcm (0.33 mil)\nenvelope are 349 and 334 MPa, respectively.\nPrincipal stresses were also calculated. The middle principal stress runs longitudinally and the\nmaximum principal stress runs circumferentially along the envelope. The maximum principal\nstress of the 70 \xce\xbcm (2.75 mil) envelope during peak heating and peak g-loading is 42.9 and 42.1\nMPa, respectively. Assuming linearity in thickness the equivalent stresses of the 8.4 \xce\xbcm (0.33 mil)\nenvelope are 364.6 and 357 MPa, respectively. These results are comparable to the earlier hand\ncalculations.\n7.1.4.\n\nStructural Analysis Conclusions\n\nIn summary, the structural analysis indicates the following:\n1. The peak heating condition results in slightly larger envelope stress than peak g-loading\ndue to the greater internal pressure,\n2. An inflatable structural element at the envelope equator is not needed since radial\ndeformation due to distributed payload forces is less than 20 cm,\n\n28\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n3. The Von Mises criterion indicates the envelope yield strength must be greater than 350\nMPa. We suggest a 3X factor of safety for the envelope, for a yield stress of > 750 MPa.\n4. Further work is needed in the FEA model development to allow simulation of the physical\nenvelope thickness and incorporate features such as the payload load line load distribution\npatches.\n\nScaled inward deformation (50 X)\n\nTrue scale radial deformation (1X)\n\nPeak heating\n\nPeak g-load\n\n1X scale\n\n50X\nscale\n\n29\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\nEquivalent stress (2.75 mil)\n\nPeak heating\n\nPeak g-load\n\n50X\nscale\n\nFigure 21.

The\ntrue scale inward deformation, 50X scaled inward deformation, and equivalent stress fields are shown on the\nANSYS mesh. Deformations are exaggerated and indicate slight longitudinal compression and inward deformation\nat the equator.\n\n7.2 Aeroelastic Modeling\nAeroelasticity is the study of the interaction between a flowing fluid and a flexible structure. In\ncertain conditions, a feedback mechanism between the structural natural modes and the flow can\ncause violent instabilities. The two primary aeroelastic instabilities include flutter and divergence\n(buckling). The primary objective of the aeroelastic modeling analysis is to (1) characterize flutter\nof the thin envelope material that could occur during entry and descent and (2) determine if it could\npossibly cause damage to the envelope.\nFlutter of thin panels and shell structures, such as thin envelopes, can usually be mitigated by\nincreasing the effective structural stiffness. This can be accomplished in two ways: increasing the\nstiffness (and thus mass) of the envelope material, or increasing the static pressure across the\nenvelope. The pressure differential will induce tensile stresses in the plane of the material which\nwill result in increased stability. The pressure differential will be the primary parameter of interest\nhere since we will not be examining changes to the material stiffness.\nThis aeroelastic analysis uses a greatly-simplified first-order analytical model. The large, thin\nstructure is challenging to simulate accurately. A representative aeroelastic simulation would\nrequire hypersonic CFD coupled with a structural model such as an FEA. This is complex and time\nintensive. Our goal here is to get a general sense of the kinds of behavior we could expect and\nwhere in the entry trajectory this behavior could occur.\nPluto entry with a very large envelope is a unique situation with respect to aeroelasticity due to the\nextremely low density of atmospheric gas. We estimate the mean free path of Nitrogen molecules\nto be about 40 cm at peak heating. With most structures this would be in the free molecular flow\nregime, but the large envelope size relative the mean free path makes this situation effectively\ncontinuum. The low dynamic pressures (20-30 Pa), low atmospheric densities, and high Mach\nnumbers suggest that aeroelastic flutter is not as much of a concern as it would be with more\nconvention aerospace structures and atmospheres. In any case, we provide a simple analysis here.\n\n30\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n7.2.1.\n\nAeroelastic Model Assumptions\n\nThe assumptions in this analysis are as follows:\n\xef\x83\xb0 Quasi-steady supersonic aerodynamics (Piston Theory)\n\xef\x83\xb0 Thin shallow shell structural model for an \xe2\x80\x9caeroelastic surface\xe2\x80\x9d with simple support\nboundary conditions\n\xef\x83\xb0 Thermal effects on material stiffness neglected\n\xef\x83\xb0 Flow separation and flow recirculation neglected\n7.2.2.\n\nAeroelastic Model\n\nThe aeroelastic model follows from the work of Dowell [9] and Goldman [10] [11]. The equations\nof motion are derived from first principles using a Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach. The\ndisplacements of the thin structure are written as expansions in the assumed natural mode\nfunctions. The process is rather involved and will not be reproduced here. The result is an\neigenvalue problem for aeroelastic stability that is written as:\n[\xf0\x9d\x91\x9d2 \xf0\x9d\x91\xb4 + \xf0\x9d\x91\x9d\xf0\x9d\x91\xaa + \xf0\x9d\x91\xb2]\xf0\x9d\x91\x9e = 0\n\xcc\x82\n\n(3)\n\nWhere M, C, and K are the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, respectively, p is the frequency\neigenvalue and is a vector of modal coordinates. When the real part of the eigenvalues change\nsign, we will find coalescence of two structural natural frequencies and a bifurcation instability.\nThe geometry of the aeroelastic model and the entry flow characteristics are illustrated in Figure\n22. The aeroelastic surface which is to be analyzed here is in the supersonic, attached flow regime\nonly, since piston theory for aerodynamic pressure is not valid in subsonic and transonic flows.\n\nFigure 22. Aeroelastic model geometry.\nThe model geometry shows a circular cross section of the sphere with bow shock in front of the stagnation point\nand oblique shocks at the flow separation region near the rear of the decelerator. The local Mach number is\n\n31\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nsubsonic directly behind the bow shock and transitions back to supersonic moving tangentially along the surface.\nThe aeroelastic surface is indicated in this supersonic region.\n\n7.2.3.\n\nAeroelastic Test Cases\n\nTo determine where in the trajectory to perform the aeroelastic calculation, we plotted the dynamic\npressure, \xf0\x9d\x91\x9e\xe2\x88\x9e , divided by the Mach number, \xf0\x9d\x91\x80. This quantity is proportional to the magnitude of\nthe aerodynamic pressure term in the aeroelastic equations of motion and it indicates where flutter\nis more likely to occur. A plot of \xf0\x9d\x91\x9e\xe2\x88\x9e /\xf0\x9d\x91\x80\xe2\x88\x9e is given in Figure 23. The peak in the curve indicates\nwhere flutter probability is increased. Here the peak occurs around Mach 25 at an altitude of about\n150 km well after peak heating and peak dynamic pressure. While this plot does not tell us if flutter\noccurs, it suggests the initial flow conditions to assume in the aeroelastic model.\n\nFigure 23. Plot of free stream dynamic pressure divided by Mach number.\nA curve of dynamic pressure divided by Mach number for Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 90. The peak dynamic\npressure is indicated at Mach 55 and the peak in the curve is indicated at Mach 25 where the flutter probability is\nincreased.\n\n7.2.4.\n\nAeroelastic Results\n\nThe key flutter results are summarized in Figure 24 for the peak \xf0\x9d\x91\x9e\xe2\x88\x9e /\xf0\x9d\x91\x80\xe2\x88\x9e point in the trajectory.\nOn the left, the flutter dynamic pressure is shown for various local Mach numbers in relation to\nthe flow dynamic pressure. The flutter dynamic pressure is always greater than the flow dynamic\npressure within the range of expected inflation pressures, indicating that the envelope will not\n\n32\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nflutter. The local Mach number is unknown but is expected to be low supersonic, and this has only\na minimal effect.\n\nFigure 24. Flutter dynamic pressure as a function of envelope inflation pressure for various supersonic local\nflow Mach numbers (left), and frequency-damping plot showing the coalescence of natural modes.\nThe flutter dynamic pressure increases from about 45 to 140 Pa in the range of inflation pressures from 50 to 150\nPa. The peak flow dynamic pressure is indicated at 30 Pa. The frequency-damping plot shows the coalescence of\nnatural modes and positive system damping at the flutter point.\n\nThe right plot in Figure 24 shows how the natural frequencies and system damping change as a\nfunction of dynamic pressure. We see that pairs of modes merge together in a phenomenon known\nas modal coalescence. Flutter occurs at the dynamic pressure where the system damping, \xf0\x9d\x9c\x8e,\nbecomes positive.\n7.2.1.\n\nAeroelasticity Conclusions\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a simple aeroelastic model for the Pluto decelerator envelope with several\nsimplifying assumptions. The model indicates that the envelope is not likely to flutter during entry\nat Pluto since the flutter dynamic pressures are greater than the flow dynamic pressures in the\nrange of expected envelope inflation pressures. Additional work is needed to better characterize\nthe flowfield and more accurately represent the envelope structure. However, based on the\nextremely low atmospheric densities encountered during entry, catastrophic flutter that is typically\nseen with traditional aircraft structures is unlikely to occur here.\n7.3 Aerothermodynamics Analysis\nIn an effort to better characterize the aerodynamic heating environment during Pluto entry, we\nperformed an aerothermodynamics CFD analysis. The primary objective of the\naerothermodynamics analysis was to (1) determine the envelope heat fluxes and temperatures\nduring entry and (2) validate the use of conventional envelope materials and fabrication\ntechniques.\nInitially we were concerned about radiative heating since first order calculations using the TauberSutton model [12] predicted relatively high fluxes that would necessitate more significant envelope\nmaterials development. A higher level of fidelity was needed to pin down radiative heating and\nalso verify HyperPASS\xe2\x80\x99s Sutton-Graves predictions of convective heating.\n\n33\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nWe began this analysis using the NASA Langley Aerothermodynamic Upwind Relaxation\nAlgorithm (LAURA) [13]. LAURA solves the flowfield in thermochemical nonequilibrium where\nmolecular species dissociate and ionize as a result of shock layer heating. The results presented\nhere are preliminary and further CFD convergence and mesh refinement studies are needed to\nassure accurate prediction.\n7.3.1.\n\nLAURA Assumptions\n\nThe assumptions in this analysis are as follows:\n\xef\x83\xb0 100% N2 atmosphere with species N2, N, N+, N2+, and e\xef\x83\xb0 Envelope surface is super-catalytic; the species mass fractions are set to free-stream\nconditions (this is the default in LAURA)\n\xef\x83\xb0 Envelope surface is in radiative equilibrium\n\xef\x83\xb0 The analysis is axisymmetric with a hemispherical grid\n7.3.2.\n\nSimulation Setup and Solution Process\n\nWe used the LAURA Self-Start utility to build the grid and generate the input files. The volume\nmesh and surface grids are shown in Figure 25. The hemispherical, axisymmetric grid runs from\nthe stagnation point to the flow tangency point along the streamwise centerline. Figure 26 shows\nthe LAURA solution process that was used to compute convective and radiative heating. We first\ncompute the convective solution, converge the boundary layer through a series of restarts, and\nrestart again with radiation enabled until convergence is attained.\n\nFigure 25. LAURA volume mesh (left) and surface grid (right).\nThe LAURA volume mesh is the discretized fluid domain. The domain is axisymmetric and hemispherical and\nspans from the stagnation point to the tangency point. The mesh is composed of a structured array of 3-D cells.\nThe surface grid also runs from the stagnation point to the tangency point but uses 2-D surface elements.\n\n34\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\nFigure 26. LAURA solution process.\nThe LAURA solution process as described in this figure is to (1) compute the initial convective heating solution,\n(2) converge the boundary layer, (3) enable radiation and restart, and (4) converge the radiative solution.\n\n7.3.3.\n\nCFD Test Cases\n\nDue to schedule constraints, we were only able to analyze the 70-m diameter case. This is the worst\ncase for convective heating. We took the trajectory data from HyperPASS and chose several points\nin the region of the HyperPASS heat pulse to compare with LAURA results. The parameters for\nthese points are shown in Table 3. The Pluto altitude at which the heat pulse occurs is around ~250\nkm. Peak convective heating as predicted by HyperPASS occurs at 131.7 s in the entry starting at\n1600 km and 14 km/s. The Knudsen numbers of about 0.005 (mean free path, 0.4 m, divided by\ncharacteristic length, 80 m) indicate that the decelerator is in continuum flow regime during peak\nheating, whereas Knudsen numbers >0.01 indicates continuum does not hold.\nTable 3.

The shock causes a rapid\nincrease in static pressure near the stagnation point by a factor of 20 compared with the free stream. The density\nalso increases by the same factor but the highest densities are seen just above the solid wall boundary.\n\nThe species mass fractions were also generated from the radiation solver and are illustrated in\nFigure 28. The free stream is 100% molecular Nitrogen. Behind the shock, most of the gas is\ndissociated into atomic Nitrogen, but there are also small fractions of monatomic and diatomic\nnitrogen ions and electrons. Each of these species has a contribution to the radiative heat flux seen\nby the envelope surface.\n\nFigure 28. Species mass fractions at t=131.7 sec.\nSpecies mass fraction contours are plotted on the CFD volume mesh. The free stream is 100% N 2. Behind the\nshock, we see that the N2 mass fraction decreases to about 10% and N increases to about 90%, with small fractions\nof N+, N2+, and e-.\n\nIn summary, radiative heating has a very minor contribution to the total heat flux, on the order of\n0.1 Watt/cm2. We believe this to be because the mean free path of the molecules is extremely large,\nabout 40 cm, which is nearly 1 billion times the molecular diameter. Note that the large size of the\ndecelerator keeps the Knudsen number less than 0.01 during peak heating, which means the flow\nis a continuum.\n36\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\nThe total heat flux is illustrated in Figure 29. LAURA confirms the time of the peak heating\nconditions predicted by HyperPASS (Sutton-Graves heating model), namely 131.7 s. All other\ntimes in Table 3 result in lower heating rates. The results show that the heating rates decrease by\nabout a factor of 7 from the stagnation point to the flow tangency point.\nLAURA\xe2\x80\x99s peak heat flux is about 3.5 W/cm2, which is slightly higher than the HyperPASS result\nfor the 70-m envelope (a direct comparison with HyperPASS is given in Figure 30). This results\nin peak temperatures of about 550\xc2\xb0C (neglecting internal convection). This temperature is lower\nthan what would be seen by a solid surface because the thin envelope can radiate heat from both\nsides since the film is so thin. The temperature profile in K (neglecting internal convection) is\nshown in Figure 31.\n\nFigure 29. Heat flux surface profiles, t=131.7 s.\nThe surface heat flux profile as plotted on the CFD surface grid indicates peak heating at the stagnation point of\n3.5 W/cm2 that gradually decreases to 0.4 W/cm 2 at the flow tangency point of the sphere.\n\nFigure 30. Comparison between the LAURA and HyperPASS heating rates for the 70-m envelope.\nThis figure shows that the LAURA predictions are about 0.5 W/cm 2 higher than the HyperPASS result.\n\n37\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nFigure 31. LAURA surface temperature profile, t=131.7 sec.\nThe surface temperature profile as plotted on the CFD surface grid indicates peak temperature at the stagnation\npoint of 826 K (550\xc2\xb0C) that gradually decreases to 435 K (160\xc2\xb0C). Internal convection is neglected so these\ntemperatures are overestimates.\n\n7.3.5.\n\nAerothermodynamics Analysis Conclusions\n\nThe LAURA CFD results support the earlier HyperPASS predictions and further confirm the\nfeasibility of the EAD decelerator design for Pluto entry. Results show that radiative heating is a\nsmall fraction of the total heat flux and convective heating is very low, well within the thermal\ncapabilities of existing thin film materials. However, further work is still needed to verify\nsimulation predictions and assure convergence has been attained for all simulation cases.\n7.1 Envelope Thermal Analysis\nThe objective of the thermal analysis of the decelerator was to determine the transient entry\ntemperatures of key elements including the envelope surface, inflation gas, and base cap structure.\nThe transient inflation gas temperature is particularly important for determining the inflation\npressure that must be large enough to keep the envelope inflated during deceleration and low\nenough to not cause dangerous membrane stresses. Two methods were used to analyze the internal\nconvection of the inflation gas: (1) A first-order analytical model and (2) CFD simulation. Our\npast experience indicated substantial uncertainty in first-order internal convection modeling so that\nis why we decided to use CFD for an additional convection analysis here.\n7.1.1.\n\nThermal Analysis Assumptions\n\nThe following assumptions were used in the first order model for the envelope, gas, and base cap:\n\xef\x83\xb0 For the internal convection model, the envelope is considered a single node with a uniform\naverage temperature across the entire sphere\n\xef\x83\xb0 The quiescent gas temperature (far from surface) is uniform in the envelope internal\nvolume\n\xef\x83\xb0 Initial temperature of all components is 300 K\n\n38\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n\xef\x83\xb0 Internal surface-to-surface radiation is neglected\nThe following assumptions were used in the CFD model for the gas:\n\xef\x83\xb0 At each transient solution, the envelope surface temperature is held constant\n\xef\x83\xb0 Laminar flow viscous model\n\xef\x83\xb0 Radiation view factors for the internal surface calculated using the Surface to Surface (S2S)\nmodel\n7.1.2.\n\nThermal Analysis Theory\n\nThe theory for the first order thermal model derives from past work at Caltech and JPL [14].

Equations (4) and (5) are coupled 1st order ODEs and are easily solved in\nExcel using the Euler method. The CFD internal convection theory is complex and will not be\nreproduced here. For more details on the thermal physics please refer to the ANSYS FLUENT\ndocumentation**. The process by which the CFD solutions were generated is as follows. Several\npoints in 100\xc2\xb0C increments were selected along the envelope temperature time history. A transient\nsolution was generated at each point with a simulation time equal to the corresponding time\ninterval between 100\xc2\xb0C increments in the temperature time history. Each successive simulation\nwas restarted using the solution generated at the previous point. This approach allowed us to\napproximate the convective dynamics of the gas over the peak heat pulse.\n7.1.3.\n\nThermal Analysis Results\n\nThe results of the first order model are given in Figure 32. The peak envelope temperature at the\nstagnation point is about 520\xc2\xb0C, slightly less than the value predicted by LAURA (neglecting\ninternal convection). The gas temperature lags behind the envelope and reaches a maximum value\nof about 415\xc2\xb0C. The base cap temperature lags even further behind the envelope due to its high\nareal density and thermal inertia, reaching a maximum value of about 440\xc2\xb0C. We emphasized that\nthese temperatures are very low for an entry from interplanetary speed, which is due to the large\ndiameter of the decelerator and the nature of the Pluto atmosphere.\n\n** http://www.ansys.com/Products/Fluids/ANSYS-Fluent\n\n39\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nWe compared the CFD average gas temperature with the predictions of the analytical model.\nFigure 33 shows that there is generally good agreement, though greater deviation is seen at higher\ntemperatures. This suggests that the analytical model formulation, particularly the convection\ncoefficient and Nusselt number (Eq. (6)) captures the key physics of the system. We also examined\nthe CFD predictions of internal pressure in relation to the deceleration time history. We see that\nthe pressure increases with increasing deceleration. This is important because the internal pressure\nmust keep pace with the increased compressive loads that are introduced into the envelope during\ndeceleration in order to resist envelope deformation.\nField plots of temperature, density, and velocity are shown in Figure 34. The plots correspond to\nthe CFD solution points in Figure 33 (left). These results illustrate the evolution of the convection\nprocess inside of the envelope during the heat pulse. The results are somewhat different from what\none might find with internal convection of a gas on the surface of the Earth. This is because the\neffective acceleration due to the atmospheric drag is in the upward direction, opposite to the\ndirection of gravitational acceleration on a planet. The acceleration field is a key parameter in the\nbuoyancy model used to calculate the convection coefficients in the CFD model.\n\nFigure 32. Envelope surface, inflation gas, and base cap temperature during entry.\nThe envelope temperature near the stagnation point reaches a peak of about 520\xc2\xb0C, the volume-averaged gas\ntemperature lags in time and reaches a peak of about 410\xc2\xb0C, and the base cap also lags in time and reaches a peak\ntemperature of about 440\xc2\xb0C.\n\n40\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nFigure 33. CFD predictions of volume-averaged inflation gas temperature compared with analytical model\n(left), CFD predictions of internal pressure compared with entry deceleration (right).\nThe volume-averaged gas temperature time history is shown for the 1 st order analytical model along with CFD\npredictions. Peak temperature is about 410\xc2\xb0C. The CFD results generally match up with the analytical model\nthough some deviation is seen at higher temperatures. The CFD pressures are also shown and increase from about\n60 to 150 Pa during the heat pulse. The lag time in the pressure follows the increasing acceleration that occurs a\nfew seconds after the heat pulse.\n\nFigure 34. Field plots of temperature (top row) and density (bottom row). Time increases to the right.\nThe temperature and density fields plotted in a cross-section of the CFD volume mesh are shown as a function of\ntime. The temperatures increase from the stagnation point into the rest of the volume through convection. The\nlocal peak temperature is roughly that of the surface (520\xc2\xb0C) but the space-facing side radiates heat and keeps the\ntop of the envelope cooler. The density field indicates a region of lower density near the stagnation point due to the\nincreased temperature there.\n\n7.1.1.\n\nThermal Analysis Conclusions\n\nDuring entry, the envelope, gas, and base cap temperatures range from about 400\xc2\xb0C to 520\xc2\xb0C.\nThese temperatures are within the acceptable temperature ranges for potential envelope and base\n\n41\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\ncap materials at short exposure times. CFD analysis showed good agreement with the predictions\nof a simple analytical thermal model with two nodes. We also found that the internal pressure\nincreases due to the increased heating and this pressure rise follows approximately the g-load\nprofile during entry.\n7.2 Decelerator Envelope Conceptual Design\nIn this task, we used the prior supporting analysis efforts to generate a conceptual design of the\ndecelerator envelope. We determined that the envelope can be constructed from commercial offthe-shelf components and it can be fabricated using known and feasible softgoods industry\ntechniques. ILC Dover was responsible for performing this subtask with guidance from GAC. Key\naccomplishments include:\n\xef\x83\xb0 Materials selection\n\xef\x83\xb0 Reinforcement feature design\n\xef\x83\xb0 Material mass analysis\n\xef\x83\xb0 Patterning scheme design\n\xef\x83\xb0 Seaming design\n\xef\x83\xb0 Load management system design\n\xef\x83\xb0 Total envelope system mass breakdown\nDue to the potential ITAR limitations on the discussion of the construction of aerodynamic\ndecelerators, we have included the details of this tasks in a proprietary appendix.\n\n42\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n8 Lander-Hopper Conceptual Design\nIn this task we generated a conceptual lander-hopper design and produced a component mass\nbreakdown. The objective of this task was to (1) create CAD drawing at the system level and (2)\ngenerate a system-level mass breakdown. In the next sections we\xe2\x80\x99ll briefly discuss the conceptual\nlander-hopper system design.\nPrior to separation from the decelerator, lander-hopper performs all the functions of a typical cruise\nstage. It contains all the subsystems necessary for power, communications, propulsion and attitude\ncontrol, and thermal control. A thermal radiator, required keeping the lander-hopper cool during\ncruise, and envelope inflation tanks are jettisoned after envelope deployment and inflation. After\nentry, and upon reaching terminal speeds just above the surface, the lander-hopper is separated\nfrom the envelope, translated horizontally via thrusters away from the envelope, deploys its\nlanding legs and configures its subsystems for the final main engine propulsive burn and landing.\nFigure 35 illustrates the lander-hopper on the surface of Pluto with its high-gain antenna pointed\ntoward the Earth. The same main engine and thrusters are used to hop around the surface. Hopping\nis particularly efficient on Pluto since the gravitational acceleration is low, just 0.06 gee, and\natmospheric drag at low speeds is minimal.\nLander-hopper subsystems consist of command and control, structure, power, communications,\npropulsion and attitude control, thermal control and science. These are discussed further in the\nnext sections.\n\nFigure 35. Lander-hopper conceptual design.\nThe lander-hopper design concept shows the locations of key subsystems on the craft including the science payload,\nhigh-gain antenna, propellant tank, RTG, thrusters, forward support structure, robotic arm, shock absorbing\nstruts, deployed legs, and stereo camera and sensor mast.\n\n43\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\n8.1 Command and Control Subsystem\nThe command and control subsystem consists of redundant computers, memories, and interface\nelectronics. This subsystem stores commands, sequences, science and engineering data and\nexecutes commands to the various subsystems.\n8.2 Structure Subsystem\nA key element of the support structure is the Forward Support Structure (FSS) to which many\ncomponents are mounted and through which all entry loads are connected to the envelope. In the\nintegrated Entrycraft architecture, the windward end of the decelerator is the FSS. It also functions\nas the envelope base for the decelerator. The FSS is illustrated in Figure 35. This structure is\nenvisioned as a 2-m diameter, insulated, titanium spherical cap with a radius of curvature equal to\nthat of the envelope. The FSS is insulated to protect lander components on the opposite side of the\nentry interface and made of titanium to take the entry loads. Aluminum may also be an option\ndepending on the strength of aluminum at the stagnation temperatures expected. This structure\nseals the envelope and protects and supports the remaining lander structure and subsystems during\ncruise and entry, and provides attachment for deployable landing legs and a frame. It also interfaces\nwith the base fitting on the envelope and includes a separation mechanism that is activated prior\nto landing. Conceptually, the lander-hopper subsystems are contained within a box-like structure\nbehind the FSS. The structure\n8.3 Power Subsystem\nOne Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), currently in production by the\nDOE powers the craft. This unit provides 100 W EOL power to the science payload and other\nsubsystems. The RTG is connected to a radiator used during cruise and also has the ability to\nradiate out the side of the lander-hopper structure once on the surface. A small secondary battery\nprovides higher instantaneous power when required of lander-hopper subsystems.\n8.4 Communications Subsystem\nCommunications to Earth is enabled by a large (~2-m) high-gain parabolic antenna with an\nelevation/azimuth pointing system. An X-band radio, similar to New Horizons, is also assumed.\nThe pointing of the antenna is achieved by rotation about the azimuth by means of an actuator and\nabout the elevation direction by another actuator. Different elevation angles are obtained by\nrunning the actuator along the geared backside of the antenna. One or more small omni-directional\nand/or low-gain antennas will be used during cruise when the Entrycraft needs to point its antenna\naway from Earth for propulsive maneuvers or when it needs to re-orient its spin axis for entry.\n8.5 Propulsion and Attitude Control Subsystem\nThe propulsion and attitude control subsystem consists of several small attitude thrusters (1 and 5\nN) and a main engine (275 N) all using monopropellant hydrazine (Isp = 240 s) for propellant. A\nset of thrusters on the forward support structure will be used for attitude control during cruise,\nlanding and hopping and the main engine will be used for large trajectory correction, landing and\nhopper maneuvers.\nWe have allocated 30 kg of hydrazine for hopping, separate from the propellant required for cruise\npropulsion and attitude maneuvers and the landing burn. With this propellant mass, the lander-\n\n44\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\nhopper could travel a maximum distance of about 50 km. In Table 4 we show various options for\nhopping maneuvers and the distances traveled. These calculations include the deceleration\npropellant requirements.\nTable 4.

During cruise,\nexcess RTG heat will be radiated out the forward support structure via a separate radiator that will\nbe jettisoned prior to entry. During entry, an insulation layer behind the forward support structure,\ncomponent heat capacity, and the low-pressure environment in the envelope mitigates landerhopper temperature rise due to aeroheating. Figure 32 shows that the forward support structure\n(base cap) surface temperature only reaches about 440\xc2\xb0C during entry. Once at the surface, the\nRTG no longer radiates via the radiator on the forward support structure since it has been jettisoned\nprior to entry. Instead, the RTG waste heat is radiated out the side of the lander-hopper.\n8.7 Science Instrumentation\nNotional science instruments include a surface heat flow and physical properties package, a\nseismometer to measure tidal flexing, 8 stereo cameras, aerothermal and radiometer sensors,\ngeophysical sounding system, gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, robotic arm, and an\natmospheric sensing suite. A mass and power breakdown is given in Table 5.\nTable 5.

This is given in Table 6. Based on the\ndecelerator mass and entry mass limitations discussed earlier, our objective is to keep the landerhopper mass on the surface below 200 kg total.

This\nincludes a layout of the integrated system as well as a list of components needed for cruise to Pluto.\nThe integrated entrycraft (cruise stage) mass breakdown was also generated.\nOur current integrated system concept is illustrated in Figure 36. This shows the packed envelope\naround the stowed lander-hopper payload along with a cover that is used for envelope protection\nfrom micrometeoroids during cruise. The inner envelope sleeve is a lightweight polymer material\nthat allows the envelope to be packed against the lander. We also show the inflation tanks and\ncruise stage RTG radiator.\nThe integrated system mass breakdown is provided in Table 7. The total launch mass maximum\nexpected value (MEV) is about 830 kg. This leaves a 200 kg margin in launch mass based on the\nlaunch vehicle lift capacity to the required C3 of 1030 kg.\n\nFigure 36.

Momentum exchange\nwith nitrogen molecules in the existing, low-density atmosphere of Pluto enables this innovation\nto eliminate the need for significant and expensive onboard RTG power for electric propulsion\ndeceleration. Only 1 MMRTG is required to power the cruise and lander systems. This is in\ncontrast to other proposed system for Pluto deceleration that require kilowatts of power from\nnuclear power sources that have not yet been developed. Below we summarize the conclusions\nfrom each of the major tasks in this Phase I effort.\nIn Task 1, we refined atmospheric models using the most recent New Horizons measurements and\nestablished the system-level requirements for a reference mission design. Research on the Pluto\natmosphere indicated that is does not collapse as once thought, and models show that it is expected\nto increase in density in the current epoch. A reference interplanetary trajectory was generated\nusing a point-to-point conic method. The Earth launch date is January 4, 2029, Jupiter assist, on\nJuly 2, 2030, and Pluto arrival, September 11, 2040. The total flight time is 11 years 8 months.\nIn Task 2, we used first-order planetary aeroassist simulations to study the Pluto entry environment\nconditions including convective heating, g-loads, dynamic pressures, and evaluated the effect of\natmospheric variation on the decelerator performance. Peak convective heating was on the order\nof 3 W/cm2, g-loads of about 27, and dynamic pressures near 30 Pa. Deceleration at Pluto from 14\nkm/s is feasible even with atmospheric variation of \xc2\xb150% in density. Entry masses of 400-700 kg\nare feasible for envelopes 70 \xe2\x80\x93 80 meters in diameter. Next, we analyzed approach and landing\nconditions to determine the possible Pluto landing site locations based on the arrival geometry,\nand we also performed an analysis of aerocapture to evaluative feasibility of using the EAD\ndecelerator concept for orbit insertion. Several landing sites in the northern hemisphere can be\naccessed. Aerocapture is also possible with the correct entry flight path angle and thrust\nmaneuvers. Similar to observations done in support of the New Horizons mission, Earth-based\nstellar occultations may be needed to provide atmospheric characterization prior to final entry\ntargeting.\nIn Task 3, we first performed analysis in support of developing the conceptual deceleration design.\nThis includes static structural, dynamic aeroelastic, CFD aerothermodynamics, and thermal\nanalysis. We found that the envelope does not deform significantly due to inward payload forces\napplied at the equator. Low order aeroelastic analysis suggested that flutter is unlikely as long as\nthe envelope inflation pressure is greater than the dynamic pressure. Aerothermodynamics\nsimulations using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s LAURA CFD indicated heating rates that were commensurate with\nthose predicted by first order methods, about 3.5 W/cm2. LAURA surface temperatures peaked at\n550\xc2\xb0C (without internal convection). Thermal analysis including convection of the inflation gas\nindicated peak envelope temperatures of 520\xc2\xb0C. Using these results, ILC Dover generated the\ndecelerator envelope design including material, reinforcement, seaming, patterning, and load\nmanagement concept.\nIn Task 4, we developed the conceptual design of a lander-hopper, selected a notional science\npayload, evaluated hopper performance at the surface, created CAD drawing of the system, and\ngenerated a mass breakdown.\n\n51\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nIn Task 5, we developed the integrated system conceptual design and mass breakdown.\nThe bottom line result from this study can be summarized with the following: There may be a\nNew-Frontiers-class mission for a Pluto lander, and possibly for an orbiter, with a launch\nopportunity in 2029.\n\n52\n\n14 February 2018\nGlobal Aerospace Corporation\n\nNIAC Phase I Report\nPluto Hop, Skip, and Jump\n\n12 References\n[1] C.
