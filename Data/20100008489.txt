The major areas of work, or subtasks, within this DRP are: 1) Displays, 2) Controls, 3) Electronic\nProcedures and Fault Management, and 4) Human Performance Modeling. This DRP is a collaborative effort between researchers at\nJohnson Space Center and Ames Research Center.\n\nVisual displays\nLabel Alignment and Label-Value Distinction\nThe purpose of the FY08-FY09 studies was to investigate the effects of label orientation and label alignment on visual search.\nFY08 studies looked at the effect of label orientation, alignment, label length, and wrapping of text on visual search in various\ndisplay group sizes. To inform development of best-practice guidelines for label formatting, the study in FY09 examined the effects\nof the visual distinction of labels and values, label length, and label alignment on visual search times.\nTo inform development of best-practice guidelines for label formatting, the study examined the effects of the visual distinction of\nlabels and values, label length, and label alignment on visual search times. After reading a target word, participants searched for its\nassociated value in an array of eight label-value pairs embedded within an Orion-type display.\n\nVibration studies\nEffects of Thrust Oscillation Vibration on Maintaining Situation Awareness and\nAssuming Manual Flight Control\nConstellation Program (CxP) analyses indicate that the Orion crew vehicle will experience heightened vibration caused by thrust\noscillation (TO) in the Ares-I launch vehicle just prior to first-stage separation. In 2009, an HRP-CxP jointly funded study examined\nthe effects of TO vibration on the ability of thirteen Astronaut Office participants to maintain situation awareness of an evolving flight\nsimulation and to then hand-fly the spacecraft shortly after the vibration had stopped.\nOn each trial, participants seated in a semi-supine chair were repeatedly exposed to vibration in the body x-axis (chest-to-spine\ndirection). Participants made a speeded judgment as to whether the behavior of the pitch rate indicator, pitch needle, and predictor\ndots along the ascent trajectory line elements on a prototype Orion Primary Flight Display (PFD) provided consistent information, or,\nif not, which one of these three elements was inconsistent with the others. Two seconds after the vibration ended, participants\nprovided joystick inputs to null PFD indicators of pitch and roll errors.\nThe ~5 s average time to complete the PFD indicator assessment task grew steadily as the magnitude of representative TO\nvibration was increased from the baseline vibration-free condition, slowing down by up to 10% for the study\xe2\x80\x99s maximum 0.7 g-peak\nvibration profile. At the same time, participants\xe2\x80\x99 ratings of PFD usability and task workload were significantly degraded at the highest\nvibration levels when compared with the baseline. Surprisingly, the post-vibration hand-flying task revealed a statistically significant\nsix-fold growth (2.1% to 12.5%) in incorrect initial joystick inputs from the zero to 0.7 g-peak vibration conditions. These errors when\nthey occurred, however, were quickly corrected with no other vibration aftereffects observed in the participants\xe2\x80\x99 manual flight control\nperformance.\nThe results from this study guided CxP\xe2\x80\x99s establishment of vibration limits (i.e., launch and crew vehicle design requirements) to\nassure sufficient display usability by crew during periods of ascent thrust oscillation.\n\nExamples of labeled data columns using left and data-alignment\n\nThe visual distinction of the label/value pairs did not significantly affect response times (RTs) in either uniform (all words were\neither short or long) or mixed displays, meaning the use of neither bolding nor colons affected RTs. Label length and label\nalignment, however, did alter RTs: short labels led to shorter RTs than did long labels in uniform and mixed displays and dataaligned labels resulted in shorter RTs than did left-aligned labels. Thus, to decrease RTs for finding a particular value in a\ndisplay, one should use a short, data-aligned label in a mixed display.\n\nAuditory displays\nAlarms\nIn this study alarms currently in use with NASA flight deck displays and proposed candidate\nalarms have been evaluated. Eleven non-crew and 3 crew subjects were asked to rate six\ncandidate alarms in comparison to the current alarm for each category of alert used: caution,\nwarning, fire/smoke, and depressurization. Five of the candidate alarms were based on the\ncurrent alarm or a runner-up alarm sound from previous studies. The sixth sound included a\nspeech component that gave specific information about the situation. The sound of choice for\neach category was also rated on perceived urgency level, overall satisfaction, and the\nperceived value of a potential speech component. The results show that the use of a speech\nSoftware user-interface used in the study.\ncomponent is preferred by both crew and non-crew.\nVIBROVOX: Evaluation of speech communications under simulated launch vibration (0.7 g)\nThe potential effects of extreme acceleration and vibration during\nAres-I launch scenarios may impact the crew\xe2\x80\x99s speech\nproduction. We studied the effect of 0.5 and 0.7 g whole body\nvibration on the speech production of words (using the\nstandardized Diagnostic Rhyme Test word list). Six subjects\nwere recorded in a supine position using a specially designed\nchair and vibration platform. Vocal warbling, pitch modulation,\nand other acoustic distortion were observed.\nThe effect of vibration can be seen by comparing the right and left halves of the graphs below. Under vibration, the voice\xe2\x80\x99s\ntemporal waveform becomes \xe2\x80\x9crougher\xe2\x80\x9d due to the addition of higher frequency vibrations and greater amplitude modulation.\nIn the spectral plots (bottom), these effects correspond to interruption of the horizontal red and yellow lines (representative of\nacoustical energy at specific frequency regions). This temporal and spectral distortion under vibration results in perceptual\neffects (e.g., vocal warbling, pitch modulation) that may impact intelligibility.\n\nControls\nCursor Control Device Test Battery\nThe cursor control devices test battery was developed in Visual Basic. Five tasks were based on ISO 9241-9 (2000). Non-ISO\ntasks that had been used in previous evaluations were also added, including a multi-size and multi-distance pointing task\n(Everett, Holden & Whitmore, 2005), a text selection task (Gillan, Holden, Adam, Rudisill, & Magee, 1992), and a new task that\nincludes interaction with standard interface elements such as drop-down menus, sliders, and checkboxes. The test battery\nsoftware captures pointing, tracking or dragging times, as well as the number and types of errors. Furthermore, parameters\nsuch as target size, pointing direction, and distance between targets are adjustable for all tasks.\nIn FY09 the test battery has been updated with a main menu that allows researchers to set up studies for multiple subject and\ndevices. The user guide has been updated as well to reflect the changes.\n\n.\n\nUpdated main menu, demonstrations ,and experiment set-up page of the cursor control device test battery.\n\nCursor Movement\nThe purpose of the FY09 study was to compare the performance of multiple\ndiscrete CCDs on an Orion-type display. Twelve participants used the display\nwith four devices in 2-way mode and all but the rocker switch in 4-way mode\nwith their left-hands in extravehicular activity (EVA) gloves. Tasks for each\ndevice consisted of three elements: main menu navigation, navigation to\nobjects within the display, and commanding or selecting options for those\nobjects. Response times, errors, and subjective ratings were collected for each\ndevice and mode combination.\n\nDisplay and CCDs used in the cursor movement study\n\nFigure 1.

Rapid Prototyping Lab\xe2\x80\x99s prototype\nOrion Primary Flight Display (PFD) showing\npitch rate indicator, pitch needle, and ascent\ntrajectory predictor dots for the indicator\nassessment task developed in collaboration\nwith the Astronaut Office.\n\nFault management studies\nWe analyzed eye-movement data (collected during a previous human-in-the-loop Fault Management study) at a more\ngranular level. This allowed us to subdivide originally identified \xe2\x80\x9cregions of interest\xe2\x80\x9d into more specific \xe2\x80\x9careas of interest\xe2\x80\x9d\ncorresponding to individual display elements, such as edge-key labels. We then used the temporal sequences of fixations\nto these areas of interest as input to develop a visualization tool. This tool allows us to visualize (given the current area of\ninterest), the likelihood that each area of interest will be the next fixation target.\n\nThe Visualization Tool\xe2\x80\x99s next-fixation likelihoods, given the operator\xe2\x80\x99s\ncurrent fixation (yellow bar) on the velocity tape of the Primary Flight\nDisplay (PFD). The operator is most likely to fixate next on the PFD\xe2\x80\x99s\naltitude tape (34.1%) or the g-meter (20.6%).\nThis tool feeds into SHFE\xe2\x80\x99s multi-year research effort to develop a human performance model capable of predicting\ncompletion times and completion accuracy for a wide variety of targeted spacecraft tasks, with a wide variety of user\ninterface and human/machine functional allocation choices. The analyses of operator information acquisition patterns at\nthis more detailed level, along with the ability to visualize those patterns, are enabling direct empirical comparisons\nbetween the information acquisition strategies of human operators and the strategies generated by the human\nperformance model, as currently configured. Ongoing identification of systematic discrepancies between model-derived\npatterns and operator-derived patterns are informing and shaping model development efforts in 2010 and beyond.\n\n'
