b"Mission to Mars: Connecting Diverse Student Groups with\nNASA Experts\nTara Polsgrove 1 and David Jones2\nNASA MSFC Advanced Concepts Office ED04, Huntsville AL, 35812\nLeslie Sadowski-Fugitt 3 and Nicole Kowrach 4\nMuseum of Science and Industry, Chicago, IL 60637\n\nThe Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago has formulated an innovative approach\nto inspiring the next generation to pursue STEM education. Middle school students in\nChicago and at nearby Challenger Learning Centers work in teams to design a mission to\nMars. Each mission includes real time access to NASA experts through partnerships with\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nInteractive videoconferencing connects students at the museum with students at a\nChallenger Learning Center and with NASA experts. This paper describes the approach,\nthe results from the program\xe2\x80\x99s first year, and future opportunities for nationwide expansion.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nN\n\nASA has long had the mandate to inspire and help to educate the next generation. NASA investments in\neducation programs and support to educators around the country serve to strengthen NASA and the Nation's\nfuture workforce, attract and retain students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM,\ndisciplines, and engage Americans in NASA's mission. The program \xe2\x80\x9cMission to Mars: An Urban/Rural\nCollaborative to Inspire NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Next Generation\xe2\x80\x9d brings together the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI),\nChicago; the Challenger Learning Centers (CLC) in Woodstock and Bloomington/Normal, IL; the NASA Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC); the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC); and\nChicago Public Schools to create an informal, live distance learning program that broadens youth engagement with\nSTEM education and learning about NASA\xe2\x80\x99s research and goals for students in grades six through eight.\nThe above-named partners have jointly developed three 90-minute Mission to Mars scenarios designed for\ninformal settings with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s support. The three scenarios reflect the goals and activities of the Science and\nHuman Exploration and Operations Mission Directorates, and spotlight the research being conducted at specific\nNASA Centers. In each scenario, students work together to design a spacecraft focused on Mars exploration during\na field trip to the Museum or a Challenger Learning Center. Pre- and post- field trip curricula ensure that students\nget the maximum impact from their experience. One of the unique aspects of this program is that students gain the\nopportunity to videoconference and interact with NASA experts during their mission. Mission to Mars was\ndesigned to appeal to under-resourced students, add substantially to middle school education in the earth and space\nsciences, and create new alliances between formal and informal educators in inner city and rural areas while linking\nthem with the NASA Center\xe2\x80\x99s own educational outreach initiatives.\nThis paper presents an overview of the program, mission curriculum and implementation, a summary of\nfeedback from students, teachers, and NASA participants, and ideas on how this program could be replicated to\nreach more students across the country. It is the authors\xe2\x80\x99 hope that space professionals reading this paper will help\nto spread this program across the country and participate where possible.\n\n1\n\nAerospace Engineer, Advanced Concepts Office, ED04, NASA MSFC, Huntsville, AL 35812, non-member.\nAerospace Engineer, Advanced Concepts Office, ED04, NASA MSFC, Huntsville, AL 35812, non-member.\n3\nSenior Coordinator, Interactive Videoconferencing, Mission to Mars Program, Museum of Science and Industry,\nChicago, IL, non-member.\n4\nDirector of Teaching and Learning and Project Manager, Mission to Mars Program, Museum of Science and\nIndustry, Chicago, IL non-member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nII. Background\nThe Museum of Science and Industry and partners won a competitive NASA grant (Competitive Program for\nScience Museums and Planetariums, CP4SMP) in 2010.1 After curriculum and facility development the first\nstudent engagement began in the fall of 2011. During the 2011-12 school year 16 missions were conducted reaching\nover 1000 middle school students. The 2012-13 school year will have twice the number of missions and the hope is\nto grow the number of missions performed each year after. The NASA grant performance period is through June of\n2014, but the Museum intends to sustain the program by continuing to offer missions beyond the grant period.\nThe project goals are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nImplement new educational linkages via an interactive videoconferencing platform between MSI, a\nmajor inner city public school district, schools serving low income rural and suburban middle school\nstudents, and, initially, two Challenger Learning Centers (CLCs).\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nDesign, evaluate, and launch three programs that showcase research at NASA Centers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nPromote learning about NASA\xe2\x80\x99s space missions and enrich middle school curricula with experiences\nand challenges that inspire youth to pursue careers in NASA-related STEM.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nDevelop a broad dissemination plan with assistance from CLC National to distribute all materials\nregionally and nationwide and promote project replication among science centers, CLCs, school\ndistricts, NASA Centers, and other institutions of informal education.\nThe Mission to Mars program has been strategically developed to focus on the following three audience impacts\nfor middle school students in grades 6-8 in Chicago Public Schools particularly inner city, rural as well as suburban\nunder-served youth: 1) exploring STEM education with a focus on NASA research, missions, goals and aims indepth; 2) gaining skills in searching online resources, communicating effectively with their peers and adult role\nmodels, practicing 21st century science and technology skills, and ; 3) working collaboratively to tackle many of the\nsame challenges that NASA scientists are confronting themselves in the effort to travel to and inhabit Mars. Most of\nthe student target audience will attend schools where at least 50% of the students receive free or reduced lunch\nthrough the National School Lunch Program.\n\nIII. Implementation\nTeam members at MSI worked with each of the NASA partners to develop a mission or activity to engage the\nstudents that was similar to what the experts would do in their jobs. Each mission represents a different aspect of\npossible future missions to Mars; designing launch vehicles needed to send payloads to Mars, landing on Mars, and\nliving on Mars. Teachers select the mission for their class and receive preparation materials from MSI. Prior to\nmission day students make comparisons between Mars and Earth, learn about the current status of Mars exploration,\nand prepare a presentation about their class and school to share with the students at their partner CLC. When they\narrive, students at MSI and students at one of the participating Challenger Learning Centers are broken into teams to\nsolve the problems presented by their mission scenario. Once they\xe2\x80\x99ve completed their activities they share results\nwith each other and with experts via live video conference and have the opportunity to ask the experts questions.\nA. Mission Scenarios\n1. Scenario One: Planning A Mission To Mars\nIn Scenario One, Planning a Mission to Mars, students select a payload to send to Mars and then design a launch\nvehicle to get it there. Student teams work together to determine a scientific objective which leads them to choose a\nparticular type of spacecraft: orbiter, lander or rover. Then design a launch vehicle capable of lifting that spacecraft\nand sending it on its way to Mars. Students are presented with several options for boosters, core stage, and upper\nstage, each with different thrust levels and total weight. To have a successful launch they must ensure that the thrust\nof the core stage and boosters is greater than the weight of the total stack including payload and shroud. They must\nalso ensure that the thrust remains greater than the stack weight when the boosters separate and the core stage\npropellants are 50% consumed. They continue to calculate the thrust to weight ratio at each staging point along the\ntrajectory with no thrust to weight constraints.\nPiloting of Scenario One began on October 26, 2011, in partnership with Marshall Space Flight Center. Between\nlate October and the last run of Scenario One on February 1, 2012, the program reached approximately 220 middleschool students at off-site locations, and approximately 210 middle school students participating from MSI. All of\nthe scenarios are continuously developing and improving, and it is hoped that in the 2012-13 school year this\nscenario will include some simplified use of the rocket equation and the relationship of delta V to flight time from\nthe Earth to Mars.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n2. Scenario Two: Landing a Mission on Mars\nDuring this mission at the Museum and CLC, students participate in activities that simulate selecting a landing\nsite, landing a rover and exploring the physical attributes of Mars. Students at MSI and the CLCs explore geological\nprocesses that shape planets, perform chemistry experiments on simulated Martian soil samples and explore the\nphysics of light and reflectance through a set of hands-on activities. They then work together with their partners at a\ndistance to determine which instruments to include on an exploratory rover. Piloting of Scenario Two, in\npartnership with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, began in February 2012 and concluded on April 11, 2012.\n3. Scenario Three: Human Habitation On Mars\nDuring this session at MSI and the CLCs, students deliberate over building a long-term base on Mars, and\nconsider how resources such as food, water, atmosphere, and energy will be produced, procured and allocated.\nParticipants balance pros and cons of different space suit materials and use their knowledge of the Mars terrain and\natmosphere to design a base on the planet. Piloting of Scenario Three, began on April 25, 2012, in partnership with\nthe Johnson Space Center and concluded on May 9, 2012.\nB. Team Collaboration\nTo solve the various problems in the mission scenarios, students at each location are divided into small working\ngroups with specific roles for each individual: Leader, Manager, Communicator and Recorder. See Figure 1. This\nis an introduction to the way the experts work, solving complex problems in interdisciplinary teams. While the\ntimeframe for the mission, 90 minutes, is not enough to give the students a full appreciation of concurrent\nengineering or multiple design iterations going on simultaneously, they get a collaborative experience without being\noverwhelmed. Future plans for the 2012-13 school year include providing the teams at MSI and the Challenger\nLearning Centers with iPads that they can use to communicate with their counterparts. So Team A at MSI can\ncollaborate with Team A at the CLC for example using a dedication web-based Mission to Mars application.\n\nFigure 1. A team of students working on their launch vehicle design, Scenario 1.\n\nC. Expert Interaction\nNASA experts appear live for 30 minutes via videoconference to discuss the students\xe2\x80\x99 challenges and results,\nwhile discussing experiences from prior missions conducted by NASA and sharing stories about their own paths to\nworking at NASA. Figure 2 shows an expert answering a question by a student at the Challenger Learning Center in\nNormal IL. Back in school after the mission, students can continue learning through inquiry-based collaborative\nlearning projects and query NASA websites further for career and mission information.\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 2. Students interacting with experts via video conferencing software.\n\nIV. Results\nEven in its pilot year this program is already showing significant positive impact on students and teachers.\nMeasuring the effectiveness of this program is critical to continuing and increasing that success. During the pilot\nyear, pre- and post-mission surveys were developed for students and teachers by MSI Research and Evaluation\nteam. Feedback from the grant partners is also sought and taken into account to continuously improve the program.\nA. Survey of Teachers and Students\nSurveys and observations of students and teachers before and after each mission assessed the knowledge of\nNASA missions, attitudes towards science and engineering, and potential career interests of the students.\nPreliminary results of the pre- and post-program instruments showed that students tended to move away from\nspeculative statements about NASA experts and towards more concrete statements about those experts\xe2\x80\x99 actual job\nroles and responsibilities. Also, observations of the Missions show that students articulated independent solutions to\nscientific questions in four-fifths of the observed Missions, and that scientific data was shared between participants\nacross program sites in more than half of the observed Missions.\nIn addition to the surveys, teachers often shared anecdotal stories of how the experience influenced individuals in\ntheir class. Observers noted that students became most engaged while speaking with the experts. One teacher told\nprogram facilitators that one of her students who struggled in school told her that he wanted to work hard and do\nwhat it would take to go into a STEM field.\nB. Partner Feedback\nFull partner meetings occur at least twice a year. Anecdotal evidence of the programs impact is shared including\nany observed opportunities for improvements. For example the staff at the Normal CLC reported that students have\nbeen very engaged in the program, and sometimes the discussions with experts run long because students are so\ninterested and excited by the conversations. Students particularly seem to enjoy hearing what the NASA scientists\nwere like as kids themselves. The team at the Woodstock CLC reported that the NASA experts have been very\npatient with the students, providing encouragement when students become shy, nervous, etc. The students at\nWoodstock very much enjoy talking to the experts.\nFeedback from the volunteers at MSFC was positive regarding MSIs role in preparing the volunteers with tips\nfor speaking with middle school students. Expert participants indicated speaking to the students was a positive\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nexperience and they appreciated hearing the feedback on the impact of the expert interaction portion of the mission.\nThe expert volunteers really enjoy the students\xe2\x80\x99 questions, even when the questions are unexpected. One scientist\nmentioned that his favorite question a student asked was, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you need new lungs (lungs that process carbon\ndioxide) to breathe on Mars?\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor the 8 missions conducted with MSFC volunteers, 3 of the experts participated in each mission from a\nvolunteer pool of 14. This resulted in an average time commitment of less than an hour per person over a portion of\nthe school year. Commitment in this program is not overly burdensome even as the number of missions is expected\nto double in the year ahead and stretch across the entire school year. JPL and JSC participants had similar\nexperiences, and all of the missions were executed successfully.\n\nV. Opportunities for Growth\nThis activity is part of a NASA grant that continues through the year 2014. Near-term program growth is\nalready charted. MSI, and its CLC and NASA partners are excited to think about the possibility of expanding this\nsuccessful model across the country.\nThe MSI-led team is gearing up for a 2nd year of missions to begin in September of 2012 and is expected to\nreach more than 2,000 middle school students. Each of the partner centers will double the number of sessions\nsupported to 16 for MSFC, 8 for JPL and 8 for JSC. In the 2013-14 school year it is anticipated that a total of 45\nmissions will be conducted at an even split between the three participating NASA centers and reaching nearly 3,000\nstudents. See figures 3 and 4.\n\nFigure 3. Anticipated Program Growth\nIn Number of Missions Conducted by Year\n\nFigure 4. Anticipated Program Growth\nIn Number of Students Participating by Year\n\nOne of the great values of this program is that by using easily accessible IP-based videoconferencing, the\nprogram can be duplicated beyond the Illinois region and across the country. In the next year MSI will begin\nworking on a regional dissemination plan, and once the mission scenarios mature and stabilize MSI will be able to\nshare the program content and materials with other organizations. One example of how this model could expand\nwould be through the existing Challenger Learning Center partner. These centers promote education about space\nand exploration and are located across the country and internationally (see figure 5). They are often partnered with\nscience centers, museums, universities and schools, making the adoption of the Mission to Mars outreach program\nas it currently operates an attractive, and realistic, option. Of course there are many more museums, science centers,\nacademic institutions, and other organizations across the country that could have great success with this model as\nwell.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 5. Challenger Learning Center locations across the US.2\nThe other key component of expansion is a fresh supply of industry experts willing to donate a small portion of\ntheir time to inspire the next generation. At some point the existing partner NASA centers, MSFC, JPL, and JSC\nwill reach their threshold of capacity to support. That said there are other NASA centers, and many private\ncompanies whose contribution to space exploration has the capacity to inspire. See figure 6 for the locations of\nNASA centers across the US and their respective responsibility areas for providing speakers and supporting outreach\nactivities.\n\nFigure 6. NASA center responsibility split for providing outreach speakers.3\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nVI. Conclusions\nThe Mission to Mars program provides an exciting new way to engage students in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions and inspire\nthem to continue their STEM education. Surveys and observations indicate that students knowledge of NASA\nmissions and careers increases, their attitudes about whether STEM careers are interesting improves, and in many\ncases their self confidence about whether they have what it takes to be a scientist or engineer improves as a result of\nthis program. Videoconferencing with space professionals is a key component of the program and allows space\nprofessionals to reach beyond their local school districts to students who may have less direct access to NASA or\nspace-related outreach opportunities. There are many possible avenues to expand or duplicate this type of program\nat locations around the country where many more of our next generation can be educated and inspired.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nMosena, David; Ingram, Andrea, \xe2\x80\x9dMission to Mars: An Urban/Rural Collaborative to Inspire NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Next\nGeneration,\xe2\x80\x9c Competitive Program for Science Museums and Planetariums (CP4SMP), Grant # NNX10AD93G\n2\n\nChallenger Learning Center US Locations, http://www.challenger.org/clc/network.cfm, cited 8/21/2012\n\n3\n\nNASA Center Assignments by State, http://www.nasa.gov/about/speakers/nasa-state-assignments.html, cited\n8/21/2012\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nMission To Mars\nConnecting Diverse Student Groups\nwith NASA Experts\nTara Polsgrove & David Jones\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL\n\nLeslie Sadowski-Fugitt & Nicole Kowrach\nMuseum of Science and Industry, Chicago IL\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\nMission to Mars: Background\n\xef\x81\xb5A\n\nmulti-year education/outreach activity led by the Museum of\nScience and Industry in Chicago for middle school students\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 Partners:\no\n\nChicago Public Schools,\n\no\n\nChallenger Learning Centers in\nNormal and Woodstock Illinois,\n\no\n\nNASA MSFC, JPL and JSC\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 NASA\n\nGrant awarded in 2011\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 MSFC\n\nInvolvement coordinated\nthrough Tammy Rowan\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n2\n\nMission to Mars: Overview\n\xef\x81\xb5 Students\n\nfrom 2 schools connect through videoconference on\nmission day during a field trip to the Museum of Science and\nIndustry or a Challenger Learning Center\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 Students\n\ncollaborate to design one of 3 vehicles for a Mars\n\nmission:\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nLaunch Vehicle (MSFC),\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nMars Rover (JPL), or\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nMars Habitat (JSC).\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 Pre\n\nand Post field trip\ncurriculum is part of the mission\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nDiverse Student Groups\nChallenger\nLearning Center\nWoodstock\n\nMuseum of\nScience and\nIndustry (MSI)\n\nChallenger\nLearning Center\nNormal\n\nThis format brings together\nstudents from diverse urban and\nrural communities and gives them\nexperience in working together\nusing technology\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nMSFC\n\nYour Title Here\n\n4\n\nLaunch Vehicle Design\n\xef\x81\xb5 Students\n\nstack various launch\nvehicle stages together and\nassess\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nlift off thrust to weight ratio < 1\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nThrust to weight < 1 at booster\nseparation and subtracting half of\nthe propellant mass of the core\nstage\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nThrust to weigh unconstrained at\nremaining events\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n5\n\nSAFARI Video & Voice over IP Interaction\n\nMuseum of Science and\nIndustry\n\nChallenger Learning Center\n\nMSFCSubject Matter Experts\nDavid Jones,\nTracie Bedsole,\nDennis Creech\nVolunteer pool ~ 14\nParticipation is rewarding\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nYour Title Here\n\n6\n\nStudent Teams\n\xef\x81\xb5 Groups\n\nare broken out into 4 person teams for design\nexercises, each person has an assigned role\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nLeader,\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nManager,\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nCommunicator and\n\n\xef\x81\xb5\n\nRecorder\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 This\n\nis an introduction to collaborative engineering.\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 NASA\n\nexperts talk about their roles on our concurrent\nengineering teams and how this relates to the students\xe2\x80\x99 activity\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n7\n\nProgram Results to Date\n\xef\x81\xb5 Pre\n\nand Post mission surveys of teachers and students have\nbeen developed.
