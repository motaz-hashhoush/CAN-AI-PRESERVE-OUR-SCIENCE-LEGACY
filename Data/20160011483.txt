These challenges may be frequent\ndisruptions, unidirectional/asymmetric links, long delays, and high error rates.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDTN provides assured delivery of data using an automatic store-and-forward\nmechanism, while IP generally does not.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDTN can run over an existing Internet Protocol (IP) suite or can operate as a full\nInternetworking protocol.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDTN is being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and\nthe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), with open\ninternational standards, supported by open-source software that can help users\nimplement the new capabilities.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe standardized DTN protocol suite is the foundation of the Solar System\nInternet.\n\nThe Case for DTN\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Internet Protocol is based on Five Key Assumptions\n\xe2\x80\x93 Networks are Richly Connected\n\xe2\x80\x93 Networks have Short Delays\n\xe2\x80\x93 Data Links are Symmetric and Bi-Directional\n\xe2\x80\x93 Links have Low Error Rates\n\xe2\x80\x93 Network Nodes are Trustworthy\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Assumptions above are NOT VALID in the Space Environment\n\xe2\x80\x93 Connections can be blocked by orbital mechanics\n\xe2\x80\x93 Delays can be driven by very long distances\n\xe2\x80\x93 Links vary by spacecraft and ground station\n\xe2\x80\x93 Error rates can increase in this environment\n\xe2\x80\x93 Security is critical for reliable communications and control\n\nSample Multi-hop Scenario Using Traditional IP\nData to Transmit\n\nEVA\n\nComplete end-to-end path must be available\nS\nLink\nAvailable\n\nWaypoint\n\nRelay 1\n\nRelay 2\n\nGround Station\n\nD\nLatency\nThroughput\n\nTime\n\n9\n\nSample Multi-Hop Scenario Using DTN-Capable Nodes\n\nData to Transmit\n\nEVA\n\nOnly next hop needs to be available\nS\nLink\nAvailable\n\nWaypoint\n\nRelay 1\n\nRelay 2\n\nGround Station\n\nD\nLatency Decreases and Throughput Increases\n\nLatency\nThroughput\n\nTime\n\n1\n\nDTN Features\nThe DTN protocol suite was designed for disrupted, mobile, airborne, and near-Earth and\ndeep-space communications, featuring:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An internetworking layer that functions efficiently in environments with time-disjoint\nand/or simplex links\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A reliable data link layer that improves efficiency of end-to-end delivery by\nleveraging local link information and tighter local control loops\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Disruption-tolerant routing services that can take advantage of scheduled and\nexpected future connectivity, in addition to current connectivity, and that can\ninteroperate with or without a terrestrial routing infrastructure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Quality of service mechanisms to provide user control over the order in which traffic\nis served by the overlay internetworking layer and is independent of the underlying\nnetwork segments\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Security features that protect the infrastructure from unauthorized traffic and provide\nstandard end-to-end security capabilities (e.g. integrity, confidentiality) and \xe2\x80\x98over-theair\xe2\x80\x99 key management\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A network management system to configure, monitor, and provide accounting for\ntraffic passing through the system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 International standards (IETF & CCSDS)\n\nBenefits of DTN\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nImproved Operations and Situational Awareness: The DTN store-andforward mechanism along with automatic retransmission assures data\ndelivery, provides more insight into events during communication outages\nand significantly reduces the need for ground-based scheduling.\nInteroperability and Reuse: A standardized DTN protocol suite enables\ninteroperability of international and commercial partner communication\nassets, increases the availability of commercial hardware with DTN\nincluded, and allows NASA to use the same communication stack for future\nmissions (LEO, NEO or Deep Space).\nSpace Link Efficiency, Utilization and Robustness: DTN enables more\nreliable and efficient data transmissions resulting in more usable bandwidth.\nDTN also improves link reliability by having multiple network paths and\nassets for potential communication hops.\nSecurity: The DTN Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) allows for integrity\nchecks, authentication and encryption.\nQuality of Service: The DTN protocol suite allows for different priority\nlevels to be set for different data types, ensuring that the most important\ndata is received ahead of less important data.\n\nDTN Standardization\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe CCSDS DTN Working Group was established in 2008 and has\nsince published several documents, including recommended\nstandards of the core DTN protocols.\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCCSDS 734.0-G-1

communicate\n\xe2\x80\x93 Orbiters, landers, probes, sensors, robots \xe2\x80\x93 many more \xe2\x80\x9cthings\xe2\x80\x9d\nthan humans\n\xe2\x80\x93 When the opportunity to communicate arises, DTN allows for\nautomated, assured communications\n\xe2\x80\x93 With the increasing use of Space, we need more automation and\nless cognitive challenges for communicating\nThe evolving terrestrial IoT doesn\xe2\x80\x99t typically need immediate response\nand constant communication\n\xe2\x80\x93 Wearables, home automation, trending data, etc.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Some node storage is necessary for DTN, but is fairly cheap\nOther terrestrial use-cases could benefit from DTN\n\xe2\x80\x93 Sea-going vessels, outdoor explorers, wildlife research, etc.\nAs the terrestrial IoT grows (in number and in geographic distribution),\nmore infrastructure will be required to maintain all of the comm links\n\xe2\x80\x93 DTN is an alternative to the increased infrastructure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Automated,
