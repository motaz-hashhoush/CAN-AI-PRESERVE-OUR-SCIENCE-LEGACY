These can\nand will be described from many points of view.\nTo us Constellation was born of the charred debris, scattered in the Piney Woods of East Texas\nthat were reverently collected as the last remains of that delicate machine Columbia , she that\nfailed to preserve the lives of our friends and colleagues due to our own very human errors. The\npainful acknowledgement of those errors became foundational principles for what later emerged\nas the nation\xe2\x80\x99s new space exploration program: Constellation.\nThose of us who worked in the program were bound by a common belief that America\xe2\x80\x99s future\nlies in the Final Frontier; indeed that America must lead the way there. We joyfully dedicated our\nworking lives and careers to building the ships that would sail those treacherous seas. We had\nprepared ourselves for this challenge, having learned from the best and honed our skills in the\nunique arena of human space flight. We were driven by the hope that America would one day\nstep beyond the known, and were blessed when the national will bent toward our dreams for a\nmoment. It was a privilege and an honor to have a hand in this endeavor. Perhaps our greatest\nshared joy and satisfaction came from the recognition that amid the inherent tumult of a\nprogram of this size and scope, we bore the challenges with teammates of superior skill and\ndedication. We understood that another generation would explore using what we had conceived\nand built. We rejoiced at our successes, but also knew faults and failures. This, the summation\nof what we have learned, is our final expression of that cherished hope.\nTo our families, we beg your forgiveness for the long hours away, and too many distracted\nconversations. Thank you for indulging our passion.\nAnd, to our generational forebears in human space flight, our hope is that our efforts honor you.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final

This companion document, Volume II, expands on this information and\nprovides more detailed analyses for those seeking further background, insight, and information.\nIt contains new subjects that were not covered in Volume I.\nIn this volume, Section 1.0 introduces our approach in preparing and organizing the content to\nenable rapid topical location and assimilation of lessons. Section 2.0 describes the contextual\nframework in which the Constellation Program was formulated and functioned; this is necessary\nto understand most of the lessons. Section 2.0 supplies an expansion of the briefer contextual\ndescription provided in Volume I. As noted in Volume I, context of a former program may seem\nirrelevant in the heady days of new program formulation. However, readers should take some\ntime to understand the context. Many of the lessons would be different in another context, so\nreaders should reflect on the similarities and differences in their current circumstances. Section\n3.0 summarizes key findings, which appear in Volume I, that were developed from significant\nlessons learned at the program level, and provides a link between the key findings and the\ntopical arrangement of lessons learned in this volume. Readers can use the key findings in\nSection 3.0 to peruse for particular topics, and will find more supporting detail and analyses in\nSection 4.0 in a topical format arranged according to traditional NASA program disciplines. The\nAppendices (A and B) provide insight from the project view of lessons learned.\nThe reader will no doubt recognize some very similar themes from previous lessons learned,\nblue-ribbon committee reviews, National Academy reviews, and advisory panel reviews for this\nand other large-scale human space flight programs; including Apollo, Space Shuttle, Shuttle/Mir,\nand the International Space Station. This could represent an inability to learn lessons from\nprevious generations; however, it is more likely that similar challenges persist in the Agency\nstructure and approach to program formulation, budget advocacy, and management.\nPrior lessons learned also drove planning for and formulation of Constellation; the reader may\nobserve attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to avoid pitfalls encountered by previous\nprograms, and reflect on the outcomes and recommendations.\nPerhaps the greatest value of these Constellation lessons learned can be found in viewing them\nin context with those previous efforts to guide and advise the Agency and its stakeholders.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\nviii\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the actual day of battle, naked truths may be picked up for the asking; by the following\nmorning they have begun to get into their uniforms.\xe2\x80\x9d--Gen. Sir Ian Hamilton\nThese lessons learned are part of a suite of hardware, software, test results, designs,\nknowledge base, and documentation that comprises the legacy of the Constellation Program.\nThe context, summary information, and lessons learned are presented in a factual format, as\nknown and described at the time. While our opinions might be discernable in the context, we\nhave avoided all but factually sustainable statements. Statements should not be viewed as being\neither positive or negative; their value lies in what we did and what we learned that is worthy of\npassing on.\nThe lessons include both \xe2\x80\x9cdos\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99ts.\xe2\x80\x9d In many cases, one person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d can be viewed as\nanother person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d; therefore, we have attempted to capture both perspectives when\napplicable and useful.\nWhile Volume I summarizes the views of those who managed the program, this Volume II\nencompasses the views at the working level, des cribing how the program challe nges manifested\nin day-to-day activities. Here we see themes that were perhaps hinted at, but not completely\naddressed, in Volume I: unintended consequences of policies that worked well at higher levels\nbut lacked proper implementation at the working level; long-term effects of the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneration gap\xe2\x80\x9d\nin human space flight development, the need to demonstrate early successes at the expense of\nthorough planning, and the consequences of problems and challenges not yet addressed\nbecause other problems and challenges were more immediate or manifest.\nNot all lessons learned have the benefit of being operationally vetted, since the program was\ncancelled shortly after Preliminary Design Review. We avoid making statements about\noperational consequences (with the exception of testing and test flights that did occur), but we\ndo attempt to provide insight into how operational thinking influenced design and testing.\nThe lessons have been formatted with a description, along with supporting information, a\nsuccinct statement of the lesson learned, and recommendations for future programs and\nprojects that may be placed in similar circumstances.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n1\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n2.0 CONTEXT \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWHERE YOU STAND DEPENDS ON\nWHERE YOU SIT\xe2\x80\x9d\n2.1\n\nA Brief Description of the Program\n\nNASA formed the Constellation Program in 2005 to achieve the objectives of maintaining\nAmerican presence in low-Earth orbit, returning to the moon for purposes of establishing an\noutpost, and laying the foundation to explore Mars and beyond in the first half of the 21st\ncentury. The Constellation Program\xe2\x80\x99s heritage rested on the successes and lessons learned\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s previous human space flight programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle,\nand the International Space Station (ISS).\nFollowing the loss of Columbia, NASA established the Columbia Accident Investigation Board\n(CAIB) to perform an in-depth review of the Space Shuttle Program. As a result of this review,\nthe CAIB concluded that it was in the best interest of the U.S. to develop a replacement for the\nSpace Shuttle. The CAIB concluded that it should be possible, using past and future\ninvestments in technology, to develop the basis for a system \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly improved over one\ndesigned 40 years earlier, for carrying humans to orbit and enabling their work in space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn January 2004, The White House issued a new exploration initiative to return humans to the\nMoon by 2020 in preparation for human exploration of Mars and beyond. As part of this\ninitiative, NASA would continue to use the Space Shuttle to fulfill its obligation to complete\nassembly of the ISS and then retire the Space Shuttle by 2010. NASA would also build and fly a\nnew Crew Exploration Vehicle (since named Orion) by 2014. In 2005, Congress expressly\nendorsed the President\xe2\x80\x99s exploration initiative and authorized NASA to \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6establish a program\nto develop a sustained human presence on the moon, including a robust precursor program to\npromote exploration, science, commerce and U.S. preeminence in space, and as a steppingstone to future exploration of Mars and other destinations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn response to the Presidential direction, in 2004 the Agency formed the Exploration Systems\nMission Directorate (ESMD) at NASA Headquarters to oversee development of exploration\nprograms. The Constellation Systems Division was initiated to oversee human exploration\nmission development.\nIn May 2005, the NASA Administrator commissioned the Exploration Systems Architecture\nStudy (ESAS), a 60-day study to perform the tasks of defining the top-level requirements and\nconfigurations for crew and cargo launch systems to support exploration objectives. The study\nconcluded that the launch vehicles should be derived from existing technologies, leveraging the\nlessons learned from past programs. The ESAS recommended an architecture that formed the\nbasis of the Constellation Program.\nSince exploration of the moon and beyond was the overarching goal of the Constellation\nProgram, all elements were designed to perform lunar missions, while also being capable of\nperforming missions to the ISS. The Program was phased as a stepwise capability buildup\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n2\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nlargely based on Space Shuttle heritage components. The Initial Capability (IC) comprised\nelements necessary to service the ISS by 2015 with crew rotations, included the Orion Crew\nExploration Vehicle, the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle, and the supporting ground and mission\ninfrastructure that would enable these missions. The Constellation Lunar Capability (LC) added\nthe Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle, the Altair Lunar Lander, and spacesuits designed for partialgravity exploration. Lunar outpost elements and capabilities were to follow, including mobility\nelements such as rovers, permanent or semipermanent habitats, and power and communication\nelements to support a sustained exploration presence.\nThe Constellation Program was managed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) with the following\nseven \xe2\x80\x9chardware development\xe2\x80\x9d project offices:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCrew Exploration Vehicle Project (the Orion spacecraft), at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExploration Launch Projects (the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles), at the Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGround Operations Project (development of launch and recovery facilities) at the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMission Operations Project (development of flight and mission control facilities) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExtravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Project (spacesuit and tool development) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLunar Lander Project (the Altair lunar descent and ascent module) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLunar Surface Systems Pre-project (advanced planning for lunar habitats and surface support\nsystems) at JSC\n\nOrion, Ares I, Ground Operations, Mission Operations, and EVA comprised the IC projects. Ares\nV, the Altair and Lunar Surface Systems, and upgrades to the IC to meet lunar interfaces and\nrequirements comprised the LC projects.\nBy 2010, all elements of the IC had achieved Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and test flights\nwere under way, with the successful launches of Ares I-X and the Orion Pad Abort-1 tests. The\nWhite House announced cancellation of the program on Feb. 1, 2010, on the seventh anniversary\nof the loss of Columbia and her crew.\nAccording to the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (PL 111-267, Oct. 11, 2010), elements of the\nConstellation Program will continue in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s current planning. The Orion vehicle is redesigned\nas the multipurpose crewed vechicle (MPCV) and will likely enable crew launch on a variety of\nlaunch vehicles. The Space Launch System (SLS), intended as the vehicle to launch crews and\ncargo beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), has various configurations under consideration including\noptions based on Space Shuttle and Ares heritage designs and hardware. The Ground\nOperations infrastructure at the Kennedy Space Center, developed for Constellation, will be\nadapted to the SLS and new commercial launch capabilities.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n3\n\nConstellation Program\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe Program Environment \xe2\x80\x94 Key to Understanding the Lessons Learned\nProgram Scope\n\nThe Constellation Program was conceived as a multi-decadal undertaking, with the primary goal\nof enabling human exploration beyond LEO. It was to serve as the Space Shuttle successor not\nonly in function, but also in utilization of facilities and workforce. It was to provide the primary\nmode of delivery of crews to the ISS, enable the construction and operation of an outpost on the\nmoon, and enable human exploration of Mars. As the Agency flagship program, the effort\nspanned all 10 NASA centers and multiple large-scale acquisitions. It required modernizing an\ninfrastructure designed and sized largely for the Apollo Program in the 1960s. Moreover, it\nrequired leading a workforce generationally removed from the previous human spacecraft launch\nand entry development challenges.\nWhile the near-term focus of the program was providing crew transport to the ISS via the IC, the\ncapability to go beyond LEO drove many technical and programmatic decisions. These decisions\nwere suboptimal when viewed with only near-term objectives in mind, while they were\nnecessary to support the LC phases of the program. They, in some cases, also increased risk to\nthe IC through incorporation of newer technologies with less flight heritage. The need for\ncommonality to decrease life-cycle cost and complexity drove many decisions. For example, the\nAres I design used a five-segment, solid-chemical first stage along with the J2-X upper-stage\nengine. Other simpler, less-costly designs could have been used to optimize for Ares I alone,\nbut in context with the Ares V development, these elements lowered the overall program design\ncomplexity, risk, and cost.\nOptimization for the long-term program drove not only design decisions, but also infrastructure\nneeds, standards, organizational structure, units of measure (SI [international system of units]),\ndata architecture, etc., that would not have been necessary for the IC alone. The primary\nobjective of stepping beyond LEO with the LC was optimized at the expense of having an IC\nthat was more costly and complex than necessary as a stand-alone development.\n2.2.2\n\nProgram Funding\n\nFunding for the Constellation Program was inconsistent and unreliable from its initial formulation\nthrough its cancellation. Indeed, this inconsistency became the chronic constraint that\naggravated all other constraints. Figure 1 illustrates this persistent problem. The program\nexperienced a 10% budget cut prior to PDR. In addition, the funding \xe2\x80\x9cprofile\xe2\x80\x9d (how the money is\nallocated on a yearly basis) was far less than optimal for a development project. Typical\ndevelopment projects swell in funding as they enter the design development phases.\nConstellation had to adjust its work to accommodate a funding \xe2\x80\x9cnotch\xe2\x80\x9d in fiscal year (FY)10 as a\nresult of Agency funding limitations due to Space Shuttle retirement. While Constellation was\nexpected to transport crews to and from the ISS soon after Space Shuttle retirement, the\nfunding ramp-up needed for development was not available until after the Space Shuttle retired.\nThis, of course, put pressure on program content, schedule, and rationale for the ISS crew\nrotation mission (Initial Operational Capability [IOC]).\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n4\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n6,000\n\nCx IOC\nBudget\nProfile\n\nTypical Development Curve\n\n$ in M\n\n4,500\n\n3,000\n\nBudget Reductions in\nearly years = budget over runs\nin out years to achieve\nsimilar schedule\n1,500\n\n0\nFY06\n\nFY07\n\nFY08\n\nFY09\n\nESAS\n\nFY10\n\nFY11\n\nPMR09\n\nFY12\n\nFY13\n\nFY14\n\nFY15\n\n2010 PBS\n\n12,000\n\n9,000\n\n6,000\n\n3,000\n\n0\nFY06\n\nFY07\n\nFY08\n\nFY09\n\nFY10\n\nFY11\n\nFY12\n\nFY13\n\nFY14\n\nFY15\n\nFY16\n\nFY17\n\nFY18\n\nFY19\n\nFY20\n\nRY$ In M\nESAS\nPMR09\n2010 PBS\n\nFY06\n2,333\n1707\n1707\n\nFY07\n2,976\n1779\n1779\n\nFY08\n3,195\n2514\n2514\n\nFY09\n4,202\n3085\n3085\n\nFY10\n5,034\n3454\n3454\n\nFY11\n7,273\n6085\n5524\n\nFY12\n7,994\n6346\n5444\n\nFY13\n8,324\n6991\n5376\n\nFY14\n8,558\n7145\n5570\n\nFY15\n8,948\n7856\n6153\n\nFY16\n9,547\n9145\n6161\n\nFY17\n11,107\n9983\n6170\n\nFY18\n11,422\n10294\n6178\n\nFY19\n11,744\n10582\n6186\n\nFY20\n12,073\n10854\n6195\n\nTotal\n114730\n97820\n71496\n\nPMR09 vs. ESAS Delta\nPassback vs. ESAS Delta\n\n(626)\n(626)\n\n(1197)\n(1197)\n\n(681)\n(681)\n\n(1117)\n(1117)\n\n(1580)\n(1580)\n\n(1188)\n(1749)\n\n(1648)\n(2550)\n\n(1333)\n(2948)\n\n(1413)\n(2988)\n\n(1092)\n(2795)\n\n(402)\n(3386)\n\n(1124)\n(4937)\n\n(1128)\n(5244)\n\n(1162)\n(5558)\n\n(1219)\n(5878)\n\n(16910)\n(43234)\n\nFig. 1: Constellation budget profiles before and after budget reductions (ESAS=Exploration\nSystem Architecture Study, the initial program budget baseline; PMR=Program Manager\xe2\x80\x99s\nRecommendation based on \xe2\x80\x9cmarks\xe2\x80\x9d passed down by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] and\nNASA Headquarters [HQ]; PBS=President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Submittal)\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of budget pressure on major schedule milestones (PDR, Critical\nDesign Review [CDR], IOC, and human lunar return [HLR]). IOC moved 2 years (2012 to 2014)\ndue to the first budget cut. The program was able to recapture 1 year of that loss by replanning\n(at greater risk). Subsequent budget cuts pushed IOC further, into 2015. The program was\nrequired to hold the IOC schedule commitment to 2015, since this was the \xe2\x80\x9cno later than\xe2\x80\x9d date\nthat had been committed to the U.S. Congress.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n5\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nFig. 2: Consequences of funding cuts on Constellation major milestones\nThe phasing of the program exacerbated the funding challenges, in a \xe2\x80\x9crob Peter to pay Paul\xe2\x80\x9d\nfashion. The viability of the lunar program phase was under constant threat, as it was the only\nsouce to supplement shortfalls in the IC when schedule slips had been exhausted (see effect of\nthe fixed-base costs, below). The lunar phase of the program (e.g., HLR in Fig. 2) bore the brunt\nof the cuts that could be accommodated in out-years and was pushed even further than the IOC\nmilestones. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 (observe that IOC was \xe2\x80\x9cheld\xe2\x80\x9d in 2015 while HLR slipped\nalmost 2 years).\nConstellation was planned with adequate budget reserves, although these reserves were not\nphased to be most useful to the program (i.e., much of the reserve was phased later in the\nprogram schedule rather than earlier). An unfortunately prevalent perspective on program\nreserves in the federal government is that reserves are seen as \xe2\x80\x9cover-funding\xe2\x80\x9d that can be\ndepleted to address other issues, or drawn back to the Treasury if unused within an FY. Agency\nreserves (i.e., allowance for program adjustment [APA] funds) had been eliminated long ago.\nConstellation reserves were intially planned to fund risk mitigation efforts. Reserves were rapidly\ndepleted due to the combined effects of budget cuts, Agency \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes,\xe2\x80\x9d and efforts to hold\nschedule without sacrificing content. Subsequently, risk mitigations were reduced and then\neliminated, leaving little recourse to resolve the typical technical challenges that crop up in a\ndesign of this magnitude and complexity. Risk accrued as a result.\nThe large acquisitions for design and construction of the major components of the program were\nplanned, sized, and budgeted early in the program, as neccessitated to meet schedule objectives.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n6\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe prime contractors\xe2\x80\x99 costs typically ramped up in accordance with plan. These costs were\ncomprised of both \xe2\x80\x9dfixed-base\xe2\x80\x9d elements (work force, test facilities, etc.), and variable elements.\nAs the program dealt with subsequent budget cuts, the fixed-base elements were extremely\ndifficult to reduce; cuts tended to be absorbed within variable elements (e.g., deferred hardware\nbuys). This led to a number of problems: schedule risk increased as more activities crept onto\nthe critical path; planned activities were deferred to reduce risk, thus delaying risk mitigation\nstrategies and increasing overall risk; we faced an exercise in diminished returns, in which fewer\nand fewer items remained in the variable elements of the budget to defer to the next round of\nreductions.\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle Program looming, there was great pressure to\nassimilate as much of the shuttle-heritage \xe2\x80\x9cfixed-base\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., work force, infrastructure, and\nindustrial base) from that program as possible, per direction NASA received in two Authorization\nActs (2005, 2008). While the operational requirements and sustaining budget planned for\nConstellation were smaller than those of the Space Shuttle Program, nearly every component,\nbuilding, fleet, process, and cadre of workers had its advocacy group to sustain it. Because of\nthe phasing of the Constellation Program, much of the infrastructure was not needed for the IC\nbut would be needed for the LC. This created an Agency-wide phasing challenge for these\nassets: Should NASA retire/mothball the asset, or sustain it for many years unused?\nThe tight coupling of the Space Shuttle retirement to the buildup of the Constellation IC, along\nwith the necessity to plan the IC and the LC with a large degree of commonality, made sense\nstrategically when the plan was developed, but only if all schedule and funding assumptions\nheld. The rationale did not withstand subsequent budget pressure and consequential schedule\nslips.\nThe Constellation Program hardware development budget was also, in an absolute sense, large\nat the Agency level and not yet operational (as Space Shuttle and ISS were), so it was often\nperceived as the only source for unexpected expenses that cropped up in the Agency. Indeed,\nexpenses were charged to the program that did not benefit the program. This is not atypical for\nflagship programs in governmental developments.\nCash flow disruptions, resulting from Congressional continuing resolutions (CRs), had been an\noccasional source of funding problems for the Agency in the past. These became annual events\nDuring Constellation\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, and many times lasted well into the new FY. While these are\nexperienced government-wide, they are particularly onerous on developmental programs in\nearly stages when funding levels are increasing toward their peak. A typical program \xe2\x80\x9cramp-up\xe2\x80\x9d\nis nearly impossible during a CR. These funding shortfalls, which sent annual \xe2\x80\x9csquare-waves\xe2\x80\x9d of\nadditional replanning through the program, projects, and contractor communities, were never\nfully attenuated through the remainder of the FY.\nThe Constellation Program content, constituted by the elements of the program architecture,\nalong with their associated performance requirements were held as a higher priority than schedule\nperformance by the Agency leadership; therefore, in the budget environment framed above,\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n7\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nschedules slipped, risks accrued, and reserves were depleted before serious consideration was\ngiven to descope program content.\n2.2.3\n\nThe Mos aic of NAS A Pa rticipation\n\nAs Constellation was the flagship program for the Agency, project and program work was\ndistributed across the Agency to support the concept of maintaining \xe2\x80\x9c10 Healthy Centers\xe2\x80\x9d (Fig.\n3). This distribution was planned at the Agency level. The concept was not sufficiently defined to\nsatisfy either centers or the program in light of the Space Shuttle retirement. Details of the\nimplementation were left to the program to sort out in consultation with center management.\nThis resulted in a persistent tension between what was most efficient for the program vs. what\nwas best for a particular NASA center to sustain or grow its current role. The nationwide team\nwas probably larger than necessary, but it also covered \xe2\x80\x9cunused capacity\xe2\x80\x9d at some centers. The\nlarge teams at multiple locations led to instances of overlapping or unclear roles and\nresponsibilities. Decisions taken to perform tasks \xe2\x80\x9cin-house\xe2\x80\x9d using an on-site work force at a\ncenter vs. contracting the task out were often made at the center or project level, and were not\noptimized for overall program benefit.\n\nFig. 3: The Constellation distributed team\nThe involvement of all 10 NASA centers exposed cultural differences that had to be managed\nby a management team whose members were geographically removed. Each center had\ndifferent requirements, procedures, and processes that were documented at various levels of\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n8\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\ndetail and constraint. While the apportionment of responsibility was useful to each center, the\nAgency had not completed effort to assure that the requirements, procedures, and processes\nwere consistent, non-duplicative, and noncontradictory. This placed a particular burden on the\ncontractor community since it was charged with identification and compliance with duplicative\nand sometimes contradictory requirements. The mismatch of design and construction standards\namong centers, along with demands from the \xe2\x80\x9cinsight\xe2\x80\x9d work force at each center, was a\nworrisome burden for contractors, constantly threatening their ability to meet schedule\nmilestones and cost thresholds. The NASA use of an independent technical authority provided\nyet another source of direction and, thus confusion, to the contractor community. Although\nofficial direction can only flow to contractors via the Contracting Officer (CO), informal\ndiscussions and decisions coming from the program and separately from the technical authority\nsometimes made it difficult for contractors to distinguish a final decision from an interim\ndecision.\nThe industrial base used by the Space Shuttle Program and, to a lesser extent, the ISS Program\nwas managed by a separate mission directorate at NASA HQ. Overlapping strategic interests\namong the three programs (e.g., facility usage, floor space, test stands) had to be resolved at\nthe highest levels in the Agency (between mission directorates).\nThe position of an Agency flagship program carried benefits as well. The program had access to\nthe entire Agency knowledge base, along with skills and infrastructure. The program was\nviewed as a high priority at all centers, since it represented a path to a sustainable and growing\nrole in most areas of expertise. Engagement of nontraditional human space flight centers\nallowed the program to tap into unique skills, approaches, and facilities. Contractors benefited\nfrom NASA technical depth and expertise, along with access to unique facilities (e.g., engine\ntest stands, large vacuum chambers). The early test flights, Ares I-X and Orion Pad Abort-1,\ndemonstrated the benefits of multicenter teams. These projects were successful early pathfinders\nin identifying and resolving the problems that could arise from a conflict of cultures in design,\ntest, and manufacturing.\n2.2.4\n\nThe Generation Gap in Hum an Space Flight\n\nThe work force that supported Constellation was not only geographically distributed; it was also\nbifurcated in crucial experience level. Since NASA human space flight developments have\noccurred on 20- to 30-year cycles, most of the Constellation work force was generationally\nremoved from the previous human spacecraft development, particularly the launch and entry\ndevelopment challenges. The Space Shuttle design was performed in the mid 1970s and tested\nin the late 1970s and early 1980s, prior to the birth of many of the engineers working on\nConstellation. ISS design and development (which relied on the Space Shuttle for launch and\nentry of crew and equipment) took place in the late 1980s and into the mid 1990s. The\nConstellation Program was replete with ISS experience; however, only senior engineers and\nleaders in the Constellation Program had been involved in the early development stages and\nknew the pitfalls and travails in starting up a national-scale program. Most of the work force was\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n9\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nwell versed in operating human spacecraft either via Shuttle, the ISS, or both, but only partially\naware of how early design compromises affected those very operations.\nThe Agency took extraordinary steps to deepen the design skills of the work force. The critical\nthinking necessary to perform systems engineering (SE) design\xe2\x80\x94which was emphasized in formal\nand informal training, lessons-learned briefings, leadership postings, work force discussions,\nand work rotations\xe2\x80\x94became a focus at the level of the NASA Administrator. Opportunities for\ntesting smaller development projects early were created to enhance work force experience.\nTo reach back and capture launch and return vehicle development experience, the Constellation\nProgram created a ready resource known as SAGES [Shuttle and Apollo Generation Expert\nServices]. This contract provided a simple pathway by which to enlist the aid of retired experts\nfrom the NASA past (e.g., George Mueller, Chris Kraft, Glynn Lunney, Dick Kohrs, etc.). Beyond\nreview and advice, SAGES was created to transfer knowledge through mentoring. It was based\non relationships between Apollo- and Shuttle-era program managers and discipline experts and\nthe Constellation team. It provided mentors on an as-needed, targeted basis in areas ranging\nfrom technical design and analysis disciplines, to ground and flight operations, and to program\nmanagement.\nA perspective drawn from past programs is invaluable in many ways. To individuals, it provides\nresiliency in the face of challenge, particularly if the challenge has been met before, albeit under\ndifferent circumstances. To organizations, it lends strength and stability to the organization by\nhaving key personnel with this type of resiliency willing to mentor those who do not.\n2.2.5\n\nThe Size of the Trade Space\n\nAn inherent characteristic of the early design phases in a large-scale development is the scope\nof the \xe2\x80\x9ctrade space\xe2\x80\x9d within which designers and managers can make choices. Fundamental\nchoices at this stage have very long-term consequences. Choices of fuels, engines, outer moldlines, volumes, materials, etc. have a vast number and sequence of \xe2\x80\x9ctouch points\xe2\x80\x9d in an existing\nand future infrastructure. In the case of Constellation, these touch points ranged from ground\ninfrastructure already in place from earlier programs, to the lunar and martian surfaces. During\nmaturation of a program, a trade space stabilizes and shrinks as choices are made and designs\nsolidify. As we approach testing and operations, that trade space narrows. While new design\nwork can occur in mature, operational programs, akin to those of ISS or Shuttle, the trade space\nis typically very limited and choices are few.\nDue to the scope of the trade space for Constellation, early choices and decisions were very\noften brought into question when new knowldege was introduced, as new or overlooked touch\npoints were discovered, or when budget and schedule constraints limited preferred choices. For\na work force most adapted to the very limited trade space available in operational programs such\nas Shuttle and ISS, this cycle of working through options (and changing options as constraints\nchange) can look like churn, indecision, and lack of leadership. And for a leadership team most\nfocussed on socialization of major decisions with Agency mangagement, insufficient attention to\nthis perception leads to frustration at the working level.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n10\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThis difference in perception is manifest in many of the lessons learned that follow. Here are a\nfew perspectives that illustrate these contrasting points of view. While some may be in opposition,\neach view is relevant because it affected daily operations and interactions in the work force.\nOn decision making:\nYounger engineer: \xe2\x80\x9cThis [changing of decisions] could have been avoided by having a daily tagup [meeting] as was done\xe2\x80\xa6.on the ISS Program.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOlder engineer: \xe2\x80\x9cISS took much longer to get to PDR\xe2\x80\xa6.with lots of upheaval getting there. It\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t until around CDR that daily tags chaired by a strong leader were added to improve\nprogress and accountability.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYounger engineer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe program revisits the same decisions over and over. There seems to be\nno accountability for sticking with decisions that have been made.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOlder engineer: \xe2\x80\x9c[Space Station] Freedom had three program managers in 4 years. The\narchitecture was constantly changing, from power-tower to a single truss; from solar dymanic\npower to combined SD [solar dynamics] and PV [photovoltaic] power and back again to SD and\nback to finally PV. Then segments were cut from the truss, creating the shadowing that we deal\nwith operationally today. And, it took years to get to the 20-kHz power architecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\n2.2.6\n\nPhas ing of Project/Program Start-up\n\nTwo of the primary projects, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares Crew Launch\nVehicle, were begun well in advance of the Constellation Program. 1 This enabled rapid start-up\nand early results from each of these projects. They functioned for some time without an\nintegration function between them, which led to an eventual Program Integration (PI) function\nthat was very lean by historical norms. 2 This rapid start-up enabled rapid contract competition.\nHowever, these contracts were not fully scoped for the physical and analytical integration that\nwas necessary. They were focussed on the IC, since trade studies had not been performed that\nwould optimize an integrated architecture. These factors led to costly contract changes when\nthe appropriate level of integration for a complete architecture was better understood.\nThis approach also provided an additional integration challenge; namely, the projects had\nformed requirements, budgets, design approaches, acquisition strategies, etc., that needed to\nbe integrated retroactively. The late addition of integrating functions had a long-term effect that\nwas not fully resolved by the end of the program. Strategies that were in a collective self-interest\nfor the program were extraordinarily difficult to implement due to the cost of contract changes.\n1\n\nThe most logical approach to starting up a new program is to first understand the \xe2\x80\x9cbig picture\xe2\x80\x9d before\ndecomposing that end state into smaller and smaller elements. This is why it is ideal to first start up a\nprogram office with its integration products, then to start up project offices to accomplish the hardware\ndevelopment. This was not the case in the Constellation Program.\n2\nA typical large space flight program historically uses approximately 10% to 15% of its budget for PI. The\nConstellation Program was relatively lean, spending 5% to 7.5% on these functions.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n11\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nExamples of these include unit policy (SI vs. heritage English units of design and construction),\ndata architecture, and facilities management. Boards and panels had been formed prior to the\nprogram office, which meant these boards and panels had different structures and responsibilities.\nIntegration of these into a program board and panel structure confounded decision making.\nMoreover, integrated analyses by the program uncovered technical issues that could have been\ncaught earlier (and been resolved in a more efficient manner) if the start-up timing had been\ndifferent. 3\nIncentives on contracts were developed primarily to benefit each project rather than the overall\nprogram. Missing were incentives for contractors to participate in technical solutions that benefit\nthe integrated program. This drove results that were less than optimum, and sometimes not\nmutually compatible.\n2.2.7\n\nStarting Well vs . Dem ons trating Early Succes s\n\nMany of the following detailed lessons learned describe the repurcussions of starting projects\nbefore the program is started. The start-up phasing described above was primarily driven by the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s need to demonstrate early successes to secure political support.\nExperiences from the early stages of ISS may also have contributed to the push for early\nsuccess. The ISS Program had its roots in the prior Space Station Freedom Program, a program\nthat suffered \xe2\x80\x9cfits and starts\xe2\x80\x9d in the effort to \xe2\x80\x9cstart well\xe2\x80\x9d and proceed to PDR as it underwent\nseveral major descopes and redesigns. While it formed in a different political and programmatic\nenvironment, it experienced many of the same funding and work force challenges as the\nConstellation Program did. Consolidation, under the ISS Program in the mid 1990s, alleviated\nsome but not all of the start-up issues.\nMuch of this was in the minds of the Constellation organizers, who believed that the political will\nwould not be sustained through a Freedom-like start-up. Again, we see the perspectives from the\nwork force on this issue:\nProgram office integration engineer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe projects started way ahead of us, so we were always\nin catch-up mode. They had prime contracts on board, so every integration issue we found was\na real headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\nProject office engineer 1: \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to get up and running fast and get our test plans in place. We\nneeded to have some early test successes to keep support for the project. The program office\nadded layers of requirements and reviews . They jus t didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that we were moving and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmake changes without big cost and schedule hits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n3\n\nAn example of this was what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cthrust oscillation\xe2\x80\x9d issue. Integrated analyses\nindicated that unacceptably large thrust oscillations from the Ares I first-stage burn could be transmitted\nthrough the stack to the flight crew in the Orion vehicle during launch. Design changes were implemented\nin the PDR time frame to mechanically dampen the oscillations and sufficiently isolate the crew. We can\nspeculate that earlier identification could have resulted in simpler, lower cost changes.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n12\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nProject office engineer 2: \xe2\x80\x9cThe program was trying to get in our knickers. They wanted to tell us\nhow to design the vehicle. We had a schedule to meet, so this didn\xe2\x80\x99t go down too well.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGround operations engineer: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were at the tail end. Projects made changes and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us.\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the change would impact the ground ops hardware. It cost us big time to make\nlate changes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nProgram control analyst: \xe2\x80\x9cThe project procurements were way ahead of the program, and so\nchanges cost big bucks. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much flexibility with reserve dollars, but every change\nwe processed to integrate the project hardware and software came down to painful cost and\nschedule choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n13\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n3.0 KEY FINDINGS\nGiven the challenges described in Section 2.0, the following is a brief listing of the key findings\ndistilled from the Constellation Program. Explanatory information, as well as further detail, can\nbe found in Section 4.0.\nThe character of these lessons is worth noting. The reader will observe that very few technical\nissues arose that could not be solved in relatively short order; indeed, the most difficult and\nmost persistent challenges involved cost, schedule, communication, and organization. The\nreader will no doubt recognize this pattern from previous large-program lessons learned. While\nthe Agency is renowned for technical prowess, senior managers in flagship programs can be\nfaced with a multitude of nontechnical challenges for which they have far less training or\npreparation. In this respect, lessons learned can be an invaluable source of insight.\n\n3.1\n\nRobust vs. Optimal Planning \xe2\x80\x94 The Only Certainty Is that the Funding Will\nNot Match the Plan\n\nDriving Events\nSection 2.1 describes the context and driving events for the funding and planning challenges\nfaced by the Constellation Program. Constellation found itself in a grounds-up re-plan at least\nannually.\nLessons Learned\nThe reality is that Agency flagship programs like Constellation must be robustly planned (e.g.,\n\xe2\x80\x9celastic\xe2\x80\x9d) vs. optimally planned (\xe2\x80\x9cinelastic\xe2\x80\x9d). Absent a national imperative akin to the race to the\nmoon, funding will not arrive as planned. Flagship programs are highly visible and stand alone in\nthe national-level budget debates. They are not part of a budget portfolio and, therefore, cannot\nlook elsewhere for funding.\nA flagship program will never experience complete alignment of the budget with the plan, either\nin net or in phasing. Consequently, flagship programs should resist the urge to optimally plan\neach budget line item.\nRecommendations\nPlan for Continuing Resolutions CRs for the first quarter of each FY until and unless\nCongressional processes change substantially.\nDecouple programs/projects as much as possible in strategic, programmatic, and technical\naspects.\nProactively determine sensitivities and breakpoints in budgets, and communicate these to\nstakeholders a priori. Establish expectations for funding reductions in advance. This is the best\nhope to influence budget decisions.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n14\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nDevelop scenario(s) to accommodate 5% to 10% funding shortfalls in any given FY. Understand\nthe major drivers to cost and options available (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cknobs to turn\xe2\x80\x9d) when unexpected\nchallenges appear.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.2.4, 4.2.5, 4.5.1, 4.9.4\n\n3.2\n\nSchedule Creep and the Fixed Base \xe2\x80\x94 The Law of Diminishing Returns\n\nDriving Events\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, the Constellation Program dealt with funding cuts primarily with\nschedule slips rather than content reductions (due to NASA Administrator direction). Variable\ncosts are early targets, since they can be deferred (while adding program risk). The fixed-base\ncosts \xe2\x80\x94 both within the Agency and for the contractors \xe2\x80\x94 become proportionally larger, making\nschedule slips less and less effective in addressing cost cuts.\nLessons Learned\nEach schedule slip resulted in longer periods for which Constellation was expected to maintain\nthe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Human Space Flight \xe2\x80\x9cfixed base\xe2\x80\x9d along with the industrial fixed base from its suite\nof acquisitions.

A vicious cycle was established that only grew more severe\nduring the life of the program as more and more time supporting the fixed base was added to\nthe program lifetime. Ultimately, there could be no resolution without addressing content\nreductions.\nRecommendations\nUnderstand the inherent limitations of schedule slippage to resolve funding shortfalls, since\naccrual of the fixed-base portion of the budget erodes the buying power in the out-year funding.\nReduction of program content warrants consideration under these circumstances.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.2.4, 4.2.5\n\n3.3\n\nTailoring and the Design and Construction Standards \xe2\x80\x94 Drinking from a Fire\nHose\n\nDriving Events\nThe involvement of 10 NASA centers (described in Section 2.2.3, Mosaic of NASA\nParticipation), along with the overabundance and overly prescriptive nature of design and\nconstruction standards led to an avalanche of \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d requirements on the Constellation\ncontractors. While Constellation was allowed broad latitude to tailor requirements, tailoring\nrequired rationale and negotiation with the requirement \xe2\x80\x9cholder.\xe2\x80\x9d The sheer number of direct and\nembedded requirements made the task of tailoring intractable.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n15\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe following illustrates the extent of the problem: The Orion prime contract alone levied design\nand construction (D&C) specifications from: 34 NASA standards, 10 Johnson (Space Center)\nProgram Requirement (JPR) documents, 11 JSC technical standards, 3 NASA Program\nDirectives (NPDs), 6 NASA Program Requirements (NPRs), and 11 KSC standards.

The set of\nNASA requirements is often redundant to this.\nLessons Learned\nThe massive quantity of D&C standards defies tailoring for even a large program such as\nConstellation. Major aerospace contractors have sufficient processes such that the NASA D&C\nstandards are of questionable value. This is a major driver of program fixed costs.\nRecommendations\nNASA should assume the burden of \xe2\x80\x9cmeets or exceeds\xe2\x80\x9d evaluations instead of making the\ncontractor prove that it meets NASA requirements. NASA should implement this by establishing\nan experienced team to audit contractor internal processes at the NASA document level. This\nprocess should not burden the contractor with defending the adequacy of each individual\nrequirement. For the most part, the aerospace contractor community is well versed in the\nappropriate manufacturing and safety measures required to develop space hardware. NASA\nshould build on that expertise.\nCurrently, this topic (Affordability/Innovation) is the subject of discussion among the Chief\nEngineer Office, the Chief Health and Medical Office, and Safety and Mission Assurance\n(S&MA) leadership. A team has been tasked with describing a process and timeline for\ntransforming the Agency approach to Technical Authority requirements and standards. This\ninitiative should establish clear criteria for mandatory (\xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d) requirements. It should also\nrevalidate the current Agency requirements base with the goal of significantly reducing the total\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n16\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nnumber. Most requirements should become guidelines or best practices, and should take into\naccount the pros and cons of the DoD experience with reduction of requirements.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.2.4, 4.2.5, 4.2.6\n\n3.4\n\nTailoring Process Simplification \xe2\x80\x94 The Law of Unexpected Consequences\n\nDriving Events\nOne of the many findings of the CAIB was that NASA had institutionalized the waiver and\ndeviation process for requirements such that permanent or semipermanent waivers and\ndeviations to requirements were the accepted norm. The CAIB, as well as other committees and\npanels studying the NASA human space flight culture, questioned the quality and validity of\nrequirements that need permanent waivers or deviations to remain extant. Consequently, the\nneed to establish a waiver or deviation developed an understandable cultural taint in the work\nforce. Training after the Columbia accident reenforced this aversion. Indeed, important NASA\nstakeholders (e.g., Congress, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, members of the public)\nwere keen to maintain visibility on the NASA use of waivers.\nMeanwhile, the Agency did not grapple with the plethora of requirements that drove the practical\nneed for waivers and deviations to requirements. While the Agency approach to requirements\nwas redesigned with the introduction of the independent Technical Authority, the actual number\nand scope of requirements was not addressed.\nThis left the Constellation Program in a quandary. It was allowed broad latitude in tailoring\nrequirements to its needs. However, the Agency decided that the program would use deviations\nand waivers to document tailoring outcomes. Cultural consequences were not evaluated.\nMoreover, the process for permanent deviations and waivers was formalized by the Agency.\nDiscussions of tailoring were driven down to the level at which they were most productive \xe2\x80\x94 to\nthose most familiar with design and implementation; however, waivers and deviations required\nhigher visibility within the Agency to agree on. This cultural inconsistency, coupled with the sheer\nnumber of requirements addressed in the previous lesson, made the tailoring process nearly\ninsurmountable.\nLessons Learned\nWhile the use of waivers and deviations was intended to simplify the tailoring process of\nrequirements for the Constellation Program, cultural consequences were not addressed. This\nhad the unintended consequence of confounding the tailoring process rather than assisting it.\nRecommendations\nTailoring of requirements is necessary and should not carry a cultural stigma. The process\nshould be revised to remedy the negative implication.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.2.3\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n17\n\nConstellation Program\n3.5\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRisk-informed Design \xe2\x80\x94 Risk as a Commodity\n\nDriving Events\nThe broad scope of the Constellation Program permitted some greatly effective experimentation\nin the design process. The traditional aerospace design process (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9crule-based\xe2\x80\x9d approach),\nwherein the vehicle is designed strictly to requirements (and, by implication, all requirements are\nequal or nearly so), was used on most elements. Progress in analytical techniques allowed the\napplication of reliability to supersede redundancy in design, strengthening the use of design for\nminimum risk (DFMR). Two elements used a risk-based approach that resulted in overall better\ndesigns.\nThe Orion vehicle was designed initially using the rule-based approach. In meeting all of the\nrequirements, the vehicle was overly constrained and too heavy, and it also had performance\nchallenges. To \xe2\x80\x9cclose the architecture,\xe2\x80\x9d the project implemented a revised design process that\nprioritized mission-critical, reliability, and safety requirements. A \xe2\x80\x9czero-based\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle was\ndesigned that met only these requirements. All other design features required justification based\non ability to reduce risk, i.e., risk as a commodity, using standard risk assessment tools (e.g.,\nprobabilistic risk assessment, hazard analysis, and failure modes and effects analysis) along\nwith the beneficial use of other design commodities (e.g., power, mass, budget). The ability of\nthe Orion vehicle to minimize LOC (loss of crew) probability, along with meeting of performance\nand mass constraints, was improved through application of this process.\nThe Altair vehicle pioneered a similar approach, uniquely applied a priori. The Risk Informed\nDesign process used an analysis-based approach to design the absolute minimum vehicle\nnecessary to perform the mission and then added design features by proven value in increasing\nvehicle reliability and safety. This resulted in more robust design solutions that either eliminated\nor better controlled hazards.\nLessons Learned\nRisk Informed Design (i.e., treating risk as a commodity in design) was a breakthrough for both\nOrion and Altair, resulting in designs that \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d and were safer and more reliable than a rulebased design approach could yield.\nRecommendations\nA rule-based design approach can remove accountability to understand the implications of\ndesign choices. Employ risk-informed design methodology a priori to focus design on overall\nmission success rather than compliance with \xe2\x80\x9cdesign rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.8.1, A.3\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n18\n\nConstellation Program\n3.6\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nIn-house Tasks \xe2\x80\x94 Sustaining the NASA Institutional Base vs. Affordably\nSupporting the Programs \xe2\x80\x94 Getting from \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDriving Events\nDriving events for this lesson are described in Section 2.2.3 under \xe2\x80\x9cMosaic of NASA\nParticipation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile the Constellation Program attempted to distribute work in logical packages, the competing\nneeds of \xe2\x80\x9c10 Healthy Centers,\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of the program, and phasing considerations (e.g.,\nplacement of work in the post-shuttle era) drove instances of incoherent distribution, resulting in\nmuddling of roles, responsibility, and authority.\nAn example of the Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) development further illustrates the wide\ndistribution of roles and responsibilities. This development was a subsystem of Orion and is not\nan extreme example, but it is typical of the rest of the program. Primary responsibilities were\ndivided as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJSC: Orion project management, lead for crew module and vehicle integration, prime\ncontractor oversight and independent analysis\nMSFC: LAS prime contractor oversight and independent analysis\nLangley Research Center: Lead for LAS integration, prime contractor oversight, and\nindependent analysis\nGlenn Research Center: Flight Test Article and pathfinder production for Service Module\n(SM) and Spacecraft Adapter\nDryden Flight Research Center: Lead for Abort Flight Test integration and operations\n\nWhen everybody is responsible for everything, nobody is responsible for anything.\nFurthermore, the relatively low cost of most in-house tasks can be deceiving. While sometimes\nlow in cost, the price of confused roles, responsibility, and authority (RR&A) can lead to major\nheadaches, and can flow into the contractor infrastructure. These roles are often coupled with\nthe desire for modernization of associated host-center facilities, which can drive larger costs.\nLessons Learned\nTask assignments for in-house work are strategic drivers within the Agency; they are more than\na series of make-buy or in-house vs. contractor decisions. Clear RR&As must be a priority. In\nspite of the relative low cost, the distribution and RR&A for in-house tasks are deserving of\nmanagement focus to avoid confusion and overlapping roles down the line.\nRecommendations\nTarget in-house tasks for items that will mutually benefit programs (e.g., unique expertise) and\ncenters (e.g., institutional sustainment). Due diligence will be needed to achieve this balance of\nbenefit to the program and benefit to the NASA institution. Achieving balance will bring value to\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n19\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nthe program as well as provide strategic support for the NASA institution, equipping the Agency\nto accomplish future programs and missions.\nAffordability, institutional benefit, and coherence of RR&A should be three additional strategic\nconsiderations in these decisions. Or, simply stated, \xe2\x80\x9cMake sure the gain is worth the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: A.5\n\n3.7\n\nRoles, Responsibility, and Authority \xe2\x80\x94 a Non-thermodynamic Application of\nEntropy\n\nDriving Events\nThe clarity of RR&A for the Constellation Program was degraded by the combined effects of the\nwide distribution of program responsibilities via the \xe2\x80\x9c10 Healthy Centers\xe2\x80\x9d policy, multi-decadal\nphasing of program development in IC and LC, and assumption of traditionally understood roles\nfrom the space shuttle heritage component development as described in Section 2.2.\nThe Program undertook a number of steps to improve this, including conducting work force\nsurveys and holding regular management retreats. Perhaps the most successful effort was the\nProgram Excellence Team (PET), which was a council of program deputies who frequently met\nface-to-face and via teleconferencing to work through specific issues related to RR&A.\nLessons Learned\nThere is no formula or checklist for clear RR&A in an Agency-wide, flagship program. The\nspecific approach on organizational structure taken by Constellation in this regard is addressed\nin Appendix A, in the paper on formulation of the program. Projects housed at centers where\nprevious or similar work took or takes place will tend to assume these heritage roles, in spite of\ncontrary direction.\nTwo early test flights provide examples of how strong leadership and meeting imminent\nschedule milestones can drive improvements in RR&A and decision-making. 4 The Ares I-X test\nflight and the Orion Pad Abort-1 test flight were both pathfinders in how to function and succeed\nwithin the broad scope and far-flung Constellation organization. Both were developed as the\nprogram relationships were forming, using distributed teams and hardware developments. While\nthey were initially hampered by the same factors described in this section, these teams were\nable to focus on the most important elements and succeed in meeting all of their test flight\nobjectives.\nRR&A can be improved by functional examination, by either combining like tasks or separating\nfunctions by need. During development of the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), implementation\nwas hindered by the conflicting needs of the product/task providers and the schedule assessment\n\n4\n\nSee also Lesson Learned 4.11 for more benefits of test flights.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n20\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nteam. When these functions were separated, the IMS development quickly gained focus and\nresults improved.\nRisk management was challenged because it was separated functionally from cost threat\nmanagement. When broader aspects of risk (e.g., cost threats, safety, etc.) were included, the\nresults from the system improved. 5\nRR&A for the IC was relatively clear and in daily operation. Roles for the LC, while defined at a\ntop level, were best developed for projects that had \xe2\x80\x9cfollow-on\xe2\x80\x9d content from the IC.\nThe program was also contemplating the roles the International Partners might take. This\nformulation is described in Section 4.9.\nRecommendations\nWhile it is a good start to define RR&A, periodic examination is required for large-scope,\ndistributed programs. Attention to the effects of heritage RR&A and phasing are particularly\nimportant. RR&A should also be planned to adapt to the program phase(s).\nCreating a dedicated team of decision makers (e.g., the council of deputies) to critically review\nand address RR&A can be very effective.\nUse of annual employee surveys provides a helpful metric toward gauging the effectiveness of\nmeasures taken to address RR&A issues.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.1.1, 4.2.6, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, B.1\n\n3.8\n\nDecision Making \xe2\x80\x94 Only as Efficient as Roles, Responsibilities, and\nAuthority Are Clear and Understood\n\nDriving Events\nThe clarity and effectiveness of the decision-making processes for the Constellation Program\nwere driven by the same events as summarized above in Section 3.7 and as described in more\ndetail in Section 2.2.\nThe start-up phasing (late start of the program relative to the projects) previously described also\nconfounded decision making. Projects made unilateral changes without considering integrated\neffects. For example, Ares made changes to the \xe2\x80\x9cstack height\xe2\x80\x9d that impacted the Orion and\nGround Operations designs; Orion deleted a test flight it found unnecessary without understanding\nthe integrated effects. Once the program integration function was operational, decisions were\nbetter coordinated but opportunities for early-phase, lower-cost changes were lost.\n\n5\n\nNB: Risk management systems quickly degrade to \xe2\x80\x9cissues tracking\xe2\x80\x9d unless adequate reserves are\nmaintained to address and retire risks at the appropriate time. Lacking this, risks become accepted de facto.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n21\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe mature decision-making structure affecting Constellation Program decisions is partially\nillustrated in Fig. 4.

In a program of this scope, attempts to\nbalance timely decision making at the appropriate levels, consider strategic and tactical\nviewpoints, and clearly delineate accountability for execution, while keeping all stakeholders\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n22\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\ninformed and included, often left someone dissatisfied. The need to maintain the multi-decadal\nfocus was sometimes misunderstood, particularly in projects with immediate, near-term needs.\nThe need to make decisions regarding NASA center infrastructure that would or would not\nsupport Constellation over time was particularly nettlesome, bringing in communities that seldom\ndealt with program management. These decisions typically necessitated involvement at the\nAgency level and required extra time and staffing. Major infrastructure changes drew interest\nand attention from Congress as well, so it was necessary for many entities outside the program\nto be well informed.\nRecommendations\nA good start is important to define the decision process; however, constant vigilance is required\nfor large-scope, distributed programs. Invest the time and energy to define a comprehensive\ndecision process that includes all affected parties (Technical Authority, center management, and\ncontractors). Impediments will arise by not anticipating key stakeholder interests.\nAttention to the effects of project phasing, particularly for decisions intended to last decades or\naffect center infrastructure, is very important.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.5, 4.4.1, B.1\n\n3.9\n\nOrganization is Organic \xe2\x80\x94 You Will Never Get It Right, But You Can Make It\nBetter\n\nDriving Events\nThe organizational structure for the Constellation Program evolved over time.

Needed adaptation can be anticipated according to schedule\nmilestones; the work force and organization should be focused on achieving the next key\nmilestone, not on continuing to operate in the mode that achieved the last key milestone. Key\nmilestones such as design reviews mark natural breakpoints in organizational strategies, and\nindeed the organizational scheme warrants assessment as part of a key milestone review.\nConsider that as the Constellation Program moved from requirements definition to development,\nthe needed changes were not uniformly recognized, so the organization was slow to adapt after\nthe SDR to prepare for PDR. Rather than preemptively assessing the organizational model, the\nprogram leadership reacted to issues associated with progressing to PDR as these issues\nemerged. The post-PDR organizational adaptation to CDR objectives was accomplished more\nquickly since it was anticipated.\nRecommendations\nRevisit the organization at key milestone reviews to address the changing nature of the work\nahead to achieve the next milestone. This should be documented in a revision of the Program\nPlan and be briefed to senior Agency management at the appropriate milestone briefing.

While countless assessments and prevailing programmatic wisdom\nindicate that a small, centrally located team is the most efficient way to build a complex element,\nConstellation did not have that luxury. This posed many RR&A and decision-making issues, as\ndescribed above (4.7, 4.8, 4.9), as well as integration challenges. Well-understood RR&A and\nclear decision-making processes reduce the communication \xe2\x80\x9coverhead\xe2\x80\x9d for the program team.\nBeyond that, any and all efforts to improve communications and data management (DM) are\nbeneficial. Constellation used the following to enhance communication and DM over and above\nholding regular face-to-face meetings:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA council of project and program deputies, mentioned in 4.7, was formed to resolve issues\nrelated to roles, decision making, and communications. The council was formed in early\n2007 to tackle issues already apparent in RR&A associated with the formation of the\nProgram Office. This council became an informal communication network; members spent\ntime with each other and gained trust by sharing perspectives and working through problems\nof mutual interest.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommunities of Practice\xe2\x80\x9d were formed to foster discussions in particular technical areas\nand to aid information flow.\nInformation technology (IT) tools and applications (teleconferencing, WebEx [Cisco, San\nJose, CA], LifeSize\xc2\xae [LifeSize\xc2\xae Communications Inc., Austin, TX], ICE/Windchill [PTC, Needham,\nMass.], etc.) were extensively used to enhance the flow of information.\nA data-centric (vs. document-centric) approach to program integration was implemented that\nenabled linking of configuration-controlled record-level data and automated integration of\ndata direct from authoritative sources, thus eliminating error-prone manual copying of data.\n\nLessons Learned\nThis thorny issue was a classic case of \xe2\x80\x9cthe devil is in the details.\xe2\x80\x9d Overall RR&As were clear\nenough, as everyone understood the integrating responsibility of the Program Office with\nrespect to constituent projects; however, translation of this overall understanding into day-to-day\npractice was needed to address the real issues that cropped up daily.\nAs such, frequent meetings of the council of deputies were necessary, which gave the informal\nnetwork an ideal opportunity to form. IT tools, including teleconferencing and WebEx, allowed\nmany virtual meetings to be interspersed with face-to-face meetings, thereby greatly increasing\nproductivity of the group. Over time, as the relationships between group members grew stronger\nand the team\xe2\x80\x99s norms of behavior became more ingrained in team members, more and more of\nthe group\xe2\x80\x99s work could be accomplished via these virtual meetings, further increasing\nproductivity.\nThe council of deputies is only one example; integration groups for each of various engineering\ndisciplines also benefitted from the improved IT collaboration tools over the previous generation,\nallowing significant improvements in the utility of virtual team meetings.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n25\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nDue to the late start of the program relative to the start of the projects, incompatible data\nsystems were the norm, so the program had to use a mostly manual approach to integrate data.\nThis often involved use of non-authoritative copies of data, which resulted in decisions being\nmade using out-of-date and inaccurate information (e.g., out-of-date IMS, 40% discrepancy rates\nin risks). Once a program-wide data systems architecture was established, promising results with\ncore data sets were observed, thus reducing discrepancy rates and communication overhead in\nsupport of improved decision making.\nRecommendations\nLarge-scope, geographically dispersed programs can benefit from interpersonal networks\nestablished across organizational boundaries.\nAffordable, state-of-the-art IT tools can facilitate communications across time and space. They\nshould be available as early and as broadly as feasible.\nA large program should be diligent in anticipating the formal and informal networks that will\nemerge or intentionally be formed, and ensure that these networks have access to the IT tools\nthat will enable these networks to work most productively.\nProgram-wide data systems architecture for data integration should be used a priori; and projects\nshould use software tools that enable data integration and interoperability with published\ninterfaces and, where practical, should also use common software tools.\nA data-centric (vs. document-centric) approach for DM should be established at the beginning of\nthe program, with clear and common data requirements between all levels and organizations of\nthe program using formal agreements (e.g., data requirements documents [DRDs]) that include\nrequirements for electronic data.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.1.1, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, A.5, B.2\n\n3.11 Flight Tests \xe2\x80\x93 Learning by Doing\nDriving Events\nThe value of flight tests in program development is undisputed; however, they are inherently\nresource intensive \xe2\x80\x93 which is to say, expensive.

The test provided enough data for partial validation of\nmodels and processes used in the Ares I design, and allowed the test data to improve Ares I\ndesign and development.\nFor the Orion LAS, a series of flight tests was planned to certify safety and performance in the\nmost challenging launch and flight regimes. The first flight test (Pad Abort-1) demonstrated LAS\nperformance and Crew Module landing systems performance in a pad abort scenario. Launched\nin May 2010, Pad Abort-1, the second Constellation flight test, achieved all flight test objectives.\nA primary purpose of the flight, akin to that of Ares I-X, was to acquire flight data early enough\nto influence and impact the design and development of the Orion LAS and Crew Module landing\nand recovery systems. The test provided sufficient data to partially validate models and processes\nused in the Orion design, improving Orion design and development.\nThe Ares I-X and Pad Abort-1 efforts were largely independent activities. As such, comparing\nthe two flight test activities reveals fundamental similarities that may characterize successful flight\ntests and provide insight for future program success.\nLessons Learned\nBoth flight tests were very successful, achieving all flight test objectives and returning a wealth\nof technical data early enough in the development cycle to inform design; however, the key\nlessons learned involved nontechnical returns from the flight tests. In both cases, these complex\nflight tests stressed the needed organizational constructs and drove clarity into RR&A and the\ndecision-making structures. Had these issues been revealed later and addressed nearer to the\nfirst full-system flight (e.g., the planned Orion-1 mission), significant delays and an increased\nrisk posture would have resulted.\nFurthermore, nontraditional approaches can be tried during a flight test, particularly a crewless\nflight test. For instance, Ares I-X employed large structural margins in the mass and dynamics\nsimulators used to emulate the upper-stage and Orion hardware; and it used a \xe2\x80\x9cping-test\xe2\x80\x9d\napproach to determine the dynamic characteristics for guidance of the stack rather than a much\nmore expensive and time-consuming structural ground test of the stack. This approach worked\nvery well and, after its successful demonstration on Ares I-X, the Program was examining the\ncost savings vs. risk of adopting this approach for future flights.\nFinally it is noteworthy that when cancelled, the Program was in the process of revising the\ndevelopment strategy for the IC to rely more heavily on flight tests, thus saving time and budget\nby reducing ground tests in response to the increased confidence in the analytical models and\nsimulations that resulted from Ares I-X and Pad Abort-1 flight tests.\nRecommendations\nPlan a series of flight tests to demonstrate key system capabilities and mitigate major technical\nrisks. Ensure that some of the flight tests occur early enough in the development cycle (i.e., PDR\ntime frame) to return data in time to inform the system design. Flight tests have the additional\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n27\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nbenefit of providing opportunities to test alternative approaches and discover efficiencies for\noverall organizational performance.\nSupporting Lessons Learned from Section 4.0: 4.2.6, 4.7.5, 4.8.1\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n28\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n4.0 DETAILED LESSONS LEARNED\nSection 4.0 comprises the detailed lessons learned.

This should include not\nonly the program and its projects, but also the agency and centers involved. Lack of clarity in\nthis area leads to team tension, inefficient decision making, and wasted efforts. Moreover, as\nprogram objectives change with program maturity (Phases A to E), RR&As should be\nreevaluated and adjusted for relevance to current program milestones and objectives.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n29\n\nConstellation Program\n4.1.1\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nEns ure the Decis ion-making Proces s Is Aligned with Program, Project, and Center\nRoles , Res pons ibilities , and Authority\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.8\nDriving Events\nAs described in Section 2.0 and Key Finding 3.8, the program decision processes were\nperceived as duplicative and sometimes inconsistent. Arguably the most important of the factors\ndescribed in Section 2.2 was the highly constrained budget environment. Budget cuts led to\nrapidly diminishing reserves. This drove the necessity to retain the remaining reserves at the\nprogram level, thus severely restricting decision authority at the project level. Budget cuts drove\nmany revisits to prior decisions in search of remediation. In any decision-making structure, lack\nof reserves to implement risk reduction, changes, or schedule slips to accommodate reduced\nfunding, etc. compromise the ability of a program to make progress (e.g., reevaluating decisions\ndue to changed circumstances).\nFurther, the need to hold reserves at a high level directly subverted the best practice, described\nin 4.1.2, of pushing functions and decisions to the knowledge base (project or lower levels of the\nprogram). Lacking resources, boards can solve problems within their scope but often cannot\nimplement the solutions. Rather, the decision must be pushed up through myriad boards to the\ntop, seeking resolution.\nThe mosaic of NASA participation (Section 2.2.3) and program/project phasing (Section 2.2.6)\nresulted in a similar mosaic (and phasing) of institutional boards and panels, each with their own\nstyle of vetting technical recommendations. These existing institutional processes and procedures\nwere, in some cases, duplicative or contradictory, and were not always clearly linked to program\nprocesses that were subsequently established in an effort to implement standardization.\nAs a result of CAIB recommendations, 7 NASA was in the process of adopting a new\ngovernance structure between the institution (i.e., center engineering and program support),\nTechnical Authorities and the Mission Directorates. Constellation was the first program to adopt\nthis new governance structure. While intended to alleviate instances of safety compromises in\nthe face of extreme budget and/or schedule pressures, the new structure added further\nconfusion to decision making at the working-level. As the first major program to operate under\nthese new rules, Constellation had both the benefit (increased safety) and the difficulty (less\nclarity to decisions) associated with blazing a new trail.\nThese all contributed to inconsistencies, both apparent and real, in management direction.\nWhile projects were under program direction, center boards and the Technical Authority were\nnot under program direction. It became very difficult to converge on a consistent approach once\ndecisions were made by any of these. Further, when an issue arose, there was often confusion\n7\n\nNASA 2003.

The\nvariety of institutional processes and lack of physical collocation only added to the muddled\nsituation.\nWhile the Deputy-led Program Excellence Team (Section 4.1.2) addressed many of the\nprogram-to-project issues, the larger issue of institutional authority vs. program authority was\nnot sufficiently resolved. The frustration at this, which was borne by the working-level engineers\nseeking resolution, was expressed in the bumpy path to PDR.\nFor specific task areas, the program and projects conducted multiple Lean Six Sigma 8 (L6S)\nevents that identified and eliminated thousands of wasted steps. However, much of this \xe2\x80\x9cchurn\xe2\x80\x9d\nmay have been avoided to begin with by establishing a clear program decision-making path with\nbuy-in from all affected institutional organizations.\nLessons Learned\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBoards without resources (budget and reserves) to implement decisions have limited\neffectiveness.\nClear lines of authority among the program, projects, and institutions were addressed at the\nmacro level but were not delineated or communicated well to the working level, resulting in\ntension and inefficiency. The operating model was already in place and was difficult to\nchange.\nThe program and institutional/center processes were not well aligned, resulting in inefficient\ndecision making.\nProgrammatic decisions on facility construction and modification funding (and the legal\nnecessity not to intermix facility funding) were neither fully understood nor articulated at all\nlevels and institutions (see Section 4.6).\nThe need to involve the broadest range of personnel from many centers created a complex\ncommunications environment and resulted in frequent revisits of decisions.\nThe arrangement of having program managers, deputy program managers, and associate\nprogram managers who matrix from different centers enhanced communications,\ndissemination of information, and team building.\nThe concept of the associate program manager (APM) at the centers to facilitate\ncommunication between the program and the center was good, but the role of the APM was\nin some cases unclear and confusing with regard to the projects at that center.\nCommunities of Practice (Section 4.1.5) were effective at bridging some of the complexities\ncreated by the multiple decision-approval chains.\n\nL6S is an industry standard approach that combines the statistical analysis of Six Sigma to improve\nquality with the tools and methods of the Lean methodology, which evaluates processes with a focus on\nspeed and efficiency.\n\n8\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n31\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRecommendations\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, maintain a budget that includes enough reserves for boards to\nimplement necessary decisions.\nCreate a Control Board flow diagram that documents control board, panel, and working group\n(WG) relationships and hierarchy.

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities need to be\nexplicitly defined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\nThe roles of program-level Technical Authorities and the technical review process must be\nclearly established and understood by the program, projects, and institutions. As with the\ntechnical side of the institution, make the administrative functions (e.g., financial organizations)\nanswerable to the program into which they provide matrix support.\nUse methods such as L6S to regularly review processes and organizational structure for\nduplication and waste.\n4.1.2\n\nEs tablis h a Cros s -level Senior Managem ent Team to Clarify and Im prove Roles and\nRes pons ibilities\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.7, 3.10\nDriving Events\nA \xe2\x80\x9cbest-practice\xe2\x80\x9d embraced by the Constellation Program was to push functions and decisions\nto the lowest possible organizational level, since that is where knowledge resides. This included\npushing some roles down to the projects that traditionally had been held at the program level.\nThe desire to implement this best practice led to challenges in RR&A that were exacerbated by\nthe program environment.\nAs described in Section 2.0, the major projects were established prior to the Program; hence,\neach entity had its own integration organization, structure, and processes developed independently\nof the other. The far-flung organization, funding pressures, generation gap in human space\nflight, and size of the trade-space described in Section 2.0 also contributed to the magnitude of\nthese driving events.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n32\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nLessons Learned\nIn an effort to identify and address areas of tension or inefficiency in RR&A, the Constellation\nProgram chartered the PET to focus on areas for improvement. The PET was a council of\ndeputies, with membership drawn from the program office and project deputies, as well as the\nProgram Chief Engineer (a matrix position from the Technical Authority). This senior leadership\nteam had the latitude to clarify, delete, or modify RR&A and associated processes to achieve\nbetter internal operations. Examples of functional areas discussed included Program and project\nroles and responsibilities for design integration, interface requirements, design and construction\nstandards, schedule management, and vehicle stack integration.\nAn example was the delegation of vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cstack integration\xe2\x80\x9d to the Ares project. This is\ntraditionally a program-level role; however, the bulk of the expertise required to perform the\nanalysis resided in the project and delegation eliminated some duplicative efforts. The PET was\ntasked with clarifying RR&A that had arisen over the performance of the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional role\xe2\x80\x9d vs. the\n\xe2\x80\x9cnew role\xe2\x80\x9d in stack integration. After clarifying these roles, the PET oversaw implementation so\nthat the task could proceed more efficiently.\nThe team met primarily through off-site face-to-face meetings, which proved critical to enabling\ndiscussion of difficult and sensitive topics. Thorough and frank discussions resulted in more\nclarity and improved RR&A, which were documented and disseminated across the program in\nagreements. Documentation of agreements was instrumental in forming a better integration\neffort across the various levels of the program.\nTo quantify the degree of success in the implementation of these agreements, the program\nused the 4-D survey system\xc2\xa9 (\xc2\xa92010: 4-D Imaging Systems Inc., Oak Ridge, TN) to measure\nvertical and horizontal team satisfaction in recognized areas for improvement on an annual\nbasis. These progress reports were published program-wide. The surveys indicated that the\nRR&A areas that had received management attention improved over time. As the program\nmatured, the surveys provided new areas in RR&A that needed attention. While the PET was\ninitially formed as an ad hoc group, it became the resident forum for RR&A improvements.\nAn added, and extremely important, benefit is that the personal bonds established in this team\ncreated a strong sense of trust and teamwork among the members; these relationships later\nenabled the rapid solution of many problems beyond the PET charter.\nRecommendations\nA senior-level management team, spanning projects, program, and institutions, is a key element\nto clarify and improve roles and responsibilities. It should be established from the start of a\nmulti-element human space flight program. This team should meet face-to-face on a regular\nbasis throughout the life cycle of the program and use a quantifiable process to measure success\nand identify areas for improvement.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n33\n\nConstellation Program\n4.1.3\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nBalance Decis ion Making with the Obligation to Air Dis s enting Opinions\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.8\nDriving Events\nWhile decision making was addressed in the prior recommendation, another aspect is worthy of\nfurther discussion due to its cultural implications. A finding of the CAIB report (footnote 7) was\nthat NASA culture inhibited frank discussion of dissenting technical opinions. Indeed, this was\nattributed as one cause of the Columbia accident. As a result, the management and work force,\nparticularly at the space flight centers, were robustly trained to allay this cultural inhibition.\nPerceptions in the work force indicated that the program was not entirely successful in finding a\nbalance between decision making (as manifest in progress) and the need to find consensus and\nair dissenting opinions.\nProgram management was diligent in seeking consensus to assure that all valid stakeholder\nneeds, opinions, and relevant factors were considered in making decisions. The continuously\nshifting budget situation drove priority changes that, in turn, caused decisions to be reopened.\nSome working-level personnel perceived this as a management weakness, an inability to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\ndecisions stick,\xe2\x80\x9d and as kowtowing to dissention. What looked like dithering at the working level\nwas, in fact, diligence in identifying cost impacts and seeking cost avoidance for otherwise\nmeritorious or technically necessary changes.\nOther factors contributed to this perception, including the program/project phasing (Section\n2.2.6), the generation gap in human space flight (Section 2.2.4), and the size of the trade space\n(Section 2.2.5) in an early-development program. And, for a leadership team most focussed on\nsocialization of major decisions with Agency mangagement, insufficient attention to this perception\nled to frustration at the working level.\nOne example was the Integrated Stack Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM), at which the\nProgram sought to synchronize technical baseline requirements for all of the projects involved in\nthe Ares I launch vehicle \xe2\x80\x9cstack.\xe2\x80\x9d The event was intended to include all relevant decision makers\nin a 2-week, face-to-face period to allow necessary coordination. The outcome was intended as\nan update to the Constellation Architecture Requirements Document (CARD). While many hard\ndecisions were made and implemented into requirements changes as a result of the TIM, the\nformal closure of some of these decisions dragged out over a much longer period of time as\nadditional cost or technical issues arose. While this can be attributed to many of the reasons\nelaborated in Section 4.1.2, the perception of weak leadership, a \xe2\x80\x9cback-door\xe2\x80\x9d appeals route, and\nlack of accountability was only reinforced.\nOn the other hand, Section 3.11 addressed the successful Ares I-X test flight. That organization\nwas permitted, indeed supported, to operate with somewhat autonomous authority and was able\nto ignore many of the drivers described in Section 2.2 due to its ambitious requirements and\ntight schedule constraints. The flight test leadership stressed the needed organizational constructs\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n34\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nand drove clarity into RR&A and the decision-making structure. Many of these were passed on\nand implemented into the larger program.\nLessons Learned\nDissenting opinion plays a critical role in any healthy organization. A thorough, thoughtful, and\nwell-understood process must be used for raising, addressing, and resolving dissenting opinions.\nOtherwise, anyone with a strong opinion can bring progress to a halt.\nProgram management needs be diligent in socializing decisions not only to Agency management\nbut also to the working level, particularly in early program stages when the trade space is most\nbroad and decisions are often revisited. Accountability, and the perception of such, is critical to\nmorale at the working level.\nRecommendations\nEstablish, communicate, and enforce the open decision-making model and process, including\nthe airing of dissenting opinions. Assure \xe2\x80\x9cbuy-in\xe2\x80\x9d of decisions not only at the Agency level, but\nalso the working level. Do not permit \xe2\x80\x9cback-door\xe2\x80\x9d appeals as these engender mistrust and\nfrustration.\n4.1.4\n\nIm plem ent Com munities of Practice to Res olve Integrated Is s ues\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.8, 3.9\nDriving Events\nSystem Integration Groups (SIGs) were initially established to define and allocate requirements\namong projects. They were intended to actively include subject matter experts (SMEs) from the\nprojects and contractors, while being led out of the program office. However, due to the pace of\nthe formulation activities, program (Level 2) and project (Level 3) personnel focused on their own\nlevel of products, so the vertical integration of the team never completely gelled. In addition, the\nrole of SIGs with respect to program oversight was not clearly defined or communicated. 9 This\nresulted in tension between the project-level system leads and the program SIGs over roles and\nresponsibilities, and was a recurring topic at PET meetings.\nConflict around SIG vs. project subsystem lead roles continued until the Program matured, after\nwhich significant integrated issues arose that had multiple program, project, and institutional\nstakeholders. These issues required program and project personnel to work better together to\nfind solutions. The Program performed a \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d by transforming SIGs into communities of\npractice (CoP), which were defined as groups of technical discipline experts from program,\n9\n\nFormer ISS personnel, who had oversight authority in that program, staffed many of the SIGs. However,\nConstellation emphasized pushing authority down to the projects (4.1.1). This change in culture was neither\nimmediately recognized by Program management nor made clear in articulation of RR&A between the\nProgram and the projects.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n35\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nproject, and institutional engineering organizations that serve as the authoritative resource for\nresolving technical integration issues within a specific area of responsibility (e.g., electrical\npower). These CoPs were directly consulted in technical discussions and decisions made by the\nnew Constellation System Integration Panel (CxSIP) the focus of which was to provide technical\nintegration decisions and recommendations for the Program.\nSome examples of integrated issues that were addressed include: launch tower clearance,\nthrust oscillation, power quality specifications, launch probability, and Human System Integration\nRequirements interpretations.\nLessons Learned\nCommunities of Practice proved effective at resolving cross-cutting integrated issues. They\nhelped improve communication within the program/project organization and between centers.\nThe three primary lessons learned in relation to CoPs are identified below.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThey were effective at solving hard problems. Consolidation of program and project\ntechnical positions was enabled. Stakeholder buy-in was enhanced since recognized\nexperts in each area were able to achieve integrated solutions.\nThey fostered collaboration of the best expertise from across the Agency, industry, and\nacademia. This enabled resolution of complicated technical issues and advanced the\nvolume of knowledge in some disciplines.\nInfluence leadership was key to overcoming organizational boundary concerns. CoPs\nworked better through leadership facilitation than direction. This allowed flexibility to resolve\nissues at the most appropriate point, which could be a program board, a project panel, or an\nother integration forum.\n\nRecommendations\nCommunities of Practice should be implemented early with the focus of facilitating integrated\nissue resolution. Although the pace of formulating a program or a project will encourage\norganizations to withdraw to focus on their own highest priorities, management and processes\nshould be put in place to incentivize cross-level discussion and decision. Attention should be\ngiven to leadership, which is key in determining whether the CoP approach will work within a\nparticular discipline. Specifically, influence leadership is a must, and facilitation rather than\ndirection is needed to allow flexibility. Roles and responsibilities among WGs, panels, and the\nCoPs should be defined. Management should consistently engage the CoPs directly when\nsolving problems and seek their input when making decisions.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n36\n\nConstellation Program\n4.1.5\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nIm plem ent a Strong Technical Integration Function\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.8, 3.9\nDriving Events\nDriving events are the same circumstances described in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.3; however,\naspects of leadership merit a separate discussion. In a program of such breadth, leadership\nmay be strong in some areas and not in others.\nLessons Learned\nPushing traditional program integration roles (Section 4.1.1) to the lowest feasible technical level,\ncoupled with elevating all meager funding reserves to the program level, created significant\nstressors to the RR&A in resolving technical issues. (Section 4.1.2 describes the forces that\ndrove all reserves to be managed by the program manager rather than at lower levels.)\nCommunities of Practice (see Section 4.1.4) helped, but could not resolve, the fundamental lack\nof integrated technical leadership.\nThe Standing Review Board (SRB), which was charged with oversight of the program, found that\nthe program was deficient in technical integration and recommended that a Technical Deputy be\nappointed to alleviate this issue. Program management was evaluating the implementation of\nthis recommendation at the time of Program cancellation.\nThe cultural implications of this are partially addressed in Section 2.2.5. A strong and prevalent\nbelief resided at the working level that program leadership was consumed with political, budget,\nand schedule issues, and that insufficient attention was applied to the many technical\nintegration issues. Moreover, no one was delegated the authority to clear the backlog of\ntechnical decisions that lingered. A yearning for leadership, particularly in the program (Level 2)\nintegration function, was a prevalent theme around the water coolers.\nThe Program took steps in strengthening technical integration by refocusing the SE&I office\ntoward design integration, and creating a CxSIP that served as a clearinghouse for key\nintegration issues.\nAs noted in Key Finding 3.9, it is critical for an organization to recognize its weaknesses and\nadapt as its functions change over the life cycle of the program. Once these changes occur, it is\njust as critical to fully communicate to the working level why these changes have been made.\nRecommendations\nIn a program of the size and scope of Constellation, authority, responsibility, and accountability\nshould be delegated to a clearly defined technical integration function to assist the program\nmanager in efficient resolution of technical issues. It is best to consolidate this responsibility\nearlier, rather than later, to avoid morale issues related to inattentive leadership.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n37\n\nConstellation Program\n4.2\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRequirements\n\nA long-term trend in the aerospace industry has been the proliferation of requirements and\nspecifications. The forcing function for this has been attributed to the well-intentioned desire to\n\xe2\x80\x9cregulate\xe2\x80\x9d good behavior and practices. Failures involving loss of life and loss of mission (LOM)\nunderstandably drive care and detail into specifications. NASA has been no exception to this\ntrend.\nAs noted in Section 2.2.3, the different cultures that have developed at each NASA center have\ndriven 10 different sets and approaches to D&C standards and specifications. Although the\nAgency has been systematically trying to establish Agency-wide D&C standards, there are still a\nmultitude of center-specific standards in practice. The collective effect on the contract\nenvironment (and cost) is illustrated in the lessons in this section.\nNotably, this effect drives the size and scope of the contractor work force. Each requirement in\neach standard and each specification must be verified. 10 This task comprises a large part of the\nfixed-base costs, addressed in Key Finding 3.2 that can greatly hinder the flexibility of a program\nto respond to changing circumstances.\nRecommendations in this section call for a balanced, measured approach in application of\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d statements to contracts.\n4.2.1\n\nReduce Agency Requirem ents Levied on Contractors\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\nDriving Events\nThe procedural and policy directives (NPRs and NPDs) for the Agency contain tens of thousands\nof programmatic requirements and standards. While many Agency requirements properly\naddress the outcomes sought (\xe2\x80\x9cwhat to do\xe2\x80\x9d), the vast majority attempt to incorporate and\nstandardize best practices (\xe2\x80\x9chow to do\xe2\x80\x9d) to maximize the likelihood of achieving those outcomes.\nEach NASA center layers its own set of requirements and standards on the set that exists for\nthe Agency, as described in Section 2.2.3.\nThese requirements drive cost in large ways. Contractors must verify every requirement, and\nthe program must ensure that every requirement is auditable. NASA represents a small portion\nof the overall contracted effort for most aerospace contractors. DoD, which typically represents\nthe largest source of work, maintains its own set of standards and specifications, most of which\nare duplicative of NASA standards and specifications. There are costs associated with retraining\nportions of a contractor work force to use a different process for the relatively small portion of\nNASA work. Risks of errors are introduced because of switching processes for similar tasks\n\n10\n\nA requirement is an individual \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d statement within a document that may contain hundreds of individual\n\xe2\x80\x9cshalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n38\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nbetween contracts. This drives costs up and lowers safety. Costs are associated with\ndocumenting a requirement and assessing the impact of a potential requirement. Finally,\npotentially hundreds of labor-hours of debate are spent just to tailor a single requirement. 11\nConfusion ensues when the contractors are expected to sort through and understand the\ndiffering NASA requirements among NASA centers.\nDesign and construction standards were the greatest challenge due to their sheer number and\nscope at the designer level. Over prescription is very costly and time consuming because it\nseverely limits the ability of the designer to balance risks, and often results in suboptimal\noutcomes for the intended system.\nOne example would be standards for lifting hardware. Each NASA center has a standard for\nthis, and the various standards are not identical. This necessitates a contractor dealing with\nmultiple centers to, depending on the locale, know, understand, train, and staff to implement\nmultiple ways of lifting hardware. This approach increases both risk and cost.\nSince D&C standards are usually written by the functional discipline experts, it is only natural for\nthem to set standards that minimize risks in their particular area. But, sometimes adherence to\nthese drive unwise system design decisions that actually increase risk overall and lead to a\ngenerally poorer design. It can also drain resources from the project to do the \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d design\nrather than the \xe2\x80\x9cgood-enough\xe2\x80\x9d design. Many of the design and construction standards are also\nwritten to cover a wide array of products and do not necessarily fit any one product well.\nIt is important to acknowledge that experienced contractors are also motivated to apply best\npractices and document them as corporate processes, if they do not already use Voluntary\nConsensus Standards.\nThe NASA Administrator stated that for Constellation, \xe2\x80\x9call requirements need to fight their way\non to the table.\xe2\x80\x9d Agency senior leadership embraced this approach (the Office of Chief Engineer\n[OCE] and Office of Safety and Mission Assurance [OSMA] in particular). However, reality\nproved to be that Constellation had to fight the working-level \xe2\x80\x9crequirement holders\xe2\x80\x9d over each\nrequirement, and the burden was on the Program to document agreements regarding\napplicability and tailoring. On program cancellation, the number and scope of Agency NPRs and\nNPDs had not decreased. 12 Constellation did negotiate dramatic reductions in the number of\napplicable requirements and tailored the remaining documents into significantly fewer requirements.\n\n11\n\nWhile the projects were allowed to do substantial project-specific tailoring, the process was time\nconsuming and costly. It was not uncommon to have running dialogues of weeks to months for the\napplicability or meets/exceeds evaluation of a single requirement within a document containing hundreds\nof requirements. Often this was outside of the purview of the project manager, since the requirement\n\xe2\x80\x9cowners\xe2\x80\x9d or institutional representatives would defend the need for the requirement. In some cases,\nresolution had to take place at senior management levels.\n12\nAs of this writing, focus has been renewed at the Agency level to dramatically decrease the number of\nrequirements within NPR 7120.5\xe2\x80\x94a major parent document for programs and projects. The authors hope\nthis renewed focus is managed to a successful conclusion and is promulgated to other Agency documents.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n39\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nWhile this was a great help, the numbers were still too high.

However, after the scope of the program was reduced, the Program\nwas slow to reassess and reduce the scope of the requirements.\nThe program team bore the scars of the Columbia accident and lengthy ISS development\nand integration. Team members needed to avoid the mistakes that had cost so much.\nThe Program was driven to reduce life-cycle cost. From a life-cycle cost perspective, having\nstandard processes and requirements span across multiple systems seemed to be the most\neffective approach.\nThere were perceived deficiencies in existing standards such as MIL-STD-1540 when\napplied to human-rated elements intended to operate reliably for decades with minimal\nlogistical support capacity.\n\nThe Program was also guilty of writing requirements where guidelines or other less-prescriptive\ncommunication would have provided more flexibility. Although it was recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cone size\ndoes not fit all\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to requirements, it was believed that through simple tailoring and\nallocating processes, the burden of requirements would be minimal. This proved to be incorrect.\nAn additional contributing factor was the use of requirements to define \xe2\x80\x9cdesign solutions\xe2\x80\x9d well\nabove the designer level. Unfortunately, this practice began with ESAS and was evident all the\nway up to Level 0 (at NASA HQ).\nThe program, in particular SE&I and T&E, were in catch-up mode (see Sections 2.2.6 and\n2.2.7), having started late with respect to the projects and their associated contracts. SE&I\nstaffed up very quickly and began pumping out requirements and plans at rapid pace. Although\nprogram-level boards attempted to keep the number of requirements to a minimum, individuals\nand institutions applied continual pressure to add more requirements to address perceived\ndeficiencies or noncompliances.\nThere were, however, attempts to reduce the number of requirements and their cost impacts.\nOne example was the successful Safety, Reliability, & Quality Assurance Requirements Technical\nForum. All projects were requested to work with their contractors to identify candidate requirements\nhaving significant cost or that were not enhancing mission assurance. Because the program had\nseen that many of the cost impacts were driven by misinterpretation of requirements, the projects/\nprimes also provided their understanding of the intent of a costly requirement. Over 3 days, with\nthe participation of 90 empowered project and contractor staff, the team deleted 43 requirements,\nreduced the scope of 52 requirements, and modified 56 requirements to provide more clarity or\nflexibility in implementation. Program representatives also emphasized a willingness to engage\nin further tailoring and project representatives left with a better understanding of previously\nmisinterpreted requirements.\nLessons Learned\nEven programs committed to ensuring the implementation of a small, cost-effective requirement\nbase can end up with much more than expected.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n41\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nA repeated theme in debates on requirements revolved around the competing needs of\nminimizing life-cycle cost (particularly the need for operability) vs. near-term cost impacts in an\never-dwindling budget situation. Programs should carefully evaluate whether \xe2\x80\x9cconsistency\nacross the program\xe2\x80\x9d is necessary, and target for such consistency where it brings true value.\nRecommendations\nChallenge all self-generated program-level requirements to provide lower-level implementers as\nmuch flexibility as possible. Do this early and more than once, particularly in de-scope situations.\n4.2.3\n\nSeparate Tailoring of Requirem ents from the Waiver/Deviation Proces s\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.4\nDriving Events\nWith the advent of Constellation, the Agency OCE revised the Agency tailoring process. This\nactivity occurred in parallel with Constellation requirements development, creating confusion\nwithin the work force. Notably, this even included definition of terms.\nAs explained in Key Finding 3.4, unintended consequences arose when Constellation applied\nthe Agency requirements tailoring process.\nWithin the DoD (the U.S. Air Force in particular), the acquisition community has long had proven\nconfiguration management (CM) processes for the application of deviations and waivers that\ncould be traced to MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-973, and MIL-HDBK-61. These are used primarily for\nnoncompliances during production and delivery. Likewise, tailoring was a separate CM process\nthat was selectively used within the acquisition community, mainly in the early stages of program\nstart-up, i.e., Phases A and B. Any higher-level document (i.e., MIL-STD, MIL-SPEC, etc.) that\nwas authorized for tailoring could be tailored by a program in part or entirety. The document\nowner is always consulted if the document is tailored. If the entire document is tailored, the\ntailored version is \xe2\x80\x9cowned\xe2\x80\x9d by the organization and typically given a unique identifier that\nassociates the document to an organization or a program. Deviations and waivers are given the\nproper attention and scrutiny with the approval level limited to the program director in his/her\nrole as chairperson of the configuration control board. Approval of deviations/waivers is not\ndelegated to lower-level boards/panels. Deviations/waivers are tracked and maintained until they\nare closed. No \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent\xe2\x80\x9d deviations/waivers are allowed. Furthermore, the traditional definitions\nof deviations and waivers and tailoring are used as follows:\nDeviation \xe2\x80\x93 A specific written authorization, granted prior to the manufacture of an item to depart\nfrom a particular requirement(s) of the current approved configuration documentation of an item\nfor a specific number of units or a specified period of time.\nWaiver \xe2\x80\x93 A written authorization to accept an item that, during manufacture or after having been\nsubmitted for government inspection or acceptance, is found to depart from specified\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n42\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nrequirements but nevertheless is considered suitable for use \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d or after repair by an\napproved method.\nTailoring \xe2\x80\x93 The process used to adjust or seek relief from a proscribed requirement to\naccommodate the needs of a specific task or activity (i.e., program or project specific).\nNASA, in an attempt to standardize the tailoring concept across all centers, decided to use\ndeviation/waiver definitions, processes, and documentation to tailor outcomes. This brought\nseveral unintended consequences that made tailoring problematic. These included: formalizing\nthe concept of permanent deviations or waivers, the use of waiver documents for tailoring, and\ndealing with the cultural aversion to waivers explained in Section 3.4. In addition, the program\ndesire to delegate tailoring to the lowest level (where the knowledge resides) conflicted with the\nhigher-level visibility required for a waiver.\nLessons Learned\nSome may argue that NASA can make the work force more comfortable with the fact that\nwaivers are only form of paperwork to ensure proper documentation. However, the cultural taint\nis not only a NASA-internal problem. Outside stakeholders (Congress, the Aerospace Advisory\nPanel [ASAP], National Academies, etc.) have preconceptions about the waiver process.\nRepeated reviews with ASAP can attest to that fact. Processing waiver paperwork unnecessarily\ncomplicates tailoring. And, as seen in the two prior lessons, the amount of tailoring required is\nmassive for a program akin to Constellation. This is also a large driver of fixed costs in the\ncontractor base.\nRecommendations\nReduce the cost of the requirements tailoring process by returning the definitions of deviations\nand waivers to their traditional role (akin to the DoD process) of temporarily dealing with\nnonconformances during production.\nTailoring should not carry a cultural stigma. Allow tailoring to be documented by the simplest\nmethod possible.\n4.2.4\n\nReduce Cos t by Maximizing the Us e of Indus try Standards\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3\nDriving Events\nThe Constellation Program, supported by the Technical Authorities, went to great effort to\nevaluate contractor (industry) standards. It is important to recognize that experienced\ncontractors are also interested in applying best practices. They document them as corporate\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n43\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nprocesses, if they do not already use Voluntary Consensus Standards (VCS). While NASA has\nembraced the use of VCS, 13 the Agency has been slow in its implementation of these standards.\nAs noted earlier, major contracts were competed prior to program office formation, so the\nopportunity to perform program-wide analysis of appropriate standards was missed.\nLessons Learned\nContractor-based standards that are compliant with VCS were found to be mostly consistent\nwith Agency standards. The exceptions that were not already fully compliant could be easily\nassessed at lower cost to programs and NASA.\nRecommendations\nNASA should maximize the use of contractor standards deemed \xe2\x80\x9cgood enough\xe2\x80\x9d by Agency\ntechnical experts and only levy specific requirements to fill significant gaps. This would be best\ndone on an Agency-wide basis to minimize impact on new programs. However, until this is done,\nprograms and projects should consider performing this assessment before contracts are let.\n4.2.5\n\nUs e Indus try Standards for Data Managem ent\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3\nDriving Events\nAkin to the prior recommendation (4.2.4), this recommendation specifically addresses DM\nstandards. Many of the data systems at the projects and within program integration offices were\nchosen prior to Constellation start and before the Program had identified requirements for data\ninteroperability. A data system always requires some cost for interoperability, and the variables\nfor that cost depend heavily on standardization. Most data systems used by the projects and\nprogram offices did not support or adhere to industry standards for data interoperability (e.g.,\nWeb services); and since many of them were closed-source systems, it was both difficult and\nexpensive for the Program to achieve its DM goals. In addition, the Program spent significant\neffort developing various new standards rather than using existing industry standards or working\nwith appropriate governing bodies to evolve those standards (if needed).\n\n13\n\nThe OMB Circular requires that agencies report their use of standards on either a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d or a\n\xe2\x80\x9ctransactional\xe2\x80\x9d basis. Those agencies that report on a categorical basis are not required to list each\ninstance in which a government-unique standard is used in lieu of a private-sector standard in procurement\nactions. However, such agencies are required to have a system in place to ensure that governmentunique standards are developed only when suitable private-sector standards are unavailable for use. At\npresent, only the DoD and NASA consistently report on a categorical basis. For all agencies, in those\ncases in which government-unique standards are required because private-sector standards do not exist,\nuse of the government-unique standard is not subject to reporting.

These standards should be made explicit, and\nnamed as dependencies with the purchase or development of systems and services supporting\nagency data. Furthermore, contracts and MOUs should be used to enable the adoption of\nspecific criteria.\nProgram standards (including data interoperability) should be based on industry standards (e.g.,\nAmerican National Standards Institute, International Organization for Standardization [ISO],\nWorld Wide Web Consortium, and Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information).\nThese rules for DM operations should be mapped to project or center standards, and levied on\nNASA projects and contractors as early as possible in the life cycle of a program.\nProcurement of data systems should take into account the ability of those systems to support\nthe standards or to be modified by NASA to become compliant. Deviation from program\nstandards should be addressed via a named governing board in charge of waivers, enforcement,\nand data architecture. It is also essential that data systems reflect an architectural framework\nrather than defining one. An enterprise framework for data or data systems is necessary for\nglobal adoption, governance, and standardization across the agency to reduce costs, improve\nintegration efficiencies, and provide effective traceability.\n4.2.6\n\nAnchor Integration Verification Requirements\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.3, 3.7, 3.11\nDriving Events\nAs described in Section 2.2.6, the phasing of Program start behind the project starts led to many\nout-of-phase functions. One out-of-phase function was the development of system integration\nverification requirements prior to the establishment of certification criteria. This resulted in\nverification requirements that were not properly anchored to the performance and mission\ncertifications. Another result was the integrated test and evaluation needs for certification, above\nand beyond requirements compliance verification, were not well understood across the\nstakeholder community.\nVerification is the work done to create sufficient evidence to determine that, on delivery, the\nsystem will meet specified performance requirements and include required capabilities that will\naccomplish the design reference mission (DRM) in all applicable natural and induced\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n45\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nenvironments. Verification should, but frequently does not, include the work necessary to validate\nthat component procurements, acceptance testing, manufacturing process controls, and\nassembly checkout will consistently deliver flaw-free products.\nNevertheless, verification work alone does not produce sufficient evidence to certify the system\nbecause it does not include all of the work necessary to validate that the behavior of the system\nis sufficiently well described and understood, that well-understood operating rules and procedures\ncan accomplish operational missions within design constraints, and that the system is suitable\nfor its intended purpose. Verification is a one-time-only \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot\xe2\x80\x9d of requirements compliance,\nwhile certification is the living, sustained, \xe2\x80\x9cas-certified baseline\xe2\x80\x9d definition of what the system is\nand what its capabilities and constraints are. The organization responsible for \xe2\x80\x9csustainment\xe2\x80\x9d\nsustains the system certification, of which verification data make up only a historical portion.\nLessons Learned\nThe lack of a strong relationship between the verification requirements and the certification\ncriteria did not allow for effective assessment of impacts resulting from reductions of verification\nevents. Verification events, such as flight and ground test, were reduced without consistently\nassessing the impacts against baseline certification criteria, which resulted in increased risk\npostures. These reductions in test events were typically driven by cost and schedule constraints.\nRR&A were not well defined. As a result, the T&E integration effort was less than effective. The\nappropriate, integration-level verification products were being developed, but products needed\nfor interface and integration T&E were out of sync with the various project production schedules\n(likely resulting in cost and schedule impacts).\nIntegration-level verification needs were not identified and communicated in time to negotiate\nand acquire the deliverables necessary to support integration T&E events. The program and\nprojects were not in sync with regard to integration software, analyses, and simulator delivery\ndates; and the integration effort required to resolve known disconnects across the independent\nplanning for each of the stakeholders was not completed prior to the PDR.\nRecommendations\nDefine the human-rating integration performance and mission certifications early in the program\nto influence development of integrated system verification requirements. Integration certification\nand verification deliverables should be defined no later than the PDR to effectively negotiate\nwith multiple stakeholders. Example integration deliverables include: models, analyses, software\nloads, simulators, facility assets to support integrated testing, and stakeholder verification test\nresults required to update integrated models and analyses.\nDecision makers must take corrective action when the satisfaction of verification requirements is\nthe sole or overriding consideration when building and implementing the T&E campaign. This\nfrequently happens for two reasons. First, the understanding that verification is only a subset of\na necessary and sufficient T&E campaign is not widely held; in other words, too few people fully\nunderstand and appreciate the difference between verification and certification. Second,\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n46\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nverification is a contract artifact, and \xe2\x80\x9cclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of specifications \xe2\x80\x9cchecks a box\xe2\x80\x9d for contract\nStatement of Work (SOW) closure, therefore management frequently emphasizes that T&E\nwork must be linked to a driving requirement \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes even making policy or building\nprocesses that allow only work that can be linked to specification closure, considering any other\nT&E work to be \xe2\x80\x9cout of scope.\xe2\x80\x9d Similarly, tracking only closure of specified requirement \xe2\x80\x9cshalls\xe2\x80\x9d,\nas opposed to tracking the completion of all the T&E campaign work requirements can result in\nunbalanced emphasis on verification over other certification work.\n\n4.3\n\nData Management\n\nThis section addresses DM and data systems for managing, defining, building, and operating\nlarge space systems. Proactive and systematic DM is key to enabling review and management\nof the overall integrated vehicle and program (e.g., integrate authoritative requirements with\ncomputer-aided design [CAD] models with Parts List with Problem Reports), mitigating risks and\nreducing costs associated with DM.\nLack of data integration leads to cost and risk increases due to use of non-authoritative/out-ofdate data, miscommunication of data, and missing data. Key to DM is the use of a data-centric\napproach, as distinct from a document-centric approach, that involves managing electronic data\neffectively for data consistency and integration with: 1) structured format (e.g., XML [extensible\nmarkup language] or database) accessible at the field level (e.g., specific shall statements, not\nthe whole requirements document); 2) searchable form (e.g., full text and field/value-based\nqueries); and 3) linkable format that requires a unique identifier and machine/programmatic\naccessibility from external systems.\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.5, many data systems were chosen by the projects and program\noffices prior to Constellation start and/or before the Program had identified requirements for\ndata interoperability. In many cases, these data systems did not support or adhere to industry\nstandards for data interoperability.\nIn addition to the recommendations in this section, the reader will note that lack of DM drove\nproblems in other systems, such as the IMS (Section 4.4), EVM (Section 4.5), and risk\nmanagement (RM) (Section 4.8).\n4.3.1\n\nUs e a Program-wide Data Sys tem s Architecture\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.10\nDriving Events\nThe Program did not have a data system architecture deployed across all of the projects to\nsupport integrated DM at its inception. For example, no support was given to link authoritative\ndata sets such as: Requirements (component must sustain X impact), CAD models (component\nmodel), Parts List (components and subcomponents), and Problems (specific problem with\ncomponent).\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n47\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nProjects and centers used a diverse mix of existing and new data systems with diversity of data\nformats (as described in Section 4.2.5), and limited or no support for interoperability. As a result,\nthe Program used a manual approach for data integration that resulted in decisions being made\nusing out-of-date and sometimes inaccurate information (e.g. out-of-date IMS, 40% discrepancy\nrates in risks). In addition, the lack of common software tools led to\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdditional cost and time expended to build/maintain multiple systems for similar data (e.g.,\nshadow document and product structures).\nIncreased cost and time to find and integrate data.\nLimited capability for efficient trending/data mining.\n\nProgram-wide data systems architecture was developed, deployed, and used 4\xc2\xbd years into the\nProgram, with promising results for some core data sets.\nLessons Learned\nProgram-wide data systems architecture is needed to mitigate DM risks.

Docum ent-centric) Approach\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.10\nDriving Events\nConstellation projects were established before the Program (as described in Section 2.2.6), and\nused numerous legacy processes and data systems that did not support data integration. Once the\nProgram was established, data integration became critical for overall SE, Program management,\nand sustaining support, yet no clear and common data requirements existed to support data\nintegration between levels and organizations (e.g., program-to-project, project-to-project). This\nresulted in misunderstandings (since groups had to translate between data produced in different\nformats), significant manual rework of data products that took time and introduced errors, and\nuse of out-of-date and incomplete data for decision making (that resulted in increased cost). For\nexample, different groups came to meetings with different conclusions based on different data,\nand argued which data were authoritative to attempt to reach agreement.\nLessons Learned\nA data-centric, model-based approach to DM needs to be established at program inception, with\nall levels of management involved in implementation of the approach. Without this, the program\nincurs increased integration costs, additional risk from underspecified data requirements, and\nmanual DM using documents.\nTo implement this approach, clear and common DRDs for specific data that are focused on\nsustaining engineering efforts should be developed for internal NASA and NASA-to-contractor\ndata exchange, including the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRequirements for defined attributes (fields, values, metadata, etc.)\nElectronic data formats for computerized data integration (e.g., XML)\nThe NASA data systems where the data are to be delivered\nThe delivery mechanism (Website upload vs. system-to-system integration push after every\nchange)\n\nA data-centric approach such as this enables linking of configuration-controlled, record-level\ndata and automated integration of data direct from authoritative sources, eliminating error-prone\nmanual copying of data. With this approach, CM can be done at the level of individual fields and\ndata sets rather than of whole documents.\nRecommendations\nA data-centric (vs. document-centric) approach for DM should be established at the beginning of\nthe program, with clear and common data requirements between all levels and organizations of\nthe program using formal agreements (e.g., DRDs) that include requirements for electronic data.\nKey to this is to have a management structure for the approach that interfaces with key\nstakeholders (projects, program offices, and prime contractors).\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n49\n\nConstellation Program\n4.3.3\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nEs tablis h a Model-bas ed Sys tems Engineering Approach\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.10\nDriving Events\nA comprehensive and clearly articulated Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) process\nwas not established at the beginning of the Program and was not effectively communicated to\nthe project offices until the Altair lunar lander office was initiated. As a result, consistent models\nwere not established throughout the Program; and, when improvements were offered later in the\nprogram life cycle, there was little desire or funding provided to enhance the SE process.\nResulting issues include: Program and project offices had operational concepts with substantial\nsynchronization issues; SE practices were sidestepped to accommodate schedule pressure and\navoid perceived costs (e.g., system functional analyses were not consistently performed or\nprematurely terminated); and the architecture was not ultimately traced to DRM objectives.\nLessons Learned\nThe benefits of using MBSE on the Altair design are articulated in Appendix A.2. Its use resulted\nin streamlined engineering requirements development and validation by developing integrated\nproducts among the Requirements, Design, and Operations communities.\nEstablishing requirement traceability to program figures-of-merit and mission and operational\ncapabilities with proper functional analysis was an important step in ensuring requirement quality\nand completeness in the Altair implementation of MBSE. The definition of MBSE requirements\nand process standards as well as up-front education and broader work force experience greatly\nassisted the Altair project in the paradigm shift associated with MBSE. Altair successfully\nestablished traceability of the MBSE process to decision gates and design review criteria, and\nidentified organizational responsibilities to implement the MBSE process. Configuration DM\nprocesses to efficiently and affordably manage the MBSE models and the corresponding data,\nin addition to managing documents generated from the models, were also key factors in the\nsuccess of Altair and also provided a common focal point for SMEs.\nRecommendations\nModel-based Systems Engineering processes, with the ability to govern integration activities,\nshould be established during program formulation to create an integrated set of models that all\nprojects will use. Adoption of MBSE industry-wide standards integrated with NASA standards\nand policies is essential to MBSE success and should be strongly supported by program\nleadership throughout all organizations. MBSE training should be provided to model developers\nand SMEs to ensure consistent model development and traceability up to program decision\ncriteria.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n50\n\nConstellation Program\n4.4\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nSchedule and Resource Management\n\nThis section outlines the primary lessons learned for the program IMS and EVM. This section\nshould be read in context with the DM limitations described in Section 4.3. Lack of a consistent\nDM structure greatly hindered the development of an IMS and an earned value system.\n4.4.1\n\nDefine Objectives and Us es for the Integrated Mas ter Schedule a priori\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\nDriving Events\nProgram development of an IMS was hindered by a number of factors. Primary among these\nwas a lack of a common DM structure, described in Section 4.3. The late start of the Program\nwith respect to the projects (Section 2.2.6) was also a contributing factor. Finally, the lack of\nclarity as to the purpose and use of the IMS delayed its implementation and use further.\nLessons Learned\nProjects and program viewed the purpose of the IMS in fundamentally different ways, for highlevel reporting vs. supporting detailed analysis, respectively. The Program did not explicitly define,\nor internally agree on, the purpose of the IMS. Lack of a single, clearly communicated vision\nfrom the Program resulted in the Program calling for multiple sets of data from the projects in\nvarious formats. Some projects objected to the increased effort being levied on them when the\nvalue of the end product was unclear and, in some cases, counterproductive. This lack of mutual\nunderstanding and intent, exacerbated by poor communication, led to development delays. The\nIMS architecture drove cases in which the Joint Confidence Level (JCL) analysis efforts (Section\n4.5), detailed tracking of SE flows, and calculating an analytical critical path were mutually\nexclusive. When the Program set and communicated the clear goal of achieving a crossprogram, analytical, critical path in the IMS, cooperation improved and implementation became\neasier.\nRecommendations\nThe objectives and uses of the program IMS should be defined and clearly communicated prior\nto scheduling development activities, as these will drive the DM structure and cost to support\nthe IMS.\n4.4.2\n\nA Bigger Schedule Is Not Neces s arily a More Us eful Schedule\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.7, 3.9\nDriving Events\nDue to the lack of clarity of purpose and conflicting opinions on purpose, the IMS development\nteam, working with project counterparts, attempted to develop an IMS that included many\nactivities at Levels 4 and 5 (e.g., contractor and subcontractor activities). As a result, the IMS\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n51\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\ncontained a huge data set that was difficult to maintain and use effectively. The value of the\nresulting schedule was questionable.\nThe Program also developed a high-level Program summary schedule that incorporated all key\nProgram events on about 3 pages. This high-level schedule included an assessed critical path,\nwhich was developed by considering project-calculated critical paths, risk areas, and key technical\nand programmatic integration points. This summary schedule reflected the Program content in a\nmore manageable package, and proved to be a much better management tool.\nLessons Learned\nFor large, multi-project NASA programs, a summary schedule approach with assessed critical\npath and key integration points can provide a more useful management tool with lower development\nand maintenance costs in comparison to a highly data-intensive schedule database.\nRecommendations\nAssess the depth and amount of information necessary to effectively manage the program.\nConsider that a summary schedule integrated from project detailed schedules may comprise the\nfidelity useful for program management at a lower overall cost.\n4.4.3\n\nTes t Earned Value Managem ent Sys tems in Phas e B for Required Implem entation\nin Phas e C\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.2\nDriving Events\nNPR 7120.5D requires the use of EVM in Phase C of developmental programs such as\nConstellation. While EVM is taught in NASA program/project management training, the NASA\nwork force does not have extensive experience on its purpose and best use through successful\napplication. Moreover, with the exception of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA centers do not\nhave validated EVM systems in place.\nIn early 2009, the Program began to implement earned value reporting at Monthly Program\nReviews (MPRs) in preparation for Phase C readiness (post PDR). Problems in understanding,\nreadiness, data discrepancies, and perceptions of the value added from EVM were\nencountered.\nWhile on-line and on-site training was available, this proved inadequate. One-on-one training\nwas implemented to assure that all managers responsible for EVM reporting were able to\nmanage the systems. This type of training encourages questions and creates a relaxed, open\natmosphere for learning and will prevent planning errors that corrupt EVM data and damage\nEVM system credibility.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n52\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nLessons Learned\nEarly implementation of EVM in Phase B was difficult because of unrealistic expectations and\ninsufficient training among the Constellation Program and project management team. One-onone training was the most effective technique in the EVM training effort.\nRecommendations\nPrograms should plan to provide EVM status at the MPR in Phase B and indicate this via the\nprogram plan. The EVM team should schedule \xe2\x80\x9cone-on-one\xe2\x80\x9d EVM training with managers very\nearly in the program. This is necessary to have all managers engaged in dialogue prompted by\nEVM usage for cost control, schedule management, and corrective actions planning.\nNote the following cautions in application of EVM described in Section 4.5.3.\n4.4.4\n\nUs e Standardized Data for Earned Value Managem ent and Cos t Accounting\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.10\nDriving Events\nDue to the start-up phasing described in Section 2.2.6, the involvement of every NASA center\n(and associated contractors) described in Section 2.2.3, and the lack of an adequate data system\narchitecture (Section 4.3), the earned value system was very difficult to implement. Not all\nprocesses were documented among the Program, projects, and centers, and no standardized\nreporting formats or templates were used NASA wide. Additionally, inconsistent rates and fulltime equivalent conversion factors were applied by each center and project as well as the\nProgram to calculate budgets and performance. These inconsistencies made reconciliation of\nproducts a Herculean task.\nFurther, cost accrual personnel were using a completely different financial system than that\nused by the earned-value community. This was primarily driven by the need to interface with\nheritage systems at NASA centers (i.e., NASA cost accounting is center oriented). This difference\nconsumed much time and effort in reconciliation, and was particularly onerous because of the\nconstant need to re-plan as budgets were cut. There was also no valid system in place to manage\nor track procurement costs (a major portion of the Program budget).\nLessons Learned\nWhen the program and its projects do not have standardized data, integration and data quality\nsuffer. Budget estimates and performance calculations are never truly consistent due to use of\ninconsistent data.\nRecommendations\nData gathering and reconciliation needs to be accurate and consistent in concert with\nRecommendation 4.3.1.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n53\n\nConstellation Program\n4.4.5\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRigorous Bas eline Control May Not Be Pos s ible during Early Phas es or Rapid\nBudget Changes\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.2\nDriving Events\nAs described in Section 2.2.2, the Program encountered inconsistent and unreliable funding\nthrough its lifetime. Budget changes directly affected the major schedule milestones and the\nability of the Program to maintain schedule integrity during rapid budget changes. The effort to\nestablish a working baseline in Phase B to execute early use of EVM was extremely difficult in\nthis environment. In addition, the processes used for baseline CM (e.g., baseline change requests\nand a baseline change log) were still in development and not ready to track the numerous\nchanges.\nMoreover, the broad trade-space described in Section 2.2.5 is a natural driver of uncertainties in\nan early-phase program.\nLessons Learned\nPhase B EVM requires a rigorous CM system in place to allow for the program formulation\nturbulence inherent in this phase. Without a well-documented and current baseline, quality EVM\ndata generation is problematic.\nRecommendations\nAlthough the baseline is still being established during the formulation phase, an initial baseline\nchange control log and baseline change documentation should be developed to trace budget\nand funding changes and communicate those changes regularly. Logs should be developed to\nenable the staff to have an historical trace.\n\n4.5\n\nJoint Confidence Level\n\nThis section outlines the primary lessons learned for the JCL, which is a methodology pioneered\nby Constellation at the behest of NASA HQ that can be used by a program to provide\nconfidence levels for the achievement of program objectives based on budget and schedule\ninformation. It attempts to predict the confidence in success given a budget phased against\nschedule milestones. NASA HQ set a 65% confidence level for Constellation.\nThis topic is technical in nature, and the interested reader is encouraged to review the complete\nreport on the Constellation development and usage of this technique. 14\n\n14\n\nKuo, F. and Wilson, S. \xe2\x80\x9dJoint Confidence Level Requirement: Policy and Issues.\xe2\x80\x9d NASA TM-2011-216154.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n54\n\nConstellation Program\n4.5.1\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe Current J oint Confidence Level Budget and Schedule Res erve Requirem ents\nAre Untenable\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.2\nDriving Events\nRequirements have been documented in NPD 1000.5 and NPR 7120.5 directing programs to\nbudget to a 70% joint cost and schedule confidence level. Although the Constellation Program\nwas permitted latitude to plan to a 65% JCL, analyses showed that this requirement, when\ncoupled with the inherent uncertainties in large-scale, tightly coupled programs associated with\nhuman space flight, drives the need for high budget and schedule reserves. This is driven from\nthe fundamental nature of portfolio management. There is a beneficial effect to cost confidence\nprovided by portfolio diversification because cost and budgets are fungible; program managers\ncan transfer money from a project in surplus to another in shortage. However, extending the\nrequirement to include schedule, as in JCL, reverses the benefits of the portfolio effect. This is\nbecause, unlike money, one cannot transfer time from a project that has been completed early\nto one that is late.\nThe budget status of the program is described in Section 2.2.1 as is the first key finding, 3.1.The\ncurrent 65% JCL demands budget and schedule reserves that are untenable for most projects\nand programs. The Agency and government budgeting process (along with many historical\nexamples) precludes the types of reserves necessary to maintain this level of confidence.\nLessons Learned\nTo meet the 65% JCL requirement, budget and schedule reserves of 30% to 50% are needed\nfor a typical, tightly coupled human space flight program. Using the minimum 30% reserve\nrequirement and the approximate $24B budgeted for IOC, this translates to a reserve of $7.2B\nfor IOC alone.\nFor the entire Constellation Program through FY20, the budget was approximately $100B\n(including $12B in reserves). Using the minimum 30% on program content ($88B) renders $26.4B\nthat would have had to be set aside for reserves for the full program. This is more than double\nthe actual reserves held, and does not include the required schedule reserve of 30%. Clearly,\nthis amount of funding is excessively large with respect to the overall NASA funding and would\nnot be allowed to sit idle in the Constellation budget in light of other Agency needs.\nRecommendations\nImplement an approach to stipulate requirements for cost confidence alone, but still enforce an\nemphasis on schedule uncertainty as an inherent element within cost estimates. This approach\nis described in more detail in the citation above.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n55\n\nConstellation Program\n4.5.2\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe J oint Confidence Level Methodology Is a Us eful Decis ion Support Tool\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.2\nDriving Events\nThe implications of a JCL target requirement notwithstanding, the analysis provided invaluable\ninsight into the health of programs and projects and served as a vital portal into schedule, cost,\nand technical issues. The most significant contribution of JCL is its ability to provide information\nto program managers about the comprehensive impact of risks to schedule and cost, focusing\non key issues at the macro level. It has proven to be a valuable management tool that merges\nthe risk, cost, and schedule stance and also captures the dynamics of the interrelationships.\nFor the Constellation Program, the JCL process generated new strategic dialogue and\nunderstanding among program and project stakeholders \xe2\x80\x94 and even within the project control\nteam. Analytical cooperation, as well as traceability, understandable methodology, identifiable\ninput sources, and analytically rigorous results, are all hallmarks of successful JCL in action.\nLessons Learned\nJCL analysis is highly useful in providing information to program managers about the\ncomprehensive impact of risks to schedule and cost, thus enabling focus on key issues that\nmost greatly effect the plan.\nRecommendations\nContinue to encourage (or require) programs to conduct JCL analysis to drive out the most\nrelevant issues and focus on those that have the greatest impact.\n\n4.6\n\nConstruction of Facilities\n\nManagement of facilities construction and modification has inherent complexities that were not\nfully appreciated at the outset of the Program. Since Constellation was the first major NASA\ndevelopment requiring new and modified facilities at multiple locations in many years, oversight\nskills were initially lacking. As described in Section 2.2, the Program was inheriting much of the\nvast space shuttle infrastructure, and was viewed as a source to solve pent-up facility\nmaintenance demands. Moreover, management of facility construction is not a subject typically\ncovered in program management training, so much of the management team was unfamiliar with\nsome of the unique challenges. These include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFacility use. Some specialized facilities relied on the space shuttle (and, hence, Constellation)\nas the single, or nearly single, user. Centers desired to retain capabilities, but had difficulty\neither finding other users or justifying the costs to a single program (or both). Some facilities\nwere nearly duplicated at centers, so securing a program commitment for usage was\ncompetitive and highly sought. Once the commitment was secured by a particular venue,\ncost estimates tended to increase.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n56\n\nConstellation Program\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nConstruction of facilities (CoF) funding. Congress requires higher visibility for funding for\nnew facilities, and funds must be managed separately from other program funds, reducing\nflexibility. Conversion of CoF funds to research and development (R&D) funds (and vice\nversa) is extremely difficult. Increased Congressional visibility increases visibility at NASA\nHQ and resident centers, necessitating additional reviews.\nCenter infrastructure. Since most facilities reside at NASA centers, senior center\nmanagement expected to be a part of the decision chain, regardless of funding source.\nCost control. While not flight hardware, CoF is fraught with historical cost overruns and\noverestimations. This creates additional management difficulties in a budget that is highly\nvisible and inflexible.\nFacility development in parallel with hardware development. New and modified facilities for\nuse by Constellation were under design in parallel with hardware design in many cases. In\nsome instances, hardware design changes drove changes in facility designs. The inflexibility\nof the CoF process made this a particular challenge.\n\nTo avoid these issues in future programs, flagship programs should establish an experienced\nfacility team, conduct independent cost estimation on construction projects, and develop a\nfacilities construction planning process that will guide selection and development of facilities and\nensure due diligence is performed.\n4.6.1\n\nEs tablis h Program-level Facilities Expertis e during Program Form ulation\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.1\nDriving Events\nThe Constellation Program experienced all of the issues related to construction of facilities listed\nabove. Moreover, there were multiple CoF projects under way at several NASA centers. Most of\nthe issues resulted from one or more of the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInadequate front-end planning (FEP) and due diligence\nPoorly defined, immature, and changing facility requirements\nVehicle requirements changes that affected ongoing CoF (since the vehicle designs were\nimmature at the time that CoF had to begin)\nLimited funding and no contingency\nLack of CoF experience in programs and projects\nComplexities and confusion in determining which parts of the project required CoF vs. R&D\nfunding\nLate engagement of center facility expertise\n\nLessons Learned\nThe program and projects must have CoF expertise in their construction of technical facilities\n(manufacturing, test and operations facilities).\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n57\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRecommendations\nEstablish a small, experienced facilities team early at the formulation of the program. This team\nshould include facility cost estimators and facility development experts, as described below. This\nteam oversees facility selection and development as well as aids in determining and tracking\nprogram facility use according to the facility planning process described below.\n4.6.2\n\nDevelop a Facilities Planning Proces s\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.7\nDriving Events\nMost facilities issues experienced by the Program could be linked to inadequate FEP, in part\ndriven by the late Program start relative to projects (Section 2.2 6).\nMoreover, the starting state of the facility was not necessarily understood for the facilities that\nwere being modified. That is, the facility condition report was not detailed enough to accurately\nidentify all problems, and estimates were based on the building only and not on unique vehicle\nrequirements. Initial proposed budgets for some facilities did not account for the immaturity of\nthe facility requirements. Facility requirements were often immature at the time at which the\nfacility project needed to begin. Since CoF must start years before vehicle design requirements\nare solidified, vehicle design requirements were changing that would impact a facility that was\nalready under construction. Some projects did not have project management plans. Trade studies\nand cost estimates often did not consider full life-cycle costs.\nLessons Learned\nAppropriate due diligence should be followed in selecting and developing facilities needed to\nsupport the program. The program documented the CoF processes once these unique aspects\nwere understood.\nRecommendations\nDuring program formulation, develop a facility selection and development process that is\nconsistent with NASA processes, laws, and regulations, and that reflects the organization of the\nprogram. This FEP process must have built-in flexibility so it can be tailored for the unique\nfacility complexities. The process should ensure appropriate due diligence is done throughout\nthe development cycle: from initial trade studies through construction and commissioning. Project\nmilestones should be linked to the existing budget processes to provide the most current and\naccurate facility cost estimate available. The process should ensure that environmental impacts,\nenergy efficiency, and historic preservation are considered in development. The process should\nlay out roles and responsibilities regarding who is developing the various due diligence products.\nIt should clearly define the role of the centers, the projects, the program, and other stakeholders\nthat should be involved. Milestone approval requirements should be clearly defined (Reference:\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n58\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nCxP 70700 Constellation Program, Constellation Management Plan, Annex 10 Facility Planning\nProcess.)\n4.6.3\n\nAccom modate the Unique Ris ks Inherent in Cons truction of Res earch and\nDevelopm ent Facilities\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.1, 3.7\nDriving Events\nMany of the facilities that are needed to support a new program are technically complex (unlike\nan office building); therefore, these projects have significant technical risks. In Constellation, the\nReverberant Acoustic Test Facility at the Plum Brook Station Space Environment Test facility\nand the Stennis Space Center A-3 rocket test stand had requirements that were beyond any\nfacility in existence. These one-of-a-kind facilities led to technical risks that required technology\ndevelopment and testing to mitigate them. Technical risks can lead to additional cost or schedule\nrisks; these technical risks should thus be accounted for in CoF budgets and schedules. Accounting\nfor these risks also requires flexibility in budgeting and schedule.\nA related factor is the immaturity in the requirements for a facility in a development program\nsuch as Constellation. Facilities, such as those to support testing, manufacturing, or operations,\nare required early in the program life cycle. Often the manufacturing, testing, and operations\nrequirements are being developed at the time the facility construction must start, which leads to\nunavoidable changes to the construction (driving costs up).\nIn other cases, significant new requirements are levied on a facility. For example, after\nconstruction start, the Program required the Mechanical Vibration Facility to accommodate not\nonly the IC hardware, but also LC hardware \xe2\x80\x93 namely Altair vibration testing.\nThe existing agency CoF process supports building administrative-type facilities that have low\ntechnical risks. To accommodate the challenges of building an R&D facility, a program must\nhave large reserves set aside for the CoF projects and the flexibility to change funding levels\nwithout requiring an Operating Plan change, separate management, or Congressional approval.\nWith the current CoF system, once a program sets aside reserves in the CoF account, it cannot\nreclaim that funding for R&D accounts should the facility reserve not be required. Changing\nCongressional operating plans just to manage risk in a facility development project is not good\nfiscal practice.\nLessons Learned\nConstruction of facilities processes should be modified to better accommodate R&D facility\ndevelopment and provide funding flexibility.\nRecommendations\nModify existing CoF process to address the risk associated with the building of R&D facilities.\nFlexibility could be provided that allows the recapture of a CoF budget that has been used for\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n59\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nconstruction or to increase funding due to construction changes. A second tool for gaining\nlimited flexibility is for the program to group construction projects at a geographic location into a\nlarger project. Grouping would allow the program the flexibility to move funds from one subproject\nto another at the same location without requiring an operating plan change. For example, the\nnumerous construction projects required at Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) for the upper stage\ncould be strategically grouped so that money could be transferred from one CoF project at MAF\nto another.\n\n4.7\n\nRisk Management\n\nThe Constellation Program implemented an integrated RM process compliant with NPR 8000.4,\nContinuous Risk Management, and consistent with experience on the ISS Program and SSP.\nSuccessful RM faced significant challenges, as described in Section 2.2. Chief among these\nwas the dwindling budget reserve that in large measure consumed program flexibility to address\nrisks. Risks were diligently tracked and reported, but many lingered and, indeed, accrued due to\nbudget limitations.\nAs with Section 4.4, this section should be read in context with the DM limitations described in\nSection 4.3. Implementation of RM was partially hindered early in the Program by the lack of a\ncommon, requirements-driven data system. An integrated RM process for systems that must\ninteract physically or operationally is essential to discovering, characterizing, and reducing\nintegrated risks. To support these activities, it is important to maximize similarity in common\nstandards for defining, comparing, and tracking risks. Using a common risk database can\nsubstantially improve the effectiveness of this activity by providing common reports, fields,\ndefinitions, evaluation criteria, and electronic sharing capability.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n60\n\nConstellation Program\n4.7.1\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nEns ure Ris k Managem ent Is Embedded in the Des ign Proces s\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.5\nDriving Events\nThe complexity, size, and limited budget described in Section 2.2 were circumstances that\nengendered a difficult RM environment. While a rigorous RM system was implemented, using\nthe best assets and knowledge of the Agency, management processes can develop a life of\ntheir own, yielding a myopic view and confusion about the value of the process vs. the product.\nThe Program was most successful with RM when risks were identified, analyzed, and brought to\nresolution as part of the design process rather than independent of the design process.\nLessons Learned\nThis team-centered risk identification process worked especially well as part of the Integrated\nDesign Analysis Cycle (IDAC) process. IDAC provided a venue for iteratively improving analysis\ntools, integrating analysis disciplines, and investigating design decisions and operational\nassumptions. It brought stakeholders from the directorate, Program, projects, and elements\ntogether on a regular basis to define assumptions, perform integrative analysis, interpret results,\nand draw conclusions. IDAC organized the design process and enabled systematic risk\nidentification. As a result, many key technical issues were identified during early design cycles\nrather than later. Examples include: achieving acceptable probabilities for LOC/LOM, structural\nloads on Orion and Altair during trans-lunar injection, first-stage thrust oscillations, and mass\ngrowth during design maturation. This supported early action to reduce or eliminate risks, and\nenhanced integrated understanding of design and performance.\nThe Program experience illustrated that many risks require multiple design cycles to be fully\naddressed via research, analysis, option development, and, ultimately, testing.\nRecommendations\nImplement common risk standards, risk system, risk training, and joint risk review process on\nprograms and projects that have significant interdependencies. Put this system in place early in\ndevelopment to ensure that architecture and mission-driving risks are understood early in the\ndesign process. Embed the RM process with the IDAC process to ensure maximum impact on\nthe design.\n4.7.2\n\nGood Ris k Managem ent Relies on Open Com munication\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.7, 3.8, 3.10\nDriving Events\nSeveral communication issues hindered implementation of an RM and tracking process. First,\nthe purpose and use of the RM system was not well understood throughout the Program and\nprojects. Some viewed the database of risks as too large and cumbersome; others viewed it as\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n61\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\na centralized tool to capture all risks, with simple processes to limit what was seen based on user\nneed. Second, projects were reluctant to provide detailed risk insight because they viewed such\ninsight as micromanagement. The Program needed broad risk insight due to the small and\ndwindling reserve level; projects viewed the level of insight needed as a lack of trust. Third,\ncultural issues were at play. While some centers saw a high number of potential risks as a good\nthing (folks are paying attention), others saw it as a bad thing (there is something terribly wrong\nif all these risks exist). These thorny issues hindered discussion and resolution of Program risks.\nLessons Learned\nAs with the IMS (Section 4.4.1), the purpose and use of the RM system was neither fully\ncommunicated nor embraced by all key stakeholders This led to distrust and a feeling by some\nparties that the risk system was overly burdensome and of limited value.\nRecommendations\nIn establishing RR&A for programs and projects, the amount of insight necessary at each level\nfor proper RM should be established and communicated a priori. Expectations of any risk\nsystem should be established early; do not assume they are understood because the system\nwas used on a prior program.\n4.7.3\n\nEarly and Robus t Probabilis tic Ris k As s es s m ent Enables Ris k-inform ed Des ign\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.5\nDriving Events\nThe Program built early probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs) to inform early design studies. As\ndescribed in Key Finding 3.5, two projects used risk-informed design to great benefit. This was\nenabled by having a PRA available so that trade studies could proceed that weighed options for\nrisk reduction.\nLessons Learned\nThe two projects (Orion and Altair) were able to use a risk-informed design process to improve\nmission success probabilities and reduce mass. These analyses relied on having early PRA\navailable, and could not have proceeded successfully without this analysis capability in place.\nRecommendations\nRisk-informed design (treating risk as a commodity) can only be performed if good PRA data\nare available. Assure that an early and robust PRA is established to support risk-informed design.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n62\n\nConstellation Program\n4.7.4\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nDivide and Conquer to Addres s Com plex Ris ks\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nComplexities and interdependencies in design and, thus, risks drove complexity in solving those\nrisks. Appropriately delegating aspects of risk mitigation to address complex risks arose as a\nmanagement challenge during early design.\nLessons Learned\nDivision of risk mitigation was most effective if portions were defined within the scope of, and\ndelegated to, individual teams. For instance, design risk for the liquid oxygen/hydrogen common\nbulkhead was broken down into many child risks that could be managed by individual teams.\nEach child risk contained a portion of the detailed mitigation plan developed to address every\naspect of the overarching issue related to manufacture and production of the common bulkhead\nstage. This risk illustrated that it can be helpful to establish parent and child risks for complex or\nintegrated issues. This approach makes work more manageable while retaining an integrated\nunderstanding of the risk and strong risk communication between stakeholders. The parent risk\nestablished a context, while the child risks focused on mitigation of specific risk aspects.\nWhile the establishment of parent and child risks was found to be very helpful in managing\ncomplex integrated risks, it was also found that care should be taken to limit the establishment\nof \xe2\x80\x9cparent risks\xe2\x80\x9d to cases in which there is a unique higher-level mitigation activity. Simply\nestablishing parents for all risks that are common across systems and elements inserts unneeded\ncomplexity into the risk process and clutters up the risk system. In the case of mass growth, for\nexample, the Program did not track an integrative parent risk because it was felt that mitigations\nfor potential mass growth would simply reflect standard SE practice. Risks were established on\nthose systems that had mass issues, such as Orion.

It is therefore necessary to\ndevelop a solid and compelling rationale for testing, or elements of testing, to form cogent program\nand project plans.\nLessons Learned\nTo better focus limited test resources, the Program developed a Risk Informed Test (RIT)\napproach that was aimed at identifying the most significant operational and developmental risk\ndrivers and ensuring that tests appropriately explored these through analysis, ground test, and\nflight test. RIT relied on evaluating both qualitative and quantitative systems safety assessment,\nhistorical failure history, historical test and verification experience, and expert elicitation to help\nidentify test priorities, test fidelity, and frequency.\nA qualitative approach such as RIT, which collects what is known about failure modes and the\neffectiveness of analysis and test to mitigate and understand these risks, can be very helpful when\ninforming these decisions.\nRecommendations\nWhile more testing provides greater assurance of safety and maturity growth, there are clearly\ncost and schedule limits on how much testing can be done. An approach such as RIT can be\nhelpful in discerning the best test approaches.\n\n4.8\n4.8.1\n\nDesign and Development\nEns ure a Com mon Unders tanding for Im plem entation of Hum an Space Flight\nS ys tem Certification\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.11\nDriving Event\nAs the Program matured, the Agency was unable to clarify requirements to govern the first flight\nof humans on a new spacecraft. 15 This was, in part, due to the generation gap in human space\nflight discussed in Section 2.2.4. The space shuttle was designed in the mid 1970s, and tested\nin the late 1970s and early 1980s. Few, if any, senior leaders in the Agency had dealt with the\nissues surrounding vehicle certification for human space flight, particularly for vehicle launch and\nreentry.\nThe NASA human-rating criterion 16 is stated as: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven that the human [space flight] system is\ndesigned for human [space flight], it is accepted that the objective is to fly humans when risks to\n\n15\n\nSuch requirements exist for payloads and reflect varying levels of test of new commercial flight vehicles\nbased on the level of government insight and importance of the payload.\n16\nNESC-RP-10-00619. \xe2\x80\x9cReadiness for First Crewed Flight.\xe2\x80\x9d April 12, 2011.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n64\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nthe crew safety have been mitigated to the point where the need or benefit is worth the residual\nrisks.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis criterion, while sensible and easy to understand in principle, is extremely difficult to\nimplement as certification guidance. It is instead left to program management to interpret into a\ndesign, development, analysis, and test plan that leads to certification for human space flight.\nAnd, while program staffs are skilled in this, the breadth of interpretation leaves a program\nextremely vulnerable in the face of budget challenges once that plan is formulated. Moreover,\nas some have observed, 17 the current strategy does not adequately address \xe2\x80\x9cunknownunknowns,\xe2\x80\x9d or the unexpected things the hardware can \xe2\x80\x9ctell\xe2\x80\x9d the designers during test.\nSection 2.2.1 described the budget challenges faced by the Program during its tenure. A primary\ntarget during multiple rounds of budget cuts was the test program leading to human certification.\nThis test program became difficult to defend in the face of myriad interpretations of what it\nshould take to certify for human space flight. The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cresidual risk\xe2\x80\x9d was widely debated\nand never clearly understood, such that any critic could challenge the test plan. The interested\nreader is referred to a summary accounting of changes to the certification test plan during the\nlife of the Program, cited in footnote 17, below.\nThe Constellation Program was advancing with necessary tasks that would define the certification\nrequirements for a human space flight system. The integrated certification plan was not complete\nas required for the PDR in February 2010. This delay was due to the interpretation challenges\nnoted above, along with the mismatch between the project procurement contract requirements\nvs. the integrated requirements produced by the Program SE&I organization (see Section 2.2.6).\nAfter PDR, work on the plan was halted as more cost/schedule-friendly variant strategies were\nstudied. While an operational certification plan was not completed, a number of lessons learned\nwere identified that addressed several inefficiencies that originated from these driving events.\nLessons Learned\nA cogent, integrated test plan cannot withstand budget challenges if the underlying requirements\nand rationale (certification criterion, residual risk) are left open to broad interpretation.\nThe definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccertification\xe2\x80\x9d (in terms of content and in relation to content definitions of terms\nsuch as \xe2\x80\x9cverification\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvalidation\xe2\x80\x9d) at the element and integrated hardware/system level were\nunclear (see Section 4.2.6). The Master Integration and Verification Plan (MIVP) was released\nat the Systems Requirements Review (SRR) but did not adequately define the certification process\nor the plan. It provided a high-level definition to Program elements but not to the level of detail\nnecessary for certification planning (e.g., defining the role of the Systems Acceptance Review,\nDesign Certification Review, and Certification of Flight Readiness in the overall certification plan).\nMIVP Revision A was released for the PDR and included an updated certification plan.\n\n17\n\nNoriega, C. et al. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Crewed Flight: Rationale, Considerations and Challenges from the Constellation\nExperience.\xe2\x80\x9d In preparation as a NASA TM.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n65\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nWork should be performed early in the life cycle of a program to develop an integration and test\nstrategy (including flight tests) as a companion to design definitions, starting with system concept\ndevelopment and maturing with the design through certification completion.

The integration and test strategy should accompany design descriptions\nand be controlled in the same manner. The strategy should be used as a planning benchmark to\nprovide a clearer and considerably more valid basis of content, cost, and schedule estimation.\nRecommendations\nThe Agency should interpret its current certification criterion to a level such that a program plan\nfor design, analysis, and test can be clearly seen to either meet or not meet that criterion, particularly\nin the face of budget pressures.\nPrograms should\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nClearly define what \xe2\x80\x9ccertification\xe2\x80\x9d means prior to awarding contracts.\nClearly define the test and evaluation roles and responsibilities prior to awarding contracts.\nDevelop an integration and test strategy for accomplishing certification concurrently (and to\na comparable extent and fidelity) with initial system concept development.\n\n4.8.2\n\nEm bed Human-rating Certification in the Core Proces s es /Tools of the Program\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nThe Constellation Program was the first program to implement NPR 8705.2B, which was approved\ncoincident with the Program SDR. A draft human-rating certification package (HRCP) was\ndeveloped for the SDR. The NPR 8705.2A and B versions both require implementation of a\nsafety process; one key difference between them is that Version B places more emphasis on\nperforming the analysis to drive the design vs. using a rule-based approach to drive the failure\ntolerance for catastrophic events, which is the emphasis in Version A. Since the NPR was\napproved after contracts were put in place, needed NPR data had to be accommodated with the\ncurrently planned contract deliverables. Some potential gaps existed for the new NPR-required\nspecific design assessment data.\nThe Constellation human-rating approach was to embed human rating into Program standard\nprocedures. This placed responsibility for compliance with the designers rather than establishing\na separate process. It also leveraged the NASA human space flight heritage and culture for\nimplementation of these procedures.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n66\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nA team, which was staffed by technical experts responsible for ensuring the satisfaction of the\nNPR requirements, project representatives responsible for ensuring project compliance, technical\nauthorities, and astronauts, was responsible for ensuring that the evidence provided met the\nintent of the NPR requirements.\nThe team demonstrated to human-ratings stakeholders that the required content was covered\n(and augmented, if necessary) within the Program products. The HRCP provided pointers (via\nhyperlinks) to the evidence contained within the planned Program documentation. The Program\nused the requirements software tool to demonstrate compliance with NPR technical requirements.\nFault tolerance and the use of the hazards database is a key area in which this type of negotiation\nwith stakeholders is necessary.\nLessons Learned\nBuild human-rating precepts into the program teams along with standard processes and tools.\nDo not establish human-rating activities as a separate process unto itself.\nRecommendations\nFor future human-rated procurements, include the process-related requirements from the NPR,\nincluding access to all human-rating data in the contract SOW.\nEstablish a team with the implementers and technical experts to develop the HRCP.

Most\nnotably, the ISS Program attempted this in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly since the\nInternational Partners use SI units. The ISS Program abandoned the effort when costs of\nimplementation became prohibitive. Human space flight programs have lagged in this effort,\nprimarily due to the reliance on heritage infrastructure that was built in English units (e.g., launch\npads, test stands, transport ships and crawlers, railcars, etc.). NASA science missions have enjoyed\nthe best success at this conversion, since they are less reliant on heritage infrastructure.\nThe Agency attempted to implement SI units once again, using the Constellation Program as\nleverage to incentivize the change. The CARD established SI as \xe2\x80\x9cprimary units of measure,\xe2\x80\x9d\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n67\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nstating: \xe2\x80\x9cAll Level 1, 2, and 3 integrated analyses, performance and verification systems will be\ncompleted in SI units.\xe2\x80\x9d However, the CARD allowed \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish units\xe2\x80\x9d for Level 4/5 (contractor and\nsubcontractor) if justified. The CARD was ambiguous on \xe2\x80\x9coperational data.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet as of 2007, the\nProgram was not compliant \xe2\x80\x93 there was a units \xe2\x80\x9cTower of Babel\xe2\x80\x9d in presentations and analysis.\nThis was primarily due to a lingering heritage infrastructure issue that drove a similarly unacceptable\ncost overhead for implementation. The risk of a units-produced error was clear and present.\nA directive was approved in late 2007 that reinforced the use of SI units and provided details on\nwhere and how to use a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid\xe2\x80\x9d units system based on proven practice in robotic missions. It\nalso addressed the primary constraint that \xe2\x80\x9cflying\xe2\x80\x9d in SI units requires testing in SI units (i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cfly\nlike you test\xe2\x80\x9d).\nLessons Learned\nWhile the Program and projects were willing to implement this new directive, cost estimates\nprovided by the major contractors (who were well into design due to early contract starts) were\nvery high, approaching $370M. 18 Funding was unavailable, even at a low level, to start implementation and negotiate the contractor costs. Ultimately, due to these funding limitations, the\nProgram had no choice but to issue a new directive in June 2009 that specified U.S. customary\n(English) units across the Program.\nRecommendations\nEstablish adequately specific units requirements a priori, including a well-thought-out and executable implementation approach that addresses heritage infrastructure and contractor conversion\ncosts. Unless SI units are specified prior to acquisition, the cost to change will be prohibitive.\nAssign a champion to enforce implementation at all levels until use of SI units is standardized in\nthe human space flight community.\n4.8.5\n\nDes ign for Operability to Reduce Life-cycle Cos t\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.1\nDriving Events\nOne of the many observations of the CAIB was that the space shuttle was expensive to operate.\nThe need to use Apollo-era infrastructure, along with early design compromises that saved thenyear dollars as opposed to out-year dollars, led to an expensive operational program. During\nformulation, Constellation was challenged to design in lower operational costs while using and\nupgrading the shuttle-era (and, in some instances, Apollo-era) infrastructure and \xe2\x80\x9cfixed-base\xe2\x80\x9d (see\nSection 2.2). All involved recognized that program sustainability depended on lower life cycle and,\n\n18\n\nNotably, these costs were primarily due to changes in documentation, rather than hardware.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n68\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nthus, operational costs. Moreover, lower spending on IC operational costs would allow the\ndevelopment of the LC to proceed.\nAn example concept was the \xe2\x80\x9cclean pad\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which recognized that every attachment,\numbilical, structure, etc. on the launch pad that touched the vehicle drove an interface that\nneeded a design, an ICD, operational requirements, procedures and launch constraints, and a\nteam of operators. This, in turn, drove operational costs and complexity. Designers were\nchallenged to drive interfaces to an absolute minimum to achieve the \xe2\x80\x9ccleanest\xe2\x80\x9d pad possible.\nAnother launch-related concept for the LC was to shorten the time between launches of the\ncrew vehicle (Ares I) and the cargo vehicle (Ares V) to drive minimal launch preparations into\ndesigns. A target of 1.5 hours between launches challenged designers to reduce both launch\npreparation and processing times.\nAn activity was initiated, during the SRR in late 2006, to formalize these \xe2\x80\x9cstretch requirements\xe2\x80\x9d\nfor inclusion into the CARD. Teams from the operations centers (JSC, KSC) brainstormed an\ninitial set of candidates that would help the Ground Operations and Mission Operations projects\nto reduce their costs to operate the integrated program systems. The teams developed a set of\nproposed requirements that were assessed by the projects and elements for cost and schedule\nimpact. Roughly half of the proposed requirements were implemented into Revision A of the\nCARD. Those that were not implemented as requirements became a set of Constellation Program\n\xe2\x80\x9cdesign guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d that were scored for their implementation progress at subsequent Program\nmilestone reviews.\nMany of the design guideline items found their way into the architecture where there was\nperformance or schedule margin to accommodate them. Some examples of these design\nchanges for operability include the use of a single common fuel for all Ares reaction control\nsystems (hydrazine), non-pyrotechnic separation systems for all flight-to-ground umbilicals, and\nlocating all vehicle-to-ground pad interfaces within the tower-facing arc of the flight system.\nSeveral initial stretch requirements were deleted from Program specifications during the season\nof SDRs. The most significant of these deletions was the requirement for meeting targeted\noperation cost caps, by system, at full-operational capability. Others were tailored or ameliorated\nbased on budgetary and performance limits of the architecture.\nThe most successful of the stretch requirements dealt with minimizing the critical path of\nintegrated launch operations processing. An integrated WG was established to estimate and\ntrack the impact of vehicle and infrastructure design changes to the targeted 45-day vehicle\nprocessing flow. By the time of Program PDR, the architecture was showing the capability to\nmeet this aggressive timeline requirement. While working this ongoing assessment, strong\nworking relationships between the Ground Operations Project team and the vehicle design\nelements were established in which the common goal was developed and shared.\nThe Program recognized that the stretch requirements were only able to address the operations\nphases of the life cycle (post-handover from the contractor). To attack life-cycle cost challenges\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n69\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\ninherent in production and sustaining engineering, the Program established an operability \xe2\x80\x9cczar\xe2\x80\x9d\nto focus on the fixed and recurring costs of the flight elements.\nLessons Learned\nDesign for operability must be a driving metric in the initial architectural trades, particularly for\nprograms planned with significant operational lifetimes. Operability requirements imposed after\nthe major architectural decisions are made must compete for budget and performance margins\nthat, in the case of Constellation, were extremely limited.\nOperability must be defined uniformly across all program and project elements. Ground\nOperations saw operability as a measure of cost/complexity to perform launch system integration\nand checkout; Ares saw it through the lens of the ease of maintenance of its designs; Mission\nOperations aligned it as being associated with operational robustness and flexibility of in-space\nelements; Orion assessed it as the reliability and robustness of its subsystems. While these\ndefinitions had some overlap, they often led to competing interpretations of the intent.\nFocus on design for launch site operability improvement provides some cost-reduction benefit,\nbut is only a small contributor to the total life-cycle cost of complex space systems. Operability\nimprovement is further constrained by incorporation of legacy systems and infrastructure.\nMany stretch requirements were defined with both \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d values. Threshold\nrequirements were minimum targets to be met with objective requirements as goals to continue\nto work toward as systems matured. In practice, while projects did do assessments to reach the\nobjectives, many objectives were not implemented because the needed contract changes were\ncost prohibitive.\nRecommendations\nPrograms should establish an initial cost model, which includes operability, and maintain that\nmodel as systems evolve from SRR through PDR to CDR. Consider using the best practices of\n\xe2\x80\x9cdesign-to-price\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccost as an independent variable\xe2\x80\x9d as implemented in DoD acquisitions.\nUse of \xe2\x80\x9cstretch requirements\xe2\x80\x9d that incorporate both \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d specifications can\nbe maximally effective if they are included up front in acquisitions or procurements through\nperformance incentives for contractors. Programs should consider these measures to assist\ncontractors in focusing on design innovations that provide operability improvements of significant\nlife-cycle cost drivers.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n70\n\nConstellation Program\n4.8.6\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nSim ulate Proces s es Early (Run a \xe2\x80\x9cVirtual\xe2\x80\x9d Mis s ion)\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Event\nThe Program freshly developed mission integration and certificate of flight readiness (CoFR)\nprocesses needed to be assessed for efficiency and productivity. Typically, these processes are\n\xe2\x80\x9cshaken out\xe2\x80\x9d during early missions or mission preplanning. Since the technology was available,\nthe Program undertook an early mission simulation, prior to PDR, that included prelaunch, inflight, and post-flight planning and operations.\nAn ISS crew rotation mission was chosen. The first simulation was termed Virtual Mission-1\n(VM1), and a second simulation, VM2, was planned prior to Program cancellation.\nLessons Learned\nGaps and areas of improvement were discovered in the mission processes and, in one case, an\nOrion vehicle design deficiency was discovered.\nProcess improvements: Several critical mission milestones that had schedule or assignment\ndisconnects were identified. An example was the Mate Review: There was some difference of\nopinion among the Ares project, Ground Operations Project, and ATK [Alliant Techsystems, Inc.,\nMinneapolis, Minn.) (the Ares first-stage contractor) as to who was responsible for the stacked\nfirst stage. While Ares assumed responsibility for VM1, the issue remained open and the plan\nwas to simulate this activity during VM2 to resolve it. The VM1 team also identified schedule\ndisconnects with the Mission Control Center and Constellation Training Facility reconfiguration.\nOther mission milestones needed processing improvements. For example, the CoFR was a\nmanual process that was very labor intensive. VM1 helped confirm that mission stakeholders\nneeded a continuous status capability that could be provided by a software tool (e.g., the CoFR\ndashboard).\nDesign improvements: The management team challenged the virtual team during VM1 with an\nISS control moment gyroscope (CMG) failure such that a new CMG would need to be processed\nquickly for launch in the Orion SM. The VM1 team identified the need to access the SM\nunpressurized cargo later than planned (L-270). The command module (CM)/SM stack had to\nbe accessed before leaving the KSC operations and checkout (O&C) building because no\nground support equipment existed to access the SM in the KSC Multipurpose Processing\nFacility. For VM1, the team was able to load the CMG later in the flow because the CM/SM\nstack was still in the O&C and the Ground Operations team worked around the clock. Another\nsimulated emergency, which coincided with an SM redesign study to accommodate unpressurized\ncargo, resulted in several new Orion recommendations for the SM design (e.g., overhead\nmounting using a lunar propellant tank mounting point, radiator removal). This underscored the\nconcept that design decisions made early in the program can drive operational capabilities later.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n71\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nRecommendations\nThe virtual mission is an excellent vehicle with which to exercise planned mission management\nprocesses. In the case of VM1, the team refined many of the processes and began developing\nneeded software tools.\nAdditional virtual missions are recommended with lessons learned from VM1. A virtual mission\nsimulation to exercise an initial (non-operational) ISS rendezvous flight would be very helpful in\nidentifying and resolving any process problems that might be present in the longer mission\nmanagement template planned for these initial flights.\n4.8.7\n\nFocus the Certificate of Flight Readines s Proces s\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Event\nPerceptions that the current human space flight CoFR process was inefficient and needlessly\nburdensome led the Program manager to charter a CoFR L6S composed of representatives\nfrom all Program organizations, as well as the ISS and Space Shuttle Programs, and an external\nsenior advisor. 19 The L6S team charter was to develop a CoFR process that was \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated,\nefficient, and streamlined.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLessons Learned\nThe existing Program CoFR (flight preparation processes) was people, meeting, and paper\nintensive. The CoFR lean event led to a philosophy of a continuous (anytime) status capability\nthat was to be facilitated by a CoFR tool (the CoFR \xe2\x80\x9cdashboard\xe2\x80\x9d). In addition, the process was\nredesigned to be product focused vs. organizationally focused. That is, for a group to be integral\nto the CoFR process, it must provide a concrete product such as an assessment or a report that\ncontributes to certification. This eliminated several \xe2\x80\x9ccheckers checking the checkers\xe2\x80\x9d that have\nbeen added to the CoFR process over the years. A similar activity regarding WGs revealed\ninefficiencies with unchartered WGs using precious resources.\nRecommendations\nContinue to use L6S or similar methodologies to assess process efficiency and effectiveness.\nContinue to use applications/dashboards, \xe2\x80\x9croll-ups,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. to get a continuous status of not only\nCoFR but of any work process that spans a considerable time duration. This should be done in\nlieu of infrequent and large status events, and to avoid the generation and use of paper products\nfor such events. This is not only inefficient and time consuming, but leads to \xe2\x80\x9cstale\xe2\x80\x9d information.\n\n19\n\nThe ISS and Space Shuttle Programs were included because the Constellation CoFR process had been\nlargely based on prior program experiences.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n72\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThe full set of recommendations was implemented in CxP 70175, the Constellation Program\nCertification of Flight Readiness Process Plan (CPP). 20\n\n4.9\n\nInternational Partnership Development\n\nThese lessons learned related to international partnership development are focused specifically\non topics relevant to NASA and Constellation internal program planning and development. Two\nrecent and very relevant documents provide broad consensus views of international partnership\nlessons learned. The first of these, \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Space Station Lessons Learned as Applied to\nExploration,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 was developed by the ISS partnership to provide timely guidance in planning the\nConstellation Program. These lessons learned were widely shared and frequently discussed in\nthe activities described below. The second, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ISECG [International Space Exploration\nCoordination Group] Reference Architecture for Human Lunar Exploration\xe2\x80\x94Summary Report\xe2\x80\x9d 22\ncontains consensus lessons learned from the perspective of all international agencies involved\nin the development of the ISS. Both of these documents are valuable tools for planning; however,\nsince they are consensus-based documents, they do not provide a view internal to the Agency.\nAs Constellation was forming, the ISS International Partners expressed an interest in continuing\nto pursue human space flight challenges to expand frontiers together with NASA. As\nConstellation represented the next step in human space exploration, consulting International\nPartners could have been an important step in strengthening our existing partnerships. It also\nbrought us the opportunity for expanding international partnerships to additional space agencies\nbeyond the ISS partnership. It is widely recognized that international agreements enhanced the\nsustainability of the ISS and, thus, could do so for future human space flight efforts.\nHowever, NASA policy and federal regulations restricted the scope of potential international\npartnership opportunities available for the Constellation Program to projects and hardware not\ndesignated as critical path items (see Lessons Learned below). As a practical matter, export\ncontrol regulations exclude international partnerships on launch vehicle development and any\nshared technologies that are defense related. Thus, the focal point for potential partnership\nopportunities occurred during the later phases of the Program\xe2\x80\x94namely, the lunar exploration\n(LC) phase.\n\n20\n\nAlthough this document was not baselined prior to Program cancellation, a full draft was produced in\nsupport of the Program PDR and may be found as an official record within that review.\n21\nISS Multilateral Coordination Board.

It was at this time\nthat initial concept designs and potential architectures were mature enough to frame an integrated\ndiscussion. This integrated framework provided enough knowledge to initiate understanding and\nplanning of the scope and roles that potential partners could take.\nA small team of Constellation personnel began activities within the ISECG to explore potential\navenues that could lead to partnerships and build relationships that would be key to this\nunderstanding. This team had the following objectives:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo understand national priorities. An understanding of the national priorities of each agency,\nwith respect to human exploration, was critical to gauge whether, when, and to what extent\na partnership opportunity might evolve.\nTo develop a realistic planning framework. A realistic understanding of the extent and nature\nof potential or contemplated contributions from each agency was necessary for the Program\nto plan a viable architectural framework.\nTo inform the NASA budget process with realistic assumptions. This understanding allowed\nthe development of a set of budget assumptions based on current and projected international\nstates of affair based on national priorities.\nTo build a sustainable framework for the lunar phase of the Program. As the sustainability of\nthe ISS was achieved via international partnerships, the team envisioned a lunar partnership\nthat would anchor a long-term program within participating agencies and governments.\n\nUnderstandably, each of the agencies with ISS partnership experience viewed future opportunities\nin the context of ISS participation. The ISS was nearing the \xe2\x80\x9cassembly complete\xe2\x80\x9d milestone, and\nagencies were readying for full utilization of the ISS research capabilities. Moreover, much of the\nPartner hardware on ISS was deployed in later program phases; so large budget expenditures\n23\n\nIn alphabetical order: ASI [Agenzia Spaziale Italiana] (Italy); BNSC [British National Space Centre], now\nUKSA [United Kingdom Space Agency] (United Kingdom); CNES [Centre National d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x89tudes Spatiales]\n(France); CNSA [China National Space Administration] (China); CSA [Canadian Space Agency]\n(Canada); CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization] (Australia); DLR\n[Deutches Zentrum f\xc3\xbcr Luft- und Raumfahrt] (Germany); ESA [European Space Agency]; ISRO [Indian\nSpace Research Organisation] (India); JAXA [Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency] (Japan); KARI\n[Korea Aerospace Research Institute] (Republic of Korea); NASA (U.S.); NSAU [National Space Agency\nof Ukraine] (Ukraine); and Roscosmos (Russia). \xe2\x80\x9cSpace agencies\xe2\x80\x9d refers to government organizations\nthat are responsible for space activities.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n74\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nhad been recently spent and/or committed. Full utilization of agency investments in ISS was a\nhigh priority and was just being realized. Non-ISS partners involved in ISECG were either seeking\nISS participation (e.g., South Korea) or contemplating space stations of their own (e.g., China).\nRecent global economic challenges had left most agencies challenged to meet ISS commitments\nand left little to no room in governmental budget planning to accommodate lunar exploration on\nan equivalent scale.\nLessons Learned\nNASA led two major WGs\xe2\x80\x94an objective WG and an architecture WG\xe2\x80\x94that sought to develop\nrealistic plans in light of the national constraints described above. Results of these efforts were\nquite striking as they greatly influenced NASA internal and external planning for lunar exploration.\nPrior to these interactions, NASA had envisioned a lunar outpost as a base from which to explore\nthe moon; something akin to a \xe2\x80\x9cspace station on the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d In working with potential partners,\nthe international group conceived a new architectural plan that was much more flexible and\nresponsive to national priorities and budget realities. This is described in more detail below\n(Section 4.9.2).\nRecommendations\nInclude potential International Partners in architectural discussions as early as possible to\nachieve realistic planning.\n4.9.2\n\nDevelop a Comm on Unders tanding of Goals and Objectives to Inform the\nArchitecture\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nAfter conducting initial formative architectural discussions via ISECG, it became apparent that\nan understanding of national goals and objectives was needed to drive formulation of architectural\nscenarios. NASA proposed a WG within the ISECG to develop this understanding. This group,\nwhich was formed in early 2009, was chartered to pursue a common understanding of agency\nobjectives for human lunar exploration.\nNASA had spent the previous 2 years working with a series of external and internal groups to\ndevelop a set of objectives for lunar exploration. These objectives spanned scientific, technological, economic, cooperative, and educational objectives that could be made possible, and\nprovided benefit via human lunar exploration. While not yet prioritized, these objectives had been\nused to drive the initial NASA architectural concept of an \xe2\x80\x9coutpost,\xe2\x80\x9d described above. An outpost\nfrom which to explore was believed to satisfy the largest number of NASA objectives. Therefore,\nNASA was able to articulate goals and objectives for human lunar exploration towards a common\ninternational set.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n75\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nLessons Learned\nTiming was important here. In 2006, 24 NASA led an initial effort to develop exploration themes\nand objectives in collaboration with the international community as well as other stakeholders, 25\ncollecting nearly 200 potential objectives. The apparent similar motivation and rationale for\nexploration by worldwide space agencies led to the development of the Global Exploration\nStrategy (GES) framework document and the creation of ISECG. This document articulates five\nexploration themes shared by participating space agencies. However, meaningful consensus\nbeyond these five themes was not attainable because no other agency at that time had done\nenough preparation with national stakeholders to engage in discussion to sufficient depth.\nBy 2009, ESA had conducted a series of workshops with external stakeholders to understand\nlunar exploration objectives and was also in a position to discuss commonality among interested\nparties. ESA member agencies (ASI, CNES, UKSA, DLR) had participated in the stakeholder\nreviews and, thus, were able to provide input to discussions based on the particular interests\nand capabilities of their agency. CSA was conducting a similar review of exploration objectives.\nJAXA was in the midst of a national review of lunar objectives and was able to provide insight\nfrom a series of external stakeholder discussions during 2009. Other agencies, while not having\nconducted formal national reviews by 2009, wished to participate in the formulation of a common\nset of objectives for human lunar exploration. The time was ripe for a group of nine agencies to\nembark on discussions.\nThe WG collected more than 600 national objectives ranging from broad, large-scope statements\nto detailed, investigation-level statements. It became clear that a distillation of these was necessary\nto achieve an understanding of where commonality among agencies would lie. Something\nbetween the five GES themes and these 600 national objectives, traceable to each, was\nnecessary to define the level of commonality achievable at this early, pre-program stage. The\nWG agreed these statements should be called goals and also agreed on a definition. NASA led\nthe development by providing a set of 10 summary-level statements of goals. These goals were\ntraceable to the full set of NASA stakeholder-articulated objectives as well as the five GES\nthemes articulated by ISECG. 26 This set of goals provided a framework within which to discuss\ncommonality. Other agencies followed the NASA lead by providing summary statements of their\nown. It was from these statements that a common set of 15 goals for human lunar exploration\nwas developed. ISECG endorsed these in late 2009, and they became the drivers for the\narchitectural work to follow.\nFrom the NASA perspective, these goals achieved the international commonality necessary to\nframe architectural concepts and became an important step forward. Moreover, these common\ngoals did not provide sufficient support to the concept of a permanent outpost on the moon that\n24\n\nNASA.

This drove NASA to engage the ISECG agencies in the architectural\ndiscussions described below.\nMeaningful architectural discussion could be held with a common understanding of goals and\nobjectives in hand. NASA learned that development of common goals and objectives depends\non sufficient stakeholder engagement by participating agencies. Most importantly, the common\ngoals allowed NASA to perceive that an \xe2\x80\x9coutpost\xe2\x80\x9d architecture was not necessary to achieve\nmost agencies goals (see next lesson learned).\nRecommendations\nBefore engaging in architecture discussions, develop a common understanding of goals and\nobjectives among interested agencies. This common understanding will drive the architecture.\n4.9.3\n\nDevelop an Architectural Fram ework for Dis cus s ion of Partners hip Opportunities\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nAn architectural WG was chartered by ISECG, at the behest of NASA, shortly after ISECG was\nchartered. In our view, this WG struggled in its early efforts because there was no common\nunderstanding of, or framework for, its discussion. Early efforts focused on developing common\ninternational standards and interfaces; but without an architectural framework, these discussions\nfaltered. 27\nIn 2008, NASA announced its intent to build an outpost for human exploration of the moon.\nDuring the 2009 ISECG discussions and, in particular, the formulation of the common set of\nhuman lunar exploration goals (Section 4.9.2), NASA learned that most agencies would not be\nable to endorse this type of architecture in the near term, and possibly never.\nThere were several compelling reasons for this. First, as discussed in Section 4.9.1, agency\nbudgets were highly constrained due to both ISS commitments and the stalled global economy.\nCommitments in the foreseeable future would be limited by budget realities. Second, most of the\nISS partner agencies envisioned expanded roles for themselves in the next major international\nundertaking. 28 Third, the ISS experience had led to an understandable aversion among partner\n\n27\n\nNASA may have been inhibited by its previous experience with ISS, in which NASA determined an\narchitecture and invited other agencies to contribute elements. NASA may have tacitly assumed that the\nnext program would proceed in the same way; i.e., along the \xe2\x80\x9coutpost\xe2\x80\x9d path. This is explored in greater\ndepth in the next lesson learned.\n28\nWhile partner agencies had taken on dependent roles in the ISS Program, that experience had developed\nextensive new capabilities within these agencies, and they no longer saw themselves as dependent on NASA\nto provide the same level of leadership and integration expertise.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n77\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nagencies to a high degree of dependency on NASA. 29 This high degree of dependency on\nNASA, exacerbated by the delay imposed by the loss of Columbia, drove a desire to seek a\nparticipatory role unlike the \xe2\x80\x9cISS on the moon\xe2\x80\x9d concept proposed in the NASA outpost vision.\nFourth, and perhaps most importantly, because of the development of the common goals described\nabove, an outpost was not necessary to achieve common goals. Indeed, these goals called for\na much different architectural approach.\nVia the ISECG, NASA sought to lead the development of an architectural framework, later\ncalled the Reference Architecture. Through a series of workshops, 10 agencies participated in\nits development. The architectural framework was endorsed by ISECG in June 2010.\nThis architecture is described in detail elsewhere. 30 Key elements of the Reference Architecture\nthat were important to NASA include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIt represented a flexible, phased approach for lunar exploration that demonstrated the\nimportance of agencies working together early in program formulation. Neither a lunar outpost\nnor a series of Apollo-style missions, the Reference Architecture reflected anticipated global\nrealities and challenges while enabling significant scientific and exploration accomplishments.\nIt would accommodate innovations in technologies, international priorities, and programmatic\nconstraints over time.\nIt enabled opportunities for multiple partnerships coupled with a phased deployment for\npartners at varying levels of maturity. Thus, it was much more attractive to ISECG agencies.\nIt could use launch vehicle assets from many agencies, not just those able to launch humans.\nIt was composed of largely independent phases, employing an international range of humanrated and robotic assets over time to explore the moon. These could be started, paused,\nand/or restarted over time, depending on budget resources.\n\nThe Reference Architecture strategy provided continuous human and/or robotic science and\nexploration activity, spanning multiple locations on the moon, starting from at least 1 year before\nthe first flight crew arrives.\nLessons Learned\nThe development of an architecture framework, in collaboration with potential International\nPartners, resulted in a highly viable architecture for NASA. It was much more responsive to both\nNASA and international community goals and objectives than the initial outpost concept. It was\nflexible and could accommodate programmatic and budget changes over time.

This provided an invaluable experience base from which to build future partnerships.\nIt also led to some initial limitations in what NASA was able to envision as a future with international\npartners. The following discussion, while not exhaustive, illustrates some of these hazards.\nLessons Learned\nStability: Perhaps the greatest benefit of the ISS international partnership is the stability it has\nprovided over more than 20 years for the governments and agencies involved in it. Having\ninterdependency among nations obligated long-term funding support among partners and led to\na stable program that was sustained through unprecedented political change. Of course, this\nbenefit was not lost on those planning the future program. Stability was a primary reason, along\nwith the benefit of sharing resources, that the Constellation Program sought partnerships.\nMaturity: NASA had engaged the ISS partnership at a time, in the mid 1980s, when most other\nspace agencies were in a developmental mode of operation. One attractive reason to join NASA\nin the ISS partnership was to use the partnership as a mechanism to develop a skill base and\nlearn from NASA. After Roscosmos joined the ISS partnership in the mid 1990s, the benefit was\ndoubled for other agencies\xe2\x80\x94to learn from the two organizations capable of launching humans\ninto space. CSA, ESA (along with its member-state agencies), and JAXA all developed substantial\nspace-faring capabilities over the length of the ISS partnership.\nBy 2009, and with a fully active ISECG, it was clear those agencies participating in ISS viewed\nthemselves as mature space-faring agencies, no longer in need of the strong leadership role NASA\nprovides on ISS. Indeed, many of these agencies were contemplating the costs and benefits of\ncontinued reliance on NASA and Roscosmos vs. developing their own human launch capabilities.\nAnd yet for some time, many within NASA assumed the Agency would take the same role it\ndoes currently on ISS. The ISECG members expressed the desire for NASA to continue to lead,\nbut in a different way.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n79\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nThis new style of leadership required an internal challenge to NASA: to define a leadership role\nthat recognized current global capabilities and strengths rather than leaning on past paradigms.\nBeing open to this new way of leading resulted in collaborative definitions of goals, objectives,\nand a robust and flexible architecture described in the previous lessons learned (4.9.3). While\nthe small community of NASA employees engaged with ISECG quickly adapted this style, it\nrepresented a cultural change within the Agency. It was not fully articulated and adapted within\nthe broader community in the short time before the Constellation Program was cancelled.\nLimiting Opportunities: The programmatic decision, described in the opening to Section 4.9,\nlimited partnership discussions to noncritical path items. This policy resulted in partnership\ndiscussions on only the later lunar exploration phase of the Program. It also created offense\nwith long-term and loyal International Partners, that NASA would not discuss future partnerships\nin the initial planning of its new exploration program.\nIn retrospect, we can pose a number of questions that challenge this policy. We do not know the\nanswers, and perhaps never will, but the questions concerning this policy are relevant to planning\nany subsequent human space flight program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDid it come about under the ISS paradigm? Did it too strongly reflect past knowledge of\nglobal space-faring capability rather than current capabilities?\nDid it weigh too strongly the problems that might arise from \xe2\x80\x9ccritical path\xe2\x80\x9d partnerships at the\nexpense of benefits? Could more have been done to avoid offending long-term international\npartners?\nCould stability have been added to the Program by allowing \xe2\x80\x9ccritical path\xe2\x80\x9d partnerships on nearterm development elements?\n\nGranted, these are retrospective questions and could be viewed as unfairly challenging what\nwas widely believed to be a wise policy at the time. We offer these as food for thought to planners\nof the next program.\nNevertheless, the Program did not achieve the benefit of stability that an international partnership\ncan provide. NASA may have been hindered by both the late recognition of the contemporary\nviews other space agencies held of themselves and the policy limiting partnership opportunities\nto noncritical-path items.\nRecommendations\nDo not \xe2\x80\x9cmanage to the last program.\xe2\x80\x9d Welcome participation by mature international partners in\nearly program formulation and seek roles for less mature partners that are consistent with their\ncapabilities and long-term interests.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n80\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\n5.0 KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE AND CONTRIBUTORS\nThe entire Constellation Program team contributed to these lessons learned, in both the content\nof Volume I Executive Summary and that of Volume II.\nAn executive review committee assisted in synthesizing the lessons learned.

The Lunar Lander Project Office (LLPO) was formed to implement a more\nstreamlined and efficient path through the project formulation phase. Key tenets of the approach\nincluded the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNASA Administrator buy-in to the approach and broad latitude to deviate from NASA policies,\nas needed\nA small, handpicked team made up of spacecraft and subsystem design experts from across\nthe Agency\nA set of guiding principles that included a small set of hard requirements and a clear goal of\ndeveloping a spacecraft specification based on an in-depth understanding of every additional\nrequirement levied\nProject start-up by collocating the multicenter team in a single facility for the first 2 months of\nthe project, which maintained that cohesiveness with regular, short-term collocated meetings\n\nLessons Learned\nA small, focused multidisciplinary in-house NASA team is a very effective way to initiate new\nprojects. The small team was able to provide Altair project insight to impact integrated lunarphase Constellation activities at very low relative cost.\nRecommendations\nNew projects should begin with a small, focused team that uses the LLPO/Altair experience as a\nbasis for initial project formulation.\n\n2.\n\nUse Models-based Systems Engineering\n\nSupports Key Finding: None; supports recommendation 4.3.3\nDriving Events\nThe Constellation Program initiated the requirements development process by determining the\ncapabilities needed from each of the systems in the architecture to accomplish the mission, and\nlevied requirements through various documents, including the CARD. As a project within a large\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n82\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nprogram, it is the responsibility of the project to implement a more detailed assessment of the\nmission to validate requirements levied on it from the program and determine whether these\nrequirements are necessary and achievable, as well as to scrutinize the mission for latent\nrequirements. The Altair project used MBSE as the approach to requirements development.\nMBSE focuses on building data models that clearly depict the operational flow of the mission.\nThese hierarchical models manage the complexity of the mission and functional allocations.\nThey make excellent integration products for a group review between different organizations for\nconsistency in assumptions. The operational models can then be analyzed to determine the\nfunctionality the vehicle must possess to enable these operations. These models are kept in the\nrequirements database for the program, and cross-references between the vehicle functions\nand mission phases in which the functions are used serve as validation of the function. Further,\nlinkages between functions and requirements that enforce them on the design provide complete\ntraceability from requirements to the concept of operations. Finally, by assigning durations to the\nactivities within the operational models, activities can be simulated to provide a complete timeline\nof the mission from the same models that are being used to establish vehicle functionality. By\ndeveloping these common products, a single model set becomes the authoritative source for the\nrequirements, functionality, and operations, thereby improving the quality of the requirements,\nintegrating the various organizations within the projects, and minimizing disconnects.\nLessons Learned\nModel-based Systems Engineering streamlines requirements development and validation by\ncultivating integrated products among the Requirements, Design, and Operations communities.\nRecommendations\nModel-based Systems Engineering should be used to provide an integrated set of products on\nwhich architecture, element, system, and subsystem requirements can be sequentially\ndecomposed.\n\n3.\n\nStart Risk-informed Design during Conceptual Design\n\nSupports Key Finding: 3.5\nDriving Events\nThe initial lunar design analysis cycle (LDAC-1) for the Altair lunar lander provided a spacecraft\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cminimum functionality.\xe2\x80\x9d Minimum function was defined to mean that the lander was\ndesigned to meet the primary key driving requirements, not the complete set of Level II Lander\nrequirements. Primarily, it meant that the vehicle and its subsystems were designed with zero\nfault-tolerance and with no consideration for contingency operations. It was understood that this\ndesign did not represent a flyable vehicle; rather, this provided a theoretical vehicle that could\nperform a lander mission if everything worked with 100% reliability, obviously an unrealistic design\npoint. However, during LDAC-2, the risks that could result in LOC failures were identified and\nprioritized, and specific vehicle, subsystem, and component trade studies were performed to\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n83\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nidentify the amount of reliability improvement needed as a function of mass of the alternatives.\nThe resulting vehicle concept was referred to as the Increased Safety vehicle. This process was\nrepeated during LDAC-3 for the LOM risks to provide the Enhanced Mission Success vehicle. A\nrisk assessment tool was developed using component failure data to quantify risk associated\nwith subsystem and component alternatives. This included reliability data from the space shuttle\nand ISS databases, the lander operational timeline to define mission phases and component\noperating times, and a vehicle preliminary hazard assessment to determine which components\ncould lead to a LOC. The term \xe2\x80\x9crisk-informed design\xe2\x80\x9d is used because the design decisions\nwere literally \xe2\x80\x9cinformed\xe2\x80\x9d by the quantified risk information instead of using a rule-based decision\nprocess. This gave the project team much greater insight into risk drivers at an early stage of\nproject development.\nLessons Learned\nA risk-informed design process provides the project with early, in-depth insight into risk drivers\nso that safety, reliability, and capability functions can be systematically added to a minimum\nfunction design baseline. This allows a more complete understanding of integrated effects on\nother primary constraints, such as spacecraft mass.\nRecommendations\nA risk-informed design process should be used early in the project formulation phase to achieve\nefficient design and understand major design drivers.\n\n4.\n\nInvolve Industry during Phase A\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nOne of the early tenets of the LLPO was to solicit input from industry throughout the project\nformulation phase. In June 2008, a little over 1 year after the LLPO was created, the office awarded\nbroad area announcement (BAA) contracts to five companies: three major traditional aerospace\ncompanies and two small, independent companies.\nThe BAA had two primary objectives. The first asked the companies to review the government\nLDAC-1 minimum-function lunar lander conceptual design and plans for implementing risk-informed\ndesign, and to provide suggested alternative design concepts. The second asked companies to\nprovide recommendations for the roles and responsibilities of government and industry for lunar\nlander development. A process was then set up whereby the companies that participated in the\nBAA and other entities meeting International Traffic in Arms [ITAR] export control regulations\ncould continually obtain updates on the government design.\nThis two-way interaction was extremely valuable to both government and industry. It provided\nthe government some important alternative perspectives and industry with information that\nhelped focus internal investment funding. The input from industry also helped shape the roles of\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n84\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nthe government and industry that were incorporated into the Altair acquisition strategy. As the\nAltair project proceeded into Phase A concept exploration and refinement, and while preparing\nfor the SRR, this two-way interaction developed a process whereby multiple contractors would\nbe integrated into the Altair team to support the work.\nThis process was the basis of a BAA contract that was in preparation for release at the time\nConstellation was cancelled. This process would have maintained government leadership of the\ndesign until a prime contractor was selected for flight vehicle development, enabling the government\nteam to develop a better Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation and allow all contractors greater\ninsight into the information that the government was using to shape the requirements. 32\nLessons Learned\nIndustry should be brought into the formulation process of a project early to ensure the NASA\nproject team is aware of alternative ideas and perspectives, and help the contractor community\nbetter understand the basis of the requirements.\nRecommendations\nWhile the acquisition model that Altair was developing may not be appropriate for widespread\napplication, the primary recommendation is that the project team should explore unique and\ncreative ways for incorporating the industry community into the project as early as possible.\n\n5.\n\nMaking Multicenter Teams Work\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.6, 3.9, 3.10\nDriving Events\nWhen Altair began as the LLPO, it collocated approximately 35 people in a single, small building\nat JSC for a period of 8 weeks. This period allowed the team to get through most of the \xe2\x80\x9cforming,\nstorming, norming,\xe2\x80\x9d and begin performing as a high-performance team before returning to home\ncenters and organizations. The project maintained team cohesiveness by planning a travel budget\nthat allowed a significant part of the team to get back together for a minimum of 3 to 4 days\nonce a quarter to work together. These periodic collocations were rotated through the centers;\nand, to the extent possible, the team stayed in the same hotels, dined together, and spent time\nsocializing. This approach ensured that the personal relationships that were initially formed were\nmaintained, and that as new members joined the team, they were more quickly assimilated. The\ninterpersonal bonds were tested as inter-center institutional competition for roles and responsibilities\nemerged; however, the strength of the team prevented impacts to progress.\n\n32\n\nThe Altair approach to NASA and industry collaboration was specifically cited as a good model by two\ncontractors responding to the Heavy Lift and Propulsion Technology Request for Information (HLPT RFI).\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n85\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nLessons Learned\nDiversity provided by a multicenter team is worth extra management effort. While teleconferences\nand Internet-assisted virtual meetings are required, the key to operating with a multicenter team\nis to periodically bring the team together to work in a single location. Regular collocations/faceto-face meetings with a significant portion of the team, including all key system, subsystem, and\ndiscipline leads, are essential to maintain team cohesiveness when using multicenter teams.\nRecommendations\nSpecific considerations that enabled the LLPO/Altair multicenter team to be highly effective\nincluded: 1) leadership of key portions of the spacecraft design and analysis was assigned to\ndifferent centers; 2) initial and subsequent collocations all included social events designed to\nallow people to get to know each other; 3) collocations were scheduled, to the maximum extent\npossible, to avoid conflicts with family vacations\xe2\x80\x94i.e., consideration was given to when K-12\nschool breaks; and 4) collocation meetings were well planned to make maximum use of the time\ntogether.\n\n6.\n\nDesign during Pre-phase A and Early Phase A\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nOne of the key initial tasks for the LLPO was to develop a preliminary in-house design within 6\nto 9 months, with emphasis on performing significant design; i.e., focus on the \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d in DAC [design\nanalysis cycle]. The design work allowed the team to validate and identify weaknesses in the\nparametric modeling. A few notable examples, as follows can illustrate this point:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe mass of the landing legs could not be easily scaled from the Apollo lunar module due to\nthe dramatic size difference between it and the hydrogen-fueled Altair. By performing\ndetailed analysis to determine the required size for stability at the bounding landing site\nterrains and then developing and analyzing a design, we were able to improve mass\nconfidence.\nAs the team used the design and began identifying assembly, integration, and test during\nboth development and operations, it identified the Constellation Program decision, which was\nmade early in LDAC-2 to increase the descent module diameter to take advantage of the 10-m\nAres V shroud, had significant implications for transportation and thermal-vacuum propulsion\nsystem testing. That assessment found the Altair descent module could not be transported\nin the NASA Guppy aircraft (the largest available) but would require barge transportation. The\nbarge would require an icebreaker to clear a path through Lake Erie during winter to perform\nan acceptance test of each descent module propulsion system in the Plumbrook Station B2\ntest facility.\n\nThese examples represent some of the more dramatic items that were revealed by allowing the\nNASA in-house team to perform significant design work during the project-formulation phase.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n86\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nLessons Learned\nDesign work during pre-phase A and early Phase A can identify important issues that cannot be\ndetermined until a design concept is of sufficient maturity to evaluate a more complete set of\ndevelopment, test, and evaluation considerations.\nRecommendations\nA design concept should be developed, as early as possible in the project formulation phase, to\nallow a more complete understand of programmatic implications. The concept needs to be more\nthan an artist rendering or a parametric design. It needs to have engineering design analysis\nsubstantiating it so that a design team is made of SMEs with the experience to foresee potential\nissues during later project phases.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n87\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nAPPENDIX B. GROUND OPERATIONS TOP LESSONS\nLEARNED\nThis Appendix contains the top lessons learned from the Constellation Ground Operations Project.\nThese are linked to main volume key findings as applicable.\n\n1.\n\nClearly Define Roles and Responsibilities within the Program/Project\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\nDriving Events\nAs discussed in the main volume, the late start of the Program relative to that of the projects led\nto unclear RR&A. Many WGs were solving the same issues in parallel with other WGs across\nthe Program (e.g., logistics). Furthermore, requirements and expectations were unclear due to\nlack of formal documentation. Some examples are provided for illustration:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBoth the Ares project and Ground Operations Project believed they were responsible for the\nprocessing timeline for operations at KSC because both had CARD requirements that were\nto be verified via the KSC processing timeline. Therefore, both organizations developed and\nmaintained what each considered the \xe2\x80\x9cConstellation Program Ground Operations Timeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese timelines were not consistent; each required a significant effort to maintain. Resolution\nof discrepancies therefore required lengthy discussion.\nManagement of integrated and stand-alone flight hardware testing at KSC (which involved/\nimpacted multiple projects) was not actively controlled at the Program. There was no consistent\ndefinition of which flight hardware testing was going to be performed at KSC.\nWhile there was sufficient participation by the projects to define what testing was required\nwithin the launch vehicle and the spacecraft during development of integrated test objectives\nby the Flight Element Integrated Test WG, there was very little (if any) analysis of the\nintegrated system to determine testing between the elements and the effects of testing on\none element with the others (e.g., integrated vehicle test, end-to-end testing).\nMaturing requirements caused significant rework and delays. For example, vehicle changes\ndrove costly changes to already designed and fabricated ground systems. Different organizations\nwere working to different vehicle configurations and technical baselines at the same time.\n\nLessons Learned\nUnclear accountability led to duplication of effort among projects. Integration of multiple projects\nmust remain the responsibility of the overarching program and not be delegated to one (or more)\nsupporting projects. The specific responsibilities of each of the projects must be clearly defined\nand socialized among and between all stakeholders to minimize confusion and inefficiency across\nthe program.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n88\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nEngineering analysis of the integrated launch vehicle and spacecraft must be performed and\nused to define integrated test objective details for testing at KSC. Program baseline synchronization\nactivities should be done periodically and often to assure that all are using the same baseline.\nRecommendations\nThe program should clearly define roles and responsibilities of the individual projects as soon as\npossible and reinforce those roles regularly, revisiting as necessary. WGs involving multiple\nprojects should be chartered at the program level with clearly defined roles and responsibilities\nto avoid duplication of effort and maintain clear accountability.\nMaintain at the program level complete responsibility for performing analytical integration for the\nentire launch vehicle and spacecraft, and determining test objectives/requirements for the overall\nintegrated vehicle.\nSynchronize vehicle and ground system design to the same baseline. Program synchronization\nwith all systems (mission systems, EVA, etc.) should be performed quarterly, at a minimum, to\nensure goals and objectives are met. No metal should be cut until simulation models and schedules\nare coordinated.\n\n2.\n\nStreamline Processes to Improve Communication Across Program/Projects\n\nSupports Key Findings: 3.9, 3.10\nDriving Events\nTwo different processes were levied for records management for the Ground Operations Project:\nthe KSC Business Records Template, governed by NPD 1441.1D; and the program \xe2\x80\x9ccatalog\xe2\x80\x9d\n(i.e., access database) with many additional attributes for program records. 33 This resulted in an\nunstructured change management process that drove costs and schedules. Because of change\nmanagement process immaturity, unfunded requirements were levied on the Ground Operations\nProject and costs were not adequately quantified. The Program created change processes\n(Change Requests, Document Change Notices [DCNs]) to expedite and document changes. The\nDCN, for instance, was intended to push through Program-level changes quickly. Instead, the\nchange processes merged into one cumbersome process that required weeks or months before\nchanges could be instituted.\nDuring change evaluations, multiple document revisions appeared during the evaluation period.\nThis caused confusion and wasted technical resources. While the Program had an approved\nformal Technical Coordination Meeting process, its application varied between Change Package\nManagers (e.g., virtual, email only, telephone only). As it was difficult to give direction to Change\nPackage Engineers, complaints were often elicited from them.\n\n33\n\nSimilar situations existed at each NASA center supporting the Constellation Program.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n89\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nAn organization-wide common process and tool for agreements regarding exchange of hardware,\nsoftware, data, etc. was not implemented until late in the Program lifetime. The Constellation\nProgram bilateral exchange agreement (BEA) tool was useful and user friendly with very\nresponsive developers; however, there was much controversy over the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cbilateral\nexchange agreement\xe2\x80\x9d (originated for agreements between countries). Further issues involved\nthe process itself, where the confusion was over whether a BEA needs to be approved prior to\ninclusion in the schedule and enforcement of the agreement (e.g., at what point and by whose\nauthority is a providing organization directed that due dates cannot change).\nLessons Learned\nThe use of new and/or different processes can add churn and reduce effective communications.\nIt is best to adopt known and proven processes for change management and standardization of\nagreements within a program. Better processes and communication will eliminate confusion and\nfrustration on agreements.\nRecommendations\nDevelop and document a robust change management process from inception that precludes levy\nof unfunded requirements.\nThe Agency should develop NASA-wide processes for records management. Implement this at\nthe start of any new program, with continuous monitoring for any new additional requirements or\nimprovements.\nCreate one change control process that can be used to make changes to project/program-level\ndocuments (minimize the number of change control processes). This will eliminate unnecessary\noverlap and confusion in the change control process. Both vehicle and ground should proceed\nfrom an agreed baseline such that all stakeholders are expeditiously notified when changes occur.\nEstablish clear and concise processes up front pertaining to agreements.\n\n3.\n\nUse a Consistent Financial Approach to Ensure Emphasis on Life-cycle\nCosts\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nThe acquisition strategy did not address program life-cycle supportability due to the late start of\nthe Program relative to that of the projects (Section 2.2.6). Each prime contractor defined lifecycle supportability strategies that were inconsistent across projects. This resulted in different\nexpectations for maintenance concepts, and support infrastructure required at the launch site.\nFurther, the involvement of all NASA centers (Section 2.2.3) and multiple contractors introduced\nconfusion, since each center/contractor used somewhat different definitions for general accounting\nterms (e.g., WYE [work year equivalent]) to characterize work content.\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n90\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nProgram requirements (formats, actions) tended to focus on cost data, while the Ground Operations\nProject focused more on obligations (which are more representative of work/content in process).\nThis difference in focus impacted the timely receipt of funding. Program shifts/adjustments\nmandated on project cost could not be reconciled/traced to NOA [new obligation authority]/\nobligations. Projects performed a thorough bottom-up estimate, significantly focusing on obligations;\nbut the same emphasis on cost is not undertaken, which leads to suboptimal communication\nwith stakeholders.\nLiens were captured as cost threats in the same manner as potential risk impacts.\nLessons Learned\nSupportability strategies and concepts for flight and ground systems must be defined early in\nthe program, as part of the acquisition strategy, and incorporated into the RFPs to influence\ndesigns and have a positive effect on program life-cycle costs.\nThe Agency, program, and projects depend on the information provided to make prudent\ndecisions. Consistent and well-defined terminology between all levels and projects, as well as\nan understanding of these definitions, would increase accuracy and efficiency in providing the\ndata and enhance analysis. Clear definitions and consistency should be used in reporting WYE\nnumbers. A properly developed and used work breakdown structure (WBS) will enhance efficiency,\nminimize errors, and lead to better analysis of work content as related to budget and schedule.\nAn increased emphasis on NOA/obligation requirements by the program would lead to a better\nunderstanding of the work/content being undertaken in relation to monetary requirements and\nschedule. An increased emphasis on cost requirements by the project would lead to a better\nability to communicate with external stakeholders by providing a more thorough and complete\nunderstanding of technical work and milestones accomplished in relation to budget and schedule.\nThe Program mixed potential risk impacts with liens/shortfalls. This turned the risk system into a\nbudget tool, which did not allow analysis of potential cost threats vs. unfunded mandates.\nRecommendations\nDevelop an acquisition strategy early in the program that includes life-cycle supportability\nstrategies and concepts prior to release of RFPs. Include strategies and concepts in the RFPs\nand ensure that if contract negotiations make any changes to one contract they are changed the\nsame way in all the contracts, as applicable. Ensure that guidance conferences emphasize the\nneed to keep supportability, logistics, and maintenance concepts the same.\nClearly define all important financial terms across the Agency and assure consistent use. Develop\nand use WBSs at a level at which financial actuals are received, characterize the work content\n(regardless of center), and reflect the planning and execution structures (e.g., by phase, etc.).\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n91\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nProgram PPBE and phasing plan requirements should include NOA/obligation requests, as\nappropriate. Project stakeholders supporting PPBE and phasing plans should forecast cost\nrequirements more thoroughly.\nCapture true risk-related cost threats as such, separating liens (i.e., change request impacts) or\nremove liens from the risk system. Financial impacts, as part of a change process, should be\naddressed on approval rather than driven into the risk system.\n\n4.\n\nImprove Interface Product Integration\n\nSupports Key Finding: Supports the data management recommendations, Section 4.3\nDriving Events\nThe following are examples of difficulties encountered in negotiating Interface Control Documents/\nInterface Requirements Documents (ICDs/IRDs):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFlexibility was not permitted in product templates for inclusion of data as tables or figures in\nlieu of verbiage, thus introducing confusion.\nThe same requirements were allocated to multiple ground and/or vehicle elements, creating\nconfusion.\nRequired drawing exchanges were not defined early in development work for the interfaces.\nIt was difficult to navigate and search interface data in the chosen document format.\nIt was difficult to obtain quick updates of approved interface data or to easily communicate\ninterface data to designers or new employees.\nInterface change impacts were not well balanced between projects. The Ares project was\noften able to implement requirements changes without showing detailed rationale illustrating\nthat several concepts had been explored.\n\nLessons Learned\nFlexibility in product templates (ICD/IRD), tailored for each interface, can improve the outcome\nof the interface.\nReal dimensional measurements are needed in the ICDs to control the design on both sides of\nthe interface properly.\nA single neutral party should manage the project-to-project interfaces. Each project should be\nresponsible for bringing forward full and consistent change packages to the Interface Manager\nfor discussion prior to implementation.\nRecommendations\nAllow the interface team to define the most effective template (this may be unique for each\ninterface). Organize interfaces by project, and allow projects to sub-allocate requirements.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n92\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nA Website site navigable by a graphical representation of the vehicle and ground should be\nused to specify all data for each interface, with requirements generated from a requirements\ndatabase.\nDefine standard drawing/model exchanges early on in the development work for the interface.\nUse a controlled-access Website to specify all data for each interface (similar to system used by\nshuttle). Provide easy navigation to interface data: requirements, drawings, etc.\nProvide real dimensional measurements in the ICDs.\nEach project should have an office dedicated to interface management. The project-to-project\ninterface requirements baseline should be controlled by a neutral board/unbiased interface\nmanagement group, and not at the project-to-project level.\n\n5.\n\nAddress Logistics and Supportability in a Consistent Manner\n\nSupports Key Finding: None\nDriving Events\nAs discussed in the main volume, projects initiated contracts prior to formation of the Program.\nThese organizations were not mature enough to adequately specify logistics and supportability\nrequirements. Logistics tools for the Orion and Ares projects were developed independently from\nthe Ground Operations Project with the end result being different final products. The Ground\nOperations Project participated in the WGs for both Orion and Ares. It became evident, in\nworking with the contractors, that the supportability requirements and direction levied on the\ncontractors was not the same. This caused both groups to rework some products to allow them\nto interface with each other.\nA comparison was done between the Program supportability plan and the project supportability\nplan to map requirements between documents. Gaps and disconnects were uncovered between\nthe plans.\nLessons Learned\nCritical logistics data items such as source maintainability and recoverability code charts need\nto be common across projects to facilitate parts transfer.\nEnsuring continuity between parent-child documents is important to prevent confusion about\nrequirements.\nMismatched logistics requirements included in projects RFPs caused rework later while trying to\nalign acquisition/performance guidance between projects.\nAdditional supportability requirements that affect life-cycle costs need to be defined in programlevel requirements documentation. Life-cycle costs are affected by supportability factors such as\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n93\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\ncommonality and interchangeability. If these factors are not stated as requirements, the design\norganization is not compelled to incorporate revisions or suggestions (guidance) into the design.\nRecommendations\nIdentify essential logistics infrastructure data items that need to be common across projects,\nand specify data items in a program requirements document.\nEnsure that the program-level supportability plan is used as a parent document when creating\nproject-level plans, and routinely perform a gap analysis between the parent-child documents.\nDevelop a standard set of supportability requirements to be applied to all projects prior to contract\ninitiation.\nPerformance requirements can be traded against other logistics and supportability\nrequirements for the system so the program will have a more accurate assessment of life-cycle\ncosts vs. system performance.\n\nVolume 2 \xe2\x80\x93 DAA Final Review\n\n94\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume II\n\nAPPENDIX C.
