PROGRAMS\nTIROS\nThe TIROS (Television and Infra-Red Observation Satellite) system and its successor, TOS\n(TIROS Operational System), the ITOS (Improved TIROS Operational System) system, and\nTIROS-N, the current operational system, have been the principal global operational meteor_,\n\nological satellite systems for the United States over the past 20 years.\nlaunch dates, orbits, and

de-\n\nvelopment program, marked by the successful mission of TIROS-I in April 1960 (Allison and\nNeil, 1962).\n\nA semi-operational system soon evolved in which, nine additional TIROS\n\nsatellites were successfully launched in the period from 1960 to 1965.\n\nEach TIROS satellite\n\ncarried a pair of miniature television cameras and in approximately half of the missions a\nscanning infrared radiometer and an earth radiation budget instrument were included with the\ninstrument complement.\n\nESSA\nThe commitment to provide routine daily worldwide observations without interruption in\ndata was fulfilled by the introduction of the TIROS Operational System (TOS) in February\n1966. This system employed a pair of ESSA (Environmental Science Services Administration)\nsatellites, each configured for its specific mission. Through their on-board data storage systems,\nthe odd-numbered satellites (ESSA 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) provided global weather data to the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\'s CDA (Command and Data Acquisition) stations in Wallops Island,\nVa., and Fairbanks, Alaska, and then relayed to the National Environmental Satellite Service at\nSuitland, Maryland, for processing and forwarding to the major forecasting centers, of the United\nStates and to nations overseas. The even-numbered group of satellites (ESS)_ 2, 4, 6, 8)\nprovided direct real-time readout of their APT (Automatic Picture Transmission) television\n\nTable !\nU.S. M,\neteoro!ogica!Satellite Profanes\nhloll.\nName\n\nPe od\nLaunched {Mm)\n\nPergee\n!km)\n\n,_poqee nation\nIkm)\n(0eg!\n\nr ROSI\n\n0!APR60\n\n9_.2\n\n79\xc2\xa7\n\nTIROS II\n\n23NOV60\n\n98,3\n\n717\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 837\n\n867"\n\nTIROS I1!\n\n12JUL61\n\n100.4\n\n8_4\n\nTIBO$ IV\n\nqeFEB62\n\nQO.4\n\nTIROS V\n\n19JUN62\n\nTIROS v\n\nllISEP62\n\nTIROS V,\n\n4_13\n\n,;\nRema!k_\nI TV.WA and1 TV _A\n\n\'_8.5\n\nI TV.WA, 1TV.I_A. passive aclive IR scan\n_\n\n837\n\n47`.8_\n\n2 TV-WA.HI_.

Nine ESSA satellites were successfully\nlaunched between 1966 and 1969. One of them, ESSA-8,remained in operation until March\n1976. Larger television cameras (2.54cm vidicon) developed for the Nimbus satellite program\nwere adapted for use on the ESSA series, providing a significant increase in the quality of the\ncloud cover pictures over that obtained from the earlier TIROS cameras, which used a 1.27cm\nvidicon(Schwalband Gross, 1969).\nITOS\nThe second decade of meteorological satellites was introduced by the successful orbiting\non January 23, 1970, of ITOS-I,* the second-generation operational weather satellite. This\nsatellite dramatically surpassed the capabilities of the predecessor ESSA satellites, moving rapidly\ncloser toward the objectives of the U.S. National Operational Meteorological Satellite System.\nITOS-I provided in a single spacecraft the"combined capability of two ESSA spacecraft-the\n\ndirect\n\nreadout APT system, and the global stored images of the AVCS system. Additionally, ITOS-1 provided, for the first time, day-and-night radiometric data in real time, as well as stored data, for\nlater playback. Global observation of the earth\'s cloud cover was provided every 12 hours with\nthe single ITOS spacecraft as compared to every 24 hours with two of the ESSA satellites. A\nsecond ITOS spacecraft, NOAA-1 (ITOS-A), was launched on December 11, 1970.\nAs the ITOS system evolved to become the ITOS-D system, the flexibility inherent in the\nspacecraft design permitted a broader and more sophisticated array of environmental sensors to\nbe carried, with only minor changes to the spacecraft. This new sensor complement provided\nday-and-night imaging by means of Very High Resolution Radiometers (VHRR\'s) and medium\nresolution Scanning Radiometers (SR\'s) (Conlan, 1973). It included Vertical Temperature Profile\nRadiometers (VTPR\'s) for temperature soundings of the atmosphere and a Solar Proton Monitor\n\n*This spacecraft was originally designated TIROS-M. After being placed into orbit, it was redesignated ITOS-1.\nSubsequent spacecraft in this series were named NOAA-1, NOAA-2, etc. by the National Ocean and Atmospheric\nAdministration, the successor to ESSA as operator of the system.\n\n3\n\n(SPM) for measurements of proton and electron flux. Six spacecraft (ITOS-D, E-2, F, G, H,\nand I) were planned for the ITOS-D series. NOAA-2 (ITOS-D), the first satellite in this series,\nwas successfully launched on October 15, 1972. Three additional satellites of this type (NOAA3, NOAA-4, and NOAA-5) were placed into orbit in 1973, 1974, and 1976, respectively\n(Fortuna and Hambrick, 1974). Due to the longevity experienced in orbit by the ITOS!NOAA\nsatellites. ITOS E-2 and I launches were cancelled. The ITOS system, as it matured, brought\ncloser the realization of the goals of the U.S. National Operational System.\nThe ITOS satellite system evolved from the proven technology of the TIROS and ESSA\nspacecraft.\n\nMany devices and techniques employed on the earlier series were enhanced, and\n\nthe enhanced versions were used on the ITOS spacecraft. This orderly evolution permitted\ngrowth from a spin-stabilized spacecraft to a 3-axis stabilized earth-oriented despun platform.\nThe principal objectives of this growth pattern during the evolvement from an R&D\nsatellite to a global operational system were improved performance, the provision for increased\nquality and more frequent acquisition of meteorological data, and more timely dissemination of\nthe processed data to the users. The evolving system had to be compatible with the global\nground network of local receiving stations as well as the two principal command-and-data acquisition sites. Finally, the operational system had to be cost-effective and have the capacity for\nfuture growth.\n\nTIROS-N\nThe third-generation operational polar-orbiting environmental satellite system, designated\nT1ROS-N, completed development and was placed into operational service in 1978. Eight spacecraft in this series wil! provide gJobal observational service from 1978 through 1984. This new\nseries has a new complement of data-gathering instruments. One of these instruments, the Advanced\nVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), will increase the amount of radiometric information\nfor more _ccurate sea-surface temperature mapping and identification of snow and sea ice, in\n\n4\n\n- "\n\naddition to day-and-night imaging in the visible and infrared bands. Other instruments, contained\nin a subsystem known as the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), will provide impro_ced\nvertical sounding of the atmosphere. These instruments are the High Resolution Infrared Radiation\n"\n\nSounder (HIRS/2), the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), and the Microwave Sounding Unit\n(MSU). A Data Collection System (DCS) will receive environmental data from fixed or moving platforms such as buoys or balloons and retain it for transmission to the ground stations. A Solar Environmental Monitor is included to measure proton, electron, and alpha particle densities for solar\ndisturbance prediction (Hussey, 1979). Figure 2 depicts the evolution of the TIROS-ESSA-ITOSNOAA family of satellites.\nThe TIROS-ESSA-ITOS-NOAA spacecraft series was designed and built by RCA AstroElectronics under the technical management of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nGoddard Space Flight Center, and procured (operational series) and operated by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nNIMBUS\nThe Nimbus satellite program was initiated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the early 1960\'s to develop an observational system capable of meeting the research\nand development needs of the nation\'s atmospheric and earth scientists.\nThe general objectives of the program were: (1) to develop advanced passive radiometric\nand spectrometric sensors for daily global surveillance of the earth\'s atmosphere and thereby provide a data base for long-range weather forecasting; (2) to develop and evaluate new active and\npassive sensors for sounding the earth\'s atmosphere and mapping surface characteristics (Press\nand Huston, 1968); (3) to develop advanced space technology and ground techniques for\nmeteorological and other earth-observational spacecraft; (4) to develop new techniques and\nknowledge useful for the exploration of other planetary atmospheres; (5)to participate in global\nobservation programs (World Weather Watch) by expanding daily global weather observation\n\ncapability (National Research Council, 1978); and (6) to provide a supplemental source- of op,er,\national meteorological data.\nf_\n\nThe Nimbus System was designated to be (l) the test bed for advanced instruments for\nthe future operational TIROS polar-orbiting satellites and (2) the research system for remote\nsensing and data collection.\n\nThe Nimbus spacecraft system was developed under NASA/GSFC\n\nmanagement, with the General Electric Company as the spacecraft integration contractor.\n\nRCA,\n\nHughes, ITT, T.I., and a number of other companies and universities provided sensors and data\nprocessing and storage equipment for the Nimbus series. The project has matured to become\nthe nation\'s principal satellite program for remote-sensing research. Each new satellite in the\nNimbus series has represented significant growth in sophistication, complexity, weight, capability,\nand performance.\n\nA total of seven Nimbus spacecraft was successfully placed into orbit from 1964 through\n1978 (Staff Members, 1965). The final spacecraft, Nimbus 7, was launched in No_zember t978.\nThis spacecraft was instrumented with sensors to monitor the atmospheric pollutants, oceanography, and weather and climate ,(Figure 3) (Staff Members, Goddard Space Flight Center\n1976, Vostreys and ttorowitz, 1979). The payload consisted of eight instruments:\n1. Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)--Measures radiances in five\nwavelengths and ten channels to extract informa:tion on sea surface roughness and wind-so\n,sea\nsurface temperature, cloud liquid water content, total water vapor content, precipitation (mean\ndroplet size), soil moisture, snow couer, and sea ice.\n2. Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (SAMS)--Measures .vertical concentrations of H20\nN20, metilane\n\n(CH 4),\n\ncarbon monoxide :(CO), and nitric oxide (NO); measures :tempera_tureof\n\nstratosphere to "_90km and trace constituenl:s.\n3. Solar-Backscattered Ultraviole.tiTo,tal Ozone Mapping System ,(SB UV/TOMSJ-Measures\ndirect and backscattered solar UV to extract ingormation on variations of solar if, adiance,, vertical\ndistribution of ozone and total ozone on a global Oasis.\n6\n\n4. Earth Radiation Budget (ERB)-Measures\n\nshort- and longwave upwelling radiances and\n\nfluxes and direct solar irradiance to extract information on the solar constant, earth albedo,\nemitted longwave radiation, and the anisotropy of the outgoing radiation.\n5. Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS)-Measures chlorophyll concentration, sediment\ndistribution, gelbstoff (yellow substance) concentration as a salinity indicator, and temperature\nof coastal waters and open ocean.\n6. Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement H Experimen t (SAM II)-Measures the concentration\nand optical properties of stratospheric aerosols as a function of altitude, latitude, and longitude.\nTropospheric aerosols can be mapped also if no clouds are present in the IFOV.\n7. Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer Experiment (THIR)-Measures the infrared\nradiation from the earth in two spectral bands (11 and 6.7_tm) both day and night to provide\npictures of cloud cover, three-dimensional maps of cloud cover, temperature maps of clouds,\nland and ocean surfaces, and atmospheric moisture.\n8. Limb Infrared Monitoring of the Stratosphere Experiment (LIMS)-Makes\n\na global survey\n\nof selected gases from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere. Inversion techniques are\nused to derive gas concentrations and temperature profiles.\n\nATS, APPLICATIONS TECHNOLOGY SATELLITE\nThe increased launch vehicle capabilities available during the middle 1960\'s permitted\nsatellites to be placed at geostationary altitudes and thus provided atmospheric scientists with\na new dimension in observations, namely: continuous observations of almost one-third of the\nearth\'s surface. A NASA research program involving geostationary satellites was implemented in\nthe Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) series. Although primarily designed to demonstrate\ncommunications satellite technology, several of the ATS series carried high-resolution cameras\nfor atmospheric observation.\n\n- - .-..,\n\n--.\n\n....\n\nOff-Decem_r-_7,_:,1966,ATS-1 was placed into geostationary orbit. One function of this\n\nk\n\ntechnology satellite was to demonstrate the capability of providing a picture of the western\nhemisphere every 20 minutes through_the use of a spin-scan camera. Useful data was provided\nfrom approximately 55\xc2\xb0N to 55\xc2\xb0S latitude.\n\nThe ability to receive sequential photographs of\n\nthe same area improved the possibility of early detection of severe storms and tornadoes, and\nprovided real-time data of cloud and frontal movements.\n\nA second technology satellite, ATS-3, was launched November 1967. This satellite, using\na multispectral spin-scan camera, returned the first color images of the full earth disc. Copies\nof these pictures have been used for many applications in addition to meteorology.\n\nATS-1.and\n\nATS-3 were developed by NASA GSFC, with Hughes Aircraft as the prime contractor (Suomi\nand Vonder Haar, 1969).\n\nThe performance history of the Nimbus and ATS technology satellites is shown in Figure 4.\n\nSMS/GOES (OPERATIONAL GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE)\nThe successful application of atmospheric observations from geostationary altitudes led to\nNASA\'s development of a satellite designed specifically for that purpose. This satellite, the\nSMS/GOES, was designed and integrated by the Aeronutronic Ford Corporation\'s Western Development Laboratories.\n\nNASA\'s prototype SynchronOus Meteorological Satellite, SMS-1, was\n\nsuccessfully launched in May 1974. Placed over the equator at 45\xc2\xb0W longitude, it provided continuous hemispheric coverage. The principal instrument for SMSis a 16-inch aperture telescope\nfor visible and infrared scanning. Built by the Santa Barbara Research Center and called VISSR\n\n"\n\n(Visible and lnfrared Spin Scan Radiometer), tMs sensor permits day and night observation of\nclouds and the determination of teinperatures, clt_ud heights, and wind fields (Johnson, 1979).\nThe SMS also relays data received from remotely located data collection platforms such as\nriver gauges, ocean buoys, ships, balloons, and aircraft.\n\n8\n\nIts space environmental monitor\n\n"\n\n(consisting of an X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor, and a magnetometer) detects unusual solar activity, such as flares, and measures the flow of electron and proton energy and\nthe changes in the geomagnetic field.\n\nObservation and forecasting of atmospheric phenomena\n\nnot specifically related to meteorology are thus possible on an operational basis (Corbell et al.,\n1976).\n\nFour additional satellites of the SMS design have been launched:\n\nSMS-2 on February 6,\n\n1975; the first operational version, GOES-1 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite),\non October 16, 1975; GOES-2 on June 16, 1977; and GOES-3 in June 1978.\n\nThese opera-\n\ntional satellites are owned and operated by NOAA. The SMS/GOES satellite history is depicted\nin Figure 5.\n\nThe SMS/GOES satellites have been maneuvered to various stations to optimize the\ndata and support special tasks.\n\nThe following is the disposition of SMS/GOES as of May\n\n1980.\n\nSMS-1 is at 130\xc2\xb0W longitude, and SMS-2 is at 75\xc2\xb0W.\nVISSR is inoperative.\n\nGOES-I is at 900W, but the\n\nGOES-2 is at 105\xc2\xb0W and GOES-3 is located at 135\xc2\xb0W longitude.\n\nGOES-2 is being used to relay weather products to this hemisphere and to assist underdeveloped countries in the receipt of processed satellite data.\n\nTIROS-N SPACECRAFT SYSTEM\nThe following section contains a more technical description of the TIROS-N system.\n\nTable 2\nTIROS-N spacecraft System\nTIROS-N]NOAA A-G:\n\n(See Figure 6)\n\nProtoflight, NASA funded\nFollow-on flights (7) are NOAA funded\n\nGround Station:\n\nNOAA funded and operated\n\nLaunch:\n\nNOAA!NASA funded; USAF managed (Atlas E!F\nvehicles) Launched from Western Test Range, Lompoc,\nCalifornia on October 13, 1978\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nOrbit\nnear polar, sun-synchronous\n833 or 870 km (450 n. mi.; 470 n.mi.)\n102 minute period\nmorning descending or afternoon ascending\xe2\x80\xa2\nPhysical\nweight - 1421 kg (3127 lbs)\npayload weight - 194 kg (427 lbs)\nsize -\n\nlength - 3.71 meters (146 inches)\ndiameter - 1.88 meters (74 inches)\nsolar array - 11.6 square meters (125 sq ft)\n\nDesign Lifetime\n2 years\n\nManufacturer:\n\nRCA, Hightstown, New Jersey (except for sensors)\n\nSpecial Services:\n\nRealtime transmission of sensor data to a wide\nrange of users worldwide.\nttigh Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) Service\nAutomatic Picture Transmission (APT) Service\nDirect Sounder Transmission (DST) Service\n\nTIROS-N INSTRUMENTS\nAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)\nThe Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for TIROS-N (Schwalb; 1978) and four\nfollow-on satellites will be four channel scanning radiometers, sensitive to visible/near IR and infrared\n\nl0\n\n_\n\n(IR) radiation. The instrument channelization (Table 3) has been chosen to permit multispectral\nanalyses which are expected to provide improved determination of hydrologic, oceanographic, and\nmeteorological parameters. The visible (0.6pm) and visible/near IR (0.9#m) channels are used to discern clouds, land-water boundaries, snow and ice extent, and when the data from the two \xe2\x80\xa2channels\nare compared, an indication of ice/snow melt inception. The IR window channels are used to measure\ncloud distribution and to determine temperature of the radiating surface (cloud or surface). Data from\nthe two IR channels will be incorporated into the computation of sea surface temperature. By using\nthese two data sets, it is possible to remove an ambiguity introduced by clouds filling a portion of the\nfield-of-view. On later instruments in the series, a third IR channel will add the capability for removing radiant contributions from water vapor when determining surface temperatures. Prior to inclusion\nof this third channel, corrections for water vapor contributions will be based on statistical means using\nclimatological estimates of water vapor content.\nTIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS)\nThe TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) system consists of three separate and\nindependent instruments, the data from which may be combined for computation of atmospheric\ntemperature profiles. The three instruments are:\na. The High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS)\nb. The Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU)\nc. The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)\nThe TOVS has been designed so that the acquired data will permit calculation of (1) tempera,\n\nture profiles from the surface to 10rob, (2) water vapor content at three levels of the atmosphere,\nand (3) total ozone content.\n\nHigh Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS]2)\nThe High Resolution Infrared Radiation SOunder (HIRS/2) is an adaptation of the HIRS!1\ninstrument designed for and flown on the NIMBUS 6 satellite.

This cross-track scan, combined with the\nsatellite\'s motion in orbit, provides coverage of a major portion of the Earth\'s surface.\nThe energy received by the telescope is separated by a dichroic beam-splitter into longwave\n(above 6.4#m) energy and shortwave (below 6.4/xm) energy, controlled by field stops and passed\nthrough bandpass filters and relay optics to the detectors. In the shortwave path, a second dichroic\nbeam-splitter transmits the visible channel to its detector. Essential parameters of the instrument\nare shown in Table 4. Primary system components include:\na. Scan system\nb. Optics, including filter wheel\nc. Radiant cooler and detectors\nd. Electronics and data handling\ne. Mechanics\n\nStratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU)\nThe Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) is supplied by the United Kingdom Meteorological\nOffice. It employs a selective absorption technique to make measurements in three channels. The\nprinciples of operation are based on the selective chopper radiometer flown on Nimbus 4 and 5,\nand the Pressure Modulator Radiometer (PMR) flown on the Nimbus 6. Basic characteristics are\nshown in Table 5.\nThe SSU makes use of the pressure modulation technique to measure radiation emitted from\ncarbon dioxide at the top of the Earth\'s atmosphere.\n\nA cell of CO2 gas in the instrument\'s op-\n\ntical path has its pressure changed (at about a 40Hz rate) in a cyclic manner. The spectral\n\n13\n\ncharacteristics of the channel and, therefore, the height of the weighting function is then deter,\nmined by the pressure in the cell during the period of integration.\n\nBy using three cells filled\n\nat different pressures, weighting functions peaking at three different heights can be obtained.\nThe primary objective of the instrument is to obtain data from which stratospheric (25-50km)\ntemperature profiles can be determined. This instrument will be used in conjunction with the\nHIRS/2 and MSU to determine temperature profiles from the surface to the 50 km level.\nInstrument Operation\n\'I\'he single primary telescope with its 10\xc2\xb0 IFOV is step scanned perpendicular to the subpoint track.\n\nEach scan line is composed of eight individual 4.0 second steps and requires a total\n\nof 32 seconds, including mirror retrace.\n\nTable 4\nHIRS/2 System Parameters\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nCalibration\n\nStable Blackbodies (2) and Space Background\n\nCross-Track Scan\n\n+49.5 \xc2\xb0 (-+1120kin)\n\nScan Time\n\n6.4 Seconds\n\nNumber of Steps\n\n56\n\nOptical FOV\n\n1.25\xc2\xb0\n\nStep Angle\n\n1.8\xc2\xb0\n\nStep Time\n\n100 Milliseconds\n\nGround IFOV (Nadir)\n\n17.4kin Diameter\n\nGround IFOV (End of Scan)\nDistance Between IFOV\'s\n\n58.5km Cross-Track by 29.9km Along-Track\n42km Along-Track\n\nData Rate\n\n2880 Bits!Second\n\nDectors:\n\nLong Wave\nShort Wave\nVisible\n\nHgCdTe\nInSb\nSilicon\n\n14\n\nTable 5\nSSU Characteristics\nChannel\nNumber\n\nCentral\nWave No.\n(cm-1 )\n\nCell\nPressure\n(mb)\n\nPressure of Weighting Function Peak\nmb\n\nkm\n\n.\n\n,,\n\ni\n\n668\n\n100\n\n15\n\n29\n\n2\n\n668\n\n35\n\n5\n\n37\n\n3\n\n668\n\n10\n\n1.5\n\n45\n\nCalibration\n\nStable Blackbody and Space\n\nAngular Field-of-View\n\n10\xc2\xb0\n\nGround IFOV - Nadir\n\n147.3 km\n\nNumber of Earth Views/Line\n\n8\n\nTime Interval Between Steps\n\n4 Seconds\n\nTotal Scan Angle\n\n-+40 from Nadir\n\xc2\xb0\n\nScan Time\n\n32 Seconds\n\nData Rate\n\n480 Bits/Second\n\nDetector\n\nTGS Pyroelectric\n\nThe SSU uncooled pyroelectric detectors integrate the radiance in each channel for 3.6\nseconds during each step.

The instrument, which is being\n-\n\nbuilt by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, is a 4-channel\nDicke radiometer making passive measurements in 4 regions of the 5.5mm oxygen region.

The ARGOS provides a means for obtaining environmental (e.g., temperature, pressure, altitude, etc.) data, and earth location from fixed or\nmoving platforms.\n\nLocation information, where necessary, may be computed by differential\n\ndoppler techniques using data obtained from the measurement of platform carrier frequency as\nreceived on the satellite. When several measurements are received during a given contact with a\nplatform, location can be determined.\n\nThe environmental data messages sent by the platform\n\nt}\n\nwill vary in length depending on the type of platform and its purpose. The ARGOS (DCS) system consists of three major components:\na. Terrestrial platforms\nb. On-board instrument\nc. Processing center\nPlatforms\nThe terrestrial platforms may be developed by the user to meet his particular needs so long as it\nmeets the interface criteria defined by CNES. Before being accepted for entry into the system, the\nplatform design must be certified as meeting these criteria. By international agreement, entry into the\nsystem is limited to platforms requiring location service or for those situated in polar regions out of\nthe range of the DCS on geostationary satellites. General platform criteria are shown in Table 7.\nOn-board Instrument\nThe on-board instrument is designed to receive the incoming platform data, demodulate the\nincoming signal, and measure both the frequency and relative time of occurrence of each transmission. The on-board system consists of three modules: the power supply and command interface units, the signal processor, and the redundant receiver and search units.\nPlatform signals are received by the receiver, search unit at 401.65 MHz. Since it is possible\nto acquire more than one simultaneous transmission, four processing channels [called Data Recovery Units (DRU)] operate in parallel. Each DRU consists of a phase lock loop, a bit synchronizer, doppler counter, and a data formatter.\n\nAfter measurement of the doppler frequency,\n\n17\n\nthe sensor data are formatted with other internally generated data and the output transferred to\na buffer interface with the spacecraft data processor (TIP). The DCS output data rate is controlled to 720 bits per second.\nTable 7\nARGOS Platform Characteristics\nCarrier Frequency\n\n401.650MHz\n\nAging (During Life)\n\n-+2kHz\n\nShort Term Stability (100ms)\n\n1: 109 (Platform Requiring Location)\n1:108 (Platform Not Requiring Location)\n\nMedium Term Stability (20 min)\nLong Term (2 hr)\n\n:0.2Hz/min (Requiring Location)\n:+400Hz\n\nPower Out: 34.8dbm (3W) Nominal\nRange During Transmission\n(Stability)\n\n:0.5 db\n\nAntenna:: Vertical Linear Polarization\nMessage Length: 360ms to 920ms\nRepetition Period for Message:\n\n40-60 sec (Requiring Location)\n60-200 sec (Not Requiring.

Total Energy Detector (TED)\nb. Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED)\nc. High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD)\nThis instrument is a follow-on to the Solar Proton Monitor (SPM) flown on the ITOS series\nof NOAA satellites. The new instrument modifies the SPM capabilities and adds the monitorr\n\ning of high energy protons and alpha flux. The package also includes a monitor of total energy\ndeposition into the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe instrument will augment the measurements already\n\nbeing made by NOAA\'s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES).\n\nTotal Energy Detector (TED)\nThe TED uses a curved plate analyzer and channeltron detector to determine the intensity\nof particles in the energy bands from 0.3KeV to 20KeV. Four curved plate analyzers (two measuring electrons, two protons) measure incoming particles reaching the instrument.\n\nMedium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED)\nThe MEPED senses protons, electrons, and ions with energies from 30KeV to greater than\n60 MeV. This instrument is comprised of four directional solid-state detector telescopes and one\nomni-directional sensor. All five components use solid-state nuclear detectors.\n\nOutputs from the\n\ndetectors are connected to a signal analyzer which senses and logically selects those events which\nexceed specific threshold values.\n\nHigh Energy Proton-Alpha Detector (HEPAD)\nThe HEPAD senses protons and alphas from about 370MeV to greater than 850MeV. The\ninstrument is essentially a Cerenkov detector.\n\nThe Cerenkov crystal is installed within a telescope\n\nin association with two solid-state detectors; the telescope is shielded to establish the instrument\'s\nfield,of-view.\n\n19\n\nThe .NOAA F and G spacecraft (Fig. 7) will be equipped with the SBUV (Solar Backscatter\nUltraviolet Instrument) and the ERBE (Earth Radiation Budget Experiment).\n\nThese instruments\n\nwill be used to measure the earth\'s ozone and radiation to and from the earth\'s atmosphere.\n\nTHE EARTH RADIATION BUDGET EXPERIMENT (ERBE)\nThe requirements for the ERBE were specified to overcome the previous problems of existing radiation budget observations (Currata, ! 980). The experiment incorporates three sets of\nradiometers on different satellite platforms.\n\nTwo of the satellites are the sun-synchronous\n\nTIROS-N/NOAA satellites with differing equatorial crossing times. The third satellite is the\nmedium inclination (i __46) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS). This satellite is to be\nShuttle launched.\n\nThe medium inclination orbit can be accomodated with a Shuttle launch from\n\nthe Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is anticipated that a payload will be scheduled to fully\nutilize the Shuttle capabilities permitting the launch of other free fl_cingsatellites or onboard\n(Spacelab) experiments which are compatible with this orbital inclination.\n\nThe free flyer will\n\nbe lifted from the pallet by the articulated arm. While still attached, the entire system including\ninstruments and spacecraft will be checked. Once free of the environment of the Shuttle, onboard thrusters will propel the ERBS spacecraft to the nominal 600kin altitude orbit.\nThe 600kin orbit and the 460 inclination will provide an orbital precession rate relative to\nthe earth-sun vector of better than 180\xc2\xb0 per month.\n\nThis precession rate will permit a minimum\n\nof one observation per hour angle per month for each 1000km by 1000 km area in the tropics\nand much better sampling at mid-latitudes.\n\nThe combination of ERBS and the near-polar orbit,\n\ning satellites will provide a large number of samples uniformly distributed in space and time\npermitting higher precision and less biased estimates of the monthly averaged radiation budget\ncomponents.\n\nThe instrumentation to be used for the radiation budget observations consists of two parts:\na fixed field of view section and a scanner section. An artist\'s co_)cept of the instrumentation\n20\n\non the ERBS is illustrated in Fig. 8. The fixed field of view section has 5 radiometers, 4 earth\nviewing and one shuttered sun viewing. The earth viewing radiometers consist of pairs of broadband (0.2 to 50 + gm wavelength) and shortwave (0.2 to 5#m wavelength) detectors.\n\nThe two\n\nspectral bands are also represented by two different instantaneous fields of view, one of which\nviews the entire earth from limb to limb while the other has a restricted field of view with a\n"foot print" of approximately 1000 km.\nt_\n\nBoth of these radiometers have cosine law detectors.\n\nThe wide field of view radiometers\n\nbecause of their cosine response and nadir viewing direction, measure the flux of upwelling radiation from the observable earth at satellite altitude.\n\nThese flux measurements will be used in\n\naccurately determining the global radiation energy balance and its variation with season. These\nobservations of the fluxes at satellite altitude are the only earth flux observations which do not\nrequire knowledge of the angular nature of the radiation leaving the earth.\n\nTo meet the scienti-\n\nfic requirements of the ERBS, transformation procedures must be defined to change the observations into the scientifically useable product.\nThe solar observations will be made with a cavity radiometer, based on the technology of\nthe Solar Maximum Mission. This type of detector will provide periodic observations of the\nsun to extend the period of solar observations and will also serve as a secondary standard\nthrough simultaneous solar observations with the cavity radiometer and all the earth viewing\ndetectors.\nThe separate scanning instrument consists of shortwave, longwave and broadband channels\nwhich scan perpendicular to the velocity vector of the spacecraft.\n\nThe instantaneous fields of\n\nview of the scanning channels are 3\xc2\xb0 . Calibration of these channels will take place both through\nobservation of an internal blackbody source and observations of a diffuser plate exposed to\ndirect sunlight. The specifications of the ERBE instrumentation were developed with the cooperation of a number of scientists at NASA, NOAA/NESS and several universities. The\n\n21\n\nimplementation of the scientific objectives of the ERBS will be carried forward by a team of\nscientists recently selected through an Announcement of Opportunity procedure.\nThe ERBS will carry two instruments in addition to the ERBE scanner and nonscanner. One\ninstrument is the SAGE-II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) instrument which will\nprovide observations of the stratospheric aerosols, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. Both ozone and\nstratospheric aerosols are thought to have an effect on the earth\'s radiatiOn budget .and in turn,\nare thought to be affected by the magnitudes of the shortwave and longwave fluxes passing through\nthe atmosphere. This is particularly true following major volcanic eruptions which inject particulates and gases into the stratosphere. The ERBS instruments and the SAGE-II instrument will be\nused in climate studies of the interrelationships between the earth radiation budget, stratospheric\naerosols and ozone. The second additional instrument on ERBS is the Halogen OccUltation Experiment (HALOE) instrument.\n\nThis instrument is part of a study of environmental quality and files\n\non ERBS as a satellite of opportunity.\n\nVAS\nGOES-D,\n\nE and F, which will be launched in the early and mid-1980\'s will carry the VAS\n\n(Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer Atmospheric Sounder). This is an advanced version of\nthe Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) developed for world-widegeostationary\nmeterological satellite systems. The VISSRis a dual-band (visibleand infrared) spin-scanimaging device utilized for clayand night, two-dimensional,cl\'oud cover pictures. The VAS retains\ntile VISSRdual-band imaging function. However,the infrared channel capabilities have been\nexpanded using a more complex detector configuration together with selectable narrow-band\noptical filters. The additional spectral bands provided are sensitive to tile effects of atmospheric\nconstituents which makes it possible to determine not only the surface and cloud\'top temperatures, as in VISSR, but also the three-dimensionalstructure of the atmospheric temperature\nand water vapor distribution.\n\n22\n\nThe VAS system consists of a Scanner which contains a telescope assembly, and a separate\nElectronic Module. The telescope assembly is a 40.6cm (16.0-inch) diameter aperture optical\nsystem with an object-space scan mirror for accomplishing the N-S step scan (Staff Members,\n1980(a)). The complete Scanner contains:\n1. A position-controlled object-space scan mirror\n2. A Ritchey-Chretien primary collecting optics subassembly\n3. A set of secondary optics, optical filters, detectors and preamplifers for the visible\nand infrared channels\n4. A two-stage radiation cooler for passively cooling the infrared channel detectors\n5. A separate optical focus drive assembly for the visible and the infrared channel\n6. Two (a primary and redundant) scan milTor drive motor and optical position angle\nencoder subassemblies\n7. An optical subassembly with reduced size aperture to permit an inflight radiometric\ncheck-of-calibration of the visible channels on the sun\n8. A temperature monitored, heatable, calibration blackbody and motor drive/shutter\nsubassembly to permit an inflight radiometric calibration of the infrared channels\n9. Eighteen scanner temperature sensors\n10. A scan mirror stow (electromagnet latch) subassembly\n11. High voltage power supplies for the visible channel detectors\n12. A temperature-controlled\n\ntwelve-position spectral filter wheel assembly for selecting\n\nthe infrared optical passband.\nThe VAS has six infrared detectors.\n\nTwo have a subpoint resolution of 6.9 km (IGFOV of\n\n0.192x0.192 mr) and are used primarily for imaging. Four have a resolution of 13.8 km (IGFOV\n\n23\n\nof 0.384x0.384mr)\n\nand are used for sounding information.\n\ndetectors are mercury-cadmium-telluride\n\nThe two small infrared channel\n\n(HgCdTe) long-wavelength detectors.\n\nTwo of the large\n\ninfrared channel detectors are HgCdTe. The other two are indium antimonide (InSb).\nAlthough there are six VAS infrared detectors, only two will be in use during any satellite\nspin period.\n\nThe following are the three VAS operating modes:\n1. VISSR: The sensor operates in a normal cloud mapping mode.\n2. Multispectral Imaging:\n\nThis mode provides the normal VISSR cloud mapping function.\n\nIn addition, it supplies data in any two additional spectral bands selected with a spatial\nresolution of 13.8 km. This mode of operation takes advantage of the condition that\nthe VAS infrared imaging detectors (small HgCdTe) are offset one scan line in the N-S\nplane. Using the data from these detectors simultaneously produces a complete infrared\nmap when they are operated every other scan line. This allows using the larger detectors\nduring half of the imaging/scanning sequence period to obtain additional spectral\ninformation.\n3. Dwell Soundh_g: Up to twelve spectral filters covering the range 680cm "I (14.7#m)\nthrough 2535 cm1 (3.9/_m) can b\'e positioned into the optical train while the scan\nmirror is on a single N-S scan line. In addition, the filter wheel can be programmed so\nthat each spectral band (filter) can dwell on a single scan line for from 0 to 255 space_\ncraft spins. Either the 6.9km or 13.8km resolution detectors can be selected for the\nseven filter positions operating in tile spectral region 703cm -j (1.4.2 _m) through 1490\ncm-I (6.7/Jm). For tile remaining five spectral bands the 13.Skm resolution detectors\nare used. Selectable frame sector size, position and scan direction are the same as in\nthe Multispectral Imaging (MSI) mode of operation (Montgomery and Endres, 1977).\n\n24\n\nIn some of the spectral regions, multiple line data are required to improve the signal-tonoise ratio of the sounding data. The total number of satellite spins at the same N-S scan line\nposition required to obtain the desired sounding data for all spectral bands is called the VAS\n"spin budget."\n\nThe VAS "spin budget" for sounding a N-S swath having a 30x 30 km resolu-\n\ntion is approximately 157 spins. Therefore, with the appropriate interlacing of scan lines formed\nby the detector FOV pairs, the time required to accomplish sounding over 0.65 \xc2\xb0 N-S swath (400\nkm) with a resolution of 30x30 km will be 23 minutes.\n\nTHE DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM (DMSP)\nEVOLUTION\nData from DMSP satellites has been routinely transmitted directly to U.S. Air Force and Navy\nground terminals and Navy carriers since 1966. Previous spacecraft which have been launched\n(Figure 9) have had a tactical (direct readout) as well as a strategic (stored data) capability.\nSixteen air transportable data receiving terminals are now located in the Philippines, Spain, Guam,\nOkinawa, Alaska, the Canal Zone, Germany, Korea, the Kwajalein Missile Range, and the continental U.S. to provide tactical commanders with real time DMSP data. The Navy is currently\noperating direct data readout sites at Rota, Spain and at San Diego, California.\nIn March 1969, DOD approved a joint-service development effort. As a result, a feasibility\nmodel shipboard receiving terminal was developed by the Air Force with assistance from Navy\npersonnel attached to the DMSP System Program Office (SPO). This terminal was installed\naboard the USS Constellation and proved extremely effective in several deployments to Southeast Asia. A prototype station has since been placed in operation on the USS Kennedy and\nproduction units are in operation on the USS Independence, the USS Kitty Hawk, the USS\nMidway, and the USS Enterprise.\n\nAll CV class carriers are slated for eventual receipt of this\n\nequipment.\n\n25\n\nIn December 1972, DMSP data were declassified and made available to the civil/scientific\ncommunity through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Nicho!s,\n1975a; 1976; Brandli, 1976).\n\nIn September 1976, the first Block 51) satellite was launched.\n\nAlthough anomalies pre-\n\ncluded collection of operational data immediately after launch, the satellite was restored to\nnominal operational condition and provided meteorological data of previously unmatched quality.\nThe second, third, and fourth Block 5D satellites have subsequently been launched and placed\nin operation (Figure 9).\n\nDMSP spacecraft history prior to 1 Ju!Y 1965 is still classified. Since 1965, there have\nbeen two major spacecraft models flown:\nB, C, and D.\n\nB!ock 4, Versions A & B; and Block 5, Versions A,\n\nBlock 4. Block 4 employed a pair of VIDICON cameras to acquire television pictures\nshowing the earth\'s cloud cover and some terrain features as they appeared in the visible wavelength region. The resolution of these pictures was approximately 1.5 nautical miles at nadir,\nbut degraded rapidly toward the picture edge. A Supplementary system to roughly measure albedo\nwas also incorporated on later Block 4 spacecraft. This system of 16 thermopile sensors, known\nas the "C" system, acquired data on energy emitte0 by large areas of the ea_\'th in two se!ected\nIR intervals: 0.4 to 4.0 micrometers (energy from reflected sunlight) and 8.0 to 12.0 micrometers (energy self emitted by the earth). Resolution was on the order of 100 nautical sq. miles.\nBlock 5. The first Block 5 was launched in February ! 970. Block 5 version A, B, C, replaced the VIDICON cameras in the "C" system with a new primary sensor known as the\nSensor Avenue Package (SAP) to gather Visual and Infrared data at improved resolutions.\n\nVisual\n\ndata and IR data were collected at one-third nautical mile resolution and smoothed to two\nnautical miles. The one-third nautical mile data were available to U.S. Air Force Globa! Weather\nCentral (AFGWC), Omaha, Nebraska, while the smoothed data were routinely transmitted directly\n26\n1\n\nto AF and Navy tactical sites around the globe. Versions B and C incorporated various special\nsensors for vertical profiling of atmospheric temperature, for measuring precipitating electron\nactivity at spacecraft altitude, for atmospheric density profiling, etc. Many of these sensor package\npackages have been improved for Block 5D.\nBlock 519. The first Block 5D was launched in September 1976. Although anomalies\nprecluded collection of operational data immediately after launch, the satellite was restored\nto nominal operational condition and provided meteorological data of extremely high quality.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth Block 5D satellites have subsequently been launched\n\nand placed in operation.\n\nThe 5D version included a new primary sensor, the Operational\n\nLinescan System (OLS), which provided improved resolution of 0.3 nautical miles for both\nvisual and IR fine data and 1.5 nautical mile for smoothed data. The biggest improvement over\nthe SAP was the OLS resolution uniformity along the scan line. At 800 nautical miles from\nnadir, the SAP experienced a degraded resolution of 13 nautical miles while the OLS maintained a resolution of two nautical miles or better.\nThe following section will describe the Block 5D-I and -2 instruments and system in more\ndetail (Nichols, 1975b):\nDMSP Block 5D-l:\n\nDOD Meteorological Satellite Program satellites 5D-1 replaced the\n5C models.

The basic premise of the 5D-20LS is to increase overall system reliability\nby providing functional redundant circuitry, although some changes, such as increased IR digiti-.\nzation (from 7 to 8 bits), and improved sensitivity to low temperature values (190 \xc2\xb0 -210\xc2\xb0K)\nhave been incorporated.\n\nCharacteristics of the Operational Linescan System (OLS)\nMeteorological Data Collected in Visible and Infrared Spectra\nVisible Data Collected as 0.3nm x 0.3nm during day and 1.5nm x 1.5nm at night\nInfrared Data Collected as 0.3nm x 0.3nm at all times\nOscillating Scanner Collects Data in Both Directions Along 1600nm Swath.\nNear Constant Resolution as a function of Scan Angle\nThree Digital Tape Recorders for Data Storage\nEach Recorder can store 20 minutes of\' interleaved visual and infl\'ared 0.3nm x\n0.3nm of data.\nAnalog Filtering and Digital Averaging is used to smooth data to 1.5nm x 1.5nm\nfor on board global storage.\n\n32\n\nEach recorder can store 400 minutes of interleaved visual and infrared 1.5nm x\n1.5nm of data.\nTele_\'_try and special meteorological sensor data are included within the primary\nsmoothed data stream.\nReal time encrypted transmission of 0.3nm and 1.5nm data.\n\n,\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR H (SStt)-A\n\nHUMIDITY, TEMPERATURE, AND OZONE SOUNDER\n\nThis instrument is an infrared multispectral sounder for humidity, temperature and ozone.\nSoundings of temperature and of humidity and a single measurement of ozone is provided for\nvertical and slant paths lying under and to the side of the sub-satellite track.\nThe SSH is a 16-channel sensor with one channel (1020 cm-1) in the 10-micrometer ozone\nabsorption band, one channel (835 cm-1) in the 12-micrometer atmospheric window, six channels\n(\'74"7,725,708,695,676,668\n\ncm-1) in the 15-micrometer CO2 absorption band, and eight channels\n\n(from 453 cm-1 to 333 cm-1) in the 22- to 30-micrometer rotational water vapor absorption band.\nThe instruxnent consists of an optical system, detector and associated electronics, and a scanning\nmirror. The scanning mirror was stepped across the satellite subtrack, allowing the SSH to view 25\nseparate columns of the atmosphere every 32 s over a cross track ground swath of 2000 kin. While\nthe scanning mirror is stopped at a scene station, the channel filters are sequenced through the field\nof view. The surface resolution is approximately 39 km at NADIR. Radiance data are transformed\ninto temperature water vapor and ozone profiles by a mathematical inversion technique.\nA Cassegrain objective forms a 2.7 degree FOV centered on an axis parallel to the flight path.\n"\n\nA step-rotating diagonal scanning mirror scans the FOV according to a pre-established scan program\nm a plane normal to the flight path.\nThe SSH instrument weighs 29 pounds and consumes 8 watts power.\n\n33\n\nSpacecraft F-1 through F-4 carried the SSH-1 as described.\n\nSSH units starting with F-5\n\nare designated SSH-2 and do not include the spectral channel for ozone sounding. That filter\nhas been replaced by an atmospheric window channel at about 800/_m.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR M!T (SSM/T)-A\n\nPASSIVE MICROWAVE TEMPERATURE SOUNDER\n\nThe SSM!T is a 7-channel scanning passive microwave radiometer which measures radiation\nin the 50-60GHz frequency region to provide data for temperature profiling from the earth\'s\nsurface to above 30kin. The SSM/T scans in synchronization with the SSH (an infrared temperature and humidity sounder).\n\nThe microwave sounder complements the infrared sounder by\n\nproviding temperature sounding over previously inaccessible cloudy regions of the globe. Temperature profiles to higher altitudes are also provided (than was previously possible with infrared\nsensors alone).\n\nThe SSM/T will operate in the 50-60GHz absorption band of molecular oxygen. Since the\nmixing ratio of oxygen is essentially constant in the atmosphere, the contribution of any layer\nof the atmosphere to the total signal of a given frequency received by a radiometer flown on a\nspacecraft is primarily a function of the temperature and density of the layer and the amount\nof absorption in the atmosphere above the layer. By choosing frequencies with different absorption coefficients on the wing of the 02 absorption band, a series of weighting functions peaking\nat preselected atmospheric heights may be obtained.\n\nFrequencies were chosen to obtain seven\n\nchannels with weighting functions peaking at altitudes ranging from the surface to above 30 km.\nThe surface channel at approximately 50GHz was chosen to permit removal of background\nterrain contributions to tile channels which peak in the lower atmosphere.\n\nOther frequencies\n\nwere chosen (Table 8) to peak at altitudes that produce an optimum temperature profile.\nThe Multi-channel, Single Antenna\nRadiometer scans across the NADIR track on seven scan positions and two calibration\npositions (cokt sky and 300 deg K). The dwell time for the crosstrack and calibration positions\n\n34\n\nis 2.7s each. The total scan period is 32 s. The instrument has an instantaneous field of view\nof 14 deg and scans plus or minus 36 deg from NADIR.\nTable 8\nSSM/T Channel Specifications\nr\n\nNumber\n1\n\nPeak Height (km)\n0\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n50.5\n\nNETD* (\xc2\xb0K)\n0.3\n\n2\n\n2 +-2\n\n53.2\n\n0.3\n\n3\n\n6 +-2\n\n54.35\n\n0.3\n\n4\n\n10 -+2\n\n54.9\n\n0.3\n\n5\n\n16 -+2\n\n58.825\n\n0.3\n\n6\n\n22 -+3\n\n59.4\n\n0.4\n\n7\n\n30 + 3\n\n58.4\n\n0.5\n\n*NoiseEquivalent emperatureDifference\nT\n\nThe SSM/T weighs 25 pounds and consumes 18 watts of power.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR B (SSB)-GAMMA DETECTOR\nThe SSB or the SSB./O sensors are gamma radiation measurement sensors which were\ncarded on each 5D-l spacecraft except F-4.\nThe SSB sensor system consists of a four detector array, each positioned 30 degrees from the\nvertical. Each detector is basically a scintillator disc coupled to a photomultiplier tube. The\nscintillator is surrounded by a tantalum ring shield to give a directional characteristic. The SSB\nalso contains a piggy-back electronics (PBE-2) package which is an optical system for gathering\nbackground information.\n\nIt contains three selectable silicon sensors.\n\nThe SSB/O is sensitive to X-rays in the energy range of approximately 1.5 KeV to more than\n100 KeV. It uses large area proportional counter and cadmium telluride (CdTe) solid state detectors\nto provide excellent spectral resolution and high detection efficiency. By virtue of its extended low\n\n35\n\nenergy response, the SSB/O is able to identify signals associated with Bremsstrahlung generated by\nenergetic electrons precipitating in the upper atmosphere.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR J* (SSJ*)-SPACE\n\nRADIATION DOSIMETER\n\nThe SSJ* measured the radiation dose in silicon under aluminum shielding of four thicknesses\nrepresentative of the Block 5D DMSPspacecraft. The dosimeter was launched aboard the first\nBlock 5D satellite (F-1).\n\nThe interest,in such data was engendered by the discovery of tile "softness" 0f"\xc2\xa2_urren_\n\' CMOS\ncircuitry to radiation (10 4 rads results in failure) coupled with the present substantial uncertainty\nand controversy concerning the natural energetic electron dose received by a satellite in a low polar\norbit. Direct measurement of this dose, correlated with performance of onboard circuitry; as\n_\ntherefore of crucial importance in providing data for planning of future missions (particularly where\nuse of CMOScomponents is envisioned).\n\nThe dosimeter used technology proven by flight aboard many USAF and NASA, satellitb_,\nThe instrument (onsist_d of four separate single-detector units, each using small cubical lith\'iiam\ndrifted silicon detector_ to perform two major functions. First, it directly measured the ionization\nin the silicon cgB_"\ncauged by riatural radiation (the radiation dose). Second, the dosimeter served\nas an electron-protola Sl_etrometer, thus yielding the fluences of energetic electrons and protons\nencountered in the DMSPorbit as a function of time.\n\nA space radiation dosimeter is scheduled to fly on spacecraft F-7. Although differentin\nmanufacture, its operational objectives remain essentially the same as the 5D-1 dosimeter carried\non F-1.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR D (SSD)-ATMOSPHERIC\n\n-\n\nDENSITY SENSOR\n\n\'File Atmospheric Density Sensor (SSD) provides a measure of major atmospheric constituents\n(Nitrogen, Oxygen and Ozone) in the earth\'s thermosphere (I O0 to 250kin in altitude) by\n36\n,,\n\nmaking earth-limb observations of the ultraviolet radiation from this atmospheric region. The\nsensor measures the radiation emitted in the ultraviolet spectral region from excitation of molecular nitrogen by impinging solar radiation.\n\nThe intensity of the emitted radiation is proportional\n\nto the excitation rate and the number of molecules at any given altitude. Funneltrons and a photomultiplier tube will detect the radiation after it passes through a collimator which provides a\n0.1 x 4.0 \xc2\xb0 field-of-view. The SSD is mechanically driven to scan vertically through the earth\'s\nlimb in about 30 seconds. The instrument provides approximately 50 sets of density profiles\non the daylight portion of each orbit.\nThe SSDis currently being evaluated aboard the DMSP F-4 satellite launched in June 1979.\nThis is an experimental sensor with no current Program Office plans to integrate it onto subsequent 5D spacecraft.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR J (SSJ)-PRECIPITATING\n\nELECTRON SPECTROMETER\n\nA small, lightweight (3 lb) sensor, the SSJ counts ambient electrons with energies ranging\nfrom 60 eV to 20 KeV. Utilizing a time-sequenced variable electrostatic field to deflect the particles toward the channeltron detector, the sensor determines the number of electrons having\nenergies within certain sub-ranges of the 60 eV to 20 KeV spectrum.\nThe SSJ is an electron spectrometer that detects and analyzes low energy electrons precipitating into the atmosphere producing the auroral display.\nThe SSJ units for Block 5D-2 will incorporate the capability to measure precipitating protons in the 50eV to 20KeV energy range as well as electrons measured on 5D-1. It is expected\nthat this change will give new information relative to magnetic substorm activity.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR C (SSC)-SNOW/CLOUD DISCRIMINATOR\nThe Snow/Cloud Sensor is an experimental unit that is being used in conjunction with the\nOLS sensor on spacecraft F-4. The experiment being performed by the simultaneous in-orbit\n37\n\nuse of these two sensors is primarily that of proving the proposition that snow/cloud scene discrimination can be obtained though the combination of near IR (1.6 micrometer wavelength)\nsensor data and OLS L-Channel (visual) information.\n\n.The Snow/Cloud Sensor is a "push-broom" scan radiometer that will depend upon orbital\nvelocity of the 5D spacecraft to provide the along track scan and a linear array of 48 detectol\nelements at the image plane of a wide angle lens to provide a 40.2 \xc2\xb0 cross track scan. The sensor\ndepends upon reflected solar energy in the 1.51 to 1.63 micrometer spectral band for its input\nsignal.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR M/I (SSM/I)-MICROWAVE ENVIRONMENTAL SENSOR SYSTEM\nThe SSM/I is currently undergoing system development for integration aboard later Block\n5D-2 vehicles. The sensor is a passive microwave imager which scans in seven channels. It will\noperate at four frequencies, three with both vertical and horizontal polarization (19.35, 37.0,\n85.5 GHz), and one frequency (22.23 GHz) with only vertical polarization.\nThe SSM/I will be designed to scan cross track (with respect to the satellite\'s velocity vector)\nin a conical scan pattern, and will gather data over an approximate\n\n1400km swath width. The\n\ndata gathered will provide information which will be used to determine the location, extent, and\nintensity of precipitation.\n\nIn addition, the data collected will provide for a determination of\n\nsoil moisture content, wind speed over the ocean, and the morphology and extent of sea ice.\n\nSPECIAL SENSOR I/P (SSI/P)--PASSIVE IONOSPHERIC MONITOR\nThe SSI/P is a high frequency (HF) receiver which passively monitors the ionspheric noise\nbreakthrough frequency used in ionospheric foreca_ting_ Noise from man-made and natural\nsources below the ionospheric F2 layer peak can be detected by an HF topside receiver only at\nfrequencies above the F2 critical f\'requency (foF2).\n\nBy sweeping through the ttF spectrum, the\n\nSSI/P can monitor the frequency o[\' the noise breakthrough.\n\n38\n\nThis frequency agrees to within\n\n1 MHz of the measured foF2 above 85% of the time over mid:latitude land masses. The foF2\nis a prime parameter used in constructing electron density profiles used in forecasting the stateof-the-ionosphere.\n\nSPECIALSENSOR I/E (SSI/E)-IONOSPHERICPLASMAMONITOR\nThe SSI/E is an electron and ion probe designed to measure the averageion mass, satellite\npotential, electron density, and electron and ion temperatures St the spacecraft altitude. The\n.....\n::i:\n-\n\n"\n\nSSI/E providesa measurementof the electron density and parameters for the calculationof\nthe plasma scale height at the satellite altitude. The latter information is a prime input to the\nproduction of existingvertical electron density models.\nTile SSI/E to be carried on Block 5D-2 satellites will have:the additional capability of\nmakiug scintillationmeasurementsat orbitalaltitude_. This instrument will be identified as\n\nssi/_s.\n\nDMSPBLOCK 6\nAt the time of this writing, technical requirementsfor a shuttle compatible (BLOCK6) satellite\nsystem is being defined based on expected user requirements for the late 1980\'s (Staff Members,\n1979a). At least in the early shuttle compatible spacecraft, sensor missionswill be similar to\nthose for BLOCK5I)-2 and will include a derivation of the current OLS, and growth versions\nof the sensorsdescribedin the preceding instrument section.\n\nMINIMUM OPERATIONAL\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nGround support will be DODfunded and operated. The satelliteswill be commandedandcontrolled once orbit is achievedas previouslydescribed for BLOCK5D-2 but with expanded capabilities. Up to four satellitesmay be controlled at one time and real time relay of globaldata to a\ncentralized CONUS(Continental United States) location with a maximum delayof 30 minutes.\n39\n\nLaunch will be from Vandenberg AFB, California by tile Space Transportation System (STS).\nRetrieval of BLOCK 6 satellites is an option consideration.\n\nOrbit characteristics:\n\nThe basic orbit will be sun synchronous circular with two to four\n\nsatellites utilized. The altitude, inclination, period, and sun angle of BLOCK 5D-2 will be supported with an add on capability for some orbits to 1850 km (1000 nm).\n\nPhysical characteristics have not yet been determined as of this writing. Payload weight,\nspacecraft size, and power requirements are all expected to increase reflecting sensor growth for\nimproved performance and reliability.\n.Design lifetime is to be 5-7 years.\n\nPRIMARY SENSOR (OLS-3)\nThe DMSP primary sensor is the Operational Linescan System (OLS). Changes shall:be\nmade to the 5D-20LS\n\nto provide for greater over all system operational flexibility, increased\n\nreliability and additional mission data.\n\nGlobal cloud cover imagery will be provided in one or two visible and as many as three\ninfrared bands. Resolution:\n\nfine data, 0.3 nm-one visible and one infrared; smooth data, 1.5\n\nnm-all bands.\n\nThe OLS-3 v_illbe derived from the 5D-2 primary sensor. Data storage functions will be\ndeleted and optical system redundancy wil! be added. ViSible imagery will be provided down.\nto one quarter moo,nlight. Infrared bands wiIllincl:ude 1.5, 6.7, and 1_ microns.,\nOLS Data Transmission S-band _ransmitters will be provid, d: for data transmission. Two\ne\n6.6,.56KBPS channels and one 1.33 MBPS channel will, provide 1:00%duty to tlie, CONUS site:.\nOne 1.024, MBPS channel is dedicated to DDT _o,tactical sites, world, wide.\n\n40_\n\no\n\nInitial units will weigh approximately 65 lbs maximum and require a maximum of 50 watts\npower.\n\nSPECIAL SENSORS\nThe BLOCK 6 mission requires a complement of other sensors in addition to the primary\nsensor. The special sensor complement will vary from spacecraft to spacecraft. This flexibility in\nsensor complement provides a combined sensor package to meelt minimum mission requirements.\nInfrared Sounder SSH-4\nAn Interferometer instrument which will measure radiance values in narrow spectral bands\nin the infrared absorption bands of H20 and CO2 to determine vertical temperature and water\nvapor profiles of the atmosphere. An operational instrument is currently under study.\nMicrowave Sounder SSM!T-2\nUsing a scanning antenna, this instrument will measure thc_nicrowave temperature of the\natmosphere at selected frequencies from 50 to 183 GHz to determine vertical temperature and\nwater vapor profiles in the atmosphere. The 50 GHz is operational (SSM/T-1) and higher frequency\ninstruments are planned. May ultimately replace the infrared sounder.\nIonospheric Sensor SSIE\nPresently operational on BLOCK 5D. Only modest changes are anticipated if any.\nTopside Ionospheric Sounder SSI\nThis system was developed for BLOCK 5D-2. Minimum changes expected for BLOCK 6.\nPrecipitating Electron Spectrometer SSJ/3\nAn operational instrument on BLOCK 5D, Minimum changes expected for BLOCK 6.\nMicrowave Images SSM/I-2\nThis instrument is currently under development for 5D-2 in smaller aperture form. BLOCK 6\ninstrument may incorporate both active and passive microwave techniques to meet user requirements.\n\n41\n\nLow Energy Gamma Detection SSB\nBLOCK 6 instrument based on the advanced operational instrument for 5D-2.\nMicrowave Scatterometer SSM/S\nAn advanced version of SEASAT-A scatterometer incorporating an active microwave sensor\nwith range, doppler and radar cross section analysis of returns.\n\nINTERNATIONAL WEATHER SATELLITES\nAs part of the international cooperation and participation within the World Meteorological\nOrganization, the United States, Japan, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S.S.R. have\nplaced satellites in orbit which supported the First GARP Global Experiment (FGGE) during\n1978-79. A summary of international weather satellite evolution is shown in Figure 11. Japan\'s\ngeostationary satellite (Himawari-1) was launched on July 14, 1977 and positioned over the western\nPacific Ocean. The ESA\'s geostationary satellite (METEOSAT) was launched on November 23, 1977\nand positioned over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Both were launched by the U.S., each aboard a\nNASA Delta launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Himawari-1 and the Meteosat are\nshown in Figures 12 and 13, respectively. More complete descriptions of these two geostationary\nsatellites and the USSR Meteor system may be found in articles by Hirai, et al., 1975; Morgan, 1978;\nand Diesen, 1978, respectively.\n\nOCEANOGRAPHIC SATELLITES\nThe oceans, which cover about two thirds of the earth\'s surface, have important influences on\nour weather and climate and are a vital natural resource needing further exploration (McClain, 1980).\nSEASAT-A\nSEASAT-A ([Zig. 14) was launched in June 1978 and carried instruments fully dedicated to\'\noceanic prediction (NOAA Staff Members, 19\'77).\n\n42\n\nThe sensor applications are as follows:\n1. Altimeter-Anadir-looking\n\ninstrument that measures the displacement between the satel-\n\nlite and the ocean surface to a processed accuracy of 10 cm every 18 km and arms roughness of that surface to 10 cm.\n2. Radar-A 100 km, swath-width image of the ocean surface with a 25 m spatial resolution\nt_\n\nviewed every 18 days.\n3. Scatterometer-Low\n\nto intermediate surface wind velocity determined over a swath-width\n\nof 1200 km, providing global coverage (-+75deg latitude) every 36 h on a 100 km grid basis.\n4. Microwave Radiometer-Ice\n\nboundaries and leads, atmospheric water vapor, sea surface\n\ntemperature, and intermediate to high wind speeds are provided over a swath-width of\n1000 km every 36 h. Spatial resolution of ice features is 25 km, and 125 km for sea surface\ntemperature (Gloerson and Barath, 1977).\n5. Visible and IR Radiometer-Provide\n\na 7 km spatial resolution imagery for feature identifi-\n\ncation for the microwave data.\nNOSS\nThe National Oceanic Satellite System (NOSS) is proposed to provide a limited operational\ncapability to obtain global ocean measurements from a space platform. It is a NASA/NOAA/DOD\ntriagency program with a 5 year demonstration period using two spacecraft, commencing in 1986.\nUtilizing the experience gained from Seasat-A and Nimbus 7, the NOSS will develop and test new\ntechniques for sea surface monitoring for incorporation into civilian and military operational\nweather and oceanographic forecast systems (Staff Members, 1980(b)).\nNOSS Sensors and Measurements\n(Figures 15 and 16)\nAltimeter (ALT)\n\nSea state, ocean surface topography, ice\nsheet height, surface wind speed at nadir\nand ocean currents\n\n43\n\nScatterometer (SCATT)\n\nSurface wind speed and direction\n\nLarge Antenna Multi-Channel\n\nSurface wind speed, sea surface temperature,\n\nMicrowave Radiometer (LAMMR)\n\nsea ice cover, thickness, age, atmospheric\nwater vapor and liquid water content\n\nCoastal Zone Color Scanner\n\nChlorophY!l and diffuse attenuation\n\n(CZCS)\n\ncoefficient (K)\n\nTable 9 lists the predicted NOSS system capability.

The WSIR is an X-band (3 cm) synthetic-aperture, side-looking radar which produces\nimages of the surface with a pixel size of either 100 m over a 360 km wide swath or 25 m over a\n90 km swath. The scatterometer, a side-looking radar, has the capacity to measure the scattering\ncross section of surface irregularities at 14.6 GHz (2.05 cm). The IEAS is an altimeter which can\nmeasure ice altitude profiles with two complementary instruments: a microwave radar, to provide\ncontinuous coverage along the nadir track;and a laser ranging system with commandable pointing,\nto provide precision altitude determination, off-axis mapping, fine-scale profile resolution, and\nranging to reflectors placed on the ice. The PIMR is a passive, 5-channel infrared radiometer (.4near,\ninfrared channels detecting reflected solar radiation and one thermal infrared channel at I l /_m),\nwhich can map cloud cover, determine cloud parameters, measure surface temperatures, and aid in\ndistinguishing surface ice and snow from clouds.\n\nA Data Collection and Location System (DCLS), for locating and relaying telemetry from\nbuoys and other in-situ platforms, is included in the spacecraft. It will use the ARGOS (or RAMS)\nprinciple, in which periodic transmission from the platforms will be received and located by the\nDoppler shift of the carrier as the satellite passes over the platform.\nTHE ICEX ORBIT\nThe orbit proposed for ICEX has an altitude of approximately 700 km and an inclination of\n87\xc2\xb0 or 93\xc2\xb0, so the spacecraft passes by the poles within 3 degrees of latitude. The altitude of-the\n46\n\n_-\n\norbit is a compromise between the effects of atmospheric drag, area coverage and resolution requirements, and the transmitter power available from the active microwave sensors. The inclination is\ndetermined primarily by the requirements imposed on the IEAS to measure the ice sheets of the\nAntarctic. To encompass its most important areas, the nadir point of the spacecraft should approach\nthe South Pole to within approximately 3\xc2\xb0 of latitude, thus providing coverage of about 98 percent\nof the continental area.\n\nThese selected orbit parameters apply even if the payload is carried on more than one spacecraft. In that case, all spacecraft must be placed in orbits having the same altitude and inclination\nto provide compatible data from the imaging sensors (WSIR, LAMMR, scatterometer, and PIMR).\nTHE ICEX SPACECRAFT\nThe GSFC has performed a preliminary study for a dedicated spacecraft capable of carrying\nthe required sensors. The spacecraft selected for this study is an augmented Multimission Modular\nSpacecraft (MMS). It is 3-axis stabilized and supports an expandable instrument module. The\ndesign includes mission-unique equipment which meets all power, pointing, propulsion, and communication requirements imposed by the mission and payload. The spacecraft would be launched\nby Shuttle from the Western Test Range (WTR) and then flown into the ICEX orbit with the onboard propulsion system. The propulsion system can be made large enough to return the spacecraft\nto the Shuttle for service when required. The spacecraft is shown in Figure 17.\nA proposed alternate spacecraft approach uses the NOSS placed into the ICEX orbit. This\napproach requires that the NOSS LAMMR, scatterometer, and radar altimeter be modified to meet\nice measurement requirements, and that the laser altimeter and DCLS be added to the payload now\nproposed for NOSS. A separate spacecraft is required to carry the WSIR and PIMR. No studies for\nthis spacecraft have been performed at this time,\n\n47\n\nSPACE SHUTTLE\n\nFrom early in the 1980s, and at least throughout\nNASA\'s transportation\npean countries\nin space.\n\nsystem for access to space.\n\nin developing\n\nfollows: (a) calibration\n\ndecade, the Shuttle will be\n\nBeyond that, the joint venture\n\nthe Spacelab will provide a functioning\n\nThese two programs\n\n(Allison et al., 1978).\n\nthe following\n\nmanned laboratory\n\nwill play vital roles in the development\n\nThe four functional\nof instruments\n\nslowly changing earth/atmosphere\n\ncategories\n\nsensors, and (d) special experiments\n\nThe difficulties inherent to calibration\n\nweather\n\nor impractical\n\nand correction\n\nments have, in the past, presented manifold problems.\n\nof future remote sensors\n\nsatellites, (b) direct monitoring\n\n(c) development\n\nimpossible\n\nfacility\n\nthat these programs will provide are as\n\non operational\n\nparameters,\n\nwith Euro-\n\nand demonstration\n\nof\n\nof new remote\n\nby other means.\n\nfor long-term drift of satellite instru-\n\nFirst, logistic problems associated with\n\ndeployment\n\nof enough ground systems and interrelating\n\ntheir independent\n\nlimitations.\n\nA second factor is that ground instruments\n\ndo not generally measure the same\n\nquantities\n\nas satellite instruments.\n\nFor example,\n\na satellite radiometer\n\nover the entire scene in view, while ground truth data are restricted\nments.\n\nThus, at least calibrations\n\nof satellite instruments\n\ntimes and the ability to interrelate\nemerging U.S. Climate Program.\ninstruments,\n\ncalibrated\n\nmeasurements\n\nExperience\n\nmeasures a TB integrated\n\nusually to point measure-\n\nover their several years of useful life-\n\nsucceeding satellites, is a crucial requirement\nThe Shuttle can fulfill this requirement\n\nat least for the\n\nby periodic flight of\n\nagainst standards before and after flight, that can provide comparative\n\nat points of orbit conjunction\n\nwith the Nimbus-6\n\nwith the satellites when identical scenes are in view.\n\nERB instrument\n\nat six-month\n\npendent\n\nset of data by themselves,\n\nand h_ghty calibrated\n\ntotal solar flux measurements\n\nintervals.\n\nsubstantiates\n\ntotal solar flux measurements\n\ndirectly monitored\n\nerrors imposed severe\n\nSuch measurements\n\nof continuing\n\nwill provide an inde-\n\nbut will also serve to interrelate\n\nof the ERBE instrumentation.\n\nby the Shuttle-Spacelab\n\nthe desirability\n\nOther parameters\n\nthe\n\nthat can be\n\ninclude a mmaber of the well mixed atmospheric\n\n48\n\nconstituents, ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. For example, annual measurements are probably\nadequate for CO2, CFMs, N20, NO x , and CH4 .\nThe Spacelab will also provide the needed facilities to develop, test, and demonstrate new\nremote sensors. These include:\n1. Sea Surface Temperature-Improvements\n\nthat appear possible include increased signal-\n\nto-noise ratios and additional wavelengths to reduce errors due to atmospheric water\nvapor and clouds.\n2. Vertical Temperature Profile-Accuracy of passive sounding below 20kin altitude can\nbeimproved\n\nwith measurements at 4/zm and with bandwidths of 2 wave numbers.\n\nActive Lidar promises even higher accuracy along with an order of magnitude-improved\nvertical resolution.\n3. Winds-Lidar techniques may be able to measure wind speed and direction in cloudfree regions.\n4. Stratospheric Aerosols-Stellar\n\nsources provide a large number of occultations not limited\n\nto the ecliptic plane, so that reasonably good coverage of stratospheric aerosols is possible.\n5. Tropospheric Aerosols-At present, no satellite technique exists for measuring tropospheric\naerosols, but a pulsed lidar system is believed to hold promise.\nAs plans are formulated for the development of these instruments (as well as any others\nthat may yet be identified) to the point where space flight development and testing can be\nvisualized, the advantages that Spacelab can provide will be capitalized up to the maximum\nextent possible.\nThere are two particularly important special experiments in the area of remote sensing that\nare especially suited to the Spacelab capabilities. These are extended cloud physics and radiation studies and precipitation over land and water. In the case of the extended cloud and radiation studies a group of instruments, including two separate radiometers and a lidar system, are\nrequired. In the case of the precipitation studies, a microwave radiometer, a visible band radiometer, an IR radiometer, and a 10cm radar are required. A number of short duration flights are\n\n49\n\nadequate to meet the objectives of both of these studies and the low orbiting Spacelab offers a\nunique capability for their accomplishment.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllison, L.

Abstract\n\nThis paper presents an overview of the meteorological satellite programs that have been\n\nevolvingfrom 1958 to the present and reviewsplans for the future meteorologicaland\nenvironmental satellitesystemsthat are scheduledto be placed into servicein the early\n1980\'s. The development of the TIROS family of weather satellites, including TIROS,\nESSA, ITOS/NOAA, and the present TIROS-N (the third-generation operational system)\n\nis summarized. The contribution of the Nimbusand ATS technology satellitesto the\ndevelopment of the operational polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites is discussed.\nIncluded are descriptions of both the TIROS-N and the DMSP payloads currently under\n\ndevelopmentto assurea continued and orderly growth of these systemsinto the 1980\'s.\n\n17.
