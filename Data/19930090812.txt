Duyamois.\n\nAmong the questions which concern aviation, the various\nproblems presented by the fuels are of prime importance.\n\nGaso-\n\nline, t\xe2\x80\x99nefuel now used, is an extremely volatile and inflammable liquid capable of forming explosive mixtures, the cause of\nmany\n\ncatastrophes in aviation.\nIt would obviously be very advantageous to employ less vol-\n\natile fuels, so\n\nas\n\nto diminish the fire hazard, but it seems prob-\n\nable that, for a long time to come, only the explosion engine\nwill be capable of keeping its weight per horsepower low enough\nfor aviation purposes.\nIt is therefo~e of special interest to investigate the possibility of using fuels which, while being less volatile than\ngasoline, would nevertheless enable this engine to function sat+\nisfactorily.\nLet us first consider the various dangers resulting from\n\n.\n\nthe use of gasoline.\n,..,,\n\xe2\x80\x981. From the storage viewpoint, gasoline presents an trndeniable danger.\n\nThe handling of the fuel in filling the tanks and\n\nthe keeping of aizplanes in flying order in the same locality\n* \xe2\x80\x9cAu sujet des coiibustibles dlaviation\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cLa Technique Adronautique, \xe2\x80\x9c April 15, 1927, pp. 105-109.\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n2\n\nN.

A. C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 451\n\n5\n\nIn order to explain this peculiar phenomenon,\n\nit would aP-\n\npear. necessary to introduce an imPortant variation in the phys\xe2\x80\x93\nical properties which affect the functioning of the airplane.\nNow, neither the air, nor the cell, nor the engine, nor the pro\xe2\x80\x93\npeller,\n\nnor the barograph seems, a priori, to depend on any,\n\ndiscontinuous parameter for a certain value of the altitude.\nThere refflainsothing but the fuel, which seems capable of acn\ncounting for this phe-nomenon.\n\nIn fact, at the abovementioned\n\nthe atmospheric pressure is only about 200 mm (7.87\n\naltitudes,\n\nin. ) of inercury. Moreover, as a result of the warming of the\ncarburetor due to the fact that the fuel is contained in a tank\nprotected by the fuselage, the fuel has ~ considerably higher\ntemperature\n\nthan that of the surrounding air.\n\nIn a climb to\n\n9500 m (31,167 ft.), Adjutant Moutonnier found that the tempera\xe2\x80\x93\nture of the tank was still 15\xc2\xb0C (59\xc2\xb0F. ), while the outside temperature was below \xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0C (\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0F. ).\n\nIt is obvious therefore that\n\nthe atmospheric pressure is of the order of magnitude of the\nvapor tension of aviation gasoline.\nmoreover,\n\nIf we take into account,\n\nthe natural enrichment of the carbureted mixture with .\n\nincrease in altitude, it is reasonable to suppose that, with\nthe usual fuels, there is a certain limit at which, by r@son\nof the excessive relative value of the vapor tension of the gas.\noline with respect to the external pressure, the carburetor no\nlonger furnishes a mixture with the requisite qualities for obtaining a good carburetion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nN.A. C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 451\n\n6\n\n1,\nWe have therefore been led to make the following hypothesis.\nGiven a fuel having a vapor, tension\n\n.h\n\nground, at the atmospheric pressure\n\nH,\n\nwhich produces on the\na satisfactory function-\n\ning in an aviation engine,\xe2\x80\x9d other things being equal, a fuel having the same qualities of homogeneity but a vapor tension equal\nto\n\na h\n\nwill produce a functioning equivalent to an altitude at\n.\nwhich the atmospheric pressure is a H. It i,s\xe2\x80\x99very evident that\na law conceived in such \xe2\x80\x98anabsolute folm cannot be strictly veri\xe2\x80\x93\nfied, because the vapor tension is not the only physical charac\xe2\x80\x93\nteristic which affects the formation of the ca?!btireted ixture:\nm\nThe nature of the fuel, its composition and viscosity, the mech\xe2\x80\x93\nanism of the carbtiretor and th~ degree of atomization have a\nbearing fihich is not ilegligible, It is nevertheless ttie that,\nwith the automatic carburetor devices used.; the ilfiportance\nof\nthe vapor tension is primordial from tileviewpoints of the atom\xe2\x80\x93\nization of the fuel a-rid the homogeneity of the mixture.\nof\nhypothesis\n\nThis\n\nseems, moreover, to accord very well with the results\n\ndbtained some 15 years ago by Bellem and Grageras in the carbure~\ntion of kerosene in explosion engines.\nmatic\n\nInstead of using an auto\xe2\x80\x93\n\ncarburetor, they employed a pump which delivered at each\n\ncycle the requisite quantity of fuel.\n\nThis fuel was drawn in at\n\nthe beginning of the intake period, the intake valve remaining\n,, . ... .\n.. .\n.,..,.,\nclosed during a certain portion of the stroke. The partial va.c-uum thus obtained was,favorable to the vaporization of the fuel.\nWe believe, moreover, that the device, employed had some effect\n\n--- ., ,-.,----- .. . .. . ......\xe2\x80\x94 .-\xe2\x80\x94\n\n7\n\nN.A. C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 451\non the results obtained.\n\nSince it follows from the foregoing considerations that the\nvolat ility of the aviation gasoline was accurately determined by\nthe condition of obtaining on the ground a satisfactory functioning of the engine, it is very evidei~t that fuels with a lower\nvapor tension would give poorer results on the.ground and would\nbe lia,ble to produce incrustations or fouling.\n\nThis point is\n\nimportant, for it is obvioukly desirable to have, at the altitude of utilization, a not very volatile fuel, in order to insure proper functioning, but it is also necessary to be able to\nreach this altitude without the engine becomin~ foul.\n\nIt is, in\n\nfact, of no avail to eliminate the fire hazami at the expense of\ninfinitely ;flore\nproba\xe2\x80\x99cle engine failure in taking off or while\nclimbing.\n\nThis disadvantage can be overcome by using @,soline\n\nto start with, which we \xe2\x80\x98havedone, Qut we deem this solution\nunsatisfactory\n\nand one to be regarded only as a makeshift.\n\nOn the other hand, we have had the opportunity to demon-\n\n.\n\nstrate the possibility of using, in automobile engines, fuels\nheavier than gasoline, provided they contain a sufficient proportion of volatile substances capable of playing the part of solvents and vaporizers of the heavier components.\ndetonation,\ntioning.\n\nBy preventiilg -\n\nit i~ thus possible to obtain very satisfactory func-\n\nWe have successfully used ethyl alcohol carbureted\n\nN.A.
