The automatic flight control system and flight director with coupler were designed to reduce pilot work-load for missions of approximately six hour duration during VFR, IFR, day and night conditions. The AFCS system for the 234 is essentially the same system as developed for the CH-47D, which has airspeed hold, attitude hold, and maneuver enhancement in all three axes. The system also has the capability to couple to the Sperry Helcis flight director system which provides for enroute navigation and landing approaches. Certification testing was completed, by both the FAA and CAA, to FAR Part 29 for Transport Category Rotorcraft and BCAR Section G: Rotorcraft. The aircraft was certified for civil operation in June 1981.", "title": "Boeing 234 flight control development", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820015337, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morris, J.
