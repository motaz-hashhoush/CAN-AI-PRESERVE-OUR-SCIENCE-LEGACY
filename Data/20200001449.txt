INTRODUCTION\nThe purpose of this test was to validate the Analog Devices (ADI) RH1021BMH-10 flight lot for\nuse in the fabrication of Europa Clipper Propulsion subsystem flight hardware. This test shall\nserve as the radiation lot acceptance test (RLAT) for this flight lot with wafer lot number\n769658.1 and lot date code (LDC) 1430A. Low dose rate (LDR) irradiations were performed in\nthis test so that the device susceptibility to enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) could be\ndetermined.\n\n2. DEVICES TESTED\n2.1. Part Background\nThe RH1021 is a precision 10 V reference with ultralow drift and noise, extremely good\nlong-term stability and almost total immunity to input voltage variations. The reference\noutput will source and sink up to 10mA.\n2.2. Device Under Test (DUT) Information\nTwenty-five (25) parts from the flight lot of RH1021s were provided by the Europa Clipper\nPropulsion system to Code 561 for TID testing. Two of the twenty-five were used as\ncontrols. All specifications and descriptions are according to the datasheet (revision F). More\ninformation can be found in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Two Keithley 2425s\nand one HP 34401A voltmeter were used to characterize the RH1021\xe2\x80\x99s parameters.\n\nFig. 3.

ESD procedures were followed during test and transfer of the\ndevices between irradiation chamber and characterization. Exposures were performed at ambient\nlaboratory temperature.\n\n4. TEST DESCRIPTION\n4.1 Irradiation Conditions\nRadiation testing was done by exposing the parts to gamma radiation at a low dose rate.\nTwenty-four (24) parts were tested, twenty-two (22) exposed to radiation and one as a\ncontrol. Prior to the first radiation dose, all twenty-four parts were electrically tested. After\neach exposure level, the parts were tested again and returned to radiation within the time\nlimits defined by MIL-STD-883, Method 1019. Eleven (11) parts were biased and eleven\n(11) were unbiased during the irradiation steps. See Table 2 for more information.\nTable 2.

During irradiation, biased DUTs were powered to +15 V. Table 3 describes the exact\npinout of a biased part.\nTable 3.
