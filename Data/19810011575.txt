INTRODUCTION \t\n\n/l\n\nThe search and z oo-scue serv;I.ce is a humane activity for all\npeople in emergency and danger situations. The successful performance of any.type of assistance is not only greatly dependent\non the emergency equipment of those in distress as well as their\nhelpers, but in a very special way it is also dependent on an effective alarm system that facilitates the rapid transmission of\nemergency signals and a swift determination of the distress location as well as a quick, powerful and dependable telecommunication\nsystem to and among rescue centers and units.\nA satellite support system should offer the best guarantee\nfor the creation of a locating system in all emergency and danger\nsituations that functions worldwide, i.e. for sea and air traffic\nas well as for inhabitant all over the world, independently of the\ntype of terrain and airspace, by the employment of suitable installations and handy emergency beacons and buoys.\nThe application of this technology could at long last realize\nthe efforts to develop and introduce an effective alarm system for\nthe fast and rattler precise determination of positions and areas\nall over the world in case of emergencies, threats and accidents\nof any kind.\n\n.3\n\n1. ACTIVITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES\n\n\t\n/2\n\nWith SARSAT the USA, Canada and France are presently cooperacing on just such a project. "NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center"\nand the "Canadian Communication Research Center" are pursuing a\nconcept which has the following characteristics (Fig.l):\nc Three Weather Satellites of the TIROS-N series (Television\n7nfrarcd Radiation Observation Satellite), all equipped\nwith a SARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite) transponder;\nO\n\nThey cross the earth at least twice daily at a height of\n$34 km in an orbit near the pole;\n\nC\n\nThe Doppler principle is used to determine the position\nof the emergeny call be4cons (ELT-Emergency Location Transmitter or EPIRB-Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).\n\nFig.l: SARSAT-Concept G1\n\nOperational\nMeteorological Satellite\n\'77t\t\n\n^7"t+\'.7^\xe2\x80\x94TTY\t\n\n4.\'* 4.\n\nG7 6+; f\n\nLocation By\nDoppler N avig at ion\n\n..-\t\nA\n\nSAR Forces ^^/J\'/\'\'/\t\n\ntl\n+1 L. na,\nr;\n\nf\t\n\n-any\n\n\\^\nELT\nr\n\n^,\t\n\nDistressed Units\t\n\nRes, sae Coordination Center\n\n.^\n4\t\n\n4\t\n\n,\n\nThe already existing alarm systems (buoys, beacons, etc.) \t\nare working in the range of 121.5/243.0 MHz. With their aid positions can be determined within 10 to 20 km. The beacons which\n1\nh\n\n/3\n\nare being developed right now, which will work in the 406 MHz\nrange, can achieve a precision between 2 and 5 km. In addition\nto the already mentioned SARSAT-!transponder there is another signal processor available which stores signals until recall for\ntransmission to the next visible groundstation.\nTab.l: SARSAT-Project (USA, Canada., France) (l)\nDistribution of Work\n\nNOAA S PACECPA\t\n6\nM01,11-1\'CA7\t `.S A*,D\t i\nS I C A\'JE`:":AS\n\nSPACESORNE\n\nCVOAA GROUND SYS I\n\nEM I\n\nC. %1\'\'ti"Uti;CATIONS\t\n\nPROV I DE U S.

NECESSITY\nThe urgent need for such a satellite system is demonstrated\nin Fig. 2. From the moment the alarm is triggered (J,n whichever\nway) the prospects for re sue decrease rapidly with the length of\'\nthe search action. The chances for success are almost always\na race against time.\n\nFIS.2: Probability of Success versus Lapse of Time [2]\nA(COVERY TIME (DAYS)\n\n100\n\n1\t\n\n2\t\n\n4\t\n\nT\t\n\n05\t\n\nT\t\n\nT\n\n1\n\nI\n\nso\nI HOURS 60% SURVIVAL\n\n5; 60\nC,\nis\n40\ncc\n\n20\t\n\n10% SURVIVAL\n\n(I\n\n2\t\n\n8\t\n\n12\t\n\nRECOVERY TIME (HOURS)\n\n120\t\n\n512\n\n\t\n\nALTERNATE SYSTEMS\n\n/5\n\nSeveral realization possibilities are available. After having\nintroduced the SARSAT-concept which is presently being developed\nFig.3 shows several system alternatives. Here SARSAT can function\neither as a independent satellite within an emergency call system\nor as additional SAR (Search and Rescue) payload of another satellite system. Besides, a differentiation must be made between a\ngeneral rescue service or an exclusive sea-rescue service. This\nwould allow satellite or track-specific differentiations within\nthese two areas.\n\nFig.3; Alternate systems\n\nSAASA Ir\n\ne s ^\nSept R 7 cu 0\t\n\nI serviCL-i\t\n\nI R A ,\t\n\nPjt A PF OA4\n\noen.\nService I\n\nR\n\n\t\n\nFig.4 Number of Satellites or System Alturnatives\n\nGIN.

This system requires eight satellites. This number can, however, be reduced if a time\ndelay (the time difference between transmission of the\nsignal and localization by the satellite) is permitted.\n\n/6\n\ni\n\n0 Qeost a tionary a nd\n\npolar o rbits\n\nTo cover 1.00% of the earth\'s surface by means of geostationary satellites, additional satellites which circle\nthe globe in polar orbits have to be provided. For this\npossibility 3 geostationary and 3 polar orbits are suggested. To achieve 100% coverage at all times this number\nwould have to be increased to seven (3 geostationary and\n4 polar).\n\n11. MARECS IN THE INMARSAT-SYSTEM\n\n\t\n\nIn 1981 the INMARSAT system will take over from the MARISAT\nsystem which has been in operation since 1976 and is now at the\nend of its life. Both systems serve to connect Ships to the in-\n\nternational public 11?el.ephone/Telex,"Facsimile network.\nPresently the MARISAT system consists of three geostationary\nsatellites (over the Atlantic at 15 0 West, over the Pacific at\n176.5 0 East, over the Indian Ocean at 73 0 East). The successor,\nINMARSAT, will consist of three MARECS and three additional\nINTELSAT-V satellites with an additional maritime payload. The\ncapacity of the future INMARSAT are summarized in Fig-5.\nIt is of special interest that here telex and telephone connections can be established with absolute precedence in case of\nemergencies at sea.\n\ni\n\n^o\n\n/7\n\ni\n\nFig.5: MARECS in the INMARSAT System\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE INMARSAT-SYSTEM s\nWorld-wide telephone, Telox, facsimile service\n(MARECS: Atlantic, Indian Ocean)\n50 transmission channels\n* no wait, constantly good quality\nindependent of distance and weather\n* automatic data transmission\n* REAL TIME sea distress radio transmission\nI\n\n5. SATELLI\'T\'E--FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY\nThis Telex/Telephone connection can be augmented by a sea-distress radio-signaler (in the 1.6 GHz range), which was developed\nin Germany. This device stores regularly (approx. every 30 rein.)\ncurrent position reports. In an emergency the device sends the\nLatest position automatically to the satellite which is in a geostationary orbit.\n\nA\n\nThe American/Canadian/Prench SARSAT concept was introduced\nIn the first section. Initially this system operates in the\n121/243.0 MHz range with satellites of the TIROS -N series, orbiting\nat a height of 800 km. An extension to include the 1 106 MHz\nrange and a tra y;l tion to geostationary orbits is intended.\nThese solutions seem extravagant. The goal must be an extremely cost conscious system for the user (e.g. the shipping company)\t\nHere the retention of the 121.5/2+3.0 MHz beacon is a.\ncase in point. At present approx. 190,000 airplanes and 2000 ships\nare equipped with this device. Their relatively wear signal has\nto be located by low-flying satellites (Doppler-Principle). The\ntask is to make specially equipped low-priced satellites available.\nIn the following sections a concept along these lines is being\nintroduced.\n5.1 SATELLITE ORBI TS\n\nNUMBERS AND TIME DELAYS\n\nFor the basic tasks\nemergency signal transmission\n-_ localization of the sender\nsatellites in an orbit at 1000 km in a quasi polar, sun-synchronized\norbit are provided for. Four satellites in an orbit at 1070 km,\nwhose node lines (orbit intersections with the equator level.) are\neach offset by 45 0 , cover the earth completely with a horizontal\n\nminimum elevation of 10 0 . It takes 106.4 minutes to complete such\nan orbit. That also corresponds with the maximum waiting time\n(time delay) at the equator if one-each satellite circles on every\norbit. Since the covered areas overlap closer to the poles the\ndelay time will be shorter, which favors the heavy traffic on the\nAtlantic.\n.separate starting times are required for the four orbits so\nthat a considerable overcapacity is present if all possible carriers are taken \'Into consideration. This would result in double\nstarts with a weather and an observation satellite. Here, of course,\nSARSAT would be in the position of a junior partner, hence it would\n\nb\nt\n\nhave to makes ooncerssione in respect to time of start and type or\norbit..\nUsing an orbit at 57 0 would offer a way out\n(Fig.6).\n/9\n\nSince ZTR could establish such an orbit with the SPACESHUTTLE the opportunity for p i g g y baok-flights seams to offer itself\nhere sooner and also more frequently. The same height of orbit\nwould in this ease exclude the areas beyond 80 0 latitude\nfrom the\nservice area., If the pots were to be included, a height of 21\n140 km\n.\nFig-6: orbits and areas of overlap at an i nclination of 57 0 and\na nodal offset of 600\n\nw.s\t\n\n.^\' \xc2\xb0,..\xe2\x80\xa2 ..v ., ^` o^"\'\nv`l w dart\n\nr\t\n\nx\nr "\'`a.\n\n^P\nI\n4\n\n!`^^\t\n\nE\n\n^\t\n\njam`"\'^-\xe2\x80\xa2.,,. }" ,..,,..^^\n\n,y f\n\n7\n\nI(\t\ni\t\n\na\t\n\nIt\n\nf\n\n^\nr rte\'\n\n13\ndam`\n\nwould be required which, among other things, would lead to a strong\nexposure to radiation from the Van Allen Belt.\nIt takes only three satellites at a height of 131$ km with an\ninclination of 57 0 in orbits that are offset by 60 0 in the node\nline to cover the globe. Points on the earth\'s surface beyond\n82 0 latitude will have, however, an elevation below 10 0 (e.g. only\napprox. 2 0 at the poles).\nThe node line rotation; for the starting orbit at the flight \t\n.\nheight of the SHUTTL" and the elevated operational orbit differ by\n1.7 0 per day. If the the orbit elevations are performed in 35 -day\nintervals, all three sattelites could be transported with the same\nSHUTTLE flight. A fourth satellite, started concurrently, could\nstay in a lower orbit as a reserve. If needed, it could .replace\nany of the three satellites.\nThis multiple start of three or four SARSAT units and the\nsimultaneous drifting over the orbit would automatical-y Lead to\nminimal starting expenses. Required are satellites which can establish the operational course under their own power.\n\n5.2 CONFIGURATION OF THE SATELLITE\n\nBy maintaining the usual space utilization, the estimated\nmass of the satellite (approx.270 kg) will correspond to a space\nof 1 m 3 . Two coil antennas, which are mounted outside, are pro vided fir (Fi g -7). The power requirements of the payload of 50 W\nmakes a solar generator performance of 150 W seem necessary, because of the long periods of shadow time and because the solar\ngenerator surfaces of about 2 m 2 are not of the follow-type.\nIf a cuboid of 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 m 3 with a strong central tube\nt\nIs chosen, the cont(,mplated triple start can be accommodated.\n\n1L^\n\n/10\n\nFig -7: SARSAT configuration in orbit \t\n\n/10\nctd.\n\n\xc2\xb0 Tf Thor Delta is being used, three or four sattelites s4 \xc2\xb0tld /11\nctd.\nbe stacked like donuts or the central tube could serve\t\nas a connecting adapter for the piggyback load,\nif ARIANE is being used, the Latter method\nemployed,\n\nhas to be\n\nif the shuttle is being used, four sattelites could be\nstowed on a quasi divider wall..\nThat means that the solar generator installation is then always\n\non the outside walls which have to be folded out at various tiltangles to accomodate various types of orbit.

This Layout will be established\nduring study phase A.\nPhase B will see the comp +:t ion of the engineering drawings\nwhich will be immediately\t\nby the building of a model..

The development of production preparations and flight unit production will require another year. If\na time of nine months is projected for integration and final test\nflight, a launch care be assured three years after the start of the\nwork.\n\nV\n\nVig.9: SARSAT time table\ny0ars\nDefinition of Mission & Concept\n\nGo-Ahead Signal\n\nicen;\n\nBuild and Equip Model and Test \t\nfor Stability\nIntegration of Experimental Mod,\nand Thermal Test\n\nDefinition of Electron, Adapt.\nDevol,&Bld.jests of Model\nAcceptance Tests\n\nIntegration of Flying Model\t\nFinal Acceptance Test\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\n\nes.\n\nLAUNCH\n\nIt is to be understood that this time table may show some \t\nquestion marks as far as electronics are \t\nconcerned.
