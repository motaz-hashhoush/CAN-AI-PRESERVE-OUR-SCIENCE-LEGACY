The TMM representations are flexible enough to permit the representation of precedence constraints, metric constraints between activities, and constraints relative to a variety of references (e.g., Mission Elapsed Time vs. Mission Day). The TMM also supports a simple form of causal reasoning (projection), dynamic database updates, and monitoring specified database properties as changes occur over time. The greatest apparent advantage to using the TMM is the flexibility added to the scheduling process: schedules are constructed by a process of 'iterative refinement,' in which scheduling decisions correspond to constraining an activity either with respect to another activity or with respect to one time line. The schedule becomes more detailed as activities and constraints are added. Undoing a scheduling decision means removing a constraint, not removing an activity from a specified place on the time line. For example, we can move an activity around on the time line by deleting constraints and adding new ones.", "title": "Scheduling with partial orders and a causal model", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930022941, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Boddy, Mark"}, "organization": {"name": "Honeywell, Inc.", "location": "Minneapolis, MN, United States"}}, "id": "ad42ca24d78540e4bfdf25e3a8658fdf"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930022941, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carciofini, Jim"}, "organization": {"name": "Honeywell, Inc.", "location": "Minneapolis, MN, United States"}}, "id": "051df7e1fdd04b21b8873c4eca7d6bb6"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930022941, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hadden, George D."}, "organization": {"name": "Honeywell, Inc.", "location": "Minneapolis, MN, United States"}}, "id": "ca1003b7b9a34366b0feb41de7d4a73b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930022941, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930022941, "id": "0288d1be10f44964a9cf489e0103225c", "publicationName": "NASA.
