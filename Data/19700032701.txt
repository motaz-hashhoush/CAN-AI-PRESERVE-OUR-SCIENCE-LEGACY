No. 485,960\n14 Claims. tCl. 30-228)\n\'I he invention described herein may be manufactured\nand used by o r for the Government of the United States\nof America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.\nThis invention relates to cable cutting tools, and more\nparticularly to a device for cutting control lines on parachutes or the like when the b a d connected thereto is likely to descend on a body of water.\nIn the recovery of certain types of scientific instruments, spacecnaft, and other loads descending by parachute, a swift retrieval is essential in order to avoid loss\nor damage thereto by the elements. Due to the unpredictable nature of winds, the load will oftentimes alight\non a body of water where, because of the partial inflation\nof the parachute, it will ibe driven in varying directions,\nthereby causing additional delay before recovery. A\ncommon expedient for precluding this delay is the use\nof automatic cable cutters which sever the parachute control lines from the load upon impact with the Iwater. In\nthe construction and attachment of these lines to a load\nit is often required to attach them internally of the load\nitself because of their connection to motors controlling\nvarious guide panels on the parachute. Thus the apertures in the spacecraft wall through which the lines extend\nbecome unobstructed holes when the lines ,are severed.\nUpon contact with the water, seepage into the load will\nresult, causing damage to the electrical parts, scientific\nequipment, or other components therein. Various devices such as cutter means in association with a mechanical type closure for shutting out the w\'ater have been devised to preclude such results, but all are either complicated in structure or present unsatisfactory results. The\nintstant invention is directed to a device which not only\nobviates the aforementioned problem, but does so with a\nmechanism which is simple in design and completely effective in result. It embodies a piston-in-bore type cutter\nin which the piston\'s dynamic force is utilized to both\nsever the cable and to pressurize \'a viscous grease housed\nin the bore end. The grease, upon impact \'by the piston,\nis forced into sealing relation around the piston adjacent\nthe cable hole or eye, thus precluding any leakage into\nthe load. Aside from effectively severing the cable and\ninsulating the h a d from seepage, it will be seen that due\nto the simplicity of the structure the chances of malfunction are practicalIy nonexistent, and the cost of construction is minimal.\nThese and numerous other features of the invention\nwill \'become apparent to the reader upon examination of\nthe following detailed description, claims, ,and drawings\nwherein:\nFIG. 1 shows a half section perspective v i m of the\nimproved cutter of the invention;\nFIG. 2 shows a sectional view along the longitudinal\naxis of the cutter;\nFIG. 3 shows an end view of the improved cutter with\nthe rear plate removed therefrom; and\nFIG. 4 shows in plan view the cutter of FIG. 1.\nAs shown in FIG. 1, the cutter includes a frame or\n\'body housing 3 which is generally rectangular in exterior\nshape and which has a longitudinal bore 5 extending from\nthe forward end 7 to the rearward end 9. It should be\nnoticed that the bore is of larger diameter at the forward\nend than a t the rearward, the two ends being joined, how-\n\nce\n\never, )by the sloping common wall or shoulder 10 at approximately the longitudinal center of the housing. At\nthe fol;ward end of the housing is forward plate 19 which\nhas circular threaded hole I1 therein of smaller radius than\nthe bore, but in axial alignment therewith. A squib or\nother explosive cartridge means is threaded into the hole\n11. The forward plate 19 is disposed over a recessed conventional O-ring 19 and is afltixed to the housing 3 by a\nwasher ,and allan-head lock nuts 13. The rearplate-15\nis aflixed to the rear of housing 3 in the same manner\nand completely encloses that end.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, there is an aperture or eye\n19 at the rear of the housing, extending through the ]bore\nwalls perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The para15 chute cable 20 extends through this aperture with one\nend connected to the control panels of the parachute and\nthe other end to the control motor inside the load. The\neye 19, which as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 to be elongate\nin form, has both a forwtard 2 1 and a rearward 23 end,\n20 with the latter serving as the cutting base when severance\n(OCCUTS. The eye is elongated to allow for oscillating\nmovement of the cable during payout or retraction.\nA series of apertures extend outwardly from the bore.\nAt the forward end is aperture 29 through which extends\n25 ,a shear pin 31 so designed to extend into the piston and\nto withhold movement of it in the bore and retain it adjacent the squib until the latter is fired. Approximately\nhalfway down the axis of the bore\'s large end, and extending radially into the bore, is a first vent 33, the pur30 pose of which is to vent pyrotechnic gases generated on\nexplosion of the squib. The venting occurs \'after the\ncable has been severed and is therefore merely to relieve\ninternal pressure in the large end of the bore. Disposed\nfurther down the bore toward the rear end plate, is a\n35 second vent 37 for venting compressed gas in front of the\npiston\'s sloped wall 39 as it moves down the bore. By\nplacing the vents in front and lbehind the piston there is\nlittle, if any, velocity reduction in the piston\'s movement\ntoward the oable. An annular impact washer 4 1 made of\n40 soft lead or other equivalent material, is set in the bore\nin abutting relation to the shoulder 10 for absorbing the\nkinetic energy of the moving piston,\nWith reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 there is shown a pair\nof bores or metering grooves 43, 45 disposed in axially\n45 parallel relation to the main bore 5 at 120" and 240" to\nthe vertical. The grooves, which transfer a viscous\ngrease or equivalent substance 44 (see FIG. 2 ) from the\nrear end of the bore to the surface of the piston adjacent\nthe eye, are radially disposed near enough to the bore\n50 axis to provide a communicating slot or opening 47 of\nsomewhat smaller dimension than the groove itself. The\nmetering grooves extend from the rear plate 15 past the\nforward edge 21 of the eye, thus assuring transference 9f\nthe grease completely over the piston\'s surface.\nExtending outwardly from the metering grooves adja55\ncent the forwardmost end thereof are smaller grooves or\nholes 51 for venting the grease after it has traversed the\nmetering grooves 43, thus precluding excessive pressure\nbuildup in the rear end of the cutter.\nAs previously explained, the entire cutter is aflixed to\n80\nthe load as by a mounting plate 55, and is in proximate\nrelation to the control motor (schematically shown in\nFIG. 1) which pays out and retracts the cable extending\nto the parachute control panel. Upon impact of the load\n65 with the water, an electrical signal closes a switch and\nfires the squib in the cutter\'s forward end 7. The pressure instantaneously overcomes the resisting force of pin\n31, shearing it off and propelling the piston toward the\ncable at the rear of the housing. Although initial contact of the piston and cable may occur at the forward wall\n21 of the eye 19, no shear action occurs until the cable\nis pushed to the rear wall 23, at which time shear occurs\n\n\'\'\n\n. . .\n3,320,669\n\n3\nwith the sheared piece of cable 57 being carried down\nthe bore into the viscous grease (FIG. 1). Upon impact,\nthe grease is forced into the metering grooves 43, 45\nwhich transmit it to the forward end 21 of eye 19. When\nthe grooves 43, 45 are completely filled, the grease, due\nto the piston\xe2\x80\x99s continued dynamic force, is pressured further into the bore 5 itself, encircling the piston 25 and\nthus filling any voids or passages in the bore around eye\n19. It is, of course, recognized that the dimensions of\nthe piston, bore, and piston travel are such as to allow\nimpact of the piston with the grease before there is contact between the piston wall 39 and the impact washer\n41. After contact, over-pressurization and kick back are\nprevented by the aforementioned small vents 51 which\nallow the viscous grease to escape when under high\npressure.\nIt is apparent that various modifications and alterations to the instant invention may be made. For example, the metering grooves may be disposed in the piston\nitself rather than in the bore, and likewise the piston,\nbore, and cutter in general may assume different shapes\nand configurations. While the cuttes is primarily intended for use in severing lines on parachutes, it is obviously useful in other applications where insulation is\nrequired upon severance of a transverse cable, rope, or\nsimilar means. Thus it should be recognized that such\nalterations and modifications are within both the spirit\nand scope of the instant disclosure and may be made without departing from the invention as defined by the appended claims.\nThat which is claimed is:\n1.
