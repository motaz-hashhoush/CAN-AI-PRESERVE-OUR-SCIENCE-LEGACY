Innovation Research Technology Into Human Exploration\nand Operations Mission Directorate Projects for 2016\nHung D. Nguyen and Gynelle C. Steele\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nAbstract\nThis report is intended to help NASA program and project managers incorporate Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR) technologies into NASA Human Exploration and Operations Mission\nDirectorate (HEOMD) projects. Other Government and commercial project managers interested in\nHEOMD funding opportunities through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SBIR program will find this report useful as well.\n\nIntroduction\nIncorporating Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)-developed technology into NASA projects\nis important, especially given the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s limited resources for technology development. Understanding\nthe SBIR solicitation process can help small businesses and Human Exploration and Operations Mission\nDirectorate (HEOMD) project managers form partnerships to incorporate SBIR technologies into NASA\nprograms and projects. For example, when HEOMD program managers identify specific SBIR subtopics\nthat are likely to generate technologies that could apply to their programs or projects, the SBIR office can\nprovide information about previously developed technologies that could be incorporated into their work.\nPrincipal investigators (PIs) for small businesses can also benefit from understanding NASA program and\nproject needs, increasing the likelihood that technologies developed by their small businesses will be\nintegrated into HEOMD projects. SBIR solicitations for the current fiscal year are posted at\nhttp://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/solicitations.\nThe SBIR program\xe2\x80\x99s original intent was for technologies that had completed Phase II to be ready for\nintegration into NASA programs. In many cases, however, there was a gap between Technology\nReadiness Levels (TRLs) 5 and 6 that needed to be closed. Now the SBIR program supports its small\nbusiness partners with three post Phase II options that focus on creating opportunities for\ncommercialization as well as technology integration. The Phase II Enhancement (Phase II\xe2\x80\x93E), Phase II\nExpanded (Phase II\xe2\x80\x93X), and Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) options also provide opportunities\nfor Phase II technologies to be integrated and tested in the NASA system platform or in the space\nenvironment. Details on post Phase II initiatives and opportunities, including funding options, may be\nfound at http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/content/post-phase-ii-initiatives.\n\nFiscal Year 2016 SBIR Subtopics and Subtopic Summaries\nFigure 1 shows HEOMD topics and subtopics for fiscal year 2016; SBIR descriptions for each\nHEOMD subtopic follow. Research topics and subtopics for all directorates are listed in Chapter 9 of the\nPhase I SBIR/STTR Program Solicitation for fiscal year 2016, available at\nhttps://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/56329/detail?data=ch9&s=56316\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Fiscal year 2016 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Human Exploration and Operations Mission\nDirectorate (HEOMD) topics and subtopics.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n2\n\nH1.01 In Situ Resource Utilization: Production of Feedstock for Manufacturing and\nConstruction\nThe overall goal of in situ resource utilization (ISRU) is to transform available resources, both natural\nand man-made, on extraterrestrial surfaces into usable materials and products that assist in sustaining and\ngrowing human exploration capabilities. ISRU involves all the steps associated with identifying,\ncollecting, and converting local resources into products that can reduce mission mass, cost, and/or risk. It\nis imperative that novel technologies be developed to effectively utilize these resources for missioncritical consumables and to produce feedstock for additive manufacturing of replacement parts,\nconstruction for habitat, and infrastructure expansion.\n\nH2.01 LOX/Methane In-Space Propulsion\nNASA is developing high-thrust in-space chemical propulsion capabilities to enable human and\nrobotic missions into the proving ground (Mars and beyond). Successful proposals are sought for focused\ninvestments in key technologies and design concepts that may transform the path for future exploration of\nMars while providing component and system-level cost and mass savings. In-space propulsion is defined\nas the development and demonstration of technologies for ascent, orbit transfer, pulsing attitude/reaction\ncontrol, and descent engines. The goal of this subtopic is to examine novel technology options that\ninclude the use of additive manufacturing or other low-cost processes that save mass and/or cost\ncompared with current state-of-the-art technologies and fabrication methods.\n\nH2.02 Nuclear Thermal Propulsion\nSolid core nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) has been identified as a high priority technology for\nfuture human exploration of Mars. This solicitation will examine a range of modern technologies\nassociated with NTP. Specific technologies of interest include reactor fuel element designs with hightemperature, high-power density to maximize hydrogen propellant heating; concepts to cool down reactor\ndecay heat after shutdown to minimize the amount of open cycle propellant used; low-risk reactor design\nfeatures that allow more flexible criticality control during burns beyond the reactor circumferential\nrotating control drums and/or provide nuclear safety for ground processing, launch, and possible aborts;\nand ground test engine effluent processing technologies for efficient containment and/or filtering of\nradioactive particles and noble gases and management of high-temperature, high-flow hydrogen exhausts.\n\nH2.03 High Power Electric Propulsion\nThe goal of this subtopic is to develop innovative, high-power (>100 kW) electric propulsion\nsystems. High-power solar or nuclear electric propulsion may enable dramatic mass and cost savings for\nlunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers, at power levels\nthat enable a wide range of exploration missions. Innovations and advancements leading to improvements\nin the end-to-end performance of high-power electric propulsion systems are of interest. Methods are\nsought to increase overall system efficiency; improve system and/or component life or durability; reduce\nsystem and/or component mass, complexity, and development issues; or provide other definable benefits.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n3\n\nH2.04 Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation\nThis subtopic solicits technologies that support NASA\xe2\x80\x99s exploration goals by addressing the storage\nand transfer of cryogenic propellants such as hydrogen, oxygen, and methane. This effort includes a wide\nrange of applications, scales, and environments consistent with future NASA missions. Such missions\ninclude (but are not limited to) the Exploration Upper Stage, In Situ Resource Utilization in cooperation\nwith Mars Landers, and the Evolvable Mars Campaign.\n\nH3.01 Environmental Monitoring\nEnvironmental monitoring comprises the following four monitoring disciplines: air, water, microbial,\nand acoustics. These functional needs are required to address identified risks to crew health during\nExploration-class missions. The International Space Station has employed a wide variety of analytical\ninstruments to deal with critical items. Limitations to current approaches for missions beyond low Earth\norbit include a reliance on return sample and ground analysis; too much crew time required; constraints\non size, mass, and power; lack of portability; and insufficient calibration life. A concerted effort is\nunderway to address these gaps, determine the most promising solutions, and mature those solutions to\nground and flight technology demonstrations. Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization,\nreliability, lifetime, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are of interest.\n\nH3.02 Environmental Control and Life Support for Spacecraft and Habitats\nSolutions and innovations are needed for technology that supports the mass- and energy-efficient\nmaintenance of closed air, water, and waste systems in spacecraft habitats that operate on planetary\nsurfaces such as Mars and in the microgravity environment of space. Three specific focus areas have been\nidentified: (1) new applications of the heat melt compactor for contaminant control and waste\nmanagement, (2) cleaning agents and physicochemical treatments for habitat housekeeping and\nlaundering clothes, and (3) surface treatments that limit biofilm and scaling within water processing\nsystem plumbing lines.\n\nH4.03 Extra-Vehicular Activity Space Suit Power, Avionics, and Software Systems\nSpacesuit power, avionics, and software (PAS) advancements are needed to extend extravehicular\nactivity (EVA) capability on the International Space Station beyond 2020 and in future human space\nexploration missions. NASA is presently developing a spacesuit system called the Advanced\nExtravehicular Mobility Unit (AEMU). The AEMU PAS system is responsible for power supply and\ndistribution for the overall EVA system; collecting and transferring several types of data to and from\nother mission assets; providing avionics hardware to perform numerous data display and in-suit\nprocessing functions; and furnishing information systems to supply data to enable crewmembers to\nperform their tasks with autonomy and efficiency. NASA is seeking flight-rated electronic devices to\ncomplement the existing inventory of flight-rated parts so as to enable the creation of an advanced\navionics suite for spacesuits.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n4\n\nH5.01 Large Deployable Structures for Smallsats\nThis subtopic seeks deployable structures innovations in two areas for proposed lunar and deep space\nmissions: (1) large solar sails with at least 85 m2 of deployed surface area for 6U cubesats and (2) large\nsolar arrays with at least 200 W of power for 6U to 12U cubesats, or 600 W for 50 to 100 kg microsats.\nDesign solutions must demonstrate high deployment reliability and predictability with minimum mass\nand launch volume and maximum strength, stiffness, stability, and durability.\n\nH5.03 Multifunctional Materials and Structures: Integrated Structural Health Monitoring\nfor Long Duration Habitats\nFor fiscal year 2016, this SBIR subtopic sought innovative, multifunctional approaches to integrating\nstructural health monitoring into materials for long-duration deep space habitats, including (but not\nlimited to) state-of-the art thin-ply composites and soft-goods materials for expandable habitat structural\nconcepts, during or after fabrication, to enable evaluation of structural properties and failure prediction\nover the duration of the habitat\xe2\x80\x99s operational life. The goal for long-duration space habitat design is failsafe operation, providing monitoring and early prediction of failure onset via structural health monitoring\nand a benign, progressive failure architecture that allows for safe evacuation even at or after the first\nfailure point.\n\nH7.01 Ablative Thermal Protection Systems Technologies\nThis subtopic calls for the development, modeling, testing, and monitoring of ablative thermal\nprotection materials, high char yield adhesives, and/or systems that will support planetary entry. Ablative\nthermal protection systems (TPS) technologies support the goal of developing advancements in polymers\nfor bonding and/or gap-filling ablative materials, instrumentation systems, and analytical modeling for the\nhigher performance TPS materials currently in development for future Exploration missions. These\nablative TPS materials include felt or woven material precursors impregnated with polymers and/or\nadditives to improve ablation and insulative performance.\n\nH8.01 Thermal Energy Conversion\nNASA needs innovative technologies that convert thermal energy into electricity for space power\ngeneration on orbiting platforms, extraterrestrial surfaces, and space transportation vehicles. The thermal\nenergy could be supplied by nuclear reactors, radioisotope heat sources, solar concentrators, chemical\nreactions, or as waste heat from other space systems. The focus of this subtopic is the energy conversion\nsubsystem. Proposals are requested on thermal energy conversion approaches that offer high efficiency,\nlow mass, high reliability, long life, and low cost. Candidate technologies include thermodynamic heat\nengines such as Stirling, Brayton, and Rankine as well as thermoelectric and thermionic devices.\nAncillary components used to deliver heat (e.g., heat transport loops and heat pipes) to the energy\nconversion and reject waste heat (e.g., heat pipes and radiators) are also of interest.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n5\n\nH8.02 Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers\nTechnologies are sought that improve the durability, efficiency, and reliability of solid oxide systems.\nOf particular interest are those technologies that address challenges common to fuel cells fed by oxygen\nand methane and electrolyzers fed by carbon dioxide and/or water. Hydrocarbon fuels of interest include\nmethane and fuels generated by processing lunar and Mars soils.\n\nH8.03 Advanced Photovoltaic Systems\nAdvanced photovoltaic (PV) power generation and enabling power system technologies are sought\nwith improvements in power system performance (conversion efficiency, mass, stowed volume, etc.),\nmission operation capability, and reliability for PV power systems supporting NASA human exploration\nmissions. The technologies being sought should enable or enhance the ability to provide low cost, low\nmass, and higher efficiency solar power systems that support high-power solar electric propulsion, high\nradiation and extreme environments, and Mars surface NASA missions.\n\nH8.04 Advanced Next Generation Batteries\nBreakthrough battery cell technologies that far exceed the specific energy and energy density or\ntemperature performance of state-of-the-art lithium-based cell technologies are required to achieve\nfar-term energy storage goals for human and robotic missions to the Moon, near-Earth orbit, Venus, and\nMars. NASA is seeking innovative, advanced electrochemical cell and battery technologies that can\naggressively address requirements for these future missions. Proposed chemistries and components must\nmeet performance goals while simultaneously delivering a high level of safety. Components and systems\nare specifically sought for Extravehicular Activities, Human Lunar and Mars Landers and Rovers, and the\nMars Ascent Vehicle.\n\nH9.01 Long Range Optical Telecommunications\nThe Long Range Optical Telecommunications subtopic seeks innovative technologies in free-space\noptical communications for increased data volume returns from space missions in multiple domains.\nProposals are sought in the following specific areas (TRL3 Phase I, to mature to TRL4\xe2\x80\x93TRL5 in Phase\nII): (1) low-mass large apertures for high effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) laser transceivers,\n(2) high-gigabit laser transmitter and receiver optical-electronic subsystems, (3) waveform signal\nprocessing, (4) large-aperture ground receiver subsystem technologies, (5) superconducting magnesium\ndiboride (MgB2) thin films for ground receiver detectors, (6) cryogenic readout electronics for largeformat superconducting nanowire arrays, (7) beaconless pointing subsystems, and (8) low mass/low\npower/cold-survivable optical transceivers for planetary-lander-to-orbiter links.\n\nH9.03 Flight Dynamics and Navigation Systems\nNASA is investing in the advancement of systems, devices, and software algorithms and tools to\nenhance and extend its capabilities for providing spacecraft position, attitude, and velocity estimates and\nto improve spacecraft navigation, guidance, and control functions. Efforts must demonstrate significant\nrisk reduction, cost reduction, performance benefit, or enabling capability. Proposals can support mission\nengineering activities at any stage of development, from the concept phase or pre-formulation through\noperations and disposal. Applications in low Earth orbit, lunar, and deep space are in scope for this\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n6\n\nsubtopic. Proposals that could lead to the replacement of the Goddard Trajectory Determination System\nor leverage state-of-the-art capabilities already developed by NASA, such as the General Mission\nAnalysis Tool, are especially encouraged. Proposers who contemplate licensing NASA technologies are\nhighly encouraged to coordinate with the appropriate NASA technology transfer offices prior to\nsubmission of their proposals.\n\nH12.03 Novel Imaging Technologies for Space Medicine\nNASA is seeking novel medical imaging techniques in two areas: (1) software-based ultrasound and\n(2) portable x ray.\n(1) Software-based ultrasound\xe2\x80\x99s smaller footprint, lower power consumption, and lower emissions\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum make it particularly well suited for space medicine. Ultrasound also\nprovides medically useful capabilities outside the realm of imaging, such as quantitative ultrasound\ndiagnostic techniques and therapeutic techniques that utilize the energy in the ultrasound signal itself.\n(2) Portable x-ray technology can fill the gaps in ultrasound\xe2\x80\x99s ability to diagnose certain medical\nconditions that might arise during space flight, particularly space flight to deep space destinations.\nLimitations include the relatively higher volumetric footprint, higher power requirements, and higher\nelectromagnetic emissions (particularly ionizing radiation, both in terms of dosage delivered to the crew\nand stray emissions) of x-ray devices and other imaging devices. NASA needs new technology\ndevelopments to overcome these limitations and ensure on-orbit diagnosis of certain dental and\nmusculoskeletal conditions.\n\nH13.02 Non-Destructive Evaluation Sensors\nTechnologies sought under this SBIR program include advanced sensors, sensor systems, sensor\ntechniques, and software applications that will enhance or expand NASA\xe2\x80\x99s current sensor capability.\nTargeting of structural components of space flight hardware (e.g., lightweight structural materials such as\ncomposites and thin metals) is desirable, though not required. Technologies sought include modular, smart,\nadvanced nondestructive evaluation sensor systems and associated capture and analysis software. It is\nadvantageous for techniques to include the development of quantum sensor, metasensor, and nanosensor\ntechnologies for deployment. Technologies that enable the inspection of large, complex structures are\nencouraged. Technologies should provide reliable assessments of the location and extent of damage.\n\nH14.01 International Space Station Utilization\nNASA continues to invest in the near- and mid-term development of highly desirable systems and\ntechnologies that provide innovative ways to leverage existing International Space Station (ISS) facilities\nfor new scientific payloads and to provide on-orbit analysis to enhance capabilities. Additionally, NASA\nis supporting commercial science, engineering, and technology to provide low Earth orbit commercial\nopportunities utilizing the ISS. Utilization of the ISS is limited by available up-mass, down-mass, and\ncrew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed and in use.\nInnovative interfaces between existing hardware and systems that are common to ground research could\nfacilitate increased and faster payload development and subsequent utilization. Technologies that are\nportable and able to be matured rapidly for flight demonstration on the ISS are of particular interest.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n7\n\nPhase I Contract Awards\nFigure 2 indicates the number of HEOMD-associated Phase I contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Fiscal year 2016 Phase I contract awards associated with the Human Exploration and Operations\nMission Directorate (HEOMD).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219460\n\n8\n\nHEOMD Program and Project Summaries\nHEOMD topics and subtopics strategically align with HEOMD programs and projects and support\nthe Directorate\xe2\x80\x99s current needs and objectives.
