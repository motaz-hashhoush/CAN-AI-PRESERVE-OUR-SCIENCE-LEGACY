Analysis of the two sets of experimental data for isolated events led to the classification of high-latitude  field-aligned currents as purely temporal or purely spatial variations. Magnetic field disturbances calculated by using these simple current models and the measured particle fluxes were in good agreement with measured field values. Although fluxes of electrons of greater than 1 keV were detected primarily on the night side, magnetometer disturbances indicative of field-aligned currents were seen at all local times, in both the visual auroral regions and the day side polar cusp.  Thus electrons with energies of less than about 1 keV are the prime charge carriers in high-latitude day side field-aligned currents.", "title": "Simultaneous particle and field observations of field-aligned currents", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750035258, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Berko, F.
