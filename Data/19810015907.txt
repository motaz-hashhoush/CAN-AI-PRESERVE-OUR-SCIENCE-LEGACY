Radial face seals operate with extremely small\ngaps between the stationary or primary seal ring and the\nopposing face of the rotor ring or seal seat. It is necessary that the tolerances for the existing space or gap be\nclosely monitored so that the existing gap is held as\nclosely as possible to its design value so as to avoid\nexcessive fluid leakage or high friction loss. To realize\nthis, the primary seal ring must be placed in a stabilized\ncondition both under hydrostatic as well as hydrodynamic conditions. That is, proper equilibrium must be\nreached between high-pressure and low-pressure regions both under conditions when the liquids involved\nare at rest and to the pressures they exert or transmit as\nwell as under conditions when motion of the fluids exert\na force which acts on the elements of the seal immersed\nin the fluids.\nConventional radial face seals consisting of a primary\nseal ring or stator member and a rotor seal ring are\ninherently unstable, generally due to an angular misalignment brought about by hydrodynamic effects establishing a pressure differential which produces a\ntransverse moment which alters and disturbs the seal of\nthe primary or stator seal ring. This pressure distribution produces the dynamic instability having a detrimental effect upon the resulting seal.\nIt has been found that means must be provided within\na face-type fluid seal so as to eliminate the instability\ncreated with respect to the seal as a result of the hydrodynamic effects within the system. One approach in the\ndesign of the face-type fluid seals to control the seal\nperformance and to accommodate the axial movement\nhas been to isolate both the rotor and the stator from the\npump housing. A discussion of such a design for hydrostatic seals may be found in ASME Publication 68WA/LUB-9, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spring-Supported Hydrostatic\nSeal\xe2\x80\x9d, by I. J. Billington and T. E. Fitzsimmons. However, it is not desirable to be relegated to a system\nwhereby it is necessary to isolate the rotor and stator\nfrom the pump housing.\nIt has further been found that it is important that the\nstator ring of the face-type fluid seal be well supported\nrelative to the housing and adapted so as to resist annular overturning moments which may act on the stator\nring. To achieve this purpose, a stator ring has been\nproposed having a support annulus formed on the back\nface thereof through which there may be a force transmitted which tends to oppose any overturning moment\n\n1\n0\n\nl5\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nwhich develops on the ring. Although achieving certain\ndesired results, this approach is not without its disadvantages. For example, the annulus is fixed or becomes\na part of the stator ring and subject to imperfections as\nwell as wear which reduces the dependability of the\nproposed system. Furthermore, slots must be cut in the\nsupport annulus so as to provide for pressure communication of the fluid in the system. The purpose of the\nsupport annulus is to provide an additional force acting\nagainst the back face of the stator seal so that the additional force tends to overcome the overturning moments created by the hydrodynamic system. However,\nwith the use of an annulus of the nature herein described, the incumbent system becomes inflexible in that\nthe position of the support annulus is quite critical and\nnot adaptable to a change in the force vectors necessary\nto oppose the overturning moment produced within the\nsystem. Thus, the manufacturing tolerances of such a\nmember are such that the support annulus cannot always be machined to assure that it will contact the\nsupport face throughout its entire length. Thus, the\nmaterial requirements in fabricating the support annulus\nbecome critical.\nSUMMARY O F THE INVENTION\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to\nprovide a system which will overcome the above-noted\ndisadvantages.\nIt is still another object of the present invention to\nprovide a system which will reduce the transverse moment produced by the present hydrodynamic effects in\nthe system by attenuating the circumferential pressure\ndistribution in the primary or stator seal.\nStill another object of the present invention is to\nprovide a system whereby both axial and angular stiffness can be produced in the resulting seal.\nYet still another object of the present invention is to\nproduce a self-stabilizing radial face seal.\nYet still a further object of the present invention is to\nprovide a face-type fluid seal adapted so as to assure\nproper alignment of the primary seal ring as the seal is\nbrought into operating conditions.\nYet still another object of the present invention is to\nprovide a uniform circumferential force distribution so\nas to eliminate seal misalignment.\nOther objects and further scope of applicability of the\npresent invention will become apparent from rhe detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description along with\nthe discussion of the accompanying drawings indicating\npreferred embodiments of the present invention, are\ngiven by way of illustration only since various changes\nand modifications within the spirit and scope of the\ninstant invention would become apparent to those\nskilled in the art as a result of this detailed description.\nAny such modifications and changes should be considered to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.\n\n6o GENERAL DESCRIPTION O F T H E INVENTION\n\nThe above-stated objects and others are accomplished in accordance with the present invention, generally speaking by providing a radial face seal comprising\n65 a primary seal ring and a seal seat mounted on a shaft\nwhich extends through a housing. Generally speaking,\nthe seal is adapted to seal a high-pressure region within\nthe housing from a low-pressure region and permits\n\n3\n\n4,260,166\n\n4\n\nor rotor 12. The radial face seal 10 is mounted on a shaft\n13. The rotor or seal seat member 12 secured to the\nshaft 13 for rotation therewith, as indicated by omega\n(o), a porous ring 14 inserted in the face of the seal\nhas\nseat 12 such that it is facing the primary seal ring or\nstator member 11. A narrow gap 15 exists between the\nopposing faces of the primary seal 11 and the seal seat\n12 which provides for a low tolerance continuity between the high-pressure and low-pressure fluid-retaining areas of the seal. It is important to maintain this gap\nas close as possible to its design value so as to avoid\nexcessive leakage of fluid or high friction loss.\nThe stator or primary seal ring member 11 is generally secured against rotation by a key or pin-like structure (not shown), the stator having an annular-shaped\nseal face 16 opposite the face of the porous ring 14.\nResilient means in the form of compression spring 17\ncompresses the annular-shaped seal face 16 of the primary seal ring 11 into sea!ing contact with the seal face\n18 of the seal seat 12 and the face of the porous ring 14\nso as to minimize the escape of pressurized fluid therebetween.\nIn FIG. 2, there is seen a self-stabilizing radial face\nseal generally of the nature described in FIG. 1. Provided in a position behind the circumferential porous\nring 14 is a circumferential cavity 20 being connected to\nthe seal high-pressure zone of the radial face seal by\npassageway 21. This cavity serves as a constant pressure\nreservoir with the porous ring 14 allowing for a selfcontrolled axial flow of fluid from the cavity into the\nseal gap 15. As stated above, this configuration provides\nboth for axial and angular stiffness of the seal.\nFIG. 3 represents a configuration of a conventional\nradial face seal ring having a primary seal ring 22 and a\nseal seat 23. The instability created within the system is\ninitiated by an angular misalignment about any radial\nline such as is represented by the line A-A. Such misalignment generates through hydrodynamic effects a\npressure distribution which produces forces, Fd. These\nforces produce a transverse moment about the line\nB-B producing a wobbling of the primary seal ring 22.\nAn angle 0 is a circumferential coordinate measured\nfrom the point of maximum clearance on the line B-B,\nin the direction of the rotational speed, omega (a).\n45\nFIG. 4 represents a graph of the circumferential presBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF T H E DRAWINGS\nsure distribution in a radial face seal.

In a radial face seal between high-pressure and\nprimary seal ring or stator 11 and an opposing seal seat\nlow-pressure regions of fluid along an axial member\ncontrolled communication of fluid within the system.\nThe primary seal ring is protected against rotation with\nthe shaft generally by means of a pin or key member.\nThe seal seat is generally provided so as to rotate freely\nwith the shaft within the housing member. The seal seat 5\nis provided with a porous, ring-like structure inserted in\nthe face of the seal seat such that it faces the engaging\nsurface of the primary seal or is situated opposite the\nface of said surface, separated therefrom by the narrow\ngap which may exist between the primary seal ring and 10\nthe seal seat. The presence of the porous ring allows for\na Circumferential flow of fluid within the porous material, thereby establishing the desired equilibrium necessary to stabilize the primary seal ring. In addition, in\norder to introduce both axial and angular stiffness to the 15\nresulting seal, a circumferential cavity may be introduced behind or in back of the porous ring which is\nconnected to the seal high-pressure regions, which can\nbe positioned either inside or outside the seal.\nIt has been determined in the course of the present 20\ninvention that upon the introduction of a porous ring\ninto the seal seat of the rotor member of a radial face\nseal at a position facing the face of the primary seal ring\nthat the primary seal ring may be stabilized both statically and dynamically. By attenuating the circumferen- 25\ntial pressure distribution in the primary seal, the transverse moment about the primary seal due to hydrodynamic effects is reduced, thereby substantially eliminating the resulting misalignment effects of the transfer\nmoment tending to be produced. The presence of the 3 0\nporous ring allows for a circumferential flow of the\nfluid present within the porous material. Hence, the\nfluid from the high-pressure regions may be readily\ntransferred into the low-pressure regions, thereby reducing the asymmetry of the circumferential pressure 35\ndistribution within the system. It has further been determined that by introducing, in addition to the porous\nring, a circumferential cavity in back of the porous ring,\nconnected via passages to the seal high-pressure fluid\nareas, that the instant cavity serves as a constant pres- 40\nsure reservoir with the porous ring, allowing a self-controlled axial flow from the cavity into the seal gap. This\narrangement provides both the axial and angular stiffness desired within the seal.\n\n4,260,166\n\n5\n\nhaving a primary seal ring for sealably engaging a seal\nseat wherein at least one of said primary seal ring and\nseal seat is affixed to said axial member so as to rotate\ntherewith and said primary seal ring has an annular\nfront face spaced from a mating face of said seal seat by\na narrow gap during rotation, the improvement comprising\na porous, ring-like circumferential structure mounted\nin said seal seat and having a face opposite the\nannular front face of said primary seal ring substantially coplanar with the mating face of said seal seat\nwhereby fluid is transferred through said porous\nstructure from said high-pressure region into said\nlow-pressure region during rotation thereby reducing the asymmetry of the circumferential pressure\ndistribution so that the seal is stabilized under both\nhydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions, and\nresilient biasing means for moving said primary seal\nring into contact with said seal seat when said axial\nmember is stationary whereby said annular front\nface simultaneously sealably engages said mating\nsurface of said seat and said coplanar face of said\n\n-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n6\n\nporous structure thereby inhibiting said fluid transfer therethrough.\n2.
