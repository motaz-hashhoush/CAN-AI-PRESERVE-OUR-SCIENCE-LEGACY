The experiment is being conducted under the auspices of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Vehicle Integrated\nPropulsion Research (VIPR) Program and will take place in early 2014 at Edwards AFB in California\nas an on-ground, on-wing test. The primary objectives are to determine the effect on the engine of\nseveral hours of exposure to low to moderate ash concentrations, currently proposed at 1 and 10\n3\nmg/m and to evaluate the capability of engine health management technologies for detecting these\neffects. A natural volcanic ash will be used that is representative of distal ash clouds many 100\xe2\x80\x99s to\n~1000 km from a volcanic source \xe2\x80\x94i.e., the ash should be composed of fresh glassy particles a few\ntens of microns in size. The glassy ash particles are expected to soften and become less viscous\nwhen exposed to the high temperatures of the combustion chamber, then stick to the nozzle guide\nvanes of the high-pressure turbine. Numerous observations and measurements of the engine\xe2\x80\x99s\nperformance and degradation will be made during the course of the experiment, including borescope\nand tear-down inspections. While not intended to be sufficient for rigorous certification of engine\nperformance when ash is ingested, the experiment should provide useful information to aircraft\nmanufacturers, airline operators, and military and civil regulators in their efforts to evaluate the range\nof risks that ash hazards pose to aviation.\n\nJohn Lekki (NASA), Eric Lyall (USAF), Marianne Guffanti (USGS), John Fisher (FAA),\nBeth Erlund & Rory Clarkson (Rolls Royce), Allan van de Wall (GE)\n\nQuick Overview:\n\xef\x82\x97 The experiment is being undertaken by a research team of U.S. Government\n\nagencies (NASA, US Air Force, FAA, USGS) and engine and aircraft equipment\nmanufacturers (Pratt & Whitney, GE, Rolls Royce, Boeing).\n\xef\x82\x97 Planned for spring of 2014 at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California using a\n\nNASA owned F117 engine. Will be a ground-based, on-wing test.\n\xef\x82\x97 Primary test objectives are:\n1.\nTo improve understanding of the effect on the engine of several hours of\nexposure to low to moderate concentrations of volcanic ash\n2.\nDetermine how well engine degradation from volcanic ash is detected with an\nexpanded engine health management system\n\xef\x82\x97 Desired outcome is to provide aircraft manufacturers, airline operators, and\n\nmilitary and civil regulators with improved information for evaluating the impact of\nash hazards pose on aviation.\n\nBackground:\n\xef\x82\x97 Ingestion tests were conducted in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s as outgrowth of nuclear bomb\n\nscenarios.\nTests documented severely damaging effects of high concentrations (100\xe2\x80\x99s of mg/m3)\nof \xe2\x80\x9cdust\xe2\x80\x9d (blends of materials, one component being volcanic ash).\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Now we need to know more about the effect of flying through much lower\n\nconcentrations, such as those that closed European airspace during the 2010\neruption of Eyjafjallaj\xc3\xb6kull Volcano\xe2\x80\x94i.e., a few mg/m3.\n\xef\x82\x97 The current test is being conducted under the auspices of an ongoing NASA\n\nprogram, Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR), which supports\ndevelopment of sensors and models to measure jet-engine performance and\ndiagnose problems during operation. So, VIPR is well-suited to address ashingestion testing.\n\xef\x82\x97 NASA aeronautical expertise is provided by engineers from Glenn Research\n\nCenter in Ohio and Dryden Flight Research Center in California.\n\nBackground:\n\xef\x82\x97 Major collaborator is the Air Force Research Lab at Wright-Patterson Air\n\nForce Base in Ohio. Providing funding and engineering staff.\n\xef\x82\x97 FAA also is providing funding. FAA views this as R&D and not sufficient\n\nbasis for regulations certifying engine performance in ash-contaminated\nairspace.\n\xef\x82\x97 USGS asked to participate to recommend a source of natural ash for the\n\ntest.\n\xef\x82\x97 P&W is providing expertise specific to its engine, GE is building rig to\n\ndisperse ash into engine, Rolls Royce is funding ash collection and\nprocessing.\n\xef\x82\x97 All groups participating in test design.\n\nBasics of a Turbofan Jet Engine:\nCombustion Chamber\nBypass Air\n\nExhaust\nTurbines (HP & LP)\nNozzle Guide Vanes\n\nIntake Fan\n\nHigh P Compressor\nLow P Compressor\n\n1) Air enters through intake fan; some it bypasses the engine core.\n2) Multiple compressors greatly increase pressure & temperature of air.\n3) Hot compressed air exits high-pressure compressor into combustion chamber where it is mixed\nwith fuel & burned.\n4) In turbine stages, thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy. \xe2\x80\x9cNozzle guide vanes\xe2\x80\x9d are\nairfoils that direct the very hot gas stream from combustion onto turbine rotor blades, causing\nthem to rotate & turn a shaft that turns compressors & fan. Voila\xe2\x80\x94the engine cycle continues!\n\nAsh in the Engine:\n\xef\x82\x97 Compressors: Drying of ash occurs. Ash\n\nparticles pulverized. Compressor erosion &\nabrasion possible.\n\xef\x82\x97 Combustion chamber at cruise in engine\n\nbeing tested not quite hot enough to melt\nall crystals (e.g., 1100-1500 :C for\nfeldspars). But it is hot enough to soften\nglass (\xce\x94 viscosity at ~800:C for rhyolite to\n~1000 :C for basalt).\n\xef\x82\x97 Exiting gas stream hits nozzle guide vanes.\n\nHPC Delivery: temperature exiting the high-pressure compressor.\nTGT/EGT = Turbine Gas Temperature (in the UK) / Exhaust Gas\nTemperature (in the US): temperature used to judge level of\ndeterioration in an engine.\n\nMODERN ENGINES RUN HOTTER THAN TEST ENGINE.\nEngine Temperature Data is from: NASA/TM-2003-212030\n\nSoftened glass sticks (cooled slightly but still\nsoftened?). Temperature drops through\nturbines hundred of degrees. Any\nremaining softened glass moving through\ncools & re-hardens (to get blown out\nengine?).\n\nAsh Concentrations:\n\xef\x82\x97 Two ash concentrations around the \xe2\x80\x9cvisible\xe2\x80\x9d threshold will be tested,\n\ncurrently proposed at 1 and 10 mg/m3.\n\xef\x82\x97 Depending on conditions, 1 mg/m3 ash cloud may or may not be visible to\n\nthe human eye. It also represents the approximate lower limit of what\nreliably can be injected into the engine in a controlled experiment.\n\xef\x82\x97 A 10 mg/m3 ash cloud most likely will be visible and the order of magnitude\n\ndifference in concentrations is expected to cause discernible differences in\nengine degradation effects.\n\xef\x82\x97 This test range also includes the \xe2\x80\x9csafety-case\xe2\x80\x9d threshold used on ash\n\nconcentration charts introduced in Europe in 2010 (2 mg/m3).\n\nAsh Testing Methodology:\n\xef\x82\x97 Ash injection \xe2\x80\x93 into engine core flow aft of fan\n\n(enables ingestion of know quantity of ash)\n\nAsh feed lines\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Rig to be tested in summer of 2013\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Preliminary test plan defined\n\xef\x82\x97 Extended exposure to low level concentrations\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\nat simulated cruise followed by steady state\nevaluation of engine behavior\nPost exposure borescope evaluation\nSteady state evaluation of engine behavior\nTeam decision required to test at higher\nconcentration levels\nFinal post exposure hardware evaluation\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Expected test results for public release*\n\xef\x82\x97 Normalized impact on engine behavior\n\xef\x82\x97 Hardware damage assessment\n* Proprietary data rights & export control/ITAR (International Traffic in\nArms Regulations \xe2\x80\x93 US Govt regulations controlling defense related\ntechnical data and items) issues are being worked out\n\nDamage from 1989 severe ash encounter in Alaska\n\nAsh Source:\n\xef\x82\x97 Ash introduced into engine needs to be representative of distal ash cloud that\n\nmight be encountered by an aircraft 100\xe2\x80\x99s of kilometers from volcano.\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Need to consider:\n\xef\x82\x97 Particle size: Particles in distal clouds are a few tens of microns.\n\xef\x82\x97 Composition: Mostly glass particles, which are more silicic than bulk\n\ncontent of magma (e.g., Redoubt andesite: bulk SiO2=59%, glass SiO2=77%;\nPinatubo dacite: bulk SiO2=64%, glass SiO2=70%).\n\xef\x82\x97 Freshness: Not a lot of secondary hydration (water that infiltrates glass\nmatrix or crystal structure) because of concern that melting temperature\nand viscosity may be affected (more on this later).\n\xef\x82\x97 Presence of volcanic gases: Planning team has decided to ignore this\nvariable and focus solely on particulates in cloud.\n\nAsh Properties--Viscosity:\n\xef\x82\x97 Viscosity of ash is strongly dependent on its SiO2 content (see graph). But behavior\nof less viscous compared to more viscous glass in engine is speculative. Is there a\n\xe2\x80\x9csticking\xe2\x80\x9d threshold of viscosity? 107 Pa-s has been suggested by Ulli Keuppers of\nLudwig Maximilian Univ. in Munich.\nViscosity vs temperature for 5 glass compositions,\ncalculated using model of Giordano et al. 2008\n\nFor a given temperature,\nviscosity of basaltic glass is\na few orders of magnitude\nlower than of rhyolitic\nglass.\n77% SiO2\n\nGraphic courtesy of\nLarry Mastin, USGS\n\n51% SiO2\n\nAsh Properties--Viscosity:\n\xef\x82\x97 Green line (~1100:C) is\n\napproximate temperature\nof ash entrained in gas\nstream from combustor as\nit hits nozzle guide vanes\n(in the older test engine).\n\nViscosity vs temperature for 5 glass compositions,\ncalculated using model of Giordano et al. 2008\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Broad range of glass\ncompositions will reach the\nsticking threshold at that\n\ntemperature\xe2\x80\x94i.e., material\nwith viscosity of 107 Pa sec\nor less will stick.\n\n77% SiO2\n\n51% SiO2\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Glass is sticking while hot &\nsoftened.\nGraphic courtesy of Larry Mastin, USGS\n\nAsh Properties\xe2\x80\x94Role of Calcium:\n\xef\x82\x97 Previous ingestion experiments by Dunn used 2 different volcanic materials:\n(1) blend of sand, clay, bentonite, & Mt. St. Helens ash (25% glass).\n(2) blend of sand, clay, bentonite, & basaltic scoria (80% glass).\n\nThese blends (and others with no volcanic ash) were created to simulate dust cloud\ncreated by nuclear blast, then used later used for volcanic project\n\xef\x82\x97 More deposition of material on turbine occurred with blend 2 than blend 1. Dunn\n\nattributed this to higher calcium content of blend 2, extrapolating the behavior of\ncalcite (CaCo3) in other no-ash blends.\n\xef\x82\x97 Basalt does have more calcium than silicic rocks like Mt. St. Helens dacite. But\n\ncalcium is not present in the form of calcite in volcanic rocks.\n\xef\x82\x97 More importantly, blend 2 was much glassier than blend 1 (34% cf. 8%).\n\nGlass content is the more likely reason for increased deposition.\n\nPractical Considerations:\n\xef\x82\x97 Amount of ash needed constrains possible sources\n\xef\x82\x97 Engineers estimate 0.1 to 1 metric tons (100-1000 kg). We must not run out\n\nof ash during experiment! Commercial quarry close to transportation, rather\nthan geologists with shovels in the middle of nowhere, is best bet.\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Processing of ash to smaller size:\n\xef\x82\x97 Note that engine compressors will pulverize ash particles into smaller sizes\nand different shapes (observation from previous tests by Dunn)\n\xef\x82\x97 If sieving is done, minimum size of standard geologic sieve is 63 microns.\n\xef\x82\x97 Or use \xe2\x80\x9cjet cyclone\xe2\x80\x9d milling process\xe2\x80\x94ash dropped into opposing air blasts;\nparticles bang against each other to self-pulverize.\n\xef\x82\x97 Regardless, don\xe2\x80\x99t need a precise size distribution. Looking for <100 microns\nwith mean size that does not exceed ~60 microns.\n\nCurrently Looking At:\n\xef\x82\x97 Mazama Ash\xe2\x80\x94pumiceous air-fall deposit from the huge eruption of Mt.\n\nMazama that created Crater Lake ~7700 years ago.\n\xef\x82\x97 Available in bulk quantities from commercial quarry in central Oregon.\n\xef\x82\x97 Deposit is homogeneous rhyodacite (70% SiO2) with ~10% of the material\n\nbeing mineral crystals and the rest highly vesicular rhyolitic glass (74% SiO2).\n\xef\x82\x97 Has 2-3% water incorporated into glass matrix post eruption (secondary\nhydration). May be enough to alter viscosity and melting temperature\naccording to expert colleagues at Ludwig Maximilian Univ. in Munich.\n\nAlso Looking At:\n\xef\x82\x97 Glass Mountain Tephra\xe2\x80\x94air-fall pumice from an eruption of Medicine Lake\n\nVolcano in NE California about 1000 years ago. Rhyolitic glass of 74% SiO2.\nAvailable from a quarry. Currently being analyzed for water content.\n\xef\x82\x97 Cordon Caulle Ash\xe2\x80\x94from 2011 eruption in Chile. Fresh, glassy, high-silica\n\nash. Distant collection and import issues could be complications.\n\xef\x82\x97 Not looking at:\n\xef\x82\x97 Mount St. Helens or Redoubt Volcano (thick ash deposits are not accessible).\n\xef\x82\x97 Volcanoes where we have to get a permit to collect (National Parks).\n\xef\x82\x97 Old cinder cones in US Southwest (not fresh, not representative of eruptions\n\nthat form large ash clouds)\n\nSuggested Analyses of Ash:\n\xef\x82\x97 Scanning electron microscope images of ash before and after processing.\n\xef\x82\x97 Relative proportions of glass and crystals, including proportions of each mineral\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\ntype (plagioclase, pyroxene, etc.)\nMajor elements reported as SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, etc. of bulk sample and\nglass fraction (XRF analysis).\nParticle size distribution after processing (laser diffraction).\nDensity of ash particles.\nSoftening temperature of glass (differential scanning calorimetry).\nMelting temperature of crystals (differential scanning calorimetry).\nWater content of bulk sample (thermogravimetry).\n\nConclusion:\n\xef\x82\x97 This is the first engine test designed specifically for ingestion of\n\nvolcanic ash.\n\xef\x82\x97 Based on a solid public-private partnership.\n\xef\x82\x97 While not intended to lead to rigorous regulations for certifying\n\nengine performance in ash-contaminated airspace, the experiment is\na key part of a multi-pronged effort to understand ash mitigation\nstrategies and possible health management approaches to detect ash\ndegradation.\n\xef\x82\x97 And the basis for additional experiments?\n\xef\x82\x97 Suggestions on ash source or test design welcomed!\n\n'
