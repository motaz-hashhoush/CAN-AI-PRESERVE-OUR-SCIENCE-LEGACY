b'SNOWMELT RUNOFF MODEL IN JAPAN\nKenji Ishihara and Yoshiaki Nishimura\nEnvironmental Research & Technology Institute\nKaname Takeda\nNational Institute of Resources\nScience and Technology Agency\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPreliminary results [1] of Japanese snowmelt runoff modelling were proposed at First Japan/US\nSnow and Evapotranspiration Workshop held in Tokyo on March, 1982. Aim!ng at the daily\nsnowmelt runoff forecasting, the preliminary model was designed through multiple regression\nanalyses based on the hydrological conception. However, it involved several operational defects as\nfollows:\ni) containing three input variables of mean air temperature, precipitation and snow cover area at the\nday of which the inflow ought to be forecast.\nii) insufficient concordance between the hydrological conception and the parameters which resulted\nfrom the multiple regression analyses.\nIn the present study the model was, then, so modified that all the input variables are of the\nantecedent days. The inflow of the previous day is also taken into account. The new model was\ndeveloped in use of the 1980 data in the Okutadami River Basin, chosen again as the test basin, and\nwas adapted to the other years for its operative efficiency.\nThe optimum contribution of the Satellite imagery to the snowmelt runoff forecasting is the\nextraction of the snow coverage. Japan is, unfortunately, covered with much cloud in snowmelt\nseason. Only in a fortunate season, one can obtain only one or two useful imagery. Unlike US it is,\ntherefore, impossible in Japan to draw the depletion curve of snow coverage based on the imageries.\nHowever, a few imageries obtained in the past were effectively utilized for the verification and\nmodification of the depletion curve induced from the snow water equivalent distribution at maximum\nstage and the accumulated degree-days at one representative point selected in the basin. This point is\nequipped with data collection facilities and is expected to fully function as DCP.\nTogether with the depletion curve, the relationship between the basin-wide daily snowmelt\namount and the air temperature at the point above were exhibited in form of nomograph for the convenience of the model user.\nThe Japanese model proposed inthe present study is, thus, the practical model of the snow melt\nrunoff forecasting.\nTEST BASIN\nThe Okutadami River basin (area 414 km 2) chosen as the test basin for this analysis is situated\nin Central Japan shown in Figure 1.. The highest and lowest altitudes of the basin are 2346 m and\n782 m respectively. The altitude difference is, therefore, 1564 m. This basin is one of the heaviest\n\n29\n\nsnowfall area in Japan; the maximum snow depth recorded in recent 20 years was 598cm at\nOkutadami Meteorological Observing Station located at the dam site in the basin. The station runs\nthe measurement of snow water equivalent and inflow into the reservoir as well as the general\nmeteorological observation. Located slightly outside the basin is the Hinoemata meteorological\nobserving station of air temperature and precipitation. Two stations above and the representative\npoint (mentioned later), Maruyama, provide all the necessary input data of the model. Those locations are shown in Figure 2.\nThe snow depth measurements by helicopter at ten to twenty points scattered in the basin are\ncarried out at the maximum stage of snow depth at about the end of every winter season by the\nElectric Power Development Company. The measurement points by helicopter are shown in\nFigure 3.\nCONCEPT OF SNOWMELT RUNOFF MODEL\nTwo forms of multiple regression models were considered. First model is as follows;\nRn\n\n(1)\n\n= c + alXn_ 1 + a2Xn_2 + a3Xn_3\n+ blYn_ l + b2Yn_2 + b3Yn_3\n\nXn_ i =\n\n(Mn_ i "1- Pn_i)S\'n_ i\n\n(2)\n\nYn-i\n\nPn-i s "n-i\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\nwhere\nR_\n\n: daily direct inflow (m3/sec) into reservoir on the day, n\n\nc\n\n: constant\n\nal,a2,a3,bl,b2,b3 : partial regression coefficient\nmean snowmelt amount on the day n-i (m3*sec-lokm\n\nMn_ i\n\n:\n\n-2)\n\nP,-i\n\n: mean rainfall amount on the day n-i (m3osec-l.km -2)\n\nS\'_ i\n\n: area where daily mean air temperature is above 0\xc2\xb0C within snow cover area\non the day n-i (km2)\n\nS"_ i\n\n: area where daily mean air temperatureis above 0\xc2\xb0C withinnon-snowcover\narea on the day n-i (km2)\n\nThe secondmodel, in whichthe directinflowof the previousday, Rn_ is addedto the\n1,\nvariablesof the first model,is as follows;\nRn\n\n= c + dRn_ 1 + alXn_ 1 + a2Xn_2 + a3Xn- 3\n+ blYn_ 1 + b2Yn_ 2 -t-"b3Yn_ 3\n\n30\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\nd : partial regression coefficient\n\nDEPENDENT VARIABLE\nDirect Inflow\nThe dependent variable of the model is the daily direct inflow, R_, into the reservoir. The base\nflow which should be subtracted from the daily inflow to obtain the direct inflow, R,, is expressed\nby\nrt = ro (1.0+0.001240\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nrt : base flow after t days from the day when first discharge occurs due to snowmelting in the\nseason\n(ma/sec)\nr0 : inflow before the snowmelt season starts\n\n(m3/sec)\n\nThe equation (5) was empirically determined by the inflow data recorded at the beginning and end of\nthe several snowmelt seasons\nINDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nSnow Cover Area and Its Related Areas,\n\nSn_l,\n\nS\'n_ I\n\nand\n\nS"n_ I\n\nThe snow coverage information from Landsat MSS is scarcely obtainable in Japan. Then, the\nsnow line during snowmelt season was considered to appear when snow water equivalent in a mesh\n(shown in Figure 2) became equal to the snowmelt amount which can be calculated by the degreeday method (mentioned later). In order to extract the snow line, the computation of the snow water\nequivalent in each mesh at the maximum stage is required. Then, the computation was made by\nfollowing three methods; the tbp\'o_raphic method [3] in use of the extensive snow survey data in\n1980, the degree-day method [4] in effective use of two Landsat MSS data fortunately obtained in\n1979 and the comparison method [5] in use of the regional snow depth data obtained for several\nyears with helicopter. Next, the date when all the snow deposits disappear was calculated for each\nmesh, applying the degree-day method. The snow cover area and its related areas, Sn_i,s\',_i and\ns",_i were then counted for every day during each snowmelt season.\nTotal Snowmelt Amount, Mn.i.S\'n_I\nThe degree-day method was adopted for the snowmelt calculation, expressed by\nM = K_T\n\n31\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nM : snowmelt amount (g/cm2)\nleT : accumulated daily mean air temperature above 0\xc2\xb0C (\xc2\xb0C.day)\nk\n\n: degree-day factor (0.45; average value in preceding studies)\n\nThe daily mean air temperature at the Okutadami Meteorological Observing Station was adopted\nas the standard for the estimation of the air temperature at all meshes assuming the lapse-rate as -0.6\n\xc2\xb0C/100 m.\nApplying the equation (6), the calculation of the daily snowmelt amount was made for each\nmesh within the area, S\'n_i, during each snowmelt season. By summing up them, the total snowmelt\namount in whole basin, Mn_i\'S\'n_i was then obtained.\nTotal Rainfall Amount, Pn_i\xc2\xb0S\'n_i and Pn_i\xc2\xb0S"n_i\nThe Okutadami Station is the only one rainfall observation station within the basin running\nthroughout snowmelt season. However, located at the lowest elevation and the northern edge of the\nbasin, it does not give the mean rainfall of the basin. Then, the Hinoemata Station was adopted for\nthis purpose, although it is located at slightly outside the basin. After careful meteorological inspection, it was assumed that the precipitation at Hinoemata is equal to the rainfall amount in each mesh\nwhere the daily mean air temperature is above 0 \xc2\xb0C both in snow cover and non-snow cover area.\nThe total rainfall amount, Pn_i"S\'n_i and Pn_i\xc2\xb0S"n_i were then obtained.\nCONSTRUCTION OF SNOWMELT RUNOFF MODEL\nNow, all the input data were prepared for the determination of the constant and partial regression coefficients of the equations (4) and (5). The multiple regression analyses were, then, carried\nout in use of data in 1980. The resultant constructed two models are presented in Table 1.\nThe comparison between the observed and calculated inflow, exhibited in Figures 4 and 5,\nshows that the models would stand the practical use the snowmelt runoff forecasting.\nNOMOGRAPHS FOR PRACTICAL USE OF MODELS\nIn course of the model construction, the input variable values were obtained through the complex calculation procedure relating to the mesh. Necessary for the convenience of the practical use of\nthe models is an easy acquisition of the input variable data. Following nomographs were, then,\ndevised.\nNomograph (I) for Basin-Wide Snow Amount at Maximum Stage\nThe Maruyama shown in Figure 2 was selected among several tens proposed sites in the basin\nas the best representative site, whose snow water equivalent has a linear correlation with the basinwide snow amount throughout both snowfall and snowmelt seasons. Based on the six years data is\n\n32\n\nFigure 6 (nomograph (I)), which exhibits a relationship between the basin-wide snow amount and\nMaruyama\'s snow water equivalent at the maximum stage.\nThe Maruyama is situated at roughly mean altitude of the whole basin and is at present equipped\nwith DCP.\nNomograph (11)for Snow Cover Area\nThe depletion curve of snow cover area with increasing degree-day at the Maruyama was\nobtained for four snowmelt seasons, and is exhibited in Figure 7. The curves seem to depend on the\nsnow amount at the maximum stage. Then, the relation was investigated between the snow amount\nabove and the Maruyama\'s degree-day accumulated up to the first day when the bare ground appears\nsomewhere in the basin, namely, Sn_i/A< 1. A is the basin area. A linear correlation was found as\nshown in Figure 8. Based on this correlation, the depletion curve was standardized. The resultant\ncurve shown in Figure 9 is the nomograph (II).\nNomograph (111) Basin-Wide Snowmelt Amount\nfor\nA clear relation was found between the basin-wide daily snowmelt amount and the daily mean\nair temperature at the Maruyama through the medium of the ratio (Sn_i/A). This relation shown in\nFigure 10 is the nomograph (III) for Mn_i-S\'n_\ni.\nNomograph (IV, V) for Basin-Wide Rainfall\nIn the models, two kinds of basin-wide rainfall amount are taken into account; one in the snow\ncover area (Sn_i) and another in the non-snow cover area (A-Sn_i).\nRegarding the snow cover area, the extraction of the area (S\'n_in-i) where the daily mean air\ntemperature is above 0 \xc2\xb0C is necessary. For simplicity, the relation was obtained between the total\nrainfall amount (Pn_i,S \'n-i) and the Hinoemata precipitation (Pn-i) through the medium of the product of the Okutadami daily mean air temperature and the ratio (Sn_i/A). The relation shown in\nFigure 11 is the nomograph (IV) for Pn_i\'S\'n_i.\nAs for the non-snow cover area, this area is usually above 0 \xc2\xb0C during a snowmelt season, so\nthat S"n_in-i - A - S__i. Exhibited in Figure 12 is the nomograph (V) for Pn_i\xc2\xb0S"n_i .\nVERIFICATION OF SNOWMELT RUNOFF MODELS\nIn order t6 verify the models (Table 1 constructed for the 1980 data, the models were applied to\nthe other two years, 1979 and 1982. All the input values were obtained in use of the nomographs\n(I)-(V). The results are shown in Figures 13-16. A good agreement can be seen except May 26-28,\n1979. A large difference in this period may be caused by heavy rainfall unusually in a snowmelt\nseason which occurred on May 26 and 27. In Japan the rainy season starts at the beginning of June,\nand often heavy rainfall occurs. The fact above shows that the models should not be applied in case\nthe heavy rainfall happened near the end of snowmelt season when the snow cover area shrinks up\nto the top of the high mountains.\n\n33\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the present study scarce Landsat MSS data obliged the limited but efficient utilization for the\nverification of the depletion curve of the snow cover area. In order to construct the models, the\ncomplex topographic mesh analyses were carried out. However, the data of final necessity become\nonly the mean air temperature and precipitation for the daily use of the models.\nThe runoff forecasting procedure is summarized in Figure 17.\nREFERENCES\n1.
