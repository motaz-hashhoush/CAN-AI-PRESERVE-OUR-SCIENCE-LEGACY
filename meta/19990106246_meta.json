Among the suite of useful measurements, global auroral images have proven to be useful in guiding global models. Global auroral images provide an irreplaceable contextual measure that is required for understanding the momentum and mass transfer between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and required for understanding their dynamic response to the solar wind. Global auroral images can provide much more than contextual information. Quantitative data, such as hemispheric power input distribution on a global scale provides needed information with regards to the dynamic nature of the magnetosphere. However, truly global images (both hemispheres simultaneously) with appropriate temporal, spectral and spatial resolution are needed in order to fully comprehend the dynamic nature of the magnetosphere. Differences in response of the two hemispheres as a function of time, space, and energy, provide needed boundary conditions for models as well as a gateway to understand the mechanism relevant to the provide a quantitative measure of the magnetosphere, A mission concept based on the need to provide a quantitative measure of the global distribution of the power input and average energy including in-situ particle measurement will be described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990106246, "name": "6th New Millennium Magnetosphere: Integrating Imaging, Discrete Observations, and Global Simulations", "location": "Guntersville, AL", "id": "e8715946bf2c4c128fc5985d06a62021", "startDate": "1998-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990106246, "id": "8d46bc4f82f84ad78e7edf159be1096f", "publicationDate": "1998-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
