Necessary to include easily identifiable and more-readily quantifiable characteristics like costs, times, and numbers of errors. Mathematical model incorporating these and other factors of dynamics of software-development process implemented in the Software Life Cycle Simulator (SLICS) computer program. Simulates dynamics of software-development process. In combination with input and output expert software systems and knowledge-based management software system, develops information for use in managing large software-development project. Intended to aid managers in planning, managing, and controlling software-development processes by reducing uncertainties in budgets, required personnel, and schedules.", "title": "Software Model Of Software-Development Process", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T12:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900000138, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lin, Chi Y."}, "organization": {"name": "Caltech"}}, "id": "71a5d4bbff5243319309a65026683d95"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900000138, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Synott, Debra J."}, "organization": {"name": "Caltech"}}, "id": "e317805705ef403aa791d3c3124a79f5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900000138, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Levary, Reuven R."}, "organization": {"name": "Saint Louis Univ."}}, "id": "5da8c6ea02e041f2a25b44c55c0c5c16"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Tech Brief", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900000138, "publications": [{"volume": "14", "submissionId": 19900000138, "issue": "3", "issn": "0145-319X", "id": "55cb5908f5d2475896cab789866e3940", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs", "publicationDate": "1990-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
