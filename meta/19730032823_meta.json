It is concluded that while maritime service satellites appear to be viable technically and economically, there is a substantial amount of analysis, definition, and development work yet to be accomplished.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19730032823, "endDate": "1973-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "76acb229e7d64386ac9f823df6655853", "id": "9afada0f67ca43ef8261543d4656cfe8"}], "name": "Annual Meeting and Technical Display", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "76acb229e7d64386ac9f823df6655853", "startDate": "1973-01-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730032823, "id": "be3524a821ff4f8ab9712bb1524224c0", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
