b"Police\n\nCommunications\n\nShown in the accompanying\nphotos is the\ncommunications\ncenter of the Oklahoma\nCity Police\nDepartment\n(OCPD), whose display consoles bear some\nresemblance\nto those in the mission control facility at\nJohnson Space Center (JSC). The resemblance\nis more\nthan coincidental.\nOCPD incorporated\nNASA\ntechnology\nin its computer-aided\ncommunications\nsystem and benefited from assistance\nprovided by JSC.\nJSC's Mission Control is a vital element in space\noperations\nand its efficient operation is as important\nto\nmission success as the spacecraft\nin orbit. Developed\nin\n1960, Mission Control was provided entirely new,\nspecially-designed\ncommunications,\ncomputing and\n\n110\n\ndisplay systems which have been technologically\nupdated over the years. In designing the facility, NASA\npaid particular\nattention to the human factors involved in\nground management\nof long-duration\nspace flights, for\nexample, selection and training of control center\npersonnel;\nmost effective informational\ndisplays; and\nspecial lighting to reduce controller fatigue and eyestrain.\nFor the benefit of potential users of this technology,\nNASA has conducted\na number of seminars and\nworkshops\non control equipment\nand techniques.\nWhen the Oklahoma\nCity Police Department\ndecided\nto develop a computerized\ncommunications\nsystem,\nOCPD sought assistance\nfrom Johnson Space Center.\nJSC officials reviewed the Oklahoma\nCity plan, furnished\ninformation\non lighting and other fatigue-reducing\nmeasures,\nand provided specifications\nfor equipment\nand\ndesign layouts.\nJ SC was particularly\nhelpful in advising\nhow to avoid communications\nbottlenecks\nassociated\nwith simultaneous\nhandling of telephone,\nradio and\ninter-office\ntransmissions.\nUse of already-developed\nNASA technology\nalso saved Oklahoma\nCity money in\nreduced design and engineering\ncosts.\nThe photos show some of the main features of OCPD's\nhighly efficient communications\nsystem. At upper left,\nthe police officer in foreground,\nseated at a computer\ndisplay console, is the dispatch coordinator;\nin the\nbackground\nare three other dispatchers\nat identical\nconsoles.\nThe officer (opposite)is\nthe telecommunications\ncoordinator,\nwho handles internal calls from OCPD\noffices. Public calls for assistance\nare received by\ntelephone clerks (above). Radio messages_incoming\ncalls and dispatch\ntransmissions_are\nhandled separately\nby a radio communications\ncoordinator\n(fight).\n\n111\n\n"
