b'A RUBIDIUM CLOCK FOR SEEK-TALK\nWilliam J. Riley\nEG&G, Inc. Frequency and Time Department\nSal em, Massachusetts\n\nABSTRACT\nThe work at EGtG, Inc., on a miniature rubidium frequency standard\nfor the SEEK-TALK program has now reached the prototype stage.\nThis paper describes the design objectives and approach, the more\nimportant design features, and the results obtained thus far.\nINTRODUCTION\nEG&G, Inc., with support from the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Division,\nhas developed a tactical rubidium frequency standard (TRFS) for the SEEK-TALK\nprogram. This effort, which is now entering the prototype stage, is directed\ntoward the establishment of a production capability for miniature rubidium\nclocks of medium stability capable of fast warmup and extreme ruggedness for\nmilitary avionics applications. The overall unit will consist of an ultraminiature physics package and four plug-in circuit boards inside a 24-inch\nsquare by $-inch box. This size is achieved without the extensive use of hybrid\nmicrocircuitry, yet is believed to be the smallest atomic frequency standard\nyet developed. A mockup of the unit is shown in Figure 1.\nThe physics package is about the size and shape of a "D" flashlight battery.\nIt combines the best features of the integrated and discrete filter cell\napproaches by using separate filter and absorption cells, both of which are\ninside the microwave cavity. Small size is achieved by dielectric loading of\nthe cavity and by a unique electric field mode of lamp excitation. Performance\nis enhanced by excellent line homogeneity made possible by an optical design\ngiving uniform light distribution, separate hyperfine filtration, and a uniform\nC-field. Low net temperature coefficient is achieved by cancellation of the\nindividual filter and absorption cell coefficients. The discrete filter cell\nalso allows zero light shift to be conveniently obtained by adjusting cavity\ntemperature. The overall physics package assembly includes a low-noise photodetector and microwave multiplier, as well as lamp exciter and VCXO circuits and\na second magnetic shield.\nThe TRFS electronic block diagram has a single frequency lock loop that contains\na wide bandwidth A/B PLL synthesizer as a subloop. A particularly simple rf,\nchain is used that has no mixing and a few tuned circuits. The servo amplifier\nis a low-complexity cascade detector configuration and the power supply and\ntemperature controller sections use efficient high frequency switching techniques.\n\n141\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPhotograph o f TRFS Mockup Unit.\n\n142\n\nSPECIFI\n\nS\n\nFS are shown i n able 1and are based on the genera^\nec i f i c a t ions\nr e q u i r ~ e n t so f the SEEK-TALK program.\nTable 1\n.\n\nTRFS condensed specifications.\n\nOutput Frequency, MHz\nOutput Level, v rms i n t o 50 ohms\nHarmonics, dBc\nSpurious components, dBc\nPhase N o i s e t ( f 1, dBc/Hz\nf =1Hz\nf = 100 Hz\nf\n1 kHz\nDC Power, watts\nSteady State a t 25\xc2\xb0C\nWannup\nDC Input Voltage, v o l t s\nWarmup, minutes\nfrom 25OC\nfrom -55OC\nDrift\nper month\nper year\nShort Term Frequency S t a b i l i t y\n1 sec\n10 sec\n100 sec\nTrim Range\nVoltage Coefficient\nTemperature Coefficient, -54 t o +7loC\nRetrace\nStorage Temperature, "C\nMagnetic Susceptibility, (worst axis)\nA l t i t u d e fo S t o 50,000 feet\nrm L\nHumidity, %\nShock\nAcceleration\nSinusoidal Vibration\nRandom Vibration\nR e l i a b i l i t y , airborne inhabited, hours\nSize, inches\nWeight, pounds\n\n-\n\n143\n\n10\n0.5\n\n-30\n-80\n-80\n-120\n-135\n\n<13\n\n<70\n22-32\n1.5\n4\n(5 x 10-11\n<5 x 10-10\n<4 x 10-11\n<1x 10-11\n<4 x 10-12\n23 x 10-9\n<1x l O - ~ ~ / l O %\n<3 x 10-10\n53 x 10-11\n-62 t o +S0C\n<2 x 10-11/Gauss\n<1x 10-13/mbar\n100\n\n30 9 peak\n<4 x 10-11/11) g\n4 9 Peak\n0.04 #/Hz\n220,000\n24 x 24 x 4\n<2.0\n\nLOCK DIAGR\nA block diagram o f t h e TRFS i s s\nhigh performance, s i m p l i c i t y , and manufacturabil ity,\n\na\nm\nThe major sections are:\n\na.

EG&G began t h i s\np r o j e c t w i t h the i n t e r n a l l y sponsored development o f a rubidium physics package\nt h a t combines good performance w i t h u l t r a - m i n i a t u r e size.

The basic physics package s t r u c t u r e i s\nshown i n Figure 3.\nExtreme m i n i a t u r i z a t i o n o f the lamp assembly was accomplished by e l i m i n a t i n g\nt h e usual rf c o i l surrounding t h e rubidium lamp. An e l e c t r i c f i e l d s t r u c t u r e\nwas developed f o r s t a r t i n g and maintaining t h e lamp plasma. Fabry-Perot studies\nconfirmed the proper spectral output f r o m t h i s structure, which i s approximately\nh a l f the o v e r a l l diameter o f an equivalent c o i l arrangement since no spacing\ni s required between t h e lamp and oven wall. The lamp i s e x c i t e d by a conventional\nC o l p i t t s rf power o s c i l l a t o r which w i l l be located i n s i d e t h e physics package.\nM i n i a t u r i z a t i o n o f t h e microwave c a v i t y was obtained, paradoxically, by p u t t i n g\nmore i n t o it. It was decided t o use a d i s c r e t e f i l t e r c e l l f o r best performance.\nThis allows independent n u l l i n g o f the l i g h t s h i f t and gives good s p a t i a l\nhomogeneity i n t h e absorption c e l l t h a t r e s u l t s i n a low rf power c o e f f i c i e n t .\nIt was f u r t h e r decided t o l o c a t e t h e f i l t e r c e l l i n s i d e t h e c a v i t y t o avoid the\nvolume of an a d d i t i o n a l oven.\nThe conmon thermal environment also allows\ncancel l a t i o n of t h e f i1t e r c e l l temperature c o e f f i c i e n t by t h a t o f t h e absorption\nc e l l , since the l a t t e r i s adjustable by i t s b i n a r y b u f f e r gas mix r a t i o .

The first, located\nin front of the absorption cell, collimates the la\nlight intensity distribution. The second lens, lo\ncell, focuses the light on the ~1 cm2 photodetector to give g\nefficiency\n\n.\n\nTwo C-field coils are used to provide 21% C-field uniformity, which helps to\nensure good line homogeneity and minimizes rf power sensitivity.\nA nonmetallic conical spacer rigidly connects the lamp and cavity ovens for\n\nruggedness and low vibration sensitivity with low heat transfer between the\novens.\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nPHOTODETECTOR\n\ncoli\nTUBE\n\n1\n\nABSORPTION\nCELL\n\nFigure 3\n.\n\nI\nFILTER\nCELL\n\n\\\nMAGNETIC\n\n\\ OVEN\nSPACER\n\nSHIELD\n\nLayout o f Miniaturized Physics Package.\n146\n\norated i n t o the t e\ne f f i c i e n t since i t\n\ne SRD microwave m u l t\ncavity, I t s design i s bo\nX38 m u l t i p l i e r ,\n\nTable 2 l i s t s some o f the physics package parameters and Figure 4 shows t h e\nmajor parts.

T h i s has the advantage o f requiring\nless hardware. The op amp associated w i t h the second harmonic detector also\nprovides gain f o r the fundamental signal. The large amplitude second harmonic\nsignal is shifted t o the f o u r t h harmonic ahead of the fundamental detector,\nmaking i t possible t o obtain sufficient dynamic range without a bulky notch\nf i 1ter\n\n.\n\n149\n\nCXO SECT10\n\nThe VCXO section consists o f 20 MHz c r y s t a l o s c i l l\n10 MHz and ~ 1 4 0\nkHz, and a t ed a m p l i f i e r t o prod\nThe voltage c o n t r o l l e d c r y s t a l o s c i l l a t o r uses a 20 MHz t h i r d overtone SC-cut\nc r y s t a l i n an HC35/U s t y l e holder operated a t =80\xc2\xb0C i n t h e c a v i t y oven.

This frequency i s produced by a phase-locked\nloop (PLL) t h a t operates as a X1286 m u l t i p l i e r from the\' 2140 kHz reference from\nthe VCXO section. The PLL also serves as t h e means t o apply phase modulation.\nThis approach i s h a r d w a r e e f f i c i e n t and avoids bulkyand c r i t i c a l tuned c i r c u i t s .\nThe rf c i r c u i t r y consists o f a ~ 3 MHz VCXO, a diode doubler, and an rf power\n0\na m p l i f i e r . The PLL consists o f an ECL divider, a TTL phase detector, and a\nloop a m p l i f i e r / f i l t e r .

These c o n t r o l l e r s provide\nboth warmup and running power and are simple, e f f i c i e n t , operate over a wide\ndynamic range, and maintain constant thermal gain as the oven power changes.\nEach c o n t r o l l e r consists o f o n l y one a c t i v e device and a few.discrete components.\nAll TRFS e l e c t r o n i c c i r c u i t s are powered from +5V and +15V supplies which also\nuse switching regulators.
