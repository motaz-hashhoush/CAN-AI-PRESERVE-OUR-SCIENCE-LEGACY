Understanding the production of upper tropospheric cirrus clouds is essential for the successful modeling of the Earth's climate. The mission was staged in July 2002 with flights of 6 aircraft from Key West, Florida. Several aircraft were used for in situ and remote sensing of aerosols, ice crystals, meteorological fields, radiative fluxes, and gas concentrations. The NASA ER-2 and WB-57, the Proteus aircraft, owned by Northrop Grumman and operated by Scaled Composites, CIRPAS provided the DeHavilland UV-l8A, \"Twin Otter\" aircraft, the University of North Dakota provided a Cessna Citation II aircraft , and NSF supported the ELDORA radar onboard the Naval Research Laboratory P-3 aircraft. In this presentation, I will describe some of the flights, the conditions, and some of the results from the mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Switzerland", "submissionId": 20050177045, "endDate": "2005-03-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "SCOUT-03 Meeting", "location": "Zurich", "id": "f283eb3ad504436b8b911f339ce86cde", "startDate": "2005-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050177045, "id": "4d8ad72c179845af83d265e00f8abb62", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
