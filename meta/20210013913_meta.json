Due to prohibitively high cost, long lead times, and limited reset capability, testing of mechanisms that require HDRMs is often difficult.  This project explored the possibility of designing HDRM-analogue devices that would replicate the function of flight HDRMs during ground-based testing for a fraction of the cost of a flight HDRM.  These devices were designed with the requirements of the Spin Eject Mechanism to be used on the Mars Sample Return (MSR) Capture, Containment, and Return System (CCRS) in mind.  A trade study was conducted to determine the optimal internal mechanism design of the device, comparing several mechanisms from existing HDRMs to several simpler, more novel mechanisms.  CAD software was used to create a preliminary design of the device utilizing a mix of commercial off-the-shelf parts and custom-manufactured parts.  Several straightforward analyses were conducted to determine the most effective models for the off-the-shelf parts.  A prototype largely composed of 3D-printed components was also created to proof the design concept.  Although this HDRM simulator was designed for a particular mechanism for the CCRS mission, its general design is useful for ground testing of a variety of mechanisms requiring similar HDRM simulators.", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210013913, "endDate": "2021-05-10T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "a100eca148044424a9bf9b623a45d9ec", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA NIFS Interns", "location": ""}}, "meetingId": "7d62c7db3c4b4ab6bc0668915f3cee38", "id": "2458dc49bff848bf96cf0e856307da82"}], "name": "OSTEM Intern Symposium", "location": "Virtual", "id": "7d62c7db3c4b4ab6bc0668915f3cee38", "startDate": "2021-04-21T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation", "name": "Final Presentation.pptx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210013913/downloads/Final%20Presentation.pptx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210013913/downloads/Final%20Presentation.pptx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210013913/downloads/Final%20Presentation.pptx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
