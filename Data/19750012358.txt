When it impacts the water, it experiences loads that are highly\ndependent upon the conditions of water impact (velocity and angle). These conditions a r e a function of the meteorological conditions in the impact zone.\nExtremely high winds and seas have a certain probability of occurrence and\ndesigning for these worst-case loads potentially causes severe cost and weight\npenalties on the structure. Since the vehicle is not manned at time of impact,\nfailures are purely economic. Designing for the worst-case load causes high\nprogram cost due to the resulting conservative design. Designing for a very\nfrequent load results in a high program cost because of the large number of\nreplacements required with the high attrition rate. Theoretically, the lowest\nprogram cost results from a lower per unit cost structure than the one designed\nfor worst case and a lower attrition rate than that resulting from designing for\nno water impact loads.\nMartin Marietta, under contract NAS8-29622, studied this problem and\ndeveloped a computer program which investigated the attrition rate and costs\nassociated with a specific design. The design variables were limited to the\nparachute descent velocity and whether the nozzle extension was jettisoned. A t\nthat time, the major attrition producing water impact load was slapdown.\nMartin\'s computer program was installed on the MSFC computer and\nmodified to update the loads and allow for analysis of various designs. It has\nbeen used to compute attrition rates of seven SRB configurations which a r e\ndescribed herein.\n\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTIQN\nThe Martin program is described in Volume I1 of the report Space\nShuttle Solid Rocket Booster Recovery Systems Definition. It is a Monte Carlo\nanalysis which treats the meteorologica\' : w t o r s (wind, sea, etc. ) and the\n\nstrength of each element probabilistically. Each critical load condition i s programmed as a table of loads input as a function of vertical velocity ( V ),\nV\nhorizontal velocity ( V ) , and water impact angle ( e ) . For each Monte Carlo\nH\ntrial, a water impact condition ( V\n0 ) is randomly selected and the set\nV "H\'\n\'\nof loads i s computed by interpolation from the tables. A set of strengths is\nrandomly selected and compared to the loads. If a load exceeds its companion\nstrength, a failure is tabulated. The percentage of failures is the attrition rate\nfor that particular structure. Motor sinkage is indicated when the slapdown\nload exceeds the strength by a factor of 1.1 (the ratio of ultimate to yield\nstrength for DGAC).\nU s i - g the Martin analysis technique, a new computer program, SPLASH,\n\nwas written which presents the load probabilistically. It presents the entire\ncurve instead of the sum of the failures (the value of the probability) at a\ncertain strength level. These results can provide general information about a\nload and they can also be used as a design tool to evaluate a number of designs\nwithout additional computer runs. SPLASH can present design limit loads\n(predicted actual load with no factor of safety) o r it can divide the load by a\nstrength ratio probability distribution. The resulting curves are used directly\nwith the predicted ultimate strength (no factor of safety) to determine the\nfailure rate. The decision of whether to use the probability of strengtli is\nbased on judgement, the failure mode, the l.+t~ 9f testing used, and the degree\nof conservatism desired.\nThe meteorological portion of the program has teen updated to include\nthe latest results of analyses\', *3. Effects of high altitude wind gusts, low\naltitude wind gusts, wind shear, parachute release dynamics, and wave slope\nare all included. The conditioml probability is computed for each contributor\nto the water impact condition so that high gusts will not result with low wind,\netc. The wa\\e slope computed is filtered to remove the effects of all waves\nwith wave lengths smaller than an effective length uuique for each type of loading. The filtering wave lengths used are vehicle length for slapdown, skirt\ndiameter for cavity collapse, and nozzle diameter for nozzle and aft closure\nloads.\n\n*\n\n1.

To include this\neffect, an aziniuth angle was selected rzndomly and the in-plane actuator load\nwas multiplied by the sine of that angle.\nThe strength probability4 is dependent upon the type of testing. The\noptions for which data a r e available a r e no test, standard test, proof test, and\nmodel test. The results enclosed a r e for the standard test where a full size\nprototype o r structural model is tested to the design limit load and corrections\nto the analytical model and the design are made as a result of any failures.\n\nRESULTS\nThe strength probability distribution for s-mdard tes i s shown in Figure\n1, and the water impact conditions are shown in Figures 2 and 3 Note that 99\n.\npercent probability values of water impact are that the angle will be less than\n12 deg and the horizontal velocity will be less than 19 m/sec ( 63 ft/sec)\n\n.\n\nPresented in Figures 4 through 1 8 are probability distributions for the\nsignificant water impact loads. In each case the appropriate wave slope filtering has been included and the curves with and without probability of strength a r e\nshown, Cases with and without the nozzle extension a r e plotted separately. T o\nproperly use the load curves, enter the curve with a design capability on the left\nand read the attrition rate on the top scale o r the probability of nonexceedance\non the bottom scale.\nGenerally, the probability of strength effect is to reduce the probability\nof failure for structures that have been designed for about 90 percent loads or\nless, For structures that have been designed for 3 sigma loads, the probability\nof low strength (less t h a n 10 percent, Figuie 1) will increase the failures when\nit is included and thus the curves tend t o c r o s s over on the right side.\n\nThe wave slope is added directly to the angle computed using wind and\nparachute dynamics. The effect of filtering the wave slope on the resulting angle\ncan be seen in Figures 3 and 1 The filter length is based on judgement and was\n.\n\n.\n4 Thomm, Jerrell a i d Hanagud, S : Reliability-Used Econometrics of Auro.\nspace Structural Systems: Design Criteria and Test Options. NASA TN D-7646,\nJune 1974.\n\n3\n\nchosen upon the recommendation of D. Kross of MSFC. It assumes that the wave\nhalf length must be long enough to contribute to the dynamics and, therefore,\nmust approximate the surface length over which the load acts. The effects of\nfiltered wave slope on the load distribution a r e less dramatic than on the angle\nitself. The wave slope effects on all loads except cavity collapse and actuator\nwere not visible on the plots.\nA recent development in the meteorological investigations has been the\nintroduction of coning effects. The parachute/SRB dynamics are three dimensional and include a nutational pendulum motion that combines rotation about\nseveral axes simultaneously. An additional problem is that the coning dynamics\n(rotation about the local vertical axis) have less damping associated with them\nso they increass the probability of higher angles associated with low horizontal\nvelocities. Unfortunately, high angle and low velocity is a high load c a s e for\ncavity collapse. Dynamics supplied by the Systems Dynamics Laboratory at\nMSFC5 have been progranimzd ior the nozzle and cavity collapse loads. The\neffects of wave slope and coning on the cavity collapse load can be seen in\nFigure 4. The distribution including all effects is plotted as a solid line and the\nload with wave slopr: and coning effects individually removed a r e plotted as\ndashec lines.\n\nThe cavitj collapse loading case was a particular problem because the\npressure distrihtion changed shape as well as peak h e . Some of the loading\nconditions presented in MSFC document S&E-ASTN-ADL ( 74-38)6 that had the\nhighest peak p r a s u r e s were not the most severe loading conditions. Because of\nthis, the peak gressure ( Pz)cannot be used as an indicator of failure. Several\npossible indicitors were investigated. Lee load (the area under the pressure\ncurve on the lee side) shows the best agreement with eigenvalues resulting from\nstructural analyses and was used for the attrition rates computed.\n\\\n\nThe configurations evaluated a r e shown in Figures 19..22. Configuration\n0 (Fig. 1 9 ) is the proposal configuration. Configuration 1 (Fig. 20) is a design\nthat includes capability for cavity collapse. Configu.ration 1-1, modified ( Fig.\n2 ) , has been optimized with the performance margin.

This program\nuses the mission model as supplied in the requirements documents. An\nattrition rate function that reduces with time and has an average attrition rate\na s found from the SPLASH program is input. The output includes the number\nof units rcquired for the Shuttle program. The effects of refurbishment time,\nmaximum life, and the variable launch rate are all included.\nTables 3 and 4 contain the total attrition rates and units required for\n445 flights. The total attrition rate is 3 percent (for all nonwater impact\ncauses) added to the individual structure failure rate plus the sinkage rate as\nshown in Tables 1 and 2. W h e r e two numbers w e given in Table 4, the larger\nnumber represents the inwimum failure assumption for actuator cascading\nfailure effects, and the smaller number is the mfnimum assumption.
