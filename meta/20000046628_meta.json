This paper examines the role of productivity developments at British Airways from the early 1980s through 1996. The emphasis is on capital productivity and investment, but changes in capital intensity and labour productivity are also evaluated. Various measures are considered for both capital and labour productivity: outputs are measured in available tonne-kms (ATKs) and revenue tonne-kms (RTKs), with the former preferred over the latter two measures, after adjustment for work performed by BA for others. Capital inputs are measured in equivalent lease costs adjusted to constant prices with a different treatment of flight and ground equipment or assets. Labour inputs are derived from total payroll costs deflated by a UK wage price index. The airline made considerable capital investments over the period and at the same time went through two major processes of labour restructuring. This resulted in a gradual increase in capital intensity, relative high labour productivity growth, but poor capital productivity performance, However, capital investment played an important role in the airline's sustained labour and total factor productivity over the whole period.", "title": "The Role of Capital Productivity in British Airways' Financial Recovery", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T14:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000046628, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morrell, Peter"}, "organization": {"name": "Cranfield Univ.", "location": "Cranfield,  United Kingdom"}}, "id": "47974f2c80f244d096edf99e4fcb5938"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000046628, "publications": [{"volume": "4", "submissionId": 20000046628, "issue": "2", "issn": "1093-8826", "publisher": "Aviation Inst., Univ. of Nebraska", "id": "f21c18d467d94d01bd24196bbd337fb2", "publicationName": "Journal of Air Transportation World Wide", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
