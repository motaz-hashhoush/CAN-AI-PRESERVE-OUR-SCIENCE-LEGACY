And, it does so without producing toxic airborne particles common to traditional methods. The M-2000 magnetically attaches itself to the hull of the ship. Its water jets generate 40,000 pounds of pressure per square inch, blasting away paint down to the ships steel substrate. The only by product is water and dried paint chips and these are captured by a vacuum system so no toxic residue can escape. It was built out of a partnership between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the National Robotics Engineering Consortium.", "title": "Robotic Stripping", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020066498, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020066498, "isbn": "0-16-050462-7", "id": "90dea2858b124f959830a7ad1061d8bd", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2000", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020066498.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020066498/downloads/20020066498.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020066498/downloads/20020066498.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020066498/downloads/20020066498.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
