The FEC was added to automate operation of the front-end microwave hardware as part of the Deep Space Network's Parkes-Canberra Telemetry Array. Much of the front-end hardware was refurbished and reimplemented from a front-end system installed in 1985 by the European Space Agency for the Uranus encounter; however, the FEC and its associated noise-adding radiometer (NAR) were new Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) designs. Project requirements and other factors led to the development of capabilities not found in standard Deep Space Network (DSN) controllers and radiometers. The Parkes FEC/NAR performed satisfactorily throughout the Neptune encounter and was removed in October 1989.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910002670, "id": "374e66b897e04f15bca26926b86c875a", "publicationName": "The Telecommunications and Data Acquisition Report", "publicationDate": "1990-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910002670.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910002670/downloads/19910002670.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910002670/downloads/19910002670.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910002670/downloads/19910002670.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
