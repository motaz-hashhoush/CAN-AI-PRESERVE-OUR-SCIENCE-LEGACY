Just as\nsport utility vehicle owners begrudge the amount it\ncosts to fill up the tank on their gas guzzlers,\nsatellite makers are eager to find ways of making\nmore efficient thrusters for their weightier satellites. With this in mind, NASA, private industry,\nand other government agencies have been pooling\ntheir resources to help Ultramet, Inc., of Pacoima,\nCalifornia, make blasting satellites into orbit a\nmore efficient and inexpensive process. Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) funding\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center has spurred a\nnew process for producing rocket engine thrust\nchambers.\nLiquid rocket engine performance has historically been constrained by the limitations of materials and processes used for component fabrication.\nTypically, the thrust chamber, in which the propellants are combusted, must be cooled to avoid the\nbreakdown of materials, causing possible failure\nduring operation. Cooling can effectively be\nachieved by various means that, unfortunately,\nresult in a loss of efficiency.\nRocket engine efficiency is generally defined by\na measurement that indicates pounds of thrust per\nsecond of consumed fuel. This measurement is\ncalled specific impulse, or Isp, which is more or\nless analogous to miles per gallon. Higher values\nof Isp indicate higher operating efficiency. Considering the high costs of sending a single pound\npayload to orbit, the value of a modest gain in Isp is\nimportant. Such a gain in efficiency requires high\ntemperatures\xe2\x80\x94over 2,000 degrees Celsius! These\ntemperatures, however, also bring the possibility of\nmaterials breakdown. Therefore, engineers do not\nwant increases in operating temperatures at the\nexpense of engine reliability.\nThe key to achieving high-temperature capability without compromising reliability was developed, in part, because of NASA SBIR funding.\nHigh-temperature oxidation-resistant thruster\nmaterials are being fabricated by Ultramet with a\n\nUltramet, Inc., is\nmanufacturing\nhigh-temperature\noxidation-resistant\nthruster materials.\n\nnovel process, which has been proven effective\nduring successful flights of the latest generation\nsatellites.\nThe approach used for the development of such\nhigh-performance materials is simple in concept,\nbut innovative in its execution. Using a process\ncalled chemical vapor deposition (CVD), Ultramet\nis producing high-temperature capability thrust\nchambers. CVD involves heating precursors for\nmetals, such as iridium and rhenium, to temperatures at which they become gaseous and depositing\nthem onto a mandrel, or spindle, layer-by-layer to\nproduce high-density, highly resistant materials\nfrom the inside out.\nIn addition to NASA, several large companies\nhave invested nearly $25 million in the development of this technology. The payoff for the satellite\nindustry will prove to be quite large. Ultramet\nestimates that a three-percent improvement in\npropulsion system performance of a satellite could\nbe gained. That can be equated to a 50- to 100kilogram increase in the weight of communications\nmass on a satellite, a significant increase in satellite thrust capability. This gives the ever-advancing\ncommunications industry some room to broaden its\ncapabilities.\nNASA SPINOFF 2000\n\n43\n\n'
