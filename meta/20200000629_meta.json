The capacity of multi-rotor vehicles to perform vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), together with their great maneuverability, make them an excellent choice for UAM aircraft. The accurate prediction of multirotor vehicles performance and acoustics is very challenging due to the unsteady and complex flows, as well as the aerodynamic interactions. By running high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations on NASA supercomputers, researchers model the complex aerodynamics of multi-rotor flows, getting us closer to making UAM a reality.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20200000629, "endDate": "2019-11-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Association for Computing Machinery", "location": "Pittsburgh, PA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2bcaea440c1e4dc4b97ba7e09af07147", "id": "22946565f89d4fe390e674d22ab46ce0"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2bcaea440c1e4dc4b97ba7e09af07147", "id": "b6785fe5d8cb49f695b894e3c1a1bd56"}], "name": "International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC19)", "location": "Denver, Co", "id": "2bcaea440c1e4dc4b97ba7e09af07147", "startDate": "2019-11-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000629, "id": "e2efcf0a776a40e7a34ddae2d23188f7", "publicationDate": "2019-11-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "id": 20200000501, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Towards Urban Air Mobility: NASA's Quadcopter Air Taxi Concept", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200000629.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200000629/downloads/20200000629.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200000629/downloads/20200000629.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200000629/downloads/20200000629.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
