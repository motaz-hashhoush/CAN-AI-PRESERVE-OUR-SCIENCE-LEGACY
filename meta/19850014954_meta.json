The following research was performed: (1) the tectonics along the Tanlu fault in eastern China; (2) tectonics in the Taiwan Strait behind the collision zone in Taiwan; and (3) analysis of faulting in the vicinity of the Altyn Tagn fault. It is found that the existence of the fault is traced back to at least Jurassic with the deposition of conglomerate sandstones in the troungh along the present Tanlu fault branches in the Shantung Province. Taiwan is the product of collision between the Phillipine plate and the Asian plate and Taiwan came into being because of a former island arc.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850014954, "id": "590471268140469f88b292d2ec59801d", "publicationDate": "1985-03-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850014954.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850014954/downloads/19850014954.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850014954/downloads/19850014954.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850014954/downloads/19850014954.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
