This methane is subsequently vented overboard. The associated loss of hydrogen ultimately reduces the mass of oxygen that can be recovered from CO2 in a closed-loop life support system. As an alternative to SOA CO2 reduction technology, NASA is exploring a Series-Bosch system capable of reducing CO2 with hydrogen to form water and solid carbon. This results in 100% theoretical recovery of oxygen from metabolic CO2. In the past, Bosch-based technology did not trade favorably against SOA technology due to a high power demand, low reaction efficiencies, concerns with carbon containment, and large resupply requirements necessary to replace expended catalyst cartridges. An alternative approach to Bosch technology, labeled \"Series-Bosch,\" employs a new system design with optimized multi-stage reactors and a membrane-based separation and recycle capability. Multi-physics modeling of the first stage reactor, along with chemical process modeling of the integrated system, has resulted in a design with potential to trade significantly better than previous Bosch technology. The modeling process and resulting system architecture selection are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120014939, "endDate": "2012-07-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "42nd International Conference on Environmental Systems", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "41d63dceef4d47b48324edc270133721", "startDate": "2012-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120014939, "id": "f7becdff4ecc4382beec5297bec94484", "publicationDate": "2012-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120014939.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120014939/downloads/20120014939.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120014939/downloads/20120014939.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120014939/downloads/20120014939.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
