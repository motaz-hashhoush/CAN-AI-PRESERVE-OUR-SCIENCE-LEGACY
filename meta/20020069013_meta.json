The substrate has to serve as a two-dimensional template for adatom mounting with a reasonable confinement barrier and also provide electronic isolation, preventing unwanted coupling between independent adatom structures. However, the two requirements conflict. For excellent electronic isolation, we may seek adatom confinement via van der Waals interaction without chemical bonding to the substrate atoms, but the confinement turns out to be very weak and hence unsatisfactory. An alternative chemical bonding scheme with excellent structural strength is examined, but even fundamental adatom chain properties such as whether chains are semiconducting or metallic are strongly influenced by the nature of the chemical bonding, and electronic isolation is not always achieved. Conditions for obtaining semiconducting chains with well-localized surface-modes, leading to good isolation, are clarified and discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020069013, "id": "c7e862aea9554936a0f381394e7e0356", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020069013.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020069013/downloads/20020069013.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020069013/downloads/20020069013.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020069013/downloads/20020069013.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
