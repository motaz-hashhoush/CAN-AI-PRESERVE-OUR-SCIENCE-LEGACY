Their time scales range from the day-to-day changes due to atmospheric motions through seasonal and annual variations to 11 year cycles resulting from changes in the sun UV output. Because of the magnitude of all of these variations is not well known and highly variable, it is necessary to measure over more than one period of the variations to remove their effects. This means that at least 2 or more times the 11 year sunspot cycle. Thus, the first requirement is for a long term data record. The second related requirement is that the record be consistent. A third requirement is for reasonable global sampling, to ensure that the effects are representative of the entire Earth. The various observational methods relevant to trend detection are reviewed to characterize their quality and time and space coverage. Available data are then examined for long term trends or recent changes in ozone total content and vertical distribution, as well as related parameters such as stratospheric temperature, source gases and aerosols.", "title": "Global trends", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Megie, G."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "0009a8765c3b4dcf91047fe9419d38e9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chanin, M.-L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "f5ca85281d5240fe9f5f2c722b252a6d"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ehhalt, D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "1f4654b7e7fb4eb38f874b3816fd3685"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fraser, P."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "7baf523063eb47eca8c7832fa1724495"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19920006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Frederick, J.
