Riles\nHQ Space Division/Y00\nLos Angeles AFS, CA\n\nABSTRACT\nAs we approached the first space Shuttle launch, the tension and excitement increased with each\npassing day. The dedication and resolve of the joint government/contractor team was also increasing\nas we approached the Flight Readiness Firing (FRF) test. The FRF test afforded us an opportunity to\nassess the readiness or the integrated systems to support the STS-1 launch and flight. The assessment\nincluded the following integrated systems: Structures and mechanics; thermal design integration; propulsion and power; avionics and software; guidance, navigation, and control; mechanical systems; communications and tracking; an integrated ground systems.\nThe Space Shuttle Flight Readiness Firing was also an excellent opportunity to exercise the operational capability developed for STS-1 at a time when test teams, facilities, plans and procedures\nwere in a flight ready condition.\nTo ensure that we were prepared to function effectively as an integrated team for STS-1, we\nconducted a simulation of the pre-mission activities, countdown and launch operations, and postmission activities associated with STS-1 in conjunction with the Space Shuttle Flight Readiness Firing. The exercise involved all STS-1 management and operations elements functioning as they would\nfor STS-1 launch to the degree that was practical and productive.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe final step in the Space Shuttle system verification network prior to the first DOW flight\nwas a static firing of the Space Shuttle main engines using mated flight vehicle elements in as near\nas possible flight configuration, on launch pad 39A at KSC. The flight readiness firing (FRF) was\nconducted as part of the countdown demonstration test (CCDT) for the first Shuttle manned flight.\nIn previous space and missile programs, static firing and integrated flight control and propulsion tests were conducted at a test site prior to the vehicles arriving at the launch sites. However,\ndue to the unique design and multi-elements of the Shuttle, all flight systems (propulsion, flight\ncontrol and avionics) were not integrated until mated at the launch site. Although each element and\nsubsystem of the Shuttle goes through development and verification test, including a main propulsion\nsystem test (MPT) utilizing a flight ET or Orbiter aft fuselage with SSMEs, the total integrated system was not available until the vehicle was mated at the launch pad. Two other important factors\nnecessitated a flight readiness firing: (1) the Shuttle program had no unmanned flights scheduled\nand (2) no facility checkout vehicle. Specific system objectives realized from the FRF were:\na. First verification of the flight MPS and associate subsystem structural integrity and\nperformance during SSME firing (exact launch conditions up to SRB ignition).\nb. First verification of the adequacy of flame and heat protective shielding for SRBs and ET\nduring SSME pre-liftoff firing and simulated launch abort shutdown.\nc.\n\nFirst integrated avionics/MPS test (SSME control and monitoring with Orbiter avionics).\n\nd.\n\nFirst integrated APU/hydraulics/SSME/flight control functional test.\n\ne.\n\nAdditional verification of prelaunch servicing procedures and countdown timelines.\n\nf.\n\nAdditional SSME cluster firing data to verify first flight vehicle MPS predicted performance.\n\nThe FRF was conducted with an unmanned Orbiter. Additional switch control functions had been\nprovided in the Orbiter for ground control through the launch processing system (LPS) that would not\nhave been required for a manned FRF. These additional ground control functions, plus a modified\nflight software program, allows the Shuttle main propulsion system (MPS) to be tested at the launch\npad with the vehicle configured for flight. The solid rocket boosters (SRB) flight control systems\nwere not activated for the FRF; however, SRB ignition commands and SRB holddown release signals were\nverified. The Orbiter T-0 umbilicals and the external tank liftoff umbilicals remained connected dur-\n\n510\n\n\t\n\ning the 2-second firing of the MPS. The Orbiter Orbital maneuvering systems (OMS) and the forward\nand aft reaction control systems (RCS) were not activated during the FRF. Orbiter flight control commands were exercised during the 20-second firing. At the termination of the 20-second firing, the\nthree SSME\'s were sequentially shut down simulating a prelaunch shutdown. Following the post firing\nsecuring, a vehicle inspection and data analysis were conducted and the vehicle was reconfigured and\nprepared for the first STS launch.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nTest Philosophy\nWet CDDT/FRF was a detailed practice run for the STS-1 launch and, as such, identified any failure or weaknesses in any systems or operating conditions not occurring during pretesting. All conditions were identical to or as close to the actual STS-1 timelines and launch preparation as possible.\nThis was a one-time-only test on Orbiter vehicle 102 and was preceded by a tanking and detanking\ncheckout of the Orbiter, external tank, and ground systems/facilities. The FRF-unique and piggyback\nsoftware tests at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory at Johnson Space Center (JSC) were\ncompleted and instrumentation for special test installed, characterized, and calibrated. All facility and servicing equipment was operationally ready to support FRF countdown. The Space Shuttle main\nengines (SSME) hardware backup shutdown capability checkout was completed. The crew cabin was not\nmanned once propellant loading started and those Shuttle subsystems that required operational control\nafter that time was configured for and had ground remote control capability. The T-0 umbilical\ninterfaces were maintained through the FRF along with general purpose computer/launch processing system (GPC/LPS) polling command capability.\nThe FRF firing duration was limited to approximately 20 seconds of main stage operation. SSME\nstart was identical to STS-1 launch: The engines were tested at 94 percent and 100 percent rated\npower level (RPL) with shutdown occurring from 100 percent RPL (launch abort). SSME gimbaling was\nperformed at both power levels. See Figure 1 and 2 for FRF thrust profile and FRF gimbaling profile.\n\nZ\nJ\n\nU D]\nQ\n\nSSMEC\nINHIBITS\nFASCOS ,\n\nw^\n\nO\n\n100%\n94%\n\nm\n\n^Q\n\nTIMES FROM\nENG 3 START\nT + (FRF timers) 0\n\nz^\ncf\t\n\nO\t O\n\n1\n\n1\n\nN N O O CC O\t\n\nO\n\nM N N N NLo\t\nO N M N\t\n\nV\t\n\no0\n\nO\nM\n\n1\n\n90% 1 1\t\n\n11\n\nI\nSSME 1\n\nti\n\nx\n\nI\t\n\nSSME2&3\n1\n\nI\t\n\nGIMBALING\t\nF^^\n3.125 Hz\t\n\nGIMBALING\t\n3.125 Hz\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\n^\t\n\nI\n\n21.2\t\n\n26.2\n\n20 CYCLES\n\n6.4 sec\nCOUNTDOWN TIME \xe2\x80\x94 3.8\n\nT-0\n\nj\t\nI I\n\nI\t I\n\nSRM +3.2\nIGN\nCIVIC\n\n10.6\t\nTIME (sec)\n\n14.6\t\n\n18.2\t\n\nT-3.8 (engine 3 start cmd)\n\n2.64 sec\n\nT - 0 ENGINES REACH 90% THRUST\n\nFigure 1.- FRF thrust profile.\n\n511\n\n+0.64\xc2\xb0\nw +0.32\xc2\xb0\n\nC\n~ 0\nJ\n\nd\na\n\n-0.32\xc2\xb0\n-0.64\xc2\xb0\nONE CYCLE\n3.125 Hz\nFigure 2.- FRF gimbaling profile.\n\nThe flight and ground software were structured to maintain the launch processing system (LPS)\ncontact with the vehicle throughout the test and preclude the flight software from progressing to\nmajor mode 102 (ascent). Redundant set launch sequence (RSLS) flight software operated in major mode\n101 (prelaunch) and controlled the functions of the Orbiter systems and issued commands to the rest\nof the Shuttle vehicle from T-35 seconds until approximately T+26 seconds for FRF. The time from T-20\nminutes to T-0, was identical to STS-1 countdown. The time from T-0 to approximately T+26 was FRF\ntest software control. This test verified that the Shuttle vehicle was ready for launch.\nThe various phases of the wet CDDT/FRF were:\no Pre-FRF started with power up for the CDDT/FRF simulated run just prior to the actual test\no Wet CDDT/FRF began with the launch countdown type of action starting at T-53 hours with call\nto station from OMI S0014 and verification of configuration of all elements ready for the test\no FRF ended with the last cryogenic liquid out of the vehicle, which was the beginning of\npost-FRF activities\no Post-FRF ended with the completion of all FRF-unique objectives, closeout of the test\ndiscrepancies affecting configuration, and the OMRSD requirements being met\n\nTEST OR.IFCTTVFS\nFRF provided the only opportunity to subject the Space Transportation System (STS) to the launch\nenvironment without concern for ascent transition. The test provided confidence that the STS was\nfully integrated in the critical functions where elements have not been tested together in the launch\nenvironment. The primary test objectives to be accomplished during this test were:\no Exercise all elements of the STS, including personnel, facilities, vehicle, and software in\na real-time launch countdown culminating in a SSME firing and simulated launch to ensure proper integration prior to STS-1 flight\no Verify the capability of the launch facility to provide propellants to the Shuttle at\nspecified conditions (i.e., subjecting the external tank (ET) and Orbiter elements to the same thermal\nenvironment as STS-1 and to maintain pressure in the ET from the ET/SSME and main propulsion system\n(MPS) control during SSME firing)\no Verify the functional performance of the integrated auxiliary power unit(APU)/hydraulic/flight\ncontrol system during simultaneous engine gimbaling and throttling\no Load and operate the power reactant supply and distribution (PRSD) system in the Orbiter with\ncryogenic reactants for the first time\no Verify the predicted performance of the ET-SSME-MPS interfaces and systems, including software and the capability of the avionics equipment to effectively monitor and control the active vehicle under dynamic prelift-off vibroacoustic conditions\no Verify that LPS/6PC control of launch countdown sequencing can be performed down to T-0 along\nwith simulated launch abort shutdown and securing in post T-0 time\no Verify compatibility of the Shuttle avionics equipment with the launch radio frequency environment\no Provide data to verify the validity of modeling techniques to extend dynamic and vibroacoustic\nanalysis from previous test to KSC conditions\no Assess the "twang" effects of the SSME: in the start position at ignition, and on the STS\nflight vehicle without SRM ignition\no Exercise the data acquisition system, data reduction methods, and data analysis documentation\nmethods to be used for launch\n\n512\n\nORIGMAL PAGE 4\n\nTEST DESCRIPTION\t\n\nOF POOR QUALITY,\nSEQUENCING\nThe sequence of operations between T-52 hours and T+160 hours are summarized in Figures 3 and 4.\n\n-120 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 -0 +20 +40 +60 +80 +100 +120 +140 +160 +180 hrs\nO PREPS\nE161 C DDT IFRF S I M TEST\nAPU AND HPU HYDRAZINE SERVICING\nH 2 O BOILER SERVICING\nM PRSD LOADING\nI\n\nM SRSS ACT.

Program\nconcern was expressed that a similar condition would occur during FRF or during a pad abort.\nA study was made by the integration contractor to determine thermal effects on the most sensitive vehicle hardware (engine mounted heatshield) and to evaluate and recommend an effective means of\nprotecting the vehicle against the potential from an engine shutdown/abort as mentioned above.\nA facility system with a series of water spray nozzles mounted around the periphery of the MLP\nopening and directed to impact discrete areas of the Orbiter aft heatshield structure was recommended\nand approved by the Level II PRCB. As designed, the system is tied to the MLP fire system to be\nactivated manually from the LCC after detection of a potentially damaging afterburning condition.\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS\n1. Damage to TPS. - Potential damage to TPS by direct impact of the water spray was a primary\nconcern of the proposed system. To answer this question a special water spray impact test was\ncarried out at the integration contractor\'s laboratory and test facility in Downey, CA. Results of\nthe test demonstrated that TPS would not be damaged with the planned application of the nozzles.\nAlso, characteristics of the nozzle spray plume (throw distance and diameter vs. pressure) were determined to verify proper nozzle selection/application.\n2. Dedicated Spray System - The requirement of a fully independent water supply for the\nOrbiter-SSME deluge system could not be met on STS-1. This was due to the fact that the existing 6"\ndiameter supply line is flow limited and can serve only one of the three major Orbiter protective\nspray systems at any given time.\nFor STS-3 this condition will be eliminated by the replacement of the 6" supply line with a 12" line,\npermitting full flow to all of the protective systems simultaneously, if necessary. Incorporation of\nthe 12" supply on MLP-1 for STS-1 was delayed until STS-3 due to the high potential for impacting FRF\nand the STS-1 launch schedule with the significant construction effort required on the MLP.\n3. Automatic vs. Manual Spray Actuation - Initial system requirements specified that the\nOrbiter- S ME deluge system be initiated by automatic control in the event of a planned or aborted\nSSME shutdown to minimize the reaction time for flow of the protective spray.\nDue to potential vehicle launch schedule impact in the event that water sprays were activated\nneedlessly (without significant afterburning) following engine shutdown, direction was given by the\nPRCB that the system would be manually activated. As planned, control of the system will be under\nthe cognizance of an operator in the LCC augmented by UV sensors viewing the SSME nozzles and observation of the vehicle through closed circuit TV.\n4. Alignment Verification of Spray Nozzles - During the nozzle alignment procedure prior to FRF\nit was determined that four of the spray nozzles on the north side of the MLP would impact directly\non the trailing edge of the Orbiter body flap. To avoid the potential of TPS damage those nozzles\nwere changed to fog jet nozzles which produce a "softer" spray with less impact energy at the tile\nsurface.\n5. Water Contamination of OMS Nozzles - The use of fly-away-throat plugs for the OMS engines\nwas deemed unacceptable to the Program and will not be used on STS-1 and subs. To minimize the possibility of direct spray entering the OMS engines, two water nozzles were re-aimed. This request was\ninitiated through a formal Engineering Service Request (ESR) as a manadatory requirement prior to\nSTS-1 and has been accomplished.\n6. Water Flow Test - A full deluge test with the vehicle in place was deemed not feasible due\nto potential schedule/cost impact to FRF/STS-1. In lieu of this final vertification test the following procedures were approved by the Program as an acceptable means of determining adequacy of the system:\na. Analysis of A&E calculations for flow-pressure.\n\n514\n\nb. Alignment of water spray nozzles using a light source to assure that spray impact areas\nwere in accordance with the design drawings.\n\nResults\nAll of the potential problems associated with Orbiter-SSME deluge system have been resolved as\nnoted. Completion of the ESR for re-aiming at water nozzles has been implemented for STS-1.\n\nHYDROGEN BURN-OFF SYSTEM\n\nDescription\nA detailed assessment of main engines ignition overpressure data from MPTA Static Firings in\nearly 1980 revealed the necessity of a hydrogen burn-off system at the launch pad to avoid potentially damaging overpressures caused by ignition of the SSME fuel lead of hydrogen gas at engine\nstart.\nDue to the limited time available prior to STS-1, a NASA/Contractor working group was\nestablished to expedite the design, development, delivery, and verification of the burn-off system.\nAfter evaluation of alternate methods including an engine mounted fly-away system, a pyrotechnic\ninitiated, facility ground system was baselined by the PRCB. This concept utilized an "off-the-shelf"\nigniter to minimize delivery time and provide greater assurance of supporting STS-1 with a functionally qualified system.\nIn addition, the development of a second pyrotechnic device (the long throw igniter) was\napproved as a backup to the baselined unit. In concept, this unit offered distinct advantages over\nthe baselined short throw igniter.\na. It could be mounted on the tail service masts thus eliminating the need for cumbersome\npylons required to support the short throw igniters.\nb.\n\nAvoided interference/operational contraints with engine access platforms.\n\nc.\n\nEliminated handling and maintenance of pylons.\n\nd.\n\nEnhanced safety.\n\ne.\nIt delivered a high density pattern of ignition particles under the entire area of the\nSSME nozzle.\nThe major disadvantage of this device was the limited time available to accomplish the full\ndevelopment and qualification program that would be required prior to STS-1.\nAn integrated Vertification Plan was formulated for the candidate pyro devices which included\nthe orderly progression from single engine testing at SSFL leading to cluster engine testing on\nthe MPTA at NSTL.\n\nProblems\nThe subsequent implementation of this plan, and the problems encountered, resulted in the timely\nevolution of the preferred long throw igniter:\na. Analyses in support of testing revealed that the short throw igniter could be adversely\naffected by wind. Conversely, the long-throw igniter was relatively insensitive to the wind. (This\nwas later confirmed by wind tests conducted at the vendor\'s facilities).\nb. On Static Firing 12, data acquired on the first usage of the long throw igniters revealed\nhigh overpressure levels associated with engine E-1. The baseline design provided igniters for E-3\nand E-2 only, for both MPTA at NSTL and OV-102 at KSC. This was due to difficulties involved in\nmounting short throw igniters near Engine 1 and the belief that E-1 hydrogen would be ignited by E3 and E-2 burning. MPT SF12 demonstrated the necessity of igniters on all three engines.\n\n515\n\n\t\n\nFRF-H 2 INGESTION IN THE AFT FUSALAGE\n\n0.10\n\n957 PPM\n0.09\t\n\n- 910 PPM\t\n\n17, 300 SC IM\n\nAIR INGESTION\nCORRECTION\n\nSLUG OF PREMIXED\n\nq HGDS\n\nGAS FROM X 1307\t\n\n0.08\n\nI\n\nBHD\t\n\nFRF\n\n0.07\n\n0.06\n\n= 0.05\n\nPERFECT MIXING AT\nMAXIMUM ALLOWABLE\n0.04\n\n18239 SCIM H2\n\n\\ ^\xe2\x80\x94 FRF FITTED\n0.03\n\n0\n\nO\nO\n\n0.02\t\n\nEARLY\t\n\n0.01\t\n\nCD\n\nAS HIGH\t\nAS 60 PPM\t\n\n00\n\nCOUNTS\n\ni\t\n\nBHD FLOW\nBEGINS AGAIN\n\nBHD FLOW STOPS\n0.00\t\n-300 -200\t\n\niff\t\n\n0\t\n\n100\t\n\n200\t\n\n300\t\n\n400\t\n\n500\n\nTIME (sec)\nFigure 5.- FRF--H 2 ingestion in the aft fuselage.\nResults\nInherent throw capability of the long throw igniter and simplicity of the mechanical installation on the TSMs made it feasible to add the additional igniters for Engine 1 at KSC. This was accomplished with no impact to the FRF schedule.\nReview of FRF data has indicated an effective burn-off system that limited the SSME overpressure\nto less than 0.1 PSID. The Hydrogen Burn-Off System was now qualified to support STS-1.\n\nFLIGHT READINESS FIRING (50014)\n\nOverall Objective\nProvide final verification of critical integrated systems (i.e., main propulsion system, etc.).\n\n516\n\nDry CDDT Objectives\na.\n\nInterface the flight crew and launch test team in a count rehearsal.\n\nb.\n\nDemonstrate the sequence of operations required to prepare Shuttle for launch.\n\nc.\n\nEvaluate timelines established for launch countdown.\n\nProblems\nThe FRF countdown went very smoothly. There were a total of 151 Interim Problem Reports\n(IPRs) written against the test of which 13 affected the ground equipment. Of the 13 IPRs the\nfollowing five were considered to be significant:\nPRSD Sampling Results (IPR-017). During the ground servicing of the PRSD system, samples\nof the reactant gases failed to pass the sample test. The H 2 contained a high percentage of GHe\nand the 0 2 contained a high percentage of GN2. It has been determined that this was caused by\na ground procedure problem during the pulse purging of the ground system. This problem was corrected\nprior to STS-1 launch.\nWater Leaking at OAA/Orbiter Interface (IPR-038). During the FRF countdown, rain water was\nleaking past the dock seal of the OAA white room at the Orbiter moldline when the RSS was retracted.\nPrior to this time, the item of GSE which prevents water from entering the crew hatch was not\ninstalled. The GSE model A70-0643-3 is a Fiberglass scupper that fits over the crew hatch to direct\nwater away from the hatch. Without this GSE installed, water was allowed to enter the crew module.\nA significant amount of water had to be removed after FRF.\nThis problem was resolved prior to launch in that the GSE (A70-0643-3) was installed around the\ncrew hatch.\nGOX Vent Hood. During the tanking test prior to FRF it was noted that GOX vapors were leaking\nfrom the GOX vent hood during loading of the ET LOX tank. It was determined that the leakage was\npast the seal where the seal interfaces with the ET tank SOFI. This GOX leakage past the seal caused\nerosion of the SOFI on the ET.\nPressure was increased on the seal for FRF but the seal ruptured on the South side of the ET\ntank just below the louvers. The tank was approximately 12-14 percent full and it was decided to retract the hood at that time and proceed with the LOX loading. The seal on the North side operated\nproperly.\nSubsequent to FRF a series of tests were run at LETF to evaluate the problem. It was found that\nreplacing the orifice configuration from a standard orifice to a cruiciform orifice lowered the pressure on the louvers and evenly distributed the pressure on the louvers. The pressures on the North\nand South seals were now essentially the same.\nSubsequent to FRF an evaluation of the location of the GOX vent arm indicated that the seal may\nhave been slightly out of position and on one corner of the louvers rather than on the SOFI. This\nwould have contributed to the failure. Steps have been taken to accurately position the seal around\nthe louvers.\nOn March 9, 1981, the Level II PRCB decided to install the cruciform orifice on ET-1 based on\nthe LETF tests. Starting March 13, 1981, a series of tests were conducted on the LETF with an\nimproved seal design and cruciform orifice. The tests were successful.\nHypergolic Storage Tank. An incident occurred prior to the FRF countdown involving the\nhypergolic storage tank located on the perimeter road around the pad. During hypergolic servicing,\nthe heater in the storage tank failed. Servicing continued, resulting in a failure of the storage\ntank. A new heater has been installed in the tank and a constraint has been added that use of\nthe tank when the heater is off is prohibited.\nPressure Spike LOX Fill and Drain System. A pressure spike of approximately 150 psig occurred\non the ground side of the LOX fill and drain line during detanking. The pressure on the Orbiter\nside of the interface did not exceed the proofpressure of the line. Preliminary indications revealed\nthat this problem can be corrected procedurally by refilling the ground system up to the vehicle\ninterface prior to initiating LOX tank drain. This was not implemented until STS-2.\n\n517\n\nResults\nIn summary, the ground systems performed exceptionally well. All test objectives were met\nand the ground systems were ready to support launch.\n\nWET CDDT/FRF TEST RESULTS\nThe Wet CDDT/FRF test was very successful. We increased our knowledge about the integrated Shuttle MPS system. All the SSMEs will leak some hydrogen. The SSME joints will leak hydrogen and oxygen below specification levels. MPS leak tests procedures in the OPF should be improved. The STS-1\ntests procedures were for joints only and the pressure was at 25 PSI.

NAVIGATION. AND CONTROL\n\nInte q rated Guidance Navi g ation and Control (IGN&C) FRF Test Objectives\nThe prime FRF test objectives of a total GN&C system integration nature included: (a) demonstration of capatible initialization of TVC actuator commands for hydraulics application, engine start,\nrun and shutdown positions, (b) the ability to perform the prelaunch gimbal slew checks, (c) compatibility of the Orbiter avionics/software with the SRB thrust vector control system, (d) confirmation\nthat the dynamic response of the SSME TVC system, in the "near flight" configuration, was comparable\nwith that obtained from MPTA test results, and (e) provision of a test data point on analytically\npredicting elastic body response to a control effector command.\nIGN&C Data Assessment - The first objective was accomplished successfully, although the yaw\nactuator on SSME 1 had drifted to -1.04 degrees (from the desired value of zero degrees) prior to\nOrbiter APU start. This was expected due to a non-zero plumbing torque on the nozzle at zero deflection. The second objective was accomplished with no anomalies; i.e., the slew checks were performed\n\n519\n\nsuccessfully on all actuators, even though the SRB HPUs were shut down prematurely prior to completion of the SRB nozzle slew. There was adequate kinetic energy in the turbine to permit slew completion. Ability of the Orbiter to properly orient the SRB nozzles was demonstrated with no anomalies.\nThis FRF test provided significant and substantial information relative to the flight readiness\nof STS-1 in areas pertinent to the general technical discipline of GN&C. This was in the form of assurances that: (a) the prelaunch procedure successfully prepared avionics, propulsion and hydraulic\nsubsystems for launch, (b) the LPS was properly integrated with the on-board avionics, and (c) in the\nlimited scope of the test, the individual GN&C elements (consisting of sensors, data processing, and\ncontrol effectors) performed their required functions.\n\nSRB THRUST VECTOR CONTROL\nAll four of\nprematurely.

This caused the A system APU controller to receive a delayed "hydraulic pressure OK" signal fron the B system HPU which caused the A system APU controller to command the A system APU to operate at 110% speed longer than normal. The extended 110% speed operation caused the APU to exceed\nthe 79,200 rpm redline. Exceeding the redline instituted a shutdown of a A system APU. When A system APU shutdown, A system "hydraulic pressure OK" signal was lost by the B system APU controller.\nThis caused the B system controller to command B system APU to operate at 110% speed which shutdown\nB system APL\' at T-11 seconds because of exceeding the 79,200 rpm (Figure 7). All APU\'s operated\nproperly as commanded. The APU\'s on the right hand SRB also shutdown prematurely due to similar\ncauses but with somewhat different times of occurrence. System A shutdown at T-13 seconds and system\n\n520\n\n\t\n\nB shutdown at T+2 seconds. The delay in shutting down system B was caused by having to unlock the\nMDM which is locked out at T-10 seconds.\nThe turbine speed time histories for all four APUs are shown in Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nRATE APU B TURBINE SPEED SENSOR B \t\n\n100 MSID B46R1409C\t\n\nMSID 646R2408C\t\n\nRATE APU A TURBINE SPEED SENSOR B\n\n100\njU A SYSTEM SHUTDOWN\t\n\n2.0\n80\n\nL\t\n\n111\t\n\n60\n\n0O 60\n\n1\ntz\n1\t\n\n40\n\nI\n\n^\t\n\n11\n1\t\n\n20\n\nr ^\t\n0\n\n20\n\nii 11\n\nlI\t\n\nI\t\n\n-20\t\n\n-10\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\n1\t\n\n0\t\n\n10\t\n\nSECONDS RELATIVE TO 1981 51.13.45 \t\n\n1\t\n\n1\n\n20\t\n\n^1\t\n\n30\t\n\n10\t\n\n0\t\n\n-10\t\n\n20\n\nSECONDS RELATIVE TO 1981 51.13.45 \t\n\nFigure 7.- Left hand SRB system B\t\nturbine speed.\t\n\nMS I D B46R2409C\t\n\n-20\t\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\n\n1\t\n\nFigure 8.- Right hand SRB system A\nturbine speed.\n\nRATE APU B TURB I NE S PEED SENSOR B\n\n100 r\n\n80\n\n\xe2\x80\x947L]\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n60\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nI\'\n\nY\t\n11\n\nN\t\n\nI\t\n\n40\n\n1\nAPU SYSTENA I1\nSHUTDOWN\t\n1\n\n^\t\n\n20\t\n\nI\n\nNOM LOCK OUT\n\n1\n\n^I\n\n0\n-20\t\n\n-10\t\n\n0\n\n0\t\n\n10\t\n\n20\t\n\nSECONDS RELATIVE TO 1981 51.13.45 1. 0\nFigure 9.- Right hand SRB system B turbine speed.\n\n521\n\n30\n\n30\n\n\t\n\nRESULTS\nFurther evaluation of the HPU shutdown problem has verified earlier findings.

All integrated systems FRF objectives were satisfied by the FRF test and the\nfollow-on data analyses. The significant results of the test included validation of the launch countdown sequencing, including critical event timing; demonstration of flight configured MPS functional\nand performance charcteristics; math model validation for prediction of pre-launch loads; additional\ndata for verification of pre-launch vibroacoustic and thermal environments.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nTech Notes\t\n\nMajor Warren L.

Space Transportation System (STS): An integrated system consisting of the Space Shuttle\n(Orbiter, External Tank, Solid Rocket Booster, and Flight Kits), Upper Stages, Payloads, and any\nassociated flight/ground hardware and software.\n2.\n\nOrbital Flight Test (OFT): One of four (4) scheduled developmental space flights of the\n\nSTS.\n3. Flight: That portion of a mission encompassing the period from launch to landing, or launch\nto termination, of the active life of a spacecraft. The term "Shuttle Flight" means a single Shuttle\nround trip (launch, Orbital, activity, and return). One flight may deliver more than one payload; and\nmore than one flight may be required to accomplish one mission.\n4. Ground Support Equipment (GSE): Nonflight equipment, and devices required for the handling,\nservicing, inspection, testing, maintenance, alignment, adjustments, checking, repairing, and\noverhauling of an operational end item or subsystem or component part thereof. This may include\nequipment required to support another item of GSE as defined herein.\n5. Countdown Demonstration Test (CDDT) - Wet: A full dress rehearsal of the launch countdown\noperations including cryogenic propellant loading of the external tank. Test normally terminates at\ntime for Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) ignition. Flight crew does not participate from the vehicle.\n6. Countdown Demonstration Test (CDDT) - Dry: A dress rehearsal, with flight crew participation, of the Launch Countdown operations excluding external tank propellant loading operations.\n7. Flight Readiness Firing (FRF): A 20-second firing of the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs)\nin a near Shuttle flight configuration on the launch pad, with a scheduled cutoff prior to Solid\nRocket Booster (SRB) ignition and liftoff, to be conducted (one-time only) as part of the CDDT.\n8. Cutoff: The initiation of the SSME shutdown sequence, whether generated by the SSME controller, GPC, --EPS or FEP hardwire.\n9. Automatic Cutoff: SSME shutdown resulting from an out-of-tolerance parameter monitored by\neither the SSME contro er, GPC or LPS for cutoff criteria.\n10. Manual Cutoff: SSME shutdown initiated by console operator. LPS is backed up by a\nhardwire. The hardwire- bypasses the common data buffer and inputs directly to the FEP.\n11.\n\nAADS\n\nAscent Air Data System\n\n12.\n\nDDT&E\n\nDesign, Development,\t Test\t and\t Evaluation\n\n13.\n\nFASCOS\n\nFlight Acceleration Safety Cutoff System\n\n14.\n\nLETF\n\nLaunch Equipment Test Facility\n\n15.\n\nMPTA\n\nMain\t Propulsion Test Article\n\n523\n\n16.\n\nNSTL\n\nNational Space Technology Laboratory\n\n17.\n\nOMI\n\nOperations\t and Maintenance\t Instruction\n\n18.\n\nPRCB\n\nProgram Requirements Change Board\n\n19.\n\nPRSD\n\nPower Reactant Supply and Distribution\n\n20.\n\nPV&O\n\nPurge,\t Vent,\t\n\n21.\n\nSPS\n\nSamples per Second\n\n22.\n\nSSFL\n\nSanta Susana Field Laboratory\n\n23.\n\nTPS\n\nThermal\t Protection System\n\nand Drain\n\n524\n\n'
