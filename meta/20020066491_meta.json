It analyzes the origin, radiation, and scattering of noise, and supplies information on how to achieve noise reduction and improve sound characteristics. COMET's Structural Acoustic Foam Engineering (SAFE) module extends the sound field analysis capability of foam and other materials. SAFE shows how noise travels while airborne, how it travels within a structure, and how these media interact to affect other aspects of the transmission of noise. The COMET software reduces design time and expense while optimizing a final product's acoustical performance. COMET was developed through SBIR funding and Langley Research Center for Automated Analysis Corporation.", "title": "The Imagery of Sound", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020066491, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020066491, "isbn": "0-16-050462-7", "id": "49e7087e2bbc4daaa787e7c7609a1ec5", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2000", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020066491.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020066491/downloads/20020066491.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020066491/downloads/20020066491.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020066491/downloads/20020066491.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
