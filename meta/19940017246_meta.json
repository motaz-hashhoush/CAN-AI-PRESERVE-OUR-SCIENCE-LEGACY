Our analysis is particularly important in pipelined microprocessors where instructions are frequently reordered to avoid costly delays in execution caused by hazards. Our work has significant implications to safety and security critical applications since reordering can easily change the meaning and an instruction sequence and current techniques are largely ad hoc. Our work is done in a mechanical theorem prover and results in a set of trustworthy rules for instruction reordering. The mechanization makes it practical to analyze the entire instruction set.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940017246, "id": "9a60f90a28b04d61afe2b4e2206a1fdc", "publicationName": "The 1992 4th NASA SERC Symposium on VLSI Design", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940016850, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Networks Technology Conference", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940017246.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940017246/downloads/19940017246.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940017246/downloads/19940017246.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940017246/downloads/19940017246.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
