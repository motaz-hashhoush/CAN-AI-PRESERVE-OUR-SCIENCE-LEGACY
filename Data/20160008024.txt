There are 11 projects that\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has contributed to or led:\n(1) Evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo): Cyrogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer Engineering Development\nUnit (EDU), a proof of manufacturability effort, used to\nenhance knowledge and technology related to handling\ncryogenic propellants, specifically liquid hydrogen.\n(2) Composites for Exploration Upper Stage (CEUS):\nDesign, build, test, and address flight certification of\na large composite shell suitable for the second stage of\nthe Space Launch System (SLS).\n(3) Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC): Spaceflight to\ndemo small, low-mass atomic clock that can provide\nunprecedented stability for deep space navigation.\n(4) Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM): Demo\nof high-performance, green propellant propulsion system suitable for Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle\n(EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA)-class\nspacecraft.\n(5) Human Exploration Telerobotics (HET): Demonstrating how telerobotics, remote control of a variety\nof robotic systems, can take routine, highly repetitive,\ndangerous or long-duration tasks out of human hands.\n(6) Laser Communication Relay Demo (LCRD): Demo\nto advance optical communications technology toward\ninfusion into deep space and near Earth operational systems, while growing the capabilities of industry sources.\n\n68\n\n(7) Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD): Demo\nnew supersonic inflatable decelerator and parachute\ntechnologies to enable Mars landings of larger payloads\nwith greater precision at a wider range of altitudes.\n(8) Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Entry Descent &\nLanding Instrumentation (MEDLI): Demo of embedded sensors embedded in the MSL heat shield, designed\nto record the heat and atmospheric pressure experienced during the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s high-speed, hot entry in\nthe Martian atmosphere.\n(9) Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP): 50-kW class spacecraft that uses flexible blanket solar arrays for power\ngeneration and an electric propulsion system that delivers payload from low-Earth orbit to higher orbits.\n(10) Solar Sail Demonstration (SSD): Demo to validate\nsail deployment techniques for solar sails that are propelled by the pressure of sunlight.\n(11) Terrestrial HIAD Orbit Reentry (THOR): Demo of\na 3.7-m Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) entry vehicle to test second generation aerothermal performance and modeling.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nHuman Exploration Telerobotics (a) and Green Propellant\nInfusion Mission (b)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\nSolar Electric Propulsion (a) and (b) and Laser\nCommunication Relay Decelerator Demo (c)\n\nLDSD technologies and test capabilities.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\n\nPotential Applications\nTDM technologies can enable new missions or enhance\nexisting ones.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\n2014 was an extremely successful year for TDM projects. There were 11 projects that had accomplishments\ninvolving MSFC:\n(1) CEUS: A successful key design point-A (KDP-A)\nwas completed for this project.\n(2) DSAC: A successful KDP-C was completed.\nRepeatable manufacturing of the ion trap tube was demonstrated and multiple ion trap tubes in a closed loop\nconfiguration was operated successfully. Also, a completed Surrey Flight Services agreement was accomplished for this project.\n(3) eCryo: A successful CPST KDP-B was completed\nas well as a successful eCryo KDP-A. The LOX Zero\nBoil-off test was successfully completed and a Zero\nBoil-off Industry Workshop was conducted. The project also completed testing of the EDU tank at MSFC.\n(4) GPIM: This project had a very successful Critical\nDesign Review. Testing of a 1 N engineering model\n\n69\n\nTDM\n\nTDM bridges the gap between advanced technologies and flight-qualified systems. Demonstrated technologies can be used in scheduled and future missions.\nDemonstrations give a wide range of data to be used\nto improve future technologies and define the ability of\nthe hardware for future uses, making human spaceflight\nsafer and flights more successful.\n\nthruster was completed which exceeded the 10,000\ncycles for the L-1 requirement. Fabrication and integration of a 22 N engineering model thruster was completed and the integration of the BCP-100 spacecraft\nbus has started.\n(5) HET: R2 climbing legs and torso upgrade parts\nfor the International Space Station (ISS) were delivered, which launched April 2014. A new Smartphone\nwas delivered to the ISS for integration into the Smart\nSPHERES, launched July 2014.\n(6) LCRD: A successful Preliminary Design Review\nwas conducted in 2014, with 95% of Flight Modem\nEEE parts ordered.\n(7) LDSD: A Systems Integration Review was conducted. A successful supersonic test flight was conducted, and a parachute and supersonic inflatable\naerodynamic decelerators development tests were conducted at China Lake.\n(8) MEDLI: Turbulent flow duct arcjet testing was completed at NASA Ames Research Center and the draft of\na NASA Technical Memorandum was delivered.\n(9) SEP: Ambient and hot/cold thermal vacuum deployment testing of MegaFlex and ROSA (Roll Our Solar\nArray) solar arrays was completed. The fabrication and\nintegration of a 12.5-kW class Hall Thruster and integration and test of a 300 V power processing unit was\ncompleted.\n(10) SSD: Manual deployment of a full-size sail quadrant was completed for this project.\n(11) THOR: This project was initiated in 2014 and TIG\nhas conducted a review of proposed L1 requirements.\n\n'
