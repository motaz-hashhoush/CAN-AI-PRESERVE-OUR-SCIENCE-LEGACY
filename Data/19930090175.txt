A graphical method is presented for simple\nvisualization of attack situations. By means of diagrams showing vecy\ntoring limits, that is, the ranges of interceptor position and heading\nfrom which attacks may be successfully completed, the relative hnportance\nof rolling performance and normal-acceleration capability in determining\nthe success of attacks is illustrated. The results indicate that the\nreduction in success of attacks due to reduced rolling performance\n(within the limits generally acceptable from the pilots \xe2\x80\x98 standpoint) is\nvery small, whereas the benefits due to substantially increasing the\nnormal-acceleration capability are large.\nAdditional brief ana2y6es show that the optimum speed for initialing\na head-on attack is often that corresponding to the upper left-hsnd corner of the V-g diagram.=,\n.,Inthese cases, increasing speed beyond this\npoint for given values of normal acceleration and radar range rapidly\ndecreases the width of the region from which successful attacks can be\ninitiated. On the other land, if the radsr range is increased with a\nvsriation somewhere between the first snd second power of the titerceptor speed, the linear dimensions of the region from which successful\nattacks can be initiated vary as the square of the interceptor speed.\n\n.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n0\n.\n\nThe present roll requirements for fighter airplsnes are based\nlargely on pilots\xe2\x80\x99 opinions of the rolling abi-lityrequired for normal\nflying and maneuvering. h a attempt to relate the requirements more\nclosely to tactical.needs, flight snd snal@ical studies were conducted\n*Title, Unclassified.\n-&?!$%\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\n*\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n,\n\n.\n\nNACA RM L5~27\n\n2\n\npreviously to determine the roll requirements for pursuit-type tracking\nand for evasive action (ref. 1). Many present and proposed interceptors,\nhowever, do not use pursuit-t~e tactics, but, instesd, use a co3.lisioncourse attack which is better suited for firing rockets or missiles. An\nanalysis of the roll requirements for these tactics was therefore considered desirable.\nDetailed analyses (for example, those summarized in ref. 2) have\nbeen made in the past in order to obtain opthrmm interceptor systems\nutilizing collision-course attacks. These analyses have concentrated\nprimarily on the design of the fire-control equipment rather than on\nthe design of the interceptor. For this reason little information is\navailable to evaluate the importance of roll performance on the effectiveness of an interceptor. In the present report, calculations are\npresented to show the relative effects of wide variations in the roll\nperformance and normal-acceleration capability.

In this reference a simple geometric approach was employed.\nThis method was considered justified by comparison with results obtained\nin more exact simulations of the problem. Most of the relations employed\nin this section of the mresent report follow the method of analysis used\nin &ference 3. For co~leteness~ a derivation of these relations is\ngiven herein.\nThe flight path assumed for the interceptor is shown in figure 1.\nIn the attack, which is assumed to take place in a horizontal plane,\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNACA RM L@32T\n\nthe target is detected by the radar of the fighter at the rsmge R. In\npractice this distance R is not ftied but has a certain probability\ndistribution. For the present purpose, however, a fixed average value\nwill be assumed. After the tsrrgetis detected, the fighter centties\ninclude lag in the\non a straight coume for a distance 21, which ~\naction of the fire-control system of the fighter and the\xe2\x80\x9dtime required\nfor the fighter to roll. The fighter then enters a steady turn which\nis assued to take place at constant speed. The fighter recovers from\nthe turn smd flies straight for a distance 22 on a lead-collision\ncourse appropriate to the conditions of the problem. The missiles are\nthen launched and travel the remaining distance 1> to the collision\npoint . No evasim action on the psrt of the target is considered.\nFor any given initial conditions some optimum heading $C for the\nfighter exists which places the fighter on the desired lead-collision\ncourse. If the fighter is not initially on this desired course, the\ndirection of turn required is determined by a comp=ison of the existing\nheading and the optimum heading. From the geometry of the problem and\nfrom the lmowledge that the time reqtied for the missiles to reach the\ncollision point must equal the time required for the tsxget to reach\nthis point, the following relations may be derived with the aid of\nfigure 1:\n\nR \xe2\x80\x98in e=P2 \xe2\x80\x98+ti \xe2\x80\x98 + \xe2\x80\x98-(WC\n+\n- \xe2\x80\x98)r(cos Cos + \xe2\x80\x981 \xe2\x80\x98b\ny- \xe2\x80\x98)\nRcose-\n\n22 + 23)COS y - Sgn($c\n\nsgn(*c - *)r(~-\n\n*) + 21+ 12\n\n- *)r(sin 7 - sin W) - 21 cos v\n\nv\n=\n\n23\n+\xe2\x80\x94\n\nwhere sgn denotes the algebraic sign of a quantity.

This method\nis illustrated in figuxe 2. In this method a paper tape is marked off\nto a convenient scale to represent the distance in miles traveled by the\nfighter. A similar tape is marked off at intervals corresponding to the\ndistance traveled by the target in the time required for the fighter to\ntravel 1 mile. A series of circular disks are constructed with radii\ncorresponding to the radii of turn of the fighter at various values of\nnormal acceleration. In order to represent the flight path corresponding\nto desired initi@ conditions, the zero of the fighter tape is placed at\nthe initial.\npoint and its direction is taken as the initial heading of\nto this path at the point\nthe fighter path. The disk is placed @gent\nat which the fighter starts to,turn toward the target. The fighter tape\nis wrapped around the disk and extended over the path of the t@rget until\nthe numbers on the fighter and target tapes are equal. This condition\nthen represents the geometric layout of a collision course. The exmple\nshown in figure 2 does not include the effect of missile firing. This\neffect may be.accounted for, however> by causfig the fi@ter ~d target\n\n1\n\nNACARM\n\nL58E27\n\n9\n\n.\n.\n\ntapes to inte$sect at a point at which the number on the fighter tape\nexceeds the number on the target tape by a given value, rather than at\na point with equal values of these numbers. The given difference represents the distance that the missile is ahead of the fighter at the time\nof impact. By suitable procedures, evasive action of ;he tsrget or\nerrors in the flight path of the fighter may be simulated. The method\nbecomes inconvenient, however, if it is desired to take into account\nspeed changes of the fighter.\n\nDetermination of Point for Effective Start\nof Constsnt-Redius Turn\n\n.\n.\n\nThe preceding methds of analysis have assumed that the fighter\ninstantaneously enters a constant-radius turn, whereas in practice a\nfinite time is required to reach this condition. The point at which\nthe fighter may be considered to enter a constant-radius turn depends\nupon both the rate of roll snd the manner in which the normal acceleration is applied. During the roll some latera3 displacement of the flight\npath will occur before a steady angle of bank is reached. Inasmuch as\none objective of this snal.ysisis to study the effects of rate of roll\non the interception problem, it is desired to establish approximately\nthe point in the roll at which the effectiw stat of a constsmt-g turn\noccurs for vsrious manners of coordination of the normal acceleration\nwith the roll angle. For this analysis the angle of bank is assumed to\nvery, as shown h figure s(a), from zero to a steady value do in the\ntime To, in accordance with the formula:\n\n(3\nThis formula is arbitrarily chosen for convenience inasmuch as variations in piloting technique would result in different forms for the\nvariation of bsnk angle. Three possible types of variation of normal\nacceleration which may be considered to represent extremes likely to\nbe encountered in practice sre shown in figure a(b). These variations\nare as follows:\nCase 1. Pulling up to the value of normal acceleration required\nin the steady turn before starting the roll\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCase 2. Increasing the normal acceleration as a function of angle\nof\xe2\x80\x9dbank as required for a coordinated turn entry (vertical.component of acceleration equals 1 g)\n.*.\n*.\n\n10\n\nNACA m @E27\nCase 3.\n\nMaintaining a normal acceleration of 1 g during the roll,\nthen pulling up to the value required in a steady turn at the\nthne the rolJ_is completed\n\nFor these three conditions the variations of the lateral component of\nacceleration, given by the formula at = an sin ~, have been plotted for\nvarious values of the final normal acceleration. These variations are\nillustrated for a 2g turn in figure 3(c).\nThe effective start of the\nturn was assumed to occur at the point at which-the steady final acceleration would have to be applied to give the seinelateral.velocity at\ntime To as that obtained by integrating the lateral acceleration.\nThus, if TI is the time to the effective start of the turn,\np To\n\nTo\n\naz,mTo\n\nThe path obtained by drawing a curve of constant radius tangent to the\noriginal line of flight at time Tl is not exactly equivalent to the\ntrue path of the fighter inasmuch as the turn folJoting a gradud. buildup\nof lateral acceleration is displaced laterally from the original line of\nflight. This difference is of small importance in problems involving\nhigh-speed aircraft, however. Thus, in a kg turn entered in 2 seconds\nthe lateral displacement of the true path from the assumed path would\nbe 26.8 feet. This distance is sma~-compared with other d-tiensions\ninvolved in the msneuver. For example, the distance traveled during\nthe ttin entry would be 1,940 feet at a Mach number of 1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nVsriables Influencing Success of Attack\nIn order to appreciate the interception problems under discussion,\na visualization of the geometry of some of the attack situations is\ndesirable. Such a visualization for a wide variety of cases may be\nobtained by the analog method discussed previously. The effects of\ncertain variables to be discussed are illustrated for a few cases in\nfigure 4. In this and in succeeding figures, speed of the airplanes is\nexpressed as Mach number based on a speed of sound of 971 feet per second (corresponding to stand=d atmospheric conditions between 35,\xe2\x80\x99310\nand 80,0W feet). Inasmuch as the gemnetry of the attack situations is\na function of true speed, the Mach number given should be interpreted\nas a measure of true speed. A successful attack is illustrated in\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNACA RM L@32T\n\nxfr@@=@i$\nq\n\n\xe2\x80\x99.,\n\n- *==.\n,\n.-. W.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\n\n.. fj+.;, .\n\n11.\n\n.-\n\nfigure 4(a). In this case, the attacker has been vectored by ground\ncontrol to a point at which it is able to pick up end lock on the target\nwith its own radax. Though the initisl heading of the attacker is not\nthe optimum, it is able, by entering a turn, to reach a collision course\nin time to launch its missiles. Furthermore, the other conditions\ndescribed in the section \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis\xe2\x80\x9d for a successful attack are met.\nThat is, the look angles remain reasonable throughout the encounter,\nand the augle of the final collision course is not too close to the tail\ncone of the tsrget.\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n\nThe effect of ficreasing the radius of turn of the fighter (by use\nof a lower-g turn) while keeping other factors constant is shown in figure l(b). The increased-radius turn results in slightly greater target\npenetration and a smaller angle off the tail cone of the tsrget, but\nthe attack is still successful. A further increase in radius of turn,\nhowever, as shown in figure 4(c), allows the target to pass the attacker\nbefore a collision course can be established. h this example the initial conditions lie outside the maneuverability Mnits (eqs. (3)).\nIf\nthe attacker is assmed to have a speed advantage, the attack could be\ncontinued only as a tall chase or as a new encounter with large target\npenetration. In many cases of this type, the look angle of the radsr\nwould be exceeded and dependence on ground vectoring would be renewed.\nThis encounter is therefore considered unsuccessful.\n.\nThe effect of delaying the tiitial turn is shown in figure k(d).\nSuch a delay might result, in psrt, from time required for the attacker\nto roll. In the case shown, the attack is still successful but results\nin slightly greater taget penetration. Further large increases in the\ndelay the would result in an unsuccessful attack. The effect of differences in time to roll out of the turn have not been considered in\nsubsequent calculations because the roll out of the turn could be stsrted\nbefore reaching the final collision-course path and could be performed\ngradually with very little effect on the geometry of the problem.\nFkom the fore oimg considerations and from the formulas presented\ns\nin the section on Analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d factors governhg the success of an attack\nmay be seen to be the ratio of radar rsmge to radius of t~n of the\nattacker, the ratio of target speed to attacker speed, the initial position and hesiitigof the attacker with respect to the target path, the\nallowable singleoff the tail cone of the tsrget, the time required to\nenter a turn following radar acquisition, and the range at which the\nmissiles must be released b order for the attacker to break away and\nevade the explosion or debris resulting from a hit. ~ the present\nanalysis, this range has been assumed to be short as compsred with other\ndimensions of the problem, a condition applicable with conventional\nrockets having low explosive energy. If weapons of much greater explosive energy were considered, this factor would require further\nconsideration.\n\n12\n\nhi-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nNACA RM L5~27\n.\n\nEffect of Ro31ing Performance on Success of Attack\nEffect of roll rate and acceleration on time to bank.- Roll requirements in the preseritmilitary specification for handling qualities of\nfighter airplanes in the high-speed condition are expressed in terms of\nthe time to roll.through 100\xc2\xb0 (ref. 4). This method of stating the\nrequirements has the advantages of providing a convenient and reproducible measuring technique and of combining the influences of maximum\nrolling acceleration and msximum rolling velocity in about the ssme way\nh order to relate the\nthat they enter in actual tactical.\nmaneuvers.\nspecified performance to problems of airplane design, however, it is\ndestrable to relate the time to roll through a given angle to the maximum rolling acceleration and msximum rolling velocity produced by the\nailerons. Figure ~ shows this relation. The curves of this figure were\ncalculated by the method described in reference 1, which is based on the\nassumption that the rolling response of the airplane may be represented\nas that of a system of one degree of freedom with inertia and damping.\n-41X\n.\nT =\nThe values of the the COIHtWIt in roll T are also shown\nCzppvb%\n()\nThe curves of figure ~ show that lerge changes in msximum rolling acceleration and maximum rolling velocity are required to produce relatively small\nchanges in the time to roll through 100\xc2\xb0. For example, with a typical\nvalue of T of 0.6 second, an increase of aileron effectiveness of\n60 percent would be required to reduce the time to roll.through 100\xc2\xb0\nfrom 1.0 second to 0.75 second.\nPetit of effective start of constant-redius turn.- When the attacking\nairplane detects a target and rolls into a turn to make an attack, the\nimportant delay is the time required to start curving the flight path\nrather than the time required to roll. This delay is a function not\nonly of rolling performance but also of the manner of coordinating normal acceleration with bank angle dur~\nthe turn entry. By the method\ndescribed in the section on \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis, the ratio of the time to the\neffective start of a constant-radius turn to the time required to reach\na steady bank angle has been calculated for three types of variation of\nnormal acceleration with bank angle. These results =e shown in figure 6. This figure shows a marked decrease in the time to enter a turn\nwhen the normal acceleration is applied at the start of the maneuver\nrather than after reaching a steady bank angle. The case of a coordinated turn entry gives intermediate values of delay. The case of the\ncoordinated turn entry has been used in the subsequent calculations as\nan average representation of pilot technique for purposes of studying\nthe effects of rolling performance. The results shown in figure 6 indicate, however, that the normal acceleration should be applied as rapidly\nas possible when rolling into a turn.

For a given value of the radar range R, these variables completely define the tiitial attack situation. The effect of sny design\nvariable on the success of the attack may be Judged by its effect in\nbroadening or nsrrowing the region in a plot of V against e for\nwhich successful attacks are possible.\nThe various boundaries lhiting the success of the attack sre\ndescribed in the section on \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis\xe2\x80\x9d as look-angle lhits, maneuverability limits, and vulnerability limits. Although the look-angle\nlimits may be calculated very simply, the other limits require the\nsolution of transcendental equations. These eqyations were solved\nnumerically by a method of successive approximations using a csrdprogrsmed digital computer.\nBecause of the large number of variables involved in the attack\nequations, a large number of solutions would be required to provide a\nsurvey of the effects of all the variables. A number of such solutions\nare presented in reference 3. In the present analysis, a set of results\nmore accurate than could be obtained by resilingvalues from the curves\nof reference 3 was desired. For this reason, solutions were csrried out\nfor a stigle set of conditions given in table I. The Mach number of the\ntarget was taken as 1.0 snd that of the attacker as 1.5. The variables\nconsidered were the normal-acceleration capability of the attacker (2\nto 6g) and the thne (or distance 21) required to pull into the initial\nturn.\nSince the method of computing the times required to pull into the\ninitial turn is somewhat arbitrary, it is now described. These times\nwere based on three conditions, namely: instantaneous turn entry, turn\nentry with the to roll corresponding to the requirement of 1 second to\nroll through 100\xc2\xb0, and turn entry with time to roll corresponding to a\nmuch reduced requirement of 4 seconds to roll through 100\xc2\xb0. The correspond@g rollhg performsmce, determhed from figure 5 and from the\nmethods of reference 1, is as\xe2\x80\x9dgiven in the following table (T = 1.2 see):\n\n14\n\nr\nThe\n\nNACARM\n\nto roll through\npm~~\n100\xc2\xb0, sec\nradism/se c\no\n1\n4\n\n&X>\nradians/sec2\n\nTime to roll to and\nstop at 90\xc2\xb0 bank,\nTo, sec\n0\n1.20\n4.10\n\n4:51\n.52\n\n5%\n\nL58E27\n\nt\n\nInasmuch as the angles of bank corresponding to the values of steady\nacceleration of 2 to 6g me somewhat iess t&\n90\xc2\xb0, the times to re&ch\nthese angles were reduced from that required to roll 90\xc2\xb0. This reduction was carried out by an approximate method because the use of the\nsingle-degree-of-freedom calculations, such as those tied to determine\nthe the to roll to and stop at 90\xc2\xb0 bank, was considered more ttieconsuming than necessary. The time lxlstoryof bank angle for the 90\xc2\xb0\nbank case was assumed to be given by the sine-sqpared variation used in\nequation (5) with the value of To given in the preceding table. The\ntime histories of bank angle for the cases of smaller bank angles were\nobtained by assuming the the history h each case to be identical with\nthat of the 90\xc2\xb0 bank case up to one-half of the final-bank single. The\ntime to reach this point was then doubled to obtain the time to reach\nthe f3nal bank angle. This procedure, in effect, assumes that the initial rolling acceleration remains the same in each case. The times to\nthe effective start of the stesdy turns were then determined by multiplying these times by the factor, determined frcm figure 6, to take into\naccount the buildup of acceleration in a coordinated turn entry.

For each condition, the region enclosed by the\nlimiting boundaries is the region of successful attacks. The boundaries\nme antisymmetrical about the axes of v and e. For this reuon~ the\ncurves on one side of the axes have been cut off in order to permit a\nlarger scale for the remainder of the figure. The look-agle limits\nhowever,\nare shown only for k\n= 900. For any other value of k,\nthe look-angle limits would be straight 45\xc2\xb0 Ities passing through the\nvalue of ha\non the W-axis.\n\n.\n.\n\nDiscussion of factors influencing choice of rolling performance.The data of figure 7 show that the variations in normal-acceleration\ncapability, ov& the range presented, have a much greater influence on\nthe success of the attacks thsm the variations in rolling characteristics. The case of very low rolXng performance (100\xc2\xb0 in 4 seconds)\nwas chosen primarily to produce enough change in the vectoring limits\nto be clesrly visible in figure 7. Such low rolling performance in a\nfighter would be entirely unsatisfactory from the pilots\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint.\nThe choice of rolltig performance to be provided in a fighter airplane is difficult because many desirable features may need to be compromised to satisfy the pilots\xe2\x80\x9d preference for high rolling performance.\nFor example, the problem of roll coupling may require increases h\nvertical-tail size, structural beef-up, or the provision of automatic\ncontrol systems. Conflicting requirements may exist between ailerons\nand high-lift devices. Provision of high rolling performance at high\nvalues of dynsmic pressure may require special types of ailerons} such\nas spoilers, which complicate the lateral-control system sad which may\nbe less satisfactory than other designs in fuht\nregimes such as landing\napproach or spin recovery. For this reason, the actual-tmtic~\nbenefits\nto be derived from high rolling performance should be closely exsmined.\nFor the collision-course attack situa\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99ionconsidered herein, it is\nevident from the vectorhg limits plotted in figure 7 that if the rolling\nperformance must be reduced as a result of design problems such as rolJ\ncoupling, conflict with high-lift devicesy and so forth, only a slight\nreduction in the probability of successful attacks is to be expected.\nOn the other hand, any aerodynamic feature that results in a substantial\nincrease in normal-acceleration capability has a marked beneficial effect\non the success of attacks. Every effort, therefore, should be made to\nimprove the normal-acceleration capability of interceptors.\n\n*\n\nThe success of attacks has been shown to increase with normalacceleration capability and with rolling performance. Increasing the\nrolling performance, however, usually requires some increase in structural weight which, if other factors am held constant, reduces the\n\n,\n\n16\n\nNACA FM L5@2T\n\nnormal-acceleration capability. For this restricted situation, then,\nthe determination of an optimum rolling performance shotid be possible.\nAn attempt has been made to carry out such an analysis for the conditions\nconsidered in figure 7. This analysis applies only at high altitudes\nwhere the maximum normal acceleration is limited by lift coefficient.\nAs shown h figure 7, the radsr look sngle becomes an important factor\nin determining the success of attacks at the higher values,of normal\nacceleration. The analysis is therefore applicable at values of normal\nacceleration below about kg, where the normal acceleration and rolling\nperformance are the factors primarily influencing the success of attacks.\nIn order to optimalize the rolling performance, a measure of the\nsuccess of the attack in terms of the vectoring Lbnits is required. As\nshown in figure 7, the changes in vectoring limits caused by changes in\nthe variables an and TIOO are fatily uniform throughout the range of\nvalues of $ end e (except nesx the values corresponding to the idesl\ncollision course, where no maneuvering is required to intercept the\ntarget). For this reason, increments of e at W = O have been selected as representative of the changes caused by roll performance and\nacceleration capability. Stice the weight is assumed to vary as a function of roll performance, the optimum aileron power may_be obtained by\nsatisfy- the relation\nde=o\ndw\n\n(6)\n\nThe increments of e sre attributed to changes in aileron power, as\nmeasured by the time to roll through 100\xc2\xb0 Tloo smd to changes in msxiEquation (6) may therefore be expressed:\nmum normal acceleration ~.\n\n+M%=o\n\xe2\x80\x94.\n\nh%\n\n(7)\n\ndw\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nfractional rather than\nBy dividing the denordnator by the we~t,\nabsolute changes in weight are conside;ed~ This procedure is used to\nmake the results more generally applicable to airplanes of various\nweights.

First, consider the terms ae/a~oo\nand aO/a%. The\nincrements of e at ~ = O were determined from the data of figure 7\nand plotted as functions of TIW\nand of an, and the slopes were\ndetermined graphical.\nThough figure 7 is plotted to a scale too small\nto allow incremental changes h\ne to be measured accurately, the original digital-computer solutions provide adequate accuracy. The slope\naO/?%CIOO was found to remain fairly constant at values of normal acceleration of 3g and greater. This value was taken as -1.8\xc2\xb0 per second.\n\xe2\x80\x98Theslope aeia% ww tsken as 15.10 per g.\n%\n\xe2\x80\x94\nthe variation of maximum normal acceleration with\ndw/w\xe2\x80\x99\nfractional increase in gross weight, is simply equal to -an,=\nat\naltitudes for which the maximum normal acceleration is limited by lift\ncoefficient. A value of 3g was assumed for ~,-.\nThe term\n\n.\n.\n\nFinally, the term\n\nd%oo\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\nis considered. Jh general, improvement\ndw/w\nin rolling performance is sought by ticreastig the rolling moment applied\nto the airplane. This chsnge ,yaybe accomplished by increasing the\naileron size or deflection rsnge, by adding auxiliary control surfaces\nsuch as spoilers, or by stiffening the wing structure to avoid adverse\naeroelastic effects. The increased rolling moment does not chsnge the\ntime constant in rolJ 7. The weight ticrement due to the change, however, is likely to be added in the wings and therefore increases the\nmoment of inertia in roll. The effect of increased inertia is to increase\nthe time constsnt T without &anging the maxhmmn rolling velocity. A\nchange in wing stiffness might also affect the damping in roll and thereby\nchange T, but this effect is neglected in the subsequent analysis.\n\nIn order to determine\n\n%00\n\nthe effects of the increased rolling\nm\nmoment and the increased time constant sre considered separately snd\nadded.

Two values have been assumed for\nthis psrsmeter, O and 10. The value of O corresponds to the case h\nwhich all the added weight is in the fuselage, as might occur if the\naileron actuator power were increased. The value of 10 corresponds to\na case in which aXl the added weight is near the whg tips, as might\noccur with increased aileron size, increase in wing stiffness, and so\nforth. Detailed knowledge of the airplane design would be required to\ndetermine the actual value to be used in a particular case. The values\nassumed, however, probably bracket the values likely to be encountered\nin practice.\nThe qusntity\n\nThe results of this analysis me\n\nshown in figure 8 as plots of the\nd&/&\n~or\noptinnm time to roll through lCX)Oas a function of\n&w/w\nthree values of\n\nT.\n\nFigure 8(a) shows the case for\n\ndT T\n= O\ndw\n+ W\n\nand fig-\n\ndT/T _ lo\nThe interpretation of these\ndw/w\n\xe2\x80\x9c\nfigures is as follows: If sn increment of rolling velocity is costly\nd~/&\nin terms of weight low value of\n, the opttiumrollhg\nperdw/w\n(\n)\nfo~ce\nis low, whereas if an increment of rolMnn velocity is obtaind&/ti\nable with little weight penalty high value of\n, the optimm\ndw/w\n)\n(\nrolltig performance is high.

This value would\ngenerally place the optimum rolling performance higher than the requirement of 1 second to roll through 100\xc2\xb0.\nThe weight penalty involved in increasing rolling performance at\nhigh altitude actually may not provide a valid measure of the price to\nbe paid for increased rolling performance. In fact, increased rolling\nvelocity at high altitude might be possible with little or no increase\nin weight, because the structure, designed for higher loading conditions\nat low altitude, would already be strong enough to withstand increased\naileron loads. In practice, the aileron loads become critical at low\naltitude, where increased wing stiffness must be provided to avoid aileron\nreversal. At low altitude, however, the increased weight does not reduce\nthe normal-acceleration capability, which is fixed at the specified limit\nload factor. The increased weight would reduce the acceleration capability\nat high altitude. Uhder these conditions, the foregoing analysis would\nnot apply. Some relative importmce would have to be assigned to the\nsuccess of attacks at low and high altitude h order to arrive at a\ndecision as to the optimum rolling performance.\nFurther consideration would have to be given to the effect of\nincreased weight on range, payload, or other performance items in order\nto evaluate fully the effect of an increase in rolling ability. These\nfactors are mentioned simply to emphasize further that a limited analysis\nsuch as that described herein cannot give a complete answer to the problem of optimum aileron effectiveness. In view of the complicated nature\nof the problem and the need for knowledge of the design considerations\nof an individual airplane, the results of the foregoing analysis should\nnot be applied quantitatively. The method used, however, may serve as\na guide for similsr analyses of problems hv.mlving tactical considerations.\nb the preceding analysis, no consideration h= been given to the\neffects of evasim action of the tsrget. For collision-course attacks\nin which a side approach is used, little rolling on the part of the\nattacker would be required to counter target maneuvers. In tail-chase\napproaches, the requirements would be similsx to those for pursuit-type\nattacks discussed in reference 1. This type of approach, however, is\nnot likely to be used because it fails to tsk.eadvantage of the benefits\nof the collision-course attack in reducing the effectiveness of tail\ndefense weapons of the target. The case of a head-on approach requires\ntither analysis. Preltiinary considerations indicate, however, that\nthe relative importance of rolling performance and normal-acceleration\ncapability for this case would be shilsr to that determined by neglecting\nevasive action by the target.\n\nNACA RM L5&E27\n\n21\n\nEffect of Interceptor Speed snd Radar Range\non Success of Attack\nThe preceding analysis has shown the relative importance of roll\nperformance end normal-acceleration capability on the success of attacks.\nThe equations presented in the section on \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis\xe2\x80\x9d show, however, that\ninterceptor speed and rsdsr range sre also important variables h determining the success of attacks. For this reason, limited analyses have\nbeen made to show some of the effects of these vsxiabks.\nEffect of interceptor speed.- A complete snalysis of the effect of\na vsriable such as interceptor speed would require the calculation of\nvectoring Mmits, such as those given in figure ~, for a range of values\nof interceptor speed. In order to simplify the calculations, the present analysis has been restricted to the caae of head-on attacks ($ = o)\nwith various values of lateral displacement (sometimes called offset)\nof the flight paths of the attacker snd target. The effect of missik\nfiring was omitted from these calculations because, for the short-range\nmissiles assumed previously, the effect of the missiles on the geometry\nof the interceptions was sma13. The minimum sngle of the attacker from\nthe target path was sgaim assumed to be X\xe2\x80\x9c.\nThe msximw lateral displacement from which an attack can be successfully completed is shown\nas a function of attacker Mach numiberfor a typical case in figure 9.\nThe conditions assumed are as given in table II. The curves were calculated with the aid of equations (3) and (4).\nThe results show that the allowable latera3 displacement increases\nto a maximum at a particular value of attacker speed and decreases with\nfurther ticrease in speed. The optimum speed is generally that at which\na transition occurs from msneuvers limited by the maximum usable normalforce coefficient to those lhited by the msximun allowable acceleration.\nIn other words, the optimum speed is that corresponding to the upper\nleft-hand corner of the V-g diagrsm. This condition might not always\napply, as shown by the curve for cN,max = 1.0, for which a slightly\nhigher speed is seen to be beneficial. The peak of the cwve of lateral\ndisplacement as a function of attacker Mach number fa the case of constsnt normal acceleration occurs at progressively higher values of Mach\nnumber as the radar range is increased. Also, the speed corresponding\nto the upper left-hand corner of the V-g disgrsm is reduced at low\naltitude. M cases of long rsdar range or low altitude, therefore, the\nmax3mum petit of the curve of later~ displacement sgainst Mach number\nis ltiel.yto occur at a Mach number higher thsn the speed corresponding\nto the upper left-hand corner of the V-g &l@ymm.\nUnfortunately, because\nof the complication of the equations, no simple expression cen be derived\nfor the speed at which this maximLmlpobt occurs. A number of solutions\nof equation (4) would be required to plot the curve for each case of\ninterest aa was done b preparing figure,9.\n\n22\n\nl!JACAM L58E2\xe2\x80\x997\nR\n\nIn order to avoid long exposure to the defensive srmament of the\ntarget and also to avoid large look angles during the latter stages of\nthe attack, a reasonable margin of speed of the attacker over the target\nwould appear desirable. Therefore, in the absence of a complete analysis\nof the optimum attack speed in a head-on attack, a reasonable rule appears\nto be to make the attack at a speed corresponding to the upper left-hand\ncorner of the V-g disgrsm qnless this speed is less than the target speed,\nin which case a speed higher than the target speed should be used. If\nthe altitude is so high that the speed corresponding to the upper lefthand corner of the V-g diagram cannot be reached, the attack should be\nmade at the highest speed possible. These calculations were made on the\nassumption of constant attacker speed. If slowdown occurred during the\nattack, approximate compensation for this variation could be made by\nstarting the attack at a somewhat higher speed, so that the average\nspeed during the attack would correspond to the calculated value.\nThe foregoing example, as mentioned previously, is limited to the\ncase of head-on attacks. The optimum attack speeds would not be expected\nto differ greatly for small deviations from the head-on attack situation.\nFor the case of arbitrary initial heading, however, the solution is much\nmore complicated. The optimum attack speed would be different for paths\ndisplaced to the left or right of the desired collision-course path.\nFurther investigation is required to study this general problem.\n\n.\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\nEffect of radar rauge.- Incre~img the radar range of the attacker\nis always beneficial in that it increases the area from which successful\nattacks are possible. An optimum radar range cannot be determined,\ntherefore, without conslder~ adverse effects of a lager radar on the\nspeed or range of the interceptor. These considerations are beyond the\nscope of this report. A simple example can be given, however, to show\nhow the radar range should increase with interceptor speed in order to\nallow runs requiring geometrically similar maneuvers on the part of the\ninterceptor. The ability to perform such similar runs would seem desirable in order to take full advantage of increased speed capabilities of\nan interceptor. An increase in speed alone, without an increase in radar\nrange, is shown in figure 9 to be undesirable because the region for\ninitiation of successful head-on attacks at given values of normal acceleration end radax range decreases rapidly with increasing interceptor\nspeed.\nA typical attack situation in which the interceptor is initially\nin a somewhat unfavorable position is shown in figure 10. The required\nratio of radar range to radius of turn of the attacker is plotted as\na function of the ratio of target speed to attacker speed.

The linesr &bnensions of the region from which successful attacks\nreqpi-\xe2\x80\x9dinggeometrically sbXiar maneuvers of the attacker can be started\nVWJ as the sqme\nof the attacker speed. hcreased attacker speed is\nTherefOre highly beneficial if it is accompanied by increased radsr\nrange to the extent indicated by equation (10).\nCONCLUDING REMARIB\n\nfi the analysis of this report, a attempt has been made to determine the relative importance of rolling performance snd certain other\nfactors in the design of an interceptor which uses collision-course\ntactics. A graphical method is presented for simple visualization of\nattack situations.\nBy mesns of disgrams showing vectorlimits, that is, the ranges\nof interceptor position snd heading from which attacks may be successcqleted, the relative importance of rolling performance and\nnormal-acceleration capability in determining the success of attacks\nis illustrated. h order to determine the optimum rolMng performance,\nan attempt is made to balance the adverse effects of the weight penalty\ndue to the ailerons against the benefits due to imcreased rolling performance. This analysis indicates that a high rolling performance is\nmost favorable. This snalysis, however, neglects many practical considerations which may mske the provision of high rollhg effectimness\ndifficult. The vectoring 13mits indicate that the reduction in success\nof attacks due to reduced rolllnn perfromance (within limits generalJy\nacceptable from the pilots\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint) is very small, whereas the\nadvantage that may be gained by substantiddy increasing the normaJ-acceleration capability is Wge.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe analysis also indicates important effects of interceptor\nad radar rsnge on the success of attacks. The optimum speed for\ntion of a head-on attack is often that corresponding to the upper\nhand corner of the V-g diagrsm. In these cases, increasing speed\n\nspeed\ninitialeftbeyond\n\n.\n\nthis point for given values of normal acceleration and radar range\nrapidly decreases the width of the region from which successful attacks\ncan be initiated. On the other hand, if the radar range is increased\nwith a variation somewhere between the first and second power of the\ninterceptor speed, the linear dimensions of the region from which successful attacks can be initiated increase as the sqpsre of the interceptor\nspeed.\n\nLangley Aeronautical Laboratory,\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,\nLangley Field, Vs., May 16, 1958.\n\nREFERENcm\n1.
