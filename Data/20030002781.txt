b'Power\n\nSupply\n\nUnit\n\nIn electronics\nterminology,\npower processing\nis the\nuse of circuitry\nto change electric\npower from one form\nto another.\nA spacecraft,\nfor example,\nusually derives its\nelectric\npower from solar cells. This is "unregulated"\ndirect current\n(dc) power which must be processed,\nconverted\nto regulated,\nor steady, dc voltage for\n\npowering\nthe spacecraft\'s\ninstruments.\nIn the early days\nof space flight, power processing\nswitcher\nconverters\nwere heavy, cumbersome\nand inefficient\ndevices. Over\nyears of research,\nlighter switchers\nwere developed,\nbut\nthey were still not highly efficient--until\n1979, when\nCalifornia\nInstitute of Technology\nscientists\nmade an\nimportant\nbreakthrough\nin research\nsponsored\nby Lewis\nResearch\nCenter.\nThe result was the Cuk DC to DC Switching\nConverter,\ndeveloped\nby CalTech\nProfessors\nSlobodan\nCuk and\nR.D. Middlebrook.\nThe converter\nchanges\nunsuitable\ndc\nvoltage\ninto one or more voltages\nsuitable for powering\nelectronic\nequipment;\nit can also be used in converting\ndc current\nto ac and vice versa. Named one of the 100\nmost\n\nsignificant\n\ntechnical\n\nadvances\n\nof 1979, the Cuk\n\nconverter\nis expected\nto find wide applicability\nin a great\nrange of electrically-powered\nsystems because\nit is more\nefficient\nthan previous\nconversion\ndevices, simpler,\nsmaller,\nlighter,\ncheaper\nand highly\nreliable.\nThe first application\nof the technology\nis in the\nCompucorp\n685 word/data\nprocessor\npictured\nat left;\nthe processor\nis manufactured\nby Compucorp,\nSanta\nMonica,\nCalifornia.\nThe converter,\nor switcher,\nis\nshown above.\nNASA waived title rights to the technology\nto CalTech.\nCalTech granted\nan exclusive\nlicense to the inventors,\nDrs. Cuk and Middlebrook,\nwho, in turn, transferred\ntheir\nrights to a company\nthey founded\ncalled TESLAco,\nPasadena,\nCalifornia.\nTESLAco\nsublicenses\nthe\nconverter\ndesign and related technology\nto companies\nmaking power supplies\nfor use in their own products.\n87\n\n'
