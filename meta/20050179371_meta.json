Use of fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites in these applications can lead to substantial weight savings, thereby leading to improved fuel economy, increased passenger and payload capacity, and better maneuverability. PMR-15 is used fairly extensively in military and commercial aircraft engines components seeing service temperatures as high as 500 F (260 C), such as the outer bypass duct for the F-404 engine. The current world-wide market for PMR-15 materials (resins, adhesives, and composites) is on the order of $6 to 10 million annually.", "title": "\"Green\" High-Temperature Polymers", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050179371, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meador, Michael A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "32eb22876cfb47e69812f2f978cf4856"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050179371, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050179371, "id": "7a0ebe9561ca4a538e19839f05bb5816", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1997", "publicationDate": "1998-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050179371.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050179371/downloads/20050179371.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050179371/downloads/20050179371.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050179371/downloads/20050179371.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
