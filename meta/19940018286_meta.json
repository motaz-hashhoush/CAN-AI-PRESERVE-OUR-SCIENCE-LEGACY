In Europe, projections indicate a demand of about 17 million subscribers for a fully deployed Pan European system. The Pan-European GSM system is to harmonize the growth of the terrestrial mobile system. Studies conducted by the European Space Agency (ESA) indicate that even with 60-70 percent of the area being covered by the GSM, a significant traffic demand (voice and data) will still exist for areas not covered by the terrestrial systems. This demand could be satisfied by a land mobile satellite system. The satellite system is therefore seen in a complementary role rather than in competition with the terrestrial system in an integrated telecommunications network. One possible scenario may be that initially the satellite system provides services to the rural areas together with areas still not covered by the GSM system. This service area is then gradually diminished as the terrestrial system expands until an optimum point is reached where the systems co-exist optimally. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of integration of a space based system, in this case Inmarsat Standard-M, with the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications). One very important advantage of incorporating GSM services in Standard-M is that it will be feasible to extend the GSM services economically worldwide, not only to land mobiles but also to aeronautical and maritime mobiles.", "title": "Interworking and integration of the Inmarsat Standard-M with Pan-European GSM system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940018286, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tafazolli, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Surrey Univ.", "location": "Guildford, United Kingdom"}}, "id": "4869fce04d24403cbe12f03d15e4f42b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940018286, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Evans, B.
