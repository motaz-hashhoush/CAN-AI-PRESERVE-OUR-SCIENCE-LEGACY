The repulsion of like magnetic\npoles provides concentric support of the inner member\nso that no metallic contact occurs between the bearing\nsurfaces.\nHow it's done: The bearing consists of a rotating\nshaft member and a stationary housing member. The\nhousing member is a beveled permanent magnet, as is\none end of the shaft member. The magnets are arranged so that, as the shaft member is inserted in the\nhousing member, like poles of the magnets are in near\ncontact. The shaft member rotates concentrically in\nthe housing and is effectively suspended in the designed air gap by the repulsive forces of the adjacent\nbearing elements. The beveled construction of the\nmagnetic pole elements produces a large surface area\nfor the like poles and provides greater axial support\nfor the shaft than a cylindrical design. Eccentric rotation is prevented automatically by the increased repulsive force present when the air gap between the\nhousing and shaft is reduced.

By making the housing in\nthree or more segments, effective reluctance paths are\nprovided for a return force to restore concentric\nrotation.\nNotes:\nI. The magnetic portions of both shaft and housing\nare designed with long magnetic paths to provide\nhigh residual magnetism.\n2. Both ends of the magnets are used for support and\nprovide a self-centering feature.\n3. Design capability is limited to lightly loaded highspeed rotating shafts.\n4.
