These generic (coupled) models combine the deterministic models for composite load dynamic, acoustic, high-pressure and high rotational speed, etc., load simulation using statistically varying coefficients. These coefficients are then determined using advanced probabilistic simulation methods with and without strategically selected experimental data. The entire simulation process is included in a CLS computer code. Applications of the computer code to various components in conjunction with the PSAM (Probabilistic Structural Analysis Method) to perform probabilistic load evaluation and life prediction evaluations are also described to illustrate the effectiveness of the coupled model approach.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940024005, "id": "3cf0c4ab31f344c0912a9e97bfa97675", "publicationDate": "1994-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940024005.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940024005/downloads/19940024005.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940024005/downloads/19940024005.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940024005/downloads/19940024005.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
