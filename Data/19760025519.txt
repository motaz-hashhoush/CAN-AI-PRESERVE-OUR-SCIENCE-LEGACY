As depicted schematically in Figure 2.1-1,\n\nto classify each point in the data, these classifiers use a single set\n\nof features (multispectral measurements) to compute a likelihood or\n\ndiscriminant function for each class and categorize the point according\n\nto the class with the largest discriminant function value. For many\n\npractical applications, and particularly those utilizing multitemporal\n\ndata, such a simple decision procedure is often found seriously lacking\n\nin the flexibility needed to most efficiently and effectively incorporate\n\nthe multitemporal aspects of the data.\n\nAs a simple illustration, consider a situation in which data from\n\ntwo passes of a satellite are available over an area to be classified.\n\nThe conventional single-stage classifier treats the "stacked" combination\n\nof the two four-dimensional vectors (one vector from each pass) as a\n\nsingle eight-dimensional vector. If for any reason the data in one or\n\nmore of the channels is "invalid," the classifier will probably not be\n\nable to assign the data to the correct class. For example, if on either\n\ndate, the ground at a given point happens to be cloud-covered, the\n\nclassifier would not be able to correctly identify the ground cover. If\n\npass #1 has Cl percent cloud cover and pass #2 has C 2 percent, as much\n\nas C1 + C2 percent of the multitemporal data may not be classifiable.\n\nOn the other hand, a layered classifier, designed as shown in\n\nFigure 2.1-2 to make a sequence of decisions, alleviates the problem\n\nsignificantly. Using this classifier the only points which cannot be\n\nclassified at all are those obscured by clouds on both passes.\n\nThis illustration is but one representative of a wide range of\n\nclassification problems which are most effectively solved by means of\n\nlayered decision logic. Several other examples are noted below:\n\n*Multitemporal data\n\n-Training drawn from multiple areas\n\n-Change detection\n\n*Use of mixed data types\n\n-Spectralttopographic data\n\n-Spectral/textural data\n\n\n2.1-2\n\n\nunknown\n\nsample\ns\n\nd\n\nwater\n\nbare soil\n\nFigure 2.1-1\n\ncorn\n\nuse features fl,f2 ,..., fn\n\n\nwheat\n\nsoybeans\n\ntrees\n\n\nCommon single-stage classifier.\n\nC = [corn,soybeans,clouds,\n\ncloud shadows, other]\n\nflf2f3f4\n\n\nlikelihood\n\ncorn\n\ngoybeans\n\nother\n\nclouds & shadows\n\nmax.\nlikelihood\nRF\n\ncorn\n\nFigure 2.1-2\n\nsoybeans\n\nC1 = [corn,soybeans,\nother]\n= [f ,f ,f7 ,f8]\n6\n5\n2\n\nother\n\n\nAgricultural classification in the\n\npresence of clouds.\n\n\n2.1-3\n\n\n-Spectral/geophysical data\n\n*Detection of class specific properties\n\n-Crop disease detection\n\n-Forest type mapping\n\n-Water temperature mapping\n\n*Minimization of data dimensionality\n\n-Efficiency (speed) improvement\n\n-Minimization of the effects of severely limited training data\n\nWe have pursued the development of procedures for effective design and\n\nutilization of layered classifiers in order to exploit their potential\n\nfor (a) dealing with classification problems not well suited to conven\xc2\xad\ntional classifiers, (b) improving the efficiency of the classification\n\nprocess, (c) improving the accuracy of the classification process.\n\nPrevious Work at LARS\n\nThe theoretical foundations for this classification approach and\n\nfor the design of layered decision trees were developed at LARS in\n\nearlier contract years. A set of research software for both the design\n\nand implementation of layered decision logic was also developed. The\n\nfinal report for the immediately preceding contract year reported\n\nadvances in the development of both manual and automated design pro\xc2\xad\ncedures and the application of these procedures to a number of practical\n\n\nremote sensing problems. Solution of the multitemporal cloud problem\n\ndescribed above was reported and the accuracy and efficiency of layered\n\nclassifiers in remote sensing data analysis were demonstrated.\n\n\n2.1-4\n\n\nOBJECTIVES AND GOALS\n\nThe objectives of this research and development task are threefold:\n\n1. To develop an effective method for the design and realization\n\nof layered classifier logic applicable to multispectral/multitemporal\n\nremote sensing problems;\n\n2. To implement effectively the products of the development on a\n\ngeneral purpose computer in order to make them available to applications\xc2\xad\noriented research; and\n\n3. To demonstrate the effectiveness of layered decision logic in\n\nthe context of a number of current applications.\n\nThe goals of the research for this contract year focused on the\n\ndevelopment of layered classifier logic applicable to multitemporal data\n\nsets, particularly for the case in which the training data for all\n\navailable channels cannot be drawn from a single set of points (a single\n\ntraining segment). Other goals included upgrading the research software\n\nfor the layered classifier to make it LARSYS-compatible, and surveying\n\npossibilities for improving the procedures for designing optimal decision\n\ntrees. The first of these goals was principally motivated by the\n\npotential applicability of the results to LACIE. The latter goals\n\nrepresent advancements in the ongoing development of data analysis\n\ntechniques for remote sensing.\n\n\n2.1-5\n\n\nACCONPLISIMENTS\n\nA candidate strategy was formulated for the multitemporal problem\n\ninvolving training data from multiple sites. Preliminary tests of this\n\ndecision strategy were carried out using data from CITARS and LACIE, but\n\ntests adequate to provide a definitive evaluation are awaiting avail\xc2\xad\nability of suitable data sets.\n\nThe layered classifier approach was also applied to related problems,\n\nincluding change detection.\n\nSoftware for implementing layered decision logic was upgraded\n\nconsiderably and made available to users at LARS. Compilation of user\n\nand programmer documentation for this software has yet to be completed\n\nbut is well under way at this writing.\n\nThe process of designing optimal decision trees has been modeled as\n\na four-stage process involving (1) feature selection, (2) cluster\n\nanalysis, (3) specification of a classifier at each node of the tree,\n\nand (4) tree search. A research plan aimed at optimal choice of algorithms\n\nfor each of these stages has been formulated and the work has been\n\ninitiated.\n\n\n2.\n1-6\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH\n\nA.\n\nApplications of the LayeredClassifier Approach\n\n\nThe Multitemporal/Multisegment Problem\n\nOne way to state the problem is as follows:\n\nGiven three segments (ground areas) A, B and C and two satellite\n\npasses over these segments, reference data is assumed available for\n\nsegments A and B, but not for both segments at all times of interest.\n\nSegment C is to be classified using statistics from the available\n\nmultipass data from segments A and B.\n\nAssume that training data is available from segment A at time 1\n\n(but not time 2) and from segment B at time 2 (but not time 1).\nThe\n\nclassification of segment C (data available at both times 1 and 2) can\n\nbe carried out utilizing a sequential (layered) decision strategy.\n\nWe make three further assumptions:\n\n1. Segments A, B and C belong to the same spectral stratum (i.e.,\n\nsimilar ground covers in all three segments have similar spectral\n\nresponse characteristics);\n\n2. The informational classes in segment C may be assumed to be a\n\nsubset of the union of the classes in segments A and B;\n\n3. No dramatic changes occur in climatic conditions during the\n\nacquisition of data which would cause the time 1 data for segment C to\n\ndiffer in spectral character from the time 1 data for segment A; and\n\n.similarly for the time 2 data with regard to segments C and B.\n\nThe analysis strategy is as follows: Training is performed on the\n\ncloud-free passes of segment A and B utilizing the available ground\n\ntruth. (Even if several cloud-free passes should be available, train\xc2\xad\ning is performed for each pass individually.) All spectral classes are\n\ninvestigated for separability and classes that are not separable are\n\neither deleted if determined to be unimportant or else combined,\n\nresulting in "mixture classes" in those cases in which the spectral\n\nclasses were derived from different cover types. It is then decided\n\nwhich date (satellite pass) will serve as the base date to provide the\n\ninitial stages of the classification logic. For classification of\n\nagricultural scenes, it is often most logical to use as the base date\n\nthe data from the date at which the crops of interest are most discrimin\xc2\xad\nable. The stages of the decision tree for this data are then designed\n\nusing the Optimal Decision Tree Design procedure. Terminal nodes of\n\nthis treewhich represent mixture classes are replaced by small subtrees\n\nwhich use data from a date other than the base date, if possible, to\n\nresolve the mixture into individual classes. The tree thus assembled is\n\nused in the classification of segment C.\n\n\n2.1-7\n\n\nThere are a number of practical difficulties associated with this\n\nstrategy, some of a minor technical nature, some more serious and funda\xc2\xad\nmental. A minor problem is that the total number of spectral.classes\n\ninvolved for a given case equals the sum of the number of classes\n\nobtained for each pass. This number can be very large and the software\n\nmust be designed to handle both the volume and the considerable amount\n\nof "bookkeeping" involved with the classes and their associated statistics.\n\nA more fundamental problem is that this procedure-does not allow for\n\nexplicit interaction among the data from different times. That is, the\n\ntraining statistics used at any decision node must be drawn from a\n\nsingle time/segment and any interactions between times which might\n\nimprove the classification accuracy cannot be used to advantage. This\n\nrestriction arises from the fact that a simple correspondence between\n\nclasses in different segments (or even the same segment at different\n\ntimes) cannot be routinely established. We do not at this time have a\n\npractical solution to this problem implemented.\n\n\n2.1-8\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nThe data chosen for the analysis described below consisted of three\n\nmultitemporal data sets assembled for LACIE. The data were collected\n\nduring early 1974 over the Intensive Test Sites in Finney, Morton and\n\nEllis Counties, Kansas. A map of the state of Kansas shows the position\n\nof the three counties relative to each other (Figure 2.1-3). The\n\navailable dates and corresponding channel numbers-in the overlaid data\n\nset are given in Table 2.1-1. Reference data for the three segments\n\nwere available in the form of aircraft photography- at a scale of\n\n1:24000 taken in June 1974 and plastic overlays containing field\n\nboundaries and field numbers for each test site. A listing of the\n\ncover type for each field was available from field visitation reports.\n\nUnfortunately, the ground truth for Finney County was assembled prior to\n\nthe time that the Intensive Test Site was moved southward because of an\n\natypically large number of irrigated fields. Therefore, only ground\n\nobservations about the southern part of the original test site could be\n\nused. It was decided that Finney and Ellis would be used as training\n\nsegments "A\' and "B," respectively, and Morton would serve as segment\n\n"C," the segment to be classified.\n\nIn order to ease the burden of manually picking training and test\n\nfields using the overlays, the three sites were geometrically corrected\n\nand scaled to 1:24000 for line printer output.\n\nAs information about spectral strata concerning these three sites\n\nwas not available, grayscale prints and color composites were studied.\n\nThe sites are approximately 130km (80mi) from each other and one might\n\nsuspect that they would not belong to the same stratum. The color\n\ncomposites showed for all three available common dates that there were\n\nsignificant differences in spectral response. Channel 3 for each of\n\nthe segments in each date is shown in Figure 2.1-4 (a-i). These also\n\nreveal large differences from segment to segment at each time. Channel\n\nmeans and variances are given in Table 2.1-2.\n\nBased on these observations, it was clear that these three segments\n\ncould not be considered to belong to a single spectral stratum, thereby\n\nviolating one of the basic assumptions of our present approach. However,\n\nsince these were the only data.available to us with reference data and\n\nappropriately related with respiect to timing of the respective satellite\n\npasses, we decided to press ahead with the analysis to see what could\n\nbe determined.\n\nTraining and test fields were selected on a random basis for each\n\nsegment, allocating roughly twice as many fields for testing as for\n\ntraining. To provide a basis for evaluating the layered classification\n\nresults, each segment was classified by a single-stage classifier using\n\ntraining statistics from the same segment and pass (see Table 2.1-3a).\n\n\nco\n\n1H\n\n\xe2\x80\xa20\n+\n\nC)\nC\nC)\nC4\n\nP4\n\nC\n\n2.1-9\n\n\ncW\n\no\n\nG!OO\n\n-Poo"\n\nP0\n4\nQU.\n\no41,\n\n-H\n\nTable 2.7-1\n\nDates data taken for overlays used in multitemporal/multisegment problen\n\n\nFINNEY\nPass\nDesignation\n\nTape\nChannel\n\ndate\n\nMORTON\nTape\nChannel\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nFeb. 25, 1974\n\nMay 26, 1974\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\ndate\n\nTape\n\nChannel\n\ndate\n\n\nOct. 23, 1973\n\n\nFeb. 25, 1974\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nFeb. 24, 1974\n\n\n5\nMay 27, 1974\n\n6\n\nMay 26, 1974\n\n\n8\n\n\n12\n\n8\n\nELLIS\n\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n11\n June 12, 1974\n\n12\n\n\nIII\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nJuly 1, 1974\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\nJuly 2, 1974\n\n13\n\n14\nJuly 2, 1974\n\n15\n\n16\n\n\n2.1-11\n\n\nTo estimate the impact of the three segments not belonging to the\n\nsame spectral stratum, a single-stage classification was performed using\n\nthe statistics from Finney and Ellis, separately, to classify the\n\ncorresponding dates of Morton (Table 2.1-3b). The results showed\n\nmarked deterioration of results as compared to Morton classified with\n\nMorton statistics.\n\nIn an attempt to ameliorate the multiple stratum effects, an\n\nadditive shift was made in the training class means and the single-stage\n\nclassifications of Morton were repeated. The results, shown in Table\n\n2.1-3c, appeared sufficiently improved to warrant continuation with the\n\nexperiment. However, we would not advocate this sort of. treatment of\n\nthe data on a routine basis. Nor does this provide a general justifi\xc2\xad\ncation for relaxation of the assumption that all segments be from the\n\nsame spectral stratum.\n\nThe test of the multitemporal layered classifier logic consisted\n\nof using the mean-adjusted statistics from Finney II and Ellis III to\n\nclassify Morton II + III. A decision tree was designed using Finney II\n\nas the base date and using Ellis III to resolve occurrences of the\n\n"mixture" classes. The results are shown in Table 2.1-3d.\n\nTo evaluate these results, one must first decide what to compare\n\nthem against. There are a number of possibilities and we shall look\n\nat several.\n\n1. We can compare the results with classifications of Morton using\n\nMorton statistics. Although in the practical problem, our hypothesis is\n\nthat training data are not available from Morton, in the experiment this\n\nprovides us a reasonable "upper bound" on what we might expect to\n\nachieve; i.e., this provides an indication of how separable the classes\n\nare in the classified segment.\n\n2. We can compare the results with the classifications of Finney II\n\nusing Finney II statistics and Ellis III using Ellis III statistics.\n\nThe latter two classifications provide an indication of how separable\n\nthe classes are in the training segments--another "upper bound."\n\n3. We can compare the results with classifications of Morton II\n\nwith Finney II statistics and Morton III with Ellis III statistics.\n\nThis provides probably the best indication of the contribution of the\n\nlayered classifier approach in the context of the actual application.\n\nThe reader who tries to make these comparisons based on the results\n\nin Table 2.1-3 will find it quite a task because of the erratic nature\n\nof some of those results (see especially Morton III classified with\n\nMorton III statistics). All of these analyses were performed using the\n\nsame "standard" procedure, and we have not been able to attribute the\n\npeculiarities to anything specific except for some.of the irregularities\n\nin the data set, especially the reference data. We look forward to\n\nconducting further tests on data sets of greater integrity.\n\n\nTable 2.1-2\n\nChannel Means and Variances for Finney, Morton and Ellis\n\n\nELLIS\n\nMORTON\n\nFINNEY\nch\n\nmean\n\nvart,\n\nCh\n\nmean\n\nvar\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\npass\n\n30.7\n32.1\n37.4\n18.9\n\noh\n\nmean\n\nvar\n\n5..32\n7.07\n8.06.\n4.20\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n3.56\n4.62\n5.02\n\n5\n6\n7\n\n27.6\n29.4\n33.0\n\n2.46\n3.71\n4.82\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n24j.6\n24.7\n26.9\n\n3.26\n3.56\n4.81\n\n4\n\nI\n\n26.1\n27.0\n28.8\n14.7\n\n3.06\n\n8\n\n17.1\n\n3.22\n\n4\n\n13.9\n\n2.32\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n35.9\n35.5\n48.4\n24.5\n\n7.11\n11.7\n10.9\n7.74\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n46.8\n55.0\n57.7\n27.2\n\n6.89\n10.9\n6.74\n3.56\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n30.8\n26.9\n37.9\n19.8\n\n7.58\n8.42\n10.8\n7.37\n\n9\n\n35.2\n\n4.77\n\n10\n\n33.5\n\n7.91\n\n11\n\n44.3\n\n7.81\n\n12\n\n21.8\n\n5.04\n\n13\n14\n1\n16\n\n38.5\n40.8\n\n3.90\n7.02\n\n48.0\n\n7.65\n\n23.4\n\n4.4\xc2\xa7\n\n13\ni4\n\n49.1\n56.5\n\n6.24\n10.1\n\n8.34\n\n4g\n\n59.7\n\n10.5\n\n6.38\n\n16\n\n27.5\n\n9\n10\n\n39.9\n46.3\n\n6.22\n12.7\n\n1i\n\n57.7\n\n1i\n\n29.3\n\n5.32\n\n\'-I\n\n(a) Finney I\n\n(b) Ellis I\n\n(c) Morton I\n\n\n(d) Finney I\n\n(e) Ellis II\n\n(f) Morton II\n\n\n(g) Finney III\n\n(h) Ellis III\n\n(i) Morton III\n\n\nIte\n\n\nFigure 2.1-4\n\nImagery of 3 sites, 3 passes (channel 3)\n\nH.\n\nw,\n\nTable 2.1-3\n\nMultitemporal/Multisegment Classifier Performance\n\n\nTraining\nSite\n\nClassified\n\nSite \n\n\nWheat \n\n\nFi\nFli\nFIll\nEl\nElI\nESil\nMI\nNUU0\nMIII\n\nFl \n\nFlI \n\nFIll \n\nEl\nEli \n\nEIll\nMI\nMil \n\nMIll \n\n\n24.6\n58.2\n45.1\n42.3\n97.2\n89.7\n42.2\n79.3\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPi\nFII\nFill\nEI\nEli\nEilli\n\nMi \n\nMII \n\nMIll \n\nMI \n\nMII \n\nMIII \n\n\n14.5\n9.7\n41.0\n38.7\n5.5\n97.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPI\nFII\nFill\nEl\nEll\nEi\n\nMI \n\nMil \n\nMIll \n\nMI \n\nmix \n\nMIII \n\n\n27.2\n59.6\n23.1\n57.1\n82.0\n54.0\n\n\n\n\nFII+EllI\n\nMiI+M111 \n\n\n12.8\n58.6\n27.6\n49.3\n66.5\n10.5\n31.0\n52.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-19.2 \n\n\nOther Grain \n\n22.8 \n\n25.8 \n\n44.7 \n\n-(note\n-\n\n32.0 \n\n16.9\n\n18.6 \n\n\n5.9\n4.9\n11.3\n25.6\n7.5\n0.0\n\xc2\xad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62.9 \n\n\nPasture \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.5 \n\n89.8 \n\n12.1 \n\n\n0.7\n8.5\n15.5\n1.2\n0.0\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.5 \n\n34.1 \n\n38.5 \n\n\n4.9 \n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\n33.2 \n\n\nFallow\n\n\n1) \n\n\n20.6\n\n23.3\n\n43.6\n\n20.0 \n\n62.6\n68.2 \n\n14.8\n\n\n(a) Sites classified\n\nusihn "ij lw\n\nstatistics\n\n\n4.0\n\n23.1 \n\n18.8 \n\n16.0 \n\ni.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n5.1\n\n\n(b) Morton classified\n\nusing unadjusted\n\nstatistics from\n\nFinney and Ellis\n\n(note 2)\n\n\n21.2 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.8 \n\n19.4 \n\n41.8\n\n39.3\n\n\n(C) Morton classified\n\nusihg adjusted\n\nstatistics from\n\nFinney and Ellis\n\n\n10.3 \n\n\n(d) Multitemporal\n\nclassification\n\nof Morton using\n\nFinney and Ellis\n\nstatistics\n\n\nnote 1 - indicates no training data available.\n\nnote 2 - Ellis 1I cloud class had substantial impact.\n\n\nI-\'\n\n\n2.1-15\n\n\nThe following observations from Table 2.1-3 are encouraging, however:\n\n1- The multitemporal layered classification yielded slightly more\n\naccurate classification of wheat than either Morton II classified with\n\nFinney II statistics or Morton III classified with Ellis III statistics.\n\n2. With the multitemporal data, it was possible to classify the\n\n"other grain" in Morton whereas this was not possible using the Ellis III\n\n\nstatistics alone (Ellis III has no training data for "other grain").\n\nThus, although we cannot draw very strong positive conclusions from\n\nthis single test, we feel that in the face of the data quality problem\n\nand the multiple stratum situation which had to be dealt with, the\n\nresults are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further tests as\n\nappropriate LACIE data sets become available.\n\nChange Detection\n\nThe layered decision strategy used for multitemporal classifications\n\nis easily adapted to change detection. Training is againperformed\n\nseparately-for the respective passes. In the base date, all classes\n\nare considered, while in the second date the analyst need only account\n\nfor the classes into which the change is assumed to happen. For the\n\nbase date, a tree is designed using the Optimal Decision Tree Design\n\nprodedure. A second tree is then designed using the second date for\n\nthe possible change classes. The trees are joined such that the tree\n\nfrom the second date is attached to each terminal node of the base tree\n\nrepresenting-a class for which change is anticipated. Thus, data from\n\nthe second date is used only for those points classified from the first\n\ndate as candidates for change.\n\nAn experiment was performed using data over the Texas Coastal Zone\n\nconsisting of a two date overlay, the first date November 27, 1972 and\n\nthe second date December 15, 1973. Because of the relative dates of\n\nthe two passes, seasonal differences were not expected to seriously\n\ninfluefice the outcome of the change detection procedure. To keep the\n\nproblem simple, only change from water to sandbank was investigated.\n\nFigure 2.1-5 shows the tree used in the procedure. Figure 2.1-6 shows\n\npart of the resulting classification. The shaded area shovis points\n\nwhere water had changed to sandbank in the course of a calendar year.\n\nThe result was compared to a "straightforward" change detection, in\n\n\nwhich the results of two classifications were compared on a point-by\xc2\xad\npoint basis. The results of the two procedures were in good agreement.\n\nBased on the outcome of this experiment, further change detection work\n\nusing the layered classifier was conducted under this contract as part\n\n\nof the Regional Applications Project.\n\n\npass 2 subtree\n\n\nFigure 2.1-5\n\nDecision Tree for Change Detection ("water" to "sandbank").\n\n2.1-17\n\n\nli ltIIII11111111\n\nIllIl\n\n)11i,\n\nI\n\n\'I\'LL\n\nft f f\nf\n\np\n031\n\nf\n\n\'\n\n~\n\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\n0(1-4\n\'1i\nII\n\'Itt\n\nIII\nI\n\ni\n\n.....\nII\nI .. . . . h~iI FI\n.\n\nl\n\nAM I tI F I I\nI II\n\nlflIII\n\nA111\n\n10"119\nlIlH\n\nfI,\n\n,61,\n\n~\n\n/IF.",,P\n\n~\n\nIF\n07.1\n\nAF?

Layered Classifier Implementation\n\nApproach\n\nResults\' of previous research included computer programs which\n\nimplement the layered classifier approach to data analysis in two phases.\n\nThe first phase, called the Optimal Decision Tree Design procedure, is\n\nan algorithm for automatically determining the optimal layered decision\n\nlogic for a layered classifier. The second phase accepts as input the\n\ndescription of layered decision logic, generated by the Optimal Decision\n\nTree Design.procedure or any other method, and performs classification\n\nof multispectral remote sensing data. We actually refer to this phase\n\nas the Layere Classifier.\n\nThe specific goal of the implementation effort is to upgrade the\n\nresearch software to the point of being LARSYS-compatible so that (1)\n\nthis method of data analysis will be conveniently available to applica\xc2\xad\ntions-oriented researchers,who need it,, (2) further upgrades to incor\xc2\xad\nporate advances in the technology will be facilitated, and (3) the soft\xc2\xad\nware will be sufficiently documented for transfer to NASA and others\n\nrequesting it.\n\nTo accomplish this goal required detailed analysis of the existing\n\nsoftware to determine its operation and the nature of the desired\n\ninterfaces with both the user and other software needed, in the analysis\n\nprocess; planning and execution of the software design;, and generation\n\nof documentation appropriate both for users (data analysts) and programmers.\n\n\n2.1-19\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe first step taken was to go through the programs with an eye to\n\nhow they should look when finished. A list of problems was laid out and\n\nordered by priority. This list included the following:\n\n1. \tWhat control cards are needed to input all necessary data?\n\n2. \tIn what format should the decision tree information be input?\n\n3. \tWhat internal representation of the tree is best in terms of\n\nflexibility and storage efficiency?\n\n4. \tHow can all of this information be saved on a results tape\n\nfor later display and further manipulation?\n\nAfter examining the programs, it was decided that for expediency\n\nthe LARSYS CLASSIFYPOINTS processor would be modified to perform layered\n\nclassification. Figure 2.1-7 shows a diagram of the Layered Classifier\n\nwhich resulted.\n\nThe Layered Classifier research software used a fixed format data\n\ndeck for the .decision tree input. Because users could be expected to\n\nneed to design and modify their tree decks manually, a free format tree\n\nrepresentation scheme was necessary. This involved drastic changes to\n\nthe format and necessitated the development of a new program utilizing\n\noriginal card reading and decoding techniques. Table 2.1-4 shows the\n\ncontrol card description for the new layered classifier.\n\nInternally, a new tree format had to be devised. The old one used\n\nfixed array sizes and greatly limited the number of nodes in the decision\n\nA new linked\n\n-tree as well as the size of the data set to be classified.\nlist system was developed to internally describe the tree. A dynamic\n\nmemory allocation scheme was devised to increase the utilization of the\n\navailable storage.\n\nA method for graphically representing a tree on the computer output\n\nwas \t\ndeveloped. This should prove to be a great help to analysts as it\n\nprovides a permanent, easily interpretable record of what their tree\n\nlooks like. An example of this output is shown in Figure 2.1-8.\n\nSome initial consideration has been given to the problem of putting\n\nthe tree information on the results tape. Probably the easiest way is to\n\ncopy the tree deck to the tape in card image form similar to the\n\nstatistics deck.

In addition, a set of software documentation and user\n\nis\ndocumentation% being completed to describe the, implementation and\nusage of the Layered Classifier. We did not reach the point of being\n\nable to expend effort on the Optimal Decision Tree Design software,\n\nhowever; it is desirable that this software be developed into a program\n\nsimilar to the Layered Classifier as it is an important component of the\n\nlayered classifier system. Some additional effort should be directed\n\ntoward appropriately saving the decision tree on the results tape\n\ntogether with the corresponding classification.\n\nC. The Optimal Decision Tree Design Procedure\n\nApproach\n\nFor a fixed set of features, classes., and candidate classification\n\ncriteria (maximum likelihood is-only one example of the latter), it is\n\npossible to enumerate all possible decision trees which-could, be.\nconstructed. In theory, one could evaluate each of these trees and\n\nselect for implementation the tree which gives the best performance.\n\nIn practice, however, the number of possible trees is generally so\n\nlarge as to preclude such an exhaustive search for the optimal decision\n\ntree, and we therefore seek to devise more clever means of determining\n\nthe optimal decision tree.\n\nIn earlier research at LARS, Wu (Information Note 090174) developed\n\na heuristic-search procedure for decision tree design which we refer\n\nto as "guided search with forward pruning." Essentially, the strategy\n\n-is to construct the decision tree a node at a time, estimating the\n\nsuitability-of-all candidate substructures for the node under considera\xc2\xad\ntion, and discarding all but the most promising candidate subtree.\n\nThe strategy requires a means for evaluating each node in the tree.\n\nFor each candidate structure following-node d+, the evaluation is\n\ncomputed as follows:\n\n\nE(di) = -T(d.)\n\n-\n\nn.\nZ\'\nKs(di) + j=l\nE(di+j )\n\nwhere T(d.) and s(d.) express the efficiency (computation time) and\n\naccuracy associated with node di and the summation is an estimate of the\n\nevaluation functions of the descendent nodes of di (assumed to be n i in\n\nnumber). A lower bound is used to form this estimate, which -is the\n\nevaluation of a conventional single-stage classifier applied at that point.\n\n\nLABORATORY FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING\n\nPURDUE UNIVLRSITY\n\n\nSPENCER\nPAUL SPENCER\n\n614247933\n\nCLASSIFICATION STUDY\n\nLAYERED CLASSIFIER, DECISION\n\n1\n\nLAYER\n\nLAYER\n\n2\n\nLAYER\n\nON TAPE/FILE...\n\nO/ \n\n\nTREE\n\n\n3\n\nLAYER\n\n4\n\nLAYER\n\n5\n\nLAYER\n\n6\n\nLAYLR\n\n7\n\nLAYER\n\n8\n\nLAYER\n\nTOP\nI----------ONZ\n\nI\n\nI--------- WC\n\nI\n\nI\nI--------- TW\n\nII\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI----------PRS\n\n\nI\nI ----\n\nI\n\n------\n\n--- OT\nI---------- PR\n\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI---------MSTI\n\nI\nI----------RM\n\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI----------TMY\n\nI\n\nII\nI----------FIVE\n\nI\nI I -------------EE\n\nIAI\n\nI\nII\nII\n\n---\n\n-\n\n---\n\nPRI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nII\nII\n\nI-I\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI ------------x\n\nII\n\nII\n\nIAG\n\nI\nI----------A\n\nI\nI\nII\nI\nLI\nI\nII\n\nII-----I\nI\n\nI------\n\n-\n\nA63\n\n\nI----------\n\nSRI\n\n-------I----------RS\nI\n\nIR\n\n\nI\nI\n--- VEN\nII\nII----------CLOU\nMR I\n\nI\nI\n\nI----------MRDI\n\nI\n\n---- R\n\n-SEE\n\nII\n\nII\nIII--------\n\nFiur\n\n218\n\n--"I--- - - -C\n\nEx----le oGrai\n-- G\n\nxapl\n\nf\n\nDeiion\n\nTree\n\n\nNJU\n\n\nrahia\n\nDspayo\n\nte\n\necsonTre\n\n9\n\n\n2.1-24\n\n\nConstructing the tree in this sequential fashion cannot guarantee\n\nthat the optimal tree will be obtained, because, unfortunately, the\n\noptimal choice at any level in the tree is not necessarily independent\n\nof choices at later stages.

Analysis techniques which are\n\nsatisfactory for data acquired by airborne sensor systems or for limited\n\nareas of LANDSAT data cannot be effectively used to classify an entire\n\nLANDSAT frame of data. Fortunately, however, the variation found in\n\nLANDSAT scenes is not random, but occurs in very definite patterns.\n\nThese landscape patterns are associated with the different topographic\n\nfeatures, soils, crops, farming practices, and climatic zones found in\n\na 35,000 square Km area.\n\nThis suggests that one of the first steps in the analysis and\n\nclassification of LAIDSAT data covering one or more LANDSAT scenes is\n\nto divide the scene into areas that have similar characteristics.\n\nDivision of a heterogeneous population (or area) into subpopulations\n\n(or subareas), each of which is internally homogeneous is known as\n\nstratification and is frequently used by statisticians performing surveys\n\nto increase the precision of estimates.\nIf each stratum is homogeneous\n\nin that the measurements vary little from one unit to another, a precise\n\nestimate of any stratum mean can be obtained from a small sample in that\n\nstratum. Estimates from several strata can then be combined into a pre\xc2\xad\ncise estimate for the whole population. Use of stratification in the\n\nsampling designs used for remote sensing applications is therefore\n\nadvantageous.\n\nA second use of stratification directly related to remote sensing\n\napplications is to potentially permit training statistics developed for\n\none segment or portion of the scene to be successfully used to classify\n\nother segments which are spatially and/or temporally removed from the\n\ntraining segment. In this context the term spectral stratification is\n\nuseful in that it connotes the division of the scene into areas which\n\nare internally spectrally similar. A spectral stratum may be defined\n\nas an area within which the scene (including atmospheric effects) is\n\nsufficiently similar that training statistics from one portion of the\n\nstratum can be used to classify other portions of the stratum without\n\nsignificant change in classification performance. Conversely, if the\n\nsame training statistics are applied to areas outside the stratum in\n\nwhich they were developed, classification performance will decrease.\n\nComputer-implemented clustering techniques provide an objective\n\nand efficient method for determining the similarity of units within\n\nLANDSAT scenes. The objectives of this project are:\n(1) develop\n\nmultivariate pattern recognition procedures for determining and\n\ndelineating spectral strata in LANDSAT data and (2) determine quanti\xc2\xad\ntatively.the physical factors which account-for the spectral strata.\n\n\n2.2-2\n\n\nClustering Procedures for Spectral Stratification\n\nThe technique of clustering has been adopted to define the spectral\n\nstrata present in LANDSAT scenes. Clustering has been used extensively\n\nin remote sensing to group together units which are similar, based on\n\nobservation vectors and a measure of similarity. Most remote sensing\n\ndata analysts are familiar with the process of clustering pixels into\n\nspectral classes to be used later in classification. The observation\n\nvector in that type of clustering is the spectral response of the pixel\n\nin each waveband, and a commonly used measure of similarity is the\n\nEuclidean distance in the observation space.\n\nIn spectral stratification, the sample unit is much larger than a\n\nsingle pixel and the objectives of the clustering technique are slightly\n\ndifferent from the familiar process mentioned above. Instead of grouping\n\ntogether vectors of spectral responses for single pixels, we wish to\n\ngroup distributions of the spectral responses of sample units. Two units\n\nare spectrally similar if the distribution of spectral response in one\n\nunit is close to the distribution of the spectral response in the\n\nsecond area.\n\nWe can state the generalized procedure for clustering to define\n\nspectral strata in five steps.\n\n1. \tSelect sample units- in the scene.\n\n2. \tCharacterize the distribution of the spectral response of\n\neach unit.\n\n3. \tChoose a measure of similarity.\n\n4. \tApply a clustering algorithm to the units to determine\n\ngroups of spectrally similar units.\n\n5. \tDelineate the strata boundaries.\n\nEach step and its application to stratification will be explained\n\nfurther.\n\nSelection of Sample Units\n\nThe sample units to be used in this procedure may either be segments\n\nwhose geographic position has been fixed by a sampling scheme before the\n\nLANDSAT data is acquired or rectangular areas chosen from the LANDSAT data\n\nitself without regard for their geographic position. The size of the\n\nsampling unit affects the kind of strata that can be found as it is the\n\neffective lower limit on the size of strata that can be observed. For\n\nexample, if the sampling unit is larger than the largest city in the scene,\n\nthen urban areas cannot be separated as distinct strata. TMe smaller\n\nthe sampling unit chosen, the smaller the geographic extent of the strata\n\nand the finer the division, or levels, that can be observed. For example,\n\n\n2.2-3\n\n\nif a pixel is chosen as the sampling unit, the strata essentially are\n\nthe spectral subclasses of cover types present in the scene.\n\nCharacterization of Spectral Response\n\nThe distribution of the spectral response within a sampling unit\n\nmay be characterized in several ways. Two methods have been pursued in\n\nthis work. In the first method the distribution of the spectral response\n\nin an area is represented by its first and second moments, that is, by\n\nits mean vector and covariance matrix. These parameters are easy to\n\ncalculate and to use with similarity measures. However, they do not\n\ncontain complete information on the skewness, multimodality, and non\xc2\xad\nnormality of the distribution, all of which may be important in applying\n\na statistical measure of distance between distributions.\n\nA second method is essentially non-parametric. The distribution\n\nof the spectral response is characterized by the marginal density\n\nfunctions of the distribution. The marginal density functions rather\n\nthan the joint density function are used to meet computer space limita\xc2\xad\ntions when dealing with large numbers of sample units. The character\xc2\xad\nization of distributions of the sample units is accomplished by first\n\ntabulating a base histogram for each feature (wavelength band) for the\n\nentire scene which is to be stratified. Equally probable bins are\n\nestablished from these histograms. Then a vector is constructed for\n\neach sampling unit in which each entry in the vector is the number of\n\npixels in the sampling unit which fall in the corresponding bin in the\n\nbase histograms. Thus the histograms or marginal densities of each\n\nsampling unit are characterized relative to the base histograms. The\n\n"histogram vectors" formed in this manner can then be used as data by\n\na clustering routine.\n\n\nSimilarity Measures\n\nIn addition to the choice of characterization of the distribution of\n\neach unit\'s spectral response, a choice must be made of how to measure\n\nthe similarity of two or more sample units. Sample units will be\n\nspectrally similar if the distance between their distributions or\xc2\xad\ndensity functions is small. For the first method, that of representation\n\nof a distribution by its mean vector and covariance matrix, several\n\n2\n\nstatistical measures are possible.\nThe transformed divergence has been the primary similarity measure\n\nused in this research as its properties are closer to the Jeffreys-\n\nMatusita distance 2 than are the properties of divergence, yet it is\n\ncomputationally less complex that the Jeffreys-Matusita distance. The\n\ndesirable properties of the Jeffreys-Matusita distance are that it is\n\na metric among multivariate normal densities and it is related to the\n\nprobability of error (amount of overlap) between two densities.\n\nThe implementation of these distance measures assumes that the\n\ndistributions involved are multivariate normal. The assumption of\n\n\n2.2-4\n\n\nnormality may be violated when the sampling unit contains bad data or\n\nclouds which saturate the dynamic range of the data or when the sampling\n\nunit is divided into two distinct spectral classes, leading to bimodality.\n\nUse of large sample units has tended to alleviate the second problem, and\n\nwe have tried to avoid bad data lines. Examinations of histograms have\n\nindicated that the normality assumption is not unreasonable for the data\n\nwe have been using.\n\nFor the second method, that of "histogram vectors", the Euclidean\n\ndistance between the vectors was chosen as a similarity measure for two\n\nreasons. First, it is a familiar measure whose properties are well\n\nknown, and secondly, it has been previously implemented and extensively\n\nused in clustering analysis.\n\nClustering of Sample Units\n\nOnce a characterization of the spectral response and a distance or\n\nsimilarity measure have been selected, groups of spectrally similar units\n\nmust be determined. If the analyst were to manually examine all possible\n\npairs of units, the process would quickly become unwieldly and the results\n\ndifficult to interpret for a large number of units. For example, if 150\n\nunits are to be stratified, over 10,000 pairwise comparisons are necessary.\n\nA machine-implemented clustering algorithm calculates the many pairwise\n\ndistances and combines the information before presenting the analysts\n\nwith the natural groups of the sample units.\n\nTwo clustering algorithms have been applied in this project. The\n\nfirst is an iterative algorithm which has been available for both obser\xc2\xad\nvation space and parameter space clustering. 2 The algorithm can be\n\nsimple stated in its general form.\n\n1. \t\nDetermine initial group centers.\n\n2. \t\nAssign each unit to the nearest group center.\n\n3. \t no unit has changed allegiance, go to step 4.\n\nIf\nOtherwise, determine new group centers and return to\n\nstep 2.\n\n4. \t groups are distinct, stop. Otherwise modify the\n\nIf\nnumber of groups, determine new group centers, and\n\nreturn to step 2.\n\nIn our research this algorithm has been applied to cluster units\n\ncharacterized by their mean vectors and covariance matrices in the\n\nparameter space, and to cluster the histogram vectors in the observation\n\nspace manner.\n\nThe second clustering algorithm is a systematic procedure for\n\ngrouping spectrally similar units in such a way as to minimize the total\n\n\nQuagp\n\n\n2.2-5\n\n\n3\n\nnumber of groups while avoiding the grouping of non-similar units.\nThis procedure is slightly more complex than the first, as is seen in\n\nthe following description.\n\n\n1.\n\nAssign each unit to its own group, GI, G2,..., Gn.\n\n\n2.\n\nOrder the pairwise distances (d..), by magnitude. The\n\nd\n\nalgorithm considers (di.) in ascnding order. Let\nxy\n\n.\nd. \n\nequal the smallest\n\n3. \tIf d >T, a threshold of non-similarity, grouping is\n\ncompted. Otherwise, proceed to step 4.\n\n4. \tIf the units x and y belong to the same group, go to\n\nstep 7. Otherwise proceed to step 5.\n\n5. \tConstruct the average distance d\nbetween G and\n\neach other group G 4G for whichxUd < for al a inG\n\nand b in G\nThe average distance etween groups is\ndefined as the average of all pairwise distances between\nunits in the different groups.\n-\n\n6. \tIf di is the minimum of the set of inter-group distances\n\nconsgucted step 5, then combine Gx and Gy\ninto one group.\n\n7. \tSet dxy \t the next d.. and return to step 3.\n\nto\n13\nWe have used this algorithm to group the spectrally similar units\n\ncharacterized bytheir mean vectors and covariance matrices.\n\nDelineation of Strata Boundaries\n\nAfter clustering is completed, the strata boundaries are delineated.\n\nPresently, this process is done manually when full LANDSAT frames or\n\nportions of frames have been stratified, although in the future we\n\nintend to adapt the "Extraction and Classification of Homogeneous Objects"\n\n(ECHO) approach to establish the boundaries of strata determined on the\n\nbasis of fixed segments or a small sample of a LANDSAT frame. 4 When\n\nfixed segments based on a sampling scheme are stratified, a list of the\n\nsegments in each stratum is produced rather than a map since this is the\n\nknowledge desired in this case and since the geographic location of\n\nstrata boundaries between the segments is uncertain. That is, even though\n\nit is known that the boundary is between certain segments, the exact\n\n\nlocation is unknown.\n\nData Set Available for Stratification\n\nIn the course of this contract, two data sets have been supplied to\n\nLARS by NASA/JSC. The first data set (LACIE) was received in July, 1975,\n\nand contained LANDSAT-l data covering twenty-five 1973-74 LACIE segments,\n\n\n2.2-6\n\n\nincluding five Intensive Test Sites. All of these images were 117 lines\n\nby 196 pixels. Only the Intensive Test Sites were multitemporal. Train\xc2\xad\ning field coordinates and identifications made by photointerpretation\n\nwere available for all segments and test field coordinates and ground\xc2\xad\nlevel identifications were also available for the Intensive Test Sites.\n\nThe second data set (SRS) was received at LARS in August, 1975\n\nand contained multitemporal images of LANDSAT-l data covering eighteen\n\nSRS sites and five Intensive Test Sites. The SRS segments were all 200\n\nlines by 200 pixels in size while the Intensive Test Sites were larger\n\nand varied in size.\n\nIn addition, several full-frames of LANDSAT-l data for Kansas\n\nacquired during the 1973-74 winter wheat growing season were available\n\nin-house at LARS.\n\nStratification of Full-Frame Images\n\nSeveral full-frames of LANDSAT-l data were stratified under this\n\neffort. During preliminary work, scenes 1583-16525 (Feb. 26, 1974) and\n\n1689-16382 (June 12, 1974) were stratified using a sample unit of 200\n\nlines x 200 pixels or 13 x 16 Km. The distributions of the spectral\n\nresponse of the sample units were characterized by both methods described\n\nin the section Characterization of Spectral Response, and both algorithms\n\ndescribed in the section Clustering of Sample Units, were used to define\n\nspectral strata within the above scenes.\n\nThese preliminary stratifications were quite "blocky" and seemed to\n\ncorrelate only with major soil or land use divisions. This suggested\n\nthat the size ofthe sample unit should be decreased, and so sample\n\nunits of 100 lines x 100 pixels (or 6.5 x 8 Yim) and 50 lines x 50 pixels\n\n(3.2 x 4 K(m) were used in further investigations of full-frame stratifi\xc2\xad\ncation.\n\nSixteen LANDSAT-l scenes over Kansas acquired during the 1973-74\n\nwinter wheat growing season and one LANDSAT-2 scene acquired in 1975 were\n\nstratified using a smaller sample unit size. Generally, strata could be\n\nfound which correlated with soil and land use patterns. However, in\n\nthese stratifications, there were sample units which were not geographically\n\nlinked to other units in the same stratum. That is, sample units from\n\none stratum were surrounded by units from another stratum. When these\n\nsample units were examined closely, it was discoveredthat they did have\n\nspectral characteristics which distinguished them from the surrounding\n\nunits and allied them to units which were spatially removed. This re\xc2\xad\nsuit, though perhaps counter to an intuitive conception of strata as\n\nspatially contiguous, is consistent with spectral strata as regions\n\nwhich are internally spectrally similar.\n\nThe accuracy of the stratification can be assessed indirectly by\n\ncomparing the strata found by clustering with maps of physical factdrs\n\nwhich are known to influence spectral response. Presently the LANDSAT\n\n\n2.2-7\n\n\nimagery, strata maps, and physical factor maps are being compared\n\nmanually. The illustrations in Figures 2.2-3 permit a qualitative\n\ncomparison of a spectral stratification and soil and land use maps for\n\nthe same area of southwestern Kansas. The spectral stratification\n\nshown in Figure 2.2-1 was produced by the "histogram vectors" method\n\ndescribed in the section on Clustering Procedures for Spectral Stratifi\xc2\xad\ncation. The sample units in this example are 50 pixels x 50 pixels or\n\nroughly 4 Km x 3.2 Km.\n\nThe soil association map shown in Figure 2.2-2 exhibits several\n\nfeatures easily seen in both LANDSAT imagery of the area and the spectral\n\nstratification. The areas of the Udic Ustolls (12) are easily visible,\n\nas are the patterns of the Typic Ustolls (9, 10, and 11). 5 The land\n\nuse map, Figure 2.2-3, was developed from LANDSAT imagery acquired\n\nduring June and July 1973.6 Almost two years later, the same land use\n\npatterns can be found in the stratification of the May 21, 1975 image.\n\nThese evaluations of full-frame stratification are subjective. A\n\ncomplete, more objective comparison of the stratifications with physical\n\nfactor ancillary data was planned. But due to problems in the regis\xc2\xad\ntration of ancillary data (see section on Ancillary Data Registration)\n\nand redirection of stratification efforts to the partitioning of LACIE\n\nsegments (see section on Partitioning of LACIE Segments), this evaluation\n\nhas not been carried out.\n\nLater, when the digitization of the ancillary data is completed, we\n\nplan to conduct a regression analysis which will quantify the degree of\n\ncorrelation between the strata and various physical factors. \n Such an\n\nanalysis will not only provide a measure of the accuracy of stratification,\n\nbut also provide quantitative information on the influence of major\n\nagronomic and meteorological factors on spectral reflectance. The\n\nphysical factors being investigated include crop maturity stage, soil\n\nassociation, land use, precipitation, temperature, and grain yield.\n\nPartitioning of LACIE Segments\n\nAt the end of November, 1975, NASA/JSC requested that all segments\n\nin the two data sets which had been supplied by JSC be stratified, or\n\npartitioned into strata.\n\nTo accomplish this, the segments in the above data sets were\n\nseparated into groups according to crop reporting district and wheat\n\nbiophase. The majority of the segments in the two data sets lie in the\n\nCentral and the Southwest Crop Reporting Districts. Of the remaining\n\ncrop reporting districts in the western two-thirds of Kansas, only the\n\nSouth Central Crop Reporting District had sufficient segments in a bio\xc2\xad\nphase to partition within itself. In order to stratify all the segments\n\navailable to us, an additional partitioning effort was made in which\n\nthe segments outside the Central and the Southwest Crop Reporting\n\nDistricts were assigned to \n\nthe closest of those two major crop reporting\n\ndistricts. These extended groups were then partitioned.\n\n\n2.2-8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n\nFigure 2.2-1\n\nMachine-Implemented Stratification of the Kansas\nPoi~tiofi\n\nof LANDSAT Scene 5032-16310. \n Each number epesents..a\n\ndifferent stratum.\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n2.2-9\n\n\nSOILS ASSOCIATIONS\n\n\n* \t\n\nr\n.\n\n\\ \t\n\n-\n\n6\n\n/\n\n7\n\n2. \t\n\n,,Deep, \t\n\n7--\n\nIUstolls,\n\n/1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n57fine \t\n.-/f 1\n\n-\n\nIgrayish-brown \t\n\nARIDIC USTOLLS\nOrthents, and Ustalfs\ngrAyish-brown and dark grayish\xc2\xad\nbrown silt\nloans\n1.

In Step 1 of the\n\ngeneralized procedure, the sample units were chosen in two ways. First,\n\neach segment was considered one unit, except for the larger intensive\n\ntest sites which were divided into units approximately the-size of the\n\nother segments. Thus, the sample units were between 117 lines -x 196\n\npixels to 200 lines x 200 pixels in size.\n\nThe second sample unit size chosen was approximately 100 lines x\n\n100 pixels. In this selection of sample unit, a sample unit was a.\n\n.quarter-segment, and sample unit size ranged from 57 lines x 98 pixels to\n\n100 lines x 100 pixels.\n\nIn either set of sample units, the spectral response of the unit\n\nwas characterized by the mean vector and covariance matrix of the pixels\n\nin the sample unit. The similarity of two sample units was measured by\n\ntransformed divergence. Both clustering procedures, given in the section\n\non Clustering of Sample Units, were applied to the groups of sample units\n\nof each size, and lists of segments in each stratum produced.. Thus, four\n\npartitions were generated for each group of segments within a crop\n\nreporting district and wheat biophase.\n\nGenerally, the stratifications produced by the two clustering pro\xc2\xad\ncedures were consistent for each sample unit size. The first algorithm\n\nusually generated fewer strata than the second clustering algorithm, and\n\nthese strata were combinations of the strata produced by the second\n\nalgorithm. When the smaller sample unit was used, parts of the LACIE\n\nsegments were often assigned to different strata. The distributions of\n\nthe smaller sample units are more prone to problems of nonnormality,\n\nskewness, and multimodality which may contribute to this effect.\n\nWe have attempted to measure the success of stratification of\n\nLANDSAT data by clustering through classification performance in local\n\nand non-local recognition of LACIE segments. The criterion for success\n\nis that classification accuracies for all segments within a stratum\n\nclassified using training statistics developed within a given stratum\n\nshould be similar.\n\nTo statistically evaluate a stratification, two or more areas with\n\nknown crop identification data must be available within each stratum.\n\nThese test areas should fall entirely within the stratum, and should be\n\nlarge enough to conduct a reasonable classification analysis. Such a data\n\nset will give an adequate test of the stratification of the test areas,\n\nbut cannot be used to determine the accuracy of the strata boundaries.\nThe data sets presently available to us do not meet these requirements and\na statistical evaluation of the classification evaluation is not possible.\nA portion of the classification results are presented in order to draw\nsome limited conclusions.\n\n-\n\n2.2-11\n\n\nClassification results from one stratification of segments in\n\nLANDSAT scenes acquired June 12, 1974 for central Kansas are presented\n\nin Table 2.27I. Each segment is either a 8x9.7 or 4.8x4.8 Km area\n\nfor which the crop types and LANDSAT data coordinates of the agricultural\n\nfields are known. The stratification procedure treated the segments as\n\nthe sample units and characterized each segment by its first and second\n\nmoments. \n The procedure placed the segments from Stafford, Ellis, Ellsworth,\n\nand Rice Counties in one stratum along with one of the segments from\n\nBarton County. The other segment from Barton County was placed in a\n\ndifferent stratum. Both of the procedures, described in the section on\n\nClustering of Sample Units, gave the same result when transformed diver\xc2\xad\ngence was used as the similarity measure.\n\nThe classification results show that the stratification technique\n\nwas successful in identifying segments which are indeed different. \n In\n\nno case was a high classification performance achieved when using\n\ntraining statistics from segments outside the stratum.\' For segments\n\nidentified as members of the same stratum, similar high (approximately\n\n90 percent correct) classification performances were obtained for both\n\nlocal and non-local classifications of several combinations of segments.\n\nThis indicates that these segments are from the same stratum. \n But, in\n\nseveral other instances the non-local classification result was lower\n\nthan the local classification performance, indicating these segments may\n\nbe from different strata. This would mean that the clustering procedure\n\nis grouping the segments into groups or strata which are too broad.\n\nSimilar results have been obtained with two other crop reporting\n\ndistrict-wheat biophase combinations. \n With the available data, however,\n\nwe cannot state with certainty whether the stratification procedure\n\nshould be modified or whether the inconsistencies in results are due to\n\nlimitations of the available data sets. \n The evaluation of stratification\n\nprocedures by classification performance has been limited by the resources\n\navailable and plagued by problems with the data sets such as misregistra\xc2\xad\ntion of multitemporal data, mislabelled fields, and inadequate amounts\n\nof training data. Lack of a more adequate test data set is a major\n\nproblem at this time; greater emphasis will need to be placed on this\n\nrequirement of stratification evaluation before additional progress can\n\nbe made.\n\nAncillary Data Registration\n\nThe requirement for registration of ancillary data (soils, meteor\xc2\xad\nology, etc.) is based on the requirement to relate spectral strata to\n\nphysical and environmental factors in a quantitative manner. \nThe assump\xc2\xad\ntion is that the variations in spectral response for a particular crop is\n\nrelated to the crop characteristics and the physical environment and\n\nknowing this relationship will enable extension of crop recognition\n\nalgorithm parameters from one location to a distant location.\n\n\n2.2-12\n\n\n.Table 2.2-1.

Although the goal was to register\n\nseveral frames in this period, data processing problems were numerous\n\nand difficult, and achievement of the single frame registration is con\xc2\xad\nsidered to be a significant milestone. The digital channels of physical\n\nfactor data will enable correlation and other forms of numerical\n\nanalysis to be performed on the physical factors rather than using\n\nvisual interpretative means to related the factors to spectral group\xc2\xad\nings or strata.\n\nThe four variables registered for frame 1689-16382 acquired June 12,\n\n1974 are soil association, land use, and precipitation for two time\n\nperiods. The details of the registration processing are described in the\n\nsection Research in Remote Sensing Technology. The source data and\n\nregistration results are discussed here.\n\nSoil Map Registration\n\nThe source soil map contains 42 soil units and was produced at a\n\nscale of 1:1,125,000. 5 A Lambert conformal conic projection was used for\n\nthe map which is reproduced in Figure 2.2-4. The map was mounted on a\n\ncoordinate digitizing table and each soil boundary was manually traced\n\nand digitized. Coordinates punched on cards were processed by a boundary\n\ndata registration system to produce an additional digital channel on the\n\nLANDSAT data tape. A soil code number is filled-in for each pixel so\n\nthat a soil type can numerically be associated to each four element multi\xc2\xad\nspectral vector in the LANDSAT data. Figure 2.2-5 contains a gray scale\n\nimage of the digital soil channel generated from the map for the area of\n\nthe frame. Different gray levels correspond to different soil types\n\nalthough an exact correspondence cannot be illustrated in the image.\n\nLand Use Map Registration\n\nThe second variable judged important in relating spectral strata to\n\nthe physical environment was general land use. A land use patterns map\n\nconsisting of twelve land use units transcribed onto a 1969 U.S.G.S. Base\n\nMap at a scale of 1:1,000,000 for the State of Kansas was obtained and\n\nprocessed. 6\n A Lambert conformal conic projection is used for the map.\n\nThis map was similarly processed by mounting it on a coordinate\n\ndigitizer and manually tracing out the edges of each land use unit and\n\npunching the coordinates on cards. These cards were then processed by a\n\nboundary registration system and a digital channel generated with land use\n\ncodes for each pixel in the LANDSAT frame. The land use map is reproduced\n\nin Figure 2.2-6 and as can be seen it is much more complex than the soil\n\nmap. There were approximately 300 arcs for the soil map compared to over\n\n1000 for the land use map. Processing this large number of arcs caused\n\nproblems in the software and resulted in extensive delay in completing\n\nthe registration.\n\n\nPAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITy\n\n\nFigure 2.2-6. \n Source Map for Land Use Pattern\nData.\n\n\nFigure 2.2-5. \n Gray Scale Map of Soil Association Information\nfor\n\nScene 1689-16382, Acquired June 12, 1974.\n\n\n2.2-15\n\n2.2-16\n\n\nPrecipitation Data Registration\n\nThe precipitation data was available on only a county basis; thus\n\nthe task was to digitize the county boundaries for Kansas and then in\xc2\xad\nsert the appropriate number in each county area. County boundaries were\n\ndigitized from the soil map used previously and the digital county boun\xc2\xad\ndaries were combined with the county values to produce two additional\n\ndata channels with a temperature or precipitation value for each pixel.\n\nThe precipitation data was obtained from data tapes supplied by\n\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The precipitation\n\ndata were summarized on a monthly basis for each of the counties in\n\nKansas. For the initial registrations the values used for each county\n\nwere the total precipitation for the periods October 1, 1973 - June 30,\n\n1974 and March 1 - June 30, 1974. Additional intervals of accumulation\n\nwill be defined in CY77 to further explore the correlation of spectral\n\nproperties with temperature as well as precipitation.\n\nOutlook on the Use of Spectral Stratification\n\nLarge scale surveys using satellite-acquired multispectral data\n\nrequire classifications to be made over areas at least the size of indivi\xc2\xad\ndual LANDSAT scenes. The diversity of landscape patterns found over\n\nmany areas of this size indicates that a logical first step in the\n\nanalysis and classification of LANDSAT data is to stratify or divide the\n\nscene into units which are internally similar. Such a stratification will\n\nbe helpful in constructing sampling frames which minimize the variance\n\namong sample units and in determining the boundaries of areas over which\n\ntraining statistics can be satisfactorily extended.\n\nStratification for sampling purposes can be based on static factors\n\nwhose boundaries are either static or change only very slowly. For\n\nclassification, however, the stratification should be based on the\n\nLANDSAT spectral data and will include the effects of dynamic as well\n\nas static factors.\n\nThe use of computer-implemented clustering procedure for dynamic\n\nstratification has been developed and tested over several LANDSAT\n\nscenes of Kansas. Initial results indicate that the technique can be\n\nused to determine the similarity of sample units and that the strata\n\nproduced agree with major physical factors. The use of such a procedure\n\nshould enable scenes to be more efficiently and objectively stratified\n\nthan would be possible using manual methods.\n\nWe recommend that stratification be considered a prerequisite of\n\nsignature extension or signature adjustment algorithms such as the\n\nmultiplicative and additive signature correction (MASC) technique described\n\nby Henderson. 7 Our observation of results from such algorithms is that\n\nthe results are highly variable and are data dependent. This shortcoming\n\nmay be largely overcome by applying such signature adjustment algorithms\n\nonly within a stratum, thus taking advantage of the knowledge gained from\n\nspectral stratification.\n\n\n2.2-17\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n1. \tCochran, W.G. 1963.\n\nStratified Random Sampling.\n\nIn Sampling Techniques.\n\nJohn Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, pp. 87-113.\n\n2. \tWacker, A.G. and D.A.

With the initiation of experiments such as the\n\nLarge Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE) the technology is moving\n\nrapidly toward operational applications. There is, however, a continuing\n\nneed for quantitative studies of the multispectral characteristics of\n\ncrops and soils and the agronomic and meteorological factors influencing\n\nthem if further advancements in the technology are to be made. In the\n\npast many such studies were made in the laboratory because of a lack of\n\ninstrumentation suitable for field studies. However, the applicability\n\nof such studies is generally limited. The development of sensor systems\n\ncapable of collecting high quality spectral measurements under field\n\nconditions now makes it possible to pursue investigations which would not\n\nhave been possible a few years ago.\n\nA major effort was initiated in the fall of 1974 by NASA/JSC with\n\nthe cooperation of USDA to acquire fully annotated and calibrated multi\xc2\xad\ntemporal sets of spectral measurements and supporting agronomic and\n\nmeteorological data. Spectral, agronomic, and meteorological measure\xc2\xad\nments are being made on three LACIE test sites in Kansas, South Dakota,\n\nand North Dakota. The remote sensing measurements include data acquired\n\nby two truck-mounted spectrometers, a helicopter-borne spectrometer, an\n\nairborne multispectral scanner, and the Landsat-l and -2 multispectral\n\nscanners. These-data are supplimented by an extensive set of agronomic\n\nand meteorological data acquired during each remote sensing data collec\xc2\xad\ntion mission. Together these data form one of the most complete and\n\nbest documented data sets ever acquired for remote sensing research.\n\nThus they are well-suited to serve as a data base for research defining\n\nfuture remote sensing systems and to quantitatively determine the spectral\xc2\xad\ntemporal characteristics of spring and winter wheat crops.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, Purdue/LARS was requested to\n\nprovide the technical leadership and coordination for the project as well\n\nas assume a major responsibility for the acquisition, processing,\n\narchiving, and analysis of the data. This report summarizes the activities\n\nof LARS in carrying-out these functions during the past year. The final\n\nsections of the report include summaries of analytical results of three\n\ninvestigations being pursued with field measurements data and recommenda\xc2\xad\ntions for the future direction of the field measurements project.\n\n\n2.3-2\n\n\nDATA ACQUISITION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nData acquisition activities were focused on the spring wheat crop\n\nin Williams County, North Dakota. The principal .measurement sites were\n\nlocated at the North Dakota State University Agricultural Experiment\n\nStation near Williston, North Dakota. Spectral bidirectional reflectance\n\nfactor, radiaht temperature, agronomic crop parameters, meteorological\n\nconditions and total irradiance were measured for 60 plots.arranged as\n\nshown in Figure 2.3-1. The treatments were chosen to represent the major\n\nagronomic factors affecting the growth, development, and yield of spring\n\nwheat. A summary of these measurements is shown in Table 2.3-1. Three of\n\nthe plots were also used for measuring the thermal properties of wheat\n\ncanopies; the results in the section on data analysis and results.\n\nIn addition, a large commercial wheat field was used for canopy\n\nmodelling measurements. At this site, spectral.bidirectional reflectance\n\nfactor and radiant temperature were measured at view angles distributed\n\nover the complete hemisphere of observation for nearly fixed sun posi\xc2\xad\ntions. Other data acquired for canopy modelling included photographs,\n\nagronomic data and ERTS-band reflectance factor measurements-.\n\nThe following sections describe the instruments and procedures\n\nused in acquiring the data, the.development of new instruments, and\n\nthe development of improved field measurement techniques an& procedures.\n\nRadiometric and Reflectance Data Acquisition\n\nThe Purdue/LARS field data acquisition system (mobile tower,\n\ninstrument van,-and portable generator) was used to operate the Model\n\n20C Spectroradiometer and precision radiation thermometer (PRT-5)\n\nabove the plots-on the experiment farm, the "modelling" field and the\n\ncanvas calibration panels located at the helicopter site. This system\n\nalso provided a maintenance and-calibration facility for the instruments\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n1. Calibration Procedures. A painted barium sulfate standard was\n\nused as the reflectance surface for spectral bidirectional reflectance\n\nmeasurements. For measurements in the thermal spectrum, two blackbodies\n\nwere used to bracket the spectral radiance of the subject scenes. One\n\nof the blackbodies was used to calibrate the PRT-5 for temperatures from\n\n150 C to 50 0 C.\n\n2. Model 20C Field Spectroradiometer.

The reference for these\n\nobservations was viewed at 0.\nThese measurements were made over the\n\nentire day, when possible, providing data for sun zenith angles distributed\n\nover a wide range. The model 20C spectral reflectance factors were\n\ncorrected for the reflectance of Barium Sulfate.\n\nThe thermal unit of the Model 20C was used to measure the spectral direc\xc2\xad\ntional radiance in a 150 field of view for selected experimental plots.\n\nMeasurements were performed with a view angle of 00 simultaneous with\n\nspectral reflectance factor and PRT-5 measurements. Thermal spectral\n\nmeasurements of these plots were completed within ten minutes under\n\nstable wind and incident light conditions.\n\nDuring all measurements the Model 20C and PRT-5 were positioned at\n\na height of seven meters above the canopy. The motor drive camera was\n\naligned with the reflective unit to acquire photographs of each plot\n\nduring the measurement. Additionally, oblique photographs of each plot\n\nwere taken using a hand-held camera at a height of approximately two\n\nmeters.\n\n3. PRT-5 Precision Radiation Thermometer. This instrument was\n\nused to view the plots during spectral reflectance factor measurements.\n\nData were recorded manually and entered in the data bank with the\n\ndescription of the measurement which is recorded for each reflectance\n\nspectra.\n\n4. Model 100 ERTS-Band Radiometer. The spectral-band reflectance\n\nfactor (in ERTS/Landsat bands) of four plots within the modelling field\n\nwas measured using-a tripod based mounting beam to position the radio\xc2\xad\nmeter at a height of 2 meters. The 150 field of view was used with a\n\nview angle of 0 .\n Data were acquired on June 24, July 11, 20, and 30,\n\nand August 13. The reflectance factor relative to a painted Barium\n\nSulfate panel was measured several times during the day for various sun\n\nangles. The directional-hemispherical transmittance of green, yellow,\n\nand brown leaves was measured using the transmittance attachment developed\n\nat LARS during the previous year.\n\nPhotographic records of the canopy included color slides taken at\n\nangles of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 degrees perpendicular and parallel\n\nto the row direction and silhouette photos of single rows and single\n\nplants.\n\n\n5. Total Incidence Pyranometen An Eppley Model 8-48 pyranometer\n\nwas stationed near the plots on the experiment station. Total irradi\xc2\xad\nance versus time was recorded on a strip chart for each-day on which\n\nspectral data were recorded.\n\n\n2.3-6\n\n\nMeteorological Data Acquisition\n\nMeteorological datawere measured and recorded at the experiment\n\nstation during.each day on which spectroradiometric data were acquired.\n\nThe measurements were acquired using the meteorological data acquisi\xc2\xad\ntion system designed and implemented the previous year. Measurements\n\nof barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed\n\nand direction are recorded on strip charts using-instruments manufac\xc2\xad\ntured by Weather Measure, Inc.\n\nMeasurements of temperatures-at various positions in\'and above\n\nwheat canopies were accomplished using a system developed at-LARS in\n\nFY75 and 76. Five thermilinear probes for measuring air and contact\n\ntemperatures were deployed from a single post and up to nine posts were\n\nmultiplexed to a temperature to voltage converter for measurement\n\nusing a digital voltmeter.\n\nAgronomic Data Acquisition\n\nAgronomic observations and measurements describing the condition\n\nof each of the plots were made at the time of the spectral,data acquisi\xc2\xad\ntion. These data include: maturity, height, percent ground coveryleaf\n\narea index, biomass of leaves, stems, and .heads, soil moisture and condi\xc2\xad\ntion, and grain yield. These data are supplemented,by\'vertidal and\n\noblique photographs of each plot.\n\nInstrument and Procedures Development\n\nA number of developmental tasks were required in support of the\n\ndata acquisition activities described above. These tasks included:\n\n1. Documentation of the directional-hemispherical transmittance\n\nattachment to the Model 100 ERTS-Band Radiometer was completed. [LARS\n\nInformation Note 052075] Extensive tests were performed on the trans\xc2\xad\nmittance measuring system to determine the comparability with-Beckman\n\nDK-2 transmittance measurements. Source and system transfer character\xc2\xad\nistics of both instruments were digitized directional-hemispherical\n\ntransmittance of typical-leaf samples was measured by both instruments,\n\nand the results were compared. Documentation of this evaluation, in\n\nprocess, indicated that the instruments compare favorably.\n\n2. Development of a directional-hemispherical reflectance attach\xc2\xad\nment for the Model 100 ERTS-Band Radiometer was begun. Field tests of\n\nthe attachment in May of 1976 indicated that further devel6pment is\n\nrequired. Modifications were made and further tests will be performed\n\nin June of 1976.\n\n\n2.3-7\n\n\n3. Field performance evaluations were performed for the truck\n\nspectrometers involved in the Field-Measurements Project. At the request\n\nof NASA/ERL, tests were performed on their Model 20D system to determine\n\nthe cause of reflectance values which were inconsistent with previous\n\n\nperformance. The causes were established and a procedure to determine\n\nthe instrument behavior over the summer was developed. This enabled ERL\n\npersonnel to correct the data.\n\nIn cooperation with NASA and Lockheed personnel, the operational\n\nprocedures for the Field Signature Acquisition System were examined and\n\nit was determined that the number of observations per plot could be\n\nsignificantly reduced without reducing the quality of the data. This and\n\nother modifications of operational procedures enabled the operation crew\n\nto acquire high quality data at a rate consistent with the requirements\n\nof the experiment.\n\nField procedures used routinely to check the performance of the\n\nLARS Model 20C were demonstrated to the operation crews using their\n\ninstruments. Frequent, on site, tests especially field of view tests,\n\nwere shown to be very important to the acquisition of quality data. As\n\nwell, the measurement of the spectral bidirectional reflectance factor\n\nof the gray panels by all instruments proved to be of great value in the\n\nproduction of comparable data.\n\n4. Techniques developed at NASA Goddard and adapted\'at Purdue for\n\nthe application of Barium Sulfate in a durable, highly reflecting coating\n\nfor reference surfaces for field instrumentation were used to produce\n\nreference panels for spectral reflectance factor calibrations. Four\n\n1.3 meter square panels were painted for use by the truck spectrometers,\n\ntwo 0.6 meter square panels were prepared for the modelling measuremients,\n\ntwo 0.3 meter diameter panels were also pointed for the JSC/FSAS system.\n\n5. Construction of an eight channel printing data logger was\n\ncompleted and conditioning cards were prepared to acquire\n\n* five channels of temperature data from 00 to 450 C using\n\nThermilinear probes\n\n" four channels of Model 100 ERTS-Band Radiometer data and\n\n\none channel of PRT-5 data\n\n* eight channels of unconditioned data from 0 to 2.0 or 0\n\nto 20 volts.\n\nMajor features of the data logger include: two digits of sequential data\n\ncoding, one digit indicating the channel being printed, and 3 digits of\n\nmeasured data. The instrument will measure and print the data in a\n\nselected channel or scan and print sequentially up to and including a\n\nselected channel at a rate of about three channels per second. More\n\ncomplete documentation of the system is in progress.\n\n\n2.3-8\n\n\n6. Documentation was nearly completed for the bidirectional reflec\xc2\xad\ntance factor reflectometer designed to use the Exotech Model 20C and a high\n\nintensity source to make indoor measurements of large area samples. The\n\ndevice facilitates the comparison of pressed Barium Sulfate with the painted\n\nBarium Sulfate panels and has provided the basis for three investigations of\n\nthe reflective characteristics of soils. The document discusses the bidi\xc2\xad\nrectional nature of reflectance in accepted definitions and symbols. Result,\n\nfor typical sample surfaces--paints, soil, and cloth--are presented in\n\nseveral formats which are convenient for physical interpretation.\n\n\n2.3-9\n\n\nDATA PROCESSING AND REFORMATTING\n\nAfter the data have been acquired in the field they must be\n\nprepared for analysis. It is important that the data be calibrated\n\nconsistently and made available in comparable formats in order to make\n\nmeaningful comparisons among data acquired by the several sensors at\n\ndifferent times and locations. A second key step in the processing of\n\nall the data is to correlate the agronomic, meteorological, and photo\xc2\xad\ngraphic data with the spectral data and as fully as possible integrate\n\nthe various data types. To accomplish this the agronomic and meteorolog\xc2\xad\nical data are keypunched and entered on the digital tapes along with the\n\nspectrometer data.\n\nThis section summarizes the data processing and reformatting steps\n\nperformed by LARS and reports on the current status of the data.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe processing functions performed not only by LARS, but also by\n\nNASA/JSC and NASA/ERL have been previously described in detail in the\n\nField Measurements Project Status Report prepared in January 1976 by\n\nLARS. Thus, they will only be briefly summarized in this report.\n\nFigures 2.3-2 and 2.3-3 illustrate the major steps in processing the\n\nspectrometer data. The spectrometer data is calibrated to reflectance\n\nfactor using known Barium Sulfate standards and the data for each sensor\n\nis put in the same wavelength bands to facilitate comparisons among data\n\nfrom the several spectrometer systems being used in the project. The\n\nwavelength band intervals are 0.02, 0.05, and O.lOm for the regions\n\n0.4-1.4, 1.4-2.4,-and 2.7-14.Opm, respectively.\n\nThe multispectral scanner data processing is primarily reformatting\n\nfrom Universal to LARSYS format. The Landsat data are being multitempo\xc2\xad\nrally registered to facilitate their analysis.\n\nStatus\n\nThe status of preparation of 1974-75 mission data is summarized in\n\nTable 2.3-2. Processing of the 1974-75 data has been delayed while\n\n\nsoftware for handling the newer types of data and putting data into the\n\nfield measurements format have been prepared. Also, a number of unexpected\n\nproblems in instrument performance occurred which have required additional\n\nprocessing to correct. Software systems are now complete and all-pro\xc2\xad\ncessing of 1974-75 data will be completed by August 1976. Processing of\n\n1975-76 data has already begun and is expected to proceed much more\n\nsmoothly and quickly since the necessary software-and procedures have been\n\ndeveloped and tested.\n\n\nCalibationSpectrometerv\n\nCData Tape \n\nData Librarj Tape\n\n\n____>\n\nInstrument\nData\n\nQ\n\nCalibration\n\nData\n\nProcessing\n\n\n~Field\n-Recorded\n\n_401\n\nSDigital\n\n_\n\nAnalog-toconversion\n\n/Postp\nDaaWavelength\n\nCNField\n\nProcessing\nDigitataDatadBzand\n\n_-o.\n\n.rocessing:\nWvlnt\nStandardization\n\n4\n\nAnalog\n\nTape\n\no\n\nj\n\nGround\nObservatio\nData\n\n.>Kyuc\n\nField Measurement\nLibrary Tape\n\nand]\nOverhead\nand\nGround\n\nI\'\n-\n\nLibrary\nCatal6ging\n\nPFotogoapny\n\n"\'\nField Measurements\nFiimLibrary\n\nU)\n-\n\ns\n\nFigure 2.3-2.\n\nLARS Field Spectroradioneter Data P.rocessing\n\n\nDistribution\n\nrielu\necordea\nDigital\nTape\n\nCalibrated\niiilClbaonData\nLvaluation\nand\nTranslation\nProcessing\n\nQc\n\n\'\n\nFormat\nProcessing\n\nEdit\nCalibration\nData\n\ns\ncharts\n\nCalibratiOnd\n\nCalibration\nPanel\n\nReflectivity\nData\nTape-to-Film\nLog Sheets\'\niIor\n\nSih\n\ndareSigt .. s\nPhotography\n\nPhoto .\nInterpretatiOn\n\n---. >-\n\n7\n\nPA\nsheets\n\nI.\n\nLARS Library Entry\n\nFlight,\nLog\nsneets\n\nGround\nobservation\n\nPeriodc\n\nData\nPrcssn\n\nObservations\nMeteorlogical\nData\nSneets\n\nFSS Libraiy\nEntry\n\nLIBRARY\n\nProcessing\n\nData\nTape\n\nInventory\nOptical\nDeptn\nData\n\nGround\n\nObservation\na 2\n\n1\n\nmAsC\nInvntryDistribution\n-\'\nt\nF\ns\nField MeasurementsDistribution\nFilm Library\n\n/\n\nFigure 2.3-3.\n\nS-191 Data Processing\n\n\nLibrary\nCatalog\n\ny\n\n-2.3-12\n\n\nTable 2.3-2.\n\nSummary of 1974-75 Field Measirdments Data Preparation Status.\n\n\nLandsat MSS Data, CCT\'s and Imagery\n\n30 frames received and in library\n\nMSS and MMS Aircraft Scanner Data\n\n16 missions received at LARS\n\n6 missions reformatted\n\n10 missions available upon request\n\nFSS (S-191) Data\n\n20 missions received at LARS\n\n3 missions final processing complete and in libriry\n\n17 missions partially processed\n\n20C Spectroradiometer Data\n\n6 missions final processing complete and in library\n\n3 missions partially processed\n\n20D Spectroradiometer Data\n\n2 missions final processing complete and in library\n\n13 missions partially processed\n\nFSAS Interferometer Data\n\n3 missions received, processing complete, and in library\n\nASCS Inventory and Periodic Observation Data\n\n23 missions received and keypunched\n\nMeteorological Data\n\n18 missions received and keypunched\n\n\n2.3-13\n\n\nDATA QUALITY VERIFICATION AND EVALUATION\n\nAn important part of the field measurements project is the acquisi\xc2\xad\ntion of high quality, calibrated spectral measurements. To a large degree,\n\nthis depends on having a timely and quantitative method available for\n\ndetermining data characteristics. This information can be used (1) for\n\nidentifying sensor deficiencies which can be corrected and (2) by data\n\nanalysts in selecting data for analysis and in interpreting analysis\n\nresults. The importance of quantitative data verification has become\n\nincreasingly apparent to LARS as the project has progressed and this\n\nsection summarizes our initial efforts to strengthen this part of the\n\nproject.\n\nIn April 1976 a document describing our technicai recommendations\n\nfor data quality evaluation and verification for the spectrometer and\n\naircraft scanner systems was prepared. The key points of those recommen\xc2\xad\ndations are presented along with our current evaluation of data quality.\n\nData Quality Evaluations\n\nThe uncertainity of measurement for each of the spectrometer\n\nsystems has-been determined. For reflective data, the values are\n\n7, 10-15, and 8-29 percent for the LARS, ERL, and S-191 spectrometer\n\nsystems, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the LARS system\n\nproduces repeatable data from mission to mission. The high value for\n\nthe ERL data is due to misalignment of the first minor, but the system\n\nwas stable and it has been determined that the solar port data can be\n\nused to compute reflectances based on calibrations before and after the\n\noccurrence of the problem. The problem has been corrected in the data\n\nprocessing and the final data is expected to be similar to the LARS\n\ndata.\n\nThe FSS (S-191) data has exhibited an unusually high degree of\n\nuncertainity for certain missions which are attributed to collection of\n\ndata during partially cloudy periods, missing the calibration panel, or\n\ninstrument malfunctions. The latter is considered least likely and steps\n\nhave been taken to reduce the re-occurrence of the first two problems\n\n\nin 1976 missions.\n\nThe 24-channel MSS data has been plagued by data quality problems\n\nincluding banding, bit errors, saturation, and inoperative bands. By\n\naveraging pixels, i.e., degrading the spatial resolution, and other\n\npreprocessing stops, the data quality has been substantially improved\n\nand high classification performances have been achieved with the data.\n\nInsufficient amounts of MSS data have been received to evaluate its\n\nquality.\n\n\n2.3-1:4\n\n\nData Quality Determination\n\nRecommendations for determining data quality have been prepared\n\nand submitted to NASA/JSC. Some of the initial steps would be carried\xc2\xad\nout by JSC, with the final quantitative steps performed by LARS. The\n\nkey steps are summarized here for the aircraft scanner, helicopter\n\nspectrometer, and truck-mounted spectrometers.\n\n1.\n\nAircraft Multispectral Scanner\n\n\nThe first step in collecting high quality data in the field is\n\ndetermined acceptable limits of illumination. We have recommended the\n\nuse of a recording total incidence pyranometer to determine quantita\xc2\xad\ntively and at a glance whether illumination meets the minimum require\xc2\xad\nments.\n\nHistograms of data can be used to determine detector operation, bit\n\ndropping or favortism, dynamic range, sensitivity, and saturation.\n\nSeveral quantitative measures based on analysis of histograms of each\n\nc\ndata \t hannel have been defined. These include: (1) serial correlation\n\ncoefficient to determine low order bit errors, (2)\'peak relative change\n\nin frequency to determine high order bit errors, and (3) percentage of\n\nsaturated data points to detect improper range and/or offset settings.\n\nIn addition, a comparison of NEAp and NEAT with sensor performance\n\nspecifications as a measure of system noise, and determination of the\n\nnumber of line synchronization errors is recommended. Threshold levels\n\ndenoting unacceptable performance have been defined for each of these\n\nmeasures. Further tests to determine the correspondence between the\n\ndata quality indicators and classification performance are required and\n\nshould be carried-out during the coming year.\n\n2.\n\nFSS (S-191) Data\n\n\nMajor factors contributing to the uncertainity of helicopter\n\nspectrometer data are, in order of importance, clouds, calibration\n\nprocedures, atmospheric conditions, instrument performance and, data\n\nprocessing system performance. The requirement for sensor performance\n\nevaluation has long been recognized and quick-look and other, more\n\nextensive, instrument tests are routine. To establish a measure of the\n\nuncertainty and causes of uncertainty throughout the system, the following\n\nsteps have been recommended:\n\n(1) \tA record of the total irradiance at the helicopter\n\ncalibration site as a function of time to determine\n\nthe illumination conditions.\n\n(2) \tA calibration uniformity test. After a cosine cor\xc2\xad\nrection for sun angle the calibration spectra should\n\nke nearly identical.\n\n\n2.3-15\n\n\n(3) Histogram tests for the processed data to indicate\n\nproper A-D conversion. These tests would be similar\n\nto those described for the scanner data.\n\n(4) A system performance test utilizing measurements of\n\na series of gray-scale calibration panels.\n\n3. Truck Spectrometer Data (Exotech 20C, Exotech 20D, FSAS)\n\nMajor factors contributing to the uncertainty of truck spectro\xc2\xad\nmeter data are, in order of importance, calibration and operation pro\'\n\ncedures, calibration frequency, instrument performance, atmospheric\n\nconditions, and data processing system performance. In the case of the\n\nFSAS interferometer system it is diffcult to separate the data proces\xc2\xad\nsing from the instrument; but, with software changes and hardware\n\nrefurbishing and improvements, operational and calibrational procedures\n\nshould become the limiting factors on the performance of this system.\n\nTo establish a measure of the uncertainty and causes of uncertainty\n\nthroughout these systems, the following steps have been recommended:\n\n(1) Operational and calibration procedures which include\n\n(a) frequent checks of alignment of the field of view\n\nand (b) calibration using large Barium Sulphate panels.\n\n(2) \t record of total irradiance at the site as a function\n\nA\nof time.\n\n(3) A calibration uniformity test similar to the one described\n\nabove-for the S-191 data.\n\n(4) Histogram tests for verifying analog to digital con\xc2\xad\nversion similar to the ones described for the scanner\n\ndata.\n\n(5) A system performance test including measurements of\n\ngray-scale calibration panels. Spectra would be\n\nexamined for continuity, form, and magnitude.\n\n\n2.3-16\n\n\nDATA LIBRARY\n\nThe field measurements data library contains a broad spectrum of\n\ninformation collected for the three agricultural test sites in Finney\n\nCounty, Kansas, Williams County, North Dakota, and Hand County, South\n\nDakota. Data is collected at the agriculture experiment stations and\n\nthe LACIE intensive test sites in Finney County and Williams County;\n\nbut, only over the LACIE intensive test site in Hand County. For the\n\nFinney County and Williams County sites, canopy modelling data is also\n\ncollected over a commercial wheat field.\n\nLARS is the central facility for storage and dissemination of\n\nfield measurements data being collected over the above three test sites.\n\nThe organization of the library is shown in Figures 2.3-4, 5, and 6.\n\nA computerized catalog listing of all data in the library is\n\ncurrently being prepared and should be available by August 1976. The\n\nlisting will contain key items of information for each data run. A\n\nrun is an individual observation or scan of spectrometer data, a flight\xc2\xad\nline at a given altitude of aircraft scanner data, or for Landsat data\n\nthe entire test site. The items describing each run include: mission\n\ndate, time, location, crop, sensor, and type of data (reflective and/or\n\nthermal), plus the run number uniquely identifying each item of data.\n\nA summary of the spectral data currently in the library is shown\n\nin Table 2.3-3.

These were\n\nsupplemented by visits of several LARS staff members to JSC as well as\n\nto the three test sites. Meetings were also held at Purdue in September\n\nand at Texas A&M in March with data users from ERIM, and Colorado\n\nState and Texas A&M Universities. As part of our technical coordination\n\nrole, LARS prepared an update of the project plan in August 1975 and\n\nan overall project status report in January 1976.\n\n\n2.3-22\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS -AND RESULTS\n\nAnalytical results have been obtained for three expriments\n\nconducted with field measurements data acquired..at Willistn, North\n\nDakota during the summer of 1975. Brief summaries of the major results\n\nwill be presented in this report and complete, detailed reports of\n\neach of the experiments will be prepared in 1976.\n\nThermal Modelling of Spring Wheat Canopies\n\nThe primary obj ectives of the thermal modelling research"conducted\n\nduring 1975 at.Willston, North Dakota were threefold:. (I) to. measure\nand identify the spectral characteristics of the radiance of crop canopies.\nfrom 2.7-14.0pm that are relevant to remote sensing applications, (2)- to\nmeasure the daily transient, temperature .proftles in selected crop\'canopies\nand interpret these profiles in terms .of agronomic and environmental\nparameters on a temporal basis-, and (3) to relate the measured spectral\n\nradiance to canopy temperature profile.\n\nUsing the observations on selected: spring wheat canopies primarily\n\nin the greenand mature stages of development, the thermal\' modelling\n\nanalysis has treated three major topics which are discussed.\n\n1. Spectral Radiance Characteristics in the Thermal Infrared\n\nThe-spectral radiance, LX, of the test canopy was measured by the\n\nExotech 20C spectroradiometer in the thermal infrared spectiral region,\n\n2.7-14 pm, using observation and calibration procedures, described in\n\nprevious publications,by the LARS/Measurements group. In addition to\n\nspectral radiance as a function of wavelength, the data set contains.\n\nall the relevant thermal,. agronomic and environmental parameters that\n\nare necessary to more fully characterize the canopy.\n\nThe spectral radiance of a typical,mature crop canopy- for the\nwavelength region 2.7 to 14.Opm is shown in Figur 2.3-7. Physical\ninterpretation of the observations in this-form is difficult as. only. a\nfew gross features can be discerned such as the wavelength at which the\nspectral radiance peaks and atmospheric absorption bands. It should be\nmentioned that the observations are generated in two spectral segments\nsince the atmospheric-water absorption effects between 5.5 and.7.0pm\nare so large.\nTo identify important physical features of the spectragl.radiance\n\nspectra, the following analysis was performed. The temperature, TR,\n\nat which the Planck function, Lb(X,TR), describing the spectral radiance,\n\nLX, at 4.6pm for the 2-6m region and at 11.21im for the 6-14pm region\n\nwas determined. These matching wavelengths were selected on: the basis\n\nthat atmospheric absorption, target anomalies (the silicarestrahlen\n\nphenomena for example) or reflected solar irradiance effects-should be\n\n\n2.3-23\n\n\nI\xc2\xad\n\n-J\n\n-z\n\nC\n-a\n\nr\n\n:zo. \xc2\xad\n\noII IF.m\n\nO\n\n)Ij\n\nWAVWELENGTH (MICROMETERS)\n\nFigure 2.3-7.\n\nObserved Spectral Radiance of a Typical Mature Wheat\nCanopy (Plot 52, 1627GMT, July 1976).\n\n2.3-24\n\n\nminimal. The difference in the observed canopy spectral radiance, L.,\nand the Planck function, Lb ( ,TR), was then shown as a deviation plot\nin Figures 2.3-8 and 2.3-9 were the deviation, DEV; is:\nDEV = L-L( 1TR).\n\nThese deviation curves are amenable to physical interpretation. First,\n\nnote the-deviations are zero at the wavelength match points 4.6 and\n\n10.5pm in Figures 2.3-8 and 2.3-9, respectively. In Figure 2.3-5, two\n\ntwo important effects can be seen; the positive deviation in the 3-4pm\n\nregion indicates the presence of reflected solar irradiation while the\n\nnegative deviations at 4.3pm and beyond 5.Opm can be explained by CO2\n\nand H20 absorption bands. The deviation plot of Figure 2.3- for the\n\nspectral region 6-14pm is less simple to interpret. The positive devia\xc2\xad\ntions are likely to be atmospheric emission bands while the negative\n\ndeviation is a restrahlen phenomena resulting from, in this case, the\n\npresence of silica in the soil which may constitute a portion of the\n\ntarget.\n\n\nFrom more detailed consideration of these figures using procedures\n\nnot reported in this abbreviated account, the following conclusions can\n\nbe obtained from analysis of the deviation plots: (1) The spectral\n\nreflectance of the target can be estimated in the 3.5-4.Om region;\n\nthis has been done for bare soil (typically 13%) and for full green\n\ncanopies (typically 3%). Analysis has been performed on selected\n\ncanopies to show that these reflectance values correlate in a rational\n\nmanner with leaf area index, percent ground cover, and biomass per unit\n\narea and (2) the observed spectral radiance in the 4.6-4.8pm spectral\n\nregion results almost exclusively from the target emission. The conse\xc2\xad\nquences of the last two conclusions are very important and allow for the\n\nreliable determination of the spectral radiance temperature.of the canopy.\n\nFurther discussion on this will be presented in a later section.\n\n2. Canopy Temperature Profile Measurements\n\nThe second objective of the past year\'s thermal modelling research\n\nactivity was to measure temperature profiles in selected crop canopies\n\nand interpret these profiles in terms of agronomic and environmental\n\nparameters on a temporal basis. The purpose of these measurements was\n\nto learn in what manner temporal variations of leaf temperature, canopy\n\nair, and soil temperatures might-be important to the remote sensing\n\nproblem. The thermal radiation emitted by a canopy originates from\n\nsurfaces (leaves, stems, and soil) that are at different temperatures\n\nand consequently the remotely sensed spectral radiance of the canopy will\n\nbe dependent upon the temperature profile in a very complicated manner.\n\nThree adjacent canopies (Plots 52, 53, and 54) were selected for\n\nprofile temperature measurements in-addition to detailed radiometric\n\nand agronomic observations. Using thermistor probes, Yellow Springs\n\nInstrument Co., Type 705, the temperatures with the canopy at the\n\nfollowing locations were observed:\n\n\n2.3-25\n\n\nWAlVELENGTH\n\n-\n\n111Cr\n\nE\n\nS )TERS\n\n_\n\n"_V\n\nI\n\nFigure 2.3-8.\n\nDeviation of Typical Canopy Radiance from Blackbody\n"Radiance in the 2.8 to 5.6pm wavelength region\n\n-.\n\n*\n\ni\n\nZ.0\n\naY\n\n-\n\nk\n\n1X 0\n\n1\n\nWC;V" ti\'GTH k(Mi CR6METERS)\n\n2 00 V1.oo\n\naa\n\nFigure 2.3-9. \tDeviation of Typical Canopy Radiance from Blackbody\n\nRadiance in the 7.0 to 13.3pm wavelength region.\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF1 POOR QUALITY\n\n2.3-26\n\n\nProbe #\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nLocation\nSoil Surface, bead just covered with soil\nSurface air temperature, approximately 5cm above the soil\nFirst green leaf\nFlag leaf\nAir temperature, approximately 10cm, above the canopy\n\nIn some instances subsurface soil temperature at various depths\n\nwere measured but not collected as a matter of routine. The probes\n\ndescribed in the above table were mounted on a stake assembly which\n\npermitted easy placement in the canopy with minimum disturbance. In\n\norder to obtain a meaningful average three such stake assemblies were\n\nlocated on the circumference of a 3m diameter circle which bounded the\n\nradiometric observation target.\n\nFigure 2.3-10 represents the temperature profile within a typical\n\nmature canopy (Plot 52, 27 July 1976) as a function of time. The\n\nprobe positioning is as described in the above table; in addition two\n\npoints at 1650GMT and 2225GMT are shown for measurements of spectral\n\nradiance temperature using the Barnes Model PRT-5 radiation thermometer.\n\nInterpretation of these observations without consideration of the solar\n\nirradiance, ground cover, and other canopy characteristics is not very\n\nmeaningful. The purpose in presenting this figure is to illustrate the\n\nnature of the temperature profile observations that have been made.\n\nThe extent to which such information can be useful in thermal\n\nmodelling studies is shown in Figure 2.3-1 and illustrates the vari\xc2\xad\nability of-temperature between the three adjacent canopies during the\n\nday. The ordinate, maximum temperature difference, is defined as the\n\nmagnitude of the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures\n\nmeasured by similar probes in the three different plots (Plots 52, 53,\n\n54; 27 July 1975) tested as a function of time of day. The purpose in\n\nplotting the observations in this manner is to show what temperature\n\nvariations are likely to occur between canopies with differing charac\xc2\xad\nteristics; that is, what kind of temperature differences are likely to\n\nexist at any one time under identical environmental conditions. The\n\ncurve for probe number 1, soil surface temperature, indicates that at\n\n2030GMT (1530 local time and approximately 90 minutes after solar noon)\n\nthe maximum difference in soil temperature between the three plots\n\namounts to 9.40C. For other probe locations the variability between the\n\nthree plots is less in magnitude and shows less temporal variation. The\n\nexception is the temperature of the first green leaf which shows a very\n\nmarked change in variability during the day.\n\nThese observations are still under analysis and some progress has been\n\nmade in explaining the temperature profile in terms of the agronomic and\n\nenvironmental parameters. An extensive data archive has been organized\n\nthat will permit ready access to the temperature profile measurements\n\nand other measurements made at the same time on these canopies..\n\n\n2.3-27\n\n\n400\n\n0 prionc 02\nb PAODE of\n\n4 6D\n0 PRDDC 3\n440 \n\nPROE-5\n\n.\n\nVPRT-5\n\n420j\n400\n\n\n" 340\n\n300\'\n2S01\n260\n240\n220\n\nI\n1500\n\n600\n\n1700\n\n100\n\n9O\'0\n\n2000\n\n210\n\nI\n2200\n\n[\n23W00\n\n2400\n\nTime of Da (CIAT)\n\nFigure 2.3-10.

Spectral Radiance Temperature Measurements\n\nThe spectral radiance temperature, T (A) \n a target is defined\n\n, of\nas the temperature of a blackbody having the same spectral radiance as\n\nthe target. Using Wien\'s approximation to the Planck function, the\n\nrelationship between the target temperature, T, and its spectral radiance\n\ntemperature, Tft(X), is given as\n\n\n1 1 + X!nc\nT\n\nTR\n\nC2\n\n\nwhere the temperatures are in absolute units (K), C2 = 14,388pm.K\n\nis the Second Radiation Constant, and eA is the spectral emissivity. If\n\nthe spectral bands over which the measurement is made is greater than say,\n\n10% of the wavelength at the center of the band, then th6 derivation must be\n\nmodified to properly define an effective waielength at which the spectral\n\nradiance temperature is to be associated.\n\nIn the thermal infrared, the spectral emissivity of most natural\n\ntargets is near unity but it should be quickly pointed out that a small\n\nvariation in the emissivity has a large effect in the difference between\n\nthe target temperature and the spectral radiance temperature as can be\n\nseen in Table 2.3-4. At the shorter wavelengths where the spectral\n\nemissivity may be in the 0.95 to 0.97 range for canopies and 0.85 to 0.90\n\nfor bare soils, the difference between radiometrically deduced temperatures,\n\nT ,and temperature may differ by\nto 50C. In the longer wavelength region,\n\nlke near 10im which may approximate the effective wavelength of the\n\nBarnes Model PRT-5 radiation thermometer, variations in spectral\n\nemissivity from a value of unity are much less-suspected to be 0.97 to 0.99\xc2\xad\nfor all types of targets; hence the difference between the temperatures\n\nso deduced would be quite small and probably less than 20C.\n\nAn objective of the thermal modelling study is to relate the\n\nspectral radiance temperature-the parameter which is remotely sensed-to\n\nthe temperature profile within the canopy as determined by contact sensors.\n\nIn addition to the canopy emissivity effect discussed in the previous\n\nparagraph, it is necessary to consider what effect the temperature\n\ngradient within the canopy has on the remotely sensed spectral radiance\n\ntemperature. This obviously is a complicated radiation transfer problem\n\nand the intent is to develop some understanding through parametric anal\xc2\xad\nysis much of which still remains to be performed.\n\nThe Figure 2.3- provides a comparison between the spectral radiance\n\ntemperature (Barnes Model PRT-5, 8-13m spectral region) and the canopy\n\ntemperature profile. For the two times of day, 1650 and 2225GMT, the\n\nlocation in the canopy which most closely agrees with the spectral\n\nradiance temperature is that of the air just above the surface of the soil,\n\nProbe 2. Further analysis and additional temporal observations are\n\nnecessary before this statement can be generalized. Particularly inter\xc2\xad\nesting will be to determine whether the most representative temperature\n\nis that of the soil surface air or the temperature of the air just above\'\n\nthe canopy as is currently thought to be most important.\n\n\n2.3=30\n\n\nTable 2.3-4. \t The Difference Between Spectral Radiance Temperature T (X)\n\nand Temperature, T, as a Function of Spectral Emissiviy\n\nand Wavelength for Target Temperature of 30\xc2\xb0C.\n\n\nSpectral\nEmissivity,\n\nTR(X) - T, K or\xc2\xb0C\neX\n\n1.G0 \t\n\nx = l m\n\nX=5 m\n\nJ\n\n.\n\n= 10pm\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.99 \t\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.32\n\n-0.64\n\n\n0.98 \t\n\n-0.13\n\n-0.64\n\n-1.28\n\n\n0.95 \t\n\n-0.33\n\n-1.63\n\n-3.26\n\n\n0.90 \t\n\n-0.67\n\n-3.36\n\n-6.71\n\n\n0.85 \t\n\n-1.04\n\n-5.21\n\n-10.4\n\n\nO_0\n\n\n0.00\n\n2.3-31\n\n\nA comparison of spectral radiance temperatures on the wheat canopies\nis possible by the analysis of spectral radiance observations from the\nExotech spectroradiometer as shown in Figures 2.3-8 and 9. As discussed\nin the test associated with these figures, it was assumed the spectral\nradiance at 4.6pm and lI.25pm was due only to target emission and hence\nthe spectral radiance temperature can be deduced as is reported in\nTable 2.3-5 for adjacent test Plots 52, 53, and 54 on 27 July 1976. Also\non this same table are the Barnes PRT-5 observations (8-13pm band pass)\nand the spectral radiance temperature derived from appropriate averaging\nof the Exotech spectroradiometric observation over the 8 to014m spectral\nregion. It should be noted these two results are within + C agreement\nfor this limited set of observations; this is to be expected by virtue of\nthe instrument designs and calibration procedures. Further analysis on\nthe variation of T (X) as a function of wavelength (including bandwidth),\ncanopy characterisfics, and temperature profiles are still in progress\nand it is not appropriate to make generalized conclusions from the\nlimited observation sets examined.\nInterception of Sunlight by Wheat Canopies\n\nA new method utilizing a laser probe simulating sunlight has been\n\ndeveloped and used to calculate the sites and magnitudes of energy\n\ninterception by crop canopies. Initial results obtained for a spring\n\nwheat canopy are presented and discussed.\n\n1.\n\nDescription of Experiment\n\n\nThe geometrical characteristics of the wheat canopy in a commercial\n\ndurum wheat field-near the Agriculture Experiment Station were measured\n\nusing an inexpensive laser on July 27, 1975 at Williston, North Dakota\n\nwhen the wheat was fully headed. Use of the technique allows the pre\xc2\xad\ndiction of direct solar power and energy interception as a function of\n\n(1) leaves, stems, heads, awns, and soil, (2) depth into the canopy, and\n\n(3) time of day. The technique involves the use of the laser to statis\xc2\xad\ntically simmulate sunlight. The laser, mounted on a tripod, is aimed\n\nat the wheat canopy at a random zenith angle. The height above the\n\nground at which the beam strikes an object in the canopy is recorded.\n\nAlso recorded is the name of the object (i.e., leaf, stem, head, awn, or\n\nsoil) and the zenith angle of the beam.\n\nThe accuracy of the estimate of the attenuation of the direct\n\nsolar beam in the canopy is directly related to the number of measurements\n\nmade. Two hundred points were measured in the modelling field. Data\n\nanalysis involves averaging all points in a zenith angle \'window\'. If\n\nthere are 25 points in the window, then each laser hit is assigned a\n\nvalue of 0.04. One unit of sunlight is assumed to fall on the canopy at\n\na zenith angle corresponding to the averaging window. As the beam front\n\npenetrates the canopy and passes the height of a laser hit, 0.04 is\n\nsubtracted from the beam. Prediction of watts per unit-area intercepted\n\nby each-canopy component is accomplished by.multiplying the normalized\n\n\n2.3-32\n\n\nTable 2.3-5. \t Spectral Radiance Temperature as a-Eunction of Wavelength\n\nfor Three Adjacent Test Plots (27 July .1975)\n\nSpectral radiance temperatures., TR(A),\xc2\xb0C\nTime\n\nPlots\n\n1\n(GMT)\n\n2\n\n=\n\n4.6pm\n\nA -\n\nm1\n11.25im\n\n2\n\n1\n8-4m\n\nX : 8-13pm\n\n52\n\n1627\n\n33.7\n\n36.8 \t\n\n34.7\n\n34 .5\n\n53\n\n1625\n\n33.2\n\n34.0 \t\n\n33.1\n\n33.9\n\n\n54\n\n1623\n\n32.7\n\n33.6 \t\n\n33.9 \n\n\n33.5\n\n\n52\n\n2209\n\n41.5\n\n42.2\n\n41.9\n\n42.0\n\n\n53\n\n2211\n\n41.3\n\n4-2.1\n\n40.\'8\n\n41.9\n\n\n54\n\n2214\n\n42.0\n\n42.7\n\n42.5\n\n42.6\n\n\nNotes\n\nFrom Exotech Model 100 Spectroradiometer observations\n\n2 From Barnes Model PRT-5 observations\n\n\n.1\n\n2.3-33\n\n\nintensity calculated from the heights of the laser hits by the magni\xc2\xad\ntude of the solar flux.

Early in the morning and late in the afternoon\n\nall power was intercepted by the top most elements of the canopy. It is\n\nsignificant that very little power was intercepted by dead leaves near\n\nthe ground. Photosynthetically active leaves intercepted direct solar\n\npower only during relatively high sun angles. The presence of the grain\n\nheads significantly diminished the power reaching photosynthetically\n\nactive leaves which are located below the heads. Prior to heading the\n\nflag leaves of the canopy would intercept direct solar power throughout\n\nthe day. The magnitude of the power intercepted by heads remained almost\n\nconstant throughout the day.\n\nBidirectional Scattering Characteristics of Spring Wheat Canopies\n\n1.\n\nDescription of Experiment\n\n\nThe bidirectional scattering characteristics of a spring wheat\n\ncanopy in the "modelling" field at Williston, North Dakota were measured\n\non five dates during the 1975 growing season. On each date the LARS field\n\nspectroradiometer data acquisition system was used to obtain data\n\ncontinuously in wavelength, at eight azimuth and five zenith angles of\n\nview, and, weather permitting, at time intervals of one to two hours.\n\nLeaf area index, canopy biomass and other ground observation parameters\n\ndescribing the condition of the wheat canopy were measured on each date\n\nthat spectral data were collected.\n\nAnalysis of data obtained on July 20, 1975 has involved display\n\nof the data graphically. The canopy bidirectional reflectance and two\n\nother variables were displayed on each graph. Implementation of the\n\nplotting technique required several hundred individual graphs, each\n\ngraph displaying the data in a unique manner. The multidimensional\n\ncharacter of the data required the large number of graphs.\n\n2.\n\nResults\n\n\nAnalysis of the data using graphical techniques permitted the\n\nfollowing conclusions to be drawn:\n\n(1) The reflectance at nadir of the wheat canopy in the modelling\n\nfield during the day of 20 July 1975 was not constant. The magnitude of\n\nreflectance at nadir increases with time during the day at all wavelengths.\n\nThe increase during the day was about 100 percent in the red wavelengths\n\nand 30 percent in the near infrared.\n\n\n12>34 \n\n\n(2) The reflectance of the wheat canopy is .close to that of a\n\nlambertian reflector for data collected near solar noon in the visible\n\nregion of the spectrum.\n\n(3) The reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum\n\nis non-lambertian throughout the day.\n\n(4) The deviation of the reflectance from a lambertian assumption\n\nis most pronounced at all wavelengths early in the morning and late in\n\nthe evening. For an east-west azimuth angle the ratio .ofthe reflec\xc2\xad\ntance at 60.degrees zenith angle to the reflectanceiat ndditis,2.6 at\n\n23:lIGMT.\n\n(5) Except for two small regions of the spectrum,, the-spectral\n\nreflectance-as a function of zenith-and azimuth angles shows good\n\ncorrelation with the reflectance at nadir.\n\nThe measurements will be- epeated during- thel-9Y6 \t growingseason\nto verify the-relationships identified in the first yeart s data. Certain\n\nimprovements in the experimental procedure including sampling.-at more\n\nfrequent time intervals, more.replication of measurements, and more\ncomplete characterization of the.physical attributes of the wheat canopy\nwill be used during the second year.\n\n2.3-35\n\n\nSUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe activities of LARS in acquiring, processing, archiving, and\n\nanalyzing field measurements data during the past contract year have\n\nbeen presented. Results describing the reflective and thermal properties\n\nof wheat canopies were presented. More extensive reports describing\n\nthe analytical results obtained as well as several aspects of acquiring\n\nspectral measurements in field environments and quantitativelyevaluating\n\ntheir quality will be published early next year.\n\nA calibrated and fully annotated data containing spectral from\n\nseveral altitudes, agronomic, and meteorological measurements were\n\nobtained for winter wheat in Kansas and spring wheat in North Dakota\n\nduring the past year. The data form one of the most complete remote\n\nsensing data sets ever acquired and should prove useful for research\n\ndefining future remote sensing systems. Research results from the\n\nfield measurements data are beginning to come forth and many studies\n\nusing the data should be made in the next several years.\n\nExperience gained during the first year of the project is now\n\nbeing applied to the acquisition and processing of data being acquired\n\nduring the 1976 growing season. Procedures and systems developed\n\nand tested during the past year can be expected to result in smoother\n\noperation of the project, in improved data quality, and faster turn\xc2\xad\naround of data.\n\nSpecific recommendations for the field measurements effort during\n\nthe third and subsequent years include:\n\n- Acquisition of aircraft multispectral scanner data by a\n\nsystem with spectral bands from the entire optical\n\nportion of the spectrum.\n\n- Implementation of data quality evaluation and verifica\xc2\xad\ntion procedures for all sensor systems.\n\n- Additional efforts and resources devoted to characteri\xc2\xad\nzation of crop and soil conditions at the time of each\n\ndata collection mission.\n\n-\n\nDevelopment of plans for continuation of this type effort\nover new crops and locations. Specifically, the addition\nin 1977 of a test site for corn and soybeans in the Corn\nBelt is recommended. It is important to begin collecting\n\ndata and gaining additional insights into the production\n\nof these crops prior to the expansion of LACIE to other\n\ncrops.\n\n\n2.3-36\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe leader of the field measurements project at LARS is Marvin Bauer\n\nand the project manager is Larry Biehl.

The correct answer\n\ndepends upon the index of performance selected as well as the class of\n\napplications for which the sensor system is to be optimized.\n\nThere are several ways to attack this question; one is empirically,\n\ni.e. using experimental data to simulate various sensor parameter combin\xc2\xad\nations. It is the results of such a study which are to be reported in\n\nthis section.\n\nThe ability to derive information from remotely sensed data gathered\n\nat a given time rests upon five classes of parametric values. These are:\n\nThe spatial resolution and scanning characteristics\n\n1. \t\n2. \t\nThe spectral sampling and bands used\n\nThe signal to noise characteristics\n\n3. \t\n4. \t\nThe amount of ancillary data available\n\nThe classes to be used, i.e. the particular\n\n5. \t\ninformation desired\n\nIt is especially important to note that these factors are inter\xc2\xad\nrelated to one another. Thus, assuming an empirical approach, the\n\nproblem resolves itself to searching a five dimensional parameter space\n\nrelative to the index of performance. It is obvious that this search\n\ncannot be done in an exhaustive fashion due to the size of a five\n\nparameter space, i.e., the number of possible combinations of the\n\nparameters. In this study the search was localized around the proposed\n\nthematic mapper parameters , a region suggested by the state of the art\n\nof constructing spaceborne multispectral scanners and the expected cost\n\nfactors involved. Even so, it was necessary to limit the number of\n\ncombinations tested. The scope of this investigation was primarily\n\nlimited to three parameters - spatial resolution, noise level, and\n\nspectral bands although some variation in others was introduced.\n\nThere were two indices of performance used in this study. One was\n\nthe accuracy achieved on multispectral pixels drawn from the central\n\nportions of agricultural fields. In this case emphasis is places upon\n\nthe identification portion of the analysis task.\n\nThe second index of performance was the accuracy with which the\n\ncorrect areal proportions of each class in the flight line used could be\n\nestimated; this was done by determining the proportion of pixels assigned\n\nto each class by the classifier. In this case not only are \'pure" pixels\n\n\n.4-2\n\n\nfrom the central portion of agricultural fields involved, but so are\n\nmixed or multiclass pixels which overlap the field boundaries.\n\nThe general scheme of the study then was to simulate the desired\n\n\nparameter set by linearly combining the original pixels of the airborne\n\ndata (IFOV6 meters) to form simulated pixels of the desired IFOV, then\n\n\nto classify this flight line using a machine implemented Gausian maximum\n\nlikelihood pattern classification algorithm, and measure the index of\n\n\nperformance.\n\nParticipants in the study included groups from NASA/JSC, NASA/ERL,\n\nGISS, NASA/Goddard and Purdue/LARS. After the participants as a group\n\nagreed upon the algorithms for producing the simulated data, simulation\n\nsoftware was implemented at LARS. Simulation data sets were produced at\n\nthe LARS Computation Facility and made available to analysts at JSC, EEL,\n\nGISS, Goddard and LARS. It was believed that variations resulting in\n\nanalysis procedures and algorithms would enhance the value and credibility\n\nof the results. Indeed, this was the case as the results of the analysis\n\nrelative to the simulated variables were similar and corroborated each\n\n\nother.\n\nReported in this section is the work performed at LARS only.\n\n\nSimulation Techniques\n\nData Utilized - Both airborne multispectral scanner data and field\n\nspectrometer data were used in this study. The multispectral scanner\n\ndata was collected by the 24 channel MSDS system 2 aboard the NC-130 over\n\nthe Finney County, Kansas, and Williams County, North Dakota, LACIE\n\nintensive test sites during the 1974-1975 growing season. Seven flight\n\nlines of the MSDS data were processed to simulate proposed thematic\n\n\nmapper spacecraft data (Table 2.4-1). The spectrometer data was collected\n\nby the NASA/JSC FSS S191H system, NASA/JSC FSAS interferometer system,\n\nand the Purdue/LARS Exotech 20C system over the Finney and Williams\n\nCounties intensive test sites and agricultural research farms. The\n\nspectrometer data also included the data collected over the Purdue\n\nAgronomy Farm by the Exotech 20C system during the summers of 1972, 1973,\n\nand 1974. A description of the three spectrometer systems can be found\n\nin the LACIE Field Measurements Project Plan. The spectrometer data\n\nwere used to study wavelength band selections as well as to calibrate\n\nthe airborne data for purposes of determining the signal-to noise ratio.\n\n\nGround observations including crop types and field maps collected\n\nby USDA-ASCS personnel and color IR photography collected by the NC130\n\naircraft were used to support the multispectral scanner and spectro\xc2\xad\nmeter overflights. A discussion of the ground observations and\n\ndescriptions of the two intensive test sites can be found in the LACIE\n\nField Measurements Project Plan and in section 2.3 of this report. The\n\n\nground observations were found to be fairly complete and very accurate.\n\n\n2.4-3\n\n\nTable 2.4-1. \tMSDS\'Data Selected\n\nfor Simulation\n\n\nSite \t\n\nDate\n\nFlight\n\nComments\n\n\n* Williams County, N.D.\n\n6/22/75\n\n1\n\nPoor crop calendar dat\n\nWilliams County, N.D.\n\n6/22/75\n\n3\n\nPoor crop calendar dat\n\n\nFinney County, KS\n\n7/6/75\n\n1\n\nSerious banding\n\n\n* Finney County, KS \t\n\n7/6/75\n\n3\n\nModerate banding\n\n* Williams County, N.D.\n\n8/15/75\n\n1\n\nGood set\n\nWilliams County, N.D.\n\n8/15/75\n\n2\n\nGood set\n\n\nWilliams County, N.D.\n\n8/15/75\n\n3\n\nGood set\n\n\n* Those that were analyzed at Purdue/LARS\n\n2.4-4\n\n\nPreparation of Simulated Data - The simulation technique included\nspectral, spatial and radiometric considerations. A detailed discussion\nof spatial simulation algorithms is given in Appendix A. A general\ndiscussion of the simulation technique is given in this section.\na) Spectral Bands\n\nMSDS system spectral bands which best matched proposed Thematic\n\nMapper bands were selected. As seen in Table 2.4-2, the bands were\n\nrelatively well matched. A combination of two MSDS bands was required\n\nto simulate one infrared band. The MSDS .53-.63 micrometer band was\n\nunavailable, and the .57-.63 micrometer band was substituted for\n\nsimulation of the .52-.60 Thematic Mapper band. This substitution was\n\nrecognized as suboptimal but the best alternative. The .74-.91 micro\xc2\xad\nmeter band was simulated as a result of speculation that Thematic Mapper\n\nbands 4 and 5 may be combined. A total of eight bands, therefore, were\n\nsimulated.\n\nBands 4 and 5 were combined to form the .74-.91 micrometer band by\n\nequal weighted averaging after conversion to the reflectance domain. The\n\ncombination of thermal bands was similarly achieved using the radiance\n\ndomain.\n\nb) Mean Angle Response Adjustment\n\nA correction algorithm was applied to compensate for the non-uniform\n\nangular response characteristic due to the relatively wide view angle\n\nof the MSDS sensor. This effect is usually noted as one side of image\n\nnadir appearing-brighter than the other side. The primary cause of the\n\neffect is that the scanner sees illuminated portions of the target at\n\ncertain view angles and the shaded side at other angles. The correction\n\nmade was to normalize the average scene response for each look angle.\n\nThe normalization was made on each flight line independently. The method\n\nused for angle correction was:\n\n-compute the average response of each look angle\n\n*smooth the average to the least square error third order\n\npolynomial.fit\n\n*compute the inverse polynomial multiplicative correction\n\nfunction required to transform the polynomial curve to\n\na constant value\n\n*apply the correction function to each scan line\n\nc) Spatial Degradtion\n\nThe spatial degradation procedure assumed a Gaussian total system\n\nmodulation transfer funciton and compensated for aircraft scanner\n\ngeometric distortions of unequal size and spacing of picture elements\n\nrelative to scan look angle. Equations which define the method are given\n\n\n2.4-5\n\n\nTable 2.4-2.\n\nChannel\n\nCorrespondence of Thematic\nMapper and MSDS Channels\n\nThematic Mapper\n\nMSDS\n\n1\n\n.45 - .52pm\n\n.46\n\n2\n\n.5.2\n\n- .60\n\n.5\'7 - .63\n\n3\n\n.6-3\n\n- .69\n\n.64 - .68\n\n4\n\n.7-4\n\n- .80\n\n.76 - .80\n\n5\n\n.80 -\n\n.. 82 -\n\n.91\n\n6\n\n1.55 -1.75\n\n7\n\n10.4 - 12..5\n\n8\n\n.74\n\n-\n\n.91\n\n-\n\n..0pm,\n5\n\n.87\n\n1.52 -1.73\n1- .0+11.0 1\n\n10.0\n.76\n\n-\n\n.8.0+.82\n\n12.0\n\n- .87\n\n2.4-6\n\n\nin Appendix A. Figure 2.5-1 shows a conceptual illustration of the\n\nsimulated system spatial response. The simulated picture element in\n\nthe scan line direction has a Gaussian point spread function with the\n\nIFOV specified as the distance between the half amplitude points; the\n\nGaussian function is truncated beyond the 10 percent amplitude. In\n\nthe along track direction, the point spread function is square. Using\n\nthis definition of system point spread function, each degraded picture\n\nelement was computed as the weighted average of higher resolution MSDS\n\npicture elements. Center-to-center spacing of degraded picture elements\n\nwas equal to the width of the IFOV being simulated.\n\nThe aircraft scanner geometric distortion of unequal size and spacing\n\nof picture elements relative to scan look angle was accounted for. This\n\n"bow-tie" effect was factored into the computation of the weighting\n\ncoefficients used to compute degraded pixel values.. Since the coefficients\n\nused to counter the bow-tie effect were different for each simulated\n\nlook angle, new>weighting coefficients were-calculated for each simu\xc2\xad\nlated pixel.\n\nd) Reflectance Scaling\n\nCalibration of MSDS data was required to allow combinations of\n\nreflective bands as discussed above and to appropriately scale the data\n\naccording to specified LANDSAT dynamic range parameters, see Table 2.4-31.\n\nTo satisfy these requirements, calibration was achieved by:\n\n-assuming the scanner black-body calibration source response\n\ncorresponds to zero scene reflectance,\n\n-assuming the- scanner calibration lamp corresponds to a\n\nscene reflectance equal to the lamp equivalent reflectance,\n\n,and using linear interpolation from these two calibration points.\n\nLamp equivalent reflectance data was supplied by JSC. It was well\n\nknown that this method is not extremely accurate but it was believed to\n\nbe adequate for purposes of band combination and dynamic range scaling.\n\n\n01?

In this case, however, the input data noise level was\n\nextremely high and the noise level after spatial degradation was approxi\xc2\xad\nmately equal to the level specified for the LANDSAT-D system. To study\n\nthe effect of additional noise, however, specific quantities of noise\n\nwere added. \nNoise was added in the form of white Gaussian.random\n\nnumbers with standard deviation scaled to the desired noise equivalent\n\nreflectance. Additional details on noise considerations and.calibration\n\nrequirements necessitated are given in the section on evaluation of\n\nsimulated data.\n\nf) Implementation\n\nThe simulation-process was implemented in four computer.processing\n\nphases. The phases were:\n\n-selection of spectral bands from the MSDS 24 channel computer\n\ndata tape and reformatting the data into the LARSYS Version.3.1\n\ndata library.\n\n;scan angle response normalization\n\n\'band combination, spatial degradation, and dynamic range adjustment\n\n*addition of noise\n\nEach phase produced separate out-puts designed for analysis and pro\xc2\xad\ncessing in subsequent phases. Modularized processing had the advantage of\n\nproviding data for analysis which had been processed in various stages of\n\nsimulation. \n Ih addition, the methodreduced processing redundancies.\' For\n\nexample, a data set could be processed in phase four several times, each\n\ntime adding a different- level of noise, without the necessity of repeating\n\nprevious processing steps.\n\nA total of 62 data runs were prepared for analysis.. Four spatial\n\nresolutions were simulated for-three flights of four dates. \n Seven levels\n\nof noise were added to two flightlines. A list of data sets generated is\n\nshown in Table 2.4-4.\n\nEvaluation of the Simulated Data \n Examinations of the 24-channel\n\nmultispectral scanner (MSDS) data revealed the presence of problems which\n\nresulted in limiting its usefulness. The true impact. of the data problems.\n\nwere not known until simulation data were generated and classification\n\nresults completed. Data quality problems present in the data are banding,\n\nbit errors, saturation, and inoperative bands.\n\nBanding is evidenced in the imagery as alternating dark and light\n\nshading. \nThe frequency of the banding varied from three to\'sixteen scan\n\nlines per band cycle for the flightlines considered. The banding can be\n\nseen in all MSDS reflective spectral channels (1-13) and channels 21 and 22\n\nof the thermal data. Imagery illustrating the banding is shown in Figure\n\n2.4-2. The banding signal amplitude was 1-15 data counts with larger\n\namplitudes noted in spectral bands 1-8. \n It has been learned that the\n\n\n2.4-10\n\n\nSimulation Data Sets Generated for Analysis\n\n\nTable 2.4-4.\n\nLARS Run\n\n.Data\nCollected\n\nFlight\nLine\n\n75002730\n75002740\n75002750\n75002760\n\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\n\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\n75001730\n75001740\n75001750\n75001760\n\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\n\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n75003730\n75003740\n75003750\n75003760\n\nFinney\nFinney\nFinney\nFinney\n\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n75002430\n75002440\n75002450\n75002460\n\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\n\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n6/22/76\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n75001930\n75001940\n75001950\n75001960\n\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\n\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n7/6/76\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n75003830\n75003840\n75003850\n75003860\n\nFinney\n-Finney\nFinney\nFinney\n\nSimulated\nResolution*\n\nNoise\n\nAided\n\nNCAP\n\n\nTest\nSite\n\n75001830\n75001840\n75001850\n75001860\n\n\'Williams\nWilliams\nWilliams\nWilliams\n\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n8/15/76\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n75001731\n75001737\n\nWilliams\n\n8/15/76\n\n1\n\n30\n\n.0025, .005, .0075,\n.01, .015, .02, .03\n\n75001741\n75001747\n\nWilliams\n\n8/15/76\n\n1\n\n40\n\n.0025, .005, .0075,\n.01, .015, .02, .03\n\n75003731\n75003737\n\nFinney\n\n7/6/76\n\n3\n\n30\n\n.0025, .005, .0075,\n\n.01, .015, .02, .03\n\n\n75003741\n75003747\n\nFinney\n\n7/6/76\n\n3\n\n40\n\n.0025, .005, .0075,\n\n.01, .015, .02, .03\n\n\n*Reflective data only, all thermal data at 120 meterm\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nor POOR QUALITY\n\n\n2.4-11\n\n\n.64-.68 micrometer band\n\n6 meter IFOV\nFigure 2.4-2.\n\n6 meter IFOV\n\n\nUnprocessed MSDS data showing banding noise\n\n\n.64-.68 micrometer band\n30 meter IFOV\n\nFigure 2.4-3.\n\n11. 0-12.0 micrometer band\n\n\n10.0-12.0 micrometer band\n\n120 meter IFOV\n\n\nSimulated data showing reduced banding noise\n\n\n2.4-12\n\n\nbanding was probably caused by a loose mechanical joint within the detector\n\nhousing and vibration of certain signal cables. The spatial degradation\n\nprocess significantly reduced the banding. Imagery illustrating the extent\n\nof banding noise reduction is shown in Figure 2.4-3.\n\nSystem bit errors were noted in all spectral bands. This problem is\n\nillustrated in Figure 2.4-4. The histogram shows a much higher frequency of\n\noccurence of odd data counts than even. In addition, various higher order\n\nbit errors were indicated in various spectral bands. The bit errors tended\n\nto be masked by the spatial degradation process as illustrated in Figure\n\n2.4-5; nevertheless, the impact on information content of the data must still\n\nbe present.\n\nFull scale saturation (data count 255) was noted in several spectral\n\nbands of several flightlines. Saturation occured not only for roof top\n\nand highway data, but also for agricultural areas which are of interest for\n\nanalysis purposes. Saturated data points were omitted from all analysis\n\nsince their values do not represent an accurate measure of relative scene\n\nradiance.\n\nSensor spectral bands 4 and 15 were inoperative for all data collection\n\nmissions.\n\nAs discussed in another section, MSDS data were calibrated to reflectances\n\nusing available saturation reflectance data with the assumptions of zero\n\nelectronic offset and no atmospheric effects. This calibration was needed\n\nfor band combination and range adjustments. After initial simulation data\n\nsets \'were generated and distributed for analysis, a refined calibration pro\xc2\xad\ncedure was implemented. (The project time frame did not permit use of the\n\nrefined procedure during the simulation processing.) The primary purpose\n\nin implementing the refined procedure was to enable an accurate determination\n\nof signal-to-noise levels and to enable accurate addition of noise for simu\xc2\xad\n\nlation of data with higher noise levels.\n\nThe procedure followed in this\n\n\nrefined procedure was as follows.\n\nNear the time of a low altitude MSDS overflight, reflectivity spectra\n\nof five canvas calibration gray panels were determined by a truck mounted\n\nspectroradiometer system referenced to pressed barium sulfate powder. Gray\n\npanel reflectivities and MSDS response data were related through linear\n\nregression. The regression equation, transforming low altitude.MSDS data\n\nto absolute scene reflectivity, was then used to compute mean reflectivities\n\nof agricultural fields within the low altitude flightline, Being clearly\n\ndistinguishable in the high altitude MSDS data (actual panels were not),\n\nthese large fields were then used as calibration panels were in the low\n\naltitude case. Field reflectivities were related to MSDS high altitude\n\nrelative response data through linear regression yielding a linear function\n\nwhich could then be used to transform high altitude relative data to\n\n(absolute) reflectance.\n\n\nMSDS 8/15/75\n0.47\n\nWAVFLENGTH BAND\n\nLINE 2 WILLIAMS Co,., Ni DAKOTA\nUNPkOCESSEb\n\n\n0.49\n\n-\n\nl tt COUNTS\n\nEACH VERTICAL AXIS POINT REPRESENTS\n\n4023 1\n\n*4*4*\n\n2819 1\n1618 1\n")417 I\n\n*1\n\nq2161\n80151\n\n***\n\n68141\n\n*4***\n\n4412\n\n*4*4* 4**\n**\n\n*\nK-\n\nI\n\n**\n\n18\nV\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nt\n\n**\n\n**\n\n*Lt*\n\n1\n\n4\n\n********\n\n**\n\n48-4 1\n\n*4*"\n**4*4*4*\n\n*****4***\n\n32111.....*4*4t**......4I*4.....\n2010 j1i04120*43***4****50**0**4*\n96)681\n8407 1\n\n\n**4\n\n4*\n*\n\n4~** \n\n\n*\n\n**\n\nt\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n4\n\n4\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n100\n\n4\n\n*\n\n4\n\n*\n\n4\n\n4\n\n120\n\n110\n\n*\n\n130\n\n4\n\n*\n\n*\n\nB.ic\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n150\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n4\n\n*\n\n*\n\n160\n\n180\n\n17IP\n\n4\n\n*\n\n*\n\n3603 1\n\n2402 1\n\nI\n\n0\n\n\n*\n\n190\n\n*\n\n200\n\nDATA VALUE\nSERIES CORRELATION\n\n=\n\n-. 102005\n\nFigure 2.4-4\n\nPEAK PERCENTAGE CHANGE =\n\n98.22952\n\nPERCENT SATURATION =\n\nerrors.\n\nHistogram illustrating digitization bit \n\n\n0.19.\n\nMSDS 8/15/75\nWAVELENGTH BAND\n\n0.47 -\n\n0.49\n\nEACH VERTICAL AXIS POINT REPRESENTS\n\n1\n\n560\n\nI\n\n525\n\n35 COUNTS\n1\n\n700 1\n665 I\n630 1\n595\n\nLINE 2 WILLIAMS Co-, N.

Sigma was derived from the sixteen samples per scan line\n\ncollected as the scanner low black body calibration source was viewed.\n\nThe sixteen samples per scan line of calibration data were treated as\n\nan image and spectrally degraded in the same way as the ground scene\n\ndata producing one calibration sample per simulated scan line. The\n\nstandard deviation of the simulated calibration samples multiplied by\n\nB is the measure of noise used. Table 2.4-5 shows noise levels derived\n\nin this fashion. In addition, the B term was used to determine the\n\nmagnitude of random numbers required in order to add a specified level\n\nof noise.to the data. The standard deviation, a, of the random numbers\n\nrequired to add a NEAp of Na is\n\nNa\n\nB\n\nAnd finally, to test the functioning of the scan angle response\n\nnormalization algorithm, the 30 meter data from flight line 1, ND,\n\nAug. 15, 1975, was analyzed with a procedure intended to find if any\n\neffects of sun or scanner angle could be seen in the classification.\n\nThe flight line was divided lengthwise into thirds and training fields\n\nwere taken from each third. The three training sets were compared in\n\nthe SEPARABILITY processor and no apparent differences due to location\n\nacross the flightline could be seen. The flight line was also classified\n\nwith the combined training sets and again no differences associated\n\nwith training set locations were found in the classification.\n\nAnalysis Procedures Used\n\nEach analyst was allowed some freedom in the training set selection\n\nbut the procedures used did not differ greatly. Each analyst selected\n\nareas from-which training fields were taken. Two analysts elected to\n\ndivide the flightline into one mile wide strips across the full width\n\nand train on alternating strips. The other individual trained on\n\nalternating one mile sections. In each case, then, training sets were\n\ntaken from one half of the area and were distributed systematically over\n\nthe entire flightline. These candidate training areas were.clustered\n\nprimarily for image enhancement of the field boundaries so that the\n\ntraining fields could be more easily selected.

This was the definition of spectral\n\nsubclasses within fields and when subclasses were found the analyst\n\ncould adjust the training sets to sample them.\n\nColor infrared photographic mosaic prints were made from photo\xc2\xad\ngraphic data collected concurrently with the scanner data. Informational\n\nclass information provided by ground observations was transfered to\n\nclear plastic overlays on the mosiac print. The analyst could then\n\neasily locate the corresponding fields in his cluster maps and assign\n\nthe field coordinates to the informational classes.\n\nStatistics were calculated for each training area and compared\n\nusing the SEPARABILITY processor. Similar classes were combined, where\n\nindicated, and the data set was used to classify the flightline. Train\xc2\xad\ning areas were included in the test fields but actual field boundaries\n\ndid not necessarily correspond between the training and test fields\n\nsince the test fields had been pre-selected for the entire flightline.\n\nThe entire training set selection procedure was repeated for each\n\nresolution size so that any effects on training set selection which\n\nmight be caused by data point resolution size would be included in the\n\nanalysis results. An example,is the increasing difficulty and eventual\n\nimpossibility of selecting samples from small, or narrow, fields as the\n\nresolution size increases.\n\nThe two indices of performance previously mentioned were each\n\napplied in two ways. Classification (identification) accuracy was\n\nevaluated using both training and test sample performance while pro\xc2\xad\nportion estimation (identification and mensuration) was carried out\n\nover the flightline as a whole and as an average of portions of the\n\nflightline. Further details on each of these is as follows.\n\nThe training performance is the overall classification accuracy\n\n(number of training pixels correctly classified divided by the total\n\nnumber of training pixels) of the pixels used to calculate the indivi\xc2\xad\ndual class statistics. The test performance is the overall classifica-\n\ntion accuracy of the test field pixels. \n The test fields were selected\n\nin the original six meter data by choosing the largest rectangular block\n\nof pixels that would fit within the agricultural field so that no\n\nboundary pixels were included. The test field boundaries were then\n\nfound in the degraded spatial resolution such that no "super" pixels\n\n(degraded spatial resolutions) containing boundaries were included.\n\nSome of the original test fields were discarded in this process because\n\nthey became too small, i.e. there were no pure field center "super"\n\npixels.\n\nThe RMS error of informational class proportion estimates for the\n\nflightline was found by calculating the percent of the flightline\n\nclassified as a particular class and comparing it with the ASCS ground\n\ncollected esfimate using equation (I).\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POoR QUAUTY\n\n2.4-18\n\n\nN\nRMS Error\n\n=\n\n2\n\n1\n\nwhere N = number of informational classes\nCi = percent classified as informational class i\n\nCt.\n1\n\npercent of class i estimated from ASCS ground\n\ncollected data\n\nThe fourth criterion stated above was found using equation (1)\n\nabove on a section basis (approximately one square mile) and finding the\n\naverage RMS error of all the sections in the flightline. Each flight\xc2\xad\nline analyzed included a two by six mile area; so there were twelve\n\nsections in each flightline. The informational classes used for the\n\nthree flightlines are given in Table 2.4-6.\n\nLANDSAT 2 data for two of the flightlines were also analyzed, but\n\ntest fields were not selected for the LANDSAT data.\n\nResults\n\nSpatial Resolution Parameter - The results from classification for\n\nthe various IFOV\'s simulated indicate no significant trend in the train\xc2\xad\ning performance across the four resolutions (Figure 2.4-6 and Table\n\n2.4-6). The training performances were all hig% above 93%. The most\n\nchange occurred-in the 6/22 flightline which was probably due to the\n\ndifficulty caused by the poor crop calendar date mentioned above.\n\nThe test performance results, however, indicate a general upward\n\ntrend as the IFOV increases from 30 meters to 60 meters for two of the\n\nflightlines (see Figure 2.4-7 and Table 2.4-6). The third flightline\n\nshows a downward trend which again is probably caused by the difficulty\n\ndue to the stage of growth of the crops. The upward trend in the test\n\nperformance of the two flightlines is presumed to be caused by the better\n\nsignal to noise ratio in the larger instantaneous field of view (IFOV)\n\ndata. A 60 meter pixel is simulated by averaging approximately 100 six\n\nmeter pixels as compared to approximately 25 for a 30 meter pixel.\n\nThe number of test fields varied in inverse relation to the IFOV,\n\nsince as the IFOV increased, the probability that some test fields\n\nwould not contain any pure pixels increased. To determine if this\n\nsituation rather than improved signal to noise ratio might have caused\n\nthe upward trend in the classification performance for larger IFOV\'s\n\na common set of test fields were selected to test the performance of\n\nthe classifications. The test performance increased slightly, 0 to .7%,\n\nhowever, the trend was the same.\n\n\n2.4M19\n\n\nTable 2.4-6.\n\nInformational Classes Used in the Analysis\n\n\nWilliams County, N.

For each of the three data sets the percentage\n\nof field center pixels used for testing dropped an average of 10 percent\n\nfrom 30 to 60 meters.\n\nTable 2.4-7 also indicates that a significantly higher proportion\n\nof the Kansas flightline was used for testing than the North Dakota\n\nflightline. This is due to the larger field size in Kansas (see Table\n\n2.4-8). The differences between the 6/22 date and 8/15 date over the\n\nNorth Dakota flightline are due to the exclusions of anomolies (bare\n\nspots) in the centers of fields which were present in the 8/15 data and\n\nnot in 6/22 data. The rectangular test fields were reduced so that the\n\nbare spots would not be included in the test performance.\n\nThe RMS error of the proportion estimates for the flightline and\n\nthe average of twelve sections (see Table 2.4-6 and Figures 2.4-8 and\n\n2.4-9) indicate that the least error is obtained using a 30 meter spatial\n\nresolution. The RMS errors increased as the IFOV increased from 30\n\nmeters to 40 meters to 50 meters and then leveled off or dropped slightly\n\nas the spatial resolution increased from 50 meters to 60 meters. The\n\ntwo RMS errors increased again for the Landsat 2 data. The Landsat 1\n\nand 2 data have an IFOV of approximately 90 meters if the definition of\n\nspatial resolution being applied for the Thematic Mapper is used; the\n\nspatial resolution of Landsat 1 and 2 more commonly known as 80 meters.\n\nThe reduced error in the proportion estimates as the IFOV is reduced\n\nis due to the increased percentage of pure field center pixels to\n\nboundary pixels. The test performance criterion was based only on the\n\npure field center pixels. Many errors occur in delineating boundary\n\npixels because very often they aren\'t similar to either of the classes\n\nthat they represent. For example, a pixel including both bare soil and\n\nwheat may appear similar to grass.\n\nThe two criteria using RMS errors include the boundary errors,\n\nhowever, it should be noted that they aren\'t a direct measure of boundary\n\nerrors. It is possible for the boundary errors to cancel each other out\n\nover a given area so that the proportions estimates obtained from the\n\nclassifications are more nearly correct. \'This is the reason that the\n\nPMS error in the proportion estimates for the entire flight are smaller\n\nthan the average ENS errors of the twelve sections in the flightlines\n\nfor a given resolution. The RMS errors, however, are the better measures\n\nin comparing the differences of spatial resolutions because these\n\ncriteria are based on all pixels in the flightline. Better area\n\nestimates are possible with the smaller of the five IFOV\'s.\n\nAn analysis of variance was run on the RMS errors for the four\n\nresolutions using the RMS errors for the twelve sections in each of the\n\nthree flightlines to determine if the differences were significant.

Each of the noise added data sets were then classifiedusing\n\nsimulated Thematic Mapper channels 2, 3., 4, 5, 6, and 7. The-evaluation\n\ncriteria-of the noise level.parameter include the overall-training\xc2\xad\nperformance and the overall test performance.\n2.4-12 and Table 2.4-10.\n\n\nSeeiFigures 2.4-10 thru\n\nTo actually simulate different noise levels in-data, from.satellites,\n\nthe variable of analyst\'s determination,of field boundaries might have\n\nbeen included. This would,have necessitated the time .consuming routine\n\nof the selection of training areas from each noise added data.set ,\n\nindependently from the other sets. Tests were runwhich illustrated\n\nthat the-data clustered nearly the same for the noise.levels of .0025\n\nto .015 NEAP added. The field boundaries, however, were difficult to\n\ndistinguish in the cluster maps for the noise levels of .02 and .03 NEAP\n\nadded levels. In light of these results the performances found for the\n\n.02 and .03 NEAP noise added levels may be optimistic, since the field\n\nboundary delineation difficulty is not included.\n\nThe original plans were to simulate the .005 NEAP\'noise,.level\n\nplanned for the Thematic Mapper-for all channels (also .01 NEAP for\n\nchannel 6) together with .5, 1.3, 1.6, 2 and 3 times that-noise level.\n\nThe noise level present in the original MSDS data, however, was too.\n\nhigh for the original plans. After the averaging to simulate .30 to-60\n\nmeters,, the noise level for the channels were of the.same magnitude as\n\nplanned for the Thematic Mapper - the,0 added noise case. To simulate\n\nhigher levels .0025, .005, .0075, .01, .015, .02, and .03 NEAP (xlOO,\n\nfor NEAT) noise levels were added to the 0 added set. The calibration\n\nfor the noise addition was obtained using the grey panels-at the cali\xc2\xad\nbration location in the intensive test site and the truckmounted\n\nspectrome ric data is previously described.\n\nIn each of the four data.sets analyzed-across all eight noise levels,\n\nonce the level of noise added became greater than the noise already in\n\nthe data,. the train and test performances fell off significantly. It\n\nis difficult, however, to draw any conclusions relative to the Thematic\n\nMapper since the noise levels were not constant across all bands.\n\nSpectral Band Parameter - The first analysis technique for the\n\nwavelength band set as the parameter consisted of selecting: training\n\nareas to represent spectral classes from cluster maps obtainedusing\n\nsimulated Thematic Mapper channels - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 - the same\n\n\ntechnique as used for the spatial resolution parameter.\n\nThe simulated\n\n\nNoise Parameter\nOverall Train Performance\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\nResolution: 30/120 meters\nNoise: for 0 added\n\n.002-.008 NEAP, .09 NEAT\nNEAT\n.004-.023 NEAP,\n\n8/15-1\n9/6-3\n\n100\n\n0\nN\n\nu\n\n\'-\n\n0\n144\n\n"N\n\n0"4\n\np\n\n14\n\ni\n\n80\n\n0\n\n.02\n\n.01\nFigure\n\n2.4-10\n\n.03\n\nNoise added (NEAP o, NEAT)\n\n(X.\nlO0)*\n\nco\n\nNoise Parameter\nOverall Test Performance\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\nResolution: 30/120 meters\nNoise: for 0 added\n\n.002-.008 NEAP, .09 NEAT\nNEAT\n.004-.023 NEAP,\n\n100\n\n4j\nC)\np\n\n0\n\n0\n\n90\n\n0\n0\n\n9\nUN\n\n0\nFigure 2.4-11\n\n.01\n\n.02\n\nNoise Added (NEAP or *NEAT)\n\n\n.03\n\n(x\n\n00)*\n\n\n8/15-1\n7/6-3\n\nNoise Parameter\nOverall Train and Test Performance\nPer Point Classifier\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7,\n\nResolution:\n\n40/120 meters\n\n100\n\n8/15-1\n\n0\n\nU\n\n7/6-3\n\n0\n\nS\n\nN.\n\nTest\n\n90\n\n2\n\n\'N\n\nK\n\nTrain\n\n80\n\n.01\n\n0\nFigure\n\n2.4-12\n\n.02\n\nNoise Added (NEAP or *NEAT)\n\n\n.03\n\n(x 100)*\n\n\n-2\'.4-31\n\n\nTable 2.4-10\n\nResults of Noise Level Parameter Study\n\nSpatial Resolution - 30/120 meters\n\nOverall train performance (per cent correct)\n\nNoise level \xe2\x80\xa2added to original data (NBAP or *NEAT)\n\n\nSite - Date\n\n\n0\n\n.0025 .0050 .0075\n\n.-010\n\n.015\n\n.020\n\n.030\n\nKansas - 7/6\n\n98.8\n\n98-.5\n\n98.2\n\n97.2\n\n96.0\n\n93.6\n\n\'89.7 84.6\n\nN.

The results are given\n\nin Table 2.4-11 and Figures 2.4-13 and 2.4-14.\n\nThe four feature sets selected resulted from discussions at NASA/JSC\n\nconcerning possible ways to reduce the number of proposed channels to\n\nsix and attempts to grossly simulate the present Landsat I and 2 scanners.\n\nChannels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\nand 7 represent the originally proposed\n\nThematic Mapper channels . Channels subsets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 represent frequently discussed combinations of six\n\nchannels.\nChannel 8 is the combination of channels 4 and 5. Feature\n\nset 2, 3, 4 and 5 grossly approximately the same spectral range as the\n\npresent Landsat 1 and 2 scanners cover.\n\nThe results indicate that slightly higher performances are possible\n\nfor these data sets when Thematic Mapper channel 1 is included. The\n\nresults also indicate little or no change in performance if Thematic\n\nMapper channels 4 and 5 are combined into one channel. The differences\n\nare very small, however. An analysis of variance has not yet been run\n\nto determine if\'the differences were significant. It is possible that\n\nthe previously described unusual noise in the MSDS data is acting to\n\nminimize any significant differences due to spectral band changes.\n\nA second analysis technique relative, to spectral band selection is\n\nto study the correlation of the proposed Thematic Mapper (T.M.) channels.\n\nThis Was done for the agricultural crops in the intensive test sites and\n\nat the Purdue Agronomy Farm, sampling the growing season using spectro\xc2\xad\nmeter data. The correlation of the proposed Thematic Mapper band .52\xc2\xad\n.60m and the MSDS substituted band .57-.631m was also studied. Concern\n\nhad been raised that the .57-.63pm channel of the MSDS data did not\n\nrepresent the .52-.60pm Thematic Mapper channel well. Also included in\n\nthe correlation study were the Skylab S192 scanner bands which cover the\n\nrange between 1.0 and 1.3pm which the proposed Thematic Mapper does not\n\nat present include. The cross correlation tables thus derived are shown\xc2\xad\nin Tables 2.4-12 thru 2.4-17. Specifications for the data sets used\n\nare given in the Table captions.\n\nThe correlation of T.M. band .52-.60m and MSDS band .57-.63pm for\n\nthe agricultural crops given in the tables ranged between .93 and .99.\n\nThis tends to indicate that the use of the MSDS band .57-.63pm can\n\nrepresent the T.M. band reasonably well, even though the MSDS band\n\nincludes part of the slope between the green peak reflectance and the\n\nchlorophyll absorption band in the red.\n\nConcern has also been raised that T.M. bands .74-.80pm and .80-.911im\n\nare highly correlated or more strongly stated - entirely redundant.\n\nThe results of the correlation study support other studies showing that\n\nthe channels are highly correlated. The correlation of the two channels\n\nranged between .981 and .998. The plot.shown in Figure 2.4-15 illustrates\n\nthe high degree of correlation in the simulated channels using the MSDS\n\ndata for the entire 8/15 North Dakota flightline.\n\n\n2.A-33\n\nTable 2.4-11\n\nResults of Classifications Obtained for the Spectral Band\n\nParameter Using Simulated 30 Meter Data.\n\n\nOv\'arl\n\nTrain Performance (per cent correct)\n\n\nSite - Date\n\nFeature Set (Channels)\n\n1,2,3,6,,7,,B\n\n________243~45.,,I..l.2,,45~67. \n\n\n2,3,4,5\n\nKansas - 7/6\n\n98.8\n\n99.3\n\n99.0-\n\n90.5\n\n\nN.

Information in this\n\nrange may not be available in the other bands. The results for the\n\nobservations analysed support the above concern. The channels in the\n\n1.0-1.3pm range were correlated the most with Thematic Mapper channels\n\n4 and 5. However, the correlation of the 1.09-1.19im band and Thematic\n\nMapper bands 4 and 5 ranges between .87 and .99. More significantly\n\nthe correlation of the 1.2-1.3pm band and Thematic Mapper channels 4\n\nand 5 ranges between .50 and .98. The results suggest that useful\n\ninformation may be available in the 1.0-1.3pm range.\n\nIn general, Tables 2.4-12 thru 2.4-17 indicate that\'Thematic Mapper\n\nchannel 6, the middle IR channel, and Thematic Mapper channel 7, the\n\nthermal channel, arenot very correlated.with any of theother Thematic\n\nMapper channels. The visible channels tend to be correlated and\n\nThematic Mapper channels 4 and 5 are highly correlated. There may be\n\ngood reasons to move one of the .74-.80 im or .80-.91m\'bands into the\n\n1.0-1.3m range.\n\nClassifier Parameter - Two different classifiers were compared\nthe standard maximum likelihood pixel classifier.-and a spectral-spatial\nclassifier ECHO 4 . The simulated data over the North Dakota 8/15 flight\xc2\xad\nline and the Kansas 7/6 flightline-were used in the analysis. The\n\ntraining statistics for both classifiers were identical and were~obtained\n\nas described in the spatial resolution parameter ,discussion.\n\n-\n\nThe classifiers were compared across the four simulated spatial\n\nresolutions.for the North Dakota flightline and across four.noise levels\n\nfor the Kansas-flightline. The four criteria as described before were\n\nused to evaluate the classifiers across the spatial resolutions. The\n\ntrain and test performances were used across the noise levels.- The\n\nresults are illustrated in Figures 2.4-16 thru 2.4-19.\n\nThere was a slight but consistant increase in the training and test\n\nperformances for the ECHO classifier over the per point classifier at\n\nthe smaller IFOV\'s (Figure 2.4-16). This is consistent with thetheory\n\nbehind the ECHO classifier. Better classification accuracy should be\n\nobtainable as the number of pixels per object (field) increases. The\n\ndifferences between the classifiers are so small, however, :that they\n\nmay not be significant for this particular case.\n\nA very noticeable difference was observed,-however, when comparing\n\nthe classifiers across the noise levels (Figures 2.4-18 and 2.4-19).\n\nThe spatial nature of the ECHO classifier was able to provide enough\n\ninformation to help compensate for the added noise in the data. The\n\ndifference between the two classifiers became greater as the noise\n\nlevel increased.\n\n\nClassifier Parameter\n\nFL #i North Dakota 8/15\n\nOverall Train and Test Performance\n\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n\n00\n\n4-i\n\n-\n\n---\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-----\n\nI\n\nTrain\n\nC\nU\n\no-\n\nooK\n\n\nSPer Point\n\np44\n\n0\n\nEcho\n\n80\n30/120\n\n40/120\nFigure 2.4-16\n\n50/120 \n\n\nReflective/Emissive Resolution (m)\n\n\n60/120\n\n\nClassifier Parameter\nFL #1 North Dakota 8/15\nRMS Error of Proportion Estimates\nof Flight Line and Sections\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n20\n\nK\n\nPer Point\n\n0\n\nEcho\n\n10\n\n-\n\n--.\n\nAverage of Sections\nFlight Line\n\n0\n30/120\n\n40/120\n\n50/120\n\nFigute 2.4-17 Reflective/Emissive\nResolution (m)\n\nN\n\n60/120\n\n80\n\nClassifier Parameter\nFL #3 Kansas\n7/6\nOverall Train and Test Performance\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\nResolution: 30/120 meters\nNoise for 0 added set\n.004-.023 NEAP,\n\n100 -X\n\nNEAT\n\nPer Point\n0\n\n-\n\nEcho\n\nN\\\n\nN\n\n90\n\n.x------.\n\nNx, NTrain\nN\n\nTest\n80\n\nN\n\n0\nFigure 2.4-18\n\n.01\n\n.02\n\nNoise Added (NEAP or *NEAT)\n\n\n.03\n\n(x 100)*\n\n\nClassifier Parameter\n7/6\nFL #3 Kansas\nOverall Train and Test Performance\nChannels: 2,3,4,5,6,7\nResolution: 40/120 meters\n\n100\n\'Per Point\n0\n\nEcho\n\n\\ Train\n\no\n\n(U\n\n90\n\n\\ Test\n\n\\\n\n00\n4Jx\n\n\'\n\n80\n\n\\\\"\nN0\n.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n.0\n\n.0\n\n.0\n\nx0)\n\n2.4-48\n\n\nThe results indicate that as spectral-spatial classifier is-an\n\nimprovement over the per point classifier. More research needs to be\n\ndone with the ECHO classifier, however, to determine the affects of the\n\nmany parameters that can be changed in the ECHO classifier. It is\n\npossible that the optimum classifications using the ECHO classifier was\n\nnot obtained because of the lack of knowledge concerning the ECHO para\xc2\xad\nmeters.\n\n\n2.4-49\n\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the introduction, the five sets of parameters which influence\n\nthe ability to extract information from multispectral data were listed\n\nand it was pointed out that the problem of properly-selecting scanner\n\nparameter values amounts to searching the five dimensional parameter\n\nspace thus defined relative to the desired index performance. This\n\nstudy was structured, within the constraints imposed \'by the data sets\n\navailable, to search a portion of this five dimensional space. The\n\neffect of at least some variation in all but the fourth parameter class\n\nwas tested. Significant features of the study were as"follows:\n\n1. \tThe index of performance used ehcompassed both identification\n\naccuracy and mensuration accuracy.\n\n2. \tData from two times of the year was used.\n\n3. \tData from two quite different parts of the U.S\'. Wheat Belt\n\n,was used. Even so only a small part of world agriculture\n\n\nand world vegetation was sampled.\n\n4. \t\nThe impact of the affect of a human analyst was allowed in\n\nthe study in that three different analysts, usihg slightly\n\n-different analysis techniques, w4ere used. As would be\n\n\' desired, there is no indication that this affecte\'d the\n\n\nresults.\n\nBoth training sample accutacy and test sample accuracy \'wereused\n\nto evaluate the various tests, the former because it teiid to minimize\n\nthe impact of variations in the scene. However, in this study it was\n\npossible .to achieve such high training accuracies that the residual\n\nvariations in performance shown by training sample accuracy tended to\n\nbe random and the test sample accuracy appears to provide the more\n\nreliable indicator of the impact of the various parameters on identi\xc2\xad\nfication accuracy. The two RMS proportion estimation error indicators\n\n\nwere devised to provide the indication of combined identification and\n\nmensuration performance. Of these two, the RMS proporation estimation\n\nerror for the entire flightline appears to provide the more sensitive\n\nindication to the impact of changing the various parameters of interest\n\nas compared to the tverage RMS error by sections.\n\nThe-major conclusions from the study are as follows:\n\n1. \tThere was a very small but consistent increase in identification\n\n\naccuracy as the IFOV was enlarged.\n\nThis is presumed to stem\n\n\nprimarily from the small increase in signal to noise ratio\n\nwith increase in IFOV.\xc2\xad\n2. \tThere was a more significant decrease in the menurition\n\naccuracy as the IFOV was enlarged.\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALrj\n\n2.4-50\n\n\n3. \tThe noise parameter study proved somewhat inconclusive due\n\nto the greater amount of noise present in the original MSDS\n\ndata than desired. For example, viewing Figure 2.4-11\n\nmoving from right to left, it is seen that the classification\n\nperformance continues to improve as the amount of noise\n\nadded is decreased until the point is reached where the noise\n\nadded approximately equals that already initially present due\n\nto the MSDS operation. Thus, it is difficult to say for what\n\nsignal to noise ratio a point of diminishing return would\n\nhave been reached had the initial noise not been present.\n\n4. \tThe result of the spectral band classification studies may\n\nalso be clouded by the noise originally present in the MSDS\n\ndata. The relative amount of that change in performance due\n\nto using different combinations of the .45-.52pm, .74-.80pm,\n\n.80-.91pm and .74-.91pm bands is slight but there appears to\n\nbe a slight preference for the .45-.52m band. The perfor\xc2\xad\nmance improvement of the Thematic Mapper channels over those\n\napproximating Landsat I/II is clear however.\n\n5. \tUsing spectrometer data it was verified that the .74-.80m\n\nand .80-.91m bands are highly correlated.\n\n6. \tCorrelation studies also showed that the range from 1.0-1.3pm\n\nis likely to be an important area in discriminating between\n\nearth surface features.\n\nAlthough much has been learned in this study about the selection of\n\nparameters for the Thematic Mapper, it is clear that this problem cannot\n\nbe now regarded as entirely solved. Further studies of this and other\n\ntypes are needed to develop a convincing set of facts regarding scanner\n\nsystem parameters selection. This study also illustrates very clearly\n\nthe value of.both field gathered and airborne multispectral data in\n\ncontinuing research efforts.\n\n\nO0p\n\nYm\n\n2.4-51\n\n\nREFERENCES\n1. \tHarnage, J.

Among these were statistical\n\nrepresentation of scene classes, spectral window functions, scanner\n\naperature effects, sampling noise influences and classification error\n\nmodels. Since the majority of resources in the project was spent on\n\nthe thematic mapper simulation only limited consideration was made of\n\nthe generalized system elements. Specifically the classification error\n\nmodel was pursued in some detail in an attempt to advance the state of\n\nthe art in the multiclass, multichannel classification error prediction\n\nproblem. The following is a brief review of this work.\n\nProbability of Misclassification for an Optimum Bayes Classifier Intro\xc2\xad\nduction\n\nThe evaluation of the performance of various classifiers through\n\ncalculation of exact probability of misclassification has been under\n\nstudy by researchers for some time. Although empirical results have\n\nbeen obtained, the precise recognition rate for a Bayes classifier has\n\nnot been evaluated for more than two normal classes with arbitrary\n\ncovariance matrices (AndersonI , Das Gupta 2 , Fukunaga 3 ). In evaluating\n\nthe scanner performance, attention here has been focused on recognition\n\nrate at the both input and output of the systems. For this purpose,\n\nthe probabilities of misclassifications of a multiple class Bayes\n\nclassifier must be obtained. A Bayes classifier is a quadratic classifi\xc2\xad\ncation scheme which is optimum in the sense of providing correct proba\xc2\xad\nbility of error. Much simpler mathematics is required for evaluation\n\nof a sub-optimum-linear classifier.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe discrimination problem, as it is known now, was introduced by\n\nR. A. Fisher as a problem in taxonomy. He used a linear discriminant\n\nfunction with coefficients chosen such that a defined cost function was\n\nminimized. Since then, many extensions to the problem have been proposed\n\nand solved. Bayes classification, however, has been almost entirely\n\nlimited to two classes with multivariate normal distribution. As men\xc2\xad\ntioned before, the source of the problem is the quadratic nature of\n\ndiscriminant functions.\n\nMultiple Class Classification\n\nFor our purposes, error probability for a multiple class Bayes\n\nclassifier is required. The problem is simplified somewhat .by assuming\n\nthat all distributions are multivariate normal and mean vector and\n\ncovariance matrices are known. The absence of the latter assumption\n\nwould immensely complicate the problem by introducing random matrices\n\nwith Wishart distributions.\n\n\nB-2\n\n\nApproach\n\nThe basic approach is based on the following:\n\nThe quadratic discriminant functions are\n\n=\n\n(X-M)Ai-7(X-M)-C. \n i=1,2 ..... M\n.\n\nwhere M i and Ai are mean vector and covariance matrice of class i, Ci\n\nis a constant depending on prior probabilities of each class.\n\nNow, choose class j if Li < Li Vj#i\n\nWe defined the probability of error as:\n\nUnder M 1\n\nPr(FIMl).= 1 - Pr{CIMl = I - Pr[all Li \' l/Vi#l]\n\nI\n\n1 -\n\nf(\n\n.\n[itf(M,.M-\'\'\'-2l1)dn...dL ]dll\n\n2\n\nwhere\n\nPr{e M11 = Conditional probability of error\nPr{C MI} = Conditional probability of correct classification\nAs seen above, the quantities required are, the marginal and joint dis\xc2\xad\ntributions of Li.\n\nAssuming that the ovservation belongs to say, first class, i.e. X-N(M,A l )\n\nthen P1 has a chi-squared distribution with N degrees of-freedom (N=dimen\xc2\xad\nsion of the observation vector). k2 and others have a more complicated\n\ndiszribution. Their moment generating function, however, can be found\n\nE[etZ2] =)et[(X-M2 )TA\n2\n\n(X-1M)TAI-I(X-M\n\n2dX\n\n(X-M2)-C 2 ]L\n\nThere is a single transformation that diagonalize\nCarrying out the mathematics\n\n\nA-1\n\nboth A 1\n\n\n\n\n-I\n\n\n& A 2\n\n\nKit\n\nN\n\nel-2dit \n\n\np2(i=l 1-2d.t \n\n\nItL\n\n2di\n\n\nThe density function of Z2 is related to its m.g.f. in a known fashion.\n\n\nB-3\n\n\nJoint Distribution\n\nVarious methods have been tried with varying degree of success.\n\nThe basic approach in all of them is based on calculating the m.g.f.\n\nof conditional random variables and by using the following chain\n\nformula:\n\n\nf(ZMZM-l...ZI)=f(ZMIZMI,ZM_2"--Zj) f(ZM-I ZMz2\'Z\n\n1 )\n\n\nX f(Z 3 lZ2 ,Z1 ) f(Z 2 jZ l ) f(z 1 )\nfind the joint classify function\n\nAt the moment, we have focused on three classes. A method developed\n\nfor this case will likely be extendable to more general case. It should\n\nbe mentioned that, the limiting factor in this problem is not as much\n\nthe number of classes as it is the dimension of observation vector.\n\nThe .discriminant functions shown before, are -hyperquadrics in M\nTo obtain f(k 21), \xc2\xa31 is fixed and any subsequent inte\xc2\xad\n2\ngration should bear in mind that the integrand is defined over this\nsurface. In a special case, when N=3, the surface is a general ellipsoid.\n\ndimensions.\n\nThe next case, f(k3l 2,9i), both \xc2\xa3 2 ,and X, are fixed, and the\'path\n\nof integration is on the intersection of these two hyperquadrics. If\n\ncovariance matrices are equal, then each ki is a hypershpere on a sphere\n\nfor N=3. Their intersection would be simple circles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe direction that we are heading in at this point is to obtain\n\nE[etZ21kIl and EetZ3jZ 2 ,i ] subject to above surface constraints.\n\n1\nBeyond this, the inverse FFT would provide the desired conditional and\n\njoint density functions. It is unlikely that integrals.are easily inte\xc2\xad\ngrable, so numerical methods will likely be used throughout.\n\n\nB-4\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n-1. \t\nAnderson, T.

The work statement and preliminary milestones for\n\nthis task were reviewed at that time. On August 19 and 20, Dr. John\n\nLindenlaub visited JSC to meet with Mr. Hay to discuss training needs,\n\ndetermine typical entry levels of trainees and survey presently available\n\ntraining materials (milestone I). A series of meetings between Dr. Lindenlau\n\nand Building 17 personnel was arranged by Mr. John Sargent. Most of the\n\ndiscussions were on a one-to-one basis with personnel working on specific\n\nprojects. The exception was a group discussion organized by Mr. Tom Minter\n\nwhich centered around LACTE Analyst Interpreters (AT) andData Processing\n\nAnalyst (DPA) training.\n\nThe following observations were made as a result of the one-to-one\n\nconversations. The individuals talked to were for the most part working\n\nwithin a relatively small group (less than 8 individuals). The individuals\n\nhad a wide diversity of backgrounds reflecting the interdisciplinary nature\n\nof remote sensing technology. Their formal education in remote sensing\n\nranged from none to minimal with most of the people learning through on-the\xc2\xad\njob training.\n\nPerhaps the strongest feeling expressed during the LACIE Al and DPA\n\ndiscussion was that there would be considerable mutual benefit derived from\n\neach group of analysts having a better appreciation of the other group\'s\n\nanalysis techniques and job function. Although some specific suggestions\n\nwere discussed, they did not differ substantially from those made during\n\nLACIE reviews and it was assumed these suggestions would be evaluated\n\nthrough the normal RID procedure. It was pointed out that LARS would be\n\nresponsive to specific training requests associated with the LACIE or other\n\nJSC projects.\n\n\n2.5-2\n\n\nTraining Program Design Activities\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of the contract period,.it was recommend\xc2\xad\ned that two activities in the area of training programs and materials\n\ndevelopment be pursued during the remaining portion of the contract year.\n\nThese recommendations were based on results of work carried out under the\n\ntask analysis described above, an assessment of currently available\n\ntraining materials and identification of topic areas in .which the develop\xc2\xad\nment of new materials was\'needed.\n\nThe first recommendation was that a one to two week.training session\nbe held for \'8to10 JSC personnel. The training sessionwas to be held\nat LARS using existing slide-tape-study guide minicourses and videotaped\ninstructional materials. Anticipating the availability of these materials\nto the remote sensing community, the training session was to emphasize:\n1) the participants learning the \'subjectfmatter and 2) preparing them to\nserve as instructors. It was felt that having training materials and a\ncadre \'of qualified instructorconsultafts on \'site would improve and simplify\non-the-job training of JSC personnel.\nThe ;second activity proposed in the first quarterly pr6gress report\n\nwas the development of additional training materials. Simulation exercises\n\ncentered around the forestry applicatofs project (FAP) and regional\n\napplications project (RAP) and additional titles in the FOCUS series were\n\nspecifically recommended. Simulation exercises are designfed to lead the\n\nreader through the professional thought and decision making processes typical\n\nof those required by a remote sensing analyst. The FOCUS series is a set\n\nof pamphlets which contains one page of text and one page of s\'hpporting\n\nfigures.\n\n\nPriority Assignment Activities\n\nThe following priorities were iedommended in the first quarterly progress\n\nreport for the training program and materials development work to be carried\n\nout during the remainder of the contract period:\n\n1. \t\nDevelopment of a forestry applications (PAP) simulation exercise.\n\n2. \t\nTraining 8-10 JSC personnel at LARS as desctibed in the previous\n\nsection.\n\n3. \t\nProduce additional titles in the FOCUS Series.\n\n4. \t\nDevelopment df a simulation exercise for the regional applications\nproject (RAP).\nWork was pursued according to these priorities for the rest of the contract\n\nperiod. Results obtained in these areas are reported in the following\n\nsections.\n\n\nOPRo\n\n2.5-3\n\n\nMaterials Development\n\nThe forestry applications simulation exercise was completed during the\n\nthird quarter of the contract period and was submitted as an interim\n\ntechnical report (LARS Information Note 012376). This report documents\n\nin detail the analysis of a LANDSAT data set using computer-aided analysis\n\ntechniques. It is .designed to enable the reader to gain an appreciation\n\nof the decisions and trade-offs made by the experienced analyst. The\n\npublication describes the sequential process of analyzing a LANDSAT data\n\nset and emphasizes the interaction between man (analyst) and machine\n\n(computer). Typical products (results) of each step in the analysis are\n\nshown in the report.\n\nThe analysis described in the forestry application simulation exercise\n\nis shown in Figure 2.5-1. A better appreciation of the approach taken in\n\nthe simulation may be obtained from reading the following paragraphs which\n\nhave been adapted from the Overview section of the simulation:\n\n\n2.5-4\n\nState Analysis\n\nObjectives\n\n\nAcquire\n\nData\n\n\nIRemotely Sensed\nCorrelate\n\nData\n\nwith Reference Data\n\n\n[\n\nSelect Training Areas\n\nCluster and-Classify\n\n-\n\nIndividual Training Areas\n\nr s\nInterpret\n\nSpectral Classes\n\n\nPool and/or Delete\n\n\nSpectral-Information\n\nClasses\n\n\nClassify Training Areas\n\nas Single Data Set\n\n\n.Evalua\n\nte\n\nAccuracy of\n\nTNjraining Area\n\nClas ifiction\n\nClassify Entire\n\nPlanning Unit\n\n\nApply Results\n\n\nFigure 2.5-i Typical Numerical Analysis\n\n\nFlowchart for Forestry Applications\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 18\n\nOF POOR QUALI1y\n\n2.5-5\n\n\nThe numerical analysis of remotely sensed data is a dynamic\n\nprocess which requires an interaction between man (analyst) and\n\nmachine (computer). The process is both an art and a science,\n\nrelying upon judgements and insights by the analyst as well as\n\na documented technology of remote sensing analysis. A typical\n\nanalysis sequence is shown in Figure 2.5-1. Even though it is\n\nshown here as basically a linear process, all of the steps are\n\ninterconnected. At any step in the analysis, interpretation of\n\nthe results of that step can lead the analyst to conclude,-that\n\nhe should go back to a previous step and revise his procedure.\n\nFor simplicity only the most commonly followed analysis sequence\n\nis shown.\n\nRemote sensing techniques allow you to "survey" large areas\n\nwith a minimum amount of time and cost. The computer can be\n\n"trained" to produce general land use maps as well as general\n\nforest cover maps. Even finer breakdowns of cover types may be\n\nachieved, such as timber stand maps, although mapping reliability\n\nis lower for these relative to general land use maps.\n\nThe first step is to state the analysis objectives. To do\n\nthis, you must determine the geographic area of interest, the\n\ngeneral cover types and the nature of the application to which\n\nthe results will be applied. An additional component which is\n\noften included in the analysis objective is the expected class\xc2\xad\nification accuracy for initial estimates of timber resources.\n\nAn example would be to "determine the percentage of Hoosier\n\nNational Forest in each of these cover types: conifers, hard\xc2\xad\nwoods and other with 85% accuracy".\n\nNext, the remotely-sensed data are correlated with the\n\navailable reference data. The multispectral-scanner data may\n\nbe from aircraft or satellites, such as LANDSAT. The reference\n\ndata might include USGS topographic maps (quad maps), stand\n\ncompartment type maps and related information, aerial photo\xc2\xad\ngraphs, U.S. Forest Service land use maps and actual ground\n\nobservations. Each LANDSAT satellite covers the entire earth\n\nevery eighteen days, so the analyst can most generally choose\n\nthe time of the year most suitable for mapping the cover types\n\nof interest. The analysis sequence described in this simulation\n\nuses LANDSAT data.\n\nThe training areas are then selected. The training areas\n\ncontain typical examples of each cover type of interest and\n\nare supplied to the computer in order to "train" it to classify\n\nunknown data points. There are some general selection criteria\n\nto aid the analyst in choosing training areas, but successful\n\ntraining area selection relies heavily on the analyst\'s previous\n\nexperience and knowledge of the areas being studied.\n\n\n2.5-6\n\n\nWhen training areas have been selected, the next step is\n\nto use a-computer processor (algorithm) called CLUSTER on each\n\nof the training areas individually. The CLUSTER processor uses\n\ninformation from more than one channel, or wavelength band, to\n\nproduce a single computer-generated image. Since more informa\xc2\xad\ntion is used, the boundaries of ground features and cover types\n\nare usually more distinct on images produced by the clustering\n\nprocess than on a single-channel image.\n\nAfter clustering, obtaining statistics, and classifying\n\neach of the training areas, the analyst looks at the output to\n\nsee what each spectral class of the training areas represents.\n\nThe spectral classes are groups of data points with similar\n\nspectral values (brightness levels). Aerial photographs and other\n\nreference data aid the analyst in making these associations be\xc2\xad\ntween spectral classes and various cover types.\n\nOn the basis of the spectral separabilities and the known\n\ncover type information, the spectral-information classes may be\n\npooled (merged together) or deleted. The spectral classes that\n\nare informationally and numerically similar (i.e. spectrally\n\ninseparable) are combined, while the spectral classes that are\n\na mixture of two cover types (such as pasture and forest) may\n\nbe deleted. The analyst should go back to his analysis objective(s)\n\nto help him decide which classes to combine and which to delete.\n\nTo check how well he did in the pooling and deleting of\n\nspectral classes, the analyst then classifies all the training\n\nareas together as a single unit. He then looks at the classifi\xc2\xad\ncation maps and compares them with other reference data. This\n\nstep along with the output of the computer allows him to predict\n\nthe probable accuracy to expect when he classifies the total\n\nplanning unit.\n\nWith the output from classifying the training areas as a single\n\ndata set, the analyst must predict if the training areas selected\n\nare going to allow him to meet his objective(s) when he classifies\n\nthe total area under consideration. Will the classification yield\n\nthe stated accuracy? Are all cover types adequately represented?\n\nIf not, he must go back to previous steps as shown by the arrows\n\non the right side of the flowchart. If possible, he may merely\n\ngo back to "pool and/or delete" again. In some cases, he might\n\ngo back and reselect the training areas. He may even need to\n\ngo back to the beginning and restate his analysis objectives.\n\nWhen he is satisfied with the classification data from the\n\ncombined training areas, the analyst instructs the computer to\n\nclassify the total area. Using pattern recognition algorithms,\n\nthe spectral responses of each data point are "compared" to the\n\ntraining sample for each class, and the point is assigned to the\n\n"most likely" or most similar class. The output after this step\n\n\n2.5-7\n\n\ncan be maps and data\nmapped cover types.\n\n\ntables - showing\n\nacres (hectares) for the\n\nAs indicated earlier, numerical analysis of multispectral\n\nscanner data is a dynamic process with each step providing feed\xc2\xad\nback to the previous step. For simplicity, the process is\n\nshown here as a linear sequence. In reality, the analyst has all\n\nsteps in mind before he actually begins an analysis. He may also\n\nrefer back to previous steps and modify his procedure as the\n\nanalysis continues.\n\nFollowing this overview the simulation exercise discuss each step in the\n\nanalysis in detail with specific attention being paid to describe the\n\nanalyst\'s reasoning and the basis of his decisions.\n\nWork on a second simulation exercise began during the latter part\n\nof the third quarter and has continued throughout the fourth quarter of\n\nthe contract period. The data set used for this simulation exercise has\n\nbeen drawn from among those analyzed in conjunction with the Regional\n\nApplications Project task of this contract. A first draft of the\n\nsimulation exercise has been completed and it has undergone internal\n\nreview. Based on the review the document is being revised to place\n\ngreater emphasis on the underlying analysis principles and incorporate\n\nexamples of typical output products into the document. Current status\n\nis that the revision is approximately 60% complete. After revision the\n\ndocument will again be reviewed internally and undergo student tryout\n\nprior to publication.\n\nThree titles have been added to the FOCUS series during the con\xc2\xad\ntract year. Like other titles in the series these two-page foldouts\n\nconsist of a diagram or photograph and an extended caption of three\n\nto four hundred words treating a single topic in remote sensing. They\n\nhave been found to be especially useful for general briefings or intro\xc2\xad\nductory treatments of remote sensing topics. The new FOCUS titles along\n\nwith a brief summary are:\n\nLANDSAT Multispectral Scanner Data -\n\nLANDSAT data in four spectral bands is available on computer\n\ncompatible tapes and in various image formats. An example of\n\nan annotated LANDSAT image produce is given.\n\nClustering -\n\nIn remote sensing, clustering is used to determine the "natural\n\nstructure" of data. It can be used to decompose complex data\n\nsets into simpler subsets and to determine data classes based\n\non spectral rather than informational variations.\n\nHow the Earth Reflects -\n\nEnergy reflected by materials on the earth\'s surface -Varies\n\naccording to the structure of the materials themselves and\n\ntheir conditions. Spectral differentiation is possible be\xc2\xad\ncause vegetation, soil and water reflect energy differently\n\nfrom each other and because sub-categories of these materials\n\n\n2.5-8\n\n\ndemonstrate spectral variations as well.\n\nIn addition to these additions to the series three FOCUS issues prepared\n\nduring 1973 were reviewed for currency. They were judged to be satis\xc2\xad\nfactory and not in need of revision at this time.\n\nInterim Training Programs\n\nOne of the recommendations resulting from the task analysis conducted\n\nat the beginning of the contract year was to conduct a training session\n\nfor 8 to 10 JSC personnel. The objectives of the training session were\n\n1) to give the participants the opportunity to learn and work with the\n\nfundamental principles of remote sensing, especially those associated\n\nwith the applications of pattern recognition techniques to the analysis\n\nof multispectral scanner data, and 2) to prepare the participants to serve\n\nas instructor-consultants for formal training programs or on-the-job\n\ntraining of personnel at JSC. Although no request for such an interim\n\ntraining program was received to a large extent the first of these\n\nobjectives was met through the mechanism of JSC based personnel attending\n\nthe Remote\'Sensing Technology and Applications short course sponsored\n\nby Purdue\'s Division of Conferences in cooperation with LARS. Those\n\nattending the short course from JSC during the past year were:\n\nName\n\nAffiliation\n\nRichard Moke\nDonald Saile\nMilton Bertrand\nDonald Hay\nOlav Smistad\nF. C. Kuo\n\nNASA\nLEC\nLEC\nNASA\nNASA\nLEC\n\nSeptember, 1975\nNovember, 1975\nJanuary, 1976\nJanuary, 1976\nJanuary, 1976\nJanuary, 1976\n\nTo better facilitate our ability to respond to requests for training\n\nprograms which might arise in the future, education and training materials\n\nwhich have been developed at LARS under NASA and Purdue University support\n\nhave been organized and summarized in LARS Information Note 052576,\n\nMatrix of Education and Training Materials in Remote Sensing. This docu\xc2\xad\nment, which will be submitted as a separate volume of this final report,\n\norganizes the remote sensing education and training materials developed\n\nby LARS in a matrix format. Each row in the matrix represents a subject\n\narea in remote sensing and the columns represent different types of instruc\xc2\xad\ntional materials. This format proves to be useful for showing in a concise\n\nmanner the subject matter content, prerequisite requirements and "technical\n\ndepth" of each instructional module in the matrix.\n\nFollowing a general description of the matrix and the instructional\n\nformat of the materials in the matrix there are three examples of training\n\nprograms designed to meet specific training objectives. Content of the\n\nprograms were selected to match both the educational and experiential\n\nbackgrounds of the participants and the constraint imposed by the amount\n\nof time available for training. The training program examples are followed\n\n\n2.5-9\n\n\nby a "catalog" of the instructional modules which contains a summary\n\nparagraph, list of recommended prerequisites and any special equipment\n\nor instructional aids which may be required to use the modules.\n\nAvailability of this document will facilitate implementation of\n\nremote sensing training requirements at JSC.\n\nRemote Terminal Support\n\nLARS continued its support of the remote terminal at JSC throughout\n\nfiscal year 76. Only a few problems with the equipment were reported\n\n(primarily the IBM 2780 Card reader/printer/punch and the Codex modems)\n\nbut these were handled via calls to the appropriate vendor.\n\nThe JSC terminal maintained nine active computer ID\'s for most of\n\nthe year, with usage displayed in Table 2.2-1. Note that very little\n\nuse was made of the batch system this year.-\n\nThe terminals were used for training new analysts, for general\n\nresearch and technology development, and very heavily for LACIE support.\n\nThis latter support primarily made use of CMS capabilities and not LARSYS.\n\nPeople on the LACIE project used the terminals to statistically check the\n\nquality of training fields. This use of the terminals is evident in Table\n\n2.5-2 where the total CPU time for LARSYS is much lower than the total CPU\n\ntime used. Table 2.5-2 shows totals for CPU time attach time and CPU\n\ntime used for LARSYS functions by JSC remote terminal users.\n\nAnother significant remote terminal activity was publication of the\n\nRemote TerminalSystem Evaluation reports (LARS Information Note 062775).\n\nLast year\'s final report stated that a draft version was being reviewed\n\nby NASA and early in the contract year the report was released for publica\xc2\xad\ntion. The report documents the development of an earth resources data\n\nprocessing system which is being used by both LARS personnel and remote\n\nterminal users. Its value us a system for training, technology transfer,\n\nand data processing are evaluated in the report.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWork in the area of technology transfer and remote terminal support\n\nwas carried out in accordance with the task analysis, recommendations and\n\npriorities established during the first quarter of the contract year. In\n\nthe area of training materials one simulation exercise was developed,\n\nsignificant progress has been made on a second analysis simulation, and\n\nthree additional FOCUS issues were written. While no training programs\n\nwere requested under the SR&T contract, 6 JSC based personnel attended the\n\nPurdue sponsored remote sensing short course during the past year. A report\n\nwas prepared which summarizes and catalogs the remote sensing education and\n\ntraining materials developed at and available from LARS. This document\n\nwill facilitate the planning and implementation of future training programs.\n\nThe JSC-LARS remote computer terminal continued to be supported throughout\n\nthe contract year.\n\n\nTable 2.5-2\n\nJSC Remote Terminal\n\nCPU Time Usage (June, 1975 - May, 1976)\n(Hours)\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAug.\n\n1975\nSept\n\nOct.\n\nNov.\n\nDec.\n\nI\nB\nT\nI\n\n2.0\n.0\n2.0\n.8\n\n2.3\n.0\n2.3\n3.1\n\n2.0\n.0\n2.0\n1.6\n\n.9\n.0\n.9\n4.3\n\n1\n.0\n.1\n.35\n\n.1\n\n1.3\n\n.6\n\nB\n\n-\n\n-\n\n.0\n\n.0\n\n.0\n\nJSC100\nJSC102\nJSC308\n\nT\nI\n\n.8\n1.4\n\n3.1\n3.9\n\n1.6\n3.4\n\n4.3\n0.5\n\n1.3\n.3\n\n.6\n1.2\n\n1976\nFeb.

The primary research area identified in\n\nthe Statement of Work was termed "Ancillary Data Registration."\n\nThe interest in this problem arises, for example, from the\n\nneed of crop classification researchers to relate the spectral\n\nvariations observed to causitive factors in the physical\n\nenvironment.\nFactors such as soil properties, land use\n\npatterns, precipitation, slope, thermal history, etc., are\n\ndesired in digital form in registration with the multispec\xc2\xad\ntral data.\nThis task was established to develop the techni\xc2\xad\nques necessary to provide the desired ancillary data channels.\n\nThe second task consisted of further evaluation of an\n\nimage enhancement algorithm developed in CY75 and reprogram\xc2\xad\nming of the algorithm for improved efficiency.\nThe algorithm\n\nboth interpolates and enhances using an optimal instantaneous\n\nfield of view filter1 and shows promise for aiding visual\n\ninterpretation of LACIE segment images.\nPart of the evalua\xc2\xad\ntion of the enhancement algorithm included classification\n\naccuracy experiments and these results are not yet available.\n\nThe third research task consists of a spectral reflec\xc2\xad\ntance study of soils using the EXOTECH field spectrometer.\n\nThe task seeks-to relate the detailed soil reflectance\n\n.spectrum obtained from this instrument to physical properties\n\nsuch as Cation Exchange Capacity, Organic Matter Content, etc.\n\nAn additional task which consists of temporally regis\xc2\xad\ntering four passes of LANDSAT data for two LACIE intensive\n\nstudy sites is reported herein.\nThis work was done with\n\ncomputer resources available under the 2.6 task.\n\nAlthough the ancillary data overlay and image enhance\xc2\xad\nment work was not directed to be in support of LACIE the\n\nresults have turned out to be of potential benefit to the\n\nproject.\nSignature extension research will be aided by the\n\navailability of registered physical data and segment visual\n\ninterpretation may benefit from the enhancement algorithm.\n\nThe temporal registration task is part of research on the\n\neffects of misregistration and is in direct support of LACIE.\n\nAncillary Data Registration\n\nAn important motivation for ancillary data registration\n\nderives from the signature extension problem. Physical\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUAInI\n\n2.-6-2\n\n\nfactors are assumed to cause variation in spectr-al response\n\nwhich invalidates training parameters at observation points\n\ndistant from the training area. Digital registra-tion of\n\nphysical factor data with remote sensing data will enable\n\nquantitative evaluation of the effect of these factors.\n\nThe \t\nsame reasoning applies to many other classification\n\nproblems such as forestry where slope and elevation is\n\nimportant and for these reasons an ancillary d:ata registra\xc2\xad\ntion task-was pursued.\n\nThe \t\ntypes of physical data which are\'most often encounter\xc2\xad\ned are in the form of maps. The data is sually originally\n\nobtained in tabular of photograph-ic form and compiad into\n\na map.\nThe formats of the data on the map inc:ludes contours,\n\nlines, polygons and points.\nFigure 2.6-i graphically describes\n\nsome of these forms.\nIt is assumed that the physical pro\xc2\xad\ncedures for transforming the map into a digital image-like\n\nrecord registered pixel\'wise with tem6te sensing data.\nThe\n\nbasic steps in the map transformation proc&ss are assumed to\n\nbe:\n\n1. \t Digitizti-on of the physical map.\n\n2. \t Conversion of the lines and points to a uniform\n\ngrid of points.\n\n3. \t Registration of the gridded data to a reference data\n\nset.\n\nEach st\'ep involves a,number of parameters and algorithms.\n\nSome of the consicerations which must be ma&e are:\n\n1. \t Density of sampies for con-tou-rs and arcs.\n2. \tEffect\'s of position errors-.\n\n3. \t Scheme far defining interiors of polygons.\n\n4. \t General considerations of the information content\n\n(bandwidth) of a map.\n\n5. \t Interpolation algorithms for gridding contour and\n\npoint data.\n\n6. \t Coordinate systems and warping functions for regis\xc2\xad\ntration.\n\nThese factors were considered in the context oif the\n\nvariables -o\'f interest for spectral strata d\'efinitin,., The\n\nvariables currently under study are:\n\n\n2.6-3\n\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n3\n"\n\n3\n\nPOLYGON\n(SOIL MAP)\n\nPOINT\n(WELL LOGS)\n\nFigure 2.6-1.\n\nLINE\n(AERO MAGNETIC)\n\nCONTOUR\n(TOPOGRAPHIC MAP)\n\nAGGREGATED\n(CENSUS TRACTS)\n\nAncillary Data Format Examples\n\n\n2.6-4\n\n\n1.\n\nSoil Type and Association.\n\n\n2.\n\nTemperature and Precipitation.\n\n\n3.\n\nLand Use.\n\n\nThe study first made some general considerati.ons of the\n\nmap data digitization problem. The polygon format requires\n\nthe sImplest data processing operations since constant\n\'\n\nvalues are all that need to be filled, in inside the polygon\n\nand these values are-specifically defined-. The contour,\n\nline, and point formats require smo-oth surface interpola\xc2\xad\ntion between data points and these cases present the great\xc2\xad\nest challenge. The aggregated data case is also, a.relatively\n\ndifficult problem in that the value given in a tract is a\n\ntotal of some variable such as population, and dividing the\'\n\ntotal by the area and assigning the average to tire entire\n\ntract may give misleading or undesirable weights\'to-certain\n\npoints in the tract.\nCurve fitting techniques may be desir\xc2\xad\nable in this case which would be for example match densities\n\nat the boundaries of tracts.\nIt was the original\'intention\n\nin the study to address each of thes.e data types and research\n\ntechniques for digitizing each form of data. The main\n\napplication of the research was to be the signature ex.ten\xc2\xad\nsion or spectral strata task and the project ultimately focus\xc2\xad\ned on the requirements for this task. The data types con\xc2\xad\nsidered for the spec\'tral strata were all of the p-olygon type\n\nand the resources required to complete the work on the poly\xc2\xad\ngon were such-that other types of data could no-t be considered\n\nduring the year.\n\nThus, the ancillary data registration project considered\n\nfour polygonal data sets (soils, land use, temperature, pre\xc2\xad\ncipitation), developed procedures, and achieved, registration\n\nof these four variables with a full frame of LANDSAT data\n\nin the project period. Data did not become available until\n\nthe middle of the second quarter thus the period the overlays\n\nwere completed in was slightly over two quarters. Each\n\npolygon data type presented different problems and, each is\n\ndiscussed below.\n\nSoil Map\n\nThe test sites of interest were in Kansas and included\n\nLACIE intensive study sites.\nIt was d,ecided that since the\n\nmap data was available for the entire s-tate -the total area\n\nwould be overlayed on LANDSAT frames as desired. The soil\n\nmap used.is described in the Spectral Strata Se-c.ton , (2.2)\n\nand a reproduction is presented in Figure 2.2-4.\n\nThe map was mounted on a coordinate digitizing table\n\nand each line separating different soil types was digitized\n\nby punching the coordinates of points along the lines on\n\n\n40 1 -\n\nt\n\nLRBORRTORY FOR\n4\n\nR\nPPLICrTION OF REMOTE SENSING\nPURDUE UNIVERSITY\nRE-PLOT MnP\' SOIL RSSOCInTIONS OF KANSAS\n\n\nTRBOUNORY\n\n44 SORT\n\nARCS\na\n\ni\n\n=*~4 \n\n\nJ*=\n\nS7~~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\n\nFigure 2.6-2\n\n46 \n\n\n33=4\n\nh\n\n\nCALCONP Boundary flot for Checking Accuracy of Kansas Soil1 Map Digitization.\n\n\'\n\'In\n\n2.6-6\n\n\nThe accuracy of the digitized points is nominally\n\ncards.\n.01 inch and the point density used varies according to the\n\ncurvature. Points were more widely spaced (nominally .2\n\ninches) on low curvature areas and as little as .05 inch on\n\nsharply curving segments.\n\nA line between two intersections with other lines\n\nEach arc is\n\ndividing other soil types is called an arc.\ndigitized Individually and assigned a number. The output\n\nfrom the digitizing phase is thus a set of cards with x-y\n\ncoordinates for each arc and an identifying number for that\n\nare. For the soil map 170 arcs were digitized.\n\nThe next problem was to identify the contents of the\n\nA procedure was established\n\nareas enclosed by the arcs.\nby which code numbers were assigned describing the contents\n\nof the area to the left and right of the arc wh-ere the for\xc2\xad\nward direction is the direction the arc was digitized.\n\nThe complete list of arcs with the left and right codes is\n\nthen input to a boundary processing software package which\n\nproduces a gridded image like data set for the soil variables.\n\nIn order to check the accuracy of the arcs and their labels\n\na CALCOMP plotting routine was assembled which draws the\n\nThe\n\narcs and labels at the same scale as the original map.\nplot can then be overlayed on the map and each arc visually\n\nchecked. Figure 2.6-2 contains the arc plot for the soil\n\nmap.\n\nConcurrently control points were identified on the map\n\nand in the LANDSAT imagery to enable registration of the map\n\ndata to the LANDSAT data. Road intersections, corners of\n\nwater bodies, river bends, etc., were chosen and recorded.\n\nThe locations of these points were digitized and punched on\n\ncards thereby defining the point in the digitized soil data.\n\nThe points were also located in the LANDSAT data and the line\n\ncolumn number recorded. The steps followed in the procedure\n\ndeveloped digitizing this data are diagrammed in Figure 2.6-3.\n\nOnce the data and control points were all in digital form\n\nthe gridded data set was generated. Arcs are sorted and code\n\nnumbers assigned to each pixel according to which polygon\n\nthe pixel is in. The result of this step is a digital image\n\narray having nominally the same scale as the LANDSAT data.\n\nThe final step in the process is registration to the\n\nLANDSAT data. The control points are used to estimate the\n\ncoefficients of a bi-quadratic function which described the\n\ngeometric transformation of the gridded map data to cause it\n\nto match the LANDSAT data. This function is then applied\n\nto the data producing a final output file as indicated in\n\nthe lower right of Figure 2.6-3.

The table digitizer\n\nThat medns that there is an\n\nhas a resolution of 0.01 in.\nof 0.01 times the scale of the topological map.\n\nuncertainty\nFor example, if the county map has a scale of 1,000,000,\n\nIf the\n\nthen the uncertainty is 0.Olxl,000,000/12 a 833 ft.\npixel is 250 ft. wide, then digitization could cause an\n\nIt should be noted that we may\n\nuncertainty of 3.3 pixels.\nusing a more daeailed map.\n\nreduce such uncertainty by\n2) Uncertainty due to quantization and instability\n\ntable digitizer. The digitizer has three quantization\n\nof\n100, 200 and 400 parts/in. However, since the\n\nlevels:\nresolution constraint by the moving arms and other mechanical\n\nparts is 0.10 in., using the high quantization scale does\n\nnot improve accuracy but brings in the problem of s-tability.\n\nThe digitizer drifts from tim\'e to time, i.e., such that the\n\nsame values at the same point are not obtained after moving\n\nacross the map, and be experience the drift is estimated to\n\nbe about 2 to-4-units at the 200 pts/in scale. So the un\xc2\xad\ncertainty contributed by instability is about 0.01 in., the\n\nsame amount as that by digitization.\n\nCheckpoints\n\n3) Uncertainty of location of checkpoints.\nare identified from the physical maps as well as from the\n\nmultispectral image. Usually intersection of highways and\n\nother landmarks are used as checkpoints because these can\n\nbe easily identified on the multispectral image. Both\n\ndigitization of checkpoints on the map and visual location\n\nof checkpoints in the multispectral image cause un\'certainty.\n\nDigitization uncertainty, as estimated above, is about 3.3\n\npixels; identification of checkpoints is assumed to within\n\n1-2 pixels. Thus, total uncertainty for this part is about\n\n5 pixels.\n\n4) Uncertainty due to image registration. This by\n\nfar has the least uncertainty. According to the way the\n\nboundary program is structured, the registration error is\n\nheld to be within half a pixel.\n\nThe table digitizer is operated manually, howevet, and\n\n.01 inch. It is hardly\n\nhuman error is likely to be more tha\n\n2.6-9\n\n\npossible for a human eye to resolve a distance of 0.01 in.,\n\nin fact, it takes extreme concentration to distinguish a\n\ndistance of 0.03 in. Thus, this is more likely the most\n\nserious factor degrading the accuracy of the overlay at\n\nthese scales.\n\nLand Use Map\n\nA general land use map of the state of Kansas was the\n\nsecond physical data map processed. This map is described\n\nin Section 2.2 and illustrated in Figure 2.2-6 in that\n\nsection.\' The same procedure was followed for this map as\n\nfor the soil map and a numerical image data set was generat\xc2\xad\ned with land use codes from one to. twelve. A considerable\n\namount of difficulty was encountered due to the fact that\n\nthere were over 1000 arcs in the land use map and the soft\xc2\xad\nware had been set up for less than 1000. The CALCOMP replot\n\nof the land use map arcs is presented in Figure 2.6-4.\n\nThis data was then registered on the LANDSAT frame in the\n\nsame manner as before.\n\nTemperature and Precipitation Maps\n\nThe temperature and precipitation data was available\n\nonly on a county basis from World Meteorological Organiza\xc2\xad\ntion tapes as described in Section 2.2.\nThus a constant\n\nnumerical value was generated to fill in the area inside\n\neach county. The county boundaries were digitized and pro\xc2\xad\ncessed similarly to the previous maps and two different\n\nsets of numbers input for each county for temperature and\n\nprecipitation. A boundary plot of the digitized county\n\nboundary is presented in Figure 2.6-5.\n\nThere are many ways the temperature and precipitation\n\nnumbers could be defined. For the initial phase of the\n\nstudy the total winter wheat growing season average was\n\nused comprising the interval October 1973 through June 1974.\n\nOther combination of periods could be used in a number of\n\nadditional channels for more detailed correlation studies.\n\nThe product of the first years effort in ancillary data\n\nregistration is a set of procedures and a four channel over\xc2\xad\nlay data set for one frame of LANDSAT data in Kansas.\n\nThe experience gained by taking one approach to the\n\nancillary data registration problem and completing the pro\xc2\xad\ncessing of four variables was very valuable. This work can\n\nlead the way toward further research on this problem and\n\nhopefully more efficient methods will be developed as a\n\nresult.\n\n\nAPPLICATION OF REMOTE SENSING\n\nLABORRTORY FOR PURDUE UNIVERSITY\n\nBOUNDRRY RE-PLOT MAP:\n\nLPND-USE PRTTERNS OF KRNSRS\n\n\nC!\n\n4ogn\n\nDo\n\nFigut~e 2.6-4\n\nCALCOMP Boundary Plot for Checking Accuracy of Kansas Land Use Map Digitization.\n\nL\n\na\n\n\nLABORRTORY FOR RPPLICATIQN OF REMOTE SENSING\n\nPURDUE UNIVERSITY\n\nBOUNDARY RE-PLOT MAP COUNTIES OF KANSAS\n\n\n43 SHORT ARCS\n\n21\n\n2\n\nSC\n27\n\nIB\n\ni\n\nL\n\n17\n\nt\n\nc\n\ni *\na.e iirees\n\nII\nI-.\n\nI\n\nI\n\na\n\n\n,\n\n\ne\n\n:72111a\n\',_I at\n5\n\n"\n\n\n,4*\n\ne . _\n\n\ne\n\n0@\n\n50\n\n\nFigure 2.6-5 \n CALCOMP Boundary Plot for Checking Accuracy of Kansas County Boundary\nDigitization.\n\n\n2.6-12\n\n\nImage Enhancement Evaluation\n\nThe optimum IFOV (Instantaneous Field of V1iew) enhance\xc2\xad\nment filter developed in CYT5 -and discuss&d in previous\n\nreports was applied to several LACIE segments for further\n\nevaluation. In addition, a modified program for cubic\n\ninterpolation was generated and applied to the same data.\n\nAlso, an existing blocking expansion pro-gram was applied to\n\nthe data sets.\nThus, a comparison of blocking, cubic inter\xc2\xad\npolation and IFOV filtering and expansion was obtained.\n\nThe results using the IFOV indicate a signtficatt sharpen\xc2\xad\ning -while maintaining a "smooth" characteris\'tic to the image\n\nas compared to blocking.\nThe cubic causes considerable\n\n"blurring" and was considered not very desirable.\n\nFour examples of the enhancement comparisons are pre\xc2\xad\nsented in Figure 2.6-6, a-d. The top image is generated\n\nby duplicating original LANDSAT pixels by a factor of three\n\nhorizontally and four vertically to compensate for the\n\nunequal sampling rates of the s-c-anner.\nThe typical block\xc2\xad\ning effect is seen here. The middle images are cubic\n\ninterpolations obtained by fitting a bi -cubic polynomial to\n\nthe sixteen points surrounding th-e new point being created\n\nand evaluating the polynomial at that point. Agaih a 3x by\n\n4x expansion was created. The pixels at the original LANDSAT\n\npoint locations have their original values.\nTfe bottom\n\nimages are IFOV filter outputs obtained by interpolating\n\nand filtering the original data to produce a 3 by 4 expansion\n\nand enhancements. Here all original points-have hew values.\n\nThe first site (Hill Co., Montana) covers smaller area\n\n(approximately 2 by 3 miles) than th-e other three which are\n\nLACIE segments.\nIt was judged from the relatively low\n\nquality reproductions that the filtered data had the best\n\nvisual quality of the three but reproduction on a high\n\nquality image writer should be carried out.\nLACIE analysts\n\nshould make the comparisons to determine the usefullness of\n\nthe enhancement in an operational environment.\n\nTo facilitate this comparison, six enhancement compari\xc2\xad\nsons consisting of eighteen four band data sets were-deliver\xc2\xad\ned to JSC in March 1976 for reproduction on the production\n\nfilm converter.\nTransparencies will be available for evalua\xc2\xad\ntion by both LACIE analysts and LARS personnel.\n\nThe IFOV enhancement program was completely reprogrammed\n\nduring CY76 and the new version was used for these examples.\n\nThe program performs a four channel enhancement nominally\n\nfive times faster than the previous Version. The previous\n\nversion did only one channel and required extensive tape and\n\ndisk buffering. The new convolution algorithm uses a multi\xc2\xad\nchannel cylindrical buffer and computes all points in one\n\n\n2.6-13\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nBlocked Enlar ement\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nCubic Interpolation\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\nIFOV Filtering\n\nFigure 2.6-6a\n\nEnhancement Comparisons for Run 73124700,\n\nHill County, Montana, July 3, 1973.\n\n\n2.6-14\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nBlocked Enlargement\n\n\noriginal in Color\n\n\nCubic Interpolation\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nIFOV Filtering\n\nFigure 2.6-6c \t Enhancement Comparisons for Run 74030600,\n\nMcPherson County, Kansas, May 6, 1974.\n\n\n2.6-15\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nBlocked Enlargement\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nCubic Interpolation\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nORIGINA pAGe \'S\nIFOV Filtering\n\nFigure 2.6-6b\n\nEnhancement Comparisons for Run 74030400,\nEllsworth County, Kansas, June 12, 1974.\n\nOF\n\np0F\n\nQUAISV\'\n\n2.6-16\n\n\nOriginal in Color\n\n\nBlocked Enlargement\n\n\noriginal in Color\n\n\nCubic Interpolation\n\n\noriginal in color\n\n\nIFOV Filtering\n\nFigure 2.6-6d\n\nEnhancement Comparisons for Run 74030200,\n\nBarton County, Kansas, June 12, 1974.\n\n\n2\'.6-17\n\n\noutput data line in one pass rather than two.\n\nThe basic process of convolution as implemented in\n\nthe current IFOV algorithm is to map each point of the input\n\nimage to a four by three block of points in the output image.\n\nThe points in the output are a weighted sum of the original\n\npoint and four points to either side and above and below it.\n\nLet P\nbe the original point;\nated as fohlows:\n\n\n(POlo)d\n\np0 ,0\n\npo.\n\nSP,0\n\nPIll\n\nP2,0\n\nP2,1 \n P2,2\n\n\np\n\n4\nn,\n\nE Ec(v\n\nj=-4\n\n1\n\nP0 ,\n\n2\n\nP1,2\n\n\npA\n\nP3,0\n\nP\n\na P array will be gener\xc2\xad\n\n)\n\nn,i\n\nP3,1 \n P3,2\n\n4\n\n\nE\n\nk=-4\n\n(h)\n\nl,k\n\ne,\n\nk.\n\nj,k\n\nThe two matrices C(v) and C(h), represent the weights of\ninput points in calculating the new point.\nc h) represents\nthe weightBof P\nin calculating an intermedlge point\nil,\'\n\nc1k rep\n\nsents\n\nthe weight of Pkj\n\nin P\n\n..\n\n\nThe two dimensional nature of convolution facilitates\n\nits partitioning into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nThis horizontal process is repeated until sufficient P lines\n\nhave accumulated to allow the calculation of a set of P lines.\n\nThe P lines are kept in a cylindrical buffer.\nAfter each P\n\ncalculation, the oldest line in the buffei is discarded and\n\na new P line is read in.\nThe buffer, therefore, moves like\n\na rolling cylinder through the input image.\n\nEach P can be calculated by the following:\n\n\nP\nE\nl,k ~k j=-4 Cl I j p j,k\nEach P can, in turn be calculated by:\n\nPl,k\n\n4\nJ=E4Cllj\n\njp\n\n2-6-18\n\n--\n\nIn the flDw chart in Figure 2.6:7"INL1NE is -t1re P line2\n\nCYLINDER represents the F lines and OUTLINE represents the P\n\nlines.\nNSAMPLES is the number of\'poirits per P\'14ne.\n\n\ntime\n\nDirectly computing P and P would require the\'following\n\n(ignoring stares and loads):\n\n\nTD\n\n= 9-(t\n\na\n\n+\n\ntm )\'9hline s\n\n\nncolumns 12\n\n-\n\n972(t\n\na\n\nwhere t\n\n+ tm\n\n)\n\nnlines \'nco1\n\nis CPU time for addition,\n\na\n\ntm is CPU time for multiplication,\n\nnlines is number of\n\ninput -lines,\n\n\nand ncolumn s is number of itpit columns.\n\n\nPartitioning the process *into components :gives\nfollowing time:\n\nTp = 3n lines\' neols\n\n9(t a +\n\nlines \n cols \n\nwhere the terms\nrespectively.\n\n\ntm)\n\nta \n\n\nthe\n\n\n+\n\n\nm\n\n\nrepresent hor-izontal and ve\'rtical times\n\n\nTp = 135(ta + \ntm) nlines\nncol\n\nComputing\nconclusions:\n\nI = 100%\n\nthe percentage improvement gives tire following\n\nT\n\n- -J2 * 100% = 100% -- 13.7%\n\nT D\n\nD 86.3%\n\n\nIn summary, the convolution \'ilgoritltm gendrt\'es for each\n\ninput point a 4 by 3 block o\'f output points.\nEach output\n\npoint is a weighted sum of some group of input poinits.\nBy\n\ncalculatig \'an intermediate group of horizontally compted\n\npoints a new savings of 86.3% over directly computing each\n\noutput point can be recognized in computer time.\nThe 86.3%\n\n\n2.6-19\n\n\nstart\n\nDO 1=5, NSAPLES\n\nDO\n\n1,\nN9NE\n\nL=\nDO K=1,\n\n4\nh\n\nOULINER\nDO\n\nK\n\n-- ,\n\nsY\n\nj-NS=\n\nL3J= C IL\n\n.\nv\n\nINDEETJJI\n\n\nWRITE ALL\n\nPOUR OUTLINES\n\nROTATE CYLINDER UP,\n\nDESTROYING\n\nFIRST LINE\n\n\nSREAD LINE\nDO 1=5,\n\nNSAMPLE\n\n.DO N=1, 3\nCYLINDERh\n\nCYLIND1,\nI\n\n3(I-5)+N =\n\nCc h) iTNLINE 1-5+L\n151\n=11, L\n\nhalt\n\nFigure 2.6-7\n\nOP\nP00oL\n\nPA\n\n\nFlow diagram for IFOV enhancement algorithm.\n\n2. 6-.20\n\n\nimprovement is in tbse actual mainframe or CPU time (e.g.,\n\nif the original algorithm took 100 sec.

system as an additional\n\ntask.\nLARS agreed to do this and the registrations were\n\ncarried out by the end of the CI.\nBoth nearest neighbor\n\nand cubic interpolation resampling was used as requested.\n\nSpectral Reflectance Properties of Soils\n\nRemote sensing of both terr-estrial and extraterrestrial\n\nenvironments has become a common scientific activity (Hunt\n\nand Salisbury, 1970).\nIn this effort, spectroscopic tech\xc2\xad\nniques are often used to determine the composition and nature\n\nof the target material, whether the target is a pine forest\n\nor the surface of the moon..\nIn most cases, the spectral\n\nbehavior of rocks or the s.oils derived from them is of\n\ninterest, either as the target spectral response itself, or\n\nas a background that must be understood in order to define\n\nits effects or to be eliminated.\n\nDespite widespread use of spectroscopic techniques in\n\nremote sensing, the spectral behavior of soils is not well\n\nunderstood.\nToo often an empirical approach to a specific\n\nremote sensing problem has been used; detailed s.tudi.es of\n\nspectral behavior have been done in a context inappropriate\n\nfor remote sensing use; or the spectral data obtained in\n\n\n2,6-21\n\n\na study have been too voluminous and difficult to organize\n\nfor publication.\n\nThis research is a continuation of work devoted to a\n\nstudy of the relationships between the physico-chemical\n\nproperties of soils and their spectral reflectance in the\n\nvisible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe interpretations of these relationships are presented in\n\nsuch a way as to be useful to those engaged in spectroscopic\n\nremote sensing.\n\nUsing the BRF/Spectroradiometer (Exotech Model 20C),\n\nspectral reflectance values in the wavelength region 0.48\n\nto 2.38pm were generated for the 56 samples of benchmark\n\nsoils representing the different climatic regions of the\n\nUnited States (Koppens Classification).\nThese soils also\n\nrepresented eight of the soil orders as defined by the Soil\n\nTaxonomy.\n\nData for 9 measured and 5 calculated properties of\n\nthese samples were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression\n\nanalysis.\nTwenty-one biochemical measurements were made on\n\n27 of the 56 samples in order to study the relationships\n\nbetween organic constituents and spectral reflectance.\n\nSpectral reflectance values at selected wavelength inter\xc2\xad\nvals were designated as the dependent variables and the\n\nphysicochemical properties were the independent variables.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the soil having the highest\n\ncorrelation with spectral response are:\ncation exchange\n\ncapacity, and the contents of silt, clay, iron and organic\n\nmatter.\nSilt content was the single most significant para\xc2\xad\nmeter of those being studied in explaining the spectral\n\nvariations of soils having r-values ranging from 0.41 to 0.62\n\nand 0.63 to 0.70 in the visible and infrared regions, respec\xc2\xad\ntively.\nOrganic matter content contributed significantly\n\n(r = .30-.53) to the explanation of the variation in spectral\n\nresponse in the visible region.\n\nOrganic matter content is inversely proportional to\n\nspectral reflectance.\nAlthough the organic matter content\n\nof the samples studied ranged from 0.09-9.0%, this\n\nparameter does not appear to mask out the contributions of\n\nother soil parameters to spectral variation.\nThe iron con\xc2\xad\ntent of the soil was significant in both visible and\n\ninfrared regions.\nIts significance appeared to be unaffected\n\nby the presence of organic matter.\nThe significance of iron\n\nincreased with increasing wavelengths, possibly due to the\n\n. vibrations and overtones of iron compounds in the middle and\n\nfar infrared.\nClay content was significant in the 0.50 to\n\n\nORIGU\nApAGE\n\noF pooR QUALM\n\n\n2.-6-22\n\n\nTable 2.6-1 \t

the\n\nsignificance of several of the soil parameters (i.e., CEC)\n\nin explaining spectral variations in the visible and infrared\n\nregions.\nCognizance of the dominant mineralogical composition\n\nof an area allows for the prediction of the relationship\n\nbetween spectral reflectance and soil properties.\n\nThe results of the statistical analysis of the relation\xc2\xad\nship between biochemical prope-rties and spectral reflectance\n\nsuggests that there is a significant correlation between the\n\ntwo.\nAdditional research is required before these relation\xc2\xad\nships can be expressed quantitatively.\n\nResults have shown that the grouping of soils from\n\ndifferent climatic zones results in a lowering of the corre\xc2\xad\nlation between reflectance and the physicochemical properties\n\nof the soil.\nThe effect of climate on the physicochemical\n\nnature of soils is at present a qualitative expression.\nThe\n\nclimatic factor cannot be satisfactorily quantified for use\n\nin these types of analysis.\nThe best results were obtained\n\nwhen studying soils from within climatic regions (Figure 2.6-8).\n\nThe near and middle infrared regions offer excellent\n\npossibilities, in many respects superior to visible reflec\xc2\xad\ntance, for quantifying and defining the relationships between\n\nphysicochemical properties of soils and spectral response\n\n(Table 2.6-1).\n\nAlthough the effect of the physicochemical properties\n\nof soils on spectral reflectance is fully understood, the\n\nresults presented here demonstrate the potential for develop\xc2\xad\ning methods of quantifying these relationships and sets the\n\nstage for continuing investigations in this area.\n\n\n2.6-25\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\nSept. 1974.\n\n1. \t Riemer, T.E.,

The principal activity during\n\nthis year has been in documenting an approach to the selection of train\xc2\xad\ning areas. Advances have also been made in defining a statistical approach\n\nto the evaluation of classification accuracy. Additional activity occurred\n\nin the areas fo wavelength band selection, multitemporal analysis and\n\nchange detection. Lastly, an opportunity arose to modify the computer\n\nclassification output so that it would closely resemble a map product.\n\nAs in the past, the primary test site for this activity has remained\n\nthe Sam Houston National Forest. Results will also be reported for data\n\ncollected over the San Juan National Forest in Colorado and the Hoosier\n\nNational Forest in Indiana.\n\nThe material presented in this report summarizes the significant\n\nfindings to date. However, there are still areas of study where more\n\nwork is required. These are identified in Table 2.7-1, the Research\n\nTask Matrix.\n\n\n2.7-2\n\n\nTable 2.7-1\n\nRESEARCH TASK MATRIX\n\n\nCurrent Research Status\n\n\n0\n\nTASKS\n\n(V\nCO\nQ4\n\n00\n\no\n\n1.

However, new\n\ncapabilities often require new programming. The capability to utilize\n\na CalComp Plotter to produce line maps is an example of an area where\n\nnew programming was required. Programming activities were kept to a\n\nminimum and standard programs which appear in the LARSYS 3.1 DOCUMENTA-\n\nTION or are available on the LARSYS Experimental Library were utilized.\n\nData Availability\n\nThe \t ollowing data sets were utilized for analysis:\n\nf\n1. \t\nLANDSAT-l data, multiple dates, for both the Sam Houston\n\nNational Forest and the Hoosier National Forest.\n\n2. \t\nNC-130 aircraft data, MSDS 24 channel scanner, collected\n\nover part of the San Juan National Forest during NASA Aircraft\n\nMission-247.\n\nTest Sites\n\n1. \t\nSam Houston National Forest is located approximately 50 miles north\n\nof Houston on the East Texas Coastal Plain.

The oak-hickory cover pre\xc2\xad\ndominates to the extent that the site is almost a hardwood mono type.\n\n3. \t\nThe San Juan National Forest is located in south west Colorado on\n\nuplifted volcanic material that has been extensively altered by glacia\xc2\xad\ntion.

A necessary requirement for performing this\nevaluation is that the analyst.have good.ground reference-dataavailable.\n\nWithout current ground reference data, either aerial photograph -and/or\n\ndetailed ground cover maps, the evaluation -cannot be-as meanifigful.\n\nUnfortunately, our experience has been that accurate ground informa\xc2\xad\ntion is not-zalways available for forested..test\'sites; Forestttype-maps\ngenerally-indicate- the age, size-and merchantable status of..azfdrest stand..\n\n2.7-5\n\n\nThese qualities may not relate to the stands spectral characteristics\n\nwhich are the basis for the statistical evaluation, so therefore may\n\nor may not be meaningful ground reference information.\n\nProviding suitable ground reference information is available, a\n\nsystematic sample grid can be aligned with the classification. The\n\nanalyst then interprets these fields with the aid of the ground reference\n\ninformation. When the fields have been interpreted, various statistical\n\ntests can be applied to the results and inferences can be drawn about\n\nthe classification accuracy for the entire site. This \'section will\n\nemphasize the statistical test procedures.\n\nFigure 2.7-1 outlines the steps in the statistical evaluation\n\nprocedure. An underlying assumption in this figure is that there\n\nexists a well-defined analysis objective. After obtaining the prelim\xc2\xad\ninary classification, the analysis should question how well it meets the\n\nanalysis objectives. If the analysis is confident in his results there\n\nmay be no need for further evaluation. Undoubtedly, the data analyst\n\nis not the ultimate user of the-classification information. The statis\xc2\xad\ntical evaluation may be used to capture the user confidence and therefore\n\nmay be performed even if the analyst was confident in his results.\n\nThe\'essential steps in the evaluation are:\n\n- List the cover types to be tested\n\n- locate potential test fields by systematic sampling with random\n\nstart\n\n- interpret and label the acceptable test fields\n\n- perform the analysis of variance (including investigation of\n\ninteraction for 2-factor Analysis of Variance) and range test\n\ncalculations.\n\nThe tables which follow illustrate the Analysis of Variance proce\xc2\xad\ndures and are set up in the general form of 1) verbal description of\n\nstep, and 2) numerical example. These tables are applicable in any\n\nsituation by substituting values and performing the new evaluations\n\nbased on the new values.\n\nAnalysis of Variance Tests\n\nRemote sensing MSS data are fundamentally binomial in nature.\n\nPixels in computer classifications are either identified correctly or\n\nincorrectly, hence their binomial distribution. As a result, the arcsin\n\n-Vp transformation should be applied since, according to Steele and Torrie\n\n(1960);\n\n"The data, can be transformed or measured on a new scale of\n\nmeasurement so that the transformed data are approximately\n\nnormally distributed.

This result is not always attained."\n\nThe importance of making the means and variances independent and the\n\nvariances homogeneous is tied into the fact that these basic assumptions\n\nare made when performing an analysis of variance.\n\nRegarding the effect of sample size upon homogeneity of variances,\n\nwe recommend that at least 50 to 100 observations (one pixel = one obser\xc2\xad\nvation) be obtained for each cover type to be tested. This removes\n\nthe need for application of corrections to small sample sizes ( 50) as\n\nrecommended by Snedecor and -Cochran (1967). For sample sizes ranging\n\nfrom 50 to 1000, the comparisons among the percentage accuracy of cover\ntype identification may be somewhat influenced by unequal variances.\n\nBut for most studies an adjustment or weighting by the actual sample\n\nsize is very seldom needed to obtain reasonably good comparisons.\n\nEspecially if the range is from 100 to 500 samples, the assumption of\n\nhomogeneity of variances is not usually violated enough to warrant a\n\nweighted transformation before running an ANOVA.\n\nThe main advantages of the angular (arcsin-V) transformation are\n\nthat the error variance of the resulting observations (in degrees) is\n\napproximately constant, has infinity degrees of freedom (oo df), and is\n\nequal to 821/n ("n"; sample size). The transformation is used as the\n\nunbiased estimator of the mean square error. Since sample sizes will\n\nvary among cover types, the harmonic mean (Table 2.7-7, which averages\n\nthe different numbers of observations per accuracy mean, should be used\n\naccording to Steele and Torrie3 .\n\nTwo analyses of variance which will be encountered most often in\n\nLANDSAT applications are: 1) one-factor ANOVA, and 2) two-factor ANOVA.\n\nThe one-factor ANOVA would be used to test for significant differences\n\namong cover types of a single classification or among overall accuracies\n\nof different classifications of the same data (e.g., wavelength band\n\nstudies). The model for the one-way ANOVA (assuming transformed accuracy\n\nmeans) is:\n\nYi =\n\n+ Ci + E(i)\n\nwhere\n\nYi = the overall accuracy (in degrees) of the i-th classification\n\nor cover type\n\n= true overall accuracy mean\n\nC1 = effect of the i-th classification or cover type\n\nE(i) = random error of the i-th classification or cover type\n\nThe best estimator of E(i) \xc2\xa3s assumed to be 821/n (n= harmonic mean of\n\nsample sizes). This estimator is used as the mean square- error\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOr POOR QUALITY\n\n\n2.7-8\n\n\n(denominator, with infinity degrees of freedom) in the F test for signi\xc2\xad\nficant variation (Tables 2.7-2 and 2.7-3.)\n\nA -two-factor analysis of varrance would entail testing for signifi\xc2\xad\ncant differences among different classifications of the samedata set\n\n(e.g., wavelength band studies) and, at the same time, among cover types\n\nin the same data set. Thus, both factors (classificatimn \'and\'cbver type)\n\nare \t ested simultaneously. The model for a two-factor ANOVA is:\n\nt\nYij \t = p\n\n+\n\nCi + Tj + CTij + E(ij)\n\nwhere\n\nYij\n\n=\n\n\nclassification accura\'cy (in degrees) of the i-th dlassifica\xc2\xad\ntion for the j-th cover type\n\n\n= true overall accuracy mean\n\nCi\n\n\t\n\n= effect of the i-th classification\n\n\nTj \t = effect of the j-th cover type\n\nCTij = effect of the interaction between the i-th classification and\n\n\nthe j-th cover type\n\nE(ij) = random error, which is normally and independently distributed\n\nwith mean = 0 and variance - uz\n\nIf the interaction effect, CTi., is found to be nonsignificant, E(ij)\n\n(which equals 821/n) provides ihe error mean square for the denominator\n\nof the F test. Again, it has infinity degrees freedom, thereby enabling\n\na powerful F test.\n\nSince interaction can occur between classifications and cover types,\n\nthe interaction must be investigated to determine whether it is a\n\n"significant" source of variation. Essentially, an attempt is being made\n\nto find the best estimator of the error mean square for the F test. The\n\ninteraction investigation proceeds as follows (and, Table 2.7-6):\n\nA) \tIf (CTi/df)/821/n) is not significant at a = .25 (F test),\n\nconclude there is no significant interaction and ue 821/n\n\nfor all F tests.\n\nB) \t\nIf it is significant at the .25 level, this may bedue to the\n\n821/n being too small because error other than binomial to normal\n\nis not included in 8 21/n. Hence, obtain the mean square for\n\nnon-additivity with one degree of freedom from Anderson and\n\nMcLean4 .\n\n1) \t the residual mean square is not significantly different at\n\nIf\na = .25, using 8 21/n as-the denominator in the F, then use\n\n\n2.7-9\n\n\n821/n with infinity df for all tests.\n\n2) If the residual mean square is significant at a = .25,\n\nuse the residual mean square for all tests. This mean square\n\nhas finite degrees freedom and provides a less powerful test\n\nthan 821/n with infinity df.\n\nThe Newman-Keuls Range Test is an appropriate test for discerning\n\nwhich accuracy means are significantly different (Table 2.7-7). For\n\nthis and preceding ANOVA\'s, we recommend that the level of significance\n\nbe set at 90% (0.1 alpha). Thus, the tests will be quite "liberal" in\n\nthe sense that if any significant differences exist, they will probably\n\nbe detected. Theoretically, this means that the beta (B) error is made\n\nlow (error of not detecting a significant difference when it truly exists)\n\nat the expense of raising the alpha error (error of denoting significant\n\ndifferences when not truly present).\n\nTest\n\nThe one-factor analysis of variance test was applied to results\n\nobtained for the Sam Houston National Forest. Table 2.7-8 shows the\n\ncalculations and the Newman Keuls Range Test for five differenc cover\n\ntypes. The conclusions drawn from this test is that at the 90% level\n\nthere is no significant differencA between classes one and four, or non\xc2\xad\nforest and pine. In other words, these classes would be difficult to\n\nseparate whereas the remaining classes would be more easily separable.\n\nHowever, the percent of the pixels correctly identified in each class is\n\nnot high. One would expect better accuracy results considering the species\n\ncompostion of the area.\n\nWhat this example typifies is a situation where sufficient ground\n\nreference data were not available for the analyst\'s evaluation. Given\n\nthe information that was available only a limited number of systematic\n\nfields could be evaluated as indicated by the small number of pixels in\n\neach class. If a complete set of aerial photographs were available for\n\nthe entire Sam Houston Test Site, the results of the statistical evalua\xc2\xad\ntion might be different.\n\nWavelength Band Evaluation Studies\n\nDiscussion\n\ni\nOne \t mportant consideration prior to undertaking an analysis task\n\nrelates to the type of data available. The timeliness, quality, and\n\ndata channels available for analysis are factors that must be considered.\n\nFor this particular task we attempted to identify data channels best suit\xc2\xad\ned for forest mapping purposes.

In the first\n\nthe analyst is concerned with selecting a meaningful channel set that will\n\nyield a good classification without using an excessive amount of computer\n\ntime. The time factor is critical in areas where large amounts of data\n\nmust be processed. Generally fewer channels require less processing time.\n\nThe second situation requires -selecting the best channel of.combina\xc2\xad\ntion of channels from data sets collected at different times. The inter\xc2\xad\nactions that must be considered are both occurring within -and between data\n\nsets. This situation generally \'occurs with satellite col-ected data which\nare easily overlayed in registration, as in the case of LANDSAT data.\n\nSingle Data Analysis\n\nThe single data analysis is probably the mostcommon data classifi\xc2\xad\ncation situation attempted. If LANDSAT data is involved, there is not\n\nmuch concern about selection of channels, since only four ane available.\n\nHowever, with aircraft and future satellite systems, the concern for\n\nselecting the "best" channel from a larger mumber of channels is\'under\xc2\xad\nstandable.\n\nFor this study MSDS 24-channel scanner data collected over the\n\nSan Juan National Eorest as part of NASA Mission 247 was utilized.\n\nFigure 2.7-1 indicates the general location of the study site and the\n\ncomposition of the ground cover.. \'These data were collected-August 4.,\n\n1973.\n\n\nCOLORADO\n\n\nX\n\n.Figure 2.7-1\n\nApproximate test site location in Southwestern Colorado.\n\nCover type composition and caption is shown in Migure 2.7-2.\n\n\n2.7-19\n\nC\n\nSF\n\nNr \t\n\nNV\n\nN\n\n\nNP \t\ng:\n\nAA\n\n\nNF \n\n\np\n\n2\n\nFigure 2.7- 2 \tGeneralized forest type map of the test site. \n The classes have been\n\nsimplified from a Forest Service map to indicate the species composi\xc2\xad\ntion of the site.

Realiz\xc2\xad\ning the future significance of the Thematic Mapper (TM) we limited our\n\ninvestigation to a subset of the 24 channels that closely resembled the\n\nTM channels. Table 2.7-10 indicates the proposed TM channels and the MSDS\n\nchannels. The boxes aroung the MSDS channels indicate which were used\n\nfor this study.\n\nTraining sets were picked within the study area that we felt were\n\nrepresentative of the cover types. -These estimations were,based on\xc2\xad\ncoincident aerial photography collected during Mission 247 ,\'and Forest\n\nService cover type maps. The scanner data were processed with the\n\n*SEPARABILITY function of LARSYS. Table 2..7-11 gives the channel combin\xc2\xad\nations for the best 2 through 7 channels. Similar results over the same\n\ntest site were obtained from SKYLAB S-191 data and reported by Hoffer\n\net al: 5.\n\nAll seven channels were used,\'to classify a small poriton of the\n\nstudy area surrounding the Rio Gradne Reservoir,. Figure 2.7-3 shows a\n\nblackand-white\n\nCalComp map of the results of that, classification and a,\ncopy of a color infrared aerial photo from Mission 247. This\' classifi\xc2\xad\ncation can also be compared to Figure 2.7-2 which is the forest service\n\ntype map of the same area. The classification has good visual agreement\nwhen compared with the aerial photo. A certain amount of disagreement\ncan be expected between the classification,and.type map because of the\ndifferent criterion used to develop each map. The classification is\nbased on timber,manage\xc2\xad\nbased on spectral criteria while the type map is,\nment requirements.\nOnce a satisfactory classification for the ten classes of material\n\nhad been developed successive classifications-, each ddleating channel and\n\nusing the next "best" selection of channels were produced\'. This proce\xc2\xad\ndure was followed to determine the point, at which the classification\n\naccuracy for forest falls below the point of being acceptable. Since we\n\nhad no absolute measure of classificatiov accuracy and we were well\n\nsatisfied with the visual correspondence of the seven channel classifica\xc2\xad\ntion and the air photo, we assumed this. classification to be the best.\n\nFor an actual mapping situation, the analyst would attempt to\n\nminimize the number of\' channels used to save processing,costs. Previous\n\nstudies at LARS (Coggeshall and Hoffer, 19736) indicate that past five\n\nchannels the increase in classification accuracy-is not enough to warrant\n\nthe increased processing cost.\n\nThe area estimates for each class of the five classifications were\n\ncompared against the estimated area\' of\' those cover types as mapped on the\n\nseven channel classification. Table 2\'.7-12 gives the percent area for\n\neach cover type for the various classifications. A review of the table\n\nindicates that there were no drastic changes,as the numbers, of channels\n\nwere decreased. If this rela\'tionship is valid for other\'data sets in\n\nother geographic areas it would provide for useful guidance for appling\n\n\n2.7-21\n\n\nrable 2.7-10\n\nProposed Thematic Mapper Channels\n\n\nBendix 24-channel\nData From Mx 247\nSan Juan Test Site\n\nProposed Thematic\n\nMapper Channels\n\nLANDSAT-D\n\n\nch. no.\n\nch. no.

This would be especially\n\ntrue if the analysis objects required specific information on.general\n\nforest cover, an area not drastically affected by a reduction in the num\xc2\xad\nber of channels.\n\nAdditional work along with simulated Thematic Mapper scanner data\n\nshould be pursued, especially in different geographic locations with\n\ndiffering mixes of forest cover types.\n\nMulti-date Analysis\n\nThe LANDSAT satellites provide the opportunity to acquire, register\n\nand analyze multi-date data sets. This capability allows for analysis of\n\ndata in which the identification of certain cover type categories is\n\nmaximized (e.g., such as separating mixed stands of conifers and hard\xc2\xad\nwoods). Once a multi-date data set has been created the analyst is faced\n\nwith the problem of selecting channels from the data available for analysis.\n\nThe channel set selection process would seem identical to the single\n\ndate situation. Indeed, the same *SEPARABILITY processor is used in either\n\nsituation. The problem with multi-date data rests with the selection of\n\nthe appropriate data sets to use for analysis, then further selection of\n\nchannels within those data.\n\nWe had a -seven date LANDSAT data set available over a portion of\n\nthe Hoosier National Forest in central Indiana. Our approach was to first\n\nvisually rank the data over the test site. We felt that if the data were\n\nranked we-could eliminate certain dates based on the appearance of the\n\ndata at that time of year. Our ranking was based on color infrared\n\ncomposites produced on the digital display. Ten categories were ranked\n\non a scale of 0-3, based on how distinguishable that class was at a given\n\ndate.\n\nTable 2.7-13 gives the visual rating for the ten classes. The higher\n\nthe number, the more distinctive the class. Based on this ranking the May\n\ndata set should have been the best for all cover types while the June\n\ndata set the worst.\n\nOur next step was to use the *SEPARABILITY processor to see if these\n\nresults would be comparable. *SEPARABILITY was run independently for each\n\nof the seven dates to determine the channel ranking within the data sets.\n\nThe best two channels for each date were then run through *SEPARABILITY to\n\ndetermine the best channels between data sets. This procedure was repeated\n\nfor the next best two channels so that eventually all 28 channels were\n\nrun through *SEPARABILITY. The data were processed as two groups of 14\n\nrather than one group of 28 for efficiency\'s sake. There are many more\n\ncombinations of 28 than of 14, therefore, consuming more time to produce\n\nthe required information. The results of these efforts are shown in\n\nTable 2.7-14. The channel ranking appears next to the bandwidth which\n\nappears in parenthesis.

June, the lowest\n\nranking in the visual is the best in the numerical ranking. And, in\n\nfact, subsequent analyses has indicated that June is probably a better\n\ndata set for overall analysis than May.\n\nThe May data was collected early in the month before the hardwoods\n\nwere completely leaked out. The variation in leaf cover combined with the\n\nvaried response of the understory made the May data difficult to analyze.\n\nThe understory, especially the dogwood\'s (Cornus florida) above the ridge\n\ntop - which leaf early - inflated the visual rating, causing May to be\n\nranked first.\n\nOn the June data the hardwoods are in their peak growth. \'Spectral\n\nvariability is therefore minimized, and the separability of the hardwoods\n\nfrom the other cover types is maximized. June, however, was an excessibly\n\nwet month.\nMany of the agricultural and pasture land were saturatedithrain\n\nwater. This fact altered the colors in the composit therefore affecting the\n\nvisual analysis.\n\nThe purpose of this comparison is to point out some items worthy of\n\nconsideration. Namely, that once the decision has been made to proceed\n\nwith a multitemporal analysis, it is not an easy matter to select the\n\nappropriate data. Creating a three or more date overlay is neither exped\xc2\xad\nient or cost-effective. Visual interpretation of the data is subject to\n\nhuman bias and errok. Additionally, the study site might not warrant a\n\nmultitemporal analysis.\n\nIn the case of the Hoosier data classification accuracy was acquired\n\nfor seven supervised training classes. The classes included deciduous\n\nand coniferous forest, cropland, pasture, residential, and clear and\n\nturbid water. These results are presented in Table 2.7-15. Accuracy\n\nremains relatively constant from 14 to 2 channels. The 95.5% accuracy\n\nfor the best two channels represent the June data set. This would tend\n\nto indicate that for the Hoosier test site the multi temporal analysis\n\nwas not necessary since a single date data set yields quite reasonable\n\nresults.\n\nChange Detection\n\nThe ability to detect and identify changes in the forest scene are\n\nimportant information to resource managers. The Regional Applications\n\nProject (RAP) is working on developing change detection procedures for\n\nthe Texas Coastal Zone. The FAP staff at LARS-have watched the develop\xc2\xad\nment of these procedures, with the intent of testing which ever procedure(s)\n\nlooking favorable for forestry purposes.\n\nBoth time and the appropriate data sets did not permit testing any\n\nof these procedures. A detailed description of the change detection work\n\nwill be found in the RAP section of this report.\n\n\n2.7-30\n\n\nTable 2.7-15\n\nRANKING OF MULTITEMPORAL DATA SET\n\nTraining Classification Accuracy (%)\nBest N Channels\nBest 2 of 4 channels\nper date*\n\nOther 2 of 4 channels\nPer date\n\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n\n99.0\n98.8\n99.0\n98.8\n98.8\n98.4\n98.4\n98.5\n\n99.4\n\n99.4\n98.9\n98.8\n98.8\n\n98.6\n\n98.9\n98.1\n\n6\n\n98.0\n\n98.0\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n98.2\n98.0\n97.7\n95.5\n70.4\n\n97.7\n97.1\n\n96.7\n\n94.6\n\n74.5\n\n\n* The highest average transformed divergence of the Separability\n\nprocessor was used to determine the "best" channel subsets\'. The\nseven supervised training classes included: deciduous forest,\n\nconiferous forest, cropland, pasture, residential, clear water,\n\nand turbid water.\n\n\n2.7-39\n\n\nCalComp Capabilities\n\nComputer-aided analysis of MSS data can be a powerful tool for\n\nresource managers if results from such analysis are in a user compatibl-q:\n\nformat. Previously, classification results have been available as photo\xc2\xad\ngraphs, either color or black-and-white or as alphanumeric printouts.\n\nAlthough attractive, photographs tend to be costly and difficult to field\n\nannotate. Printouts are cumbersome to handle in the field and difficult\n\nto use if minor class changes are required. Both photos and printouts\n\nrequire reclassification if class changes or modifications are required.\n\nClearly, an improved map display was warranted. Maplike quality and\n\nease of annotating or making minor class changes were important factors\n\nfor consideration. An opportunity to pursue this activity occurred\n\nduring the early part of the contract year. The resultant product\n\n(example Figure 2.7-3) is a line map produced by a CalComp Plotter. A\n\nseries of subroutines have been written to convert the information on\n\na LARSYS results tape to a format acceptable to the CalComp drum plotter\n\nlocated at Purdue University\'s Computer Center.\n\nThe CalComp will produce maps at different scales and also with\n\ndifferent color codings and boundary symbols. However, the most impressive\n\nfeature, from a user\'s point of view, is the familiarity of the classifi\xc2\xad\ncation to a map. Field annotations or changes can be easily added.\n\nErroneously classified areas readily changes by drafting the correction\n\nprovided the change is a minor one or one that reflects human influence\n\nrather than spectral class. For example, young regenerated pine will be\n\nclassified as brushland because spectrally the classes are similar. To\n\nchange the classification would be difficult, if not impossible, and a\n\ncostly proposition. Forest managers have information about regenerated\n\nareas, so can easily alter the map to reflect the true nature of the land.\n\n\n2; 7-32\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nConclusions\n\nResults from this contract year\'s activities lead to the following\n\nconclusions:\n\nIn\n1. \t order to attain user acceptance of LANDSAT or other remote\n\nsensor data, more training,and demonstration material high\xc2\xad\nlighting specific applications will have to be developed.\n\n2. \t\nEvaluation of classification accuracy is still a difficult task.\n\nUsers will be slow to accept computer-aided classifications until\n\nthey can be convinced of the accuracy of the results.\n\n3. The aircraft wavelength bands which simulate the thematic mapper\n\nchannel configuration yield reasonable classification results\n\nfor a forest test site in southwestern Colorado.\n\n4. Results for the multitemporal analysis task are hot detailed\n\nenough to draw extensive conclusions. More work should be\n\npursued in defining the interactions in the data sets. Current\xc2\xad\nly, these analyses are more art than science.\n\n5. No. definite conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of\n\nchange detection activities for forestry purposes.\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Applications case studies should continue to be developed. These\n\nshould highlight activities in timber, range or other areas of\n\nresource management.\n\n2. \t\nSupport should be continued in the area of determining classifi\xc2\xad\ncation accuracy from computer assisted analysis. Support should\n\nalso be available for work in assigning mapping accuracies= to\n\ncomputer classified data. Both these areas are important is\n\nuser acceptance of the technology is expected to increase.\n\n3. \t\nWork should be continued with Thematic Mapper simulated data for\n\nother major ecosystems in the country. Specific emphasis of\n\nthese studies should be directed at defining the type of infor\xc2\xad\nmation that can be expected over various forest conditions given\n\nthe increased spectral rnage and resolution of the Thematic Mapper.\n\n4. \t understanding of the interactions between data sets is an\n\nAn\nimportant aspect of multi temporal analysis. More work is\n\nnecessary in describing and understanding these interactions\n\nbefore repeatable analysis techniques can be developed.\n\n\n2.7-33\n\n\n5. \t\nChange detection techniques can provide valuable information\n\nto resource managers.

In response to\n\nFederal legislation designed to give impetus to programs in land resource\n\nmanagement at the state level, NASA/JSC conceived the Regional Applications\n\nProject (RAP).\nThe primary RAP objective is:\n"To define, design and develop, and demonstrate a Regional\n\nLand Resources Inventory System(s), which utilizes in part\n\ninformation extracted from remotely sensed data for the\n\ninventory and monitoring of regional land resources in\n\nsupport of resource development and use management." I\n\nWith the present State of Texas emphasis on the development of a\n\ncoastal zone management program, an obvious and immediate requirement\n\narises for coastal zone remote sensing applications. For this reason,\n\nand for technical reasons associated with the natural diversity of\n\ncoastal environments and socio-economic dynamics, the Texas Coastal Zone\n\nwas \t he first problem area to be addressed in the RAP.-\n\nt\nIn concert with other efforts to reach the RAP objective, a\n\nSupporting Research and Technology (SR&T) program with the Laboratory for\n\nApplications of Remote Sensing (LARS) was initiated as part of RAP. Two\n\ngeneral technical objectives were proposed in the LARS/SR&T effort to\n\ninitiate a remote sensing inventorying and monitoring capability in\n\nTexas. These-were:\n\n1. \t\nDetermining the feasibility of replicating the Bureau of\n\nEconomic Geology (BEG) environmental planning units using\n\ncomputer-aided classification of LANDSAT data, and\n\n2. \t\nDevelopment of a change detection procedure.\n\nThe \t irst objective was addressed during "175. CY76 was a continu\xc2\xad\nf\nation of the LARS investigation for RAP. The main thrust of the CY76\n\neffort was the implementation and comparison of change detection techniques\n\nfor identifying and monitoring changes of interest occurring in the Texas\n\nCoastal Zone.\n\nThe test area for this effort was located in the Matagorda Bay,\n\nTexas estuarine system. A detailed description of this coastal zone\n\narea is contained in references 2 and 3. Specific test sites were those\n\nareas covered by the Austwell; Port Lavaca, E.; Port O\'Connor; and\n\nPass Cavallo, SW USGS 7 minute Topographic Quadrangles.\n\n\n2.8-2\n\n\nAPPROACH\n\nLANDSAT data were used as the data input for all computer analysis\n\nduring this effort. The following data were utilized:\n\nScene ID\n1127-16260\n1289-16261\n1505-16230\n2034-16200\n\nDate of Collection\nNovember 27, 1972\nMay 8, 1973\nDecember 10, 1973\nFebruary 25, 1975\n\nCollection Platform\nLANDSAT-l\nLANDSAT-l\nLANDSAT-l\nLANDSAT-2\n\nThe applicable portions of each of these data sets were overlayed\n\nand registered to ground control points to produce a four date temporal\n\ndata set for each of the 4 quadrangle areas included in the study. These\n\ndata sets were prepared such as to produce line printer output at a\n\nscale of 1:24,000. A non-supervised approach was used to produce a\n\nsingle date classification for each date for each quadrangle area.\n\nThese classifications were used as base line data. Various change\n\ndetection techniques were applied to these data sets to test the\n\nperformance of the individual techniques.\n\nReference data utilized to support the analysis of the LANDSAT data\n\nincluded 1970, 1971 and 1975 color and color infrared aerial photography,\n\nthe Geologic Atlases compiled by the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology,\n\nand Spectral Environmental Classification overlays produced by Lockheed\n\nElectronics Corp./JSC.\n\n\n2.8-3\n\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nPreprocessing\n\nThe four frames previously described were geometrically corrected\n\nand spatially registered to produce an individual four date multitemporal\n\ndata set for each of the four quadrangle areas.\n\nThe registration process was accomplished using the following\n\nprocedure. First, an area which was covered by the eleven original USGS\n\nquadrangles of interest was registered utilizing a biquadratic fit and\n\nnearest neighbor interpolation. Second, a coarse geometric correction\n\nwas applied to this scene. Third, the four original individual\n\nquadrangles were precision registered to ground control points.\n\nA more detailed description of the registration process follows.\n\nInitially, a base or reference run is chosen. The reference scene\n\nidentifier*to which all other scenes are registered and the three\n\nadditional scene identifiers are shown below:\n\n\nNASA ID\n\nLARSYS ID\n\nDATE\n\n\n1127-16260\n\n72072100\n\nNovember 27, 1972\n\n\n*1289-16261\n\n73126200\n\nMay 8, 1973\n\n\n1505-16230\n2034-16200\n\n73126501\n75000200\n\nDecember 10, 1973\n\nFebruary 25, 1975\n\n\nThe automatic numerical integration correlation algorithm of the\n\nLARS Image Registration System was utilized to acquire checkpoints.\n\nLocations were determined to be the areas of peak correlation in each\n\narea (4096 pixels) checked. After the checkpoints between the reference\n\nand each of the overlaying scenes were acquired, a least squares\n\nregression was conducted to produce a six coefficient biquadratic fit.\n\nThe resultant fit had an RMS error of less than .500 for the accepted\n\ninput checkpoints. The checkpoints were selected for land areas only\n\nand were well distributed throughout these areas. The three additional\n\nscenes were then registered to the reference scene. In the reference\n\nscene the area of interest had the following line and column coordinates:\n\n\nLINE\nFirst Line\nLast Line\nLine Interval\n\nCOLUMN\n\n1000\n2330\n1\n\nFirst Column\n1\n\nLast Column\n1634\n\nColumn Interval\n1\n\n\nNext, a coarse geometric correction was performed on the 16-channel\n\nregistered data set. Utilizing the latitude of the area to be corrected,\n\nthis process accomplished three tasks: (a) the image was adjusted in\n\naspect ratio and rotated to true north, (b) the data were deskewed and\n\nadjusted for approximately 1:24,000 scale output from the line printer;\n\n\n2.8-4\n\n\nnearest neighbor interpolation is utilized in the output pixel deter\xc2\xad\nmination and Cc) a precision registration or "fine correction" was\n\nperformed.\n\n\nCheckpoints of land features found in the reference scene image as\n\nwell as the appropriate USGS quadrangle were identified. A minimum of\n\n20 well distributed checkpoints per quadrangle was required. The\n\nquadrangle maps were then individually digitized and the associated\n\nmeasurements translated into lines and columns of the line printer\n\n(the line printer is rated at eight lines and ten columns per inch).\n\nThe checkpoints were then subjected to a least squares regression\n\nanalysis producing the coefficients (six each per line and column) of\n\nthe biquadratic fit. The biquadratic fit was utilized to produce the\n\nfinal output image. A 0.500 RMS error was the threshold for checkpoints\n\nused in the nearest neighbor interpolation. The upper lefthand corner\n\n\nof the line printer output matches the upper lefthand corner of the\n\nquadrangle map. This procedure was completed for the Austwell; Port\n\nLavaca, E.; Pass Cavallo, SW; and Port O\'Connor quadrangle areas.\n\nChange Detection\n\nFour techniques for detecting change were selected for evaluation.\n\nAll four techniques require temporal data which have been spatially\n\nregistered prior to analysis. Due to a lack of data, the Austwell\n\nquadrangle overlay does not include complete coverage for the November 27,\n\n1972 and December 10, 1973 data.\n\nA brief description of the four change detection methods follows:\n\n(a) Post Classification Detection - Remote sensor data are independently\n\nclassified at both times tI and t2 using whatever analysis techniques are\n\nappropriate. A direct change comparator is then used to code changes\n\nin a resulting change classification for each pixel. For example, if a\n\ntwo class classification is obtained, e.g., (1) land, and (2) water, then\n\nfour change comparator results are possible: (1) land to land, (2) land\n\nto water, (3) water to water, (4) water to land. An output product is\n\nmade showing the subset of changes which is of interest to the user.\n\n(b) Delta Data Change Detection - This method is based on differencing\n\n(subtracting) remote sensor data from one time and another creating a\n\nnew difference (called Delta) data set. Multispectral classification\n\ntechniques are used to analyze and classify change in the Delta data.\n\nIt is assumed that no-change conditions will result in nominally zero\n\nvalues and these will be combined into one general class. Only one\n\nclassification is required with this technique rather than two for\n\ndirect change detection.\n\n(c) Spectral/Temporal Change Classification - The aggregate of all\n\nspectral channels from the two dates is used in a change-no change\n\nclassification in which the classifier is trained to separate out the\n\n\n2.8-5\n\n\ndifferent categories. Certain of the spectral/temporal classes would be\n\ndue to all objects in the scene which did not change and others would\n\nbe related to those which did change. This technique requires only\n\none classification but it could be an eight-channel classification.\n\n(d) Layered Spectral/Temporal Change Classification - This method is\n\nsimilar to (c) except that the layered classifier is used to perform a\n\nhierarchical classification from general classes down to specific\n\nclasses. For example, change and no-change would be separated in one\n\ndecision then further classifications would be performed to identify\n\nspecific change.\n\nEvaluation of the change detection techniques consisted of comparing\n\ntechniques b, c, and d to the post classification change detection\n\noutput. This approach was taken since adequate reference data did not\n\nexist to allow for a direct visual (photo interpretative) analysis of\n\nchange which had occurred between the various dates.\n\nInitially, it had been planned to conduct the change detection\n\ndevelopment effort utilizing the November 1972 and December 1973 data\n\nsets. Since these two data sets lack only 13 days of being a year\n\napart, the assumption of little or no seasonal changes nor sun angle\n\neffects would have been reasonable. This would have greatly simplified\n\nthe development of procedures to detect permanent change. However, since\n\nneither data set had supporting ground truth, this approach was not\n\nfeasible. Thus, the approach was modified to include the February 1975\n\ndata set, which includes supportive ground truth, in place of the\n\nDecember 1973 data. This introduced the problem of working with data\n\nsets containing large amounts of seasonal change and sun angle effects\n\nin addition to the permanent change of interest. Progress to date has\n\nbeen limited to detecting change within the Port O\'Connor quadrangle\n\narea using only two dates of coverage:\n\nDate\n\nScene ID\n\n\nNovember 27, 1972\nFebruary 25, 1975\n\n1127-16260\n\n2034-16200\n\n\nEach of the four change detection techniques is discussed in more\n\ndetail in the following portions of the report.\n\nPost Classification Change Detection\n\nPost classification change detection is based on the post-classifi\xc2\xad\ncation comparison of independently produced classifications of an area.\n\nThe comparator, as the name suggests, is simply a processor that\n\n"compares" two separate standard LARSYS classifications made of each\n\ndate and generates a results tape in standard LARSYS format. The\n\ncomparisons are based on a logical array initialized by the user\xc2\xad\nspecified (change) classes. Thus, the change classes derived from this\n\n\n2-8-6\n\n\nmethod are defined rather than, identified and:the.processing is\n\nlogical rather than spectral 4 .\n\nBy properly coding the\'classification results for times t, and t2 ,\n\nthe analyst can produce change maps which show a complete matrix of\n\nchange. In addition, groupingof classification results allows the\n\nanalysts to observe any subset of changes which,may -eof interest.\n\nGrouping of the spectral,classes is usually necessary when defining\nchange classes as the possible class- combinations MX)\' can be a\nprohibitivenumber depending on the number-of classes (M, N) in each\nclassification\nInitial testing of the post classification changedetection.tech\xc2\xad\nnique was directed toward the Port Lavaca, E. quadrangle area using the\n\nregistered data from November 1,972 and February 1975. The technique\n\ndid indicate change was- occurring within the Port Lavaca quadrangle area.\n\nHowever, the area being categorized as- change was due primarily to\n\nseasonal changes and tidal variations,. Comparison of-simulated false\n\ncolor images of this area supported this inference. Since this quadrangle\n\nappeared-to contain little permanent change, future work was directed\n\ntoward the Port O\'Connor area.\n\nSimulated false color images of the .Port O\'Connor area indicated\n\nthat major changes of a permanent nature.had occurred between November\n\n1972 and February 1975. These changes .appeared as ranchland burns,\n\nspoil areas, coastal changes, and urban,development.\n\nSingle date-unsupervised classifications of the Port O\'Connor area\nusing the registered data from November 1972 and February 1975 were\nproduced for comparison to each other. \'There are several methods\nutilized by analysts at LARS for obtaining reference spectral classes.\nIn this analysis false color images, produced from a.CRT digital\ndisplay unit, were used to. obtain.an overview of the Port O\'Connor area\nand to locate, areas of interest. Some-detailed information about the\n-surfacefeatures of the coastal zone were also obtained from these images.\nAfter the false color images were studied, individual data channels\n\n-were displayed on the CRT to select training sites of land and water\n\nareas. Three training sites were chosen to represent the land areas\n\nand an additional three were chosen to represent the water "areas.- The\n\ndescription of these areas is shown below:\n\nPort O\'Connor\n\nLARS Run Number\n72072105\n\nSite\n\nLines\n\nColumns\n\nLand 1\nLand 2\nLand 3\n\n96 to 130 x 1\n36 to 90x 1\n69 to 81x 1\n\n4 to \'24 x 1\n30 to 88 x 1\n136 to 158 x 1\n\n2.8-7\n\nGIO\nNA 113\nPIOORQUitiff\nLARS Run Number\n72072105 \t\n\nSite\n\nLines \t\n\nWater 1\nWater 2\nWater 3\n\n152 to 183 m 1\n110 to 150x 1\n19 to 48 x 1\n\nColumns\n\n11 to 52 x 1\n\n08 to 143x 1\n\n170 to 194-x 1\n\n\nTwo cluster analyses were conducted, one combining the three\n\ntraining sites for the land area and one combining the three training\n\nsites for the water areas. Because of storage limitations, each cluster\n\nanalysis was conducted on 10,000 or fewer data points. The number of\n\nclasses specified during clustering was 13 and 8 for the land and water\n\nareas respectively. These numbers were chosen because they appeared to\n\nrepresent the maximum number of spectrally separable classes that\n\nexisted within the scene. During clustering, a 99.5% convergence value\n\nwas used to decrease the amount of computer time required if 100%\n\nconvergence was selected.\n\nThe cluster output included a cluster map showing the location of\n\nthe spectral classes and a punched output of field description cards\n\nfor each of the cluster classes. The field description cards were\n\nobtained using a "minpoint" option of 3. This requires that 3\n\nspectrally similar points must occur together before they can be\n\ndescribed as a field. The number 3 was selected since fewer points\n\nintroduce a large variance within the classes and since most areas of\n\ninterest are contained within the 180 meter size of 3 data points.\n\nThe field description cards obtained from the cluster analysis were\ninput into a statistics processor to obtain the mean spectral response\nof each cluster class in all four channels and their covariance matrix.\nThese mean values are used to calculate a ratio A = V where V is the\nIR\n\n\nrelative intensity of the visible wavelengths [(0.5 to 0.6m) +\n\n(0.6 to 0.7pm)] and IR is the relative intensity of the reflective\n\ninfrared wavelengths [(0.7 to 0.8im) + (0.8 to l.lim)].\n\nBy summing the relative intensity values of all four bands the\n\nmagnitude of relative spectral responses can be obtained as shown in the\n\nfollowing equation:\n\n=\nSummed response \t (0.50 to 0.60pm) + (0.60 to 0.70pm) +\n\n(0.70 to 0.80um) + (0.80 to 1.10um).\n\nBy observing the ratio A and the summed response, the analyst tentatively\n\nidentified the cluster classes. These classes were then maintained,\n\npooled or deleted based upon their separability as determined by their\n\nratios.\n\nCovariance matrix and mean vector statistics of these classes were\n\nused to classify the quadrangle area. The classification was output\n\nusing the PRINTRESULTS processor with a threshold value of 0.5. Often\n\nin a classification, there are points which in reality are not\n\n\n2.88\n\n\nrepresented by any of the training classes. The dladifier\'necessarily\n\nassigns all points to one of the training classes. Thresholding\n\ndelineates these points and rejects them from the printed results. New\n\ntraining fields were hand-picked from the thresholded areas and their\n\ncovariance matrix, mean vector statistics and ratids calculated.\n\nThe statistics of these new classes were merged with the previously\n\ncalculated statistics and the quadrangle-area reclassified.\n\n\'The Port O\'Connor quadrangle was classified into 25 and 22\n\nspectrally separable classes for the November 1972 and February 1975\n\ndates, respectively.\n\nPrior to conducting the post 61ssffication change comparison\n\nbetween these two classifications, it was decided to group the spectral\n\nclasses into information classes to reduce the number of "changes"\n\nobserved. This was accomplished with the addition of the reference\n\ndata which consisted of color infrared (CIR) photography (1971, 1975)\n\nand "Spectral Environmental Classification" overlays at a scale of\n\napproximately 1:24,000. These environmental classifications furnished\n\nby LEC/JSC were prepared using CIR photography and ground observations.\n\nThe \'71 photography was augmented by an overlay prepared by LEC/JSC\n\noutlining 34 photointerpreted (training) areas.\n\nThe initial step correlated the 18 spectral classes (land areas\n\nonly) of the computer classifications produced from the February \xc2\xa3975\n\ndata with the photointerpreted informational classes contained in the\n\nSpectral Environmental Classification. These infdrmational classes\n\nwere vegetated and non-vegetated classes d\'ifferentiated into subclasses\n\nby ground condition; WET/DRY and surface cover. To accomplish this,\n\nthe environmental classification was overlaid on the computer classifi\xc2\xad\ncation (Feb \' 5 data only) and the frequency distributions 6f the\n7\nspectral classes versus the informational classes were drawn up\n\n(Table 2.8-1). Due to the approximate-scale of the overlays and some\n\nminor discrepancies in the image registrat\xc2\xb1on of the data sets the\n\noverlay could not be perfectly aligned with the classification. This\n\nimplied that the distributions would\'change depending on how the two\n\nwere aligned. However, this change was regarded as negligible. As\n\nshown in Table 2.8-1 only 24 of-the total 55 photointerpreted informational\n\nclasses -were relevant to the Port O\'Connor area.\n\nThe percent distribution of each spectral class in the informational\n\nclasses was calculated (Table 2.8-2) from which the rdlatioidhip of only 4\n\nspectral classes (Feb 1, Feb 12, Feb 13 and Feb A) became evident on a\n\none-to-one correspondence. The classes from the environmental classifi\xc2\xad\ncation were then generalized into broad classes on the basis of their\n\nground condition and surface cover.\n\n\n2.8-9\n\nTable 2.8-1 \tPoint frequency distribution of February \'75 spectral classes\n\nversus the spectral environmental classes.\n\n\n-Vt--\n\nI\t\nP;\n\n8\n\n33W\nus\n\n-lf \t\n\nAI\n\nfr t\n\n\'.s 104 57 1\nLI\n1L._ I s7 z\n\nat\n\nhSA\n\nt2\n\ni.15A\n\n3d 54 \t 1.7.f \t\n260\n\nS34\n\nq _w\nW\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMwt\n..\xc2\xb1ta./\xc2\xb1Ia \t\n\nL\n\nJIG \t\n\nGd..\n\nI\n\n&\n\nlo\n_ \ti\n\n-3\n\n...\n.zq2 \t\niz&\n.o\n\nig,\n\n-9\n\n274f\n\nI isl\n\n-e6\n\nz\n_f\n\nl\n\n1\n\n&m I\n14\n\nzz\nali\n\n5\nfI\n\nL\n\n49\nl.\n\nLP\n\n\'3\n\n2V\xc2\xb1\n\n41\n\nIs&5\n\nSy4.8\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n.Z-\t\n\nAt .1\n\nB7155 3W\n\n2\n\nB.\n\n12.\n\n-\n\nZ6-7\n\n----- ZL 2,__7\n\n__\n\n+_L\n\n__L~c ~\n\nWt\n\n.\n\n8\n\n7a\n\ni\n\n---1.\n\n.L_\n\n___-I- Al. 9; \t\n\n__--_-\n\n2\n--\n\n-\n\n--\n\n-\n\nW r\n\nTF\nITEL\n\nTF I\n\n\'RS\n\nIq\n\n11\nL\n\n8\n\nLI\n\nS\n\nI\n\n1\n\n2L_\n\n-A. 3-\n\n5\n\n-8-\n\n-\n\n~4\n\nq\n\nJ\n\nf\n\nI\n\n.Th\n70\n\nZi~\nZI\n\n2\n\n91% 324{ 79\n\n127; i\n\n4\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTF\n\nV\n\nB5\n\n-I\n\n!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nj\n\nS\n\nF__\nMmO\nA\n\n.\n\n41,t\'IS\n\nORIGINAL PAGE, is\n\nI\n\n?A_\n\nJz\n\nTable 2.8-2.\n\nPercentage frequency distribution of Feb 75\nspectral classes versus the spectral environmental\nclasses.\n\nPcM o\'CV\nFebA FebC Feb I\nWet\n\nHE\n\n0S\n\n03\n\n(Feb. \'75)\n\nFeb 2 Feb 3 Feb 4 Feb 5 Feb 6 Feb 7 Feb 9 Feb 10 Feb 11 Feb 12 Feb 13 Feb 14 Feb15 Feb 16 Feb 17\n04\n\n08\n\n04\n\n06\n\n08\n\n11\n\n17\n\n11\n\nRg\n\ni0\n\n01\n\n08\n\n02\n\nno\n\n01\n\nOS\nbe\n\n03\n06\n\n04\n08\n\n08\n15\'\n\n04\n07\n\n06\n10\n\n08\n10\n\n11\n06\n\n17\n04\n\n11\n03\n\n%let\n\nHI\n\n01\n09\n\n08\nI\n\n06\n01\n\n11\n01\n\n16\n01\n\n07\n01\n\n10\n34\n\n10\n03\n\n06\n03\n\n04\n09\n\n03\n08\n\n01\n10\n\nWet\n\nmw\nmt\n\n01\n\nOS\n\n03\n\n0I\n\n09\n\n01\n\n12\n\n03\nI0\n04\n02\n16\n\n09\n14\nA\n03\n53\n\n09\nis\n43\n01\n59\n\n01\n01\nO5\n\n12\n24\n40\n\n06\n\n64\n\n61\n\n19\n01\n20\n17\n0\n01\n27\n02\n\n04\n\n05\nle\n14\n\n16\n01\n17\n34\n27\n\n12\n\n01\n\n04\n01\n05\n34\n44\n02\n80\n\n12\n34\n21\n01\n56\n01\n\n04\n10\n09\nO\n01\n20\n05\n\n02\'\n01\n\'01\n04\n03\n\n01\n01\n01\n\nbi\n01\n\n02\n02\n\n16\n18\n\n06\n07\n\n44\n50\n\n85\n89\n\n02\n\n01\n\n02\n\n01\n\n01\n01\n\n10\n\nDry\n\nDry\n\nmg\n\nmd\nMdg\n\nP01\nEM\n\n33\n01\n\nMc\n\n02\n03\n\ngnmred mag\n\nDry\nNon-\n\nBS\nB\n\nVeg.\n\nB\n\n02\no4\n02\n04\n\nk~a\n\nFi\n\n01\n\n73\n16\n89\n\n04\n14\n02\n06\n22\n\n01\n\n01\n\n01\n61\n\n01O\n17\n\n02\n\n108\n\nNMa\n\nW\n\n03\n\n01\n\n63\n01\n\n18\n02\n\n03\n.6i\n\n01\n0l\n\n06\n07\n\n01\n03\n\n01\n\n01\n\n01\n01\n03\n\n01\n01\'\n\n02\n\n02\n\n16\n\n08\n14\n\n12\n08\n\n01\n06\n\n02\n02\n\n16\n03\n\n15\n02\n\n08\n21\n\n06\n19\n\n02\n45\n\n09\n01\ni0\n19\n41\n01\n61\n\n13\nOl\n14\nis\n08\n\n01\n\n01\n01\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n03\n\n05\n06\n\n04\n\nU1\n\n04\n01\n\n07\n18\n0l\n\n01\n\n01\n\n01\n01\n\n01\ni\n\nU1\n01\n\n01\n07\n03\n03\n3.3\n\n\'01c\n26\n04\n24\n54\n\n25\n03\n16\n44\n\n01\n\n58\n73\n\n01\n\n23\n01\n\n04\n04\n\n01\n\n01\n01\n23\n06\n14\n43\n\n01\n01\n\n01\n\n02\n\n01\n\n02\n\n01\n\n01\n\n01\n\n02\n04\n\n01\n02\n\n01\n03\n\n01\n\n01\n03\n01\n05\n09\n\n1\nC>\n\n2.8-11\n\n\nThe aggregated percentages of the spectral classes according to\n\nthese groupings helped identify most of the remaining classes. However,\n\nfor 6 of the spectral classes the percentage totals did not exceed 50%\n\n(the criterion used to assign a spectral class to an informational class).\n\nIt was observed that these classes mainly occurred in the vegetated and\n\nnon-vegetated classes that were inundated (covered with water).\n\nAddition of their percent distributions regardless of surface cover\n\nyielded totals exceeding 50. The classes were then identified as\n\ninundated or submerged grass and tidal flats. Spectral class Feb C could\n\nnot be assigned to any informational group because of its widespread\n\ndistribution in all the informational classes. It was labeled as a\n\nconfusion class. The final spectral class definition and groupings are\n\nshown in Table 2.8-3.\n\nThe reference data for the November 1972 classification consisted of\n\nCIR photography bbtained in 1971 and a photointerpreted overlay contain\xc2\xad\ning 34 training areas.\n\nThese interpreted areas were approximately located on both the\n\n"Spectral Environmental Classification\' and the computer classification.\n\nSince the two photointerpretative overlays were prepared using different\n\nclassification schemes, the environmental classification was used to\n\nupdate the names of some of the interpreted areas, e.g., some of them\n\ninterpreted as transitional areas were renamed grazed woody/herbaceous.\n\nFiom the frequency of occurrence of the spectral classes within these\n\ntraining areas, the spectral classes were identified and grouped\n\n(Table 2.8-4).\n\nThis aggregation allowed for a more manageable number of classes in\n\nthe initial change detection technique development. If the spectral\n\nclasses were not grouped, a classification containing 22 spectral classes\n\ncould yield 462 possible change classes. Grouping to 6-8 classes\n\nreduces to 30-56 the number of change classes. The spectral classes\n\nwere grouped into 5 and 6 informational groups (Table 2.8-5) for the\n\nNovember 1972 and February 1975 classifications, respectively.\n\nThis exercise allowed the analyst to have a good representation of\n\nthe February classification with regard to the relationships between\n\nspectral and information classes. However, since there was no concurrent\n\nground truth for the 1972 data, only inferences could be made concerning\n\nthe combination of these spectral and informational classes.\n\nThe November 1972 and February 1975 classifications which had been\n\ngrouped into 5 and 6 groups, respectively, allowed for a possible matrix\n\nof 25 change classes. Further grouping of the land classes (woody/\n\nherbaceous, urban) and the water classes (water, spoil and submerged)\n\nin date 1 reduced the number of possible "change" classes to 11. From\n\nTable 2.8-6 it is evident that the first 5 classes are actually "no change"\n\nclasses (i.e., they remain constant in both dates) and the remaining\n\n6 classes define the changes.\n\n\nQJIoJ79\n\n\n2.8-12\n\n\nTable 2.8-3\n\nPort O\'Connor,\n\nFebruary 1975\n\nClass-Definitions and- Grouping\n\nGroup \t\n\nClasses\n\n\n1. \t\nUrban\n\nFeb I -Tdu\n\n2. \tMixed Woody/\nHerb.

The results are displayed in Figure 2.8-1.\n\nVisual inspection of the classification map and its accompanying\n\nspectral environmental overlay in Figure 2.8-1 shows a. good correlation\nbetween the two. The burned areas (represented by symbol B) and the\n\nspoil banks (symbol S) along the intracoastal waterway are well\n\ndelineated. New urban construction denoted by symbol "U" seems in\n\ngood agreement with areas marked Mmu (Man-made urban) on the overlay.\n\nThe \'+\' symbol representing the change class of land-submerge occurs\n\nmainly along the shoreline delineating the tidal flats (TFi on the\n\noverlay). The no change classes of woody/herbaceous, water, spoil,\n\nurban and submerged are shown by the symbols "., (blank), S, A and I"\n\nrespectively. The blank areas also represent the confusion class of\n\ndate 2 (Feb 1975) which was ignored in the change matrix.\n\nThe computer time involved in executing the post classification\n\nchange comparator was minimal; this effort required approximately 7\n\nseconds CPU. However, the fact that two separate classifications\n\nmust be performed before the comparator can be used should not be\n\noverlooked.\n\nDelta Change Detection\n\nThe change detection method referred to as the delta method is\n\nbased on multispectral difference image classification. Whereas the\n\nother three methods studied use classifications of the original multi\xc2\xad\nspectral data, the delta method requires that the spectral values from\n\ntwo times for each pixel first be subtracted, producing a "differential\n\nimage" form of the data. The principle behind this approach is simply\n\nthat changes from one time-to another will produce a non-zero result\n\nwhich can be detected by a variety of methods. The points which do not\n\nchange would remain nominally at zero. Sun angle and atmospheric\n\ndifferences are expected to cause non-zero deltas for no-change con\xc2\xad\nditions; however, the no change classes would in this case have some\n\npositive or negative value which can be biased out leaving the change\n\nvalues equally detectable.\n\nThe difference or delta transformation combines two n channel\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2multispectral images obtained at different times and produces a multi\xc2\xad\nspectral delta image having n channels. Change can then bedetected\n\neither by examining the images directly or by first classifying the\n\ndelta data, then examining the results displayed in image form.\n\nMost image processing systems assume all image samples are non\xc2\xad\n-negative and this is true for the LARSYS system used in this study.

The\n\nmethod emphasizes multispectral change classification rather than changes\n\nin multispectral classification. Implementation of an automatic scheme\n\nin either case requires image registration. A comparison of steps for\n\nthe two approaches is:\n\nChange Detection by\nClassification of Delta Images\n\nObservation of Change\n\nin Classifications\n\n\n1. \tTemporal Image Registration\n\n1.\n\nCluster Analysis at time t1\n\n\n2. \tDelta Transformation\n\n2.\n\nTrain Classifier-for time t1\n\n\n3. \tCluster Analysis\n\n3.\n\nClassify time t1\n\n\n4. \tTrain Classifier\n\n4.\n\nCluster Analysis at time t\n\n\n5. \tClassify Delta Imagery\n\n5.\n\nTrain Classifier at time t2\n\n\n6. \tClassify time t2\n\n7. \tRegister Classifications\n\n8. \tProcess Classifications to\n\nDetermine Changes\n\nIn addition to requiring fewer steps the Delta Image method may\n\nrequire less training activity since all features that do not change do\n\nnot have to be isolated and described. The method proposed here uses\n\nnon-supervised classification (clustering) to identify samples charac\xc2\xad\nterizing various change conditions. These samples are used to train a\n\n\n2.8-19\n\n\nsupervised classifier to classify each delta image point over an arbi\xc2\xad\ntrarily large area. The results can then be displayed in map form and\n\ntabular form the same as for the spectral classification case.\n\nThe delta method was tested on. the Port O\'Connor quadrangle as were\n\nthe other methods. The registered data from November 27, 1972 and\n\nFebruary 25, 1975 was subtracted and a bias of 128 added producing a four\n\nchannel delta data set. Figure 2.8-2 contains a gray scale image of the\n\ndelta data. Bright areas represent pixels which have increased in value\n\nand dark areas have decreased in value. Medium gray areas are a mix of\n\nno-change and small change conditions. The solar elevation angles were\n\nvery similar for the two dates (340 in November, 380 in February).\n\nThe analysis process used was to cluster the delta data to find\n\nseparable groups of points in the four dimensional delta image data.\n\nSeveral cluster runs were attempted and the thirteen cluster case\n\nappeared to give the best separability; thirteen was a reasonable number\n\nof change classes. Figure 2,8-3 contains the cluster map created by- the\n\nLARSYS *CLUSTER progtam. The mean and variance values for each cluster\n\nand the number of- points in each cluster are presented in Table 2.8-7\n\nSince the solar elevation angle was essentially the same for both dates\n\nit was expected that the no-change classes would be grouped around the\n\ndata value of 128.\nThis appeared to be the case for in Table 2.8-7 it can\nbe seen that cluster 9 with the largest number of points had mean values\n\nof from 122 to 127. Considering only channel 2 clusters 5 thru 9 have\n\nmeans from 131.5 thru 125.4 which is a strong indication that these are\n\nno-change clusters.\n\nThe next problem was to identify the meaning of each cluster in some\n\nquantitative manner. To do this a program was written which compares\n\ntwo classification files and counts the number of occurrences of classes\n\nin one file with respect to the other file. Also, an existing linear\n\nclassifier program was used to extend the cluster results from every\n\nother line and column to every line and column for the Port O\'Conner quad.\n\nThe direct change detection results file was then compared to the delta\n\nchange detection file and counts were computed for each of the twelve\n\ndirect change classes defined. The results of that count are presented\n\nin Table 2.8-8.. The table provides-a method of quantitatively evaluating\n\nthe delta classes and enables the clusters to be assigned to specific\n\nchange or no-change classes.\n\nThe majority of points in the quadrangle are no change or no change\n\nof interest cases and these were defined first. Clusters six, seven\n\nand eight have large counts in the woody to woody and water\'to water\n\nclasses and thus were assigned a land no-change class.. Clusters nine,\n\nten, eleven and thirteen have large counts in the water-to-water class\n\nand were assigned to a water no-change class. Next the change classes\n\nwere examined and clusters one and two clearly coincided with the\n\nelse-to-spoil direct change class. Clusters three, four and five were\n\nvery mixed; however, three had somewhat of a majority of points in else\n\n\nORIG&AL PAGO is\n\nUPOORTy\n\n2.8-20\n\n\nORIGINAL IN COLOR\n\nFigure\n\n2\n\n.8-2 .Gray Scale Image of the Delta Channels Obtained\n\n\nby Differencing February 25, 1975 and November 2,\n\n1972 LANDSAT Data for Port O\'Connor Quadrangle.\n\nGrassy Woody Areas Burned are Black, New Spoil\n\nAlong the Waterway is White.\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n\nOF POOR QUALIYM\n\n\n2.8-21\n\n\n4,\n\nI\nS.11\n\nIly\',\n\nI\n\nI l y\n..... ....\n\n\nIn\n\nRj\n\n;~\n\n11\n\n4.%\n\n:;!\n\n1%7\n\n1f\n\n:\n\n1......\n\nI71,.J*,z t,*hII\xc2\xb1\'1\n\n...... ....\n\n.1\n....\n\n... .. ... ..\n\nF~~gur~.\n2.-\n\nFigre2.83\n\na\nfth\nDelta.....\nClse\nUsin\nQuadrangle.....

Cluster four was badly mixed\n\nbut contained half of the else-to-urban points so was assigned that class.\n\nCluster five was mixed including woody-to-woody, else-to-submerged and\n\nelse-to-urban. This was assigned a mixed category. Finally, cluster\n\ntwelve was clearly related to the else-to-burn change and was assigned\n\nthus. In this manner an empirical change class assignment was made for\n\nthe delta cluster classification. Each class was assigned a symbol and\n\nthe delta classification file was printed out. Figure 2.8-4 contains\n\nthis printout; blank was used for all water to water classes.\n\nVisual inspection of Figure 2.8-4 shows that a good general agreement\n\nexists between the post classification change result and the delta\n\n\nresult in that no-change water land interfaces are relatively similar\n\nand the burn areas are in very close agreement. Pixels classified into\n\nthe mixture and urban change classes are very widely dispersed through\xc2\xad\n\nout the land and marsh area of the quadrangle. This may be related to\n\nthe inherent difficulty of reliably discriminating between certain urban\n\nand non urban classes with only the four bands of LANDSAT 2, i.e., it\n\nmay be the result of a limitation of LANDSAT rather than the change\n\ndetection method. A quantitative evaluation of performance was computed\n\nfrom Table 2.8-8 using the class groupings discussed above. Table 2.8-9\n\ncontains the grouped results. The agreement is seen to be in the 50 to\n\n60% range except that the no change classes do somewhat better.\n\nAlthough the quantitative agreement with post classification change\n\ndetection is only fair the delta method may have application as a rapid,\n\nsimple and low cost method of preliminary change detection. The image\n\nof the delta channels in Figure 2.8-2 reveals all the change that is in\n\nthe scene and proper interpretation could possibly allow the desired\n\nchange information to be extracted. The burn and spoil changes are clearly\n\nseen as very dark or bright areas. Construction changes can be picked\n\nout since they are usually single bright pixels.

The cost is clearly mostly for\n\nclustering and if several cluster runs are needed the cost would increase\n\nby around 3000 see. per run.\n\nSpectral/Temporal Change Classification\n\nThis change detectioh technique uses an aggregation of all spectral\n\nchannels from two dates to produce statistics from an eight channel\ncluster analysis to identify change. The approach used in this effort\n1) the areas clustered contained areas\nmade the following assumptions:\nthat are representative of sites where permanent change had occurred and\n2) permanent change can te separated from seasonal change utiljzing\nstatistics developed from the spectral data.\n\nIn the Pdrt O\'Connor quadrangle, five areas were selected for\n\nclustering. -These areas were chosen as representative samples of the\n\nmajor land -se -areas. Two areas were delineated in the agriculture\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2regionsone for :urban, one along the intercoastal waterway and one on\n\nthe barrier island. Each area contained 900 points (30 lines by 30\n\nSmaller areas were chosen for clustering so that the number\n\ncolumns).\nof classes derived from the cluster processor would be manageable. The\n\nnumber of spectral classes requested during clustering is imp6rtant in\n\ndetermining change classes. As a "rule of thumb," 2n (where n = the\n\ntotal number of expected cover types in both dates) was used in spe\'4fyifg\n\nthe number of cluster classes requested. Since approximately 5 cover\n\ntypes were expected for each date, a minimum of 20 cluster classes was\n\nestablished.-If the resulting cluster classes were found to have large\n\nvariances (i.e., variance in three or more channels greater than 3.00),\n\nthe areas were reclustered using 25 classes. Punched statistics\n\ncontaining the means and covariances for each of the cluster tlasses\n\nwere obtained as output.\n\nInitial clustering indicated that the potential number of training\n\nclasses possible from 5 sites would exceed the limitations of the soft\xc2\xad\nware system. Thus, only 3 of the 5 candidate areas were clustered in\n\nthe analysis of the Port O\'Connor quadrangle.\n\nThe three areas used for clustering were:\n\n1.\n\nLines 11-40, Columns 6-35.\n\n\n2.\n\nLines 63-92, Columns 94-123.\n\n\n3.\n\nLines 147-176, Columns 112-141.\n\n\nArea 1 is located in the northwest portion of the quadrangle and\n\ncontains mostly agriculture and rangelands. Area 2 is located in the\n\nvicinity of the town of Port O\'Connor. Area 3 is located in the upper\n\narea of the barrier island.\n\n\n2.8-28\n\n\nEach of these areas was clustered individually, with 20 cluster\n\nclasses requested. Eight channels, four from each date, were used and\n\nthe convergence level for clustering was set at 98 percent.\n\nPotential "change" classes were identified using one of three\n\ncriteria:\n\n\nV\n\n1.\n\nThe ratio (A = - ) of the mean values for each of the two\ndates differed \xc2\xa3Re than 0.30.\n\n2.\n\nThe magnitude (sum of relative spectral response for each\n\nof the four channels) for each of the two dates differed\n\nmore than 25.0.\n\n\n3.\n\nBoth the ratios and magnitudes varied greatly.\n\n\nTables 2.8-10 and 2.8-11 list the means and variances and the magni\xc2\xad\ntudes and ratios calculated for area 1, respectively. Six potential\n\n"change" classes were identified in area 1. These were cluster class\n\nnumbers 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 20 shown in Table 2.8-11.\n\nA similar procedure was followed for identifying potential tchange"\n\nclasses in areas 2 and 3. For area 3, however, it was necessary to\n\nrequest 25 cluster classes in order to reduce the variances to more\n\nacceptable levels. Two classes in area 3 still retained high variances,\n\nbut a request for more cluster classes resulted in some classes having\n\nfewer than 10 points in the class, a poor statistical representation.\n\nThe separability processor was used to determine what cluster\n\nclasses would be maintained. Separability was run on each of the areas\n\nindividually and the classes maintained, pooled or deleted as required.\n\nFor area 1, classes 4 and 5 were combined and class 7 deleted\n\nresulting in 18 classes. In area 2, classes 2 and 3; 8, 9 and 10; and\n\n11 and 16 were combined, respectively. Class 14 was deleted, resulting\n\nin 15 spectral classes. For area 3, only class 8 was deleted.\n\nThe statistics for each of the 3 areas were then merged into a\n\nsingle statistics deck, resulting in a statistics deck containing 57\n\nspectral classes. These statistics were input into the separability\n\nprocessor and the results used to select the final combination of\n\nclasses for classification and the best subset of 4 channels for classi\xc2\xad\nfication.\n\nBased on separability results class 25 (pooled classes 8, 9, and\n\n10 from area 2) was deleted since it overlapped 4 other classes. Class 5\n\n(6 from area 1) was combined with class 28 (class 13 from area 2).\nClass\n\n12 (14 from area 1) was combined with class 30 (class 17 from area 2).\n\nClasses 45 and 46 (13 and 14 from area 3) were also combined. The Port\n\nO\'Connor quadrangle was classified using 52 classes and channels 2, 3,\n\n\n44\n\n2.8-29\n\nTable 2,8-10 Means and Variances for Area I\n\nCLUSTER\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nPOINTS\n39\n65\n61\n50\n70\n37\n49\n55\n34\n19\n42\n26\n42\n26\n19\n44\n52\n54\n22\n94\n\nMEANS\nCH( 1) CH( 2) CH( 3) CH( 4) CH(1-3) CH(14) CH(15)\n23.1S 18.26\n28.79\n16.44\n19\'.05 ,.9.79\n32.44\n23.14\n.8.22 30.77- 16.85 18.40, 19.35 29.60\n21.67\n16.20 27.97\n15.95\n17.74\n18.11\n30.13\n22.26. 16.36\n29.06. \'16.52\n17.\'62\n18.50 27.RP\n23.27\n18.16\n28.01, 15.51\n17.96\n18.60\n27.23\n22.11\n16.89\n28.68\n16.41\n16.97\n15.00\n26.19\n21.71 16.22\n27.04, 14.90\n16.94 \'18.20 25.80\n21.78\n16.00 24.15- 12.44 17.91\n18.51\n28.38\n23.47 .18.21\n29.74 -16.50 17.56. 18.06 24.06\n22.16 16.95 25.26\n13.89 16.00\n14.79 24.84\n19.74\n14.45\n18.21\n8.60\n37.52\n17.83 27.02\n21.85 :16.27\n25.62\n13.31 17.00: 17.77 21 .6922.48 17.67\n29.31- 16.17\n15.57 15.40\n20.1021.46A\n16.00\n25.23\n14.08\n15.27- ]4.27\n20.65\n20.84 115.05 20.47\n9.68\n36.05\n15.74\n17.63\n20.07 114.50\n18.34\n.8.25 16.59\n15.98\n21.98\'\n22.04. 17.00\n26.10 -4.02\n14.15\n13.00\n15.63\n23.59\n19.19\n28.93\n.16.09 15.22\n14.76\n15.61\n19.95\n14.36 18.23 \'8.09\n13-18 12.50\n13.45\n22.88\n18.10 28.90 a6.27 13.77\n12.32 10.85\n\nCLUSTER VARIANCES\n\nCH( 1) CH( 2) CH( 3) CH( 4) CH(13) CH(14) CH(15)"C.H(16)\n\n1\n1.20\n2.14\n1.48\n0.52\n1.16\n1.27\n2.67\n0.81\n2\n.15 \' 1.55 -1.56\n0.51\n0.71\n0.73\n1.09\n0.56\n3\n1.59\n0.83\n3.23\n1.05\n1.26\n1.84\n0.98\n0.63\n4\n1.05\n0.93\n1.20\n0.74\n1.14\n0.46\n0.80\n0.53\n5\nOoti\n0.92\n1.20\n0.95\n1.06\n0.53\n0.90\n0.63\n6\n0.93\n1.10\n1.61\n0.69\n1.64\n0.33\n2.05\n1.70\n\n7\n0.75\n0.97\n1.92\n0.89\n1.02\n0.33\n0.o?\n0.50\n\nR\nI158\n1.19\n1.98\n1.58\n1.20\n1.44\n3.17\n0.96\n\n9\n1.23\n2.96. 2.63\n1.11\n0.80\n1.33\n2.54\n1.03\n10\n1.25\n1.72\n1.20\n1.65\n1.89\n0.18\n0.92\n0.92\n11\n1.42\n1.86\n7.88\n3.52\n1.33\n1.95\n2.27\n0.87\n\n12\n2.14\n1.16\n1.61\n1.50\n1.60\n0.34\n2-86\n1.06\n\n13\n1.23\n1.79\n1.88\n0.83\n2.25\n2.88\n2.14\n0.77\n\n14\n1.-4\n1.20\n2.18\n2.63\n1.96\n0.60\n1.R4\n0.91\n\n15\n0.70\n0083\n2.82\n2.12\n2.72\n3.09\n1.80\n0.47\n\n16\n1.23\n1.51\n5.25\n2.80\n1.50\n2.67\n2.07\n0.62\n\n17\nl.A5\n2.08\n2.36\n2.02\n1.90.\n1.22\n2.39\n1.52\n\n18\n1.42\n1.59\n2.18\n1.03\n2.48\n2.68\n1.26\n1.15\n\n19\n1.57\n1.39\n6.37\n3.71\n1.97\n2.36\nP.55\n3.30\n\n20\n1.33\n2.35\n2.80\n1.51\n1.67\n1.85\n2.24\n1.01\n\n\nCH(16)\n15.92\n15.40\n15.36\n\n-14.F0\n14.21\n13.57\n13.20\n14.45\n12.211\n22.58\n33.83\n31.54\n10.76\n\n10.8R\n,9.63\n1 1.07\n:7.88\n8.28\n6.59\n\n5.22\n\n\nZ.8-30,\n\nTable 2.8-11\n\nRatios and Magnitudes for Area I\n\n\nFEBRUARY 1975\n\n\nNOVEMBER 1972 \n\n\nCLUSTER\n\nMAGNITUDE\n\nRATIO \n\n\n4AGNITUDE\n\nRATIO\n\n\n1)\n\n86.67 \t\n\n.92\n\n87.2 \n\n\n.80\n\n\n2)\n\n88.98 \t\n\n.87 \n\n\n82.75\n\n.84\n\n\n3)\n\n81.79 \n\n\n.86\n\n81.3\n\n.79\n\n\n4)\n\n84.20 \n\n\n.85\n\n78.6\n\n.85\n\n\n5)\n\n84.95\n\n.95\n\n78.0\n\n.88\n\n\n6)\n\n84.09\n\n.86\n\n71.73\n\n.80\n\n\n7)\n\n79.87\n\n.90\n\n74.14\n\n.90\n\n\n8)\n\n74.37\n\n1.03\n\n79.25\n\n.85\n\n\n9)\n\n87.92 \n\n\n.90\n\n71.92\n\n.98\n\n\n10)\n\n78.26\n\n1.00\n\n68.21 \n\n\n.82\n\n\n11)\n\n61.0\n\n1.28\n\n76.2\n\n.87\n\n\n12)\n\n77.05\n\n.98\n\n68.0\n\n1.05\n\n\n13)\n\n85.63\n\n.88\n\n61.8\n\n1.00\n\n\n14)\n\n76.77\n\n.95 \n\n\n61.07\n\n15)\n\n66.04\n\n1.19\n\n59.05\n\n16)\n\n61.16\n\n1.30\n\n65.62\n\n17)\n\n79.16\n\n.97\n\n50.66\n\n1.15\n\n\n18)\n\n87.8\n\n.95\n\n53.87\n\n1.25\n\n\n19)\n\n60.63\n\n1.30\n\n45.72\n\n1.28\n\n\n20)\n\n86.15\n\n.91\n\n42.16\n\n1.62\n\n\n.94\n\n1.17\n\n.99\n\n\n2.8-31\n\n\n14, 15 (bands 5 and 6 for each November 1972 and February 1975).\n\nResults of this classification are shown in Figure 2.8-5.

It is\n\nseen that the vegetation-to-soil and soil-to-vegetation groups in\n\nTable 2.8-13 fall into the woody-to-woody class and the water-to-soil\n\ngroup falls in the submerged-submerged, else-submerged and water-to-water\n\nclasses.

It is charac\xc2\xad\nterized by the fact that an unknown sample can be classified into a\n\nclass using one or more decision functions in a successive manner. This\n\nclassification strategy can be most easily illustrated by a tree diagram\n\n(Figure 2.8-6). A tree generally consists of a root node, a number of\n\nnonterminal nodes or decision stages (layers) and terminal nodes. The\n\nterminal node corresponds to a terminal decision, i.e. the decision\xc2\xad\nmaking procedure terminates, the unknown sample being assigned to the\n\nclass at that node. However, a nonterminal node is\'an intermtdiate\n\ndecision, its immediate descendent nodes representing the\'possible\n\noutcomes of that decision.\n\nTo specify a decision tree uniquely two sets of information are\n\nnecessary; one set tells how the terminal and nonterminal nodes are\n\nlinked while.th, other specifies the decision functions of all the\n\nnonterminal nodes. The decision tree can be constructed manually-or\n\nby an optimized logic tree design procedure.\n\nFor the purpose of change detection a hybrid of these two pro\xc2\xad\ncedures was utilized. Decision trees for each of the two dates were,\n\nobtained automatically and then manually linked together (with some\n\nmodifications), thus introducing within the tree a logic for detecting\n\nthe desired changes.\n\nThe flowchart in Figure 2.8-7 illustrates the basic procedure for\n\nthe layered classifier using the optimized logic tree design processor.\n\nThe *DISTANCE processor computes the interclass separability (trans\xc2\xad\nformed divergence OR the transformed Bhattacharya dis.tance) for sel\xc2\xad\nected feature subsets using the statistics as input. All 15 feature\n\nsubsets of the four channels were used in this case.\n\nThe distances were then fed into the *DESIGN processor which uses\n\nthe "guided search and forward pruning" method 5 and a decision tree\n\ntI (Figure 2.8-8) was obtained for the November 1972 date.\n\nThe February 1975 statistics were split into two decks using the\n\n*NERGESTATISTICS processor; one deck contained the burn, urban and\n\nvegetation classes and the other water, spoil, confusion and inundated\n\nclasses. Since changes being investigated occurred only within these\n\ntwo groups of classes, this would cut down on unnecessary nodes in\n\nthe tree.-\n\nThe same procedure was used to obtain decision trees t2al t2b for\n\nthese two decks. The two trees are illustrated in Figure 2.8-9.

The new tree thus\n\nconstructed manually was now set up to classify the unknown sample into\n\nan informational class (e.g. water) using date 1 (November 1972)\n\nstatistics and then continue on to see whether that pixel changed to\n\nanother class (e.g. whether it changed to spoil or submerged grass/\n\ntidal flats) or remained the same based on date 2 (February 1975)\n\nstatistics.\n\nThe changes investigated by the tree are listed in Table 2.8-15.\n\nA special fortran program (MOVSTAT)* was used to make the two\n\nstatistics decks (11/72 and 2/75) compatible for the *MERGESTATISTICS\n\nprocessor, which was then utilized to obtain the eight channel statis\xc2\xad\ntics deck required for classification. The experimental *XLAYER\n\nclassifier was used for classification.\n\nThe first classification attempt was unsuccessful as the tree was\n\ntoo large (1221 nodes) to store in the core. In an effort to reduce\n\nthe size of the tree the various subclasses in the terminal nodes of\n\ntree t, were grouped at each stage into their major informational class.\n\n(These groupings are illustrated in Figure 2.8-8 by the dotted lines.)\n\nIn some cases if the descending terminal nodes of an intermediate\n\ndecision node contained only the subclasses of one inforiational class,\n\nall those terminal nodes were deleted. This was justified by the fact\n\nthat only changes of the major informational classes were being investi\xc2\xad\ngated and the decision to classify the unknown sample in that major\n\ncover type had already been reached at the intermediate node. After\n\ntrees t2a , \n\nt2b had been trimmed in a similar manner, they were relinked\n\nto tI to form the new "change decision tree." By this time the number\n\nof nodes had been reduced to approximately 700 nodes. The data over Port\n\nO\'Connor were classified using the 8 channel statistics and the change\n\ntrees. The classification results are shown in Figure 2.8-10.\n\n\n*Practical difficulties arise in LARSYS when statistics from different\n\ndates and locations are to be merged to a physical deck. These diffi\xc2\xad\nculties were circumvented by using MOVSTAT which (a) increases the\n\nnumber of spaces for means and covariances to the number necessary for\n\na prespecified number of features; (b) moves the values for means and\n\ncovariances for date 2 into the correct places in a matrix representing\n\ndouble as many features and (c) adds a set of prespecified constants to\n\nthe class means.\n\n\nQtr\n\nZ\n\n44;/,A\n\n2.8-42\n\n\nTable 2.8-15.\n\nChanges investigated by Decision Tree.\n\n\nClass in Date I \n\n\nExpected change class (Es)\n\nin Date 2\n\n\n1.\n\nWater \n\n\nSpoil, submerged grass/tidal\n\nflats, water\n\n\n2.\n\nSpoil \n\n\nWater, submerged grass/tidal\n\nflats, spoil\n\n\n3.\n\nSubmerged grass/tidal flats \n\n\nSpoil, water, submerged grass/\n\ntidal flats\n\n\n4.\n\nWoody/herbaceous \n\n\nBurn, urban, woody/herb.\n\n\n5.\n\nUrban \n\n\nBurn, woody/herb., urban\n\n\nG\nMtI\n\nIL.\nchEM~S\n\no\nkF~tQ\n\nl\n\n~\n\n4JES~V~7 ~\n\n~\n\nM\n\nIE\n\nMt\n\n6\n\n~-~\n\nwrw\nII\n\n\'aEll\n\niii\n\n0IIIE\n\nL.~\n\nIpt\n\n1\'LLx\n\nN;-\n\n-\n\nI\n\nM.\nIi 111\nI\n\n1\n\nrghr V\n41m1w\n\nIL,\nHL.\n\nIL-f\n\nILL\n\nIT\n\'\n-\n\n--\n\nA\n\nI\n\nt\n--\n\n-.\n\n;..\n0\nl\n\n*. \n\n.0* \t\n\n*\n\n....\n\n5\n\nl.....\n.\n\nI\t\n\n05(\n\n0.20\n\n10020\n\n*\n\n..\n.\n\n0\n\n.......\n..\n.\n\n.0;00\n\n\n:\n\n.\n\nI\' \t\n\njf\n\no\n\n0..\n5... .\n\nl\n\n01\n\nlii~~\n~\n\nI\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI\n\n....................\n\n....\n\nl,\n\n.........-\n\nS\xc2\xb0 ................... \t\n.....\n.\n0\n\n0N\n2.00Sp.............\n\n.....\ntr\n0 \t\n\n... ..\n\n.......\n\n..\n..\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n::. .\n\n..\n\n111 \t\n........\n\n.\n\n...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n...\n\n.... ..\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.N\n....\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n.\n\n.\n\nI ~\n\n..\n\n\n.\n.\n\n3~\n\n...........\n....\n.......\n....... \t\n\nk\n\ntF I "\n\n,\n\nI..\n\n.\n\nig\n\nU.\n\nIT\n\nt" I\nITTl\n\nI\n\n.\n\nII\n\nMll.\n\n.......\nW\n\n,,\nt\n\n......\n\n0\n\n*2\n\n\nIT " 111\n-a2IU~Thuo\n\ni\n\n\nIJIitO\n\n,\n\n\nI\n\nI\n\n:!\n\n11.\n\n::\n\nIl\'M\nIo\n\nI\t\n[:1\n\n-Y\n\nIT\n\nI\n\n\'IsIF\n\n-UU\n\n10110 0 \n\n\n0\n\n\'\n\n~\n\nITT~i11~i\n\nII\n\nII\n\n\n4soouI, \t\n11\n\n0011110111 \t\n\n0\n\n11\n\n1111101.\nII\n\n\n0000... 011I \t\n\nI\n\nI3~lllI~1, T\n\n103.11~\n\ni\t\n\n1\n\nFIT1\n110\n\nII~~\n\n\' s;\n\nfl\n\n113:~\n\n\'\n\nIll\n\n]!fill11\n1 \t 111.1\n\n000\n\no\n\nFIT 00 I01001I001l0000\n111.0\n\n\nI\n\n!\n\ni.\n\n0....\n\nl\n\n00v \t\n\n.0000ltI\n\n0\t\n\nT1.1I \t 0000\n\n.i\n\nO0O*0..OUuyrIOII\n\n\n100*\n00010.N.:Il\n\n0 \t\n\n.......... ..\n\nNTR\n\n1\n\n]\n\ni\n\n:.\n\n,illnn\n\n1 ::ll:::\n\n.. ..\nIF.

The burn areas (B) and the\n\nno change land water interfaces are very similar. The urban areas (U)\n\nare well identified; but there is some misclassification of the dredged\n\nspoil banks along the intracoastal waterway as urban areas due to the\n\nsimilarities in the high spectral response of both the classes. (This\n\nproblem can be eliminated to some extent by using weights in the classi\xc2\xad\nfier and in the tree design processor. However, as yet the weights\n\noption has not been programmed into the *XLAYER classifier.) Some small\n\nponds with some submerged vegetation are also misclassified as burn\n\nareas because of the spectral similarities of the two classes (both\n\nreflect low in the IR).\n\nA quantitative comparison of the Decision tree results and the\n\nPost Classification Change results, Table 2.8-16, shows that on a per\n\npoint basis the two are in agreement, 89% overall, and 77% by class.\n\nSome of the misclassification can be attributed to the trimming of the\n\ndecision trees (which was necessary to accommodate the tree in computer\n\nmemory). In the case of trees t 2 and t2b, when the terminal nodes\n\nwere deleted, the immediate ascenaing nodes then became terminal nodes.\n\nBy definition terminal nodes contain only one class, so all but one of\n\nthe classes (belonging to the same informational group) were dropped\n\nfrom those nodes. As a result, 5 of the 11 classes of woody/herbaceous\n\nand 2 of the 5 classes of water were not used in classification (they\n\nwere deleted from the tree structure) causing some of the misclassifi\xc2\xad\ncation, especially that of the small ponds, as burn areas.\n\nTable 2.8-17 gives the figures for the CPU time involved in\n\nDecision Tree Approach.\n\n\n?%\nQ\n\n4\n\no 0\n\nPerformance of the Layered Classifier Approach as Compared to the Post-Classification\n\nComparison Results.\n\n\nTable 2.8-16\n\nd\n\nLayered Classifier Classes\n\nW\xc2\xb0d~uba\nCls os\nDirect Change\nWoody Urban\nClasses\nGrouped\n\nUrban)\n\nW\xc2\xb0dwodyW\xc2\xb0dBurn\nWWodd\n\nd \n\nUrban\nUrban)\n\nSpoil Water\nWater\nSubm)\n\npo\n\npol\nWate\nSpoiSpoil \nSpoiWdSubmg \nSpoil Confusion\n\nWat\nWatel\'\n\nwater.1\n\nSubmg)\n\nSubmg \n\nPubmg) \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n229\n\n4\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n10 \n\n\n243\n\n\n0\n\n10326\n\n13 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n4 \n\n\n27 \n\n\n10370\n\n\n3. spoil-spoil\n\n+ else - spoil\n\n245\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n222 \n\n\n3 \n\n\n12 \n\n\n482\n\n\n4. water-water\n\n+ else - water\n\n0\n\n13\n\n4 \n\n\n16855 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n70 \n\n\n76 \n\n\n17018\n\n\n89\n\n1520\n\n178 \n\n\n4 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n2740 \n\n\n0\n\n21\n\n1496 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n1 \n\n\n14 \n\n\n1532\n\n\n181\n\n1076\n\n83 \n\n\n35 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n101 \n\n\n1110 \n\n\n2586\n\n\n97.65% \n\n\n99% \n\n\n1. urban-urban\n+ else - urban\n\n\n2. woody-woody\n\n+ else - woody\n\n5. submerged \xc2\xad\nsubmerged +\n\nelse - submerged\n6. else-burn\n7. all other\n\nchange & con\xc2\xad\nfusion class\nPercent correct\n\n94%\n\n99.57%\n\nTotal NO. of Points 36764\n\nOverall Percent Correct - 89.7%\n\nBy Class - 77%\n\n\n46.1% \n\n\n60% \n\n\n2 \n\n\n42.9%\n\n\n4533\n\n\n2.8-46\n\n\nTable 2.8-17.\n\nCPU time usage for the decision tree approach.\n\n\nProcessor Used\n\nTime (Sec.

The four\'methods investigated are:\n\ndelta change detection, post-classification comparison, spectral/temporal\n\nchange classification, and layered spectral/temporal change classification.\n\nSince adequate reference data for a thorough evaluation was not\n\navailable, the post-classification comparison change detection results\n\nwere used as the standard for evaluating the results from the other three\n\nprocedures. This choice was based on the assumption before tests were\n\nrun that this method would provide good results and this assumption was\n\nlater verified as correct.\n\nIn change detection analysis, three kinds of errors can arise: error\n\nat time one, error at time two, and error at both times. To .precisely\n\nevaluate the results of various change detection procedures, adequate\n\nground information must be available to identify any error condition. In\nthe absence of such information, accuracy can be,estimated as follows:\n\nIf P and P2 are-the overall probabilities of correct classification\n\nat times tl and t2 , if the classifications at different times -are indepen\xc2\xad\n1\ndent, and the classes are equally likely, then the change detection\n\naccuracy is at least Pc = PIP 2. This expression is a conservative\n\n,estimate of the accuracy because it counts a no-change situation classi\xc2\xad\nfied as no-change as correct only when -he class is also correctly identified.\n\nNote that for example, if P 1 = P 2 = .9 then Pc = .81, i.e., at least\n\n\ndn 81% correct change classification is achieved if the two spectral\n\nclassifications are 90% correct. Also note that Pc < Pi and p2; thus\n\nthe evaluation of a change detection algorithm must be based not only on\n\n,C but P1 and P2 as well.\n\nIn devising a change detection procedure one properpy to consider\n\nis the relative complexity of the method; all other things being ,equal,\n\na simpler approach would be more desirable for implementation reasons.\n\nOn the other hand more complex methods may have more performance potential\n\nin the long run. On a scale of increasing complexity the four methods\n\narrange themselves as follows:\n\n1. \t\nDelta method. This method requires only a simple subtraction\n\nfollowed by a single classification.\n\n2. \t\nPost classification comparison. This method requires two separate\n\nclassifications followed by a logical comparison.\n\n3. \t\nSpectral/Temporal classification. While this method requires\n\nonly a single classification, it is a vastly more complex one,:\n\nrequiring more classesand probably more features.\n\n4. \t\nLayered Spectral/Temporal classification. This method involves\n\nnot only a complex classification but also a priori knowledge of\n\nthe logical interrelationship of the classes as well.\n\n\n2.8-48\n\n\nDuring this year, programming for all four of these approaches\n\nwas implemented and all procedures were executed once on the same data\n\nset. The results to this point suggest the following conclusions:\n\n-\n\nThe delta method may be too simple to adequately deal with all the\nfactors involved in change detection in a natural scene. It may\nbe that too much information is discarded from the data in the\nsubtraction process whereby only the four band difference data\nremains from the two sets of original four bands. Images created\nfrom the delta data may be quite useful, however, in qualitatively\nassessing change by image interpretation.\n\n-\n\nThe best results were obtained in this test using the post classifi\xc2\xad\ncation comparison method. This is due in part to the fact that\nthe training procedures required are already routine and quite\nwell understood.\n\n-\n\nThe latter two methods cannot be ruled out at this point as having\ngreat ultimate potential. The layered spectral/temporal change\nin particular showed best agreement with the post classification\ncomparison results. More complex methods usually require more\ncarefully drawn data inputs together with greater user understanding\nto achieve their potential.\n\nIn summary this effort has provided a good start on the development\n\nof practical change detection methods for the Regional Applications Program.\n\nHowever, because of limitations previously pointed out, conclusions must\n\nstill be considered tentative.\n\n\n2.8-49\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nNASA, Lyndon B.

Two LARS personnel were assigned to\n\nprovide the necessary interface with the EDC terminal users. These\n\nwere Susan Schwingendorf in the area of system support and Barb Davis\n\nas analysis techniques specialist. Administrative support was provided\n\nby Terry Phillips. By December, 1975, it became apparent that the\n\nrequested funds would be expended shortly, and a proposal requesting\n\nfunds for additional computer services was written. As the year closed,\n\nfurther funds were required to allow completion of EDC\'s projects for\n\nthe year.\n\nNo major problems were reported in operating the terminal. Con\xc2\xad\ntinued use of the terminal over the nine month contract period was\n\nevidenced by the monthly CPU usage, averaging 5.5 CPU hours a month\n\nwith a high of 15.6 CPU hours in December. Active use was also made\n\nof LARS reformatting services, with 20 LANDSAT frames reformatted, 10\n\nareas geometrically corrected, and 4 image registrations performed.\n\nIn addition to the above computer facility services, LARS also\n\nprovided a one week training exercise to two EDC personnel - Michelle\n\nEngel and Dale Gehring. Under the direction of Barb Davis, they proceed\xc2\xad\ned through an entire analysis sequence on a LANDSAT data set and learned\n\nhow to access and use the experimental programs available on LARS\'\n\nsystem. These are programs developed in conjunction with various\n\nresearch efforts in the laboratory which have not yet been made part of\n\nthe LARSYS-system.\n\nThe EDC terminal is expected to remain in operation through the\n\nfirst half of FY77. EDC has indicated they will be discohatinuing tse\n\nof the LARS terminal as they increase use of their in-house systems.\n\n\n~9jQ11Z7\n\ncm\n\n\n'
