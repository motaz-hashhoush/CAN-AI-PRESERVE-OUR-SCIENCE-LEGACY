In the design and analysis phases of this and other engines, the company makes extensive use of COSMIC's NASTRAN computer program. NASTRAN serves as an analytical tool for design of many engine components, such as those glowing in the test stand photo. Teledyne CAE also uses two other COSMIC programs in studies of engine airflow. Use of the three computer programs affords significant annual savings.", "title": "Engine Design", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019741, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019741, "id": "0221c9f492494fc5b47106891dc71814", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019741.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019741/downloads/20070019741.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019741/downloads/20070019741.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019741/downloads/20070019741.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
