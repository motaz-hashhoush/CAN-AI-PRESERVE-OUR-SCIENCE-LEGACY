Identify the Cover Page of the procedure with "THIS DOCUMENT\nCONTAINS HAZARDOUS OPERATIONS."\n2. Submit the signature page to the procedure (original, if possible) with a\nsignature block for NASA Safety to sign. Hazardous procedures must be\napproved by NASA Safety "by signature" prior to use.\na. Shelf Life - the required number of days that the procedure must be\napproved prior to its use date.\n(1) Basic/I" Issue - minimum often days\n(2) Revision - minimum number of seven days\nPage Changes - minimum number of three days\n(3)\nThis means that the procedures should arrive to our office for review in ample\ntime to meet these requirements. For basic/new procedures, a minimum of\ntwenty days before its scheduled use would be a good guideline.\n3. In the beginning of the document, include an objective/introduction statement\nwhich gives a brief description of the operations, specific hazard(s) that is\ninvolved and the location where the operations will be held.\n4. Perform a safety walk down of the operational area.\n5. Provide a list of essential personnel that will be allowed in the control area by\ndescription of their occupation and number of personnel (i.e. JAXA Safety -.1,\nNASA Safety\xe2\x80\x94 1, etc)\n6. Prior to the start of hazardous operations, add (in large block letters)\nWARNING\nTHE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE HAZARDOUS DUE TO (identify the\nhazard)\n\nGENERAL GUIDELINES FOR HAZARDOUS PROCEDURES\n7. Add a statement "Establish a control area of (specify the control area, i.e. 25\'\nradius of the center of the crane) and clear the control area of all nonessential\npersonnel".\n8. Conduct a pretask briefing and verify all personnel are certified (if applicable),\nequipped and ready to support the operation and verify safety walkdown has\nbeen completed.\n9. Add a step in the procedure "Obtain NASA Safety concurrence to proceed\nwith hazardous operations" and obtain NASA Safety signature on that step.\n10. At the completion of the hazardous operations, add (in large block letters)\nNOTE\r\nHAZARDOUS OPERATIONS ARE COMPLETE\n11. Upon completion of hazardous operations, add a step in the procedure "Obtain\nSafety concurrence to open the controlled area" and obtain NASA Safety\nand JAXA signatures on the step.\n12. If the document initiates, activates or starts up any equipment by steps within\nthe procedure, emergency instructions must be listed in the procedure as\n"Appendix Z - Emergency Instructions" to safety shut down the equipment\nimmediately.\n13. If a SLOAA is required for the procedure/operation to be performed, the\nform needs to be submitted for coordination/approval prior to the procedure\nreview as the SLOAA needs to be indicated within the procedure. (No\npersonnel are allowed to be under a suspended load/crane hook with a load at\nany time. However, if as a very last resort, if an operation/task cannot be\ncompleted without personnel being under a load, a SLOAA (Suspended Load\nOperation Analysis/Approval) form may be submitted for consideration.\n\nGENERAL GUIDELINES FOR HAZARDOUS PROCEDURES\n14. If the procedure calls out another procedure to perform the "hazardous\noperations", the initial procedure (controlling document) will be considered\nhazardous. The sequence calling out the secondary procedure (subtask\ndocument) will be treated equally as a hazardous operations in the\ndocument/procedure, and will be written as such.\n15. Nonhazardous procedures are not required to be submitted for approval,\nhowever, must be available for audit.\n\n'
