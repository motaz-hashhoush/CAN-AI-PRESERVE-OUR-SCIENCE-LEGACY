A user\noperates a hand held interrogation and display (IAD) module\nthat communicates with, or is part of, the base station, to\nprovide an initial inquiry. Information on location(s) of the\ntarget inventory item is also indicated visibly and/or audibly\non the receptacle(s) for the user. Status information includes\nan assessment of operation readiness and a time, if known,\nthat the specified inventory item or class was last removed or\nexamined or modified. Presentation of a user access level may\nbe required for access to the target inventory item. Another\nembodiment provides inventory information for a stack as a\nsight-impaired or hearing-impaired person passes adjacent to\nthat stack.\n9 Claims, 5 Drawing Sheets\n\n10\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nApr. 14, 2009\t\n\nSheet 1 of 5\t\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n\n//-10\n\n16\n\nFIG. 1\n\n\t\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nApr. 14, 2009\t\n\nSheet 2 of 5\n\n\t\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n\n17-1\n17-2\n\nA\t\n\nB\nC\t\n\n17 -m\n\n,y\t\n17-4\t\n\nA\n\n000000000000\n\nD\t\n\n*Shelves incorporated with a RFid\ntransponder system (N antenna\'s)\n\n*BaseStation is the termiAation\npoint for each shelving system\n\n14-1\t\n\ni\n\n14-2\t\n\n1,14-\n\nRFid RFid t\ntag\t\ntag ta\n\n14-4\t\n\n14-5\t\n\nRFid l (RFid) CRF\ntag y\t\ntag\t\nto\n\nN-Channel WX\nRFID Base Station\nXscr Pwr\n\nFIG. 2\n\n14 -N\n\n14-6\n\n_____(RFid\ntag\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nApr. 14, 2009\t\n\nSheet 3 of 5\n\n\t\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n\nSystem receives from a user request for specified\ninformation on specified inventory item\t\n\n31\n\nd\n\n32\nNo\t\n\nIs\n\nYes\nspecified\t\ninventor item\n\n37\t\n\nNotify user that\t\nspecified inventory\t\nitem is not present\t\n\n33\n\nNo\t\n\nIs\t\nspecified info.\navailable for\n\nYes\n\n34\n\nNotify user that specified\ninventory item is present\n(optional), that specified\nstatus information is not\navailable\n38\t\n\nCollect all relevant available\nlocation and status information\nfor this item and transmit this info\nto the user\n\n35\n\nso Cause an RFID tag at each\nlocation of specified inventory\nitem to issue at least one of a\nvisually perceptible signal and an\naudibly perceptible signal (optional)\n36\nTerminate RED signal when a\nspecified event occurs (optional)\n\nFIG. 3\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nApr. 14, 2009\t\n\nSheet 4 of 5\t\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n\n44\n\nv\n\nFIG. 4\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nApr. 14, 2009\t\n\nSheet 5 of 5\t\n\nUS 7 ,516,890 B1\n\n,,-51\nSense-impaired user passes adjacent to a stack while\npresenting an IIC, while presenting (holding) an IIC\n\nIF\t\n\n52\n\nAdjacent stack or central transceiver transmits an\nindicator signal that is received by the User\'s IIC\n\nIF\n\n53\n\nIIC reflects a modified version of incident signal\n\nAdjacent stack or central transceiver receives modified^54\nsignal\n\nAdjacent stack or central transceiver estimates distance \t\nd between user and adjacent stack\n\n55\n\n---56\n\nAdjacent stack transmits at least one of audible signal\nAPS and visible signal VPS, announcing information on\nclass(es) of information on inventory items in stock\n\nFIG. 5\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n1\nINTERACTIVE INVENTORY MONITORING\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\nThis invention was made, in part, by one or more employees of the U.S. government. The U.S. government has the\nright to make, use and/or sell the invention described herein\nwithout payment of compensation, including but not limited\nto payment of royalties.\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThis invention related to interactive determination of location and/or status of a selected inventory item among an array\nof inventory items, for example, a book or document or equipment item or component.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nKeeping track of inventory, whether books or documents or\nelectronic copies or goods or sensitive material, is a continual\ntask. Determining where an inventory item is presently\nlocated, or mislocated, is increasingly time consuming as the\ninventory grows and items are repaired, maintained, replaced,\nor moved and recharacterized. Inclusion of a paper slip noting\nthe "history" of the item is only acceptable if the item users\nare diligent about supplementing this history with an account\nof recent activities involving the item and/or the present status\nof the item. Where multiple copies of an inventory item are\npresent and are kept in different locations, the tasks become\ncorrespondingly multiplied.\nWhat is needed is a system that (1) indicates whether a\nselected item or category of items is present in the collection;\nand, if present, identifies the locations) of the item(s) using a\nvisually perceptible and/or audibly perceptible signal; and (2)\nthe present condition or status, if known, of the item(s). Preferably, the system shouldbe flexible and shouldpermit implementation of one or more redefined categories for subsequent\nsearches.\n\n2\nRemoval of the item from the receptacle may first require\nentry of specified information, including but not limited to\nuser name, user contact information, user priority level (if\nrelevant), date the item was removed, and user authentication\n5 information. An associated light emitting diode (LED) array\ncontaining different colored LED light sources is optionally\nincluded for visual indication of locations) of the item.\nA desired item is specified and/or categorized using a database system with a computer interface. The interface may be\nio a portable wireless electronic unit that communicates withthe\ndatabase and with the item(s) sought. When queried, the\ninterface downloads information on the item from the database and from the shelving/vessel (e.g., availability and/or\npresent location and/or present status of the item). Based\n15 upon a color code scheme assigned to the particular handheld\nunit, the shelving/vessel LED array displays the corresponding distinguishable color scheme wherever the item(s) is\nlocated.\nThis system can also provide security for an inventory of\n20 weapon systems, weapons components, and biological/mechanical warfare substances or other sensitive items that\nrequire extreme protection. In this instance, the inventory\nreceptacle is powered continuously, and each protected item\nemits a unique encrypted code associated with the item, when\n25 the item is on or in or adjacent to the receptacle at its assigned\nlocation. When the protected item is not on or adjacent to the\nreceptacle at its assigned location, or is located elsewhere on\nor adjacent to the receptacle, an alarm or notification signal is\nissued by the system, indicating when the item was last\n30 sensed at its assigned location. Use of an encrypted code of\nappropriate complexity can minimize or eliminate the possibility of "spoofing" to cover absence of the protected item.\nEntry of an encrypted password allowing access to the protected. item could be used to avoid prompt issuance of an\n35 alarm signal.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n40\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThese needs are met by the invention, which provides an\ninteractive system and associated method for querying the\narray and for determining at least one of (i) location of a\nselected inventory item and (ii) present status of the inventory\nitem.\nThe invention is an RFD-based system that, in one embodiment, assists a user in locating an item visually, in response to\nspecification of the item electronically. The item(s) being\nsought may be a book on a library shelf, an item from a store\ninventory, a legal or financial document, a medical record, a\nweapon system or weapon component (presumably) located\nin an armory, or similar item. Each such item is tagged by a\nradio frequency identity detector (RFID), which does not\nrequire a battery but is preferably powered using an electromagnetic coil that is embedded in or associated with the item.\nThe shelving or other containment vessel or receptacle for the\nitem(s) provides an alternating electromagnetic field to power\nthe embedded coils and can identify the item location if the\nitem is on or adjacent to the shelving/vessel, even if the item\nis not at its assigned location. Each coil includes a low power,\nprogrammable chip containing relevant information on the\nitem (id. no., class to which item belongs, present status of the\nitem, relevant item characteristics, recent activity affecting\nthe item, etc.)\n\n45\t\n\n50\t\n\nFIG. 1 schematically illustrates use of an RFID interrogafor and display to locate an inventory item or class of such\nitems.\nFIG. 2 schematically illustrates operation of a base station\nRFID with an embedded multiplexer driving a plurality of\nRFID transponders and their associated antennas.\nFIG. 3 is a flow chart of a procedure for practicing the\ninvention.\nFIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment of the invention, and\nFIG. 5 is a flow chart for practicing this embodiment.\nDESCRIPTION OF BEST MODES OF THE\nINVENTION\n\nFIG. 1 schematically illustrates use of an RFID interrogator and display system 10 to locate an inventory item 11 -n\n(n1, ... , N; N?2) or class of such items. In this illustration,\n55 the inventory item is a book or document, but the invention\napplies to more general inventory items as well. A user (not\nshown) carries a hand held radio frequency identity detector\n("RFID") interrogation and display ("IAD") system 13. The\nuser enters an indicium, identifying or characterizing the\n60 inventory item, into the IAD system 13 and transmits an\ninterrogation signal IS to a collection of inventory items 11 -n\nor to a server representing the collection, preferably using a\nwireless interrogation signal IS. Where access to the inventory item is restricted, the user is also required to provide one\n65 or more of a biometric indicium, or an authentication code or\nsuitable physical indicium permitting access to and/or physical possession of the item.\n\n\t\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n4\n\n\t\n\tThe presence of each inventory item that is "in stock,"\nto automatically transmit selected information at a sequence\n\t\nwhether properly located or located elsewhere in the inven- \t\nof specified times, or upon demand.\ntory collection, is sensed by a first electromagnetic coil and\nOne version of an RFID operates at about 433 MHz, but\nassociated responder circuitry 15-n that is attached to orasso-\t\nthis frequency can be varied somewhat to provide distinguishciated with each inventory item 11 -n.

In\t\nAn example of a presently available RFID base station is\nsome embodiments disclosed here, an RFID is programmed\nthe Texas Instruments LF Base Station IC TMS3705ADR,\n\nUS 7,516,890 B1\n\n5\nwhich communicates with resonance frequencies in a range\n129-140 kHz. Synchronous and asynchronous data transmission are supported, using a phase locked loop clock generation of 16 MHz. The operation voltage is 4.5-5 Volts, and the\ndevice operates at temperatures in a range \xe2\x80\x9440\xc2\xb0 C.^T^85\xc2\xb0 5\nC., with charging range current and sleep mode current of 8\nmAmp and 15 \xc2\xb5Amp, respectively. Minimum recovery time\nor dead time between responses to the same or different\nRFIDs is estimated as a few tens of msec. Pin count is 16, and\n10\nthe package size is 10 mm by 6 mm.\t\nOptionally, the RFID tag senses and transmits one or more\nof the following information ("status information") concerning an adjacent inventory item: (1) an indicium identifying or\ncharacterizing the item (e.g., a title and call number and copy\nnumber for a book or document, or an appliance number and 15\ncopy number for an appliance or device); (2) an indication of\nwhen the item was last returned to or placed in/on the receptacle 17-m; (3) an indication of the present condition or status\n(e.g., use-ready, inactivated for maintenance, permanently\ninactivated, or withdrawn from use) of the item; (4) number of 20\nsimilar or identical inventory items present in the collection\nof all reporting receptacles; (5) location of other similar or\nidentical items; and/or (6) how often the item has been\nremoved or queried.\nWhen the IAD system 13 in FIG.1 requests information on 25\nlocation of a specified inventory item, an RFID tag 14-n on\neach receptacle 17-m for which the specified item is present\noptionally provides a visually perceptible signal (e.g., a light\nhaving a corresponding color, color combination, blink frequency, texture or other visual indicator signal) or an audibly 30\nperceptible signal (e.g., a sound having a corresponding\naudible frequency, combination of frequencies, sound intensity pattern, chirp or other audible indicator signal) at each\nlocation of the item, whether the item is correctly shelved or\nincorrectly shelved; the location of each such item is option- 35\nally indicated on the user\'s IAD system The user can then go\nto one or more of the indicated locations and retrieve the\ndesired item.\nIn one embodiment, the IAD system 13 communicates\nwith a base station or server 21 that, in turn, sequentially 40\ncommunicates with each RFID 14-n on each inventory receptacle 17-m (e.g., a shelf), preferably through a signal multiplexing system. For example, each receptacle 17-m may periodically transmit status information for each inventory item\non that receptacle to the base station 21, for example, once 45\nevery K seconds (e.g., K=5-120). The received status information is temporarily stored at the base station 21 in N\nmemory positions (one for each reporting RFID tag on the\nshelf), these N memory positions are overwritten in the same\norder when a new sequence of status information items is 50\nreceived for the (same) shelf 17-m. Each receptacle shelf\n17-m (m=1, ... , M) has a separate set of status. information\nitem memory positions for receiving and temporarily storing\nthe status information for items on that receptacle. Alternatively, if the cycling through all the receptacles is sufficiently 55\nrapid (e.g., once every 1-10 sec), the status information for\ninventory items on a first receptacle can be partly or wholly\noverwritten by status information for inventory items on a\n\n6\netc.) for a specified inventory item. The system queries a base\nstation to determine (i) whether at least one copy of the\nspecified item is present at any location (step 32) and (ii), if\nthe specified item is present, whether the specified status\ninformation is available for this item (step 33). If the answer\nto the queries in steps 32 and 33 are "yes," the system (i)\ncollects all available relevant location and status information\nfor the specified inventory item and transmits this information\nto the user (step 34) and (ii) optionally causes an RFID tag, at\neach location at which a copy of the specified inventory item\nis located, to issue at least one of a visually perceptible signal\nand an audibly perceptible signal (step 35), which signal is\nterminated (step 36) (a) after lapse of a specified time interval\n(e.g.,10-120 sec) or (b) when at least one copy of the specified\ninventory item is removed from the receptacle shelf, whichever occurs first. The system then returns to step 31.\nWhen the answer to the query in step 32 is "no," the system\nnotifies the user that the specified inventory item is not\npresent, in step 37, and returns to step 31. When the answer to\nthe query in step 33 is "no," the system notifies the user that\nthe specified inventory item is present (optional), notifies the\nuser that the specified status information is not available, in\nstep 38, and moves to step 34.\nWhere the inventory item is a sensitive one (e.g., a weapon\nsystem or component thereof), the invention may be configured to report the presence or absence or non-adjacency of the\nitem at non-regular time intervals (for security purposes),\nmay be configured to promptly report any changes in the\nstatus information for the item, and may be configured to\nrequire presentation and authentication of a level of permitted\naccess appropriate for the item.\nFIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment 41, in which a sightimpaired ("SI") person seeks either an inventory item or\ninformation concerning an inventory item. The SI user 42\npasses by an inventory stack or shelving 43-i (i=1 ... ,\nN;N? 1) holding an inventory interrogation card (IIC) 44 so\nthat a selected face of the card is oriented in the general\n\ndirection of one of the stacks, or in the general direction of a\ncentral transmitter 45. Periodically, each stack 43-i and/or the\ncentral transceiver 45, transmits an indicator signal to determine if an IIC 44 is present, through receipt of the indicator\nsignal and reflection (after suitable modification) of a modified indicator signal that is subsequently received as a return\nsignal, by the stack 43-i and/or by the central transceiver 45.\nWhere no modified indicator signal is received, the system\ntakes no further action\nReceipt of the modified indicator signal indicates that a\nuser 42 is present, and the stacks are advised of the presence\nof a user. When the user 42 passes within a selected threshold\ndistance d(thr) (e.g., d(thr)=6-120 inches) of one of the stacks\n43y, that stack will provide an audibly perceptible signal APS\nannouncing the group(s) or class(es) of inventory items that\nare present on the shelf 43 -j.\nThe intensity of the reflected (modified) indicator signal\nmay be used to estimate a distance of the user from the signal\nmonitor or stack in the following manner.
