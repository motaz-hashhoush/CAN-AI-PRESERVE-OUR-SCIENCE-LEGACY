Those technology gaps identified were:\n\xef\x83\x98 Ignition power and techniques \xe2\x80\x93 catalyst systems can be heavier in mass\nthan non-catalytic systems and require significant power to utilize.\n\xef\x83\x98 Throughput \xe2\x80\x93 existing green propellant thrusters have only demonstrated a\nfraction of lifetime compared to existing state-of-the-art hydrazine thrusters.\nThe hotter combustion environment, steep thermal transients, and corrosive\nintermediate species of combustion are believed to reduce overall thruster and\ncatalyst lifetimes.\n\xef\x83\x98 Plume modeling \xe2\x80\x93 impact of continuum and rarified flow effects, effluents of\nthrusters/propellants, and impact on nearby spacecraft surfaces are not well\nunderstood.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Materials properties \xe2\x80\x93material and thermal property data on iridium, rhenium\nand/or other refractory metals, particularly at the elevated temperatures\nexperienced by green propellant thrusters, is lacking. Material compatibility,\nparticularly for soft-goods, is not well understood.\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n9\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nInter-Agency Identified Technology Gaps\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResponse time \xe2\x80\x93 required pre-heat times and ignition delays seen in state-of-theart green propellant thrusters are longer than state-of-the-art hydrazine thrusters.\nNew propellant formulations \xe2\x80\x93 other higher performing formulations of green\npropellants are being developed, and have not been evaluated to the same\ndegree as AF-M315E or LMP-103S. The trade between combustion temperature\n(and thereby thruster/catalyst life) and performance by altering the blend ratios of\npropellants isn\xe2\x80\x99t well understood. Comprehensive standards for how propellants\nare made/blended (similar to existing propellant MIL-specs) are non-existent.\nManufacturing techniques and cost \xe2\x80\x93 current material systems used in green\npropulsion systems are expensive and difficult to come by. Manufacturing\nmethods are more expensive relative to hydrazine thruster systems.\nPropellant performance modeling \xe2\x80\x93 analysis codes for more predictive analysis\nof behavior and decomposition/combustion process are lacking or non-existent.\nPropellant supply \xe2\x80\x93 current propellant formulations are either foreign sourced or\ncontain constituents that are foreign sourced. No dedicated logistical supply chain\nexists.\n\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n10\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n2016 Inter-Agency Roadmap\n\n* Presented in graphical form at 2016 JPC\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n11\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n2016 Inter-Agency Roadmap\nTimeframe\nThrust class\ntarget\n\nNear-Term Priority\nOver next 3 years\nUp to 22-N\n\nPrimary\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nTechnology\nAdvancement\nAreas\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPropellant throughput\n(duty cycles,\ncatalyst/thruster life)\nPlume measurements\n(anchor models, effects on\nspacecraft optical systems\nor solar arrays)\nTransient thermal analysis\n(non-CFD, effects on\nsoak-back temperatures)\nValve work\n(configurations, seals,\noperation)\nDecomposition chemistry\n(sooting, corrosion,\nmodeling & testing)\nPower consumption\n(catbed heating,\noperational impacts for\nhuman missions)\n\nMid-Term Priority\n3-7 years\nUp to 110-N\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nMaterials and\nproperty (M&P)\ninvestigations\n(bladder/material\ncompatibility)\nPerformance\ntrades (propellant\nvariations, scaling\neffects)\nLoading\ndemonstrations\n(at launch\nfacilities)\nSystem modeling\n(influenced by\nCFD and plume\ndata)\nCFD (kinetics)\nStorage and\ntransport (of\nloaded propellant)\n\nLong-Term Priority\n7-10 years\nUp to 440-N &\nalternative\napplications\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contamination\n(purity/quality\nimpacts)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High radiation\nflux (material\nselections)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Alternate\napplications\n(auxiliary power\nunits,\nAPU/electrical\npower units,\nEPU, etc.)\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n12\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOverview of Technology Development Areas\n(TDA\xe2\x80\x99s)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe NASA Green Propulsion Working Group reviewed the work of the 2016 Inter-Agency\nWorking Group, and concurs that the identified technical gaps and technology\ndevelopment areas are still relevant and necessary to see green propulsion technology\nadvanced\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe GPWG recommends the 2016 roadmap be adopted as baseline for NASA needs, with\nsome additions\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nThe focus of the 2016 inter-agency roadmap was primarily on the thruster technology.

other sources were considered\n\xe2\x80\x93 National Research Council (NRC) NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities:\nRestoring NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Propulsion Advancement: Challenging the Maturity of Monopropellant\nHydrazine\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA JPP article by Sackheim and Masse\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe

documents\n\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n16\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOverview of Infusion Opportunities\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAs with all Agency technology developments, the goal is the infusion of the technology into\nspace flight opportunities\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe NASA flight opportunities in the near term are most likely going to be with science\nfocused missions as well as the SmallSat/CubeSat community\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) and other Government Agencies are also interested in\ngreen propulsion development, and there are unique infusion opportunities there, as well\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor these missions the thruster sizes of interest are predominantly the 100-mN to 22-N classes\n\nThere are notable differences to the applications of the technology to the missions DoD might pursue\nvs. those that NASA might pursue\nIn general, the rapid response, high-impulse applications of DoD uses tend to require higher\nperformance propellant blends which lead to hotter combustion temperatures, shorter catalyst\nlifetimes and more exotic materials, whereas applications for NASA are more tolerant of systems that\nrequire longer pre-heat times and tolerant of slower response, but which need more robust\ncomponents where hardware can be expected to \xe2\x80\x9ccoast\xe2\x80\x9d for months to years between use\nWhile these agency needs appear divergent, the development needed to serve each mission type is\ncomplimentary, and several TDAs contribute to advancement for both types of missions\n\nFrom a NASA perspective there is no one \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d solution between the various green\npropulsion systems being developed\n\nDistribution A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n17\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nRole of Partnerships\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe current fiscal reality of government funding pushes technology\ndevelopment efforts towards more cooperative, partnership-based\napproaches\nWith the goal of fostering partnerships and promoting collaboration where\nfeasible, the GPWG intends to be a forum for communicating to and seeking\nsubject matter experts, facilities, and institutional support across NASA and\noutside the Agency\nThese partnerships include:\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntra-NASA partnerships (i.e. between Centers and/or HQ Mission Directorates)\nInter-Agency partnerships (i.e. between NASA and other government agencies)\npublic-private partnerships (i.e. between NASA and private commercial entities)\nworking with other advisory or collaborative bodies, such as technical societies (e.g. AIAA or\nJANNAF bodies)\n\nIt is also recognized that international entities have a significant investment\nin green propulsion technologies to date\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nInternational partnerships carry with them unique challenges (such as ITAR/Export Control\nrestrictions) as well as opportunities\nYet pursuing these partnerships, where permissible, can add another layer of technical\nexchange that enhances technology development efforts\n\nDistribution A: Approved for

a\nroadmap and vision for future green propulsion technology\ndevelopment.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This paper specifically presents an overview of that document.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is the intent of this group that the roadmap serve to inform and\nguide future investments in green propulsion technology in a manner\nthat addresses and aligns with NASA strategic technology\ninvestment, mission needs where they can be defined, and a vision\ntowards growth of the technology and discipline.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Additionally, the GPWG invites other Agencies or partners to\nreference the roadmap for technology development programs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is anticipated that the NASA Green Propulsion Roadmap will be\nformally published as a public NASA document by mid- to latecalendar year 2018.\nDistribution A:
