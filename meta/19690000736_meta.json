The solid-core systems are expected to have impulses in the range of 850 seconds, any thrust level (as long as it is greater than 10,000 pounds (44,480 newtons)), and thrust-to-engine-weight ratios of 2 to 20 pounds per pound (19.7 to 197 newtons per kilogram). There is negligible or no fuel loss from the solid-core system. The solid-core system, of course, has had the most work done on it. Large-scale tests have been performed on a breadboard engine that has produced specific impulses greater than 700 seconds at thrust levels of about 50,000 pounds (222,000 newtons). The liquid-core reactor would be interesting in the specific impulse range of 1200 to 1500 seconds. Again, any thrust level can be obtained depending on how big or small the reactor is made. The thrust-to-engine weight ratio for these systems would be in the range of 1 to 10. The discouraging feature of the liquid-core system is the high fuel-loss ratio anticipated. Values of 0.01 to 0.1 pound (0.00454 to 0.0454 kilograms) or uranium loss per pound (0.454 kilograms) of hydrogen are expected, if impulses in the range of 1200 to 1500 seconds are desired. The gas-core reactor shows specific impulses in the range of 1500 to 2500 seconds. The thrust levels should be at least as high as the weight so that the thrust-to-weight ratio does not go below 1. Because the engine weight is not expected to be under 100,000 pounds (444,800 newtons), thrust levels higher than 100,000 pounds (448,000 newtons) are of interest. The thrust-to-engine weights, in that case, would run from 1 to 20 pounds per pound (9.8 to 19.7 kilograms). Gas-core reactors tend to be very large, and can have high thrust-to-weight ratios. As in the case of the liquid-core system, the fuel loss that will be attendant with gas cores as envisioned today will be rather high. The loss rates will be 0.01 to 0.1 pound of uranium (0.00454 to 0.0454 kilograms) for each pound (0.454 kilograms) of hydrogen.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19690000736, "name": "Conference on Non-Chemical Space Propulsion", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "6ae3f66811a9479ab17b6817e3c3ffe1", "startDate": "1967-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19690000736, "id": "f5129a18213542b6b0b49a8ba995d34d", "publicationDate": "1968-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19690000736.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19690000736/downloads/19690000736.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19690000736/downloads/19690000736.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19690000736/downloads/19690000736.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
