The inductor is composed of two windings having a common junction. A transformer with a center tap connected to the common junction of the two windings is connected at either end of its winding to ground through controlled switches. One winding of the inductor and either end of the transformer winding are connected by power diodes to the capacitor which supplies the output voltage to a load. The other winding of the inductor is connected to a fourth power diode as a clamping diode. Input voltage is supplied to the inductor through a third controlled switch. A pulse width modulator connected to the output of the converter alternately closes and opens the switches connected to either end of the transformer winding and also closes the switch supplying input voltage to the inductor each time either of the switches connected to the ends of the transformer winding are closed. The duty cycle of the closing and opening of the several switches is adjusted by the pulse modulator to regulate the output voltage.", "title": "Buck/boost regulator", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T17:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810010865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Paulkovich, J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "052488c5182146578acebd65734ea1ca"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19810010865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rodriguez, G.
