Slightly generalized forms of the Small Gain and the\nPassivity Lieorem are derived. Some results of Part I and these theorems\nare used to derive stability criteria. The memoryless nonlinearities and\nthe multipliers are not required to be noninteracting.\n\nr\n\nIf\n\nI.\t\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Part I of this paper we have derived the best known results concerning the determinateness and the input-output properties of linear\ndiscrete feedback systems. In this Part II we are concerned mostly with\nnonlinear discrete systems. Two fundamental results in stability theory\nof feedbac\' systems are the Small Gain theorem and the Passivity theorem.\nThey are the two basic principles behind most of the stability criteria.\nThese two theorems are not new and they have been used either explicitly\nor implicitly in many papers. Here we present them in a new, slightly\nmore general form. The corresponding Section IV is essentially tutorial\nin nature. We hope that these two basic theorems will provide a more\nunified approach to the stability problem. As applications and illustrations of the power of these two theorems, we present in Section V several\nstability criteria for certain classes of nonlinear discrete systems.\nSome features of this paper are as follows: 1) We take the advantage of\nthe simpler analytic properties of the discrete case to obtain simple\nderivations. 2) We define the stability of feedback systems in terms of\ntheir input-output properties. 3) In contrast to most previous results\nin the multiple-input, multiple-output case we don\'t require the nonlinearities to be of noninteracting type. 4) By the use of the results of\nPart I, we are able to include a much broader class of linear subsystems.\n5) Using the passivity criterion we obtain a simple derivation of the\nTsypkin criterion under less restrictive conditions. 6) The paper is\nessentially self-contained.\n\n-2-\n\n=r\n\ny\n\nti\n\nII.

In fact\n(5) does not require that HO = 0; this is useful, for example, if H represents a relay or a hysteresis.

The definition of passivity is slightly more general than those used\nby Zames [1] and Sandberg [3]. Ours is inspired from circuit theory.\n(See Kuh-Rohrer [21.)\nt\n\nf\n\n\t\n\n`r\n\nIV. Main Results\n\nIn the stability studies of feedback systems in terms of inputmajor results, namely, the Small Gain\noutput properties, there are two..\ntheorem and the Passivity theorem. The Small Gain theorem is applicable to\n\nMy\n\nnorm on E n , but with the more restricting condition of re-\n\nquiring that the product of gains of two subsystems be less than 1;\nwhile the Passivity theorem is applicable on\'.y to Q n-norm. It hac the\nadvantage that, for the linear time-invariant case, the passivity condition has a frequency domain interpretation. These results have been\ndeveloped mostly for the continuous systems and are available explicitly\nor implicitly elsewhere [1, 3, 5, 14, 161. Here we are concerned only with\ndiscrete systems and these two results are genertl.ized and :Mated in\ntheir most general forms.\n\nTheorem\n\n(Small Gain Theorem)\n\nConsider the system.-J(Fig. 1) described by (1)-(4), where A1,\nH2\nru\n\nE\n\nn -+ n.

In contrast to the continuous case the two preceding theorems need\nno special assumption concerning the possibility of finite escape time.\nThe assumption of determinateness implies that, for the nonanticipative\ncase, the equations for the successive components of\n\neeand tit have a\n\nunique solution. In the linear case explicit conditions can be given\nfor this to be the case ( see Theorem 1, Part I).\n2. Many forms of these theorems have appeared in the literature. The\nbest recent ones are due to Zames ( 1] and to Sandberg ( 3]. It is intereating to note that our more inclusive definitions do not alter the essential conclusion.\n3. With respect to the Passivity theorem, ( a) we do not require H 1 to\nbe passive and\n\ntit\n\nto be strictly passive, we need only have d l + e 2 > 0.\n\nThis fact has already been observed by Stern (15] and Cho-Narendra [14].\n\n,x -*\n(b) If xtin\t , then x E R^ and ti.t ti0 as i -^ ^.

Hodever, if we want to have same results for t and e 2 , then\nthe assumption (12) is essential.\n4. The Passivity theorem and its applications (given in the next section)\n\n.j\n\nr\n\n0\n\ncan be extended in that,instead of considering only inputs with finite\n\nend, viz.\n\n{ ,,)o\t\n\n\' , ^^ 2\t\nv\n\nwith\t\n\nIvi1 2 <\n\n1-0\n\none may also consider inputs with finite avera\n\nV -\n\nti\t\n\n{N IM with lim sup 1 t\ni 0\t\n\npower, i.e.\n\n2<\n1N\n\nN-0-0 N i-0 i\n\nUnder the conditions stated, such finite average power inputs produce\nfinite average power outputs.\nThe usefulness of Theorem 2 can be greatly enhanced by modifying\nthe system j using the multiplier technique. Let M be a linear map\nIV\nfrom En onto En and suppose that its inverse, M 1 , maps E n into E n . The\nmodified system is denoted by ^M and is shown in Fig. 2.
