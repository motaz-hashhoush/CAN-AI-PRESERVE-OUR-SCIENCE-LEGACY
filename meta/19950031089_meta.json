While a relationship between the two parameters, indeed, seems to be discernible, the strength of the relationship has been overstated. Instead of being significant at the afore-mentioned level of confidence, the relationship is found to be significant at only greater than or equal to 95% level of confidence, based on Yates' modification to the chi-square test for 2 x 2 contingency tables. Likewise, while correlation analysis yields a value of r = 0.2691, it is important to note that such a value suggests that only about 7% of the variance can be 'explained' by the inferred correlation and that the remaining 93% of the variance must be attributed to other sources.", "title": "A comment on the suspected solar neutrino -- solar activity connection", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T21:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950031089, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilson, Robert M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "03fc2bfa33404f8fa3c72dc91623d842"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950031089, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1007/BF00690624", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "149", "submissionId": 19950031089, "issue": "2", "issn": "0038-0938", "id": "55cead5e7fe2456985b0669fc8a7aa7b", "publicationName": "Solar Physics", "publicationDate": "1994-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
