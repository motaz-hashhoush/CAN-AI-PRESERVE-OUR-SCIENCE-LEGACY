The cylinders are joined by a spring which maintains a constant pressure against the wound boom, to\n\nkeep it tightly wound on the storage spool during\ndeployment.\nThe boom, as stored on the cylinder, is flat, -b rut it is\nprestressed to curl into a cylinder on deployment. Upon\nwinding, the two cylinders flatten the curled boom so\nit may be stored in the flat configuration. Seltoyment is achieved by means of the stored energy of the\nwound boom element.\nThis mechanism can be used to deploy two or more\nbooms at the same time. For two booms, this is done by\nwinding a boom on each roller, and the device works\nin essentially the same way as before. To deploy several\nbooms, a number of rollers are arranged in a circle in a\nmanner similar to a "sun and planetary" gear system.In this configuration, each storage spool interacts with a\ncommon restraint roller.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
