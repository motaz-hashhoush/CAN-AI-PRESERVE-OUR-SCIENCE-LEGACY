b'130\n\n:i__\n\nEmergency\n\nMedical\n\nService\n\nThe city of Akron, Ohio now has an operational\ntelemetry-aided\nEmergency\nMedical System (EMS)\nwhich eventually will include all of Summit and\nPortage counties in northeastern\nOhio. Lewis\nResearch Center helped design the complex EMS\ncommunications\nsystem, including the telemetry link\nbetween ambulances\nand hospitals for advanced\nlife support (paramedic)\nservices.\nExtensively\nused in space operations,\ntelemetry is\nthe process wherein instrument-acquired\ndata is\ntranslated\ninto radio signals and sent to a receiving\nstation where the signals are decoded and recorded.\nIn emergency\nmedical use, it allows transmission\nof\nphysiological\ndata--an\nelectrocardiogram,\nfor\ninstance--from\nan ambulance\nto a hospital emergency\nroom, where a physician reads the telemetered\ninformation\nand prescribes\nemergency procedures\nto\nambulance\nattendants\ncaring for the patient.\nIn Akron--and\nthroughout\nthe U.S.--there\nare only\neight radio frequencies\navailable for transmission\nof\nEMS advanced life support data, which creates the\npossibility of signal interference that might disrupt\nrelay of an emergency patient\'s vital signs. Thus, one\n\nof Lewis Research Center\'s major tasks was development of a coordinated\nsystem in which each EMS unit\nand medical facility is routed to a frequency\nthat can\nbest be utilized at the moment without causing mutual\ninterference\nwith another station on the same frequency. The Lewis-designed\nsystem also includes\nprovisions for central recording of all radio and\ntelephone transmissions\nand defines strategic placement of antennas to eliminate radio "dead spots."\nAnother Lewis assignment was design of an\nelectronically\ncontrolled\nand illuminated status board\nfor the Akron Fire Department\nCommunications\nCenter (left), which serves as the regional\ncommunications\ncontrol center for the eventual\ntwo-county system. The status board is essential to\nmonitoring\navailability of all fire equipment,\nEMS\nvehicles and private ambulances;\nit also indicates the\nstatus of hospital emergency rooms in the area. Shown\nin closeup below, the status board is continuously\nposted on three electronic panels by fire\ndepartment\npersonnel. Lewis Research Center\'s\nAkron effort is a continuation\nof earlier, similar\nassistance provided other Ohio communities.\n\n131\n\n'
