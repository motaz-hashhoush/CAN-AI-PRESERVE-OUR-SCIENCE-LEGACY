b'I\n\nn n nn n\n-lr\nI \\ # I\n\nI H A D NEVER T H O U G H T OF MYSELF AS A THIEF, BUT T H E R E I WAS, PEERING AT\n\nSTUFF THAT CLEARLY WASN\xe2\x80\x99T MINE AND QUIETLY SLIPPING IT INTO MY \xe2\x80\x9cTOOLBOX\xe2\x80\x9d\nFOR MY O W N PERSONAL USE. IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT, A N D I WAS IN PLAIN V I E W\nOF A LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE. THE AUDACITY!\n\nA \xe2\x80\x99LEAST\nI\n\nTHAT\xe2\x80\x99S HOW I FELT TO ME INITIALLY. 1 HAVE\nT\n\nthe honor of being on the Academy of Program\nand Project Leadership (APPL) Knowledge Sharing\nFeedback and Assessment Team (FAA), and as such, I\nam privileged to receive the feedback written by many\nof you as attendees of the Project Management (PM)\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s Forums. It is the intent of the FAA Team\nand APPL leadership to use this feedback as a tool for\ncontinuous program improvement.\nAs a retired (sort of) PM in the payload contracting\nindustry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big supporter of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Knowledge\nSharing Initiative (KSI),especially the Master\xe2\x80\x99s Forums.\nI really enjoy participating in them. Unfortunately I had\nto miss the 8th forum in Pasadena this past Spring,\nbut I did get the feedback package for the Assessment\nTeam work. So here I was, reviewing twelve pages of\ncomments, reflections, learning notes and critiques\nfrom attendees of the 8th forum.\n\nTHE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS\nT h e FAA\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to find the positives and negatives\nin the feedback and compile them for discussion. Shortly\ninto the process of reading the comments, however, my\nmission changed. I found myself progressing through\nthe feedback, agenda item by agenda item, and actually\n12\n\nAPPL THE N A S A ACADEMY OF PROGRAM A N D PROJECT LEADERSHIP\n\nattending the forum vicariously through the feedback\nwriters! I became engrossed in the content. I felt as\nthough I was blindfolded at a fast-moving sporting\nevent and the play-by-play was being described to me\nby many others around me.\nT h e feedback was incredibly detailed and well\nwritten, complete with application notes, doubts\nand potential pitfalls. Not surprisingly, I found\nmyself learning rather than reviewing! I was actually\ntaking away knowledge, forming opinions of my own,\nand developing questions, as though I had been\nsitting right there! That\xe2\x80\x99s why I initially felt like a thief.\nActually I was experiencing remote learning, not only\nfrom the original forum presenters, but also from\nthe feedback writers.\n\nCAUGHT RED -HAND ED\nI myself have \xe2\x80\x9dstolen\xe2\x80\x9d lessons from various storytellers and practitioners that have participated in APPL\xe2\x80\x98s\nprograms over the years. I took the importance of storytelling as a means of conveying lessons learned-and also\nways to implement this tool with a program team-from\nAnnette Simmons\xe2\x80\x99s ASK 18 Special Feature, \xe2\x80\x9dDressing\nup the Naked Truth.\xe2\x80\x9d From Dr. Gary Klein, a keynote\nspeaker at the 7th Master\xe2\x80\x99s Forum, I discovered the use\n\nof \xe2\x80\x9dpre-mortems\xe2\x80\x9d as risk identification tools to help a\nteam communicate effectively with a shared risk management philosophy. I learned ways to spot the predictors of\nsuccessful program management behavior during the\nselection interviewing process from ASK feature writer\nScott Tibbitts\xe2\x80\x99s article, \xe2\x80\x9cTell Me About Your Lemonade\nStand,\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared in ASK 18. And these are just a\nfew of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken away with me.\nAs for the feedback accounts, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the\n8th forum was a huge success. As I reviewed the\nagenda topics, then read the presentation slides and\nthe feedback, I found many of the common themes\nthat always surface when Program/Project Managers\nget together to discuss successes and failures. A\nfew of these common success factors were: effective\ncommunication both inside and outside your project\nteam;the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d management- rather than\n\xe2\x80\x9dtechnical\xe2\x80\x9d management-is the most important factor\nfor overcoming adversity; and the argument that leadership is founded on the principles of interpersonal\nrelationships-including mutual respect, trust, open\ncommunication, and the creation of an environment\nthat encourages new ideas and personal growth. And\neven though these are repeating success factors, there\nare always new stories, new thoughts, and new shared\nexperiences dealing with their successful application.\nBut my review of the forum material and feedback\nalso revealed some newer topics as well. This knowledge,\ntoo, I snatched up like the proverbial starving squirrel\nafter the world\xe2\x80\x99s last acorn; into my own PM toolbox\nthey went! This included thoughts and concepts such\nas \xe2\x80\x9dthe conductor does not make any noise, but\ngets the best possible music out of the orchestra.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI learned new ideas for motivating teams and individuals and reflected on a debate about intrinsic vs.\nextrinsic motivation. I also read about the increasing\nimportance of coaching and mentoring with notes\nfor effective implementation of these concepts, the\nuse of Test Readiness Levels (TRL) for managing\nSoftware project risk, considerations for establishing\npro-active \xe2\x80\x9ccoyote teams\xe2\x80\x9d versus re-active \xe2\x80\x9ctiger teams\xe2\x80\x9d\nand more.\n\nLIKE T A K I N G CANDY FROM A BABY\nThis exercise in remote learning has been valuable\nto me. It has provided many new ideas for me and\nreinforced existing project management success\nconcepts. It has illustrated to me, and hopefully to you,\n\nthat we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be there to learn from it. T h e\navailable material alone is very useful. Coupled with the\nexcellent feedback from the gracious attendees, it was\nalmost as good as being there!\nAnd the folks at APPL are great at keeping the\nforum agendas and the presentation packages on their\nwebsite, which can be accessed according to the forum\nnumber and date at http://appl.nasa.gov/businessunits/\nknowledge/programs/master-forums. html.\nYou may have also noticed that many of the Forum\npresentations also appear in narrative format in A S K\nMagazine, available online at www.appl.nasa.gov/ask.\nThat means that this same knowledge, without the\neditorial comments found in feedback, is available on\nthe APPL website to everyone, whether you attended\nthe forum or not. Anyone can \xe2\x80\x9dsteal\xe2\x80\x9d this knowledge\nsharing opportunity.\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x98t able to attend the 8th forum this past year,\nbut I was able to take part in the knowledge sharing.\nTo those of you who wrote the excellent feedback,\nI thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to seeing you in\n0\nSan Francisco!\nL1:ssoss\nWhen you are open to it, Knowledge Sharing becomes\na tool for life, not a one-day workshop. Never underestimate the lessons you could learn from \xe2\x80\x9ccommunities of\npractice\xe2\x80\x9d composed of your experienced peers.\nReinventing the wheel isn\xe2\x80\x99t admirable if it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to steal, imitate, revise, and reuse the\nlessons and best practices of others.\n\nsno\\\nFor learning to occur, errors, mistakes, and occasional failures\nmust be accepted. How does one create the conditions that\nouercome human nature: the fact the \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone wants to learn,\nbut nobody wants to be wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\nQLI\n\nAfter over 28 years of program management\nexperience, LARRY GOSHORN retired in 2003\nfrom Ill\xe2\x80\x99s Aerospace/Communications Division\nas the Director of Space Programs.
