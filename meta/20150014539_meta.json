Low self-esteem and related mental health problems are common in obese children (Strauss RS, 2000) as well as poor academic performance and career development (Gurley-Calvez T, 2010).Westernized dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles are identified as the major risk factors of current alarming rate of obesity along with genetic susceptibility (Popkin BM, 1999). Children in many countries, including South Korea, have become increasingly sedentary due to urbanization changes in their respective societies (Ng SW, et al. 2009, Salmon J et al. 2011). In particular, South Korea had abundant dissemination of mobile technology, such as tablet and smart phone devices. Children have become reliant on mobile devices and are less likely to perform physical activities (Do, et al, 2013). Effective and sustainable intervention programs are needed to fight the global obesity epidemic (IOM, 2012; Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015). Previous studies suggested focus on prevention strategies that begin in early childhood, a period when children establish their life habits. (Salmon J et al. 2011). Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis including ours found that obesity prevention programs for young children have a greater intervention effect (Waters E, et al, 2011; Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015). The NASA Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut (MX) program was developed to promote children's exercise and healthy eating with excitement for training like an astronaut (Lloyd C, 2012).At present, the NASA MX Program covered 28 countries, enrolled children through their teachers in school setting (MX report 2014, 2015). This pilot study adapted the NASA MX intervention program for young children in South Korea. We assessed its feasibility and effectiveness in promoting physical activity (PA) in children and in improving parents' perspectives. We also examined the status of PA in young children. More than 80% of five-year-old children go to a Kindergarten or day care center in South Korea (MH Suh et al, 2013).Thus, reaching young children through child care and education settings could be a good approach for early childhood obesity prevention.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150014539, "endDate": "2015-11-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Obesity Society", "location": "Silver Spring, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8407e82602b14bbfa1886dfac7e44367", "id": "8c37ca59ce984221934b66872e895cc2"}], "name": "ObesityWeek 2015", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "8407e82602b14bbfa1886dfac7e44367", "startDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150014539, "id": "284ace016c5d4be4b42418b862eae0f9", "publicationDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150014539.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150014539/downloads/20150014539.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150014539/downloads/20150014539.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150014539/downloads/20150014539.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
