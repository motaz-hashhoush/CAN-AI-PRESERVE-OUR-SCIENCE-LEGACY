INTRODUCTION\nImage registration is the process of determining\nthe\nposition\nof\ncorresponding\npoints in two images of the same scene.\nUsually image\nregistration involves resampling of one of the images so that a point in the\nscene has the same coordinate values in both of the images. In this paper\nregistration of images that have translational and rotational differences will\nbe discussed.\nImage registration has many applications. Some of the applications of image\nregistration are in change detection, motion analysis, object tracking, and\nobject recognition. Analysis of two or more images of the same scene often\nrequires registration of the images.\nOne of the first attempts to register images digitally was made by Anuta\n[Anuta 69].\nHe used cross-correlation as the similarity measure to search for\ncorresponding windows in the two images. The centers of the resultant matched\nwindows\nwere taken as corresponding control points for estimating the\ntranslational difference between the images.\nImage registration by cross-correlation has proven to be very effective and\nit is still one of the best techniques in image registration. However, this\ntechnique can only register images that have translational differences.\nComputation of cross-correlation is also time consuming. To speed up the\nprocess, Anuta used the fast Fourier transform algorithm to compute the\ncross-correlation values [Anuta 70].\nSum of absolute differences has also been\nused as an alternative similarity measure to speed-up the window search process\n[Barnea 72].\n* This work has been supported in part by NASA Grant NGL-23-004-083.\n1033\n\nMost of the work in image translational registration has been centered on\nspeed-up techniques rather than the accuracy of the registration. Dewdney has\nproposed a steepest-descent algorithm to limit the window search domain and\nthus achieve a higher speed [Dewdney 78].\nA two-stage window search technique has also been used [Vanderburg 77].\nIn\nthis technique, first a subwindow is used to locate possible locations for a\nmatch. Then the whole window is used to locate the best match position among\nthe possible ones.\nThis technique was later extended to the coarse-fine\nsearching technique, where a coarse window is used first followed by a finer\nresolution window [Rosenfeld 77], This window search process has been expanded\nto the multi-stage search technique in which in the first stage, the lowest\nresolution window is used and then higher resolution windows are successively\nused in each subsequent stage [Hall 76, Tanimoto 81].\nOther similarity\nmeasures which have been used in the window search process are Haar transform\ncoeffficients [Chandra 82], Walsh-Hadamard transform coefficients [Schutte 80],\nand invariant moments [Wong 78].\nWhen the images are rotated with respect to each other, the above window\nsearch techniques for determination of corresponding points in images, will\nfail. This is because, even though the centers of two windows correspond, we\nmay obtain low similarity measures due to the fact that other points in the\nwindows may not correspond to each other. For example, Figure 1 shows two\nwindows in which their centers correspond to each other but since other points\nin the two windows do not correspond, low similarity is obtained.\nAs a matter of fact, similarity measure is not the only problem.\nWhen two\nimages are rotated with respect to each other, it is impossible for two\nrectangular windows to contain the same parts of the scene (except when the two\nwindows are rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees with respect to each other).\nAs shown in the two rotated windows of Figure 1, although the centers of the\nwindows correspond to each other they don\'t contain the same parts of the\nscene.\nThis problem can be alleviated if we use circular windows.\nThen when the\ncenters of two windows correspond to each other, the two windows will cover the\nsame parts of the scene no matter what the rotational difference between the\nwindows. Figure 2 shows two circular windows which are rotated with respect to\neach other and since their centers correspond to each other, they contain the\nsame parts of the scene.\nIn this paper we will show that rotated images can be searched and matched\nby using circular windows and invariant moments as the similarity measure. Hu\nhas derived a set of invariant moments such that if two windows contain the\nsame pattern, they will have similar invarinat moments no matter what their\nrotational differences [Hu 62]. We will normalize 8 invariant moments and use\nthem in the computation of the similarity measure between two windows.\nIn the following, invariant moments are first described and their use in\ntemplate matching is given.\nThen the window search process using invariant\nmoments with circular windows is discussed including a procedure for the\ndetermination of registration parameters. Finally, the result of the proposed\napproach on registration of multi-satellite images is presented.\n\n2. INVARIANT MOMENTS\n\nThe two dimensional (p+q)th order moment of a digital image f is defined by\n111^=\n\nSZXPyqf(x,y)\n\n(1)\n\n1034\n\nwhere f(x,y) is the pixel value of image f at location (x,y) [Hu 62].\nMeasure m\nchanges if image f is translated. To make m\nrespect to translation of f, m\nis modified as below,\n\nu^\n\ninvariant with\n\nzr(x-x\')p(y-y\')qf (x,y)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nx\'=\n\n2Zxf(x,y)/\n\n2 2f (x,y)=m10/m00\n\ny\'=\n\nzzyf(x,y)/\n\n.Z 2 f (x,y)=m01/m00\n\nu\nis called the (p+q)th order central moment of image\nwith respect to translation of image f [Hu 62].\n\nf\n\nand\n\nis invariant\n\nWe still cannot apply u\nin the template search process because u varies\nwith respect to the rotation of image f. Hu has been able to derive moments\nthat are invariant with respect to rotation [Hu 62]. He has shown that an\ninfinite number of such moments exist.\nThe second-order and third-order\nmoments which are invariant with respect to rotation (and translation) of f are\ngiven by,\na\n\nl=u20+ U02\n\n(3)\n\na\n\n(4)\n\na\n\n(5)\n\n2=(u20~u02)2+4ull2\n3=(u30"3u!2)2+(3u2ru03)2\n\na\n\n4=(u30+u!2)2+(u21+u03>\n\n\'a5=(u3Cf3u12)(u30+u12)[(u30+U12)2-3 <U21+U03)2]+\n(3u21-u03)(u21+u03)[3(u30+u12)2-(u21+u03)2]\na\n\n6=(u20"U02)[(u30+U12)2\'(u21+u03)2]+4ull(u30+u12)(u21+u03)\n7=(3u2l\'u03)(u30+u12)[(u30+u12)2~3(u21+u03)2]"\n<u30-3u12)(u21+u03)[3(u30+U12)2-(u21+u03)2]\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\na\n\n(9)\n\nUsually more than one moment is used in decision making. One way to measure\nsimilarity between two windows is to compute the distance between two vectors\nof moments. The smaller the distance, the more similar the two windows\n[Giuliano 61]. This method however requires that the feature elements in the\nvectors be of the same unit (or scale). Moments of different orders do not\nhave the same scale. Table l.a shows a 16x16 window whose moments upto order 5\nare shown in Table l.b. As can be seen, moments of different order are in\ndifferent magnitudes because of scale differences.\nThe correlation of the logarithm of moments has been used by Wong to measure\nthe similarity between two windows [Wong 78]. Again, the moments of different\norders have different scales and using the logarithm of the moments does not\nsolve the problem.\nNote that ir. Table l.b, the logarithm of the moments\nincrease with the order of the moment. If the correlation of logarithm of\nmoments are determined, high correlation values will always be obtained\nregardless of the dissimilarity between the two windows. So, the correlation\nof the moments is not an appropriate measure of similarity either. The\ncorrelation between two sets of numbers is defined when the numbers in each set\n1035\n\nare in the same scale.\nWhen features of different scales are used in the\ncomputation of correlation value, the feature with the largest scale dominates\nthe correlation value.\nGarrett has proposed the concept of pairing function where the similarity\nbetween two sets of features is determined by quantizing the features and\ncounting the number of quantized features that are equal [Garrett 76]. In this\ntechnique, since the features in the two sets are quantized into the.same\nnumber of levels, it is as if the features in the two sets are in the same\nscale.\nThis alleviates the problem of scale differences but this similarity\nmeasure does not provide information about how closely two features match.\nWhen\nthe feature values are quantized^ critical information needed in\nsimilarity measurement might disappear. So, the pairing function is also not\nappropriate for measuring the similarity between two windows when moments are\nused as features.\nTo overcome the above problems, we normalize the moments so that they all\nhave the same scale.\nThe normalized moment of order (p+q) for image f with\ndiemensions N by N is defined by,\nMpg=\n\n\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3 (x/x")p(y/y")qf (x,y)\n\nwhere\nx"=(l/N) ||X=N(N-H)/2N=(N+l)/2\ny" = (l/N) J_y= (N+D/2\n|y, {x/[ (N+D/2] }p{y/[ (N+D/2] }qf (x,y)\n,\n|\n\nSo, actually Mpg=\n\n= [2/(N+l)]p+q\n=\n\n_!!_ xpyqf(x,y)\n\n[2/(N-H)]P+qmpg\n\nSo, the normalized (p+q)th order moment is equal to the (p+q)th order\nmoment.\nmultiply the scaling factor [2/(N+D]p+q. Table l.b shows the normalized\nmoments for the window of Table l.a. As can be seen, moments of all orders\nhave the same scale now.\nTo determine the normalized central moments, we replace x by x/[ (N+D/2] and\ny by y/[ (N+D/2] in formula (2).\nU\n\npq=\n\n,l,x^1I(x"X\')/\n)]p\'l"q\n\nZ|S|(x-x\')p(y-y\')qf(x,y)\n\n=[2/(N+l)]p+qu,\n\npq\n\nIn the same manner we can determine the normalized invariant moments (formulas\n(3) to ( ) , in which each is multiplied by only a scaling factor. We will be\n9)\nusing the normalized invariant moments from two circular windows as features\nand by computing the cross-correlation\nbetween these feature values, the\nsimilarity of windows will be determined.\n\n3.\n\nDETERMINATION OF REGISTRATION PARAMETERS\n\nThe ultimate goal is to determine the translational and\nrotational\ndifferences (registration parameters) between two images. A minimum of two\npairs of corresponding points from the two images are required to determine the\nreqistration parameters.\nTo determine a pair of corresponding points in two\n\n1036\n\nimages, a small window called a template, is taken from one image and a larger\nwindow, called a search area, is extracted from the other image. The template\nis shifted in the search area until the position where the template best\nmatches in the search area is determined. At the best match position, the\ncenter of the template corresponds to the center of the window in search area\nover which the template lies.\nIn order to make the window-matching procress more reliable, templates\nshould be taken in a high variance (high information) area in the image. An\nautomatic procedure for selection of high information templates has been\ndefined [Davis 78]. This procedure selects windows that are well separated and\nhave a large number of high gradient, high curvature, connected edges in the\nimage.\nThe search area should be selected such that the window corresponding\nto the template is not missed.\nGiven.a circular template and a\ndetermines the position where the\nusing invariant moments.\nAlgorithm A;\n\nsearch area, the following algorithm\ntemplate best matches in the search area\n\nTemplate matching by invariant moments.\n\n1. Select template W of size NxN from a high information area in one image.\n2. Select search area S of size MxM in the other image such that it contains\nthe template.\n3. Determine the n normalized invariant moments of the template, let them be\nal, a2, . . an.\n4. For I = N/2 to M-N/2+1\n5.\nFor J = N/2 to M-N/2+1\n6.\nDetermine the n normalized invariant moments of the window cantered at\n(I,J) in the search area and size NxN, let them be al\', a2\',\nan\' .\n7.\nFind the cross-correlation between {al, a2, . . an} and {al1,\na2\'.\n, an\'}, let it be r(I,J).\n8. Let (I\',J\') be that (I,J) such that r(I\',J\')=Max r(I,J). Then (I\',J\') would\nbe the coordinates of the center of the window\'in the search area which best\nmatches with the template.\n9. The center of the template corresponds to location (I\',J\') in the search\narea. By this, a pair of corresponding points from the two images are\nfound.\nTemplate size NxN, search area size MxM, and the number of invariant moments\nn are specified by the user. If the template size is too small, it may not\ncontain enough information to carry out a reliable search.\nIf the template\nsize is too large, the search process becomes costly. So, selecting the right\nsize template is very important.\nUsually, smooth areas of an image require larger template sizes than\ndetailed ones.\nSince an image may contain both smooth and detailed areas, a\nconstant template size may not be adequate and different size templates may\nhave to be used. Dynamically determining template size at every step, however,\nis time consuming and it adds overhead to the already slow search process.\nTraditionally, template size has been selected heuristically. We have\nfollowed the tradition and have tried different template sizes. The smallest\nsize which gave reasonable accuracy was taken as the template size.\nFor the\nimages we had, templates of size 16x16 turned out to be appropriate.\nSearch area size is another parameter which should be given by the user and\nit should be taken in such a way that it contains the template. Another\nparameter is the number of invariant moments required in the matching process.\nThe greater the number of moments the more accurate this matching but the slower\n1037\n\nthe search process. We have used 8 normalized invariant moments.\nThese are\nthe zeroth order, second order, and third order normalized invarinat moments.\nThe zeroth order moment is equal to the sum of intensity values in a window.\n\na =u =M\n\no o oo=moo=\n\n?? f <*.y>\n\nUsing Algorithm A, a number of corresponding points from the two images can\nbe obtained. There are possibilities of mismatches in the process and some of\nthe corresponding points may not actually correspond to each other.\nNon\ncorresponding points should be eliminated before registration parameters are\ncomputed.\nAn effective method for detection of points that do not correspond to each\nother is given in [Fischler 81].\nIn this method, for each two pairs of\ncorresponding points in the two images the transformation parameters are\nestimated from formula (10).\nThen a clustering is performed in the parameters\nspace. Correct matches tend to make a cluster while mismatches tend to scatter\nrandomly in the parameter space. Those points which produce parameter values\nlarger than a given threshold value from the cluster center are taken as\nmismatches and are eliminated from the set.\nOnce a number of valid corresponding points from the two images are\ndetermined, the estimation of registration parameters is straight forward. Two\nimages that have translational and rotational differences can be related to\neach other by\nx\'=xcos6-ysin6+h\n(10)\ny\'=xsin6+ycos6+k\nwhere (x\',y\') and (x,y) are the coordinates of corresponding points in the\nimages. If we replace cos6 by a and sine by b we get,\n\ntwo\n\nx\'=ax-by+h\ny\'=bx+ay+k\nNow if coordinates of n corresponding points from the two images are given, we\ncan estimate a, b, h, and k.by minimizing the following sum of squared errors.\nE= Z\n\n{[xi\'-(axi-byi+h)]2+[yi\'-(bxi+ayi+k)]2}\n\nTo minimize E with respect to a, b, h, and k, we find the partial\nderivatives of E with respect to a, b, h, and k. Set them equal to zero, and\nsolve the system of linear equations.\n?(xi2+yi2)\n0\n\nZ(xi\'xi+yi\'yi)\n2\n\n2\n\nZ(xi + yi )\n\n2(yi\'xi-xi\'yi)\n\n2 xi\n\n0\n- Zxi\n\n(11)\n\nn\n\nwhere (h,k) is the translational difference and 6= cos a and 6=sin b is the.\nrotational difference between the images. Knowing h, k, and 8, we can map one\nimage into another by the transformation functions of (10).\n\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTwo images from two different satellites were used to test the above image\nregistration technique.\nFigure 3 shows a thermal-infrared image of Michigan\n\n1038\n\nobtained by the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES) on 24\nJune 79 at 3:00 PM. Figure 4 is a day-visible image of approximately the same\narea obtained by the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) satellite on 26 Sept.\n79.\nBoth GOES and HCMM images were already geometrically corrected. The\noriginal HCMM image has 500x500 meter resolution. Since the GOES image has\n8x11 km resolution, the HCMM image was smoothed in 16x22 neighborhoods and was\nresampled to the same resolution as the GOES image. The two images now have\nthe same scale but have translational and rotational differences.\nSince two windows with similar pattern but different intensity values result\nin different invariant moments, we have used the gradient of the two images\nrather than the images themselves in the registration. This reduces the effect\nof intensity difference between the two images.\nSix points from the GOES image was selected by hand.\nCircular templates\nwith an 8 pixel radius were taken centered at the selected points.\nSearch\nareas with a radius 16 pixels were selected from the HCMM image in such a way\nthat they included the template areas. For each template and search area,\nAlgorithm A was executed to determine the best match position of the template\nin the search area.\nTransformation parameters were obtained by using\nthe\n6\npairs\nof\ncorresponding points from the two images and solving the system of linear\nequations shown by (11).\nThe rotational difference between the two images was\n11.5 degrees and the translational difference between the two images was\n(9.4,-13.8). The GOES image was resampled by the nearest neighbor method and\nusing the transformation,\nx\'=0.98x-0.20y+9.4\ny\'=0.20x+0.98y-13.8\nwhere (x\',y\') and (x,y) are coordinates of corresponding points in the HCMM and\nGOES images, respectively. Figure 5 shows the resampled GOES image. GOES and\nHCMM images are subtracted in Figure 6 to visualize the registration.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA technique for registration of rotated images using normalized invariant\nmoments was given.\nThe technique first locates a number of corresponding\npoints in two images by window searching and then estimates the registration\nparameters using the corresponding points and minimizing the sum of squared\nerrors.\nThis technique can be used in registration of\nmulti-satellite\nand\nmulti-temporal images.\nIf the images have scaling differeences, a low-pass\nfilter can be used on the high resolution image and resample it to the same\nresolution as the low resolution image since resolution of satellite images are\nknown. This alleviates the problem of scale difference between the images.\nThe technique given above can then be used to determine the rotational and\ntranslational differences between the images. An example was given showing\nregistration of HCMM and GOES images which had, known scaling difference but\nunknown rotational and translational differences.\n\nREFERENCES\n[Anuta 69] "Digital Registration of\n\nMulti-Spectral\n1039\n\nVideo\n\nImagery",\n\nPaul\n\nE.\n\nAnuta, Soc.\n168-175.\n\nPhoto-Optical\n\nInstrum.\n\nEngs.\n\nJ., Vol.\n\n7, Sept.\n\n1969, pp\n\n[Anuta 70] "Spatial Registration of Multispectral and Multitemporal Digital\nImagery Using Fast Fourier Transform Techniques," Paul E.

Franklin, Student, Department of Forestry; William D. Hudson, Research Specialist, Center for\nRemote Sensing/Department of Forestry; and Carl W. Ramm, Assistant Professor, Department of Forestry\n\nSummary\nThis study evaluated the use of Landsat computer enhanced imagery for mapping coniferous forest types in\nMichigan\'s northern Lower Peninsula. Visual interpretation procedures were developed and tested over two sites\nto determine the feasibility of identifying coniferous\nspecies. The accuracy achieved by two interpreters was\ncompared and summarized in contingency tables.\nOverall classification accuracies were 85 and 73 percent; individual species interpretability accuracies\nranged from a low of 32 percent for mixed pine stands to\n95 percent for jack pine plantations. Most of the errors in\nmapping the pines were accounted for by confusion between the individual pine species. The swamp conifer\ntype had consistently low interpretation accuracies at\nboth test sites. Other factors affecting interpretation accuracies were also identified and are reported.\n\nIntroduction\nWith more than half of Michigan presently in forests (19\nmillion acres), a large industrial capacity depends on a\nsteady supply of industrial roundwood. There is a possibility of losing a portion of this resource base because of\npopulation growth, highway and powerline construction,\nand residential development.\nMichigan\'s timber volumes are assessed periodically\nthrough the Forest Survey, an inventory conducted by\nthe U.S.D.A. Forest Service designed to measure and\nevaluate timber conditions and the supply and drain situation. However, the survey is conducted only every 10 to\n15 years, is not site-specific, and is statistically reliable\nonly on a multi-county basis. There is a need for detailed\nlocational information on Michigan\'s forest types to supplement and update cover type maps produced from traditional field techniques and aerial photography.\nNew developments in remote sensing techniques are\nproviding foresters and other vvildland managers unique\n* This research was supported hy a National Aeronautics and Space Administration grant, NASA NGL 23-004-083, to Michigan State University-. Center for\nRemote Sensing and by federal funds from the Mclntire-Stennis Law (P. L. 87788).\n\nopportunities for earth-resource inventories. Although\nstill considered by many to be in the developmental\nstage, the Landsat program has generated considerable\ninterest from the scientific community and resource managers. The system has provided readily available data on\nan unprecedented scale. The large aerial coverage (about\n13,225 square miles per image) and 18-day repetitive acquisition cycle provides a unique opportunity for large\narea mapping and inventory updating.\nSeveral studies have been conducted on using Landsat\ndata in mapping forest resources in Michigan. One of the\nfirst (4), conducted under a National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration ERTS-1 Project Grant, analyzed\nboth visual and computer assisted interpretations.\nA later attempt to map tree species and species groups\nfrom June data, using automated recognition techniques,\ndid not produce a classification with acceptable accuracy\n(6). A study utilizing visual interpretation of winter Landsat imagery, with snow cover on the ground, to map scattered woodlots obtained accuracies ranging from 74.0 to\n98.5 percent (2).\n\nStudy Area\nThe climate, physiography and soils of the northern\nLower Peninsula combine to create a unique region, as\ncompared to the southern Lower Peninsula or the Upper\nPeninsula. One of the most distinctive landscapes are\nhigh outwash plains near the center part of the region,\nwhich are dominated by stands of pines and oaks. These\nextensive, flat, sandy plains \xe2\x80\x94 where the large white pine\nforests of Michigan formerly grew \xe2\x80\x94 support much of the\nnearly 7 million acres of forest found in this unit.\nHardwood forests are more extensive than the softwoods with aspen-birch, a sub-climax type, the most common throughout the region. The northern hardwood type\nis most prevalent in the northwestern counties; lowland\nhardwoods are primarily restricted to riparian sites.\nThe softwoods, or coniferous forest types, occupy approximately 22 percent of the region. Three-fifths of these\nconifers are pines; jack pine, the most important pine sub-\n\nFigure 2. High-altitude aerial photograph of test site number\n1, west central Wexford County.\n\nFigure 1. The northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the\nlocation of two test sites.\n\ntype, accounts for more than half the acreage. Jack pine\noccurs as a relatively pure type in a broad belt from the\ncentral northeastern area, south and west to the southwest central area. Significant areas are also found in the\neast and west central counties (5).\nThe swamp conifer types \xe2\x80\x94 consisting predominately\nof cedar with lesser areas of black spruce, balsam fir-white\nspruce, and tamarack \xe2\x80\x94 comprise less than 9 percent of\nthe forest land. These swamp conifers occur most frequently as small patches of a few acres on wet lands. The\nexceptions are in the northeastern counties where these\nspecies are more frequent and exist as larger stands (5).\nTwo test sites were chosen in the northern Lower\nPeninsula (Figure 1) to be representative of areas now\nsupporting large acreages of conifers. The first test site\n(Figure 2) was located in west central Wexford County\n(T. 22 and 23 N., R. 12 W.) and is underlain primarily by\nstratified sand and gravel outwash deposits confined to a\nbroad valley (i.e., a valley train). Most of the area was\ncleared for agriculture at one time, but later was abandoned as unsuitable for sustained crop production.\nThe present forest covers more than 40 percent of the\narea and is predominately pine plantations. Red pine accounts for 60 percent of the plantations, jack pine is predominate in 29 percent and 11 percent are mixtures of red\nand jack pine. Ten percent of the forest land is composed\nof the swamp conifer type. These stands, composed of\nscattered northern white-cedar intermixed with lowland\nhardwoods, are concentrated along several creeks\ntraversing the region.\n\nThe second test site was located in northeastern Crawford County and southeastern Otsego County (T. 28 and\n29 N., R. 1 W.). This area is part of an extensive outwash\nplain and is typical of the "jack pine flats" of the northern\nLower Peninsula of Michigan. No evidence of land clearing for agriculture is present and the forest is entirely natural (i.e. there are no plantations).\nThe area is nearly entirely forested, with conifers dominant on 72 percent of the area, the remainder being\npredominately hardwoods, grass or brush. Pines are located throughout the site except for two large swamps\nwhich support lowland conifer species. Jack pine is by far\nthe predominant species throughout the site and represents more than 70 percent of the softwood acreage.\n\nMethodology\nThe Landsat (land satellite) system is the major component of NASA\'s land observation program. These satellites, orbiting the earth at an altitude of 570 miles, are\nconfigured to provide global coverage once every 18 days.\nThis repetitive coverage capability, combined with the\nunexpected long life of the satellites, has prompted\nnumerous investigations into the "operational" use of\nLandsat data.\nThe primary sensor aboard the satellite is a multispectral scanner. This instrument is an electronic imaging device which records sunlight reflected from the surface of\nthe earth in four specific wavelength bands. Two of these\nbands are in the visible spectrum, at 0.5 to 0.6 u,m (green)\nand 0.6 to 0.7 u.m (red), and two are in the reflected infrared portion of the spectrum at 0.7 to 0.8 (im and 0.8 to\n1.1 |j.m.\nThe analog signals from the detectors in each of the four\nbands are converted into digital electronic signals for\ntransmitting to ground receiving stations. This digital information can then be processed and stored in a computer\nor converted to film images portraying the original\nscenes.\n\nIn 1977 the U.S. Geological Survey\'s EROS Data Center began producing a new Landsat image product, referred to as computer enhanced imagery (7). This product\nutilizes advanced digital image processing techniques and\nis produced from digitally preprocessed Landsat computer compatible tapes. Enhancement and restoration algorithms were designed to reveal more textural information and spectral contents to users.\nFour techniques were applied to the imagery used in\nthis study: 1) radiometric restoration --a histogram\nequalization technique to remove the striping effect;\n2) contrast enhancement \xe2\x80\x94 a linear contrast stretch to\nprovide improved contrast and maximum color variation;\n3) edge enhancement \xe2\x80\x94 filtering to boost the high frequency content and thereby improve image sharpness;\nand 4) synthetic line generation \xe2\x80\x94 removing cosmetic defects caused by errors in data transmission.\nAfter the digital data have been processed with these\nalgorithms, the data for each Landsat band are printed on\n9Vz" black-and-white film with a laser beam film recorder.\nFalse color composites are generated by successive exposure of three bands, using appropriate filters, onto color\nfilm. Standard composites are created by printing band 7\n(0.8 to 1.1 Jim) with a red filter, band 5 (0.6 to 0.7u.m) with\na green filter, and band 4 (0.5 to 0.6 \\t,m) with a blue filter.\nThis combination produces a color composite which resembles a color infrared photograph.\nBecause the study dealt only with coniferous vegetation, a "leaf-oS" scene was chosen (Figure 3) because of its\nsharp tonal (color) contrasts of several coniferous forest\ntypes (Figure 4). Based upon an initial analysis of this\nscene and the characteristics of the coniferous forest distribution in the northern Lower Peninsula, a classification\nscheme was developed.\nBecause of their large aggregate acreage and wide distribution, stands of jack pine, red pine, and mixed stands\nwould be delineated; but white pine, which represents\nless than 1 percent of the forest land, would not be separated out. Lowland conifers, because of their small total\nacreage and tendency to form highly mixed stands, were\ngrouped into a single category.\nThe resulting classification scheme utilizes portions of\nboth Level IV and Level III of the Michigan Land Cover/\nUse Classification System (3). This classification is also\ncompatible with the major forest types and subtypes used\nby the U.S.D.A. Forest Service in conducting the Forest\nSurvey (1).\nTo faciliate interpretation and mapping functions, a\npin-registered overlay system was utilized. For each test\nsite, a base map was constructed from U.S. Geological\nSurvey topographic maps. These maps, at a scale of approximately one inch to the mile, were registered, via\npunched holes aligned by a metal pin bar, with the\n"ground truth" maps and the Landsat interpretation\nmaps. This system permitted precise overlaying and coin-\n\nFigure 3. Portion of Landsat false color composite E-244315415, April 6, 1976.\n\nFigure 4.

These photo keys were prepared to illustrate the appearance of the different coniferous forest types on Landsat false-color composites. Additional training consisted\nof the systematic comparison of several examples of each\nforest type on high-altitude color infrared photography\nand on the Landsat color composite, coupled with specifically gathered forest stand inventory measurements.\nThe intrepretation entailed the enlargement of the\nLandsat color composite on a precision rear projector.\nMagnification was controlled by matching the enlarged\nLandsat scene to the previously prepared base map, and\nthen replacing the base map with a blank sheet of polyester film. Utilizing the previous photo comparisons and\nphoto keys, the interpreters identified and delineated the\nboundaries of all coniferous forest stands.\nTone, and in some cases, texture were the main interpretation criteria for the pine classes. Proximity to stream\ncourses and water bodies were an additional aid in distinguishing between upland pine types and lowland swamp\nconifers.\nTo evaluate the accuracy of the visual interpretation\nprocedure, the Landsat interpretations were compared\nwith previously compiled cover type maps. These were\nprepared specifically for this project and were constructed from photo interpretation of medium-scale\n(1:24,000) color infrared photography. Additionally, both\nU.S.D.A.

In effect, a third,\nor composite, map resulted (Figure 6); which was used to\ncategorize misclassified stands and determine accuracy of\nagreement.\nThe classification proceeded as follows, using as an example the stands in Figure 6: stands numbered 1 through\n5 were correctly delineated and identified as to species;\nstands numbered 6 and 8 were correctly delineated, but\nmisclassified as to species; stand number 7 represents a\ncommission type error (i.e., a stand was delineated\nwhere, in fact, none existed); and stand number 9 represents an omission type error (i.e., the stand was not included in the delineation). The area of each of these\nstands was measured using a 160 dot/inch 2 grid and the\nresults summarized in contingency tables (Tables 1\nand 2).\nThese two-way cross-tabulations permit the results to\nbe viewed from two approaches. By reading across a row,\none may observe which categories, and to what degree of\naccuracy, a particular cover type was delineated. By reading down a column, one may observe the actual cover\ntypes composing each Landsat classification. For discussion purposes, accuracy was summarized as the ratio (expressed as a percent) of correctly delineated and classified\nstands to the total count of that cover type as interpreted\nfrom the Landsat scene.\nTable 1 summarizes the Landsat interpretation accuracies for the Wexford County test site, which had an\noverall classification accuracy of 85 percent. The high accuracies obtained for both red and jack pine are probably\na direct result of their high stocking levels and frequent\noccurrence in pure plantations.\nMixed plantations, where neither species represents\nmore than 75 percent of the stocking, were consistently\nmisclassified. Further investigation revealed that two-\n\nLANDSAT SCENE 2443-15421\nApril 9, 1976\nOceana County, Michigan\nT 1 6 N - R 15 W\n\nHIGH ALTITUDE COLOR IR\nSeptember 15, 1972\nClassifications: R - Red Pine\nJ - Jack Pine\nThe high-altitude photo coverage is outlined on the Landsat photo.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nRED PINE\nStocking: 200sq. ft.

One of several photo interpretation training aids prepared to show coniferous forest types on high-altitude and Landsat\nphotography.\n\nthirds of these errors were accounted for by commission\nand omission errors to the red pine type. Additional cross\nchecks confirmed that the majority of errors in the pine\ntypes were due to misclassifications among the several\npine species.\nAccuracies obtained without considering the withinpine variability, that is, utilizing a "pooled" pine category, shows that pines were correctly interpreted 93 percent of the time.\nThe swamp conifer type was correctly delineated and\nclassified with approximately 73 percent accuracy. The\nlower reported accuracy (52 percent) resulted from a large\ncommission type error. Upon examining the medium-\n\nscale photography, the majority of these errors occurred\nwith swamp areas dominated by lowland brush and/or\nlowland hardwood species. Further "lumping of species\nwas attempted and indicated that forest land as a single\ncategory was interpreted with 90 percent accuracy.\nTable 2 summarizes the Landsat interpretation accuracies for the Crawford County test site. The lower accuracies for both red and jack pine may be caused by their\nlower stocking levels, with many stands grading into nonforest categories (i.e., less than 25 percent stocked). The\nvarious forest types encountered at this site exhibited less\ncontrast than those at the Wexford County site. Most errors in the pine categories occurred among the various\n\nReferences\n\nCOVER TYPE MAP\n\nLANDSAT INTERPRETATION\n\nCOMPOSITE MAP\n\nFigure 6.

Again, "pooling"\nthe pine types increased overall interpretation accuracy\nto 77 percent for the pine category.\nErrors in the swamp conifer type were similar to those\nfound in the Wexford County site. Lowland brush, often\nwith scattered trees, were the most frequently misinterpreted areas, although some confusion between jack pine\nand swamp conifers did occur. Overall forest/non-forest\naccuracies, 81 percent, were substantially below those\nobtained over the Wexford Countv site.\n\n1. Chase, Clarence D., Ray E. Pfeifer and John S.\nSpencer, Jr. (1970).

Resource\nmanagers (or their staffs) who can extract information\nfrom aerial photographs have a powerful tool to aid their\ninformation needs.\nThis publication will provide an introductin to the\nidentification of forest types and tree species from\nmedium scale color infrared aerial photograph)\'. The\nmaterial was originally compiled for use in a short course\non the interpretation of color infrared airphotos for\nforest resource inventories. It was designed to be\' a\npractical reference on the techniques of airphoto interpretation and is used to support the lectures and\nexercises.\nWhile the basic techniques of airphoto interpretation\nare easily learned, their effective use is normally\nacquired only by practice. Although considerable\ntraining and experience are required before one becomes proficient at delineations, a careful study of the\nmaterials in this publication should allow you to begin to\nmake correct interpretations.\nSeveral references exist on species identification that\napply to the forests of Michigan. The interpretation of\ntree species from medium scale (1:15,840 to 1:20,000)\npanchromatic photograph) has been covered in Photographic Interpretation of The Species in Ontario\n(Zsilinszky, 1966). Although it covers tree species in\nOntario, most also occur in Michigan. Included are\ndetailed descriptions of identifying features, comparisons of similar species and illustrations of actual\nphotographic stereopairs. Additional work on the forests\nof Canada, applicable to Michigan forest types, include\ngeneralized photo interpretation guides (SuynWittgenstein, 1978) and a series devoted to the recognition of tree species on large scale photos (1:1,000 to\n1:3,000) by crown characteristics (Sayn-Wittgenstein,\n1960 and 1961).\nThe use of color aeria! photography for identifying\ncertain conifers and hurdwoods of the northeastern U.S.\nhas been dealt with by the U.S. Forest Service (Heller,\nDoverspike and Aldrich. 1964). Interpreting forest\ntypes in the Lake States with black-and-white infrared\nphotography (1:12.000 to 1:15,840) is covered in two\nreports of the U.S. Forest Service (Chase and Korotev,\n\nFigure 1. Generalized forest regions in Michigan (individual\ntree distributions, as compiled by the U.S. Forest Service\n(Little. 1971 and 1977). are available in the form of tree\ndistribution maps).\n\n1947 and Region Nine, U.S. Forest Sen-ice, 1947). The\nlatter consists of 49 photographic stereograms illustrating sample forest condition classes and species.\nThe present publication covers interpreting medium\nscale (1:24.000) color infrared aerial photography for\nidentifying common forest types and tree species of\nMichigan. This is an extension of a previous effort to\ndevelop techniques for mapping forest resources on a\ncounty-wide basis (Hudson, Amsterburg and Myers.\n1976,).\nThe characteristics of 17 cover types (13 forest types\nor tree species and 4 non-forest cover types) and their\ninterpretation are presented. For each type its occurrence is briefly described by forestregion (Figure l)and\nsite requirements are given. Descriptions follow of\nthose attributes of a tree or stand which are helpful when\nattempting to interpret the type from a vertical perspective. The description of common crown shapes has\nfollowed a system (Figure 2) developed by the Canadian\n2\n\neliminate species. The natural associations of\ncertain species may suggest the presence of a second\ntype, or eliminate the probability of a particular tree\nspecies. The tendency of certain species to form\ncharacteristic stands (i.e., pure, uneven-aged, coppice\nstands, etc.) will also be useful in the interpretive\nprocess.\n\nWhite Pine\n\nnorrflwly\n\nb\'OOOly\n\nct>n,cai\n\nconical\n\n%\n\nWhite pine^ occurs throughout the Northern Forest\nand in portions of the Boreal and Central Hardwood\nForest Regions. While more abundant in the Upper\nPeninsula (U.P.), it is also common in the northern\nLower Peninsula. White pine grows on a wide variety of\nsites in natural stands. More than half of them are located\nin the western U.P.\nWhite pine occurs as a component of other forest\ntypes, either as an overstory or scattered individuals. On\nmoderately well drained, mesic sites, it is associated with\nsugar maple, yellow birch, beech, basswood and hemlock. On dry sites, such as dunes and outwash plains, it is\nfound with red pine (where it may be a dominant or codominant component of the stand), jack pine, red oak,\nblack oak, white birch and quaking aspen. On moist sites,\n\'Scientific names of tree species are given in the Appendix.\n\nFigure 2. Several common crown shapes (reprinted by\npermission of the Canadian Forestry Service).\n\nForestry Service (Sayn-Wittgenstein, 1978). Identification of the forest type or species by using image\ncharacteristics (e.g. size, shape, shadow, color, texture,\npattern, size or association) is then discussed. Individual\ntypes are accompanied by ground photos, sketches and\nstereogramsl of "typical" stands.\nGeneral knowledge of forest ecology, and thorough\nknowledge of local environmental conditions, are very\nimportant in forest interpretation. With sufficient local\nexperience and data, the interpreter may use phenological phenomena to help distinguish between species\nand groups. The following events are useful on a given\nsurvey: date of leaf flushing, description of immature\nfoliage, date of flowering and fruiting, time of fall\ncoloring, description of fall colors and time of leaf fall\n(these topics are covered in considerable detail in SaynWittgenstein, 1961b and 1978).\nA working knowledge of the ecological and silvicultural characteristics of the species in the area being\nstudied is of great importance in the interpretive process. Knowing site requirements or preferred habitat of\nspecies or groupings will often narrow choices or\n\'Copies of the stereograms. printed on color photographic paper, are available\ntor purchase from the Center for Remote Sensing, 302 Berkey Hall, Michigan\nState University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1111.\n\nFigure 3. White pine illustrating characteristic branching\nhabit.\n\nFigure 4. Mature white pine stand, Allegan State Came\nArea.\n\nsmall ridges or mounds in swamps and poorly drained\nsites, it may occur with white and black spruce, balsam\nfir, northern white-cedar, quaking aspen and red maple\n(Barnes and Wagner, 1981.).\nIn the western U.P., white pine is a frequent component of the northern hardwood, aspen and spruce-fir\nforest types. In the eastern U.P., it is more commonly\n\nfound in the cedar, red pine and black spruce forest\ntypes. In the northern lower Peninsula, it is a common\ncomponent of the oak and aspen forest types. White\npine is a commonly planted species, though not as\ncommon as red or jack pine.\nWhite pine is one of the tallest trees in Michigan and\nusually has a straight, undivided trunk. Branches along\nthe stem are often large and occur at nearly right angles\nin a whorl-like arrangement. Those in the upper crown\nare smaller and sweep upwards (Figures 3 and 4).\nWhen viewed from above, the large horizontal\nbranches are very prominent, giving the crown an irregular star-shaped outline (figures 5 and 6). This\ndistinctive shape is clearly displayed on trees which are\nover-mature, open-grown, or in mature stands where\nwhite pine towers above associated species (area 3 in\nFigure 58). Young white pines often have nearly conical\nor pyramidal shaped crowns.\nIdentification is possible by recognition of a shelf-like\npattern displayed by shadows. Color varies from light\npurple to salmon but is always the "lightest" of the three\npines (Figure 7.). Plantation white pine may be distinguished by its color, light brown to salmon, and its\n"ragged" or "fuzzy" texture, especially as compared to\nred or jack pine plantations (area 1 in Figure 58).\n\nFigure 6. White pine stand, Kalkaska County.\n\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of white\npine illustrating vertical and horizontal\nviews (Figures 5, 9, 14, 19, 24, 28, 32 and\n36 reprinted by permission of the\nCanadian Forestry Service, from SaynWittgenstein, 1960).\n\nFigure 7. White (1), red (2), and jack pine (3) plantations illustrating relative\ntonal differences.\n\nRed Pine\nRed pine is primarily a tree of the southern Lake\nStates, but does occur farther north with a scattered\ndistribution. It is commonly found on level or gently\nrolling sand plains throughout the northern Lower\nPeninsula and portions of the U.P.\nRed Pine grows in both pure and mixed stands.\nCommonly associated species include jack pine, aspen,\nwhite birch and northern pin oak on dry sites and white\npine, red maple, red oak, balsam fir and white spruce on\nmoist sites. Red pine is a frequent component of the\naspen, white pine and jack pine forest types in the\nwestern U.P.; the jack pine cover type in the eastern\nU.P.; and the aspen-paper birch and oak forest types in\n\nthe northern Lower Peninsula Red pine is the most\nextensively planted species in Michigan.\nRed pine has a straight, columnar trunk often clear of\nbranches for one-half to two-thirds of its height. Large,\nhorizontal and spreading branches form a broadlyrounded crown which is rather open (Figure 8).\nAs viewed from above, the crown appears circular,\nbeyond which individual branches rarely protrude\n(Figures 9 and 10). Red pine may be distinguished by a\nhoneycombed stand pattern and a saw-toothed profile\n(Zsilinszky, 1966) (Figures 11,12 and 13). Color will be\na reddish-brown or sometimes a light-true-brown, intermediate between white and jack pine. Red pine\nstands appear more uniform and less "jagged" than\nstands of white or jack pine (Figures 7, 13 and 58).\n\nJL\nFigure 9.

Forest cover types: 1) red pine plantation, 2) northern white-cedar,\n3) northern hardwoods, 4) jack pine plantation, 5) aspen, 6) lowland\nhardwoods and swamp conifers and 7) Christmas tree plantation.\n\nJack Pine\nJack pine occurs extensively in Michigan, common in\nboth the Boreal and Northern Forest Regions. This\nspecies is found on a variety of sites, but is most\ncharacteristic of dry, coarse, sandy outwash plains. It\noccupies large areas of these plains in both the U.P. and\ncentra] portions of the northern Lower Peninsula.\nCommon, associated species include: red pine,\nnorthern pin oak, black oak and bigtooth aspen. Jack\npine is often a component of the oak, aspen and red pine\nforest types. Farther north, jack pine may occur on more\nmoist, sandy soils near swamps where it may be associated with black spruce and tamarack. Jack pine is a\ncommonly planted species.\nJack pine normally forms a small, narrow crown of\nshort branches with a roughly cylindrical shape (Figures\n14 and 15). This is especially true of trees growing in\nclosed stands. When open grown, the crowns tend to be\nrounded but irregular. When viewed from above, jack\npine crowns appear irregularly rounded, fuzzy and\nrelatively small and pointed (Figures 16, 17 and 18).\nPure jack pine stands appear hazy with a somewhat\nuniform texture, which contrasts with the more ragged\nappearance of spruce. Jack pine normally appears as a\nblue-black color, but may tend towards black or\nblackish-brown. It always has the darkest tone of the\nthree pines (Figure 7). Plantations appear more irregular than red pine, but often more uniform than\nwhite pine (Figures 7 and 13).\n\nFigure 15.\nshapes.\n\nJack pine stand illustrating typical crown\n\nvmf8SS\xc2\xa3i\n\xc2\xa3s\xc2\xa3twa?\n\n:\n\nW^ii^\n*%\xc2\xa3\'?&\'&*$\n\xe2\x80\xa2^y/^M^\': \' M\nFigure 14.

Jack pine stand, Kalkaska County.\n\nFigure 18. Jack pine stand, Crawford County.\n\nBeing exceedingly intolerant of shade, tamarack\nfrequently grows in the open or, if growing under forest\nconditions, it is usually dominant with its crown above\nthe level of the crown canopy.\nTamarack is a medium-sized tree with a straight,\nundivided trunk. The crown consists of short horizontal\nbranches forming an open, pyramidal shape (Figures 19\nand 20).\nTamarack may\'be identified by its symmetrical, coneshaped crown and light purplish-blue color (Figures 21\nand 67). It is distinguished from black spruce, its\ncommon associate, by the somewhat broader crown and\nlighter color.\n\nTamarack\nTamarack is widespread throughout the Boreal and\nNorthern Forest Regions. It reaches the southern limit\nof its range in the northern portions of the Central\nForest Region. It is usually confined there to small, relic\nstands in bogs and swamps.\nIn the northern part of its range, the northern Lower\nPeninsula and especially the eastern U.P., tamarack is a\ncharacteristic tree of wetland sites where it is either a\npure type or in association with black spruce. On the\nmore productive swamp sites, it may form part of the\nmixed conifer swamp type, a mixture of northern whitecedar, black spruce, balsam fir and tamarack - - none of\nwhich comprises a majority of the stand (Eyre, 1980).\nOn upland sites, associated species include: balsam fir,\nwhite birch and aspen.\n\nFigure 19. Schematic diagram of tamarack illustrating the\ncharacteristic open, pyramidal shape.\n\nFigure 20. Tamarack illustrating typical crown shapes.\n\nFigure 21. Tamarack, Wexford County.\n\n9\n\nSpruce-Fir\nThe spruce-fir forest type, although usually found in\nthe Boreal Forest, occurs in both the Upper Peninsula\nand the northern Lower Peninsula. Balsam fir is typically\nthe most abundant species of this cover type. White\nspruce, along with quaking aspen and white birch, are\nthe most frequently occurring associated species.\nThe type is usually represented by pure stands of\nbalsam fir, and less frequently white spruce, although it\noccupies a relatively small areal extent. Both species are\ncomponents of the northern hardwood and aspen forest\ntypes in the Upper Peninsula and the cedar and aspen\nforest types in the northern Lower Peninsula. Balsam fir\noften occurs as an understory in the aspen and paper\nbirch types. Although found on a variety of sites, this\ntype is typical of mesic to moist conditions.\nWhite spruce is a medium to large tree with a single,\nstraight trunk. The crown is often large, dense and\nconical. The symmetrical crown forms more of a broader\ncone than black spruce or balsam fir (Figures 22, 23 and\n24).\nWhen viewed from above, spruce-fir stands may be\nidentified by thier symmetrical, broadly conical and\npointed crowns (Figures 24, 25 and 26). The type may\ndisplay an irregular stand profile with a rough, uneven\ntexture. Color will vary, depending on the site, from light\nbrown to a deep purplish magenta (Figures 26 and\n27).\n\nFigure 22.\ncrowns.\n\nWhite spruce illustrating broadly conical\n\nFigure 23.

Spruce-fir forest type, Mackinac County.\n11\n\nBlack Spruce\nThe black spruce forest type is fairly widespread and\ncommon in the northern part of its range, but is much\nless common in the southern parts of Michigan, being\nquite rare in the southern Lower Peninsula The type\ngrows on organic soils, sphagnum bogs and poorly\ndrained swamps.\nBlack spruce often occurs in pure stands but may\ncontain white pine, cedar and balsam fir as associated\nspecies. Black spruce is also found in the cedar, sprucefir and aspen forest types in the Upper Peninsula. It may\noccur as a pure type in the northern Lower Peninsula,\nbeing most commonly found in cedar, spruce-fir and\nmixed conifer swamps.\nBlack spruce is a relatively small tree, seldom exceeding a height of 60 feet. It has a slender trunk with\nlittle taper, supporting a narrow, irregularly conical to\nnearly cylindrical crown (Figures 28 and 29).\nBlack spruce is recognized by its slender and almost\ncylindrical crown which appears fairly smooth (Figure\n30). Stands appear quite regular, especially pure stands,\nwith even or gradual changes in height. Color varies\nfrom light to dark but is always a bluish-black hue\n(Figures 43 and 52).\n\nFigure 28. Schematic diagram of black spruce illustrating\nthe narrow, nearly cylindrical crown.\n\nFigure 29. Black spruce illustrating characteristic crown shapes.\n\nFigure 30. Black spruce stand, Delta County; the broadleaved trees on the\nhigher sites are northern hardwoods.\n\n12\n\nHemlock\nEastern hemlock occurs throughout the Northern\nForest, but is most common in the western U.P. It occurs\nto some extent in the northern Lower Peninsula, but is\nrestricted in the southern Lower Peninsula to cool, moist\nsites. It may form pure stands but is usually found in\ngroups within the northern hardwood forest type. The\ntype prefers moist flats and low-lying areas but is also\n\nfound on drier sites. Commonly associated species include: beech, sugar maple, red maple and yellow\nbirch.\nEastern hemlock is a large tree with a straight trunk\nsupporting a broadly conical crown (Figure 31). The\ncrown is broader than those of balsam fir and white\nspruce and has a less apparent taper (Figure 32). When\nviewed from above, hemlock crowns will appear irregularly rounded and somewhat star-shaped, although\nnot as prominant as white pine (Figures 33 and 34). The\ntype displays a rough texture and appears a deep purple\nmagenta.\n\nFigure 31. Hemlock illustrating the characteristic broadly\nconical crown.\n\nFigure 32.

Hemlock (H) and white pine (W) stands, Luce County;\nthe surrounding broadleaved forest is predominantly northern\nhardwoods.\n\n13\n\nNorthern White-Cedar\n\neven into the southern Lower Peninsula The cedar type\nis primarily found on organic soils of swamps and along\nstream borders, but not in stagnant swamps or bogs. It\nalso occurs on limestone uplands, especially adjacent to\nthe Great Lakes.\nNorthern white-cedar grows in both pure stands and\nas a component of the mixed conifer swamp type.\nCommonly associated species include: balsam fir, black\nspruce, white pine, tamarack, black ash and red maple.\nCedar may also form a component of the spruce-fir and\nlowland hardwood forest types.\nNorthern white-cedar is normally a small tree which\nseldom exceeds 50 feet in height. The tapering trunk\nnormally supports a full dense crown, slightly conical,\nand has a rounded top (Figures 35 and 36). When\ngrowing in dense stands, as in a swamp, the individual\ntrees display a variety of shapes and appear more\n"pointed" than open grown trees (Figure 37).\nThe cedar type is recognized by the dense, very\nsmooth crown, though not as symmetrical as balsam fir.\nStands may appear open with an irregular stand pattern\n(Figure 38). Cedar is normally a distinctive dark brownmagenta (Figures 58 and 13).\n\nNorthern white-cedar occurs in the Boreal Forest, but\nis more common throughout the Northern Forest. It is\nmost common in the eastern U.P. and the northern\nLower Peninsula, but does occur in the western U.P. and\n\nFigure 35. Northern white-cedar illustrating characteristic\ncrown shapes.\n\nFigure 37. Dense stand of northern white-cedar with\n"pointed" crown tips.\n\nFigure 36. Schematic diagram of northern\nwhite-cedar illustrating vertical and\nhorizontal views.\n\nFigure 38. Northern white-cedar, Presque Isle County.\n14\n\nAspen\n\nThe most common species found in association with\naspen are paper birch, red maple and pin cherry, with\nbalsam poplar often present on wetter sites. Quaking\naspen is sometimes a component of the northern hardwoods, spruce-fir and lowland hardwood forest types\nwhile bigtooth aspen is commonly associated with both\nthe northern hardwood and oak (especially in the\nnorthern Lower Peninsula) forest types.\nBoth of the aspens have single, straight trunks, with\nbranching mainly confined to the upper reaches of the\ntree (Figure 39). Since they are intolerant species and\noccur in even aged stands, aspen displays a uniform\nstand pattern. Crowns are rounded, small (as compared\nto the tree\'s height) and consist of relatively few\nbranches (Figures 40, 41, 42, 43 and 52.). Because of its\nthin foliage, aspens cast lighter shadows than most other\nhardwoods.\n\nThe aspen type is very widespread throughout the\nNorthern and Boreal Forests, and is commonly found in\nthe Central Forest. Aspen is very common throughout\nMichigan, although the largest acreage is found in the\nnorthern Lower Peninsula. It is found on most sites\nexcept the driest sands and wettest swamps. Trembling\nor quaking aspen is found on a variety of soils. Bigtooth\naspen is restricted to more mesic or dry sites.\n\nFigure 39. Aspen illustrating the characteristic straight\ntrunk and small, somewhat rounded crown.\n\nFigure 40. Schematic diagram of an aspen stand illustrating\nhorizontal and vertical views.\n\nFigure 41. Aspen stand, Wexford County.\n15\n\nThe stand structure is very systematic and a high\ndensity of stocking (many thousands of trees per acre)\nproduces an unbroken, grainy texture (Figures 43 and\n44). The tendency to form clones can result in a stand\npattern which appears patchy or "clumpy" with single\n\nclones typically 1/10 to an acre in size. The aspen type\nnormally appears a bright red or magenta; fall coloration\nproduces pink and, eventually, white colors. Coloration\nmay be patchy whenever clonal grouping is present.\n\nFigure 42. Aspen stand, Montmorency County.\n\nFigure 43. Forest cover types: 1) aspen, 2) oak, 3) red pine plantation and 4)\nblack spruce; the cleared area, between 2 and 3, supports reasonably thick\naspen reproduction.\n\nFigure 44. Dense stand of aspen reproduction.\n\n16\n\ngrows on a variety of upland sites, and along lake and\nstream borders and as a pioneer on burned and clear-cut\nareas.\nThe type may occur as a pure stand or with the\nfollowing associated species: quaking aspen, red maple,\nwhite pine and balsam fir. White birch is also a\ncomponent of the northern hardwood, aspen, cedar and\nlowland hardwood forest types.\nWhite birch has two distinct growth forms: single,\nstraight stems (Figure 45) and multiple, often leaning\nclumps (Figure 46). Crowns maybe ovoid to irregularlyrounded and are usually smaller than those of aspen.\nWhen occuring in pure groups or stands, the stand\npattern is quite regular and even (Figure 47) or displays\na "patchy" pattern due to coppice clumps. White birch\nappears bright red magenta or occasionally a reddishpink.\n\nWhite Birch\nWhite birch is found throughout the Boreal and\nNorthern Forest Regions. In Michigan, it is most\ncommon in the northern half, reaching its southernmost\nlimit in the southern Lower Peninsula. White birch\n\nFigure 46. White birch illustrating multiple, leaning clump\nform.\n\nFigure 45. White birch illustrating a single, straight trunk.\n\nFigure 47. White birch stand, Emmet County.\n\n17\n\nOak\nThe oak forest type is widespread in the Central\nForest Region and the southern portion of the Northern\nForest Region. Since most oaks reach the northern limit\nof their ranges in Michigan, the oak forest type is most\nabundant in southern Michigan. Oaks occur on a variety\nof sites, but are commonly found on mesic to dry upland\nsoils. The composition widely varies, changing from the\noak-hickory associations of the Central Forest in the\nsouthern Lower Peninsula, to a northern mixed oak\ncomplex, often referred to as "scrub oak," on the\noutwash plains of the northern Lower Peninsula (Arend\nand Scholz, 1969).\nPrincipal species include northern red oak, white oak,\nblack oak and shagbark hickory in the south with black\noak, northern red oak, white oak and northern pin oak\nmore abundant in the northern Lower Peninsula.\nNorthern and central hardwoods are commonly associated species on the better sites, whereas red maple,\naspen and jack pine are associates on the more droughty\nsites. The oak species also occur as components of both\nthe northern hardwood and aspen forest cover types.\nMost oaks are medium to large trees with straight\ntrunks supporting a few large, spreading branches. The\n\nFigure 49. Black oak illustrating ascending branches and\nround-topped crown.\n\ncrowns are large to massive and relatively broad when\ncompared to the trees height (Figure 48). The larger\nbranches are somewhat ascending, and the overall\ncrown solid and somewhat round-topped (Figure 49).\nOak stands are recognized by their broad, solid\ncrowns, even stand pattern and rounded or wavy texture\n(Figures 43, 50, 51 and 52). Occasionally a stand will\ndisplay a rough, somewhat broken texture due to\nscattered, small openings in the stand. Oaks appear from\nlight to deep red or magenta except during fall\ncoloration when they appear a rusty-red brown\n(sometimes orangish-brown-red).\nFigure 48. White and Black oaks illustrating broad,\nspreading crowns.\n\n18\n\nFigure 50. Oak stand, Crawford County.\n\nFigure 51. Oak forest cover type, Muskegon County.\n\nFigure 52. Forest cover types: 1) black spruce, 2) oak and 3) aspen.\n19\n\nNorthern Hardwoods\n\nspecies. Other, associated species include: white ash,\nblack cherry, red oak, white spruce, white pine and\nbalsam fir.\nThe type is generally found on loamy soils with good\nfertility and moisture conditions, but may extend into\nsandy soils. The type covers extensive areas throughout\nMichigan, especially in the western U.P. Old-growth\nstands are typically uneven-aged, whereas many second\ngrowth stands are even-aged.\nBecause of the number of species and their associations, it is difficult to describe a typical stand. Most of\nthe species are relatively shade tolerant and support a\nmedium to large, irregularly rounded crown (Figure 53).\nStand structure, especially in young, even-aged stands,\nappears solid and even (Figures 54 and 55). Although\nthe crowns may be small and about the same size, they\nare irregular in outline when compared to aspen or\nwhite birch (Figure 56). Crown texture is a distinctive\nfeature, especially when the stand is composed of a\nvariety of species and/or tree and crown sizes, and\nappears rough with distinctive crown-edge shadowing\n(Figures 26, 57 and 58). The northern hardwood type\ndisplays variable colors within a stand, the colors ranging\nfrom shades of pink to dark red and creating a mottled\neffect (maples produce a distinctive pink color [Figure\n30]).\n\nNorthern hardwoods is a broadly defined forest cover\ntype used to describe several upland association. The\nmajor northern hardwood species is sugar maple in\nvarious mixtures including yellow birch, bassvvood,\neastern hemlock and red maple. Sugar maple is\ndominant in most stands and is the most characteristic\n\nFigure 53. Yellow birch illustrating a large, irregularly\nrounded crown.\n\nFigure 54. Profile view of a northern hardwood stand\nillustrating the solid and even stand structure.\n\nFigure 55. Schematic diagram of a northern hardwood stand illustrating horizontal (left) and vertical\n(right) views.\n\n20\n\nFigure 56. Northern hardwood stand, Alger County. Note the small but\nirregular crown shape.\n\nFigure 57. Northern hardwood stand, Alger County.\n\nFigure 58. Forest cover types: 1) white pine plantation, 2) aspen, 3) scattered\nwhite pine over northern white-cedar, 4) northern hardwoods, 5) lowland\nhardwoods and 6) red pine plantations.\n21\n\nLowland Hardwoods\nLowland, or swamp, hardwoods occur throughout the\nNorthern Forest and into parts of the Central Forest.\nOccupying moist to wet mineral and muck or shallow\npeat soils, they are found in swamps, gullies and small\ndepressions of slow drainage or in elongated areas along\nsmall sluggish streams, occasionally covering extensive\nareas. This type often grades into northern white-cedar\non the wetter sites.\nPrincipal species include black ash, elm, red maple\nand, in the northern Lower Peninsula, balsam fir.\nCommon, associated species are: basswood, eastern\nhemlock, white birch, white pine, aspen, northern\nwhite-cedar, tamarack and black spruce. While the type\nis commonly found in the northern Lower Peninsula and\nthe eastern U.P., it can be found in the southern Lower\nPeninsula or the western U.P. where site conditions are\nfavorable.\nThe lowland hardwood species maybe recognized by\ntheir large, ascending branches spreading from the\ntrunk (Figure 59). When viewed from above, these\nbranches display a characteristic forked or divided\ncrown and produce a rough texture (Figure 60). The\ntype is separated from aspen by its more broken and\nstaggered stand pattern and from swamp conifers by the\nlarge, ascending branches and rounded crowns of the\nhardwoods (Figures 58 and 61).\nThe ground often appears as very dark colors beneath\nthis type due to the open nature of the stands, soil\n\nFigure 59. Red maple illustrating ascending branches,\ncharacteristic of many lowland hardwood species.\n\nmoisture and under-story vegetation (Figures 60 and\n62). Lowland hardwoods display a rough, uneven\ntexture and vary in color from dark pink to purple\n(Figures 13 and 58). Because of their topographic\nlocation, lowland hardwoods are some of the first trees to\nshow fall coloration (Figure 63). Bright shades of yellow,\npink and greens are common of this type.\n\nFigure 60. Schematic diagram of a lowland hardwood stand illustrating horizontal (left) and vertical\n(right) views.\n\n22\n\nFigure 61. Lowand hardwood stand, Schoolcraft County.\n\nFigure 62. Lowland hardwood stand, Muskegon County.\n\nFigure 63. Oblique view of lowland hardwoods showing fall coloration while the\nupland forest types are still predominantly green.\n\n23\n\nNonforested Cover Types\nLowland Brush\n\nLowland brush (alder, dogwood, willow, etc.) often\nforms clumps of several crooked stems (Figure 64)\nwhich merge to form a continuous canopy. The crowns\nare indistinct and create a somewhat rough (wavy)\ntexture (Figure 65). The canopy may be solid or broken\nby patches of open water, aquatic plants or scattered\ntrees.\nLowland brush is distinguished from aspen reproduction by its topographic location, irregular stand\npattern and lack of evidence of logging or other disturbance. This type normally appears in shades of "rustyred" magenta.\n\nFigure 64. Lowland brush illustrating characteristic stand\nprofile.\n\nFigure 65. Lowland brush, Muskegon County.\n\nBog/Treed Bog\nThese areas of peat land or muskegs support mosses\nand low bog shrubs and occasionally a sparse stocking of\ntamarack, spruce, cedar, aspen or jack pine (Figure 66).\nBogs follow the contour of a topographic low or depression and may contain open water in the middle. This\ntype has a rusty-orange or rusty-light-brown color and\npresents a smooth to grainy texture (Figure 67).\n\nFigure 66. Bog supporting low bog sbrubs and scattered\ntamarack and black spruce.\n\nFigure 67. Bog, Missaukee County; the scattered trees are tamarack.\n24\n\nUpland Crass\nThese upland sites contain less than 10% stocking of\ntree species or shrubs and are dominated by either grass,\nferns or blueberries (Figure 68).\nUpland grass areas display an extremely smooth\ntexture with no detectable pattern or shape (Figure 69).\nThe color of natural grass is light magenta to light blue or\ncyan in contrast to the brighter red magenta of managed\ngrass (Figure 70).\nFigure 68.

Masonf\n\'Agricultural Experiment Station, ""Department of Entomology, "\'Center/or\nRemote Sensing, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, U.S.A.\n^Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, U.S.A.\nABSTRACT\nChanges in surface temperature resulting from the activities of man are evaluated using\nmeteorological satellite (NOAA and HCMM) and aircraft data. Study sites were located in\nFlorida and Michigan. Thermal data showed that day surface temperatures over large areas\ncould be increased by 10-15\xc2\xb0C by modifications resulting from agricultural practices.\nChanges in reflected solar radiation as a function of agricultural practices were detectable\nusing HCMM data. \\/\nINTRODUCTION\nThrough time, man is gradually modifying more of the earth\'s surface to optimize conditions\nfor habitation. The changes are largely for crop production, animal grazing and utilization\nof biomass for cooking and heat. In this process forests are being converted to pastures\nand farmlands, grasslands are being grazed by domestic animals, new species of plants are\nbeing introduced and major portions of the surface are being drained or irrigated.\nThis process has evolved slowly over centuries, but has speeded up dramatically during this\ncentury. Increasing modification of the surface for food production has been an essential\npart of increasing the earth\'s carrying capacity from two billion at the turn of the century\nto over four billion at the present time. Further, these changes will be occurring at an increasingly rapid rate as the projected population of the earth doubles by the year 2020 til .\nRelatively few studies have assessed the magnitude of these changes or their impact on surface boundary conditions [2,4]. Many characteristics of the surface, including temperature,\nradiation and surface roughness, could be altered significantly. This paper shows that Information available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA\'s\nHeat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) satellites and airplane scanner data can help assess the\nimpacts on surface temperature and radiation of man\'s modification of our planet.\nMETHODOLOGY\nSeveral recently launched meteorological satellites have collected valuable data on reflected radiation in the .5 to 1.1 micron range. This band has the information needed for\ngood estimates of solar reflectance from different surfaces [5]. Also, data from scanners\nsensing in the 10.5 to 12.5 micron range are available on several satellites which can be\nused to determine surface temperature. Accuracy and resolution of these systems is sufficient to characterize vegetative types and to provide answers about the magnitude of changes\nthat might be expected with deforestation or other significant changes in existing vegetation.\nNOAA satellite data provides one kilometer resolution in the thermal (10.5 to 12.5 microns).\nThe satellite orbits over at approximately 1000 and 2200. The sun- synchronous HCMM satellite\nprovides high resolution thermal data with a .6 km by .6 km resolution at nadir, in the 10.5\nto 12.5 micron range. Also, the concurrent visible channel 0.5 to 1.1 microns with a dynamic\nrange of approximately 100 percent albedo and resolution of .5 km by .5 km at nadir potentially will provide the essential data required to meet the objective of characterizing solar\nreflectance [6].\nFor the NOAA data, transparencies were used, digitized and analyzed on the Image 100 at the\nKennedy Space Center. The HCMM data was obtained in both pictorial and digital forms. Ana-\n\nl/Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station Journal Article Number 10531.\n\n71\n\n72\n\\\n\nJ. Bartholic et al.\n\nlysis was done at the Center for Remote Sensing and the Image Processing Laboratory at Michigan State University.\nThe digital HCMM reflected radiation data were used to find the relation between vegetation\ntypes and reflected values. The reflectance image was thresholded at different values and\nthe regions showing the same reflectivity were isolated for each classification. The isolated regions were compared with an already classified Landsat image.\nA Daedalus DS-1250 scanner with 8-14 microns thermal channel was flown to obtain high resolution inputs required to assist in the analysis. This data was acquired on analog tape\nthen digitized and analyzed on the Image 100 at the Kennedy Space Center.\nThe study areas were mainly in Florida and Michigan. The NOAA satellite and aircraft data\nwere obtained for Florida and HCMM data was used for analysis of the Michigan test site.\nRESULTS\n\nNOAA thermal satellite imagery for April 28, 1978 at about 1000 (Fig. 1) shows darker areas\nas warmer and lighter areas as cooler. The agricultural areas in the Mississippi Valley\nand the southern portions of the United States including Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina,\nplus major areas of Florida, are shown to be markedly warmer (darker) than the adjacent\nnaturally vegetated areas. Separate analysis indicates that many of the darker areas are\nabout 10-12\xc2\xb0C wanner than the adjacent natural areas.\n\n;\'.-;; .\n\nMore detailed examination of the Florida peninsula is possible in Fig. 2 (note that warmer\nareas appear lighter, the reverse of Fig. 1). In April, many fields in north central Florida\nare tilled and crops do not yet cover a significant portion of the surface. These agricultural areas are in long, broad strips generally lying in a north-south direction and are much\nwarmer. Some of the greatest thermal contrasts in southern Florida occur between the water\nconservation reserves in the Everglades and the adjacent agricultural areas that have been\ndrained. The adjacent agricultural areas are to the north and just south of Lake Okeechobee.\nBoth drainage and agricultural practices are affecting the surface conditions, causing\ntemperatures to be significantly warmer than natural areas.\nImage displays of aircraft thermal scanner data are shown in Figures 3A and 3B. Two dissimilar areas were chosen for study in the Taylor Creek watershed located north of Lake\nOkeechobee, Florida. The first area, shown in Fig. 3A, was primarily improved grass\npastures used for grazing dairy cattle. The second area (Fig. 3B) includes pasture, marsh\nand a large citrus grove. The thermal data of Fig. 3A were obtained at 1222-1225 EST on\nApril 28, 1978. Windspeed was 700 cm/sec, air temperature was 26.1\xc2\xb0C and the relative\nhumidity was 59 percent (dew point 11.1\xc2\xb0C). Thermal data of Fig. 3B were obtained at 14321435 EST on April 26, 1978 and meteorological conditions were similar to those measured on\nApril 28. These surface meteorological measurements were made at a height of 10m. A uniform\ngeneral rain of about 3cm had fallen on the area two days prior to the flights. Soil moisture conditions were good for growth [3].\nU.S. Highway 441 runs N-S through the image in Fig. 3A. To the east of the highway the\neffects of high dairy cattle population density are easily seen. In the irregularlyshaped areas heavy cattle traffic had eliminated plants. A mixture of sand and partially\ndecomposed manure made up the surface cover. The surface temperatures in this area were\ngreater than 42\xc2\xb0C. Similarly, Field 1, which had apparently been cut for hay and then\ngrazed heavily prior to April 28, showed little spring growth and temperatures were in\nexcess of 42\xc2\xb0C. Field 2 of the same species, primarily Pangola (Digitavia decumbeus) had\nbeen cut for hay but had not been grazed. It was in a healthy growing condition and ranged\nfrom 36-42\xc2\xb0C. Field 3 was rather heterogeneous, containing patches of grass interspersed\nwith broadleaved weeds and thinner stands of grass and ranged in temperature from 28-36\xc2\xb0C.\nEvapotranspiration (ET) and heat flux values for Field 1 were 20 and 30 mw/cm2, respectively,\nand for Field 3 with higher ET were 40 and 10 mw/cm2 [3]. Wet areas with woody shrubs as\nthe primary gound cover had the coolest temperatures in the scene with a range of 22-26\xc2\xb0C.\nIn Fig. 3B the marsh vegetation was coolest (about 21-24"C) and the citrus ranged from\n24-28\xc2\xb0C. Pasture 1 was poorly managed and had temperatures from 31-38\xc2\xb0C while Pasture 2\nwas not over-grazed and ranged in temperature from 24-31\xc2\xb0C.\nFig. 4A shows the HCMM thermal infrared data over the northern lower peninsula of Michigan.\nThis imagery is from September 26, 1979. Digital values showed that the agricultural areas\nwere warmest when compared to other areas. Surface radiant temperature for agricultural\nareas average 20\xc2\xb0C while the average radiant temperature for water was 8\xc2\xb0C. The surface\ntemperatures for other surface types fall between these two values. Average temperatures of\nsurface types acquired from this scene are shown in Table 1. The distinct differences in\ntemperatures between the surface types shows the relationship of surface temperature and\nsurface types.\n\nAssessment of Modified Surface Temperatures\n\nTABLE 1\n\n73\n\nAverage Temperature for Different Surface Types as Obtained from HCMM\nData on September 26, 1979 for the Northern Portion of the Lower\nPeninsula of Michigan\n\nSurface Type\n\nAverage Temperature\n\nWater\n\n8\xc2\xb0C\n\nSwamp\n\n15\xc2\xb0C\n\nForest\n\n17\xc2\xb0C\n\nAgricultural Areas\n\n20\xc2\xb0C\n\nFig. 4B is the HCMM reflectance image of the same scene. Again, digital values showed the\ndependency of reflectance to the surface types. Experiments showed that it is even possible\nto verify some vegetation types solely by their reflectance values. In Fig. 4B reflectance\nvalues between .07 and .08 are isolated in black, which show the coniferous areas very well\n(see the areas pointed to by the arrows). This was verified by referencing the Landsat\nclassified image of August 1, 1975 [7], Fig. 4C. This shows that the HCMM satellite reflectance data can be used to characterize this earth surface parameter.\nDISCUSSION\nFrom the analysis of the satellite data, it is clear that man\'s activities have significantly\naltered massive portions of the earth\'s surface. These changes have, in turn, modified the\nplanet\'s boundary temperatures. The change is not only large in area, but also in magnitude.\nFrequently 10-12\xc2\xb0C warmer temperatures were found in agricultural areas when compared to the\nnatural surface (Fig. 3 and 4). These modifications could significantly impact the thermal\nradiation leaving the earth\'s surface and the repartitioning of energy into sensible and\nlatent fluxes.\nFurther, the aircraft thermal data vividly show (Fig. 3A and 3B) that even within the agricultural areas, as vegetation types are changed or overgrazing occurs, there can be further\nsignificant changes in the thermal regimes. These scenes showed overgrazed areas were\ngreater than 42\xc2\xb0C while well-watered nondormant pastures were approximately 30\xc2\xb0C. For these\ntemperature differences to occur, major differences in energy going into evapotranspiration\nmust exist. Thus, the fluxes of vapor and heat are considerably different depending on how\nthe surface is managed. These surface differences will ultimately impact the hydrological\nbalance.\nThe impacts of these changes over the composite area of the Florida peninsula could potentially have significant impacts on local weather. Some evidence of this modification is\nvisible in Fig. 5. Lake Okeechobee, which is a man-made lake, is shown to be modifying the\ncloud pattern over the southern portion of the Florida peninsula in this figure.\nModifications in a more temperate area are clearly shown by the example using HCMM data for\nthe peninsula of Michigan. This analysis also showed that significant changes in reflectance\ncould occur with changes in vegetation. Modifications in this reflectant component could\nhave long term ecological implications since solar radiation is the main driving force for\ntemperature increase, hydrological changes and biological processes.\nCONCLUSION\nModifications of surface temperature and radiation were clearly observable from analysis of\nsatellite data. Both the spatial distribution and magnitude of these changes can potentially\nbe monitored using satellite data. Thus, some preliminary considerations for the habitability\nof areas of the earth can start to be developed. Of greatest concern, however, is that the\npopulation is expected to increase by an additional 50% by the turn of the century, so the\nprocess of change examined in this paper can be expected to accelerate in the years ahead.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n2.\n\nCouncil on Environmental Quality and Department of State.
