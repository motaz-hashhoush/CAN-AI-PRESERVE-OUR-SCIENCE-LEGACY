Our data show two partially blended absorption features near +2 km/s LSR which probably originate in local molecular clouds in the Cygnus rift, approximately 0.7 kpc away. The CO lines are optically thin, with tau(sub CO) = 0.5 +/- 0.1, while tau(sub OH) = 0.030 +/- 0.004. The detected absorption features have a combined velocity width of 3.0 km/s FWHM, greater than the width of the corresponding (12)CO emission features, Full Width of Half Maximum (FWHM) = 2.3 km/s, indicating that the absorbing gas in a approximately 1 AU diameter column shows a greater velocity range than the gas in the 0.2 pc diameter emission beam. CO excitation temperatures T(sub ex), range from 2.7 to 7.0 K across the line profile, implying that the gas along this line of sight is rotationally quite cold. By measuring the (12)CO excitation temperature and optical depth, we derive an abundance ratio, (CO)/(H2), of 6 x 10(exp -6), which is more than an order of magnitude lower than is seen elsewhere. Our low observed CO optical depth is inconsistent with the ratio of (12)CO to (13)CO emission line integrals, 16:1, which implies that the (12)CO is optically thick. As a solution to these anomalies, we propose that the CO absorption and emission arise from preferentially different parts of the molecular medium. Other solutions would require an anomalous (12)CO/(13)CO abundance ratio and an anomalous CO/H2 abundance ratio, or much lower excitation temperatures. Since we find no absorption at negative velocities with tau greater than 0.23 (2.5 sigma), there is no compelling evidence for the existence of an extensive population of cold molecular gas in the outer Galaxy along this line of sight.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "443", "submissionId": 19950052225, "issue": "1", "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "7bf455cb44914f26ad321cfb480d2e4c", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 2 - Letters", "publicationDate": "1995-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
