Based on velocity, ice thickness, and accumulation rate data, the patterns of net mass balance in these regions were calculated. Net mass balance, or the rate of ice thickness change, was calculated as the residual of all mass fluxes into and out of subregions (or boxes). Net mass balance provides a measure of the state of health of the ice sheet and clues to the current dynamics.", "title": "The mass balance of the ice plain of Ice Stream B and Crary Ice Rise", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930022699, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bindschadler, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "e1a8e1a90b28409ead22ed4b648bb861"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930022699, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930022699, "id": "f0b9bdd4a68342bbbc5cbbeaa41d6f73", "publicationName": "The First Annual West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Science Workshop", "publicationDate": "1993-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930022689, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The First Annual West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Science Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
