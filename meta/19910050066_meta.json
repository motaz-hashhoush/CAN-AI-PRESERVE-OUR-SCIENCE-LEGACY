The results show that Na was incorporated into type II chondrule precursors as albite and was not significantly lost during melting. Type I chondrules, which contain very low concentrations of Na, were also not depleted in Na during melting, as indicated by the lack of correlation between the Na/Al ratios and the liquidus temperatures in type I chondrules. It is concluded that the difference in Na concentration is caused by the abundance of precursor albite in type II chondrules, rather than the loss of Na from the melt.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "55", "submissionId": 19910050066, "issn": "0016-7037", "id": "cd511077a4314013bc7da22e02615253", "publicationName": "Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta", "publicationDate": "1991-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
