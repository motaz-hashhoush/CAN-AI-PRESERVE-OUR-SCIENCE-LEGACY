In this paper, we present the first concrete implementation of this framework as a competition called DXC 09. The goal of this competition was to evaluate and compare DAs in a common platform and to determine a winner based on diagnosis results. 12 DAs (model-based and otherwise) competed in this first year of the competition in 3 tracks that included industrial and synthetic systems. Specifically, the participants provided algorithms that communicated with the run-time architecture to receive scenario data and return diagnostic results. These algorithms were run on extended scenario data sets (different from sample set) to compute a set of pre-defined metrics. A ranking scheme based on weighted metrics was used to declare winners. This paper presents the systems used in DXC 09, description of faults and data sets, a listing of participating DAs, the metrics and results computed from running the DAs, and a superficial analysis of the results.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Sweden", "submissionId": 20100024257, "endDate": "2009-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "20th International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis", "location": "Stockholm", "id": "8c920590994e486b8fbf74a379619b0a", "startDate": "2009-06-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100024257, "id": "b591119a1fb547608a7c56b8b97e4f26", "publicationDate": "2009-06-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100024257.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100024257/downloads/20100024257.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100024257/downloads/20100024257.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100024257/downloads/20100024257.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
