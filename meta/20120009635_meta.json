Large local food price increases over a short time period can be indicative of a deteriorating food security situation and may be the consequence of weather-related food production declines, Dr can simply be the result of price transmission from the international commodity market. Food price indices developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are used to monitor food price trends at a global level, but largely reflect supply and demand conditions in export markets far from the places where the chronically food insecure live. A much better understanding of how local staple food prices in isolated regions such as West Africa that grow most of the food they eat to better understand the impact of global commodity market transformations on sensitive communities at the margin. This information will also enable improved strategies for these farmers who are extraordinarily sensitive to climate change impacts on agricultural growing conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120009635, "endDate": "2012-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Initiative on Climate Adaptation Research and understanding through the Social Sciences (ICARUS) 3rd Annual Conference", "location": "New York, NY", "id": "f04e9269b3ac4e78b7af91b4543cc044", "startDate": "2012-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120009635, "id": "e3f905c544e14612b6d0e88c79285131", "publicationDate": "2012-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120009635.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120009635/downloads/20120009635.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120009635/downloads/20120009635.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120009635/downloads/20120009635.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
