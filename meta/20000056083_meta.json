Large apertures include optical, infrared and submillimeter telescopes, \"photon buckets\" for optical communications and \"non-coherent\" imaging, solar concentrators, and radio frequency antennas. Developments in the very large ultra-light structures will be forces on one of their most challenging applications-solar sails. The sail structures will include both 3-axis stabilizing and spinning. Gossamer spacecraft technology will eventually allow NASA to undertake bold new missions of discovery, such as searching for the signs of life on planets orbiting nearby stars and sailing through space on beams of light of places beyond our solar system.", "title": "The Gossamer Initiative", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T18:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000056083, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chmielewski, Artur B."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "3fcf9674908c4db9bd1501eac3040c7c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000056083, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moore, Chris"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA United States"}}, "id": "b016966545a64d1ca90fe6d8bcbf0aa7"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20000056083, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Howard, Rick"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "d89b42df31464fe6b077a34240579126"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000056083, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000056083, "isbn": "0-7803-5846-5", "publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "id": "ecab2df9f4e2479ebe5be9b438e71542", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
