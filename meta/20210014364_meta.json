Originally developed for the BioSentinel CubeSat mission to study the response of a wild type and mutant strain of yeast to the deep space environment, the BioSensor consists of a series of 16-well, independently plumbed fluidics cards. The cards utilize filters to allow the fluidic system to administer reagents while constraining the microbes in their wells. Heaters on each card incubate to the appropriate growth temperature once the experiment begins. During the active experiment, the LED/detector system measures the transmission of light through each well at three specific wavelengths, similar to a standard benchtop spectrophotometer. The transmission/absorbance kinetics curves for each well are telemetered back to Earth, along with temperature data, for analysis on the ground. The BioSensor is being upgraded from its original CubeSat free-flyer interface to be a secondary payload on lunar landers, Gateway, and other BLEO applications, while maintaining the same functionality and science utility for future experiments.", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210014364, "id": "7309fef227fb4b84bec9303e090684c2", "publicationDate": "2021-04-30T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "BioSensor Users Guide 04-23-21.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210014364/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2004-23-21.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210014364/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2004-23-21.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210014364/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2004-23-21.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
