When heavy load conditions are encountered, hydrocarbon fuel may be mixed with the hydrogen rich gases and air and the mixture is then injected\ninto the remaining cylinders as fuel.\n\nPratt ............................\n123/59 EC X\nEdelbrock ............\n123/59 PC\n\n5 Claims, 4 Drawing Figures\n\nENRICHMENT\nCONTROL\n\nAIR\nGASOLINE\n\n-\n\n4,041,910\nAug. 16, 1977\n\nsf\n\n32\nI\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 16,1977\n\nSheet 1 of 4\n\n4,04 1,910\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 16, 19-77\n\nSheet 2 of 4\n\n5\n\n3\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nC\n\nc\n\n4\n\n4,04 1,910\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 16,1977\n\n4,04 1,910\n\nSheet 3 of 4\n\nI\n\n1\n\nn\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\ns\n\nII\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 16, 1977\n\nSheet 4 of 4\n\nt\n3\ni\n\n0\n\n?-\n\n4,04 1,910\n\nI\n\n1\n\n4,041,910\n\n2\n\nvery rapidly and provides a very violent reaction which\nCOMBUSTION ENGINE\nis extremely explosive and almost impossible to control.\nFurthermore, according to the patent, for mixing air\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\nwith the decomposed products of hydrazine, a high\nThe invention described herein was made in the per- 5 pressure source of air is required.
