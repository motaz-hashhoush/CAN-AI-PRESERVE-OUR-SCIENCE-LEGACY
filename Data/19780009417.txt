Fitzmaurice\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, Maryland\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SCOPE\nThe development of laser ranging systems within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) started in the early 1960\'s, soon after the invention of the laser. This\nprogram has grown substantially in the intervening years, and has produced important results\nin the areas of precision-orbit determination and gravity-field determination. In addition,\nlaser ranging is expected in the near future to produce some unique results on crustal motions\nof the Earth. These results may be very important for understanding the mechanisms which\ncause earthquakes.\nThis document presents an overview of the NASA laser, ranging program. The discussion\ncovers the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nApplications and system evolution (1962-1976)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCurrent state of the art\n\xe2\x80\x94 Performance\n\xe2\x80\x94 Hardware\n\xe2\x80\x94 Error sources\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlans for Shuttle-based laser ranging systems\n\nThe principal applications that these systems address are outlined, and the characteristics\nof typical systems built during the 1960\'s and early 1970\'s are described. The current state\nof the art, as exemplified by some of the more recent ranging systems, is also discussed with\nrespect to performance levels and to error sources which limit this performance. The final\nsection discusses NASA plans for using laser ranging systems aboard the Space Shuttle.\n\n*Presented as an invited paper at the Conference on Laser Engineering and Applications (CLEA) in Washington, D.C.,\nJune 1-3, 1977.\n\nAPPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM EVOLUTION\n\nIn principle, many types of laser systems could be used for ranging to satellites. The type\ndiscussed here, which is the most widely used approach, is shown functionally in figure 1.\n\nREFLECTED /\nPULSE /\n\n/\nTRACKING TELESCOPE\nAND DETECTOR\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2fi A\nr\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni\n\nSHAFT-ANGLE\nREAD-OUT\nSYSTEM\n\n?/-\n\nL\n\nSATELLITE\nOPTICAL\nREFLECTOR\n\n/ TRANSMITTED\nPULSE\n\nLASER TRAN SMITTER\n\nTRANSMITTED\nPULSE\n\nci,\nR ECEIVED PULSE\n\nRANGE\nREAD-OUT\nSYSTEM\n\nFigure 1. Laser satellite tracking experiment.\n\nA pulsed laser transmitter and receiver are boresighted and mounted on a two-axis gimbal\nsystem. The pointing direction is read out by shaft encoders, and the pointing direction is\ncontrolled either manually or by a computer using orbit predictions. A portion of the outgoing pulse is picked off and used to start a time-interval unit. Because the satellite is\nequipped with optical cube corners on its Earth-viewing side, the incident pulse is reflected\nback on itself and is detected at the receiver. This received pulse terminates the timeinterval measurement. The time of flight is stored, and the entire process is repeated at a\n1-pps rate.\nThis type of system has been applied to several measurement problems; some of the more\nimportant are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOrbit determination\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPolar motion\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGravity field studies\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEarth tides\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTectonic-plate motion\n\nBy using the accurate range measurements and information on the orbit plane, which can be\nobtained from the shaft encoders or the coarse orbit predictions, the orbit can be determined\nto meter accuracy. The orbit will change with time because of the various forces that act\non the spacecraft; the largest of these forces is the gravity field. By measuring orbit changes\nwith time, the magnitude of the various spatial frequencies in the geopotential field can be\nevaluated (Reference 1).\nIt is generally accepted that the Earth\'s polar axis changes position very slowly, about 1/5\xc2\xb0\nper million years. In addition, short-term variations occur in pole position that are believed\nto be correlated with earthquakes (Reference 2), and it is these motions that a.satellite laser\nranging system can monitor. The basic measurement is to determine any shifts in the apparent\norbital inclination of the satellite (Reference 3). Because the true orbit inclination in inertial\nspace is very well determined, a short-term anomalous shift can be attributed to a shift in\nthe latitude of the ground station, which is, in effect, caused by a shift in the location of\nEarth\'s polar axis.\nIn addition to the ocean tides, there are significant but poorly understood solid Earth tides\n(Reference 4). These deformations affect the "G" field that an orbiting satellite sees, and,\nby measuring the resulting orbit perturbations, the magnitude of the Earth tide can be\ninferred, and the elastic properties of the Earth\'s interior can be estimated. This is potentially important for resources assessment, such as the locating of mineral and oil deposits.\nWithin the geophysics community, it is now generally accepted that the surface of the Earth\nis composed of about a dozen or more plates that are essentially floating on a fluid-like core.\nThe boundaries of these plates are known to be relatively high-risk earthquake regions, but\nthe actual magnitude of the risk depends on the differential motion of adjoining plates.\nSuch differential motions are now being measured for the first time by laser ranging systems,\nand this particular application (tectonic-plate motion) is currently the single most important\nuse of satellite laser ranging. The focus for this activity is the San Andreas Fault Experiment\n(SAFE) (Reference 5). The details of this experiment will be discussed in the following\nsection.\nThe first satellite laser ranging took place in 1964 (Reference 6) with the hardware shown\nin figure 2. The laser transmitter and the receiver were mounted on a platform inside the\ntwo axes of this Nike-Ajax mount. Acquisition was accomplished by using orbital predictions from the Minitrack network; the satellite was then tracked visually by two operators who controlled the azimuth and elevation axes. Tracking was possible only at night\nduring that portion of the pass in which the Sun illuminated the satellite. The laser was a\nmechanically Q-switched ruby that supplied about 800 mJ into a 1.2-mr beamwidth. The\nreceiver phototube was mounted at the prime focus of the 16-inch telescope, and the start\nand stop signals were cabled to instrumentation below the platform.\n\n(a)\n\nTransmitting laser and receiving telescope mounted on a modified NikeAjax radar pedestal\n\n(b)\n\nBeacon Explorer-B Satellite with\narray of cube-corner reflectors\n\nFigure 2. Satellite laser ranging (1964).\n\nThe satellite was called Beacon Explorer-B, although its formal name was Explorer-22. It\nwas magnetically stabilized with its north-seeking end studded with optical cube corners.\nThe satellite was inserted into a 980-km near-polar orbit in October 1964, and, within 3\nweeks, it was being tracked by this system. Laser tracking was possible only in the northern\nhemisphere because of the satellite\'s magnetic stabilization.\nBecause of the high tangential velocity between the ground station and the target, the signal\nreflected from the satellite does not come precisely back to the ground station, but instead\nis offset angularly by about 10 arc-seconds. Therefore, if the cube corners produced a\ndiffraction-limited return beam, the footprint of the return signal would not cover the ground\nstation. To accommodate this effect (called the velocity abberation or Bradley effect), the\ncube corners were designed to produce a 20-arc-second reflected beamwidth.\nAlthough 13 years old, this particular satellite continues to serve as an excellent target for\nlaser ranging systems.\nAfter about 1 year of tracking from this station, it became obvious that the usefulness of\nthis system would be much improved if it were mobile. Figure 3 shows the concept that\nevolved.\nThe pointing system is now an integral part of a trailer that can be towed by a standard\ntractor. The laser is no longer mounted on the pointing platform but is now located on a\nfixed optical bench within the trailer. The output beam is directed up to the pointing platform by a series of flat mirrors, is collimated by a small telescope, and is transmitted to the\nsatellite. This approach has several advantages: It simplifies the thermal and electrical\ninterface to the laser because it is no longer necessary for liquid cooling loops and electrical\npower cabling to cross the gimbals, and it increases the stability and reliability of the laser\nbecause it operates in a temperature-controlled and stationary environment.\nAfter being set up on a concrete pad, the mount and laser bench are isolated from the trailer\nstructure and are supported directly from the pad by attaching legs. The receiver is mounted\nat the prime focus of the large telescope.\nIn this first-generation system, all the instrumentation for the operation is located in a single\nvan, including the laser system, the receiver electronics, the computer, and the control\nelectronics for the mount and the data storage system. In follow-on systems, the receiver and\ncomputer systems were put in a separate van to reduce radio frequency (RF) interference\nproblems associated with laser firing and to simply provide more space.\nAn RF radar is also required for safety purposes. The laser system is shut down when an aircraft is detected within 20\xc2\xb0 of the laser-pointing direction. A minimum of three people are\nneeded during satellite tracking: a safety observer, a mount operator, and a console operator.\nFigure 4 shows the Moblas-II system that was built at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)\nin the late 1960\'s. The mount is equipped with 22 bit encoders. A ruby laser that operates\n\nMOBILE LASER RANGING STATION\n\nFigure 3. Mobile laser ranging station.\n\nin the cavity dump mode is located in the van and produces a 5-ns pulse with about 1/4 joule\nof energy. The beam enters the base of the mount and is directed up through the light pipe\nand then out through a 5-power collimator. The exiting beam divergence is about 40 arcseconds. Experience has shown that it normally takes about 2 weeks on site to complete the\nsetup and to start satellite tracking. At the end of the tracking period, which is typically a\ncouple of months, it takes about 1 week to disassemble the system for moving to the next\nlocation.\nThe Moblas-III laser system was built at GSFC in 1976. This system has two vans: one for\nthe laser and pointing system (shown in figure 5) and one van for the computer and receiver\nsignal processor. As in Moblas-II, the laser is at a fixed-coudk focus but, in this case, is transmitted through a 20-cm collimating telescope.\nFigure 6 shows the signal flow for a typical ranging system. A time standard with a 1-pps\noutput signal furnishes the trigger for the laser. About 1 millisecond or so later, the laser\npulse exits the transmitter. A small portion of this pulse is picked off by a photodiode and\nput into a threshold detector. The output of this unit starts the time-of-flight measurement.\n\nFigure 4. Moblas-lI system.\n\nThis output also permits measurement of the elapsed time between the laser trigger pulse\nand the actual time at which emission occurs. The transmitted waveform is also recorded so\nthat the amplitude-dependent time-walk in the threshold detector can be accounted for.\nThe return signal from the satellite is detected by a photomultiplier. The output of this tube\nis leading-edge detected and is used to stop the time-interval unit. This discriminated signal\nis also used to trigger a waveform digitizer that stores the received pulse shape. The range\ntime-interval unit then supplies the coarse time-of-flight information, and the two waveforms\n(transmitted and received) are analyzed to obtain the vernier correction.\nThe data input to the computer then includes the time-interval unit value, the two waveforms,\nand the time of day at which the measurement was made. When two or more ground stations\nare acquiring data on the same satellite, their respective clocks must be synchronized to 5 us\nor better.\n\nFigure 5. Moblas-l 11 laser system.\n\nCURRENT STATE OF THE ART\n\nFigure 7 summarizes the performance improvement of satellite laser ranging systems over\nthe last 12 to 13 years. As previously mentioned, the first tracking occurred in October 1964.\nThis was a nighttime operation only because the orbital predictions were not accurate enough\nto permit open-loop pointing with milliradian beamwidths. As the laser data came in, both\norbits and gravity-field models were refined, and, by 1968, it was possible to track both day\nand night.\nThe initial precision connected with the orbit determination was a few meters. The bottom\ncurve (figure 7) represents the best system performance, whereas the upper curve is more\nof an average or typical value. The precision increased dramatically in the late 1960\'s and\nearly 1970\'s because of improvements in transmitters, receivers, and signal processing.\n\nTRANSMITTED\nLIGHT PULSE\n\nTIME\n(\nSTANDARD\n\n1*\nPHOTODIODE\n\nEPOCH Tl\nT.I.U.\n\ni\n1*1\n\nSTOP\nIs\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nRANGE TIME INTERVAL UNIT\n\nWAVEFORM\nDIGITIZER\n\nSTART\nSTOP\n\nTHRESHOLD DETECTOR\n& TRIGGER GENERATOR\nTHRESHOLD DETECTOR\n& TRIGGER GENERATOR\n\nPHOTOMULTIPLIER\nRECEIVER\n\nRECEIVED\nLIGHT PULSE\n\nFigure 6. Laser ranging system.\n\nThe early transmitters were mechanically Q-switched lasers with pulse widths of about 25\nto 50 ns. In the early 1970\'s, these were upgraded with electro-optic Q-switches and external\npulse slicers to achieve 5 to 10 ns. Most of the systems are now operating with cavity-dump\nlasers that provide a 4- to 5-ns pulse width.\nThe early receivers used leading-edge detection; that is, a fixed-threshold detector. Later,\nthe amplitude of the return pulse was recorded and used to correct the time-walk characteristics of the discriminator. The entire received waveform is now recorded, and centroid or\ncross-correlation detection is used to establish time of arrival.\nThe launch dates for the various satellites that have laser reflectors are shown at the bottom\nof figure 7. The first, Explorer-22, was launched in October 1964, and the last Laser Geodetic Earth-Orbiting Satellite (LAGEOS), was launched in May 1976. Two more satellites\nare scheduled for launch in 1977 and 1978.\nTable 1 lists the various laser ranging satellites that are now in orbit. They are listed chronologically according to launch date. There are currently seven U.S. satellites and four French;\ntwo more are planned for 1977 and 1978. In general, these satellites carry several instruments; the laser reflectors are merely one of the instruments. The exceptions are Lageos and\nStarlette, which are devoted exclusively to laser ranging.\nThe altitude of most of the satellites is 1000 km, except for NTS-I (a Naval Research Laboratory mission) and Lageos, which are significantly higher. Although the low orbits make the\nradar link less difficult, they reduce the visibility time per pass and, in addition, cause problems\nin data analysis because the errors in gravity-field models and atmospheric-drag models are\ngreater for low orbits.\n\n10m\n\n1st TRACKING\n1st DAYLIGHT TRACKING\n\n1m\nO\nCO\nO\nLU\n\ntr.\no.\n10cm\n\nLASER RANGING SATELLITES\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\n\'\n\n\xc2\xa9\n1 cm\n1964\n\n66\n\n68\n\n70\n\n72\n\n74\n\n76\n\n78\n\n80\n\nYEAR\nFigure 7. Evolution of satellite laser\nranging system performance.\n\nThe optical-radar cross section (table 1) is listed in millions of square meters. These numbers\nappear to be extremely large because of the very small divergence on the reflected beam.\nTypically, a 1-inch near-diffraction limited cube comer has a cross section of about 1 million\nsquare meters.\nThe cross section and range enter the radar equation in this way (a/R 4 ); this ratio therefore\ngives a quick indication of the level of difficulty in tracking the various satellites. These values\nare tabulated for the zenith condition and for the more typical 45\xc2\xb0 elevation case. The ratio\nspans four orders of magnitude. Because most systems are designed to be able to track Lageos,\nthey will operate with a very high average photoelectron level for most of the other satellites.\n\n10\n\nTable 1\nLaser Ranging Satellites\nSatellite\n\nAltitude\nm X 106\n\nZenith Cross Section\nm2 X 106\n\nCross Section ^ (Slant Range)4\nZenith\n\n45\xc2\xb0\n\nExplorer-22 (US) BE-B\n\n0.98\n\n5.4\n\n5.4\n\n1.8\n\nExplorer-27 (US) BE-C\n\n1.1\n\n5.0\n\n3.2\n\n0.99\n\nExplorer-29 (US) GEOS-1\n\n1.7\n\n57.0\n\n6.8\n\n0.24\n\nDiadem-I (FR)\n\n0.94\n\n3.8\n\n4.9\n\n1.3\n\nDiadem-II(FR)\n\n1.2\n\n3.8\n\n1.7\n\n0.58\n\nExplorer-36 (US) GEOS-II\n\n1.3\n\n100.0\n\n32.0\n\n1.2\n\nPeole (FR)\n\n0.60\n\n6.2\n\n4.2\n\n0.0030\n\n0.0011\n\nNTS-1 (US)\n\n14.0\n\n0.80\n103.0\n\nStarlett (FR)*\n\n0.96\n\n0.65\n\n0.76\n\n0.22\n\nGEOS-III (US)\n\n0.90\n\n1.9\n\n2.9\n\n18.00\n\nLageos (US)*\n\n5.9\n\n7.0\n\n0.0057\n\n0.0018\n\nNTS-II (US)\n\n20.0\n\n252.0\n\n0.0015\n\n0.00064\n\n7.3\n\n6.8\n\nSeasat-A (US)\n\n0.85\n\n3.8\n\n\'Dedicated.\n\nTable 2 lists the stations that make up the NASA laser tracking network. Three are mobile\nstations and five are fixed location stations. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\n(SAO) operates four stations for NASA. Five more mobile stations are being built and will\nbegin to become operational in 1978.\nThe stationary laser (Stalas) is a frequency-doubled Nd: YAG; the other systems use ruby\nlasers and amplifiers. The new mobile systems will use frequency-doubled Nd: YAG. The\nreceiver apertures are from 0.41 m (16 inches) up to 0.76 m (30 inches). At least two figures\nof merit can be used to describe a laser ranging system; the first, MT, defined as E D2 / 0 2 ,\nscales the number of photoelectrons received per pulse and is therefore a key parameter in\ndetermining target-miss probability. The second, Mr, as defined as MT1/2 /pulse width, is\ndirectly proportional to the accuracy with which the arrival time of a low-level optical pulse\ncan be estimated. These calculations indicate that Stalas should have the highest performance\ncapabilities, and comparison of satellite tracking data indicates that this is, in fact, the case.\n\n11\n\nTable 2\nLaser Ranging Stations\nMT*\nJ-m 2 X 106\n\nMRf\nJ 1 / 2 -m/sX 1011\n\nLocation\n\nEt\n(Joules)\n\nD\n(Meters)\n\nMoblas-I\n\nMobile\n\n1.0\n\n0.41\n\n4.2\n\n4.1\n\nMoblas-II\n\nMobile\n\n0.25\n\n0.51\n\n1.6\n\n2.5\n\nMoblas-III\n\nMobile\n\n1.0\n\n0.51\n\n6.5\n\n5.1\n\nStalas\n\nMaryland\n\n0.25\n\n0.51\n\n6.5\n\n51.0\n\nSAO-I\n\nBrazil\n\n6.0\n\n0.51\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nSAO-II\n\nPeru\n\n6.0\n\n0.51\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nSAO-III\n\nAustralia\n\n6.0\n\n0.51\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nSAO-IV\n\nArizona\n\n6.0\n\n0.51\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\nMoblas-IV,\n-V, -VI, -VII,\nand -VIII\n\nMobile\n\n0.25\n\n0.76\n\nStation\n\n14.0\n\n7.5\n\n"Tracking figure of merit, MT = E t D r 2 /0 ( 2 .\n-(\xe2\x80\xa2Ranging figure of merit, MR = (M_) /pulse width.\n\nA number of factors limit the performance of the current systems.

This effect amounts to about 2.5 meters at\nzenith and approaches 10 meters at 10\xc2\xb0 elevation. Several models have been developed for\npredicting the atmospheric corrections. The Marini/Murray algorithm (Reference 7) is used\nin the GSFC systems. This model was recently checked by Gardner at the University of\nIllinois, using sets of simultaneous radiosonde data (Reference 8), and it appears to be accurate to approximately 1 cm at elevation angles down to 20\xc2\xb0. As input, the model requires\nthe pressure, temperature, and relative humidity at the ground station. The accuracies of\nthese meterological inputs are important, particularly the pressure data. The error sensitivities\nare listed with the error sources given previously. The pressure input is the most critical.\nA calculation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the arrival time of an optical pulse\nshows that the standard deviation varies as (pulse width) X (average photoelectrons per\npulse)"\'/2 (Reference 9). For pulse widths in excess of a few nanoseconds, this becomes an\nimportant consideration. Typically, if ranging is performed with a 5-ns pulse (full width at\nhalf-maximum (FWHM)) and 5-cm precision is desired, an average signal level of about 6\nphotoelectrons per pulse is required. This is the theoretical limit; a more reasonable operating\nlevel would be about two to three times this amount.\nThe electron multiplier in the photomultiplier introduces timing noise caused by the varying\ntransit times that electrons experience as they travel from photocathode to anode. The best\nelectrostatic tubes have a transit-time jitter of about 300 ps for single photoelectrons (Reference 10). This is significant because it maps into a 4.5-cm ranging error. Some recent\nmeasurements on static crossed-field photomultiplier tubes indicate that their jitter is about\nan order of magnitude less than this (Reference 11); this problem should therefore become\nless important in the future.\nAnother error source is the time-interval measurement. The question is simply this: How\naccurately can the time interval between a pair of pulses that have a nominal separation of\n5 to 10 milliseconds be measured? The best commercial units have about 100-ps accuracy,\nwhich maps into a 1.5-cm ranging error (Reference 12). A unit recently developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories has a measured accuracy of about 10 ps (Reference 13), so that\nthis error source should also become less important in the future.\nThe satellite itself is another important error source. There are two noise mechanisms at\nwork in this case (Reference 14). First, because several cube corners contribute to the return\nsignal, coherent fading occurs in the far field at the receiver. The return pulse is broadened,\nbut, more importantly, it is distorted in a random fashion. Another noise source is called\nthe center-of-gravity correction. When ranging to a satellite, it is desired to measure the\n\n13\n\nrange from the ground station to the center of gravity of the satellite because it is the satellite center of gravity whose path can be predicted as it travels through the gravity field.\nBecause actual measurement is to cube-corners on the surface of the satellite, some correction\nmust be applied to this related to the center of gravity. The last satellite that was launched,\nLageos, was designed specifically to minimize both these noise sources.\nFigure 8 shows Lageos during prelaunch testing at GSFC. It is a small heavy sphere (411 kg,\n60-cm diameter) and is studded with 426 optical-cube corners. Serving as a laser ranging\ntarget, this satellite introduces very little pulse-spreading because only reflectors that are\naligned with the incident pulse to about \xc2\xb1 10\xc2\xb0 participate in the return signal. For any\norientation, only about eight to ten reflectors contribute significantly to the return.\nFigure 9 shows both the results of the prelaunch testing and the test laboratory (Reference\n15). The average pulse-spreading was about 125 ps; the effective reflection surface is about\n5 cm beneath the skin of the satellite, but, more important\'.y, the radius of the reflection\nsurface varies with attitude by only about 2 mm.\n\nFigure 8.\n\n14\n\nLageos during prelaunch testing at GSFC.\n\nFigure 9.\n\nLageos test laboratory.\n\nLageos was launched in May 1976 from the Western Test Range and was tracked shortly\nthereafter by SAO ground stations and the GSFC Stalas system. One of the more successful\nStalas tracks is shown in figure 10. The satellite was acquired by Stalas at an elevation angle\nof about 54\xc2\xb0 and was tracked continuously for about 30 minutes down to an elevation angle\nof about 23\xc2\xb0. The data for this pass are summarized in figure 11.\nThe ranging system operated at a 1-pps rate so that, in 30 minutes, about 1800 pulses were\ntransmitted. Of these, 805 returns were strong enough to exceed the preset receiver threshold\nlevel. These ranging measurements were adjusted for atmospheric refractivity using the\nMarini-Murray algorithm, and a best-fit orbit was generated for the pass using a high-order\npolynomial. The residuals (i.e., the difference between the measurements and the best fit\norbit) are plotted in figure 11. The root-mean-square value of the residuals is 4.5 cm.\nThese data are representative of the state of the art in satellite laser ranging today. Unfortunately, this particular data set is not typical, but it should be regarded as one of the better\ndata sets. However, it is typical of the achievement expected as the ground stations are upgraded.\n\n15\n\nFigure 10.\n\nLageos tracked by GSFC, June 27, 1976.\n\nThis capability for measuring ground-to-satellite distances to an accuracy of a few centimeters\nhas been used to study several geophysical phenomena, as discussed in the section on\n"Applications and System Evolution," but the most exciting application at this time is the\nmeasurement of tectonic-plate motions. In most cases, the boundaries of these plates are\nwell defined, and the plates are moving at rates of about 1 to 10 cm per year with respect to\none another.\n\n16\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\n0.00\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.50\n0.00\n\n10.00\n\n20.00\n\n30.00\n\n40.00\n\nTIME (minutes from start of pass)\n\nFigure 11. Stalas range residuals versus time for Lageos.\n\nBecause comparison of a map of earthquake occurrences with a map that outlines plate\nboundaries shows a very high correlation, it is clear that areas close to plate boundaries are\npotentially high-risk areas for earthquakes. The magnitude of the risk for a particular area\ndepends on the rates at which the plates are moving with respect to one another and on\nwhether the local plate boundaries are slipping smoothly or locked together. Up to this time,\nthere has been no direct measurement of plate motion; the only measurements are based on\npaleomagnetic results that have an averaging time of about 50 million years.\nThe San Andreas Fault Experiment (SAFE), now in the middle of a 10-year experiment to\nmake the first relatively short-term plate motion measurements, is outlined in figure 12. The\nSan Andreas Fault separates the Pacific and American Plates. These plates are thought to be\nmoving with respect to one another as shown in the slide. Laser ground stations have been\nlocated at San Diego and Quincy, California, and Bear Lake, Utah, and are eventually planned\nfor two locations in Mexico.\nThe laser stations range to a satellite as it passes over and use the data to both define the orbit and determine their relative locations. Independent baseline determinations will be made\nevery 2 years, with changes in these baselines indicating what the plate motion rates are.\nThe experiment began in 1972 when Quincy and San Diego were occupied for about 2 months.\nIt was repeated in 1974 at the same locations and repeated in 1976 with Bear Lake included.\nAll three locations will be occupied again in 1978.\n\n17\n\n110\nI\n\n120\n\nBEAR LAKE\n40\n\n40\n\nAMERICAN\nPLATE\n35\n\n35\n\nSAN ANDREAS\nFAULT\nSAN DIEGO\n\n30\n\nPACIFIC PLATE\n\n30\n\n~ 6.8 cm/yrl\n\n25\n\n25\n\nLA PAZ\nMAZATLAN\n\n120\n\n110\n\nFigure 12.

The results of these\nsimulations indicate that the baselines should be recoverable to 2 cm by 1980. The baselines\ndetermined from the laser measurements are at the bottom of the chart for the 1972 and\n1974 data. The baselines differ by 9 cm, but, because of the 10- and 7-cm noise levels, it is\ntoo early to draw conclusions. It does appear, however, that results comparable to those\npredicted by the simulations will be achieved by 1980.\nPLANS FOR SHUTTLE-BASED LASER RANGING SYSTEMS\n\nIn addition to measuring the macroscopic aspect of tectonic-plate motion, there is clear\nneed for measuring crustal deformations on a much smaller spatial scale so that earthquake\n18\n\nprecursors such as dilatency can be detected. To cover an area such as California, several\nhundred (perhaps thousands) ground points must be repetitively surveyed.\nThe mobile laser ranging stations described earlier can be relocated at a maximum of about\n5 to 10 different points per year. Therefore, even if a dozen or more of these stations were\navailable, it is doubtful that they could cover the needed number of ground points.\nAs an alternate approach to this problem, it was suggested some time ago that the laser\nranging system be turned "upside down" (Reference 17). In this case, a single laser transmitter/receiver is installed on a spaceborne platform, and low-cost passive ground targets are\nlocated at all points of interest. This approach, which has been under development at GSFC\nfor several years, is shown conceptually in figure 13 in which the spaceborne platform is provided by the Space Shuttle (References 18 and 19). The laser is pointed at a particular target\nfor a short period of time and obtains range measurements. The laser is then pointed to adjacent targets in a sequential manner and obtains range measurements to each. These measurements are used: (1) to define the Shuttle orbit during the measuring period, and (2) using\ntrilateration, to measure the relative positions of the ground targets.\nFigure 14 shows the operational scenario. The laser system initiates the measurement sequence\nwhen it is at a 20\xc2\xb0 elevation (as seen from the first ground target). The system transmits at\na 10-pps rate for about 2.5 seconds, thereby obtaining 25 range measurements. The laser is\nthen pointed to the next target and repeats the sequence. To provide a strong geometrical\nsolution it is planned to survey the entire grid three times during a single Shuttle pass.\nThe first map will be at low elevation angles at the beginning of the pass, the second map,\nat high elevation angles (near zenith), and the final map, at low elevation angles near the end\nof the pass. The current plan is to fly this system on a series of Shuttle flights in the 1981 \xe2\x80\x94\n1983 time frame. The purpose of these flights is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate and validate\nthe measurement technique, and (2) to obtain the first broad-coverage strain-accumulation\ndata for the Southern California area.\nFigure 15 shows the planned ground network, which includes a total of 42 ground targets\nspaced at intervals that vary from 25 to 100 km. This network contains a ground-truth area\nconsisting of a cluster of targets spaced at 25-km intervals. These particular targets will be\nsurveyed-in before the first flight using first-order techniques to permit a determination of\ntheir relative location to about 2 cm. These data will be compared to the laser-derived data\nafter the first mission to establish the validity of the space-based technique.\nA total of five Shuttle missions are planned. On each mission, the relative locations of all\ntargets in the network will be established with a precision of a few centimeters. Subsequent\nflights will remeasure the grid since changes in the relative positions are expected because of\ncrustal motions. These changes in relative position produce a strain-accumulation pattern,\nand the accompanying stress pattern will permit an assessment of the earthquake risk level\nthroughout the region. Such measurements are not possible with ground-based instrumentation because of line-of-sight limitations.\n\n19\n\nFigure 13.

In this case, the ground network consisted of only five targets. Results of more recent simulations using the full complement of\n42 targets are essentially the same.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that the deployment of a laser ranging system on a space platform\noffers the opportunity to perform a unique set of measurements that may be very important\nto the development of predictive models for earthquakes. There is a very strong interest\nwithin NASA for the development and flight testing of a prototype system for this purpose.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe work summarized in this document was performed by a large number of groups from\nindustry, academia, and government over the last 17 years.
