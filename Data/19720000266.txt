The demonstration was performed to\nexperimentally assess the potential advantages in the\nprocessing of materials in space, and specifically, to\ndetermine the effects of the lack of density segregation\nand heat convection in the weightless environment of\nspace.\nIn the initial phase of the project, organic and inorganic materials were screened for suitability as simulants for metal matrix and immiscible liquid composites.\nLaboratory tests were conducted to determine solidification behavior, wetting, chemical compatibility, and\nflammability characteristics. Materials screened included\ninorganic salt hydrates, salt eutectics, fluorocarbons,\norganic phosphates and silicates, and low-melting organics. Fibers, whiskers and particles of metals, carbon, and\ninorganics were considered for reinforcing materials.\nA series of 18 samples, representing four experiment\ncategories, were selected for the demonstration, and 11\nof the 18 were actually processed in space. Several of the\nsamples were melted and resolidified without intentional\nagitation to permit evaluation of particle redistribution.\nThe rest of the samples were manually agitated to\nachieve a reasonable mixture of particles and/or gas\nbubbles in the liquid-phase base material. The four\ncategories represent composite structures which cannot\npresently be made on earth due to density segregation\nand convection effects caused by gravitational forces.\nThey include (1) particle dispersion in metal matrix or\nmodel matrix, (2) gas and particle dispersion, (3)\nimmiscible dispersions, and (4) solidification of metal\nmatrix and free casting.\n\nIn the second phase of the demonstration, a postflight examination and evaluation of the processed samples was conducted, including a comparison of the\nsamples with earth processed control samples. The examination consisted of initial characterization, metallographic study by optical and electron microscopy, chemical\nanalysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and pore size and\nvolume distribution measurements. Laboratory tests\nwere conducted to confirm selected observations and to\nmake recommendations for performing subsequent composite casting experiments in space.\nIn comparing the flight and control samples, observation of the macrostructure and microstructure indicate\nthat solidification in both flight and control samples was\nnot unidirectional, a problem that can be solved in the\nexperimental design and procedure. Even without directional solidification, several interesting differences\nwere noted between flight and control samples. Apparent\nintermittent contact of the melt with the container in\nthe flight samples led to unusual nucleation and growth\nstructures. There was a greater uniformity, on a macro\nscale, of both pores and structural features in the flight\nsample, presumably the result of the reduced gravity\nconditions. Although the spheres and whiskers did not\nwet the matrix adequately, the flight experiment clearly\ndemonstrated that it is feasible to produce enhanced\ndispersions of gases and dense phases in a melt that is\nsolidified in reduced gravity. The use of whiskers appears\nto enhance the retention and uniform distribution of\ngas bubbles. 'The analyses of the flight and control\nsamples suggest several modifications or new approaches\nfor future experiments.\n\n(continued overleaf)\nThisdocumentwas prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
