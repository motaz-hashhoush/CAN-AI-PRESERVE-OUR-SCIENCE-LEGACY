With 16 years of NASA experience, the technician teamed up with another NASA colleague and formed PROSystems, Inc., of Sharpsburg, Maryland, to provide the optics community with an alternative source for precision hollow retroreflectors. The company's hollow retroreflectors are front surface glass substrates assembled to provide many advantages over existing hollow retroreflectors and solid glass retroreflectors. Previous to this new technology, some companies chose not to use hollow retroreflectors due to large seam widths and loss of signal. The \"tongue and groove\" facet design of PROSystems's retroreflector allows for an extremely small seam width of .001 inches. Feedback from users is very positive regarding this characteristic. Most of PROSystems's primary customers mount the hollow retroreflectors in chrome steel balls for laser tracker targets in applications such as automobile manufacturing and spacecraft assembly.", "title": "Hollow Retroreflectors Offer Solid Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020062212, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020062212, "id": "ad4130f554eb4be48bf5d5be0bf598b9", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2001: Special Millennium Feature", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020062212.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020062212/downloads/20020062212.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020062212/downloads/20020062212.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020062212/downloads/20020062212.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
