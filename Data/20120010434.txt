b'Security Data Warehouse Application\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Security Data Warehouse (SDW)\nis used to aggregate and correlate all JSC\nIT security data. This includes IT asset\ninventory such as operating systems and\npatch levels, users, user logins, remote\naccess dial-in and VPN, and vulnerability\ntracking and reporting. The correlation\nof this data allows for an integrated understanding of current security issues\nand systems by providing this data in a\nformat that associates it to an individual\nhost. The cornerstone of the SDW is its\nunique host-mapping algorithm that has\nundergone extensive field tests, and provides a high degree of accuracy.\nThe algorithm comprises two parts.\nThe first part employs fuzzy logic to derive a best-guess host assignment using\nincomplete sensor data. The second\npart is logic to identify and correct errors in the database, based on subse-\n\nquent, more complete data. Host\nrecords are automatically split or\nmerged, as appropriate.\nThe process had to be refined and\nthoroughly tested before the SDW deployment was feasible. Complexity was\nincreased by adding the dimension of\ntime. The SDW correlates all data with\nits relationship to time. This lends support to forensic investigations, audits,\nand overall situational awareness.\nAnother important feature of the\nSDW architecture is that all of the underlying complexities of the data\nmodel and host-mapping algorithm are\nencapsulated in an easy-to-use and understandable Perl language Appli cation Programming Interface (API).\nThis allows the SDW to be quickly augmented with additional sensors using\nminimal coding and testing. It also sup-\n\nports rapid generation of ad hoc reports and integration with other information systems.\nThis work was done by Lynn R.

Lasers for such missions must be\nhighly efficient and stable over long periods in the temperature variations of\norbit. In this innovation, LabVIEW is\nused on an Apple Macintosh to acquire\nand analyze images of the laser beam as\nit exits the laser cavity to evaluate the\nlaser\xe2\x80\x99s performance over time, and to\nmonitor and control the environmental\nconditions under which the laser is\ntested. One computer attached to multiple cameras and instruments running\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nLabVIEW-based software replaces a conglomeration of computers and software\npackages, saving hours in maintenance\nand data analysis, and making very longterm tests possible.\nThis all-in-one system was written primarily using LabVIEW for Mac OS X,\nwhich allows the combining of data from\nmultiple RS-232, USB, and Ethernet instruments for comprehensive laser\nanalysis and control. The system acquires data from CCDs (charge coupled\ndevices), power meters, thermistors, and\noscilloscopes over a controllable period\nof time. This data is saved to an html file\n\nthat can be accessed later from a variety\nof data analysis programs. Also, through\nthe LabVIEW interface, engineers can\neasily control laser input parameters\nsuch as current, pulse width, chiller temperature, and repetition rates. All of\nthese parameters can be adapted and cycled over a period of time.\nThis work was done by Paul Stysley and\nBarry Coyle of Goddard Space Flight Center,\nand Eric Lyness of Mink Hollow Systems, Inc.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).
