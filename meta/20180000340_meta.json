USTRANSCOM wanted to understand the principal issues that are holding back commercial development of airship transports. NASA Ames Research Center was commissioned by USTRANSCOM to study the airship industry\u2019s ability to design, develop, and operate cargo airships. Principal study objectives were to identify: (1) Current and near term state of the cargo airship industry; (2) Roadblocks hindering cargo airship development; (3) Steps needed to remove impediments to cargo airship deployment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180000340, "endDate": "2016-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "85f2cfd304984403b90d1e31daa42830", "id": "ace70b2d41c446e9a0ec598438e36a5d"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation Forum 2016", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "85f2cfd304984403b90d1e31daa42830", "startDate": "2016-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180000340, "id": "9e09b814dde049d9be94b4791e9b7e66", "publicationDate": "2016-06-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20180000339, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Airship Industry Study", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180000340.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180000340/downloads/20180000340.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180000340/downloads/20180000340.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180000340/downloads/20180000340.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
