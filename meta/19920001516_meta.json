As a result, it was determined that at depths of 3 cm or more Europa can have about a 30 K temperature enhancement over the diurnal mean surface temperature of about 97 K at the equator. It was also determined that the unusual shape of Europa's thermal flux curves during eclipses can be explained by the solid state greenhouse effect. The solid state greenhouse models were applied to the problem of the origin and energy sources of Triton's geyser-like plumes. Two classes of models are examined which may explain the driving energy for Triton's plumes. Triton's internal heatflow is recognized as a major contributor to its global energy balance. Internal heat flow from radioactive decay in Triton's interior along with absorbed thermal energy from Neptune total 5 to 20 pct. of the insolation absorbed by Triton, thus comprising a significant fraction of Triton's surface energy balance.", "title": "Thermal models for icy satellites", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920001516, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brown, Robert H."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "7539725d608d4584a7879579fed0e173"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920001516, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920001516, "id": "e7ac20d5ddaf4fa3a37b8d5ec66516e9", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Reports of Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, 1990", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19920001510, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Reports of Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, 1990", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
