When this is done, it is found that the resulting systems are insensitive to direct effects of the mass of the star, but do strongly depend on the properties of the disk, principally its surface density. Major uncertainty results from lack of an adequate theoretical model that predicts the existence, size, and distribution of analogs of our Solar System, particularly the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Nevertheless, reasons can be found for expecting that planetary systems, including those containing biologically habitable planets similar to Earth, may be abundant in the Galaxy and Universe.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "241", "submissionId": 20040089016, "issue": "1", "issn": "0004-640X", "id": "010f5cc9f4df4c03b1f9498348c4d4a4", "publicationName": "Astrophysics and space science", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
