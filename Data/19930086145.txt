Sjoberg\nSUMMARY\nFlight measurements were made of the lateral control characteristics of the Douglas D-558-II airplane in abrupt rudder-fixed aileron\nrolls. In the Mach number range from 0.50 to 0.86 the aileron rolling\neffectiveness is substantially constant and the rate of change of the\nd\nmaximum wing-tip helix angle with total aileron deflection \t\n\n2V has\nd\xc3\xb6aT\na value of 0.0027 radian per degree. Extrapolated data indicate that\nin this Mach number range full aileron deflection of 300 will produce\na maximum wing-tip helix angle pb/2V of about 0.08 radian. As the\nspeed is reduced below a Mach number of 0.50 a marked decrease occurs\nin the maximum value of pb/2V obtainable with a given aileron deflection. This decrease occurs because the dihedral effect increases with\ndecrease in speed and the adverse sideslip angles reached in the rolls\nat low speed are larger. At an indicated airspeed of lO miles per hour\nin the landing condition, full aileron deflection will produce a maximum pb/2V of 0.04 radian, which for standard sea-level conditions\ncorresponds to a rolling velocity of 400 per second. In the opinion of\nthe pilots this rolling velocity is sufficiently high for the landing\ncondition with this airplane. It is the opinion of several NACA pilots\nthat the maximum usable rolling velocity is on the order of 2.5 radians\nper second. In the Mach number range from 0.42 to 0.86 at an altitude\nof 15,000 feet rolling velocities greater than 2.5 radians per second\ncan be obtained with less than full aileron deflection. The data indicate that in going from high to low lift coefficient the yawing moment\n\n2\n\n\t\nNACA RN L0E17\n\ndue to rolling changes direction. At high lift coefficients the sideslip due to roll is in the same direction as the roll (right roll produces right sideslip), but at low lift coefficients the opposite tendency is present.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics is conducting a\nflight research program utilizing the Douglas D-558-II (BuAero No. 37974)\nresearch airplane. The D-8-II airplanes were designed for flight\nresearch in the transonic speed range and were procured for the NACA by\nthe Bureau of Aeronautics, Department of the Navy. The flight research\nprogram currently being conducted with the BuAero No. 37974 airplane\nconsists of determining the stability and control characteristics and\nthe aerodynamic loads acting on the wing and horizontal tail from\nthe stalling speed up to a maximum Mach number of about 0.90. This\npaper presents the lateral control characteristics as measured in abrupt\nrudder-fixed aileron rolls.

The airplane being used in the present investigation (BuAero No. 37974) does\nnct yet have the rocket engine installed. This airplane is powered\nsolely by a J-34-WE-40 turbojet engine which exhausts out of the bottom\nof the fuselage between the wing and the tail. Photographs of the airplane are shown as figures 1 and 2 and a three-view drawing is shown in\nfigure 3. Pertinent airplane dimensions and characteristics are listed\nin table I.\nBoth slats and fences are incorporated on the wing of the airplane.\nThe wing slats can be locked in the closed position, or they can be\nunlocked. When the slats are unlocked, the slat position is a function\nof the angle of attack of the airplane. Also, the slats on the left and\nright wings are interconnected and therefore, at any time, have the same\nposition. A section view of the slat and the forward portion of the wing\nshowing the motion of the slat with respect to the wing is shown in\nfigure 4.\nThe airplane is equipped with an adjustable stabilizer but no means\nare provided for trimming out aileron or rudder control forces. No aerodynamic balance or control-force booster system is used on any of the\ncontrols. Hydraulic dampers are installed on all control surfaces to aid\nin preventing control-surface flutter. Dive brakes are located on the\nrear portion of the fuselage.\nThe variation of aileron position with control-wheel position is\nshown in figure 5, and the friction in the aileron-control system as\n\nNACA RN L0El7\nmeasured on the ground under no load is shown in figure 6. The friction\nmeasurements were obtained by measuring the aileron positions and the\naileron control force as the ailerons were deflected slowly. The rate\nof aileron deflection was sufficiently low so that the control force\nresulting from the hydraulic dampers in the control system was negligible.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\nStandard NACA recording instruments were installed in the airplane\nto measure the following quantities: airspeed; altitude; elevator and\naileron wheel forces; rudder pedal force; normal, longitudinal, and\ntransverse accelerations; rolling, pitching, and yawing velocities;\nsideslip angle; stabilizer, elevator, rudder, left and right aileron,\nand slat positions.\nStrain gages were installed in the airplane to measure wing and\ntail loads. The strain-gage deflections were recorded on the oscillograph. All instruments were synchronized by means of a common timer.\nA free-swiveling airspeed head was used to measure both static and\ntotal pressure. This airspeed head was mounted on a boom 7 feet forward of the nose of the airplane. A vane which was used to measure\nsideslip angle was mounted below the same boom 41 feet forward of the\nnose of the airplane. (See fig. 1.) The indicated airspeeds and Mach\nnumbers presented in this paper have been corrected for the position\nerror of the airspeed head and the error due to the airspeed head itself.\nThe method of obtaining the airspeed calibration is given in reference 3.\nThe left and right aileron positions were measured on bell cranks\nabout 1 foot forward of the ailerons. The stabilizer, rudder, and\nelevator positions were measured on the control surfaces. The elevator\npositions presented were measured with respect to the stabilizer and\nthe stabilizer position was measured with respect to the fuselage center\nline. All control positions were measured perpendicular to the control\nhinge line.\n\nTESTS, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe aileron rolling effectiveness of the D- . 8-II airplane was\nmeasured in rudder-fixed aileron rolls at various speeds with the airplane in both the clean and landing configurations. In the clean con dition (landing gear up, flaps up, slats locked, inlet duct flaps closed)\n\nNACA RN L50E17\nrolls were made at eight different Mach numbers in the range from 0.33\nto 0.86. In the landing condition (landing gear down, flaps down, slats\nunlocked, inlet duct flaps open) rolls were made at indicated airspeeds\nof 149 to 175 miles per hour. The data were obtained in the altitude\nrange from 12,500 to 21,000 feet.\nTypical time histories of left and right aileron rolls at Mach\nnumbers of 0.33, 0.50, and 0.86 with the airplane in the clean condition are presented in figure 7. Similar time histories of rolls at an\nindicated airspeed of 150 miles per hour with the airplane in the\nlanding condition are presented in figure 8.\nInspection of the time histories indicates that in going from low\nto high speed or from high to low lift coefficient, the yawing moment\ndue to rolling changes direction. In the rolls at the lowest speeds\n(figs. 7(a) and 8), the sideslip due to rolling is in the same direction as the rolling motion; that is,. right roll produces right sideslip.\nWith positive dihedral effect, which the D-558-II airplane has throughout the speed range tested, the sideslip tends to decrease the rolling\nvelocity. In the rolls at a Mach number of 0.50 (fig. 7(b)) the sideslip immediately following the abrupt aileron deflection is in the same\ndirection as the rolling motion, but as the rolling velocity increases\nthe sideslip reverses and causes a further increase in rolling velocity.\nAt a Mach number of 0.86 (fig. 7(c)) the sideslip immediately following\nthe abrupt aileron deflection is in the opposite direction from the\nrolling motion. In the rolls at the higher Mach numbers or lower lift\ncoefficient the sideslip angles reached are smaller and the dihedral\neffect is less than at low speeds, and therefore the effect of sideslip\non rolling is smaller. The change in direction of the yawing moment\ndue to rolling which occurred with change in lift coefficient is in\nagreement with unpublished results obtained on a model of the Douglas\nD-558-II airplane in the Langley stability tunnel.\nFrom the aileron rolls previously presented as time histories and\nfrom additional aileron rolls, the aileron rolling effectiveness was\nevaluated in terms of the variation of maximum wing-tip helix angle pb/2V\nand the change in aileron control force with change in total aileron\ndeflection. Figure 9 presents the data for the various Mach numbers with\nthe airplane in the clean condition, and figure 10 presents the data for\nthe airplane in the landing condition. In some of the rolls, because of\nthe favorable sideslip which accompanied the rolling motion, no definite\npeak occurred in the rolling-velocity curve (see fig. 7(b)). In these\ninstances, the first maximum which occurred in the rolling velocity was\nused. For example, in determining the maximum pb/2V for the rolls in\nfigure 7(b), the rolling velocity at 1.5 seconds was used for the left\nroll and 2.5 seconds for the right roll. The aileron-control-force data\nof figures 9 and 10 were determined at the same times as the maximum\nrolling velocities. It should be noted that the peaks in the\n\n6\t\n\nNACA RN L50E17\n\naileron-force curves, which occur when the ailerons are abruptly\ndeflected, (see figs. 7 and 8) result from the hydraulic dampers in the\ncontrol system.\nAt all test speeds in both the clean and the landing conditions,\nthe variations of pb/2V and aileron control force Fa with aileron\ndeflection are approximately linear for the entire aileron deflection\nrange tested. The aileron control forces are light at low speeds. A\ncontrol force of the order of S to 10 pounds is required for lS\xc2\xb0 of\ntotal aileron deflection at the lower speeds investigated in both the\nclean and landing conditions. At the highest Mach numbers investigated,\n0.82 and 0.86, about So to 60 pounds of aileron force are required\nfor 1 0 of total aileron deflection.\nIn the Mach number range from 0.50 to 0.86 the aileron effectivedpb\nness is substantially constant and the value of\t\n77 is 0.0027 radian\nd\xc3\xb6aT\nper degree. As a matter of general interest it is pointed out that with\nthe D-55 8 -I and X-1 airplanes little or no reduction in aileron effectiveness has occurred at Mach numbers up to 0.86. As the speed is\nreduced below a Mach number of 0.50 a marked decrease occurs in the\nmaximum value of pb/2V obtainable with a given aileron deflection.\nThis decrease occurs because the dihedral effect increases with decrease\nin speed and the adverse sideslip angles reached in the rolls at low\nspeed are larger. At an indicated airspeed of 150 miles per hour in the\nlanding condition, full aileron deflection will produce a maximum pb/2V\nof about o.o!. radian. For standard sea-level conditions this corresponds\nto a rolling velocity of LiO\xc2\xb0 per second. Although the maximum values\nof pb/2V are relatively low at low speeds, in the pilot\'s opinion the\nrolling velocities are still sufficiently high. At the higher Mach\nnumbers investigated, aileron rolls were not made using aileron deflections greater than about one-half the full deflection (iso of total\naileron deflection) because the rolling velocities would be higher than\ndesirable from the pilot\'s standpoint. Extrapolation of the data\nobtained from aileron rolls made with the smaller deflections indicates\nthat in the Mach number range from 0.50 to 0.86 full aileron deflection\nwill produce a maximum pb/2V of about 0.08 radian.\nFrom the data previously presented and extrapolation of these data,\nthe rolling velocities which could be obtained using one-half and full\naileron deflection at an altitude of 1,000 feet were estimated and are\npresented in figure 11. In the opinion of several NACA pilots the maximum usable rolling velocity is of the order of 2.5 radians per second\n(about 140 0 per second). Inspection of figure 11 shows that at an\naltitude of 1,000 feet full aileron deflection will produce a rolling\nvelocity higher than this value at Mach numbers from 0.42 to the highest\nMach number investigated, 0.86. The flying-quality specifications of\n\n\t\n\nNACA RN L0E17 \t\n\n7\n\nthe Navy (reference 6) and the Air Force (reference 7) state that the\nminimum acceptable value of pb/2V for fighter-type airplanes is\n0.09 radian with the further stipulation that the rolling velocity\nneed never exceed 2200 per second. This specification, as applied to\nthe D-58-II airplane, is shown in figure 11. It is evident that the\nD-8-II airplane meets the specification at Mach numbers greater\nthan 0.7 but does not at the lower Mach number. It should be pointed\nout, however, that because of the short wing span the rolling velocities\nencountered are high for a given value of pb/2V. The minimum requirement, as set forth on a basis of pb/2V in references 6 and 7, therefore loses some of its significance. For example, even though the\nmaximum value of pb/2V was only 0.04 at 10 miles per hour in the\nlanding condition, the rolling velocity was 400 per second, which the\npilots considered adequate for low-speed control.\nFor comparison with the flight measurements an estimate has been\nd\nmade of the value of \t\n\n2V using the design charts of reference 8 and\r\n\nunpublished data obtained in an investigation in the Langley stability\nd\ntunnel of a model of the D-8-II airplane. The value of \t\n\npb\n\ndA6aT\n\nwas\r\n\nestimated from the formula\n\nd Pb\t\n\ndoai,\n\nd/\xc3\xb6aT = dC\n, pb\n2V\n\nA value of dC1 = 0.00063 was obtained from reference\ndbaT\n\n8 and\n\nthe value\n\ndC\nobtained from the wind-tunnel measurements was 0.28. There- \r\n\nof\t\nd pb\n\nd2\nfore the estimated value of \t\n\n2V is 0.0023 radian per degree. At low\r\n\nlift coefficient where the effects of sideslip on rolling were small, the\nd\nflight value of\t\n\n2V was 0.0027 radian per degree. The agreement\ndt\xc3\xb6aT\n\nbetween the flight and estimated value is considered fair.\n\nro\nLJ\n\nNACA RM L0El7\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nFlight measurements were made of the lateral control characteristics of the Douglas D-8-II airplane in abrupt rudder-fixed aileron\nrolls. In the Mach number range from 0.0 to 0.86 the aileron rolling\neffectiveness is substantially constant and the rate of change of the\nd\nmaximum wing-tip helix angle with total aileron deflection \t\n\n2V has\ndbaT\na value of 0.0027 radian per degree. Extrapolated data indicate that\nin this Mach number range full aileron deflection of 30 0 will produce\na maximum wing-tip helix angle pb/2V of about 0.08 radian. As the\nspeed is reduced below a Mach number of 0.50 a marked decrease occurs\nin the maximum value of pb/2V obtainable with a given aileron deflection. This decrease occurs because the dihedral effect increases with\ndecrease in speed and the adverse sideslip angles reached in the rolls\nat low speed are larger. At an indicated airspeed of 10 miles per hour\nin the landing condition full aileron deflection will produce a maximum pb/2V of 0.04 radian, which for standard sea-level conditions\ncorresponds to a rolling velocity of 400 per second. In the opinion of\nthe pilots, this rolling velocity is sufficiently high for the landing\nccndition with this airplane. It is the opinion of several NACA pilots\nthat the maximum usable rolling velocity is on the order of 2. 5 radians\nper second. In the Mach number range from 0.42 to 0.86 at an altitude\nof 1,000 feet rolling velocities greater than 2. 5 radians per second\ncan be obtained with less than full aileron deflection. The data indicate that in going from high to low lift coefficient the yawing moment\ndue to rolling changes direction. At high lift coefficients the sideslip due to roll is in the same direction as the roll (right roll produces right sideslip) but at low lift coefficients the opposite tendency\nis present.\nLangley Aeronautical Laboratory\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics\nLangley Air Force Base, Va.\n\nNACA RN L50E17\n\n\t\n9\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
