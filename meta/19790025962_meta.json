The events were examined on many different time scales ranging from days on either side of the boundary to high resolution measurements of 12.5 vectors per second. Two categories of boundaries were found, one group being relatively thin and the other being thick. In many cases the field vector rotated in a plane from one polarity to the other. Only two of the transitions were null sheets. Using the minimum variance analysis to determine the normals to the plane of rotation, and assuming that this is the same as the normal to the sector boundary surface, it was found that the normals were close to the ecliptic plane. An analysis of tangential discontinuities contained in 4-day periods about the events showed that their orientations were generally not related to the orientations of the sector boundary surface, but rather their characteristics were about the same as those for discontinuities outside the sector boundaries.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790025962, "id": "e0148cabf46c46b199c641b7f0afddcb", "publicationDate": "1979-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790025962.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790025962/downloads/19790025962.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790025962/downloads/19790025962.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790025962/downloads/19790025962.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
