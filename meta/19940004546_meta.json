The aircraft mission was to carry 1,000-3,000 lb of atmospheric pollutant monitoring equipment for 1-5 hr at an altitude of 100,000-130,000 ft. Three configurations subject to the same mission requirements were studied in detail. The three designs analyzed were the tandem-wing-twin-boom, joined wing, and conventional twin-boom configurations. The performance of the three proposed configurations is presented and shows that high altitude flight is possible with current technology. Different possible propulsion systems were investigated and suggestions are made for further investigation and better optimization of the designs.", "title": "High altitude reconnaissance aircraft design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940004546, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Poladian, D."}, "organization": {"name": "California State Polytechnic Univ.", "location": "Pomona, CA, United States"}}, "id": "836fed266e814f80996b82a6c56aed7a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940004546, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reinhard, D.
