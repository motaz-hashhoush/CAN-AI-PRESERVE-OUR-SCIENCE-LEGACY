Intersatellite optical communications retains a strong reliance on microwave circuit technology in several areas - the microwave to optical interface, the laser transmitter modulation driver and the optical receiver. A microwave to optical interface is described requiring high bandwidth electronic downconverters and demodulators. Electrical bandwidth and current drive requirements for the laser modulation driver for three laser alternatives are discussed. Bandwidth and noise requirements are presented for optical receiver architectures.", "title": "High bandwidth electro-optic technology for intersatellite optical communications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930048868, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Krainak, Michael A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "ccd3acaa986e4651a2bd0720bc58fe00"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930048868, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930048868, "publisher": "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers", "id": "4386e645ecb149e69e66b1a7eab415e4", "publicationName": "In: Optical technology for microwave applications VI and optoelectronic signal processing for phased-array antennas III; Proceedings of the Meeting, Orlando, FL, Apr. 20-23, 1992 (A93-32851 12-74)", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
