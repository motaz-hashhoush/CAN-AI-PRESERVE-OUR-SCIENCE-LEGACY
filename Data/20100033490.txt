These properties have been relatively poorly\n\n5\n\nunderstood, and it is one of the purposes of this review to demonstrate that, in recent years,\n\n6\n\nwe have made great strides in improving this understanding. Seen from space, the Earth is a\n\n7\n\ncool object, with an effective emitting temperature of about 255 K. This contrasts with a\n\n8\n\nglobal mean surface temperature of ~ 288 K, and is due primarily to strong absorption of\n\n9\n\noutgoing longwave energy by water vapour, carbon dioxide and clouds (especially ice). A\n\n10\n\nlarge fraction of this absorption occurs in the FIR, and so the Earth is effectively a FIR planet.\n\n11\n\nThe FIR is important in a number of key climate processes, for example the water vapour and\n\n12\n\ncloud feedbacks (especially ice clouds). The FIR is also a spectral region which can be used to\n\n13\n\nremotely sense and retrieve atmospheric composition in the presence of ice clouds. Recent\n\n14\n\ndevelopments in instrumentation have allowed progress in each of these areas, which are\n\n15\n\ndescribed, and proposals for a spaceborne FIR instrument are being formulated. It is timely to\n\n16\n\nreview the FIR properties of the clear and cloudy atmosphere, the role of FIR processes in\n\n17\n\nclimate, and its use in observing our planet from space.\n\n18\n19\n\n[225 words]\n\n20\n21\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.\n\n2\n\nThis paper reviews our understanding of the long wave portion of the spectrum of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n3\n\ninfrared emission to space. In all, this emission extends approximately from wavelengths of\n\n4\n\nabout 1 mm to about 4 \xc2\xb5m (or those wavenumbers between about 10 and 2500 cm-1) and\n\n5\n\nincludes the relatively unexplored part of the spectrum known as the far infrared (hereafter\n\n6\n\nabbreviated to \xe2\x80\x9cFIR\xe2\x80\x9d) and the better known mid infrared, the "MIR". The key feature of the\n\n7\n\nFIR is that it is the spectral range characterised by transitions between pure rotational, or very\n\n8\n\nlow vibrational energy states, and therefore it is a cool, low energy part of the spectrum. What\n\n9\n\nis our definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cFIR\xe2\x80\x9d? There is actually no precise definition of where the boundary\n\n10\n\nof the FIR occurs, nor do we need, or encourage one. In this review, we will accept whatever\n\n11\n\ndefinition the author has used in any particular piece of work that we are discussing, but for\n\n12\n\nthe sake of orientation we might take a wavelength of about 15 \xc2\xb5m, or a wavenumber of about\n\n13\n\n670 cm-1, as a rough boundary. The FIR, broadly, lies at longer wavelengths, or lower\n\n14\n\nwavenumbers than this boundary.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n16\n\nWe argue that the FIR is actually highly characteristic of the Earth as a system seen from\n\n17\n\nspace, and that it is of fundamental significance for planetary energy balance considerations\n\n18\n\nand therefore for understanding climate; it may also be of great practical value in application\n\n19\n\nto remote sounding of the composition of the atmosphere from space, and the characterisation\n\n20\n\nof clouds (cirrus in particular). Our review will, therefore, be focused on the peculiarities of\n\n21\n\nthe FIR in the broader context of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s emission spectrum.\n\n22\n23\n\nThe Earth is a cool object in space: this is the prime reason why the FIR is so important to an\n\n24\n\nunderstanding of the climate system. If we measure the brightness temperature of the Earth\n\n25\n\n(that is the temperature of an equivalent black body), with an instrument in space, we would\n\n26\n\nmeasure something like 255 K [Harries, 1995; Andrews, 2000]. Differentiation of the Planck\n3\n\n1\n\nradiation law to produce the Wien Displacement law [Goody, 1964] tells us that the peak\n\n2\n\nenergy from a black body at 255 K occurs at about 500 cm-1. Bearing in mind that the\n\n3\n\ntemperature of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s upper troposphere falls as low as 230 K or so, when we do the\n\n4\n\ncalculations, we find that (depending on the latitude) up to 35% of the energy escaping to\n\n5\n\nspace, so cooling the Earth, is at wavenumbers below 500 cm-1 [Sinha and Harries, 1995]. If\n\n6\n\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cboundary\xe2\x80\x9d of the FIR is taken to be 667 cm-1 then this maximum fraction increases to\n\n7\n\nnearer 45%. So, it is very important that climate models include accurate details of the FIR\n\n8\n\nproperties of the atmosphere if they are to produce accurate predictions of climate change.\n\n9\n10\n\nAnother area in which it is important to understand the FIR spectrum is in remote sounding of\n\n11\n\nthe Earth and its atmosphere from space. Remote sounding at mid IR (MIR) wavelengths,\n\n12\n\nshorter than 15 \xc2\xb5m, has been extensively used for measurements of temperature and\n\n13\n\ncomposition from space, as also has the microwave region at wavelengths longer than about 1\n\n14\n\nmm. The region in between has not been exploited, because it seemed to be at a disadvantage\n\n15\n\nin terms of low photon energy with respect to the mid IR, while not benefiting, for technical\n\n16\n\nreasons, from the multiplexing or heterodyne techniques usable in the mm region because of\n\n17\n\nthe availability of suitable mixers and monochromatic sources. However, as we shall see, the\n\n18\n\nFIR, observed using modern techniques, offers the possibility of accurate remote sounding of\n\n19\n\nwater vapour and other constituents, in both clear skies, and also (because of the relatively\n\n20\n\nhigh transparency of clouds in the FIR) in the vicinity of optically thin clouds.\n\n21\n22\n\nIt is timely to present a review of the scientific background to, and current understanding of,\n\n23\n\nthe FIR spectrum of the Earth for two primary reasons: first, because the need to make ever\n\n24\n\nmore accurate predictions of climate change demands a more profound understanding of\n\n25\n\nimportant FIR processes; and, second, because future satellite instrumentation may include\n\n26\n\nspectrometers and other devices that operate in this less familiar range of the electromagnetic\n4\n\n1\n\nspectrum, between the mid infrared and the microwave region. This paper presents a review\n\n2\n\nof the FIR properties of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, and of those FIR processes which are\n\n3\n\nsignificant to the planetary energy balance, and also describes the application of the FIR to\n\n4\n\nremote sounding in the presence of clouds. It describes a range of current research in the\n\n5\n\nfield, in which basic science, instrument development, and measurements from aircraft and\n\n6\n\nballoons are all being carried out.\n\n7\n8\n\n[Insert Box 1 near here]\n\n9\n10\n\n=============================================================\n\n11\n\nBox 1: Tutorial on infrared spectroscopy and radiative transfer in the atmosphere\n\n12\n13\n\nSpectroscopy\n\n14\n\nTwo classic text books which provide comprehensive introductions to the spectroscopy of the\n\n15\n\natmosphere are Penner [1959] and Goody [1964]. We provide a brief introduction to the\n\n16\n\nsubject here. In the absence of an atmosphere, radiative transfer for the Earth would be\n\n17\n\nsimple. Incoming solar radiation would be partly reflected and partly absorbed by the surface,\n\n18\n\ndepending on the \xe2\x80\x98albedo\xe2\x80\x99, or reflectance of the local surface. The absorbed energy would\n\n19\n\nwarm the surface, and emission of thermal radiation, according to the Planck radiation law\n\n20\n\n[Goody, 1964], would take place, transferring energy back to space. In balance, the two\n\n21\n\nfluxes of energy would be equal, on a globally averaged basis.\n\n22\n23\n\nThe effect of the atmosphere is to moderate these fluxes. Ignoring clouds to begin with, the\n\n24\n\natmosphere contains molecules such as H2O, CO2, CH4, O3, and many others that are excited\n\n25\n\nby the available energy to move (translational energy), to rotate, to vibrate, and to excite their\n\n26\n\nconstituent electrons to higher energy states. Since we are concerned here with the FIR, we\n5\n\n1\n\ncan restrict our view to the thermal or infrared region, for which electronic transitions are not\n\n2\n\nrelevant, being of too high an energy. The vibrational and rotational energy levels of the\n\n3\n\nmolecules are quantised [Rae, 2002], which means that energy levels can take up only certain\n\n4\n\ndiscrete values, and energy exchange can only occur at discrete energies. Since energy, E, is\n\n5\n\nproportional to frequency (E = hf, where h is Planck\xe2\x80\x99s constant, and f is frequency), we can,\n\n6\n\ntherefore, say that the atmosphere will absorb or emit infrared radiation only at discrete\n\n7\n\nfrequencies. It is common to use alternative but entirely equivalent parameters to describe the\n\n8\n\nenergy scale, including frequency, f (in Hertz), wavelength \xce\xbb, (usually in \xc2\xb5m), or\n\n9\n\nwavenumber, \xce\xbd (in cm-1). The three are related via the speed of light, c, by\n\n10\n11\n\nc = f\xce\xbb;\n\n12\n\n\xce\xbd = 1/\xce\xbb = f/c .\n\n{B1}\n\n13\n14\n\nIn fact, energy transitions are not precisely monochromatic, but are broadened by inter-\n\n15\n\nmolecular and other effects, such as collisions, and the Doppler effect, so that if we magnify a\n\n16\n\nsingle absorption or emission line, we find that it has the shape of a single resonance\n\n17\n\nmaximum, and a definite half width at half peak height, both of which depend on parameters\n\n18\n\nlike pressure and temperature [Goody, 1964].\n\n19\n20\n\nBecause the frequencies at which each molecule absorbs and emits IR radiation are different,\n\n21\n\ndepending on molecular structure as well as molecular density, and atmospheric temperature\n\n22\n\nand pressure, the real atmospheric spectrum is a highly complex merger of individual lines,\n\n23\n\nand groups (bands) of lines from all of the absorbing molecules. In some regions of the\n\n24\n\nspectrum, the atmosphere may be highly transparent; in others, it is strongly absorbing, and\n\n25\n\nphotons have a small mean free path before being absorbed.\n\n26\n6\n\n1\n\n[Figures B1 and B2 next to each other here in Box 1]\n\n2\n3\n\nFigure B1 shows the total atmospheric optical depth at the centre of all the water vapour and\n\n4\n\ncarbon dioxide absorption lines throughout the whole of the IR; similar information is\n\n5\n\nprovided in Figure B2 for the remaining key absorbing species. Each absorption line is\n\n6\n\nrepresented by one point, the optical depth (see below for definition) of the atmosphere at the\n\n7\n\ncentral wavenumber. Note that the y-axis scale is logarithmic, so that each division represents\n\n8\n\na factor of 10. This method of display allows a comparison of absorption strengths across the\n\n9\n\nwhole IR spectral region with each band colour coded. The dominant effect of water vapour\n\n10\n\nin the mid and far IR may be seen, as can the important bands of CO2 at 15 \xc2\xb5m (667 cm-1) and\n\n11\n\n4.3 \xc2\xb5m (2325 cm-1). The lower optical depths between 750 and 1250 cm-1, and between 2400\n\n12\n\nand 3000 cm-1 represent regions of lower absorption, or higher transparency, commonly\n\n13\n\nreferred to as \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric windows\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n14\n15\n\nThe strength of absorption can be measured by a parameter known as the mass absorption\n\n16\n\ncoefficient, \xce\xb1\xce\xbd , which is related to the fractional transmittance, \xcf\x84\xce\xbd , of a path of length l\n\n17\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 L\n\xe2\x8e\xa4\n(maximum path L) and absorber density, \xcf\x81 , by \xcf\x84 \xce\xbd = exp \xe2\x8e\xa2\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb1\xce\xbd (l )\xcf\x81 (l )dl \xe2\x8e\xa5 . The term\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 0\n\xe2\x8e\xa6\n\n18\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1L\n\xe2\x8e\xa4\n\xcf\x87\xce\xbd = \xe2\x8e\xa2 \xe2\x88\xab \xce\xb1\xce\xbd (l )\xcf\x81 (l )dl \xe2\x8e\xa5 is known as the optical depth.\n\xe2\x8e\xa30\n\xe2\x8e\xa6\n\n19\n20\n\nIn the FIR, the mechanism by which a molecule may absorb or emit radiative energy is either\n\n21\n\nthrough rotations or vibrations of the molecule in question, because the energies of such\n\n22\n\nprocesses correspond to the FIR. Each type of motion is quantised in terms of the allowed\n\n23\n\nenergy states and transitions between them. Rotational spectral lines are lower in energy (i.e.\n\n24\n\nlower in characteristic frequency: see eq. B1 above) than vibrational energy transitions. The\n7\n\n1\n\nfrequencies of energy state transitions in the latter case depend on changes to the shape of the\n\n2\n\nmolecule, and the atomic weights of the constituents, as well as on \xe2\x80\x98selection rules\xe2\x80\x99 that\n\n3\n\ndetermine whether transitions between particular energy states are allowed by quantum\n\n4\n\nmechanics or not. The vibrations of a molecule are classified broadly by whether the\n\n5\n\nvibration represents a stretching of a particular inter-atomic bond, or a bending of the\n\n6\n\nmolecule. In this paper we refer to different vibration classes as \xce\xbd1, \xce\xbd2 or \xce\xbd3: these refer, in\n\n7\n\nthe case of tri-atomic molecules like CO2 and H2O, to symmetric stretching of the two C-O or\n\n8\n\nO-H bonds (\xce\xbd1), bending of the molecule about the \xe2\x80\x98pivot\xe2\x80\x99 of the central atom (C or O) of the\n\n9\n\nthree (\xce\xbd2), and asymmetric stretching of the two C-O or O-H bonds (\xce\xbd3). Goody [1964]\n\n10\n\nprovides a clear explanation of these definitions.\n\n11\n12\n\nRadiative transfer\n\n13\n14\n\nThe transfer of radiative energy within and through the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere is treated in a\n\n15\n\nnumber of classic text books, including Chandrasekhar [1960], and Goody [1964]. The\n\n16\n\nradiative transfer of the atmosphere is controlled by the spectra of atmospheric molecules,\n\n17\n\ndescribed above. In the infrared, the transmittance of any given 1metre of path length\n\n18\n\ndepends on the molecular density, the temperature and the atmospheric pressure along that\n\n19\n\npath, but is principally determined by whether the chosen spectral wavelength (wavenumber)\n\n20\n\ncoincides with an absorption line, or a collection or band of lines.\n\n21\n22\n\nAt some wavelengths, away from such absorptions, thermal radiation emitted upwards by the\n\n23\n\nsurface has a high probability of escaping to space: at more highly absorbing wavelengths, a\n\n24\n\nphoton has a very low probability of escaping to space, instead being absorbed by a higher\n\n25\n\n(and usually colder) layer of the atmosphere: subsequently, some of the absorbed energy may\n\n26\n\nbe re-emitted, this time at the lower local temperature, and so on, until eventually a photon is\n8\n\n1\n\nable to escape to space. This process is the physical basis of the greenhouse effect. In local\n\n2\n\nthermodynamic equilibrium (effectively the case for the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere below ~ 60 km),\n\n3\n\nthe emission at a given local temperature, T, is governed by the Planck law. The Planck law\n\n4\n\nmay be written as:\n\n5\nB f (T ) =\n\n6\n\n2hf 3\nc 2 {exp[hf k B T ] \xe2\x88\x92 1}\n\n{B2}\n\n7\n8\n\nwhere Bf(T), the spectral radiance of a black body (unit emissivity), is the power per unit area,\n\n9\n\nper unit solid angle, per unit frequency interval at frequency, f , in a particular direction; in\n\n10\n\naddition to previously defined quantities, kB is Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s constant, and h is Planck\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n11\n\nconstant.\n\n12\n13\n\nRadiative transfer within an atmosphere is described in terms of the Schwarzchild equation of\n\n14\n\nradiative transfer. This treatment is a little beyond the scope of this \xe2\x80\x98primer\xe2\x80\x99, but the\n\n15\n\ninterested reader is referred to the texts by Chandrasekhar [1960], Goody, [1964], and Goody\n\n16\n\nand Yung [1989] for more information. This equation describes how radiation propagates\n\n17\n\nalong a path through an atmosphere, where scattering, absorption and thermal emission may\n\n18\n\nall occur due to interactions with the molecules and cloud particles along the path. While\n\n19\n\nabsorption (emission) will reduce (enhance) the intensity of the radiation as it propagates,\n\n20\n\nscattering processes can have either effect according to whether radiation is being scattered\n\n21\n\ninto, or out of, the beam.\n\n22\n23\n\n[Figure B3 near here in Box 1]\n\n24\n\n9\n\n1\n\nFigure B3 shows some calculations using a radiative transfer code6 which illustrate some of\n\n2\n\nthese points. Shown in Figure B3 are the upwelling, top of the atmosphere (commonly\n\n3\n\nabbreviated to TOA) spectra calculated for a warm, moist model atmosphere, and a cold, dry\n\n4\n\nmodel atmosphere (so-called \xe2\x80\x9cstandard atmospheres\xe2\x80\x9d, [Anderson et al, 1986]), both cloud-\n\n5\n\nfree. The y-axis is in units of spectral radiance (power per unit area, per unit solid angle, per\n\n6\n\nunit wavenumber interval, in a particular direction). The black curve is the calculated\n\n7\n\nspectrum for each case. The red lines describe the shape of the Planck function for the\n\n8\n\ntemperatures indicated. The line structure below about 500 cm-1 is mainly due to water\n\n9\n\nvapour; the band centred at 667 cm-1 is due to CO2; the band centred at 1060 cm-1 is due to\n\n10\n\nO3; and the extended band above about 1250 cm-1 is due primarily to H2O and other gases,\n\n11\n\nincluding CH4. In the window region, between about 800 and 1250 cm-1 the brightness\n\n12\n\ntemperature seen at the TOA is close to the assumed surface temperature. In the centre of the\n\n13\n\nintensely absorbing CO2 band, the brightness temperature is that of the tropopause/lower\n\n14\n\nstratosphere, because below these heights the atmosphere is opaque. In the pure rotational\n\n15\n\nband of water vapour, below about 500 cm-1, the brightness temperature represents the\n\n16\n\ntemperature at the level from which most of the radiation reaching the TOA is originating.\n\n17\n18\n\nHeating rates\n\n19\n\n6\n\n[There are a number of powerful radiative transfer codes available, which allow the calculation of the transfer\n\nof electro-magnetic radiation through an atmosphere made up of gases, aerosols and clouds. A detailed\ntreatment is beyond the scope of this work, but an excellent source in which to find references to and details of a\nwide range of codes is given in the Wikipedia website at:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_atmospheric_radiative_transfer_codes.\nSpecific publications include Cahalan et al. (2005), Edwards (1992), Rothman et al., (2005) and Stamnes K\n(1988)].\n\n10\n\n1\n\nThe concept of a heating rate follows on from the basic concepts of radiative transfer given\n\n2\n\nabove. The heating (or cooling) rate of a volume of the atmosphere,\n\n3\n\nenergy, is a measure of the rate of gain (or loss) of energy by that volume to space. The\n\n4\n\nheating rate is defined as the energy gained per unit volume, per unit time, into a 2\xcf\x80 steradian\n\n5\n\nhemisphere centred on the vertical direction, and may be evaluated as a function of spectral\n\n6\n\nwavenumber, \xce\xbd, or as a spectrally integrated total rate. Unless otherwise indicated, we shall\n\n7\n\nconsider the heating rate to be a function of wavenumber. Thus, the heating rate per\n\n8\n\nwavenumber, as a function of altitude, may be written as Q\xce\xbd ( z ) , which, in units of Jm-3s-\n\n9\n\ndQ \xe2\x80\xa2\n= Q , where Q is heat\ndt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n\n(cm-1)-1, is equal to the vertical gradient of the net radiative flux7, FN(z) [Andrews, 2000].\n\n10\n\nFor an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium, with cp being the specific heat at constant\n\n11\n\npressure, and with the sign convention of net flux noted in the footnote:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQ\xce\xbd ( z ) = \xcf\x81 ( z )c p\n\n12\n\ndT\xce\xbd dF\xce\xbd , N (z)\n=\ndt\ndz\n\n,\n\n{B3}\n\n13\n14\n\nthough by common practice, at least in meteorology, an alternative heating rate is more\n\n15\n\nusually expressed as a rate of change of temperature for the volume of air concerned (units\n\n16\n\nKs-1(cm-1)-1):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ndT\nQ\xce\xbd\n1 dF\xce\xbd , N ( z )\nh\xce\xbd ( z ) = \xce\xbd =\n=\ndt\n\xcf\x81(z)c p \xcf\x81 ( z )c p\ndz\n\n17\n\n.\n\n{B4}\n\n18\n19\n\nThe total heating rate may be obtained by integrating over \xce\xbd and/or z, as appropriate.\n\n20\n\n[End of Box 1]\n\n21\n\n==============================================================\n\n7\n\nNet radiative flux = downwelling flux \xe2\x80\x93 upwelling flux, or FN = F\xe2\x86\x93 - F\xe2\x86\x91\n\n11\n\n1\n2\n\n2.\n\nBackground: Spectral properties and energy balance of the Earth in the FIR\n\n2.1.\n\nClear sky spectral properties in the FIR\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nBox 1 gives a \xe2\x80\x9ctutorial\xe2\x80\x9d on the basic principles and concepts of spectroscopy and radiative\n\n7\n\ntransfer which underlie a study of the IR properties of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, and which\n\n8\n\nappear later in the paper. We now turn to a more specific examination of the FIR in\n\n9\n\nparticular.\n\n10\n11\n\nThe spectral properties - that is the variation of the absorption coefficient with wavenumber -\n\n12\n\nof the cloud-free atmosphere at wavelengths longer than 15 \xc2\xb5m are dominated by water\n\n13\n\nvapour, and only at the high frequency end of this range does CO2 absorb significantly. The\n\n14\n\nabsorption by these molecules in the FIR is so strong that from space the surface is entirely\n\n15\n\nobscured, except in the coldest and driest conditions near the poles. Thus, the study of the\n\n16\n\nFIR Earth from space is essentially a study of the atmosphere alone.\n\n17\n18\n\nIn the neutral atmosphere, in comparison to water vapour and CO2, other absorbing molecules\n\n19\n\nor atoms absorb an insignificant amount of energy. In the FIR the pure rotational band of\n\n20\n\nwater vapour extends from the microwave region (weak transitions at wavenumbers as low as\n\n21\n\n6 cm-1), to the CO2 \xce\xbd2 vibration-rotational band centred at 667 cm-1. The centre of the pure\n\n22\n\nrotational band of water vapour is a broad feature around 100-150 cm-1, comprising many\n\n23\n\nhundreds of strongly absorbing individual pure rotational lines [Goody, 1964]. At higher\n\n24\n\nwavenumbers, the intensities of transitions fall to lower values in the 400-600 cm-1 region,\n\n25\n\nwhere a partially transparent \xe2\x80\x9cwindow\xe2\x80\x9d occurs, and where the lower frequency edge of the\n\n26\n\nvery strong CO2 band begins, at about 500 cm-1. At wavenumbers below the peak of the\n12\n\n1\n\nwater vapour band, the intensity of transitions also decreases. Other molecular species (and\n\n2\n\natomic oxygen), including O3, N2O, HDO, HNO3, and many others [Harries, 1977; Carli,\n\n3\n\n1984], have pure rotational or low energy vibrational transitions in the FIR, but these are\n\n4\n\ninsignificant in terms of radiative energy transfer compared with water vapour. However, the\n\n5\n\nexistence of spectral features due to these species does, of course, provide the possibility of\n\n6\n\nusing the FIR for retrieval of atmospheric composition.\n\n7\n8\n\nFollowing on from Figure B3, Figure 1 presents calculations of the transmittance of the\n\n9\n\natmosphere in the FIR (Brindley, unpublished: see also Brindley and Harries [1998]) for the\n\n10\n\nexpanded region 0-1000 cm-1, which illustrate the dominant influence of water vapour on the\n\n11\n\nFIR spectrum. These calculations use a so-called line-by-line, or high resolution radiative\n\n12\n\ntransfer code that calculates the atmospheric transmittance at very high spectral resolution so\n\n13\n\nthat each individual spectral line shape is included. Spectrum (a) shows the fractional\n\n14\n\ntransmittance from 12 km to the top of the atmosphere (TOA) for a moist, warm tropical\n\n15\n\nstandard atmosphere [Anderson et al., 1986], and (b) shows the transmittance from the surface\n\n16\n\nto the TOA for the same model atmosphere. Figure 1(c) shows the transmittance from 8 km\n\n17\n\nto the TOA for a colder and drier polar standard atmosphere, while (d) shows, for this same\n\n18\n\natmosphere, the transmittance from the ground to the TOA. This figure illustrates several\n\n19\n\npoints:\n\n20\n21\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n22\n\nabout 20 and 400 cm-1, and the CO2 \xce\xbd2 vibration band between about 600 and 720 cm-1.\n\n23\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n24\n\ntroposphere and stratosphere, due to the intense absorption strength of the pure rotational\n\n25\n\nwater vapour band. Over much of the FIR, the lower troposphere is totally opaque.\n\nThe principal absorption features are the pure rotational band of water vapour between\n\nFor much of the FIR, the atmosphere becomes partially transparent only in the upper\n\n13\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2\n\nstratosphere, where the water vapour absorption is weaker, and so does not block absorption\n\n3\n\nlines due to other absorbers [Carli, 1984].\n\n4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5\n\nspace comes, not from the surface, but from the upper troposphere, because the lower\n\n6\n\ntroposphere over most of the planet in the FIR is totally opaque, the surface is obscured, and\n\n7\n\nno energy can escape to space.\n\nThis means that the FIR is particularly useful for remote sensing of composition in the\n\nIt also means that much of the energy that is emitted and which cools the Earth to\n\n8\n9\n\n[Figure 1 near here]\n\n10\n11\n\nWe can see from this evidence that in the FIR, the energy that the Earth emits to space as part\n\n12\n\nof the cooling processes which, in thermal steady-state, balance the heating due to the Sun, is\n\n13\n\nstrongly modulated at different wavenumbers and different heights by water vapour. Bearing\n\n14\n\nin mind that the Earth is a FIR object in space, emitting at an effective temperature of about\n\n15\n\n255 K (we recall that at this temperature a Planck curve peaks at about 500 cm-1), we can see\n\n16\n\nthat water vapour acts in the FIR as an important greenhouse gas: it can absorb energy from\n\n17\n\nthe warm surface below, and re-emit it to space at a lower temperature in, say, the upper\n\n18\n\ntroposphere. Therefore, water vapour exhibits a strong feedback, in which any greenhouse\n\n19\n\nwarming due to increasing levels of CO2 is amplified if more water vapour enters the\n\n20\n\natmosphere as a result. As CO2 concentrations rise in the atmosphere, so the atmospheric and\n\n21\n\nsurface temperatures rise: this rise in temperature in turn causes increased evaporation from\n\n22\n\nthe oceans, and so more water vapour may be expected to enter the atmosphere. This\n\n23\n\nadditional water vapour enhances the original greenhouse warming, and is a major\n\n24\n\ncontribution to global climate change [IPCC, 2001 and 2007]. A corollary of these properties\n\n25\n\nis that from space in the FIR the surface is usually not visible, because of the very high\n\n26\n\nopacity of the atmosphere.\n14\n\n1\n2\n\n2.2\n\nContinuum absorption by water vapour\n\n3\n4\n\nThe water vapour spectrum includes one aspect which is far from well understood\n\n5\n\ntheoretically. Whereas the absorption around the centre of a spectral line of water vapour is\n\n6\n\nvery closely described by the Voigt line shape [Andrews, 2000] because both collisional\n\n7\n\nbroadening and Doppler broadening of the spectral lines are important in the FIR [Goody,\n\n8\n\n1964], the precise shape and properties of the absorption lines farther from line centre are not\n\n9\n\nwell understood, despite having been the subject of considerable research over many years. It\n\n10\n\nis found that the absorption in these \xe2\x80\x9cfar wings\xe2\x80\x9d of the lines is stronger than is predicted by\n\n11\n\nany of the current theories of collisional (pressure) or Doppler line broadening.\n\n12\n13\n\nThe ideas put forward to explain this feature fall into three classes: those which treat the\n\n14\n\ndiscrepancy as purely a matter of the wrong line shape in the far wings for molecule-molecule\n\n15\n\ninteractions (so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuum absorption\xe2\x80\x9d: Ma and Tipping, [2002]; Ptashnik et al.,\n\n16\n\n[2004]); those that invoke the creation of a new molecule as a result of collisions (a dimer, or\n\n17\n\ndouble molecule of water vapour, and even higher polymers) that is responsible for the\n\n18\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d absorption [Vaida et al., 2001]; and those which adopt a more pragmatic approach,\n\n19\n\n[Clough et al., 1989] using an empirical model to describe the measured excess absorption: in\n\n20\n\nthis approach, two terms have been invoked, one a self-broadening effect due to water-water\n\n21\n\nmolecule collisions, and the other due to water-foreign gas (eg N2 or O2) broadening.\n\n22\n23\n\nIn this last approach, the water vapour continuum was defined as all absorption due to water\n\n24\n\nvapour not attributable to a Lorentz (collisional broadening) line [Goody, 1964], within 25\n\n25\n\ncm-1 of each line centre [Clough et al. 1989]. The success of this approach, which employed a\n\n26\n\ncommon line shape for all spectral lines, led the authors to suggest that water vapour\n15\n\n1\n\ncontinuum absorption was due to the intermediate and far wings of allowed water vapour\n\n2\n\nmonomer transitions. Clough and colleagues claimed that their model effectively ended\n\n3\n\nspeculation about the existence of discrete dimers or multimers. In [Mlawer et al 1999],\n\n4\n\nClough and co-workers introduced a new formulation of the CKD approach to the water\n\n5\n\nvapour continuum, designated MT_CKD. The new model describes the contribution from\n\n6\n\neach spectral line as the sum of two terms: a sub-Lorentzian line shape, and a small, broad\n\n7\n\nadditional line shape that provides the needed super-Lorentzian absorption in the intermediate\n\n8\n\nline wings. The MT_CKD version has been tuned to observations in the far infrared recorded\n\n9\n\nwith an upward-looking ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (Atmospheric Emitted\n\n10\n\nRadiance Interferometer) used in campaigns, for example, in cold dry Arctic conditions\n\n11\n\n[Tobin et al. 1999].\n\n12\n13\n\nEstimates (Rizzi, unpublished) using the US standard atmosphere and the MT_CKD model,\n\n14\n\nshow that the continuum absorption due to water vapour reduces the outgoing thermal\n\n15\n\nradiation at the TOA in clear sky conditions by about 2.2%, equivalent to a change in radiance\n\n16\n\nof about 2 Wm-2sr-1. The downwelling longwave radiation at the surface was found to\n\n17\n\nincrease by almost 6 Wm-2sr-1, that is by about 5.8%. Recent work [Green, 2003; Green et al.,\n\n18\n\n2007] has shown that continuum absorption, particularly water-foreign gas continuum\n\n19\n\nabsorption is significant, even in the centre of the strong pure rotational band of monomer\n\n20\n\nwater vapour, and so cannot be ignored in a complete treatment of the FIR.\n\n21\n22\n\n2.3\n\nHeating rates\n\n23\n24\n\nThe primer in Box 1 gives a definition of the parameter known as the heating (or cooling)\n\n25\n\nrate. This is a measure of the rate of energy gain (or loss). It is interesting to calculate the\n\n26\n\nheating rate as a function of altitude and of spectral wavenumber, as was done by Kiehl\n16\n\n1\n\n[1983] and Charlock [1984], and later by Clough et al [1992], and this has been repeated for\n\n2\n\nthe US Standard Atmosphere [Anderson et al., 1986] tropical and sub-arctic models, in Figure\n\n3\n\n2 [Brindley and Harries, 1998].\n\n4\n5\n\n[Figure 2 near here]\n\n6\n7\n\nFigure 2 makes clear the dominant effect that the pure rotational band of water vapour has on\n\n8\n\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmospheric radiative energy balance. Because the opacity of the pure rotational\n\n9\n\nband varies with wavenumber, and peaks in the region of 100-200 cm-1, we find that the\n\n10\n\nheight at which maximum cooling (energy loss) to space occurs for a given wavenumber,\n\n11\n\npeaks in the mid- to upper troposphere, at altitudes that depend on the opacity and therefore\n\n12\n\non the wavenumber. At any given wavenumber the cooling rate profile can be calculated\n\n13\n\nfrom the vertical gradient in net flux (equation B4). This quantity is itself determined by the\n\n14\n\nvertical gradient in the atmospheric transmission to space, which, for clear conditions in the\n\n15\n\nFIR, is effectively controlled by the vertical distribution of water vapour in the atmosphere.\n\n16\n\nThe level of peak cooling occurs where the transmission gradient is a maximum. Below this\n\n17\n\nmaximum the transmission to space tends to zero because the path to space at these lower\n\n18\n\nlevels is blocked by the strongly absorbing layers above. Above the maximum the decay in\n\n19\n\nthe amount of water vapour with height is sufficient to allow the transmission to tend to a\n\n20\n\nvalue of unity; when this occurs all of the radiation emitted from levels below this height\n\n21\n\nescapes directly to space.\n\n22\n23\n\nOther notable features that can be seen in Figure 2 include:\n\n24\nStrong absorption (local heating) in the lower stratosphere by the \xce\xbd3 fundamental band\n\n25\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n26\n\nof ozone, O3 centred at 1045 cm-1, which switches to strong cooling above.\n17\n\n1\nVery intense absorption by the \xce\xbd2 fundamental band of CO2 centred at 667 cm-1, so\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\nintense that no radiation can escape to space except from stratospheric heights, where a strong\n\n4\n\ncooling to space occurs at the band centre;\n\n5\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7\n\ncm-1, due to weaker water vapour lines, and to continuum emission and absorption.\n\nCooling to space in the atmospheric \xe2\x80\x9cwindow\xe2\x80\x9d region between about 800 and 1200\n\n8\n9\n10\n\n2.4\n\nSensitivity of the emitted spectrum to changes in water vapour content and\n\ntemperature\n\n11\n12\n\nAs suggested by section 2.3 the FIR spectrum at the top of the atmosphere is highly sensitive\n\n13\n\nto changes in atmospheric water vapour [Rizzi et al., 2002].\n\n14\n15\n\n[Figure 3 near here]\n\n16\n17\n\nFigure 3 shows the difference in outgoing longwave radiance between three simulations:\n\n18\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n19\n\nand skin temperature decreased by 1K);\n\n20\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n21\n\n0.9, and no other change);\n\n22\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCase A (Tropical standard atmosphere with water vapour concentration scaled by 0.9\n\nCase B (Tropical standard atmosphere with only water vapour concentration scaled by\n\nCase C: control (Tropical standard atmosphere, with no scaling).\n\n23\n24\n\nFigure 3 shows the differences Case A-C, and Case B-C. Several features are apparent. First,\n\n25\n\nin the centre of the CO2 band the radiance differences are zero in both cases, because the\n\n26\n\natmosphere is so optically thick at these wavelengths that none of the changes to the\n18\n\n1\n\natmosphere are detected in the outgoing radiance: at these wavelengths the radiance\n\n2\n\noriginates in the stratosphere (which remained unchanged in the simulation). The Case B-C\n\n3\n\ndifference shows essentially the spectral profile of water vapour and continuum absorption.\n\n4\n\nThe Case A-C difference shows the same difference as Case A-B in the pure rotational band\n\n5\n\nbelow 600 cm-1, where the surface (reduced skin temperature) is not detected at the top of the\n\n6\n\natmosphere because of the intense absorption by water vapour. However, in the more\n\n7\n\ntransparent window region, the effect of the -1K skin temperature change in Case A is\n\n8\n\napparent between about 750 and 1300 cm-1. These differences indicate that spectral\n\n9\n\ndifferences are evident outside the optically thick spectral regions and therefore the spectral\n\n10\n\nsignal provides information on the two separate physical processes.\n\n11\n12\n\nSimilarly, calculations for higher, including polar, latitudes (not shown, but see also Figure 2)\n\n13\n\nalso show that the pure rotational band remains a strong absorber, even at the lower water\n\n14\n\nvapour concentrations. In fact, a very interesting partially transparent window in the 500-600\n\n15\n\ncm-1 region opens up, raising the intriguing question of enhanced surface to space radiative\n\n16\n\ncooling, as reported by Shaw et al, [1999] on the basis of low water content measurements\n\n17\n\nfrom a high mountain.\n\n18\n19\n\nRizzi et al., [2002] also demonstrated that the FIR was particularly sensitive to water vapour\n\n20\n\nchanges in the upper troposphere, and suggested that spectrally resolved measurements were\n\n21\n\nmore sensitive to humidity changes at all levels in the atmosphere than broad-band (spectrally\n\n22\n\nintegrated) measurements.\n\n23\n24\n\n2.5\n\nCloudy sky properties in the FIR\n\n25\n\n19\n\n1\n\nSo far, we have reviewed the evidence for the FIR properties of a clear- i.e. cloud-free \xe2\x80\x93\n\n2\n\natmosphere. However, atmospheric condensed phases of water vapour, especially the ice\n\n3\n\nphase, play an important role on the infrared atmospheric outgoing radiation and the energy\n\n4\n\nbalance of atmospheric layers. The fundamental importance of the ice phase is simply that to\n\n5\n\nreplace a warm Earth surface with a very cold ice cloud surface has a larger energy balance\n\n6\n\nimpact at the TOA than replacement by a low, warm liquid-phase cloud. Ice clouds in\n\n7\n\nparticular are believed to be extremely important for climate in the tropics [Liou, 1986],\n\n8\n\nbecause of their prevalence and persistence, and it has been suggested that they represent a\n\n9\n\nsignificant feedback to climate forcing [Randall et al., 1989]. Bulk radiative studies of cirrus\n\n10\n\nclouds show that they may radiatively cool or heat the upper atmosphere in the thermal\n\n11\n\ninfrared wavelengths depending upon height, geometrical and microphysical features [Slingo\n\n12\n\nand Slingo, 1988; Stephens et al., 1990; Stackhouse and Stephens, 1991].\n\n13\n14\n\nRecent studies include the publication of the scattering and absorption properties of ice clouds\n\n15\n\nfor the MIR and FIR [Yang et al (2005), and Baum et al, (2007)], and a demonstration of the\n\n16\n\nmeasurement of cloud phase using MIR and FIR observations [Turner et al (2003)]. Also,\n\n17\n\nRizzi and Mannozzi [2000] quantified the importance of the FIR contribution to the spectrum\n\n18\n\nin outgoing top of the atmosphere fluxes, as a function of increasing cloudiness. They\n\n19\n\nshowed that under clear conditions the ratio of energy emitted between 10 and 600 cm-1 to\n\n20\n\ntotal emission (computed from 10 to 2750 cm-1) lies between 0.38 for the tropical and 0.48 for\n\n21\n\nthe sub-Arctic winter standard atmospheres. The effect of cloud is to make the range below\n\n22\n\n600 cm-1 energetically more important than in the clear-sky case, with the same ratio\n\n23\n\nincreasing up to about 0.56.\n\n24\n\ncloud emission is strongly dominated by emission at FIR wavelengths.\n\nThis is because, at typical cloud-top temperatures, the cold\n\n25\n\n20\n\n1\n\nFurther studies have clarified the importance of the FIR when addressing the problem of\n\n2\n\nradiative cooling in the presence of clouds. Initial studies [Maestri and Rizzi, 2003] have\n\n3\n\nshown that flux divergence, integrated over the whole cloud depth for a tropical cirrus cloud,\n\n4\n\nreveals two well defined spectral regions: the FIR where net emission of radiation occurs, and\n\n5\n\nthe atmospheric window regions and near infrared where net absorption dominates. Therefore\n\n6\n\nthe integrated heat balance and the net diabatic effect on the cloud layer requires\n\n7\n\nconsideration of two large contributions of opposite sign.\n\n8\n9\n\n[Figure 4 near here]\n\n10\n11\n\nIn the lower panels of Figure 4, examples of vertically propagating net fluxes in the FIR and\n\n12\n\nin the 8-14 \xc2\xb5m window region, for three different tropical atmospheric conditions (clear sky,\n\n13\n\nsemi-transparent cirrus and opaque cirrus) are reported. The cirrus cloud base is at 10.5 km,\n\n14\n\nand has a thickness of 1.8 km. The ice water paths are zero, 26.7 g m-2 and 890 g m-2,\n\n15\n\nrespectively. In the upper panel the layer spectral energy balance is shown: across the layer\n\n16\n\nthere is a FIR net emission (cooling) even for clear skies, because of the strong absorption by\n\n17\n\nthe pure rotational band of water vapour. With ice cloud, this cooling is enhanced. In the\n\n18\n\nwindow region, the only significant changes of energy balance occur when cirrus is\n\n19\n\nintroduced.\n\n20\n21\n\nCloud ice water content (IWC) strongly affects the proportion of energy absorbed and emitted\n\n22\n\nby the layer, but once a cloud level and atmospheric profile are predefined, the crossover\n\n23\n\nwavenumber between cloud net absorption and net emission is well defined, quite\n\n24\n\nindependently from cloud transmittance. The atmospheric temperature profile is recognized as\n\n25\n\nthe main factor in establishing the crossover wavenumber.\n\n26\n21\n\n1\n\nMaestri and Rizzi [2003] also point out that the presence of a cloud layer changes the diabatic\n\n2\n\nheating of all layers below the cloud and observe that the atmospheric concentration of water\n\n3\n\nvapour has an important impact on the cloud\xe2\x80\x99s energy balance, since the more the atmosphere\n\n4\n\nbelow the cirrus is transparent, the more energy is absorbed by the cloud. The role of mid and\n\n5\n\nlower troposphere water vapour in absorbing FIR and window downward radiation emitted by\n\n6\n\nhigh level cirrus clouds is also highlighted, thus stressing another interaction between water\n\n7\n\nvapour and clouds.\n\n8\n9\n\nThe calculation and the observation of cloud radiative interactions in the FIR, as at all\n\n10\n\nwavelengths, is difficult. The dynamical and transient nature of cloud formation and\n\n11\n\ndestruction, the importance of knowledge of the cloud microphysical properties (especially\n\n12\n\nfor ice clouds, where ice particle shape is important), and the problem of sampling the\n\n13\n\nchanging, complex cloud field and associated radiation field, all conspire to make the problem\n\n14\n\nextremely difficult. Nevertheless, as has been demonstrated, the impact of clouds on the FIR\n\n15\n\nis very significant, and the work to date has impressed upon us the urgency of addressing the\n\n16\n\ncloud-radiation problem at these long wavelengths. Given all the uncertainties mentioned, it\n\n17\n\nis most unlikely that climate models include accurate descriptions of these processes, or of\n\n18\n\nhow they affect the climate under changing conditions. Solving this problem is of the utmost\n\n19\n\nurgency.\n\n20\n21\n\n3.\n\nThe FIR and climate: water vapour and cloud feedback\n\n22\n23\n\nAs we have seen, both water vapour and clouds have strong FIR effects on the energy balance\n\n24\n\nof the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate system. Here we review work which has attempted to improve our\n\n25\n\nquantitative understanding of how the water vapour and the cloud radiative feedback\n\n26\n\nprocesses affect climate.\n22\n\n1\n2\n\n3.1\n\nWater vapour feedback and the FIR\n\n3\n4\n\nAn excellent review of the physics of the water vapour feedback may be found in Held and\n\n5\n\nSoden [2000], in which they discuss the feedback in physical terms, and its dependence on\n\n6\n\nhumidity and temperature. Also, they discuss the impact of dynamics on the feedback\n\n7\n\nprocess, and a controversy over the sign of the feedback (see later). Many of their ideas may\n\n8\n\nbe extended to other processes than water vapour absorption.\n\n9\n10\n\nAdapting the analysis provided by Held and Soden, we may consider a balance between the\n\n11\n\nglobally averaged absorbed solar energy, or power into the system Pin , and the globally\n\n12\n\naveraged output emitted longwave radiation, Pout , as in\n\n13\n14\n15\n\n,\n\nPin = Pout + \xe2\x88\x86P\n\n{1}\n\nWhere,\nPin =\n\n16\n\nS\n(1 \xe2\x88\x92 A )\n4\n\nand\n\n{2}\n\nPout = \xcf\x83 (1 \xe2\x88\x92 g ) T s4\n\n17\n18\n\nHere, S = solar constant, \xcf\x83 = Stefan-Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s constant, A is the global albedo, Ts is the\n\n19\n\nsurface temperature, \xe2\x88\x86P is discussed below, and g is the normalised greenhouse parameter:\n\n20\n21\n22\n\ng=\n\nG\n\xcf\x83T 4 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x83T 4\n= s 4 e .\n\xcf\x83Ts4\n\xcf\x83Ts\n\nHere\n\n23\n23\n\n{3}\n\nG = \xcf\x83 (T s4 \xe2\x88\x92 Te4 )\n\n1\n\n{4}\n\n2\n3\n\nis the absolute greenhouse parameter.\n\n4\n5\n\nWe may introduce the spectral variation of both g and G by inserting the Planck radiation law\n\n6\n\n(equation {B2}) in place of the Stefan-Boltzmann law in equations {3} and {4}. If we do\n\n7\n\nthis, and calculate spectrally resolved values of G\xce\xbd (solid lines), and also the surface emission,\n\n8\n\nE\xce\xbd (broken lines: assumed to be a black body at the surface temperature, and to be described\n\n9\n\nby the Planck radiation law), we obtain the results shown in Figure 5 [Brindley and Harries,\n\n10\n\n1998]. Results are given for two model atmospheres, tropical and polar, in units of W m-2\n\n11\n\n(cm-1)-1.\n\n12\n13\n\n[Figure 5 near here]\n\n14\n15\n\nFigure 5 clearly shows the dominating effect of the FIR on the water vapour greenhouse\n\n16\n\neffect.\n\n17\n18\n\n\xce\x99n equation {1} above, the term \xe2\x88\x86P was introduced, and in passing we might comment on its\n\n19\n\nsignificance in climate research. If \xe2\x88\x86P is positive, it represents the energy stored in the\n\n20\n\nsystem, due to any processes, (an extreme example being deep ocean circulation), that causes\n\n21\n\na delay in the temperature response to solar energy absorption. If \xe2\x88\x86P is negative, this\n\n22\n\nrepresents energy lost to the system, for example, by scattering of sunlight back to space by\n\n23\n\nvolcanic aerosol. The stored energy term depends principally on ocean parameters such as\n\n24\n\ndeep ocean circulation rates and thermal mass, as well as transient parameters such as\n\n25\n\natmospheric aerosol loading, and it has been suggested recently that \xe2\x88\x86P may be measured\n24\n\n1\n\nfrom broad band TOA net fluxes (from polar orbiting satellites, see: Wielicki et al., [2002];\n\n2\n\nWong et al., [2006]; and from geostationary satellite, see Harries et al. [2005]. It is possible\n\n3\n\nthat such detections of stored energy may be better attempted using spectrally resolved\n\n4\n\nmeasurements (e.g: see Brindley and Harries [1998] and Harries et al. [2001]): this will be\n\n5\n\ndiscussed in a future paper.\n\n6\n7\n\nThe question of the magnitude of the contribution of the FIR to the total infrared greenhouse\n\n8\n\neffect in the climate system is important: if, as Figure 5 suggests, it is a significant\n\n9\n\ncomponent, then it must be treated in detail and with accuracy in climate models. In a series\n\n10\n\nof studies, Sinha and Harries [1995; 1997] used tropical and sub-arctic standard atmospheres\n\n11\n\nand a band model to simulate the OLR spectrum at the TOA, and integrated the spectrum to\n\n12\n\nestimate the FIR8 and total fluxes leaving the TOA. The principal findings are shown in\n\n13\n\nTable 1, and refer back to Figure 5.\n\n14\n15\n\n[Table 1 here]\n\n16\n17\n\nThe parameters shown in the Table for the two standard atmospheres represent the spectrally\n\n18\n\nresolved total greenhouse parameter, G\xce\xbd and the normalised greenhouse parameter, g \xce\xbd , as\n\n19\n\ndefined above. The Table also shows the change in the total outgoing longwave radiation\n\n20\n\n(OLR) due to a doubling of CO2 in the band model; and the change in water vapour amount\n\n21\n\nrequired to give the same OLR change as the doubling of CO2. As we can see, the FIR\n\n22\n\ncontribution to the total water vapour radiative forcing at wavenumbers less than 500 cm-1\n\n23\n\namounts to between 1/5 and 1/2: expressed as a fraction of the total greenhouse effect (for all\n\n24\n\nabsorbers) of the atmosphere, the fraction below 500 cm-1 lies between \xc2\xbc and 1/3\n\n25\n\ntaking a different boundary for the FIR, for example 15 \xc2\xb5m, would increase these fractions.\n\n25\n\nOf course,\n\n1\n2\n\nThis discussion of the contribution of the FIR to the total integrated OLR raises the issue of\n\n3\n\nwhether, in reverse, measurements of broadband fluxes by ERB radiometers in space could be\n\n4\n\nanalysed so as to throw light on the FIR radiative energy budget. At first it would seem a\n\n5\n\ndifficult prospect, since so many variables (surface temperature and emissivity, cloud type,\n\n6\n\nheight and extent, and atmospheric temperature and composition) all affect the balance\n\n7\n\nbetween the MIR and FIR. Nevertheless, such a study would be worthwhile, since the\n\n8\n\nincrease in our understanding of the role of the FIR could be significantly enhanced.\n\n9\n10\n\nEarlier in this section we mentioned a controversy over the sign of the water vapour feedback:\n\n11\n\nis it positive or negative? The most obvious analysis would indicate a positive feedback:\n\n12\n\nhigher temperature means more evaporation and more water vapour, which means further\n\n13\n\nwarming. However, Lindzen [1990], controversially suggested that the feedback could be\n\n14\n\nnegative, depending on the drying of the upper troposphere by descending, desiccated air. A\n\n15\n\nnumber of rebuttals of this view have since been published, which we will not review at\n\n16\n\nlength here, because it is some way from our main theme of the FIR. So, we refer to the\n\n17\n\nvaluable review of the water vapour feedback by Held and Soden [2000], where much more\n\n18\n\ndetail can be obtained. We also note in passing that the use of the Mt Pinatubo volcanic\n\n19\n\neruption as a means of demonstrating the positive feedback of water vapour, by Soden et al\n\n20\n\n[2002] was a sophisticated riposte to the Lindzen view.\n\n21\n22\n\n3.2\n\nCloud feedback and the FIR\n\n23\n24\n\nThe greenhouse effect of both water and ice clouds have been recognized to be of particular\n\n25\n\nimportance in the mid-infrared window and in the FIR regions [Maestri, 2000; Rizzi and\n8\n\nNote that in the studies reported, Sinha and Harries chose the range 0-500 cm-1 to represent the FIR.\n\n26\n\n1\n\nMaestri, 2001]. Simulations of the impact of ice clouds on the spectral greenhouse\n\n2\n\nparameters, g\xce\xbd and G\xce\xbd , are reported in Figure 6. In the plot a tropical standard atmosphere is\n\n3\n\nconsidered. Calculations of the greenhouse parameters are repeated for various values of the\n\n4\n\ncloud optical depth (and hence transmittance), values of which are provided in the upper\n\n5\n\npanel. The upper panel shows the absolute effect: as the transmittance through the ice cloud\n\n6\n\ngets smaller, so the radiance escaping to space decreases, and G\xce\xbd gets larger (equation {4}).\n\n7\n\nA strong effect is obviously revealed in the 800-1200 cm-1 window region, but a similar\n\n8\n\namount of energy is also trapped in the atmosphere in the FIR region by the cirrus cloud.\n\n9\n\nThe lower panel shows, for the same three cases, the normalised greenhouse parameter, g\xce\xbd .\n\n10\n\nThis indicates that, relative to the emission from the surface, the greenhouse trapping\n\n11\n\nincreases with wavenumber: however, in absolute terms (upper panel), the FIR is clearly very\n\n12\n\nimportant in the effect of ice clouds on the planetary radiation balance.\n\n13\n14\n\nThe upper panel of Figure 6 also shows that the spectral region near 400 cm-1 is as sensitive as\n\n15\n\nthe 750-1000 cm-1 window to the presence of ice clouds in the high atmosphere. This occurs\n\n16\n\nbecause at the heights typical of cirrus clouds [Poore et al., 1995], even the strong FIR water\n\n17\n\nvapour absorption is not strong enough to obscure the clouds when seen from space. This\n\n18\n\nwould not be the case for lower, liquid water clouds: at the lower altitudes typical of liquid\n\n19\n\nwater clouds, the FIR transmittance to space is very small, and they have little impact in the\n\n20\n\nFIR on the greenhouse effect. Further investigation [Rizzi and Maestri, 2001] of the results\n\n21\n\nshown in Figure 6 were able to demonstrate that the radiance to space depends in a complex\n\n22\n\nway on both the physical (height and thickness) and optical (effective radius, ice water mass)\n\n23\n\nice cloud parameters.\n\n24\n25\n\n[Figure 6 near here]\n\n26\n27\n\n1\n\nRizzi and Maestri [2003] also studied the FIR contribution of clouds to the radiative balance\n\n2\n\nthrough the use of the parameter known as the cloud radiative forcing (CRF) [Ramanathan,\n\n3\n\n1987; Hartmann et al., 1986; Cess and Potter, 1988; Cess et al, 1990, 1996]. The CRF can also\n\n4\n\nbe computed by differencing the clear-sky and total-sky radiative fluxes, and by using satellite\n\n5\n\nradiation budget data it is possible to estimate the effects of actual cloudiness on the TOA heat\n\n6\n\nbalance and the dependence of these effects on location and season [Hartmann et al., 1986].\n\n7\n\nCRF is especially useful in quantifying the interactions between clouds, radiation and climate at\n\n8\n\nthe TOA [Stuhlmann, 1995] since it provides an immediate picture of how much emitted\n\n9\n\nradiation is trapped and of how much solar radiation is reflected by clouds with respect to clear\n\n10\n\nsky conditions. Although cloud radiative effects do respond to greenhouse forcing as a\n\n11\n\nfeedback, nevertheless, this view of a stand-alone forcing has its merits. A positive CRF\n\n12\n\nindicates that the clouds cause a warming of the overall Earth-atmosphere system, and vice\n\n13\n\nversa [Doelling et al., 2001]. The major limitation of this parameter is that the vertical\n\n14\n\ndistribution of the cooling and warming is not dealt with. Nevertheless CRF is a fundamental\n\n15\n\nquantity needed to constrain the effects of clouds within short or long-term climate models and\n\n16\n\nshould be determined as accurately as possible [Doelling et al., 2001].\n\n17\n18\n\nDespite its theoretical simplicity, the calculation of the CRF from broadband Earth Radiation\n\n19\n\nBudget measurements is a very demanding task [Hartmann et al., 1986; Stuhlmann, 1995;\n\n20\n\nTian and Ramanathan, 2002; Futyan et al, 2005]. For example, in many tropical convective\n\n21\n\nregions the large long-wave and short-wave cloud forcing more or less compensate each\n\n22\n\nother, so that it is extremely important to be able to measure very accurately the two\n\n23\n\ncontrasting terms constituting the total CRF. Rizzi and Maestri [2003] were interested in the\n\n24\n\nFIR contribution to long-wave CRF (LCRF) in the presence of realistic clouds, focusing their\n\n25\n\nattention on the tropical and the sub Artic winter standard atmospheres. They studied the error\n\n26\n\nthat can be introduced in the estimate of LCRF when radiation is measured by broadband\n28\n\n1\n\nradiometers with an incomplete long-wave spectral coverage, since this is a common\n\n2\n\ninstrumental problem.\n\n3\n4\n\nFollowing these authors, the LCRF expressed in terms of radiance, Rt [W/m2sr], is given by\n\n5\n\nFt:\n\n6\n7\n\nFt = Rt \xe2\x88\x92 Rt\xe2\x88\x97\n\n{5}\n\n8\n9\n\nwhere the asterisk indicates a cloudy scene, and the subscript, t, denotes a perfect\n\n10\n\nmeasurement (ie the actual LCRF), extending over the whole long-wave emission spectrum.\n\n11\n\nBy analogy with equation {5}, a similar expression (Fm = Rm \xe2\x80\x93 R*m) can be written for the\n\n12\n\nLCRF derived from a broadband radiometer which is insensitive to part of the FIR emission\n\n13\n\nspectrum, for example by the use of a spectral filter. Here the subscript m stands for\n\n14\n\nmeasured. The error in LCRF due to incomplete spectral coverage is given by Ft - Fm and the\n\n15\n\nquantity D = 100*(Ft - Fm) /Ft defines the percentage fraction of energy that cannot be\n\n16\n\nmeasured for technical limitations, weighted against the real LCRF.\n\n17\n18\n\nRizzi and Maestri [2003] showed that D is always positive (except possibly in some SAW\n\n19\n\nconditions when stratus clouds are embedded into a temperature inversion), so that\n\n20\n\nuncorrected measurements from sensors with incomplete spectral coverage produce a\n\n21\n\nsystematic underestimation of the real LCRF. The value of D becomes particularly important\n\n22\n\nin presence of cirrus clouds (1 to 5% for the case considered by the authors), especially for the\n\n23\n\nhighest cirrus cloud (15.4 km in the cited paper), not an uncommon situation in the tropics.\n\n24\n25\n\nD is plotted in Figure 7 as a function of cloud transmittance at 900 cm-1 for three cases of\n\n26\n\ntropical cirrus and one of sub-arctic cirrus. It was assumed that an instrument having a filter to\n29\n\n1\n\nblock all radiation below 350 cm-1 was used. The Figure shows that for a given cloud type D\n\n2\n\ncan be considered nearly constant with transmittance (that is for various values of ice water\n\n3\n\ncontent, IWC), and this same result (albeit with different numerical values) is obtained with\n\n4\n\nother types of filters and different cut-off values. The nearly constant behaviour is obtained\n\n5\n\nsince the difference between the unmeasured part of the spectrum in clear and cloudy\n\n6\n\ncondition, due to a particular type of cloud, increases almost linearly with decreasing\n\n7\n\ntransmittance, and the rate of increase is almost the same as the rate of increase of the real\n\n8\n\nLCRF with transmittance.\n\n9\n10\n\n4.\n\nRetrieval of atmospheric composition and clouds in the FIR\n\n4.1\n\nRetrieval of water vapour profiles using the FIR\n\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\nWater vapour vertical profiling from space using the inversion of emission features in the\n\n15\n\noutgoing longwave spectrum has been limited for the past 30 years mainly to measurements\n\n16\n\nin the \xce\xbd2 water vapour vibrational-rotational band, centred at 1595 cm-1, for both operational\n\n17\n\nand research sensors. One early project which attempted to measure the water vapour profile\n\n18\n\nfrom space using the pure rotational band was the SIRS-B radiometer [Nithianandam et al.,\n\n19\n\n1993], and recent work described below has pointed to advantages that may exist using FIR\n\n20\n\ntechniques.\n\n21\n22\n\nRecently, Rizzi et al. [2002] analysed the potential water vapour retrieval performance\n\n23\n\nattainable from spectral measurements with a resolution of 0.5 cm-1 in the FIR, from 200 to\n\n24\n\n1000 cm-1. A technique known as the \xcf\x83-IASI methodology [Amato et al., 2002] was applied,\n\n25\n\nand it was found that the sensitivity of the rotational band to water vapour perturbations, as\n\n26\n\nmeasured by the matrix of the derivative of spectral radiance with respect to water vapour\n30\n\n1\n\namount (the Jacobian), may reach values 6 to 7 times greater than that exhibited using the \xce\xbd2\n\n2\n\nband: this implies greater sensitivity of the radiance to changes in water vapour amount in the\n\n3\n\nFIR than in the mid-IR.\n\n4\n5\n\nAs an example, for the case of a tropical atmosphere standard model, Figure 8 shows a mesh\n\n6\n\nsurface of the Jacobian derivative matrix, defined by\n\n7\n\nK(\xce\xbd , z) =\n\n8\n\n\xe2\x88\x82R(\xce\xbd )\n\xe2\x88\x82q(z)\n\n{6}\n\n9\n10\n\nwhere K is the Jacobian, \xce\xbd and z are wave number and altitude, respectively, R denotes the\n\n11\n\nspectral radiance and q(z) is the water vapour mixing ratio profile. In practice the kernel, K, is\n\n12\n\ncomputed for a discrete set of \xce\xbd \xe2\x89\xa1 \xce\xbd 1 ,\n\n13\n\nmatrix, K is M x N. Figure 8 illustrates the magnitude of K(\xce\xbd, h) for the pure rotational band\n\n14\n\n(top) and the \xce\xbd2 vibrational-rotational band (bottom), illustrating the much greater magnitude\n\n15\n\nof the Jacobean in the FIR. Of course, the Jacobian does not take account of the fact that\n\n16\n\nphoton energies, and therefore radiances, R, are intrinsically larger at higher wavenumbers, an\n\n17\n\neffect which must also be taken into account. Nevertheless, to demonstrate a greater intrinsic\n\n18\n\nsensitivity is of interest.\n\n,\xce\xbd M and z \xe2\x89\xa1 z1 ,\n\n, z N , so that the size of the resulting\n\n19\n20\n\n[Figure 8 near here]\n\n21\n22\n\nSince it is not immediately possible to capture all information present in a Jacobian\n\n23\n\ncomputation because of its 2-dimensional complexity, the problem of water vapour retrieval\n\n24\n\ncapability using information content analysis has been addressed by a number of authors\n\n25\n\n[Tarantola, 1987, Rodgers, 1976, Serio et al 2007]. This method also properly addresses the\n31\n\n1\n\nproblem of the accuracy of the observations, which, in turn depends on the detector\n\n2\n\ntechnology.\n\n3\n4\n\nIn order to simulate a FIR sensor retrieval performance, we need to define the following:\n\n5\n6\n\n1. A suitable set of atmospheric states to be used as reference in all the calculations.\n\n7\n\nThis basic set is used to compute an a-priori covariance matrix [Rodgers, 1976].\n\n8\n\n2. A minimum set of parameters which define a given technology, i.e. in this case an\n\n9\n\nIR/FIR spectrometer, used to record the spectral observations. The set used includes:\n\n10\n\n- the radiometric noise (used to build up the observational covariance matrix);\n\n11\n\n- the Instrumental Response Function, S(\xce\xbd), of the measuring instrument\n\n12\n\n(convolved with the infinite resolution spectrum to simulate the finite\n\n13\n\nresolution of the real spectrometer), assumed to be a Fourier transform\n\n14\n\nspectrometer.\n\n15\n\n3. A reference inverse methodology [Rodgers, 1976].\n\n16\n17\n\nItem 1: Atmospheric states.\n\n18\n19\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n20\n\nhas been used. This set has been developed at ECMWF by Chevalier [2001].\n\nA set of state vectors, which are representative of the widest atmospheric conditions,\n\n21\n22\n\nItem 2: Instrument parameters\n\n23\n24\n\nWe assume the use of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), which is defined by the\n\n25\n\nspectral range or bandwidth, S(\xce\xbd), and the radiometric noise budget. The spectral coverage is\n\n32\n\n1\n\nassumed to be 200 to 1000 cm-1; S(\xce\xbd) has been assumed to be a pure sinc function [Bell,\n\n2\n\n1972]:\n\n3\n\nS (\xce\xbd ) = 2L\n\n4\n\nsin( 2\xcf\x80\xce\xbdL)\n2\xcf\x80\xce\xbdL\n\n{7}\n\n5\n6\n\nwhere the maximum path difference of the FTS spectrometer L is chosen in such a way to be\n\n7\n\nconsistent with a spectral resolution of \xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbd = 0.5 cm-1, that is L =\n\n1\n= 1 cm .\n2\xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbd\n\n8\n9\n10\n\nThe radiometric noise budget applies at the level of a single detector, whose footprint at nadir\nis assumed to be 10 km [Palchetti et al., 2006].\n\n11\n12\n\nItem 3: Reference inverse methodology\n\n13\n14\n\nTo provide an extensive description of the inversion theory used would be beyond the scope\n\n15\n\nof this paper, and since references already exist, it is not necessary to go into details.\n\n16\n\nBasically, we move in the context of Statistical Regularization [Rodgers 1976] and derive the\n\n17\n\ninformation content tool by transforming the inverse solution to Principal Components space\n\n18\n\nvia Singular Value Decomposition [Amato et al, 1995, Carissimo et al 2005, Serio et al 2007]\n\n19\n20\n\nTo make a comparison to the retrieval performance achieved with a realistic sounder in the\n\n21\n\nmid infrared (IR), we have used the results from a recent analysis in which the performance of\n\n22\n\nthe mid infrared radiometer sounder (IR sounder) for the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG),\n\n23\n\nobserving the \xce\xbd2 vibrational band of water vapour between 1210 and 2000 cm-1, was assessed\n\n24\n\n[Grieco et al., 2004].\n\n33\n\n1\n2\n\n[Figure 9 near here]\n\n3\n4\n\nThe comparison shows that the H2O retrieval capability in the far infrared is comparable to\n\n5\n\nand sometimes slightly better than that obtained for the MTG IR sounder. This is illustrated\n\n6\n\nin Figure 9, which shows the simulated H2O retrieval accuracies for the case of the FIR\n\n7\n\nrotational band, and for the MIR vibrational band. Apart from the tropopause level, the\n\n8\n\nexpected H2O retrieval performance is better than 10% in the troposphere for both\n\n9\n\ninstruments. The FIR retrieval shows a slightly better performance than the MIR sounder in\n\n10\n\nthe tropopause/lower stratosphere region. This is to be expected because of the stronger\n\n11\n\nintensity of the rotational band lines by comparison with the \xce\xbd2 band. The water vapour\n\n12\n\naccuracy can be improved, of course, by considering FIR sounders with a larger FOV\n\n13\n\n(reduced horizontal spatial resolution), so that more photons reach the detector and the signal-\n\n14\n\nto-noise is improved. A study by Serio et al [2007] provides quantitative information on the\n\n15\n\nrelation between horizontal and vertical spatial resolution and the number of independent\n\n16\n\npieces of information that are available in the retrieval.\n\n17\n18\n\n4.2\n\nWater vapour retrieval in the presence of clouds (and vice-versa).\n\n19\n20\n\nInfrared data are frequently affected by clouds. Thus, observations must be processed for\n\n21\n\noperational data assimilation and inversion for geophysical parameters (temperature and water\n\n22\n\nvapour), either by screening to remove cloud-contaminated soundings or by a so-called\n\n23\n\nprocess of cloud clearing. It should be stressed that, for meteorological applications,\n\n24\n\noperational numerical weather prediction centres currently use cloud-screened or cloud\n\n25\n\ncleared data. This is mostly because of time processing constraints. Forward calculations in\n\n26\n\nthe presence of clouds remain time-consuming, making real time applications difficult. Cloud\n34\n\n1\n\nscreening or cloud detection is the first step in the assimilation chain of infrared radiances and\n\n2\n\nit has been proved that high spectral resolution infrared observations in the atmospheric\n\n3\n\nwindow (800 to 900 cm-1) can be effectively used for this task [Serio et al., 2000, Masiello et\n\n4\n\nal., 2002].\n\n5\n6\n\nThe cloud clearing process can increase the uncertainty in the observed spectral radiances.\n\n7\n\nHowever, the spectral radiance uncertainty is typically confined below 1 K (in terms of\n\n8\n\nbrightness temperature) for most of the cases [Rizzi, 1994, Rizzi et al., 1994, Li et al., 2005],\n\n9\n\nand the retrieval accuracy is only slightly degraded with respect to that shown in Figure 9 for\n\n10\n\nclear sky.\n\n11\n12\n\nAnother approach which is now becoming popular is to retrieve water vapour only above the\n\n13\n\ncloud [Li et al, 2007], which again takes us back to the clear sky case discussed in the\n\n14\n\nprevious section. Crucial to this method is the correct determination of the cloud top height\n\n15\n\nand temperature. The most powerful method to perform this task is the so-called CO2 slicing\n\n16\n\nmethod, which exploits the altitude sensitivity of narrow-band CO2 channels located in the\n\n17\n\nCO2 absorption band at 15 \xc2\xb5m [Chahine, 1974].\n\n18\n19\n\nFor water vapour retrieval in the upper part of the atmosphere, the limb sounding\n\n20\n\nmeasurement mode is commonly used. In this mode, we observe the atmosphere with a long\n\n21\n\nhorizontal optical path, and with this geometry of observation even optically thin (in the\n\n22\n\nvertical) clouds can significantly attenuate the atmospheric signal, and jeopardise the\n\n23\n\nsounding of the atmospheric composition. However, this effect is not the same at all\n\n24\n\nwavelengths. Figure 10 illustrates this by showing the variation of ice particle extinction\n\n25\n\ncoefficient (the sum of both absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient) as a function of\n\n26\n\nice particle size and wavenumber. The variations shown in Figure 10 suggest the possibility\n35\n\n1\n\nthat the FIR might in some cases be used to penetrate deeper into a cloud that at MIR\n\n2\n\nwavelengths. Indeed, it is possible that more detailed studies may reveal that the FIR and the\n\n3\n\nMIR have sufficiently complementary properties of absorption and scattering that they may\n\n4\n\nadvantageously be used in combination to detect the presence of clouds [Raspollini et al.,\n\n5\n\n2006; Reburn et al., 1998]. Further work is required.\n\n6\n7\n\n[Figure 10 near here]\n\n8\n9\n\nTurning to much longer wavelengths, in the millimetre wavelength region, a very useful\n\n10\n\nregion of high transparency is observed even for the most dense ice cirrus clouds. In a case\n\n11\n\nstudy performed for the MARSCHALS instrument [Oldfield et al., 2001], which observes the\n\n12\n\natmospheric emission in the millimetre wave region with a spectral resolution of 200 MHz ,\n\n13\n\nDel Bianco et al. [2007] have quantified the loss of information caused by ice clouds when\n\n14\n\nmaking atmospheric composition measurements with this instrument. They showed that the\n\n15\n\neffect of most clouds is adequately described with a model of atmospheric continuum\n\n16\n\nabsorption. In the case of optically thick clouds, retrieval errors can occur because of\n\n17\n\nscattering effects and the problem of detecting sharp discontinuities in a cloud, when\n\n18\n\nobserving with limited vertical resolution. When cloud altitude and scattering are correctly\n\n19\n\nmodelled, a limited loss of information is caused by the presence of cloud. In the worst case it\n\n20\n\nhas been shown that there is a loss of about 7% in terms of information content, relative to\n\n21\n\ncloud free conditions [Carli et al, 2007].\n\n22\n23\n\n[Figure 11 near here]\n\n24\n25\n\nObviously, whatever the observation geometry, there is a complementary issue, which is the\n\n26\n\ncharacterisation of cirrus clouds from observations of the real atmosphere in the presence of\n36\n\n1\n\nthe interfering effects due to water vapour, carbon dioxide and other absorbers. Del Bianco\n\n2\n\n[private communication, 2007] has carried out calculations of how the FIR and MIR spectra\n\n3\n\nare affected by ice crystals. Figure 11 shows some examples of such calculations for a variety\n\n4\n\nof parameters including cloud altitude, ice water path, crystal habit and phase. Frame (a)\n\n5\n\nshows clear sky, water cloud and ice cloud spectra. Frames (b) to (f) show a series of\n\n6\n\ndifference spectra, identifying how the difference signals between clear sky and cloudy skies\n\n7\n\ndepend on water phase, altitude, ice content, particle radius and shape. Clearly, there is a\n\n8\n\nlarge amount of information contained in these difference spectra, which can be used to\n\n9\n\ncharacterise clouds from spectral measurements. Yang et al (2003) were able to show that\n\n10\n\nFIR spectral signatures of ice are useful in the retrieval of ice cloud properties: for example,\n\n11\n\nthey show that the brightness temperature near 400 cm-1 is sensitive to ice crystal size, and\n\n12\n\nthat the brightness temperature difference between 250 and 560 cm-1 is sensitive to optical\n\n13\n\nthickness. However, these signals are not unambiguous, and more detailed studies are needed\n\n14\n\nto determine precisely how much information on an unknown cloud can be extracted from\n\n15\n\nFIR spectral measurements.\n\n16\n17\n\n5.\n\nObservational studies of the FIR spectrum of the atmosphere and Earth system\n\n18\n19\n\nIn this section we review experimental work on the properties of the FIR spectrum of the\n\n20\n\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. Following a short historical perspective, we describe work using\n\n21\n\ncommercial interferometers to understand the continuum absorption of water vapour, and new\n\n22\n\ninstrument developments to measure the FIR spectrum from aircraft and balloons (TAFTS,\n\n23\n\nREFIR and FIRST), and refer to efforts to develop a design for a future satellite FIR\n\n24\n\nspectrometer (REFIR).\n\n25\n26\n\n5.1\n\nEarly submillimetre and FIR investigations\n\n37\n\n1\n2\n\nWith the development of the energy-efficient technique of Fourier transform spectroscopy\n\n3\n\n[Bell, 1972] in Europe (pioneered by workers such as Jacquinot and Fellgett), the weak\n\n4\n\nphoton energies typical of the FIR became accessible when ambient temperature detectors,\n\n5\n\nsuch as the Golay cell, and the pyroelectric detector were used. Groups in the UK (National\n\n6\n\nPhysical Laboratory; Queen Mary College), France (Observatoire de Meudon; Office\n\n7\n\nNational d\xe2\x80\x99Etudes et Recherches Aeronautique), Canada (U. Calgary), Italy (U. of Florence;\n\n8\n\nthe National Research Council, CNR), and the USA (Smithsonian Astrophysical Institute;\n\n9\n\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research) began to develop Fourier spectrometers,\n\n10\n\ndetectors, and Fourier transform analytical techniques, to study the lower atmosphere (a\n\n11\n\nhindrance to astronomy at these wavelengths), and the stratosphere (which, because of the\n\n12\n\nvery high line strengths in the FIR, and very low water vapour mixing ratios, proved to be an\n\n13\n\nideal part of the atmosphere to be probed in the FIR).\n\n14\n15\n\nThe earliest work established the existence of transparent windows in the stratospheric\n\n16\n\nspectrum at submillimetre wavelengths, and a partly transparent troposphere from the surface\n\n17\n\nto space at millimetre wavelengths. Using the FIR to measure the humidity of the\n\n18\n\nstratosphere (still a controversial question at the time: was the stratosphere wet or dry?)\n\n19\n\nproved very successful [Gebbie et al., 1968, Burroughs and Harries, 1970, Harries, 1973,\n\n20\n\n1976]. With the advent of helium-cooled solid state detectors, the capability of FIR systems\n\n21\n\nincreased dramatically, and measurements at higher resolutions (down to a few hundredths of\n\n22\n\n1 cm-1) on aircraft and balloons became possible, introducing the possibility of measuring not\n\n23\n\njust the principal spectral features, due to H2O, and O2 and O3, but many other minor\n\n24\n\nconstituents, through their pure rotational spectra. Numerous experiments to study this\n\n25\n\nspectral region from aircraft [Harries et al., 1972; Bussoletti and Baluteau, 1974; Marten and\n\n26\n\nChauvel, 1975; Mankin, 1975; Carli et al., 1977] were used to study the FIR spectrum and the\n38\n\n1\n\ncomposition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Other systems were developed\n\n2\n\nfor the more exposed environment of high altitude (40 km) balloon flights, when mid-\n\n3\n\nstratosphere water vapour and other constituents were measured [Harries , 1977; Clark and\n\n4\n\nKendall, 1976; Carli et al, 1980].\n\n5\n6\n\nThe science of FIR spectroscopy in the laboratory also developed fast, with measurements of\n\n7\n\nthe quantitative positions, strengths and half-widths of spectral lines becoming available,\n\n8\n\nessential, of course, for making quantitative determinations of atmospheric concentrations.\n\n9\n\nWork on many species took place, including polar molecules like H2O, O3 and more exotic\n\n10\n\nspecies such as nitric acid HNO3 [Harries et al., 1971], as well as the collision-induced dipole\n\n11\n\nabsorption in symmetric molecules such as CO2 and N2 at high pressures [Harries, 1970].\n\n12\n13\n\nThese measurements confirmed the spectroscopic properties of the atmosphere in the FIR.\n\n14\n\nFor example, the long wavelength region from 4 to 200 cm-1 was studied by Baldecchi et al,\n\n15\n\n[1984, 1988]: this region was where most of the rotational spectra of those atmospheric\n\n16\n\nconstituents with a permanent or transient dipole moment can be observed. Figure 12 shows\n\n17\n\nan example of the high resolution atmospheric emission spectrum measured with the IBEX\n\n18\n\nballoon experiment [Carli et al., 1984] from an altitude of 38 km at the limb with a zenith\n\n19\n\nangle of 91.6\xc2\xb0. A portion of the spectrum between 45 and 65 cm-1 is displayed. The upper\n\n20\n\npanel shows a synoptic view of this 20 cm-1 spectral interval where it is possible to note some\n\n21\n\ngeneral characteristics. Water vapour is present with some prominent spectral features that are\n\n22\n\nirregularly distributed (since the water molecule is a so-called asymmetric rotor [Herzberg,\n\n23\n\n1959]). A regular pattern of triplet lines is caused by molecular oxygen. Ozone is present with\n\n24\n\nsome Q-branches that appear with a constant period and with many other ubiquitous lines.\n\n25\n\nWhen the fine structure of the spectrum is analysed (see lower panel for the expanded 61-69\n\n26\n\ncm-1 region), the contribution of several minor constituents can be observed. In this spectral\n39\n\n1\n\ninterval emission lines due to HCl (with its two isotopes), CO and OH can be observed. Other\n\n2\n\ninteresting contributions are those of some isotopes of water vapour (HDO and H2O17) and of\n\n3\n\nozone (18OOO and O18OO) as well as some rotational transitions of vibrationally excited\n\n4\n\nozone, identified with their vibrational quantum numbers.\n\n5\n6\n\n[Figure 12 near here]\n\n7\n8\n\nSeveral other features have been observed in the spectral region between 4 and 200 cm-1, in\n\n9\n\naddition to those already mentioned: these include HNO3 , N2O, NO2, HCN, ClO, HF, HBr,\n\n10\n\nHOCl, H2O2, HO2 and atomic oxygen, O. Notably missing in the FIR are the features of CO2\n\n11\n\nand N2 which do not have a permanent dipole moment, and therefore no rotational spectrum:\n\n12\n\nthese gases absorb in the FIR only under high pressures, when transient dipole moments are\n\n13\n\ninduced in the symmetric molecules by forceful inter-molecular collisions [Harries, 1970].\n\n14\n\nAnnex 1 provides a list of atmospheric constituent species which have been detected by FIR\n\n15\n\nspectroscopy in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\n\n16\n\nhave rotational transitions in the FIR, this list is by now extensive.\n\nSince all molecules possessing a dipole moment\n\n17\n18\n\nMeasurements in the FIR region have the disadvantage that the signal is intrinsically weak,\n\n19\n\nbecause the Planck function falls to low values at long wavelengths. However, there are also\n\n20\n\nadvantages in the FIR. The atmospheric emission is observed in the Rayleigh-Jeans region of\n\n21\n\nthe black-body distribution where the dependence on temperature, T, is only linear9, so that\n\n22\n\nany errors in our knowledge of the atmospheric temperature cause less error in composition\n\n23\n\nretrieval than in other regions of the black body distribution, where the dependence of\n\n24\n\nradiance on temperature goes as a much higher power of T. Also, the line strength of the\n\n25\n\nrotational features can be accurately determined from dipole moment measurements, so that\n\n40\n\n1\n\nmeasurements made with rotational spectra are intrinsically of high accuracy, and can be used\n\n2\n\nas a validation tool for the more difficult measurements made in other spectral regions\n\n3\n\n[Mencaraglia et al., 2006].\n\n4\n5\n\nThe typically weak signal in the FIR may be efficiently detected either using cryogenic\n\n6\n\ndetectors or (where suitable local oscillators exist) heterodyne techniques. The latter\n\n7\n\ntechnique is currently exploited for spaceborne observation of minor atmospheric constituent\n\n8\n\nin the millimetre and submillimetre spectral region (e.g. the Microwave Limb Sounder\n\n9\n\nexperiments: see Waters et al. [2006]).\n\n10\n11\n\n5.2\n\nGround based FIR observations and studies of continuum emission.\n\n5.2.1\n\nBackground\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nThe continuum absorption due to water vapour was described in section 2.2, and continues to\n\n16\n\nbe an un-resolved problem, meriting further work. With the advent and success of the\n\n17\n\nempirical CKD model [Clough et al 1989] for the water vapour continuum, a number of\n\n18\n\nexperimental determinations of this absorption in the laboratory and the atmosphere have\n\n19\n\ntaken place. This has led to a series of revisions to the empirical CKD model. A number of\n\n20\n\nthe field campaigns have been based on an instrument whose basic design is due to ABB\n\n21\n\nBomem Inc (ABB Bomem MR-100 series interferometer). [Knuteson et al, 2004a, 2004b].\n\n22\n\nThe instrument is now deployed in many of the American ARM (Atmospheric Radiation\n\n23\n\nMeasurement program) sites, where it is known as AERI (Atmospheric Emitted Radiance\n\n24\n\nInterferometer) [Ackerman and Stokes, 2003]. Most notable among these observations are\n\n25\n\nthose taken with the version extended in the far infrared from SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget\n9\n\nIn equation B2, if hf << kBT, then the exponential function can be simplified to 1 + hf/kBT\n\n41\n\n1\n\nof the Artic Ocean) and the North Slope of Alaska ARM Atmospheric Radiation\n\n2\n\nMeasurement) site [Tobin et al. 1999].\n\n3\n4\n\n5.2.2. Instrument Design\n\n5\n6\n\nIn its basic version, the ABB-Bomem MR100 (hereafter MR100) is an FTS with a liquid\n\n7\n\nnitrogen cooled sandwich MCT/InSb detector to cover the 500 to 5000 cm-1 spectral region.\n\n8\n\nMore precisely the detector provides sensitivity for 5 - 20 \xc2\xb5m (MCT) and 2 - 5.5 \xc2\xb5m (InSb) in\n\n9\n\ntwo separate channels. The spectral sampling is 0.4822 cm-1 for double-sided interferograms.\n\n10\n\nThe absolute infrared spectral radiance of the sky is measured and calibrated using two\n\n11\n\naccurately (\xc2\xb10.01 K) stabilized infrared black body sources. A typical measurement cycle\n\n12\n\nconsists of a sky dwell period followed by two dwell periods, one for each of the blackbodies.\n\n13\n\nThe instrument field of view is about 40 mrad. The mirror movement is effected by means of\n\n14\n\na flexi-pivot, which minimises wavefront tilt and shear.\n\n15\n16\n\n5.2.3. Campaign measurements\n\n17\n18\n\nThe MR-100 instrument has been used during the Italian phase of the European AQUA\n\n19\n\nThermodynamic Experiment (EAQUATE) [Taylor et al 2007] to acquire nearly continuous\n\n20\n\nobservations of atmospheric emitted spectral radiance in the range 500 to 2000 cm-1 [Esposito\n\n21\n\net al, 2007a]. During the campaign, atmospheric temperature and water vapour were profiled\n\n22\n\nby radiosondes, with a time sampling rate of approximately 2 hours. In addition, a microwave\n\n23\n\nradiometer was operated continuously with a time sampling rate of 5 minutes and a\n\n24\n\nceilometer was used to detect the presence of clouds, with a time sampling rate of 20 seconds.\n\n25\n\nThese additional data were used to provide the atmospheric state input to the forward model\n\n26\n\nto yield synthetic spectral radiance for comparison with the observations.\n42\n\n1\n2\n\nThe comparison was aimed at testing the reliability of state-of-art line and continuum water\n\n3\n\nvapour absorption parameters in the far infrared. An example of this comparison is provided\n\n4\n\nin Figure 13, where various editions of the HITRAN database [Rothman et al., 1998, 2003,\n\n5\n\n2005], and two version of the newest MT_CKD Clough continuum model are compared\n\n6\n\nagainst the observations. While allowing us to check the quality of state-of-art line and\n\n7\n\ncontinuum absorption parameters, Figure 13 also highlights that there are still appreciable\n\n8\n\ndifferences among the various data base versions, which, in turn, lead us to conclude that\n\n9\n\nthere is still need of research efforts towards the understanding of a portion of the spectrum\n\n10\n\nwhich plays a fundamental role in the Earth\'s radiation budget.\n\n11\n12\n\n[Figure 13 near here]\n\n13\n14\n\nA MR-100 spectrometer has recently been extended by the DIFA group and colleagues at\n\n15\n\nIMAAA10 in Basilicata, Italy, to operate at longer wavelengths by the replacement of the\n\n16\n\nusual zinc selenide beamsplitter by a silicon one, and by adding a deuterated tri-glycine\n\n17\n\nsulphate (DTGS) detector. Further studies of the continuum using this extended instrument\n\n18\n\nare planned.\n\n19\n20\n\n5.3\n\n21\n\nFourier Transform Spectrometer\n\nMeasurement of FIR heating rates with TAFTS \xe2\x80\x93 The Tropospheric Airborne\n\n22\n23\n\n5.3.1\n\n10\n\nInstrument concept\n\nIMAAA: Istituto di Metodologia per l\'Analisi Ambientale\n\n43\n\n1\n\nA novel radiometer, the Tropospheric Airborne Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TAFTS)11,\n\n2\n\nhas been developed at Imperial College to operate specifically in the FIR on aircraft\n\n3\n\nplatforms, with the capability to observe nadir and zenith radiances, and to derive heating\n\n4\n\nrates. The aim is to study the in-situ radiative properties of the upper troposphere. A general\n\n5\n\ndescription of the TAFTS instrument and performance may be found in Murray et al [2007].\n\n6\n\nAn example of early data may be found in Cox et al, [2007].\n\n7\n8\n\n5.3.2 Instrument design\n\n9\n10\n\nTAFTS is a differential, dual-input, polarising Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), of the\n\n11\n\nMartin-Puplett kind [Martin and Puplett 1969]. This type of interferometer makes\n\n12\n\nsimultaneous differential measurements of spectrally resolved radiance from two input ports.\n\n13\n\nTAFTS employs a sampling system that is particularly simple, and which also yields\n\n14\n\ndiagnostic information on the vibration environment of the instrument as it affects the optical\n\n15\n\npath (vibration is often a problem on aircraft deployments of a FTS, and can give rise to\n\n16\n\n\xe2\x80\x98ghosts\xe2\x80\x99 of real spectral features appearing in shifted spectral positions in the measured\n\n17\n\nspectra). TAFTS covers a wide spectral range at high spectral resolution: currently it operates\n\n18\n\nacross two spectral bands covering 80 to 320 cm-1 and 320 to 600 cm-1, but could operate up\n\n19\n\nto 1000 cm-1 with other detectors and optical filters. The instrument has a un-apodised\n\n20\n\nresolution of 0.1 cm-1 (see Bell [1972] for an explanation of \xe2\x80\x98apodisation\xe2\x80\x99, a process for\n\n21\n\nremoving unwanted oscillations in the spectra measured by a FTS). The optical and detector\n\n22\n\nsystem employed in TAFTS provides two differential signals within each spectral band. The\n\n23\n\ncryogenic optical design makes use of high-efficiency non-imaging components such as light\n\n24\n\npipes and concentrators. TAFTS is controlled by an on-board computer that employs a real-\n\n11\n\nFor extensive information about TAFTS, see: http://www.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk/tafts/\n\n44\n\n1\n\ntime Linux operating system. The instrument is designed to be fully autonomous or capable of\n\n2\n\nremote control via the internet. Table 2 details the instrument specifications.\n\n3\n4\n\n[Figure 14 and Table 2 near here]\n\n5\n6\n\nTAFTS comprises four units. These are: the pointing optics (scene selection including\n\n7\n\ncalibration targets); the interferometer (dual input combiner and beamsplitter, sampling laser,\n\n8\n\nmoving mirror and associated drive); the cryostat (cooled detector housing); and the\n\n9\n\nelectronics control box. Figure 14 shows a simple schematic diagram of the optical layout of\n\n10\n\nTAFTS, showing the first three of these units. Each of the two inputs can be steered to view\n\n11\n\neither a hot or ambient temperature blackbody or a sky view. The radiation from these views\n\n12\n\nare steered into the interferometer housing and combined at the polariser beam-combiner P1.\n\n13\n\nP2 is a second polariser at 45o to the first, which acts as the beamsplitter. L1, L2 and L3 are a\n\n14\n\ncombination of off-axis parabola and spherical mirrors which define the field of view and a\n\n15\n\nvirtual aperture cold stop. LN2 and He represent low-pass filters at 79 K and 4.2 K\n\n16\n\nrespectively, mounted on the radiation shields of the cryostat. P3 is a third polariser, which\n\n17\n\nacts as an analyser to separate the two complementary outputs of the interferometer [Martin\n\n18\n\nand Puplett, 1969]. Dichroic filters are used to transmit/reflect the radiation to the separate\n\n19\n\nlong-wave and short-wave detectors. These detector blocks consist of an off-axis mirror and\n\n20\n\nhyperbolic concentrator, designed to reject off-axis radiation, and an integrating cavity which\n\n21\n\nhouses the photoconductor. Further details of each of the four units are given in Murray et al.\n\n22\n\n[2007], and may be found via the web site quoted in the footnote.\n\n23\n24\n\n5.3.3\n\nLaboratory performance\n\n25\n\n45\n\n1\n\nIn order to measure the instrument spectral sensitivity and ground-based performance, TAFTS\n\n2\n\nwas placed within a N2-purged polystyrene box with free-standing liquid nitrogen sources and\n\n3\n\nwater vapour traps. The up-welling blackbody temperature was maintained at 337 K, and the\n\n4\n\ndown-welling blackbody at 304 K. Interferograms were recorded, and the corresponding\n\n5\n\nspectra computed by complex Fourier transformation. The input blackbody temperature\n\n6\n\ndifference was used to convert the raw spectral signal (a voltage) to a brightness temperature\n\n7\n\nscale, which was used to derive noise equivalent brightness temperature as a function of\n\n8\n\nfrequency from the voltage noise fluctuations: this is shown in Figure 15. Both the longwave\n\n9\n\nand shortwave spectra are the sums of 30 2-second interferometer scans, equivalent in total to\n\n10\n\na 60-second integration. The apodized spectral resolution is approximately 0.12 cm-1. The\n\n11\n\nbroad absorption features apparent in the short-wave channel (panel b) are caused by the\n\n12\n\nwindow and polariser substrate absorption (polypropylene and mylar). The increase in noise\n\n13\n\nequivalent brightness temperature towards the edges of the bands is due to falling instrument\n\n14\n\nthroughput at the edges of filters and other components.\n\n15\n16\n\n[Figure 15 near here]\n\n17\n18\n\n5.3.4\n\n19\n\nTAFTS has now been flown on a number of aircraft missions. As an example, in November\n\n20\n\nand December 2002 TAFTS participated in the EMERALD II (Egrett Microphysics\n\n21\n\nExperiment with Radiation Lidar and Dynamics in the Tropics) campaign based in Darwin,\n\n22\n\nAustralia. Atmospheric spectra were observed during an aircraft ascent from 4.6 km to 13.3\n\n23\n\nkm, and measurements of the on-board TAFTS black body calibration targets were also taken.\n\n24\n\nThe observed spectra were calibrated using laboratory calibration data, corrected for local\n\n25\n\nwater vapour absorption in the instrument, and for any drift in detector sensitivity (as its\n\n26\n\ntemperature changes during the flight), and finally averaged for a series of roughly equally\n\nFlight performance\n\n46\n\n1\n\nspaced flight levels. In order to derive the heating rate (see Box 1), the net flux in the vertical\n\n2\n\nis obtained by differencing the up- and down-welling spectra, and the vertical gradient of this\n\n3\n\nnet flux then calculated, using the observations at the different flight levels. This vertical flux\n\n4\n\ndivergence is then used to derive the heating rate in the local atmosphere, using equations\n\n5\n\n{B3} and {B4}.\n\n6\n7\n\nSome of the calibrated net radiance spectra measured during this campaign are reproduced in\n\n8\n\nFigure 16, which shows the net radiance measured at a number of flight levels between 7.5\n\n9\n\nand 13.55 km on the 19th November 2002: the heights are shown on the Figure. The\n\n10\n\nbackground slopes of these radiance spectra, of course, follow the shape of the Planck\n\n11\n\nfunction at the local air temperature. The increasing transparency of the many windows\n\n12\n\nbetween the strong water vapour lines as the aircraft flies at higher levels is clear. Bearing in\n\n13\n\nmind that the recording time for the spectra shown varies between 2 and 10 s, the signal to\n\n14\n\nnoise ratio is excellent. The heating rates have been derived from these spectra in the manner\n\n15\n\ndescribed in Box 1 and section 2.3, and an example of early data is shown in Figure 17\n\n16\n\n[Straine, 2005]. Initial comparisons with simulated heating rates show these measurements to\n\n17\n\nbe similar, except that the effect of variations with height in the vertical distribution of water\n\n18\n\nvapour causes very significant variability in the heating rates. For this reason, direct\n\n19\n\nobservations are essential to establish that we understand this sensitivity. Further work on\n\n20\n\nheating rate determination from TAFTS is being prepared for publication.\n\n21\n22\n\n[Figure 16 near here]\n\n23\n24\n\n[Figure 17 near here]\n\n25\n26\n\n5.4\n\nREFIR - Radiation explorer in the far infrared\n\n47\n\n1\n2\n\n5.4.1\n\nInstrument concept\n\n3\n4\n\nA European consortium has proposed the flight of a FIR spectrometer plus ancillary\n\n5\n\ninstrumentation in low Earth orbit. The concept of the REFIR space mission was developed\n\n6\n\nto address several important issues relating the climate and the hydrological cycle, exploiting\n\n7\n\nthe FIR [Rizzi et al., 2000; Rizzi et al., 2001].\n\n8\n9\n\nIn the initial REFIR design, the FTS was a polarizing interferometer with a novel optical\n\n10\n\nscheme with double-port configuration (Figure 18) that is capable of resolving the upwelling\n\n11\n\nradiation from the Earth, seen from the low Earth orbit, with sufficient spectral resolution (0.5\n\n12\n\ncm-1) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR>100) in broadband operations (100-1100 cm-1), to allow\n\n13\n\nscientific investigations of the atmosphere and climate.\n\n14\n15\n\n[Figure 18 near here]\n\n16\n17\n\nFigure 18 shows the optical configuration, described in more detail in Carli et al., [1999],\n\n18\n\nwhich optimises the reliability of the spectrometer in particular for long lifetime space\n\n19\n\napplications, and its performance for ambient temperature operations. Two prototypes of the\n\n20\n\nREFIR FTS have been developed for laboratory testing and use in field operations [Serio et\n\n21\n\nal.,, 2002]: REFIR-BB (Breadboard) for ground-based campaigns [Palchetti et al., 2005] and\n\n22\n\nREFIR-PAD (Prototype for Applications and Development) for air-borne campaigns\n\n23\n\n[Bianchini, 2006 a and b].\n\n24\n25\n\n5.4.2\n\nPrototype characteristics and performance\n\n26\n48\n\n1\n\nThe two prototypes have been used to study different solutions. The main design requirement\n\n2\n\nof wideband coverage with uncooled operation can be met by using efficient wideband beam\n\n3\n\nsplitters (BS) and high-performance room-temperature detectors. The detectors chosen were\n\n4\n\ndoped tri-glycine sulphate (DLATGS) pyroelectric effect detectors, with low noise equivalent\n\n5\n\nspectral radiance (NESR). Polariser BS were developed and tested, but efficiency was found\n\n6\n\nto be poor, especially above 700 cm-1. Best performances were obtained with amplitude BS\n\n7\n\n(using a thin germanium (Ge) film deposited on Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)\n\n8\n\nmembrane) in combination with the pyroelectric detectors. In this case, the input/output\n\n9\n\npolariser (the one at 45\xc2\xb0 in Figure 18) is removed and the interferometer configuration\n\n10\n\nbecomes the Mach-Zehnder scheme [Jenkins and White, 1981]. The other optical\n\n11\n\ncharacteristics, such as the double-port configuration, and the full tilt compensation of the\n\n12\n\nmoving mirror are maintained.\n\n13\n14\n\nTable 3 provides a summary of the main parameters that characterise the prototype design.\n\n15\n16\n\n[Table 3 near here]\n\n17\n18\n\nBoth prototypes were characterised under vacuum and in laboratory conditions. The noise was\n\n19\n\ndominated by the detector component and was found to be constant under different working\n\n20\n\nconditions. Figure 19 shows, for instance, the NESR measured under vacuum with REFIR-\n\n21\n\nPAD (operated with Ge-coated PET BS and 30 s acquisition time) and REFIR-BB (operated\n\n22\n\nwith polarising BS and 120 s acquisition time). This performance was also obtained during\n\n23\n\nthe field operations described in the following section.\n\n24\n25\n\n[Figure 19 near here]\n\n26\n49\n\n1\n\n5.4.3\n\nGround based and stratospheric balloon observations\n\n2\n3\n\nThe REFIR-BB instrument was tested in June 2004 in a ground-based field campaign held at\n\n4\n\nToppo di Castegrande at 1285 m altitude in South Italy [Esposito, 2007a and b]. The\n\n5\n\ndownward atmospheric emission spectrum was measured and compared with that measured\n\n6\n\nby a commercial FTS (BOMEM MR100) measuring above 500cm-1, and is shown in Figure\n\n7\n\n20. This shows the atmosphere to be opaque below about 450 cm-1, so that radiance curve\n\n8\n\nfollows the Planck radiation law for some local temperature. Between 450 and 620 cm-1 the\n\n9\n\npartially transparent window between the water vapour pure rotational band and the CO2 \xce\xbd2\n\n10\n\nband shows some transparency, before the intense centre of the \xce\xbd2 band again causes the\n\n11\n\natmosphere to be opaque. On the high frequency side of the \xce\xbd2 band the downwelling\n\n12\n\nradiation rapidly falls to much lower intensity in the atmospheric window. The lower panel of\n\n13\n\nFigure 20 shows that the two measured spectra agree to within about \xc2\xb1 5% error.\n\n14\n15\n\n[Figure 20 near here]\n\n16\n17\n\nThe measurement was simulated for clear sky using the Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer\n\n18\n\nModel (LBLRTM: See Clough et al, [1992]; Clough and Iacono, [1995]), which was used to\n\n19\n\ncompute spectra based on water vapour and temperature vertical profiles measured by\n\n20\n\nradiosonde observations during the mountain observations.\n\n21\n22\n\n[Figure 21 near here]\n\n23\n24\n\nFigure 21 shows the result expressed in terms of brightness temperature (BT), for the\n\n25\n\nexpanded spectral band 500-650 cm-1. This result demonstrates that REFIR-BB is able to\n\n26\n\naccurately measure the spectral structure in the water vapour rotational band from ground50\n\n1\n\nbased observations. Thus, this first attempt seems to demonstrate that the REFIR concept,\n\n2\n\nusing un-cooled components is feasible. This is a realisation of great importance to the\n\n3\n\nfeasibility of a future FIR satellite experiment.\n\n4\n5\n\nREFIR-PAD was integrated in 2004 on board a gondola belonging to the Laboratoire de\n\n6\n\nPhysique Moleculaire pour l\'Atmosphere et l\'Astrophysique (LPMAA-CNRS, France), which\n\n7\n\nalso carried the balloon-borne simulator of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer\n\n8\n\n(IASI) instrument. The instruments were flown for the first time on the 30th of June, 2005\n\n9\n\nfrom the Timon airfield, near Teresina, located in the North-East Brazil (5\xc2\xb05\'S, 42\xc2\xb052\' W).\n\n10\n\nThe flight reached the mean floating altitude of 34 km for about 8 h, and a total of 1080\n\n11\n\nspectra of the upwelling atmospheric emission spectrum were measured.\n\n12\n13\n\nFigure 22 shows a typical result and the comparison with the measurement of the IASI-\n\n14\n\nballoon prototype sharing the same platform and covering the spectral range above 650 cm-1.\n\n15\n\nThe results [Palchetti et al., 2006; Bianchini et al., 2006a and b] indicate agreement within a\n\n16\n\nfew percent between the observation and the simulation, and therefore confirm that the\n\n17\n\ndifferent components of the Earth\'s OLR, including the FIR, can be detected with a single\n\n18\n\nuncooled instrument using uncooled detectors, with a NESR of about 2 mW (m2 sr cm-1)-1\n\n19\n\n(see Figure 19), and an absolute calibration error which is less than 0.5 K at 280 K.\n\n20\n21\n\n[Figure 22 near here]\n\n22\n23\n\nThese developments and results for REFIR clearly indicate that the feasibility is very high of\n\n24\n\ndeveloping a FIR spectrometer with moderately high spectral resolution (0.25 cm-1: see Table\n\n25\n\n3) for accurate measurements of the FIR spectrum of the Earth from space.\n\n26\n51\n\n1\n\n5.5\n\nThe Far-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Tropsophere (FIRST) Instrument\n\n5.5.1\n\nInstrument Concept\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nThe FIRST instrument was developed by the NASA Langley Research Center, USA, in\n\n6\n\npartnership with the Space Dynamics Laboratory (Utah State University) and the Harvard\n\n7\n\nSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, both also from the USA: the project was funded by\n\n8\n\nNASA. FIRST is a Michelson Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), designed to\n\n9\n\ndemonstrate the ability to measure the spectrum between 1000 and 100 cm-1 (10 to 100 \xc2\xb5m)\n\n10\n\nglobally on a daily basis at high spatial resolution (10 km from low earth orbit), high spectral\n\n11\n\nresolution (0.625 cm-1), and high temporal resolution (one spectrum every 1.4 sec), on a\n\n12\n\nsingle focal plane. A critical aspect of the FIRST design is the ability to measure the spectrum\n\n13\n\nbetween 10 and 15 \xc2\xb5m in addition to the far-IR spectrum from 15 to 100 \xc2\xb5m. The former\n\n14\n\ninterval allows for direct comparison with conventional mid-infrared spectral sensors for the\n\n15\n\npurpose of calibration and validation, which is essential for confidence in the calibration of\n\n16\n\nthe far-IR part of the spectrum for which accurate radiometric standards are not as well-\n\n17\n\ndeveloped.\n\n18\n19\n\n5.5.2\n\nInstrument Design\n\n20\n21\n\nThe FIRST instrument consists of a scene select mirror, the FTS, aft optics, a detector\n\n22\n\nassembly, and associated electronics [Mlynczak et al., 2005]. The FTS and aft optics are\n\n23\n\ncooled to ~180 K by liquid nitrogen, to reduce background and simulate spacecraft\n\n24\n\nconditions. The detectors are cooled to 4.2 K, and the rest of the instrument is at ambient\n\n25\n\ntemperature. Thin polypropylene windows isolate the cold FTS optics from the scene select\n\n26\n\nmirror and from the detector cryostat. During balloon flights the scene select mirror alternates\n52\n\n1\n\nbetween a nadir view of the Earth, a high elevation angle space view that is used to estimate\n\n2\n\ninstrument background, and an ambient-temperature blackbody calibration source. The FTS is\n\n3\n\na compact plane mirror Michelson interferometer that achieves very high throughput (0.47\n\n4\n\ncm2 sr) with a modest 7 cm diameter beam. Broadband response (50-2000 cm-1) is made\n\n5\n\npossible by a bilayer thin-film beamsplitter. FTS scanning and detector sampling are\n\n6\n\ncontrolled by a separate metrology laser interferometer that monitors the position of the scan\n\n7\n\nmirror. Interferometer alignment (for both the infrared and laser interferometers) can be\n\n8\n\nadjusted if necessary during the balloon flight by remotely controlling the tip and tilt of the\n\n9\n\nnon-scanning interferometer mirrors.\n\n10\n11\n\nThe FTS scans over optical path differences of \xc2\xb1 0.8 cm to achieve the nominal unapodized\n\n12\n\nresolution of 0.625 cm-1; the scan time varies from 1.4 to 8.5 s, depending on the detector\n\n13\n\nsample interval. Trimming and centering the interferograms reduces the realized unapodized\n\n14\n\nresolution to 0.643 cm-1, which is the resolution of all the FIRST data presented in this paper.\n\n15\n\nThe aft optics focus the collimated FTS output onto an array of Winston cone concentrators,\n\n16\n\ncoupled to discrete silicon bolometers in individual integrating cavities. The focal plane is\n\n17\n\n37.5 x 37.5 mm, large enough for a 10x10 array of cones and detectors, although for the\n\n18\n\ndemonstration flight the focal plane was populated with a total of 10 cones (2 in each corner\n\n19\n\nand 2 in the center.) The focal plane is sized to demonstrate the technology required to obtain\n\n20\n\ndaily global coverage from a cross-track scanning instrument on an orbiting satellite. The 100\n\n21\n\ndetector focal plane, with each detector recording a spectrum every 1.4 seconds, and scanned\n\n22\n\n\xc2\xb1 48 deg from nadir, would achieve daily global coverage, approximately 5 million spectra\n\n23\n\nper day, from a low-earth orbiting satellite.\n\n24\n25\n\nTo simulate the space observation configuration, FIRST was designed to operate from a\n\n26\n\ngondola on a high altitude balloon. The instrument first flew on June 7, 2005, and achieved an\n53\n\n1\n\naltitude of 28 km, lifted by an 11 million cubic foot helium-filled balloon. The results from\n\n2\n\nthis flight are reported by Mlynczak et al. [2006]. A second flight occurred on September 18,\n\n3\n\n2006, and achieved an altitude of 33 km. Both flights were successful in recording\n\n4\n\napproximately 6 hours of data at the balloon float altitude, simulating operation in and\n\n5\n\nobservations from a space-like environment. The flights occurred from the NASA Columbia\n\n6\n\nScientific Balloon Facility located in Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. In addition, both flights\n\n7\n\noccurred with a simultaneous overpass of the NASA Aqua satellite at approximately 2:00\n\n8\n\np.m. local time, offering the opportunity to compare directly spectra measured by the AIRS\n\n9\n\ninstrument in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum common to both sensors, and to compare\n\n10\n\nthe measured far-IR spectrum with those computed from AIRS temperature and moisture\n\n11\n\nprofiles. With the exception of the latter part of the 2006 flight, both flights observed clear-\n\n12\n\nsky conditions.\n\n13\n14\n\n[Figure 23 near here]\n\n15\n16\n\nFigure 23 shows a radiance spectrum recorded by FIRST from the June, 2005 flight. The\n\n17\n\nspectrum clearly shows the complex spectral structure of the far-IR (see earlier in this paper)\n\n18\n\nwith alternating regions of strong and weak lines, evidenced by the variation in radiance (or\n\n19\n\nequivalently, in the brightness temperature) of the lines. The spectrum covers the spectral\n\n20\n\nregion from approximately 2000 cm-1 (5 \xc2\xb5m) to wavenumbers less than 100 cm-1. There are\n\n21\n\nsome gaps in the spectrum which correspond to regions in which the FIRST beamsplitter\n\n22\n\nexhibits significant absorption, and whose effects have not yet been corrected. Otherwise,\n\n23\n\nFigure 23 confirms not only the complexity of the far-IR structure, but also shows the ability\n\n24\n\nof the instrument to observe essentially the entirely energetically significant infrared spectrum\n\n25\n\nof the Earth and its atmosphere between 5 and 100 \xc2\xb5m.\n\n26\n54\n\n1\n\n[Figure 24 near here]\n\n2\n3\n\nFigure 24 presents a comparison of a FIRST brightness temperature spectrum and a spectrum\n\n4\n\nfrom the AIRS instrument recorded during the June 2005 flight. The agreement between the\n\n5\n\ntwo spectra, typically to within 1-2 K, demonstrates remarkable consistency between the two\n\n6\n\nsensors, especially considering that from balloon flight altitude the FIRST footprint is about\n\n7\n\n200 meters diameter while the AIRS sensor is 14 km diameter, nearly 5000 times larger than\n\n8\n\nFIRST. The comparison illustrated here validates the calibration of the FIRST sensor.\n\n9\n10\n\n[Figure 25 near here]\n\n11\n12\n\nIn Figure 25 we show far-IR spectra recorded about 2 p.m. local time from the 2005 and 2006\n\n13\n\nflights. The radiances recorded in 2006 are clearly smaller than in 2005 from 400 to 600 cm-1,\n\n14\n\nby as much as 15% (see black difference spectrum). Based on the brightness temperatures in\n\n15\n\nFigure 23, the radiation in this interval comes from the lower troposphere between 600 and\n\n16\n\n850 hPa. The temperature and moisture profiles recorded by the AIRS instrument\n\n17\n\nsimultaneously with the FIRST spectra indicate that the lower troposphere between 700 and\n\n18\n\n850 hPa is 5 to 25 K colder during 2006 than in 2005, while the mass mixing ratios of water\n\n19\n\nvapor are slightly larger. At 600 cm-1, a decrease of 15 K (from 270 K) results in a decrease in\n\n20\n\nradiance of approximately 20%. We therefore attribute the smaller radiances observed in 2006\n\n21\n\nprimarily to a cooler lower troposphere.\n\n22\n23\n\nThe spectra from both FIRST flights have been processed and approximately 16,000 nearly\n\n24\n\ncontiguous, nadir view spectra of the Earth are now available (approximately 9000 spectra\n\n25\n\nfrom the 2005 flight and 7000 spectra from the 2006 flight). The spectra may be obtained\n\n26\n\nfrom one of the authors (MGM).\n55\n\n1\n2\n\n6.\n\nThe future\n\n3\n4\n\nWe have seen from this review that the Earth is, indeed, a far infrared planet. Because of the\n\n5\n\nheavily absorbing atmosphere at FIR wavelengths, the energy that is emitted to space comes\n\n6\n\nfrom layers well above the surface, which are colder than the surface. Because the planet\n\n7\n\npresents a colder emission temperature to space, so the peak black body energy is emitted at\n\n8\n\nlonger wavelengths, further into the FIR, than the emission from the surface. Conversely, the\n\n9\n\nopacity of the atmosphere in the FIR is a major contributory process in keeping our planet\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n10\n\nsurface far more comfortable for mankind than otherwise. While it is unnecessary to define a\n\n11\n\nspecific arbitrary border between the FIR and elsewhere in the IR, it is vital to recognise that\n\n12\n\nto fully understand the energy budget of the Earth, and to fully exploit the spectrum for\n\n13\n\nremote sounding, a better knowledge of the longwave part of the spectrum, the FIR, is\n\n14\n\nmandatory.\n\n15\n16\n\nUp to recent times, our knowledge of the FIR, and our ability to explore the region, in the\n\n17\n\nlaboratory, in the field and in space, has been limited. However, as this review has shown, the\n\n18\n\nlast decade or two has been a period of major progress, in spectroscopy, in radiometry, in\n\n19\n\ntechnology, and in measurements on the real atmosphere. We are now achieving\n\n20\n\nmeasurements in the FIR with differing configurations (balloon, aircraft and ground based)\n\n21\n\nthat have a spectral resolution suitable for the observation of the atmospheric features, over a\n\n22\n\nwide spectral range, and that are suitable for the characterisation of the radiation budget in\n\n23\n\nclear skies, and in the presence of clouds. Preliminary comparisons of the measurements with\n\n24\n\nmodels show that we have a good understanding of the radiative transfer in this spectral\n\n25\n\nregion.\n\n26\n56\n\n1\n\nNow, as we have seen in this review, we have several new instruments (TAFTS, REFIR,\n\n2\n\nFIRST) that are capable of observing the far-IR from suborbital (aircraft and balloon)\n\n3\n\nplatforms. These instruments have also operated from the ground, observing in the zenith\n\n4\n\nview the downwelling radiation from the atmosphere. Further experiments are planned from\n\n5\n\naircraft, balloons, and the surface (especially at cold sites, near the poles, or on mountains).\n\n6\n\nWe are also using these instrumental developments to set the scene for future FIR\n\n7\n\nspectrometers that can be flown as part of all-IR instruments, in space.\n\n8\n\nexperimental difficulties, of course. We need more efficient, un-cooled detectors for the FIR,\n\n9\n\nto remove the inconvenience of using liquid cryogens; more use of advanced cooling engines,\n\n10\n\nwhen cooling is unavoidable; beam-splitter technology has some way to go to maximise\n\n11\n\nefficiency; and there is always the hope of new, more efficient spectrometer designs.\n\nThere are still\n\n12\n13\n\nOf course, scientific problems also remain. One of the most obvious spectroscopic problems\n\n14\n\nthat needs much further work is that of the water vapour continuum: this effect is still the\n\n15\n\nmajor source of uncertainty in gaseous radiative transfer in the FIR. Because models for\n\n16\n\ncontinuum absorption are constrained by laboratory and atmospheric measurements, it is\n\n17\n\nimportant to improve the quantity and quality of spectrally resolved observation in the H2O\n\n18\n\nrotational band. Along this line there are programmes in both Italy (the ECOWAR12 project)\n\n19\n\nand the UK (the CAVIAR13 project) which seek to make a concerted effort though laboratory\n\n20\n\nand field measurements, theory and modelling, to put our understanding of this phenomenon\n\n21\n\non a much firmer basis.\n\n22\n\n12\n\nECOWAR: Earth Cooling by Water Vapour Radiation: see: www.difa.unibas.it\n\n13\n\nCAVIAR: Continuum Absorption at Infrared wavelengths and its Atmospheric Relevance: see:\nhttp://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~sws01ivp/\n\n57\n\n1\n\nA further scientific and observational problem is that we need to disentangle the interference\n\n2\n\nbetween gas and cloud properties through a chain of validation activities. With a well\n\n3\n\ncalibrated instrument it will be possible to complete the on-going assessment of the\n\n4\n\nspectroscopy of the clear atmosphere (line strengths; pressure broadening coefficients; line\n\n5\n\nmixing effects; water vapour continuum). While cloud properties have been mainly derived\n\n6\n\nfrom the mid infrared, Evans et al. [1999] have demonstrated that complementary information\n\n7\n\non cloud properties can be obtained in the very FIR (sub-millimetre) region. Spectrally\n\n8\n\nresolved observations of the cloud in a broad spectral band that includes the FIR could\n\n9\n\nprovide exhaustive information on cloud composition, phase, altitude, IWP and equivalent\n\n10\n\nparticle size. The problem of cirrus cloud studies is twofold: to characterise their climatology,\n\n11\n\nand to verify the mechanisms that govern the radiative exchange of the different types of cirri.\n\n12\n\nIn both cases field measurements are needed and observations in the FIR can provide a new\n\n13\n\nand powerful measurement capability which fills a long due observation requirement.\n\n14\n15\n\nWe have shown through this review that, as a result of the research described, we now know\n\n16\n\nfar more than even just a decade ago about how to make measurements on the real\n\n17\n\natmosphere, and how to start the job of disentangling the absorption and emission by\n\n18\n\nmolecules, and the corresponding processes in clouds. We know more about how the FIR\n\n19\n\ncontributes to the TOA energy balance of the Earth, and the role that water vapour and ice\n\n20\n\nclouds play in that balance. Knowing about these processes means that we are closer to being\n\n21\n\nable to understand more accurately how global warming might affect the Earth. Finally, we\n\n22\n\nhave a much better idea about how to build the sensitive instruments that we need, and can\n\n23\n\nnow start to look forward with more expertise than before to the prospect of making\n\n24\n\nmeasurements of our planet in the FIR from space.\n\n25\n\n58\n\n1\n\nTurning to the future, we note that it has been approximately 30 years since the last spectra of\n\n2\n\nthe Earth at wavelengths longer than 15 \xc2\xb5m were recorded from an instrument on an orbiting\n\n3\n\nsatellite [Spankuch and Dohler, 1985], and nearly four decades since the Nimbus IV satellite\n\n4\n\nproduced such amazing Earth IR emission spectra [Hanel et al., 1970; 1971]. In that time the\n\n5\n\nimportance of the far-IR has been fully realized, especially with respect to the role it plays in\n\n6\n\nclimate, and also in offering the possibility for the remote sensing of cirrus optical properties\n\n7\n\nfrom space.\n\n8\n9\n\nFor space based observations it now seems obvious that we must monitor our planet\xe2\x80\x99s state in\n\n10\n\nthe FIR: a far-IR instrument should be flown as soon as possible. The recent Decadal Survey\n\n11\n\n[National Research Council, 2007] conducted by the U. S. National Research Council\n\n12\n\nrecommends as its highest priority a mission with an instrument capable of covering 200 to\n\n13\n\n2000 cm-1 (5 to 50 \xc2\xb5m) with a 1 cm-1 spectral resolution. The instrument must be\n\n14\n\nexceptionally well-calibrated (and stable) to detect small changes with time in the spectral\n\n15\n\ndistribution of outgoing longwave radiation. After many years of investment we are on the\n\n16\n\ndoorstep of a far more penetrating understanding of the FIR properties of our Earth, and of\n\n17\n\nrealizing a measurement from space that is destined to revolutionize our knowledge of the\n\n18\n\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s climate system.\n\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\n59\n\n1\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n2\n3\n\nMany people have contributed to this review, in a variety of ways, and we acknowledge these\n\n4\n\nimportant contributions.
