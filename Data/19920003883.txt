Its purposes are\nobservation of cataclysmic events such as hurricanes, typhoons, and regional\nweather phenomena; day and night observations of regional weather; relay of\nmeteorological observation data from surface collection points (ships, buoys\nand weather stations) to the Data Processing Center in Japan; and transmission\nof processing imaging data for facsimile reproduction of distribution points\nin the Western Pacific area.\n\nB.\n\nFLIGHT PROFILE\n\nThe GMS-5 satellite will be launched from Tanegashima Space Center\n(TaSC) in southern Japan by a type H-I1 launch vehicle. The mission has been\ndesigned to follow the conventional injection sequence; i.e., parking orbit,\n\n14-1\n\n8\na"\n\n870-14, Rev. AF\n\ntransfer orbit, and near-synchronous orbit. Attitude maneuvers will be\nperformed to orient the spacecraft to the correct attitude prior to the Apogee\nKick Motor (AKM) firing, which will occur at the 2nd (nominal), or the 4th\n(contingency) apogee. After AKM firing, drift phase orbital and attitude\nmaneuvers will be performed to place the spacecraft at its final geostationary\nposition.\n\nC.\n\nCOVERAGE\nThe DSN will support the transfer and drift orbit mission phases.\nCoverage Goals\n\n1.\n\nThe coverage will consist of the 26-m antennas as prime and the 34m antenna at Madrid as backup support for launch through drift orbit. Maximum\nsupport will consist of two 8-hour tracks per station for a 7-day period, plus\n23 days of contingency support from all complexes.\n\n2.\n\nNetwork Support\nThe support provided by the DSN is indicated in the following\n\ntable :\n\nSvstem\n\nMadrid\n61 63 66\n\nCanberra\n\nGoldstone\n12 14 15 16\n\n42 43 45 46\n\nS-band TLM\n\nP\n\nP\n\nB\n\nP\n\nS-band CMD\n\nP\n\nP\n\nB\n\nP\n\nS-band TRK\n\nP\n\nP\n\nB\n\nP\n\nNOTE: P\nB\n\nD.\n\n=\n=\n\nPrime\nBackup\n\nFREQUENCY ASSIGNMENTS\nFrequencies are allocated according to the following table:\nDown;link ( M H d\n\nPolarization\n\nSvstem\n\nnk (MHz)\n\nS-band TLM\n\nN/A\n\nTBS\n\nVertical Linear\nParallel\n\nS-band CMD\n\nTBS\n\nN/A\n\nVertical Linear\nParallel\n\nS-band TRK\n\nTBS\n\nTBS\n\nVertical Linear\nParallel\n\n14-2\n\n870-14, Rev.
