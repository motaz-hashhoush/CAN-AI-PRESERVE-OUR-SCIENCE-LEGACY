It reviews some significant successes in space transportation, exploration and science accomplished during 2009, and it reviews some of the places that are available for exploration in the near term and the specific missions that NASA has assigned to Marshall. It also reviews the project lifecycle management model, that is designed to reduce undefined, but known, risks. It also demonstrates the sustainable long-term program of block upgrades that contribute to long-term success of programs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100025527, "endDate": "2010-05-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of the Army", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8b3c72895b854b5aae250b6e08eca565", "id": "3b1bbad36d664d5baf1f0e826d1b5c5d"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8b3c72895b854b5aae250b6e08eca565", "id": "48e3b16b152648279ecd9f78cd0f9699"}], "name": "2nd Annual NASA/Army Systems and Software Engineering Forum: Challenges of Complex Systems", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "8b3c72895b854b5aae250b6e08eca565", "startDate": "2010-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100025527, "id": "473ef188486e4f34b1c00ab962f79826", "publicationDate": "2010-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100025527.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100025527/downloads/20100025527.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100025527/downloads/20100025527.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100025527/downloads/20100025527.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
