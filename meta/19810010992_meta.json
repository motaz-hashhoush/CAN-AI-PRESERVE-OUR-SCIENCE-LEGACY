Experiments were conducted as a function of snow depth, wetness, and surface roughness. The acquired data were used to model the backscattering coefficient in terms of snow and underlying soil parameters. The results indicate that the radar return (1) increase with increasing water equivalent; (2) decrease with increasing wetness; (3) is sensitive to the snow surface roughness only when the snow is wet;(4) is sensitive to the state (frozen or thawed) of the underlying soil if the snow is dry; and (5) is repetitive from one site to another and from one season to the next. Additionally, the measurements indicate the multifrequency observation or day-night observations may potentially provide the means for monitoring snow water equivalent, snow wetness, and the soil state.", "title": "Radar observation of snowpacks", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T02:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810010992, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stiles, W.
