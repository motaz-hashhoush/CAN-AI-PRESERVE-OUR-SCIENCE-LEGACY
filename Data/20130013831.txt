b"Electronics/Computers\nSoftware Defined Radio With Parallelized Software Architecture\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThis software implements softwaredefined radio procession over multicore, multi-CPU systems in a way that\nmaximizes the use of CPU resources in\nthe system. The software treats each\nprocessing step in either a communications or navigation modulator or demodulator system as an independent,\nthreaded block. Each threaded block is\ndefined with a programmable number\nof input or output buffers; these\nbuffers are implemented using POSIX\npipes. In addition, each threaded block\n\nis assigned a unique thread upon block\ninstallation. A modulator or demodulator system is built by assembly of the\nthreaded blocks into a flow graph,\nwhich assembles the processing blocks\nto accomplish the desired signal processing. This software architecture allows the software to scale effortlessly\nbetween single CPU/single-core computers or multi-CPU/multi-core computers without recompilation.\nNASA spaceflight and ground communications systems currently rely ex-\n\nclusively on ASICs or FPGAs. This software allows low- and medium-bandwidth\n(100 bps to \xe2\x89\x8850 Mbps) software defined\nradios to be designed and implemented\nsolely in C/C++ software, while lowering\ndevelopment costs and facilitating reuse\nand extensibility.\nThis work was done by Greg Heckler of\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1).\nGSC-16442-1\n\nCompact Radar Transceiver With Included Calibration\nVolume and weight are reduced without performance penalties.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThe Digital Beamforming Synthetic\nAperture Radar (DBSAR) is an eight-channel phased array radar system that employs\nsolid-state radar transceivers, a microstrip\npatch antenna, and a reconfigurable waveform generator and processor unit. The\noriginal DBSAR transceiver design utilizes\nconnectorized electronic components that\ntend to be physically large and heavy. To\nachieve increased functionality in a smaller\nvolume, PCB (printed circuit board) transceivers were designed to replace the large\nconnectorized transceivers.\nOne of the most challenging problems\ndesigning the transceivers in a PCB format was achieving proper performance\nin the calibration path. For a radar loopback calibration path, a portion of the\ntransmit signal is coupled out of the antenna feed and fed back into the receiver.\nThis is achieved using passive components for stability and repeatability. Some\nsignal also leaks through the receive path.\nAs these two signal paths are correlated\nvia an unpredictable phase, the leakage\nthrough the receive path during transmit\nmust be 30 dB below the calibration path.\nFor DBSAR\xe2\x80\x99s design, this requirement\ncalled for a 100-dB isolation in the receiver path during transmit.\nA total of 16 solid-state L-band transceivers on a PCB format were designed.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2013\n\nThe transceivers include frequency conversion stages, T/R switching, and a calibration path capable of measuring the\ntransmit power-receiver gain product\nduring transmit for pulse-by-pulse calibration or matched filtering. In particular, this calibration path achieves 100-dB\n\nisolation between the transmitted signal\nand the low-noise amplifier through the\nuse of a switching network and a section\nof physical walls achieving attenuation of\nradiated leakage.\nThe transceivers were designed in microstrip PCBs with lumped elements and\n\nDBSAR's New Transceiver Architecture will enable the implementation and demonstration of the\nnext-generation digital beamfoming synthetic aperture radar, and help advance the technology for\ninfusion in future Earth science and planetary missions.\n\n9\n\n"
