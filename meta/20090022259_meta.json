The coatings chemically remove organic contaminants and leave no residue. The photocatalyst will not negatively affect other coating properties, especially corrosion resistance. Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is an extremely popular photocatalyst because of its chemical stability, nontoxicity, and low cost. TiO2 is commonly used in the photocatalytic oxidation of organic matter or pollutants in the gas and liquid phases. However, TiO2 does have some drawbacks. It has limited light absorption because of its large band-gap and suffers from a photonic efficiency of less than 10 percent for organic degradation. Dopants can lower the band-gap and improve efficiency. Since the photocatalytically active form of TiO2 is a nanocrystalline powder, it can be difficult to make a robust coating with enough catalyst loading to be effective. Photocatalysts become active when certain light energy is absorbed. When photons with an energy greater than the band-gap, Eg, (wavelengths shorter than 400 nm) impinge upon the surface of the TiO2, an electron-hole pair is formed. The electron-hole pair oxidizes adsorbed substances either directly or via reactive intermediates that form on the surface, such as hydroxyl radicals (OH) or superoxide ions (O2-). Several factors can influence the band-gap energy of TiO2, two of which are crystal structure and impurities. TiO2 exists as three crystal structures brookite, anatase, and rutile that can be controlled via heat treatment. Anatase is the most photocatalytically active crystal form of TiO2. Doping TiO2 with impurities can alter its band-gap energy, as well as its effectiveness as a catalyst. Depending on their size, dopant atoms can occupy either the substitutional or interstitial lattice positions. Atoms that are relatively large will assume the interstitial positions and create a much greater energy disturbance in the crystal than will smaller atoms that take on the substitutional positions. This energy disturbance narrows the band-gap and thus allows photons with longer wavelengths and smaller energies (such as those in the visible-light spectrum) to create electron-hole pairs. Raman spectroscopy was performed for the purpose of determining the crystal structure and the degree of crystallinity of the TiO2 particles. Reflectance measurements indicated the wavelengths of light absorbed by the different catalysts.", "title": "Photocatalytic Coatings for Exploration and Spaceport Design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T18:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090022259, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090022259, "id": "17e9750c2bbb468793528033de964a7b", "publicationName": "John F.
