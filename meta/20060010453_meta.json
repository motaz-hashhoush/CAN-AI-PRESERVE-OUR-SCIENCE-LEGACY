The data was acquired to develop and validate analytical methods used to predict rollout Orbiter fatigue load spectra. Earlier predictions computed by a base drive approach with only 5 input drive degrees-of-freedom raised questions that commissioned the partial stack test. Not only was there a concern because of the input degree-of-freedom omission due to measurement limitations, but there was also a concern with the implementation of the \"large mass\" itself. Three methods were evaluated with the partial stack test data. The analytical correlations to measured strain derived SRB base loads and acceleration5 showed the earlier 5 degree-of-freedom base drive approach to yield the most conservative results for all quantities monitored except the SRB base moment about the axis in which the input drive was missing. This non-conservative shortcoming led to a recommendation to use either the 6 degree-of-freedom base drive or the 12 degree-of-freedom Craig-Bampton boundary drive methods whose results did not substantially differ.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060010453, "endDate": "2005-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Modal Analysis Conference", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "e8e7e1bbafbb4dc6ae2324905220438c", "startDate": "2005-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060010453, "id": "2c012eca87e045d8bef1b9a0d7cfa2b1", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060010453.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060010453/downloads/20060010453.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060010453/downloads/20060010453.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060010453/downloads/20060010453.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
