CRASHWORTHINESS\nEDWARDWIDMAYER,\n\nJR. AND OTTO B, BRI_NDE\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplane Company\n\n1.0 SUMMARY\n-,\n\nThis report presents the results of a study to identify areas of regearch and approaches that may\nresult in improved occupant survivability and creshwortldness of transport aircraft. This study was\njointly sponsored by National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and the Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA). The thrust of the study is the definition of areas of structural crachworthlne_\nfor transport aircraft which might form the basis for a NASA/FAA Research Program.\nNASA and the FAA are planning a 10-year research and development program to improve the\nstructurai impact resistance of general aviation and commercial jet transport aircraft. As part of this\nprogram para_el studies have been conducted by The Lockheed California Company, The Douglas\nAircraft Company, and The Boeing CommercialAirplane Cor_pany to review the accident experience\nof commercial transport aircraft, assess the accident performance of structural components and the\nstatus of impact resistance technology, and recommend areas of research end development for that\n10-year plan. This report gives the results of the Boeing study.\n\n2.0 INTRODUCTION\nTile scop_ of the study from tile contractual statement of work is:\n"A study to define approaches to improve the crashworthine_ of transport aircraft is described in\nthis statement of work, Aircraft accident data and current aircraft design practices will be u_i to\ndefine a range of crash conditions that might form the basis for developing crashworthinesa design\ntechnology. In addition, analytical and/or experimental techniques required to determine the\nadequacy of craehworthy design features will be defined and the adequacy of existing metheda and\ntechniqu_ will be evaluated. While meeting the specific objectives of this study, consideration\nshould be given to rite increasing role advanced composite materials might play in the design of\nfuture transports.\nResume of tasks:\nL\n\nTo review and evaluate transportaircraft accident data to define a range of crash eitnations that\nma.__fformthe basis for developing improved crashworthinesa design technology,\n\n2,\n\nIdentify structural components and aircraft systenm that significantly participate in or influence\nthe crash dynamic behavior of an aircraft in the scenarios defined in 1.\n\n3.\n\nTo define areas of research and approaches for improving erashworthinesa.\n\n4.\n\nTo identify test techniques, test data, analytical methods, etc. needed to evaluate the crash\ndynamic response of transport aircraft."\nBACKGROUND\n\nSafety is the primary consideration in the design and operation of commercial transport aircraft.\nFor over 40 years the FAA with i,a predecessor the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA),\nNASA and its predece.s,sorNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA}, the National\nTransportation Safety Board (NTSB), the airlines, anions, the manufacturers and other foreign\ngovernment agencies have contributed to the development and advancement of safety in\ncommercial aviation. Their efforts have resulted in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) which\ndefine the minimum standards for safety. These regulations are continually reviewed to ascertain\nthe adequacy of the standards. This concern is reflected in the safety record of air carriers jet\naircraft operations over the past 20 years. Figure 2.1 shows that the accident rate for all types of\naccidents has declined to about 2.5 pet million departures.\n\n_"\n!\n_\nt\n\n:\n\nThe continuing concern for safety at Boeing has placed an emphasis on determining the cause of\naccidents and evaluating the crashworthine_ of aircraft structure and systems. Because of this\nemphasis, safety related design changes and intprovements, based on operational experience and\naccident data, are continually being evaluated and often incorporated in new design aircraft and\nin-service aircraft.\nHowever, the initial conditions of an accident and the subsequent responses of the aircraft are\ncomplex phenomena and it is difficult to quantify the level of at_uctural crashworthinesa of a\nspecific design or to compare one design to another. For design improvements, the crash\nenvironment is known only in general terms.\nCurrent technology is based on the best available knowledge obtained frmn accident surveys, some\ncomplete aircraft crash tests, saatleccopant teats, and from military and automotive programs\n\n"\n\n_-\n\nI\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2__\n\n\xc2\xb0!\noIIIImll\n\n,\n\n/-\n\n.-\n\nI\n\n:_\n\n$\n\n3\n\naimed at specific problems, Each manufacturer of aircraft hns developed empirical engineering\npractices that treat structural crashwurthiness. These practices while producing good produrts,\nare extremely limited in application.\nSome analytical tools have been developed for modeling the nonlinear response of occupants in\nseats and of aircraft structures. Those tools have constraints due to lack of computing power and\nhave had limited validation and application. This in turn has limited the development of technical\napproaches t_ crash modeling and simulation. Further, it is not established that these tools include\nall the ip.chnelogy nece_ury to adequately treat the complete structural crushwor thinese problem.\nBq\n\nWith regard to facilities and methods for testing for crashworthiness, some facilities are currently\navailable or under development. Some test methods have been developed by the FAA, NA_A, and\nthe U.S. Army for seats, components, and general aviation aircraft and helicopters. FuU-seale\naircraft crash test methods are being extended by the FAA and NASA.\nThe Bo_ing study under this contract is limited to commercial jet transport aircraft. This is the area of\nBoo\'rag Commercial Airplane Company ezportise and conforms to the company product Line. It also\nreflects the structure of the world fleet. The world transport fleet as of 1980 consisted of 75.7% jet\naircraft, 15.7% turbopropsircraft_8%pistonenginedaircraftand 0.5% helicopters._t\non orderare\ndivided 9 to 1 towards jet aircraft. This implies that the percentage of jet aircraft in the fleet will\nincrease during the time frame of the potential NASA/FAA research program.\nWhile the recommendations for research arising in this study are directed towards technology for\ncommercial jet transports there is an applicability to the general and private aviation sectors as well.\nDevelopment of analytical methods, test techniques and facilities also have applicability to military\naircraft and the automotive industry.\nREPORT ORGANIZATION\nThe main sections of the report are Accident Data Review and Scenario Identification, Role of\nStructural Components in Crashworthiness, Current State of Creahworthine_ Technology, and\nConclusions and Recommendations. Accident Data Review and Scenario Identification discuss\nsources and selection of accidents, various categories of the data, accident scenario development,\nand ranges of impact conditions for the seanurins. The Role of Structural Components in\nCraohworthiness treats the participation of structural components, accident severity and\nsurvivability, interaction of compensate, problem areas for advanced materials in structural\ncomponents. The Current State of Crushworthinese Technology considers the U.S. Army\'s Aircraft\nCrashSurvival Design Guide, occupant modeling end human impact tolerance, structural modeling\nand test technology, auesses the technology and discusses research to improve the technology.\nConclusions and Recommendations presents areas for research and development to be included in\nthe NASA/FAA 10-year General Aviation and Commercial T_ansport Aircraft Crashworthinese.\n\n4\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT DATA REVIEW AND SCF_IARIO IDENTIFICATION\nA review and evaluation of accident data has been made for the yeem 1959--1979 which cover the\ncommercial jet transport worldwide operations for eirereft certified under Federal Aviatim_\nRegulations (FAR), Part 25.

Criterion {2) does not mean that if\none survives all should survive, rather that one occupant was able to withstand this accident\neaviromne_t in his immediate vici,tity. This permits accidenta to be considered for researchdefinition\nand direction that are beyond the scope of current design criteria.\nUsing the above criteria, about 400 accidents were selected from the total data base of 583. These\n400 were then subject to nn in-depth review and muny were eliminated from further consideration\nbcs,ause no injury occurred and/or the aircraft was structurally crashwurthy to that level of crash\nenvironment. Other accidents were eliminated Ix,cause the injury was due to human behavior rather\nthan other factors. Following tliis preliminary review a list of atmreximately 200 "candidate\naccidents" was selected for detailed review. These accidents were deemed to have the potential for\na reduction in injuries/fatalities if m_me increase in erashworthiness were provided, or that\ndemonstrated silolifieant crash performuure of the structure. For these 200 accidents, data forms\n(see app. B) were completed to the extent of tile available data.\nDetailed reviews of these 200 cases resulh,d ill additional eliminations and a final list of 153\naccidents for this study (see fig. 2.i). These accidents are designated as "potentially survivable"\nthroughout the report. The selected list was checked against the injury and hell loss lists of the\nBoeing data-base to ensure completeness. Appendix C gives a list of accidents for 1980 for future\nconsideration.\n\ni\'\n\nIt should be noted that the inclusion of the le_ severe accidents might alter any statistics derived\nfrom the data base. Consequently, care is required ill comparing the results of this study to studies\nusing other data bases. However, comparisons to other studies indicate that all of the known severe\npotentially survivable accidents involving commercial jet transports have been included in the study\ndata base.\n\nIll\n\n__\n\nThe data bess does not represent the complete distribution of possible accidents in the statistical\nsense.

The first special ease is the 707 in\nLondon in 1968 where the aircraft caught fire on takeoff and made a successful landing but five\ndeaths occurred during evacuation due to fire. The second special case is the DC-8 at Toronto in\n1970 where the aircraft was dmnaged during an attempted landing and exploded during the\nsuboequent attempted go-around killing the 108 occupunta.

"Probable cause" is based on the\ndetermination of the accident investigation body. For 13 accidents the cause is unknown. For 140\ncases where cause has been determined, 78.6% of _he eases are attributed to the cockpit crew,\n11.4% to the airplane, 5% to weather, 2.2% to the airport/air traffic controller, 1.4% to\nmiscellaneous0 0.7% to maintenunce, and 0.7% to sebetage.\nThe aircraft was the cause of the accident in 11.4% of the eases. Landing gear systems and support\nstructure were involved in seven ace;.dcnte. Failures involved brakes, wheels, tires, and structure.\nEngine disintegration, thrust loss, and thrust reversers were involved in six accident_. Flight\niastrumentatian was involved in two accidents and ground spoilers and elevator trim tab were\ninvolved in one accident each.\n\n,\n\nFront these data it may be cuncluded that about 89% of the accidents might have been avoided by\nimproved pilot assistance and ground ccntnd. The most significant improvements in safety may be\nobtained thrnugh awident avoidance. Such items as ground proximity warning, wind shear\ndetection, atttomsted landing and navigation systems, and advanced integrated systems for pilot\nassistance offer the best hope for eliminating mtmt accidents in the "avoidable" category.\n\np\n\nImprow\'d grnmld control and n_\'luction of hazards on atul around airports is another area for\nimproved safety, The avoidance of cnllisions between aircraft and with ground vehicles Jdmuld by\nattainable. Reductian of hazards such as drsinage ditches, poles, trees, columns, outbuildit_gs, attd\nbirds front airports is a matter of concern. In additio,t the short/overrun areas for runways could be\nimproved to reduce the severity of a(x,identa in these areas.\n\nII\n\nTable 3.2-StudyDataBaso\n\n1019s,\n707\noso,\nFIREWAT\nOR275, WASHINOTONo APP PAR\nCMT AIRES X so o AP, UDF\nASCUN_ONx 84 , LoG Y_S\n2\no22\xc2\xb0_D\nCMT\n_o\n07,.6, B_,FNOS X106 4 ?

The 737, DC.9,\nComet IV, BAC-111, _Yident, F28 and Caravelle form a short haul group up to 72.5 tonnes. The\n720, 727,880, and 990 are included in tits 72.5 to 113 tennea short haul group. The 707 and the\nI}C.8 are in the 113 to 158 tonnea uarrow-body long haul group. Wide.bedy aircraft such as the\nL-1011, DC-IO, and the 747 are in the over 158-terms widwbedy long haul group.\n\ni\ni\n\ni\n\nReferring to figure 3.5, it may be seen that each size group is represented in the data base. Smaller\nshorthaulaircraft o0natitutsapproxinmtely40%of the cases, largershort haul group appro_dmateJy0%\n2\nof the cases, narrow-body long haul group approximately 35% and wide-bedy long haul aircraft\napproximately 5%.\nOf purticulur inter_t is the effect of size on aircraft crash performance and etu\'vivability. Considering\nthe effects of scale as in dynamic modeling, it might be expected that largeraircraft would fare better\nthan smaller ah_craftif the crash environment is not scaled up. Ftu_her, the individual occupant does\nnot scale up, but becomes relatively smaller in the larger aircraft with a corresponding improvement\nin his survival prospects. For instance, fuselage structural elements such as frames and stringers are\nstronger in an absolute sense and offer gre_ter energy absorbing capability for larger commercial jet\naircraft than for smaller prepeUer-drivenaircraft.This feature provides an inherent crashworthine_ to\nthe jet as compared to the propeller aircraft.\nA qualitative assesmnent of the accident data seems to indicate that relative size within the jet group\nhas only minor effects on the crash performance of con,merciul jet transports. In general, it takes a\nlarger tree, a larger house, and a deeper or wider ditch to do equivalent damage to a large aircraft.\nSince no two accidents are identical, an accurate comparison of damage between a large and small\njet airframe cannot be made.\nThere is some indication that there may be some effect of size between some smaller propellerdriven transport aircraft and the current jet fleet. Thrce accidents not included in the study data base\nwere reviewed that involve high wing propeLler-drivenaircraft of one generic type. In these accidents\nthe seat response was different from that observed in survivable jet aircraft accidents in that many\nseatseparated.\ns\nFurther,\nthere\nwereinstances\nofseat\n"stacking"\nintheforward\nfuselage\nandsea_\nejection a large\non\nscale.\nThesepropeller-driven\naircraft\nwhile\nsmallerhanthejet\nt\naircraft\nwere\ncertified\ntotheFAR 9 g longitudinal\ndeceleration\nrequirement.\nBut,becausefdimensional\no\nand\nstructural Pxrangement differences these smaller aircraft present a higher impedance to _he seats\nthan do the larger jet aircraft. This may account for the different seat crash response as seer by the\ntwo types of aircraft.\n\n/\n\nAIRCRAFT CONFIGURATION\nAccident cases were _ategorized with respect to configuration. Emphasis was placed on differences\nbetween aircraft types and service usoe. The aircraft fuselage internal configuration was classified\naccording to type of service, i.e. passenger or nonpassenger. Also in the internal fuselage\nconfiguration is the presence of body fuel cells and body fuel lines. The external configuration\ndifferences are related to fuselage width, engine placement, landing gear, and fuel cells.\nReferring to figure 3.5, it may be seen that approximately 20% involve nonpassenger service.\nNoupassenger service was further divided into cargo, training, and positioning flights.\nRegarding cargo service, a review of the accident data shows some cases where cargo shift during\nthe accident increased the hazard to the flight crew. A notable instance is the Miami 880 accident on\nDecember 16, 1976 where cattle pens broke Ioese during an overrun and blocked the\nctx\'kpit door.\n\n16\n\n,.\n\n10\nI -\n\nPercent of total (153 accidents)\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _-.i. ....\nI,\nI\ni\n\n20\ni\n\n80\nI\n\n90\nI\n\n100\n|\n\n1, NC slzu - gross weight\nup to 72.5\n72,5 to 113\n\n113totb8\n\n,\n\nI\n\n\'1\n\n- -\n\nII\n\nt 58 and over\n_\n\n2,\n\nA/C configuration\nType service - pass.\n-Non-pass,\n\nI\n\n_\n\nI\n\n__\n\nCargo Train Position\nEngine Loc,\n-Wing pod\nAft Body\nIIIII\nWing and A, Body BI\nFuselage width\n-Wide body l\n-Narrow body\n\ni Hz\n\n_\n\n-- -\n\n...\n\nIll\n\n.......\n\nTypes of injudes\n\n-\n\nUncertain\n\nFatal- Trauma\n\nI\n\n-Fire/smoke\n\nI I II\nII\n\n-Orowning _\nSerious -Trauma --\n\n-\n\nUncertain\n\'" \'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\' -\n\n-Fire/smok_\n\nI\n\n\'\n\n" \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4.

These accidents involve\nextreme yaw and roll angles with ground strikes of wings, engines or aft fuselage. Some accidents\ninvolve touch-and-go landing practice.\nThe principalvariationin structuralconfigurationis in placement of engiase. Approximately60% of the\naccide_ts involve aircraft with wing mounted enginse and 37% involve aft mounted engines, while 3%\ninvolve wing and aft body mounted engines. The aft mounted engines only separated from the\naircraft due to high acceleration loading, while the wing/pylon mounted engines separated beth from\nhigh accelerations and from contact with external objects. The Comet IV has engines moun_ed\ninternally in the_wings which contained the engines in a crash.\nEngine placement was observed to affect the fire hazard. A_ecciated with the aft body location is the\nbreaking of engine fuel lines and also of body fuel lines. The wing pylon mounted location had in\naddition to fuel line breaks, the rupturing of wing fuel tanks due to pylonJangine separation. Fires\noccurred in engines internally mounted in the wing.\nThe wide-bodylong haul aircraft have main body landing gear in addition to the wing mounted gear.\nHere the crash response was to transfer high impact loads to the fuselage structure.\nWith regard to fuel celia, the Comet IV has.wing pod tanks. These tanks have separated due to high\naccelerations and have contacted external objects. The associated fire hazard was\ntank rupture.\nTYPES OF INJURIES\nThe data be_secontains 119 accidents or 67%-involving fatalities and/or serious injury. For this\nstudy the NTSB definitions (see app. A) have been extended further to identify the cause of the\nfatality/injury. Tratuna is taken to mean that the fatality/injury is caused by mechanical forces\nsuch as inertia forces resulting from high accelerations or- from impact with the surrounding\nstructure. Fire/smoke is esalgned to those fatalitieslinjurise that result from burns, inhalation of\nhot gases, smoke or noxious fumes. In some eases, passengers are presumed to have received\ntrauma injuries that prevented or slowed down their egress and as a result they died of smoke or\nflames. For those accidents where the aircraft stopped in water, fatalities due to drowning are\nidentified. No attempt has been made to identify injuries (chemical burns) due t_contact with.raw\nfuel although some instances have occurred in beth land and water accidents.\nReferringto flgu_ 3.5, it may be seen that approximately 35% of the acddents involve fatalities due to\ntrauma,37% involve fu_smoke, and 6%involve drowning. With respect to the serious injuries, 60%\ninvolve trauma, and 30% involve fire/smoke. It should be noted that some accidents may involve\ncombinations of the above causes of injury.\nOPERATIONAL PHASE\nFive operational phasce were used for grouping the accidents. These are takeoff, climb, approach,\nlanding, and tazi. Referring to figure 3.5, it may be seen that takeoff involved 22.5%, climb\ninvolved 7.9%, approach invclved 30.5%, landing involved 37.1% and taxi involved 2.0% of the\naccident cases.\nThe groupings by operational phase are given in table 3.3 with a brief description of the accident.\nFrom these data, the complexity of the accidents may be observed. While frequently there are\ncommon factors between accidents, when the details are considcred each accident is a\nseparate event.\n\n19\n\n_\n\n_,\n\n2i)\n\n+P\n\n_..,+ _mm,<\n\n_2\n\n::3;\n,.4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\n6\n\nZ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ng\n\n\')4\n\n_,_T_! _A....\n\xc2\xb8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*tN_ .\n\n=\n\n!i\n\n1\n\n!\nSTRUC_._URAL DAMAGE\nThe accident data base contains 133 cases involving hull loss and 20 caeca involving aubetantial\ndatnage. There arc 103 cases in which fire was pwsent. In itpproximlltely 90% of these cases the\naircraft was a hull loss.\nReferring to figure _;.5, it may be seen that engine separation occurred in 55%, landing gear\ncollapse or separation occurred in 65%, wing bex breaks occurred in 45%, fuselage breaks occurred\nin 48%, and water ditching impact breakup occurred in 3% of the accidents. The separation of an\nengine and the breaking of a wing box imply fuel spills. In some instances a fuselage break in an\naircraft with aft mounted engines also cansed a fuel spill. Water ditching impact breakup is\nconmdered separately from fuselage breaks becauec in general the forces\ninvolved are different.\nFIRE HAZARD\nFire was present in 103 accidents. In 95 of those cases the aircraft was a hull loss and in the others\nthe aircraft suffered substantial damage. In addition, there were 22 accidents in which a fuel spill\noccurred but for which there was no fire. Some of these involved situations where the aircraft came\nto rest in water or where the climatic conditions, such as low temperature, precluded the\nvaporization of fuel or where terrain drained the fuel away from the aircraft, except for these\ncircumstances, those cases might also involve fire casualties or fnrtbor aircraft damage.\nContainment of fuel, spread/scatter of fuel, and ignition of fuel constitute major areas of study for\nin_proving survivability in jet transport accidente. Ignition sources are usually present in aircraft\ncrashes. Landing gear failure usually pr_k\'iut\'ea showers of sparks due to friction of structure rubbing\nthe ground. Hot sections of engines also provide an ignition source. Electrical arcing may occur\nwhen the electrical compartment is penetrated or when electric wiring is severed as in the instance\nof engine/pylon separation.\nCRASH ENVIRONMENT\nIn crashes, aircraft encounter a variety of hazards. These hazards consititute a hostile environment.\nIn an attempt to classify this environment hazards have been divided into three general categories:\nterrain,\nwater,\nandobstructions.\nTerrainay befurther\nm\nseparated hazards\ninto\nrelating\ntosurface\nbearing\ncapacity,\ncontours\nand\ngroundplaneforcontacty theaircraft. characteristics\nb\nThe\nofwateraredepthand seastate.\nObstructions\naredividednto\ni four\ngroups,\nbased\nroughlyn themannerinwhichaircraft\no\nreceives\ncrash\nloads.\nThesegroups\nareeolvmnsr,mpaling,\ni\nfrontal, other.\nand\nThe hostile\nenvironment\nisshown infigure.6.\n3\nExamplesoftypes\nofhazards\nthathavebeen\nencountered\ninaccidents\ninthedatabase\nareshowninparenthesis.\nInsinlple\naccidents,\nonehazard\nmay be encountt, red.

The characteristics of water are depth end sea state.\nObstructions are divided into four groups, based roughly on the manner in which aircraft receives\ncrash loads. These groups are columnar, impaling, frontal, and other.\n\n,\n\nThe hostile environment is shown in figure 3.6. Examples of types of hazards that have been\nencountered in accidents in the data base are shown in parenthesis. In simple accidents, one hazard\nmay be encountered. More complex arcidente may involve several hazards encountered in various\nsequences.\nCOMMENTS ON ACCIDENT DATA\nSome comments on the content of engineering data relevant to structural erashworthine_s available\nin accident repert8 are in order.

Unfortunstely, due to an executive\norder, accidents over five years old, are being deleted from their urehivos, Further, investigators are.\nlosving government service through retirement, transfer, etc, making it difficult to recover data on\nolder accidents. The NTSB should declare accidents having technical value as "classics" and\npreserve these dockets indefinitely.\nOne observation on accident reports is that it is difficult to simply differentiate accident severity\nbetween cases from the text, It inoften necessary to delve through the structures and human factors reports in the dockets to make this distinction. Use of the severity index developed in the part\nof section 4.0 rifled, Accident Severity and Survivability, of this report would help to resolve this\ndifficulty. This index could be extended to cover fire hazard.\n\n|:\n\nWith due regard for the availability of data at the scene of the accident, it is felt that participation of\nstructural subsystems reported may be influenced by the anticipations-of the investigator. For\ninstance, where fuselage breaks have occurred it may be usual for ceiling panels, sidewalls and\noverhead storage to be disrupted, Therefore, these items may not be mentioned in the reports.\nSources and sizes of fuel spills could be better reported.\nI)\n\nWith the advent of better simulation techniques more accurate data on-impact conditions, surface\nconditions, slide out distances, hazard definition, etc., will be useful in upgrading crashworthinesa\ntechnology. Continued emphasis on the definition of injury mechanisms is needed.\n\nm\n\n--\n\nMany foreign accident reports are quite thorough in the coverage of accidents while others simply\nreport the burost details. More cooperation and assistance through ICAO or directly with the foreign\nagencies might upgrade these reports.\nFinally, the availability of a team of crashworthy specialists drawn from NASA and the FAA to assist\nthe investigating authorities may prove useful. The NTSB, FAA, and NASA should consider this\noption.\nCRASH SCENARIOS\nScenarios to identify a general sequence of crash evants or conditions that produce the failure\nmechanisms of the aircraft structure and the injury mechanisms for the aircraft occupant have been\ndeveloped. Scenarios for the complete aircraft are necessary where there is significant interaction\nbetween constituent elements of the aircraft, where the sequence of damage is important to the\ncrash response, and to establish initial conditions for the study of isolated components.\nThe underlying philosophy for scenario development was, first, the scenarios must produce the\nfailure mechanisms of the structure and the injury mechanisms for the occupants. Second, the\nscenarios should encompass available accident experience. Third, the scenarios should assist in the\nidentification of crash technology requirements and allow study of the crash phenomena,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSCENARIO DEVELOPMENT\nThe initial phase in the development of crash scenarios consisted of review and study of historical\naccident data to identify and define broad categories of oceuriance relative to structural break-up\nand injury factors. Structural failure mechanisms were identified and at_ listed in table 3.4. Types of\ninjuries were identified and arc listed in table 3.5. The data extraction form is given in\n\nI-"\n\nappendix B.\nAfter an analysis of the structural and injury mechanisms, three basic scenarios evolved.

The crash vadablse are shown in tsb|e 3.6.\nAircraft configuration may have indi._idnallanding gear up or down. Aircraft weight variables are the\nfuselage weight distribution and the fuel load_distrlbution.\nAid.raft initial conditions are three components of linear and angular velocity, and three components\nrelating the aircraft orientation relative to the _rface. Aerodynamic ]rod8may besignificant for those\ncases where the forward velocity is greater than VS Cstall).\nSurface loads are due to the resistance of the surface. For land, this may vary from Bolt mud to\nrunway hardness, while for water, loads are influenced by sea state and are in accordance with the\nlaws of hvd_l_S_n\'face\nload characteristics may vary as the aircraft progresses through the\naccident.\nFollowing initial impact, subsequent hazards may beencountered. For simplification, obstructions\narc separated into three types; columns representing tzcos, poles, and towers that resist motion in\nthe x and y direction and are local; the ditch or hianp representing vertical terrain changes of the\nform Ao (1- cos XL) and may be local or apply Co broad sections of the a/rcreft, and the step\nfunction which forms a vertical boundary represeni.ing walls, buildings, vehicles, and other\nobstructions.\nThese obstructions may be symmetrically or asymetrically located and may be applied to landing\ngear, engines, wings, and fuselage separately or in combination.\nBASIC SCENARIO -- SURFACE TO SURFACE\nThis scenario considsre those accidents in which the aircraft on the ground encounters\nobstructions. The accident is characterized by horizontal motion into the hazard. As such it treats\ncases of hitting vehicles, buildings, soft earth, ditches or humps, entering water, and sliding\ncontact with the surface. Accident variables are similar to those described for the Air to Surface\nscenario with values appropriate to the accident conditions.\nBASIC SCENARIO -- FLIGHT INTO OBSTRUCTION\nThis scenario considers those accidents in which the aircraft flies into obstructions.

A fourth category\n($4) contains nine accidents, For these accidents there was insufficient information in the files about\nthe accident for scenario classification or the accident was of a peculiar nature such as the DC-8 in\nShannon or the 707 in London. However, the consequences of these accidents warrant their\nretention in the data base.\nIn some instances, it was difficult to place an accident in one basic scenario rather than another. This\nis due in part to the complexity of some of the eases and in part to the paucity of the available\naccident descriptions. Effort should be made to sharpen the distinction between the existing sots\nand to clarify the subsets from future accidents. In addition some prevision should be made for\ninclusion of a fuel spill factor in the subsets,\n\n1\n\nFinally, classifications have been based on history. Types of new accidents coming into the date\nbase should have a significantly different distribution from those of the first 20 years, This\ndistribution might be expected to be strongly affected by improvements in accident avoidance\ntechniques and be reduction of hazards on and aroundairports. Development of fire suppressing fuel\nadditives could not only alter the distribution of accidents among scenarios but could change the\nsignificance of structural component participation in accidents. If a less severe impact survivability\ncriterion were applied to the data base, some subsets might be eliminated and the distribution of\naccidents by subset might be modified. Consequently, the scenarios should he reviewed at intervals\nto ensure their continuing applicability. Further, the scenarios should reflect current behavior rather\nthan that drawn from the complete history.\n\n|\n_t\n\nt\n\n!\n\nCATEGORIZATION OF CRASH IMPACT CONDITIONS FOR CRASH SCENARIOS\n\n,\n\nAn assessment of the accidents with respect to the initial conditions has been made. It should be\nnoted that accidents in the data base are potentially impact survivable and that inherent structural\ncapability of the airframe already provides a high level of safety. Consequently, for many accident\ntypes the areas of interest for impact research lie at the extreme limits of observed conditions or\nbeyond. For other accidents the severity of the accidents was more a function of hazards\nencountered and somewhat independent of the normal initial conditions.\nCrashes on approach usually occur because the aircraft is not where the pilot thinks it is, Forward\n\n_::\n\nspeed of the aircraft\ndescent is between 0\ncontact, even a slight\nzero may suffice. The\n\nis between the speed for flap deployment (VF) and stall (Vs). The rate of\nand 2400 ft/min. If defensive action (flare) is taken, say to avoid ground\nclimb may be schieved. However, for research purposes, the lower limit of\nangle of the aircraft relative to the ground is depenr]ent on the slope of the\n\n31\n\nOL\'dGtNJ_,t.\nV\'_.K _\nOF pO0_ QUALI_\n\nTable3,Z-Crash Scenarios\n\nAIR TO SURFACE\n\nAt_ TO\nsuRr_E\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_\n\n_1_*114\nI1_11)\n\n_U\nnA_\n\nIUR|_\nI_ALY\ndA_|_O_Hk_\nAkd*\n\n|_ZIbt\nO4_J_\n11_4;_\nIIJ_14\n\n_N1\nt_7\n_b\n747\n\n&_k_A\n*lhO_U_\n_U_\xc2\xa2_*,\n_Al_Obt*\n\n_l_hq\n_Jl4_q\nO1,:_1_\n\xe2\x80\xa2+_J_\n111ql1\n,*1\n\naAC\nI_)\nuCa\nL_q\n?xf\nIJ\n\n_A_I_A\n(IOhAa_AI4_\nIOR_,*I+:\nF_IL_t,_LVIIIA\n_A.LI._\n\ntql/IT\n\n7*+?

The aircraft greas weight is, weight at takeoff less\nweight of fuel burned.\n\n-\n\nFor landiag accidents, forward speed may be above the prescribed landing speed or at atoll speed,\nhtstaneee of higher speeds generally resulted in overruns, Forward speed at onset of overruns ie\nuaually l_ that= the prescribed landJag speed due to pilot deee_orationmeaaurea.Angle of\nincidence is between 2.5 = nose down to the nose up stall angle, Rate of descent is between 0 and\n2400 ft/min.\nThe forward speed in taxi accidents is less than 60 kts. Takeoff accidents involve forward speeds of\nup to rotation speed (VR) for_beth overrun, veer-off of runway, and contact with obstructions on\nthe runway. Aircraft gross weight ranges up to maximum takeoff gross weight. Aircraft attitude is\nessentially wings lecel and zero ia_ideave.\n\n-_\n\nAccidents for initial climb involve lose or reduction in power and/or wing stall. Forward speed range is\nfrom V- to VF. These accidents may invnive impacts where the a/reraft is tai/.down or wing low, or\nR\nlarge angles of yaw and roll or a combination of the above. Rate of descent might be expected to be\nin the range of that for a hard landing, i.e,, 0 to 2400 ft/min.\n\n_t\n_t-\n\nIt should be noted that the accident data reportsdo not contain sufficient identification of conditions\nat the onset of the crash to be more precise.

Aircraft structural co,npenents that participate and their role in\ncrashes are identified from the accidentatata-Thls.participation is summarized.\nA matrix relating the participation of structural systems to the scenarios defined in section 3 is\npresented and asse_ed. An accident structural damage severity index is presented. This index is a\nfunction of major component participation. The-relationship between the scenario and the\nstructural damage severity index is a_sossed.\nInteractions of the structural components ae observed from the accident data have been identified\nand discussed. Problem areas for current structural components are discussed and assessed.\nFinally, crashworthiness implications of the application of advanced materials in these structural\ncomponents are considered.\nPARTICIPATION OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS\nIDENTIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS\nThe accident date base was reviewed to identify structural components that participate in the aircraft\ncrash\ndynamicresponse.\nReenltafthis\no\nreview\nareshown intable\n4.1.\nThistable\nidentifies\nthe\ncomponentcrash\nfunction,\ncCssh\ndynamics,\ninteraction\nwithother\ncomponents,\nandresults\nofthis\ninteraction.\nThe components are the landing gear, pylon/engine, wing box structure, fuselage, fuel distribution\nsystem, floor structure, seata/restraint systems, cabin interior, and entry and escape doors. The\nlanding gear includes nose gear, wing mounted main landing gear, and wide-body fuselage\nmounted gear. Pylon/engine include wing pod mounted engines and aft body engines. Wing box\nstructure is concerned basically with fuel tankage and primary load carrying members. Fuselage\nincludes lower fuselage, (bottom of fuselage to the cabin floor structure) and upper fuselage (floor\nstructure to crown). Cabin interiors include overhead storage, galleys, closets, dividers, lavatories,\nceiling panels, sidewalls, etc.\nCOMPONENT PARTICIPATION\nParticipation is summarized.in table 4.2. The major diagonal gives the total participation of any\ncomponent while the off<liagonal values shows coparticipatien of other components. In addition to\nthe components, hull lee_es and accidents involving fire are included.\nFrom those date, general component participation and interaction of components may be obtained.\nHowever, in order to obtain the significance of the interaction and role of components in crashes a\nmore detailed assessment is required (see part of section 4.0 rifled. Interaction of Structural\nComl_mente).\nMATRIX CATEGORIZATION\nTable 4.3 presents a matrix relating critical structural components, fatalities, and accident severity to\nthe crash scenarin6.

The frequency of fire, while not independent of the\ntotal eaergy, furtherincrcase_ the lethality of the scenario. In fact, the majorfactor in fatalities is fire.\nConsidering total fatalities, the ranking of the basic sceneries is air to surface (S1), flight into\nobstructions (83), surface to surface (82), and unclassified ($4). On the basis of numbers of\naccidents, the ranking becomes surface to m,fface ($2), air to surface (S1), flight into obstructions\n(83), end unelsesifled ($4).\nNo single scenario appears to be "the major type for lethality", rather each must be studied to fully\nt_derstand the crash response of aircraft. As starting points, it appears that air to surface-impact\non gear (812), surface to surface--low obstruction ($22), and flight into obstruction--impact\ncolumn ($32) are likely candidates.\nTo obtain improved-crashworthiness each structural component must perform its crash function.\nFor instance, when the strength capability of landing gear is exceeded, the gear should separate\nwithout tearing fuel tanks or dmnaging fuel or hydraulic lines. Landing gear should perform in\neach scenario over the range of accident variables. In like manner each system should be studied.\nThis should l_rovide ea envelops of capabilities for the aircraft.\nACCIDENT SEVERITY AND SURVIVABILITY\nAccidents have been assessed on the basis of amount of damage to the aircraft and effect of this\ndamage on survivability. Accidents in the data base were assessed into si_ categories of accident\nseverity shown in table 4.4. In general, the degree of structural damage and the energy to be dissipated increases\nasthecategory\nincreases.\nCategories through3 involve\n1\naccidents whichtheoccupant\nin\nprotective isgenerally\nshell\nmaintainedutfuelspill\nb\nfactor\nincreases\nwithcategory. category,thefuselage\nAt\n4\nbreakis\nintroduced\nbutthefuel\nsystem\nisintact.\nThree\nclasses\noffuselage\nbreak\nareusedtodistinguish\nthe\nseverity\noftheaccident.class break\nA\nI\nhasthefuselage\nbroken\nwithfuselage\nsections\nessentially\nremaining\ntogether.\nTheopeningllows\na\nfuel/fire butistoo\nentry\nsmall occupantgress.\nfor\ne\nInclass\n2\nbreaks,\nthefuselage\nseparates\nsufficiently\ntoallow\noccupant\negress\nand fuel/f_re\nentry,utthe\nb\nsection maintain a proximity to one another. Class 3 breaks have fuselage sections separate and\ncome to rest at some distance from each other.\nCategory 4 accidents are severe accidents involving either severe lower fuselage crush or class I or\n2 breaks, or beth. However, in category 4 there are no major fuel spills. Categories 5 and 6 involve\nincreasingly severe destruction of the aircraft with serious breaks in fuel tankage.\nThe 153 accidents in the data base have been grouped by category and are summarized in table 4.5\nand figure 4.1. From data in table 4.5 and figure 4.1 some general observations may be made. First,\nwith regard to overallsurvivability, fire presents the greatest hazard. Known fire fatalities outnumber\nknown trauma fatalities by 2.84 to 1.0. Fire hazard is most severe for accidents having major fuel\nspills due to rupturing of fuel tankage (categories 3, 5, and 6).\nTrauma fatalities occur meetly in cetegorice 5 and 6 which involve severe fuselage breaks. The\nsingle instance in category 2 resulted from a local lose of survivable volume and five instances in\ncategory 3 resulted from severs lower fuselage crush.\nDeep water impact accidents represent less than 10%of the study data base but have a high fatality\n\n43\n\nTable 4,4-Categories\n\nof Acclclont\n\nSeventy\n\n1,\n\nMinor impact damage - includas engine/pylondamage or separation, minor lower fuselage damage,\nand minor fuel spillage.\n\n2.\n\nModerate impact damage - includes higher degrees of damage of category f and Includesgear\nseparation or collapse.\n\n3.\n\nSevere impact damage but no fuselage break - includes major fuel spillage due to wing lower surface\ntear and wing box damage.\n\n4.\n\nSevere impact damage - includes severe lower fuselage crush and/or class I or class 2 fuselage\nbreaks, may have gear collapse, but no tank rupture.\n\n5,\n\nExtreme impact damage - includesclass 1 or class 2 fuselage breaks with wing separation or breaks,\nmay have gear and/or engine separation, and fuel spillage.\n\n6.\n\nAircraft destruction - includesclass 3 fuselage breaks or destructionwith tank rupture, gear and/or\nengine separation.\n\nFuselage breaks:\n\nClass 1 - sections break but remain together\nClass 2 \xc2\xb0 sections break and open\nClass 3 - seclions break and move off\n\ni"\n4,1\n\nORIC:_INAL\nPAC_ IS\nOF PO011QUALITY\n\nI,D\n\nI\'_\n\nq\n\nr--I\n\n,e-\n\n,-.,\n\nr- I\n\nIb\n\na_ _r\n\n,-;\n\nAJO_e|_O A|!JOABs\n\ni\n\nL\n\n! i\xc2\xb0+,+\n\xc2\xb0\n\n46\n\neBettlep\n\nleJnl_nJ|_\n\n+\xc2\xb0+\n\n_m\n\n_\'\n"_\n\n_. .\n\n_.\n\nrate. Little structural or detailed information is available on several accidents in which a large\npercentage of tile occupaata I_rished. Water impact usually re_nlta ill severe damage to the lower\nfuselage, often accompanied by class 2 breaks in fife fuselage and separation of wings, engines,\nand landing gear. In some cows many occupanta drowned after evacuating the aircraft. In some\nasses the high fatality rate wtu_due to inappmpl_ate action of the cabin crews after the itircraft came\nto rest.\nLnst, as might have been anticipated, the overall survivability generally decreasea as the major\nstructural dmnago to the aircraft increaese. For categories 5 and 6, known fatalities due to fire and to\nundefined fatalities, it is not expseted that the resulta would be changed if a fttll definition of fatalities\nwere available.\ntrauma appear in almost equal numbers. While these categories also have the largest percentages of\nCategory 1 accidents experienced only minor structural damage. There were three hull losses and\n53 fatalities due to fire. Two soc_denta involve fires, caused by sspflrgtiOnrOf all engine, that\nresulted in a catastrophic explcaion of the wing tanks. In beth instances, fatalities occurred when\n\n..\n\ntanks explodedthe wing tank by debris thrownevacuated.

In this case the trauma fatality occurred as the aircraft\npenetrated the airport tenumai. The purser wee killed when the hnU wee ruptured by e building\ncolumn. This accident ie an anomaly. There are 12 hull losses, 2 of which were due to slowly\nspreading fire. Two accidents involved engine separation and fuel line fires while another accideltt\nwas a friction fire due to nese gear co_lapse.\nCategory 3 accidents involve at least 722 fire related fatalities and 5 trauma fatalities. There are\nthree accidents involving 179 occupanta and 130 fatalities that are undefined. The DC-8 Toronto\naccident was placed in this category because of the major fuel spill due to tank rupture as the\nengine/pylon separated. The 108 fatalities are treated antics related because the wing fuel tank\nexplodedin the air while attempting a go-around.The five trauma fatalities weie in the KI,MTener_fe\naccident; and were in the lower fuselage and were ejected. Drownings accounted for 18 fatalities, at\nleast 15 of which occurred after evacuation.\nCategory 4 involves 225 fatalities of which 55 are from fires not due to tank rupture, 165 due to\ndrowning, and 6 to trauma. One of these was the 727 Salt [_akeCity accident in which fire resulted\nfrom a hard landing that caused a ruptured fuel line.\nIn meet a_cidenta involving drowning, few details are available except for the DC-9 St. Cruix\naccident. In this case the drownings are thought to occur after\'evacuation and trauma fatalities were\n\xe2\x80\xa2due to seat separation due to floor distortion and to oc_upanta who did not use the seat belts.\nCategory 5 involves 934 fatalities of which 45% are of undetermined canses. Of the known causes of\nfatality, 335 are related to fire and 210 are related to trauma. The 747 Pan Am Tencrife accident\naccounts for 36% of the fatalities, with 14,_deaths of undetarefined cause. In this accident trauma\nfatalities were due to the destruction of the upper aft fuselage by the KLM747 and the entry of the\nKI,Mengine podinto that section of the ai_raft. Further,burning fuel front the Pan Am ruptured wing\nwee sprayed into the area trapping most of these not killed by trauma. The four known trauma\nfatalities in the 727 Cincinnati accident were due to complete destruction of the ceckpit area. The\n10 trauma fatalities in the LK;-8Portland accident were due to intrusion of a la_e tree into the\nforward fuselage.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa217\n\nCategory 6 inw_lves 1547 fatalities of which 59% were of undetermined causes. Of the klxowncauses\nof fatality, 189 ,irerelated to fire and 190 are related to trauma, in four accidents, truly file fate of file\nflight deck crew is defined although there are indications of cause with terms as "many"or "most".\nThe enormity of many accidents and shortage of pathological skills preclude accurate postmortem\ndetermination of cause.\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCF, ARIO AND ACCIDENT SEVERITY CATEGORIES\nN\nCombining the structural damage severity category with the scenarios shows sceueaio developnmnt\nshould include accidents having severity categories of 3 through 5. Category 6 seeidentb represent\nconsumption of all the aircraft\'s protective structure. However, provisions made for less severe\naccidents would tend to improve the crashwurthinese in some areas even in category 6 accidents.\nConsequently, research efforts should be directed towards better defining the crash scenarios to\nrepresent this severity range. The improved definition includes initial conditions, aircraft motions,\nhazards encountered, and crash response of the systems. Methods of simulation should be\ndevelopec\'-_at permit study of the parameters that affect the crash-response so that these might be\n\'\nsubjected to a more thorough engineering treatment.\nINTERACTION OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS ANILAIRCRAET..S_STEMS\nMost aubstsntial damage or hull loss accidents that are impact survivable will involve damage,\ndestruction, or loss of one or more structural components and alrcraf_ systems. During the\nsequence of events as the destruction occurs and the aircraft come _ a stop, the lives of persona\nonbeard are being jeopardised. In the 153 accidents reviewed in this study, it was determined that\nthe most critical event in the sequence that caused most fatalities was the releasing and ignition of\nfuel which then developed into severe fires. For those persona not injured by impact, the\nprobability of survival was determined by time (measured in minutes and seconds) and by the\nimpedimenta in the escape route. In order to define approaches to improve the crashworthiness of\ntransport aircraft it is necessary that the involvement of the atrnctural components, systems, and\nsubsystems be determined and the sequeo.ca of events and interaction of their involvement in a\nvariety of accidents be well understood.\nDiscussion of the major hazards, the domhtant structural components, and the interaction as relating\nto survivability is provided in the following sections.\nWING BOX -- INTEGRAL FUEL SYSTEM\nSevere fuel fires, that are the primary cause of most fatalities, result from unwanted release or\nspillage of tank fuel. In this study it was found that 107 accidents involved tank fuel spillage and 85\nof these had fires of varying so.verity.Spillage directly fromthe integral tank nsnslly occurs from six\ntypes of events: wing box fracture or break, lower wing akin tear or rupture, penetration of the tank\nby an object, tearing open the wing box during separation of main landing gear or engine pylon, fuel\ntank ullage explosion, and flow from wing tip vents. In a given accident two or more of these types of\nspillage sometimes occurs, These types are shown in figure 4.2.\nFuel spillage due to wing break occurrences have been a:_essed with regard to incidence of fire and\nfire related fatalities, The area of the spill has been assayed where \'q,\nurgc" is 30 meters or larger in\ndiameter, "medium\xc2\xb0 is 10 to 30 meters in diameter, and "small" is unoer 10 meters. Fire intensity\nhas been assessed with respect to cansequences of fire as large, medium, or small. Interaction of\nfire with fuselage in arms of fuselage entry and of effect on evacuation also have been assessed,\nFire eet_.Tto the fuselage has been gaged as entry through breaks or as burn-threugh. In addition,\nthe effect of fire on the posterash evacuation has b_,n assessed, ltere, large effects implies some\nfire related fatalities, while small implies some hindrance.\n\n4_\n\n49\n\nRegarding the interaction of landing gear and pylon in wing break, the asso_mant relates to\nmaintenance of the wing ground clearance and to transmiMion of loads to the wing structure (only\nfor wing pod mounted engines).\nWING BOX BREAK/FRACTURE\nIn 67 accidents, fuel spillage occurred when the wing box fractured due to exce_ive forces or\nloads. There are also nine other accidents in which it is believed that wing fracture occurred but\ninsufficient detail is available to define other factors.\nMost fractures occur due to high vertical loads or due to impact with large objects such as trees,\nbuildings, or embankments. In some cases the landing gear and engines may also collapse or\n\n,.\n\ninfluence on the severity of the accident except possibly by providing an ignition source for the\nseparate st the time wing fracture occurs, however the gear and engine generally have little\nspilled tank fuel.\n\ni:.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSome wing fractures occur early iu the accident sequence and the fuselage continues to slide ormove, possibly away from the initial large fuel spill location. Fuel is nsunily scattered over a large\narea. In other casm the wing fracture oocurs at about the time and point where the aircraft comes to\nrest and the fuel spill is adjacent, under, or around the fuselage. If fuel ignition occurs, an almost\ninstantaneous severe fuel fire develops; this constitutes the "most hazardous scenario." Damage to\nother structural components can influence passenger/crew survivability in this situation. Fuselage\nbreaks and fuselage lower surface ruptures can provide immediate access for flame and smoke to\nthe passenger compartment. Damage to the cabin interior such as collapsed overhead storage,\ngalley debris, ruptured floor, and jammed/blocked exits can impede evacuation. The interactions of\nthese structural components and the impact that each has on survivability in the wing break/severe\nfn\'e occurrence, is different for each occurrence, no two are the same. From this study it is\nconcluded that research should be accomplished in the area of wing box and integral tank design\nphilosophyand in the development of wing structure that will minimize wing tank fracture when wing\nbox breakage or separation occurs.\nResults of these assessments are shown in figure 4.3. Some general observations may be made.\nFirst, wing breaks result in a high percentage of fires (deep water impact being an understandable\nexception). Second, wing bresk aocidents have a high fire related lethality. Third, if fire is present it is\nhighly probable that fire will enter the fuselage either through a fuselage opening such as a door,\nbreak,\norby a burn-through.\nFourth,\nthepresence\noffire a serious\nlies\neffect thepostcrash\non\nevacuation.\nBreaks\nduetoimpact\nindeepwater\nhavenotexperienced although\nf\'n_s\nhazard\nofRreis\npresent.\nBreaks\nduetodragginghewinga_e\nt\nground\nappear\ntoresult\ninalower\npercentage\nof fatal accidents than other types of breaks.\nWing breaks due to impacting trees/poles and like obstructions are particularly severe types of\nbreaks with regard to size of the spill and resulting fire and incidence of fire related fatalities. For\n21 accidents, large spills occurred in at least 16 with fires occurring in at 1,-ast 15. Fire related\nfatalities did not occur in only seven accidents. It may also be seen that fire entry through fuselage\nbreaks occurred in almost 60% of the accidents while entry by burn-through occurred in about\n10% of the accidents. Fire was a factor in evacuation in about 30% of the accidents.

These generally occur when the wing is subjected to\nscrubbing/sliding on the runway, on rough terrains, or over various objects. Records indicate that 13\ninvolved contact with rough terrain, 7 involved sliding over fences and walls, 4 involved sliding on\nlevel ground, 1 involved settling on a separated engine, and 1 involved impact with another aircraft.\nIn 26 of these accidents the aircraft was destroyed and 40% had fire related fatalities.\nThe hazardevolving from these wing tank tear/rupturce is related to the size of the tank opening, the\nrote at which fuel is released, the temperature, and if the fuel was ignited. Many of these\noccurrences involve severe fires, however-they tend to be localized in the wing area end thereby\nmake it possible for persons onbeard to evacuate from beth ends of the fuselage away from the fire.\nThe interactions and impact that other structural components have on these wing lower surface tears\nis\nthesameaswithwingbreak\noccurrences,increase\nAn\ninthehazard\noccursithtime(possibly\nw\n30\nsecondso5 minutes); impacting thewingoften\nt\nfire\non\ncausesankexplosions spread\nt\nthat\nthefuel\nfurther\nandintensify\nthefire.\nResearch\nshouldedirected\nb\ninthearea\nofcontaining\nthefuel\nwithinhe\nt\ntankoratleastestricting\nr\ntheflowoffuel\nthrough\ntherupture\norhole\ninthewingskin,\n\ni\'\nb-\n\nAseesament\nofthese\naccidents\nisshowninfigu:e As may beseen,\n4.4,\nlower\nsurface results\ntear\nin\nlarge fuel spillage with the fire being severe.

Wing mounted engine/pylon\nseparation or collapse during lower surface tear failed to maintain ground clearance in 96% of the\ncases.\n\nWing Box Tear\n:\n\nTearing away sections or parts of the wing box fuel tank and subsequently releasing large quantities\nof fuel during separations of main landing gear or of engine pylon is an infrequent occurrence, being\nDesign philosophy for main landing gear and engine pylon attachment to the wing box should be\nreported in seven accidents. However, when it does happen, a severe fuel fire generally occurs.\nreviewed to ensure these unite are fused for a clean overload separation that does not fracture the\nintegral fuel tank. Assesement of wing box tear is shown in figure 4.5.\nTank Ullage Explosions\n\n_" \'\n5 _\'_\'\n\nWing box fuel tank ullage explosions have been reported in 17 accidents and probably occurred in 6\n\n--._\n_\n\nothers. In most of these, a severe fire already existed and generally the size or intensity of the fire\nincrease. In most cases it is not known how many, if any, additional fatalities resulted from the tank\nexplosions but it appears from available data that evacuation was usually affected.

In this case, a 707 in\nRome, an engine fire spread to fuel dripping from the adjacent wing tank vent at the wing tip,\nprogressed through the vent system and caused a tank ullage explosion. Any studies involving fuel\ntank design should include the tank vent system and flame suppression,\nTank Puncture\n\n{-\n\nThere are three accidents in which tanks have been punctured by foreign objects, Two of these\naccidents occurredduring aircraft operation and resulted in fires that destroyed the aircraft but for\nwhich there were no fatalities. One of these involved puncture by debris from a disintegrating engine\nand the other involved parts from a.disintegratlng wheel. The third incident occurred after the\naccident when the tank was punctured during rescue operations hut there was no fire.\nLeakage\nThere are four accidents in which fuel spillage resulted from leaking tanks. Only one accident\nexperienced fire which destroyed the aircraft, but there were no fatalities. While fl_-hazard is\npresent these accidents have not been lethal,\nBody Lines\nRupture of body fuel lines is o hazard associated with aircraft configurations having aft mounted\nengines or auxiliary power unit. If fuel tank shut.off velves are activated immediately after acrash, the\namount of fuel spilled due to hody line rupture is only a minor contributor to the accident _everity.\nHowever, when the lines are not shut off, the resulting fire has been catastrophic.\nThe "classic" case of this was the 727 Salt Lake City accident on November 11, 1965, in which a\nseparated landing gear penetrated the lower fuselage and ruptured a body fuel line. Forty.three\noccupunt_ died from fire related causes. As a result of this accident, body lines were strengthened\nand rerouted to avoid this type of rupture. The only other instance in which body lines are thought to\nbe a major contributor to the severity of an accident is the DC-90_are on December 20, 1972,\nwhere the aft fuselage of a DC-9 struck the vertical tail of an 880 during takeoff and probably\nruptured a body fuel line. Ten persons perished from fire related causes in this accident.\n\n:\n\nAseessment of body fuel line rupture is given in figure 4.7. As may be seen, there are 10 accidents\nwith 4 probable instances of rupture. Fire was present in each instance with fire related fatalities in\nnine accidents. Fuel line rupture fires are deemed to have been a factor in evacuation in possibly six\nof the cases. Fuselage breaks were present in eight of the cases with.fire entering the fuselage\nthxough the breaks in six cases. Fire came through the floor in three cases with one uncertain.\nSEATS\nSeats interface with the occupant and with the s_cture to which they are attached. In assessing\nthese interactions, the relation of the seats and the structure is treated first, and the relatson of the\nseat to occupsnt is treated second.\n\n_\n\nThree basic types of seats are of concern: crew seats, flight attendant jump seats, and the\npassenger double and triple I_nch seats. Crew seats are single seats that are mechanically\nadjustable to facilitate operatir., of the aircraft and attach to the cockpit floor structure. A\ncombination shoulder and lap _.It restrain the occupant. Flight attendanW jump esats may be\nsingle or double units attached to a bulkhead end mechanically folded or retracted when not in use.\n\n59\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_\n\n,..\xc2\xae._ _?\n\n_ d_1:: a:::\nIx:len ,..\n(,.3 .j\n\n....\n\n\'i_..eseseats support vertical loads, with the rest_ahlt harness transmitting side and lougitudinai\nhinds to the structure. Pa_enger seats are attached to floor tracks and in some designs to the\nfuselage sides. Floor tracks arc attached to the floor structure or to pallets attached tn the floor\nstructure, Tile passenger is restrained by means of a lap belt.\nFor the interaction of seats with structure, no distinction is made for types of seats, but two\ninteractions are of cancers with the structure -- the effect of a fuselage break and the distortion of\nthe floor. In a fuselage break, scats may be ejected through the break, or may simply separate from\nat broken floor track. In floor distortion, seats may separate from the track, or may be elevated.\nThe potentially most lethal of those interactions is ejection through the fuselage break. Survival of\nthe occupant is a matter of chance, depending on many factors such as velocity of ejection, nature\nof intpact area, and the orientation of the occupant at impact. Further, the ejected occupant may\nbe in an area that is exposed to fire or is overrun by the advancing aircraft.\nSeats located in the vicinity of a fuselage break may be subject to high acceleration pulses due to\nthe redistribution of the stored strain energy as the structure breaks. This frequently results in the\nseparation of the seats due to rupture of seat tracks, seat track attachmante or seat structure.\nSeparated seats may then shift position and cause injury or hinder the egress of the occupant.\nSeat dislocation from floor distortion may be due to separation or to elevation of the seat.\nSeparation may force the occupant to contact interior objects and may hinder egress. Floor\nelevation may block egress routes such as over-wing escape hatches, may hinder the occupant in\nexiting from the seat, or may force contact with the cabin interior. For eraahwurthinese, it is\nI\n\n[\n\ndesirable\ntokeepseats\nattached,\ninplace, tomaintain survivable\nand\na\nvolumefortheoccupant.\nThere are 48 accidents with identified interactions and another 21 accidents to which probable\ninteractions were assigned. Assee-sment of these accidents is shown in figure 4.8. Fuselage break\nhas resulted in 15 certain accidante with one or more occupant ejected through the break, and\nprobably at least two more. Separation of some scats at the break with the scats remaining in the\naircraft has occurred in 30 accidents with probable occurrence in at least 13 other cases. Seat\nseparation due to floor or fuselage side distortion has occurred in 19 accidents with probably 5 other\neases. Elevation of the seat without sevaration has occurred in 14 accidents with probably 4 other\naccidents.\nThe discussion of scat/restraint performance in survivable crashes is presented in two parts, The\nfirst part includes those accidents in which injuries that might be related to seat strength\nperformance and in which aeat,lreatraint performance are cited by the accident investigation team.\nThe second part includes serious accidents in which the seat/restraint performance was not cited\nand in which no injuries that might be related to seat strength occurred.\nOnly 31 such aceidante could be fomld in which seat performance was mentioned in NTSB reports.\nA detailed review of these accidents indicatca seats certified to current FAR seat strength criteria\nprovide protection to the occupant commensurate with the crash loads. The aircraft strength and\noccupant injury tolerance capability appear to be in proper bahmee.\nA separate independent study of this matter conducted withi\'_ the FAA is contained in reference 1.\n\n,\n_\ni\n\nThe currenttudydrew uponNTSB accident\ns\nreports special\nand\nstudies,\nN\'PSBHuman Factors\nFactual Reports, NTSB Public Hearing Dockets, and the manufacturers accident files for each\naccident The separst_ I,AA study also treats NTSB data aml includes 1_ Civil Air Medi_ai hmtitute\nAA\n(CAMI) data but does not include the manufacturers files.\n\n_t_"._ !_ _\n6_\n\n,\n\nFor engi,_ecring purpceea it is necessary to relate _eat perfurmance and injury. To do this it was\nneceasury to review the Human Factors Factual Reports and, in some instances, survivor testimony.\nThe NTSB statistical category, "Serious Injury"(See app. A), used in NTSB Accident Reports does\nnot necessarily identify actual physical injury nor relate injury mechanism to injury. Accident victims\nwho are hospitalized for 48 hours for medical obeervatian, legal considerations, or other reasons are\nllsted as serious injurieoeven if there is no treatment. An immediate imprevement in erashworthiness\nstatistics could be obtained simply by using a more accurate definition of serious injury. To rely on\nthese injury statistics may lead to exagger_g_d conditions and produce erroneous conclusions.\nReference 1 identifies 27 ground impact accidents including 7 propeller-driven aircraft and 20 jet\ntransport aircraft, A comparison of those study accidents with this study shows that 18 of 20 jet\ntransport accident_ are included in the present study. The two accidents omitted are the DC-8 JFK\naccident on September 15, 1970, in which the seats performed adequately and no occupant was\nactually seriously injured, and the 707 Page Pagn accident on January 30, 1974 in which no seat\nperformance was cited. The additional accidents in the present study include accidents prior to\n1970, two Canadian accidents, and the 747 Japan Airlines accident in Anchorage on December 16,\n1975,\nIn these accident reviews, investigators did not identify a single trauma fatality caused by lack of\nseat strength or seat attachment structure strength. It is recognized that such identification is\ndifficult because of incomplete knowledge of local crash dynamics, fatal injury mechanisms, and\nsurvivor testimony as to his experience. Also, postcrash fire frequently consumes necessary\nevidence. There are limited, though subjective, indications w_ht_re increase in attachment\nan\nstrength may have provided some benefit. For instance, one passenger in the 727 St. Thomas\naccident was ejected in his seat through a fuselage break and died of trauma injuries. This seat was\nlocated in the aircraft in the region of fuselage destruction and there is no assurance that any\nincrease in seat strength requirements would have provided any benefit.\nWhile it can be observed that injuries were sustained in deforming the seats, no sequence of events\nhas been identified where increased seat strength would have reduced occupant injury.\nConsequently, the cases presented in table 4.6 involve serious injury and/or seat/restraint system\ncrash performance for accident survivors. Twenty-six accidents involve a hull loss, 19 involve fire,\n22 involve at least one fuselage break, 14 involve severe floor distortion, and 4 involve water impact.\nThirteen accidents are only partially impact survivable since survivable volume for at least one\noccupant was lost. For seat/reatraint system strength performance, injuries to the head, spine,\nchest, and pelvis are of concern, although injuries of these types may arise from a variety of other\ncauses. These are shown for the flight deck crew and passengers, while spine end pelvis injuries are\nshown for flight attendants.\n\nllJ\n_i\n\n"_-\n\n_\n_\n\nTable 4.6 also shows seat performance for seat-to-floor attachments, seat legs, seat pan, and\nrestraints for flight deck crew and passenger seats. The number for attachments and seat legs are\nfor seat units. Flight attendants\' jump seat structures, mechanisms, and harnesses are also\nidentified.\nSome general observations may be made in reviewing tltese accidents. First, there is evidence of\nspinal injury for flight deckcrew, flight attendants, and pa_engers where no seat crash performance\nwas cited by the NTSB. In addition, there were spinal injuries to occupants where seat crash\npeformancc was cited. If the injury tolerance of these people is exceeded by the crash forces\ntransmitted by seat8 designed to current strength requirements, inexeasing the seat strength criteria\nwould do nothing to intprove their protection. Second there are instances where seat performance\nwas cited in which no serious injury was incurred suggesting that increasing seat strength might\ntransmit sufficient load to produce serious injury, s negative benefit.\n\n2\n\n83\n\nI\n\nSeat detachment (separation) ia generally associated with loss of structural integrity due to\ndestruction of the fuselage shell, fuselage breaks, and to extreme distortion of the structure.\nDetachment may occur if all the seat legs or attachment fittings rupture or if the seat tracks rupture.\nThis indicates that a more compliant seat]floor substructure to accommodate distortion might be\nmore beneficial than an increase in seat strength criteria.\nFor commercial jet transport aircraft, there is little evidence of seat separation with subsequent\n"stacking" in the forward section of the aircraft. Two excaptione to this are the DC.9 St Croix\naccident where three double seats stacked due to the impact of some passengers who did not use\ntheir lap belts; and the 737 Midway accident where two triple seats (rows 14 and 15 A, B, and C)\nstacked due to severe structural damage to fuselage in that area. The more severe injuries occur in\nthe vicinity of fuselage breaks and areas of extreme fuselage distort.ion. This might be expected\nsince these are locations of very high loadings and areas where structure has lost its ability to protect\nthe occupants.\nPassenger Seats\nIn those accidents involving high longitudinal loading such as the 727 Cincinnati, 737 Midway,\nL-101L.Miami, DC-9 Boston, DC-9 Charlotte, 727 JFK, 727 St. Thomas, DC-9 New Hope, 737\nCranbrook, and the DC-8 in Portland, extreme destruction of the fuselage was experienced.\nPassenger seat separation was observed in the areas of destruction. An increase in seat strength\ncriteria would not have reduced the injuries in these accidenta.\nExamination of those accidents involving extreme vertical impact velocities such as the DC-9 St.\nCroix, DC-8 JFK, DC-9 Akron, 727 Denver, DC-9 Philadelphia, and the DC-9 Toronto accidents\nindicates an increased number of spinal fractures as compared to the total data set. In the Toronto\naccident, the aircraft went over a 51-ft cliff at 46 KIAS, equivalent to falling from the top of a fivestory building, having a resultant deceleration of 25 g. At Akron, the aircraft flew over a 38-ft,\nembankment at 86 mpli impacting on a roadway. The Philadelphia, Denver, JFK, and St. Croix\naccidents had hard impacts combined with high forward speeds.\nThese accidents indicate that the current passenger seat vertical strength criteria are closely\nmatched to the threshold of injury for the passenger population. Further seat deformations observed\nin some of these extreme accidents used much of the available stroke indicating that the limit of\nenergy absorption within the injury load threshold is being approached. However, further research\non the energy absorption aspect of crashworthy seats should be done.\nThe DC-8 Anchorage accident was an overrun during an aborted takeoff in which the aircraft\nencountered a deep ditch and hit a building and an antenna tower. The aircraft lost engines, landing\ngear, wings were separated and broken and the fuselage broke open. Many of the occupants left\ntheir seats and were standing in the aisles before the aircraft came to rest. Twenty-one spinal injuries\noccurred. One flight attendant and approximately five passengers are known to have sustained\nspinal injuries due to impact Icadings. These five passengers were in seats that ejected from the\naircraft when the fuselage broke. The remainder also may have occurred during impact or during\nevacuation, but there is no implication that increased seat strength would have provided more\nprotection.\nIt may be seen that only four accidents are of concern in accident performance of the flight deck\nseats. In the DC-8 Portland accident, the right side of the cockpit experienced loss of survivable\nvolume due to impacting a large diameter tree (of the cockpit occupants, only the Captain survived).\nThe First and Second Officer\'s _eate separated while the Captain\'s seat was attached but was loose\nand had some seat pan deformation.\n\n65\n\n.,\n\nI ..J\n\nIll the DC-9 Philadelphia accident whore the aircraft experienced a 10 g vertical deceleration, the\nCaptain and First Officer seats experieuced seat pan deformation, In applying loads to deform these\nseat pans both occupants experienced spinal injury.\nIn the 707 Kansas City accident one flight deck seat experienced seat leg doforu_ation and the\nofficer received a spinal injury. However, in this instm_ee, it was noted that the bax_esace wore not\nused by the the occupants.\nThere are six other accidents in which spinal injuriss occurredto flight deck crew but for which there\nwas no seat performance cited. From this it may be concluded that seats are already stronger than\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n,\n.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni\npilots; and that further increasing the strength cntsna, for these scats would prowde no benefit a n d\nmight cause more severe injuries. It appears that some increase in energy absorption and load\nlimiting might prove beneficial.\nThere are eight accidents in which t\'lightattendants suffered spinal injuries while seated. In the DC_\nAnchorage accident, one injury occurred when the seat retrsotod.from under the attendant during\nupwardacceleration causing the attendant to fall to the floor. The remaining injuries occurred with\nthe flight attendants in the seat. Two flight attendants had spinal and pelvic injuries in the high\nlongitudinal deceleration 727 JFK accident on June 24,1975, even though there was no damage to\nthe seat/restraint system. Most of these citations involve instances of seat collapse or partial\ncollapse due to rupture of a hinge, seat attachment fitting, or of the supporting mechanism. The\ninjuries sustained did not cause less of mobility in most cases.\nThere are instances where seat deformation contributed to harness problems, in that the flight\nattendant submarined after the seat pan deformed. The 727 Denver accident on August 1, 1975 is\na case in point. The flight attendant suffered a back injury in this process. Also "some"spinal and\npelvic injuries were experienced in the L-1011 Mianfi accident. Most of the remainder of spinal\ninjuries occurredin hard vertical impact accidents with seat pan or mechanism citations. Also there\nare instances of seat deformation in which there were r,o injuries.\nA review of accidents involving flight attendant seats indicates that increasing seat strength\nwould not reduce the number of serious injuries. However, every effort should be made to include\nthe results of TARC Project 216-10 study into flight attendant restraint design. Various\ngovernment agencies such as the Army, Air Force, and the Department of Transportation have\nidentified some levels of injury tolerance. See part of section 5.0 rifled, Human Impact Tolerance\nfor a more detailed discussion.\nLANDING GEAR\nThere are 96 accidents in which one or more of the landing gear separated or collapsed. In addition\nthere are 15 accidents in which the gear was stowed or retracted. The effect of gear separation or\ncollapse will be considered, followed by the effect of gear in stowed positions. Some comparison of\nmlt-\n\nthe two effects will be made.\nReferring to table 4.2, the total occurrences show that for 95 cases of gear involvement (1 accident\ninvolves debris from the gear damaging the aircraft) there were 80 hull losses, 64 fires, 71 tank\nruptures, 46 wing mounted engines/pods separated (lI ease6 of engine separation involve aft\nmounted engines), 62 fuselage breaks or crush, 38 door hatch involvements, 33 floor distortions,\n33 cases of debris, and 26 seat citations.\n\n--m.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n;-:\np-.\n\nIn order to assess the role of landing gear and the interaction with other structural systems the\nareidents were reviewed. Direct effects of gear separation are: separation of wing pod nmunted\nengines; rupture of fuel tanks by failing to maintain ground clearance and by the separating gear\n\n66\n\n,\n\nl\ntearing a wing box; and damage to the lower fuselage by crushing, friction, and by breaks.\nSecondary effects are fire due to fuel spillage front ruptured fuel lines and tanks and to friction, floor\ndistortians, door/hatch problems, scat separation, and debrie due to the dintertion and breaks of the\nfuselage as a result of ground contact.\nFigure 4.9 shows the aseessment of gear separation. In 67% of the accidents all gear separated or\ncollapsed, while in 22%only main gear separated or collapsed, and in 9%only nose gear separated or\ncollapsed and in 2% nose gear and one main gear separated or collapsed,\nGear separation or collapse was involved in tank rupture in 17 eases of lower surface tear, 12 cases\nof wing drag breaks, 14 cases of wing box tear, and 4 eases of tank leakage. This fuel spillage\nresulted in 42 fire_.Thus gear separation or collapse is a factor in 64% of the fires that occuxred when\ngear participated in the accident. Using small, medium, and large as the degree of involvement, the\ngear was a large factor in 26 of the 42 fires, a medium factor in 4 of the fires, and a small factor in\n12. With respect to fatalities, there were 28 accidents-adth-firexelated fatalities and 24 accidents\nwith trauma deaths.\nLower fuselage crush occurred in 53 accidents with gear separation being a large factor in 37\ncases. Lower fuselage crush has a secondary effect on door/hatch jamming, on separation of seats,\nand on cabin interior debris. Gear separation was a large factor in 9 cases of fuselage break.\nFor 15 accidents in which the gear was known to be retracting or in stowed position, there are only 5\ncases where having gear extended may have prevented the crash. These cases mostly involve\nextensive slide-out, but occurred during aborted takeoffs or flight activities for which the gear is\nnormully retracted.\nFrom the above discussion it may be concluded that development of gear more tolerant to conditions\nthat cause separation would result in some increase in crashworthinese. Further, when separation\ndoes occur, the wing box should not tear open.\nCABIN INTERIORS\nCabin interiors ere cited in approximately one-third of the accidents in the data base. Cabin interior\nequipment includes overhead storage compartments, ceiling panels and lights, sidewalls, clsse\npartitions, galleys, and closehs.Comparing cabin interior citations with the accident severity category\n(see table 4.4) some peculiarities may be obse_\'ed. For instance, it might be expected that\naccidents in categories 3 to 6 would have a higher percentage of citations than is actually reported.\nThis is particularly applicable to accident categories 5 and 6.\n\n.\n\nThe disparity might be attributed to the expectations of the investigator, If the damage is such that\noverhead compartments, ceiling panels, etc. might be expected to separate and clutter the scene,\nthe occurrencemay not be reported. Further, if the devastation is such that participation of the cabin\ninteriors as compared to other factors might be considered secondary in survivability of the\noccupant, the participation may be unreported. While the absolute level of participation may equal\nthat of a less severe accident, the relative contribution may be significantly less. Finally, post-impact\nfire may destroy visual evidence and survivors may not report conditions,\nConsequently, the 45 accidents where citations have been made should serve as an indication of\npossible crash behavior of interior equipment, The 23 accidents where probable participation has\nbeen asse_ed may not include all incidents. In some accidents where at least one part of the\ninterior participated, other parts have been deemed probable.\n\n67\n\n\xc2\xb0\n6_\n\nOverhead storage comparUnents have been assessed with regard to separation, contents spillage,\nevacuation blockage, and injury to occupants. Ceiling panels, sidewall liners, and class portitiozm\nhave been assessed for separation. This separation usually has some effect on egret. Galleys have\nbeen aase_=d for contents spillage as well as egress blockage. These units are of particular concern\nsince they affect availability of the setwiee doors as an egress route. These assessments ere shown\nin figure 4.10. Cabin interiors have been a major factor in evacuation in 12 known accidents and\nprobably in 14 accidents. Overhead storage has caused injuries in five known accidents and\nprobably caused injury in three additional accidents.\n,\n\ni\n\nFigure 4.11 chows interaction between other structural systems and the cabin interior system.\nCrush of the lower fuselage is deemed to have occurred in 52 of the 68 accidents. Fuselage breaks\nare deemed to have occurred in 32 of the 68 accidents. Landing gear separation or collapse\noccurred in 48 accidents and the gear was retracted in 6 other cases. Floor distortion is deemed to\nhave occurred in 26 accidents. All of these interactions participate in severely loading the\nstructural supports for the cabin interior-equipment. Fire was present in 41 of the accidents.\nFUSELAGE-BREAK ACCIDENTS (Excluding Fuselage Lower Surface Rupture)\nOf the 153 impact survivable accidents used in this Survivability Study, 64 are kaown to have experienced one or more breaks in the fuselage and 7 others probably also had breaks. Forty-si_of\nthe 64 were fatal accidents. Available data indicates that 39.5% of the persons onboard in the 64\naccidents were fatalities. The other 82 accidents in this study did not experience fuselage breaks\nand 27 of these were fatal accidents of the persons onboard-in the 82 accidents, 20.6% were\nfatalities. These data are plotted as follows:\nFatalities\nPercentoftotalonboard\n\nF_"\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\ni"\n\nFuselagebreak\naccidents\n_l_\n\nTotal\nFatal\n\nBi-_ ..\nI1\n\n64\n46\n\nNo fuselagebreak\naccidents\n\n=.\n\n82\n\nFatal\n_\n\nTotal\n\n27\n\nOf the 64 accidents experiencing fuselage breaks, 6 involved the aircraft touching down in deep\nwater and 58 involved the aircraft touching down (impacting) on ground or in swampy areas with\nshallow water.

The other sections floated briefly, allowing\nevacuations into rafts or floating slides. In other accidents the fuselage sections floated briefly,\nhowever 84% of those anboard drowned. Survivor reports indicated that in at least two accidents,\ninterior and carry-on debris blocked evacuation routes and in two other accidents some exit doors\nwere jammed. In another, the passenger compartment floor was displaced upward restricting\nevacuation.\nThere were also four accidents involving deep water entry in which the fuselage did not break, and\n25.9% of _ose onbeard were fatalities, most believed due to drowning,\nHowever, in these accidents the aircraft floated at least 5 minutes and in most cases 10 to 20\nminutes, thus allowing adequate time to escape. In three of the four accidents it was established that\nthe onboard rafts and float slides were not used.\nIt can therefore be concluded that in deep water entry accidents in which the fuselage does not\nbreak, the survivor-rate should be very high with proper crew response/aetious using available\nequipment, Designing the fuselage to resist breaks or separations is desirable.\nGround Slide Accidents\nFifty-eight ground slide accidents experienced fuselage breaks due to main landing gear\nseparation/collapse, excessively hard touchdown or hard fiat/impact after takeoff, touchdown in\nareas of txeegbuildinglobjects or on rocky/cough terrain, or combinations of these conditions.\n\n;_\'-\n\nGear Separations -- 8.6%-- In 5 accidents, landing gear collapse or separation is believed to have\ncontributed to the fuselage breaking;that is, if gear had not failed the fuselage may not have broken.\n\n72\n\nThemearc generally cases of the aircraft veering off ths runway onto rcasenabiy smooth terrain or\ntouching down on smooth terrain told then having one or both main landing gear separate due to\nimpact with n slightly rm_i roador small ditch. Those five accidents rv_ulted in a clean break in the\nfuselage, wide enough for a persen to be ejected, fall out, or step out. Approximately 11%of those\nonbeard in the five accidents were fatalities. Fatalities occurred in three of these accidents and in\neach case a severs fuel fire developed. The other two had no fatalities and no fire.\nHard Touchdown -- 8.6%4 In five accidents, the aircraft experienced a hard touchdown in a\nlanding attitude or stalled after takeoff resulting in level attitude impact with sufficient vertical\nload to cause the fuselage to break. Two of these accidents resulted in slight breaks/fractures that\nwould not result in ejection of persons or provide a mea_ of exit/evacuation; there were no\nfatalities and no severe fuel fire. The oth_r three accidents resulted in fuselage breaks that were\nwide enough to allow ejection of persons or provide a means of crawling/stepping out during\nevacuation. Of the 45 parsons onboard in three accideuta 64% were fatalities; all three experienced\nsevere fuel fires. There is a high probability of flame and smoke entering open ends of the fuselage\nsections.\nAircraft forward speed was believed to be reasonably low in three of the accidents since the aircraft\nwere in a staihd condition at impact. In the other two accidents the aircraft touched down slightly\nshort of the runway at a high rate of descent, with forward speed probably 10 to 15 knots less than\nplanned.\nRough Ground -- 8.2% -- In 48 accidents, the aircraft experienced fuselage breaks after touching\ndown-on terrain where impact occurred with trees, poles, gtflleys, ditches, embankments, raised\nroads, etc. or where impact occurred with one wing low on a reasonably smooth am\'face (on airport,\nmarsh, dry lakebed, etc).\nData on these accidents are tabulated in the followi _ chart.\nOnboardfatalities\nSevere_Fuel\nFire\nPercentof total\n50\nI\n\n25\nI\n\n75\nI\n\nSlightbreak\nAverage\nspeed\n- 57k\nClean-br.eak\n\n_\n\nJ\n\nAveragespeed\n- 83k\nFuselage\ntorn\n\n-_\n\n--\n\n\'-7\n\nAveragespeed\n- 136k\n\n73\n\ni\n\nTbe aceid_nta are divided into three grouim whieli are diwu_d\n\nas follows:\n\n1.\n\nTwelve nceidenta invalved a slight break(a) or fracture in which fuselage sections did not\nseparate far enough for a person to be ejected or for a peraon to crawl or step out during\nevacuation (cla,- 1). These accidents generally occur on or near the airport and as a result of\nlanding overruns, takeoff abort, or veering off the rustway. Impact which caused the fuselage\nbreak usually occurred after comddcrable brake action plus decelecatiolxs off the runway.\nOnly two of the accidenta (16.0%) involved a severe fuel fire, and only 6.3% of the persons\nonbeard in these 12 accidents were fatalities.\n\n2.\n\nTwenty accidents involved a clean, wide break in which the fuselage section remained\nbasically intact hut separated far enough for a person to be ejected or to crawl/step out (class\n2). About 75% of these accidents involved severe fuel fires end 29.4% of the persons onbeard\nin these 20 accidents were fatalities. Approximately half of these accidents involved aircraft\nspeed at or near impact of 100 knot_ or more.\n\n3.\n\nSixteen accidents involved cmtsiderable destruction of the fuselage sections and in most cases\nthe sections slid or traveled many feet after separation (class 3). During this movement\npersons were often thrown/ejected from the remains of the fuselage section. In some cases\nejected persons were killed from trauma, al_d in other cases the ejected persons survived\nbecause they were thrown out of a fire or burn area. About 93.8% of these accidents involved\nsevere fuel fires and 77.8% of those onboard in these 16 accidents were fatalities. In most\ncases the aircraft speed at impact was well over 100 knots -- two of the_ had an impact\nspeed of 188 and 271 knots, yet some persons survived. Many accidents in this group can be\nconsidered to be only msrginslly survivable.\n\nIt can be concluded that the probability of fatalities in accidents resulting in fuselage breaks\nduring ground slides is closely related to aircraft speed at the time of impact that breaks the\nfuselage. The group of aecidcqts resulting in only slight breaks (class 1) had an average aircroft\nimpact speed of 57 knots and 6.3% of those on board were fatalities. The group resulting in a clean\n(but open) break (class 2) had an average speed of 88 knots and-29.4% were fatalities. The group\nresulting in a torn fuselage (class 3) had an average speed of 136 knots and 77.8% were fatslities.\nThe greater the spee,J, the greater the fuselage damage and the greater probability of fuel tank\nrupture causing severe fire. However, even in the worst cases, rome persons onboard survived.\nDe*dgnchanges that would result in a stronger fnselage that is more resistant to fragmentations\nshould provide a substantial increase in survivability for those onboard.\nFUSELAGE LOWER SURFACE RUPTURE (Excluding Fuselage Break Accidents)\nOf the 1B3 impact survivable accidents in this study, 57 aircraft ere known to have experienced\ncongi_iersbledamage to the lower fuselage and little or no damage to the upper fuselage (above the\nfloor line). Seventeen of these 57 were fatal accidents, with 17.5% of the persons oubeard being\nfatalities. In addition to the accidents noted above, there are seven accidents that probeb_.y\nexperienced fuselage lower surface damage: three of them, were fatal accident_ with 45.8% of the\npersens unheard being fatalities.\nLower surface damage accidents are divided into three groups for study porpowe: ext_nsive\nrupture, minor or moderate damage, and those involving water entry. Statistical data on these\naccidents are tabulated on figure 4.12. The three groups are diseuseed as follows:\n1.\n\n74\n\nTwenty,eight accidents experienced extensive d_mage and rupture of the fuselage lower\nsurface. Eleven of these were fatal accidents with 27.7% of the total onbeard the 28 accidents\n\nbeing filtalitics. A sew, re ficu occurred in 15 of the accidente and 9 of these were tile flltal\naccidcnts. Six otlwr accidents involved a minor or moderate fire with no fatalities.\n2.\n\nTwenty-five accidents experienced nloderate or minor damage of tbc fusclage lower surfiwe.\n(If these only tbrcc were fatal accidents, with 1.5% of those onboard the 25 accidents being\nfa talil its.\nSix of these accidents involw+d a severe fuel fire, four involved a moderate or nfinur fire, and six\nhad no fire retxwted. Of the three fatal accidents, two had severe fires and one a moderate fire.\nSix accidents iuwdved nose gear collapsing aft into the lower fuselage. One resulted in a\nsevere fire (friction ignited) which destroyed the aircraft and one resulted in a moderate fire\n{friction ignited) which resulted in substantial damage. In anntber case of friction firc, the aft\nfu_lage broke and was dragged on the runway.\nIn design, the prevention of friction fires is treated by separation of flammable materials from\nthe proxinfity of friction sparks or heated structure. In operation, rapid action by the airport fire\nfighting team has reduced the effect of the friction fire.\n\n3.\n\nFour accidents involved water entry: that is, touchdown in deep water or rolling into deep water\nat high speed such that the lower surface of the fuselage was torn or ruptured but the fuselage\ndid not break. Three of these four accidents resulted in extensive lower surface damage and\nthe aircraft sank rapidly. All three were fatal accidents with 18,1% of persons onbeard being\nfatalities. One ace{den\', resulted in moderate damage to the lower surface as the aircraft roiled\ninto water and came to rest on its gear with the water level at or slightly above tbe cabin floor.\nThere were no falnlities. These accidents were also discussed before, in this section, nnder\nbeading \'*Deep Water Entry Accidents."\n\nLower fuselage tear or rupture generally occur when landing gear fails to support the aircraft. Thus.\nscrubbing on rough surfaces (sometimes even on the runway) rips open the thin skins and body\nframes. At the same time, wing box fuel tanks are also subject to rupture and fuel spillage. In 37 of\n53 ground slide accidents the wing box was probably ruptured and, of these, fire occurred in 32 -25 were severe fires and 12 were minor or moderate fires,\nIt can be concluded that the probability of fatalities in accidents resulting in lower fuselage tear or\nrupture during ground slide is closely related to the occurrence of severe fuel fire. Flame and smoke\nfrom fuel burning on the ground below and around the fuselage have, in many cases, rapidly entered\nthe passenger area via openings in the lower fuselage. If openings had not been present, the\nprecious minute or two required for skin burn-through would probably be adequate for evacuating\nmost or all persons via escape routes away frum burn areas. Of the 12 fatal accidents during ground\nslide, 11 had severe fire and one had a moderate fire.\nFUSELAGE\n\nFLOOR DISPLACEMENT\n\nDisplacement and rupture of the passenger floor Ires resulted in passenger and crew injuries, and\nhas restricted umvement of sun\'ivors to exits. In SOmecases the upward movement of the floor has\nresulted in the jamming of door_; or door frames and in other eases doors could not be opened due to\nfloor dcbias bhwking the door. G,meraily, floor surface displacement is a result of the structural floor\nheams being torn, ruptured, an\xc2\xa2_displaced upwards by _.heimpact forces of cargo, cargo containers,\nseparated hmding gear or ground objects. The exception to this is floor displacement\nby the\nhydraulic actmn of water when the aircraft touches down in water or rails into water at bigb speed in these cases the floor beam may not be displaced upward.\n\n711\n\nOf the 163 accidents in this study, 36 are known or reported to have experienced paseenger or\ncrow area floor displacameut or rupture and probably in 4 other accidents, Statistical data en these\noccurrences are tshulated in figure 4,13, For study purposes, these 36 accidents are divided into\nthree groups: 15 that did not i,lvolve a fuselage break, 17 that did involve a fuselage break, end 4\nthat involved the aircraft touching down or overrunning into water, These groups ur_ disc.ssc,d as\nfollows:\n1.\n\nOf the 15 arcideuts which did not have fuselage breaks. 8 involved displacement upwards of\nthe cabin floor as a result of the uose gear foldinglcnllalming aft into the lower forward fuselage\ncargo compartment or electronic compartment. Displaced cargo or electronic equipment\nforced the floor up and probably tore or bent the floor beam. In four of these accidents the\ncockpit door was jenzmed, and in two the entrance door was jammed or blocked. None of these\nwere fatal accidents, however, one resulted in a friction-ignited fire at the nose gear fires which\nspread and destroyed the aircraft.\nSeven other accidentsinvolved a ground slide in which the fuselage lower surface was torn or\ncrushed upward-such that floor and floor beams were displaced upwards in localized areas, In\none of these a main la_ding gear aeasmbly rolled/tumbled under the fuselage and caused much\nof the damage. In three accidents, an entrance door was jammed or blocked by the floor.\nPassenger seat elevations occurred in seven accidents which contributed to passenger\ninjuries. In three accidents passenger seat separations occurred. Accident reports in these\neases did not mention seat separation or floor displacement as interferring with\npassenger egress.\n\n2,\n\nSeventeen accidents which had fuselage breaks al_ had areas where the floor was displaced\nupwards. These accident8 tend to be more severe than those without fuselage breaks. If\nfuselage separation is complete and wide enough for human end Beat ejection, the impact of\npassenger floor elevation or rupture is probably slightly minimized. In 13 accidents passenger\nseat separation was reported, in 9 accidents seat elevation was reported, but in only 4\naccidents was passanger egress reported to have been impeded. It is not lulown how much\nimpact the elevated or broken floor bad on passenger egress, Passenger entry door jam was\nreported in five accidents and crew door jam in two accidents, Cause of these door jams in\nmost cases could not be established with any t.ertainty but was probably due to either floor\nelevation/rupture or due to fuselage break if tl_e break was adjacent to the door,\n\n3.\n\nCrewlpassenger floor elevation and rupture occurred in four accidents which involved the\naircraft touching down in deep water or rolling into water at high speed, In these cases the\nlower fuselage surface was torn open and the lower (cargo) area filled with water. Hydraulic\nactien/pressure forced the floor panel upward, causing seat separation in two accidents end\nseat elevation in three accidents, Exit doors were found to be blocked in two accidents.\n\nIn one accident, the forward closet dislodged. It shifted forward in such a way that the forward\nentrance door was partially blocked and delayed opening of the door. Also a section of floor\ncame up and provided an opening in which two of the crew fell into the lower forward\ncompartment.\n\n_:\n\nIn another accident, nose gear separated and tumbled aft, forcing up and rupturing the lower\nfuselage. Floor besm$ and floor panels were elevated causing passenger seats to tilt\nbackwards and block emergency exits on both sides of the fuselage.\n\n--__\n\nAvailable accident data provides evidence that displat_.ment, elevation, or dislodging of the\n\n=._-\n\npassenger/cockpit floor system in localized areas has resulted in passenger and crew injuries and\n\n*** ,\n\nm\n\n....................................................\n\n,d\n\nhas, in varying degrees, interferred with or delayed the evacuation of passenger and craw.\nHowever, accident reports generally provide very little detailed information on this type of damage\nunless it is related to the cause of the accident. Studies of these areas must rely on brief statements\nand accident photographs which seldom "zeroin" on the desired areas. It is concluded from rewewe\nof available data that a floor system more resistant to tear/rupture/separation, though still flexible,\nmay reduce some of the debris and factors which are believed to impede evacuation of the aircraft.\nENGINE/PYLON SEPARATION-OR-COLLAPSE\nSeparation of an engine from the pylon or separation of the pylon from the wing or body often occurs\nin accidents involving touchdown, short/hard touchdown, overruns, or veering off the runway. When\none or both main landing gear collapse during these types of oeeurrencea, the probability of engine\npod damage or separation is increased. Generally, loss of the engine (forward or reverse thrust) is of\nminor significance but ruptm.ingof the engine fuel feed line (releasing fuel) and tearing of electrical\nleads (causing arcing) can be a hazard because of the potential for a \xc2\xa3L_e\noccurring at the fuel feed\nline break point. The significance of.this pylon break fire hazard increases if the wing fuel tanks are\nruptured and large qtumtities of fuel are released on the ground. It is believed that the engine and the\npylon break fires have been the ignition source for many of the fuel tank \xc2\xa3_res.Accident reports\nseldom-eanfirm or deny this, since it is not generally possible to establish from evidence at the\naccident site what actually provided the ignition source. In some occurrences, friction sparks from\nwing or fuselage sliding on terrain may have caused ignition of released tank fuel only seconds or --.\nmicroseconds before an engine pylon fire occurred, There is no known way to establish the actual\nsequence of the events. However, from a review of accident data, there appears to be a relationship\nbetween wing tank ruptures, severe fuel fires, and pylon break fires that indicates pylon break fires\nprobably provided the source of ignition for released fuel in many accidents.\nOf the 153 accidents in this crashworthiness study, 94 involved aircraft with engines on wing pods\nand 59 involved aircraft with engine pods on the aft fuselage. These two groups of aircraft are\nreviewed separately.\nWing Pod Engined Airoraft Accidents\nOf the 94 accidents (including known and probable occurenesa) involving wing pod engined aircraft,\n67 (71%)involved rupturing of the wing box fuel tank and 68 (72%) involved collapse or separation of\nthe engine pylon to the extent that the engine fuel feed line was torn or ruptured. The occurrence of\nthese two types of damage are shown in figure 4.14.\nFuel fires originating at the fracture of the.engine fuel feed line in the pylon are reported to have\noccurred in 12 accidents and probably occurred in 33 accidents. No fires were reported at this\nfracture point in 23 accidents.\nThe proximity of the wing pod engine to the wing box fuel tanks has resulted in correlations between\nengine separation, fuel tank rupture, and a severe fuel fire. Approximately 71% of the aeei _ents\ninvolved ruptm_ of the fuel tank and releasing fuel on the ground and, of these, 91% were considered\nlarge fuel spills such that the spill area probably wee near or adjacent to the engine pylon location.\nThe study shows that 82% of the large fuel spills resulted in severe fires and, in 78% of these, a\nruptured engine pylon fuel line fire probably also occurred.\nIn numerous accidents, separated engine pods have rolled or tumbled under the wing or fuselage as\nthe aircraft slides to e stop. However, accident reporte seldom indicate that the pod ruptured the\nwing box fuel tank in this movement. In most cases, investigators are probably unable to determine\nwhat objects actually caused tank rupture.\n\n79\n\nTotal study\nAccidents\n153\n\nI\n\n1\nongme A/C\n94\n\n!\nungine A.C\n59\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFigure 4.15\n\n|\n\nI\n\nFuel tank\n\n|\n\nNo fuel\n\n67\nspdls\n\nJ\n\n27\nlank spdl\n\nt\n\nI\nbreak\n15\nI Engine pylon\n\nI\npylonbreak\n12\nNo engine\n\nI\n\n,\n\niFu""\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0I\nII\nIme fire\nI1\n\ntire\n4\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nspdl\n61\nLarge fuel\n\nfuel spill\n6\nSmall reed\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n/\n\nI\n\ni\n\nTank fuel\n\nNo lank\n\nTank luel\n\nNo tank\n\n50\nfire\n\nL\n\n11\nfuel lire\n\n4\nfire\n\nfuel fire\n\n|\n\nbreak\n43\n\n_\n\n-\n\nI\nfee\n39\n\nI\n\nI\n\npylon break\n\nbreak\n\npylon break\n\n7\n\n3\n\n1\n\n,\n\nI\nI_ne_=re\n4\n\nI\nBk no fire\n5\n\nhre\n2\n\nI\n\nI\nhne fire\nt\n\n,,\nbk.\n\nfire\n2\n\nFigure4.14-EnginelPylonSeparation/Collapseand Fuel TankRupture, WingPod Engined Aircraft\n\nb\n\nAft Body Engined Aircraft Aecidnntu\nOf the 59 accidents involving aft bodyengined aircraft, 38 (64%) involved rupturing of the wing box\nengine pylon\nfuel tanks aud 21 (:36%)invulvod collapse or separation of of these two typesto tile extent that the\neugine fuel feed llne was torn or ruptured.

Of the 21 occurrences involving engine/pylon collapse or separation, 7 resulted from\na very hard touchdown, 7 due to impact with grouud objects, and 7 due to high vertical loads as the\naircraft slid over rough ground or impacted water. No engine pod separations were known to be .........\ncaused by pod ground contact during aircraft slide on the lower fuselage.\nFuel fires originating at the fracture of the engine fuel feed line in the pylon are reported to have\noccurred in two accidents and probably occurred in five accidents. Reports indicate that no fire\noccurred at this fracture poiut in 14 accidents.\nSevere wing tank fuel fires occurred in 26 accidents but, of these, engine/strut fuel line fires were\nreported in I and probably occurred in 5. This indicates that wing tank fuel, in 77% of these cases,\nwas ignited by something other than by an engine fuel feed line fire. In the other 23%(six cases) the\nreports do not indicate or show evidence that the engine fuel feed line fire provided the ignition\nsource for the wing tank fuel fire. In most accidents, the-investigaters are probably unable to\ndetermine the actual source of the spilled tank fuel ignition.\nEngine Fuel Feed Line Fire Hazards\nIn the 153 accidents used in this study, loss or collapse of an engine or pylon generally creates a\npotential hazard only if a fire occurs at the point of fuel feed line rupture and, if in flight, the fire is\nsustained for possibly 30 seconds or more. In wing pod mounted engine aircraft, the hazard is\nignition of spilled wing tank fuel or overheating of wing fuel tanks to the point of explosions or skin\nburn-through. If tank fuel is not ignited, the engine strut fire itself generally has little impact on\npassenger evacuation or survivability.\nIn aft body engined aircraft, the hazard is burn-through of the aft body shirm and a fuel line fire\nburning vital controls and systems within the aft body. These fires, being remote from the wing\nbox fuel tanks, are a po\'_ntiai source of ignition of tank fuel only if the-tank fuel is spilled in the\narea under or around the aft engines.\nConclusions:\nI.\n\nEngine fuel line fires caused by engine separation or coLlapse are a hazard of\nunderdetermined dimensions, particularly in wing pod engined aircraft accidents. The source\nof ignition of spilled tank fuel is seldom reported and probably, in most cases, cannot be\nactually determined. Nevertheless, research should be accomplished in the area of\nminimizing the flow or volume of fuel released from a fractured engine fuel feed line and\neliminating the sources of ignition of this fuel.\n\n2.\n\nWing box fuel tanks have, on rare occasions, been tern open when engine pylon separates\nfrom wing structure. Study should be accomplished to develop structure fuse points to assure\na clean strut separation. This could include clean fuel line separations and electrical lead\nseparations without arcing.\n\ni\n\nI_\n\n3.\n\nlanding gear.

In tOof the 47 accidents, where door/exit problems were cited, the reports\nalso indicated that some paseengers and crew departed via breaks and holes in the fuselage. In\nmost cases these people could have also departed through available doors or exits. However, ina\nfew cases the fuselage break was probably the only means of escape.\nin many accidents which involved severe fuel fires, some doors or exits could have been readily\nopened but were not used because of fire in that particular area outside the fuselage.\nAvailable factual date relating to the 47 accidents citing door/exit problen-- are tabulated in figure\n4.16. These date indicate that most occurrences (57%) involve doors at the front of the fuselage\nand only 16% at mid-bedy and 27% at the aft fuselage. This ratio is expected since in ground slide\nr:cidents the forward fuselage is the first to impact objects such as buildings, trees, poles, etc.\nThese data also indicate that forward fuselage doors involved jamming in 64% of the cases and\nblockage in 36% of the cases. Doors in the aft fuselage had approximately the same ratio. Mid-body\nexits, however, had this ratio reversed with blockage being 64% of the cases and jamming only\n36% of the cases. It is probable that wing box structure provides protection from jamming of the\nmid-body overwing exits.\n\n_"\n\nConsidering all doors/exits, jamming is reported in 59% of the cases and blockage in 41% of\nthe cases.\nJamming is generally caused by door frame distortions, however, accident reports seldom\nprovide much detail on how or what caused the problem. Floor-lift due to upward forces from\nthe cargo area often cause total or partial jamming of doors, The same upward forces may\nalso cause door frame distortion. In a few eases evacuation slides are involved in door\njamming.\n\nB\n\nBlockage is generally caused by collapsing of overhead storage compartments and release of\nthe contents. This debris usually results in complete inability to open the door or exit.\nSpillage of galley contents occurs frequently, which tends to cause a delay in opening the\ndoor. In a few cases displacement of a galley or coat storage compartment has caused door\n\nD\n\n_\n:_\n\nblockage, particularly at the forward fuselage locations.\nThe number of fat_tlltica that were a direct result of door jamming or blockage can seldom be\ndetermined or even estimated from available data. Of the 47 accidents in which door/exit problems\n\n:_\n\nwere cited, only 24 involved fatalitee (2187 t_,_.l onboard of which 753 or 34.4% were fatalities).\n\n_:_ .\n\nOf the 24 accidents with fatalities, 9 had 2 or more doors or exits jammed or blocked and 41.9% of\nand 27.1% of those onbeard were fstelitica.\n\n83\n\'=\n\nthose onbeard were fatalities, In the other 15 accidents only t door or exit was jammed or blocked\n\nIb\n\n\'1\n\nFrom this study of door and exit problems during emergency evacuations, it can be concluded that\n_urvivehility might be increased if floors and structure in the area of eaeb entry and galley door be\ndesigned to eliminate jamming of doors, and if overhead storage compartments he dcsigued to\nresist collapse and reduce door blockage.\nWATER ENTRY\nAccidents in which aircraft impact water or come to rest in deep water involve special hazards. In\nscenario type 813, 46.3% of the occupants drowned. There are 16 water aecidente in the data base\nof which water was an important factor in 11 cases. These 11 eases arc reviewed.\nWater eases that are excluded are the 707 COo accident, L-1011 Everglades accident, 727\nMaderia accident, 727 Mexico City accident, and the 707 Rio de Janerio accident. These accidents\nrseulted in trauma fatalities for the most part, and water was only incidental to the accident outcome.\nWater entry accidents of concern appear to have some common factors. First, they usually occur at -night. Second, there is usually a relatively rapid lose of flotation resulting in a portion or all of the\naircraft sinking. Third, while there has been confusion, most occupants have been able to evacuate\nthe aircraft. Finally, many of the drowning fatalities occur after the occupants have left\nthe aircraft.\nAssessment of the water entry accidents is shown in figure 4.17. The accidents are divided into two\ngroups: high energy impact and slide/roll into the water. There are eight high energy accidents. For\nthe CaravelleMaderia accident all that is known is that the aircraft touched down at sea, the fuselage\nis presumed to have broken, and the numbers of fatalities and injuries. Consequently, it is classified\nunknown. The DC-9 Palermo accident has a little data and is classified known, but is borderline.\nThere are three cases where the aircraft rolled or slid into the water. For all of these accidents the\nfuselage.experienced either lower surface crush or had one or more breaks.\nIn all the high energy impacts there was a loss of flotation attributed primarily to _\'\'\'\nselage damage.\nWhile tank rupture resulted in some loss of buoyancy, the majoreffect of tank rupt;_-. was to expose\n_\noccupants to fuel (chemical burns) and to make everything slippery.\nThe floor system was known to be disrupted in six of eight accidents. Disruption was due in part to\nthe hydrodynamic forces of water entering the fuse]l!ge throufh the underside or ti_rough b;_eaksin\nthe fuselage.\nA part of this disruption resulted in displacement and elevation of floor beams with subsequent\nseparation of seats, and also contributed to problems in the evacuation of the aircraft. In addition,\ndoors were jammed and debris from cabin interior systems was present. In the 727 Pensacola\naccident, water destroyed the lower fuselage, ruptured the body fuel lines, and separated an engine.\nAccidents where aircraft skidded or rolled into water experienced similar damage as the high energy\nimpact, but to a lesser degree. However, close proximity of land, substantially reduced drowning.\nThe 15 drownings in the DC-8 Rio de Jansrio accident were attributed to disorientation of the\noccupants after they evacuated the aircraft and to improper use of flotation devices.\nAfter the DC-9 St. Croix accident, a special study (ref, 2) was made by the NTSB on water ditching.\nHere, even though it was known that ditching was inevitable, 23 occupants drowned. There were\nproblems with life rafts, life vests, and seat belts. Other problems with this equipment were\nencountered in the DC-8 Lea Angeles accident. It is felt that incidence of drowning could be\nsubstantially reduced by better location of life rafts. For instance, placement of rafts above the exits\nwith external access might provide better accessibility.\n\n_5\n\nI_\n\n\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\n\nkl.\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_-\n\nI\n\n_\n\nI\n\no\n\nI\n\n--\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n*\n\nm\n\n\'--"1\n\nI\n,__\n"Jr"\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_g\n\n,_, ,_o,_\xc2\xb0\n_6\n\nImproved crashworthinsce might also be obtained by inereasing the resistance of the fuselage to\nbreaks and by increasing tho resistance of the lower fuselage to water penetration,\nADVANCED MATERIALS\nThe application of advanced materials such as improved metal alloys and composites to structure\nthat has a significant crash function is now considered. As seen from the above diseussion, the\nconventional commercial aluminum jet transport aircraft designed to FAR 25 have demonstrated__\ngenerally good structural crashworthy characteristics.\nConsequently, those materials having fracture, impact and ductility properties similar to aluminum\nmight be expected to be applicable on a direct substitution basis without affecting erashworthinece.\nWhere the properties are dissimilar, such as for com_uestiuns\nare raised on how to maintain\nan adequate level of crashworthinese.\nThere is little data available on the crash behavior of eompceite sizueturce. The U.S. Army has active\nprograms directed towards the application of composites in heiicoptare as part of the ACAP and in\nsponsored research. In addition there are military research programs on ballistic damage to\ncomposite structure. Results of thcee programs will provide valuableinformation. While these results\nmay not be directly applicable to the commercial jet transport, they may suggest approaches to\nresearch that may be fruitful.\nUse and planned use of advanced composites in both military and commercial aircraft is in a rapidly\nexpanding mode. Use of graphite/epoxy as a viable material for aerospace structures became a\nserious consideration in the mid-1960s with the development of Thornel graphite fibers by Union\nCarbide.Inithlly, treeof the material was hamperedby high cost and lack of technical data. Currently,\nboth of these factors have been alleviated so that extensive use of the material is both feasible and\nadvantageous. The impetus is the typically 20 to 30 percent reduction in structural weight that can\nbe realized with accompanying increases in fuel economy or aircraft performance.\nThe application of composites on military aircraft is moving rapidly. The F.18 has wing skins and tail\nstructures of graphite. The entire-wing st_lcture of the AV-8B Harrieris graphite, as are the forward\n\nPlanned use of graphite on future commercial transport aircraft is also aggreceive. The Lear Fan\nfuselage and tail.\naircraft is all composite structure and the Falcon 10 will have a graphite/epoxy wing box structure.\nThe 757 and 767 aircraft will have control surfaces of graphite. These include the spoilers, ailerons,\nelevators, and rudders. Main landing gear doors will be a combination of graphite and Kevlar. There\nare also nations plans for other downstream uses of graphite on the 757. These include use of\ngraphite for selected floor beams and for horizontal and vertical empennage inspar structures. Use of\ngraphite for such part_ as the main landing gear beam and flaps is also under study.\n\ni_\n1\n\nGraphite composites are used on the 757 and 767 aircraft for some components. Meat applications\nare for secondary structure. Application in control surfaces follows Boeing\'s successful program\nwith NASA, which tested and certified graphite/epoxy elevators for the 727. A similar program is\nunderway for the 737 horizontal stabilizer. Graphite 737 stabiliser components have been\nsuccessfully ground and flight tested and certification is expected in the near future.\n\ni_\n\nIn considering the various aircraft parts which will be fabricated from composites, it must be\nemphasized that these will be designed and tested to meet the requirements of FAR 25. As an\nexample, floor beams will be analyzed and tested to ensure their being able to withstand the\n\n87\n\nstipulated 9 g wat for, _n.

The\nU.S. Army\'e Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide (ref. 5), which provides a crashworthineee\ntechnical base for light aircraft and helicopters in military applications, is revicwed for\napplicability to commercial jet transport aircraft.\n\n_\'\n\nAnalytical methods for modeling the occupant response to a crash environment are reviewed and\nassessed. Human impact tolerance is reviewed and problems of relating impact injury to\nengineering quantities are discussed. In addition, the applicability of gQnaral]y recognized\ntolerance limits to the population of aircraft occupants is considered,\nThe status of analytical methods for treating nonlinearities in inelastic structural behavior and\nlarge deflection geometry is reviewed. A review of crash tests of complete aircraft and of\nexperimental tasting of structural components has been made. A survey of impact teat facilities is\npresentod and problems of testing complete commercial jet transport aircraft and structural\ncomponents is discussed.\nAn assessment of current crashworthinee8 technology as applied to commercial transport aircraft\nis made. Requirements to improve crashworthines8 engineering are presented and research to\ndevelop the necessary technology is discussed.\nREVIEW OF U.S. ARMY CRASH SURVIVAL DESIGN GUIDE\nThe guidelines proposed in the new U.S. Army\'s Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide have been\nexamined to identify areas relevant to commercial airplaneS.\nThe Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide contains a summary of material that provides a\nbackground on crashworthinese in general. Specific application of the guidelines to commercial\naircraft has been asseseed. Appendix D presents a detailed synthesis of principles, practices and\ncomments based on abstracting the.Guide and incorporating other experiences, opinions and data.\nThe new U.S. Army\'s Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide defines a number of goals that the U.S.\nArmy desires to _chieve in order to improve protection in Army aircraft. Evolution of these goals\ninto clear-cut design criteria is a continuing proce_; this third update of the Guide incorporates\nfeedback from interim experience, points out the likely need for design trode-offs more clearly\nthan the previous editions, and as clearly points out compromises will likely remain after all\npossible trade-offs are complete. Two factors emerged from investigation of the Guide that bear\ncomment_ the autonomous role the Army ha_ in exploring new concepts, including freedom to\nwaive requirements; and the distinctions in vehicles and corresponding impact conditions from\nArmy aircraft to large commercial aircraft.\nFirst the autonomous role of the Army and the aircraft they fly gives them many options in\nexploring protective provieioue. They have small vehicles (less than 20-passenger maximum\ncapacity and more typically lees than 5) with relatively cle_cut implications md ramifications for\nany changes that might be considered.\nAdditionally, as specification engineer, purchaser, and user, the Army is in a position to review\ntrsde-offs and waive goals, guidelines, and criteria when warranted. Under current regulatory\nprocedures, this is not peseible in the commercial environment; requirements, once established,\nmay not be waived. This helps to clarify why goals, guidelines, and criteria are not clearly\ndistinguished in the Army\'e Guide; such waiver authority makes it possible to emphasize\n\n93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n\nm\n\nI\n\nt\n\nt\n\ntt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ntl\n\n,m\n\n"lnaximnm possible protection" and explore now concepts, Autononlous phmning, purchasing, and\ntruer roles also make it more feasible to explore and appraise ideas that can not he easily\ndctennined or demonstrated by analysis or may be ntcrproted differently by i ld vidt a[ reviewers\n(e,g., "provide as much protection as possible\').\nOther industry sogment_ have a different circumstsnce; by design ne_\'e_ity, objectives are based\nun nfinimum atweptable requirements for adequate protection under given circumstances,\nObjectives are jnstificd as actnany heing proven and beneficial, the waiver authority used in the\nArmy does not exist in the commercial environment.\nSecondly, there is considerable difference in likely impact characteristics between the small, rigid\nbody aircraft used by the Army and the large, flexible body aircraft used commercially. Army\ngoals are based on systems which will suffer a larger range of impact attitudes and higher impact\nloads. For example, spin-in and rotor, thrashing causes large lateral forces _md upside down\nimpacts that are sssontiaUy unheard of in large fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, there is a\nmarked difference in itdlerent energy absorbing features between the two airplane types. For\nexample, the small airplane has a much smaller subfloor volume, fewer structural members, and a\ncorrespondingly more rigid structural area to absorb energy than exists for the large cross section\nof the flexible-body aircraft. Some of the resulting implications are inferred in the Guide. They\npoint out, for exeanple, that cargo tiedown criteria from the Atany Guide are much larger than Air\nForce practices\xc2\xb0 but ackuowledge that there is no statistical reason to change ?;r Force criteria.\n\n"\'\n\nThe above describes some of the reasons to question direct transfer of guidelines or specifications\nfrom the Army Guide to commercial systems. Although many of the principles apply, are relevant,\nand are practiced, criterion bases are clearly different. Relevant criteria have been abstracted and\ncollated from the Guide, and the resulting interpretation and commentary is presented in\nappendix D. The new Guide npdates previous guidelines and goals based on Army\'s experience and\ntheir recognition of broader research and development activities over the last 10 years. In addition\nto data in the Guide, new information continues to he developed and earlier information continues\nto be clarified. Some such information is added to Guide information in appendix D (e.g., for\ntolerance and restraints).\nThe review of the Guide suggests some reseat\'eh topics and tools that arc warranted, can be worked\nusefully, and will improve the technology for impact protection. Army goals to improve\nsurvivability for impacts of smaU aircraft include four major areas: (1) system design for structural\nintegrity, energy abserptian, and post-impact provisions; (2)design principles for impart\nprotection via aircraft 8eats, restraints, litters, and padding; (3) medeling and testing methods for\nappraising impact loads, load paths and their effects; and (4)hunmn impact tolerance\nattd protection.\nSystem dssign considerations in the Army continue to emphasize energy absorption and postcrnsh\nprotection. Newly under consideration are possible ways to avoid reductiun of and intrusion into\noccupiable volume caused by intpact loading.\n_nergy absorptiml at the structural level remains a difficult concept to design and control.\nAbsorbing provisions include gear, wings, fuselage, seats, litters, and restraints. Dynamic\ninteractiooa at the system level are so cmnplicated that final resolutien of qut,stions by the Army is\nstill by test -- fall-seule drop tests are practiced, However, several computer models |)residing full\nsystem simulation have bcen under development for several y_,ars and are approaching stages\nwhere they should be challenged by attempts at real calibration and applicatkm.\n\n_._.\n_\'r\nfin\xc2\xb0\n\n_g\n\nPostcresh survival continues to receive very heavy emphasis in connnereiai systems.

Four examples are: (1) fuel inarting actuation by impact acceleration, may w,_rk on\nimpact, but may also actuate at altitude in turbulence acceleration,, (2) heat resistant slides are\nbeing developed, but some may not be etowablo withoui, r._im" changes and others may have a\nshort storage life; (3) some design features for control of fuel line disturbances are proving\n\nis\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n"\n\nt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nof fire propagation to imprc,;c ._deretanding of and ability to centre! fires, end simulation of\neffective; (4) computer simulations of some processes are being explored, for example, simulation\nevacuation performance to provide an in, proved engineering tool.

They could\nbe used to explore and develoR effective energy absorbing seat-restraint concepts, and _,ffera costM\n\'\n......\nand time-effectiveJ approach to resolving energy absorption questions for the new composite\nmaterials technology. But stronger does not automatically mean safer, and a rigid 20Composites not\nnecessarily provide the protection of \xe2\x80\xa2 ductile seat that starts yielding at lesser loads, g seat will do\nnot feature the same ductilities as metals, and consequently possess different energy absorbing\ncharacteristics. Accordingly, use of composites may require alternative desigl_ concepts (e.g.,\ndifferent seat leg design) in order _ h,,nefit from the design advantages of composites without losing\nthe energy absorption features ot T_,, t,_rlier metal seating systems.\nModeling coupled with testing couldbecome e memtiagful combination for developing and evaluating\nsystem design concepts. Some existing mod_,_..:\'_r structure, seat, restraint, and occupants could\nbe calibrated to real world ol_ct\'v,t_oil.:, integrated into a single system concept and used for\nadvanced concept evaluations, for identifying specific data and test needs, and for predicting the\noutcome of major system tests. An overview of the models that could be used for this purpose is\npresented in table 5.1.\nThe desirable approach would be in two phases. First, experience with the various models is now\nsufficient, and it should be feasible to develop a detailed specification to define and develop a series\nof modules to permit exploration and development of individual elements that could be combined to\nestimate the performance of the occupant, restraint, seat, and structure. Second, it is necessary to\ndevelop and demonstrate calibrated three-dimensiona_ performance against real test data, and\ndefine ground rules for appropriate use of 2-D and 3-D models. Some models, such as\nPROMETHEUSIH.ere two-dimensional but can demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in predicting\nto a test situation. Some added features may be needed to complete 2-D applications potential (e.g.,\nin simulating an energy absorbing, deforming seat). From this result, and auociated knowledge it will\nbe easy to identify and develop 3.D refinements. The 3-D capability would complete occupant\ndevelopment needs and also help to discriminate when 2-D and 3-D models might be appropriate.\nHuman impact tolerance date continues to be in dire need, Data, indices, and estimates of tolerances\nare limited in beth accuracyand scope of applicability. Obviously, tolerance limit data are not readily\nacquired. However, new data below the tolerance hazards continues to be generated and will be\nneeded to reduce or eliminate the current constraints on data (see Human Impact Tolerance, and\napp. D).\n\n95\n\n9:\nh\n\nt\n\nTable 5. i-Plan\nNeeded\n\n\' .\n\nModel/module\nPurpose\nOccupant\nSimulation\n\nRestraint\nSimulation\n\nSeat\nSimulation\n\nStructure/\nFuselage\n\nApprmso\nPotentially\nUsablemodels"\nPROMETHEUS III\nSOM-LA\nCALSPAN\nATB (articulated\ntotal body)\nPROMETHEUS Ill\nSOM.LA\nAT8\nPROMETHEUS III\nSOM-LA\nDYCAST\nKRASH\nADINA\nDYCAST\nKRASH\nADINA\nACTION\n\nfor Developing\n\nNeeded Models\nDevoloplcalibrate\nDevelop specification Models/modules\nSynlhesize elements\nFrom known models\n\nReline synthesized\nModel(s)\n\nOCCUI\n\nLaboratory data\nArmy drop tests\nNASA tests\nDC-7 test\nConstellation\nTest\nFAA tests\n\nPrudicf te\nNew lusts\n\nRESTR 1\n\nr\n\nPlanned\n1984\nNASA-FAA\nDrone\nTest\n\nSET \'1\n\nSTRUK 1\n\n"Improvementsin existing models taughtbe accomphshed by including small packages such as the FEAP 74\nstructuralcontact model\n\n,qt{\n\ntp.\n\nMore definitive research is needed for effective use of human tolerance data.

One., two-, and threedimensional models have been developed. More broadly described in this present report are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nDynamic Response Index (DRI) (ref. 6)\nSeat Occupant Model: Light Aircraft (SOM-LA)(rof. 7)\nPROMETHEUS (now PROMETHEUS HI, ref. 8), two-dimansionul, restraint performance\nintegrated with body dynamics and other outputs similar to SOM-LA\n\nOCCUPANT MODELING SUMMARY\nThree occupant_simulation computer programs are evaluated in the following diseus_ions for their\nability to produce useful engmesring data regarding relative safety of a restrained occupant a 1-D\nmodel (DRI), a 2-D model (PROMETHEUS 111)and a 3-D model (SOM-LA).\nThe one-dimensional model (DILl) is usable only for seat ejection evaluation and is of no use for\nevaluating the safety of commercial aircraft. The two-dimensional model (PROMETHEUS HI)is\nsuitable for producing sophisticated engineering trade-off data and is being used for this purpose,\nsubject to the limitations imposed by the 2-D nature of the simulation. The 3-D model (SOM.LA)\nneeds modeling improvements before being usable for engineering purposes. Needed\nimprovements are technicallydifficult and fall into the realm of applied research. Although SOM-LAis\nnot currently adequate for evaluation of restraint system performance, it provides e rough\napproximation of the gross motion of the occupant for purposes of approximating the dynamic loads\noa the structure. The possibility of merging these programs with a large finite-element computer\nprogram such as DYCAST will bealso considered and a procedure for accomplishinv_the merging\nwill be proposed.\n\nII\n]\n\nI\nt\n\nI\n\nComputer modeling of nonlinear transient structural dynamics is e relatively new technology, and\nstandards defining a "good" structural dynamics computer program are still evolving. (OccupantPROGRAMis e special type of structural dynamics). As a consequence, each new structural\nsimulation CALIBRATION\ndynamics computer program must individually earn acceptance in the engineering community\nbefore its calculations will be utilized by designers.\n\'\n\n1\nI\n\nThere are two aspects to acceptance:\n1.\n\nThe program must produce believable resuita. That is, predicted dynamics should appear\nreasonable and credible to the designer, and the designer should be confident that the\nprogram models the main dynamic effects. To enhance believability, the program output\nshould contain, in readable form, information which assists the desigfier to understand the\ndynamic events (such as time histories of system forces). Graphic aide are also helpful.\n\n2.\n\nProgram accuracy must be demonstrated. That is, demonstration of capability to reasonably\npredict an actual test. Achievement of predictive accuracy is usually a very difficult and time\n\n_\'.1.\n\n!!\n\n97\n\nO, C ,+,*_LPA_\nIS\nOF POOR QUALI+I+y\n\n98\n\n7. \xc2\xb8\n\n" "-\n\no ._\'_ \'\xc2\xae\n.__ _\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n._u._\n\n,,.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n-\n\n-\n\n._\n\n=\no--\n\ni}_\nee\n\n",,,_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\n;o\n\n_L.....\n\n_\n\n,,,\n\n\xc2\xae\n\nc\n\'1_\n\n:_\'_ _\n\no\n\n_\n\n._,_\n\n,, o\n\n_ _:\xc2\xae_o\n\n_,\n\n, "\\\n\n._\n\n|\n\n,-_\n\nT\n\n"_\n\nI_\n_=\n\n_\n\n;._\n\n_ _.\n\nJ_----\n\n_.__\n\n.;\n\n_._\nc_,_\n\no\n\n_\xc2\xae_--_.-\n\n=_.\n\no ,_:_Z_\n\n,.\n\n_\n\n"_\n\n=\n._"\n\n_\'_, -_\n\n, --\n\n._-\n\n._ .\n\n.\n\n.1:: -_\n\n_.\n\n_\n\nA\n\n_ _ _ :_\n\n99\n\nconsuming process for occupant simulation codes because of the nonlinear nature of tile\nproblem and the difficulty in obtaining measured values for input dynamic parameters.\nOne approach was applied in evolving a calibrated level of performance for PROMI_iIEUS II.\nInstrumentation data from _veral sled tests were obtained from CAMI and physical data for the\nanthropomorphic dummies were obtained (limb weights, measurements, and spring constraints).\nThese were cystematically refined by sensitivity testing so that properti\xc2\xa20 could be estimo_d\nwhere measured data could not be found.\nOne of the CAMItests was then simulated by PROMETHEUS. When the initial simulation did not\nprovide satisfactory correlation with test data, the problem was attacked from two directions.\nFirst, it was evident that the restraint system model in PROMETHEUSwa_.inadequate, so a more\nsephlsticated mathematical model of the lap belt and shoulder harness was developed andadded to\nPROMETHEUS. For example, the lap belt was refined to permit the slipping associated with\nsubmarining, the shoulder harness was refined, and chest/shoulder flexibility was added to\nappropriately incorporate haraes_dbody interactions and slipping of the harness on the shoulder.\nThe second approach, which was attempted concurrently with the first, was to parametrically vary\nthe mechanical properties of the simulated occupant (such as neck stiffness and damping) in\nPROMETHEUS simulations and note the resulting trends. Parametric variations helped provide a\n"feel" for-the occupant dynamics and served as sensitivity studies to identify the important\ndynamic parameters. Some dynamic effects were observed which were not influenced by the\nparametric variations. Additional modifications were made to the mathematical modeling in\nPROMETHEUS and parametric evaluations completed to approximate these effects. Additional\ncycles of modeling improvements/parametric variations continued until correlation with actual\ntest data was achieved. The resulting modeling changes to PROMETHEUS were quite extensive;\nso much so that the correlated model was renamed PROMETHEUS HI. Figure 5.1 summarizes\nparametric variations and modeling changes required to achieve calibration. After calibration, an\nindependent test case was simulated with PROMETHEUS, producing good agreement with actual\ntest results involving a real Part 572 dummy in sled te_ting. Figure 5.2 indicates the correlation\nfinally achieved.\nREVIEW OF OCCUPANT.SIMULATION COMPUTER PROGRAMS\nThree occupant.simulation models are reviewed below. These are a one-dimensianal model (the\nspring-mass model associated with the Dynamic Response Index), a two-dimensional model\n(PROMETHEUS 1I]), and a 3-D model (Seat-Occupant Model: Light Aircraft).\nThe models are examined from two viewpoints: first, as a tool for engineering design of a\nseat/restraint system; and second as a possible candidate for integration into a large structural\ndyr,c_,ncs simulation computer program, in order to model the complete system (aireraft, seat and\noccupant) in a single simulation.\nONE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL--DRI\nA one degree of freedom dynamic-reepanse model of a human occupant has been proposed (ref. 6).\nThe model consist8 of a simple linear spring and damper and a point mess. The spring is sized by\nthe compressive stiffness of the lumbm\' vertebrae and the damper is sized by human vibration\ntests.\nThe DRI is an injury scale aeseeiated with this model.

Checklist items were obtained pragmatically from\nexperience in using PROMETHELIS to develop design data. The amount of use of PROMETHEUS\nIII\n111justified incorporation of moat checklist items into this program; consequently the lists serve\nmainly to indicate desirable improvements in SOM.LA. The main improvement in MSOM-LAis an\nimproved seat. capable of modeling energy absorption. The oceupeut model has also been improved\nby the incorporation of a flexible segment representing the Imnbar spine,\n\nti\nt_\n\nThe major "deficiency" in PROMETIIEU8 HI is that it has only been possible to perform limited.\nexploratory calibration against live human test data and for similar reasons linfited exl)h)ration of\nseat model dynamics. Added calibration of this type is desirable. A benefit of 2-D modeling is that\nmechanisms within the 2-D PROMETHEUS IH model are easier for the analyst to comprehend\nthan those within a 3.1) model, giving au advantage for initial use of a 2-1) model in calibration\nefforts. Other than development, which may he required to achieve such ealibratiau, further model\nevolution must consider limitations intriusic to the 2-D nature of the model and distinguish the\neunditions for using a 2-D or a 3.D model. Of course, current unccrtsiutiea in the level of In,man\ntolerance to transient loads an, a constraint that must he observed for either 2-D or 3D models.\n\n\'\n)\n\n\'p\n\nI02\n\nI\ni!\ni!\n\'\n\nFoatmo\nI\n\n..\n\nII\n\n"=\n\nIII\n\nF_ronlolhotls III\n\nI.D\n\n1,1)\n\nD\n\nD\n\n(,0\n\n!\n\nI\n\nI,D\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI,D\nI,D\nI.D\n\nRostramt system\nMt_chanical propurhos of\nlap bolt\nMochanical propo=tlos\not har_qos5\n\n1.0\n\n1.13\n\nOccupant\n5ugntont massos, Iongth.\nnloftl_ls, c.,q.\'s.\nMt_chan*cal propurllos\nof IOItttt_\n\nSOM.L A\n\nM_()M-LA\n(N()h_ t)\n\nI\nD\nI\n\nI\nI\nt\n\n$_,d\nGoomot_y\nConstruction\nMechanical Properties\n\nIV\n\nCrash Pulse\n\nI,O\n\nI\n\nI\n\nVl\n\nInloractive (convorsalional)\ninput Ioature\n\nX\n\n-\n\n-\n\n%,\n\n=\n\nI\n\nInput, D\n\nNote 1:\n\n:\n\ni\n\ni\n\nDotault (i.o., supplied by program)\n\nIt is assumL, d that Iho MSOM-LA\n\nFigure\n\ninptlt is essentially the same as the SOM-LA input.\n\n5.3-Corrrparison\n\nof Program\n\nInput\n\nFeatures\n\n|t)_I\n\nFeature\n\nPrometheus III\n\nSOM-LA\n\nMSOM-t.A\n(Nolo t)\n\nX\n\nX\n\n-\n\n-\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nSeal\nCushionforces\nReactions\nNodal forces\nElement forces\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nIV\n\nCrash pulse\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nV\n\nPrinter plots\nAcceleration traces\n(vs time)\nSnapshots of v=ctimiseat\nLocus el segment c.g.\'s as\nFunct;onsof time\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nX\n-\n\nX\n\nX\n\n_=:\nI\n\nOccupant\nSegment carlesion position,\nvoloc=ty,acceloralion\nSogf_ontangular position,\nvelocity, acceleration\nForceson segments\nJoinl torques\n\n!"\n\n.\n\nSpinal loads\nRestraint system\nLap bolt load\nHarness load\nBolt Slip\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nNote: It is assumed that the output features of SOM-LA and MSOM-LA are essentially the same.\n\nFigure b. 4-Comparison\n\nI It.|\n\n-i\n\nof Program Output Features\n\nFeature\nI\n\nII\n\nPrometheus ill\n\nOccupant\nSpinal articulation\nFlexible lumbar link\nFlexible cervical link\nAutomatic initial position\nGeneration\nCompressible chest, pelvis,\n\nSOM-LA\n\n5 links\nX\nX\nX\n\n4 links\n\nMSOM-LA\n\nX\nX\n\n5 links\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nIV\n\nV\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nSeat\nFinite element model\nBar elements\nBeam elements\nPlate elements\nNo. of elements in typical\n\nX\nX\nX\n6"\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n60\n\nX\nX\nX\n60\n\nCushion\nseat model\nEergy absorption\nAircratt interior modeled\n\nIII\n\nRestraint system\nRealistic friction\nFree to slide on victim\nWebbing stretch\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\'"\n\nX\nX\xc2\xb0"\n\nCrash pulse\nTranslationcomponents\nRotational components\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n"\xc2\xb0"\n\n......\n\nCalibration against\nexperiment\nAnthropomorphicdummy\nLive human\n\n1\n\n-\n\nCapability available\n\nt\n\nt\n\nGrowth available\n**\n\nAccordingto the SOM\xc2\xb0LA developer, Dr. David Laananen, this feature does not work in SOM-LA bt_tdoes in\nMSOM-LA.\n\n*\'\xc2\xb0\n\nPreliminary calibrationaccomplished.\n\nFigure 5.5-Comparison\n\nof Basic Modefing\n\nFeatures\n\n,e,\n\nlit5\n\nS()M.LAcould benefit from both hanmn data calibration and model improvement (frem tile standpoint\nof usefulness for engineering design).

Both reprcsont difficult\nmodeling problems ill a 3-D environment, and methods developed to simulate these features ill the\n2-D PRt)METIIEUS IIl computer program can not be readily generalized to three dimensions.\nSOM-LA has a very primitive restraint systeln model.

In addition, harness friction is\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsegment running from lap belt to shoulder by 12%).

This finite-element "contact problem" is difficult and is the subject of ctlrrent research\n\n_-\n\n(e.g., ref. 9).\nIn addition to these research improvements, several improvement8 would enhance usability of the\n\n_\n\ncode:\n\n_gment forces, joint torques).\n2.\n1.\n\nImprove the algorithm for comlBJio_t.ion joint torque.\nof\nCalculate and display time histories of loads acting on the occupant (e.g., spinal loads,\n\n3.\n\nAdd printer plot "snapshots" of seat and occupant for credibility and for appraising occupant\nlecation at selected times (two views) for comparison with slow motion movies.\n\nINCORPORATION OF SOM-LA INTO LARGE CRASH DYNAMICS CODE\nIt may become necessary to predict dynamic interactions of occupant and floor structure. Simple\npredictions may be possible with SOM-IJ_. Action has been started within the government to\ncombine the 3-D SOM.LA with a large finite-element computer program (e.g., the 3-D DYCAST) in\norder to model an aircraft crash in a single _aulation to more properly couple the dynamics of\noccupants and aircraft structure. To accomplish this, it is suggested that the occupsnklrestraint\nmodel be extracted from the SOM-LA occupedtt/rcatraint/seat model and packaged as a superelement. The occupant SUlk*r-elementwould then be inserted into the large finite-elenwnt programs\nas a module. Although, as noted, improvements in the SOM.LA restraint system model are needed to\nmodel occupant dynamics accurately. The existing SOM.I,A occupant/restraint system model would\npmbahly be adequate for the porix_seaof calculating the gross dynamics of the seat system.\nThe finitt\'-element code would be utilized to model the seat -- that is, the SOM-LAseat model would\nnot be used. (This presumes the development of s general contact mt_|el to simulate forces acting\n\n\'_\n\nI06\n\n,L\n\nbetween the seat and occupant.) The contact model would be used to simulate, scat cushions. This\nconcept has three adva,ltages:\n1.\n2.\n\nSynchronization of the numerical integration schemes (i.e., the procedures for solving the\nequations of motion as function of time) in SOM-LA and the finite-element program is not\nrequired. The integration scheme of the finite-element program is utilized for both occupant(s)\nand structure.\n\n3.\n\n!\n\nSinmlation of multiple occupants becomes possible (e.g., a "triple" seat).\n\nThe capability of the finite-element computer can be employed to model general seat designs.\n\nIt would be possible to use the large finite-element program to model the occupant. The advantage of\nthe super-element is that occupant modeling requires features that are not needed in general finite\nelement modeling of structures, such as limits on angular motion of limbs at joints. Moreover,\noccupant modeling is specialized, and correct mechanical parameters describing the occupant are\nnot widely known (in some cases supportivedata _ not known at all and parameters must be\ninferred by parametric sensitivity testing). Thus it wo,,d be difficult for a nonspecialist to construct an\naccurate model.\nAdditional effort would be required to make the occupant super-element work; provision for\ntransmitting input data to the super-elementand obtsirdng printout of detailed occupanttime histories\nis required. In addition, graphics output from the finite-element program (if graphics post processing\nis available) must be adjusted to draw the oecup_t(s) in addition to the structure.\nThe same procedure could be used to lift the 2-D occupant model from PROMETHEUS HI if a 2-D\ncrash simulation were employed, However. there is little benefit to be obtained from using such a\nmodel in an overturning or cartwheeling light ait_raft where violeut interactions of all three dimensions\nof motion would be occurring.\nHUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE\nIn simulating the crash of a vehicle with human occupants, either by actual test or computation,\nthe capability of estimating the degree of injury sustained by the occupant is highly desirable.\nVarious scales have been proposed for this purpose and these are evaluated below. At present,\nskeletal fracture tolerances provide the best means for predicting injury (including head injury).\nHuman injury is a complicated biological process; causative physical mechanisms are often not\nwell understood, and consequently, traditional engineering methods are difficult to apply.\nPhysiological changes are also known to occtW in response to crash loading (e.g., change in pulse\nrate), further complicating analysis.\nTo fulfill the researcher\'s need to quantify injury, a number of injury scales have been devised.\nThese scales are based on clinical data or physical measurement, such as, head acceleration history.\nThese scales are generally intended to estimate physiological trauma rather than skeletal damage.\nThe better known of these scales will be described.\nA note of caution is appropriate at this point; currently existing injury scales represent some form\nof empirical correlation between injury and measured quantifies. Correlation is not directly based\non the mechanism which actually causes injury; rather, statistical correlation with parameters\nconsidered likely to be implicated is established. Use of an injury scale outside the conditions for\nwhich correlation was established is risky. Moreover, there is always uncertainty in the accuracy of\nthe basic data since injury data cannot be developed from experiments with live people, but must\nbe inferred from cadaver or animal tests.\n\nIts7\n\nDiffvrences between individuals further complicate matters, Despite tbeso limitation, injury scales\nprovide a method for assessing injury in a crash simulation. Such scales provide a rational\n(although pessilily inaccurate) means for comparing eimulatiml results.\nIn contrast to physiological damage to organs, prediction of skeletal injuries is amenable to\nordinary engineering methods. Mechanical properties of bone have been determined\nexperimentally. Standard engineering analysis techniques might be employed to determine the\nextent of bone damage in a particular situation. Although there are differences in bone strength\nand size between individuals, and live human bone cannot be tested, extensive theoretical\nknowledge of structural dynamics permits much greater confidence in the accuracy of such\ncomputations than in the accuracy of injury indices.\n\n,.\n\nBone damage is only part of injuries, and not necessarily the most serious part, Concussion, for\nexample, can occur without accompanying skull fracture. Moreover, the accuracy of engineering\naualysie of the skeleton depend upon accurate computation of forces acting on the skeleton, such\nas restraint system and contact forces. Contact forces are particularly difficult to obtain, since the\ncontacting portion of the human body generally has irregular geometry and the mechanical\nproperties of the bone, flesh and contacted structure all interact to determine the dynamically\nvarying force acting on the skeleton. Occupant-simulation models discussed herein (e.g.,\nPROMETHEUS III, SOM-LA)do not model the skeleton in sufficient detail to accurately predict\nbone fracture. However, structural loads are calculated in these programs (e.g., lumbar axial load),\nand these provide a rough measure of the likelihood of skeletal damage. Chapen (ref. 10) gives an\nexcellent summary of experimentally determined fracture loads.\nInjury scales can be grouped into three classes: (1) scales based on clinical evaluation of actual\ninjuries, (2) "whole-bedy" scales, and (3) scales developed to predict a particular type of injury.\nThe first group of scales is intended to quantify clinical diagnosis of the injuries sustained by a\nparticular person. This provides a yardstick for comparing the severity of injuries occurring in\ndifferent accidents even though the injln\'y mechanisms may be quite different. Such scales are\nnecessarily subjective; their main use is in accident investigation. A well known scale of this type is\nthe Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), as defined in reference 11. Obviously, scales based on clinical\ndiagnosis are of very limited use to the modeler.\nWhole-body tolerance sealos are based on empirical observations, sometimes including the results\nof animal tests, These scales attempt to assess "survivability" based on a gross description of the\nimpact deceleration pulse using parameters such as peak deceleration, duration of deceleration and\nonset rate. A difficulty in using published whole.body scales is that authors often do not\ndistinguish between peak deceleration and average deceleration (which may of course, be quite\ndifferent). These scales refer to the crash load delivered to the seat, and do not directly consider\noccupant/restraint system response. Separate scales are available for different loading conditions\n(e.g., Gx, -Gx, Gz),but no provision is made for combined loading (such as simultaneous -Gx and Gz\ndeceleration). Whole-bedy scales might be useful in early preliminary aircraft design; they are of\nno use in detailed occupant models such as PROMETHEUS HI or SOM-LA.\nInjury sealce in the third group arc intended to estimate damage of a particular type. DRI is an\nexample of this type of scale. The DRI is intended to predict injury to the lumbar spine during\nvertical (G_ accelertian.\nCONCUSSION SCALE8\n,_.\nF,.\n\nSeveral widely publicized scales in the third group with potential for use with occupant models are\n\njI\n\nI O8\n\n,\n\n...... ,\n\n.......\n\n,\n\nII\n\ndesigned to predict eaneuasion. The mechanism causing concussion is not well nnderstend,\nalthough there has been extensive investigation. It is known that eoncuasien can result from either\nlinear acceleration (e.g., from head impact) or else from rotational aecelerutien (i,e., whiplash). To\ndate, most investigations have focused on either linear or rotational arcclcration. Combincd\neffects have also been investigated, hut data is scarce.\nCONCUSSION CAUSED BY TRANSLATIONAL ACCELERATION\n:\',_\n\nA widely used n_easure of human\n\n|\n\n(fig. 5.6 and ref. 12). The WSC predicts that acceleration pulse magnitude is more important than\npulse duration in causing eoncuasion.\n\ntoleranc_ to linesr acceleration isthe Wayne\n\nState Curve\n\n(WSC)\n\nThe following description of derivation of the WSC is paraphrased from Hedgson, et al. (ref. 13). The\nbasic experimental work on which the WSC depends was a study of concussion on mongrel dogs\n(rofs. 14 and 15). Deceleration pulses of systematically varied magnitude and duration were applied\nto the brains of 72 dogs, and a concussion tolerance era\'re for the species was then obtained. It was\nemployed to determine the shape of the human curve for pulses leas than 10 ms in duration (clinical\nexperience that the same curve shape normally accompanies skull fracture). skull fracture date was\npostulated indicates that concuasion would be valid for humans. Cadaver The long pulse end of\nthe WSC (duration greater than 100 ms) was estimated from acceleration sled rides of Stapp and\nother volunteers (ref. 16). The intermediate range of the curve was estimated from cadaver drop\ntests onto automobile dash panels.\nIt should be noted that data on which the WSC is based utilize a_ingle acceleration pulse; multiple\nblows are not used and influence of puh_ shape is not considered. Moreover, the shape of curve is\nnot well supported by experimental evidence for pulse durations greater than 10 ms.\nNewman (ref. 12) reports, regarding the Wayne State Curve, "The validity and usefulneas of this\ntolerance curve have been questioned on a number of grounds including:\n1.\n\n"The ordiuate\'s effective acceleration was poorly defined. Patrick, et al. (ref. 17)*0 had\nstated: "rhe ordinate is Effective Acceleration which is based on a modified triangular pulse\nin which the effective acceleration is somewhat greater than half the peak value. Therefore,\ntriangJJlar or einusoidal pulses of equal area and higher peak magnitude are in accord with\nthe experimental evidence from which the Tolerance Curve is derived.\' Later (ref. 18) it was\nstated: \'Effective acceleration is computed by dividing the area under the acceleration time\nrecord by the time. A judicious analysis of the geometrical shape of the curve is important.\nFor instance, high amplitude spikes of short duration (less than 1 millisecond) should be\ndisregarded.\' More recently, (ref. 19) effective acceleration has been equated exactly to the\ntime averaged acceleration over the duration of the pulse."\n\n2.\n\n"rhe head impact data is not applicable to blows other than tho_e to which the experimental\nanimals and cadavem were subject. To quote Gurdjian, et al, (ref, 20); \'It should be pointed\nout, however, that care should be taken in using a tolerance curve of this nature, It is entirely\npossible that a curve of the same shape, but having different values for the acceleration\nmagnitude, could very well be shifted up or down depending upon the point of impact and the\nblow direction.\' Stalnaker, et al., (refs. 21 and 22) have confirmed that there are significant\ndifferences in the response of human and monkey heads to lateral and longitudinal impacts."\n\n3.\n\n"Bt_\'ause\ntheWSC was based measured\non\nacceleration\ntimehistories point thehead\nofa\non\nessentially\nopposite\ntheforehead\nblowlocation; vibration havehad a significant\nskull\nmay\neffect on the apparent head acceleration.

As suggested by Mertz (ref. 24), asemuing rigid-bedy nn_ehunics, the\naceeleration of the center of gravity of the head can then be determined.\n4.\n\n.\n\n"The WSC has never been col\'iliad for living human beings, although recent indirect efforts\nthrough accident simulation (ref. 25) have been attempted."\n\nSeveral injury indices have been suggested based on the Wayne State Curve. These are the tlead\nSeverity index (ref. 26), the Head Injury Criterion (refs. 12 and 27) and the J tolerance (ref. 28). All\nthree tolerances agree roughly with the Wayne State Curve for short duration frontal head\nimpacts (i.e., 10 me duration, half sine wave shape). The criteria give different results for multiple\npulsee or irregular pulses, and the relative merits are hotly debated. However, little clinical\nevidence is available to indicate whether any of the scales (or indeed the Wayne State Curve) is\nvalid for these conditions.\nThe widely used Swearingen diagram of acceleration tolerance of the facial bones (figure 5.7 and\nref. 29) actually represents fracture data under dynamic loading. The acceleration tolerances given\nshould be multiplied by the head weight to obtain fracture tolerance. Thus the fracture tolerance\nof 30 G given for the nose means that the nose will fracture when the nose is struck with sufficient\nforce to impact 30 G acceleration to the whole head, which wo\'.fldbe a force of 300 Iba., aseuming a\ntan pound head weight. It does not mean that whenever the head is accelerated to 30-G-(e.g.,\nthrough whiplash) that nose fracture occurs.\nCONCUSSION CAUSED BY ROTATIONAL ACCELERATION\nConcussion can be induced by head acceleration pressure in contrast to impact loads, a tentative\nestimation of human tolerance to rotational acceleration was made by Omaya, et el. (ref. 30). A\ntolerance curve was experimentally determined for rhesus monkeys, and the human tolerance\ncurve was inferred from monkey curves by scaling the acceleration axis by r- /3, where r is the ratio\n2\nof the weight of the rhesus monkey brain weight to the human brain weight (fig. 5.8). Omaya, et al.\nstated that additional experimental confirmation is required before use of the curve is justified. As\nfar as can be determined, no confirmation data has been published to date. Thus figure 5.8 must\nremain tentative.\nSTRUCTURAL MODELING COMPUTER PROGRAMS\nINTRODUCTION AND RECOMMENDATION\nImpact dynamics of a real crash involving complicated structural design are too complex for\nmanual analysis, however, modeling methods offer an eventual capability that could provide a\nsimulation of all dynamic interactions.\nSimulation may be by analytical models, scale models, computer models, and full-scala teats in\norder to provide both observation of celr,plex interactions and a rational basis for the sequencing\nof events, loads, and modes of failure.\nNumerous computer simulation models, in particular, are being developed for use in eimulation\nevaiuatione. Some are being developed for euppert of preliminary design studies, others for more\nsophisticated uses. The four main classes of models that are used include:\n\n-Z\n\n;\n\nI11\n\nH\n\n,\n_\n\n_\n\ni\n\n_ t,_l_,_.,.._.\n\n_\n\ni\n\n\',\n\ntO0,O00 _ 1,000,000\nm\n\nc\n\nE\n=\n\no\nE\n\n_ IO,OO0\n\n#\n\n_,_ 100.000\nC\n\n_\n\n_\n\nC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\n_m 1000 : \'_\n\nee\n\n10,000\n\nI\n\n0\n\nNote:\n\nI,\n\n1 2\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\ni\n\n|\n\ni\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10 11 1243_14\n\nl\n\n]\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n15\n\nThe human tolerance scale was obtained by multiplying the rhesus\nmonkey scale by (Mhuman/Mmonkey).\n\n2/3 This scale must be\n\nregarded as an untested hypothesis at this time.\n\nFigure 5.8-Cerebral Tolerance to Rotational Acceleration for Rhesus Monkeys\n\n113\n\n1.\n\nGenersli_d\n\nspring mass model0\n\n2.\n\nFrmnc3.yp,: models\n\n3.\n\nIlybrid models\n\n4.\n\nFinite.element models\n\nSpring-mass models and frame models use a very simple model of the structure to estimate crash\nbehavior. Frame models differ from spring-mass models in that beam elements are employed in\nmodeling, in addition to springs and point maeses. Hybrid models use static test data in\nconjancti_n with a spring-roses model or frame model to predict dynamic behavior of a structure.\nFinite.element approach uses more formal approximation approaches for more discrete definitionof structural representation and properties. Finite-element models tend toward increasing\ncomplexity and computational cost. However, none of the modeling procedures is totally free of\ntesting requirements and analytical judgment. The reason is the extremely complex procees for\nvehicle etructuredeformation under crash loading, which involves:\n1.\n\nTransient, dynamic behavior\n\n2.\n\nComplicated framework and shell assemblies\n\n3.\n\nLarge deflections and rotations\n\n4.\n\nExtensive plastic deformations\n\n--\n\nA number of computer programs have been developed to simulate nonlinear dynamic response of\nstructures. These programs are categorized as \'_ybrid"\'and "purely mathematical finite-element\nmodels." Brief descriptions of some of these programs are given, and three of the programs\n(KRASH, DYCAST and ADINA) are evaluated in more depth. It is concluded that none of the\nprograms has all needed features.\nHYBRID VS.

Hayduk, et aL (ref. 32) conclude,\nafter comparing the hybrid program KRASH with the purely mathematical finite.element\nprograme ACTION and DYCAST:\n"A hybrid computer program (KRASH) and two finite-element computer programs (ACTION\n\n_.\n\nsubjected to a 8.38 m/s (27.5 fUs)analyse aimpact. A vertical drop test experiment was\nand DYCAST) have been used to vertical section of a twin-engine, low-wing airplane\nperformed at the NASA Langley Impact Dynamics Research Facility. The results of the\nanalyses demonstrated the capability of all three computer progrmna to quantitatively\nsimulate the significant dynamic response of aircraft structures under impact loading."\n"Because of the variation in complexity of the KRASH lumped-mass model (177 DOF\n(degrees of freedom)) and the ACTION (336 DOF) and DYCAST (493 DOF) finite-element\nmodels and solution methods, there were two orders of magnitude difference in analysis cost.\nConsequently, the lumped-mass hybrid approach should be used in conjunction with the\nfinite-element approach, the two approaches complementing each other. The lumped-muse\nhybrid approach can be used to evaluate gross vehicle response, design trends, structural\ndesign and impact parameters studies, and gross energy diseipation. The finite-element\napproach should be used for analysis of designs where the detailed behavior of individual\ncomponents are critical, for obtaining detailed loads required for input to other analyses,\nsuch as a lumped mass-hybrid technique or an occupant simlulator, and for detailed stress\nanalysies in sizing of structural eompon_nte."\nCronkhite, et al. (ref. 33) agree with the Hayduk conclusions. Cronkhite states:"Computer analysis methods are still being verified for metal structures, while compo_tes\nwill need special treatmant because of their It,,vstrain-to-failure characteristics. At present,\nbeth the hybrid (KRASH) and fmita-olemant (DYCAST}structure crash analysis methods are\nneeded. The hybrid type of analysis is ueeful for preliminary design analysis and for\nparametric studies of the entire airframe. The f\'mite-elemant analysis method has the\npotential for detailed structure analysis directly from drawings and may be need to develop\ninputs to the hybrid type of analysis. The main problem with a hybrid method is obtaining\nstructure inpute to the coarse math model.

The\nfour codes currently awfilable are WHAM by Belytachko of Northwestern University\n(ref. 46), WRECKER by Welch, et at., of illinois Institute of Technology (ref. 47), ACTION by\nMelosh, et el., of Virginia Polytechnic Institute of Technology and State University (ref. 48),\nsad I)YCAST by Pifko, et at, of Grumman Aerospace Corporation (ref. 49 and .50). WItAM\ncurrently can be used to idealize a structure which contains only isatropic material. It uses\npartly interactive yielding, i.e., the effect of shear stresses on plasticity is neglcct_,d.\nWRECKER contains the same formulations as WItAM but also has the added convenitmce\nfeatures of graphics and restart. ACTION also has partly interactive yielding, and it can be\nused only with a structure renal.curled with isotropic materials. Additionally, AC_I\'IONalso\ncontains an intermdly varied time step with numerical error controls. DYCAST can idcaliu, a\nstructure constructed of orthotropic material. Its features include folly interactive yielding,\ninternally varied time steps with error control, restart, and graphic output."\nA mnmnary of the assessment of these specific crash simulations is given in table 5.2 (from\nCrenkhite et el., rof. 33). Note that the hybrid codes do not account for collapse or failure under\ncombined loads because the crash data iapute are derived from h_sts with a single load. All of the\nfinite-element codes excep_ Shieh\'s ran account for multiple-load components. The crush teat can\nfurnish the hybrid computer codes with data to analyze orthotropic laminates and c.>re-sondwich\nprate!s, while only DYCAST of the finite-element codes can analyze an orthotrepie material.\nNone of the evaluated finite-clement codes can currently analyze a rare sandwich. WRECKER is\nthe only one of these codes which will account for strain rate effects in a logical way. by\ndetennining the local strain rate and adjusting the atiffuesses.

There is an active user group which holds regular conferences regarding\nADINA engineering applications. ADINA has dynamic-analysis capability roughly equivalent to\n\n12:t\n\nI}YCAST, but in addition has static.analysis capability {linear or nonlinear) and can perform eigen\nvaluc/eigan vector calculations. A noteworthy featur_ of ADINA is the extensive checking of the\ninput data for errors and the relatively complete set of error messages flagging errors which\ndevelop during execution, for example, singularity of the stiffness matrix. The major deficiencies\nare the input scheme, which is "fixed field" and relatively difficult to locate individual data items\nin, and the lack of a variable time stop numerical integration scheme.\nExistence of an active ADINA user group is a significant asset, and a user without continuous need\nfor nonlinear dynamic analysis should give ADINA serious consideration based on this alone.\nExistence of the user group assures that assistance will be available to extend or recheck an\nanalysis laterate.\nata\nd\nSUMMARY\nThereisagreement\nbetween\nresearchers\nincrash\ndynamics\nthat\nbeththehybrid\napproach\nandthe\npurely\nmathematical\nfinite-element\nmethodareneeded\natthecurrent oftechnology,\nlevel\nCronkhite,\netel.\nnotetheinconvenience\nofcoping\nwithmultiple\ninput\nschemes.\nSince\nthehybrid\nandpurely\nmathematical\nfinite-element\nanalysis\nmethodsarecompatible\nand,in\nfact,\nverysimilar,\nconsideration\nshould\nbegiven\ntodevelopingsingle\na\npackage\nco:nbining\nthebest\nfeatures\nofbothapproaches.\nTherearetwoadvantages.\nFirst,\ntheuser,ho will\nw\nlikely\nneedboth\nmethodstosolve\nhisproblem,\nwill\nneedtobecomefamiliar\nwithjust\none program.\nS_condly,\ncombined\nanalysis\nbecomes\npossible;\nadetailed\nfinite-element\nmodelcanbeusedfor\nonepart\nofthe\nstructure a seat)\n(e.g.\nwhile\nanother\nportionfthestructure\no\ncould\nbemodeledmore simply\nwith\nhybrid\nelementshosestatic\nw\nmechanical\nproperties\nareobtained static\nby\ntest.\nInprinciple,\nthe\nstatic could\ntest\nbesimulated thepurelyathematical\nby\nm\ncode;\ninpractice,\nmorevalidation\nofthe\npurely\nmathematical\ncodes\nisneededbefore\nthis\nispractical.\nA deficiency these\ninall\nmodels\nisthelack\nofageneralurpose\np\ncontact\nelement\ntomodelcollision\nbetween\ntwoormoreparts\nofthestructure.\nInexisting\nprograms,\ncontact\ncanbemodeledonlyby\nconnecting\nelements, springs,\ne.g.\nbetweencontacting\nsurfaces.\nThisentails\nanticipation\nofevery\ncollision which might occur and each individual specification of the contact element together with its\nmechanical characteristics. Reference 56 describes an experimental general purpose contact\nmodel, which might be developed into a practical contact element.\nTEST TECHNOLOGY\nA review of crash tests has been conducted to ascertain the status of test technology. Tests include\nfall-seals aircraft and some components. Test objectives, instrumentation, and test methods are\ndiscu_ed. In addition, some static tests applicable to structural crashworthiness are reviewed.\nPrograms to test full-seale aircraft have been conducted by NASA, the FAA, and the U.S. Army\nover the last 30 years. These programs have treated small propeller.driven transports, general\naviation light aircraft, and helicopters. During this time, testing technology has advanced,\nparticularly in the areas of instrumentation, data acquisition, and processing.\nSeats, fuel cells, and lending gear have been tested statically and dynamically in development and\ncertification testing to design crash leads. In addition, as a part of research programs some\nsubstructures have also been tested.\nThe purpose of crash testing has been to auese crashworthincss, level of crash loads, crash\nresponse of the aircraft, and crashworthiness performance of design modifications. More recently,\n\n124\n\nas analytical methods have evolved, some teata have also had the collection of data for verification\nof analyses as an objective.\nIn the material presented below, selected teats are presented as representative of a technique. The\ntest methods in some cases have been quoted from the reports and in other cases have bsen\nsummarized.\nFULL-SCALE PROPELLER.DRIVEN TRANSPORTS{Tent\n\nTrack Method)\n\nEarly crash tests by NACA of full-seale World War II vintage propeller.driven aircraft (refs. 57\nand 58) had determination of crash loads and effects of crash parameters on these loads as an\nobjective. These tests were part of n crash-fire study and utilized the test facility developed for\nthat program.\nAircraft were propelled along a track, gear sheared off, and then impacted a shaped earthen\nbarrier to simulate impacting the earth. Angles of impact up to 30 \xc2\xb0 at speeds of about 100 mph\nwere obtained. Floor accelerations at various stations along the fuselage were measured. In\ngeneral, the aircraft impacted the shaped barrier in the vicinity of the cockpit. This type of test is\nrepresentative of a flight into obstruction where the obstruction is an earthen mound. Some tests\nwere performed to simulate the effect of hitting trees with one wing to produce a ground loop.\nAcceleration data were obtained with instrumentation and processing equipment representative of\nthe late 1950s. Due to differences in aircraft structure, crash energy levels, absence of analytical\ntools, and to the small amount of data on the crash performance, the test data have limited\napplication to commercial jet transport. However, the data are of historical value and do provide\nsome insight into crash loads. Further they served as models for later testing.\nIn 1964, the FAA conducted two crash tests of complete aircraft. A Lockheed L-1649 (ref. 59)\ntransport aircraft and a Douglas DC-7 (ref. 60) were tested using methods similar to the NACA\ntests. In these tests, instrumented seat installations and dummies with seat restraints were\nincluded. In addition, high-speed camera coverage of the aircraft interiors was provided. Floor and\ndummy accelerations were measured.\nInstrumentation problems due to teat equipment acceleration environment on the DC-7 resulted.in\nthe luse of much of the acceleration date for that test. In addition, the DC-7 almost overran the test\nrange, illustrating problems of controlling the test vehicle during crash impacts.\nWhile these tests provided some good crash loads data, particularly for the seat/occupant, the\nvalue of the test data would have been enhanced by the availability and application of analytical\nmethods to the data. Lack of such methods has limited the application of the crash loads to the test\nconditions for the type of aircraft.\nFULL-SCALE CRASH TESTING OF GENERAL AVIATION AIRCRAFT (Swing Test\nMethod)\n\n\' _\nii\n\nFuU-seale crash testing is performed at the Langley Impact Dynamics Research Facility (refe. 61\nand _2). This facility is the former Lunar Landing Research Facility modified for free.flight crash\ntest .g of foil.scale aircraft structures and structural components under controlled test conditions.\nThe basic gantry structure is 73 m (240 ft) high and 122 m (400 ft) long supported by three sets of\ninclined legs spread 81 m (267 ft) apart at the ground and 20 m (67 it) apart at the 66 m (218 ft)\nlevel. A movable bridge with a pullback winch for raising the test specimen spans the top and\ntransverses the length of the gantry.\n\n12,5\n\n_i\n\nThe aircraft is suspended from tile top of the gantry by two swing cables and is drawn back above\nthe impact surface by a pullback cable, An umbilical cable used for data acquisition is also\nsuspended from the top of the gantry and connccta to the top of the aircraft, The teat sequence is\nTest Method\n\ni_\n\ninitiated when the aircraft is released from theswing cables are permitting the aircraft to swing\npendulum style into the impact surface, The pullback cable, separated from the aircraft by\n\n_.._.\n\npyrotechnics just prior to impact, freeing the aircraft from restraint, The m]lbilical cable remains\nattached to the aircraft for data acquisition, but it also separates by pyrotechnics before it becomes\ntaut during skid-out, The separation point is held relatively fixed near the impact surface, and the\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nof the aircraft above the impact surface at release determines the impact velocity which can be\nflight path anglem/sadjusted from 0\xc2\xb0 to 60" bridge allows the length of point to becable, The height\nvaried 0 to 26,8 is (60 mpb) The movable by changing the pullback the swing positioned along\n\n-_.\n\nthe swing cables,\nTo obtain flight.path velocities in excess of 26,8 m/s (60 mph) a velocity augmentation method has\nbeen devised which uses wing.mounted rockets to accelerate the teat specimen on its downward\nthe gantry to insure that the pullback cables pass through the center of gravity and atotalhrust\nact\nswing.\nTwo Falcon\nrockets\naremountedateachengine\nnacelle\nlecation-und\nprovide at 90 a to\nt\nof77,850\nNewtons,\n\n=\ni\n\nInstrumentation\nDataacquisition\nfromfull.scale testasaccomplished\ncrash\ni\nwithextensive photographic\ncoverage,\nbethinterior\nandexterior\ntotheaircraft, low-,edium-,\nusing\nm\nandhigh.speed\ncamerasandwith\non-beard\nstrain\ngages\nandaccelerometers. gagetypeaccelerometers of250and750g\nStrain\n(range\nand0 to2000Hz)aretheprimary\ndatagenerating\ninstruments,\nandarepositioned\ninthefuselage\nto measureaccelerations\nbothinthe normaland longitudinal\ndirections\ntotheaircraft\naxis.\nInstrumented anthropomorphic dummies (National Highway Traffic _fety\nAdministration\nHybrid ID are on beard all full-scale aircraft testa conducted at Langley. Restraint system\narrangement and type of restraint used vary from test to test.\nData signals are transmitted from the aircraft sp-_iman through an umbilicalcable to ajunction box on\ntop of the gantry. From the junction box, the data is transmitted through hard wire to the control room\nwhere the data signals are recorded on FM multiplex recorders. In order to correlate data signals on\nthe multiplex recorders with external high speed motion picture data, an [RIG A time code was\nrecorded eimnitaneouely on the magnetic tapes and on films. There is also a 60 Hz time-code\ngenerator with the onboard events recorded with the cameras. A Doppler radar unit is placed\napproximately 60 m behind the impact point to obtain the horizontal velocity of the aircraft.\nAt the time the date is being recorded, the data passes through a 600 Hz low-pass filter.

A compreseed.air catapult was used to accelerate the test aircraft along a 90-foot\ntrack. At the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft, which was pulled by its noes gear, was\nreleased toimpact an earthen hill of 4" slope. At the base of the hill, a 12-in. by 12-in. I-beam was\ninstalled to break off the aircraft\'s landing gear. The nose gear was strengthened to withstand the\ncatapult pulling force, while the main landing gear mounting bolts were sewed in half to effect an\neasier separation from the wings. Spoilers were installed along the upper wing surface to keep the\nairplane from flying. At a distance of 10 ft from the I-beam, poles were sunk into the hill to a depth\nof 18 inches. These poles were spaced symmetrically off the centerline of the hill, at 42 inches and\n108 inches each. The poles were hollow mild steel tubing, 4.375-in. outside diameter, 0.188-in. wall\nthickness and were 10 ft in length. Small rock piles were located on the hill to further increase the\nseverity of the crash condition. There are no standards in general use for a crash site as is used in\nthis type of test; hence, the selection of the type of poles, rocks, and hill were selected to produce a\ndestructive environment to the fuel tank location. The crash site was intended to be at least as\nsevere as a crash at an airfield involving airport structures such as approach lights.\nIn all tests, the aircraft main tanks were filled with water. Accolerometera, CEC type 4-203.001,\nwere installed on the floor of the aircraft at the longitudinal center of gravity location (station\n126). Accelerations in the vertical and longitudinal direction were recorded on an oscillograph. The\ndata were filtered at 90 Hz.\nDYNAMJC SEAT TESTS (Sled Teat Method)\nThe testing of seats to simulate dynamic crash loads has been conducted by the U.S. Army, CAMI,\nNAIX],NASA, and the seat manu._acturers.The Army, following the recommendations of its Aircraft\nCrash Survival Design Guide, has had helicopter and light aircraft seats dynamically tested as a\nrequirement for specification compliance. These teat_ have been conducted at the CAM[ facility or\nby Simula, Inc. These test programs have served as development tools in uncovering unanticipated\nweaknesses in design details and generally have resulted in an improved crashworthy seat for the\nArmy application. The Army test requirements include provisions for applying the teat impulse with\nthe floor in a pre-warped position. While these conditions may represent limiting cases for the Army\nusage, the heavier commercial jet aircraft construction may preclude warping to the degree required\nby the Army.\nThe CAMI facility (ref. 64) uses a sled test vehicle on a horizontal track to carry the seat and\noccupant {anthropomorphic dummy). The sled is gradually accelerated to a velocity and is abruptly\ndecelerated by energy ab6orbing wires to apply the teat impulse. Variation in orientation in\nmounting of seats permits loading in the desired axis. This procedure has been refined and\ngenerally gives good test results.\nTest Procedure\nTwo impact orientations were used in these tests. The first, corresponding to Test I of\n\n127\n\nMIL-S-58095 (AV) (ref. 6fi), produced combined downward, forward and lateral loads on the seat.\nThe second provide_ forward and lateral lead_ on the seat and correspond8 to Test 2 of\nMILoS.Sg095 (AV). Both testa used a floor warpage fixture which rolled the left seat track 10"\noutboard and pitched the right seat track 10\xc2\xb0 down, corresponding to the floor buckling and\nwarping conditions required for static testa under MIL-S-58095 (AV). An Alderson CO-95\nanthropomorphic dummy, S/N 500, weighing 224 lbe furnished for these testa by the Naval Air\nDevelopment Center (NADC), simulated the esst occupant. The dummy was clothed in acrylic knit\npunts and shirt for these testa. Shoes were not used. Trlaxial clusters of ac_larometere were\nlocated in the dummy\'s cheat, on the seat pan, and on the floor fixture. Strap load tensiometem\nwore placed on the shoulder belt and lap belt webbing. Becanso of the design of the restraint\nsystem, there was no free webbing on which to locate the tenaiometers, so that each tensiometer\nwas in contact with the dummy as well as the webbing. Since this may introduce error in the data,\nthe webbing load da_ presented in this report should be used with caution. An accelerometer was\nalso mounted on the sled to provide reference data for adjusting the impact pulse. Unless\notherwise noted, sled and floor data were filtered in accordance with Channel Class 60 (0-100 Hz)\nseat and dummy accelerometers in accordance with Channel Class 180 (0-300 Hz) and tensiometere\nin accordance with Channel Class 600 (0.1000 Hz) of SAE J 211b.\nAll teats were filmed on instrumentation cameras operating at 500 or 1000 frames per second.\nTEST/SIMULATION PROGRAM OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS (Drop Tower\nMethod)\nThis program (ref. 66) called for crash testing and analytical simulation of helicopter structural\ncomponents and correlation of the results.\nThe primary objective of this activity was to provide a validation of the analytical techniques for\nhelicopter erashworthiness design developed to date and as improved in this program. There was\nalso an interest in gathering basic crash response data that could be used directly in design or as\ninput to analytical procedures.\nA nose section of a CH-47 helicopter from station 160 forward was used as the basic structure. A\nforward transmission and rotor head assembly were installed. Two crow seats were installed in the\ncockpit; a standard CH-47 seat at the pilot location and a creshworthy crew seat at the co.pllot\nstation. Each seat contained a dummy which approximated the 50th percentile aviator. Total\nweight of the specimen completewith seats and dummies was 3800 pounds.\nInstrumentation\nTypes of measuring devices used in this test were aceslerometers, strain gages, and deflection\nindicators.\nIn addition to \xc2\xb1 I00 g accelarometerJ some _t500 g shock accelerometers were used in areas where\nhigh acceleration levels were predicted. These were used to overcome previous problems where\nhigh g levels caused circuit saturation resulting in excessive zero shifts with long-term decay\ncharacteristics.\nFive \xc2\xb1 100 g accelerometers (CEC 4.281-001) and five \xc2\xb150 g arcelerometere (PCB Piezotronies\nInc., Model 302A) Weremounted at selected locations. Three deflection indicators ware mounted at\nselected locations. Indicator tubes were attached to the floor and pa_sed through the roof of the\n! i_ "\n_\n=_\n\nspecimen. Eight strain gages were installed on selected structural elements. All gages were\nunaxial. An additional strain gage was installed on the crashworthy crew seat vertical eolunmn.\nAll data were recorded on magnetic tape using an FM wide-band [RIG recording system.\n\no\n\nlluisting equipment wee odjuet_l priur to the test to provide a nominal pitch attitude at release of\n0\xc2\xb0 and a drop height of 17.3 ft to give an impect vohwity of 33.:t fife. Roll and piteh attitudes were\naleA_set to 0 \xc2\xb0. Four ropes were atteched to the specmnm to limit to 45 \xc2\xb0 uny postcrasb rntationl\nabout the pitch and roll axes.\n,\n,_.\n\nBlack oral white movies (1500 pps) were recorded at three locations und provided three views: a\nrear view of the st_wimen, an oblique view fnxn the right reur and unother oblique view frosn file\nloft front.\nA 400 pps color movie camera was sot to view the crushworthy crew seat through the left side\n\nt\n\nthe same locations as the two 1500-ppe cameras positioned obliquely to the specimen.\ncopilot door opening of the cockpit. Additionally, two 24-pps movies were taken at approximately\n\ni\n\nOf the 10 acceleronmtera used, all provided good data for. the inital impact phase of the test.\nSubsequent to initial impact, at time 0,06 second, one accclerometer signal was lost due to\ncollapsing structure of the station 95 bulkhead pinching a wire between the structure and the edge\nof the mounting plate for the craahworthy crew seat. This resulted in signal los8 from the\naccelerometer mounted on the crashworthy seat-mounting plate. However, the data obtained up to\nthe time of signal loss is acceptable und covers the major range of interest for a test of this type.\nThree deflection indicators were mounted in the test specimen. These were to provide time.history\nrecords of the displacement-of the spot|men\'s crown relative to the floor, and also to give a post.\nteat indication of the plastic deformatiun that occurred.\nBy using the pretest dimensions of the specimen in conjunctiun with the-post-test gross deflection\nindications provided by a rubber grommet sliding on each indicator tube, it is pomsibleto determine\nthe maximum elastic and plastic deformations that occurred during the crash sequence.\nUnfortuunteIy, unly one of the deflection indicatJoraprovided acceptable deflection time-history\ndata; the other two suffered from poor wiper contact and possible wire bhtding and stretching.\nA total of nine uniaxial gages were intetalled, eight at selected locations on the structure attd one on\nthe vertical attenuator of the creshworthy crew seat. Some of the gages were in areas where severe\nstructural damage occurred resulting in gage failures, zero shifts, and generally unaceep__ble data.\nThe strain gage acceptability limitation is the manufacturer\'s recommended 1,5% strain value for\nroom temperature conditions.\nTe_t Conclusions\nThis teat provided reasonably good itdtial intpact data for all m_,elerometer channels without\nobviously extreme zero shifts or early loss of signal, The modified circuitry und use of 500 g\nsccelerometm_s fnr recording impacts of this magnitude shows a marked improvemeut over the\nreeulta obtained for test numbers 1 mid 2.\nThe selected impact velocity provided sufficient energy to cause failures of mutw of the structural\nelements without causing excessive collapse. It is apparent that a gn,ater impact veloeity would\nhave resulted in exee,mive structural collapse and rendered the test unrepresentative of a\nsurvivable crash.\nThe strain gages suffered front tile effects of adjacent structural failures rendering the data of\nquestionable value in some iostmwes.

It appears that the problem is due to peer wiper artiun in conjunction with stretching\nwire; future testa will incorporate a stronger wire material such as pinna wire. Such an installation\nwill possess a tower electrical resistance value but it is considered that an adequate recording\nsystem exists to accommodate this, Additionally, the generation of a continuous signal without\nwipe chatter will enhance signal recording.\nIt was unfortunate that-the high speed movie films were spoiled in development since a bettor\nnadcrstanding of failure sequences may have been obtained for the primary structural elements.\nHowever, overall structural damage and recorded data provide a good set ofAnformation for\ncorrelation with computer simulation results.\nSTATIC TESTS-.\nStatic tests provide useful data on the crash perfornlanee of structures where the inertia loads due\nto the local structural mass have a small ef,!\'ecton the crash response, Some examples of this are\nfuselage structures in shear action, lower fuselage structure, in crashing action, and seat structure\nunder floor displacement and occupant loads. The inelastic load carrying capability of skin.\nstringer, colunma, and torque box sections for large deflections may also be obtained from static\ntests, These data are useful in hybrid simulations in validating detailed strnetural models, and in\nassessing design performance of some components.\nStatic teats, whi|e avoiding problems of dynamic data acquisition, do have problems of\nmaintaining load magnitude and direction, and valid boundary conditions during large deflections.\nInternal\nloadsusually\ncannotbe obtained strain\nby\ngagesas strahl\ngagesfail the large\nat\ndeflections\nofinterest.\nHoweverrapidly\nreeording cells deflection\nload\nand\ngagesmay yield\nvalid\nforce-deflection fortheloading\ncurves\ncondition.\nThese techniques have been used successfully in the Army-spnaeored study and in the NASA\nGeneral Aviation research on floor structure. Some further development of the methods might be\nexpected..as additional\ntesting is performed.\nIMPACT TEST FACILITIES\nImpacttest\nfacilities\nsuitable\nforreseareh\nanddevelopment\neceahworthiuess\ntesting structural\nof\nsubsystems\nandofcompleteircraft\na\nhavebeenreviewed.\nThereview\nisconfined\ntoreprcm,\nntative\nmajor government facilities,\nCrash testing of commercial jet transports, or even structural components involves engineering\nprehlems of scale which have been overcome in peat testing but now take on a new dimension, For\nthe 707 the fuel load weighs 72398,2 kg, the wing tilPto-tip span is 44,42 m, and the ground tOfin\ntip distance is 12.94 m. Extension of past teat methods to the commercial jet will require\ningenuity.\nTable 5,4 identifies the teat facilities and shows approximate test capabilities.

At learnt 4 channels of this type data should be available. The carreut NASA\n2\npractice of passing the data through a 600 Hz low-psea filter prior to rccurding may be wstrictive for\nstiff substructures. Also high frame-rate (5000.10,000 pps) photographic coverage should be\nawniable. At least three cameras are needed to record the structural response. A system for\naccurately indexing the photograpbic records to the electronic instrumentation is necessary.\n\n_."\n\nBased on the above discu_ions, assessment8 may be made of test capability, test method data,\nASSESSMENT OFfacilitiesCAPABILITIES FORthe research and development progreana. The\nsystems, and test TEST needed to conduct JET TRANSPORTS\npurpose of these test programs is to increase the knowledge of the crash response of the complete\naircraft and components. In order to be effective, such testing must provide engineering restflta in\nmuch greater detail than that currently obtained from accident investigations,\n\n!i _=\n\nTest Methods\nMuch research is required to develop test methods. With regard to testing of complete aircraft, the\nonly carryover from previous testing is the L1649 and DC-7 tests, which apply to the grmmd to\ngroundscenario. To test the air-to.ground and the flight-into-obstruction scenarios, remote piloting\ntechniques to control crash conditions, and reliable unheard data acquisition techniques are\nrequired.\nRegarding component testing, same carryover from previous testing pertains to the testing of\nseat/occupant/restraint systems. While methods of testing for individual seat units have been\ndeveloped, there are many problems yet to be resolved. Of particular concern is the variation in\nresults between what might be expected to be similar tests. Reference 65 shows a factor of\napproximately 2 in lap-belt loads that is attributed to the use of different types of dummies. The\nArmy is concerned about this problem and is conducting a series of testa in which the s_une type of\nseat and identical dummy is teated to the _ame conditions at NARDC, CAMI and Simula, Inc. (ref.\n67). The results of these testa are to be compared in an attempt to res_lve tee differences being\nobserved.\nIn addition, the interface between 0eat track and Buppert structure ueeds definition. Fur light\naircraft and helicopters, deformations of one track relative to the other is usually recommended.\nFor transport aircraft with desp floor beams, it is not clear that such relative deformation is\nobtainable or representative of eremhes. In addition, the input acceleration pulse is yet to be\ndetermined. Such questions as how many seat units or how much fleer structure arc necessary to\nadequately simulate crash conditions are unanswered. Should load pulses Ix, combined, phased,\nand/or applied in sequence? How do restraint syatetos perform under such conditions and what\noccupant should be represented?\nSimilar problems exist in testing each of the other components. In particular, }low are crash loads\nto be reacted at the test.specimen boundaries in order to cause tile structure to simulate the crash\ndynamics of an accident? For instance, how much fuselage must be teated in simulating the air-toground Scenario? The ground-to-ground scenario? Are wing reactions uecesaary? Further, does the\nnature of the crash response change as a fmlctian of crash initial conditions?\n\n132\nm\n\n"i\n\nTo answer the kinds of questions present above, correlation between component testing and\ncomplete aircraft testing is necessary. Also, validated enalytical methods arc needed to extend test\nresulta to regions where testing is impractical and to correct results where crash boundary\nconditions cannot be matched.\n,\n\nData Systems\nData acquisition and processing systems developed for the NASA/FAA general aviation program and\nthe CAMI seat program are sufficient to start test programs. Itowever further development of\nimproved high g/higl_ frequency aceelerometers is needed. In addition reliable displacement\nmeasuring devices are needed for dynamic deflection and spring hack measurements.\nIn the area of photography, methods of obtaining good quality high frame-rate (5000-10,000 ppe)\npictures in the crash environment are needed to record detailed structural behavior. Research into\nlow-light-level television and methods of computerized picture enhancement and data extraction\ncould greatly increase the data obtained and reduce data reduction time.\n\nTrot Facilities\nComplete aircraft testing appears feasible at the Dryden Crash Test Range and st the planned FAA\nTechnical Center catapult. Instrumentation at both facilities is open to question. At Dryden, unheard\ndata systems are supplemented by telemetry used for flight testa. The telemetered data are of a low\nfrequency and of dubious value. Technical Center catapult date system has not bean defined to\ndate.\nThe CAMIseat test range appears adequate for near term testing of individual seat unite. Testing of\nlarger groups of seats and substructure may require testing in other facilities. Other components\nmight be tested in the assorted estapulta, drop tower, and swing tower8 depending on the problems\nof simulating the crash.\nASSESSMENT OF IMPACT RESISTANCE TECHNOLOGY\nCurrent impact resistance design technology is based on the lessons learned from accident\nexperience. Technology is continually being improved to reflect the latest experience. From these\nleseons, experienced engineering design practices have evolved. These practices have developed a\nhigh level of impact resistance in the current commercial jet transport fleet.\nThe design technology has shortcomings in that meet crash response mechanisms are unknown.\nThere is a lack of quantitative methods for engineering analysis. There also is a lack of definitive\ncrash load&This has led to comparisen of designs to existing capability. While this presses has been\nsuccessful where a data base e_ste, there is concern for new configurations and advanced\nmaterials application for which no accident data base exists.\nTest methods for complete aircraft and for structural compenenta need develol_.ment. The meet\nrecent transport aircraft crash test was in 1964 with limited results. Jet transport structural\ncomponent testing to simulate crash conditions needs development. Size end initial conditions of\nsuch testing, introduces a new set of test problems. Adaptation of existing facilities and the\ndevelopment of new facilities needs research. Existing test facilities and methods could serve as a\nstarth_g point for a teat\nprogram.\n\n_\n\nExisting analytical methods are research tools. Many programs have technical shortcomings for\ncrash simulation and are not completely validated, but if validated could contribute significantly\n\n133\n\nto teat planning, prediction of rcauRa based on state-of-the.art knowledge and theory, and\nix_nterash data analysis for complex interactions. Model techniques and structural data bases to\nsupport crash simulations for both _tructural components and complete aircraft needs\ndevelopment. Further, the programs need modification, both to make them user oriented before\nthey can become engineering tools and to reduce the large cost of analyses.\n\n_.\n\nt\n\nP\'_"\n\nFor eeaVoccupant modeling the programs have reached a more advanced stage of development\nthan the structures analysis programs. However, more complete representation of the occ.apant\nand surface contact would permit bettor simulation of occupant response. Problems exist in\n\n_\n\nrelating the analytical output to hmnan injury.\n\n"\n\nAs-an overview, the problemsappears thatdefined and some analytical and experimental methods\nand facilities are available. It have been the ingredients for research and development program\nexist. With the advent of advanced aircraft the impact response problems take on added\nsignificance.\n\n.\n\nRequirementsRESEARCH TO IMPROVE CRASHWORTHINESS TECHNOLOGY\nfor research and development effort that will result in improved technology for\ncrashworthiness engineering of commercial transport aircraft are presented.

This definition should include\ncrash\nloads\nand displacements\nforeachscenario.\nRational\nrelationships\nbetweenthecrash\nloads\nestablished.\n\n1\n\nand displacements and the range of initial conditions with various hostile environments should be\nSecond, an understanding of the crash response mechanisms of structural components and of\ncomplete aircraft in these scenarise is required. The effects of factors influencing these\nmechanisms must be understood.\nThird, validated analytical modeling and test engineering methods must be developed. These\nmethods should be capable of treating structural components, occupant response, and complete\naircraft. Further the methods mtmt be usable in engineering applications,\nFourth, human factors and injury mechanisms for commercial transport occupants must be\ndefined. The relationships between engineering quantities such as acceleration pulses, impact\nloads and displacements, end occupant injury are necemsaryto provide adequate levels of occupant\nprotection.\n\n:\n!_\n\nAchievement of these four goals will permit detailed engineering of crashworthine_ to a level not\nnow available. Improved technology will permit design considerations affecting crashworthinem\nto be treated on a more rational basis and to more fully participate in the design proee_. Further,\nasadvanced\ndesign\nconcepts materials\nand\nereconsidered,\ncrashworthiness\nrequirements be\nmay\nmore fullynticipated\na\nthaninthepast.\n\n-\n\n134\n\nCRASItWORTHINES8 DISCIPLINE\n\n!\n\ni\n\nThe five areas of activity are shown in figure 5.9. The areas are defined to the third level of detail.\nIt is expected that technology will evolve as the program progresses.\n\n_\n\n_\n\n!i\n\n"Mature" crashworthinesa technology might be envisioned as five major areas of activity. Each of\nthese areas leads to the quantification of crsshworthine_ parameters and understanding of crash\nphenomezta in order that protection for occupants might be improved.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDATABASE\nData base activity treats the collection and nmintenancs of data germane to structural\nerashworthinese and occupant protection.\nThe data base has been divided roughly into four categories: crash statistics, scenario refinement,\nperformance norms, and human factor data. For the most part, the activities under each of these\ncategories are self evident and in many instances represent an extension of ongoing efforts and of\nstudies conducted herein.\nWith respect to the establishment of survivable crash initial conditions, more applications of the\nwork of Wingrove et el. (ref. 68) in conjunction with the NTSB could improve the definition of the\ncrash conditions. Accurate definition of the initial conditions could enable accidents to be used in\nsimulations to better def\'me the environment in scenarios. Such results would augment the data\nfrom crash testing full scale asrcraft.\nTo assist the NTSB in developing structural data for erasliworthinese from accidents, an\ninvestigation team of research and engineering-oriented people from government is proposed. This\nteam would inspect selected accidents to obtain data on the crash performance of structural\nsystems. It is recognized that a high level of cooperation between the NTSB and the team must\nexist for such an endeavor. However, the increase in the amount of engineering data from\naccideate could be substantial.\nHuman factors area needs better definition. Considerable attention has been directed tow_lrd\noccupant injury mechanisms. However, with improved structural and occupant modeling,\ninteractions between occupant and the restraint system and with the surroundings may be studied\nfor improved design. Of particular importance is the development of a relationship between\nengineering parameters and occupant injury. Impreved definitions of occupant modeling\nparameters such as spring constants, damping ratios, and kinematics should be developed for\nsimulations and for anthropomorphic dummies.\nMETHODS AND FACILITIES\nThe methods and facilities area is concerned with development and validation of analytical and\nexperimental methods, teat facilities, and simulation teclmiqurs.\nCurrent analytical pregrams such as KRASH, DYCAST, and MSOM.LA should be kept up to date\nand extended. Updating relates to modern progrmn architecture to reduce cunsumption of\ncomputer resources and to facilitate user application, Further, with the advent of more powerful\ncomputers, existing codes should be rewritten to reflect these advances.\nExtension of the analyses should more accurately depict the behavior of the structure. Occupant\nmodels should be extended to provide for 3-D response and for multiple occupants in a seat unit.\n\n135\n\n"E\n1_ _\n\nE\n\n0\n\no\xc2\xb0\n\n-JU_\n\n.ou.\n\n0\n\nE\n\ne _\n\n- o.E c\n\no\n\nE m E: _ \xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xb0\'E\n\n.c\n\n_\n_\n\n_n\n\n-\n\no. co\n, _ 0 g\n\n,,cO.\n\n_\n\no\no\n\n\xc2\xa3\nc\n\n\xc2\xa2,\n\n=\n\nmP_\n\nm_,\n\nFor instance, the inclusion of accurate modeling of seat structure and restraint harltcss in\noccupant medals to depict the interaction between occupants and structure.\n\n:_,_\n_\n\nStructural programs should be extended to permit accurate representation of fluid pressures in\nfuel tanks under sudden accelerations for the tank rupture problem. Where multiple failure medea\nare passible, heuristic logic may be incorporated in the coding to permit the dynamic response to\nfollow _\'minimumenergy" paths, These types of approaches may even lead to using the computer\nto optimize the model while processing the data.\n\n__\n__\n\nDevelopment of modular analysis systems that permit the analyst to use only the modules\nnecessary for the solution of problem at hand is needed. While it is desirable to enhance the\ncapability of the analysis system, it should not be necessary to drag all these additional features\ninto the computer for every problem. For instance, if one is analyzing floor structure only, then\nuse of computer resources is a must.\nAnalytical methods and models for simulation of boundary conditions needs to be improved_\nmodules programs introduce loads response or hydrodynandcsprings or through fixed boundaries,\nCurrent and storage for occupant into the models through forces may not be needed. Efficient\nAccurate representation of this process is necessary if detailed simulated structural behavior is to\nbe achieved.\n\n_\n\nThe level of validation achieved for the analytical tools will affect the usefulness of the tools for\nengineering purposes. Hence, every effort is n_ded to improve fidelity of mlalyticul results in\nsimulating the crash response of structure. Experience and supporting data for modeling that will\nextend the applicability of analytical methods and develop confidence in engineering application are\nneeded.\nCreshworthinese test method research and development is separated into four areas:\ninstrumentation and data processing, dynamic procedures, static procedures, and scale modeling.\nEffort in these areas is needed to improve current techniques to better represent crash conditions,\nto permit the study of structural subsystems, to acquire data for hybrid simulation, and to allow the\nuse of scale models for testing large aircraft or components.\nWhile a crashmay have aduration of many seconds from initial impact to final arre_tment, the critical\ndeformation of structure may occur in milliseconds. This small time inlpesea severe sampling\nrequirements on instrumentation. Current teat data contains errors due to accelerometer drift,\ncoordination of events, and to processing problems. Further, definition of actual response may be\nincomplete. Deflections should be dynamically measured to properly account for the sequence of\nfailuresemdthe effects of spring.beck. In addition, the instrumentation must be sufficiently rugged to\nwithstand the crash environment and still function properly.\nResearch and development is needed to improve the measurement of accelerations, velocities, and\ndeflections under test conditions. The application of laser techulques should be investigated.\nPhotography is particularly difficult and efforte to extend the coverage to high-frame rates is needed.\nPicture enhancement procedures developed for space exploration may have application.\n\n,\n\nFurther effort is needed to handle the vast quantities of information obtained in a test and to present\nthis information in a readily digestible forumt. This is particularly true of photographic data.\nDynamic test procedures may be separated into complete aircraft testing and structural\nsubsystems tests. Methods of testing complete aircraft are complicated simply by the scale of the\nmodel, The up-coming test of the 720 aircraft in 1984 will suggest further areas for development.\n\n137\n\nPn_\'edurcs for testing structural subsystems need further development. Current t_st nwtheds for\ntesting seat,s/occupant/restraints have provided good data. llowever, these methods are limited in\nm_lcl si_, und in the crash pulse, which may be simulated, hi addition, the construction and\niostxumenttatiou of occupant models still raise m_myquestim_a.In many respects, these problems are\nfacility related.\nSome testing of structural subsystems has been accomplished on fuel tanks and fuselage _ctiona\nfor small aircraft. These tests have been limited in direction of impact loads and in size of the test\nspecimen. Extension of these methods to other subsystems and to a more complete range of load\nconditions requires effort. Further, the proper rep_sentation of structural boundary conditions\nand of-external loads is needed.\nStatic test results have been found to be useful in obtaining input data for simulations involving\nsome lightweight, highly stiff substructures. Methods for conducting these types of tests need\ndevelopment. In particular, methods of applying loads statically to simulate the dynamic load\ndistribution are required. Further, a method of maintaining the applied loads and their directions\nthrough the largo structural deflections is needed.\nScale modeling for crash tests to provide data at reduced costa and in a timely manner should be\ninvestigated. While scalh_g laws for crash testing are known, limitations on the method need be\ndeveloped particularly with regard to model details and for orthotopic materials such as\ncomposites. Problems may exist with regard to ply thickness and fabrication methods for these\nmaterials.\nFACILITIES\nIt is expected that as crashworthinese research and development progress, extension of existing\nfacilities will be required. For some types of testing new facilities may be needed. A part of the\ntotal program is updating of existing facilities and development of new facilities.\nAs some facilities already exist in the FAA, NASA, the military, and industry, a team approach to\nfacilities development should be used. An overview committee of interested parties should provide\ngoals and policy for expansion and development of the nece_ary facilities.\nSIMULATION TECHNIQUES\nMethods of simulation need development. Methods of modeling to use analytical tools and of\ntesting, to identify crash response, need to be developed to levels suitable for engineering\napplication. Various approaches should be verified and-validated. As better methods are\ndeveloped, this information should be made available.\nCOMPLETE AIRCRAFT TRaTI]gG\nCrash testing of complete highly ilmtrtmlented aircraft is divided into three areas: identification of\ncrash response mechanisms, atructtwal subsystem performance, and advanced concept evaluation.\nEach of these areas is treated below.\nComplete aircraft testa are required to identify the structural crash reepenae mechanisms\nincluding the interaction of various subsystems. Included in this area are evaluation of crash loads,\nstructural reeponze, acceleration environment, and scenario definition.\nCrash loads and acceleration environment will provide data for compsrisen with calculated values.\nThese data, in conjunction with data derived from aceidents, may be used to aseeu the adequacy of\n\n138\n\ni\n\ncrsshwarthine_ for complete aircraft, Structural response will provide defisetien, failure mode,\nand sequence date useful to the a_eMment of engineering methods such as simulation and\nmodeling. Further, it may be used to evaluate, and refine crash scenarios,\nStructural subsystem crash performance may be obtained in the complete aircraft teat. Loads\nexperienced by the subsystems may be obtained for comparisons with design values and for use in\nsubsystem testing. Failure medes and sequence may be obtained including effects of interartion\nwith other subsystems. Energy absorption characteristios of the subsystem may be assessed and\nthe adequacy of its crash performance may be assayed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nComplete aircraft tests should also be used to evaluate advanced crashworthiness concepts. For\ninstance, applications of advanced materials or energy absorption designs for various subsystems\nmay be assessed. Effects of such components on crash leeds and environment may be evaluated.\nAs part of this testing, the contribution of the various subsystems in reducing the fire hazard end\nin protecting the occupants may be evaluated. Further, the full-scale crash tests afford\nopgp___nnityto refine the definition end relate crash loads end displacements to scenarios.\nSTRUCTURAL SUBSYSTEMS\nResearch into the crash behavior of structural subsystems consists of beth analysis and test.\nEmphasis is placed on treatment of subsystems because the subsystems must perform their crash\nfunction in order to achieve crashworthineee for complete aircraft. Further, it is in detailed\nmechanisms _,f faihtre that engineering changes may be affected. In addition, in testing the\nsubsystem, detailed-ccash-respense of the subsystem may be better measured than from complete\naircraft testing.\nThe potential for improved crash performance for structural systems has been assessed to provide\nsome guidance for.the planning of a research program. The potehtial for improved performance is\nassessed relative to the crash function. On this basis the aseesement in table 5.5 is presented.\nThe rating potential for improved performance is given in relative terms; C being good potential, B\nbeing better, and A being best. These ratings are subjective and do not reflect the t4Jfficulty in\nadvancing the technology. It is expected that some ratings will change as the re._eareh and\ndevelopment program progresses.\nAnalytical research treats the methods of modeling the subsystem to depict detailed crash\nresponse. Subsystems of immediate intei_st are wing tankage, seaUoccupent, floor/seat/occupant,\nand fuselage sections. In this endeavor, the full power of analytical programs may be used to\nrepresent the structure in detail. Results of these analyses should be validated with subsystems\ntests. Computer programs may be assessed for technical deficiencies end simulation techniques\nmay be developed for engineering application.\nTesting of structural subsystems will permit identification of detailed failure mechanisms and\nsequences of events in simulated crash conditions. In addition, these results may serve as a basis\nfor comparison for the evaluation of advanced concepts. In many instances, representative metal\nstructure suitable for testing may be obtained from overagsd transports being retired from service,\nFurther, such structure specimens are within the teat capacity of some existing facilities.\nAdvanced material appliostione for some subsystems may also be tested as a part of the metal\nspecimens.

Based an these development. 1,in dly, a research and development\nprogram is recommended.\nWhen censidaring all the eannnereiul air transportation system safety related problem areas it is\nbelieved that the meat stgnificant reduction in fatalities can be achieved by simply reducing the\nnumber of accidents. No significant technological breakthroughs are required to achieve this goal. In\nsection 2, it was shown that approximately 76% of the commercial jet aircraft accidents have been\nattributed to cockpit crew factors. Therefore, research and study of these factors in areas of cockpit\ndesign, system design, and crew human factors should receive major emphasis.\nAnother safety-related problem area is the airport environment. Studies of ground traffic control\nsystems and ground operation procedures should be directed toward elimination of collision\naccident. The severity of many veer-off end overrun accidents could be substantially reduced if\nhazards on and around the eirport were eliminated.\nCurrent.commercial jet transport aircraft possess s high level of cresliwor thinesa. This is due in part\nto stronger structure, less volatile fuel and improved design methods. Design methods are\ncontinually being improved baaed on knowledge gained from accident experience. It is desirable to\ncontinue this improvement of existing designs and to retain their beneficial characteristics as future\ndesigns using advanced materials and concepts are developed. To achieve this will require\nsubstantial advances in structural crashworthiness technology.\nCONCLUSIONS OF THE STRUCTURAl, CRASHWORTHINESS.ST.UDY\nFirst, the greatest potential for improvedsurvivability in centmetcial jet transport aircraft accidents is in the area of fire related fatalities. Research relating to prevention of fuel fire merits the highest\npriority. Time is a critical element associated with escape when a severe fuel fire exists outside the\naircraft or when the aircraft is sinking in deep water. If flame and smoke enter the fuselage paa_nger\narea immediately after the aircraft comes to rest, the probability of escape is reduced substantially.\nRetaining fuselage integrity and delaying entrance of smoke and flame is essential if survivability is to\nbe enhanced. Debris and obstructions that hinder movement of persons on the escape route cause\ndelays that reduce the probability of survival. Consequently, factors that would increase the available\ntime for egress or reduce the time required for egress is esaential. Fuel additives as in the antimisting kerosene program, rupture reelstsnt fuel tanks or cells, and structural improvements to\nprotect fuel tanks and occupant8 should be subjects of research.\nSecond, structural integrity of fuel systems, fuselage, and landing gear are leading candidates for\nimproved craahworthinesa. Structural integrity of fuel systems is a key factor in prevention of\npeetcraah fire. L_tegrity of the fuselage cenlz\'ibutes to the reduction of fire related fatalities by\npreventing or delaying the eutL\'yof fuel, fire, and smoke and by maintaining egress routes. Main\nlanding gear that are more tolerant to off-runway cunditiene would continue to provide ground\nclearance for the wing and engine pods thereby reducing wing breaks and tearing of tank lower\nsurfaces, and engine pod sccubbing or separation.\nThird, where trauma fatalities have predeninmted, the energy alamarbingprotective capability of the\naircraft structure generally has been expended and the aircraft has experienced major structural\n\n!\n1,13\n\nd,unagc.

Ill addition, such\ndata will be useful in refiuolueut of the accident scenarios.\nAdvaact_l aircraft prt_hlcms are concerned with tile intxoduetinn of advanced mat4,_risls,\ngraphite/epoxies in particular. Problem areas exist in material crash perforlmmce, advanced\ncemponent performance, and with aircraft occupant protection concepts. Problems with material\nperformance inehales high energy impact resistsnt\'_ and burn characteristics, l)esigu latitude\nafforded by thesc materials in ply orientatiolt and intxodu,-tion of modifying nmterials may permit\ndesirable impact characteristics to-be achieved. With regard to burn characteristics, these\nadvanced materials may provide protcctio,l to the occupant by not meltiug in the prcsence of a\nheat pulse while retaining a char barrier and by reduced friction sparking.\n\nb_\n_\n\n\'\n\nCrash performance of structural components made from advanced materials must be compared to\nthat of eurrcnt structural components. Differences in performance must be assessed for their\neffec\xc2\xa3 on accident perfmanance of the complete aircraft. Impact response mechanisms of advanced\ncomponents must be uuderatood in order that accident performance might be optimiu,d.\nNew occupant protection concepts for advanced aircraft may be required. Current metal aircraft\nhave inherent properties contributing to crashworthine_ provisions in addition to other deeit,m\nconditions that :nay not be present in advanced aircraft. Consequently. it may be nece_qary to\nintroduce new approaches to occupant protection.\nSince accident performance of full-scale aircraft has such an important role in crashworthinc_q.\nproblems of testing fall-scale aircraft must be addressed. In addition to technical problems of test\nmethods, data acquisition, and reduction\xc2\xb0 tile severity levels of the testa must be within the\nenvelope of survivable accidents for maximum application of the resale. This requires further\nrefinement of the accident scenarios and implies some knowledge of huma,i injury tolerance. These\nproblems should be resolved prior to the phumed test of the 720 aircraft.\nRFA\'OMMENDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nA research and development program is presented. One objective is to understand the crash\nresponse of current designs and to develop structural impact technology that might improve\ncurrent commercial jet transport aircraft and serve as a basis for the assessment of advanced\naircraft structure. A second objective is to understand the crash perforumnce of advaut_i\nstructural components. A third objective is to obhtin crash environmental data from fall-scale\ncomplete aircraft tests for validation of technology mid for asee_sn)eut of crash scenarios.\nRecommendations are given for current metal aircraft, advanced aircraft, and for fall-scale\ncomplete aircraft teats.\nCURRENT METAL AIRCRAFT\nRe_eareh on reduction of the poeterash fire hazard is recommended. SAFER (_mratittee\nrecommendations on fuel additives, fire rceietsnce, and fuel contaimnent technology are\nsupported.\nWith reslgx\'t to the structural role in fuel containment, research into tile various meehanielns of\ntank rupture is recommended. Experimental and analytical methl_ls of shnalating tank rupture in\ncrash conditions should be develol_d. Ram,arch should include fall-scale aircraft and cmnponent\nteatrag of structural improvements and of devices or toehniqocs to reduce the fuel flow rate from\nfractured tanks.\n\n146\n\n!\n:\n\nf1\n\nTo improve oecupm_t cgreM, the effee_ of representative crash accelerations and displacements\nan containment of cabin interior equipment and cantcnta should be determined, Galleys, overhead\ncompartments, ceiling panels, lighting, and other interior appointments should be studied to reduce\nblockage of egress routes. For water entry, new designs and teehniquse for storage and\ndeployment of lifo rafts and floatation equipment that will facilitate egress and eliminste blockage of\nexits should be developed.\nResearch to improve etructaral integrity of the fuselage is recommended. Studies into the\nmechanisms of fuselage breaks, maintenance of protective shell, optimization of energy absorption,\ndistortions at doors and hatches and floors for the crash scenarios should be done. To accomodate\nwaterentry, studies of design improvements that will eliminate tearing and rupturing of the fuselage\nlower surface by hydraulic action of the water (some inward crushing would be tolerable) thus\nimproving the floatation capability should be done.\nMain landing gear accident performance in rough terrain should be studied. Crash loads and\ndisplacements for existing gear concepts for representative hazards should be determined, The\ninteraction of the gear and the attaching structure should be understood. Advanced concepts for\nimproved crash performance should be developed.\nResearch for trauma injury reduction is recommended. Studies to ascertain the effects of fuselage\nstructural arrangement on the acceleration impulse and floor displacement experienced at the points\nof seat attachment should be conducted. Effects of the shape, magnitude, and duration of the seat\nacceleration impulse on eeat/occupantJreatraint system response should be obtained for current\nseats and for new lightweight seats. Also seat capability in terms of both static and dynamic loading\nshould be established. Effects of occupant parameters such as mass, size, distribution, occupant\naccelerations, restraint effectiveness and seat deformation should be obtained.

Nvw npproachvs to occupant protection should be investigated.\nFULL-SCALE CRASH TESTS\nThe planned 720 crash test should be instrumented to obtain data on structural components and\nseat/occupantJrestraint systems. Crash response modes and loads on both the structural\ncomponenta and the scat/occupant/restraint system should be obtained. Full-scale tests should be\nused to refine the scenario.\n\n_.\n\nFuture testa would serve to evaluate other scenarios and to more completely define the crash\nenvironment and crash response mechanisms.

As advanced materials are incorporated into future aircraft, full.scale testa for occupant\nprotection concept validation should be considered.

Parka\nD.W. Twigg\n\nABSTRACT\nThe newest update to the U.S. Army\'s Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide for Army aircraft was\nreviewed for ideas that might apply in other systems and therefore bear further research.\nPhilosophically, many features were compatible with the philosophy and practices for commercial\nsystems. However, the Guide does not make allowances for widely varying differences in crash\ncharacteristics and inherent energy absorption features from one system to another, e.g., from\nsmall rigid body aircraft with minimal subfloor volume for energy absorption to large flexible body\naircraft with large subfloor volume for energy absorption. Additionally, the orientation is for\nsurvival under any circumstances _hat Army operations might encounter--a far more hazurdoua\nset of circumstances than will occur for commercial veldc|_. Accordingly, this appraisal does not\nget into all criteria in the Guide but instead provides a review of those features that may bear\nfurther consideration in research and development studies.\n\n159\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nThe purl_,of the present study is to review and critique the new U,S, Army\'a (\',rashSurviwll l)e_dgu\n(|uide (ref, 1)-1)for research ideas that might ultimately benefit commercial uircraft safety end thus\nbear further research attentiun to resolve potential value in conmwreial air_\'raftapplie_ilone. It is also\nintended to distinguish these elmnents which may and which may not readily transfer from light and\nsmall rigid body aircraft to large flexible body transports.\n\n"\n\n_\n\nThe authors of the new Guide accepted and are to be commended for responding to a major\nchallenge. They have attempted to refine earlier editions of the Guide and to indicate more room for\ntrade-ells than earlier issues implied. For example, the third edition of the Army Crash Survival\nDesign Guide more carefully constrains the guideline recommendations to the small rigid Ix_dy\nairplanes used by the U,S. Army than earlier editions, i,e., the light fixed wing alrcreft and\nhelicopters, Additionally, the authors indicate many of the trade-ofre end realistic constraints that\nmust be considered relative to the guidellnce, introducing the possibility of waivers by the Army,\nbased on trade-ells of objectives versus realistic design constraints. The indicated trade-offs\nillimirats potential problemsin gelle_g\nwithin vehicles, and by extension problems in attempts to\ngeneralize guidelines developed for the Army to large flexible body commercial airplanes.\nSince the 1967 and 1971 versions of the Guide, many areas of progress in development, in test and\nevaluation, and in operational experience have added to the fund of knowledge. However, guidelines\nor criteria spelled out in the earlier Guide were in fact sometimes unduly restrictive, sometimes\ndifficult-to-impossible to achieve, and conservative even for the Army objectives. Ill this latest\nversion of the Guide, these constraints are more apparent, more need for tradcoffs from the\n"criterion _ conditions are recognized, and diatinctioua between military and commercial\nenvironments are more obvious. However, and perhaps partially due to the greater autonomy the\nArmy has as beth purchaser and user, the new Guide does not yet really address minimum\nrequirements that must be met; the orientation remains one of setting goals as trade-off positions.\nThe new Guide is in five volumes, In this appendix, information is abstracted, collated and\nsynthesized across the five volumes to integrate the information into one single abstract summary.\nThis summary is a synthesis and critique of the U.S, Army\'s Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide\nin that it is in the main constrained to research possibilities for other systems, Accordingly, it\nincludes information that may be relevant for commercial aircraft research efforts, and includes\nquestions regarding the Army Guide position, Since there was significant overlap and some\n\n_:..\n\n]B\'\n\nconsiderable redundancy between volumes, volumes. element in the present effort was to abstract\nand correlate related information from all a major Information herein follows the _me general\n\nVolume I -- Design Criteria and Checklists\nPertinent criteria extracted from Volumes II through V, Provides for updating earlier related\nmilitary standards and D-l).\nformat.

Large, flexible body cummercial aircraft\nwith a large cargo hold in the lower fuselage are clearly different in design features that will affect\ncrash loads and probable dynamic responses in direct contrast to those expected for the smaller\nand lighter rigid body Army aircraft.

Within tile extremely short\nduration range of abrupt accelerations (0.2 sec and below), the effects on the human body are\nlimited to mechanical overloading (skeletal and soft tiseue stresses), there being insufficient time\nfor functional disturbances due to fluid shifts.\n:iI.\n\nCOMMENT:Withinle_ than .050 see. Theused to define criteria are less thanwhere effects on the\nand most typically the Guide, high loads authors state that this region is one second duration\nshifts. In large commercial aircraft, pulses are generally accepted as ranging up to 0.2 to\n0.25 seconds. limited to mechanical overload of structure and tissue since time is too short for fluid\nhuman bodyare\nHuman Tolerance -- A selected array of parameters that describe a condition of human body\ndscelecative loading, i.e., a crash pulse for which it is believed there is a reasonable probability of\nsurvival without major injury (this is also termed "whole-body toleraAce_). "As used in this volume\n(liD, designing for the limits of human tolerance refers to providing design features that will\nmaintain these conditions at or below their tolerable levels to enable the occupant to survive the\ngiven crash environment."\nHuman tolerance to the crash environment is a function of many variables, including unique\ncharacteristics of each person as well as the impinging loads. Loads are transmitted from the seat.\nthe restraint system and the surrounding environment. Tolerability depends on load direction,\nbody orientation, and the critical nature of the load relative to a body member. For example,\nconditions wherein the belt rides up off the iliac crests of the pelvis may contribute excessive\nabdominal loads, or skull fracture may result from head contact, or the type of loads applied to the\nspine may create injury.\nCOMMENT:Definition implies that it is possible and practical to design to human tolerance limits\nand assure era\'rival without exception; in actuality, other text dearly indicates this to be\nconsidered a goal which is not necessarily achievable. Resulting implications are misleading to the\nnewcomer to the field.\nThe Term "G"-- Refer_ to the ratio of acceleration encountered to that from gravitational attraction\non a given body at sea level, (i.e., relative to 32.2 ft/asc2). In use herein, "G" increments are\nreferenced in multiples of same, so 5 G is 5 times the normal forces on the body.\nSurvivable Accident -- An accident in which the forces to the occupant(s) are within tolerance\nlimits and the surrounding structure remains substantially intact to provide a livable volmne\nthroughout the crash sequence.\nCOMMENT:Definition of survivability varies between volumes of the Guide. One is to "eliminate\nunneceseary injuries and fatalities in rehtively mild impacts" (Volume 1). Another is to "minimize\noccupant accelerations to survivable levels in a severe crash environment tVulumc II).\n\n161\n\n_-_\n\nSurvival Envclope -- The range of impact conditions wherein thc eccupiablo area of the aircraft\nremains substantially intact, (i.e., wherein forces transmitted to occupants do not exceed the limits\nof human tolerance when state-of, the-art restraint aystams are used). As a precauticn, accident\ninvestigation will not necewrily show that survivable conditions may not have existed in an\naccident that may appear from postcrash inspection to have been survivable; elastic recovery from\ncrash induced deformation can mask actual crash conditions.\nSubmarining -- The rotation of the hips under and through the lap-belt as the belt slips up and off\nthe iliec crests of the pelvis caused by forward inertial loads on the legs. "Lap-beltslippage" can be\na direct result of the upward loading of the shoulder harness straps at the _.entsrof the lap-belt.\n(figure D-2.1, from ref. D-2).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDynamic Overshoot - The amplification of decelarative force on cargo or personnel above the\nimpact deceleration force resulting from dynamic response of the system. For example, a loose\nsystem can dramatically increase peak loads.\nSEATING GEOMETRY\nSee figure D-2.2, from MIL-STD-1333, MIL-STD-850, and U.S. Army\'s Aircraft Crash Survival\nDesign Guide (ref.

A second is to design "for\nthe limlta of human tolerance\'...to maintain conditions at or below their tolerable levels to enable the\noccupant to survive the given crash environment. A third is implied, to survive any crash and be\n"combat ready."\nBACKGROUND DISCUSSION\n\n\'\n_"\n\nThe Army approach to improving survivability has been in two stakes, first by improving the\n"eraehworthiness" of existing aircraft as practicable, then by influencing design of new aircraft\nthrough aseurin_ consideration of improved capabilities. Army objectives for their "ersehworthy"\naircraft relate to minimizing injuries and fatalities and controlling structural damage so that "a\nsurvivable environment is more likely to be maintained." Army criteria were related to combat goals,\nin order to produce a positive morale factor and improve combat effectiveness. The army\naccordingly gives great emphasis and apparently considerable funding to maximize protection\nafforded to occupants by each subsystem without really addressing what minimum requirements\n\n169\n\nt\n\nmight be. In providiug maximum protection aa the anthers of the updated Al_ny Gradesee it, a vert\'ezd\ndifferent ductile\ncrash impact is a series of energy absorbing strokes that occur as\ncomponents\nyield. They use landing gear stroking to absorb a significant amount of energy\', the fuselage\ncontributes to abserption and pruvides a protective shell for occupants; the floor, seat, and restraint\nsystems contain occupunts within the shell and provide additional energy absorption to reduce\nc_;upant decelcrative loading. Additionally, weapon sights, cyclic e_ontrela,glareshields, instrument\npanels, armor, and structure are to be delethalized.\n\n_\'\n\nCOMMENT:The authors of the new Army Guide do not follow the more common engineering\n,\n\npractice of allowing a cumulative system credit bssod on a summation of capabilities for components\nto some minimum requirement goal for energy absorption. Instead, they emphasize maximmn\nprotection possible from each subsystem, taking the position that it is not possible to simply specify\nhuman tolerance and vehicle crash conditions. For example, they take the position that designers\nmust also consider probable crash conditions wherein all subsystems cannot perform their desired\nfunctions, e.g., no landing gear absorption of impact energy, since helicopters may not contact the\nground via the landing gear. Criterion levels that are actually oriented to maximum possible\nperformance are thus also recommended in the Guide for each individual subsystem, e.g., ;n energy\nabsorption requirements for seat and restraint systems.\nThis amounts to extremely conservative engineering practice, since cumulative capabilities are\naccepted standard practice and since most design criteria are based on specifying minimum, not\nmaximum, requirements. Opinions, practicality, and even estimates of feasibility will vary, creating a\ndifficult-to-impossible situation. Secondly, design goals are not usually specified or accepted as a\ndesign practice. Additionally, the practice of generalizing from the worst case for one system to\nother aircraft that seldom, if ever, encounter that case is hard to justify (e.g., generalizing vertical\nloading criteria from upside down landing of a helicopter, or using helicopter based impact loads that\nare due to rotor thrashing, to set criteria for fixed wing aircraft with their vastly different impact\ncircumstances).\nAIRCRAFT\n\nCRASH ENVIRONMENT\n\nStatistical wereconducted\nstudies\ntodetermine\nimpact\nconditions rotary\nfor\nwingandlight\nfixedir_g\nw\naircraft\nofmission\ngross\nweightno greaterhan12,500\nt\npoundsduring\ntheperiod\n1960through\n1965,\nand 1971through1976(VolumeHI)(alsoef.).\nr 6 Cases\nselected atleastnesurvivor\nhad\no\nandoneormoreofthefollowing\nfactors: substantial\n(1)\nstructural\ndamage,(2)\npostcrash (3)\nfire,\npersonnel\ninjuries.\nNumeroussevere\naccidents\nwereexcludedromconsideration,\nf\nsuchasmidair\ncollisions\norfree drops\nfall\nof100ftormore because,\n"Suchaccidents\nalmost\ninvariably\nresult\nin\nrandom,\nunpredictable kinematics\ncrash\nandnonsurvivable\nimpact\nforces,\nandareoflittle in\nvalue\nestablishingrealistic\ncrash survival envelopes that would be useful to the\naircraft designer."\nCOMMENT:In view of typical impact speeds compared to helicopters and light aircraft, most large\ncommercial aircraft accidents may fall in this high load category.\nImpact\nconditions\nwerefound\ntobesimilar\nfromrotary\nwingtolight\nfixedingSTOL aircraft,\nw\nand,\nexcept\nforlateral\nconditions,\nweretreated\nasbeing\nthesame.Impactvelocities\nwere"known"for\nwhatappearsobeasomewhatarbitrarily\nt\nselected\nsample\nof40 aircraft\noutof600+ accidents\nthat\nwere reviewed (with errorain estimated impact velocity "probably" not exceeding + 20%), but could\nnot be established for other aircraft crashes.

Average longitudinal accelerations wore 15 G and average\nlateral accelerations were 16 G (most particularly during auto rotation into trees, fuselage rotation,\nthen lending on the side). ActuaLly, most accidents occurred with small yaw and roll angles.\nAccidents involving pegtcreali fire were considers _ where possible, but burn damage in many\naccident_ precluded analysis ef impact forces. Still ott_ers provided insufficient or inadequate data\nfor detailed case analyds.\nEarlier impact criteria u_-_iby Army were based on an early decision to increase crash survivability\nthat appears to have been somewhat arbitrary (Army Crash Survival Design Guide, first and second\neditien) to a level based on a study in the 1960 to 1965 time period (Halay, ref. D-6) which defined\na survivable crash a_any crash with at least one survivor, and setting objectives for Army aircraft to\nthe 95th percentile loads for such conditions, The authors of the new Guide emphasize that, new\nthat serious attempts to meet the criteria have been incorporated to some extent in a number ef Army\naircraft, it would be a mistake to continue using a floating baseline (i.e., the 95th percenti]_ crash)\nsince it could only lead to a never-ending increase in crashworthinese at the expense ef aircraft\nperfermance. Accordingly, the 95th percentile criteria i_ dropped in the new Guide_nd the design\npulse derived in the earlier effort continues to be recommended for Army use (figure D.3.1).\nCOMMENT: The rationale for selecting only 40 aircraft for the sample analysis not totally clear.\nThere is a reasonable likelihood that many of the cases that were, accordingly, not included in the\nstudy could very well have been mere mild but were not survived fur some ether reason than\ndeceleration, such as fire. Additionally, much is based on the very cenmrvative case ef a 95th\npercentile accident; however, data reported within the Guide suggest a factor of 2 + in magnitude\nbetween the 90th and the 95th percentile accident, which varies considerably from the normal\nmagvitude of the "ruestatistical difference between 90th and 95 percentile (a 20% change rather than\na 200% change). There is no clear justification for the 90th or 95th percentile survivability goal to be\nadopted, other than as an arbitrary goal for which the degree ef feasibility remains to be determined.\n\n171\n\nI\n0\ntl\n\nt2-tl\n2\n\nt2\n\nt3\n\nTime\n\nt2-t I\n\nFigure D-3. 1 - Typical A/rcraft Floor Acceleration Pulse (From Army CSDG)\n\nb\n\n172\n\n_.

Additionally, the exclusion of certain types of severe accidents\ncauses no problems for the analysis of light aircraft crashes for Army purposes and given their\nfreedom to waive guidelines. A light aircraft accident of sufficient severity to have "random,\nunprectible crash kinematics" would rarely have a survivor. This is not true in the commercial\nenvironment. Because of the size and inherent energy absorption from body flexing of a large\ncommercial aircraft, crash forces to which the occupanta are exposed can vary considerably through\nlhe aircraft. It is not uncommon for there to be a few survivors even in a severe accident at flight\nspeeds and with "unpredictable crash kinematics." Thus the methodology for establishing crash load\ncriteria developed in the Guide should not be applied to commercial aircraft.\n\n_-\n\nAIRFRAME STRUCTURAL CRASHWORTHINESS\nIn the updated Guide, discussion starts with the basic requirements for survival, i.e., a protective\nstructural envelope and the attenuation of impact forces. Basic design goals/requirements are also\nstated, recognizing that improvements may be feasible but using qualitative terms in recognition that\nachievements wiU be limited.\n\n_..\n\nAIRFRAME CRASHWORTHINESS\nGeneral Design Considerations--The U.S. Army\'eAircraft Crash Survival Design Guide appears to\nbe specifically intended to define criteria for vehicles designed to support the Army capability "to\nconduct prompt and sustained combat incident to operations on land. _ All the combat groundsupport functions described involve the potential of exposure to enemy fire while at some\nnominal altitude, i.e.:\n\n_\n\n!.\n\nCommand, control and communications\n\n3.\n2.\n\nMobility\nIntelligence\n\n4.\n\nFire power\n\nsupport\n5.\nCombat service\nThe Army inventory includes beth helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.

Lateral\nimpact levels for cargo and attack helicopters are said to compare to light fixed wing aircraft, and\nother helicopters experience a more severe lateral impact environment.\nThe authors go on to state that experience and reason indicate that there will continue to be\naccidents that threaten occupant survival. However, their position is "acceptable aircraft\nstructures should always provide the greatest possible degree of occupant protection from crash\nconditions. All available information should be considered ... to ensure that new designs will\nbe\'aceeptebly\' crashworthy." They consider desirable conditions to include multiple load paths to\nkeep the structure intact in spite of localized damage. However, they recognize that excessively\nstrong structure does not necessarily meet this objective; in the nonyielding modes, it will\ncontribute high acceleration and involve beth weight penalties and e_lergy absorption constraints.\nThe 95th percentile design load limits based on severe\ncrash accelerations in this guide sot several\nnew criteria comp._red to the earlier version; they also tend to shift the emphasis from peak\naccelerations to average accelarationa, Their requirements (for a severe crash) compared to FAA\nrequirements for a minor crash are shown in figures D-3,4 and I).3.5.\nImpact conditions may include:\nHelicopter\n1,\n\nVertical impact from power failure during low power maneuver at low altitude\n\n2,\n\nInverted impact (and other impact attitudes) following rotor contact with wires, trees, etc.\n\nLight fixed-wing\nI.\n\nVertical impect\nwith stall near ground\n\n175\n\nI\n\nm\n\n176\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nimpact\ndirection\n(aircraft\naxes)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAcceleration\nVelocity\nchange, ,Iv\n(ft/sec)\n\nPeek\n(Q)\n\nAverage\n(<3)\n\nPulse\nduration,\n&t\n(sea)\n\nComments\n\nI\n\n_,\n;:\n_.\n\nLongitudinal\n(Cockpit)\n\n50\n\n0.104\n\n-\n\n_t_\n\n(Cabin)\nLongitudinal\n\n50\n\nO.130\n\nLateral\n\ni\n\nTriangular\ndeceleration\npulse:\n\n25a\n30b\n\n0.097\n0.104\n\nVertical\n\n42\n\n0.054\n\n&t calculated\nfrom known or\nassumed values\n\n2Or)\nAt =._\nfor Gpeak and &v:\ng Gpeak\n_\'\n\na) Light fixed-wing aircraft, attack and cargo helicopters.\n\nb) Other helicopters.\n\nFigure D-3.4 - Akcraft Design\nSummary of Crash Impact Condition= for Helicopters\n\nand Light-Fixed-Wing\n\n177\n\n00000002-TSG07\n\nCompared t_ the figure 3.4 data, commercla]aircraft size certified according\nto FAR PART 25.561, EmergencyLanding Conditions,Para (b) which requires that\n\n"...the structurebe designed to give each occupant every reasonable\nchance of escaping serious injury in a minor crash landing when\n!\n\n.\n\ni\n\n(I) proper use is made of seats, belts and all other safety\ndesign provisions;\n(2) the wheels are retracted (where applicable);\nand\n\ni\n\n(3) the occupant experiencesthe followingultimate inertia\n\ni\n\nforces acting separatelyrelative to the surroundingstructure:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nupward 2.0g\nforward 9.0g\n\n(iii) sideward 1.5g\n(iv)\n\ndownward 4.5g or any lesser force that will not\nbe exceeded when the airplane absorbs the landing\nloads resultingfrom impact with an ultimatedescent\nvelocityof five f.p.s, at design landingweight."\n\nVertical loading to 6.0g for a type I (transport)seat was later\nimposedto accommodategust loads (TechnicalStandard Order TSO 37.136,\nAircraft Seats and Berths, TSO C3qa; and National Aircraft Standard\n(NAS)BOg, Specification-Aircrafteats and Berths, January I, 1959).\nS\n3g cargo nets are used, which are also cited in the Guide as used\nby the U.S. Air Force in the USAF 463C pallet system with "statistically\nrare likelihoodof causing injury."\nFigureD-3.5 -FARPa_ 25 C#_na\n\n17H\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nlib\n\n2,\n\nLongitudinal impact with obstacles, (e,g,, mountains, ground obstacles) or nose.down diving\nattitude\n\n3.\n\nCartwheeling\n\nSecondary impacts such as hitting a ridge after the initial crash are "generally less severe for\noccupants." Hazards from detached components (e.g., engines), penetration (e.g., by trees), and\nfire and water become more severe.\nSTRUCTURAL DAMAGE\nIn the Guide\'s discussions of helicopter and light fixed-wing aircraft crashes, it is stated, ...\'The\nstructural damage that produces occupant injury is generally the same for both types of aircraft.\nStructural damage in _evere accidents cannot be avoided. However, improvements in airframe\nstructure and optimization of element dletributioncan work to control hhe manner in which structural\ndamage occurs so that a survivable environment is more likely to be maintained."\nThe structural scenario is one of localized deformation at contact until kinetic energy is absorbed\nover arelatively long stopping distance or until enough structure is involved to producea significantly\nshorter and higher deceleration force. Likelihood of damage increases with build up of large\ndecelerative forces, which may in turn cause aircraft buckling and compression of the protective\ncabin shell. Cabin deformation may be reduced by permitting parts to break free on impact; however,\nthis may produce no significant reduction in impact loads.\nVariations on this Army scenario of crash loads, direction and build-up include: (1) Longitudinal:\ndeformation of forward areas in such a way as _ form a scoop which picks up earth. Alternatively,\nthe nese might roll under the aircraft. In more direct, head-on crashes into the ground, the nose\ngenerally deforms to destroy the occupied section. (2) Vertical: from high sink rate or roll-over which\ncrushes occupiable volume, or transmits high raft/ca! _lnadsto the occupants. (Lateral toll-over\noccurs with helicoptem). (3) Lateral impacts: from rotor actions or roll-over that relates to the high\ncenter of gravity with hollcoptera and from spin-in with light fixed wing aircraft. (4) Lateral or\nlongitudinal: transverse bending loads may deform or rupture the shell; (5) Any of the crash\nscenarios may create floor buckling which may degrade integrity and strength of floor structure, or\nlending gear may penetrate the fuselage; and rupture of fuel or ignitable fuel containers is a frequent\ncause of fire.\nDESIGN REQUIRI_ENTS\n\n-- (GUIDELINES) GENERAL\n\nAccording to Guide authors, "aircraft systems should be designed to prevent occupant fatalities and\nminimize the number and Severity of occupant injuries to Severities as were defined in figure 13-3.4to\nthe maximum extent practical."

However, it is very likely nearly\nimpossible to assure that such objectives can be met in advance or have been met after the fact.\nANCILLARY EQUIPMENT RETENTION\nRetention of ancillary equipment at criterion loads is "required. _ Load limiting devices should\nminimize the likelihood of equipment to enter an occupant strike envelope.

Additionally, tile dr_lmatic change in load level criteria as the "survivable _\nerash changes from the 9,Sth percentile to the 90th percentile is puzzling.

To say the least, it is unusual for a change amounting to a factor of\n2 to occur in this percentile spread regardless of the parameter (or, ill other words, aczotmting for\n50% of the total range).\nAIRFRAME PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\nAuthors of the Guide take the position that certain criteria are applicable whether results are\napproximate or precise:\n1.\n\nStructure surrounding occupiable area must remain reasonably intact, without significantly\nreducing space. Otherwise other "efforts to improve survivability .., are futile."\n\n2.\n\nIdeally, %tructure should minimize occupant accelerations to survivable levels in a severe\ncrushenvironment while maintaining the requiredsurvivable volume, retaining large mass items,\ninterior eqnipmenq seats and cargo," and considering effects from roll over, cabin penetration,\netc.\n\nBy U.S. Army philosophy, aircraft structure should first be designed for normal loads, operations,\nperformance, apace, fatigue life, etc., tb.en secondly to handle normal payload conditions. Then "the\neffects of crash loads must be considered to determine where structural modifications are needed to\nimprove crashworthiness."\nCOMMENT:This reinforces earlier conclusions of the present critique, that the new Guide gives\ngreater emphasis to practical improvements for safety and survivability purposes after basic mission\ndesign is completed.\nFUSELAGE CONSIDERATIONS\nDesign of the fuselage can control both the degree of collapse and the level of acceleration\nexperienced by occupants during a crash. On the one hand, selected regions can be designed to\nwithstand greater forces without collapse. On the other hand, deformation and collapse of other\nstructure in unoccupied regions can be used to improve energy absorption potential. Other variables\nand trede-offa to be considered include the following related U,S. Army design cor.cepts, However,\ndesign considerations listed below may not be applicable to commercial jet aircraft. For example,\noperating speeds for large commercialaircraft hardlymake survival of a 30 \xc2\xb0 impact at 130 kn landing\nspeeds a likely outcome; this is not unlike the evaluation by Guide authors of tOO ft free fall as\nunsurvivable.\nRelated U,S.

For example, numerous dynamic models of the human body have been\ndeveloped for crash impact analysis to predict the response of the occupant, restraint and/or seat\nsystems.\nOne-, two-, and three-dimensioual models have been developed.

The needi.\'d improvements are t_chnically difficult and fall into the realm of applied\nr_,_,urch. Although SOM-LA is not currently adequate for evaluation of restraint sysh:m\nla,rformsnce, it provides a rough approximation of the gross motion of the occupant for purpe_cs of\nobtaining the dyna,nic loads on the seat structure.\nThe possibility of merging these programs with a large finite-element computer program such as\nI)YCAST is alas considered and a procedure for accomphshing the merging is proposed.\nProgram Calibration\n\ni\n.\n\ndefining what is s good structural dynamics computer program are still evolving, {OccupantComputer modeling of transient structural dynamics is a relatively _lew technology, and standards\nsimulation is a special type of structural dynamics), As a consequence, each new structural\ndymmscs computer program must individually earn acceptance in the engineering community before\n\n!j\n\nits calculations will be utilized by designers.\npredicted dynamics should appear reasonable and credible to the designer and the designer should\nThere are twothat the to acceptance. First, the program must produce believable results. Thatthe\nbe confident aspects program models the main dynamic effects. To enhance_believability, is,\nprogram output should contain, in readable form, information which assists the designer to\nunderstand the dynanuc events (such as time-histories of system forces). Graphic aids are\nalso\nhelpful.\nThe second ingredient vital to engineering acceptance is demonstration of program accuracy. That\nis, demonstration of capability to reasonably predict an actual test. Achievement of predictive\naccuracy is usually a very difficult and time consuming process for occupant-simulation codes\nbecause of the nonlinear nature of the problem and the difficulty in obtaining measured values for\ndynaudc parameters. The calibration of the PROMETHEUS HI occupant-simulation computer\nprogram will be described to illustrate how this process might work.\nInstrumentation data from several sled tests were obtsined from the Federal Aviation Agencies Civil\nAere Medical Institute (CAMI),Physical data for the anthropomorphic dummies were obtained (limb\nweights, measurements, spring constraints). Properties were estimated where measured data could\nnot be found, One of the CAMI tests was then simulated by PROMETHEUS.\n\n:\n\nWhen the initial simulation did not provide satisfactory correlation with test data, the problem was\nattacked from two directions. First, it was evident that the restraint system model in PROMI,_HEUS\nwas inadequate, so a more asphisticated mathematical model of the lap belt and shoulder harness\nwas developed and added to PROMETHEUS. For example, the lap belt was refined to permit the\nslipping a_oclated with submarining, the shoulder ham. was refined and ehe_t/ehoulder flexibility\nwas added to appropriately incorporate harnem/body interactions and slipping of the harness on the\nshoulder.\n\n_"\n\nThe second approach,which was attempted concurrently with the first, was to purameticaUy vary the\nmechanical properties of the simulated occupant (such as neck stiffness and damping) in\nPROMETHEUS\nsimulations and nots the re6altmg trend_.The parametric variations hell_l provide a\nfeel for the occupant dynamics and nerved as sensitivity studies to identify the iml_rtant dynamic\nparameters. Some dynamic effects were obasrved which were not influenced by the parametric\nvariations; additional modifications were made to the mathematical modeling in PROMETHEUSand\nparametric evaluations completed to approximate these effects. Additional cycles of modeling\nimprevements/paramettlc variations continued until correlation with actual test datawas achieved.\n\nP\n\n!t\n\nThe resulting modeling changes to PROMI_I\'HEUS were quite extensive; so much so that the\ncorrelated model was renamed PROMETHEUS llI. Figure D-3.9 smnmarizes the parametric\nvariation_ und modeling changes required to achieve calibration.\nAfter calibration, an independent test case was simulated with PROMI_\'THEUS,producing good\nagreement with actual test results involving a real Part 572 dummy in sled testing. Figure D-3.10\nindicates the correlation finally achieved.\nReview of Occupant Simuintion Computer Programs\nThree occupant-simulation models are reviewed in following paragraphs, These consist of a onedimensional model (the spring-mass model auociated with the Dynamic Response Index (DILl),and\nacomparison of a two-dimensional model (PROMETHEUSIH)and, a three-dimensional model (SOMLA).\nThe models ere examined from two viewpoints -- first, as a tool for engineering design of a\nseat/restraint system, and second as a passible candidate for integration into a large structural\ndynamics simulation computer program in order to model the complete system (aircraft, seat and\noccupant) in a single simulation.\nOne-Dimensional Model _DR[) -- A one degree of freedom dynamic-response model of a human\noccupant has been proposed (ref. D-5). The model consists of a simple linear spring and damper,\nand a point mass. The spring is sized by the compressive stiffness of the lumbar vertebrae and the\ndamper is sized by human vibration tests.\nThe DR[ is an injury scale associated with this model. The DRI for a deceleration pulse is the ratio of\nthe peak compressive spring force which occurs when the model is excited by the pulse to the\nweight of the point mass. To associate tolerance levels with the DRI, the DRI was calculated for\nexisting ejection seat designs. The computed DR[ values were plotted against the percentage of\nejections in which spinal injury occurred; the curve thus obtained represents an approximation of\ninjury probability as a function of DR[.\nBoth the simple occupant model on which the DR[ is based and the DR[ itself are very limited in\napplication:the simple model could only be used for cases in which the loading is purely vertical, that\nis\nz such as in ejection seats. It is obviously not applicable to model a restrained occupant under\nforward loads\', in this ease the main effect is the combined stiffness of the restraint system and the\noccupant\'s pelvis/cheat. Even for +G z acceleration the model is difficult to use since potentially\nsignificant effects, such as the effect of seat pan stiffness, are neglected.\nThe DRI is based on a model which does not adhere closely to the actual dynamic8 of an ejection.\nThe seat pan stiffness is not considered, nor is the distribution of body mass along the spine or the\nweight of the occupant. Thus, the DRI can be expected to produce useful data only in crashes which\nare pretty much like a seat ejection-- that is purely + Gz acceleration, seat pan stiffness similar to the\nstiffness of a fighter pilot\'s seat and the occupant strapped tightly in.\nThe Army (;rash Survival Design Guide says of the DRI:\n"Although the Dymnaie Response Index (DRI) ... is the only model correlated extensively for\neje_tion seat spinal injury prediction, it has serious shortcomings for use in accident analysis. It\nassumes the occupant to be well restrained and erect, so that the loading is primarily\ncompressive, with insignificant bending.

Consequently, the DRI is not\nrecommended as the criterion for use in designing crashworthy scats."\nReviewof Two-DimeosionalandThre_Dimensional Occupant Simulation Computer Programs -- The\nfollowing discussion reviews end compares the two-dimensional program PROMETHEUS HI\n(ref. D-8) and the three-dimensional seat,occupant model -- light oircraft (SOM.LA) (ref. D-7).\nPROMETHEUS III was developed at Boeing in a series of applications for varied purposes, starting\nfl_m the Dynamic Science program,SIMULA. The focus of the moat recent, PROMETHEUS HI, has\nbeen on accurate modeling of the occupant and restraint system. PROMETHEUS IH has since been\nused extensively to develop data for assisting in engineering design decisions.\n8OM-LA development was apommred by the Federal Aviation Agency through a series of contracte\nwith various companies and universities. The emphasis in SOM-LA development has been on the\ndetailed seat model. A new version of SOM-LA, termed MSOM-LA was completed under number\nDTFA03-80-C-00098. The occupant model has been upgraded in MSOM.LA.\nDevelopment of Basis of Evaluation -- Boeing is one of very few places that an occupant\nsimulation computer program (PROMETHEUS HI) has been developed and demonstrated\nsufficiently to be used as a trade-off tool in the engineering design procem. This experience is\ndrawn upon to establish criteria for continued evaluation of occupant-simulation computer\nprograms .......\nThe design questions for which PROMETHEUS ITI simulations were employed to provide\nengineering data were quite varied; the common denominator was that all questions related to\nrelative occupant safety. Of course, and due in part to the limitations of exmting haman tolerance\ndate, it is rarely pouible to predict with certainty whether injury would have occurred in a given\ncrash on the basis of a computer simulatio.n: _\nqnestio na may also be unanswered in dummy\ntests. However, in most cases, computer simulation is the only practical method for obtaining\ntrade-off date for specific questions, and on a timely basis.\nTo be usable for this sort of design question, an o_cupant.simulation computer program requires_..................\n\ntwo majorattributes,\nbetween the be able to model a very general structure (not just a seat), and of an occupant contact\nFirst it must occupant and any part of the structure. {Forexample, impact be able to modelwith the\nseat ahead),\n\nil\n1_\nij\n\nThe second feature is that the program must provide data which may be used for estimation of\ncomparative injury potential. This means that:\n\n!\n\n1.\n\nThe program must have been calibrated by predicting to test data (preferal_,iyfrom live human\ntests or from dummies demonstrating at least partial correlation with t,uman data).\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n194\n\nTime-histories of foro_ acting on individual body scgrnente of the occupant model should be\nprintoutand/ur charted,\nTime-histories of torques acting in joints of the occupant (e.g., the elbow) should also be\nprinted and/er charted.\n\n\'1\n\n!\n\n4.\n\nThne varying interualloads acting on flexible I_-xiyaegm{;nte (such as the hunl_tr spine) should\nb_,printed and/or charted.\n\nOf course, the standard software features relating to caw. of program use arc also desirabk_ -- that\nis, case of input, automatic data checking, legibility of output, and availability of graphic aids.\ne\n\nComparative Evaluation of PROMETHEUS llI and SOM-LA -- Figures D.3,11, D.3.12, and I)-3.13\ncenstitute eheeldieta of featttroa needed for engineering design usage of occupant-simulation\ncomputer programB, Checklist items were obtained pragmatically from experience in using\nPROMETHEUS[] to develop dmign trade-off date, The amount of use of PROMb.WHEUS justified\n[]\nincorperation of meet cbeckl_t items into PROMETHEUSllI; consequently the lists serve mainly to\nindicate desirable improvemants in SOM-LA.An improvedversion of SOM-LAis ne._ed MSOM-LA.\nThe main improvement in the new model is an improved seat model which is capable of modeling\nenergy absarptian. The occupant model has also been improved by the incorporation of a flexible\nsegment representing the lumbar spine.\n\nrI\n\nThe major deficiency in PROMETHEUS [] i8 that it has only been possible to perform limited,\nexploratorycalibrationagainst live human tset data and for similar reasons limited exploration of seat\nmodel dyusmice. Added calibration of this type is desirable. A benefit is that mechanisms within the\ntwo-dimensional PROMETHEUS [] model are easier to comprehend than those within a threedimensional model, giving an added plus for initial use of a two-dimensional model in calibration\nefforts. Other than development which may be required to achieve such calibration, further model\nevolution must consider limitations intrinsic to the two-dimensional nature of the model and\ndistinguish the conditions for using a 2-D or a 3-D model. Of course, current uncertainties in the level\nof human tolerance to transient loads are a constraint that must be observed for either 2-D or\n3-D models.\nSOM-LA could benefit from beth human data calibration and model improvement (from the\nstandpoint of usefulness for engineering design), There are two major modeling deficiencies -- the\nrestraint system modal and the difficulty of modeling nonstandard seats and structure. Both\nrepresent difficult modeling problems in a throe-dimensional environment, and the methods\ndeveloped to simulate these features in the two-dimensional PROMETHEUS III computer program\ndo not readily generalize to three dimensions.\n\n: _-\n\n_,b\n!m._\'"\n\n_-\n\nAccordingly, thie simple restraint system model is inadequate for engineering design use for\nevaluating restraint system pedormance. It introduces uncertainty into the accuracy of predicted\nbody loads and acceleratione, since the dynamic performance of the restraint system is one of the\nprimary sources and conduits of transmisainn of crash loads to the occupant.\nThe ,_cund major $OM.LA deficiency is the limited seat structural configurations which may be\nsimulated. It is possible that more generality is available in MSOM-LA. In addition, it is desirable\n\n\xe2\x80\xa21,\n_\n\nSOM.LA has a very primitive restraint system model, The restraining belts are pinned to the body,\nse realistic modeling of a restrained occupant is impossible. SOM-LAalso has limited flexibility in\nthe type of restraint system which may be modeled. Nonstandard configurations, such as restraint\nsystem with crotch or thigh at.raps could not be simulated, In addition, harnese friction is\nimplemented incorrectly (friction is crudely eLnd\nincorrectly simulated by reducing the tension in\nthe strap segment rUaning from the lap belt to the shoulder by 12%). Another serious defect is\nthat cheat compressibility (which offecte ehoulder harness loads) is not modeled.\n\ni\n\nthat MSOM-LAbe the seat of simulating contactelement "contact problem" andifficult and is the\n(e.g., the baals of capable ahead). _\nfinite between the occupant and is arbitrary structure\nsubject of current research (e,g., referenC\'eD-8).\n\n..........\n\n.\n\n.........\n\n195\n\n,\n\nt\n\n_\'\n\n___R__RR_m__Z__\n\n_\n\nFEATURE\n\nPROMETHEUSIll\n\nSOM-L____.AA MSOM-LA\n\n-C \'o )\n\n-\n\nI\n\nSegmentmasses, length,\ninertias,c.g.\'s.\nOccupant\nMechanicalproperties\nof joints\n\nI,D\n\nI,D\n\nI,D\n\nI,D\n\nD\n\nD\n\nI,D\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI,D\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIll Seat\nGeometry\nConstruction\nMechanicalProperties\n\nI,D\nI,D\nI,O\n\nI\nD\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nIV\n\nCrash Pulse\n\nI,O\n\nI\n\nI\n\nVI\n\nInteractive(Conversational) X\ninput feature\n\n-\n\n-\n\nI\n\nII\n\nRestraint System\nMechanicalpropertiesof\nlap belt\nMechanicalproperties\nof harness\n\nI \xe2\x80\xa2 Input, D = Default (i.e., suppliedby program)\nNote I:\n\n_\n\nIt is assumed that the MSOM-LA input is essentiallythe same\nas the SOM-LA input.\n_\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ni\n\n2\n\n_ZB\n\nB\n\n_Si_SaB_ZSiSaI_\n\nFigure D-3.11 - Comparisonof ProgramInput Features\n\n196\n\n_Z_\n\n2m\n\n_\n\n_\n\nFEATUR_.__E\n\nI\n\nPROMETHEUS Ill\n\nOccupant\nSeqment cartesionposition,X\nvelocity,acceleration\nSeamRnt anqularposition, X\nvelocit.v_cceleration\na\nForces on segments\nX\nJoint Torques\nX\nSpinal Loads\nX\n\nSOM-L___AA MSOM-LA\n\nX\n\nX\n\nII RestraintSystem\nLap Belt Load\nHarness Load\nBelt Slip\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n-\n\nIll Seat\nCushion Forces\nReactions\nNodal Forces\nElement Forces\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n-\n\nIV\n\nCrash Pulse\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nV\n\nPrinter Plots\nAccelerationTraces\nX\n(vs time)\nSnapshotsof Victim/Seat\nX\nLocus of Segment c.g.\'$ as Functionsof Time .......\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nNote I:\n\nIt is assumed that the output features of SOM-LA and MSOM-LA\nare essentiallythe same.\n\nFigureD.3,12 - Comparisonof Program Output Features\n\n197\n\nFEATURE\n\nI\n\n_\nII\n_:\n\ni_\'-\n\nPROMETHEUS Ill\n\nOccupant\nSpinal Articulation\nS links\nFlexible Lumbar Link\nX\nFlexible Cervical Link\nX\nAutomatic InitialPosition X\nGeneration\nCompressibleChest, pelvis, X\nRestraint System\nRealisticfriction\nFree to slide on victim\nWebbing Stretch\n\n_-_\n\nIII Seat\nFinite ElementModel\nBar Elements\nBeam Elements\nPlate Elements\nNo. of elements in typical\nseat model\nCushion\nEnergy Absorption\nAircraft InteriorModeled\n\nI\n\nIV\n\n_\ni.._.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n,_\nV\nLIP\n_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCrash Pulse\nTranslationComponents\nRotationalComponents\nCalibrationaqainst\nexperiment\nAnthropomorphic\nDummy\nLive Human\n\nSOM-LA\n\nMSOM-LA\n\n4 links\nX\nX\n\n5 links\nX\nX\nX\n\n-\n\n-\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n6*\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n60\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n60\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX**\n-\n\nX\nX**\n-\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n***\n\n***\n-\n\n,\n\n***\n-\n\nX CapabilityAvailable\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGrowth Available\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\n\nAccordingto the SOM-LA developer,Dr. David Laananen,this feature\ndoes not work in SOM-LA but does in MSOM-LA.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2** Preliminarycalibrationaccomplished,\n\n-I\n\ni\nI\n\nFigure D-3.13- Comparisonof Basic Modeling Features\n\n19H\n\nP\n\ni\nd\n\ni\n\n\'\n\nhI additiou to th,,m\' rom_an\'h itl_provoaa+l|ta, m_vol\'al atraightforward\njlII[H\'_IV(qlIOII|a\n\nt\n\nI.\n\nw(lll](I\n\natlzd rather (,any a_fft.waro\n\nII_lhility o[ _.hoc\'oth,;\ntilii\xc2\xa2.|lill(orios ill\' IoadM ll\xc2\xa2thlg oil tho ix\'Ctlllllllt (_!.g., sllhlal\n\n(11ilial|(\'(_\n\n(_lih\'llht((\' and di,lday\n\n_OIIdS,\n\nf\n_\n\nI,R,_lln_llt\n\nftW(\'o_l,\n\n\'_.\n\n|tII|WOVO\n\nthO algarithln\n\njOint\n\ntol\'l|llos},\n\n3.\n\nAdd printt,r I hit s I tt ahola of so it md tit ( up I it far Ipl ni |sing oct\'up nit Io" it it a it at It i It d\ntimes ItWo viowa) for n_a|imn and i+_al_blc comparimm with s|ow motimi movies.\n\nfor\n\noolnputal_oll\n\nill\n\njoillt\n\ntOl\'l|lt(_\n\nIn\n\nincorporation\n\nof SOM-I,A\n\ninto l_+rgo Crash Dynmuic.\n\nCoda\n\nIR\'t\'(\'+lbl.o\nI\'VIt) at\'quiro or predict tlymmt c intor wthms tlf t_\'oupant iintl floor, Simple\nim_lictio, m may llt\'t\'Ottttl\nby imaaiblc with SOM.I.A.

D-3}. These anthorl reference conditions where injuries have occurred in mine\nparticular csws as a basis for avoidance. Rel_rted are bases for Head Injury CriWria (lllC)\n(recomn_cnded), end DRI for spinal injury criteria (not\nrecommemled, see "Evaluation Techniques",\n\n2o I\n\npage to cunm).In the Guide, leg injury criteria are established at 2000 lh for tinw less than 20 masc.\n"Although some reseawh has been candueted on the tolerance of other body purta, such ns the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, well defined valid criteria have not beeu established." Variations in leg\ninjury date presented in the Guide illustrate tlio point. Additionally, numerous related literature\nreviews have been conducted. Results from _m Aerospace Industry As_)ciation Study by the\nTralteport Airworthy Requiremante Committee (AIA-TARC Study, ref. D-3) are repezt_d in Figure\nD-4.2 for information purposss.\nActually, data regarding human tolerance to impact still leaves many areas for uncertainty and\ndisagreenmnte. One obvious difficulty is that stre_dng the live human body to tolerance limits is\nimpossible. Testa with volunteers are necessarily at eubcxitical levels. Accordingly, animal research\nhas provided much of the data that is used, Additionally, human cadavers have been used as test\nspeeimens. However, age, sex and state of health for live people (and for cadavers) can influence\ntolerance. Additionally, mathematical models and anthrepometric dummies are being used to\ndevelop better undemtanding of the kinematics and forces involved and to develop an improved\nmechanism for injury prediction,\nOverallprobability of survival dependsto a large extent on manner of restraint, particularly to cuntrel\nthe upper and lower torso and protect the head and chest. Strongest restraint load points for such\ncontrol are the pelvic girdle, the shoulder structure, and the rib cage. Restraint effectiveneSs is\nrelated to contact ares and force distribution, the body location for application, and the degree to\nwhich residual movement is controlled. However, protecting the arms and leg_ from contacting the\ninterior during flailing is concluded by authors of the Guide to be extremely difficult; in most cases,\nthe cocoon that would be required to produce such containment is quite impractical. Another\nproblem is caused by 1oo_ restraint, which contributes to magnified accelerative forces. The abrupt\nhalt in forward occopant motion with the taking up of the slack in restraint then magnifies restraint\nloads on the body and on the hardware -- s condition called dynamic overshoot.\nThe authors of the new Guide indicate that their main areas of concern for coufigurations featuring\nonly s lap belt ave the potential for head injury and the potential for submarining. They urge use of a\nshoulder harness in addition to the belt as a favored 8ulution, although it is recognized that\nconnecting the harneSs to the belt buckle will pull it up and increase potential for submarining -which could load up the abdominul wall as well as flexing the spinal column. To counter this potential,\na lap-belt tiedown is recommanded by the authors of the Guide, and is actually tu_d by all services,\nCOMMENT:In a survey conducted for the TARC 216-10 study, leading eaperte in the field were\nspecifically questioned about this, with none reporting to have observed submarining when only the\nlap belt (without shoulder harness) was used. Trade-ells of belt.harne_ characteristics will be\npresented in a later paragraph,\nb\n\nWHOLE-BODY ACCELERATION TOLHRANCE\nThe Guide \xe2\x80\xa2uther6 emphasize a fact that is seldom diseusz_d. Whole-body chest-to-back tolerance\nhas been demonstrated to be as muc\'o as 45 G for pulse durations leSs than 0.044 sec. This\ndecreases to 25 G for 0.2 see.

Lateral\ndisplacement of the upper torso may be extensive, even with a shoulder harness. However, clearing\nthe strike zone of etrueturul patti may not be feasible.

Early\ndummies developed in 1949 have progreseed through several evolutions to a standardized, more\nsophisticated dummy specified for the Federal Motor Vehical Standards (Part 572) by the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, Several more recent desil.,mshave emerged, all with the\nobjective of improving dummy response and repeatibility of performances. Some comparison of\ndummy and cadaver response has been accomplished, Comparison testa of dummy designs have\nbeen produced, demonstrating among other things that complex dummies increa_ the number of\ntest variables to a level that may exceed experimenter ability to control the variables or understand\nthe interactions in results.\n\n2O8\n\n5.0 AIRCRAFT SEATS, RESTRAINTS, LITTERS AND PADDING\nThis section of the Guide commences by emphasizing the subsystems that interface with\noccupant_, (including the controls as well as seats, restraints, litters and padding) and also the\nbasic operational differences between crew soar- and passenger seat& It distinguishes between\npassenger seats and litters for transport and crew seats, emphasizing that the crew\'s functional\nrequirement and operational responsibilities are "of highest priority" while maintaining that\ncomparable "crashworthinese" protection is needed.\n,\n\nBACKGROUND DISCUSSION\nIntroductory comments in the Guide express the position that a complete systems approach must be\nemployed to include all influencing parameters, including economic restraint, concerned with the\ndesign, manufacture and over\'all l:arformance of the aircraft in meeting nfission requirements.\nHowever, an accumulative systems capability to protect or absorb energy is disallowed; maximum\ncapability from each component is emphasized.\nThe intent of this section is to define nfinimmn crash energy absorption "requirements" for seats\nand restraint systems. Specified strength requirements are based on the crash environments\nadopted in the Army guide update, as are test requirements.\nCOMMENT: The seat desig\'l requirements stated in the Guide are based on the extreme crash\nloads postulated to occur in the \'_95th percentile survivable Army light aircraft crash." No\nrecognition is given to the drastic differences in peak leads from the 95th to the 90th percentile\nwhich suggest that the 95th percentile used in the Guide may deviate so far from the normal (and\nimplied) use of such statistics as to be unreelistieaUy and excessively high as a criteria. Other\nguidelines are also influenced by the assumed load levels. The Guide strongly euggeete that seats\nshould be designed with a vertical energy absorbing stroke to mitigate the assumed high vertical\nloads; little discussion is given to interaction between vertical and other dimensions during the\nstroke. Better understanding of the influence and means of controlling such interacting\nparameters is needed.\nSEAT INSTALLATIONS\nPer military specification, "each seat occupant is to be provided with a survivable environment\nwheit the aircraft is subjected to a 95th percentile potentially survivable impact." This will require\nenergy absorption and maintellanee of "un.intruded" living space to avoid debilitating injury that\nmight preclude timely egress after crash impact. Candidate methods are many; sufficient\nabsorption by landing gear and structure could leave little requirement for energy absorption in\nthe seat. The converse also holds, requiring a long seat stroke. Restraint design loads transmitted\nthrough the seat to the structure are another variable.\n,\n\n"\n\nVertical energy absorption is mandatory in Army sire:aft seat component specifications because\nlanding gear also might fail; a 12.in. minimum stroke ie recommended, but may be precluded by\ndesired positioning of the seat within the aircraft.\nCOMMENT:The objective correlates with a total airplane objective but continues to leave questions\nregardingststietica]Jy tmuaualand dramatic differences between 90% versus 95%. It does not provide\nassurance that these "whole bodf loads define seat loads, and leaves in doubt the accumulative\neffect of such elements ae slack or mispesitioned harness which may be beyond rite control of the\ndesigner,\n\n2O9\n\ni*\n\nPRIMARY DESIGN CGNSIDI,_RATIONS\nPrim_lT design eLmeiderstlons for protection include the design t_fthe seats to be retained iu positiou\nf\n\n_\n\nL\n\nand u_eof ea integral means term intcrpre_d by the present reviewer to mean padded, frangible,\nshould be "delethali_d ", s of crash load attenuation, Additionally, the o_cupm_t\'estrike _;nvelope\nand/or ductile or otherwise designed so as to aid in the proventio_ of serious injury.

Additionally, "the seat should provide an integral\n\nI.\n\nmeans of crash load attenuation and the occupant\'s strike envelope should be delethalized."\nSeat comfort is considered a pilot\'s safety-of-flight factor, reducing potential for pilot fatigue in a\nshort time period, rather than a crash safety deaign factor. Pilot comfort "must not be unduly\ncompromised to achieve crash safety. _Back angles over 13\xc2\xb0 and thigh tangent angles 5 to 20 \xc2\xb0 are\nrecommended in the Guide.

According!y, to Some extent, a design may reflect trsde-offs related to the unique\napplication.\n\ni\n\ni\n_\n\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR SEATS\nThe Guide authors point out that seats face any direction, and that forward facing is most\ncommon, but prefer aftwurd facing. Aft facing seats provide "maximum contact area and support."\nFor forward facing flight deck seats, the authors also recommend a lap-belt tiedown (crotch) strap\nfor flight crewmen and consider lap-belt-only restraint undesirable; beth upper and lower torso\nrestraints sre recommended. They consider aide-facing seats least desirable but suggest that when\nside-facing seats are used, an upper torso restraint resisting forward motion is needed. Ductile\nmaterial- (for energy absorption) featuring at least 10% elongation are recommended for all\ncritical members in the primary load paths of nonload limited seats, and featuring at least 5%\nelongation for [oadlimito_ seats).\nSeata\nFor Army purpose, Guide authors state single occupant seats are preferred in order to avoid\ncomplicated energy absorbing situations that may occur for multiudt seats that are not fully\noccupied. Guide authors considered it desirable that aU seats face in the _ame direction to protect\noccupant_ from loose equipment,\n\nt\n\nAftward facing seats wore preferred when practical, to "maalmally distribute body contact area."\nForward facing seats wars considered to afford "adcquat_ protection by the use of a restraint\nsystem consisting of shoulder strap,, a lap-belt and a lal_be|t ttedown (crotch) strap." The authors\nconsider lap.belt-only restraints undesirable.\nCOMMENT:Many eyatsnm accept this configuration with an ener_ absorbing surrounding area.\nForward facing seats with adequate reatraints are acceptable as a second choice to aftward faci-.g\nseats. When single diagonal upper torso rcetruint is used, it should pass over the nuthoard _hn_ddsr\nto contain lateral impact or protrusion outside the aircraft.\nPrevious side facing seats were provided with lap-beLt reetxuint only. This arrungemertt was\nconsidered by Guide authors to be inadequate, and least desirable from the crash safety\nstandpoint; however "when no reasonable alternative to their use exists, adequate restraint must\nbe provided. If a single, diagonal upper torso restrain|; in used, it should be placed aver the forward\nfacing shoulder" (relative to the aircraft).\nShoulder harness provides minimal protection to abrupt acceleration in the side facing\nconfiguration. Lateral torso movement should be minimized or prevented.\nLitters\nThe supine position that litters provide is ideal for .,_smting vertical impacts. The supine position\nallows maximum possible contact area and force distribution, and forc_ are transverse to body.\nLateral installation should be provided. It would prevent.body from sliding off the litter\nlongitudinally, and _rovents the litter from sliding and/or repositinning to become completely\ndetached from supports.\nSTRUCTURAL CONNECTIONS\nSeat Attachment -- Cockpit seats are floor or bulkhead mounted. Cabin interior seats may be: (1)\nsuspended from the ceiling with energy atmorberaand wall atsb\'flJsed,(2) suspended from the coiling\nwith energy absorbers and floor stab\'dized, (3) wall mounted with energy absorbers, (4) floor\nmou_t,._l with energy absorbers, or (5) ceiling and floor mounted (vertical energy absorbers\nabeveund below the _aO,\nSuspension or mounting of all seats should not interfere with rapid ingre_ or egress.\n\n,\n\nHardware Materials -- Material selected for attachment of webbing should be ductile enough to\ndeform locally, particularly at stress concentration points. This ducti_ty is not as critical when\nenergy absorbing provisions are incorporated into the seat. On the other hand, consistent use of\nductile materials avoids the poesibillty of non ductile materiak on nonloed limited seats. Selection\nof materials should emphasize:\n1.\n\nBest strength-to.weight ratiea\n\n2.\n\nMaintaining ductility to prevent brittle fuilurse\n\n3.\n\nStandard elastic anulysigselection methods for most working life conditions\n\n4.\n\nBehavior beyond the yield point analysed for ensr_T abeorptiou purposes.\n\n211\n\n.............\n\nRESTRAINT SYSTEMS\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR PERSONNEL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS\nStatistics on U.S. Army aircraft accidents indicate failure of personnel reetraint harness us a frequent\ncause of injuries and fatalities. From Volumes I and III of the Guide, a crasilworthy aircraft is to\n"eliminate unnecessary injuries and fatalities in relatively mild impacts." However, Volume III also\nstates in a different context that the Army goal for scat end restraint systems is to "reduce occupant\ndecelerative loading to within human tolerance limite," that "ideally ... structure should minimize\noccupant accelerations to survivable levels in a severe crash environment." In other wmzls, Army\npolicies in establishing design principles for personnel restraint systems are to prevent injury to all\noccupants ill crash conditions approaching the upper limits of survivability.\nBelt and crotch strap remain the standard for U.S. Army flight crews by recommendation of the\nauthors of the updated guide (crotch straps are to oppose harness loads on the belt). Troop and\npa_enger requirements were different; the most recommended system was an inertial harness\nover each shoulder connecting to a centar-body lap-belt buckle, and secondly, a system with a\ndiagonal shoulder-to-belt anchor strap positioned to restrain the occupant from protruding outaide\ntheaircraft\nduring\nlateral\nloadingsimilar\n(\ntoautomotive\nsystems).\nInflatable\nrestraint andharness\nbelt\nweredescribed morecomplex\nasa\nandcostly\nalternative\nthat\nwill\nreduce\nrestraint\nslack automatically\nby\nprotensioning\nthecystemtobetter\ncontrclmpact\ni\nresponse.\nAnotherrelated\ninflatable\nalternative bags,\nisair\nwhichareconspicuous\nintheirbsence\na\nfromGuidediscussions.\nNumeroushuman bodyrestraint\nmethodshavebeenproposed,\ninvestigated\nand/orsed;\nu\nsomeare\n"exceptionally others\ngood",\n"left\nmuch tobedesired."\nDesirable\nqualities\nare:\nI.\n\nComfortable\nlighteight\nw\n\n2.- Easytoputon andremoveeveninthedark\n3.\n\nFeature aingle-point\na\nrelease\neasily\noperateditheitherand,and protected\nw\nh\nfrominadvertent\nrelease, being\ne.g.,\nstruck\n\n4.\n\nProvide\nfreedom\nofmovement tooperateheaircraft\nt\ncontrols, through\ne.g.,\ntheuseofan inertia\nreel\nwiththeshoulder\nharness\n\n5.\n\nProvide sufficient restraint in all directions to prevent injury in a potentially survivable crash\n\n6.\n\nWebbing should provide a maximum area, consistent with weight and comfort, for force\ndistribution in the upper torso and pelvic regions and should be of low elongation under load to\nminimize dynamic overshoot.\n\nm_\n\nmm\n\nR__\n_\n\nGENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA\nGeneral\ndesign\ncriteria\nareasfollows:\n\n_i\n--_;\n....\n\n212\n\n1,\n\nComfert should net be unduly compromised by crash survival systems or impr_per adjostment by\nu_ers is a likely outCome.

An improved lateral restraint\nsystem is illustrated in (b). which adds more shoulder restraint against sideways motion. In (e), a\ncrew chief/gunner restraint system provides for ability to move out of the seat but be instantly\nrestrained when he returns. Treoplpasscnger systems are illustrated in (d). An automatically\ninflatable system is illustrated in (e); this one automatically pretensions to force tile occupant back\ninto his seat and eliminates potential for looseness and extended dynamic response,\ne.g., overshoot,\nRESTRAINT ANCHORS\nLap-Belt Anchorage\nLap-belt anchors may be on the seat bucket or on aircraft stxueture. Structural mounting must\nassure that the restraint remains effective regardless of seat position. Structural attachment will\nnot be practical when the seat includes longitudinal load limiting. Lap-belt anchor location is also\nconsidered a comfort factor; locating it too far forward interferes with movement of the legs. Thin\nis considered important for pilots but not important to pa_engern since they are not required to\nperform operations with their legs.\nBy Army practice, submarining is considered to be prevented by a lupbelt tie down strap, by\nlocating the belt so its eentorline fulls \'2 to 2.25 in. forward of the seat reference point, and/or by\nassuring that the angle between the lap belt eentorline and tile buttock reference line is at least\n45 \xc2\xb0 (but not exceeding 55\xc2\xb0) for u 50th percentile occupant (fig. D-5.2), The 45 to 55" l_ngle has\npriority over the 2 to 2.25 in, location dimension. Sub:aarining can also be reduced by ensuring\nthat the lap belt is tight.\nCOMMENT:Data on which these conclusions are based appear to b_,twofnld.

(Such data were for a horizontal seat pan and a vertical seat back.)\ncontrolled over a wider range than had been presumed as indicated by belt slip and pelvis rotation\nThe TARC study also indicated that s_\'atconfiguration (i.e., pan angle and back angle) influences\nrestraint system performance. Figure D.5.5 illustrates the variation in performance with a\n"4-anchor" system as the seat pan and back angles are systematically altered through a range\nof settings.\nThe TARC study also showed that changing restraint system design can have a marked influence\non restraint system effectiveness. Figure D-5.6 illustrates the change in retention perfnrmanee\nwith different restraint systems configurations. As illustrated, alternative configurations can\nprovide marked retention improvements with no change in anchorage and no significant penalties,\nLap-Belt Tiedown (Crotch) Strap Anchorage\nThis strap is to prevent ride-up of the belt when u_vd. It should intercept the seat pan conterline\n14 to 15 in. forward of the seat back,\nADJUSTMENT HARDWARE\nAdjusters are to carry the full design load of the subassembly of which they arc part, without\nslipping or crushing webbing. Required adjustment force should not exceed 30 ]b. Adjusters are\nnot to be located over skeletal hard points (ilise crest of pelvis, collar bones).\nDELETHALIZATION OF COCKPIT AND CABIN INTERIORS\n\n-"\n_\'\n\nThe main purpose of "delethali_tion" is to minimize potential for injuries that jeopardize\nemergency evacuation. The kinematics of body action aseo_iatod with aircraft crash impacts can be\nviolent, including flailing of body parts. The Army position is that this is rowers with only a lap\nbelt as the restraint, but mnltidireetianal flailing is still extensive with a ]ap.beltlshouhler\nharness combination.\n\n!\n218\n\n]\n1\n]\n\np,\nii i\n\n,,\n\n:! ! i-i I,\n\nr\n\n1\ng\n\n[\n\n,, :\n\n!!!!\n\n", llt!i\n\noo0\n\nZ o.\n\ni_\n:\n\n"\'_<I\n\n,,.\n_I\n\nII\n\n!\n-..I-I\n\n,,,o._ :..._.\n\n".\'\n\n__.,. ,. .. , .\n;\n,.\n,\n\n=_oiiii!iI\n\n_,: i, _. : L.. _\n.\'_\'_; :_\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n0=_\'"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n.\n\n_\n\nE\n_%\n\n-"\n\n.\n221\n\nCOMMI,_\'NT:\nThere is little evidence that sm;h dramatic multidimensional and injurious flailing of\nthe limbs m_cursin largo can]inertial airplanes, Report_ suggest that if it occurs most such action\nappears to be allied with the primary impact loading m the fore-and-aft direction, since there is\nlittle cartwheeling or largo lateral acceleration evidenced in largo aircraft impact,\nThe occupsntg immediate environment ahunld be designed so that injury potential ls minimized if the\nbody parts flail and contact rigid or semirigid atxucturoa in tile immediate environment.

The first\nalternative could involve excessive strength (and weight) requirements to accommodate dynamic\novershoot factors of 1.2 to 2.0 (i,e., load factors to twice as large as design loads). The second\nusing controlled collapsing behaviors offers a more practical approach. It does offer the capability to\nbetter control force levels relative to human tolerances. Of course, neither approach is totally\nachievable.\nCOMMENT:Ultimately, design for any approach will be exceeded; there is no way to assure ultimate\nsurvivability. Even the selection of a 95th percentile crash was based on recognition of this fact.\nNevertheless, wording frequently overlooks this fact.\nCRASH ENERGY ABSORPTION\nDuring crash loads, the occupant\'s center of gravity acquires a distinct velocity relative to the\nairframe. Maximum relative velocity may become large. In turn, the seat must sustain the applied\nloads or possess sufficient energy abeorptiun capability to reduce the occupant\'s relative velocity\nbefore atrnctural failure oreurs. The Guide emphasizes the desire to obtain the greatest energy\nabsorbing stroke from the seat (for Army conditions with widely varied impact loads). This\nreceives independent emphasis without regard to energy abserptiun from other system elements.\nIncreasing occupant stepping distance during a crash can reduce impact loads and thus improve\ntolerebility levels for imposed decelerations. Methods include:\n1.\n\nAdditional crushable airframe structure\n\n2.\n\nEnergy-absorbing landing gear\n\n3.\n\nSeat design with energy absorbing mechanism(s)\nseat collapse)\n\n4.\n\nA combination of the above\n\n(e.g., load limiting\n\nor controlled\n\nCommon ndscunceptiuna exist; related commen_ are:\n1.\n\n222\n\nThe seat energy-absorbing system does not absorb all the energy associated with the\nimpact velocity.\n\n::\n\n2.\n\nThe first comment also explains why slack in the restraint system or _t attachments is\nundesirable;added stroking to eceom,nedatelarger relative velocity will be required to\ndecelerate the occupant,\n\n3.\n\nThe seat energy absorbing stroke simply lengthens the stopping distance of the occupant by\nallowing the seat to stroke as other energy absorbing processes are nearing completion,\n\n4,\n\nDisregarding dynamic rseponse differences, the same stroke distance is required to\ndecelerate any mass at a given deceleration magnitude, Therefore, lighter people do not\nrequire shorter strokes than heavier people (however, a different energy absorption\ncl,arecteristic is required),\n\n\'\n\nCOMMENT: Stroking must occur in such a way as to minimise the possibility of entrngment.\nENERGY ABSORBING REQUIREMF_T8\n\nFOR COCKPIT AND CABIN INTERIORS\n\nTwo categories of head impact injury are of primary concern--skull fracture with potential brain\ndamage, and facial ti_ue and bone structure injury with lesser probsbflity d brain damage.\nPenetration by protruding objects is also of concern, Trauma from intercrenial lesions is mentioned,\nbut without criteria other than to reduce level of acceleration, rate of onset and amount of energy\ntransmitted to the head.\nThe Army pasition is that "acceleration experienced during secondary impacts of the occupant\nwith the surrounding structures must be reduced to a tolerable level." Padding material should\nboth reduce the deceleretive force and distribute the load for uniform pressure, Candidates for\nenergy absorbing include instrument panels, glarechielde, other interior surfaces within the strike\nzone, and seat cushions.\nEmpirical System Response -- Theoretical und empirical information is presented on dynamic\nenergy absorbing response, on empirical development of ereshworthy armored seats, and on load\nlindt devices. Extensive discu_ion is not warranted for this abstracting summary. (A much\nsimpler calculation method based un handbook data is presented in the appendix D-A to this\npresent report),\nENERGY ABSORBING DEVICES\nAs eumm_\nfor the Guide, a multitude of devices for al_serbing energy have been proposed,\ndeveloped and tested. Desirable features of such devices are:\n1.\n2.\n\nThe rapid loading rate expected in crashes should not cause unexpected changes in the forceversus, deformation characteristic of the device.\n\n3.\n\nThe assembly in which the device is used should have the ability to sustain tension and\ncompression. (This might be provided by one or more energy absorbers, or by the basic\nstructure itself, depending on the system design).\n\n4.\n\nThe device should be us light end small as possible.\n\n5.\n\ni\n[\n\nThe device should provide a predictable foree-vemtwdeformatiun trace.\n\nThe Specific Energy Ahserption (SEA) should be high.\n\n223\n\n6.\n\nThe device should be economical.\n\n7.\n\nTile device should bc capable of being relied upon to perfi_rm aatisfaet_wily througb_mt the\nlife of the aircraft (for Army, a miaimual of 10 years or 8000 flight hours) without requiring\nmaintenance.\n\n8,\n\nThe device should act be affected by vibration, dust, dirt, or other environment effects, It\nshould be proteeWd from corrosion.\n\n9.\n\nThe device(a) should decelerate the occupant in the most efficient manner possible while\nmaintaining the loading environment withiL _te limits of human tolerance.\n\nI\n\nNumerous load limiters have been devised, The concepts are illustrated and described in figure\nD-5,7, Body decelerations tend to normalize near the G level corresponding to the limit load factor of\nthe energy absorb/rig device. An optimum device cannot be selected for all apl.,licatious on the basis\nof available data. Rather, the data of the figure presents concepts end guidel_.nes which can be\nconsidered relative to specific applications.\nSEAT STRENGTH AND DEFORMATION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nDesign should be based on typical weight of the occupant, not the extreme we:,ght, The restrictions\nplaced on crew seats, including stroke length, control access, and seat armor limit flexibility of\ndesign options. The weight of combat gear is not included in Guide recommendations for crew\nseats. Since the large majority of flight hours are not in combat, it is probable that flight crew\nmembers will also be lightly equipped. This minimizes another problem. If the full range of\nweights were to be accommodated, a weight sensitive energy absorbing system would become\nmandatory in order to protect the occupants over the full range of weights.\nOccupant weights determining the effective design loads for seats recommended design loads are\nbased on 5th through 95th percentile weights for men, i,e., 144 through 22q lb, for crewmem, with\n112.6 to 175.2 lb. vertical effective weight (effective weight reduces seat load considerations by\nthe amount of the occupant\'s legs, which rest on the floor. As the authors point out, the ideal\nsituation would be to permit energy absorbing stroke length for the 95th percentile occupant using\ndeceleration limits based on the 5th percentile (who would load the system les_ and require more\nyielding ductility, i.e., a lower yield, for the same load reduction capability). However, as they Mac\npoint out, compromises must be made since the resulting needed stroke distance will not [\'e\n\'t\n\navailable in aircraft. A greater weight variation exists for troops and seats should be designed to\naccommodate them. The 95th percentile should be considered heavily clothed and the 13th\n\nf.\n\npercentile lightly clothed.\nCOMMENT:A wide variation in occupant weight cannot be avoided in the commercial environment.\nStrength\nThe Guide authors consider that "an elastic stress analysis, as used in the design of airframe and\naircraft components subjected to normal flight loads, is inadequate for the study of all the\nstructure in a crash situation ... the load carrying capacity of components deformed beyond tile\nelastic limit should be considered in determining the ultimate seat strength."\nStrength and Deformation\nIn discussing this subject, Guide authors first point out that some stroking (or displacement} will\n\n224\n\n"\n\n225\n\noccur for all systems if they are to remain in place during deceleration loads. A minimum\ndisplacement must be achieved if the system is to remain in i)lace during a given acceleration\npulse. In other words, there is an inherent load deflecti,n curve and travel limit envelope which\nimposes definite limits on the ability of any system to resist impulse loading. Intentional load\nlimiting is thus the control of this deflection to make h_at use of the space available in order to\nabserb energy and to optimize tbe occupant\'s capability to survive the loads imposed. Additionally,\nstructural joint deformation should be capable of large angular distortions in all directions without\nfailure, (e.g., bending moment between leg and sitting) including floor distortion and seat\npan distortion.\n"-1\n\nPADDING MATERIALS AND PROPERTIES\n\n_\n\nPlastic fesms are consideredby Army Guide authors as the most useful type of materials for energy\nabsorbing padding.

Strike zone areas with radii\no_nchcs\nor less" should be padded to a "minimum thickness of 0.75 inches".\nDuctile. energy tthsorbiug materials and breakaway panels should be used where possible.\nSwearingen (ref. I)-9) is cited as demonstrating "that at impact velocities of :|0ftJsee against rigid\nstructu_ podded with materials even 6 in. thick, unconsciousness, concussion, and/or fatal head\ninjuries will be produced. The Guide continues, "where possible, deformable strueture and padding\nmaterial should be considered to absorb the impact energy and to adequately distribute the forces\nover the face" (fig. D-5.9).\nCOMMENT: Effectiveness of padding has been accepted as being adequate for lesser thicknesses\nin commercial aircraft, which also have lower G criteria. There is also s question as to whether the\nsame level of protection is needed for the extremities. From earlier Swearingen work, it was\nconcluded that covering a head impact surface with l in. of Koreseal, (since superseded by Ensolite\nAH, or equivalent), would be considered to provide for delethslization.\nSEAT CUSHIONS\nSeat Cushions -- General Requirements\nSeat cushions should preclude body contact with scat structure while being light, tough (wear\nresistant), easily replaced, comfortable, and ventilated and provide flotation, while minimizing\nmotion during crash loading and rebound after crash loading. For Army purposes, load limiting\ncushions were considered to be undesirable. Net-type cushions are usable if designed to limit\nmaximum deformation and return movement, and to control potential for submarining or dynamic\novershoot. Furniture type back cushions are acceptable; finally, a head rest should Ix,.providcd to\nprovide whiplash pv0tection.\nDirect contact surfaces of the seat bottom and seat back "should be designed for comfort and\ndurability." However, "sufficient cushion thickness of the appropriate material stiffness should be\nprovided to preclude body contact with the seat structure when subjected to either the specified\noperational or crash loads .... The conflicting requirements of long-term comfort-versus-crash\nsafety considerations have made this s difficult design area."\nFrom comfort emphasis in the past, thick, soft cushions were used, spreading the load to avoid\nbuttock pressure points. Holes or forced sir flow (or net cushions) provided for c_a_liug.\nCOMMENT: However, the softness of such cushions pernlita a vel_,ity build-up as the soft\nmaterial compresses farther. Build.up is rapid during iuitial loading then followed hy a shorter\nstopping distanre duriug the final stages of high deceleration loading -- for a nonlinear stopping\ncharacteristic that puts major decelerations over a much shorter distanc,,.

"In\nmost cases, the back cushions will not play a significant role in crash dynamics; however, it will\ninfluence eonffort and can influence the injury tolerance of the spine." Lumbar supports are\ndesirable; a lumbar support that holds the lumbar spine forward slightly increases tolerance to\nvertical spinal loads.\nHowever, use of cushions per ae as load limitere is undesirable. Resulting downward motion of the\ntorso will produce added reetruint harne_ alack (when it is desirable to minimize same). Also "a\ncrushable cushion does not make optimum use of the available stroke distance, _ since crushing\nspace is needed and cushions can be only 75% as efficient as a mechanical load limiter. They "are\nimpractical in rotary and light fixed-wing aircraft because of the long stroke distance required to\nattenuate the high vertical loads" required by Army criteria.\nIIEADREST\nA 1.5.in. headrest shtmld be provided for occupant head]neck whiplash protection from backward\nflexure of the neck. "Cushioningcan he provided by a thin pad and deformable headrest or a thicker\ncushion on a more rigid headrest." Results of the TAR(_ study (ref. D-3) indicated that a lees tbick\nhcadrest would be desirable to accommodate a full range of male and female _mpnlation.\n\nTEST\nStructural Subeystem Teat Requirements\nFor Army systems, beth static and dynamic t_ts of prototype.sare recommended, including testing\nof _at and |ittsr systems as complete units, Component testing is to be used wherever possible.\nSubsequently, tests are to include ctuddousin place, seats full up and full back (unless a more critical\nposition exists) and normal floor buckling and warping conditions set up fox the most critical\nimpedance to neat stroking. Seat motmts chould be actual ah_raft hardware. Seat deformation\nshould be measured as near the seat reference point as is possible, Subsequently, only quality\nassurance testing is necessary unle_ majorstructural changes occur. If desired, dynamic tests with\nloading in all principal directions may be subotituted for static tea_, In static test, both unidirectional\nand combined loading tests shogld be used, with tent loads applied proportionately through a body\nblock restrained in the seat by the restraint system. Multiple tests are specified, using the effective\nweight of the 95th percantila male for all but the downward loading, which uses the effective weight\nof the 50th percentile male. Multiple occupancy seats should be fully occupied when tested;\nadditional tests should be accomplkhod for other adverse conditions that are identified.\n\nJ\n\nThe authors\' diecussion of static versus dynamic testing recommends that static tests be used\nbecause real time observation is possible, structural response information is more comparable to\ntypically used static analyses, and tests are more economical. However, all U.S. Army prototype\nseats should be dynamically tested for two conditions, (1) downward at a 30 \xc2\xb0 forward and\nsideward tilt and, (2) forward at a 30 \xc2\xb0 side facing angle.\nTo reduce ccete, special dynamic test conditions are permitted for seats having less than a 12-in.\nstroke. First, the costly full-scale crash test is considered desirable. However, and secondly,\nalternative dynamic testing of the seat only with a two stage pulse is acceptable, using a smaller\ninitial G plateau representing faiinre of the gear and increasing to a later higher G plateau\nrepresenting fusekge crushing. (Landing gear data to be baaed on results from drop test; fuselage\nproperties are to be determined by the moat comprehensive and rigorous analytical techniques,\nsupported by teat data).\nPersonnel Reetraint Harness TeaSing\nArmy requirements include static and dynamic test of restraints along with the structure to which\nattached. Additionally, all components (webbing, tiedowne and hardware in the load path) as well\nas eubaasembliea should be ststlcaliy teated separately to verify strength and elongation.\nHead Impact Teat Prmmdur_\nHead impact test procedurea are moat often to use a head form equipped with an accelerometer\nand to propel to impact with the surface to be evaluated via controlled drop, swing (pendulum) or\nram.\n\nStandard\n\n\'\n\n_\n\n_.\n\ni_i\n\nTeat Methods for Energy Aboorbing FoamJ\n\nAmong tests used from ASTM D 1564.71 (Standard Methods of Tenting Flexible Cellular MaterisS,\n-- Slab Urethane Foam) are beth load deflection and compression set. Numerous tests for various\npo_ible applioations are defined. For "reuonable survival potential for head impacts u velocities\nup to 20 fusee with a padding th/ckne_ between 1.5 and 2.0 in...,"acceleration of the head should\nnot exceed 60 G and sufficient material must be crushed to reduce the head ve|ocity from\n20 ft/eec to 0 ft/sec in the process of abeorbing the head kinetic energy of approximately\n60 to 90 ft-lb,"\n\n231\n\nEvaluation criteria for load distributing applications involves the assumptions that "A load\ndistributing pad should permit the face to penstt ate the surface easily, then maintain a cushioning\nlayer of foam between the base and the underlying structure during collapse of the\nunderstrt:cture."

As a\nresult of energy absorber performance, the crash pulse experienced by the paseenger has a\ndifferent shape than the pulse at the floor. The difference in pulse shape causes a differential in\nstopping distance between the passenger and floor, which is achieved by deformation of the energy\nabsorber and is termed the energy absorber stroke.\nThe energy abserber may be regarded as a filter which modifies the shape of the deceleration\npulse. The stroke distance can be related to this filtering action in a simple, geometric way.\nThe stopping distance s is related to the pulse shape by the formula\n$ =\n\nvT*\n\nwherev isthevelocity\natimpact\nandT\' isthetimecoordinate\nofthecentroid\nofthedeceleration\npulse. energy\nThe\nabsorber\nstroke\nrequirement\nis\n\nslzokc = S2-SI\n\n= v(T2*- TI*)"\n\n(t_}\nt\n\nwhere the sabseripte 1 and 2 refer respectively to the floor and passenger. The required stroke is\nthe initial velocity multiplied by the center of gravity shift cattm_lby modification of the shape of the\ndeceleration pulse.\n\n--\n\n236\n\n__\n\nPulse 1\n\n322 ftlseclsec\n(10 G)\n\n__\n\n/v\n\n- area \xe2\x80\xa2 32,2 ft./sec\n\ntl\'_//\n\nStopping distance s - 2,68 ft\n\n..._::.:\':\n....\n:\'_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,, \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 +,\n\'\'"\n\n....-,c\n_._,\xc2\xa3_.R/_\n.b%_:.:.\'\n\nl\n\n..,......\n0\n\n50 ms\n\n(2"2.68)\n\nv2/2s \xe2\x80\xa2 32,22/\na = 322"0.2/2\n\nl\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 193 ft/sec/sec\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n@\n\n161 ftlseclsec\xe2\x80\xa2 5 G\n\n200 ms\nTime\n\nPulse 2\nv = area - 32.2 ft/sec\n322 ft/sec/sec\n\n/\n\n.._:;_.:,_._._.:,.t.\'i:_:_;:_.\n_qN\n0\n\ntO0 ms\nTtme\n\n200 ms\n\n237\n\n)\'.\n\ni\n\nEquaLion givesan intuitive viewof energyabsorberperformance,For examp|e,equation(9) can\n(9)\nbe applied to compute the stroke distance required by a eimple hind limiter under a triangular\n\ni\n\npules (figure D-A.3).
