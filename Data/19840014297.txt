The accuracies of the existing\nanalyses are also hard to document. The primary reason for these difficulties\nis that there are a large number of noise mechanisms on rotors which can be\nimportant\nin different\nparts\nof the acoustic\nfrequency\nspectrum\ndepending\nupon the rotor\nparameters\nand operating\nenvironment.\nThe wide variety\nof\nsource mechanisms is due to various aeroacoustic effects: boundary layers,\nseparated\nflow, and inflow\nturbulence;\nhigh Mach numbers, including\nnonlinear\neffects; blade-vortex interactions; non-uniform inflow; etc. (I). In general,\nthe mechanisms each affect different parts of the acoustic spectrum. Then, on\ncraft with either tandem or main and t_il rotors, many of these mechanisms can\ninteract\nwith each other and between rotors.\nThus, in many cases, it is not\nclear which mechanisms are dominant in many operating conditions for full\nscale helicopters, propellers, etc.\nThis study addresses a part of the\nproblem\nbroadband noise. It reviews and extends broadband noise analyses\nand compares calculations based on various analyses of broadband noise\nmechanisms to each other and to available experimental data. The aims of this\nwork are to help understand which broadband noise mechanisms are important\nunder which circumstances, to identify a number of satisfactory, existing ,\nand well-documented experimental measurements, and to evaluate the various\nanalytical approaches by comparing them to each other and to the chosen\nexperiments. It will be seen that several satisfactory analytical approaches\nare available and their limitations will be delineated. These approaches can\nshow which mechanisms are important in which cases and are able to predict\nabsolute spectra to within about five dB for clean experiments.\nThe frequencies of interest in rotor noise are usually determined by human\nannoyance (or detection, in some cases) \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe common measures of annoyance,\nsuch as the perceived noise level (PNdB) or A-weighted sound level (dBA)\naccount for the fact that humans find low frequencies, say below a few hundred\nHertz, much less annoying. On the other hand, if long distance propagation is\na factor for the rotor in question, then high frequencies can be attenuated\nsignificantly by molecular absorption. For example, after propagation over\none kilometer, frequencies above a few thousand Hertz are attenuated\ndrastically (I). Thus frequencies in the range from a few hundred to several\nthousand hertz are of primary interest\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_,,_ _:_.\n._\n_ :i_\'_\'\n_r_,_,_.\n_\ni\nI\n....\n\nThe amount of power radiated by a rotor is generally extremely small\ncompared with the aerodynamic power consumed by the rotor (by a factor of\norder at least one to ten thousand). Thus the acoustics do not affect the\nrotor performance to any extent.\nNoise is radiated by forces, volume\ndisplacements, or nonlinearities which are either unsteady or vary in their\neffects when considered in terms of retarded time (1)\nIn general\nrotor\nnoise can be divided into three categories:\n\n....\n.\no ._\n\nI. Discrete frequency noise (sometimes called rotational or harmonic neise) is\ncaused by steady or harmonically varying forces, volume displacements, or\nnonlinear flow effects\xe2\x80\xa2 For low to moderate blade tip Mach number these can\nbe due to the basic blade rotation and forward flight of a helicopter or to\nsteady inflow variations. These mechanisms have been analyzed by Gutin,\nDeming, Hubbard, Lowson, and Wright. The steady loading noise is generally\n\n_i\n\n_\n\n;\n\n\'\n\n_\ni\n\n_\'__\n..\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _\n_:....\n;\ni_\' ,\n\xc2\xb0 .-_i\n\'_-,\n_.__:\n\'\n\no\n\n...\n\n_-F,\nj,_m_-\'\n_._i_.o\n} _ _\xe2\x80\xa2 .:.\no._\n_,_-2 _\n: _.\ni !_L_\n._\n_-_ :\no. __\n._.\n\n\'_\n_\'__ .__\nz _;,_,.\n\ni\n\n_\n\nrestrictedto the first dozen or so harmonicsof the blade passing frequency.\nThus it is not usually of importanceto helicoptermain rotors or large wind\nturbines as these frequencies lie in the frequency range below I00 Hz where\nhuman ears are not very sensitive.\nThese low order harmonics are, however,\nvery important\nto the cases of high RPM propellers\nor tail\nrotors.\nHarmonically varying effects can in principle, be important at higher\nfrequenciesfor all rotors. But in fact, the higher frequencynoises tend to\nbe caused by loads displacements or nonlinearities\nwhich are impulsive,due\nto high Math numbers, or are randomly varying (caused by turbulence). In\nthese cases the phenomena are better\nanalyzed as impulsive or broadband noise\nas discussed below.\n2. Impulsivenoise (sometimescalled blade slap) consists of nearly distinct\nrepeated pulses at blade-passingfrequency. After being Fourieranalyzea,the\nrepeated pulses will their\nyield impulsive\ndiscrete time harmonic spectra, origins their These pulses\nor\nbut\nparticular\nidentity\nis due to\nhistories\nand\nare caused particularlyby events at certain blade azimuth angles such as\nblade-vortexinteractionsor local transonicblade motion toward the observer\n(say Mach number greater than approximately0.75). These noise sources have\nbeen analyzed by Widnall, Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings, Farassat,\nHanson, and\nSchmitz et al and George and Chang (2-9) Impulsivenoise is unquestionably\nthe most importantnoisc source on helicopteror wind turbine rotors when it\nexists. However,a prime goal of aeroacoustic\nrotor design or operation is to\navoid impulsivenoise generationby control of blade-vortexinteractionsand\nby avoiding high tip Mach number. This often leaves broadband noise as the\nimportantcontrollingnoise in many situationswhere relative tip speeds are\nnot transonic and blade-vortex\ninteractions\nare avoided.\n3. Broadband noise, which is the subject of this study, has a continuous\n(although\nsometimes humped or peaked) spectrum and is caused by disturbances\nwhich are not precisely repeated at each blade revolution but which are\nbasically\nrandom in nature.\nThese random disturbances\nare generally\ndue to\nsome sort of turbulenceinteracting\nwith the rotor blades. The turbulencecan\neither be incident or, the blade from the ambient atmosphere or can be\ngenerated by the blade motion itself.

They treated the general case of\nunsteady forces distributed in space, following the Lighthill equation of\naeroacousics with specialization to rotating blades. See figure I for\ngeometry. They devised an analysis for the sound radiated from arbitrarily\nvarying forces on a rotor disk. The analysis was applied to the varying\nloadings on a rotating blade in the disk. The loadings were obtained from an\napproximate compressible aerodynamic analysis for an inflow of isotropic\nturbulencedefined by the Dryden spectrum. Inflow turbulencewas seen to be\nan important noise source over a range of frequencies\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe _nalysis also\nexplained the humped or peaked nature of the low frequency part of the\nspectrum as being due to the large scale components of the turbulence inflow.\nThese large\nscale\ncomponents give\nnearly\nperiodic\n(i.e.\nmodulated)\ndisturbancesas they are swept through the rotor plane; this leads to a nearly\nperiodic but finite bandwidth radiated sound\xe2\x80\xa2 This analysis is not well\nsuited for high frequencies since large CPU times are required for the\ncalculations.\nThus, later high frequencyanalyseswere developedby George and\nKim (16) and by Amiet (17), and variationson them were made by Harris and coworkers (18,19).\n4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_a\n\n\'\n\n-\n\no_,.._..,\nii,\n_,._;._:....\n::,,L,\n.......\',\',:\n=\n_,:_.,_;._\no,_,\n......\n__:-_\'\',.\n,,,,.\nL.z_;,\n\n\':\n_;_C_-._._*\n_:\n\nThe high frequency analysis\nof George and Kim (16) treated\nthe problem in a\ndifferent\nway.\nThey approximated\nthe distributed\nhlade forces\nas rotating\nconcentrated forces (dipoles) using the result of Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings\n(20). The analysis assumed the force components in the observer direction\nwere statistically stationary. This assumption effectively restricted tile\nanalysis\nto the forces\nnormal to the rotor\nplane and thus did not allow\naccounting for the much smaller torque forces which can be significant for\nobservers near the plane of rotation nor for the detailed radiation\ndirectiohality of the blade elements. The assumption of circular motion also\ndoes not allow accurate treatment of forward-flight helicopter cases. We will\nsee later in this report that these are not important restrictions except for\nwithin about fifteen degrees of the rotor plane or for advance ratios greater\nthan about 0.4 (which is beyond the range of interest for typical\nhelicopters).\nThe analysis gives a reasonably simple equation for the\nradiated sound\nIt gives some analytical insight into the noise generation\nmechanism\'s dependence upon rotor\nparameters\nand it can also be numerically\n\n_._"_;.i\nI\n_,,,,_\n=._._,_._-_,_o_.,.\n..\n_;c_,_,\n=-"__\';_*\'_\n_-?\n_ _\n_o._..,_.\n\nevaluated in a quite straightforward way.\nThe method of Amiet (17) is based on a different concept\nInitially, Amiet\nhad analyzed the radiation\nof sound from a stationary\nnon-rotating\nair=oil\nin\na uniform mean flow containing turbulence (21,22). This analysis accounted\nfor the full range of wavelength-to-chord ratios and accurately predicted the\ndirectionality of the radiation (which becomes multi-lobed at intermediate\nwavelength-to-chord ratios).

Although the\nDoppler shifts make it more complicated,one can roughly identify a given\nfrequency radiation with the inverse time for a blade to pass through a\nturbulence component of length I/k, where k is the wavenumber. Thus, for\nfrequencies on the order of 10 kHz at a tip speed of I_0 m/s, one is\ninterestedin turbulencecomponentwavenumbersof order 100 m" . If, as for a\nfull scale helicopter,the integral scale is of order I00 m, then the peak of\nthe spectrum is at wavenumber k of4order 0.01 m" _ implying that the high\nfrequenciescome from wave numbers 10 higher than the inverseintegralscale.\nReferringto figure 20 we see that the differencebetweenthe two atmospheric\nturbulencemodels can be of order 10 dB at these wavenumbers. For anotherway\nof lookingat it, figure 35 shows comparisonsbetween inflow turbulencenoise\ncalculationsfor a full scale rotor for both 0.I m and 67.0 m integralscales.\nIt is apparentthat for a small integralscale and low frequenciesthe results\nfor differentassumedturbulencespectraare in close agreement,although even\nso the differences become more marked at high frequencies One concludes\nthat the Von Karman spectrashould be used particularly\nfor cases in which the\nintegral scale is large. However, some comparisons in the previous section\ndid indicate that for indoor tests (which small scale turbulence involves),\nthe Dryden spectrumgives better results.\n\n_ _._\n_\n_\n_i\n_\n.L\n\xe2\x80\xa2_c\n_L\n_ <_\n:\n:\n- _ ;\n_ \'_\n:\n_\n\'\n.. ,_\n_;":..\n....\n_\n_ "\n.....\n;\n_\n....\n\n:\n\n_::\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_\n\n,. ;\n;.:\n_\n;\n\nFigure 36 shows the effect of forward flight on inflow turbulencenoise as\ncalculated\nby Amiet\'s analysis and compared to hove_ calculations\nbased on\nGeorge and Kim\'s analysis. It is notablethat the advanceratio effect is not\nvery importantfor any case of interest to helicopters (i.e. advance ratio\nbelow 0.4). Similarly,figure 37 compareschanging advanceratio for boundary\nlayer trailing edge noise. Here the basic inputs vary since the calculation\nof Kim and George uses an airfoil boundary layer thicknesscorrelation (38)\nrather than the flat plate results incorporatedin their earlierpublications\nand in those of Amiet.

On the other hand, wind turbines\ngenerallyhave tapered blades and we have seen that their primarynoise source\nin the frequencyrange of interest is boundary layer trailing edge noise (see\nfigures 11 and 12).\n\n_.,..__:.\n.\n__-_.,,\n= _,_:_\n_- _=._._<\ni -__\xc2\xb1\'v_\n\' ...\n.\n\nThe relative importanceof various complex question as various noise\nconfiguration is an interesting yet mechanismson a full scale helicopter\nmechanismsexist on both the main and tail rotors, Some calculations\nshowing\nthe effects of varying the inflow turbulencescale are shown in figure 28 for\na UH-1 helicopter main rotor.

The primary added difficultyin dealingwith tail rotor noise\nis that the tail rotor operates in the main rotor\'swake, which is itself not\nvery well understood. The main rotor\'s wake consists of a number of\ncomponents: the overall downwash field, the tip trailing vortices and other\nvortices shed from the main rotor blades, the wakes of the fuselage,engines,\nand rotor hub, and the turbulence present in these flows as well as that\nalready existing in the atmosphere. The main rotor\'s mean wake can be\napproximatelycalculatedby severalmethods, but has a fairly minor influence\non the tail rotor noise. This is because it leadsprimarilyto only low order\nloadingharmonicsand noises. On the other hand, the tip vortices in the wake\nare quite localizedand lead to more annoying,higher frequency noise. The\ntip vortices\'positions and structuresare difficultto predict. In forward\nflight, they follow initiallyepicycloida!paths which are perturbedby : I)\nthe roll-up of the main rotor wake into a horseshoe vortex system; 2) the\nself-inducedinstabilitiesof the vortex trajectories;and 3) the action of\npre-existingatmospheric\nturbulence. In addition,the actual structureof the\nvortices is not well known. They can contain axial velocitiesin their cores\nwhich are of the order of their maximum circumferential\nvelocities. For the\ninteractiongeometry associatedwith forward flight, where the vortex core\nwill be approximatelyperpendicularto the plane of the tail rotor, these\naxial velocitieswill be strong contributorsto the loading fluctuationson\n17\n\n,\n\nH \'\n\n1\n\n"\n\xc2\xb0_i_.\n\xc2\xb0 I!,_\nI!i_\n_._\n/:,\nill\n_\n.....\n_.\n,"\n_:\n_i!\n_, :\'_\n_\'_,\n_.\n_"\n=_\'_-_,\n- \'o_i\n_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n\n_\n\n__\n\nthe tail rotor blades.\nAlso, the tip vortices are found to diffuse or \'burst\'\nunder some conditions\n(the\n\'vortex\nbreakdown\' phenomenon).\nAfter\nthey\nbreakdown, the vortices\nbecome more spread out and turbulent.\nThis will\nstrongly affect both the mean and the turbulentinflow seen by the tail rotor.\nThe importanceof wake ingestionon noise was pointed out in some experiments\nof Levine (68).\nHe reported some experiments where increases of 5 to I0 dB\nwere found in both narrowband and broadband noise of a Sikorsky S-58T operated\nwith the main rotor wake being blown into the tail rotor. Significant\nreductions in tail rotor noise were also reported by Barlow et al. for a\nredesignedOH-6A tail rotor (69). Another experimentalstudy of tail/main\nrotor wake interaction\nnoise involved wind tunnel tests of a model with\nvariable tail rotor position and direction (70,71). Balcerak (70) made a\nparametric study varying tail rotor locat.inn_ in blockage area, tail rotor\nf\nrotation\ndirection,\nrotor speeds and thrusts,\nand tail\nrotor pusher/tractor\nconfiguration. Later Pegg and Shidler (71) tested the same model, extending\nthe work and emphasizingidentifyingthe aeroacoustic\nmechanismsproducingthe\nnoise. They found about a 12 dB increase in broadband noise when the main\nrotor flow was added to the tail rotor and significantincreasesin harmonics\nunder a variety of conditions. These experimentsare very importantand point\nout the complexity and the need for more analytical understandingof tail\nrotor broadbandnoise sources and how to reduce these sources.\n\n_i\n\n:, _\n\n_,\n_,__\n_\n_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_.\n_i\n\n!_,\n\nIn the present study all we can do is present a few simple calculationsto\nshow the importanceof the various mechanisms to tail rotors. Figure 43\npresents UH-I tail rotor noise for conditionscorresponding the main rotor\nto\ncalculationsshown in figure 42 (i.e,with no main rotorwake effects). Under\nthose conditions,tail rotor noise is clearly less importantthan main rotor\nnoise. In contrast, figure 44 presents calculationsfor inflow turbulence\nnoise due to ingestionof assumedmain rotorwake turbulence. (The tail rotor\ntip and boundary layer noise sources are unchanged from figure 43.) The\nturbulence intensity estimates range from those found in the atmosphere to\nlarge values, and the length scales are alternatively\ntaken as the main rotor\nchord or radius.\nAlthough these estimates range widely,\nit is clear by\ncomparing figure 44 to 42 that the tail rotor ingestion of the main rotor wake\nis very importantand deservesmuch more attention in the future.\n\nc_\n\n,i._\n.....\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n,\n\nThe final comparisons of mechanisms are for a typical light aircraft\npropeller. Figure 45 compares calculationsfor a static propeller on the\nground. A number of different inflow turbulence intensity values are used,\nranging from representativeof quiet nighttimeconditionsto typical daytime\nconditions. It is evident that under high atmosphericturbulenceconditions,\ninflow turbulenceis dominant over nearly all of the spectrum. On the other\nhand, for low turbulenceintensities, for a flyover case as shown in figure\nor\n46, we find that tip or trailing edge noise can be important,depending on\nblade angle of attack. Figure 46 shows calculationssomewhat arbitrarily\nbased on 4.0 and 8.5 degree angles of attack.

Further\nresearch is needed on broadbandrotor noise near the rotor plane.\nMost experimentsdo not includeenough inflow turbulencedata to define the\ninputs to the analyses.\nIn particular,\nthe effect of streamtube contraction\non generating anisotropic and large scale inflow turbulence needs more\ntheoretical\nand experimental attention.\n\n\'\no\n\n......\ni\n\'"\n_ \xc2\xb0 _,\n-_ \'\n;\n,_\n\no\n\nThe calculations\nand comparisons shown indicate\nthat\ninflow turbulence\ninduced lift\nfluctuations\nare the most important broadband noise sources at\nlow frequencies.\nThis radiation\ncan be predicted down to the lowest blade\npassing frequency,\nincluding\nthe smooth peaked spectral\nstructure,\nby the\nmethod of Homicz and George (15).\nFor the higher frequencies,\nwhich are of\nmore practical\ninterest,\nthe methods of George and Kim (16) and of Amiet (17)\nare just as satisfactoryand are much easier to compute. When the same inflow\nturbulence spectrum is used both of the methods seem to agree well with each\nother and with measurements over a full range of parameters, except at angles\nwithin about ten to fifteen degreesof the rotor plane. The Karman spectrum,\nwhich had been implemented in both George and Kim\'s and Amiet\'s methods, is\n\n_; _,_!\n;\n\nBoundarylayer trailing edge noise is now well understood.

This source was seen to be the primary broadband noise source\nfor full scale wind turbines. This source often is the importantnoise source\nat high frequencies on large rotors when inflow turbulence is weak.

The\nseparation geometry is influenced by rounded or sharp edges as in the tip\ncase.\nOur goal was to construct a suitable correlation for the pressure\nspectra in the delta case and to relate it to the tip flow case of interest.\n\n;\n":\ni i;_\n:=_,_:\n\nRichard and Fahy (76) have analyzed the turbulent flow beneath the leading edge vortices of several delta wings of different planforms and various\nangles of attack. They presented spectra from a number of investigators, nondimensionalized in several ways, none of which were satisfactory for our\ncase.\nIn order to find a normalization suitable for application to our tip\ncase we first studied the delta wing flow geometry and pressure data measured\nin the comprehensive experiments of Peckham (77)\xe2\x80\xa2\nBased on flow visualization\nresults, the locations of peak negative pressures, and on pressure distributions, the value of the transverse separation scale L was found relative to\nthe local chord and plotted as L/C versus angle of attack _ as shown in figure\nB-3.\nThe edge shape is definitely important as noted also by Bartlett and\nVidal (78). Next the maximum negative pressure coefficients under the vortices relative to those on the nearby surface were used with the Bernouilli\nequation to derive the maximum velocity ratio Vm/U.\nAssuming that the velocity in the vicinity of the vortex is approximately the same as that on\nnearby surfaces one obtains:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 i ,-_\n\xe2\x80\xa2_,_\n.....\n; ,," >\nc,_\nc.\xe2\x80\xa2 ....\n,:\nL ....\n" _;\n= ;.,\n\'_-\'\ni_i\n_o\'_,_\n\n_\n\n! :\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2"_\n\nVm/U\n\n:\n,,,:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\n::.\n,\n....\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'x.,\n\n(i\n\nCpmin)I/2\n\n(B-3)\n\nThe resulting values are plotted as a function of angle of attack _ of\nthe delta wing in figure B-4.\nThus, using figures B-3 and B-A the values of L and Vm can be estimated\nfor each of the spectra given by Richards and Fahy (76) and the data normalized by these two physically important parameters. The results, as shown in\nfigure B-5, give a son.ewhatbetter correlation of the spectra than either of\nthe two other normalizations given in Richards and Fahy\'s paper,\nThese spectra can be approximated by the curve defined by\n25\n\n,\ni\n\n: 14\n\ni\nI\ni_"\n\n-3.475\n\n,_\n\n- 1.654\n\n(logle\n\n_ + 0.82) 2 ,\'\n\nloglo\n\n_ < -0.82\n\nlog_o_ =\n\nm\n\n(B-4)\n-3.475\n\nbut\n\'/\nL\ni\nIL\no_\n_\ni__\n\n_\'_\n....\n_-_\n\nC : 0 if\n\n- 0.984\n\n(loglo\n\n_ + 0.82) 2 ;\n\nlogLo\n\n_ > -0.82\n\n_ < O.\n\nThis curve is comparable to the identically normalized two-dimensional\ndata, showing that the method of normalizing satisfactorily relates pressure\nspectra in different types of flows. The primary difference between the two\nspectra is the slower fall-off with frequency of the delta wing spectrum compared Lo the two-dimensional spectrum.\nIn order to be able to find an appropriate spectrum for a rotor tip case\nwe need estimates of L and Vm for rotor tips at different angles of attack.\nThe flow visualization, pressure measurements, and velocity measurements of\nGray et al. (79) and of Chigier and Corsiglia (80) were used in a similar manner as for the delta wing cases to estimate L/C and Vm/U versus _ as shown\nin figures B-6 and B-? respectively. Vm/U can be expressed as\nVmlU = 1.0 + 0.0359\n\noca .no,\n\nL/c = 0.023 + 0.0089 a\n\n(B-S)\n\n(B-6a)\n\nfor a square tip cross section or\n";i;\n:,\n\n,,\n\nL/c = 0.0074 (_ - 2.0)\n\n(B-6b)\n\nfor a round edged tip. Gray et al. tested both a rounded and a square tip and\nthus the values of L/C are more accurately related to edge shape than in the\navailable delta data given above.\nOn the other hand, the values Vm/U were\nestimated from Gray et al.\'s Cp data and from the hot wire measurements of\nreference 80 and are only approximate. Further work is needed to definitively\n\n.:\n\nestablish the turbulence properties on wing and rotor tips.\n\n-\n\nIn summary, given a tip shape and angle of attack the values of L and\nVm are obtained from equations B-5 and B-6 and then these values are used to\nobtain a pressure spectrum from either the two-dimensional or delta results\ngiven by equations B-2 or B-4. This spectrum is actually applicable near the\nreattachment line.\nThe spectrum is somewhat lower in the separated region\nbefore reattachment and it drops off past reattachment.\nAt this state of\napproximation, rather than integrating this spanwise variation we used the\nreattachment spectrum and assumed it to be constant over the distance L. By\nnot including any of the blade outside of the separation region of length L we\nshould roughly compensate for the actual changes in spectrum shape and\namplitude in the tip region.\n\n....\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_,\n\n26\n\n\xc2\xae\n\nLli_.\n\n_\xc2\xb0\n,:\n....\n.;_,\n\nThe value of Uc is taken as Uc = 0.8 U and _2(_) -_ 2.1(Uc/_) based\non results for boundary layer turbulence (81).
