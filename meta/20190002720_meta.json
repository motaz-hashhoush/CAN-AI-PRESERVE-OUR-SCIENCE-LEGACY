From the NASA Mariner 10 flybys, in 1974 and 1975, ~45% of the planet was imaged, its magnetic field was detected, H, He, and O in the exosphere were measured, and other physical characteristics of the planet were determined. Despite these data, much information about Mercury still had to be inferred. It was over 30 years before MESSENGER provided the first in-depth study of the innermost planet. Orbiting Mercury from 2011 to 2015, the MESSENGER spacecraft was able to image the entirety of the planet and thus provide the first global view of Mercury. Coupling multispectral images with data from MESSENGER geochemical instruments, we have developed a better understanding of the geochemical terranes on the planet and the unique nature of Mercury\u2019s composition compared to the other terrestrial planets. MESSENGER also provided data that have led to great advancements in understanding the internal structure, exosphere, and magnetosphere of Mercury. The treasure trove of MESSENGER data reveal Mercury as a geochemical end-member among the terrestrial planets. However, we are left with many questions that can only be answered with further exploration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190002720, "endDate": "2019-03-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5fd5bdc152c8485b8df348cb74163560", "id": "c33d7fa8fdd74a1483cb5733926ed9e2"}], "name": "Lunar and Planetary Science Conference", "location": "The Woodlands, Texas", "id": "5fd5bdc152c8485b8df348cb74163560", "startDate": "2019-03-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190002720, "id": "ca3ac4941d5e41eb90e5ca258aeec830", "publicationDate": "2019-03-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190002720.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190002720/downloads/20190002720.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190002720/downloads/20190002720.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190002720/downloads/20190002720.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
