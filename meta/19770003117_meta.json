Promising VCE concepts are described, their designs are simplified and the potential benefits in terms of aircraft performance are identified. This includes range, noise, emissions, and the time and effort it may require to ensure technical readiness of sufficient depth to satisfy reasonable economic, performance, and environmental constraints. A brief overview of closely related, ongoing technology programs in acoustics and exhaust emissions is also presented. Realistic technology advancements in critical areas combined with well matched aircraft and selected VCE concepts can lead to significantly improved economic and environmental performance relative to first generation SST predictions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19770003117, "endDate": "1976-07-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "78173b6a37604251a0d73d2045bf4edf", "id": "0fa78e12c7f84a1b82a74f9a07566447"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE"}}, "meetingId": "78173b6a37604251a0d73d2045bf4edf", "id": "416dd6551d964d79b65ed5054f48820b"}], "name": "Propulsion Conf.", "location": "Palo Alto, CA", "id": "78173b6a37604251a0d73d2045bf4edf", "startDate": "1976-07-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770003117, "id": "93a36b06bdff4c8eb3c2b328b8bd93b2", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770003117.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770003117/downloads/19770003117.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770003117/downloads/19770003117.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770003117/downloads/19770003117.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
