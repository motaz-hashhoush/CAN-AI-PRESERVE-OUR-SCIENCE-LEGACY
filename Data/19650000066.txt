The sensor\nis packaged in a 1-1/4- x 1-1/4- x 1-1/2-inch steel\ncontainer having a precision flat base which is placed\non a horizontal surface to be leveled.\nHow it's done: The four photocells are mounted at\nthe extremities of two orthogonal reference axes (+x,\n\xe2\x80\x94x; + y , \xe2\x80\x94y ) lying in a plane parallel to the base of the\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Each pair of oppositely mounted photocells\n(one pair on the x\xe2\x80\x94x axis and the other pair on the\ny\xe2\x80\x94y axis) is connected as a half-bridge circuit. The\nsmall lamp near the base of the sensor is symmetrically\nmounted between the photocells. Light from this lamp\npasses up through a collimator to the circular spirit\nlevel and a concave reflector which are symmetrically\nmounted above the photocells. The bubble in the spirit\nlevel and the concave reflector constitute a lens system\nwhich reflects light from the lamp to the photocells.\nIn making a measurement, the base of the sensor is\nset on a horizontal precision flat surface to be leveled.\nWhen the bubble is centered, indicating a level\ncondition, the photocell bridge is balanced and there is\n(continued overleaf)\n\nthis document, or that the use of any information, apparatus, method,\nor process disclosed in this document may not infringe privately-owned\nrights; or B.

When the test surface deviates\nfrom level by more than \xc2\xb115 seconds of arc, the\nbubble is displaced and different amounts of light are\nreflected to each of the photocells. As a result, the\nbridge is unbalanced and puts out a dc error voltage.\nNotes:\nI. The sensitivity of the device is basically dependent\non the geometry of the spirit level.\n2. This sensor can be easily converted into an automatic leveling system by incorporating conventional position servos.\n3. This device should have application for remote\nleveling of machinery, automatic leveling of forcemeasuring instruments, leveling of surveying instruments, and leveling of vehicles in static test\norientations.\n\nBrief B65-10067\t\n\n4.
