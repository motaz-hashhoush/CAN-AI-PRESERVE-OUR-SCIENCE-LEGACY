Interhemispheric asymmetries as manifested in auroral emissions have been observed for over 40 years. Unfortunately, the nature of the problem has limited the type and extent of studies that can be performed to either conjugate ground based observations or comparison of space based images with all-sky cameras. Recently Frank and Sigwarth (2002) published results using unique simultaneous images from Polar of the northern and southern aurora, but these are necessarily limited to the nighttime and at oblique angles. However, conjunctive images made with the cameras from the Polar and IMAGE missions contain simultaneous conjugate images of the large-scale aurora under many and varying conditions. This rich data set provides an opportunity to study interhemispheric auroral asymmetries and investigate their occurrence as a function of solar wind conditions and ionospheric parameters such as conductivity. In order to use images of different scenes from each of these cameras, knowledge of their relative response is required. To that end, this paper will present preliminary results of comparing the images with emphasis on data from the Polar UVI LBH filters and the IMAGE FUV WIC.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040012857, "endDate": "2003-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "550755b430ac498c8d5e228ddbd20eb7", "id": "7895586d88894785a43efffc208e126d"}], "name": "Fall American Geophysical Union Meeting", "location": "San Francisco, CA", "id": "550755b430ac498c8d5e228ddbd20eb7", "startDate": "2003-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040012857, "id": "ea6850c4840b4414a40d2e5bb8baea41", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
