REALM technology can provide detailed data to enable autonomous operations such as automated crew procedure generation and robotic interaction with logistics and deep space habitats; this is especially of value where communication delays with Earth drive the need for self-reliance. The REALM project will conduct a series of ISS technology demonstrations. The first ISS demonstration, REALM-1, started in February 2017 and was completed at the end of FY19 when it was transitioned to the ISS program for sustaining operations.  The second ISS demonstration, REALM-2, started late2019 and will continue for at least one year.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210015701, "id": "e7b3719070be4be485b2aa92f3c9da60", "publicationName": "NASA TechPort", "publicationDate": "2021-05-06T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": "https://techport.nasa.gov/view/93175"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200506 REALM STI Review Document.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210015701/downloads/20200506%20REALM%20STI%20Review%20Document.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210015701/downloads/20200506%20REALM%20STI%20Review%20Document.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210015701/downloads/20200506%20REALM%20STI%20Review%20Document.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
