The test bearing design was computer optimized for high speed operation. Temperature distribution bearing heat generation were determined as a function of shaft speed, radial and thrust loads, lubricant flow rates, and lubricant inlet temperature. The high speed design, tapered roller bearing operated successfully at shaft speeds up to 20,000 rpm under heavy thrust and radial loads. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with the high speed design bearing were significantly less than those of a modified standard bearing tested previously. Cup cooling was effective in decreasing the high cup temperatures to levels equal to the cone temperature.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800021233, "id": "d969219c78774f578269c466687f5fcd", "publicationDate": "1980-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800021233.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800021233/downloads/19800021233.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800021233/downloads/19800021233.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800021233/downloads/19800021233.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
