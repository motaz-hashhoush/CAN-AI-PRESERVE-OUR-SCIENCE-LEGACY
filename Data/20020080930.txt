b"Storm Warning Service\n\nA\n\nA COMMERCIAL\nWEATHER ADVISORY\nSERVICE EVOLVED\nFROMNASA,S COLLAB-\n\nORATION WITH A TV\nMETEOROLOGIST\n\nt rlght, Bob Baron of\nBaron Services, Inc.,\nHuntsville, Alabama is\nmonitoring a weather display,\npart of a severe weather\nadvisory service he provides\non a commercial basis.\nBaron Services is a spinoff\ncompany whose weather\nadvisories are based on data\noriginating at Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC), also\nlocated in Huntsville.\nIn 1988, Bob Baron, chief\nmeteorologist of Huntsville's\nNBC affiliate WAFF-TV, learned\nthat MSFC had developed a\nlightning detection and location\nnetwork that provides real time\ninformation. Intended as an aid\nto NASA research operations\nl\nat MSFC, the ~ a r s h a l system\nuses a central processor to\ncollect raw data from strategically placed antennas in\nAlabama and Tennessee; the\ndata is transmitted to users\nby telephone lines.\nBaron proposed and concluded an arrangement with\nMSFC whereby the center\nwould provide him the data\nand he would refine and\nenhance the MSFC real-time\ndisplay software. He formed\nBaron Services to commercialize the system and acquired\nhis first two clients, Huntsville\nUtilities and the Huntsville\ndivision of space rocket\nmanufacturer Thiokol Inc.\nA 1989 tornado that caused\nextensive damage in the Huntsville area prompted Baron to\nmodify his service to allow\nquicker and more accurate\ndissemination of severe weather\ninformation to the public.\nBaron Services developed\na means of changing the\ncomputer data to audio data\n\nfor transmission by radio station\nsubcarrier, reception by clients\nthrough an antenna, and decoding by computer for display.\nIn 1991-92, Baron further\nimproved the service. He\ndeveloped software to combine\non-screen data from the Lightning Detection Service with a\nconventional weather display\nshowing clouds and rain intensity. Later, he advanced the\nsystem to combine real time\nlightning data with Doppler\nradar, broadening the range of\nstorm data and enabling client\ncompanies to monitor the\napproach and departure of\nsignificant storms and schedule\ntheir operations accordingly.\nThe latest development is\nstorm projection, which gives\nutilities, emergency management officials and others\naffected the ability to plot a\ndangerous storm's projected\nmovement, instantly identify\nall communities in the storm's\npath, and estimate the time\nthe storm will arrive at each\ncommunity.\n\nBaron Services' client list\nhas expanded considerably\nand the company is now\nexpanding into several other\nlocations. Baron has entered\ninto a joint agreement with\nEnterprise Electronics Co.,\nEnterprise, Alabama, a Doppler\nradar manufacturer, and\nGeomet Data Service, Tucson,\nArizona, a national lightning\ndetection concern, to continue\ndevelopment of the service\nand market it nationally and\ninternationally.\n\n"
