b'HYPERION STUDIES OF CROP STRESS IN MEXICO\nDavid B. Lobell1,2 and Gregory P. Asner1,2\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nSatellite-based measurements of crop stress could provide much needed information for cropland management,\nespecially in developing countries where other precision agriculture technologies are too expensive (Pierce and\nNowak 1999; Robert 2002). For example, detection of areas that are nitrogen deficient or water stressed could guide\nfertilizer and water management decisions for all farmers within the swath of the satellite. Several approaches have\nbeen proposed to quantify canopy nutrient or water content based on spectral reflectance, most of which involve\ncombinations of reflectance in the form of vegetation indices. While these indices are designed to maximize\nsensitivity to leaf chemistry, variations in other aspects of plant canopies may significantly impact remotely sensed\nreflectance. These confounding factors include variations in canopy structural properties (e.g., leaf area index, leaf\nangle distribution) as well as the extent of canopy cover, which determines the amount of exposed bare soil within a\nsingle pixel. In order to assess the utility of spectral indices for monitoring crop stress, it is therefore not only\nnecessary to establish relationships at the leaf level, but also to test the relative importance of variations in other\ncanopy attributes at the spatial scale of the remote sensing measurement. In this context, the relative importance of a\ngiven attribute will depend on (1) the sensitivity of the reflectance index to variation in the attribute and (2) the\ndegree to which the attribute varies spatially and temporally.\nIn this study, we investigate the ability of spectral indices derived from data collected by the EO-1 Hyperion\ninstrument to detect canopy stress in an agricultural region in Northwest Mexico. In particular, the objectives of this\nstudy were to: (1) determine the correlation between reflectance indices of canopy \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchemistry\xe2\x80\x9d\nwithin an agricultural landscape, and (2) quantify the extent to which information in chemical indices provide useful\ninformation for crop management. In essence, this equates to asking whether hyperspectral chemical reflectance\nindices provide any unique information on crop canopies, and, if so, whether this information is potentially useful\nfor precision agriculture applications.\n2.0 DATA AND METHODS\n2.1 Site Description\nThe study was conducted in the Yaqui Valley, a region comprising roughly 225,000 ha of intensively fertilized and\nirrigated cropland on the west coast of Sonora, Mexico (Figure 1, after the references). A vast majority of this land is\nplanted to wheat in November-December and harvested in April-May, with wheat yields among the highest in the\nworld. Rising fertilizer prices, concerns about environmental pollution, and diminishing water supplies has increased\nthe need for methods to improve nutrient and water use efficiencies of wheat production in this region. A\nparticularly important time in the growing season is mid-January, when the first post-planting irrigation and\nfertilization is performed. At this time, detection of canopy nutrient or water stress could guide the timing and\namount of water and fertilizer applications.\n2.2 Data acquisition and processing\nHyperion data was acquired on January 14, 2002, one minute after an image was collected by the Landsat ETM+\nsensor. The Hyperion image was roughly centered within the ETM+ image and covered a significant fraction of the\nirrigation district (see Figure 1). An additional ETM+ image acquired on March 16, 2002 was combined with the\nJanuary image to estimate wheat yields using a previously validated methodology (Lobell, Asner et al. 2003). These\nyields were used to evaluate the eventual growth of fields observed by Hyperion in January, as described below.\nHyperion data were provided by the EROS Data Center (EDC) and processed to apparent surface reflectance using\nthe ACORN 3 atmospheric correction model. A de-striping algorithm was then applied to correct for mis-calibration\nbetween cross track detectors. This algorithm determines the average noise in each column by summing all\nreflectance values by column and applying a Lee filter to the resulting 256 values. The column sums are divided by\nthe filtered reflectance values to approximate the necessary gains for each column, which are then applied to the\nimage. After this step, a cubic spline is fit to the water bands at 940 and 1140 nm in each pixel to reduce the effects\nof mis-calibration and modeling errors introduced by the atmospheric correction.\n1\n\nDepartment of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Stanford, California 94305\nDepartment of Geological and Environmental Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305\n(dlobell@globalecology.stanford.edu, gasner@globalecology.stanford.edu)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2.3 Reflectance Indices\nSeveral indices drawn from the literature and shown in Table 1 were computed from the Hyperion data. The first\ntwo indices (NDVI and SR) are based on combinations of red and near infrared (NIR) reflectance that are known to\ncapture variations in canopy structural attributes, such as canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI). The rest of the\nindices were designed to measure aspects of leaf chemistry, including contents of leaf pigments such as\nchlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanin (PRI, SIPI, PSRI, R-Gratio); nitrogen (NDNI); and water (WI, NDWI,\nMSI, NDII). Many of these indices were defined by leaf-level studies and have not been widely tested at the canopy\nor landscape scales.\nTo determine the extent to which these indices provide unique information from each other in this agricultural\nlandscape, Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s rank correlation coefficient (\xcf\x81S) was computed for each combination of indices using all\nimage pixels (n = 224,042). This non-parametric correlation was used to capture non-linear relationships between\nindices and to minimize sensitivity to extreme values. Two indices (PRI and WI) were judged to be too noisy using\nthe Hyperion data and were therefore excluded from further analysis.\nTable 1.

One possibility is to\ndefine a suite of leaf chemistry variables of interest, measure these properties in various fields simultaneous to\nimage acquisition, and then statistically test the ability of each index to predict each variable. In this study, we use\nan alternative approach that utilizes image data taken at a later point in the growing season. We refer to this\nprocedure as quantile mapping (QM), which is illustrated in Figure 2 and can be described as follows:\n1) To control for variations in canopy structure, which are shown to affect all indices (see below), we identify\nall pixels within a narrow range of NDVI values.\n2) For these pixels, we compute the distribution of values for a selected index (e.g. RG-ratio), and identify all\npixels falling below and above defined thresholds. In this case, we select pixels below the 25-percentile\n(group A) and above the 75-percentile (group B).\n\n2\n\n3) An image collected later in the season is used to define the eventual growth of each pixel. In this study, we\nused the yield estimates derived from Landsat ETM+, which rely on an image from March 16 (two months\nafter the Hyperion image). By comparing the eventual yields of pixels in group A and group B, which\npossessed the same structural attributes (NDVI), we can evaluate whether the additional information in the\nselected index was predictive of canopy growth, and therefore indicative of canopy stress.\n4) Steps (1)-(3) are repeated for each level of NDVI.\nThis procedure is called quantile mapping because pixels above and/or below a specified quantile are mapped and\ntracked through the growing season. To determine the sensitivity of this approach to sampling uncertainties, step (3)\nis repeated a large number of times (10,000), each time with random subsets of group A and B used in place of the\nentire groups. This provides a bootstrap estimate of sampling uncertainty (Efron and Gong 1983).\nWe see several advantages to this approach. First, it requires only image data and therefore can be used to test\nindices in any region where ground data is not available. Similarly, it can be used for retrospective studies of images\nacquired in previous years. Second, because it is based solely on image statistics, the entire process can be\nautomated. For example, steps (1)-(2) effectively create maps of nutrient stress that can be quickly generated and\npotentially used for management applications. This is particularly important for agricultural applications, where\nquick turnaround times are essential. Third, the comparison of groups A and B is performed at various levels of\nNDVI, so that the effect of canopy structure on the information content of the selected index can be readily\nevaluated. For example, some aspects of leaf chemistry may only be retrievable at very high LAI (Asner 1998).\nOne drawback of this approach is that, because it relies on image statistics, it is only able to determine relative levels\nof stress within an image. For example, in cases where 50% of fields are stressed in reality, a procedure that selects\nonly the top 25% will miss many fields. Alternatively, if only 5% of fields are stressed, then 20% will be falsely\nidentified as stressed. However, by combining image statistics across several years, it should be possible to associate\nan absolute value with each quantile and therefore produce more robust measures of crop stress.\n3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTable 2 shows the correlation matrix for indices evaluated in this study. Given the high correlation of all indices\nwith NDVI (\xcf\x81S > 0.9, p < 0.001), it is clear that each index is highly impacted by variations in canopy cover and\nstructure across the landscape. This is true even for indices designed to be \xe2\x80\x9cstructure insensitive.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore, no\nsingle index should be considered as a measure of solely canopy chemistry. In general, high correlations between all\nindices indicated that no two indices provided independent measures of plant canopies. However, the fact that all\ncorrelations were less than unity implies that there is some information (or potentially noise) unique to each index.\nFigure 3 illustrates the result of the QM procedure for several of the indices. Some indices appear to provide little\ninformation beyond NDVI, implying that the only differences between the two indices are due to sensor noise or\nsome attribute that does not measurably affect plant growth. However, several indices exhibit the ability to predict\nfuture canopy growth, implying that they provide a useful measure of canopy stress.\nThe QM results clearly show that some indices, such as NDWI, provide information only at high values of NDVI.\nThis is consistent with previous studies that showed the relationship between NDWI and canopy water content\nimproved greatly when limiting the study to pixels with high canopy cover (Serrano, Ustin et al. 2000). Other\nindices, such as RG-ratio, appear to provide useful information on canopy chemistry across a wide range of canopy\nstructure.\nThe difference between the upper and lower quartile provides a quantitative estimate, in terms of yield, of the\npotential value of using a given index for crop management. For example, if fields below the lower quartile of RGratio could be managed and raised to the level of the upper quartile, then a potential gain of roughly 0.5 ton ha-1\ncould be realized. Yield gains of this magnitude would represent a significant increase in farmer income and\nregional productivity.\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

A procedure termed quantile\nmapping was developed to combine structural and chemical reflectance indices in an attempt to identify attributes of\ncanopy chemistry associated with stress. Some chemical indices were successful in identifying stress, as judged by\nthe ability to predict future growth estimated from late-season Landsat ETM+ imagery, while others were not. Of\nthose successful in predicting future growth, R-G ratio was successful at various levels of NDVI (canopy structure\nand extent) while NDWI was useful only at high values of NDVI. Moreover, these indices depicted stress in\ndifferent fields (not shown here), indicating that each index provides information on a unique aspect of canopy\nchemistry. Future work is needed to better quantify canopy stress from hyperspectral measurements, with careful\nattention to sources of reflectance variability other than canopy chemistry.\n5.0 REFERENCES\nAsner, G.
