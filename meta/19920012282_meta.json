Heat exchanger design and fabrication techniques, the handling of liquid hydrogen to achieve the greatest heat sink capabilities, and air decontamination to prevent heat exchanger fouling are discussed. It was concluded that technology needs to be extended in the areas of design and fabrication of heat exchangers to improve reliability along with weight and volume reductions. Catalysts need to be improved so that conversion can be achieved with lower quantities and lower volumes. Packaging studies need to be investigated both analytically and experimentally. Recycling with slush hydrogen needs further evaluation with experimental testing.", "title": "Liquid air cycle engines", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:14:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920012282, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rosevear, Jerry"}, "organization": {"name": "Marquardt Corp.", "location": "Van Nuys, CA, United States"}}, "id": "40045a597c4f4e54a0818bc9fe25b030"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920012282, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920012282, "id": "37b2fdb21e3a43c1a8da66b723a0133c", "publicationName": "NASA.
