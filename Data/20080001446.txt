Palmgren in 1947 established the primary relation between rolling-element\nbearing geometry and bearing life. Their analysis of ball and roller bearings did not consider the life of\nthe bearing\xe2\x80\x99s set of rolling elements independent of race life. The analysis in this report considers the life\nof the ball set as well as the respective lives of the races to reassess the effect of ball-race conformity on\nball bearing life. The related changes in ball bearing life are incorporated in life factors that can be used to\nmodify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO\nStandards. Two simple algebraic relationships were established to calculate life factors LFc to determine\nthe effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L10 life for deep-groove and\nangular-contact ball bearings, respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as\nconformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less\nthan that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact ball bearings, the life can\nvary between +16 and \xe2\x80\x9339 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Comparing\nthe two ball bearing types, the life factors LFc for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent\nlower than that for angular-contact ball bearings. The use of a fatigue limit from either the program\nASMELIFE or the proposed ISO 281:2006 standard can significantly overpredict bearing life over a\nrange of normal operating Hertz stresses, which can result in the selection of undersized bearings for a\nparticular application.\n\nNomenclature\na\nB\nb\nCD\nc\nD\nDir\nDor\nd\nde\ne\n\nsemimajor axis of contact ellipse, m (in.)\ntotal curvature, m (in.)\nsemi-minor axis of contact ellipse, m (in.)\ndynamic load capacity, N (lbf)\nstress-life exponent\ndistance between centers of curvature of inner and outer races, m (in.)\nraceway diameter at ball-race contact of inner race, m (in.)\nraceway diameter at ball-race contact of outer race, m (in.)\nball diameter, m (in.)\npitch diameter, m (in.)\nWeibull slope\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n1\n\nf\nfc, fcm\nh\ni\nK\nL\nL10\nL\xce\xb2\nLF\nlL\nN\nn\nPD\nPeq\nPmax\nPN\nPo\np\nr\nS\nSmax\nV\nw\nX\nZ\nZo\n\xce\xb2\n\xc2\xb5\n\xce\xbd\n\xcf\x84\n\xcf\x84\n\xcf\x84o\n\nconformity, percent or fractional percent\nbearing geometry and geometry coefficient\nexponent\nnumber of rows of balls\ngeometry-load constant\nlife, number of stress cycles or hr\n10-percent life or life at which 90 percent of a population survives, number of stress cycles or hr\ncharacteristic life or life at which 63.2 percent of population fails, number of stress cycles or hr\nlife factor\nrace track length, circumference of ring at ball contact, m (in.)\nlife, number of stress cycles\nHertz stress-life exponent\ndiametral clearance, m (in.)\nequivalent radial load, N (lbf)\nnormal load of maximum loaded ball in deep-groove ball bearing, N (lbf)\nnormal load on ball in angular-contact ball bearing, N (lbf)\nnormal load, N (lbf)\nload-life exponent\nrace-groove radius, m (in.)\nprobability of survival, fraction or percent\nmaximum Hertz stress, GPa (ksi)\nstressed volume, m3 (in.3)\nload-life exponent, w = pe\nratio of outer-race life to inner-race life, Lor/Lir\nnumber of balls in bearing\ndepth to the maximum orthogonal shearing stress, m (in.)\nfree contact angle\ntranscendental function from Hertz theory\ntranscendental function from Hertz theory\ncritical shearing stress, GPa (ksi)\nfatigue limit, GPa (ksi)\northogonal shearing stress, GPa (ksi)\n\nSubscripts:\nc\ni\nir\nm\nor\nre\n\nconformity\nith component\ninner race\nmodified based on race conformity\nouter race\nrolling element (ball)\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\nBy the close of the 19th Century, the bearing industry began to focus on sizing of bearings for\nspecific applications and determining bearing life and reliability. In 1896, R. Stribeck (ref. 1) in Germany\nbegan fatigue testing full-scale bearings. J. Goodman (ref. 2) in 1912 in Great Britain published formulae\nbased on fatigue data that would compute safe loads on ball and cylindrical roller bearings. In 1914, the\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Machinists Handbook and Dictionary of Shop Terms\xe2\x80\x9d (ref. 3), devoted 6 pages to rollingelement bearings that discussed bearing sizes and dimensions and recommended (maximum) loading at\nspecified speeds. However, the publication (ref. 3) did not address the issue of bearing life. During this\ntime, it would appear that rolling-element bearing fatigue testing was the only way to determine or predict\nthe minimum or average life of ball and roller bearings.\nIn 1924, A. Palmgren (ref. 4) in Sweden published a paper in German outlining his approach to\nbearing life prediction and an empirical formula based upon the concept of an L10 life or the time that\n90 percent of a bearing population would equal or exceed without failure. During the next 20 years he\nempirically refined his approach to bearing life prediction and matched his predictions to test data (ref. 5).\nHowever, his formula lacked a theoretical basis or an analytical proof.\nIn 1939, W. Weibull (refs. 6 and 7) in Sweden published his theory of failure. Weibull was a\ncontemporary of Palmgren and shared the results of his work with him. Palmgren in concert with G.\nLundberg, also of Sweden, in 1947 incorporated his previous work along with that of Weibull and what\nappears to be the work of V. Thomas and H. Hoersch (ref. 8) into what has become known as the\nLundberg-Palmgren theory (refs. 9 and 10). (In 1930, V. Thomas and H. Hoersch (ref. 8) at the University\nof Illinois, Urbana, developed an analysis for determining subsurface principal stresses under Hertzian\ncontact (ref. 11). Lundberg and Palmgren (refs. 9 and 10) do not reference the work of V. Thomas and H.\nHoersch (ref. 8 in their papers.)\nLundberg and Palmgren (refs. 9 and 10) established the primary relation between bearing geometry\nand bearing life. For ball bearings they related bearing life to five variables. These are ball diameter, pitch\ndiameter, inner- and outer-race conformities, number of balls, and contact angle. Except for bearing\ncontact angle, the relation between these parameters remains the same regardless of whether the bearing is\na deep-groove ball bearing or an angular-contact ball bearing. These relations have been incorporated into\nboth the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American National Standards\nInstitute (ANSI)/American Bearing Manufactures Association (ABMA) standards (ABMA was formerly\nAFBMA, Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers Association) for the load ratings and life of rollingelement bearings (refs. 12 to 14) as well as in current bearing codes to predict life.\nThe Lundberg-Palmgren equations only relate to the lives of the inner and outer races and incorporate\nball life into their analysis by inference (ref. 9). It has since been recognized (ref. 15) that the life of the\nball set in relation to the races is different for a deep-groove ball bearing and an angular-contact ball\nbearing as well as being dependent on the relative contact (Hertz) stresses at the inner and outer races. It\nis the objectives of the work reported herein to (a) consider the life of the ball set as well as the lives of\nthe respective races to reassess the effect of ball-race conformities on ball bearing life and (b) incorporate\nthe related changes in ball bearing life to life factors that can be used to modify the bearing predicted life\nusing the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and the ISO Standards.\n\nBall Bearing Geometry and Stresses\nBearing Geometry\nWhile there are several types of ball bearings, there are two common basic types. These are the deepgroove ball bearing (figs. 1 and 2(a)) that is designed to handle primarily radial loads and the angularcontact ball bearing (fig. 2(b)) designed to handle primarily thrust loads. These bearings comprise a\nplurality of balls interspersed between an inner and outer race and separated and positioned by a cage or\nseparator.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n3\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n4\n\nThe operating characteristics of a ball bearing are dependent its internal fitup measured by the\ndiametral clearance (PD) illustrated in the cross section schematic of figure 1(b) where\nPD = Dor \xe2\x80\x93 Dir \xe2\x80\x93 2d\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Dor and Dir are the raceway diameters at the ball-race contact of the outer and inner races,\nrespectively, and d is the ball diameter. While diametral clearance is generally used in conjunction with\nsingle row deep-groove ball bearings, it is applicable to angular-contact ball bearings where there is a\nrelation between diametral clearance PD, race curvatures rir and ror, and free contact angle \xce\xb2 (ref. 16)\n(fig. 2(b)).\nWhere PD = 0, the bearing pitch diameter is\n\nde =\n\nDor + D ir\n2\n\n(2)\n\nReferring to figure 2, the race conformity f is the ratio of the race-groove radius, or curvature, r to the\nball diameter d in a plane passing through the bearing axis and transverse to the raceway and expressed as\na percent or fractional percent (ref. 16) where\nf=\n\nr\nd\n\n(3a)\n\nThe race-groove radius, or curvature, can be expressed as\nr = \xc6\x92d\n\n(3b)\n\nThe distance between the centers of curvatures of two races in line contact with a ball is indicated by\nD in figure 2(a). It is a fixed quantity depending on race radii and ball diameter where\nD = (\xc6\x92or + \xc6\x92ir \xe2\x80\x93 1)d\nIf we let\nThen\n\n(4a)\n\nB = (\xc6\x92or + \xc6\x92ir \xe2\x80\x93 1)\n\n(4b)\n\nD = Bd\n\n(4c)\n\nThe quantity B is referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ctotal curvature\xe2\x80\x9d and is a measure of the conformity of the inner\nand outer races (ref. 16). The computation of deflection in ball bearings under load is dependent on the\nvalue of the total curvature B (ref. 16).\nFigure 2(b) is a schematic of a cross section of a ball in an angular-contact ball bearing showing a free\ncontact angle \xce\xb2. The free contact angle is the contact angle of the bearing without load being applied. It is\ndefined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe angle made by a line passing through the points of contact of the ball and both raceways\nwith a plane perpendicular to the axis of the bearing when both races are centered to each other and one\nrace is axially displaced with respect to the other without the application of measurable force (ref. 16).\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe free contact angle is determined by the diametral clearance, PD, and the total curvature B, where\ncos\xce\xb2 =\n\nor\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n2 Bd \xe2\x88\x92 PD\n2 Bd\n\nPD = 2Bd (1\xe2\x80\x93 cos \xce\xb2)\n5\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nContact (Hertz) Stress\nThe contact (Hertz) stresses at the respective races of a bearing are a function of the bearing\ngeometry, the normal load at the contact and the elastic properties of the bearing materials. Jones (ref. 16)\nrelates the Hertz contact theory for the stresses of nonconforming bodies in contact for both ball and roller\nbearings. From Jones (ref. 16), the following relations for the maximum Hertz stresses Smax at the inner\nand outer races of ball bearings can be derived:\nFor deep-groove ball bearings with a radial load only,\n\nS max or\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 2 4\n1 \xe2\x8e\xa4\n+ \xe2\x88\x92\nK \xe2\x8e\xa2\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 Dor d f or d \xe2\x8e\xa6\n=\n\xce\xbc\xce\xbd\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPmax\n\n1\n\n3\n\n(6a)\n\nfor the outer race, and\n\nS max ir\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 2 4 1 \xe2\x8e\xa4\n+ \xe2\x88\x92\nK\xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 Dir d f ir d \xe2\x8e\xa6\n=\n\xce\xbc\xce\xbd\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPmax\n\n1\n\n3\n\n(6b)\n\nfor the inner race.\nFor angular-contact ball bearings with a thrust load only,\n\nS maxor\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1\n2cos\xce\xb2\n4\n1 \xe2\x8e\xa4\n+ \xe2\x88\x92\nK \xe2\x8e\xa2\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 d e +d cos\xce\xb2 d f or d \xe2\x8e\xa6\n=\n\xce\xbc\xce\xbd\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPN\n\n1\n\n3\n\n(7a)\n\nfor the outer race and\n\nS max ir\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 2cos\xce\xb2\n4 1 \xe2\x8e\xa4\n+ \xe2\x88\x92\nK\xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 d e \xe2\x88\x92d cos\xce\xb2 d f ir d \xe2\x8e\xa6\n=\n\xce\xbc\xce\xbd\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPN\n\n1\n\n3\n\n(7b)\n\nfor the inner race.\nFor bearing steel on bearing steel, K = 1.58\xc3\x9710\xe2\x80\x933 for Smax in GPa and K = 23.58 for Smax in ksi. The\nvalues for the transcendental functions, \xc2\xb5 and \xce\xbd, vary with conformity f and can be found in reference 16.\nFrom the above equations, the conformities at the inner and outer races affect the resultant Hertz\nstresses and the lives of their respective raceways. The determination of life factors LFir and LFor based\non conformities for the inner and outer races, respectively, can be calculated by normalizing the equations\nfor Hertz stress for the inner and outer races to a conformity of 0.52 (the value of 0.52 was chosen as a\ntypical reference value). The change in stress for the same race diameter but varying the conformity is\ndetermined as a function of conformity.

Weibull (refs. 6 and 7) was the first to suggest a reasonable way to estimate material\nfracture strength with such a probability function. Based upon the work of Weibull, G. Lundberg and A.\nPalmgren (ref. 9) in 1947 showed that the probability of survival S could be expressed as a power\nfunction of the orthogonal shearing stress \xcf\x84o, life N, depth to the maximum orthogonal shear stress Zo, and\nstressed volume V of the race. That is\n\n1\nNe\nln ~ \xcf\x84 c\no hV\nS\nZo\n\n(9)\n\nFrom equation (1) and for a given value of S, the life L is\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1\nL= N ~\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\xcf\x84\n\xe2\x8e\x9d o\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\nc\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b1\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9c \xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9dV \xe2\x8e\xa0\n\n1\n\ne\n\n( Z o )h e\n\n(10)\n\nwhere for ball bearings the stressed volume of the race\n\nV = alL Z o\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n7\n\n(11)\n\nwhere a is the semimajor axis of the contact ellipse and lL is the race track length or circumference of the\nring at ball contact. The resultant variables in equations (9) and (11) are also shown in figure 3.\nLundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9) incorporated into their analysis a method and distribution function\ndeveloped by Weibull (refs. 6 and 7) for statistically describing the fatigue life of materials, referred to as\nthe two-parameter Weibull distribution function:\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b L\n1\nlnln = eln\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9c L\xce\xb2\nS\n\xe2\x8e\x9d\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f where 0 < L < \xe2\x88\x9e and 0 < S < 1\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\n(12)\n\nFrom equation (12), Lundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9) first derived the relationship between individual\ncomponent life and system life. A bearing is a system of multiple components, each with a different life.\nAs a result, the life of the system is different from the life of an individual component in the system. The\nL10 bearing system life, where 90 percent of the population survives, can be expressed as\n\n1\ne\nL10\n\n=\n\n1\ne\nL10ir\n\n+\n\n1\ne\nL10or\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the life of the rolling elements, by inference, is incorporated into the life of each raceway tacitly\nassuming that all components have the same Weibull slope e. In properly designed and operated rollingelement bearings, fatigue of the cage or separator should not occur and, therefore, is not considered in\ndetermining bearing life and reliability. From equations (12) and (13), Lundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9)\nderived the following relation:\n\xe2\x8e\x9bC\nL10 = \xe2\x8e\x9c D\n\xe2\x8e\x9c Peq\n\xe2\x8e\x9d\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\np\n\nFrom Lundberg-Palmgren (ref. 9), the load-life exponent p equals 3 for ball bearings.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n8\n\n(14)\n\nFormulas for the basic load capacity for ball bearings that derived from Lundberg and Palmgren\n(ref. 9) and incorporated into the ANSI/ABMA Standards (refs. 13 and 14) and the ISO Standards\n(ref. 12) are as follows:\nFor ball bearings with d \xe2\x89\xa4 25 mm and \xce\xb2 \xe2\x89\xa4 45\xc2\xb0,\nC D = f cm (i cos\xce\xb2 )0.7 Z\n\n2\n\n3 d 1. 8\n\n(15a)\n\n2\n\n3 d 1. 4\n\n(15b)\n\nFor ball bearings with d > 25 mm and \xce\xb2 \xe2\x89\xa4 45\xc2\xb0,\nC D = f cm (i cos\xce\xb2 )0.7 Z\n\nwhere fcm is the bearing geometry and material coefficient. Prior to 1990, the coefficient fcm was\ndesignated as fc (ref. 15). The bearing geometry including the race conformities is incorporated into this\ncoefficient.\nWhile Lundberg and Palmgren allow for calculating the effect of ball bearing race conformities into\ntheir life calculation, the standards and the bearing manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 catalogs generally normalize their\nvalues of fcm to conformities on the inner and outer races of 0.52 (52 percent). Representative values of fcm\nas a function of the year introduced by ANSI/ABMA are given in table II for representative bearing sizes,\nd cos\xce\xb2\nd cos\xce\xb2\n.

Again, the standards do not\ndistinguish between deep-groove (radially-loaded) and angular-contact (thrust-loaded) ball bearings nor\ndo they separate the effect of ball life from that of the raceway.\nTABLE II.\xe2\x80\x94REPRESENTATIVE VALUES OF ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARING GEOMETRY\nAND MATERIAL COEFFICIENT fcm IN ANSI/ABMA STANDARD 9 (REFS. 13 AND 14)\nFOR REPRESENTATIVE BALL BEARING SIZES BY YEAR INTRODUCED\n[Inner- and outer-race conformities are equal to 0.52.]\nBearing size,\nBearing geometry and material coefficient,a\nfcmb\nd cos \xce\xb2\n1960\n1972\n1978\n1990\n1985\nde\n(standards 12.1 and 12.2)\n46.75\n59.52\n46.75\n60.70\n60.70\n0.05\n(3550)\n(4520)\n(3550)\n(4610)\n(4620)\n55.57\n73.34\n55.57\n72.16\n72.69\n.10\n(4220)\n(5570)\n(4220)\n(5480)\n(5520)\n59.65\n84.41\n59.65\n77.56\n77.56\n.16\n(4530)\n(6410)\n(4530)\n(5890)\n(5890)\n59.65\n92.96\n59.65\n77.56\n79.14\n.22\n(4530)\n(7060)\n(4350)\n(5890)\n(6010)\n57.15\n100.08\n57.15\n74.27\n74.40\n.28\n(4340)\n(7600)\n(4340)\n(5640)\n(5650)\n53.33\n106\n53.33\n69.26\n69.26\n.34\n(4050)\n(8050)\n(4050)\n(5260)\n(5260)\n75.94\n62.94\n.40\n------------------(3670)\n(4780)\na\nValues of fcm are for use with SI units; those in parentheses are for use with English units.\nb\nPrior to 1990, fcm was designated as fc.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n9\n\nTABLE III.\xe2\x80\x94REPRESENTATIVE VALUES FOR ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARING GEOMETRY AND MATERIAL\nCOEFFICIENT fcm IN ANSI/ABMA STANDARD 12.1 AND 12.2 (REFS. 17 AND 18) FOR COMBINATIONS\nOF INNER- AND OUTER-RACE CONFORMITIES\nBearing geometry and material coefficient,a\nd cos \xce\xb2\nfcmb\nde\nInner-race conformity,\nfir\n0.515\n0.52\n0.52\n0.52\n0.53\n0.54\n0.54\n0.54\n0.57\nOuter-race conformity,\nfor\n0.515\n0.52\n0.53\n0.54\n0.54\n0.54\n0.56\n0.60\n0.57\n60.84\n56.62\n53.33\n49.51\n46.48\n43.45\n38.98\n37.79\n68.21\n0.05\n(5180)\n(4620)\n(4300)\n(4050)\n(3760)\n(3530)\n(3300)\n(2960)\n(2870)\n81.11\n72.63\n68.74\n65.58\n59.65\n55.30\n52.67\n48.59\n44.90\n.10\n(6160)\n(5520)\n(5220)\n(4980)\n(4530)\n(4200)\n(4000)\n(3690)\n(3410)\n86.91\n77.56\n75.32\n73.08\n64.92\n59.39\n57.67\n55.57\n48.19\n.16\n(6600)\n(5890)\n(5720)\n(5550)\n(4930)\n(4510)\n(4380)\n(4220)\n(3660)\n86.91\n79.14\n76.37\n75.06\n65.58\n59.39\n58.47\n56.62\n48.19\n.22\n(6600)\n(6010)\n(5800)\n(5700)\n(4980)\n(4510)\n(4440)\n(4300)\n(3660)\n83.52\n74.40\n73.74\n73.21\n63.21\n56.88\n56.49\n55.57\n42.22\n.28\n(6330)\n(5650)\n(5600)\n(5560)\n(4800)\n(4320)\n(4290)\n(4220)\n(3510)\n77.69\n69.26\n69.00\n68.74\n58.99\n52.93\n52.54\n52.41\n43.06\n.34\n(5900)\n(5260)\n(5240)\n(5220)\n(4480)\n(4020)\n(3990)\n(3980)\n(3270)\na\nValues of fcm are for use with SI units; those in parentheses are for use with English units.\nb\nPrior to 1990, fcm was designated as fc.\n\nResults and Discussion\nG. Lundberg and A. Palmgren in 1947 (ref. 9) established the primary relation between bearing\ngeometry and bearing life. For ball bearings they related bearing life to five variables. These are ball\ndiameter, pitch diameter, inner- and outer-race conformities, number of balls, and contact angle. Except\nfor bearing contact angle, the relation between these parameters remains the same regardless of whether\nthe bearing is a deep-groove ball bearing or an angular-contact ball bearing. These relations have been\nincorporated into both the ANSI/ABMA and the ISO Standards to predict bearing life as well as current\nlife prediction bearing codes (refs. 12, 13, 17, and 18). The Lundberg-Palmgren equation (ref. 9) only\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n10\n\nrelates to the lives of the inner and outer races and incorporate ball life into their analysis by inference. It\nhas since been recognized that the life of the ball set in relation to the races is different for a deep-groove\nball bearing and an angular-contact ball bearing as well as being dependent on the relative contact (Hertz)\nstresses at the inner and outer races (ref. 15).\n\nBall Set Life\nLundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9) do not directly calculate the life of the rolling-element (ball or roller)\nset of the bearing. However, through benchmarking of the equations with bearing life data by use of a\nmaterial-geometry factor fcm, the life of the rolling-element set is implicitly included in the life calculation\nof equations (15a) and (15b).\nThe rationale for not including the rolling-element set in equation (13) appears in the 1945 edition of\nA. Palmgren\xe2\x80\x99s book (ref. 5) wherein he states that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6the fatigue phenomenon which determines the life\n(of the bearing) usually develops on the raceway of one ring or the other. Thus, the rolling elements are\nnot the weakest parts of the bearing \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d. The database that Palmgren used to benchmark his and later the\nLundberg-Palmgren equations were obtained under radially loaded conditions. Under these conditions,\nthe life of the rolling elements as a system (set) will be equal to or greater than that of the outer race. As a\nresult, failure of the rolling elements in determining bearing life was not initially considered by Palmgren.\nHad it been, equation (13) would have been written as follows:\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9cL\n\xe2\x8e\x9d 10\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e \xe2\x8e\x9b 1 \xe2\x8e\x9e \xe2\x8e\x9b 1 \xe2\x8e\x9e \xe2\x8e\x9b 1\n\xe2\x8e\x9f =\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9c L \xe2\x8e\x9f + \xe2\x8e\x9c L \xe2\x8e\x9f +\xe2\x8e\x9c L\n\xe2\x8e\xa0 \xe2\x8e\x9d ir \xe2\x8e\xa0 \xe2\x8e\x9d re \xe2\x8e\xa0 \xe2\x8e\x9d or\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\ne\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the Weibull slope e is the same for each of the components as well as for the bearing as a system.\nComparing equation (16) with equation (13), the value of the L10 bearing life will be the same.\nHowever, the values of the Lir and Lor between the two equations will not be the same, but the ratio of\nLor/Lir will remain unchanged.\nThe fraction of failures due to the failure of a bearing component is expressed by Johnson (ref. 19) as\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 Lsys \xe2\x8e\xa4\nFraction of inner-race failures = \xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 Lir \xe2\x8e\xa6\n\ne\n\n(17a)\n\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 Lsys \xe2\x8e\xa4\nFraction of rolling-element failures = \xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 Lre \xe2\x8e\xa6\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 Lsys \xe2\x8e\xa4\nFraction of outer-race failures = \xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 Lor \xe2\x8e\xa6\n\ne\n\n(17b)\n\ne\n\n(17c)\n\nFrom equations (17a) to (17c), if the life of the bearing and the fractions of the total failures\nrepresented by the inner race, the outer race and the rolling element set are known, the life of each of\nthese components can be calculated. Hence, by observation, it is possible to determine the life of each of\nthe bearing components with respect to the life of the bearing.\nEquations (17a) to (17c) were verified using radially loaded and thrust-loaded 50-mm-bore ball\nbearings. Three hundred forty (340) virtual bearing sets totaling 31,400 bearings were randomly\nassembled and tested by Monte Carlo (random) number generation (ref. 20).

These results are shown in table IV. There is excellent agreement between\nthese techniques (ref. 20).\nFigure 5 summarizes rolling-element fatigue life data for ABEC 7 204-size angular-contact ball\nbearings made from AISI 52100 steel (ref. 21). The bearings had a free contact angle of 10\xc2\xb0. Operating\nconditions were an inner-ring speed of 10 000 rpm, an outer-ring temperature of 79 \xc2\xb0C (175 \xc2\xb0F), and a\nthrust load of 1108 N (249 lb). The thrust load produced maximum Hertz stresses of 3172 MPa (460 ksi)\non the inner race and 2613 MPa (379 ksi) on the outer race. From a Weibull analysis of the data, the\nbearing L10 life was 20.5 million inner-race revolutions or approximately 34.2 hr of operation (ref. 21).\nSeven of the twelve bearings failed from rolling-element fatigue. Two of the failed bearings had\nfatigue spalls on a ball and an inner race. Two bearings had inner-race fatigue spalls. Two bearings had\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n12\n\nfatigue spalls on a ball, and one bearing had an outer-race fatigue spall. Counting each component that\nfailed as an individual failure independent of the bearing, there were four inner-race failures, four ball\nfailures, and one outer-race failure for a total of nine failed components. Inner race failures were\nresponsible for 44.4 percent of the failures; ball failures, 44.4 percent; and outer-race failures,\n11.2 percent. Using each of these percentages in equations 17(a) to 17(c) together with the experimental\nL10 life, the lives of the inner and outer races and the ball set were calculated. For purposes of the\ncalculation, the Weibull slope e was assumed to be 1.11, the same as Lundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9). The\nresultant component L10 lives were 53 million inner-race revolutions (88.3 hr) for both the inner race and\nball set and 183.3 million inner-race revolutions (305.5 hr) for the outer race.\nFor nearly all rolling-element bearings the number of inner-race failures is greater than those of the\nouter race. Accordingly, from equations (17a) and (17c), the life of the outer race will be greater than that\nof the inner race. Zaretsky (ref. 15) noted that for radially loaded bearings (ball or roller), the percent of\nfailures of the rolling-element set was generally equal to and/or less than the outer race. For thrust-loaded\nball or roller bearings, Zaretsky (ref. 15) further noted that the percent of the rolling-element set was\nequal to or less than the inner race but more than the outer race. In order to account for material and\nprocessing variations, Zaretsky developed what is now referred to as Zaretsky\xe2\x80\x99s Rule (ref. 15) as follows:\nFor radially loaded ball and roller bearings, the life of the rolling element set is equal to or greater\nthan the life of the outer race. Let the life of the rolling element set (as a system) be equal to that of the\nouter race.\nFrom equation (16)\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9cL\n\xe2\x8e\x9d 10\n\ne\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e \xe2\x8e\x9b 1 \xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1\n\xe2\x8e\x9f =\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9c L \xe2\x8e\x9f + 2\xe2\x8e\x9c L\n\xe2\x8e\xa0 \xe2\x8e\x9d ir \xe2\x8e\xa0\n\xe2\x8e\x9d or\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\ne\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n\nLre = Lor\nFor thrust loaded ball and roller bearings, the life of the rolling element set is equal to or greater than\nthe life of the inner race but less than that of the outer race.

As previously stated, the\nresulting values for Lir and Lor from these equations are not the same as those from equation (13). They\nwill be higher.\nH. Takata (ref. 22), using a modified approach to the Lundberg-Palmgren theory (ref. 9), derived the\nbasic dynamic load capacity of the rolling-element bearing set in addition to those for the inner and outer\nraces for radial and thrust-loaded ball and roller bearings. For radially loaded ball bearings, Takata\n(ref. 22) assumes random ball rotation. For thrust-loaded ball bearings, he assumes a single or fixed\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n13\n\nrunning track on each ball. According to Takata (ref. 22), the basic dynamic load capacity CD of a bearing\nsystem can be expressed as\n\n(\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x88\x92\nC D = C irw + C rew + C orw\n\n)\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 1w\n\n(20)\n\nwhere CD is calculated from equations (15a) and (15b) (from Lundberg-Palmgren (ref. 9)), and exponent w\nis equal to 10/3 for ball bearings. Takata provides equations for calculating the dynamic load capacity of\nthe rolling-element (ball) set, Cre. The resulting values for Cir and Cor will be higher than those from the\nLundberg-Palmgren equations (ref. 9).\nTakata (ref. 22) performed a single ball-set life calculation within his paper for a 30-mm-bore deepgroove ball bearing. From this calculation he concluded that for this bearing\n\nCir < Cre < Cor\n\n(21a)\n\nLir < Lre < Lor\n\n(21b)\n\nThis would imply that\n\nHowever, he did not validate his example or his equations to determine ball-set or roller-set life with\na bearing life data base.\nHarris (ref. 23), citing Takata (ref. 22), compared the rolling-element fatigue life of 28.575-mm(1.125-in.-) diameter AISI 52100 and AISI M\xe2\x80\x9350 steel balls in a Pratt & Whitney one-ball fatigue tester.\nHe ran nine test series, each comprising 12 to 48 balls. The test balls had fixed double running tracks. The\nmaximum Hertz stress ranged from 3980 to 4160 MPa (577.2 to 603.3 ksi) with most tests run at\n4000 MPa (580.1 ksi). The number of rolling-element fatigue failures for each test series varied from 3 to\n36. He compared the test results to the Lundberg-Palmgren theory (ref. 9) and to a modified LundbergPalmgren theory (ref. 23) incorporating a \xe2\x80\x9cfatigue limit.\xe2\x80\x9d The fatigue limit that he used for his\ncalculations for both the AISI 52100 and AISI M\xe2\x80\x9350 steels was 175 MPa (25.4 ksi). He concluded that\nthe application of a fatigue limit to the modified Lundberg-Palmgren theory predicted ball lives in the\none-ball fatigue tester that correlated well with the measured ball lives. He further concluded that the\nLundberg-Palmgren life prediction method modified using currently accepted material-life and\nlubrication-life factors did not yield a satisfactory correlation.\nZaretsky, Anderson, and Parker (ref. 21) using the NASA five-ball fatigue tester and the Pratt &\nWhitney one-ball fatigue tester reported similar work to that of Harris (ref. 23). They also compared their\nexperimental results to the Lundberg-Palmgren dynamic load capacity equations derived for these two\ntest rigs. These comparisons are shown in figure 6. Unlike Harris (ref. 23), it was concluded from these\ndata that, for contact angles up to 30\xc2\xb0, the Lundberg-Palmgren capacity equations very nearly predict the\nthrust capacity for the two test systems. Further, unlike Harris, these results would justify\xe2\x80\x94although not\nverify\xe2\x80\x94the ball life prediction approach reported by Takata (ref. 22).\nIn a discussion of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s work (ref. 23), S. Pinel and F. Rehman attempted to verify Harris\xe2\x80\x99s\ncalculations for the Lundberg-Palmgren life predictions (ref. 23). The ratio of Pinel and Rehman\xe2\x80\x99s\npredicted L10 life based on Lundberg-Palmgren to the actual experimental life was 0.70 (ref. 23).

Knowing the bearing OD and ID,\ncalculate the pitch diameter de from equation (2). From these values, the ratio of the outer to inner race\nlives X can be calculated either from equation (20) or from an appropriate bearing computer program\nwhere the inner-and outer-race conformities are the same.\nFrom table I, life factors (LF) based on individual race conformities are obtained for both the inner\nand outer races. These LF values are normalized to a ball-race conformity (f) of 0.52. Depending on\nwhether the bearing is a deep-groove or angular-contact ball bearing, these values together with that for\nthe race-life ratio X are used in equations (26) or (29), respectively, to calculate bearing life factor LFc\nbased on the combined inner- and outer-race conformities. These values of LFc can then be applied\nagainst the bearing catalog life or the values calculated from equations (14), (15a), and (15b).\nFor the bearing series shown in figure 4 and summarized in table V, representative life factors were\ncalculated for deep-groove and angular-contact ball bearings using equations (26) and (29), respectively,\nwith race conformities ranging from 0.505 to 0.57. The conformity of one race was fixed at 0.52 and the\nother race was allowed to vary and vice versa. The results were normalized for the conformity\ncombination of 0.52 inner and 0.52 outer, where the resultant bearing life factor for conformity LFc is\nequal to 1. These results were compared to those generated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations from\nreference (ref. 9). The Lundberg-Palmgren equations are the same for deep-groove and angular-contact\nball bearings except for the inclusion of the cosine of the contact angle \xce\xb2. Where cos \xce\xb2 = 1, the results for\nthe two types of ball bearings are identical.\nTable VI shows a comparison of these life factors for extreme combinations of conformities for\nextremely light and heavy series ball bearings. The results for both bearing types are different from that\ncalculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as\nconformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less\nthan that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact ball bearings, the life can\nvary from 22 to \xe2\x80\x9339 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n17\n\nTABLE VI.\xe2\x80\x94COMPARISON OF LIFE FACTORS BASED ON COMBINATIONS OF BALL-RACE CONFORMITIES\nNORMALIZED TO INNER- AND OUTER-RACE CONFORMITIES OF 0.52\nBall bearing\nBall-race conformity\nBearing life factor for conformity,\nseries\nLFc\n(see table V\nDeep-groove ball bearing\nAngular-contact ball bearing\nInner race\nOuter race\nLundbergand fig. 4)\nPalmgren\nFrom\nChange from\nFrom\nChange from\nresults for\nequation (26)\nLundbergequation (29)\nLundbergdeep-groove\nPalmgren,\nPalmgren,\nand angularpercent\npercent\ncontact\nbearing\n(ref. 9)\nExtremely\n0.505\n0.52\n3.02\n2.22\n\xe2\x80\x9327\n3.37\n12\nlight\n.57\n.52\n.27\n.16\n\xe2\x80\x9341\n.17\n\xe2\x80\x9337\n.52\n.505\n1.14\n1.13\n\xe2\x80\x931\n1.07\n\xe2\x80\x936\n.52\n.57\n.65\n.41\n\xe2\x80\x9337\n.68\n5\nHeavy\n.505\n.52\n3.60\n3.49\n\xe2\x80\x933\n4.17\n16\n.57\n.52\n.26\n.17\n\xe2\x80\x9339\n.16\n\xe2\x80\x9339\n.52\n.505\n1.09\n1.06\n\xe2\x80\x933\n1.02\n\xe2\x80\x936\n.52\n.57\n.74\n.71\n\xe2\x80\x934\n.90\n22\n\nWhile the trend between bearing life factors are qualitatively similar, they are quantitatively different\nbetween the angular-contact ball bearings and the deep-groove ball bearings. Comparing the two bearing\ntypes, the life factors LFc for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 34 percent lower than that for\nangular-contact ball bearings.\n\nOther Bearing Life Methods\nFrom equation (10), Lundberg-Palmgren (ref. 9) have bearing life inversely proportional to the\northogonal shearing stress \xcf\x84o raised to the c/e power where\nL ~ 1/(\xcf\x84o )c/e\n\n(30a)\n\nFrom Lundberg and Palmgren (ref. 9) the value of c/e for ball bearings is 9.3. Lundberg and Palmgren\n(ref. 9) assumed that the orthogonal shearing stress \xcf\x84o is the critical stress related to and affecting rollingelement fatigue. However, other shearing stresses designated \xcf\x84 that are proportional to the maximum\nHertz stress, such as maximum shearing stress, octahedral shearing stress, and von Mises equivalent\nstress, are also related to and affect rolling-element fatigue. As a result, equation (30a) can be written as\nL ~ 1/(\xcf\x84 )c/e\n\n(30b)\n\nIncorporating a fatigue limit \xcf\x84l in equation (30b),\nL ~ 1/(\xcf\x84 \xe2\x80\x93 \xcf\x84l )c/e\n\n(30c)\n\nBackground\nIn recent years there has been a movement to incorporate the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cfatigue limit\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nLundberg-Palmgren equations (ref. 9). The fatigue limit as applied to ball and roller bearings is a shearing\nstress below which no rolling-element fatigue should occur. The concept of a fatigue limit for rollingelement bearings was proposed by Palmgren in 1924 (ref. 4). It was apparently abandoned by him first in\n1945 (ref. 5) and then again with Lundberg in 1947 (ref. 9). In 1985, Ioannides and Harris (ref. 24)\napplied Palmgren\xe2\x80\x99s concept of a fatigue limit to the Lundberg-Palmgren equations in the form shown in\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n18\n\nequation (31). The ostensible reason Ioannides and Harris used the fatigue limit was to replace the\nmaterial and processing life factors (ref. 15) that are used as life modifiers in conjunction with the bearing\nlives calculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations (ref. 15).\nThere are two problems associated with the use of a fatigue limit for rolling-element bearings. The\nfirst problem is that the form of equation (30c) may not reflect the presence of a fatigue limit but the\npresence of a compressive residual stress (ref. 15). The second problem is that there are no data in the\nopen literature that would justify the use of a fatigue limit for through-hardened bearing steels such as\nAISI 52100 and AISI M\xe2\x80\x9350. In fact, a paper presented by Tosha et al. (ref. 25), reporting the results of\nrotating beam fatigue experiments for through-hardened AISI 52100 steel at very low stress levels, shows\nconclusively that a fatigue limit does not exist for this bearing steel.\nRecent publications by the ASME (ref. 26) and the ISO (refs. 27 and 28) for calculating the life of\nrolling-element bearings include a fatigue limit and the effects of ball-race conformity on bearing fatigue\nlife. These methods do not, however, include the effect of ball failure on bearing life. The ISO method is\nbased on the work reported by Ioannides, Bergling, and Gabelli (ref. 29). The ASME method as contained\nin their proposed ASMELIFE software (ref. 26) uses the von Mises stress as the critical stress with a\nfatigue limit value of 684 MPa (99,180 psi). This corresponds to a Hertz surface contact stress of\n1140 MPa (165,300 psi). The ISO 281:2006 (ref. 28) method uses a fatigue limit stress of 900 MPa\n(130,500 psi), which corresponds to a Hertz contact stress of 1500 MPa (217,500 psi).\nThe concept of a fatigue limit load (bearing load under which the fatigue stress limit is just reached in\nthe most heavily loaded raceway contact) introduced in the proposed (revised) ISO rating methods is\nproportional to the fatigue limit stress raised to the 3rd power for ball bearings (point contact). These\ndiffering values of stress would result in a 128 percent higher load using ISO 281:2006 (ref. 28) than\nASMELIFE (ref. 26) below which no fatigue failure would be expected to occur.\nThe effect of using different values of fatigue limit or no fatigue limit on rolling-element fatigue life\nprediction is shown in table VII. This table summarizes the qualitative results obtained for maximum\nHertz stresses of 1379, 1724, and 2068 MPa (200, 250, and 300 ksi) for point contact using equation (30)\nfor Lundberg-Palmgren without a fatigue limit and equation (30c) for fatigue limits of 684 MPa\n(99,180 psi) (from ASMELIFE) and 900 MPa (130,500 psi) (from ISO 281:2006). The results are\nnormalized to a maximum Hertz stress of 1379 MPa (200 ksi) with no fatigue limit where the quotient of\nequation (30c) divided by equation (30b) is taken to the c/e power of 9.3 (taken from Lundberg and\nPalmgren). The effect of stressed volume was also factored into these calculations.\nTABLE VII.\xe2\x80\x94EFFECT OF FATIGUE LIMIT \xcf\x84 ON ROLLING-ELEMENT FATIGUE LIFE\nRelative lifeb,c\nFatigue limit,a\nMaximum Hertz stress,\n\xcf\x84l,\nMPa (ksi)\nMPa (ksi)\n1379 (200)\n1724 (250)\n2068 (300)\n0 (0), Lundberg-Palmgren (ref. 9)\n1\n0.134\n0.026\n684 (99.2), ASMELIFE (ref. 26)\n3152\n44.6\n11.9\xc3\x97106\n900 (130.5), ISO281\xe2\x80\x932006 (ref. 28)\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n4258\n23.3\xc3\x97106\na\nvon Mises stress.\nb\nIncludes effect of stressed volume.\nc\nNormalized to life at maximum Hertz stress of 1379 MPa (200 ksi) with no fatigue limit.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n19\n\nComparison of Results\nFigures 7 and 8 show the comparison of ball set life and race conformity on bearing life for radially\nloaded vacuum-arc-remelted (VAR) AISI 52100 steel, 60-mm-bore, ball bearings under pure radial and\nthrust loads.

For constant outer-race conformity,\nlife decreased by 93 percent when the inner-race conformity was varied from 52 to 57 percent. For\nconstant inner-race conformity, the calculated life decreased by 82 percent.\nFigures 7(b) and 8(b) show the calculated life results from classical Lundberg-Palmgren theory\n(ref. 9) and ISO 281 (ref. 12) with life factors but without ball set life for the radially and thrust-loaded\nbearings, respectively. For the radially loaded bearing with constant outer-race conformity (fig. 7(b)), life\ndecreased by 74 percent when the inner-race conformity was varied from 52 to 57 percent. For constant\ninner-race conformity, the calculated life decreased by 28 percent when the outer-race conformity was\nvaried from 52 to 57 percent. For the thrust-loaded bearing with constant outer-race conformity\n(fig. (8(b)), life decreased by 77 percent when the inner-race conformity was varied from 52 to\n57 percent. For constant inner-race conformity, the calculated life decreased by 39 percent when the\nouter-race conformity was varied from 52 to 57 percent.\nFigures 7(c) and 8(c) show the life results from classical Lundberg-Palmgren theory (ref. 9) factoring\nin ball set life using equations (26) and (29) with life factors. For the radially loaded bearing with constant\nouter-race conformity (fig. 7(c)), life decreased by 81 percent when the inner-race conformity was varied\nfrom 52 to 57 percent. For constant inner-race conformity, the calculated life decreased by 55 percent\nwhen the outer-race conformity was varied from 52 to 57 percent. For the thrust-loaded bearing with\nconstant outer-race conformity (fig. (8(c)), life decreased by 83 percent when the inner-race conformity\nwas varied from 52 to 57 percent. For constant inner-race conformity, the calculated life decreased by\n27 percent when the outer-race conformity was varied from 52 to 57 percent.\nComparing the results from classical Lundberg-Palmgren theory (ref. 9) and ISO 281 (ref. 12) to\nthose from ASMELIFE (ref. 26), for a radially loaded bearing at inner- and outer-race conformities of\n52 percent, ASMELIFE calculated a life 17,175 percent greater than that obtained from LundbergPalmgren and ISO 281 with life factors. For a thrust-loaded bearing with inner- and outer-race\nconformities of 52 percent, ASMELIFE calculated a life 385 percent greater than that obtained from\nLundberg-Palmgren and ISO 281 with life factors.\nAt inner-race conformity of 57 percent and outer-race conformity of 52 percent for a radially-loaded\nbearing, ASMELIFE calculated a life 4,235 percent greater than that obtained from Lundberg-Palmgren\nand ISO 281 with life factors. For a thrust-loaded bearing, this amount was 49 percent. At inner-race\nconformity of 52 percent and outer-race conformity of 57 percent for the radially loaded bearing,\nASMELIFE calculated a life 188 percent greater than that obtained from Lundberg-Palmgren and ISO\n281 with life factors. For the thrust-loaded bearing, this amount was 42 percent.\nWhen comparing results calculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren theory (ref. 9) incorporating ball set\nlife (figs. (7(c) and 8(c)) to those that did not (figs. 7(b) and 8(b)), the lives at inner- and outer-race\nconformities of 52 percent are assumed to be equal for the specified operating condition. As the\nconformity is increased, differences in life emerge as a result of ball set life. At conformities greater than\n52 percent, including the life of the ball set results in a lower life prediction than that obtained from the\nLundberg-Palmgren equations (figs. 7(b) and (c)). At an inner-race conformity of 52 percent and outerrace conformity of 57 percent for the radially loaded bearing (fig. 7), the life of the bearing considering\nball set life is 36 percent less than that calculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations without ball set\nlife. At an outer-race conformity of 52 percent and inner-race conformity of 57 percent for a radially\nloaded bearing (fig. 7), the life of the bearing with ball set life is 25 percent less than that calculated from\nthe Lundberg-Palmgren equations without ball set life.\nFor the thrust-loaded bearing (figs. 8(b) and (c)) at inner-race conformity of 52 percent and outer-race\nconformity of 57 percent, the calculated life of the bearing factoring in ball set life (fig. 8(c)) is 19 percent\nless than calculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations without ball set life (fig. 8(b)). At outer-race\nconformity of 52 percent and inner-race conformity of 57 percent, the life of the bearing factoring in ball\nset life (fig. 8(c)) is 27 percent less than calculated from the Lundberg-Palmgren equations without ball\nset life (fig. 8(b)).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942007-213635\n\n23\n\nUnder the range of stresses examined, the use of a fatigue limit would suggest that (for most\noperating conditions under which a ball bearing will operate) the bearing will not fail from classical\nrolling-element fatigue. Realistically, this does not occur. The use of a fatigue limit from either\nASMELIFE (ref. 26) or ISO 281:2006 (ref. 28) will significantly over predict bearing life over a range of\nnormal operating Hertz stresses. (The use of ISO 281:2006 in these calculations would result in a bearing\nlife approaching infinity.) Since the predicted lives of rolling-element bearings are high, the problem can\nbecome one of undersizing a bearing for a particular application.\n\nSummary of Results\nG. Lundberg and A. Palmgren in 1947 established the primary relation between bearing geometry and\nbearing life. These relations have been incorporated into both the ANSI/ABMA and the ISO Standards to\npredict bearing life as well as current life prediction bearing codes. The Lundberg-Palmgren equations\nonly relate to the lives of the inner and outer races and incorporate ball life into their analysis by\ninference. It has since been recognized that the life of the ball set in relation to the races is different for a\ndeep-groove ball bearing and an angular-contact ball bearing as well as being dependent on the relative\ncontact (Hertz) stresses at the inner and outer races. The analysis reported herein considers the life of the\nball set as well as the respective lives of the races and to reassess the effect of ball-race conformity on ball\nbearing life. The related changes in ball bearing life are incorporated in life factors that can be used to\nmodify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO\nStandards. The following results were obtained:\n1. Two simple algebraic relationships that incorporated ball set life were established to calculate life\nfactors (LFc) incorporating ball set life to determine the effect inner- and outer-race conformity\ncombinations have on bearing L10 life for deep-groove and angular-contact ball bearings,\nrespectively.\n2. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the calculated life\nfor deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the LundbergPalmgren equations. For an angular-contact ball bearing, the life can vary from 16 to \xe2\x80\x9339 percent\nfrom that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations.\n3. The trend between bearing life factors are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different\nbetween angular-contact and the deep-groove ball bearings. Comparing the two bearing types, the\nlife factors LFc for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for\nangular-contact ball bearings.\n4. The use of a fatigue limit from either ASMELIFE or ISO 281:2006 can significantly overpredict\nbearing life over a range of normal operating Hertz stresses, which can result in the selection of\nundersized bearings for a particular application.\n\nReferences\n1.

ABSTRACT\n\nThe analysis in this report considers the life of the ball set as well as the respective lives of the races to reassess the effect of ball-race\nconformity on ball bearing life. The related changes in ball bearing life are incorporated in life factors that can be used to modify the bearing\npredicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO Standards. Two simple algebraic relationships were\nestablished to calculate life factors LFc to determine the effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L10 life for deepgroove and angular-contact ball bearings, respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the\ncalculated life for deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For\nangular-contact ball bearings, the life can vary between +16 and -39 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations.\nComparing the two ball bearing types, the life factors LFc for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for\nangular-contact ball bearings.\n15.
