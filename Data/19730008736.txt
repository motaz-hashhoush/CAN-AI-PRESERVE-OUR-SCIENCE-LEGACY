Sixteen Return Beam Vidicon (REV) images and 15\nMulti-Spectral Scanner (MSS) images were studied. These covered deserts and semidesert areas in southwestern Bolivia, northwestern Argentina, northern Chile, and southeastern Peru from July 30 to November\n0\n0\n17,1972. The study area is bounded by latitudes 16 30\' and 27 0 30\' South and by longitudes 66 30\'\n0\nand 70 30\' West. During the first 4 months after launching, high-quality cloud-free imagery was obtained\nover approximately 90 percent of the region of interior drainage, or a total area of about 170,000 square\nmiles.\n\nFeatures interpreted from the images include: (1) principal types of salt crusts\xc2\xb7 on major salars (saltencrusted playas), some of which are subject to modification by seasonal floodwaters; (2) extent of floodwaters and lakes on the floors of more than 120 closed basins, thus providing a basis for more accurate\nmapping of hydrologic features in the central Andes; (3) prominent former lake shores of Pleistocene\nlakes; (4) mid-winter Sll<)W cover in the high Andes, data essenti 1 to the appraisal of water resources and\nrunoff; (5) volcanoes and volcanic craters numbering more than 500 in the study area, of which 13 are\nreportedly active and many believed to be associated with phwa-typc: borate deposits and sulfur deposits;\nand (6) major faults such as the Atacama fault and other prominent geologic structures.\nNo single source of data previously has permitted identification of all of these features, and observation on synoptic snow cover was not possible prior to ERTS. ERTS thus provides an invaluable data\nbase for earth resources surveys and development in this large and relatively undeveloped area.\n\n* Publication authorized by Director, U.S. GeologiCal Survey.\n\n74\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\\n\nPaper W 2\n\nDETECTION OF MAJOR RIVER BED CHANGES IN THE RIVER EBRO\n(NORTH-EASTERN SPAIN)\n\nR.

These relate to the delimination of national reserves and to\nthe iden tification of antiquities. Examples of these are given too.\nThe satellite da ta are particularly valuable also because their repetitive coverage gives an insigh t in the\ngradual transformation of changing features such as the extent of flooding and moisture retention in various\nsoil types. Furthermore the availability ofsatel\\ite imagery is most timely as it fills gaps in basic data necessary for completion of development plans for the Mekong basin. These, in turn, are urgently needed, in\norder to finalize a realistic post-war development program for the Basin.\n\n76\n\nPaper W 4\n\nPRELIMINARY TEST OF ERTS-1 IMAGERY FOR IMPROVING DEFINITION OF\nNATURAL STREAMFLOW\n\nEste F. Hollyday, Water Resources Division, U. S. Geological Survey, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nABSTRACT\nHistorical streamflow data, which were routinely collected at gaging stations, have been\ntransferred to ungageu sites with varying degrees of success by relating statistical flow parameters to physiographic characteristics of a drainage basin. The basin characteristics that are\nmost easily extracted by automated techniques from ERTS-l imagery include open water,\ninfrared-reflecting vegetarion, snow, and massed works of man. In preliminmy tests, using\ntwo small basins in the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland and Delaware, the percent of basin\nareas occupied by open water and infrared-reflecting vegetation was determined from ERTS\nimagery and checked by aerial photography. The two basins, which were selected from a\ngroup of about 20, represent extremes in their hydrologic response to precipitation. The\n. percent of basin areas was correlated with the residuals of multiple-regression equasions that\xc2\xb7\nwere developed to relate streamtlow characteristics to basIn characteristics that, in part, were\nmeasured from topographic maps. Results of this correlation were encouraging; however, a\nmore thorough test is needed.\n\n~\'..\n. \'\\\n\nr\n!\n\n,\n\ni\n\n...,......____. __....________ .. __ .. __ .. __.__ ~._.\n\n177\n\nI\n__ . ____________ . _ _ _ _ _ _ ._ _ _ _ ---.l\n\nPaper W 5\n\nAPPLICATION OF ERTS-1 IMAGERY TO FLOOD INUNDATION MAPPING*\n\nGeorge R. Hallberg and Bernard E. Hoyer, Iowa Geological Survey Remote Sensing\nLaboratory and Albert Rango, National Ahronautics and Space Administration, Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn September, 1972, heavy rains initiated major flooding in southwestern Iowa, concentrated in the East and West Nishnabotna basins. The flood crest moved downstream between September 11-15. A cooperative program to evaluate the possibility of mapping flood\ninundation using remote sensing tec1miques \\vas initiated jointly by the Iowa Geological\nSurvey, Remote Sensing Laboratory (IGSRSL), and the U. S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division. Ground data and a variety of low altitude multispectral imagery was acquired for the East Nis1mabotna River on September 14-15. This successful effort concluded\nthat a near-visible infrared sensor could map inundated areas in late summer for a.t least two\n. days after flood recession. FRTS-1 imagery of the area was obtained on September 18-19.Analysis of MSS imagery by IGSRSL, USGS, and NASA reinforced the conclusions of the\nlow altitude study while increasing the time period critical for imagery acquisition to at least\nseven days following flood recession. The capability of satellite imagery to map late summer\nflooding at a scale of 1: 250,000 is exhibited by the agreement of interpreted flood boundaries obtaint:\'d from ERTS-1 imagery to boundaries mapped by low altitude imagery and\nground methods. The synoptic coverage of ERTS-l allowed extension of the flood mapping\nto the West Nishnabotna River. Satellite ima\'gery allows rapid appraisal of the areal extent of\nflood inundation for the entire liver systems. This satellite flood mapping should prove\nvaluable to federal and state ;tgencies involved in regional floodplain management and\nplanning.\n\n*Publication authorized by the Director of the Iowa Geological Survey.\n\n78\n\n..\n\nPaper W 6\n\nASSESSMENT OF FLOOD DAMAGE IN ARIZONA BY MEANS OF ERTS-1\nIMAGERY\nRoger B, Morrison, U. S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado\n\nABSTRACT\nERTS-1 MSS images clearly show two important effects of a large flood in southeastern\nArizona - the extent of inundation and the areas affected by severe sediment deposition and\nerosion - although the images were made a week and a half after the flood. On October\n20 and 21, 1972, the upper Gila River had its second-largest flood on record. Peak flows\nattained about 42,000 and 82,000 cubic feet a second at Duncan and Safford, Arizona, respectively. Six lives were lost, hundreds of people made homeless, and more than 10,000\nacres of cropland inundated.\n.\n\':fhe first ERTS-l images after the flood were made on November 1 and 2. The inundated area is best displayed on the infrared bands, particularly on band 7, where it appears\nas a belt along the river that is distinctly darker than the adjoining flood plain. This dark\nbelt does not appear on ERTS images that pre-date the flood. Presumably the low infrared\nreflectance of this belt is caused by still-moist soil. Inundation limits mapped from the\nERTS imagery agree well with those obtained by aerial photography during the flood and by\nground surveys. Areas of severe sand and gravel deposition and of local strong erosion show\non band 5. By comparing before-and-after-flood images on this band, a quick assessment can\nbe made of the severely f1ood-ravaged land.-\n\n79\n\n.\'paper W 7\n\nUSE OF THE SRI SATELLITE IMAGE ANALYZER CONSOLE FOR MAPPING\nSOUTHERN ARIZONA PLANT COMMUNITIES FROM ERTS-1 IMAGERY\n\nRaymond M.

Schumann, U. S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Phoenix, Arizona\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Verde River watershed of central Arizona furnishes municipal, industrial and agricultural water\nto the Salt River Valley - an area that contains more than half of Arizona\'s population and about one-fourth\nof the State\'s irrigated land. Water management decisions related to the operation oflarge multiple.use\nreservoirs require accurate and continuous monitoring of moisture conditions over large remote areas.\n111e U. S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Salt River Project installed a specially designed\ngaging station on the Verde River near the town of Camp Verde to evaluate near-real time streamflow data\nfurnished by the ERTS-l Data Collection System (DCS). On November 3, 1972, this installation was equipped with a Stevens digital water-level recorder, modified for telemetry, and an ERTS-l data collection\nplatform operating in the digital-paraliel mode. During the 43-day period between November 3 and December 15, 1972, the DCS relayed 552 transmissions during 193 data passes. The DCS system transmitted\nstream stage information 4.5 times per day on the average. The amount of data received far exceeded the\nexpected single high quality transmission rate of once per 12-hour period from the DeS system.\nThe digital-paralld ERTS-l Data Collection System has furnished data sufficient to accurately compute mean daily gage heights. These, in turn, are used to compute the average daily streamflow rates during\nstable or slowly changing flow conditions. The digital-parallel DCS data has also furnished useful information\nduring peak flow periods. However, the serial-digital DCS capability, currently under development for transmitting streamflow data, should provide data of greater uiility for determining times of flood peaks.\n\n81\n\nPaper W 9\n\nPRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ERTS RELAYED WATER RESOURCES DATA IN\nTHE DELAWARE RIVER BASIN*\n\nRichard W.

Geological Survey, Miami, Florida\n\nABSTRACT\nERTS MSS Imagery coupled with Data Collection Platforms (DCP\'s) relaying virtual\nreal time data provides t~le potential for optimum water-resource conservation and utilization\nin south Florida. Limited information gained from ERTS-l suggests implementation of a\nprototype Water Resource Model capable of: (1) Disseminating data to the agencies responsible for maintaining an adequate water supply to the 2 million coastal ridge inhabitants; (2)\nDelineating the distribution of existing waters stored in the 1,400-square-mile Central and\nSouthern Florida Flood Control District; (3) Quantifying the essential elements in the hydrologic cycle; and (4) Providing the basis for preserving the diverse but delicate Everglades\naquatic communities.\nNew and existing DCP\'s relaying rainfall, water-levels, wind velocity and specific electrical conductance of water to the USGS via ERTS-l will allow determination of south\nFlorida water, and weather, and ecologic model feasibilities. Dissemination of data will provide the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District with an opportunity for daily\nwater-management capability decisions. Sophistication of an experimental Water Resource\nManagement Model up to an annual prototype operational water management budget will\nallow Federal (Nationai Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S. Army Corps of\nEngineers), State (Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District, Fish and Game,\nDepartment of Natural Resources), and County (Dade and Broward public water supply)\nagencies to avert crisis negotiation for the seasonally limited water resources. A more accurate water resource model is the critical planning need in south Florida with choice of\nalternative storage techniques hinging on the exact quantity and duration of the seasonal\nsurplus. Preservation of sensitive hydrobiological communities in the Everglades National\nPark is a primary concern.\n\n83\n\nPaper W 11\n\nAN EVALUATION OF SPACE ACQUIRED DATA AS A TOOL FOR\nMANAGEMENT OF WILDLIFE HABITAT IN THE STATE OF ALASKA\n\nBill J.

"Multispectral\n(12S) photographic data were acquired in an adjunctive effort, and subjected to the same\nanalyses ?-nd interpretation as ERTS data.\n\nIt was concluded that ERTS data, with adequate verification from quadrat in situ\nsampling, could be extrapolated to describe accurately the vegetative characteristics of\nscenes far removed from the sample site.\nHydrologic data - surface acres of water - were immediately obtainable for a delta area\ncontaining thousands of small ponds important to wildlife and the production of waterfowl.\nMinimum pond size measurable from ERTS data was approximately 5 acres.\nThe application of the two techniques has great potential for developing accurate vegetation and hydrologic maps for millions of square miles in Alaska.\nMultispectral photography (12S) has not yet been compared with ground data to ascertain its adequacy as a substitute for the ground acquired data now considered essential to\ninterpretation of ERTS data.\n\'1\n\n84\n\nPaper W 12\n\nPRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF ERTS-1 FOR DETERMINING NUMBERS AND\nDISTRIBUTION OF PRAIRIE PONDS AND LAKES\nC-l\\\'id S.

Numbers and distribution of wetlands (prairie ponds and lakes) in the primary\nbreeding areas during the spring and summer provides an index to waterfowl production. The\nBureau conducts annual surveys to determine waterfowl habitat conditions and makes periodic regional wetland inventories to assess the long-term changes in this resource. To improve\nthe accuracy and speed of these inventories the use of satellite borne sensors and associated\ndata processing techniques are being investigated. ERTS-l and aircraft milltispectral data\ncollected over a North Dakota test site during July 1972 are compared to evaluate the capability of the satellite sensors to detect numbers and distribution of wetlands of various sizes.\nDigital maps of wetlands processed from satellite and aircraft scanner imagery and photographic products are presented.\n\n85\n\nPaper W 13\n\nDYNAMICS OF PLAYA LAKES IN THE TEXAS HIGH PLAINS\n\nC. C.

Storm paths and runoff collected by such lake basins can also\nbe closely monitored, the accuracy dependent on periodicity of the orbits. Study of the\nrelationships between spectral differences (obtained from ERTS-l imagery) and the water\nbalance ecosystem of the lake basins is in a preliminary stage. However, examination of\nERTS-l MSS frames show that Band 4 has the poorest tonal contrast in semi-arid area West\nTexas, Band 5 is best for definition of vegetation, Band 6 is best for defining large water\nareas, and Band 7 is best for counting small lake basins with water.\nGround-truth studies reveal significant differences between the test sites, the relative\nimportance of which will be reflected by the hydrologic balance of each lake basin.\n\n,\n\n86\n\nPaperW14\n\nHYDROLOGIC STUDIES IN THE LAKE ONTARIO BASIN USING HIGH ALTITUDE\nAND ERTS-1 IMAGERY\'\n\nA. Falconer, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Lake Ontario Test Site includes areas of both land and water. Studies of high altude and ERTS-l imagery show that intlow from the Niagara River and underwater discharge from effluent pipes can be delineated. Because these features are dynamic, the collection of adequate ground data for interpretative studies is very difficult. The hnagery\nprovides synoptic data of eph~meral features and the high altitude imagery is being used to\ndefine some surface movements of the lake. Sun glint on the RB-57 imagery has been used\nto define upwelling along the northern shore and the sequential photography resulting from\nsuccessive flight paths allows the calculation of rates of movement in such features. Study\nof internal wave patterns revealed on RB-57 imagery is continuing but no internal waves\n.\nhave been detected on available ERTS imagery.\nOver the land area of the test site, attempts to model the behavior of river basins have\ndefined a requirement for soil moisture measurements and a definition of vegetation cover.\nRB-57 imagery has been used for vegetation mapping and measurements of soil moisture\nstatus appears possible. Soil moisture measurement is complicated by the effect of land use\nand soil type. Variability of the high altitude imagery is a further complicating factor. Correction of image density over the area of the test site has been achieved by fitting smoothing\nfunctions. Studies of soil types in the laboratory and in the field using various sensors and\nscales of resolution have defined the role played by soil parent material and landforms. High\naltitude data are being used to define land use, soil type, and landform regions. In a limited\ntest area the corrected image density values have been cOlTeiated with moisture status and the\nregional scale use of this is being examined with reference to ERTS-l data. As a bi-product\nfrom hydrologic studies the interpretation procedure gives regional scale land use data, soil\nmaps, and physiographic information.\n\n87\n\nPaperW15\n\nPROGRESS OF AN ERTS-1 PROGRAM FOR LAKE ONTARIO AND ITS BASIN\n\nFabian C.

The results of this research are contributing to the objectives of the International Field Year for the Great Lakes (IFYGL)an intensive synoptic study of the 32,000 sq mile Lake Ontario Basin designed to increase our understanding of a major lake system and the techniques required to\nmanage it.\nIn addition to conventional image interpretation of the MSS data, eight contiguous\nERTS frames, obtained in mid-August 1972, are being precessed for enhancement and\nclassification of significant hydrological and limnological features. Processing to date\nincludes level slicing, ratioing of spectral bands, and classification of features. The\nadditional information available from processed data, are being primarily directed to the\nevaluation of elements of the terrestrial water balance, but important sedimentation and\nwater movement properties may also be observed and charted from these data.\nRapid processing of ERTS data by analog computer techniques are expected to\nmake the periodic enhancement and classification of the large amount of ERTS data\n(8 frames) economically feasible.\n\n88\n\nPaper W 16\n\nREMOTE SENSING OF TURBIDITY PLUMES IN LAKE ONTARIO\nEdward J.

Lyons and Steven R. PeasE, College of Engineering and Applied Science,\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201\n\nABSTRACT\nWith the launching of Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-l) in July 1972, a powerful new\ntool for studying mesoscale atmospheric phenomena associated with the Great Lakes has come on the scene.\n\nIt has been found possible to discriminate air pollution patterns from large sources of suspended particulates. Plumes from m:Jjor steel mill operations in the Chicago-Gary-Hammond area can be seen spreading in\nsouthwest flow over lake Michigan for over 50 nm. The excellent background provided by water in the near\ninfrared makes for optimum viewing. COTI"/ersely, over land even very depse smoke plumes become difficult\nto distinguish from terrain.\nComparison of same area viewed at dlfferent portions of the spectrum allows the detection and identification\'of cirriform clouds. At shorter wavelengths (0.5-0.6 micrometers) cirrostratus layers might appear a\ntotal undercast. Yet in the near infrared (0.S-1.1) almost complete penetration to the underlying features is\nfound. Denser clouds, such as altocumulus, stratus, cumulus, etc., do not exhibit this characteristic at all.\nIn a similar manner, views of the Toronlo area under cloudless but hazy conditions, reveal the marked\nhaze penetrating characteristics of the near infrh.-ed. Reconstructed color infrared views (made by combination of the three longer wavelength bands) reveal sharp ground features almost totally obscured by haze and\npollutants in the "green" band (0.5-0.6 micrometers).\nSnoW cover is readily apparent in ERTS images. A localized record early season (October IS) lake\nsnow squall in the south-Chicago and HammonJ, Indiana region produced a well defined path through the\nmetropolitan Chicago area. Though depth determination is difficult (maximum 4" in tIus case), such images\ncan clearly reveal freshly deposited lake snow squall swatIls as soon as the skies clear.\nAircraft condensation trails also aopear in several phptographs, including one witl1 a peculiar circular\nshape.\nSummer lake phenomena, such as lake breeze fronts are ideally studied. Even the smallest cumulus\nelements are resolved. During an all-shore lake breeze over Lak~s Erie and Ontario, the cloud-free zon\\:: extcnded almost uniformly inland around the perimeter of the lakes. Smaller lakes and reservoirs also show\nmarked cloud suppression. Cloud streets on downwind shorelines show great similarity to laboratory\nstudies of cold fluids advecting over heated plates, including Benard cell type patterns.\nSeveral s~ts of simultaneous views of cloud patterns from ERTS and all-sky cloud cameras are compared.\nThese are helpful in showing the extremely high resolution of the satellite, as well as the horizontal viewing\nrangc with tIle lens filter combination used.\n\n90\n\n\\.\n\nf7~ ,/027 V\n~\n\nPaper W 18\n\n.- . . . . ... _---,\n_\n\nUSE OF ERTS DATA FOR MAPPING SNOW COVER IN THE WESTERN UNITED\nSTATES\n\nJames C. Barnes, Environmental Research and Technology, Inc., Lexington, Massachusetts\n02173\n\nABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the application of ERTS data for mapping snow cover,\nprimarily in the mountainous areas of the western United States. The specific objectives are to determine\nthe spectral interval most suitable for snow detection, to determine the accuracy with which snow lines can\nbe mapped in comparison with the accuracies attainable from other types of measurements, and to develop\ntec1miqu:!s to differentiate reLably between snow and clouds and to understand the effects of terrain and\nforest cover on snow detection. Snow cover is a water resource for which spacecraft observation holds great\npromise. The results of this study will provide the hydrologist with interpretive techniques that will enable\ndata from futUre operational sltellite systems to be used to map snow on a more cost effective basis.\nPreliminary results of the analysis of ERTS-l data indicate that snow cover can be detected in the\nMSS-4 (0.5 to 0.6 ,um) bands by its high reflectance compared to\xc2\xb7 that of the surrounding snow-free terrain.\nSnow can generally be distinguished from clouds because of weil-defined boundaries as compared with the\nless-distinct cloud edges, the lack of shadows characteristic of clouds and pattern confiugrations that fit\nclosely with higher eleva tions and terrain features. At higher latitudes where repetitive ERTS coverage\noccurs, snow can also be idcnUied by the day-to\xc2\xb7day continuity of the patterns. In the longer wavelengths,\nparticularly the MSS-7 (O.S to 1.1 pm) band, the contrast betwecn snow and snow-free terrain is much lower,\nand, thus, snow is more difficult to detect.\nIn several mountain area:;, including the Southern Sierra Nevada, the White Mountains, the Olympic\nMountains, the Mt. Rainier area, and the central Arizona Mountains, snow lines have been mapped from\nERTS pictures from the fall and early winter. Changes in snow line elevation are clearly evident in data\ncollected on different dates. In ERTS data from the Arctic, considerable detail is evident in glaciers located\nalong the cast and west coasts of Greenland. Detectable features include imbedded sediment trails (medial\nmoraines) and crevassed areas. Significant differences are.also apparent in the various spectral bands. Several glaciers exhibit a uniform reflectance in the MSS-4 band, whereas in the MSS-7 band, the lower elevation portions appear much darker than the upper portions. This difference in rcflectance is believed to\nbe due to the existence of meltwater on the surface of the glacier at lower elevations in contrast to snow\ncover at the higher elev-ations.\n\n____ .~_.J\n91\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2... ~\n......\n\n~.\n\nPaper W 19\n\nEVALUATE ERTS IMAGERY FOR MAPPING AND DETECTION OF CHANGES OF\nSNOWCOVF.R ON LAND AND ON GLACIERS\nMark F. Meier, U. S. Geological Survey, Tacoma, Washington\n\nABSTRACT\nThe percentage of snowcover area on specific drainage basins was measured from ERTS\nimagery with the Stanford Research Institute console. Basin outlines were electronically\nsuperimposed on imagery, and video density slicing used to measure areas. For a basin with\n22.6 percent \'~nowcover, results were repeatable to within 4 percent of the snow-covered\narea. Data from five ERTS and U-2 images of the melt season snowcover in the Thunder\nCreek drainage basin in the North Cascade Range were combined with existing hydrologic\nand meteorologic observations to enable calculation of the space and time distribution of the\nwater stored in this mountain snowpack. Knowledge gained from this model can then be\nused in subsequent years to forecast meltwater runoff during the critical late summer period.\nSimilar data could be used for frequent updating of expected inflow to reservoirs if similar\nsatellite data were available in the future.\nSnow-covered area and snowline altitudes were also determined by enlarging ER TS\nimagery to 1: 250,000 and using a transparent map overlay. Under favorable conditions,\nshowline altitude was determined to an accuracy of about 60Mm. Ability to map snowcover\nor to detemrine snowline altitude depends primarily on cloud cover and vegetation and\nsecondarily on slope, terrain roughness, sun angle, radiometric fidelity, and amount of\nspectral information available.\nGlacier accumulation area ratios were determined from ERTS imagery. Also, subtle\nflow structures, undetected on aerial photograph~, were visible. Surging glaciers were identified, and the changes resulting from the surge of a large glacier were measured. Marked\nchanges in tidal glacier termini were discovered between successive ERTS passes.\n\n92\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \\10\'\n\nPaper W 20\n\nDETECTION OF TURBIDITY DYNAMICS IN TAMPA BAY, FLORIDA USING\nMULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY FROM ERTS-1\nA. E. Coker, Aaron Higer and Carl R. Goo"dwin, U. S. Geological Survey, Miami, Florida\n\nABSTRACT\nIn 1970, Congress authorized the deepening of the Tampa Bay channel (Rivers and\nHarbors Act of 1970) from 34 to 44 feet. In order to determine the effects of this deepening\non circulation, water quality, and biota, during and after the construction, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Tampa Port Authority, has collected data and developed a digital simulation model of the bay.\nIn addition to data collected using conventional tools, use is being made of data collected from ERTS-I. Return-Beam Vidicon (RBV) multispectral data were collected, while\na shell dredging barge was operating in the bay, and used for turbidity recognition and unique\nspectral signatures representative of type and amount of material in suspension. The processed data integrated with other modeled parameters provide an overview of the dynamics of\nturbid material during dredging periods. A three-dimensional concept of the dynamics of\nthe plume was achieved by superimposing the parts of the plume recognized in each REV\nband. This provides a background for automatic computer processing of ERTS data 1111d\nthree-dimensional modeling of turbidity plumes.\n\n93"\n\n'
