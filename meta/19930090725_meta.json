Observation shows that two principal kinds of flow occur in simple flat-seated valves. For small valve lifts, the flow is along the horizontal wall and is therefore deflected 90 degrees, but for greater valve lifts the flow separates and forms a free stream, whose angle of deflection naturally increases with increasing lift. Both these kinds of flow can, in fact, be theoretically explained", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930090725, "id": "aa1490c563844959b7b190087fdca81f", "publicationDate": "1925-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930090725.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930090725/downloads/19930090725.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930090725/downloads/19930090725.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930090725/downloads/19930090725.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
