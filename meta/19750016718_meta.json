Background data and study results are presented along with a transition phase analysis (the transition from interim upper state to tug operations). A summary is given of the tug operational and interface requirements with emphasis on the on-orbit checkout requirements, external interface operational requirements, safety requirements, and system operational interface requirements. Other topics discussed include reference missions baselined for the tug and details for the mission functional flows and timelines derived for the tug mission, tug subsystems, tug on-orbit operations prior to the tug first burn, spacecraft deployment and retrieval by the tug, operations centers, mission planning, potential problem areas, and cost data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750016718, "id": "bf3d90fd0ee0461b8c30fbc9363cbfd4", "publicationDate": "1975-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750016718.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750016718/downloads/19750016718.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750016718/downloads/19750016718.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750016718/downloads/19750016718.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
