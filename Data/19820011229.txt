Sources for these items are given in the appendix. All connuents Illade\non the equipment and materials in the paper are based on the uSilge and behavior\nin the Tech Houso and should not be considered to be endorsements of the\nproducts.\nIt should be pointed out that energy-conserving homos are most efficient \\IIhem\ncarefully designed to fit specific sites ,,,ith their particular characteristics\nof access, orientation to sun and ,"inds, ~istory of \\"oathor conditions, and\nthermal requiremen\'..s. For this reason, the Tach House \\IIa::; not intended to be,\n1\n\nand should not be, considered a prototype suitable for all locations. Instead,\nthe Tech nouse should be viewed as a demonstration model and research facility\ncontaining many individual systems, components, products, and ideas which can\nbe applied in some degree to all housing.\n\n2\n\nPESCRIl?!!9N \\)1:\'\n\nTHE HOUSE\n\nThe Tech House is a one-story structure of contemp,.,rary design. (Sec figures\n1 and 2.) It is of frame construction with fir plywood siding imd dry walls\non tIle inside. The house contains approximately 1,600 square feet Qf living\nspace. Two reotangular. modules connected by a 7-foot wide foyer with entry\nvestibules in the front ilnd roar of \'.:he house comprise the living areu. These\nmodules have gable roofs on \\.,.11ich the 18 solar col:.ectors (16 for the heating\nsystem, 2 for tha domestic hot water system) are located.\nA third rectangular module comprises the garage which h:"uses the data-gathering\ninstrumentation, computer, and heat pumps. A similar home occupied by a family\nwould not require the data-gathering instrumentation and the large computer.\nAlso, the heat pumps would be placed outdoors and thereby allow the full use of\nthe garage by the family. On the gable roof of the garage i:.:. located the solar\ncell. which charges a 12-volt battery with solar energy. The battery is used\nfor the emergency lights and could also be used for the security system.\nThe floor of the house is & prefabricated, 2-\';.ilCh-ttiick, reinforced concrete\nslab above a 3-foot crawl space and has G inches of gypsum foam insulation on\nj.ts underside. The floC):c was delivered and installed in 7- by 14-foot sections.\nThe walls were insulated with 5~ l.nches of Tripolymer foam. The attic was\ninsulated with 7~ inches of the same foam. Large ventilation louvers provide\ncooling of the attic during the S\'LlllUiler. The roof \\Y\'as shingled, except in the\nflat areas.\nThe exterior doors have seeel surfaces \\Y\'i th polystyrene foam cores and magnetic\nweatherstripping. An adjutltable sill provides a positiv~ ~eal against the\nweatherstripping. All \\Y\'indows \\Y\'ere aluminum framed with plastic, low-thermti.lconductivi ty separators bet\\Y\'een the inside and outside areas of the frame. They\nare also double glazed. External shutters were added to further reduce the heat\nloss in \\\'linter and the heat gain in summer.\nThe floor coverings in the house vary. The kitchen flooring is foam-backed\nvinyl \\Y\'ith a urethane coating; the bathrooms have ceramic tile floors. The\nfoyer and entrance area floors are of slate, and all other rooms are carpeted.\nSeveral items intended primarily for security and comfort of the occupants were\nincluded, such as an emergency lighting system, a sonic transmitter to turn on\noutside lights, interior and exterior security systems, t sroke alarm, a tornado\nalarm, and self-locking hinges.\nThe emergency lighting system is powered by a standard l2-volt battery \\Y\'hich is\nkept charged by a solar cell. In the case of a pO\\Y\'er outage, i"t supplies light\nto the kitchen, living room, hall\\\'lay, and foyer.

With the TV on an unused channel and\nthe screen darkened, it sounds an audible alarm if a tornado is within 18 miles.\nSince the Tech House is not in an area subjected to tornadoes, this item was\nnot used du:cing tl:\') live-ill test.\nSelf-locking hinY-;"!i were ~),;.i.~d, but not t/asted, in the house. Triese hinges prevent the removal of doors ~fter hinge pins are removed. They a~e needed on\ndoors that swing outwa.rd and would primarily be used 011 public bui.ldings.\nTwo i tc,ms, electrical in nature, were also included: flat conductor cable\nwithin a baseboard molding and light bulb savers. The flat-conductor-cable\nelectrical system was installed in the living area and dining room after the\ncarpets were in place. It was not necessary to run wires throllgh the walls. A\nmajor benefit of such a system is in refurbishing old homes, since the new wiring\naan be installed in a baseboard system and not require the removal of tho wall\'s\nsheathing.\nThe bulb savers, which the manufacturer claims extendS the life of the light\nbulb by 300 percent, were used in two incandescent lamps. They elimi.. ~~A the\nsurge of current to the cold filament in a bulb when the light is turned on. No\ntests were conducted to confirm the manufacturer\'s claim; however, the two bulbs\nin the house that contained bulb savers did not burn out during the l-year livein test.\nMany other items which were incorporated into the house for the comfort and\nconvenience of the occupants, such as the temper foam cushions and the appliances, were not evaluated during the live-in test, since to do so would require\ninvasion of the privacy of the family.\n\n6\n\nENERGY CONSUMPTION\nTO have a basis for comparison and to evaluate the savings possible, a\nReference House in the Washington-Baltimore area on which a former study for\nHUD had been made was chosen. The Reference fbuse is a two-story, 1,695square-foot, wood-frame hQuse with plywood sheathing, R-7 fiberglass insulation in the walls, and 5 lnches of loose fill insulation in the attic. Doors\nare of wood. Window~ and glass patio ~oor are single glazed.\nOne of the goals in the construction of the house was to subs,tantially reduce\nthe energy and water consumption. A comparison of tr.e energy estimat~d for\nthe Reference House and that projected for the Tech House is given in the following table:\nEnergy consumption\nCentral Heating\nCentral Air Conditioning\nwater Heating\n)\nLights\n) Baseload\nAppliances\nMiscellaneous)\nTotal\n\nReference House\n(kwh)\n29,300\n3,600\n\nProjected for\nTech House (kwh)\n\n2,000\n5,609\n1,111\n\n6,000\n2,100\n1,500\n1,000\n3,400\n1,0,00\n\n46,000\n\n15,000\n\n4,380\n\nNote that the energy consumption was expected to be about aile-third that of the\nReference House.\nThe savings experienced during the family occupancy of the house are illustrated\nin figure 3. The actual energy consumption of the Tech House during the live-in\ntest as compared with the results from the Reference House is about one-half, as\nshown in table I.\nEnergy for domestic hot water and baseloao are highly user-determined, and\nrealistic savings cannot be determined by comparisons with the Reference House.\nFor the amount of domestic hot water used in the Tech House, it would require\n6,392 kwh of electricity to heat in the absence of supplemental energy. However, at the Tech House only 4,176 kwh were used with the balance, 2,226 kwh,\nsupplied by solar energy. This result shows an actua:. savings of about 35\npercent.\n\n7\n\n(k\\Olh)\n\n8,000\n\n7,000\n6,000\n\nSAVINGS\n\n5,000\n4 1 000\n3,000\n2,000 -\'----\n\n)\n\nREFERENCE HOUSE\n\n1 , 000\n\no\nAUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG\n1977\n1978\nFigure\n\n~\n\n- Comparison of Energy Consumption for Reference House\nand Tech House\n\n8\n\nTable I - Btceakdown of Electrical Energy Usage\n\n.\nRefercmce\nHouse (R,i)\n(kwh)\n\nItem\n\nTech House Load (Annual)\nPredioted\nUsc\n(kwh)\n\nPredicted\nSavings Relative to RH (%)\n\nActual\n(kwh)\n\nPercent Saved\nRelative to\nReference House\n\n4,380\n\n1,500\n\n66\n\n4176.4\n\n5\n\n29,300\n\nG,OOO\n\n80\n\n6087.7\n\n79\n\nCentral Air\nConditioning\n\n3,600\n\n2,100\n\n42\n\n2732.0\n\nBaseload\n(lights l\nappliances\netc. )\n\n8,720\n\n5,400\n\n50\n\n4(.,000\n\n15,000\n\nGG\n\nHot water\nCentral\nHeating\n\n\'l\'otu1\n\nI\n\n24\n\n6938.4\n\n20\n\n19935.0\n\n57\n\nI\n\nA study mUde j;:rlor to the tests at the Tech House indicated that substantial\nsavings in water consumption could be made by using water-saving fixtures, such\nus restrictors ill the showor heads and low-profile water closets, and by using\nrecycled waste watar fo;,\' toilet flush. The water-consumption saving projected\nfor the Tech House was 40 p:arGent from th:~ gray-water reuse system and 10 percant from the water-saving devicas. Actual savings were 27 percent from the\nwater reuse systam and 9 Farcent (estim3.ted) from the water-saving devices for\na total of 36 percent. Both water usage and savillgs are significantly\ninfluencad by family lifcstyla.\n\n9\n\nFEATURES THAT AFFECT\n\nENERGY~\n\nMany features of a house affect the amount of energy l.lsed but do not in themselves use energy. Included in this category are the structur.e, insulation,\ntypes of doors and windows, skylights, ar(~hi tectural features, such as size\nand location of overhangs, orientation of the house, trees, shrubs, and the\nexterior color. Because of the sun\'s position at various times of the year,\na house orj.entatiofl with short eastern and wesbern wall.J and long northern and\nsouthern \\Oialls is desirable.\nBecause of site restrictions, the Tech House was designed with long eastern\nand western walls and short northern and southern walls. An overhang was adoed\nto shade the windows on the southern wall during the summer but allow the sun\nto enter the windows during the winter months. Thermal shutters were added to\nthe windows to reduce the loss of heat from the \'. . indows at night during the\nheating season and to provide a shield against solar heat in the summer. Without c;hutters, an overhang or some means of shading i ... needed. The eastern and\nwestern walls have no overhang. Trees or hedges coula Le planted to provide\nshading and a winter windbreak. Flat areas or obstructions of any type on the\nroof may present a problem in an area that has snow, as it will build up over\nthe solar collectors and lessen their effectiveness.\nThe skylight located in the foyer of the house \\\'lorked very well in the spring\nand fall but, like other glass areas, there was a loss of heat in the winter\nand a gain of heat in the summer.\nThe large attic ventilation louvers provided cooling of the attic during the\nsummer. During the winter 80 percent of their area was closed to prevent possible freezing of the drain line from the solar collectors.\n~he shutters a~e effective energy savers when properly used.\nHowever, during\nthe summer when the shutters are closed to keep the solar heat out, they darken\nthe h?use, and this may be objectionable. Closing the shutters at night, both\nin the winter to keep the heat in the house and in the summer to preserve the\nair conditioned air, is acceptable. The family also found the shutters to be\nquite effective in reducing the noise level from outside sources.\n\n10\n\nORIGI AL PAGE\nBLACK A 0 WHITE P OTOG RAPH\nINSULATION\nTh ceilinc; nd w Ils, including som in"erio W 115 th t 5 para d th zon d\nwas delivered in\nre s, w rc insul ted with Tripolym r foam .

For. the test, a\nnoise generator provided a 90 dba noise level 30 feet from the house (noise\nequivalent to that of a train). Inside the house ..lith the shutter~ open, the\nmeasured levels were between 40 and 60 dba; with shutters closed, they ranged\nfrom 40 to 48 dba. The live-in family frequently used the shutters at night\nto reduce noise from nearby research facilities.\n\n13\n\n!:?EATIIER CONDITIONS\nDuring the wintor of 1977-1978 the heatihg degree days and the available sunshine were measured to determine ,,,hether the heat required and the sC11ar energy\navailable were typical of a norma.l year.

(The preferred angle at which the collectors are mowlted depends\non the latitude of the house.) The Ulass of the solar collectors admits\nlight and other solar radiation but i:raps the heat reflected from the interior.\nThis "greenhouse" effect is experien\\~ed when you leave your car parked in the\nsun.\nWater circulating through the collectors carries the heat to the heat exchanger,\nwhich heats the circulating air. If the heat is not needed, the hot. water is\ndiverted to a 1, 900-gallon, thermal storage tank. During the night and during\nperiods of cloudy days, this water is recirculated to heat the house. When\nsolar-heated water (above 95\xc2\xb0) is not available, well water is used as the ht:at\ninput to the water-source heat pump to heat the house. Using well water warmer\nthan the outside temperature reduces the amount of electricity needed to heat\nthe house.\nListed below are t:ne various modes used for heating the house, in the order of\npreference, from an energy efficiency viewpoint.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSolar-heated hot water directly to air duct heat exchanger\n0\nStorage tank water (if above 95 ) to air duct heat exchanger\nWell water to the water-source heat pumps\n\nE\'or air conditioning, the solar collectors for space heating are cut off. Well\nwater (55 0 to 580 F) is pumped through a heat exchanger in the return air duct\nand drops the temperature of the return air by about,lOo. The water continues\non to the heat pumps and absorbs the heat from the pumps and then is put back\ninto the ground through another well. Night radiators were placed on the northfacing roof with the anticipation that the l,900-gallon stora~e tank water could\nbe used by the heat PllIllp during the cooling season and cooled at night with the\nradiators. The humidity and climate conditions prevented the: night radiators\nfrom working effectively and the system wu~ not used.\nA simplified diagram of the heating and air conditioning systems is shown in\nfigure 7. For clarity, the drain-down lines and valves are not shown.\nAs shown in figure 7, the system provides heat to the house from either the heat\npumps or the direct duct heat excha.nger. The heat pumps serve as a backup system for the solar collectors and can use either the storage tank water or the\nwell water as a source of energy. The direct duct heat exchanger can use heated\nwater from the solar collectors, the fireplace coil, or the storage tank as its\nsource. When there is a fire in the fireplace, water is pumped from storage\nback through the fireplace water grate and returned to the storage tank if the\n16\n\n\\,;\nII\n\nIi\n\nwater is not needed, or through the direct duct heat exchanger to the tank,\nwith the heat pump fans distributing the heat to the house. The fireplace also\nhas an outside air source so that the glass doors can be closed and heat from\nthe house retained.\nA primary part of any heating or cooling system is the means of controlling the\ntemperature in a house. Host homes use a single thermostat near the retUl::n air\nduct. This often results in unequal heating of areas of the house.\n\nDIRECT DUCT\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n\nMAIN\nHEA\'!\' PUMP\n\nHEATING/\nCOOLING DUCT\nPUl-1P\nP4\nPUMP P3\nFIREPLACE\nCOIL\n\nPUMP P2\n\n1900 GAL STORAGE\nTANK\n\nFigure 7 - Simplified Diagram of Heatinq and\nAir Conditioninq Systems\n\n17\n\nSUPPLY RETURN\nWELL\nWELL\n\nIn ordor to heat only those parts of the house that were being used, the Tech\nHouse was divided into four hoating zones--each equipped with its own sensor\nor thermostat. Thus each zone could be heated to meet the family nc:cds and\nlifestyle, and variations in tre temperature for weekdays and weekends could\nbe made, The four zones were zone 1, master bedroom and bath; zone 2, childrens I bedrooms; zone 3, hall and ba\'throom; and zone 4 , living areas. Such\nzone contol makes the most efficient use of the heat.\nPerformance\nSolar energy provided a savings of about $242 (at 4.4\xc2\xa2/kwh) for the year in\nspace heating. There was a loss of energy from the storage tank which, if not\nlost, would have resulted in another $100 (2,300 kwh) savings. pumping costs\nalso prevented greater savings. At an installed C03t of $25 per square foot\nof solar collector, the solar system would cost nearly $10,000, which would not\nresult in a cost payback in 20 years. Hence, for this area, hot watQ~ hoating\nsyGtcms using solar energy do not appear to be practical, unless the installation cost could be reduced to about $3,000 and the storage system made more\nefficient.\nThe heating and air conditioning systems were designed to IJrovide solar and\nconventional heating at an energy use rate of 6,000 kwh for heating and 2,100\nkwh for air conditioning. The comparable Reference House used 29,300 kwh for\nheating and 3,600 kwh for cooling. During the family live-in period the use\nof energy for heating was 1.5 percent above design estimate. However, the\nenergy use for heating was 79.2 percent below that of the Reference House; for\nair condi tioping it was 24.1 percen\'t lower.\nThe 384 square feet of solar collectors had been expected to supply 70 to 80\npercent of the heat required for the house, but they only provided ~O percent.\nThe 70-percent figure was based on the expected degree days and the expected\npercent of possible sunshine. However, the winter was colder than normal and\nthe available sWlshine was less than normal. In addition, approximately 35\npercent of the solar energy was of such low intensity that energy could not be\ncollected.\nThe heating system includes a l,900-gallon, concrete, underground storage tank\nto store the heated water to be u~ed for the heating system when solar energy\nis not available. There was significant degradation of the tank insulation\nduring the live-in test period because of a breakdown on the \\o,Taterproofing used\nto seal the tank insulation against ground water. A greater pI?rtion of the\nheating energy would have been provided by solar if it were not for the greaterthan-expected tank losses. If the tank had been located above ground, it would\nhave been more accessible and its insulation could have been re,tdily inspected\nand repaired. Also, if located above ground, a circulating pu~~, rather than a\nsuction pump, could be used and the operating cost would be less.\n\n18\n\nZone Control\nThe heating system responded to temperature sensors located ip four zonAd areas\ncf the house. Zone control has two advantages: (1) it saves energy by allowing\ntemperatures to be reduced in areas not being used and (2) each area can be\nheated to the required level. A heating and cooling schedule was developed for\neach zone according to the family lifestyle.\nwith zone control heating, the temperatures throughout the house were within\nabout 2 degrees of the sensor setting. When operated for a short period without zone control heating, temperature variances from sensor settings were as high\nas 10 de9rees. This results from the fact that heat is provided to all areas\nuntil the cClolest room is satisfied, as opposed to the zone control system where\neach zone is satisfied separately.\nZone control can provide a method of space heating that is both comfortable and\neconomical. However, its use with heat pumps requires that minor modifica~ions\nbe made, if necessary, in order to not reduce the air supply or the heat pump\ncapacity.\nFireplace Syste.rn\nThe fireplace is an integral part of the heating system of the Tech House. The\nfireplace has a water-cooled fire grate; a double-walled, steel firebox; and\nan outside combustion air supply; and is capable of heating the entire house.\n(See figure 8.) When the fire is burning, the warm air from the firebox and\nradiation can keep the living room and kitchen areas comfortable. The water\nheated i~ the grate circulates through the heating system. Approximately 50,000\nbtu/hr of heat can be utilized from the fireplace (38,000 btu/hr from the grate\nand 12,000 bt~/hr from the double-walled, steel firebox and radiant heat).\nDuring the live-in test, the family used the fireplace very little because of\ntwo problems: (1) the pumps supplying \\oJater to the grate had to be turned off\nafter the fire went out; thus one could not go to bed while the fire was\nburning; and (2) the fireplace, at times, overheated the living room area and\nit became uncomfortable. The first problem can be eliminated with minor control\nmodifications. The second problem could be corrected by ducting the fireplace\nheat to the rest of the house. The hot water from the fireplace grate could\nalso be circulated to heat the domestic hot water.\nThe heating cost for the house could be lowered if the fireplace were used\nregularly. A water coil will provide up to 2,200 kwh of energy per cord of wood\nburned. Depending on the cos\xc2\xb7t of electricity, the water coil will produce $60\nto $90 worth of energy per cord of wood burned.\n\n19\n\nf\n\n\'i\n\nWARM AIR OUTLETS r;;;m~~~\nFROM DOUBLEWALL I:=~I:Z:::::;=;ZJI:\nFIREBOX\n\nWARM AIR\nOUTLET\n11==1==="\'11\n\nBRICK\n\nF==9=======-\n\n____\n--=-=-==-==~==~\n\nAIR INTAKE TO\nDOUBLEWALL\nFIREBOX\n\nFIREBRICK\nON SLAB-\n\nFigure 8 - Fireplace Design\n20\n\nDOMESTIC HOT WATER SYSTEM\n\nH\n\nIt\nIt\n\nfi\n\nThe domestic hot water system (see figure 9) consists of a 50-gallon tank which\nis heated with solar energy and a 42-gallon, electrically heated tank. City\nwater enters the preheat tank where it is heated with solar energy. When hot\nwater is required, water is provided to the user from the electrically hea~ed\ntank, and water from the preheat tank is supplied to the electrically heated\ntank. If the water temperature in the electrically heated tank drops below the\npreset temperature (usually 1400 F), the electric element comes on. Solar energy\nwas expected to supply 65 to 75 percent of the domestic hot water for a family Qf\nfour (approximately 80 gallons of hot water per day). Actually, the system only\nprovided about 35 percent of the use during the live-in test. Some reasons for\nthis difference are that the family was gone during the day when the water was\nbeing solar heated, and the storage capacity was inadequate to provide the necessary reserve. Showers were taken in the morning, and the laundry and d~shes were\nusually done at night; as a result, the 50 gallons of solar-heated water were\nexhausted, and electrically heated water was req11ired. The average daily usage\nper person \\\'w\'as 16 gallons I but usage of 25 to 30 gallons per person \\\'las not\nunusual.\nThe design of the system and s~z~ng of the components should be representative\nof the family and family lifestyle in order to realize the best payback on the\nsystem investment. The Tech House system design did not satisfactorily anticipate the lifestyle and water use patterns of the family subsequently selected\nfor the live-in test. Both the solar collection area and preheat tank capacity\nwere slightly undersized for the hot water use pattern of the family.\nThere were periods when hot water was not used for several days. Under these\nconditions tile water was continuously circulated through the collectors to prevent overheating and boiling of the ~Dllector system water. The cost of the\npumping energy for this situation is only pennies a day.\n\n21\n\nIi\n\ni(\n\nCITY WATER SUPPLY\n\nHOT WATER\nSUPPLY\n\nSOLAR COLLECTORS\n(48 SQ.

A\nschematic diagram of the system is shown in figure 10.\nO~dinary\n\nhousehold bleach was automatically dispensed to the collection tank\nfor purification. Back washing of the coLection tank was occasionally performed to clean out the sediment in the tarLl(.\n\nA diatomaceous earth filter, similar to that used for swimming pools, was used\nto remove the large particles and reduce the turbidity and foaming action\ninduced by detergents.\nTap water was automatically fed into the collection tank when gray water ~as\ninadequate to meet the flush-wate:r needs. When excess gray water became available and could not be collected in the stor.age tank, it was dumped into the\nsewage system.\nApproximately 27,000 gallons of toilet flush water were required during the\nyear, of which approximately 5,000 gallons were fresh water. An even larger portion of \xc2\xb7\'he flush-water needs could have been realized if the collection tank\nhad been l40-ga1lon capacity, instead of 110. This ""ould have minimized the\namount of water dumped as a result of the laundering habits of the family. The\nwater savings from the reuse sy~tem for the l-year test amounted to 27 percent\nbut, with a larger storage tank, it could have been about 33 percent.\nThe system operated satisfactorily during the live-in test. \'rhe family did not\nfind its use objectionable. sometimes the appearance of dye in the water the\nday after washing jeans would be evident. Some maintenance on a monthly basis\nfor the cleaning of the filter and for back washing the system is required.\n\n23\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 0 _ _ -<\n\nSUPPLY\n\n110 GAL\nCOT,LECTION\nTANK\n\nFigure 10 - water Reuse System\n\n24\n\nTHE FAMILY EXPERIENCE\nIn general, the technology incorporated in the house was not objectionable to\nthe family. There were some unusual noises generated by the water reuse system, but no more than would be experienced with a pumped well water system.\nAll technology systems were designed with a backup system in order to maintain\nthe necessary essentials and comfort as a residence. Nevertheless, there was\nan occasional malfunctioil, which required patience and tolerance by the family.\nThe family particularly liked the double-pane, horizontally-opening windows in\nthe Tech House. When they returned to their horne it. Florida, thEl)\' had the same\ntype of windows installed in their horne, and they reported a significant savings\nin energy as witnessed in their heating and cooling energy bills.\n\n25\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe live-in ..est oi the Tech qousc located at\'. Langley Research Center in\nHampton, Virginia, indicated that energy savings and water savings are possi~le with new-technology systems.\n~se of the house by a family for a year\npermitted data to be collected on the general operation and performance of\nthe systems and on the effects of family lifestyles on technology utilization\nand payback. Comparisons of the energy systems of a Reference House in the\nBaltimore-Washington area with those of the Tech House were made. A combination of solar collectors and water-source heat pumps reduced the electricity\nrequi~ed by about 50 percent.\nThis reduction was less than expected because\nof less-than-normal sunshine coupled with a colder-than-average winter, dS well\nas some design features of the system. An above-ground storage tank would\nprevent large heat losses to the ground experienced as a result of degradation\nof the tank insulation from ground water. Based on the test data, however,\nsolar energy for space heating is still not cost effective.\nS..:>lar energy provided about one-third of the domestic hot water requirements.\nThe actual energy required for domestic hot water was more than that projected\nbecause of a greater-than-expected consumption. A larger solar collector area\nand a larger solar preheat tank would be required to supply the hot water as\nused during the test. The family lifestyle (most water used early mornings and\nevenings) had an effect on the system\'s efficiency and should be incorporated\ninto ~ystem design and component sizing. Properly sized and designed, a system\nfor solar heating of domestic hot water is cost effective.\nRecycling of wash and bath water for toilet flush reduced water consumption by\nabout 27 percent. The general operation and performance of the system was\nac~eptable to the family.\nRoutine maintenance, about once a month, is required\nto clean the tank, replace the filter, and replenish the chlorine bleach used\nfor purification. The size of the collection tank depends on family size and\nlifestyle. A 140-gallon tank instead of the 1l0-gallon tank used in the system\nwould have enabled the collection of more of the waste water for toilet flush.\nThermal and architectural design features provide the biggest energy savings\nand provide the best payback on investment.\nNo attempt was made during the live-in test to change the family lifestyle.\nSome changes in today\'s lifestyles, such as optimum use of the shutters, greater\nuse of the fireplace, keeping doors closed between zones and in vestibules, use\nof hot water during daytime hours for bathing and laundering, could result in\ngreater savings.\n\n26\n\nAPPENDIX;\n\nHOUSE DESCRIPTION\n\nThis appendix contains the names and addresses of organizations from which NASA\npurchased services, materials, systems, etc., in COn\';\\oction with the advanced\ntechnology items us~d in the Technology Utilization House.

The major components in the heating system, shown in the schematic\ndiagram (page32), are the solar collectors where water paoses through flat\nplates, thermal storage tank, heat pumps, and direct heat exchanger.\nSolar energy is collected by 384 square feet of black flat-plate solar collectors mounted at an angle of 58 degrees on the south facing roof of Tech\nHouse. The solar collectors heat the water for heating the house or for\nra~s~ng the temperature of the water in a thermal storage tank, which is\ninsulated and buried in the ground. The thermal storage tank has a 1900gallon capacity and is used to store energy for. use at night and on overcast\ndays. The storage tank was designed to store enough energy to provide: sufficient heat for up to 5 consecutive days. When direct solar heating is not\navailable, a heat pump is used to transfer stored heat from the storage tank\nto the house. On clear days, if heat is needed in the house, hot water from\nthe solar collectors is circulated directly through the direct heat exchanger\nwhere heat is transferred from the wat~r to the air.\nIf heat is not required in the house; tl~e hot water from the solar collectors\nis diverted to the thermal storage tank to increase the temperature of the\nstored water. At night and on overcast days when solar energy is not collected, heat is supplied to the house by circulating hot water from the\nstorage tank through the direct heat exchanger. When the temperature of the\nstored water drops below 1100F, the heat pumps transfer heat from the storage\ntank to the house. If the stored \\olater temperature drops below 5S oF, two\nwells (shown on the schematic, page 32) provide an additional source of water\nfrom which the heat pumps can transfer heat to the house. However, the\nstored water temperature is not likely to fall to the 55 0 F level unless there\nare 10 to 15 continuous overcast days with extremely low temperatures.\nAs discussed in a subsequent section on the fireplace, water can also be\nheated by circulation through the fireplace grate/coil. The heated water is\nthen circulated through the direct heat exchanger or to the storage tank.\nNumerous solenoid valves and several pumps are utilized in the heating system.\nThese valves and pumps are operated by differential temperature flow controllers, which provide electrical signals when preset temperature difff=rentials\nexist within tile system.\nThe ductwork which distributes the warm air throughout the house is part of a\nzone control system using advanced controls to accurately and automatically\ncontrol the temperatures in the three areas of living, sleeping, and bathing.\nThis system for control of heating and cooling will result in substantial\nene~gy savings.\nA computer monitors inside temperatures and, by means of a\ncomputer program written to reflect the family\'s activities, heats only the\nrooms being used. This computer can be made not much larger than a pocket\n31\n\n.\n\nI\n\nI\n,\n\ncalculator. During winter days, the module containing the living .,lreas will\nbe warm, while the module with the bedrooms will be cool. At bedtime, the\nprogram will be reversed, with warm bedrooms and bathrooms and cool living\nareas. A man~al override will return control of the system to the occupant\nduring an emergency. For research purposes of NASA, the equipment shown on\npage 34 was installed in the garage to record the effectiveness of the different systems and their components. This would normally not be in a horne.\nThe heating system in Tech House is more complicated than would be necessary\nfor the normal horne because of the experimental features incorporated for\nevaluation purposes. The four possible modes of heating could be reduced to\nsupplying solar energy to the storage tank in a closed system and then\nutilizing a second closed system, including the heat pump, to transfer heat\nto the house. The backup would be electrical heaters installed in the heat\npump.\nAdditional energy-conserving features incorporated into ~ech House include\nthe entry vestibules and the south window areas wi.th roof overhang.\nThe entry vestibules at the front and rear of the Tech House hallway act as\nair locks and prevent the loss of large quantities of heated or cooled air\nfrom inside tile house while the outside door is open. The reduction in\nheated or cooled air loss becomes significant during extremely cold ~..linter\ndays or hot summer days.\nThe large window area on the south wall, the overhrurlging roof, and the\nexter:i.or retractable shutters result in significant energy savings. The large\nglass area allows solar energy to be transmi t\'ted into the house through the\nwindows during the winter days. At night, the shutters keep the heat from\nescaping from the house. The roof overhang was designed to allow the sun to\nshine through the south windows in the winter ,.,hen heat is needed, but to\nshade the windows from the summer sun when it is desirable to keep the heat\ngain low.\nThe water source heat pumps used in the Tech House were purchased from:\nFlorida Heat Ptunp Corporation\n610 Southwest 12th Avenue\nPompano Beach, Florida 33060\nTelephone: (305) 781-0830\n\n32\n\n~\n-~\n\n"""""\'_~l\'I"\'7,~.""j()\n\n... __ ~_ag;;~~~~!:~\n\n:X;;;;::;=:::;;;:;Z:\n\n,,,~\'.;::,-::.;:.,,,\n\nDIRECT DUCT\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n~-..-----"":\'I,..."~i\'\n\n,....\n~\nI-\'\n,....\nHI\n,....\n\nMAIN\nHEAT PUMP\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni I\n....\n~~-------...,\n\nUl\n\nCD\nP.\n\nt:l\n,....\nIII\n<Q\nIi\n\n~\n0\n\nHI\n\n::z::\nw\nw\n\nCD\nPJ\n\nr!,....\n\n()\n\n~\n\n~\n\n+\n\nSOLAR\nCOLL\':::\'S\n\n+FIREPLACE\nCOIL\n\nld!1\n\nHEATINGI\nCOOLING DUCT\nPUMP\n\nI\n\nNIGHT\nRADIATORS\n\nPUMP\n\nPUMP\n\n::s\n\n<Q\n\n\xc2\xa7\nP.\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n,....\n\nI-\'\n\n::s\n<Q\n\ntJl\n\n\'<\ntil\n\nr!-\n\nCD\n\na\n\nJTORAGE\nTANK\n\nSUPPLY\nWELL\n\nRETURN\nWELL\n\nORIGINAL P \xc2\xb7\nBLACK A 0 WHITE PHOTOGRAPH\n\nSolar Coli c ors\n34\n\nLACK\n\nRAP\n\n*Syst ms Monitoring Equipment\n*For NASA res arch purposes only.\nWould not normally be in hom .\n35\n\n-\n\nCOOLING;\n\nThe cooling system for Tech House utilizes the same equipment and components\nas the heating system, except that the night raaiators on the garage roof\nreplace the solar collectors. These night radiators face north and as the\nhot water from the storage circulates through them, heat radiates to the\natmosphere, thereby lowering the temperature of the stored water.\nTo cool the hous~, the heat pump is used to transfer heat from the house\n\ninto the storage tank where it raises the temperature of the water. Thus,\ncooling ~s provided by raising the water temperature during the day and\nlowering it: at night by using the night radiators. When the temperature of\nthe water in the storage tank reaches 90oF, the system automatically switches\nto the wells as a source of 5S oF water to which the heat from the house c~n\nbe transferred. The system is shown in the schematic on page 32, simplifipo\nto show the components used for heating and cooLi.ng. Nost of the equipmeut is used for both heating and cooling, and the piping for both systems is\ninterconnected. The valves and p~~ps in the cooling system are controlled in\nthe same way as in the heating system, including the zone temperature control\nsystem.\nIn many homes, a significant part of the cooling load results from the hot\nattic air which may reach temperatures up to 1600 F during hot summer days.\nThe use of power ventilators may reduce the attic air temperature to 90 110oF. However, Tech House has incorporated large ventilation louvers in the\nattic space, which keep the attic air temperature within a few degrees of the\noutside air temperature. The use of these louvers has reduced the cooling\nload while r~quiring no energy consumption to operate a fan.\nWater-to-air heat pumP& are available from several manufacturers.\nfor the Tech House was:\nFlorida Heat Pump Corporation\n610 Southwest 12th Avenue\nPompano Beach, Florida 33060\nTelephone: (305) 781-0830\n\n36\n\nThe supplier\n\nFIREPLACE\n~e fi~eplace,\n\nas utilized in Tech House, is an integral part of the heating\nsystem. Fresh combustion air f~om outside, rather than using al~eady heated\nair f~om inside the ~oom as conventi0nal fi~eplaces do, is supplied by a duct\ndirectly to the firebox, the~eby significantly reducing heut loss up the\nchimney. Room-heating capacity is fu~ther inc~eased by the use of a doublewall metal fi~ebox which allows some escaping ene~gy to b~ retu~ned to the\n~oom.\nAdditionally, the tempe~atu~e of the water in the storage tank can be\nillc~eased by ci~culating it th~ough the fireplace grate, which is a coil\nthrough which wate~ can flow. These special features increase the efficiency\nof the fireplace from the usual 10 percent to about 50 percent.\nThe water circulating grate/coil used in the fireplace was fabricated at the\nLangley Research Cente~. It is expected to recover 38,000 BTU\'s per hour\nfrom an available 95,000-BTU log fi~e. Water grate systems using simila~\nconcepts a~e available commercially, can be installed in existing fireplaces,\nand a~e adaptable to hot wate~, fo~ced air, or elect~ically heated homes.\nOne manufacture~ claims a 40-pe~cent ~ecove~y of heat gene~ated by the fire~\nplace fire.\nManufacturer of Hydrohearth:\n\nRidgway Steel Fabricators, Inc.\nBox 382\nRidgway, Pennsylvania 15853\nTelephone: (814) 776-1323 o~ 776-1324\n\nHydrohearth by Ridgway\nSteel Fabricators\n\n37\n\nEXTERIOR RETRACTABLE SHUTTERS\nThe exterior retractable shutters* used ctn Tech House windows provide energy\nsavings by bolding heat in during the wirlter and keeping heat out during the\nsummer.

A typical household for a family of four was set up with appliances\nand fixtures to produce waste water. Instead of releasing bath and laundry water\ninto sewer lines, the water was filtered and chlorinated for reuse as toilet\nflush water. The experiment revealed that this single step could easily reduce\nwater consumption by 60 to 100 gallons a day.\nAn\n\nThe watflr reuse system used in Tech House reduces water consumption by half when\ncombined with other water saving methods. Water from bathtub, shower, and\nlaundry equipment is collected in a holding tank, chlorinated, filtered, and\nrecycled, as shown in the. schematic diagram on page 45, for use as water for\ntoilet flushing. Even though the toilet flush water is .safe enough for possible\ntasting by children or pets, to alleviate health and s~fety concerns of the\naverage homeowner, the drinking water system is entirely separate from the\nrecycled water system.\nAll waste ftom toilets goes directly to the sewer, as does any overflow from the\ncollection tank. One additiunal benefit resulting from reusing the wash water\nis that a trace amount of detergent remains in the recycled water and tends to\nkeep the toilet bowls clean.\nThe overall reduction in requireulents for water in and waste outflow also reduces\nrequirements for community sewage systems, treatment plants, and water supply\nsystems.\nThe completed experimental programs have proven that the advantages of this system outweigh any disadvantages, such as initial cost, space requirements, and\ncost of maintenance.\nMaterial for the water reuse system is commercially available and was purchased\nat a cost of $450.\nWater-Cyk Corporation plans on marketing a water reuse system in 1980.

The alarm is activated\nwhen the wires are cut or the window screen removed. The detectors under\nthe carpets are pressure-sensitive pads which set off the same alarm. The\ndetector pads at the three outside doors have a built-in delay which gives\nthe occupant time to secure the system before the alarm sounds afte~\nentering the house. When the occupant enters the code number on one of the\ndigital panel devices, any attempt to break into the house will set off the\nalarm.\nMuggings and burglaries often occur when a homeowner is occupied in opening\nthe house door in the dark, from an assailant that was hiding in the brush.\nTo light dark areas at night before entering the house, the "Scan" pocket\ntransmitter, the size of a fountain pen, can transmit an ultrasonic signal\nwhich will turn the porch light on from a distance of about 30 feet.\nSentry Products, Inc.\n2225 Martin Avenue, suite J\nSanta Clara, California 95050\nTelephone: (408) 727-1866\n\nManufacturer of "Scan"\nand Interior Security\nSystem:\n\nHoneywell Detection systems\n2400 Granby Street\nNorfolk, Virginia 23517\nTelephone: (804) 622-1378\n\nInstalled by:\n\n55\n\n\\1\n111\n\n!~\n\nORIGI AL P GE\nBLACK AND WHITE P\'HOlrDGI"\'.\n\nInt rior security Sy.t\n\nControl P n 1\n\nSecurity wired Screens\n56\n\nORIGINAL: PAGE\nBLACK AND WHITE PHOlm~1PH\n\nPressur -Sensitiv\n\n57\n\nPads\n\nEXTERIOR SBCURITY SYSTEM\nThe exterior security F.iystem u.ses a seismic detector, similar to those used\non the moon, to determine density and thickness. The seismic detector is\nplanted in the ground ancl ,"onnected by cable to an electronic package\nenclosed in a water-t..~,:> \xe2\x80\xa2. _ ..)ntainer. The range of the seismic sensor is 80\nmeters (262 feet), and the movement of an intruder within that ~ange causes\na coil to vibrate. The amplitude and duration of the vibratiofi depends on\nthe intensity of the footstep impulse. The vibration of the moving coil\nsensor generates a voltage impulse which is amplified and transmitted to a\nremote FM receiv~r. The receiver emits a single tone burst for each footstep of a slow-walking intruder, while a running intruder will cause a continuous tone, with periodic variations indicating each footstep.\nThis syst.em was fabricated at NASA\'s Ames Research Center and is expected to\nbe available commercially in the near future.

There are approximately 20 brands of smoke detectors on the market, ranging in price from\napproxim~tely $15 to $85.\nThere are two types of smoke detectors cC!l1Illonly used in the home: ionization detectors and photoelectric detectors. Ionization detectors use a\nradioactive source to transform the air inside them into a conductor of\nelectric current. A small current passes through this "ionized" air. When\nsmoke particles enter the detector, they impede the flow of current. Electronic circuitry monitors the current reduction and sets off an alarm when\nthe current gets too low.\nPhotoelectric detectors have a lamp that directs a light beam into a chamber.\nThe chamber contains a light-sensitive photocell, which is normally tucked\nout of the way of the lamp\'s direct beam. But when smoke enters the chamber,\nthe smoke particles scatter the light beam. The photocell now "sees" the\nlight and, at a preset point, sets off an alarm.\nOf course, an alarm is only one aspect or a total program of home fire\nsafety which should include fire-prevention measures, fire extinguishers\n(for small blazes only), and the development of alternate escape routes from\nthe house in case of fire. Information on all these is available from the\nNational Fire Protection Association (470 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02210),\nor from your local fire department.\n\n,\n\'))\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb,1\nSmoke Detector\n\n60\n\nAUX, .......I AR~X P_O,;,;.WE;; ;,____ ............C_E_L.. ,;;;.L\nIL ... ___\n;R S_O_L AR\nA solar cell is a device for converting light energy into electrical energy\nwithout moving parts through a phen<.lmenon known as the "photovoltaic effect."\nEffective use of the solar cell began when NASA took it out of the laborato::y and into limited production by making it the power source for sat.ellites.\nThe most efficient and inexpensive solar cells today are made of silicon,\nobtained from slicing round silicon ingots. Size is most important, as the\npower generated is proportionate to the area exposed to light (photon units).\nWhile photovoltage is independent of the area, the larger the solar cell, the\nhj.gher the current will be. A single solar cell charges the Tech House battery which powers the driveway spotlight and the emergency indoor lighting.\nThe cost of the solar cell used in Tech House is $355.\nManufacturer:\n\nSolarex Corporation\n1335 Piccard Drive\nRockville, Maryland 20850\nTelephone:\n(301) 948-0202\n\nSolar Cell\n\n61\n\nTORNADO DETECTOR\nThe tornado detector is a light-sensitive device, encapsulated in a suction\ncUlt, attac::~ed to the television picture tube.

These \\\'lere installed to techn"",cally\nevaluate this form of construction, not because of any price competitiveness\nin the near future. The floor is a 2-inch, 5000 psi concrete plate, reinforced with welded wire fabric, and insulated with gypsum foam. The floor\nsections fit in a frame of lightweight steel shapes optimized to produce\nmaximum performance from a minimum quantity of materials. Thp. foam insulation in the floor is noncombustible and costs less trlan Fiberglas insulation\nof equivalent thickness.\nThe prefabricated wall is a glass fiber reinforced \':1ypsum and sand-c,ast wall\nmounted on a steel frame. The resultant wall is impact and fire r~sistant,\nwith a unifonn surface. The gypsum foam insulation fills all voids of the\nwall to reduce heat loss and reoace noise transmission. These flcvr ~nd\nwall components are adaptable t-", conventional trim and finishing n\'ateriflls\nand were designed for inteq~ation with other prefabricated and CO\'lventionally\nbuilt components.\nThese floor and wall components were procured from the General Electric\nCompany, \\lhose Re-entry and Environmental Systems Division has been developing\nadvanced materials and industrialized technology for use in the construction\nindustry.\nThis construction can be competitive in price with conventional construction\nonly when prefabricated sections are used throughout the house and several\nhouses are erected at the same time. At this time, this type of construction\nhas not been considered for isolated structures. It was found that when only\nthe floor and a wall are installed in a custom home, as in Tech House, the\ncost of the crane to position the sections and the cost of drilling the floor\nfor custom plumbing, heating, P.tc., resulted in increased costs over conventional construction by about three times.
