environmental\nconditions.\nThe design concept of the prototype slide stainer is shown in the block diagram\nof Figure 1.\n\nReagents are stored and dispensed from modified syringes fitted\n\n4\n\nwith a screw drive for the plunger.\ncap holding a rubber septum.\n\nThe tip of each syringe is fitted with a\n\nIn use, the syringe tips are pushed over a needle\n\nmounted in a manifold and connected to a reagent selector valve.\n\nThe needles\n\npenetrate the septum of each syringe and permit the liquid contents to be\ndispensed.\nThe common output of the selector valve is connected to a manifold which\nconnects the valve with a common line leading to a staining chamber.\n\nAir and\n\nwater for flushing are also connected into the manifold.\nThe staining chamber cover permits the positioning of a 1" x 3" microscopic\nslide over an -"a" ring.\n\nClosing the chamber cover forces the slide onto the\n\n"0" ring forming a very small volume circular cavity between the surface of\n\nthe glass slide and the bottom of the chamber.\n\nSmall entrance and exit ports\n\nin the base of the chamber allows the flow of fluids through the formed cavity.\nManually operated plunger type pumps force flushing water and air through the\ncavity to staining solutions.\nOn June 29, 1971, an informal Detail Design Review on the Slide Stainer was\nheld at Beckman Instruments.\nThe design concept and the detail drawings were examined and discussed.\n\nA\n\nbreadboard unit was used to demonstrate that the designed hardware would\nproduce acceptable Gram Stains of micro-organisms and Wright Stained blood\nsmears.\nThe breadboard contained and provided for the demonstration of the following\nessential components:\nReagent dispenser\nReagent selector valve\nStaining chamber\nWater and air dispenser\nWaste collection method\n\n5\n\nDuring the demonstration of the breadboard) slides of B. subtilis (Gram\nPositive) and S. marcesens (Gram Negative) were stained followed by fixing\nand staining a blood smear with a one component Wright Stain.\n\nThese prepara-\n\ntions were adjudged to be satisfactory.\nA discussion on the properties of materials of construction) such as that used\nfor the stainer housing and reagent dispenser revealed that metals) i.e.)\naluminum or stainless were preferred over plastics such as Lexan.\n\nThe extra\n\nweight of the metals was considered a less serious problem than the general\ntendency of plastics to be a source of combustible material.\nAlso during the discussion on weight tradeoffs) the use of ship\'s water was\nexplored.\n\nMr. Day objected to the use of ship\'s water on the basis that its\n\nuse would require the astronauts to perform certain operations best performed\non earth and all for the savings of one pound of water to be used over three\nmissions.\nThe original design concept provided five reagent dispensers plus one dispenser\nfor water rinse through the selector valve.\n\nDuring the breadboard evaluation\n\nof the system the sixth dispenser for water was found unnecessary.\n\nHowever)\n\nit was found that a sixth reagent dispenser containing absolute alcohol was\nnecessary in order to flush out the slight amount of residual water in the\nstaining chamber and common flow lines and also to fix the blood smear.\n\nWith-\n\nout the alcohol flushing of the system and fixation of the blood smear, the\nred cells are generally distorted and many of the cells appear to have small\noil droplets superimposed upon them.\nThe laboratory method of fixing blood smears prior to staining utilizes methyl\nalcohol.\n\nSince this material is toxic to humans) its use in a manned space-\n\ncraft is to be avoided.\n\nIn laboratory tests ethyl alcohol has been substituted\n\nfor methyl alcohol in the blood staining method and found equally satisfactory.\nTherefore, the slide stainer will use absolute ethyl alcohol for dehydration.\nTwo minor changes in the design were suggested during the DDR.\n\n6\n\nThese are:\n\n1.\n\nA permanent window be placed in the staining chamber cover to protect\nthe small liquid ports from contamination.\n\nThis would eliminate the\n\nneed for a dummy slide to be kept in the chamber during non-use.\n\nOver\n\nlong periods of time such a dummy slide would tend to flatten the "0"\nring seal in the chamber and could result in a faulty seal.\n2.\n\nA detent stop to be added to each reagent dispenser to indicate one\nfull turn of the dispenser knob.\n\nThese two design changes have been made in the appropriate places.\nOn July 9, Mr. J. Walsh of Beckman met with Mr. N. Belasco and Dr. S. Poole of\nNASA at Lockheed Missile and Space Company, Sunnyvale, California.\nThe design of the slide stainer was again discussed.\nsuggested.\n\nOne design change was\n\nThat being the addition of a key system on the reagent dispensers\n\nso that it would be impossible to place them in the wrong position.\n\nThis\n\nchange has been seriously considered, however, to incorporate such a change\nwould require a complete redesign of the storage and locking mechanism as well\nas scrapping certain parts of the reagent dispensers which have been made.\n\nIn\n\nview of the numbering system to be applied to the syringes and cavities, it is\nfelt that the keys are not an absolute requirement for the prototype unit.\nPrior to the start of the program, reagent stability tests and reagent compatibility tests with syringe materials were initiated.\nfound to freeze within two days and also leak badly.\n\nAll glass syringes were\nPlastic syringes with\n\nrubber tipped plunger absorbed the iodine from the Gram\'s iodine reagent.\n\nIn\n\naddition, after several weeks at 37\xc2\xb0C the rubber tips harden, swell or become\nstuck to the plastic barrel.\n\nThe problem was solved with glass barrel syringes\n\nwith TEFLON tipped plungers.\n\nDuring the reporting period the reagent stability\n\ncompatibility tests have continued.\n\nAfter 36 days storage in the above\n\ndescribed syringes, the Gram\'s iodine reagent has retained over 70% of its\nextractable iodine.\n\nReagents stored for 36 days in the syringes at 37\xc2\xb0C\n\nyielded gram stains of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms comparable\nwith fresh reagents.\n\nA discussion of the compatibility and reagent stability\n\nproblem is given in Attachment E.\n\n7\n\nAn absorbent supplied by NASA for use in the waste bag which was labeled\n"Piddle-Pak" was evaluated along with a compressed sponge sold for cleaning\nsoldering irons.\n\nThe compressed sponge originally measuring 2" x 3"\n\nX\n\n1/16"\n\nabsorbed 25 ml of water in about 7 minutes while the Pidd1e-Pak material\noriginally measuring 5 times greater in size absorbed only 10 m1 of water in\nabout 12 minutes.\n\nThe sponge has been identified as a special pure cellulose\n\nacetate.\nA mechanical analysis of the front door) which allows access to the waste bay\nstorage) flushing valve assembly and water supply bag indicated that hinging\nthe door on the right hand side) adjacent to the water and air flushing assembly)\ncreated a very weak mounting easily damaged.\nthe door along the bottom.\n\nThis was corrected by hinging\n\nA 3/4 inch hinge was replaced by a 5-1/2 inch\n\nhinge) thus making the door mounting much sturdier.\nThe design of the slide stainer requires plastic bags for water storage and\nwaste collection.\n\nIt is intended that the flight version of the Slide Stainer\n\nwill be supplied with NASA approved and qualified plastic bags and from a\ncomposite material designed as SLP4.\n\nBecause of the short time schedule\n\nallotted to the slide stainer prototype program) the SLP4 bags were not available.\n\nTherefore) for the prototype) suitably modified commercially available\n\npolyvinylchloride bags will be supplied.\n\nThese bags will be similar in size\n\nonly to those proposed for flight units of the stainer and will suffice for\nthe prototype system.\n\nWe have purchased heavy vinyl bags manufactured for\n\nblood transfusion purposes and have modified these.\n\nHeat sealing these heavy\n\nvinyl bags was accomplished by an outside vendor.\nA significant improvement over the originally intended labeling of reagent\ndispensers and positions of the selector valve was accomplished by labeling the\ncover plate of the selector valve and the knurled knobs of the dispenser with\ncolor coded plastic discs which also contained a letter-number combination.\nAlthough not a specified requirement, consideration was given to a safety valve\nwhich would stop the flow of fluid to the staining chamber in the absence of a\nslide in the chamber.\n\nReferring to Figure 1) it can be seen that such a safety\n\nvalve would be attached to the liquid flow system at point X.\n8\n\nNumerous safety valve designs were studied and a valve design was finally\nselected for fabrication.\n\nThe fabricated valve was found to require too large\n\na volume, doubling the amount of reagents needed for a single stain.\nDuring the preparation of detailed shop drawings, an analysis of the safety\nvalve requirements revealed that in the worst case the reagent selector valve\ncould be turned to a given reagent and without a slide in the chamber the knob\nof the reagent dispenser given one full turn.\n\nSince the safety valve could\n\nessentially block the flow of fluid to the staining chamber, a large hydrostatic pressure could be built up in the system.\na serious leak or rupture a connecting tube.\n\nSuch a pressure could cause\n\nThe design was changed such that\n\nwhen a slide is not in the chamber any fluid accidentally being injected into\nthe common flow lines would be directed to a safety waste bag which would\nalways be connected in the system.\n\nSince one turn of a reagent dispenser now\n\nwill inject 0.34 ml into the system, a safety waste bag of 2.5 ml would\naccommodate seven accidental occurrences.\nAfter fabrication, the second safety valve was installed in the prototype unit\nand evaluated.\n\nThis valve restricted the flow of reagents to the chamber and\n\nwas very difficult to seal properly.\n\nSince time was limited and the two valves\n\nfabricated did not meet the requirements, a safety valve was not included in\nthe prototype unit.\nDuring the final assembly, testing, and also during the Verification Testing,\na few difficulties or failures were noted.\no\n\nThese were:\n\nThe flushing valve located on the inside of the front access door has\nsmall Teflon tubing leading to it.\n\nRepeated bending and pulling on\n\none of the lines resulted in a leak close to the valve.\ntubing was replaced.\n\nThe valve and\n\nLocating the valve inside the right side access\n\ndoor with one flexible line leading to the flushing probe should\neliminate this problem.\no\n\nThe successful operation of the water drop dispenser requires that\nthe fluid lines leading to the plunger pump and the drop port be\nprimed.\n\nPriming of the lines has been found to be difficult at times.\n\n9\n\nSqueezing the water supply bag has been found helpful.\n\nHowever, a\n\nbetter method for dispensing the water drop would be a small version\nof the reagent dispenser syringes.\no\n\nInitially the glass barrel of the syringe was cemented in the dispenser\nhousing using a silicone RTV material.\n\nIt was thought that the soft\n\nrubber would hold the barrel in place and act as a cushion against\nvibration and shock.\n\nIt was later found that the RTV material did\n\nnot cure completely in the confined space.\n\nThe use of filled epoxy\n\ncement for this application appears to have solved the problem.\no\n\nThe stainless steel needles mounted in the manifold block were\ncemented in place with a small amount of epoxy cement.\n\nDuring use\n\nthese needles are subjected to a backward pressure whenever the\nseptum of the reagent dispenser is pushed onto the needle.\n\nRecementing\n\nthe needles with a larger amount of epoxy has temporarily solved the\nproblem.\n\nA better method of mounting the needles would be to braze\n\nthem to a metal plate then attach the mounting block to the plate.\nThe completed prototype slide stainer is shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.\n\nMajor\n\ncomponents and special features are identified.\nThe staining chamber accommodates standard 1" x 3" microscopic slides.\n\nHowever,\n\nsince the actual area of the slide exposed to the staining reagents is limited,\nthe slides must be prepared accordingly.\n\nThe area of a slide which can be\n\nstained is limited to a 3/4" circle in the center of the slide.\nExperimentation has shown that when making blood smears for the slide stainer\nthe drop of blood should be placed at the very end of the slide in order to\nbring the feathered leading edge of the smear into the center of the slide.\nMicro-organism slide preparation made from culture plates are best made as\nfollows:\n\nApproximately 20\n\n~l\n\nof water is placed in the center of the slide\n\nwith the drop dispenser of the stainer.\n\nA sterile needle is then used to\n\ntransfer a small quantity of a plate colony to the water drop.\n\nThe material\n\nis then mixed with the water drop to form an almost clear suspension spread\nover an area about 1/2" in diameter.\n\n10\n\nThe verification testing has demonstrated that the slide stainer has met the\nrequirements specified in section 3.0 of the Work Statement with the exception\nof the weight design goal.\n\nThe verification test report is found in Attach-\n\nment B.\nThe slide stainer is expected to have a useful life in excess of two years.\nReplacement of septums in the reagent dispensers, flushing probe and waste\nport has been provided for.\n\nAn occasional replacement of the "0" ring in the\n\nstaining chamber may be necessary.\nThe normal shelf-life exclusive of reagents of the prototype slide stainer\nunder normal warehouse conditions is expected to be greater than 3 years.\n\nThe\n\nshelf life of the reagents with the exception of Gram\'s iodine can be confidently predicted to be in excess of 1 year.\n\nThe shelf life of the Gram\'s\n\niodine reagent has been projected to be approximately 9 months based on limited\nlaboratory tests.\n\nRefer to Attachment E for a report on the stability testing\n\nof the reagents.\nThe only limited operating life items that can be identified at this time are\nthe waste collection bags which have a predicted one time use and the septums\nin the reagent dispenser, the water bag connection and waste port.\nfor changing these have been provided.\nVery

acceptable.\n\n5.2\n\nPerformance and Staining Demonstration\n\n5.2.1\n\nPerformance Results\n\nDuring the staining of the micro-organism slide preparations and the blood\nslides, the following required performance characteristics were demonstrated:\no\n\nThe ability of the slide holder to confine the slide in such a manner\nas to allow reagents and rinse solutions to pass over the area to be\nstained without escaping to the cabin atmosphere (Para. 3.2.1).\n\no\n\nThe ability of the slide staining cavity to facilitate the flow of\nreagents without serious entrapment of bubbles during the staining\nperiods.\n\no\n\nThe ability of the slide staining system to adequately flush the\nstains from the chamber prior to slide removal (Para. 3.2.2).\n\no\n\nThe confinement and handling of the stains and reagents in a manner\nthat prevents leakage and dissemination of liquids and vapors into\nthe cabin atmosphere (Para. 3.2.3).\n\no\n\nThe collecting of liquid waste and flushing air in disposable plastic\ncontainers, the volume of each to be adequate to contain all fluid\nand air flushes resulting from four Gram stains and two Wright\'s\nstains (Para. 3.2.4).\n\no\n\nThe waste containers to contain a liquid absorbent capable of absorbing\nthe liquid resulting from the four Gram stains and two Wright\'s stains,\nand designed to prevent spillage of the contents during disposal.\naccomplished by incorporating a check valve in the quick-disconnect\nliquid connector (Para. 3.2.4.1).\n\nB-7\n\nThis\n\no\n\nThe liquid transportation system was shown to exhibit a sufficiently\nlow reagent residual that contamination from the previous staining did\nnot adversely affect the following staining with the exception of the\nWright\'s staining of blood smears.\n\nPrior to fixing blood smears with\n\nabsolute alcohol the liquid transportation system, which contains\nresidual water from the previous staining, must be flushed out with\nthe absolute alcohol to remove the water.\n\nThis flushing has been\n\nfound necessary since during the fixing process any water which\ncontacts the blood smear will wash away or distort the red blood cells\npresent on the slide.\n\nThe flushing procedure prior to staining of\n\nblood smears requires three extra steps which require less than 15\nseconds and does not appear to be objectionable (Para. 3.2.7).\nThe water drop dispenser was shown to perform adequately after preliminary\npriming of the lines was accomplished (Para: 3.2.5).\nThe flushing system was demonstrated on the 26th after approximately 20 slides\nhad been stained.\n\nReagent dispenser G4 was removed from the slide stainer, the\n\nfront access door was opened and the flushing probe removed, and a dummy slide\nwas placed in the staining chamber.\n\nThe flushing valve also inside the front\n\naccess door was turned to the flushing position and the reagent selector valve\nturned to G4 position.\n\nThe tip of the flushing probe, containing a rubber\n\nseptum, was inserted into the G4 guide tube and pressed onto the needle at the\nfar end.\n\nThe water plunger was then pressed three times, at which time all the\n\nred color had been flushed from the liquid system into the waste bag.\n\nIt was\n\nexplained that flushing out of the remaining five reagent lines would be\nperformed in a like manner (Para. 3.2.9).\n\n5.2.2\n\nStaining Demonstration Results\n\nBlood smears and micro-organism slide preparations, as described in paragraph\n4.2.1.1, were stained with the prototype slide stainer following the operating\nprocedures developed for the unit.\n\nA number of similar preparations were\n\nstained using standard laboratory methods with reagents identical to those used\nin the prototype slide stainer.\n\nB-3\n\nThose blood smears which had been stained in the slide stainer were examined\nby both Dr. Ferguson and Mr. Day and found to be a good Wright\'s stain; the\nerythrocytes were a pink color, the granules of the neutrophils blue to lilac,\nthe eosinophils red, and the cytoplasm of the monocytes a pale blue.\n\nThe blood\n\nstaining was judged acceptable.\nThe results of the staining of the micro-organism slide preparations are given\nin Table 2, Morphology and Staining Characteristics of Micro-organisms Supplied\nby NASA.\nThe staining demonstration showed that a minimum of 16 Gram stains and 8 Wright\nstains could be performed with the reagents and supplies contained within the\nslide stainer.\n\nSince the reagent dispensers, water supply bag and waste\n\ncollecting bags are easily replaced within approximately ten minutes, the slide\nstainer has a capability in excess of that required (Para. 3.1.1).\nTABLE 2.\n\nIdentification\n\nMORPHOWGY AND STAINING

Coli\n\nDuring the staining demonstration an objection was raised, by those observing,\nthat in the Gram staining procedure two full measures of alcohol, reagent G3,\nwere used for decolorizing, which limited the total number of Gram stains per\n\nB-9\n\nreagent set to less than 16.\n\nTo correct this problem) it was suggested that\n\nfor each Gram stain decolorizing step the reagent dispenser G3 knob be rotated\none-half turn instead of a full turn.\nG3 would be required for each stain.\n\nThus) only one-half the amount of reagent\nThis procedure was tried with micro-\n\norganism 273 and 301 and in each case the results were the same as those in\nTable 2 in which twice the amount of decolorizing alcohol) reagent G3) was used.\nAfter Dr. Ferguson examined a few of the gram-positive staining micro-organism\npreparations which had been stained in the slide stainer) using 2 minutes\nstaining time for the counter stain) reagent G4) he questioned the appearance\nof what looked like gram-negative micro-organisms\' and commented that such could\nconfuse a non-trained observer.\n\nDr. Ferguson suggested that the gram-negative\n\nappearing structures might be a result of too long a counterstaining time.\n\nAn\n\nexperiment was tried in which both a gram-positive and a gram-negative microorganism were stained in the slide stainer using one minute counter-staining\ntime with reagent G4.\n\nThe gram-negative micro-organisms appeared the same as\n\nwith the two minute staining time but the gram-positive preparation showed a\nreduced amount of the gram-negative appearing substance.\n\n5.2.3\n\nStaining Procedures Compatibility with Skylab Potable Water\n\nThe water requirements for 16 Gram stains and 8 Wright\'s stains plus that\nrequired for flushing the lines after a mission and a safety factor of 25%\nadditional water totals 130 mI.\n\nSince one of the intended uses of the slide\n\nstainer will be on Skylab) a reduction in weight of the expendable supplies\nrequired for the stainer could be realized if the staining procedures could\nutilize ship\'s water for flushing.\n\nThe Skylab potable water supply system is\n\nexpected to supply water containing 36 ppm of potassium iodide and 6 ppm of\niodine) as a means of sterilizing the water.\n\nThe effect of these sterilizing\n\nagents on the staining procedures of the Gram stain and Wright\'s stain was\nunknown.\n\nThus an experiment was conducted to test the staining procedures with\n\nflushing water simulating that which would be obtained from Skylab\'s potable\nwater supply.\n\nDuplicat2 blood smears and gram-positive and gram-negative\n\nmicro-organism slide preparations were made and stained.\n\nOne set used\n\ndistilled water for flushing and the other used water containing 36 ppm of\npotassium iodide and 6 ppm of iodine.\n\nMicroscopic examination of both sets of\n\nslides revealed no detectable difference in the staining.\nB-lO\n\nFR-1086-l0

much information on the stability of chemical\n\nreagents and analytical solutions, but much information is lacking on the\nstability of biological staining preparations.\n\nThis lack of data on stains is\n\nespecially noticeable in the area of storage or compatibility of the stains\nwhen in contact with many of the recently developed plastics.\nThe initial concept of a slide stainer for space application projected the use\nof lightweight plastics for many parts of such a slide stainer.\n\nThe current\n\nprototype slide stainer development originally considered utilizing modified\nplastic syringes for both storage and dispensing purposes.\n\nHowever, lack of\n\ncompatibility and stability data delayed the final configuration of the dual\npurpose containers which were to be both storage and dispensing units.\n\n2.0\n\nPRELIMINARY STUDIES\n\nFour months prior to the awarding of the present slide stainer contract, the\nstability and compatibility of the staining reagents with plastic materials was\nrecognized as a serious problem which could not be resolved without actual long\nterm testing.\n\n2.1\n\nThus, the following test was initiated.\n\nStorage of Gram Stain Reagents in Plastic Syringes\n\nSixteen commercially available sterile plastic disposable syringes made of\npolypropylene with a rubber tipped plunger were labeled with numbers 1 to 16.\nEach was weighed to the nearest milligram.\ngroups.\n\nThe syringes were divided into four\n\nEach group was filled with one of the following Gram Stain reagents\n\nand sealed with a plastic cap.\n\nE-l\n\nGram Stain Reagents:\nA\n\nCrystal violet\n\nB\n\nGrams Iodine\n\nC\n\nDenatured alcohol\n\nD\n\nAqueous Safranin\n\nEach group was divided into duplicate sets, one set to be stored at room\ntemperature and the other to be stored at 37\xc2\xb0C.\n\nAll syringes were weighed\n\nafter filling, and one set every ten days thereafter for a period of 40 days.\nAll syringes were examined periodically during the 40-day exposure.\n\nThe\n\nalcohol containing syringes lost weight more rapidly than the others.\n\nEach\n\nweek one of the syringe sets from each temperature group was used to stain both\ngram-positive and gram-negative micro-organism slide preparations.\nSummary of test results:\n1.\n\nSyringes containing Gram\'s Iodine began to turn yellow-brown after\napproximately ten days, and the iodine solution became colorless in\nless than 3 weeks.\n\n2.\n\nAfter two weeks, Gram\'s iodine solutions stored at 37\xc2\xb0C in the plastic\nsyringes no longer yielded acceptable gram positive staining reactions.\n\n3.\n\nThe remainder of the Gram Stain reagents stored in the plastic syringes\nfor 40 days at both room temperature and 37\xc2\xb0C yielded acceptable gram\nstains.\n\n4.\n\nFluid loss even at 37\xc2\xb0C, the worst case, was less than 0.5% in 40 days\nwhich could be considered negligible.\n\n5.\n\nSyringes containing the crystal violet reagent and Safranin reagent\nbegan to show signs of freezing of the plunger after 40 days.\n\n2.2\n\nStorage of Gram Stain Reagents in All Glass Syringes\n\nTwo sets of Gram stain reagents were placed in a series of all glass syringes,\ncapped with a plastic cap and stored at 37\xc2\xb0C over a weekend.\n\nE-2\n\nOne set of\n\nsyringes was lubricated with a silicone grease while the other was not.\n\nThose\n\nsyringes not containing the silicone grease were frozen with the exception of\nthe alcohol syringes which had showed a significant loss in weight.\n\nAlthough\n\nthe silicone coated syringes did not freeze over the weekend, leakage between\nbarrel and plunger was observed for all syringes.\n\nIn addition, moderate\n\npressure on the plunger when the tip was blocked revealed a surprisingly amount\nof leakage between the glass barrel and the glass plunger.\n2.3\n\nPreliminary Test Conclusions\n\nPlastic syringes are not suitable for long term storage of Gram\'s Iodine\nreagent.\n\nPlastic syringes have a slight tendency to freeze when Gram Stain\n\nreagents are stored in them for prolonged periods.\nAll glass syringes are unsuitable for storing Gram Stain reagents because of\nthe freezing problems and the excessive leakage.\n3.0\n\nEVALUATION OF GLASS-TEFLON GAS TIGHT SYRINGES\n\nCommercially available gas tight syringes having a glass barrel and a Teflon\ntipped plunger can be obtained with capacities up to 30 mI.\n\nSuch syringes\n\ntheoretically appeared to be the answer of the storage/dispenser concept for\nthe slide stainer.\n\nA number of these syringes were purchased and evaluated\n\nwith Gram stain reagents.\nTwo sets of the 30 ml glass-Teflon syringes were filled with the four Gram\nStain reagents and the tip sealed with Teflon surfaced septum.\n\nOne set was\n\nstored at room temperature while the other was stored at 37\xc2\xb0C.\n\nThe reagents\n\nused for the test were made 4 days previously to the start of the test and\nfiltered through fine filter paper with the aid of vacuum.\n\nThe Gram\'s Iodine\n\nwas filtered through a Teflon filter.\nTwo analytical procedures for the iodine content of the Gram\'s iodine reagent\nwere investigated.\n\nOne consisted of diluting the Gram\'s iodine solution until\n\nan absorption reading could be obtained in a spectrophotometer at 350\n\nm~.\n\nThis\n\nprocedure did not yield meaningful data when a series of dilutions were prepared\nand absorption data obtained and plotted.\nE-3\n\nA second procedure, which has been successful, consisted in diluting the Gram\'s\nIodine sample 1-20 with water, then extracting the iodine with carbon tetrachloride solution at 515\n\nm~.\n\nCalibrating solutions containing 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,\n\n4.0 and 8.0 mg iodine per ml of carbon tetrachloride yielded a calibration\ncurve which followed Beer\'s law.\n\nThis analytical procedure was used to measure\n\nthe iodine content of samples taken from each of the Gram\'s iodine solutions in\nthe syringes and also of the stock solution which was stored in a tightly\ncapped brown bottle.\n\nAnalysis of the Gram\'s iodine solutions was carried out\n\nevery 7 days for 49 days.\n\nPeriodically all syringes were examined for leaks,\n\nand occasionally the Gram staining characteristics of the reagents in the\nsyringes and those stored in a normal laboratory manner were tested by staining\nmicro-organism slide preparations taken from fresh known cultures.\n3.1\n\nResults of Evaluation of Glass-Teflon Gas Tight Syringes with Gram\nStain Reagents\n\nThe evaluation period lasted for approximately 73 days.\n\nThe Gram stain\n\nreagents with the exception of the Gram\'s iodine did not appear to change when\nstored in the described syringes for the test period.\n\nThe iodine content of\n\nthe Gram\'s iodine reagent showed a decreasing level during the first 35 days\nfor all methods of storage, but appears to have leveled off.\nFigure 1.\n\nThis is shown in\n\nAfter 73 days, all Gram stain reagents stored in the glass-Teflon\n\nsyringes yielded acceptable Gram stains of known micro-organisms.\nThe stability of the Gram\'s Iodine reagent stored in the glass-Teflon syringes\ncan be predicted to be satisfactory for up to 280 days based on the limited\ndata obtained.\n\nThe stability of the other three Gram stain reagents stored in\n\nthe described syringes should be stable for at least one year.\nThe Cameo Quick Stain (Wright\'s Stain) has been stored in a plastic container\nfor two years without affecting its performance.\nthe syringes can be expected to be similar.\n\nE-4\n\nTherefore, its stability in\n\nREAGENT DISPENSERS\n\nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\nPROTOTYPE SLIDE STAINER\n\nBLOOD STAIN\n\nGRAM
