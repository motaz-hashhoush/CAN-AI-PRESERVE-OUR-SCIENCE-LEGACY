and no coverage has been\nrecorded over Iceland.\n\nThe Cascades\'imagery is\n\nimportant for the\'final stages of ground sensor (DCS)\nsite selection and emplacement--the DCS sites should be\nselected at identifiable locations on the images.\nFor the Iceland part of experiment 251, the lack\nof MSS imagery is particularly critical because no DCS\nsites are possible there.\n\nMSS image coverage is\n\nessential during the late summer period before fall\nsnows obscure the structural and volcanic features to\nbe studied.\n\nThen, comparative MSS images will be\n\nneeded for the fall and winter.\nd.\n\nAccomplishments during initial reporting period\'\n.\'(IJuly 1 - September 1, 1972).\n(1)\n\nThe first round of seasonal aerial infrared\n\nscanner missions over Lassen Volcanic National Park,\nMount Rainier, Mount Saint Helens, and Mount Baker have\nbeen successfully completed under USGS and USFS auspices.\nThermal anomalies of volcanic or geothermal origin at the\nprospective DCS sites were recorded on film and have\nbeen plotted on topographic base maps.\n\n- 2 -\n\n(2)\n\nGround reconnaissance of the Lassen, Mount\n\nBaker, and Mount Saint Helens sites has been completed\nand prospective sites for emplacement of DCS sets have\nbeen selected (pending receipt of the first MSS or RBV\nimage coverage).\n\nGround temperature measurements were\n\nmade at the surface of anomalously warm areas and, where\npossible, at shallow depth to determine the near-surface\ntemperature gradient.\n\nThe geothermal nature of the\n\nanomalies at the selected sites has thus been verified.\n(3)\n\nFive thermistor arrays consisting of eight\n\nprobes each and appropriate interfacing for the G.E.\nDCS platforms and transmitter sets have been essentially\ncompleted and we are awaiting receipt of the modified DCS\nsets at the Mississippi Test Facility.\n(4)\n\nA USGS computer program has been set up to\n\ninterpret experiment 251 DCS data which will be received\nin punchcard format as sent out from Goddard Spaceflight\nCenter.\n\nThe main USGS program will produce a weekly\n\nwritten report on a standard printer and a cumulative\nnine-track tape record.\n\nA Data Presentation System plot\n\nroutine will display a monthly graph of fumaroles, ground\nand shallow subsurface temperatures of the Cascades\' sites,\nas well as convective heat flow and radiance calculations\nfor selected thermistor probes.\n\n- 3 -\n\ne.\n\nSignificant scientific results\nA systematic aircraft program to monitor changes\n\nin the thermal emission from volcanoes of the Cascade\nRange has been initiated by the U.S. Geological Survey\nand is being carried out in conjunction with ERTS-1\nthermal surveillance experiments.\n\nNight overflights\n\nby U.S. Forest Service, NASA MSC, and other available\naircraft equipped with thermal infrared scanners\nsensitive to terrestrial emission in the 4-5.5 and\n8-14 pm bands are currently being carried out at intervals\nof a few months.\n\nPreliminary results confirm that Mount\n\nRainier, Mount Baker, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Shasta,\nand the Lassen area continue to be thermally active,\nalthough with the exception of Lassen which erupted\nbetween 1914 and 1917, and Mount Saint Helens which had\na series of eruptions between 1831 and 1834, there has\nbeen no recent eruptive activity.\n\nExcellent quality\n\ninfrared images recorded over Mount Rainier, as recently\nas April, 1972, show similar thermal patterns to those\nreported in 1964-1966.\n\nInfrared images of Mount Baker\n\nrecorded in November 1970 and again in April 1972\nrevealed a distinct array of anomalies 1,000 feet below\nthe crater rim and associated with fumaroles or structures\npermitting convective heat transfer to the surface.\n(Category(\'3C)\n\n- 4 -\n\nf.\n\nA listing of published articles, etc.\nNone.\n\ng.\n\nRecommendation for maximum utilization of the\nERTS-1 system\nSee item c.\n\nThe scheduling of MSS recording\n\ntime over Iceland before the end of the summer season\nis essential to success of the Iceland part of this\nexperiment; therefore, a special appeal is hereby\nmade\'for priority on a minimum of satellite tape\nrecorder time to achieve this goal, in order to carry\nout the objectives mutually agreed upon in the work\nstatement of NASA SR 251.\nSimilarly, it is assumed that the DCP sets will\nbe received in modified form and in working order so\nthat they may be laboratory tested for one week (at\nMTF) and then emplaced at already selected sites in the\nCascade Range before the end of the summer season.\nh.\n\nA\n\nlisting of changes in Standing Order forms\n\nNone submitted from project office, but see\nMr. Ed Crump, Technical-Monitor, for any changes in\nStanding Order forms submitted by his office.\ni.\n\nERTS Image Descriptor forms\nWill provide ERTS Image Descriptor forms when ERTS\n\nimagery over experiment areas is received.\nj.\n\nListing by date of any ch"anged Data Request forms\nSee item h.\n\n- 5 -\n\nk.\n\nStatus of DCP\nData Collection Platforms not yet\n\nSee item c.\n\nreceived (as of August 25, 1972).\n\nI,\n\n.
