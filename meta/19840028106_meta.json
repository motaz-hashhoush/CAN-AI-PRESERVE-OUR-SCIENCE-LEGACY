In the laminar region of an airfoil, roughness interferes with smooth flow and tends to encourage transition from laminar to turbulent flow upstream of its normal point of occurrence. In the airfoil's turbulent region, roughness considerably worsens the turbulent friction coefficient, thereby increasing the drag coefficient. Consequent dramatic decreases of maximum lift coefficient at high angles of attack lead to premature stall. Such decreases in stall angle destroy the safety margin of an aircraft approaching stall. An assessment is given to the state of knowledge in this field of research.", "title": "Wing contamination - Threat to safe flight", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840028106, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Luers, J.
