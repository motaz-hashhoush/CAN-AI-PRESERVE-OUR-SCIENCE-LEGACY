The fluid-displacing apparatus, which\nuses the principle of the manometer, is shown in the\ndrawing. It will measure the leakage of gases across\nvalve seats, for example, and check components and\n\nsystems of components independent of size in relatively short periods of time. Since no back pressure is\nbuilt up, the volume between the component being\nchecked for leakage and this device does not require\ncalibration.\nThe apparatus consists essentially of a well-type\nmanometer where the well and U tube are of the same\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

As fluid is displaced due to leakage of gases,\nthe fluid will spill over into the calibrated tube where\nthe amount of leakage can be determined.\nThe quick disconnect provides for attachment to the\ncomponent or system test point. A three-way valve\nallows the system to be vented until the reading is\nmade. The timer, which is mechanically linked to the\nthree-way valve, starts automatically when the valve\nis switched to the test position, and stops automatically when the valve is switched to the vent position.\nValve 1 vents the well when refilling with fluid from the\npump. A vent to the atmosphere is provided when not\nused in a closed system.\nThe volume compensator maintains proper volume\nin the well, which contains a suitable manometer fluid,\nand in the calibrated tube, which collects displaced\nfluid. Valve 2 seals the well from the refill line. Valve\n3 can be utilized to shorten the time of reading by\nstoring the leakage gases which will help to overcome\nfluid inertia, surface tension, and temperature variation.\n\nBrief 70-10302\t\n\nThe glass valve provides drainage of the calibrated\ntube after a reading has been taken.. Valve 4 vents the\nreservoir for the displaced fluid. A pump returns the\ndisplaced fluid to the well.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nManned Spacecraft Center, Code BM7\nHouston, Texas 77058\nReference: B70-10302\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: Martin J.
