In recent years, Small Satellites offer a path to new types of observations for Earth and space science. NASA recognizes the value and impact of Small Satellites, from CubeSats to ESPA-class satellites, for high-value science missions to support exploration through innovative technologies. With smaller size, lower cost, more rapid solicitation, and with constellation missions, our Small Satellite missions can perform targeted science, prove out new technologies, increase our science capabilities to add to our understanding of how we can improve life on earth and in space. Our Small Satellites missions have produced synchronic, high spatial, and temporal science measurements to our changing earth, demonstrating that such missions must be part of our platforms for unique science measurements. We are also able to educate and train the next generation of scientists and engineers by means of these high-risk lower-cost missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "MY", "submissionId": 20220009756, "endDate": "2022-07-22T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Dr Toh Chia Ming"}}, "meetingId": "ef3afd53bf8a4c07be307734430cafec", "id": "b5c84a1c8d8846b5bf916367c02d81bb"}], "name": "IGARSS 2022", "location": "Kuala Lumpur", "id": "ef3afd53bf8a4c07be307734430cafec", "url": "https://igarss2022.org/technical_program.php", "startDate": "2022-07-17T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "IGARSS_protecting_and_improving_life_on_earth_in_Space.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220009756/downloads/IGARSS_protecting_and_improving_life_on_earth_in_Space.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220009756/downloads/IGARSS_protecting_and_improving_life_on_earth_in_Space.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220009756/downloads/IGARSS_protecting_and_improving_life_on_earth_in_Space.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
