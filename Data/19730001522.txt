The required specifications were determined in\na study by Singh (2).\n\nThe specifications actually achieved\n\nare reported throughout the succeeding chapters and are\nsummarized in the concluding chapter.\n\nIn order to give per-\n\nspective into this problem area, some of the recent work\nreported is summarized here.\n1.2 PREVIOUS RESULTS\nLusignan et al. (3) describe a 2.5GHz waveguide\nbalanced-mixer low-cost receiver with a.design goal of 9db\nnoise figure. The receiver bandwidth-is 40MHz. The sugf*\ngested local oscillator is a cavity mounted Gunn diode.\nA 100KHz video guard band would be required if the LO is\noperated without phase locking. No AFC loop was described\nin this report.\n\nThe balanced mixer is proposed^to elimin-\n\nate the expected large AM noise component from the Gunn\ndiode.\n\nPrevious work done at Washington University (4-9)\n\nIndicates that they should be very good LO\'s with lower\nAM noise than even "low noise" klystrons.\nGeneral Electric has also reported on a single channel\niJQMHz bandwidth X-band receiver (10.). The balanced mixer\nwas implemented in stripline and used ultrasonically\nbonded beamrlead diodes.\n\nThe input bandpass filters had a\n\nmldband insertion loss of 3db. A noise figure of\n11.0 \xc2\xb1 .Idb was measured (Including the IF amplifier) with\nan LO power of 5dbm.\n\nA Varian VSX-9001 Gunn oscillator\n\nyielded an uncompensated frequency stability of about\n\n- 3200KHz/\xc2\xb0C. Addition of a temperature compensating alumina\nprobe reduced the drift to less than 20KHz/\xc2\xb0C. A 15db gain\ntransistor IP amplifier was used.\n\nIt had a 150MHz band-\n\nwidth and a 3db noise figure.\nAn X-band microstrip mixer using GaAs Schottky Barrier\nDiodes which used a 500MHz thin film IF preamplifier was\nreported by K. M. Johnson (11).\n\nThe balanced mixer used\n\nfilters to terminate the image frequency in a short circuit\nat the diode.\nfigure.\n\nThe thin film IP amplifier had a 2.2db noise\n\nThe total mixer noise figure was 6.7db.\n\nRCA Laboratories (12) developed a low noise (6.4db)\nX-band receiver with a total signal gain of 39db. The\n500MHz IF amplifier had a 5^0MHz bandwidth and a 3db noise\nfigure.\n\n-\n\n-..-..\n\nOxley (13) has described an X-band receiver using\nplanar GaAs Schottky Barrier Diade.s in a balanced, mixer\nconfiguration.\n\nA 6db noise figure was obtained.\n\nWestinghouse (14) reported results at 9.5GHz using a\nsingle-ended mixer and a IGHz IF. A conversion loss of\n4db was achieved using a GaAs chip diode and sum and image\nfrequency recovery techniques. Further results (15,16)\nin addition to those above are summarized in Table 1.\nThe Washington University 12GHz down-converter described\nherein uses waveguide, coaxial, and microstrip transmission\nline elements.\n\nNecessary filtering is done exclusively in\n\nmicrostrip for reasons to be explained later.\n\nThe mixing\n\n-li-\n\n,\n\n1\n\nWWK\nEH CO \xc2\xa3> ^\nCO H CD X>\n>H O H TJ\nCO 3 fc^-\'\n\nVD\n\nf-\n\nin\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n-N-\n\nOJ\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCM\n\nco\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nU3\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n\nin\n\nCM\nrH\n\nt-\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCM\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nin\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nvo\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nw\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n<U\nO\n0)\n\nco \xc2\xa3> ^\nM O X>\n\nfc O H tJ\nM 3 fe \xe2\x80\x94\n\n3\nO\n\nco co *~\xc2\xbb\n\nCQ\nI\nXJ\n\n3 \xc2\xab CO X>\nO W O -O\n0 > J^\n\nCO\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4J\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nJH\n0)\n.p\nO\n\nQ\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\n1\n\n^\n\n0\n^3-\n\nO\nCM\n\n0\n\no\n\no\no\n\nO\nCO\n\no\no\n\n0\n\nin\n\nin\n\xe2\x80\xa2=T\n\nN\n\ns\n\'fc\n\nCM\nH\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\nin\n\no\no\no\n\nin\n\no\nin\n\n^y\n\n0\n\n0\nO\nCO\n\nin\n\no\nc\xe2\x80\x94\n\no\nin\nvo\n\nCM\nrH\n\nCM\nrH\n\nVO\n\nrH\n\nM\n\noj\n\nin\nc-^\nm\n\ncu"\nc\n\nCO\n\n^\n\nW\nQ\nO\nH\nQ\n\nf-.\n\nO\n\nCU\n\nCO\n\n\xc2\xaba;\ncd\n0\n\nW\nC5\n\n(U\n\n"S\n\n, 1\n\nrH\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\ncd o Q\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2sj Q\n\ncd CQ\n\nCdCQ\n\nCD CL, co\n\nO CO\n\ni\n\n<\xc2\xa3 O\ncd CQ\nC5 CO\n\nC\ncu\n\ni\n\nO\n\nM\n\n<\n\nCO\n\xc2\xab\nCO Jtf\n\nON\n\nC\n\n<\xc2\xa3\n\nQ\nW\n0\n\nCTN\n\nin\n\nON\n\nN\n\nw\no\n\nO\n\ncd\nEH\n\n1\n\nCQ\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa3\n\nX!\nO\n\nCU\n\nVO\n\n0\nO\n\nhj^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2=r\n\nO\nO\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQ EH\'N\nt\xe2\x80\x94f\n\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\na\n\nVD\ntO\nrH\n\n"CM\n\n<Q\n\ncd cd\n\ncd cd\n\n\xc2\xabs| Q\n\nC2 CO\n\nCQ J\n\nCQ i 1\n\nC3 CO\n\ni\n\nI\n\nCO\n\nrH\n\nG T3\n\ncd CQ\n\nCD O\n\ng-d\n\nCU 0)\n\n1\n\nCD\n\n.\n\n.\n\nrH\n\nrH\n\nCQ\n\nCQ\n\n0\nM\n\no\n\nH\nrH\n\nx-v\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2*-*\n\nCM\nrH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nv_x\n\nX CO\n0) C\nEH H\n\nC3?\n\ng\n\ncd\n\n< K M\nCQ O CO\n\nM\nC\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\n\nH\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\nrH\n\nrH\n\nH\n\nCQ\n\nCQ\n\ncd\nCQ\n\nH\n\n2\n*\n\nO\nH\n\nU\nH\n\n\xc2\xa3\n1 rH\n\nin\n\ncd\nCQ\n\ncd\n\nc\na\n\n0\n\ncu\n\ncu\n.\n\ncdcQ\n\n0\n\n0\n\nW\n\nCO\n\ncd\n\ncd\n\n1\ni~n\n\nto\n\nc\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nco\n\n1 W 0\n\n\xc2\xa3S H\n\n*\xc2\xa70\n\n0\n.H\n\nM\n\nO\n\nro\n>H\n\ne\xc2\xa3\nOH\n\ns\no\n0\n\nCO\n\ncd 4-^\n\nO\n\nK\n\nrH\n^\n\n1\nC\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 O t-t\nO 0 O\n\xe2\x80\xa2 -H 4J\nW E 0\n\n. cu d\n\nU CO T3\n\nbO*\xe2\x80\x94*\xe2\x80\xa2\nC\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4->\nCO\n<U\n\n0)\nCO\nS\nO\n\n>.c\n\nrH\nv_^\n\nrH CO\n\nCo\n\nX-N\n\nH\n\nto\n\n^s\n\na\ni cu \xe2\x80\xa2H\nCU ^sj\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94i ^""^\nC\n\nrH XI\n\nrH C\n\nCQ ^\n\nEH \xc2\xab-.\n\ncu cd\n\nC5\n\n13\n\ncu a\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H V\xc2\xa3>\nXI rH\n\nvo\n\nH\n\nx^\nt\xc2\xa3j\nffi\n\n3\n\n\'\n\n- 5process itself occurs In a coaxlally mounted Schottky\nBarrier Diode. The diode cavity was designed so as to\naccommodate both ceramic cartridge and pill-prong mounted\nSi and GaAs diodes, respectively.\nSection 1.4 of this chapter considers the mixing process itself. The diode DC i-v characteristic will be\napproximated by a simple exponential curve to illustrate\nthe mathematical origin of the various frequency components.\n1.3 SCOPE\n\nChapter 2 is concerned with microwave propagation in\nmicrostrip and how this knowledge can be applied to device\ndesign. This is followed by an analysis and experimental\nresults for a directional coupler, a lowpass filter and a\ntraveling-wave directional filter. The-section concludes\nwith some data taken for a band-stop filter.\nChapter 3 develops the rationale for the specific\ndesign choices that were made.\n\nIncluded are early crystal\n\nholder results and the transition to the final package\ndesign.\n\nJustification for the final microstrip circuit is\n\ngiven and mismatch data for the unmounted board is presented,\nPerformance data for the developmental downconverter is given in Chapter 4. Final discussion and\nsummarized results can be found in the concluding\nChapter 5.\n1.4\n\nMIXED FREQUENCY SPECTRUM\'\n\nAs an Introduction to the X-band down-converter\nreported here, we first consider the mixing process.\n\nThe\n\n- 6-\n\nDC i-v characteristic of an idealized mixer diode is\ngiven by:\nI\n\n= i s (e<lV/nkT _ D\n\n= i s ( e \xc2\xabV .\n\n1)\n\n(1>1)\n\nwhere:\n\nIg\n\n= diode saturation current\n\nq\n\n= electronic charge\n\nV = voltage across the Junction\nn\n\n= constant = 1\n\nk\n\n=\xc2\xbb Boltzman\'s constant\n\nT\n\n\xc2\xab= absolute temperature\n\na\n\n= q/nkT\n\nNow, expanding the current as a Taylor expansion about the\nDC level VQ leads to\nI = I(V )-+ SV^L -f i d^I (6V)2 + higher order terms\n2\n\ndv\n\ndV2\n\n(1,2)\n\nwhen\nal e\n\n"\n\ns\n\n- a2Is\nS\n\n~2\ndV\n\nThese quantities can be measured directly around the operat\ning point of a diode i-v characteristic (see Figure 19).\n\nAnd,\n\n6V\n\n=\n\nV\n\nLO+ VSIG\n\n=\n\nV\n\nL coswt\n\n+V\n\nS\n\n- 7with\nw\n\n=\n\nlocal oscillator (LO) radian frequency\n\nw+B\n\n=\n\nsignal radian frequency\n\nAlso,\n(6V) 2\n\n= JV L coswt + V s cos(w+3)tj\n\xc2\xab\n\n(1.5)\n\nVL cos 2 o)t + v| cos 2 (w\xc2\xab-B)t\n+\xe2\x80\xa2 2V J-l O cos(wt) cos(w\xc2\xbb-8)t\nT Vc,\n\xe2\x80\x94 (1 + cos2wt)\n2\n+ V.V_(cos3t + cos(2w+B)t)\nLi\n\nO\n\nEquation (1.5) yields a DC component plus the intermediate\nfrequency (IP) and the sum frequency in addition to the\nsecond harmonics of the LO and signal.\n\nThe above process\n\nhas been simplified in several major respects:\n1.\n\nOnly the fundamental LO frequency was considered.\n\n2. Only second order terms were considered in the\ntransfer characteristic.\n3. Only the first mixing components were considered,\ni.e., the frequencies produced by the first\nmixing in turn mix with the original LO and signal\nfrequencies in addition to each other.\n\nObviously\n\nthe physical process is a good deal more complicated than that described above.\nA final correction must be mentioned.\n\nThe transfer\n\ncharacteristic given is that for a diode exhibiting an ideal\n\n- 8-\n\nexponential i-v characteristic.\n\nA rigorous derivation by\n\nBarber (17) allows for the more realistic situation of a\nnon-ideal exponential i-v characteristic in addition to\na non-sinusoidal pumping waveform.\n\n- 9-\n\n2.\n2.1\n\nFILTER FABRICATION IN MICROSTRIP\n\nMICROWAVE PROPAGATION IN MICROSTRIP\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, microstrip was\nchosen as the medium to be used for the design of the\nvarious filter networks of the mixer.\n\nRequisite to the\n\ndesign of such devices Is a knowledge of microwave propa?gation on microstrip specifically including such parameters\nas characteristic impedance, velocity of propagation, and\n.capacitance. The above characterization has been well established In the literature (18-21).\nFor the design of devices with more than two ports,\nthe even and odd mode normal Impedances and velocities of\ncoupled pairs of microstrip lines must be known. Bryant and\nWeiss .(18) have presented a solution to the problem in, the\n"quasi-static" limit valid for propagation In the low\ngigahertz region.\nConsider the pair of coupled microstrip transmission\nlines In Figure 1. The characteristics of the structure\nare usually specified as functions of the parameters W/H, \\,,\nS/H and K, where W is the strip width, H is the thickness\nof the dielectric, S is the space between the strips and\nK is the relative dielectric constant.\n\nThe strip thickness\n\nis assumed to be Infinitesimal.\nThe electrostatic problem is then solved rigorously\nfor the capicitance of single and coupled strips on a\n\n- 10 -\n\nMICROSTRIP\n\nDIELECTRIC\nSUBSTRATE\n\nGROUND PLANE\n\nFigure 1.\n\nA Coupled Pair of Mlcrostrip Lines.\n\n- 11 dielectric substrate.\n\nThis solution can then be applied\n\nto the case at hand, that is, propagation at microwave\nfrequencies, by. assuming a negligible longitudinal field\ncomponent, thus yielding a TEM solution.\nReferring to Figure 1, both strips are at a potential\nV for even mode propagation and have opposite signs but\nequal magnitude for odd mode propagation.\nfor odd mode propagation only.\n\nCoupling occurs\n\nAfter the charge and poten-\n\ntial distributions have been determined from the field configurations, the capacitance per strip CK can be found,\nwhere CK = Q/V, and Q is the given charge distribution.\n\nNote\n\nthat the above charge and potential distributions are that\nof a nonhomogeneous boundary value problem, a bounded dielectric substrate and free space above.\n\nThis implies the\n\nneed for an effective relative dielectric constant.\nThe effective dielectric constant of the medium, Keff,\ncan then be given as K-eff\n\n= C\n\nK/C0 wfte**e C0 is the capacitance\n\nfor the case of microstrip in vacuum.\n\nThis parameter is\n\nnecessary for the determination of the wavelength in the\ngiven medium, XK\nwavelength.\n\n= X0/SKeff\xc2\xbb where A is the free space\n\nSimilarly, the velocity of propagation in the\n\nmedium is given by v = c//Keff where c is the speed of light\nin vacuum. Finally, the characteristic impedance of the\nmedium ZQ may be calculated as\n\nZ\n\xc2\xb0\n\n=\n\n1\n\n1\n\n/5 -> \\\n\n- 12 -\n\n2.2\n\nDIRECTIONAL COUPLER\n\nGiven the characteristic impedance, velocity of propagation and effective dielectric constant for coupled microstrip transmission lines, standard microwave devices may\nnow be designed.\n\nOne of the primary tasks in the design of\n\na mixer that must be immediately identified is that of\ncombining the signal frequency and the local oscillator or\npump.\n\nSeveral configurations are available for this duty.\n\nTwo will be described in this chapter.\n\nThe first to be dis-\n\ncussed is the directional coupler.\n2.2.1\n\nDesign and Analysis\nThe directional coupler is a four-port device that has\n\nthe following properties (22). Referring to Figure 2,\na wave incident in port 1 couples power into-ports 2 and\n3 but is isolated from port 4.

With power incident on any one\nport, the remaining three ports remain matched, so.that the\ninput reflection coefficient is zero, the transfer function\nbetween the input port and a second port.is band-pass,\nwhile the transfer function between the input port and a\nthird port is band stop, and the fourth port is isolated.\nThese ideal transmission characteristics are summarized in\nFigure 9.\n\n- 32 -\n\nCO\nCO\n\no\n\nCO\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nFigure 9.\n\nMicrostrip Traveling-Wave Filter Mask and\nIdeal Response Characteristics.\n\n- 33 -\n\n2.1.1\n\nDesign and Analysis.\nThe traveling wave directional filter was first re-\n\nported by Coale\'(25).. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the resonant loop is that resonant energy is in\nthe form of traveling waves as opposed to standing wave\nresonances as would be found in a cavity resonator.\n\nAlso,\n\nif the coupling coefficient of the directional couplers\nare chosen properly, 100 per cent of the Input to the first\ncoupler can be extracted by the second coupler (2*O.\n\nWith\n\nadditional loops between the two couplers, the desired\nresponse can be effected.\nAn attempt was made to analyze the traveling-wave\nfilter by constructing the 4 x l\\ scattering matrix of the\ndevice and then cascading it with the Input voltage column\nmatrix in a fashion exactly analogous to that pursued for\nthe directional coupler analysis in Section 2.2.1 of this\nchapter.\n\nThis attempt did not yield satisfactory results, -\n\nIt is believed that the ma.lor source of error is the fact\nthat the scattering parameters used rely on reference plane\nlocations inconsistent for the given device.\nStandley (24) has carried out an analysis that reduces\nthe four-port problem to that of two equivalent two-port\nproblems.\n\nThe reduction is based on applying, alternately,\n\nsymmetrical and anti-symmetrical excitations to two of the\nfour ports.\n\nThe response characteristics are then found\n\n- 34 -\n\nby superposition of the transfer and -reflection coefficients\nfor the two cases.\nIn the analysis of the ideal case, it is assumed\nthat all transmission lines have the same characteristic\n-impedance, there are no discontinuities internal to the\nloop and the device is lossless.\n\nThis result is then\n\nextended to the case where the impedance of the sections\nconnecting the coupled lines are not equal to the characteristic impedance of the balance of the system (26).

The internal mismatch\nparameter taken alone does allow one to predict the magnitude and location in frequency of the double peak response\nfor ports 1*2 and l-*3- This double response was not predicted or accounted for by other workers (23,25).\nIf further work is to be done on this device it is\nfelt that the analysis should be revised to include the\neffects of external port mismatch.\n\nWith this modification,\n\na model of sufficient accuracy should result precluding the\nneed for numerous experimental iterations normally required\nwhen optimizing this device.\n\n- 43 -\n\n2.5 QUARTER-WAVE STOP-BAND FILTER\n\nAlso considered was a rejection or band-stop filter.\nTht specific type, pictured in Figure 14, has been described\nin the literature (14,27) and has been used for the same\npurpose, namely image and sum enhancement techniques.\nThis structure was proposed by Jones and Bolljahn (28)\nand IB pictured in Figure 15.

The design goal was to \';.,!\nachieve a minimal insertion loss in the pass band region\nwhile retaining a reasonable stop-band capability at the\n\n50fl FILTER\n\nFigure 14.\n\nHIGH IMPEDANCE FILTER\nWITH IMPEDANCE MATCHING\nTRANSFORMERS\n\nRejection Filters with and without Impedance\nMatching Transformers.\n\n8\n\nJ"*i.\n\n/Zne fcOO\n08 2\nJ\n\n0\n\nFigure 15.\n\nI\n\nB,\n\nA Coupled Micros-trip Transmission Line Segment\nand Its Response.\n\ndesign frequency.\n\nIt was thought that this could best be\n\nachieved with high impedance lines and therefore tight\ncoupling sections matched to 50Q input and output by quarterwave Impedance transformers were investigated first.\n\nThis\n\napproach resulted in an unsatisfactory filter response.\nA uniform 50fl structure was then fabricated.\n\nIts\n\nexperimental insertion loss characteristic is shown in\nFigure 16.\n\nIt exhibits a high insertion loss of 2Udb at\n\nthe design frequency with a 3db bandwidth of 200MHz.\nWith further iteration in the design, it is felt that the\nnecessary 500MHz bandwidth could be achieved.\nLooking ;at Figure 16, it is seen that the residual\npassband insertion-loss -is on the order-of-2db.\n\nThe total\n\nlength of the test filter was one inch, which accounts for\n0.8 db of insertion loss due to dissipative dielectric\nloss.\n\nFor integration in the final mixer circuit, the\n\ndissipative loss due to the filter would be negligible\nsince the signal path length would not need to be increased.\nThe additional one db of loss is due to a VSWR of 2:1 to\n2,6:1 in the passband region of the filter.\nThe proposed use of this filter, i.e., image and sum\nenhancement, would each produce improvements in the overall\nnoise performance of under one db.\n\nTherefore, for this\n\nfilter to be of use, further work would have to be done to\nimprove the passband VSWR.\n\n6.0\n\n9.0\n\n10.0\nFREQUENCY.\n\nFigure 16.\n\n11,0\n\n12.0\n\n19.0\n\nGHs\n\nQuarter-Wave Stop-Band Filter Insertion Loss\nvs. Frequency.\n\n- 48 -\n\n3.\n3.1\n\nMIXER DESIGN\n\nGENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIn a previous systems analysis (1) carried out at\nWashington University, Justification for the overall design\nof the frontend was given.\n\nIt will be highlighted here\n\nalong with a description of the final hardware implementation.\n. One of the significant features of the design is the\nfact that the mixer is single ended (single diode).\n\nThis\n\nconfiguration was chosen because the modulation scheme for\nthe proposed transmit-receiver system is wideband FM.\nTherefore, no benefits accrue due to LO AM noise suppression afforded by a balanced circuit.\n\nSince wide bandwidth\n\ncan be achieved with single-ended mixers (see Reference 1*1)\nsimplicity of design and cost-effectiveness also suggest\nthis approach.\nAnother feature of the design is the use of field\nreplaceable diodes.\n\nIt is felt that this type of receiver\n\nwould experience less down-time due to diode burnout,\nsince a packaged diode could easily be replaced without\ntrained personnel and expensive equipment. This is in\nsharp contrast to the replacement of beam lead or chip\ndiodes.\n\nIt is felt also that it is cheaper for a head end\n\noperator to stock spare diodes than an entire front end.\nFinally, the use of packaged diodes precludes the need for\nhermetic sealing of the entire front end assembly.\n\nThe schematic diagram of the front end is shown in\nFigure 17. The signal and local oscillator frequencies\nare introduced to the mixer through waveguide inputs.\n\nThe\n\nsignal input was chosen to be waveguide so as to be compatible with either a receive: antenna or a waveguide amplifier, should one be found necessary to reduce the overall\nsystem noise figure.\n\nThe. waveguide prevents IP leakage from\n\nthe signal port by virtue of its inherent highpass properties.\n\nThe local oscillator port is also waveguide since\n\nthis choice allows the use of a high Q imbedding network\nfor a Gunn effect diode necessary for stable, low noise\noutput\n_\n\n(8).\n\n_ Microstrip. was chosen as the-medium in-which to fabri-\n\ncate the diplexer and associated filters.\n\nThis choice\n\nallows package size reduction as well as volume cost reduction after the circuit has been finalized.\nIt was decided that the mixer crystal would be operated\nwithout an external DC bias.\n\nAs is the case with other\n\nmixers reported in the literature (14,15) a self-biased\ndiode was chosen since increased LO drive levels to achieve\nlow conversion loss seemed more desirable than an additional\nDC power supply. More accurately, the crystal was operated\nat DC ground by providing a DC return from the signal path\nto the down-converter housing.\n\nIt is not expected that a\n\nvariable DC bias would have resulted in an improved noise\nfigure since although the crystal IF impedance can be lowered\n\n-SO-\n\nJ\n\ni\nu.\n\n0 U.\n\no oc\nCO\nCO\n\n2S\n\nT)\n0)\n\n15\n\nt.\n\n(U\n\n-I U.\n\nCO\nC\nO\nO\nCO\n\nCO\n\nUJ\n\na:\n3\n\np\n\n~1r\n\n1\n\n8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nO\n\n\xe2\x84\xa2* i\n\nCD\nX\n\n\xc2\xa7 w\nCO ^\n\nw\no:\n\nCM\nO\n\nD1PLEXER\n\nO\n\ni\n\nTERMINATION\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 v^\nd^*\nJ\n\nV-\n\nI\n1\n\n<\n\nH\n\nsll\nCO ~*\n\n^\n\ns:\no\nCO\n\n- 51 -\n\nby providing a better match, the noise ratio Increases\nwith DC bias.\nOne of the first stages in the development of the\nfrontend was the design of a 50ft coaxial crystal mount to\nbe used with both point contact and Schottky Barrier Diodes\nin standard ceramic cartridge packages.\n\nThe low frequency\n\n(30MHz) IP was extracted through a BNC bulkhead mount.\nDC ground was achieved with a fine wire leading from the\ncenter conductor to the outer conductor.\n\nRP bypassing was\n\naccomplished by using 0.005in mylar tape on a washer In\npressure contact with one terminal of the diode.\n\nThis\n\nproved to be inadequate since changes in the pressure\naffected both the input match and its ability to bypass the\nRF.\n\nIt was found that with additional microwave impedance\n\nmatching (tuning, screws) a 2:1 VSWR could be obtained\nover the band lO.^IGHz to 12.4GHz.\nThe final down-converter housing is pictured in\nFigure 18.\n\nThe overall dimensions are 4 3/4 In x 3 5/8 In x\n\n1 1/2 in. Waveguide inputs were fabricated by milling "U"\nshaped troughs in the aluminum block and then bolting cover\nplates over these slots.\n\nRectangular waveguide to coaxial-\n\nwaveguide to mlcrpstrip transitions were fabricated, using\n0,050In brass brazing stock as the center conductor.\n\nThe\n\nend protruding into the waveguide uses a "doorknob" structure as an antenna.\n\nThe center section has a teflon\n\nsheath for mechanical reasons and to provide -a 50ft coaxial\n\nMICROSTRIP FILTER\nNETWORK\n\nWAVEGUIDE LO INPUT\n\nCOAX CRYSTAL\nCAVITY\nWAVEGUIDE\nSIGNAL\nINPUT\n\nI GHz IF OUTPUT\n\nFigure 18.

Finally, the center conductor tapers to a "halffound" to provide a transition to microstrip.\n\nThe tran-\n\nsitions exhibited a return loss of better than I8db\n(VSWR \xc2\xbb 1.3) over the band ll.3GHz to 12.4GHz. The insertion\nloss of each transition is approximately 0.25db.\nThe 50Q coaxial mount for the mixer diode was modified\nin the final package.\n\nThe end of the cavity is a metal plug\n\nthat provides both an RP short and part of the path necessary to provide a DC short to the diode. The rest of the\nDC return path is traced through the microstrip circuit to\nthe housing.\n\nThe IP is reflected from the RP short and\n\ntaken from the mixer through a lowpass filter fabricated\non the microstrip board.\nThe down-converter was designed to operate with several\ntypes of mixer crystals.\n\nFor developmental purposes a\n\ncartridge type silicon point contact diode, Microwave\nAssociates IN23E was chosen*\n\nIts advertised performance in\n\nthe high x-band is: Maximum Noise Figure, 7.5db; Maximum\nConversion Loss, 5.0db; Maximum VSWR, 1.3:1.\nA relatively low cost silicon Schottky Barrier mixer\ndiode was also used.\n\nThe ceramic cartridge type was tne\n\nMA-JJOOT\'IE with manufacturer\'s specs given as: Maximum\nNoise Figure, 7.5db; Conversion Loss, 6.0db; Maximum VSWR,\n1.5:1. Finally, the coaxial cavity was modified to accomodate a GaAs Schottky Barrier Diode.\n\nSpecifications for\n\nthe Mitsubishi pill-prong diode were not available with the\n\nexception of the Noise Ratio which was assumed to be unity.\nThis is reasonable for the given device (.see Reference 15).\nThe i-v characteristic for the Mitsubishi dipde is given in\nFigure 19. From the part of the characteristic curve pictured in Figure 19, the diode appears to have an ideal\nexponential .trace. To reduce the risk of diode burnout,\nthe forward current was kept minimal.\n\nHowever, if the\n\nforward current is increased further, the diode conductance\nreaches a maximum level equal to the inverse of the spreadIng resistance (17).\n\nThis, in turn, limits optimum con-\n\nversion loss vs. LO drive as can be seen in Figure 23.\nPerformance of the mixer with the crystals given above is\ngiven in Chapter 4.\n\n- 55 -\n\nFORWARD UNITS:\nREVERSE UNITS:\n\nFigure 19.\n\n0.2 v/cm , 0.2 ma/cm\n5 v/cm , 0.2 ma/cm\n\nI-V Characteristic for Mitsubishi GaAs Schottky\nBarrier Diode.\n\n- 56 3.2\n\nMICROSTRIP CIRCUIT CONFIGURATIONS\n\nIn Section 3.1, an attempt was made to Justify the .\nchoices made in.the general design of the mixer.\n\nIn this\n\nsection, two specific microstrip transmission line circuits\nwill be examined.\n\nThe first is the one that we wanted to\n\nuse and the second the one actually incorporated in the\nfinal down-converter.\nThe circuit originally considered is shown in Figure\n17t\n\nThe travelings-wave directional filter discussed in\n\nSection 2.4 presents itself as a very good choice for\ndiplexing the the signal and local oscillator frequencies.\nThe use of this filter as a diplexer has been mentioned\nin the literature previously (14). It is limited, however,\nto mixers with very high IP\'s on the order of IGHz. The\nresonant ring is designed to be one wavelength at the LO\nfrequency.\n\nThis allows the LO to pass across the ring and\n\nonto the signal transmission line.with minimal loss.\n\nAlso,\n\nthe signal frequency passes the resonant ring with.minimum ...\nattenuation if it is of sufficiently higher or lower frequency.\n\nA IGHz IF presents such a choice.\n\nThe character-\n\nistics\n\nof this device, both experimental and predicted,\n\nare given in Section 2.4.\nThe diode and its mount are described in Section 3.1.\nAfter the signal and local oscillator are introduced to\nthe diode, the IF is reflected from the coaxial short.\nThe lowpass filter is located at a point of minimum insertion\n\n- 57 loss with the aid of an IP bypass network that insures\nminimal loss for the signal path.\nFinally, consider the image and sum frequency enhancement filters. These filters allow energy that would normally\nbe lost to be reflected back into the diodes to be remixed\nto the intermediate frequency and extracted through the\nlowpass filter at the IF port.\n\nThe various IP components\n\nare:\nS * WLO\n\nW\n\n0)\n\nLO~\n\n~\n2lTf%\n\nu>s\n\ns\xc2\xbb\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCD\n^E\n\n=\n\nW\n\nIF\n\n2a)\n\n(3.1)\n\nLOJ\n\nsi\n\nsnal radian frequency\n\nlocal oscillator frequency \xe2\x80\xa2\n=\n\n2u>Lo ~ ^s\na\n\nintermediate frequency\n\n^LO\n\n+ W\n\nS\n\n3\n\nimage frequency\nsum\n\nOne of the basic questions involved in the use of\nrejection or enhancement filters is their placement with\nrespect to the diode.\n\nThis has been accomplished in the\n\npast (29) by experimentally varying the position of filters\nand noting the optimum performance, either conversion loss\nor noise figure.\n\nThe other basic question in designing a\n\nmixer is to decide to reflect the image and sum frequencies\nwith an open or short circuit.\n\nAlthough an open-circuited\n\nimage results in a minimum noise figure, a short-circuited\nimage results in a lower IF matching resistance (29). This\n\n- 58 -\n\nlower IP resistance reduces the need for narrow band matching\ncircuits.\n\nTherefore, a wideband mixer can best be achieved\n\nwith a short-circuited image (29).\nIt was decided, however, that the above circuit would\nnot result in the best overall performance for the downconverter for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, referring to\n\nFigure 11, the minimum insertion loss for the signal through\nthe traveling-wave directional filter is seen to be around\n2db.\n\nThis is not acceptable since any loss in advance of\n\nthe mixer adds directly into the overall noise figure.\nThus, 2db of loss at this point would make a low loss device\nimpossible.\n\nSecondly, referring to Figure 16, it can be\n\n-seen- that- the- insert.lon_lo.s.s._o.f_a._rej_e_c_ti_o.n_filter joff jthe\ndesign frequency is about 2db. A loss of this magnitude\ncannot be tolerated since enhancement techniques can at\nbest Improve the overall noise figure by less than one db\nThe circuit actually used is shown schematically in ~~~~\nFigure 20 and a picture of the actual microstrip mask isshown in Figure 21.\n\nThe reason for using a directional\n\ncoupler to multiplex the signal and LO in place\'of the\ntraveling wave directional filter is because of the lower\ninsertion loss presented to the signal frequencies.. The\nport designated AFC output was not so used in this experiment.\n\nIts purpose is to provide a sample of the LO if\n\nAutomatic Frequency Control must be implemented.

The circuit used for this measurement is\nshown schematically in Figure 22.\nThe measurement procedure consisted of first establishing a reference level of -SOdbm on a Tektronix\nSpectrum Analyzer at one GHz. After establishing the local\noscillator at a" g~iven~ power, ~a signal of known power is\nintroduced to the signal arm of the circuit and the\nattenuators are adjusted until the signal registers -80dbm\non the spectrum analyzer.\n\nSince the incident signal power\n\ncan be calculated immediately from the attenuation\nsettings,and the IF power is -80dbm, the conversion loss\nIs known.\nAs the LO power is varied the conversion loss changes.\nThe experimental dependence of conversion loss on local\noscillator power is shown in Figure 23.\n\nNotice that optimum\n\nperformance occurs at different drive levels for each of the\ntwo diodes reported here.\nsuch as tuning\n\nAll additional narrowband tuning,\n\nscrews for the coax diode cavity and gold\n\nepoxy stubs on the MIC were optimized for best performance\n\n- 63 -\n\nu.\nK\nMi\n\nJO\nTl\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nto\n\n5\n\n2\n\n"*\n\n*t\n\na.\n\nflj\n\n*\n9\nO\n\n<u\nr.\no\n\n--\n\n^\n*""\n\ne\n\nJ\n\n1\n"^\n\nto\n\nIJ\n\n^\n\nX\n\n-H\n\n_\n\n""^\n- _A\nJ\n\xe2\x80\xa2 i\nh\nXJ\n\n0\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xb0\n\ntr\n\nCO\n\n\xc2\xab^X A*~\n\n\\^\nN\n\n0\n\nJu\njs.\no\n\n^i\n\nK\n\n\xc2\xab\nJ\n\n<\nj\no\n2\n\nO\n\no\n\n\xc2\xab\n\no\n\n^\n\no V\n\n1\n\n<^-\n\nIO \xc2\xab\xc2\xbb^/>\n\n*\n\ns-^\n\n\xc2\xab ...\n\xc2\xab\n\xe2\x82\xac\n**\n\n1\nw\no\n\n^v\n\ns\n\nfc\n\n<\n\ni\n\n-J\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nr^, S\n5 .

Its performance was modeled on the\nwell known scattering matrix for the directional coupler\nmodified to include external port mismatch.\n\nGood correlation\n\nbetween experiment and predicted results were obtained for\nthe two coupled ports but the isolated port response was\n\n- 69 Inaccurate.\n\nThis might be improved if the reflection coef-\n\nficient were taken as complex rather than simple magnitudes\nas now incorporated In the analysis.\nLow-pass filters consisting of alternating high and\nlow impedance microstrio sections were fabricated.\n\nAn\n\nanalysis based on lossless, dispersionless cascaded transmission line sections was formulated.\nexperiment resulted.\n\nGood agreement with\n\nThe filters designed and tested\n\ncomprised an even number of elements.\n\nTo avoid the required\n\nimpedance transformation, filters with an odd number of\nelements should be used.\n\nThis prevents a spurious\n\npassband between the second and third harmonic of the cutoff\n.frequency.\nFinally, a band-stop filter was fabricated in microstrip.\n\nThis element was examined to serve as an image\n\nenhancement filter.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, enhancement\n\ntechniques were not used on this prototype due to an insertion loss to the signal frequency of 1.5db and a higher\nthan anticipated conversion loss and resulting noise figure.\nOne of the principal features of the mixer itself is\nthe fact that it is single-ended.\n\nThis configuration was\n\nchosen because it is well suited to wideband FM transmission\nas well as bejng cost-effective (one diode instead of two\nor four) and amenable to a design simpler than that for a\nbalanced configuration.\n\nThe use of waveguide inputs for\n\nthe signal and LO prevents IF leakage from these ports *\n\n- 70 -\n\nOne major change should be made in the layout of the microstrip circuit.\n\nDue to mechanical restrictions, the signal\n\nport is located over one inch from the diode. The mechanical layout should be such that the signal port is as close\nas possible to the diode so as to decrease microstrip\ndissipation.\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1, it was decided to use\nfield replaceable diodes, either cartridge or pill-prong\npackage.\n\nThe reasons for this choice are given in that\n\nsection.\n\nReasonable performance was achieved with a\n\nMitsubishi GaAs Schottky Barrier Diode in a pill-prong\npackage.\n\nComplete performance results for the mixer and\n\nindividual components-are--summarized in Table 2-\n\nA .cost-\n\nestimate for the Washington University down-converter can\nbe found in Table 3.\n5.2\n\nFUTURE WORK\n\nA number of areas concerned with this work could be\npursued further to advantage.\n(1) The foremost area in need of improvement is the microstrip fabrication technique used in this project (See\nAppendix 7.3).\n\nInsufficient cleanliness was found to be\n\nthe major obstacle.\n\nThis led to poor photoresist and\n\netching, resulting in pinholing and other flaws.\n\nAlso, it\n\nwas also found that the contact prints used in the mask\nproduction and the etching techniques were not preserving\n\n- 71 -\n\nTable 2.\n\nDesign Specifications and Performance\nof 12GHz Down-Converter.\n\nCenter Frequency\n\n11.79\n\nBandwidth\n\n\'\n\nLO Frequency\n\n10.95\n\nIF Frequency\n\n84 0\n\nConversion Loss\nNoise Figure\n(assuming NR\n\n275\n\nGHz\nMHz\nGHz\nMHz\n\ndo\n\n9.4\n=\n\n9.4\n\ndb\n\n1.0)\n\nSignal/LO Input\nIF/AFC Output\n\nX-Band Waveguide\nOSM\n\nLO to SIGNAL Isolation\n\n> 11\n\nSignal t o I F Isolation"\n\nV 2 0 d b\n\nLO to IF Isolation\n\n> 28\n\ndb\n\nCoupler Directionality\n\n9\n\ndb\n\nSignal to Diode Insertion\nLoss\n\n1.9\n\ndb\n\nSignal Port VSWR\n\n< 2.3:1\n\ndb\n~\n\n- 72 -\n\nTable 3.\n\nCost Estimate for Down-Converter\n\nPrice per Unit in Quantities of; 1,000 :\nBill of Materials:\nCast Housing\n\n$ 30.00\n\nWaveguide-Coax-Mi C Transit ions(2)\n\n10.00\n\nDiode Holder\n\n10.00\n\nOSM Connectors (2)\n\n9.00\n\nGaAs Schottky Barrier Diode\n\n11.00\n\nMetalized .Ceramic Board\n\n3.^5\n\nMiscellaneous Hardware\n\n100\n\nLabor;\nPrecision Finish Machining\nof Casting\n\nMIC Processing\n\n~\n\nRF Assembly and Test\n\n$ 25.00\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n5.00\n10^00\n$40.00\n\nTOTAL.\nESTIMATED SELLING PRICE\n\n$11 4. \'4 5\n$100.00\n\n- 73 -\n\nline widths.\n\nIn sum, the microstrip fabrication technique\n\nneeds to be brought under control before circuits with\nexacting tolerances can be realized.\n(2) Further work with the traveling-wave directional\nfilter could be pursued in both the analysis and fabrication of a 1.5GHz device.\n\nA successful analysis would\n\neliminate the need for numerous experimental iterations\non a filter that could be used as the basis of a branching\nnetwork for the satellite-CATV interconnection system.\n(3) The performance obtained with a packaged diode should\nbe adequate when preceded with an RP preamplifier.\n\nHow-\n\never, if such an amplifier is not to be used, then a further\neffort" should\'"be" pursued using chip or beam-lead diodes.\nThis should result in a low-noise, broadband down-converter\nsince package parasitics necessitate tuning that narrowbands\nthe response and makes it difficult to achieve a low VSWR\nto the diode.\n\nUnpackaged diodes, in general, seem more\n\ncompatible with the microstrip transmission medium as\nreported in the literature (see Table 1).\n\n\xc2\xa7JL\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe author wishes to thank the Center for Development\nTechnology which supported this work through NASA Grant\nY/NGL-26-008-054.\n\n-. 75 -\n\n7.\n\nAPPENDICES,\n\n- 76 -\n\nAPPENDIX 7.1\nConversion Loss\n\nReferring to Figure 7.1.1, it can be seen that the\nmagnitude of the IF component is a function of the ratio of\nthe slopes of the DC i-v diode characteristic at the negative and positive peaks of the LO voltage.\n\nThe ratio of\n\nthe differential impedances decreases as the LO drive level\nis reduced.\n\nTherefore, at moderate drive levels, conversion\n\nloss, defined as the ratio of the output power at the IF\nto that of the input power at the signal frequency, is\ninversely proportional to the drive level (30).\nAlthough mixing itself is a function of the nonlihearity\nof the crystal, a linear relation exists between RF input\npower and IF output power if the LO level is held constant\nand is orders of magnitude larger than the input signal power.\nThis relationship holds because the voltage-current relationships responsible for conversion are functions of the\ndifferentials of the DC characteristics.\nAssume that the performance of a mixer can be adequately\npredicted by modeling the device as a three-port, namely\nthe signal, image and IF ports (30). For a four-port\nanalysis, including the sum components, see Reference 31.\nGiven the symmetry argument of Torrey and Whitnjer (31),\nthe voltage current equations for the three port mixer can\nbe specified as follows:\n\n- 77 -\n\nr\n\nIF AMPLITUDE\n\nf\n- SIGNAL\nAMPLITUDE\n\ni\n\nFigure 7.1.1.\n\nLO AMPLITUDE\n\nMagnitude of the IP Component.\n\n- 78 -\n\n(7.1.1)\n\nwhere a, 8, and y refer to signal, IF and image components\nrespectively.\nIt should be noted that the reduction of the above\nsystem of equations is based on several qualifying assumptions:\n(1) Torrey and Whitmer\'s analysis relies on the fact that\nthe mixer cannot distinguish between the image and the\n\n, signal.\n\nThis does not hold for a high IF since the\n\nmatch would vary widely over a 2\xc2\xab(IF) bandwidth,\n(2) The theory also presupposes that the IF and DC components cannot be distinguished, again, obviously untrue\nfor a high IF.\n(3) It is also assumed that the IF self-admittance.\nV\n\nB6 * Re y BB\xc2\xbb ls rea1\'\nIf the image terminals are connected, independently\nof the signal terminals, to an external admittance yY,\nthen\n\ni\n\n-*\nG\n\na\n\n-yv\n\n(7.1.2)\n\nY\n\nSubstituting this equation into Equation (7.1.1) and eliminating 6y and iy between the equations yields the following results for the signal and IF voltage-current relations:\n\n- 79 -\n\n+ Y\n\na3eB\n\ny\n\na\n\ny*\n\nY\n\nSaea\n\nwhere\n(7 i tr N\n^7.1.5)\n\n(*Y\n- \xe2\x80\x94 c*Y\n\ntl.7)\n\nv 8a\'"aB\n\' vy\n^Y\nota\nEquations (7,1.5) through (7,1.8) show the dependence of\n\nthe -signal and -IF -parameters on- the image termination. ....

There is, however,\na quality factor used to characterize not only a downconverter, but also other devices, which includes the effect\nof conversion loss. This is the noise figure or, equivalently, the noise temperature.\n\nBefore looking at noise\n\nfigure itself, consider the origin of noise.\nThe random nature of electronic motion in a conductor\nresulting from thermal agitation gives rise to an opencircuit, -Gaussian-distributed, voltage .known as Thermal or\nJohnson Noise.\n\nThe frequency components of the noise are\n\ndistributed throughout the spectrum and thus it is referred\nto as white noise.\nThe discrete and random nature of the electrons arriy^\ning at the metal in a Schottky barrier leads to what is commonly known as shot noise. Since the mean free path of the\nelectron is larger than the barrier width, collision and\nspace charge within the barrier can be overlooked.\n\nTorrey\n\nand Whitmer have shown that the mean square noise current\ndue to DC excitation is given by (31):\ni2\nwhere:\n\n= 2 e I Af\n\n(7.2.1)\n\n- 88 e\n\n=\n\nelectronic charge.\n\nI\n\n= diode current\n\n=\n\n1-^ + I2 = electron current from\n\nsemiconductor \xe2\x80\xa2* metal and metal -*\xe2\x80\xa2 semiconductor.

Of course, any\nsuitably controlled light source would suffice.\nThe unexposed photographic plate is placed\nemulsion side up on a black matte surface.\nThe negative exposed plate is placed with the\npattern down on the unexposed plate,\n\nIntim-\n\nate contact is insured by placing a heavy glass\nplate 3/3 inches""thick ort" to\'p of the-two- photographic plates.\n20 seconds.\n\nOptimum exposure time is\n\nThe plate should then be developed\n\nas per Section 7.3.1.2.\n\nThe important thing\n\nto note about the contact print process is that\nit is difficult to preserve line widths.\n\nIn\n\nstrict tolerance work, it should be.avoided.\n7.3.2\n\nSample Preparation\nFor the work reported here, Electrotec #SFG-100-250\n\nalumina with chrome-gold plating microstrip boards were\nused.\n\nSome early work was done with vapor-deposition and\n\nplating on raw alumina samples.\n\nSince even some commercial\n\nsamples require further plating, that technique will be\nreported here.\n\n- 101 -\n\n7.3.2.1\n\nGold Plating\n\nMaterials:\n\nSel-Rex "Pura-Gold 125", TCE\n\n(Trichlorethylene),\n\n20% -H2S04, DI (deionlzed water).\nProcedure:\n\nThe sample should first be cleaned in TCE for\n30 seconds, followed by a DI rinse.\n\nThis is\n\nfollowed by a 30 second rinse in H2SOi,, a DI.\nrinse and immediate immersion in the plating\nsolution.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe proper potential should\n\nexist across the electrodes before immersion.\nFailure to do this will result in passivation\nof the surface leading to a poor quality plate.\nThe manufacturer recommends a current density\nof 3 amps/square foot.\n\nFor a one inch square\n\nplated on both sides, this results in a 41.6\nmA current.\n\nGold is deposited at the rate of\n\n1 mil/12.6 minutes.\n\nGood results were obtained\n\nwith the bath maintained at 58\xc2\xb0C.\n\nSince the\n\nionic concentration is being depleted, bias\nacross the electrodes must periodically be\nadjusted to maintain a constant current.\n\nAfter\n\nremoving from the bath, the sample is rinsed in\nDI.\n\n7.3.2.2\n\nPhotoresist\n\nMaterials:\n\nKodak Thin Film Resist (KTFR), Trichlorethylene\n(TCE), Isopropyl Alcohol, KTFR Developer and\nThinner, Millipore Filter Holder XX3001200\n\n- 102 -\n\nwith Prefilter AP2501000 and Filter NRWPD1300;\nPaasche Airbrush Model H.\n\nProcedure:\n\n(a) -The sample should first be cleaned by\nimmersing it in TCE and then ultrasonically\nagitating the sample for five minutes.\n\nThis\n\nis followed by two five-minute periods in\nisopropyl alcohol, using clean solvent each\ntime.\n(b) The sample is then baked in a clean oven\nat 105\xc2\xb0C for 15 minutes.\n(c) The photoresist is then prepared in the\nratio of two parts KTFR per one part KTFR\nThinner, This mixture is then dispensed through\n/\n--]\n\na~ Ml 11 Ipore "pre-fliter and filter-in the\n\n- -.. .\n\namount of one cc per square inch of substrate,\n(d) The substrate is then spun at 1800 RPM\nfor ^5 seconds.\n(e) The sample is then baked again at 105\xc2\xb0C for\n15 minutes.\n(f) The circuit is then exposed on the photoresist, using a UV source and an exposure time\nof 30 seconds.\n(g) The circuit is then developed using KTFR\ndeveloper and an airbrush.\n(h) As a final step the sample is heated rapidly\nto 160\xc2\xb0C and removed from the heat immediately.\n\n- 103 -\n\n7.3.2.3\n\nEtching\n\nMaterials:\n\nTransene Gold Etch, Transene Chrome Etch,\nBlack Wax and TCE solution, TCE, Xylene, DI.\n\nProcedure:\n\nThe ground plane Ms first coated with a solution\nof black wax and TCE. After drying, the sample\nis placed in a beaker filled with 25cc of\ngold etch/square inch of gold surface area.\nOptimum results were obtained using vigorous\nagitation for 30 minutes,\n\nThe sample is then\n\nrinsed in DI and placed in ten cc of chrome\netch/square inch of chrome surface area.\n\nThe\n)\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nchrome etch is then agitated for about two\nminutes.\n\nFinally, the sample is placed in TCE;\n\nto remove the black wax from the ground plane.\n7.3.2.4\n\nMounting\n\nMaterials:\n\nSuperior #30 Flux, Indium Indalloy #2 Solder,\nEpo-tek H*U Gold Epoxy.\n\nProcedure:\n\nThe mounting block and sample are heated to\n300\xc2\xb0F.\n\nThe flux is applied and a small amount\n\nof solder is applied evenly to the surface of\nthe mounting block.\n\nThe sample is then placed\n\non the block and pressed down firmly.\nmicrostrip connectors\n\nThe coax-\n\nare attached electronic-\n\nally using the gold epoxy.\n\n8.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nB.
