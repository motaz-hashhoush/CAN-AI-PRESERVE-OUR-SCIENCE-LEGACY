Weather information is based on data from Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) collected from antennas in Alabama and Tennessee. Bob Baron refines and enhances MSFC's real time display software. Computer data is changed to audio data for radio transmission, received by clients through an antenna and decoded by computer for display. Using his service, clients can monitor the approach of significant storms and schedule operations accordingly. Utilities and emergency management officials are able to plot a storm's path. A recent agreement with two other companies will promote continued development and marketing.", "title": "Storm Warning Service", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080930, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080930, "isbn": "0-16-042100-4", "id": "3efc95e0d53c4a39a3f7dfec6b53eb1d", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080930.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080930/downloads/20020080930.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080930/downloads/20020080930.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080930/downloads/20020080930.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
