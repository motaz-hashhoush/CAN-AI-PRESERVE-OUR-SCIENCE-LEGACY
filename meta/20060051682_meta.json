Toward utilizing the IP packet architecture, utilizing data link layer framing structures for multiplexed data on a channel are the targeted application considered for demonstration purposes. Specifically, we examine three common framing standards and present the sensing performance of these standards and their relative de-correlation metrics. Some analysis is performed to investigate the impact of lossy links. Finally, we present results on a demonstration platform that integrated reconfigurable sensing technology into the Ground Station Interface Device (GRID) for End-to-End IP demonstrations in space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060051682, "endDate": "2006-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Earth Science Technology Conference, College Park, Maryland, June 27-29, 2006", "location": "College Park, MD", "id": "ca35a1ceea50459790e25ff4c648f5e9", "startDate": "2006-06-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060051682, "id": "16751c52989e492f8bf46b7f4b951c5e", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
