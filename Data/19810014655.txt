The rollerdrive,with a I0.8:1reductionratio,was\nsuccessfullyrun atup to 70 000 rpm inputspeed and up to 14.9 kW (20hp)inputpower\nlevel. Three drive assemblies were testedfor a totalof aboutthree hours ofwhich\napproximatelyone hour was atnominal full\nspeed and fullpower conditions.Peak\nefficiency 60 percentwas determined. There was no evidence ofslippagebetween\nof\nrollersfor any ofthe conditions\ntested. The balldrive, a versionusing ballsinstead\nof one row ofrollers,and having a 3.25:1reductionratio,failed perform\nto\nsatisfactorily.\n\nINTR ODUC TION\nAdvanced high chamber pressure hydrogen-oxygen rocket engines requireefficient,\nhigh-speed, high-pressurepropellantturbopumps. These high-speedpumps require a\nmoderately highinletpressure for operation. Low-speed boostpumps are generally\nused to supplythe required inlet\npressure to the high-speed main turbopumps to keep the\npropellanttankpressure and weightto a minimum.\n\nThe boostpumps may be drivenby\n\ngas or hydraulicturbines,butthese require complex valvingand speed controlsystems.\nAnother optionis to drivethe boostpumps through a mechanical speed reductiondrive\ndirectly\ncoupledto the main turbopumps. This speed reductiondrivemust operate\ncompletelysubmerged in the cryogenicfluid\nwhich provides cooling,but no lubrication.\nGear reductiondrives have been successfullyoperatedin cryogenicfluids,but are\nquestionable\nfor the expected 10-hour liferequirement at the very high turbopump\nspeeds of futurerocket engines (refs.I and 2). The Nasvytis Multiroller\nTraction\nDrive (ref. 3) has the potential\nto attain the required\nlife.\nThe traction\ndrive uses\nsmooth\n\nrollers\n\nto transmit\n\npower\n\nand thus the life problems\n\nassociated\n\nwith sliding\n\ncon-\n\ntact in gear teeth are eliminated.\nThe planetary\ntraction\ndrive has proved to be reliable\nand efficient in commercial\napplications\n(ref. 4), but there has been no attempt to adapt\nthe drive\n\nto cryogenic\n\napplications.\n\nThe objective\nof the work described\nwas to evaluate the potential\nof the traction\ndrives for the above cryogenic\napplication.\nTests were run on a Nasvytis\nMultiroller\nDrive having a I0.8:1 ratio,\nand a variation\nof the Nasvytis drive,\nthe ball drive, with\na 3.25:1ratio. Tests were run in liquidoxygen, includingsteady stateand transient\ntests, atshaft speeds up to 70 000 rpm and inputpowers up to 14.9 kW (20hp).\n\nE-730\n\nA/Y/- gJ/ff-\n\nAPPARATUS\nTest\nTwo types\na speed\n\nof traction\n\nand power\n\ndrives\n\nrange\n\nwere\n\nrequired\n\nDrives\n\ntested\n\nin this study.\n\nfor driving\n\nliquid\n\npumps required\nfor an 88 964 N (20 000 lbf) thrust\nthese drives are shown in table I.\n\nThe drives\n\noxygen and liquid\nrocket\n\nengine.\n\nwere\n\ndesigned\n\nhydrogen\n\nfor\n\nboost\n\nThe design\n\ndata for\n\nThe Nasvytis\nMultiroller\nDrive,\ndesigned for the LOX boost pump at a speed ratio\nof 10.8:1,\nis shown in figures\n1, 2, and 3.

The coolant pressure\nwas maintained at 4.5\xc3\x97105 N/m 2 (65 psi) to suppress cryogenic coolant boiling within\nthe drive.\nA radial flow turbine driven by nitrogen gas provided input power to the drives.\nSpeed control was accomplished with a control valve in the turbine gas supply line. An\neddy current proximity probe monitored the passage of the turbine blades and provided\na shaft speed signal. A closed loop controller maintained shaft speed constant.\nThe output power was absorbed with a radial flow turbine driven by nitrogen gas and\noperating in reverse.\nThe power absorbed by the brake and thus the power transmitted\nthrough the drive was varied by means of a control valve in the brake turbine gas supply\nline. The passage of the brake turbine blades was monitored by a proximity probe to\nindicate brake speed.\nSimple shaft seals were provided to isolate the liquid oxygen coolant from the nitrogen drive gas for the turbine and the brake. The seals consisted of a nitrogen purged\ncavity between the oxygen and the turbine drive gas. Pressure in this cavity was\nmaintained slightly higher than the coolant pressure.\nTurbine and Brake Calibration Rig\nThe performance of the turbine and the brake was characterized using a separate\ncalibration fixture. In this fixture the turbine and brake were mounted on separate\nshafts, each supported by ball bearings.\nThese two shafts were then connected by a\nsplined guill shaft containing a calibrated torque transducer.\nThe torque signal was\nbrought out through high-speed slip rings to the signal conditioning equipment. Data\n3\n\nwere gathered by operating the calibration rig at a constant speed and varying the\napplied torque. Turbine inlet pressure, outlet pressure, brake inlet pressure and\noutlet pressure, shaft speed and torque were measured at shaft speeds up to 40 000 rpm.\nInadequate bearing lubrication and cooling prevented operation at higher shaft speeds.\nOperation of the rig without the brake wheel attached allowed the measurement of the\ntest fixture bearing losses.\nThe data gathered related the turbine torque as a function\nof turbine inlet pressure and also the brake torque as a function of brake inlet pressure.\nThis data allowed the calculation of input power and output power during the testing of\nthe multiroller drives. Although data were gathered at up to 40 000 rpm the results\nwere extrapolated to 70 000 rpm. The error in this extrapolation is estimated to be\n5 percent or less.\n\nPROCEDURE\nPrior to each test, the drives were completely disassembled\nand the parts were\ncleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner to assure compatibility with liquid oxygen. After\nreassembly,\nthe drives were installed in the test fixture and the fixture was mounted\nin the facility.\nLiquid oxygen was slowly flowed through the drive for approximately one-half hour\nto pre-cool all parts to liquid oxygen temperature.\nOnce the desired temperature was\nreached, the turbine was driven up to the desired speed following a linear speed ramp.\nThe final speed and the ramp rate were adjustable. Ramp rates of 30 minutes to\n5 seconds to full speed were run.\nload up the\n\ndrive.\n\nData\n\nwas\n\noff and the drive decelerated\n\nOnce at speed,\n\nrecorded\n\nat several\n\nthe brake turbine flow was applied to\npower\n\nlevels\n\nbefore\n\nthe brake\n\nwas\n\nshut\n\nslowly to zero speed.\n\nFor any turbine inlet pressure and turbine speed the turbine torque, and thus the\ndrive input torque, could be found from the turbine calibration data. The product of\nturbine torque and turbine speed yielded the drive input power. Similar calculations,\nbased upon the brake inlet pressure and brake speed, yielded the output power of the\ndrives.\nThe ratio of the drive output power to the input power is the drive efficiency.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nCheck-Out Tests\nThe roller and ball drives were tested in oil mist, liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen.\nThe oil mist and liquid nitrogen tests were run to check out the drives for proper\nassembly and mechanical operation in a less hazardous and more convenient fluid than\nliquid oxygen. No significant data were obtained during the checkout tests. Test\nspeeds of 70 000 rpm were attained, but all the testing was done at essentially no load.\n4\n\nRoller\nThe roller\nhours,\n\n_Irive tests\n\nTests\n\nliquid oxygen accumulated\n\nin\n\nof which about one hour was at the design\n\nobtained\n\nat speeds\n\nbetween\n\nI. 5 to 14.9 kW (2 to\nThree\n\nDrive\n\nsets\n\nof roller\n\nspeed\n\n20 000 and 70 000 rpm,\n\n20 hp).\ndrive\n\nThe drive\n\nhardware\n\nof about three\n\nof 70 000 rpm.\n\nData were\n\nwhile input power\n\nefficiency\n\nwere\n\na total test time\n\nranged\n\nfrom\n\nwas varied\n\nI0 percent\n\nused and each assembly\n\nfrom\n\nto 60 percent.\n\nwas tested\n\nto failure.\n\nIn each of the test series,\ndata were obtained by slowly ramping the drive speed up to\ndesign speed and varying the drive load from minimum\nto design torque at selected\nvalues of drive speed.\nIn the last test series,\nthe last two tests were cyclic tests in\nwhich the drive\n\nspeed\n\nwas accelerated\n\nto design\n\nspeed\n\nA summary\nof the data is presented\nin table II.\nThe first set of roller drive hardware\nsurvived\nation.\n\nThe failure\n\nthe low-speed\nliner\n\nwas attributed\n\nshaft\n\nwas pinned\n\nhousing,\n\nto the failure\n\nfigure\n\n12.\n\nin place in subsequent\n\nshown in figures\n\n13 and 5.\n\nThe first\n\nfour tests\nwas a shrink\n\nassemblies.\n\nand in 5 seconds.\n\nfor 72 minutes\n\nof the AISI 440C liner\n\nThe liner\n\nand second\n\nin 10 seconds\n\nto remain\n\nfit for this test.\n\nThe sun and planet\nrow planets\n\ntotal\n\nrollers\n\nshown in figure\n\ngood condition after the test.\nThe sun rollers\nin figure 13 show the effects\ninadequate local cooling although no sign of excessive\nheating was detected\n\ndurseated\n\nin\n\nThe\nare\n\n5 were\n\nin\n\nof possible\nin the cool-\n\nant temperature rise data.\nThe second set ofhardware shown in figures14, 15, 16, and 17 failedafter42 minutes inthree tests. Post testinspection\nrevealed evidence of a fireon the high-speed\nshaftand failedhigh-speedshaftbearing (fig_\n14). No conclusionwas reached whether\nthe fireor bearing failureoccurred first.The firstand second row rollers(figs.15\nand 16)were in faircondition\nwhile the sun rollers(fig.17)showed considerable\ndistress.\nThe thirdset of hardware accumulated 43 minutes in six testsbeforefailing.The\nlasttwo testsofthisserieswere cyclictestsinwhich the drivewas rapidlyaccelerated\nto design speed. Seventeen cycleswere run at a ramp speed of 7000 rpm per second and\n15 cycles at 14 000 rpm per second. At the end of each speed ramp, theinputtorque was\nvariedfrom minimum to design value. At the end ofthe fifteenthycle and at an input\nc\ntorque of 2.26 N-m (20 in-lbf), the drive failed.\nThe output torque at failure was\n12.43 N-M (If0 in-lbf) for a drive efficiency\nof 50.9 percent.\nThe sun, first row\nplanets,\nsecond row planets and ring roller are shown in figures 18, 19, 20, and 21.\nThe sun roller\n(fig. 18) indicates\nhigh loading or insufficient\ncooling as in the previous\ntests\xc2\xb0\n\nThe planets\n\nof failure\nfailed\n\nappears\n\nbearings\n\nin the housing\n\n(figs.\n\n19 and 20) are shown to be in fair condition.\n\nto be due to\n\nare shown still\nin figure\n\n22.\n\nfailure\nmounted\n\nof the planet\non the planet\n\nbearings.\nshafts.\n\nThe inner\nThe outer\n\nThe actual\nraces\nraces\n\ncause\n\nof the\nare shown\n\nIn all of the roller drive tests the ratio between the input and output speeds was\nconstant.\nWithin the limits of the speed measurement\naccuracy no slippage could be\ndetected.\nThe results of the roller drive tests are shown in figure 23. The output\npower against the input power is shown with input shaft speed and percent design input\ntorque as parameters.\nThe roller drive power loss is significantly more dependent\nupon speed than upon torque.\nThis result is in agreement with the results of the tests\nreported in refence 5. The constant speed lines of 50 000 rpm and above have the same\nslope as the 100 percent efficiency or zero loss line; therefore,\nincreasing input torque\nat constant speeds results in a constant power loss and an increase in drive efficiency.\nAt lower speeds, the power loss is dependent upon both torque input and speed.\nBall Drive Tests\n\nThe ball drive tests in liquid oxygen were not successful. In most tests, the drive\nlocked up and failed to rotate. Post test inspections gave no indication of the cause of\nits failure to operate. After several reassemblies and repeated failures, the testing of\nthe ball drive was discontinued. It is possible that the drive is inherently unstable\nbecause of failure to maintain parallelism between four of the second row planet axes\nand the ring roller axis. Four of the eight second row planets were supported and kept\nin alignment with ball bearings while four of the planet rollers were permitted to\n"float" between the first row balls and the ring roller (fig. 8).\nCONCLUDINGREMARKS\nThe roller drive tests in liquid oxygen indicate that the Nasvytis drive can be\ndeveloped into a useful transmission for cryogenic applications. None of the three\nfailures which occurred could be attributed to failure of the rollers.\nThe sun roller did\nshow distress in all three tests, but this may be due to excessive roller loading. Because no slippage was observed, it may be possible to reduce the roller loading from\nthat used in these tests. In addition, it may be possible to improve the cooling of the\nsun rollers and, consequently, improve their life.\nThe efficiencies obtained were lower than those obtained in tests described in\nreference 5 probably because of windage losses due to operation submerged in liquid\noxygen. The tests in reference 5 were run using oil as a lubricant with the housing\nkept relatively dry with the use of a scavenger pump. In addition, the rollers sustained\nmechanical damage during the testing resulting in additional losses.\nA basic problem with the drives is that without perfect parallelism between the\ncenterlines of the second row rollers and the ring roller, an axial force is generated\nbetween the second row rollers and the ring. This misalignment is what caused the\n\nring roller insert to be forced from its proper location in the ring casing in the first\ntest series.\nThis form of instability may be relieved by application of the stability\ncriteria as described in reference 6. The failure of the ball drive was probably caused\nby the skewing of the floating second row planet rollers which were not maintained\nparallel to the ring roller.\nA design change in which all of second row rollers\nbearing supported would relieve most of this problem.\n\nwere\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nA Nasvytis\n\nMultiroller\n\nTraction\n\nDrive with a 10.8:1 ratio and a modification\n\nof the\n\nNasvytis Drive, the Ball Drive, with a 3.25:1 ratio were tested in liquid oxygen. Input speeds to 70 000 rpm _md input power levels to 14.9 kW (20 hp) were run with the\nfollowing results:\n1. Peak efficiency of 60 percent was determined.\n2. Three drives were tested for a total of 3 hours, of which 1 hour was at full speed\nand full power.\n3. The drive power losses at speeds above 40 000 rpm were significantly affected\nby speed and insensitive to variations in input torque.\n4. There was no evidence of slippage between rollers detected within the limits of\nthe speed measuring accuracy.\n5. The Ball Drive failed to rotate or "locked up" after a few revolutions in every\ntest.\nREFERENCES\nI. Zachary, A.

Abstract\n\nTwo versions\n\nof a Nasvytis\n\nMultiroller\n\nTraction\n\nDrive were tested\n\nfor possible\n\napplication\n\nas\n\ncryogenic boost pump speed reduction drives for advanced hydrogen-oxygen\nrocket engines.\nResults are presented\nfor a 10.8:1 speed ratio unit and a modified unit, the Ball Roller Drive,\nwith a 3.25:1 speed ratio.\nThe tests were run in liquid oxygen, including steady state and\ntransient operation at input speeds up to 70 000 rpm and input powers up to 14.9 kW (20 hp).\nMaximum\n\npower transmission\n\nefficiency\n\nwas 60 percent,\n\n17.
