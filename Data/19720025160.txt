Farquhar and Norman F. Ness\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nAugust 1972\n\n(To be Published in Astronautics & Aeronautics - October 1972)\n\nIntroduction\nApproximately 20 years ago, Biermann proposed that the direction\nand motion of the plasma tails of comets are due to momentum transfer\nfrom a continuously flowing stream of solar particles known as the solar\nwind.\n\nThis interpretation was based on the observations that such\n\ngas tails trailed behind the anti-solar direction by a measurable\namount, several degrees, and that detailed structures visible in the\ntail were observed to move in the anti-solar direction with relatively\nhigh velocity and with irregular accelerations.\n\nThus, the study of\n\nthe interaction of the solar wind with comets was begun and as such\nmust be reckoned e\n\nthe first quantitative prediction of the solar wind.\n\nSubsequently, ten years later direct in-situ observations of the\nmagnetized solar wind began with satellites carrying instruments into\ninterplanetary space.\n\nSince then, extensive experimental and theo-\n\nretical studies of the solar wind and its interaction with the earth,\nmoon and the planets have been conducted.\n\nThese results demonstrate\n\nthe significant energy input by the solar wind to the upper regions of\nplanetary atmospheres and/or its magnetosphere via both direct momentum\ntransfer and wave particle interactions.\n\nMore recently, after another\n\n10 year interval, dramatic observations of vast atmospheres of atomic\nhydrogen, measured in the resonance line of hydrogen alpha, were performed on Comets Tago-Sato-Kosaka (1969g) and Bennett (1969i).\n\nIn the\n\ncase of Comet Bennett, the scale size of the atmosphere exceeds 107 km\n\n2\n\nand confirmed the developing views that earlier production rates of\ncometary gases was underestimated by several orders of magnitude.\nThus our present view of the solar wind interaction with comets includes\nnot only the well known feature of ion tails but also a vast hydrogen\natmosphere which must interact strongly with the solar wind and thus\ncreate a much larger target for direct spacecraft investigations than\npreviously anticipated.\n\nIt is the purpose of this brief report to\n\nsuggest two specific early missions to the Comets Grigg-Skjellerup in\n1977 and Encke in 1980 as precursor missions to more ambitious missions\nto Encke rendezvous in 1984 and Halley intercept in 1986.\nMission Guidelines\nOne of the primary constraints guiding these studies has been the\ndesire to use existing spacecraft designs for four reasons.\n1.\n\nHigh confidence of success and demonstrated ability to support\n\nthe class of experiments conceived as appropriate for these missions,\n2.\n\nLow cost of implementation since no spacecraft design or\n\ndevelopment work would be required and hence financial feasibility is\nconsiderably higher than were the opposite true,\n3.\n\nFlight schedule should be administratively realistic from the\n\nviewpoint of mission definition, experiment selection, Congressional\napproval and instrumentation delivery and\n4.\n\nSpacecraft system should have a scientific heritage in which\n\nstudies of the solar wind, interplanetary dust and other particulate\n\n3\n\nmatter, and interactions of the solar wind with different objects was\na principal objective, to assure compatibility between experiments and\nspacecraft.\nFrom the scientific viewpoint the principal objectives were:\n1.\n\nPrecursor missions to determine in situ the gaseous composition,\n\nboth neutral and ionized, and the nature of the solar wind interaction\nwith the cometary gases,\n2.\n\nTarget comets should appear during the five year interval 1977\n\nto 1982, sufficiently in advance of Halley\'s 1986 apparition so that\nfeedback from results so obtained would be possible,\n3.\n\nSufficiently well-known trajectory so that launch could occur\n\nprior to recovery and not require extensive maneuvering by the spacecraft and lastly,\n4.\n\nThe flythrough velocity should be less than 15 km/sec in order\n\nto permit utilization of existing instrumentation.for the study of the\ncomposition and the interactions without significant distortion due to a\nhigher relative velocity.\nWith these guidelines, the existing stable of interplanetary\nspacecraft was surveyed and the comet appearances in the time interval\nsieved to determine a fortuitous conjunction of intrinsic spacecraft\ncapability with cometary apparition.\n\nThis search was fruitful in\n\nidentifying several such opportunities of which the two best missions\nare herein summarized:\n\nIt should be stressed here that the spacecraft\n\n4\n\nstructure, power system, telemetry system, configuration and launch\nvehicle which are considered for these two missions are not simply\npaper conceptions of what might be done.\nThe spacecraft IMP is a series of earth (and moon) orbiting\nspacecraft, which beginning in 1963 definitively studied the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind, the collisionless bow shock\nsurrounding the earth associated with the supersonic solar wind\ninteraction with the geomagnetic field and the existence of the geomagnetic tail.\n\nIt has already demonstrated its low cost in earlier\n\nmissions and as such is a spacecraft designed for operation at 1 AU\nsupporting accurate measurements of magnetic fields and low energy\nplasma and particle fluxes since great care is exercised in the design\nand fabrication of a magnetically RFI clean spacecraft.\n\nThe HELIOS\n\nspacecraft, considered for the 1980 Encke mission, is a solar probe\ndesigned to operate at 0.25 AU and also provide a magnetically and RFI\nclean laboratory bench from which detailed measurements of the solar\nwind and its composition can be studied.\n\nThe first HELIOS spacecraft\n\nwill be launched in 1974 and the second in 1975.\nMinimum modifications to these spacecraft are required for the\ncometary mission targets anticipated.\n\nOf course, important modifications\n\nwill be in the area of the experiment repertoire in which additional\nexperiments related to cometary studies will be added replacing other\nexperiments. Secondly, the high gain antenna utilized on HELIOS will\nalso be utilized on the IMP spacecraft in order to provide for adequate\n\ntelemetry transmission during its cometary intercept.\n\nDetailed studies\n\nhave been underway for some time to confirm and document the present\nstatus of these missions.\nMission Objectives\nAs earlier remarked, the primary objectives of these missions is\nto study the nature of the solar wind interaction with the comets, the\ncomposition of the gaseous cometary atmosphere and possibly the details\nof the aft body portion of cometary phenomena, the ion and dust tails.\nFinal targeting of .he spacecraft flythrough trajectory will be accomplished in conjunction with the experimenters finally selected for\nflight.\n\nHere we only state the overall scientific objectives and\n\nrepresentative experiments to be performed.\nFigure 1 illustrates the scale size of the interaction region\nbetween the solar wind and the comet.\n\nIt is expected that a collisionless\n\nshock wave will develop as the super Alfvenic solar wind interacts with\nthe cometary atmosphere.\n\nThis may be similar to the observed bow shock\n\nwhich surrounds the earth, Venus and Mars (most recently identified in\nthe USSR results from Mars 3).\n\nThe distance to this shock front is\n\nestimated to be 106 to 107 km.\nBehind the shock is expected a region of subsonic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence similar to that of the earth\'s magnetosheath.\n\nHere\n\nthermalized solar wind plasma is deviated around the comet along a\nsurface identified as an MHD discontinuity, a contact surface.\n\nOnly\n\n6\n\ndirect in-situ measurements will be able to establish the existence and\nthe positions of these surfaces, which are important to understand the\nfundamental nature of the interaction between the ionized gas of the\nsolar wind and the ionized or neutral gases of the cometary atmosphere.\nAn intercept trajectory with a spacecraft carrying instrumentation to\nmeasure magnetic fields, plasmas, neutral and ionized gases, and\nfluctuating magnetic and electric fields will definitively establish\nboth the nature and the position of the discontinuity surfaces and the\nseparate plasma-field regimes thus created.\nIn addition, as the spacecraft flythrough trajectory penetrates\nfurther towards the cometary nucleus, the study of emissions and\nparticulate matter inthe nucleus of comets becomes feasible.\n\nIn fact,\n\nit is necessary to consider the hazard of damage to the spacecraft and/\nor instruments from particulate matter in selecting a final impact\nparameter (the radius of closest approach to the nucleus) in order to\navoid damaging the spacecraft.\nstudying, one may\n\nDepending upon which comet one is\n\nthen also have an opportunity to perform measurements\n\nin the tailward region of the interaction region and possibly to\nestablish whether or not the stylized variations of cometary tail\nstructures are associated with an imbedded magnetic field entrapped from\nthe interplanetary medium, are related to waves along the contact\nsurface or finally structures imbedded within the multiple neutral\nsheets which may exist in the cometary tails analogous to the neutral\nsheet of the earth\'s magnetic tail.\n\n7\n\nAs knowledge of the solar wind interaction with the earth\'s magnetic\nfield has increased, we have come to appreciate more closely the parallel\nwhich may exist between the geomagnetic tail and cometary ion tails.\nHowever, only in-situ observations of ion tails will permit a determination\nof the completeness of such an analogy.\nFor the measurement of the composition of the ions and gases,\nvarious instruments to perform spectrometric studies are required.\n\nSome\n\nof these will be direct measurements of mass per unit charge or energy/\nunit charge while others will be of the indirect radiation types in\nwhich the emission characteristics of the ions and molecules will be\nutilized for observations unobscured by the earth\'s atmosphere and/or\nnight glow.\nMission Analysis\nThe search for interesting flythrough missions in the 1977 - 1982\ntime period quickly led to two outstanding targets, Grigg-Skjellerup\nin 1977 and Encke in 1980.\n\nBoth of these opportunities have certain\n\nadvantages that markedly distinguish them from previous proposals for\ncomet-intercept missions.\n\nThis distinction is due not only to the\n\nfavorable orbital geometry for these apparitions, but also to some\nunusual extended-mission possibilities associated with them.\n\nDescrip-\n\ntions of both the primary and extended phases of these missions are\ngiven below.\n\n8\n\n1977 Grigg- Skjellerup Mission:\n\nGrigg-Skjellerup is a typical short-\n\nperiod comet that was discovered in 1902 and next seen in 1922.\n\nIt\n\nhas been observed at every apparition since then (T - 5 years), the\nlast time in 1972 when it presented a sharp nucleus and a fan-shaped\ncoma.\n\nIt does not seem to possess a tail.\n\nThe orbit of Grigg-Skjellerup\n\nis depicted in Fig. 2 where it can be seen that the perihelion passage\nand the ecliptic crossing, which are almost coincident, will occur\nvery close to the earth in 1977 (at about 0.20 AU).\n\nDespite a large\n\nperturbation by Jupiter in 1964, its present orbit is well known as\nevidenced by the fact that its predicted perihelion date for the 1972\napparition was within 0.01 days of the observed time.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nthe nongravitational forces affecting the motion of this comet are\nextremely small, and are in fact an order of magnitude smaller than\nmany other short-period comets (e.g., D\'Arrest).\nPrevious studies of comet-intercept missions have stated that the\norbits of comets are not known well enough to consider a launch before\nthe comet is recovered and a better orbit is determined. While this\nmay be true in some cases, the indicated a priori orbital accuracy for\nGrigg-Skjellerup justifies a pre-recovery launch.\n\nIn any event, the\n\nchances for the earliest recovery yet recorded for Grigg-Skjellerup are\nquite good in 1977.\n\nIf it postulated that recovery will occur when\n\nthe comet attains a nuclear magnitude of 18, the recovery date would be\nabout December 1, 1976, which is more than four months before intercept.\n\n9\n\nThe nominal mission profile is summarized in Fig. 3.\n\nBecause of\n\nthe moderately high inclination of the comet\'s orbit (21.100), the\nplanned intercept point is located in the ecliptic plane.\n\nWith this\n\nspecification the launch energy requirement (C3 ) is quite low.\nfact, C3 < 3 km2/sec2 for a two-week launch window.\ncometary encounter are almost ideal.\n\nIn\n\nConditions at the\n\nThe relative velocity is only\n\n15.2 km/sec, and the angle between the relative velocity vector and\nthe spacecraft spin axis is 24.6 .\n\nThis angle, which is termed the\n\nrelative aspect, is an important parameter for considering those experiments measuring the composition of the cometary coma.\n\nThe small value\n\nof the relative aspect is rather fortuitous because antenna-pointing\nconstraints recuire that the spacecraft spin axis should be normal to\nthe ecliptic plane.\nAnother feature of the cometary encounter worthy of mention is\nthat the comet will be close to its maximum brightness, having a total\nmagnitude of 9.98.\n\nAt this time, dark-sky conditions for the sighting\n\nof Grigg-Skjellerup will exist for about two hours at a 35\xc2\xb0N latitude\nearth-observatory site and about five hours at a 35 S latitude site.\nThese conditions are adequate for obtaining good earth-based spectroscopic measurements at the encounter which should be useful in correlating\nthe spacecraft measurements.\n\n10\n\nIn Fig. 3A it can be seen that the spacecraft is placed into a\ntrajectory that not only intercepts the comet, but also returns to the\nearth.\n\nThe purpose of this extended-mission strategy is to carry out\n\nparticle and field investigations of previously unexplored regions of\nthe earth\'s magnetosphere, especially in the geomagnetic tail between\n80 and 500 earth radii.\n\nDue to the high degree of commonality of the\n\nscientific instrumentation for many of the cometary and magnetosphere\nexperiments, the earth-return extended mission mode is very attractive.\nAlthough there is only one trajectory that returns to the vicinity\nof the earth when the comet intercept date is fixed and transfers that\nare longer than one year are not allowed, it is possible to open the\nlaunch window to about two weeks by adding a modest velocity correction\n(< 150 mps) after the cometary encounter.\n\nWhen the spacecraft returns\n\nto earth, a small solid retro-motor is used to brake it into a highapogee earth orbit.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3B, the spacecraft eventually\n\nenters the geomagnetic tail and spends about four months in the area\nnear the sun-earth L2 libration point.\n\nAccording to the Gylden-Moulton\n\nhypothesis, the gegenschein may be caused by dust particles temporarily\ntrapped in this region.\n\nIn-situ analysis using the cometary solid\n\nparticle detectors could settle this issue.\nThe mission just described could be performed with a slightlymodified version of a current Explorer spacecraft (IMP-H/J).\n\nThe\n\nprincipal changes to this spacecraft, which is spin-stabilized, would be\n\n11\n\nthe addition of a hydrazine propulsion system and a high-gain antenna.\nA sketch of the cometary Explorer spacecraft is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nTotal\n\nspacecraft weight would be about 950 lb. which includes 150 lb. of experiments, 200 lb. of hydrazine fuel, and a 75-lb. solid retro-motor.\nBecause of the small launch energy requirements, the 950-lb. spacecraft\ncould be launched by the comparatively inexpensive Delta-2914 launch\nvehicle.\n_980_Encke Mission:\nto the sun (0.34 AU)\n\nOf all the short-period comets, Encke passes closest\nhas the shortest orbital period (T -\n\n3.3 years),\n\nand is probably the most interesting from a scientific viewpoint.\n\nIt\n\nhas also received the most attention in terms of its prior observation\nand orbit analysis.\n\nDiscovered in 1786, it has only been missed at one\n\napparition (1944) since 1819.\n\nThe physical appearance of Encke depends\n\non the solar activity, with the formation of a central condensation and\na tail quite likely when the sun is most active.\n\nIt is worth noting\n\nthat the 1980 return will take place only one year beyond the time of maximum\nsolar activity.\n\nThe diameter of Encke\'s coma is around 10 km, and the\n\nlength of the tail is somewhat less than 106km.\nAs can be deduced from Fig. 2, the earth-comet sighting geometry\nis excellent during Encke\'s 1980 passage.\n\nIt is estimated that the comet\n\nwill be recovered near the latter part of July in 1980, which is about\na month before the scheduled launch date.\n\nSince Encke\'s orbit is very\n\nwell known, there does not appear to be any guidance problem that cannot\nbe managed by the spacecraft\'s on-board propulsion system.\n\n12\n\nThe nominal mission profile is outlined in Fig. 5.\n\nTo obtain a low\n\nrelative velocity and also fly through the comet when it is very bright,\nit was decided to aim for an intercept in the vicintiy of Encke\'s perihelion.\n\nNote that the earth will be in an excellent position to observe\n\nthe perihelion encounter.\n\nThe exceptionally favorable alignment of the\n\nearth and Encke in 1980 permits the spacecraft to follow a transfer trajectory that is located in essentially the same plane as Encke\'s orbit.\nThis technique has apparently been overlooked in previous investigations\nwhere it has been erroneously stated that the minimum achievable relative\nvelocity for a 1980 intercept of Encke is about 23 km/sec.\n\nEven though\n\nthe extremely low relative velocity of 7.13 km/sec can only be obtained\nwith an "on-time" launch, a launch 12 days earlier would yield a relative\nvelocity of 10 km/sec and the launch energy requirement would actually\ndecrease to C3 = 87.5 km /sec\n2\nThe HELIOS spacecraft (illustrated in Fig. 6) would be a "natural"\nfor an Encke intercept at 0.34 AU.\n\nThis spin-stabilized spacecraft is\n\ndesigned to operate at solar distances as low as 0.25 AU, and the only\nmajor modification that would be required for the Encke mission would be\nthe addition of a hydrazine propulsion system.\n\nWith this modification,\n\nthe total spacecraft weight would be approximately 950 lb. including\n150 lb. of experiments.\n\nThis payload is well within the capability of\n\nthe Titan IIID/Centaur launch vehicle which can deliver almost 1400 lb.\nwhen C3\n\n-\n\n100 km /sec\n2\n\n13\n\nIn the post-encounter mission phase the spacecraft could be used to\ncarry out further investigations of the interplanetary medium within the\nearth\'s orbit augmenting the HELIOS A/B data that will be obtained during\na period of minimum solar activity.\n\nHowever, there is another extended-\n\nmission goal that should receive some consideration, that is to try for\na second intercept of Encke in 1984.\n\nThis possibility exists because\n\nthe spacecraft\'s orbital period is almost exactly equal to one-sixth\nEncke\'s period.\n\nTherefore, if a 3 1/2-year spacecraft lifetime could be\n\nachieved, two separate flythroughs of Encke would be possible, one near\nsolar maximum in 1980 and the other near solar minimum in 1984.\nConcluding Remarks\nThis brief paper has discussed two specific missions for early\nprecursor missions to the Comets Grigg-Skjellerup in 1977 and Encke in\n1980, which will provide definitive in-situ observations of the interaction of the solar wind with the cometary atmosphere and the composition\nof the neutral and ionized gases forming the atmosphere surrounding\nthe nucleus.\n\nNo attempt will be made to directly sample the nucleus\n\nitself but rather the entire environment of a comet and its energetics\nassociated with the solar wind will be investigated.\nSubsequently, it is proposed that follow-on missions include a\nrendezvous with Encke in 1984, based upon the observational results\nobtained in 1980 and finally an intercept with the dramatically visible\ntarget Halley in 1986.\n\nWe have rejected consideration of a rendezvous\n\n14\n\nwith Halley for several reasons among which is the extremely longlived mission required to achieve such an objective with presently\nconceived (but not now available) launch systems.\n\nA progressive,\n\norderly study of comets is essential to full utilization of mission\nopportunities for such "expensive" targets as Encke rendezvous and\nHalley intercept.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe are pleased to acknowledge the
