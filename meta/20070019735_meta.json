In the interest of national productivity, NASA is providing assistance both to longtime computer users and newcomers to automated operations. Through a special technology utilization service, NASA saves industry time and money by making available already developed computer programs which have secondary utility. A computer program is essentially a set of instructions which tells the computer how to produce desired information or effect by drawing upon its stored input. Developing a new program from scratch can be costly and time-consuming. Very often, however, a program developed for one purpose can readily be adapted to a totally different application. To help industry take advantage of existing computer technology, NASA operates the Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC)(registered TradeMark),located at the University of Georgia. COSMIC maintains a large library of computer programs developed for NASA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other technology-generating agencies of the government. The Center gets a continual flow of software packages, screens them for adaptability to private sector usage, stores them and informs potential customers of their availability.", "title": "Computer Technology for Industry", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019735, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019735, "id": "4c458e9b91fa423db89f4db217ba6ec9", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019735.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019735/downloads/20070019735.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019735/downloads/20070019735.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019735/downloads/20070019735.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
