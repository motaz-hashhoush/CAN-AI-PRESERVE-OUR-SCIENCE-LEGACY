It has been suggested that this is due to particles emitted from the ships, which increase the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei in the air, which, in turn, increases the concentrations of cloud droplets and reduces the average size of the droplets. Two ship track signatures in stratus clouds were observed simultaneously from a satellite and from an aircraft. The airborne measurements showed that in the ship tracks the droplet sizes and concentrations, as well as the total concentrations of particles, were substantially different from those in adjacent clouds. Furthermore, in-situ solar radiation measurements showed a significant enhancement in the upwelling radiance within the ship tracks at visible wavelengths and a significant reduction in radiance at 2.2 micrometers. Remote sensing measurements from the NOAA-10 satellite showed the effects of these differences in cloud structure as an enhancement in cloud reflectivity at 0.63 and 3.7 micrometers. These observations support the contention that ship track signatures in clouds are produced primarily by particles generated by ships.", "title": "Direct and remote sensing observations of the effects of ships on clouds", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900018936, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Radke, Lawrence F."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington Univ.", "location": "Seattle., United States"}}, "id": "75addfa5d738425cb8adbc968292fa8f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900018936, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hobbs, Peter V."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington Univ.", "location": "Seattle., United States"}}, "id": "c80fda5b8fa14556a7b61747ce646551"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900018936, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Coakley, James A., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Oregon State Univ.", "location": "Corvallis., United States"}}, "id": "adef8866bba349e6957700072b7741ca"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19900018936, "meta": {"author": {"name": "King, Michael D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "70fa53617d2846a2871d171fe3133fd4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900018936, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900018936, "id": "b42db5817b2e4841a95969bc9ce2e76c", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, FIRE Science Results 1989", "publicationDate": "1990-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19900018908, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "FIRE Science Results 1989", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
