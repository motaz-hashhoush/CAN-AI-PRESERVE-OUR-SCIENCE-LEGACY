In networks such as the Internet, the transport protocol must often form its own estimates of network properties based on measurements per-formed by the connection endpoints. We consider two basic transport estimation problems: determining the setting of the retransmission timer (RTO) for are reliable protocol, and estimating the bandwidth available to a connection as it begins. We look at both of these problems in the context of TCP, using a large TCP measurement set [Pax97b] for trace-driven simulations. For RTO estimation, we evaluate a number of different algorithms, finding that the performance of the estimators is dominated by their minimum values, and to a lesser extent, the timer granularity, while being virtually unaffected by how often round-trip time measurements are made or the settings of the parameters in the exponentially-weighted moving average estimators commonly used. For bandwidth estimation, we explore techniques previously sketched in the literature [Hoe96, AD98] and find that in practice they perform less well than anticipated. We then develop a receiver-side algorithm that performs significantly better.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20000004338, "name": "SIGCOMM ''99", "id": "62216f14cc6045e2ba42059be8852a58", "startDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000004338, "id": "f71ea4c0181c4c7a877ccd805e2d26fc", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000004338.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000004338/downloads/20000004338.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000004338/downloads/20000004338.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000004338/downloads/20000004338.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
