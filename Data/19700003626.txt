Barrett\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\nNovember, 1969\n\nNASA TM X-\n\nATLAS LAUNCHER TEST REPORT\nby HE, To Barrett\n\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\n6\n\nATLAS LAUNCHER TEST REPORT\n\n*XI(\n\n0\n\nSUMMARY\n\n03\n\nM\n\nm\n\nc;\n\nA series of static, cyclic and failure tests were performed on components of an Atlas rocket vehicle launcher to verify the capability of the\nlauncher to accept the launch loads expected with the uprated Atlas SLV-3C\nvehicle. An A-frame from the 1967 teardown of Eastern Test Range Complex 14 and an end-frame and a launcher head from spare launchers were\nusedfor this test.\n\nThe A-frame was subjected to both static and cyclic limit rTdownT\'\nloads by applying the test load to auxiliary support pins. The A-frame\nsuccessfully passed the cyclic and static ultimate load tests; a subsequent\nfailure test then resulted in excessive deflection of the A-frame pin at 214%\nlimit load,\nThe end-frame was subjected to both \'?upTT TTdownT\'\nand\nstatic limit load\nand cyclic limit load tests. Load was applied to the end-frames through the\nsupport a r m mechanism (head) by applying the test load to the main support\npins. The end-frame withstood all test loads through ultimate load with no\nfailures, The launcher head pin broke at 180% limit load, resulting in a\nbroken longeron bearing. Following repair, tests were continued to 200%\nlimit loads, at which time the dummy link (which replaced the hold-down\ncylinder in the test rig) broke. Inspection following these tests revealed\nthat yielding had taken place in some areas of the end-frame. Two new\nlauncher frame cracks and three extensions of existing cracks resulted\nfrom this end-frame test program,\nT M X-52709\n\n2\nINTRQDUC TION\n\nThe Atlas launcher functions as a structural frame which supports the\nlaunch vehicle prior to and during liftoff. The launcher transfers its load\ninto a concrete foundation on the launch pad (figure 1). The launchers\npresently used at the Eastern Test Range were designed for the Atlas 4A,\nwith a weight of 181,000 lbs. and a thrust of 270,000 lbs. These same\nlaunchers were subsequently scheduled to be used for the uprated Atlas\nSLV-3C with a weight of 325,000 lbs. and a thrust of 394,000 pounds. The\nprimary objective of the test program reported herein was to verify that\nthese launchers were capable of sustaining the resulting increased loads\nwith no redesign.\nIn addition, it was desired to increase launch availability of the vehicle\nby raising the allowable ground wind loads. Thus the test loads included\nthrust buildup, rise off disconnect loads, ground winds, rise-off moment,\nengine vibration loads and launch abort loads, as well as random dynamics\nloads. Using these criteria, limit end-frame test loads of 181 kips* rrdownTT\nwere derived. The ultimate loads were 150% of these\nand 236 kips \'Tuppr\nvalues., In like manner, the limit and ultimate A-frame test loads were\ndetermined to be 131 kips and 196. 5 kips respectively, these being in the\nPvdownq\ndirection only.\nThe ultimate margins of safety, comparing the maximum anticipated\nuprated loads used for this test to maximum existing SLV-3C design loads,\nare 1,43 for the A-frame and 0 . 4 6 for the end frame as shown:\nI96\nA-frame M. S. = - - 1 = L 4 3\n81\n\n271.5\nEnd-frame M. S. = -- 1 = Oe46\n186\n\nStress analyses indicated that the end-frame main support pins and the Aframe auxiliary pins were the niost critical components of the launcher.\n\n*A kip is\n\n1000 lbs,\n\n3\n\nThe test launcher had end-frames which were removed from a spare\nlauncher that had never been used, Spool sections were obtained from two\nother damaged launchers which were unfit for launches; heads were obtained\nfrom one of these three launchers; and the A-frames were salvaged from the\n1967 tear-down of ETR Complex 14, All testing was done in the Lewis Research Center Space Power Chamber Facility.\nIra addition to the primary objective, the tests were conducted to prove\nthat a launcher will operate satisfactorily with numerous weld cracks and\nother defects. Various inspections of several launchers in the field were\nmade and most of these launchers had manufacturing defects. Due to the\ndepth limitations of the magnetic particle inspection equipment, it was felt\nthat many undiscovered defects were present in the launchers. New defects\nwere sometimes detected after each launch or proof load, arousing concern\nthat the presence of these defects could lead to catastrophic failure during a\nlaunch, The launcher used for this test program contained 114 known defects.\nThe worst operational launcher inspected to date had 80 known defects.\nLAUNCHER TEST CONFIGURATION\nThe launcher provides a structural support for the vehicle in the upright position through a four-point system which is comprised of two main\n\nsupport pins on rotating heads and two adjustable vertical auxiliary supports\n(figure 1). Each rotating head is fastened at two bearing supports to an endframe which is made up of two tripod type supports that are tied together by\ncenter cross members. A hold-down and release cylinder ties the rotating\nhead to the center of the end-frame. This cylinder allows the head to take\nboth up and down loads and holds the head in position until the missile builds\nup sufficient thrust for a launch. At this time the cylinder is vented, allowing the head to rotate and retract the pin from the longeron bearing (socket)\nas the missile lifts off (figures 1 and 2).\nThe vertical auxiliary supports previously referred to are called Aframes, due to the geometry of their construction. Each has a pin which\nfits into a vehicle longeron socket. These pins are interconnected by means\n\n4\n\nof a hydraulic-pneumatic system such that while the downward resistance\nto load of one pin increases as it is loaded, the downward resistance of the\npin on the other side is decreasing. Thus the function of these two supports\nis to restrict vehicle tipping in the launch position by assuring equal pin deflections. The entire A-frame is pneumatically pivoted away from the vehicle as it lifts off.\n\nTest Equipment\nThe A-frames used for this test were salvaged from an operational\nlauncher at ETR, Complex 44, when this launcher was replaced, in order\nto provide a test launcher in a current operational configuration. Both the\nend-frame and the A-frame were tested in the Space Power Chamber\nFacility at LeRC. The A-frame test set-up is shown in figures 3, 4, and 7;\nthe end-frame test set-up is shown in figures 2, 5, 6, and 8. The major\ntest components were the "Basic Tool" Launcher, the A-frames, launcher\nhead, end-frame test beams, A-frame test beam, hydraulic cylinder and\nadapters and the solid link which replaced the launcher hold-down cylinder\nfor this test. Loading was accomplished with a pneumatic-hydraulic system\ndesigned at LeRC. (All major test components are shown and identified in\nfigures 7 and 8,)\nFor the end-frame test, a steel block fitted with a longeron bearing was\nmounted on top of a hydraulic cylinder. Once the head pin was inserted in\nthe bearing, the head was tied to the block with eye-bolts (figure 6) to keep\nthe pin from disengaging during loading. The test fixture was a 30 W F beam\nwhich spanned the complete launcher and transferred the load from the launcher\nhead to the launcher support points. The load input came from a double acting 300 ton hydraulic cylinder. This method of testing was inexpensive and\nprovided a good simulation of launch loads.\nFor the A-frame tests the hydraulic cylinder was fitted with an adapter\nwhich was bored to f i t directly over the head of the A-frame pin. Thus, by\nmounting the cylinder in an inverted position on a cross beam which in turn\nw a s supported by two tension members (figures 4 and 7), it was possible to\nload the pin in the down direction.\n\n5\nThe A-frame was fitted with a solid (dummy) link to replace the\nhydraulic-pneumatic pin support system used for an actual launch. The\nsolid link held the pin in a fixed position s o that it could be loaded and the\ntotal deformation measured during testing. (See figure 9 for close-up\nview of the pin area,) The A-frame retraction cylinder used for launches\nwas disconnected during all A-frame testing so that no bending moment\ncould be induced in the A-frame.\nLoad System\nLoads were applied to the test members by a hydraulic cylinder. The\nload applied was directly proportional to the piston area and the hydraulic\npressure, An air-driven hydraulic pump was utilized to obtain the necessary hydraulic pressure, The pump discharge pressure was equal to the\nair pressure times a proportionality factor of 88. Therefore, the test load\nwas directly proportional to the air pressure applied to the pump.\nTwo loading systems were used. Static loads were applied manually\nand cyclic loads were applied automatically as shown in the schematic of\nfigure 10. The manual system consisted of controlling the air discharge\npressure of pressure regulator 1 by loader 8. One psi of loader pressure\nequaled one psi of regulator pressure. Hydraulic fluid could be directed\nto the top or bottom of the r a m by actuation of the 4-way solenoid valve 10.\nHydraulic pressure was read out in the control room by means of transducers 13 and 14 and transmitters 19 and 22, Check valves 11 and 12\n1\npermitted unrestricted flow to the ram. The pressure could be reduced\nby unloading pressure regulator 1 and actuating the 4-way valve so that\nthe pressurized line was connected to the reservoir. Valves 15 and 16\nwere preset for the desired hydraulic r a m velocity. (Note: Depressurization and withdrawal rates were controlled by the combination of pressure\nregulator load value and the preset restrictions. )\nThe automatic cycling system utilized the same components of the\nmanual system with the addition of an electrical timer. Since the maximum\ncyclic loads were known, loaders 7 and 8 could be preset to their proper\n\n6\n\nh\n\noutput pressures. Solenoid valve 6 determined which regulated air pressure\nwas applied to the pump and was operated by the electrical timer. The 4way solenoid valve 10 again diverted hydraulic flow from the pump to the\ntop o r bottom of the r a m and valves 15 and 16 controlled the r a m velocity.\nThe automatic cycling sequence was:\nload\n1. An TpupTt was obtained as the 3-way air solenoid valve 6 was\nactuated by the electrical timer, Solenoid valve 6 connected loader\n8 to pressure regulator 1. The pump discharge pressure increased\nto the preset loader 8 pressure.\n2. Hydraulic fluid from the pump flowed through the 4-way solenoid\nvalve 10, unrestricted, through check valve 11 into the piston head\nside of the cylinder. Fluid from the piston rod side of the cylinder\nflowed back to the reservoir, through valve 16, which controls\ncylinder velocity, and through 4-way valve 10.\n3. The electrical timer was initially preset to assure a minimum\ntime of 5 seconds load application. When this time had elapsed,\nthe 4-way valve was actuated (the pump was then connected to the\nupper cylinder) and the 3-way solenoid valve 6 was actuated to\nconnect loader 7 to pressure regulator 1. The hydraulic pressure\nbuilt up to the preset loader 7 pressure.\n4 Hydraulic fluid flowed into the upper cylinder from the pump un.\nrestricted by check valve 12. Fluid from the lower cylinder flowed\nto the reservoir through throttle valve 15.\n5 When the timer timed out, the 4-way solenoid valve was actuated\n.\n(the pump was then connected to the piston head side of the cylinder),\n3-way solenoid valve 6 connected loader 8 to pressure regulator 1,\nand a cycle counter was indexed one count.\n6. The cycling action was repeated automatically for the required\nnumber of c yc 1es.\nloads were required, loader\n7. For the A-frame, where only ??downTP\n7 was set for zero 9TupTv\nload,\n\n7\nInstrumentation\nInstrumentation - end-frame. - All main structural members subjected\nto axial loads were instrumented with axial strain gages (figures 11 and 12).\nThese gages were mounted in pairs on the Quad I side in order to measure\nboth axial and bending loads. Since the end-frame is symmetrical, the\nQuad IV side had single gages as.a check on the Quad I gages. Strain\ngages were also installed on the dummy link which replaced the hold-down\ncylinder on the test rig.\nThose weld joints which were thought to be highly stressed, and the\ncenter 4130 steel plates were instrumented with rosette strain gages (see\nfigures 14- 18). A single deflection measurement was made between the\nlauncher head and the floor as shown in figure 2.\nMost of the strain gage measurements were recorded on Central\nAutomatic Digital Data Encoder (CADDE) Automatic Voltage Digitizer\n(AVD) for a computer program which converted readings to stresses and\nloads. In addition, some gages were monitored on Brush recorders. Calibration of the various channels was made from the CADDE type-back and\na table of calibrations was given to the computer programmer for each\ntest run.\nA TV camera was focused on the launcher hold-down pin during the\nstatic ultimate and failure tests. A rule was mounted on the launcher\nhead to monitor deflection on TV during the test. Photos were taken of\nthe launcher longeron bearing at the end of some cyclic tests. Photos\nwere taken of all failed parts on failure tests (figures 19, 20, 21, 22).\nPhotos of crack extensions and new cracks were also taken after each\ntest (figures 23- 26).\nInstrumentation - A-frame. - The two pin bushing support blocks and\nthe stabilizer bushing block were instrumented with rosette strain gages\nas shown in figure 27. The A-frame pin was instrumented with axial\nstrain gages as shown in figure 28. Two additional gages were added to\nthe pin for some of the cyclic tests, s o that there were four readings 90\'\napart. At the same time four axial gages were installed 90\' apart on the\n\n8\n\ndummy link which replaces the hydraulic stabilizer cylinder. (The dummy\nlink gage installation is shown in figure 9. ) A single deflection measurement was taken between the pin collar and the floor (figure 4), The deflecdirection only.\ntion was in the vTdown9T\nOnly one TV camera was used for this test set-up. It was focused on\nthe A-frame main pin during the ultimate static test and the destruct test.\nPhotos were taken of all failed parts and of all new cracks and crack extensions. (See figures 29, 30, and 31 for crack locations.)\nTEST PROCEDURES\nEnd- Frame\nThe initial test consisted of a static load of 181 kips "downv\' and 236 kips\n91upvv explained on page 2. (These loads compare to the present maximum\nas\ndesign SLV-3C loads of 186 kips \'*down*\'and 181 kips "up. ") CADDE and\nBrush readings were obtained.\nAfter static limit testing, a series of three cyclic tests were run., These\ntests consisted of 25, 50, and 25 cycles, a cycle being 181 kips rrdown\'\' and\n236 kips "up. v t No CADDE data were taken during cyclic testing.\nAfter completion of cyclic testing a static ultimate test (1, 5 X limit load)\nwas conducted. The loads were 271 kips lldownT* 354 kips "up. \'\' This\nand\ntest utilized CAEDDE and Brush instrumentation.\nAfter the static ultimate test, two failure tests were performed. Both\nfailure loads were in the "upTfdirection, On the first failure test the holddown pin and hold-down bearing both fractured (see photos of figures 19\nand 20). A reconditioned hold-down pin and a used hold-down bearing were\ninstalled for the final failure test. This test ended when the dummy link, a\ntest piece designed to replace the hold-down cylinder, failed in tension at\n448 kips (see figures 21 and 22).\n\n9\n\nA-Frame\nThe initial A-frame test consisted of a static load application of 131 kips,\nwhich was derived from a bending moment of 8.0X10 6 in-lbs. This load compares to a maximum design SLV-3C load of 8 1 kips.\nThe first cyclic test was 15 cycles at 1 3 1 kips. (A cycle is an application,\ndirection only. )\nand release of 1 3 1 kips in the rrdowntT\nThe second cyclic test consisted of 35 cycles at 131 kips and the third\ncyclic test, 50 cycles at 131 kips. The fourth cyclic test consisted of 100\ncycles at 131 kips and the fifth cyclic test, 200 cycles at 131 kips. The\nsixth and seventh cyclic tests were 300 cycles each at 131 kips. No CADDE\nreadings were taken on any cyclic runs.\nCyclic testing was followed by a second static limit test of 1 3 1 kips as\na check for yielding of the structure. This static limit test was followed by\na static ultimate test of 196. 5 kips. The final A-frame test was a static test\nto destruction.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA- Frame\n\nSome results and explanations of each test are described below; they\na r e summarized in tables 1 and 2,\nFor the first static test, the CADDE computer calculations from strain\ngage measurements indicated a pin s t r e s s of 126,000 psi compression on\ngage 14 (see figure 28) compared to 130,000 psi compression read on the\nBrush recorder. The measured applied load was 130.4 kips on CADDE\nand 134.8 kips on Brush., Although the indicated maximum s t r e s s exceeded the theoretical minimum yield (100,000 psi) of the pin, no permanent\nset was detected in the pin or frame upon completion of this test. Inspection,\nrevealed no new cracks or crack extensions,\nThe first cyclic test initiated four new cracks (numbered 35, 36, 37, 38),\nas shown in figures 29 and 30. However, no permanent deformation was detected in any members, and none of the other gages except gage 13 indicated\nstresses above yield. The second cyclic test initiated one new crack (num-\n\n10\nber 39 in figure 29) and once again no yielding was visible. The third\ncyclic test initiated two new cracks but there were still no visible signs\nof yield. (Cracks 40 and 41 in figures 30 and 31. ) The fourth, fifth,\nsixth, and seventh cyclic tests created no new defects.\nOn the second static limit test, the CADDE computer calculations\nindicated a maximum pin stress of 171,000 psi compression on gage 14,\ncompared to a Brush reading of 141,000 psi. (The difference in stresses\nbetween this static test and the first static test is attributed to yielding of\nthe pin.)\nFor the third static (limit) test, the CADDE computer calculations\nindicated a m i m u m pin stress of 234,000 psi compression on gage 14,\ncompared to a Brush reading of 191,000 psi. Four new cracks were\ninitiated by this test (numbered 42, 43, 44, 45 in figure 3 ) however,\n0;\nno permanent deformation was visible.\nOn the fourth static (destruct) test, the pin failed in bending and compression at 272 kips (on Brush) and 251 kips on CADDE. (The Brush reading is more accurate in this case, as the CADDE reading was taken just\nafter the peak load, ) Maximum s t r e s s read on rosette gage 9-1 was 71,200\npsi compression (see figure 27). Maximum stresses calculated by CADDE\nwere 332,000 psi tension on gage 13, 373,000 psi compression on gage 14\n(figure 2 ) and a maximum principal stress of 62,854 p s i compression on\n8,\nrosette gage 7-1. The readings on gages 13 and 14 were erroneous, however, since these gages were not adequate to measure large strains above\nthe elastic limit. This test initiated three new cracks, numbered 46, 47,\nand 48 in figures 29 and 3 .\n0\nMember stresses were not measured, as structural analysis indicated\nthat the pin, bushings and welds around the pin were more critical than\nstructural members. No deterioration of main members was found after\ntesting.\nThe only part to fail (by excessive deflection) during this test series\nwas the auxiliary support pin. However, the top actuator bracket bolt had\neither yielded or the pin had bent sufficiently s o that the bolt had to be\nburned out with a torch. The failed pin is shown in figure 34 prior to disassembly and in figures 35 and 36 after disassembly.\n\n11\n\nEnd- Frame\nA summary of all end-frame testing is presented in table 3. The series\nof tests conducted on the end-frame indicated that the weakest part of the\nstructure is the main hold-down pin. However, the actual hold-down cylinder\nwas not a part of the test article, s o no conclusions can be drawn regarding\nits strength. The dummy link which broke on the second failure test was a\ntest article which replaced the hold-down cylinder. The missile longeron\nbearings appear to be the next weakest link in the system. Main structural\nmembers were not yielded, and the only permanent s e t detected in the main\nlauncher was the yielding around the hold-down cylinder lower attach point.\nThe first static test resulted in maximum calculated stresses of 33,652\npsi tension on gage 1-3 and 26,867 psi tension on gage 3-8 for down loading.\nFor up loading, the maximum calculated stresses were 39,588 psi compression on gage 1-3 and 36,885 psi compression on gage 3-8. (See figures 14\nand 16 for gage locations.) No yielding of members was detected.\nOn the first cyclic test (25 cycles), the only significant change noted was\na slightly brinelled Atlas longeron bearing. Cyclic test No. 2 (50 cycles)\nbrinelled the Atlas bearing much more but the bearing was still not replaced\nuntil after completion of cyclic test No. 3 (25 cycles). At this time the\nlongeron bearing w a s photographed both before and after disassembly\n(figures 32 and 33).\nAfter completion of cyclic testing, static test No. 2 (le5 X limit load)\nwas run. This test had both CADDE and Brush instrumentation. This test\nproduced no failures, although the maximum measured stresses were well\nabove minimum yield (33,000 psi). After the static ultimate test, two\nfailure tests were performed.\nOn the first failure test (Static No. 3) the hold-down pin and hold-down\nbearing both fractured (see photos of figures 20 and 21). (*The failure\npin\nwas thought to be the cause of the bearing failure. ) The measured load was\n432 kips up (on Brush) at the time of failure., The last CADDE reading taken\nbefore failure was at 379.8 kips.\nA reconditioned hold-down pin and a used hold-down bearing were installed for the final failure test. This test ended when the dummy link, a\n\n12\n\ntest part designed to replace the hold-down cylinder, failed in tension at\n448 kips (see figures 2 1 and 22). The last CADDE reading before failure\nwas at 407.4 kips.\nAlthough no other parts failed there was evidence of launcher yield.\nThe dummy link bottom attaching pin could not be pulled out for removal\nof the link, (See figure 2. ) The longeron hold-down bearing was dented,\nbut this dent was probably caused by the link failure.\nAn attempt was made in this test series to measure and correlate weld\nstresses and parent material stresses. Rosette gages were installed on\nwelds and axial gages on longitudinal members. A s noted earlier, the maximum weld stresses were 75,877 p s i compression on rosette gage 1-3\n(figure 14) and 54,782 psi compression on rosette gage 3-8 (figure 16), for\na calculated load of 379,8 kips on the first failure test. These same gages\nmeasured stresses of 66,708 psi compression and 59,973 psi compression respectively for a calculated load of 407.4 kips on the second failure test.\nThe smaller reading for a larger load indicates that yielding took place in\nthe weld (weld and parent material minimum yield strength was estimated\nto be 33,000 psi). The highest reading on an axial gage for the 379.8 kip\nload w a s 30,000 psi on gage 5 (Brush). Thus, the axial members were not\ncritically loaded during this test, but the welds were critically loaded.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Atlas launcher end-frame and A-frame test results indicate that\nthese structures have adequate margins of safety (ref, p. 2) for maximum\nSLV-3C loads. Therefore, these launcher components can be safely used\nfor SLV-3C launches with no major redesign. The fact that s o many limit\ncyclic load tests were run with no adverse effects and that subsequent\nultimate and failure tests were run with much higher loads than were\napplied during the cyclic tests shows that a single launcher can support\nthe existing SLV-3C Centaur program with confidence. The fact that the\ntest launcher had more cracks than any launcher previously used indicates\nthat a large number of cracks does not necessarily make a launcher unsafe\nfor SLV-3C launches.
