JWST requires a Primary Mirror Segment Assembly (PMSA) that can survive launch, deploy and align itself to form a 25 square meter collecting area 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror with a 131 nm rms wavefront error at temperatures less than 50K and provide stable optical performance. At the inception of JWST in 1996, such a capability did not exist. A highly successful technology development program was initiated including the Sub-scale Beryllium Mirror Demonstrator (SBMD) and Advanced Mirror System Demonstrator (AMSD) projects. These projects along with flight program activities have matured and demonstrated mirror technology for JWST. Directly traceable prototypes or flight hardware has been built, tested and operated in a relevant environment. This paper summarizes that technology development effort.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070038371, "endDate": "2007-08-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "Bellingham, WA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2b1767c5dae5451286b1407907fdcc9b", "id": "40238bb0f7364892b04496a5b2fabfd7"}], "name": "Optics and Photonics 2007", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "2b1767c5dae5451286b1407907fdcc9b", "startDate": "2007-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070038371, "id": "1c0193da49604905b264e108aafd67b4", "publicationDate": "2007-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070038371.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070038371/downloads/20070038371.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070038371/downloads/20070038371.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070038371/downloads/20070038371.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
