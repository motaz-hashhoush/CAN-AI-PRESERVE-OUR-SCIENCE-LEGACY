The objective of the experiments is\nto investigate the physical properties of satellite\nfragments, including those originated from Multi-Layer\nInsulation and a solar panel. One test generated\napproximately 1,800 fragments while the other did only\n1,000 fragments. This difference came from the number\nof needle-like fragments from carbon fiber reinforced\nplastics. All collected fragments were analyzed using\nthe same method as described in the NASA standard\nbreakup model and compared with the breakup model.\nThis paper will present: (1) the area-to-mass ratio, size,\nand mass distributions of the fragments, and (2) the\ndifferences in fragment properties between the two tests.\n1 BACKGROUND\nTo predict the future orbital environments, the NASA\nstandard breakup model was driven and is being\nreferred to estimate the outcome of satellite impact\nfragmentation. The NASA standard breakup model is\nderived from some on-orbit experiments and ground\nhypervelocity impact tests, and these experiments\nprovide empirical data to be incorporated in e the model.\nConducting satellite impact tests contributes to increase\nthe test data and to expand the versatility of the breakup\nmodel.\nAt the Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007, the\nFengyun-1C weather satellite was hit by a warhead and\nbroke up into thousands of fragments scattered in space.\nAbout 2,700 Fengyun-1C fragments were being tracked\nby the U.S. Space Surveillance Network by March 2008.\nThe area-to-mass ratio distribution of the Fengyun-1C\nfragments shows that there are more fragments, and\nmore lightweight materials than the NASA prediction of\nthe fragments for an average breakup of a similar-sized\nvehicle. Fragments contributing to this difference are\nfrom plastics, solar panel, and Multi-Layer Insulation\n(MLI) pieces. Targets used in the development of the\nNASA standard breakup model did not have such kind\nof modern light-weight materials.\n\nAs new satellite materials continue to be developed, for\nexample Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP),\nthere is a need for impact tests based on more modern\nmaterials to better characterize the outcome of future\non-orbit fragmentations The results will be utilized to\nimprove our understanding of high area-to-mass ratio\nobjects, and to improve breakup models for better\nmodeling of orbital debris environment.\nKyushu University and NASA Orbital Debris Program\nOffice have collaborated to conduct micro-satellite\nimpact tests since 2005. In 2005, we conducted the tests\nto investigate the outcome of hypervelocity impacts and\nlow-velocity impacts. After the tests, in 2007, we did\nthree more tests to investigate the effects of impact\ndirections. Finally in 2008, we conducted the two\nimpact tests. The target satellites were almost the same\nas 2007 experiments and the difference is two material\nadded in 2008 tests, which is MLI and solar panel.\nThe objectives of these experiments are (1) to\ninvestigate the fragments from MLI and solar cells, and\n(2) to compare the analyzed results from those two\nimpact tests with the prediction of NASA standard\nbreakup model.\n2 NASA STANDARD BREAKUP MODEL\nThe NASA standard breakup model describes the\noutcome of satellite fragmentation driven by\nhypervelocity impact tests. The model includes the size\ndistribution, area-to-mass ratio (A/m) distribution, and\nsize-to-area conversion.\nThis on-orbit breakup model is used as a source for\ndebris environment models; the update provides a\nmodel that is consistent with the latest data. The data\nsources used for the update were laboratory data,\nprimarily\nfrom\nthe\nSatellite\nOrbit\nDebris\nCharacterization Impact Test (SOCIT) and the Space\nSurveillance Network (SSN) catalogs for on-orbit\nfragments.\nThe NASA standard breakup model 1998 revision is\nquite different from other fragmentation models.\n\nPreviously, mass and diameter were used\ninterchangeably as the independent variable. However,\nwith the incorporation of A/m distributions, this\ninterchangeability is lost, and therefore characteristic\nlength was chosen as the independent variable. The\nfollowing subsections will describe the collision model\nadopted in the NASA standard breakup model 1998\nrevision. [7]\nThe creation of the NASA standard breakup model\ndepended strongly on data collected since the early\n1980\xe2\x80\x99s, including:\n1) The Solwind (P78-1) and the USA 19(Delta-180)\ndeliberate hypervelocity collision in low-Earth orbit\nin 1985 and 1986, respectively.\n2) The\nground-based\nSatellite\nOrbit\nDebris\nCharacterization Impact Test (SOCIT) series in 1991\nand 1992. The test series consisted of one pre-test\nshot and four test shots summarized in Table 2.1.\n3) The Ariane upper stage sub-scale explosion tests\nperformed by the European Space Agency\n4) An extensive compilation of historical orbital data\n(i.e., two-line element sets) for explosion and\ncollision debris used to determine ejection velocity\nand area-to-mass ratio distributions.\nFor the reader to find the original equations, it should be\nnoted that the detail of the NASA standard breakup\nmodel could be found in Johnson et al. [8].\n\nComponents\nThe interior of each micro-satellite was equipped with\nfully functional electric devices, such as a wireless radio,\nnickel hydride battery, and communication circuit,\nelectric power supply, and command and data handling\ncircuits.\nMLI and Solar panel\nThe four side panels and the bottom layer are covered\nwith MLI sheets and the remaining side is equipped\nwith a solar panel. The MLI sheets have six layers (see\nalso Fig. 2) and consist of two sections, A and B, as\nshown in Fig. 3.3. The section A was attached to the\nbottom layer while the section B was wrapped around\nthe four side panels. They were fixed to the satellite\nsurfaces with Velcro. The top layer was equipped with\na solar panel. Solar panel consists of six solar cells and\nan aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel with CFRP\nface sheet. Each solar cell is 56\xc3\x9742 mm in size.\n\n3 IMPACT TESTS\nThe two satellite impact experiments were conducted\nusing the two-stage light gas gun at the Kyushu Institute\nof Technology in Kitakyushu, Japan.\nThe micro-satellite targets for the impact experiments\nare identical, and the details are as follows.\nStructure\nTarget satellites are 20 cm by 20 cm by 20 cm in size\nand approximately 1,500 g in mass (including MLI).\nThe main structure of each micro-satellite is composed\nof five layers (top and bottom layers and three inner\nlayers parallel to the top and bottom layers.) and four\nside panels. They are assembled with angle bars made\nof aluminum alloy and metal spacers. The external\nlayers and side panels are made of CFRP. The\nthickness of top and bottom CFRP panel are 2 mm and\nthat of rest side panels are 1 mm. The three internal\nlayers are made of Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics\n(GFRP) of 1 mm thickness.\n\nFigure 1 Satellite Structure\n\nFigure 2 MLI Components\n\nFigure 3 Target Micro Satellites and MILs; (left)\nTarget Micro Satellite Not Covered with MLI,\n(center) MLIs, (right) Target Micro-Satellite Covered\nwith MLI.\n\nProjectile\nAluminum alloy solid spheres, each with a diameter of\n30 mm and a mass of approximately 40 grams, are\nprepared as projectiles.\nTest Conditions\nWe prepared two satellite impact tests as shown in Fig.\n4 to investigate the differences in fragments depending\non impact plane. Table 1 summarizes the impact\nparameters.\n1) Shot F;\nThe solar panel faces the incoming projectile.\n2) Shot R;\nThe solar panel was attached to the opposite side\n\nNo Frame\nFigure 4 Test Conditions\nTable 1.

Figure 5\nshows the impact fragmentation viewed edge-on.\nSome differences in the impact fragmentation could be\ncaused by impact direction with respect to the solar\npanel.\n1) Shot F generated a flame but Shot R did not.\n2) Debris cloud in Shot F is larger than the one in Shot\nR.\n3) Fragmentation of MLI wrapped around the side\npanels was different between Shot F between and\nShot R.\nShot F; side MLI fragmented as coming unstuck.\nShot R; side MLI was torn into three large fragments\n\nFigure 5 Impact Fragmentation\n4.2\n\nOverview of fragments\n\nFigs. 6,7 show fragments and MLI pieces collected from\nthe tests. There are noticeable differences between the\ntwo sets.\n1) Shot F generated much more fragments (1,800)\npieces than Shot R did (1,000). Shot R has some\nlarger fragments than Shot F such as CFRP panels,\nGFRP panels and MLI.\n2) Regarding MLI pieces, a significant difference in\nsize and number can be observed from Fig. 7. The\nlargest MLI piece in the Shot F is almost the same\nin size as the CFRP layers or side panels, whereas\nthat in Shot R is about half of MLI wrapped around\nthe four side panels.\n3) The number of needle-like fragments (One example\nis shown in Fig. 8), broken up from CFRP, is also\ndifferent between the two tests. This depends on\n\nwhether the CFRP panels split or not. Fragments\nfrom the impact plane and the back plane of impact\nare shown in Fig. 9)\n4) Regarding the fraction of fragments, they are totally\ndifferent between two tests as shown in Fig. 10.\nThe number of CFRP fragments, as described\nabove, is the main cause. Fig. 11 shows the\nfraction of fragments characteristic but excluding\nCFRP fragments. The difference between the two\ntests in Fig. 11 is not so dramatically as in Fig. 10.\nThe most notable differences are the solar cells and\nMLI. The difference depends on the direction that\nthe projectile hit.\n\nFigure 6 Overview of Fragments; (left) Shot F,\n(right) Shot R\n\nFigure 10 Material Fraction\n\nFigure 11 Material Fraction without CFRP Fragments\n5 DISCUSSIONS\n5.1\n\nFigure 7 All Fragments from MLI; (left) Shot F,\n(right) Shot R\n\nFigure 8 An Example of the Needle-Like Fragments\nIncoming projectile\n\nShot F\n\nShot R\n\nImpact plane\nThe back\n\nFigure 9 Impact Plane and The Back\n\nSize Distribution\n\nFig. 11 shows the cumulative distribution of\ncharacteristic lengths. The vertical axis shows the\ncumulative number of fragments of the same size or\nlarger than the number on the horizontal axis, i.e. the\ncharacteristic length. There is a measurement limit to\nthe range above 10-3 m in characteristic length.\nThe test results and NASA predictions seem to have a\nsimilar trend. The NASA predictions underestimate the\nfragments in Shot F. On the other hand, in Shot R, it\noverestimates at the range above 2\xc3\x9710-2m but\nunderestimates at the range below 2\xc3\x9710-2m. The main\nreason for the difference between Shot F and Shot R\ncomes from the number of CFRP fragments. The size\nrange that the NASA prediction underestimates in Shot\nR is containing many needle-like\nCFRP fragments.\nFor readers' general interest, Fig. 13 lists the size\ndistribution of FY-1C. Please be noticed that the axis\norder is different from Fig. 12 because the size of\nsatellite is totally different between FY-1C and our\ntarget satellites.\nIn comparison with the FY-1C\nfragments and our target satellite, especially in Shot F, it\nseems to have same trend in qualitative discrepancy\nwith the NASA prediction.\n\n5.2\n\nMass Distribution\n\nFig. 14 shows the mass distribution. In both tests, the\nNASA model overestimates the fragment mass. It\ndepends on the fact that modern materials have changed\nto be lighter and the target used in the development of\nthe NASA standard breakup model did not have such\nmodern light-weighted materials. Shot F and Shot R\nshow the same inclination\n5.3\n\nArea to Mass Distribution\n\nThe largest disagreement between the NASA model and\nour own test results is the A/m ratio distribution. The\nmaterials used for target satellites have a direct\ninfluence on the A/m ratio distribution. For example,\nCFRP, the one of the high A/m ratio material, has been\nadopted as the satellite structure instead of metal since\n1990s.\nThe significant two on-orbit experiments\nderiving NASA\xe2\x80\x99s standard breakup model might not\npossess CFRP structure. As shown in Fig. 15, the\nNASA prediction is a normal distribution whereas the\ntest results seem to have two peaks in the 2007 test (See\nalso Fig. 19) and three peaks in Shot F and Shot R(See\nalso Figs.17 and 18).\n\nFigure\nModel\n\nIn the 2008 tests, the A/m ratio distribution seems to be\ncomposed of three major groups. In the order of A/m\nfrom higher to lower, these groups are;\n1) MLI\n2) CFRP\n3) The remaining fragments (GFRP, Electric device,\nMetal, Plastic, and Solar cell).\n\n12\n\nSize Distribution Comparison to NASA\n\nFigure 13 Size Distribution of FY-1C Fragmens[6]\n\nFurthermore, the MLI fragments seem to have been\nclassified further into two more groups. From those\nFigures, the distribution of the outer MLI sheet can be\nclassified into the CFRP fragments whereas the inner\nMLI sheet forms the new third group.\nThe FY-1C\xe2\x80\x99s A/m ratio distribution has same tendency\nwith our test results in terms of exist of the three peaks\nand abundance of the high A/M pieces. Please notice\nthat the differences of the number order as well as size\ndistribution. FY-1C launched in 1999 and it is speculate\nthe satellite structure is CFRP. Therefore the second\npeak of the A/m distribution is viewed as CFRP.\n\nFigure 14 Mass Distribution\n\n.\nTo predict A/m ratio properly, it seems to be useful\nconsidering the three groups. We was wondering if it is\npossible to make a superposition model using the three\ngroups as previously mentioned, that is MLI, CFRP and\nothers. This is likely to become an issue to be addressed\nin the future\n\nFigure 15 Area-to-Mass Distribution Comparison to\nNASA Model\n\nFigure 19 Area-to-Mass Ratio from one of the 2007\ntests\n6 CONCLUSION\nThis paper analyzed fragments properties from the two\ntests and compares the results with the NASA standard\nbreakup model to draw the following conclusions:\n\nFigure 16 Area-to-Mass Ratio of FY-1C Fragments[6]\n\nFigure 17 Area-to-Mass Ratio from Shot F\n\n1) In terms of the size distribution, the NASA standard\nbreakup model and test results seem to have a\nsimilar trend. Almost all the relatively large\nfragments were measured but there are still some\nsmall fragments close to the measurement limit.\nSize distribution has a direct inference on the\nnumber of collected fragments. Thus we must\nmeasure more fragments. In the mass distribution,\nthe NASA prediction overestimates the fragments\nmass by extension satellite mass. It depends on the\nmaterial used for satellite was changed to lighter e.g.\nCFRP and GFRP.\n2) Mass distribution and A/m ratio distribution are\ngreatly influenced by the materials adopted. In these\ntests, we can find three peaks in the A/m distribution,\ni.e. the MLI group, the CFRP group and the others.\nTherefore, consideration of materials is required to\nmodeling those distributions adequately.\nAs the results from the experiments, considering\nsatellite materials is required for the modeling. It is\nquite hard to generalize the satellite components. It will\nbe useful to classify by the three groups, i.e. the MLI\ngroup, the CFRP group, and the remainder group.\nFurthermore, the division between catastrophic and noncatastrophic collisions is the relative kinetic energy.\nHowever, the energy transfer during impact is unclear\nand energy actually used in fragmentation is unknown.\nThus, if possible, the measurement of the projectile\nvelocity after the penetration of the target satellite will\nbe useful to evaluate the impact energy.\n\nFigure 18 Area-to-Mass Ratio from Shot R\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
