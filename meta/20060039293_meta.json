The flight path was chosen to elucidate important structural, stratigraphic, and geomorphic features. The video, available  in VHS format, is a 360 second animation consisting of 10 800 total frames. The simulated velocity during three 120 second flight segments of the video is approximately 37 000 km per  hour, traversing approximately 1 000 km on the ground.", "title": "(abstract) Geological Tour of Southwestern Mexico", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060039293, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adams, Steven L."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "3a950f4c56d94857a3c06f9aac042984"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20060039293, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lang, Harold R."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "38e986e2b2594e7f9c2aab123d79640c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060039293, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/35776", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060039293, "id": "e45a0147ca0c404d8eceea5d57a127f9", "publicationDate": "1993-11-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
