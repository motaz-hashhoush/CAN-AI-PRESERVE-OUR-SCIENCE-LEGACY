The aircraft had provisions for 273 passengers arranged five abreast. The cruise Mach number was 2.62. The mission range for the AST-107 was 8.48 Mm (4576 n.mi.) and an average lift drag ratio of 9.15 during cruise was achieved. The available lateral control was not sufficient for the required 15.4 m/s (30 kt) crosswind landing condition, and a crosswind landing gear or a significant reduction in dihedral effect would be necessary to meet this requirement. The lowest computed noise levels, including a mechanical suppressor noise reduction of 3 EPNdB at the flyover and sideline monitoring stations, were 110.3 EPNdB (sideline noise), 113.1 EPNdB (centerline noise) and 110.5 EPNdB (approach noise).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800024834, "id": "d6fc05cc0f464d99874a03858f2c7747", "publicationDate": "1980-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800024834.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800024834/downloads/19800024834.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800024834/downloads/19800024834.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800024834/downloads/19800024834.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
