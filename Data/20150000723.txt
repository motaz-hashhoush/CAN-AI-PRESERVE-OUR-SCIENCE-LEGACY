Santer1*, C\xc3\xa9line Bon\xef\xac\x81ls1, Jeffrey F. Painter1, Mark D. Zelinka1, Carl Mears2,\nSusan Solomon3, Gavin A. Schmidt4, John C. Fyfe5, Jason N. S. Cole5, Larissa Nazarenko4,\nKarl E. Taylor1 and Frank J. Wentz2\nDespite continued growth in atmospheric levels of greenhouse\ngases, global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures\nhave shown slower warming since 1998 than previously1\xe2\x80\x935 .\nPossible explanations for the slow-down include internal\nclimate variability3,4,6,7 , external cooling in\xef\xac\x82uences1,2,4,8\xe2\x80\x9311 and\nobservational errors12,13 . Several recent modelling studies\nhave examined the contribution of early twenty-\xef\xac\x81rst-century\nvolcanic eruptions1,2,4,8 to the muted surface warming. Here we\npresent a detailed analysis of the impact of recent volcanic\nforcing on tropospheric temperature, based on observations\nas well as climate model simulations. We identify statistically\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant correlations between observations of stratospheric\naerosol optical depth and satellite-based estimates of both\ntropospheric temperature and short-wave \xef\xac\x82uxes at the top\nof the atmosphere. We show that climate model simulations\nwithout the effects of early twenty-\xef\xac\x81rst-century volcanic\neruptions overestimate the tropospheric warming observed\nsince 1998. In two simulations with more realistic volcanic\nin\xef\xac\x82uences following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, differences\nbetween simulated and observed tropospheric temperature\ntrends over the period 1998 to 2012 are up to 15% smaller, with\nlarge uncertainties in the magnitude of the effect. To reduce\nthese uncertainties, better observations of eruption-speci\xef\xac\x81c\nproperties of volcanic aerosols are needed, as well as improved\nrepresentation of these eruption-speci\xef\xac\x81c properties in climate\nmodel simulations.\nOur analysis uses satellite measurements of changes in the\ntemperature of the lower troposphere (TLT) made by Microwave\nSounding Units (MSU) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites13,14 . Satellite TLT\ndata have near-global, time-invariant spatial coverage; in contrast,\nglobal-mean trends estimated from surface thermometer records\ncan be biased by spatially and temporally non-random coverage\nchanges15 . We compare MSU TLT data with synthetic satellite\ntemperatures3 calculated from simulations performed under phase\n5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project16 (CMIP-5). These\nALL + 8.5 simulations include estimated historical (1850\xe2\x80\x932005) and\nfuture (2006\xe2\x80\x932100) changes in combined anthropogenic and natural\nexternal forcings (Supplementary Tables 1\xe2\x80\x933).\nAlthough our primary focus is on the recent \xe2\x80\x98warming hiatus\xe2\x80\x99,\nwe also examine volcanically induced changes in warming rate\nfollowing the eruptions of El Chich\xc3\xb3n (April 1982) and Pinatubo\n(June 1991). Both volcanic events increased stratospheric loadings\n\nof liquid-phase sulphate aerosols, leading to stratospheric warming\nand tropospheric cooling17\xe2\x80\x9319 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Stratospheric\ntemperature recovers within 1\xe2\x80\x932 years after El Chich\xc3\xb3n and\nPinatubo. As a result of the large thermal inertia of the ocean, the\nrecovery of tropospheric temperatures is slower (about 8\xe2\x80\x9310 years;\nrefs 20,21).\nTo analyse volcanic contributions to observed changes in\nwarming rates, it is useful to reduce the amplitude of internal\nnoise20\xe2\x80\x9322 . Our noise reduction strategy involves removing the\ntemperature signal of the El Ni\xc3\xb1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO),\na leading mode of internal climate variability. ENSO variability\nis characterized here by a commonly used index of sea surface\ntemperature changes in the eastern equatorial Pacific23 . We remove\nENSO e\xef\xac\x80ects from the satellite data and CMIP-5 simulations\nwith an iterative regression-based method, which accounts for\ncorrelation between the predictor variables used to estimate ENSO\nand volcano temperature signals (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 and\nSupplementary Methods)20,21 .\nRemoving ENSO markedly improves the agreement between the\nobserved and the model average temperature responses to major\nvolcanic eruptions (compare Fig. 1a with b). When both ENSO\nand volcano influences are subtracted, the model and observed\ntemperature residuals have very similar low-frequency changes up\nto the end of the twentieth century (Fig. 1c). After 1999, however, a\n\xe2\x80\x98warming hiatus\xe2\x80\x99 is still apparent in the observed residual TLT time\nseries, but the lower troposphere continues to warm in the CMIP-5\nmulti-model average.\nThis di\xef\xac\x80erence between modelled and observed warming trends\nmust be partly due to treatment of twenty-first-century volcanic\nforcing in the CMIP-5 ALL + 8.5 simulations1,2,4 . In the real world,\n17 \xe2\x80\x98small\xe2\x80\x99 eruptions occurred after 1999 (refs 1,24,25; Fig. 2a and\nSupplementary Table 4). The impact of each of these eruptions\non the estimated stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) is an\norder of magnitude smaller than that of Pinatubo (Supplementary\nFig. 4A). The cumulative e\xef\xac\x80ect of these successive twenty-firstcentury eruptions, however, was to increase global-mean SAOD by\n4%\xe2\x80\x937% annually from 2000\xe2\x80\x932009 (refs 1,24,25). This increase in\nSAOD is not included in any of the ALL + 8.5 simulations, which\nassume that SAOD decayed to background values or zero1,4 by the\nyear 2000.\nOver 50% of the larger twenty-first-century volcanic events\noccurred in the tropics24,25 (Fig. 2a). The largest eruptions seem to\nhave discernible signatures in satellite estimates of the tropical net\n\n1 Program\n\nfor Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, USA,\nSensing Systems, Santa Rosa, California 95401, USA, 3 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences,\nCambridge, Massachussets 02139, USA, 4 NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, New York 10025, USA, 5 Canadian Centre for Climate\nModelling and Analysis, Environment Canada, Victoria, British Columbia V8W 2Y2, Canada. *e-mail: santer1@llnl.gov\n2 Remote\n\nNATURE GEOSCIENCE | VOL 7 | MARCH 2014 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience\n\n\xc2\xa9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The\nSW signatures arise because volcanic aerosols reflect part of the\nincoming solar radiation back to space. The increase in tropical\nnet clear-sky SW radiation over January 2001\xe2\x80\x93December 2012 (by\nroughly 0.25 W m\xe2\x88\x922 per decade) is qualitatively consistent with the\nindependently estimated SAOD increase over this period.\nEven after statistical removal of ENSO e\xef\xac\x80ects, there is still\nconsiderable internal variability in tropical TLT (Fig. 2c). We\nperform two statistical tests to determine whether recent volcanic\neruptions have cooling signals that can be discriminated from this\nresidual variability. First, our \xe2\x80\x98individual eruption\xe2\x80\x99 tests (Fig. 3a)\nconsider whether there are statistically significant changes in\ntropical TLT after eight of the larger volcanic eruptions in a recently\ndeveloped observational SAOD data set24 . Significance is assessed by\ncomparing the estimated observed cooling signal of each eruption\nwith appropriate null distributions of TLT changes. These \xe2\x80\x98no\nvolcanic signal\xe2\x80\x99 distributions were obtained from 10,000 synthetic\nTLT time series generated by a lag-1 autoregressive statistical model\n(Supplementary Methods).\nFor Pinatubo, the cooling of the tropical lower troposphere is\nconsistently significant at the 1% level for all 12 sets of processing\nchoices (combinations of averaging period for estimating the preeruption temperature and post-eruption cooling). The tropical TLT\nsignals of Manam, Tavurvur and Nabro are significant at the 10%\nlevel or better, but only for certain combinations of processing\n186\n\nchoices. No averaging period choices explored here yield statistically\nsignificant cooling after Nevado del Ruiz, Kelut, Sarychev or Merapi.\nOur second test addresses the statistical significance of\ncorrelations between SAOD and \xe2\x80\x98ENSO removed\xe2\x80\x99 TLT data\n(Fig. 3b). As volcanic activity is inherently non-stationary, the\ncorrelation r{SAOD, TLT} between SAOD and TLT is sensitive to\nthe selected analysis period. We account for non-stationarity in\nr{SAOD, TLT} using a 60-month \xe2\x80\x98moving window\xe2\x80\x99 analysis. As in\nthe case of the cooling signals of individual eruptions, we assess the\nsignificance of r{SAOD, TLT} by generating null distributions of\nthis statistic (Supplementary Methods).\nThe most significant negative values of r{SAOD, TLT} occur\nduring 60-month periods that encompass the pronounced SAOD\nincrease and TLT decrease after Pinatubo (Fig. 3b). Moving\nwindows that sample the post-2004 SAOD and TLT changes also\nyield statistically significant r{SAOD, TLT} values (at the 10%\nlevel or better). Taken together, the results from our \xe2\x80\x98individual\neruption\xe2\x80\x99 and r{SAOD, TLT} tests suggest that internally generated\nvariability could plausibly explain some of the observed tropical TLT\nchanges after individual \xe2\x80\x98small\xe2\x80\x99 eruptions, but is less likely to explain\nthe observed synchronicity between multiple twenty-first-century\neruptions and multiple tropospheric cooling signals.\nWe also calculate r{SAOD, SW}, the contemporaneous\ncorrelations between overlapping 60-month segments of\nobservational SAOD and net clear-sky SW radiation time series.\nFor the tropical SAOD and SW changes in the early twenty-first\nNATURE GEOSCIENCE | VOL 7 | MARCH 2014 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience\n\n\xc2\xa9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our findings for near-global changes\nin SAOD, TLT and SW (Supplementary Fig. 5) are similar to those\nshown here for the tropics.\nTo better understand the contributions of late twentieth- and\nearly twenty-first-century volcanic forcing to global-scale changes\nin tropospheric warming rates, we calculate maximally overlapping\n10-year trends from the \xe2\x80\x98ENSO removed\xe2\x80\x99 TLT time series in Fig. 1b.\nThis simple smoothing procedure3 reveals that observed and model\naverage TLT changes are remarkably similar, both in phase and in\namplitude, for the first 20 years of the satellite record (Fig. 4). In\ncontrast, model 10-year TLT trends are larger than observed for\ntrends with start dates after 1993.\nThe twin trend maxima in Fig. 4 are related to the temperature\nresponses to El Chich\xc3\xb3n and Pinatubo. Each eruption is followed\nby a 13- to 14-month cooling phase until maximum monthly mean\ncooling ( Tmax ) is attained (Fig. 1b). Tropospheric warming during\nthe slow recovery from El Chich\xc3\xb3n and Pinatubo augments the\nmore gradual warming trend arising from human-caused increases\nin greenhouse gases. This is why 10-year TLT trends that begin\nclose to the time of Tmax have large positive values. These\nresults clearly show that El Chich\xc3\xb3n and Pinatubo had important\nimpacts on decadal changes in warming rates, despite statements to\nthe contrary27 .\nIt has been claimed that the recent divergence between modelled\nand observed temperature changes provides evidence that CMIP-5\nmodels are (on average) 2\xe2\x80\x933 times too sensitive to human-caused\nchanges in greenhouse gases28 . If this claim is correct, there is a\nserious error in present model-based estimates of the transient\n\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\nFirst year of 60-month moving window\n\nP-value\n\nYear\n\n1.0\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.8\nr{SAOD, TLT} and r{SAOD, SW}\n\nc\n\nTLT anomaly (\xc2\xb0C)\n\nb\n\nTOA SW\nanomaly (W m\xe2\x88\x922)\n\nEstimated\noptical depth\n\na\n\n0.0\n\nr{SAOD, TLT}\n(lag = 2 months; ENSO out)\n\nP-value for r{SAOD, TLT}\n(lag = 2 months)\n\nr{SAOD, SW} (no lag)\n\nP-value for r{SAOD, SW} (no lag)\n\nFigure 3 | Statistical signi\xef\xac\x81cance of observed tropical (20\xe2\x97\xa6 N\xe2\x80\x9320\xe2\x97\xa6 S)\nclimate signals after late twentieth- and early twenty-\xef\xac\x81rst-century\nvolcanic eruptions. a, Estimated observed changes in SAOD (ref. 24;\nSAOD ) and \xe2\x80\x98ENSO-removed\xe2\x80\x99 TLT (ref. 13; TLT ) after 8 individual\neruptions.

These were\nperformed with the GISS-E2-R and CanESM2 models developed at\nthe Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Canadian Centre for\nClimate Modelling and Analysis (respectively).\nAfter ENSO removal, the discrepancy between the observed\nTLT trends over 1998\xe2\x80\x932012 and the corresponding trends in the\nALL + Vol21c ensemble averages is reduced by 2\xe2\x80\x934% (GISS-E2-R)\nor by 11\xe2\x80\x9315% (CanESM2), depending on which observational data\nset is selected. These estimates vary because of model di\xef\xac\x80erences in:\nthe imposed post-Pinatubo SAOD changes, and whether SAOD is\nallowed to decay back to near-zero after Pinatubo (Supplementary\nFig. 4A); the decisions made in translating SAOD changes into\nvolcanic aerosol forcing; TCR and equilibrium climate sensitivity;\nthe amplitude and phase of internal climate variability; and the\ntreatment of other (non-volcanic) external forcings.\nBetter quantification of the contribution of recent volcanic\nforcing to the \xe2\x80\x98warming hiatus\xe2\x80\x99 will require new model simulations,\nand more detailed analysis of the seasonal and regional attributes\nof modelled and observed temperature changes. New simulations\nshould involve multiple models and volcanic forcing estimates,\nlarger ensemble sizes, and more detailed examination of the\nsensitivity to eruption-specific di\xef\xac\x80erences in the radiative\nproperties, horizontal and vertical dispersion, and size distributions\nof twenty-first-century volcanic aerosols.\nWe note that systematic forcing errors in CMIP-5 simulations\nof historical climate change are not confined to the treatment of\nvolcanic aerosols. Errors are also likely to exist in the treatment of\nrecent changes in solar irradiance9 , stratospheric water vapour10 ,\nstratospheric ozone29,30 and anthropogenic aerosols11 . Even a\nhypothetical \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 climate model, with perfect representation\nof all the important physics operating in the real-world climate\nsystem, will fail to capture the observed evolution of climate\nchange if key anthropogenic and natural forcings are neglected\nor inaccurately represented. It is not scientifically justifiable to\nclaim that model climate sensitivity errors are the only explanation\nfor di\xef\xac\x80erences between model and observed temperature trends.\nUnderstanding the causes of these di\xef\xac\x80erences will require more\nreliable quantification of the relative contributions from model\n188\n\nWe use observational TLT results from Remote Sensing Systems in California13\n(RSS; http://www.remss.com/data/msu/data) and the University of Alabama at\nHuntsville14 (UAH, http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu). Model TLT data are\nfrom ALL + 8.5 simulations performed with 28 di\xef\xac\x80erent CMIP-5 models\n(Supplementary Tables 1\xe2\x80\x933). Six of these models have multiple realizations of the\nALL + 8.5 simulation, yielding a total of 41 realizations of externally forced TLT\nchanges over 1979 to 2012. Model simulation output used in the calculation of\nsynthetic TLT information was downloaded from a portal of the Earth System\nGrid Federation (http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/). The statistical method used for\nremoving ENSO and volcano signals from modelled and observed tropospheric\ntemperature data is described in refs 20,21. Application of this approach requires\nan index characterizing ENSO variability. Here, the selected index was the spatial\naverage of sea surface temperature changes over the Ni\xc3\xb1o 3.4 region, which was\ncomputed from version 3b of the NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface\nTemperature data set23 (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov//ersst/#grid) and from the\nCMIP-5 ALL + 8.5 simulations. The SAOD data in Fig. 2a and 3 are an updated\nversion of information published in ref. 24. The Clouds and Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Radiant\nEnergy System (CERES) net clear-sky SW radiation data plotted in Fig. 2b are\navailable at http://ceres-tool.larc.nasa.gov/ord-tool/, and are documented in\nref. 26. All TLT results shown in the figures in the main text (except in Fig. 1a,\nwhich gives \xe2\x80\x98raw\xe2\x80\x99 TLT results) rely on TLT data from which ENSO-induced\nvariability was statistically removed with a volcanic signal decay time of \xcf\x84 = 40\nmonths. The Supplementary Methods provides a full description of: all\nobservational and model TLT data sets used here; the statistical method for\nremoving ENSO-induced TLT variability; the tests applied to assess the statistical\nsignificance of volcanically induced signals in observational TLT and SW data;\nand details of the CanESM2 and GISS-E2-R Vol21c simulations.\n\nReceived 29 November 2013; accepted 23 January 2014;\npublished online 23 February 2014\n\nReferences\n1.
