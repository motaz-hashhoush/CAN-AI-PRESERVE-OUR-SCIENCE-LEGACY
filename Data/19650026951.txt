The objectives of the study\nw e r e the synthesis of a conceptual design of a n unmanned spacecraft to perform\nscientific o r b i t e r - l a n d e r m i s s i o n s to Mars and Venus during planetary\nopportunities f r o m 1969 to 1975, and the formulation of a plan delineating the\ndevelopment p r o g r a m leading to first launch during the Mars 1969 opportunity.\n\nThe basic approach makes use of a 6000- to 7000-pound o r b i t e r - l a n d e r ;\ntradeoff studies w e r e conducted to determine the payload and m i s s i o n capabilities\nwith smaller and l a r g e r spacecraft. The o r b i t e r - l a n d e r was selected as yielding the maximum i n scientific value s h o r t of manned exploration. The lander\ns e p a r a t e s f r o m the o r b i t e r - b u s and descends to the planet surface by parachute,\nwhere it m a k e s atmospheric and surface m e a s u r e m e n t s and conducts a variety\nof scientific experiments. The information obtained is relayed to E a r t h via\nthe o r b i t e r - b u s which meanwhile is placed in a planetocentric orbit. The\no r b i t e r - b u s collects scientific d a t a in t r a n s i t and maps the planet while i n orbit.\nThe lifetime of both o r b i t e r - b u s and lander is 6 months f o r the M a r s m i s s i o n s ,\nF o r Venus, the o r b i t e r life i s a l s o 6 months, but the lander life is only 1 0 to\n20 h o u r s because of the hostile environment. A small capsule was designed\nf o r Venus, in addition to the lander, to conduct atmospheric m e a s u r e m e n t s\na f t e r entering f r o m o r b i t ; the capsule does not survive landing. Landers and\ncapsules would be s t e r i l i z e d to avoid contamination of the planets, but the\no r b i t e r - b u s would be placed on a t r a j e c t o r y which would ensure that it would\nr e m a i n above the sensible atmosphere f o r at l e a s t 50 y e a r s ; thus, no\nsterilization would be required. The development plan shows that to obtain\nthe scientific value d e s i r e d , two spacecraft should be scheduled for e a c h launch\nopportunity and hardware development should begin in 1964 to m e e t the 1969\nlaunch date for Mars.\n\n-1-\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTiON\n\nThe development plan f o r the Voyager P r o g r a m is presented i n detail\nh e r e i n in t h r e e sections. Section I d e s c r i b e s the m a j o r subsystem and d i s c i pline efforts and briefly indicates the Development P r o g r a m involved. No\nattempt h a s been made a t this time to expand i n detail all facets of each m a j o r\nsubsystem development. Identification of the m a j o r facilities and special t e s t\nequipment requirements, the major subcontracted i t e m s , the long lead i t e m s\nas well a8 a list of proposed Government-furnished equipment a r e included.\nThe m a j o r problem a r e a s a r e briefly discussed. A hardware s u m m a r y list,\nindicating the hardware requirements f r o m the development phase to the\noperational units for each launch window, is a l s o included.\nSection I1 contains the schedules developed for the program. The r e c o m mended p r o g r a m a w a r d s a hardware contract i n the second q u a r t e r of fiscal\n1965 for a first operational launch during the M a r s 1969 launch window. A\nshortened schedule is presented f o r this launch opportunity showing p r o g r a m\ns t a r t at the beginning of fiscal 1966. The m a j o r penalty f o r compressing the\nschedule by 9 months r e s u l t s f r o m a g r e a t e r overlap between the various development t e s t p r o g r a m s , the qualification t e s t p r o g r a m , and the manufacturing cycle. Modifications necessitated by the t e s t p r o g r a m r e s u l t s will be\nfactored into the vehicle when it is well along in i t s manufacture, Any extensive modification will become difficult and expensive to accommodate a t this\npoint.\nSection 111 contains the cost s u m m a r i e s for the program.\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n2. DEVELOPMENT PROCRAM\n\nThis section d i s c u s s e s the major subsystem development efforts f r o m\nwhich the development and hardware c o s t s and schedules w e r e derived.\n\n2 . 1 Subsystem Development P l a n\n\n1.

P e r f o r m a n c e Control. P r o g r a m performance is m e a s u r e d\nand controlled on the basis of established schedules, performance control\nm a t r i x e s , and PERT networks reflecting i n detail those t a s k s as defined in\nthe Development Plan.\nThroughout the Development P r o g r a m , aforementioned performance cont r o l m a t r i x e s provide engineering management with a m a s t e r s u m m a r y of\nengineering controls and reporting techniques required to e n s u r e timely and\nadequate performance. Table 1 shows a typical matrix. Task numbers a r e\nassigned a t the time the requirement for development of a product is identified.\nThese task numbers a r e used through the accounting system to monitor c o s t s\nand performance throughout the program. Feedback into the appropriate\nPERT-Companion Cost network is automatic.\nC e r t a i n columns under "development t e s t " (equipment, manpower, c o s t )\nc a n be superimposed on any aspect of the Development P r o g r a m .\nAssignments of appropriate control numbers (drawings, specifications,\ne t c . , and schedule datesprovide management with a simple, effective tool of\nc e n t r a l source control for each subsystem and component of the program.\nThese m a t r i x e s a r e then published through a n engineering development\nhandbook which i s used a s the singular r e f e r e n c e (of a comprehensive, yet\nconcise and a c c u r a t e , picture) of all significant a s p e c t s of the program.\nControl plans will be developed in a r e a s of Configuration, Interface,\nWeight and Balance, Manufacturing, Quality Control, Launch Support, Communications, and Documentation.\nb.\n\nRe s o u r c e s Control.

System studies will be required to\n2.\np e r f o r m overall system tradeoffs t o optimize the p e r f o r m a n c e of the spacecraft\ni n attaining the p r o g r a m objectives. The translation of overall p r o g r a m objectives into the various subsystem requirements is accomplished by the s y s t e m s engineering staff. Systems analyses a r e r e q u i r e d to determine the payload and t r a j e c t o r y p a r a m e t e r s for the optimum mission. The development of\nthe m i s s i o n profile and factory-to-launch sequence of events and the associated,\nanticipated environmental conditions a r e keyed to the m i s s i o n objectives and\noptimum m i s s i o n design. Data requirements for the scientific and engineering\nm i s s i o n objectives will be established and coordinated.\nInterdisciplinary analysis and system synthesis integrating the design eff o r t of the various specialists must be emphasized throughout the p r o g r a m to\nproduce a balanced design accommodating a s many a s possible of the r e q u i r e ments, Integration of the various subsystems through establishment and maintenance of interface controls will ensure e l e c t r i c a l and mechanical compatibility\nof the various elements within the spacecraft a s well a s the overall l a n d e r o r b i t e r and spacecraft-booster interfaces. The interface between the Government -furnished scientific instrumentation and the spac e c r a f t data c onditioning ,\ncommunications, power source, and c e n t r a l computer and sequencer equipment\nwill p r e s e n t particularly difficult problems, since the instrumentation design\nwill, in a l l probability, r e m a i n fluid until late in the program. Interface control\nwill be established through coordinated mechanical and e l e c t r i c a l interface cont r o l drawings and specifications. Mechanical interface control will be maintained through m a s t e r templates and electrical interface control and testing will r e q u i r e development of e l e c t r i c a l sirnuiators for each subsystem involved i n the\ninterface. Detailed i n t e r f a c e testing will be required to demonstrate the compatibility of e a c h interface.\nParticipation in the design reviews and a l l phases of overall s y s t e m s testing\ni s e s s e n t i a l in maintaining cognizance of the s y s t e m performance and to effect the\nm o s t meaningful solutions to designproblems. Weight analyses a r e very i m p o r t a n t inattaining a n optimum balance betweenperformance and reliability of the various\nsubsystems. Configuration control is maintained through the s y s t e m s engineering\norganization. Close liaisonwill be maintained with customer and field personnel to\np r e p a r e for and execute successful flight operations of the Voyager spacecraft.\n\n-6\n\n-\n\n3.\nReliability and quality assurance. In performing unique engineering\nand scientific t a s k s , Voyager spacecraft and t h e i r highly complex subsystems\nwill be faced with a v a r i e t y of potential reliability problems. Long term, f r e quently cycled operation and storage in hostile and poorly defined environments\np r e s e n t problems which m u s t be solved t o a s s u r e a high probability of m i s s i o n\ns u c c e s s . The reliability burden is further aggravated by the f a c t that only few\ns p a c e c r a f t will be built t o be used during the limited number of favorable launch\nopportunities. Since the cost p e r launch is extraordinarily high, it is both technically and economically mandatory that a full-scale, dynamic reliability p r o g r a m be implemented to a s s u r e the n e c e s s a r y s p a c e c r a f t m i s s i o n reliability.\n\nThe relative magnitude of the reliability effort, a s compared to the total\np r o g r a m effort, is a function of the type of equipment to be delivered. F o r a\nmaintainable, ground-based r a d a r o r a i r c r a f t system, a nominal reliability effort,\nfunded at 5 t o 10 percent of the total program costs, would be sufficient since\nr e p a i r s and preventive maintenance could be employed t o p r e s e r v e t h e i r o p e r a .\ntional readiness. However, the preservation of operational reliability through\nmaintenance i s not relevant in the case of the nonrepairable interplanetary probe,\nVoyager. F u r t h e r m o r e , since the reliability of the booster i s a s e v e r e constraint\nto the s u c c e s s of the mission, the reliability of the Voyager spacecraft m u s t be\nn e c e s s a r i l y higher. To a s s u r e this high level of spacecraft reliability, a dynamic reliability p r o g r a m i s essential.\nThe p r i m a r y emphasis in the Voyager p r o g r a m will be on designing high\nreliability into the spacecraft and maintaining this level of reliability during the\nproduction phase. Since a limited number of spacecraft will be built, their fabrication will be m o r e associated with a model shop operation than a high-volume\nproduction facility. Meticulous attention t o detail will be an overriding concern\nthroughout. Reliability p r o g r e s s will be monitored in vendor / subcontractor\nliaison and a continuing effort maintained throughout the program.\nAn ambitious reliability p r o g r a m for subcontractors and vendors m u s t be\nimposed to a s s u r e that reliability objectives a r e not compromised. Subcont r a c t o r and vendor reliability efforts will be funded separately on reliability\ncontracts o r reliability requirement clauses. These funds will be apportioned\nout of the reliability p r o g r a m funds. Separate reliability contracts o r c l a u s e s\nwill not only mean specifying reliability r e q u i r e m e n t s , but a l s o providing a\nrigorous monitoring e f f o r t to enforce these requirements through incentives and\nr------.uY. -7- - , i l v i i ; l o i l ~ ~ dspecrs oi tne p r o g r a m will be provided through a\nnc.n?lt:*r\ng\ncarefully conducted audit and surveillance of the subcontractor /vendor efforts,\nr e s i d e n t reliability engineers, a s well a s requirements for r e p o r t s submission.\n*llFi\n\nThe technical function will involve such important activities a s reliability\nengineering, t e s t engineering, and data functions. The reliability engineering\nactivity will be responsible for subsystem reliability allocations, design reviews,\nand reliability a p p r a i s a l s . The t e s t engineering activity will be responsible for\n\n-7\n\n-\n\nthe evaluation of all test p r o g r a m s , both in-house and in the field. This r e sponsibility will include t e s t planning, t e s t monitoring, and l a b o r a t o r y a n a l y s i s\nof failures. Data functions will be conducted for both reliability engineering\nand t e s t engineering activities. A particularly important data activity w i l l b e\nthat of tabulating and reducing data reported f r o m the v a r i o u s t e s t p r o g r a m s .\nThese d a t a w i l l then be analyzed by the reliability engineering activity t o initiate\nreliability improvements, thus completing the c o r r e c t i v e action loop. The\nabove technical functions will be maintained throughout the Voyager P r o g r a m .\nThe complete reliability development plan is d e s c r i b e d i n table 2.\nThe reliability a s s u r a n c e philosophy recommended for the Voyager P r o g r a m i s founded upon t h r e e essential precepts.\n\na.\nDirect and unimpeded a c c e s s to top management.

The n e c e s s a r y policies and p r o c e d u r e s and the careful selection of qualified personnel to anticipate, detect,\nrectify, and follow up existing and potential reliability p r o b l e m s in the s y s t e m\ndesign and operational hardware such that even the m o s t minute a s p e c t s a r e\ngiven adequate attention.\nExhaustive testing.

T h e s e controls provide for adequate planning, influence of the design, complete testing evaluation, quality manufacture of s y s t e m\nh a r d w a r e , fastidious launch site preparation of operational equipment, and,\nabove all, a dynamic m e a n s to achieve reliability improvements through e a r l y\np r o b l e m identification and meaningful c o r r e c t i v e action.\nVolume 3 - Systems Analvsis, contains the r e s u l t s of the reliability a n a l y s i s\nconducted during this stxdy, m d s h o w s the p r q m s e d level of testing which\nwould be r e q u i r e d t o demonstrate the achievement of the reliability goals assigned to each subsystem. This analysis would be c a r r i e d out in g r e a t e r detail\nand continued for the duration of the p r o g r a m to obtain the m o s t r e a i i s t i c r e l i ability goals, and a l s o to r e c o r d p r o g r e s s i n achieving t h e s e goals. The design\nof each subsystem would be reviewed on a continuing b a s i s , and the r e s u l t s of\ndevelopment, reliability, and environmental testing would b e reviewed a t all\nstages. Reliability would recommend design changes, such a s the incorporation\nof redundancy, to m e e t the d e s i r e d reliability goals.\n-8-\n\nf\n-9-\n\n.\n-10-\n\n1:\nl\n\nl\n\n4.\nSpacecraft design. The spacecraft design effort embodies t h e m e chanical and e l e c t r i c a l integration of all spacecraft subsystems into a coherent\no v e r a l l design for t h e Voyager spacecraft. Detail design considerations will\ninvolve the booster -spacecraft and orbiter-lander separation s y s t e m r e q u i r e m e n t s and the lander erection and electromechanical deployment system. The\neffort n e c e s s a r y for preparing the complete design definition of the spacecraft\nr e q u i r e s layout drawings, detail production drawings, and subsystem component and p r o c e s s specifications. Mockups and full-scale models will be built\nto facilitate internal packaging design. Prototype o r development models of\neach spacecraft configuration a r e required to e n s u r e proper operation of each\nsubsystem, and to facilitate integration of the science payload.\n\nA detailed Development P r o g r a m will be r e q u i r e d for m a t e r i a l s , components, and subsystems of the electromechanical devices outlined above. F a c\nt o r y and field liaison w i l l be provided during the manufacturing, assembly,\nacceptance t e s t , sterilization, and operational portions of the p r o g r a m .\n\n-\n\n5.\nStructural development. The s t r u c t u r a l development p r o g r a m c o n s i s t s\nof an analytical and s t r u c t u r a l t e s t effort r e q u i r e d to p e r f o r m a design optimization study of the o r b i t e r - b u s and lander s t r u c t u r e and to substantiate the s t r u c t u r d integrity of the final design. During the initial design phase, p r e l i m i n a r y\naerodynamic and thermodynamic environments a r e used in conjuction with design and environmental c r i t e r i a dictated by the ascent, s p a c e flight, and\nplanetary entry conditions to obtain the applied load history t o be sustained\nby the s t r u c t u r e . S t r e s s analyses a r e p e r f o r m e d to optimize the selection of\nm a t e r i a l s and element sizes. Complementing the analytical effort, a s t r u c t u r a l\ndevelopment t e s t p r o g r a m i s conducted i n which any complex s t r u c t u r a l conducted to substantiate the applicability of the optimized s t r u c t u r e to the f a b r i c a tion techniques proposed.\n\nDuring the final design phase, an extensive detailed analytical effort i s\nr e q u i r e d t o design a minimum weight s t r u c t u r e considering the detailed a e r o t h e r\nmoelastic problems. Extensive full-scale testing is necessitated by the difficulty in projecting the s t r u c t u r a l behavior of the spacecraft under complex\nloading conditions. T e s t s and detailed analysis w i l l include the t i m e sequencing\nof the ascent, space flight, and entry environments. Test facilities for s i m u l taneous simulation of the aerothermoelastic environments do not exist in the\nUnited States f o r vehicles of this size and weight. Development of non-existent\nt e s t facilities will take place during the spacecraft design development phase so\nthat the full-scale s t r u c t u r a l proof tests can he combined with the detailed a n a l y t i c a l effort to provide the assurance of a structurally sound final design.\n\n6 . Aerodynamics development. To e s t a b l i s h the optimum aerodynamic\nconfiguration that w i l l fullfil1 the overall s y s t e m objectives, i t i s n e c e s s a r y to\nconduct studies to determine vehicle t r a j e c t o r i e s , vehicle f o r c e and moment\ncoefficients, static and dynamic stability, p r e s s u r e distributions, convective\n-1 2 -\n\nI\n\n.\n\n-\n\nand radiative heating, and i n e r t i a l and air loads as well as vehicle shape. The\ngoverning p a r a m e t e r s i n the above studies a r e associated with the planetary\natmospheres. A vehicle configuration and design of high confidence and reliability will r e q u i r e extensive analyses investigating the influence of all possible\na t m o s p h e r i c models. These studies will be modified as data on the planetary\na t m o s p h e r e s become available f r o m such s o u r c e s as M a r i n e r B data.\nThe o v e r a l l s y s t e m s design influences the selection of aerodynamic configurations f o r these p a r t i c u l a r vehicles. Most significant of t h e s e are (a) m a x i mum electronics package weight, (b) r e l i a b l e descent and i m p a c t attenuation\ns y s t e m weight and performance, and (c) static and dynamic stability.\nF o r detailed design analysis requirements, a complete definition of a e r o d y namic coefficients as a function of Mach number and angle of attack will be\nobtained a s well as the variation with g a s composition. This i s n e c e s s a r y to\ne n s u r e adequate static and dynamic stability as well as to determine the r e q u i r e d design conditions f r o m t r a j e c t o r y analyses.\nEntry t r a j e c t o r y a n a l y s e s will be performed t o obtain the n e c e s s a r y environmental conditions. Three-degree-of -freedom t r a j e c t o r i e s will be obtained\nt o establish the altitude-descent h i s t o r i e s f o r the various a t m o s p h e r e s to be\nconsidered. A dynamic analysis i s n e c e s s a r y to establish the stability and\nangle of attack envelope. The necessity of a six-degree-of -freedom analysis\nwill be investigated and p e r f o r m e d if n e c e s s a r y t o obtain detailed variations\ni n dynamic p r e s s u r e and altitude histories. T h e s e a n a l y s e s will e s t a b l i s h the\ndesign c r i t e r i a f o r determining loads, heating, and angle of attack effects.\nThe c r i t e r i a for a r e l i a b l e descent s y s t e m will b e obtained and, in addition,\ne r r o r analyses will b e p e r f o r m e d to establish the descent s y s t e m design.\nP r e s s u r e distributions and loads will b e initially evaluated by the method\nof c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s utilizing effective r a t i o s of specific heats to account f o r the\nvariations due to g a s composition. This and other assumptions i n the p r e l i m i n a r y design phase m u s t b e corroborated by t e s t p r o g r a m s .\nThe heating evaluation will be done by existing techniques and c o r r e l a t i o n s\nsupplemented by t e s t data as they become available. The t r a j e c t o r y analyses,\nespecially the dynamic angle of attack effects, will be used to a s c e r t a i n the\ndesign heating pulse, both radiative and convective. Flow -field analysis will\nb e r e q u i r e d to establish the heating effects at angle of attack and to d e t e r m i n e\nne p r a a a u r e ;iaLrii)uiiunti arid iuadu.\n\nA wind tunnel test p r o g r a m will markedly influence the determination of\nthe aerodynamic coefficients. The subsonic t e s t p r o g r a m can be c a r r i e d out\ni n any of the continuous s e p a r a t e d wind tunnels such as AEDC tunnel A o r the\nJPL 20-inch facility, Testing at Mach n u m b e r s f r o m 6 to 10 r e q u i r e s u s e of\nt h e AEDC tunnels B and C o r the JPL facility.

As wind tunnel t e s t data become\nbe factored into the design.\n\navailable, the r e s u l t s will\n\n7\n. Heat shield development. The heat shield development p r o g r a m will\ninvolve design, test,and evaluation of the M a r s and Venus heat shields. Prelim i n a r y t h e r m a l design evaluations w i l l be conducted to select a suitable heat\nshield m a t e r i a l and to s i z e t h e lander heat shield and s t r u c t u r e . The initial\ndesign effort generally utilizes preliminary environmental e s t i m a t e s and mat e r i a l p r o p e r t i e s . F u r t h e r refinements i n the aerodynamic heating and m a t e r i a l\np r o p e r t y behavior under simulated M a r s and Venus e n t r y environments will lead\nto an i n c r e a s e i n heat shield design confidence. A n e a r exact analytical ablation\nmodel will be used together with computer approximation techniques t o a r r i v e\nat the r e q u i r e d solutions. Material p r o p e r t y inputs required for the analytical\nmodels will come f r o m a s e r i e s of basic tests. These t e s t s include (a) convective heat f l u x t e s t s , (b) radiant heat flux tests, (c) combined convectiveradiant heat f l u t e s t s , (d) s o l a r furnace t e s t s , (e) t h e r m a l conductivity,\nt h e r m a l expansion, and specific heat t e s t s , and (f) t h e r m o g r a v i m e t r i c analysis\n(TGA) and differential t h e r m a l analysis (DTA). Candidate m a t e r i a l s will be\ns c r e e n e d i n both convective and radiant energy a r c facilities, using the Apollo\nablator as the r e f e r e n c e material. Selected m a t e r i a l s will then b e evaluated\nunder simulated M a r s and Venus entry conditions, using all suitable heating\nfacilities, including the combined convective-radiant heat flux a r c s . T h e r m a l\np r o p e r t i e s and densities of t h e s e candidate materials will be obtained. The\nkinetics and mode of degradation will be determined with TGA and DTA tests.\nThe following s e r i e s of major mechanical and chemical t e s t s will be p e r f o r m e d (a) tensile and compressive strength, modulus, and elongation v e r s u s\nt e m p e r a t u r e and s t r a i n rate, (b) bond strength v e r s u s t e m p e r a t u r e and t e s t rate,\nand (c) chemical analysis of candidate m a t e r i a l s and their products of degradation. B a s i c tensile and bond properties will be obtained a t selected t e m p e r a t u r e s and s t r a i n r a t e s for all candidate m a t e r i a l s , Selected materials will\nb e completely evaluated f o r mechanical and chemical properties. T e s t conditions will b e determined by ground, launch, in-flight, and entry conditions.\nT h e s e p r o p e r t i e s will be engineering data upon which a design f r e e z e can\nb e based.\nAfter the p r e s c r e e n i n g t e s t , environmental t e s t s will be conducted on\ncandidate m a t e r i a l s . These t e s t s will include (a) high-vacuum exposure\ntorr), (b) t e m p e r a t u r e cycles, including cold soak, (c) solar irradiation,\n(d) combined high-vacuum and solar irradiation, (e) heat soak-sterilization\nconditions, ff\\ effect of humiditv and t h e r m a l aging, and (e;) shock and vibration.\nThe effect of t h e s e environmental conditions will b e evaluated by thermal,\nablative, mechanical, and chemical t e s t s . L a r g e - s c a l e testing will b e conducted on panels and mockups by evaluating s t r u c t u r a l integrity, weight change,\ns t r e s s and s t r a i n levels, and visual changes i n the heat shield.\n\n-14-\n\n8.\nT h e r m a l control subsystem development. Initial s y s t e m s studies will\nestablish the type and extent of t h e r m a l control r e q u i r e d for t h e Voyager o r b i t e r\nand lander f o r both M a r s and Venus missions. The initial study will consider\nboth active and passive t h e r m a l control. Both e x t e r n a l and i n t e r n a l variable\nt h e r m a l loads will be considered in the p r e l i m i n a r y and detail designs. The\nrecommended t h e r m a l control system will b e developed and evaluated analytically\nthrough digital computation techniques considering m i s s i o n reliability r e q u i r e\nments as design objectives. Initial s u b s y s t e m developmental testing will be\np e r f o r m e d to establish g e n e r a l design c r i t e r i a , such a s coating degradation, component t h e r m a l dissipation and load paths, duty cycle t r a n s i e n t s , and m i s s i o n\nmidcourse maneuver effects.\n\n-\n\nSubstantiation of analytical r e s u l t s will b e accomplished through experiment a l t h e r m a l vacuum testing under simulated flight conditions with the appropriate\ncomplement of subsystems in operation. Detail problem a r e a s will r e q u i r e f u r t h e r investigation with possible redesign as a r e s u l t of the t h e r m a l t e s t program.\nA continuing review of t h e r m a l capabilities of all s u b s y s t e m s will e n s u r e the\nsuccessful operation of the Voyager spacecraft and lander under widely diver\ngent conditions experienced during exploration of the two t a r g e t planets.\n\n-\n\n9. Communication subsystem development. A p r e l i m i n a r y design effort\nwill be conducted to determine the r e q u i r e m e n t s of the communications s y s t e m\nconsidering the demands of the desired scientific mission, the available weight,\nthe r e q u i r e d operation life, t h e r m a l environment power available, and the s t e r i lization constraint. F r o m the system r e q u i r e m e n t s , detailed specifications will\nb e generated f o r all subsystems.\nA supplier will b e selected f o r each of the subsystems based on experience\nwith similar equipment for long-duration, high-reliability space p r o g r a m s , conf o r m a n c e to the p r o g r a m schedule requirements, cost, and reporting practice.\nDuring the subsystem design period, a n intimate relationship will be maintained\nwithin the subcontractor to e n s u r e proper exposure of problem a r e a s and schedule slippages.\nPrototype models of all subcontracted i t e m s will be subjected to a s e r i e s of\ndevelopment t e s t s both a t the vendor s i t e and a t the p r i m e c o n t r a c t o r s facility.\nT h e s e tests will include (a) bench testing t o determine the conformance to t h e\ne l e c t r i c a l specifications, (b) R F I testing, and ( c ) de sign d s t z cn-;i;ullxleriLai testing.\nModifications will b e incorporated i n any a r e a s where the t e s t i t e m fails\nto m e e t the specification requirement. Upon completion of the s u b s y s t e m development cycle\xe2\x80\x99 a communication system prototype w i l l be fabricated and subj e c t e d to the e l e c t r i c a l bench testing, environmental testing, and R F I testing.\nA prototype of the data conditioning system will be constructed and utilized a s\na compatibility mockup for scientific instruments.\n\n-15-\n\nDuring the manufacturing and a s s e m b l y phase, engineering p e r sca-n-el will\nbe assigned to a c t in a consultory capacity f o r inspection, a s s e m b l y , and t e s t\npersonnel. In addition, liaison will be maintained with field personnel to allow\nrapid resolution of p r o b l e m s arising in the communications s y s t e m a t the launch site.\n10. Power s o u r c e s development. An RTG h a s been selected as the power\ns o u r c e for the M a r s lander. The power presently considered to offer the optim u m match between weight, mission effectiveness, and t h e r m a l limitations i s\n110 watts.\n\nA fundamental consideration with a n RTG is that of isotope selection. Because of the longlead time involved, an e a r l y r e q u e s t must be made to NASA\nf o r AEC commitment of a sufficient quantity of the Pu-238 fuel. Also, e a r l y in\nthe p r o g r a m (within 3 months), the physical configuration of the generator will\nb e established by t h e r m a l and spacecraft constraints, and the subcontractor will\nbe selected for development of the thermoelectric elements.\nF u e l safety c r i t e r i a , a shielding analysis, ground-handling techniques, and\nt e s t p r o c e d u r e s w i l l be established and, since the capsule will be of the intact\nr e e n t r y design, modes of entry, impact and the resulting s t r e s s e s will be s p e c ified so that a suitable fuel capsule m a y be developed. F u e l capsule t e s t s will\ninclude impact, f i r e , explosion, and simulated entry.\nThroughout the e n t i r e p r o g r a m , c l o s e liaison will be maintained with the\nsubcontractor. Life testing of t h e selected conversion m a t e r i a l under simulated condition will r e q u i r e 1 full year. This will not significantly r e t a r d the\ndevelopment schedule as i t s e r v e s only to establish the n e c e s s a r y confidence i n\nthe material. Concurrently, other elements will b e used in the t h e r m a l mockup\nof the generator. F i n a l generator design w i l l follow.\nIt is expected that the fuel will be delivered about 2 y e a r s after commitment\n(which will be about 18 months before launch). This will allow sufficient t i m e t o\ncomplete functional, environmental, life, and quality testing such that the final\nflight proof a r t i c l e is available a t l e a s t 1 year before launch.\nThe p r i m a r y power s o u r c e f o r both the M a r s and Venus o r b i t e r s c o n s i s t s\nof s o l a r panels with b a t t e r i e s as the secondary source. Development models\nof the e n t i r e solar panel will be constructed. The resulting panels will be submitted to extensive l a b o r a t o r y testing t o e n s u r e conformance to the r e q u i r e m e n t s\nof the detailed specifications and performance c r i t e r i a . T h e r m a l vacuum t e s t s\nwili b e conducted to establish the adequacy of t h e s n l z r yanp.1 .\'e_cl,-z i s:ppl;-n\ning the power needs of the n r b i t e r vehicles.\n11. Mapping subsystem development. During the p r e l i m i n a r y design phase\nof the Deveiopment P r o g r a m , a thorough analysis of the m i s s i o n concept f o r both\nM a r s and Venus launches will be conducted, including studies to determine the\no r b i t s achievable for all opportunities, the communications capability available,\n-16-\n\nand the exact scientific objectives desired. F r o m these studies the r e q u i r e m e n t s\nfor an optical mapping s y s t e m and a microwave mapping s y s t e m will be g e n e r ated. Subcontractors with demonstrated capability in the subject fields will be\nselected by competitive bidding, During the development phase, extensive t e s t ing of the mapping equipments w i l l be conducted at the subcontract agency, at\nthe p r i m e c o n t r a c t o r \' s facility, and possibly flyby t e s t s at a field site. The\nlaboratory testing w i l l include thorough examination of the e l e c t r i c a l and optical\nperformance of the television mapping system, complete e l e c t r i c a l performance\ntesting of the microwave mapping system including antenna p a t t e r n m e a s u r e ments, and environmental testing of all mapping subsystems.\nDuring the fabrication assembly and testing phases, close liaison will be\nmaintained between the design engineers and manufacturing personnel t o e l i m i nate problems associated with improper understanding of the mechanisms of\noperation of the systems.\n12. Guidance and stabilization control s y s t e m development. The development of the guidance and control systems w i l l center on two predominant a r e a s .\nThe f i r s t i s the long mission life, and the effect this has on reliability. The\ncomponents used for the s y s t e m must undergo rigorous environmental and life\ntesting to e n s u r e that they will operate for the time required. This imposes\nthe most c r i t i c a l demands on the gyros, the cold g a s reaction controls, and the\ncomputers. Although the gyros selected a r e a i r - b e a r i n g gyros, and a r e e x pected to have the reliability and lifetime required without major redesign, the\nd e s i r e d level of confidence in this performance w i l l r e q u i r e testing. The s e lection of a cold g a s reaction system w i l l r e q u i r e the l e a s t amount of development work because of the advanced state of development of t h e s e systems.\nInitially, a p a r a l l e l development of an a l t e r n a t e technique w i l l be pursued, either\nhypergolic hot gas o r sublimating low-pressure j e t s , to e n s u r e a backup capability if l a t e r knowledge of micrometeroid and other torque-producing effects\nr e s u l t s i n excessive growth in the weight of the cold g a s system. The comp u t e r s in both lander and orbiter-bus p r e s e n t a reliability problem simply b e cause of their l a r g e n u m b e r s of components. Existing computers do not m e e t\nthe total r e q u i r e m e n t s of the system, and must be developed, although it is\npossible that existing computers can be adapted to the needs of the orbiter-bus.\nThe computer in each c a s e w i l l have to be developed to handle the l a r g e number\nof programming and sequencing functions.\nIn addition to the development required to achieve reliability with existing\no r n e a r l y existing components, entirely new components a r e r e q u i r e d t o m e e t\np e r f o r m a n c e requirements. This is particularly t r u e of two of the on-board\noptical s e n s o r s , the planet t r a c k e r , and the horizon scanner. The planet t r a c k e r\nis r e q u i r e d t o determine range f r o m the planet and r e p r e s e n t s a major component development. Since many of its f e a t u r e s a r e s i m i l a r t o those of the\noptical mapping system, t h e s e efforts will b e conducted in close collaboration.\nThe possibility of a single instrument meeting both requirements will be vigorously pursued. The horizon sensor is an important development a r e a not only\n-17\'-\n\nbecause of its effect on a c c u r a c y of on-board position m e a s u r e m e n t s , but also\nbecause of its u s e in positioning the planet-oriented mapping instruments. The\nexisting s e n s o r s f o r E a r t h a r e not directly suited f o r M a r s , and t h o s e i n development f o r M a r s m a y not achieve the a c c u r a c y and lifetime r e q u i r e d f o r Voyager.\nDetailed s y s t e m analyses w i l l be p e r f o r m e d to d e t e r m i n e performance r e q u i r e m e n t s of all components. These r e s u l t s w i l l be modified and integrated to\nmeet t o t a l s y s t e m s r e q u i r e m e n t s , and will b e used to develop detailed component specifications and subsystem performance specifications.\nSubcontractors will be selected for each of the m a j o r s u b s y s t e m s o r c o m ponents t o p e r f o r m the development and manufacture. Component testing to\ndetailed specifications will be performed by the subcontractor. Engineering\nmodels will be delivered to the p r i m e contractor f o r incorporation in s u b s y s t e m\nand s y s t e m testing. Subcontractors will p e r f o r m reliability, quality a s s u r a n c e ,\nand acceptance testing on t h e i r components. These t e s t s will b e repeated on the\ns u b s y s t e m level a t the p r i m e contractor\'s facility.\nSingle-axis testing of the reaction-control s y s t e m will be conducted using\na one-degree-of -freedom table and complete s y s t e m simulation will be performed\non a t h r e e - a x i s flight simulator connected to an analog computer. The three-axis,\na i r - b e a r i n g table will b e used for f i n a l s y s t e m t e s t s , and to simulate the long\nm i s s i o n endurance r e q u i r e m e n t s of the control system. This will b e combined\nwith a c e l e s t i a l simulator so that closed-loop p e r f o r m a n c e of the optical s e n s o r s\ncan be coupled with t h e reaction control system.\nP a r t i c u l a r emphasis will be given to the analysis of r e s u l t s f r o m Mariner\nflights. If the r e s u l t s indicate attitude control s y s t e m demands g r e a t e r than\nthose estimated due to s o l a r p r e s s u r e , m i c r o m e t e r o i d s , and other effects, the\ne m p h a s i s on alternate techniques will b e increased.\nClose liaison will b e maintained with the propulsion subcontractor, since\nthe attitude control s y s t e m used for t h r u s t vector control i s an integral p a r t of\nthe propulsion s y s t e m , but i s controlled by the guidance and control s y s t e m\ne l e c t r o n i c s and logic.\n1 3 . Propulsion s u b s y s t e m development. The Voyager propulsion p r o g r a m\nwill entail the design, development, qualification, and delivery of a Voyager\no r b i t e r propulsion system, and a Mars lander, and Venus capsule propulsion\nE y E t em..\n\nThe f i r s t 2 months of the design will include a review of all commercially\navailable h a r d w a r e p r i o r to starting component fabrication a n d / o r procurement.\nThe fir s t 6 months will be utilized in analysis and generating component\ndesign drawings, manufacturing design drawings, l a b o r a t o r y t e s t specifications, fabrication p r o c e d u r e s , and vendor specifications. Reliability s t a t i s t i c a l\n\n- 18-\n\ntesting will be s t r e s s e d throughout the program. L a b o r a t o r y and injector\nhot-firing tests for Voyager component s y s t e m development will commence dur\ning the latter half of the first year. Component testing w i l l include a s e p a r a t e\nt e s t p r o g r a m for each m a j o r component t o determine reliability and possible\np e r f o r m a n c e gains. Specific t e s t s w i l l be conducted on t h r u s t c h a m b e r s , valves,\nand i n j e c t o r s to determine operating c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and for p e r f o r m a n c e evaluation. Tank diaphragm testing will be conducted for verification of expulsion\nefficiency. Nearly all of the component testing w i l l b e accomplished at the p r o pulsion subcontractor\'s facilities. Testing at vendor facilities (chosen by the\npropulsion subcontractor) will b e n e c e s s a r y to accomplish all of of t h e environmental, vibration, b u r s t , acoustical, and vacuum requirements.\n\n-\n\nHot firings will b e conducted at the propulsion subcontractor\'s field l a b o r a tory. Initial s y s t e m testing will be conducted with "work-horse" h a r d w a r e a t\nambient conditions. Prototype s y s t e m testing will follow the initial t e s t and will\ninclude altitude, acceleration, shock, and vibration testing. T h e s e t e s t s w i l l\nencompass the e x t r e m e s of s y s t e m operating l i m i t s to verify satisfactory o p e r a ting limits t o verify s a t i s f a c t o r y operation in e x c e s s of specification requirements.\nPrequalification s y s t e m testing in scheduled to s t a r t approximately 2 5 months\nafter go-ahead. The qualification p r o g r a m will be initiated a l m o s t a t the same\nt i m e of the prequalification testing and will probably continue f r o m 2 to 3 months\na f t e r the p r equalification p r o g r a m has been completed.\n14. Descent and r e e r e c t i o n s y s t e m development. System analysis will b e\nconducted to determine the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c p e r f o r m a n c e r e q u i r e d f r o m the descent\nand r e e r e c t i o n system. The s y s t e m design will attempt to encompass as l a r g e\nas possible a variation in the Martian atmospheric model. However, where\nn e c e s s a r y , s m p h a s i s will be placed on the model of c u r r e n t highest probability.\nSelection of the descent s y s t e m subcontractor will be based on competitive bidding. Only c o n t r a c t o r s with demonstrated capability in t h i s technology will be\nconsidered. Close liaison will be maintained with the subcontractor during the\ne n t i r e development program. Extensive functional and environmental testing\nwill be n e c e s s a r y to evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the descent\nand r e e r e c t i o n system. Tower and a i r c r a f t drop t e s t p r o g r a m s described e l s e where will b e a major factor i n the evaluation of t h i s subsystem. Considerable\nf a c t o r y and field liaison will b e required during the e n t i r e manufacture, qualification t e s t , assem-bly acceptance test, and operational phases of the prngr=_~,.\n\n15. Aerospace ground equipment development. The a e r o s p a c e ground\nequipment, i n support of t h e spacecraft, will consist of e l e c t r i c a l checkout\nequipment and mechanical handling, t r a n s f e r , and shipping equipment f o r the\na s s e m b l e d spacecraft and its subsystems and components. During the s p a c e c r a f t development phase, AGE support will maintain close liaison with all areas\nof the design effort. As the specifications and p e r f o r m a n c e c r i t e r i a are developed f o r the spacecraft and i t s subsystems and a s s e m b l i e s , the r e q u i r e m e n t s\nfor the AGE support equipment a r e identified and formulated and specifications\n-19-\n\na r e evolved. The design i s then tested for i t s compatibility with the various\nmockups and developmental units of the o r b i t e r , lander, a complete spacecraft,\nsubsystems, and assemblies.\nIncluded in the subsystem tests p e r f o r m e d by the e l e c t r i c a l AGE a r e the\nfollowing:\nDuring the qualification t e s t p r o g r a m , functional checks will be\na.\np e r f o r m e d on s p a c e c r a f t s y s t e m s to demonstrate capability of equipment t o\no p e r a t e under r e q u i r e d environmental conditions.\nP r i o r t o a s s e m b l y into spacecraft, checks will b e p e r f o r m e d on\nb.\neach subsystem.

Sterilization program. A sterilization facility will b e r e q u i r e d t o\ns t e r i l i z e and certify the sterility of lander flight hardware. It willbe n e c e s s a r y to\ndesign, construct, equip, staff, and check out thisfacility. Apilot sterilization plant,\na working model of the actual facility, will b e constructed t o establish and evalua t e the sterilization approach which is t o b e used. This facility will allow a c quisition of s t a t i s t i c a l data upon which the sterilization p r o c e d u r e s can be based.\nTwo f o r m a l sterilization facilities w i l l be r e q u i r e d for t h i s p r o g r a m . A c o m plete facility at the lander a s s e m b l y s i t e will allow initial sterilization of lander\nhardware. A second complete facility should b e e r e c t e d at the launch s i t e ;\nhowever, the second facility can be reduced to include only the t e r m i n a l portion\nof the facility a t s m a l l r i s k to the program. An extensive training p r o g r a m for\nsterilization personnel m u s t b e established to adequately t r a i n the a s s e m b l y and\ncertification technicians. The sterilization facility m u s t then be checked out\nusing mockups and development hardware of the final configuration t o establish\nthe adequacy of the sterilization procedures. The sterilization facility m u s t be\nrechecked at r e g u l a r i n t e r v a l s to ensure that no relaxation of the rigid controls\nh a s occurred. A m o r e detailed description of the sterilization facility i s p r e sented in volume 3.\n17. T e s t support p r o g r a m . The flight planning, launch support, and p e r f o r m a n c e evaluation activities f o r the Voyager p r o g r a m include (a) preflight\nplanning and support of the r a n g e requirements, (b) field activities, and (c)\npostflight engineering evaluation.\nGeneral mission planning is directed toward development of the o v e r a l l\ntest plan and method of accomplishment. Consideration of the p r o g r a m objectives, design configuration, and launch constraints will provide the b a s i s for\ndetermining the n e c e s s i t y f o r flight t e s t s , ground t e s t s , and engineering\nd a t a acquisition.\n\nA ground-support s y s t e m plan w i l l be developed and documented e a r l y in\nthe p r o g r a m . This will integrate the tracking, communications, data acquisition, and range support requirements n e c e s s a r y to support the interplanetary\nlaunch. F i n a l definition of the requirements will n e c e s s a r i l y be a cooperative\neffort with NASA, ZPL, range p e r s o m e ! , m d participiting cootractore,\nE a r l y in the p r o g r a m , a n orbiter-lander handling and test philosophy is\ndeveloped which c o v e r s the f a c t o r y through launch phase. This philosophy is\nbased GE (a) the analysis of each system m d its individual checkout r e q u i r e m e n t s ; (b) the o v e r a l l o r b i t e r -lander configurations and the r e s t r i c t i o n s o r\ns p e c i a l r e q u i r e m e n t s which it imposes on handling devices and techniques;\n(c) the r e q u i r e m e n t f o r clean r o o m operations and lander sterilization; and\n(d) consideration of t h e test-station range-safety r e q u i r e m e n t s . As the\n-21-\n\nt\n\np r o g r a m p r o g r e s s e s , the other ground t e s t planning activities a r e being a c c o m plished and t h e i r r e s u l t s fed back i n support of the original concepts. Based on\nt h e s e data, a s s e m b l y and t e s t procedures will b e p r e p a r e d and published. These\np r o c e d u r e s a r e provided t o the field for t h e i r u s e i n processing the o r b i t e r -lander.\n\nAs a means of verifying t h e handling and t e s t philosophy and the compatibility of the support equipment, both the o r b i t e r - l a n d e r and itself, a compatibility\nt e s t e x e r c i s e will be conducted. This e x e r c i s e will occur as e a r l y i n t h e p r o g r a m as possible, but is contingent on the delivery of the f i r s t of each type of\nsupport equipment to be fabricated and the availability of a model o r b i t e r - l a n d e r\nf o r u s e i n the exercise. Because of these contingencies, an e x e r c i s e such as\nthis n o r m a l l y cannot OCCUT until just before implementation of the p r o g r a m at\nthe field station.\nThe e x e r c i s e will be conducted at the home plant so that the d i s c l o s u r e of\nany discrepancies m a y b e speedily resolved. The operations to be p e r f o r m e d\nand checked will b e identical to those documented i n the a s s e m b l y and test p r o cedures. The e x e r c i s e will also s e r v e a secondary purpose, that of providing a\nm e a n s of familiarizing the field personnel with the equipment and procedures.\nAnalysis will be made of the environments t o be encountered, the s y s t e m\nfunctions to be performed, and the d a t a acquisition capabilities f r o m launch\nthrough planetary encounter. F r o m t h i s analysis, r e q u i r e m e n t s will b e e s t a b lished for the engineering m e a s u r e m e n t s t o b e made aboard the o r b i t e r and\nlander. The final output of this t a s k will b e a f o r m a l data specification for the\no r b i t e r -lander listing m e a s u r e m e n t s t o b e m a d e , range, sampling r a t e , and\njustification f o r t h e s e measurements.\nThe orbiter-lander systems and methods of testing will be evaluated both\nf r o m a standpoint of safety to personnel and gathering of data for submission of\na range safety package. Special consideration is given t o those s y s t e m s and\nc i r c u i t s which contain pyrotechnic devices o r radioactive material. The evaluation of t h e s e s y s t e m s concentrates on p r o p e r safing techniques, p r o p e r u s e of\nt e s t equipment t o check them, and exercising the n e c e s s a r y precautions f o r\npersonnel safety while working with them. T h e s e include (a) t e s t support equipment installation and checkout, (b) s y s t e m a s s e m b l y and checkout, (c) launch\nstand compatibility tests, (d) lander sterilization, (e) flight-instrumentation\ncalibration, and ( f ) on-stand mating final checks.\n\n- .\n\naLquLi-&di;; Z : Z C Y ~ ? : Z C ~ l++k the r m q l i i r e m e n t s established\nabove will b e p r o c e s s e d and analyzed t o provide an evaluation of the s y s t e m p e r f o r m a n c e f r o m launch through planetary encounter.\ne n g i n e e r iug\n\n1\n\n.\n\nU a L a\n\n18. Drop t e s t program. A drop t e s t p r o g r a m will b e run. It will include\nboth tower and a i r c r a f t drop t e s t s to subject the lander descent s y s t e m , impact\nattenuator, and r e e r ection s y s t e m to anticipated v e r t i c a l and horizontal combinations in additon to a variety of topographical configurations. The lower d r o p\n-22-\n\nt e s t p r o g r a m will be conducted during mid-1 966; approximately 20 such t e s t s\nwill b e required. The a i r c r a f t drop t e s t p r o g r a m will allow evaluation of the\ndrogue stability s y s t e m and main chute deployment and inflation. If high Mach\nnumber deceleration and stabilization t e s t s a r e required, rocket-boost t e s t s\nw i l l be conducted.\n19. Earth entry t e s t program. Two full-scale E a r t h entry t e s t s a r e planned\nfor the M a r s lander. These t e s t s will be designed to simulate the e n t r y heating\nexperienced in M a r s entry. An entry velocity of approximately 24,000 f t / sec\nas a r e e n t r y angle of 90 degrees will subject the e n t r y vehicle to a maximum\ndeceleration of approximately 150 g. These t e s t s w i l l demonstrate the capabilities of the e n t i r e e n t r y s y s t e m under simulated Martian entry conditions.\nThe aerodynamic, thermodynamic, s t r u c t u r a l , and descent subsystems w i l l be\nthoroughly evaluated at high Mach numbers. These flights a r e planned for the\nAtlantic Missile Range, existing booster s y s t e m s such as the Atlas -Agena\n30 ks 8000 being suitable for t h e s e tests. T h r e e M a r s lander vehicles will be\nmanufactured f o r these t e s t s which include two flight vehicles and a spare.\nThese t e s t s will be r u n in l a t e 1967 to provide design information e a r l y enough\nin the p r o g r a m to be of use in improving the M a r s 1969 e n t r y vehicle design.\n\n20. Qualification t e s t program. Qualification t e s t s will be p e r f o r m e d\non each different spacecraft configuration. The qualification t e s t s a r e conducted\nt o demonstrate the ability of the design to meet the performance specifications\na f t e r being subjected to t e s t l e v e l s exceeding the s e v e r e operational environments.\nThe qualification t e s t s w i l l b e performed on a s s e m b l i e s , subsystems, and\ns y s t e m s of final design.\nThe qualification t e s t s will encompass various physical inspections and\nfunctional t e s t s . E x e r c i s e of physical devices and full e l e c t r i c a l operation will\nbe p e r f o r m e d before, during, and after specified environmental exposures. In\nthis manner, compliance with the specifications during testing may be determined.\nThe qualification t e s t s will determine various physical and electromagnetic\np r o p e r t i e s , among which are (a) weight and balance (cg), and (b) moment of\ni n e r t i a (including location of principal a x e s and moments about axes), (c) alignment of attitude control r e f e r e n c e axes with principal axes, (d) p r e s s u r e leakage\nof any sealed assembly, (e) magnetic p r o p e r t i e s (including ii 1 alternating fieids\nand d i r e c t i i e i d s during a l modes oi operation, and ( 2 ) r e s i d u a l field, including\nl\nchanges), (f) e l e c t r i c a l i n t e r f e r e n c e (including (1) e l e c t r i c a l and radio frequency\ninteraction between subsystems of spacecraft and (2) radiation of signals which\nare potential i n t e r f e r e n c e w i t h launch vehicle o r range equipment).\nAmong the environmental t e s t s included in the qualification testing p r o g r a m\nare (a) handling shock, (b) transportation shock, (c) acceleration, (d) vibration\n(mechanical a n d / o r acoustic drive), (e) t e m p e r a t u r e , (f) humidity, and (h)\nthermal-vacuum (cold wall, s o l a r simulation where required) and explosive\natmosphere.\n\n-23-\n\n2 1. Manufacturing and quality control. The manufacturing and quality\ncontrol effort f o r the Voyager P r o g r a m includes the labor, m a t e r i a l s , and\nsubcontractor s y s t e m s required t o produce the h a r d w a r e l i s t e d i n table 3.\nA n allowance f o r manufacturing and quality control attrition of one a t t r i t i o n\nunit f o r e y e r y t h r e e hardware units required i s included.

All subassembly and component level manufacturivg\nand a s s e m b l y a r e to be done under clean r o o m conditions.\n\n-24-\n\nL\n\n2 . 2 Critical Problem Areas\n\nThe Voyager design study has revealed a number of design and development\na r e a s which r e p r e s e n t potential problems i n c a r r y i n g out the Voyager P r o g r a m .\nThe m o s t important of these a r e listed and briefly d i s c u s s e d ,\n1. Sterilization. To comply with the requirement that M a r s be kept f r e e\nf r o m contamination with the probability of 1 in 10,000 r e q u i r e s development\nof techniques w h i c h a r e beyond the present capabilities of clean-roommanufacture\nand assembly. Not only does the requirement for sterilization impose r e a l\nproblems in the reliability of equipment but a l s o r e s u l t s in m a j o r difficulties in\ndemonstration that the d e s i r e d degree of freedom f r o m contamination has been\nattained.\nSurface topography of Mars. One of the purposes of the M a r s space2.\nc r a f t is t o obtain m o r e information about the surface topography. Yet in the\nabsence of this information, the lander m u s t be designed so that it has a capability of surviving and communicating with Earth. The proposed solution to\nthis problem i s to u s e a lander with a r e e r e c t i o n capability together with a\ncommunications r e l a y link. More topographical information would clearly\ni n c r e a s e the confidence in this o r any design.\nCommunications. There a r e s e v e r a l difficulties in the design of the\n3.\ncommunication s y s t e m s . F i r s t the signal level received by the lander command\nlink with the DSIF is marginal. Second, uncertainty i n the s u r f a c e t e r r a i n m a y\nr e s u l t in multipath t r a n s m i s s i o n from the lander. Third, the possibility of\nvoltage breakdown on the lander antennas limits the transmitted power which\ncan be used.\n4.\nReliability. The extremely long m i s s i o n lifetime imposes new challenges to the reliability of all components of the system. The flight time for\ntype I1 t r a j e c t o r i e s to M a r s i s g r e a t e r than 1 year in 1975. This together\nwith the 6-month mission duration after encounter r e s u l t s in a total m i s s i o n\nlife of a year and a half.\n\nHeat Shield. The design of the heat shield for M a r s imposes no p a r t i c 5.\nular difficulties. The heat shield design for Venus, however, r e p r e s e n t s\ndevelopment problems because of the extremely high heat fluxes which will b e\nh\ni\nencountered during d i r e c t entrv. Adequate f z r i l i t i - ? fer t : z k - d & ~ i i o ~ n e s e\nIluxes do not exist and m u s t be developed.\nr\n\n.\n\n6. Atmospheric v a r i a t i o n of Mars and Venus. The uncertainty in the\natmospheric model for M a r s and Venus and in particular the diurnal and annual\nvariations i n the atmosphere r e q u i r e entry vehicle designs which a r e adaptable\nt o a wide variety of conditions.\n\n-25-\n\n7.\nInstrumentation design. The p r i m a r y difficulty in scientific i n s t r u mentation is to achieve the high reliability and long life required with i n s t r u ments which can sustain terminal heat sterilization.\n8.\nRadioisotope thermoelectric power supply for the lander. Development\nof an RTC power supply capable of delivering 110 watts and having a reasonable\nweight is one of the pacing items for the p r o g r a m , and this activity should be\ns t a r t e d at once.\n\n9 . I n - t r a n s i t t h e r m a l control. The s a m e b a s i c o r b i t e r design i s planned\nfor both M a r s and Venus. The thermal control technique proposed is completely\npassive and will b e achieved by the use of different surface coatings f o r the\nM a r s and Venus m i s s i o n s . Much m o r e detailed design is required before this\napproach can b e proposed with confidence.\n10. Surface environment of Venus. The present lack of information about\nthe s u r f a c e environment of Venus makes the design of a lander difficult and the\ndesign of a d i r e c t link capability extremely questionable. The s u r f a c e t e m p e r a t u r e a l s o poses s e v e r e problems in designing a lander with long m i s s i o n life.\n\n11 Mapping of Venus. The cloud cover of Venus m a k e s visual mapping\nimpossible and i t s slow r a t e of rotation m a k e s mapping of any kind difficult.\nIn o r d e r to achieve w i d e - a r e a mapping, e i t h e r extremely long lifetime i n a\npolar orbit o r mapping f r o m different orbital planes i s required.\na\n\n12. Space environment. Adequate knowledge does not exist at p r e s e n t to\ndesign adequate meteroid protection nor t o design for the effect of other c o s m i c\np a r t i c l e s which m a y cause sputtering and degradation of m a t e r i a l s .\nThe s u c c e s s of the Voyager program will b e dependent in p a r t on our\nability to find solutions to these problems. An important p a r t of the M a r i n e r\np r o g r a m will b e t o help provide these answers.\n\n2. 3 Major Facilities Requirements\n\nThe following m a j o r facilities a r e required for the performance of the\nVoyager p r o g r a m .

The following a r e the m a j o r identifiable special t e s t equipments:\n1. Air-bearing table and astrosimulator.\nAn a i r bearing-table will F.2\nr e q u i r e a to physically suppbrt the G a c e c r a f t during closed-loop dynamic p e r\nformance t e s t s on the attitude control s y s t e m s . The table will be installed i n\na n a s t r o s i m u l a t o r which w i l l simulate the position and brightness of the s u n ,\nC a n ~ p u s , Mais, and the E a r t h during the t e s t s . The capacity of the a i r - b e a r i n g\ntable will be sufficient to take the weight of the spacecraft. The s i z e of the a s t r o simulator will be l a r g e enough t o accommodate the air-bearing table with the\n\n-\n\n-28-\n\ns p a c e c r a f t mounted and a l s o p e r m i t angular displacement with r e s p e c t to\nCanopus, the sun, and Mars.\nConvective a r c . A convective a r c facility will be required to evaluate\n2.\nthe e f f e c t of convective heat transfer to the candidate heat shield m a t e r i a l s\nunder a variety of heat fluxes, enthalpies, s h e a r forces, and atmospheres.\nConvective heat fluxes of s e v e r a l hundred Btu/ft2-sec m u s t be simulated for\nthe M a r s entry. Much higher fluxes m u s t be simulated for the Venus entry.\nThe a r c s m u s t be capable of enthalpies up t o a t l e a s t 10, 000 Btu/lb. The a r c s\nm u s t a l s o have a wide s h e a r force capability and working gas capabilities of\ncarbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon in any combination.\n3.\nRadiant a r c . F o r the Venus entry simulation, the capability of a t taining heat fluxes up t o a t l e a s t 1 0 , 0 0 0 Btu/ft2-sec is required. The r e q u i r e ments for the M a r s entry simulation a r e l e s s severe. Various atmospheres\nof carbon monoxide, nitrogen] and argon gas m i x t u r e s m u s t be available.\nThese a r c s will probably be arc-imaging f u r n a c e s for the lower heat fluxes\nand plasma a r c s for the higher fluxes. They will be used to establish the\nbasic h e a t - t r a n s f e r mechanisms of candidate m a t e r i a l s when exposed to r a d i a n t energy. The data will be employed to formulate analytical expressions\nthat describe m a t e r i a l response to radiant heating and p e r m i t heat shield\nm a t e r i a l evaluation.\n\nConvective radiant a r c . A convective radiant a r c will be required to\n4.\ngenerate combined convective and radiant heat pulses over the ranges of heat\nfluxes, enthalpies, shear f o r c e s , and atmospheres that may be encountered\nduring M a r s and Venus entry condition. They probably will be composed of\nlow- and high-intensity arc-imaging f u r n a c e s superimposed over convective\nheating plasma a r c s of varying heat flux, enthalpy, s h e a r , and atmospheric\ncapabilities.

These a r e a s a r e ( 1 ) sterilization, ( 2 ) the RTG fuel\nelement, and ( 3 ) the scientific instrumentation.\n\n-32-\n\nJ\n\n1. Sterilization. E a c h flyable lander will be subjected to a sterilization\nprocedure to e n s u r e compliance with NASA\'s "germ-free" requirements. To\ndetermine, test, and demonstrate the sterilization approach to be used, a pilot\nplant operation i s being proposed a s the f i r s t step. F r o m the pilot plant o p e r a tion, the p r o c e d u r e s , techniques, and data to obtain the n e c e s s a r y sterilization\nconfidence l e v e l s would be determined. Approximately 3 2 months are r e q u i r e d\nf r o m the initiation of the pilot plant facility to the availability of a f o r m a l s t e r i l i z a tion facility. During this period, the planning, data gathering, testing, staffing,\ntraining, and purchasing requirements f o r the e n t i r e p r o g r a m will be performed.\n\nRTG fuel element, I t is presently anticipated that the fuel element f o r\n2.\nthe radio-isotope thermoelectric generator will be plutonium 238 (Pu-238). The\ndevelopment and delivery lead t i m e for Pu-238 is approximately 2 y e a r s . The\nalternate fuel element f o r the RTG power s o u r c e being considered is c u r i u m 244\n(Cm-244). Cm-244 h a s a s h o r t e r development and delivery lead time,but because\nof i t s higher radiation background, is considered a l e s s attractive choice f o r the\npower s o u r c e fuel element.\n3. Scientific instrumentation. F r o m the nature of the m i s s i o n as well a s\nthe environmental conditions to which they will be subjected, i t is apparent that\nthe scientific instrumentation to be assembled into the o r b i t e r s and l a n d e r s will\nbe unique. It is anticipated that the minimum l e a d t i m e f o r the development and\ndelivery of the f i r s t science packages f o r the M a r s 1969 launch may be approximately 3 y e a r s . Included in this period is the determination of m i s s i o n concept,\nthe selection of instrument type, the issuance of design contracts, developmert,\ntesting, and manufacturing of the hardware units.\n\n2. 7 Government-Furnished Equipment, Items, and S e r v i c e s\n\nThe following l i s t s the i t e m s that will be Government-furnished.

The E a r t h e n t r y t e s t s will be conducted only f o r the M a r s l a n d e r vehicle. Two Saturn b o o s t e r s\nw i l l be required f o r each launch opportunity. The total number required is i 6 .\n2.\nScientific instrumentation. I n s t r u m e n t s to be included in the o r b i t e r\nand l a n d e r ( s ) f o r each Voyager flight, i n accordance with the m i s s i o n concept,\nwill be r e q u i r e d f o r 24 o r b i t e r s ( 1 2 each f o r the M a r s and Venus launches) and\n42 l a n d e r s (18 f o r M a r s and 24 f o r Venus launches).\nThe science packages f o r the Mars 1969 launch opportunity are r e q u i r e d by\nA p r i l 1967 i n o r d e r to be integrated with and a s s e m b l e d into the f i r s t units undergoing qualification t e s t s .\n\n- 33-\n\n3. RTG fuel element. The power s o u r c e f o r the l a n d e r s to be used on the\nM a r s launches will be a radioisotope t h e r m o e l e c t r i c generator. The fuel e l e m e n t to be selected will be either plutonium 238 (Pu-238) o r c u r i u m 244 (Cm-244).\nOf the two, the f o r m e r is m o r e desirable because of i t s lower radiation background, but l e s s a t t r a c t i v e because of its longer lead time. A total of 18 of the\nfuel elements will be r e q u i r e d for the p r o g r a m . Delivery of the t h r e e e l e m e n t s\nf o r the M a r s 1969 launch window i s required by April 1967.\nA i r c r a f t f o r drop t e s t s . Airdrop t e s t s will b e conducted to demonstrate\n4.\nthe design of the M a r s and Venus lander descent and impact system. These t e s t s\nwill be in addition to the tower drop tests. It is expected that NASA will provide\nthe instrumented a i r c r a f t and support s e r v i c e s to p e r f o r m these a i r d r o p t e s t s .\n\n5. Range support. It is expected that NASA will provide f o r each launching,\nthe launch facility, downrange tracking, and the DSIF support including the s e r v i c e s and equipment associated with each.\n\n6.\n\nData analysis. I t is expected that NASA will furnish the facility and\nequipment to receive, decode, and s t o r e the data t r a n s m i t t e d back f r o m each\nlaunch firing.

This table shows milestones for flight unit\nd e l i v e r y to Cape Canaveral, launch d a t e s , enroute i n t e r v a l s , and planetary\noperation i n t e r v a l s and is designed to r e v e a l any launch opportunity overlaps\nwhich might cause i n t e r f e r e n c e s i n launch pad availability o r DSIF\' traffic\nsaturation. As indicated i n table 4, t h e r e a r e no s e v e r e overlaps of launch pad\nr e q u i r e m e n t s between any two launch opportunities. There is a slight overlap\nof a few months between the Venus 1975 and the M a r s 1975 opportunity, but this\ni s not g r e a t enough to cause any pad availability problems. The launch pad\nfacilities which will be available f o r the Saturn S-1B and 1969 will accommodate\na maximum of two simultaneous launchings, which is just adequate for the recommended p r o g r a m of two launchings f o r e v e r y opportunity.\nThe schedule a l s o indicates that t h e r e a r e no s e r i o u s m i s s i o n overlaps\nwhich might c r e a t e a DSIF t r a f f i c saturation problem. There i s o v e r l a p between\nplanetary operations and enroute i n t e r v a l s f o r s e v e r a l adjacent opportunities.\nThe Venus 1972, a n enroute interva1,overlaps the M a r s 1971 planetary operations\ni n t e r v a l and the Venus 1973 enroute and planetary operations intervals. The\nDSIF facility has a maximum tracking capability f o r two simultaneous flights.\nIn the c a s e of the overlaps, there will be a maximum of four simultaneous flights\ni f all launchings a r e successful, but the look angles to M a r s a r e significantly\ndifferent than the look angles to Venus such that the DSIF will be tracking a\nmaximum of two simultaneous flights which is within its capability. T h e r e may\nbe s h o r t - t e r m exceptions to this during and immediately a f t e r a launch, at which\ntime it m a y be n e c e s s a r y to delay tracking of a n i n - t r a n s i t flight f o r a s h o r t ,\nbut acceptable, interval.\n\n3.2\n\nDevelopment Schedule\n\nThe r e f e r e n c e Development Plan schedule ( P l a n I) is shown i n d e t a i l i n\ntable 5 and s u m m a r i z e d i n table 6.

This is based on the expectation that a\ng r e a t p a r t of the system analysis and subsystem evaluation will have been a c complished in a 6-month preliminary design study which precedes the hardware\ncontract. P r e l i m i n a r y and f i n a l drafts of the development plan, reliability p r o g r a m plan, m a j o r t e s t program plan, and s y s t e m s integration plan will be c o m pleted a t contract go-ahead plus 3 months and plus 6 months, respectively.\nThe design of the vehicle and subsystems will be essentially controlled timewise by t h r e e key design milestones: a configuration f r e e z e at c o n t r a c t plus 9\nmonths, a design f r e e z e at contract plus 15 months, and a drawing r e l e a s e at\ncontract plus 22 months (third quarter 1966).

Development of the scientific i n s t r u mentation f o r remote operation i n a new and ill defined e n v i r o r m e n t will r e q u i r e\nextensive study and testing and should begin immediately.\n\n- 57-\n\n4,\n\nCOSTS\n\nThe Voyager P r o g r a m c o s t e s t i m a t e h a s been subdivided i n s e v e r a l ways to a c commodate various c o s t analyses and p r o g r a m revisions which m a y be desired.\nThe total p r o g r a m c o s t s have been subdivided by f i s c a l y e a r s , s u b s y s t e m s and\nengineering disciplines, and by c o s t elements within each subsystem and engineering discipline. Both operational hardware costs and development c o s t s are\nsubdivided by launch window. Operational hardware c o s t s include all acceptance\ntest and field s u p p o r t c o s t s associated with the spacecraft.\nThe c o s t s indicated correspond to the launch profile indicated i n table 10.\nT w o s p a c e c r a f t of the indicated configuration will be flown i n e a c h launch window.\nA completely assembled s p a r e vehicle and a complete s e t of subsystem s p a r e s\nwill a l s o be available for each launch window. This s p a r e s complement is cornpatime with the sterilization philosophy presented.\nWith a t e r m i n a l sterilization facility located at the field site, the maintenance\nof the lander r e q u i r e s a significantly s m a l l e r complement of subsystem s p a r e s\nthan is required if the lander m u s t be returned to the factory f o r maintenance.\nThis difference i n s p a r e s allotment is m o r e costly than construction and operation of the field s i t e sterilization facility.\nThe l e s s ambitious launch program identified in table 10, which eliminates\nthe Venus 1972 and 1975 launches, allows a reduction in total p r o g r a m cost\nfrom $798.6 to $668.5 million.\n\nThe influence of the Martian low-density atmospheric model on the p r o g r a m\ncost has not been evaluated i n detail; however, some elements can be identified.\nI the lander configuration does not change, except in i t s e x t e r n a l h e a t shield\nf\nand structure1 to reduce the M/CDA, the lander p e r unit c o s t will not appreciably\nchange, The l a r g e r lander size will not allow the o r b i t e r / t w o lander o r Bus/two\nlander configurations shown for the M a r s 1971 and M a r s 1975 launch opportunitiee,\nrespectively. These opportunities will only accommodate a n o r b i t e r / l a n d e r\nconfiguration, This change i n the proposed launch profile w i l l reduce the total\np r o g r a m c o s t by $9 million.\nReducing the length of the development p r o g r a m by 9 months, delaying the\np r o g r a m start date f r o m October 1964 to July 1965, as shown i n table 7, will\n2.ep-&-e?s,-;*e;;* ccsts 2 +A==%%,e I,e.:el cf &?pig11 effnyt iB tn he applied.\nizc=e&se\nA few of-the subsystem d e s i g n and development cycles must be compressed,\nrequiring the application of overtime, and in some caseg, duplicate developments\nwill be n e c e s s a r y to e n s u r e availability of flightqualified h a r d w a r e in sufficient\ntime tb accommodate the 1969 M a r s flight.
