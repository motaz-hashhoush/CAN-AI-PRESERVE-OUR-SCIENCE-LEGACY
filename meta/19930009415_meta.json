The emphasis of the study is the characterization of the near wake region which includes the ASTV payload. The study covered the transitional flow regime from near continuum to free molecular. Calculations show that the character of the near wake is significantly affected by the presence of the payload. Flow separation occurs when an afterbody is present throughout the transitional flow regime. In contrast, when no afterbody is present, no separation is observed until the flow approaches continuum.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930009415, "id": "fb0bc29f7f1e4fe6bdbd1229aef9c165", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930009415.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930009415/downloads/19930009415.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930009415/downloads/19930009415.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930009415/downloads/19930009415.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
