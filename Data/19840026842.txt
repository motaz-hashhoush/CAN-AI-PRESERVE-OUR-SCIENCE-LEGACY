Additionally, damping material is\napplied to the wire probe (24) in the form of a damper\ntube (70) through which the wire probe passes in the\nregion adjacent the transducer tip. The damper tube\nextends outwardly from the transducer tip (26) a predetermined distance, terminating in a resilient soft rubber\njoint (72). Also, the damper tube is supported intermediate its length by a support member (82). The damper\nsystem thus provided acts to inhibit lateral vibrations of\nthe wire in the region of the transducer tip (26) while\nproviding little or no damping to the linear vibrations\nimparted to the wire (24) by the transducer (28).\n18 Claims, 7 Drawing Figures\n\n7\n\nU.S. Patent\n\noct. 2,1984\n\nSheet 1 of 2\n\n4,474,180\n\nUS.

The coupling between\nthe transducer and the wire probe comprises clamping\nmeans at the tip of the transducer including a pair of\nopposing screw type members, one of which acts as an\nanvil for accepting the clamping load from the other\nmember while preventing deformation of the wire\nprobe at the point of clamping. Also includedk damp-.\ning means located dong a predetermined length of thewire adjacent the transducer tip for inhibiting ltr ae+\nvibiation of the wire when driven by the.tran$uzE:\xe2\x80\x9d,\nThe foregoing as well as other objects, features and\nadvantages of the invention will become apparent from\nthe following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the appended drawings.\n\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\n\n5\n\nThe invention described herein was made by an employee of the U.S.Government and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties 10\nthereon or therefor.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe invention relates generally to a mechanical system for disintegrating urinary calculi and more particu- 15\nlarly to ultrasonic apparatus for fragmenting urinary\ncalculi in situ.\nBACKGROUND ART\nThe incidence of hospitalization for the removal of 2\n0\nurinary calculi, commonly referred to as kidney stones,\nhas been estimated to be as high as 200,000 cases per\nyear. A vast majority of these patients pass their stones\nspontaneously; however, in the remainder, the kidney\nstone@) become impacted in the ureter, a muscle tube 25\njoining the kidney to the bladder. An impacted kidney\nstone is a source of intense pain and bleeding, a source\nof infection and, if a stone completely blocks the flow of\nurine for any extended length of time, can cause a loss of\na kidney. Small stones which are lodged in the lower 30\none thud of the ureter can frequently be removed nonsurgically using a technique employing a well known\nDormia stone basket. This procedure is successful in\napproximately 50% of the cases. However, basket removal of a kidney stone usually fails if the stone is 35\nlodged in the upper ureter, is impacted, or is in the order\nof 1.0 cm in size. In these. cases the only procedure by\nwhich the stone could heretofore be removed was\nthrough a major operation called a ureterolithotomy.\nMore recently, however, a non-surgical method for 40\nremoving kidney stones has been developed wherein a\ncatheter is placed cystoscopically at the site of the stone\nin the urinary tract, after which a long wire probe,\nacting as an ultrasonic waveguide, is passed through a 45\nlumen of the catheter and is brought into contact with\nthe stone. The wire probe is attached to an ultrasonic\ntransducer which, when energized, sets the wire probe\ninto longitudinal and transverse vibrations. The vibrational energy is transmitted to the stone, causing it to 50\nfracture into small fragments which the patient can then\npass spontaneously after withdrawal of the catheter.\nWhile such apparatus is adapted to operate as intended, a severe limitation has been found to exist due to\nPremature breakage of the Wire Probe at the point of 55\nconnection to the tip of the ultrasonic transducer. The\nvibrational energy, typically 20KHz in frequency,\ncauses the wire probe to snap off after 15 or 20 seconds\nof operation. This has been found to be insuffcient time\nto complete a kidney stone disintegration procedure, 60\neven though the stone will fracture after as little as\nabout 10 seconds of contact with the wire probe. What\nis required is a means to prolong the operational life of\nthe wire probe for a length of time adequate for completion of the procedure. A desirable time frame is typi- 65\ncally 1 minute, which is an order of magnitude greater\nthan that currently provided by known prior art apparatus.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a side elevational view of apparatus in accordance with the prior art for fragmenting kidney\nstones.\nFIG. 2 is a partial longitudinal sectional view of an\nultrasonic transducer tip in accordance with the prior\nart.\nFIG. 3 is a partial longitudinal sectional view of a\nprior art transducer tip illustrating the manner in which\na wire probe is clamped therein.\nFIG. 4 is a partial longitudinal sectional view of a\ntransducer tip in accordance with the subject invention.\nFIG. 5 is a partial longitudinal sectional view of the\ntransducer tip as shown in FIG. 4 and being illustrative\nof the manner in which a wire probe is clamped in\naccordance with the subject invention.\nFIG. 6 is a partial perspective view of the anvil portion of the clamping means shown in FIG. 5.\nFIG. 7 is a partial side elevational view of vibrational\ndamping means forming a part of the subject invention.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F THE\nINVENTION\nRefer now to the drawings and, more particularly, to\nFIG. 1, where there is illustrated an ultrasonic kidney\nstone disintegration instrument in accordance with the\nprior art. The purpose of this Figure is to provide a\nbetter understanding of the invention to be described in\ndetail when FIGS. &through 7 are considered. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a cystoscope 10 is shown inserted\nthrough a urethra 12 and into a bladder 14. A catheter\n16 is inserted through the cystoscope 10, the bladder 14\n\n3\n\n4474,180\n. I .\n\nand into a ureter 18 until its far end 20 comes into proximity to a piece of urinary calculi, hereinafter referred\nto as a kidney stone 22.An ultrasonic waveguide in the\nform of a wire probe 24 is inserted through one of eight\nlumens in the catheter 16 until its far end 23 contacts the\nstone 22. The diameter of the wire probe 24 is of a\nsubstantially smaller diameter than the lumen diameter\nof the catheter 16 so that any movement of the wire\nprobe is not restricted by the catheter material. The\n4\nopposite or near end 25 of the wire probe 2 is connected to the tip 26 of an ultrasonic transducer assembly\n28 which is mounted on a base 30.The base 30 includes\na micrometer 32 which is connected to the transducer\n28 for adjusting the position of the wire probe 24 against\nthe stone 22 by a linear translation of the transducer\nassembly 28 on the base 30. The base 30 additionally\nincludes an outward angular support member 34 which\nincludes a connector element in the form of a catheter\njoint 36 for engaging and holding the near end of the\ncatheter 16.As shown in FIG. 1, the wire probe 2 is\n4\nclamped to the end of the transducer 26 by means of a\nset screw 38 which leads now to consideration of FIGS.\n2 and 3.\nReferring now to FIG. 2,the transducer tip 26 which\nis partially shown in section includes a central longitudinal axial bore 40 which is adapted to receive the probe\nwire 24 (FIG. l, not shown. The tip 26 additionally\n)\nincludes a threaded screw hole 42 which runs mutually\ntransverse to and through the axial bore 40,terminating\nin a cone point 4 which results from the drill and/or\n4\ntap used for making the screw hole.\nReferring now to FIG. 3, it can be seen that when the\nwire probe 2 is inserted into the bore 40 and then\n4\nclamped by means of the set screw 38 inserted into the\n\n4\ncan be controlled and easily centered since the anvil\nface 62 is adjustable by the turning of the set screw 60\nand thus the axis of the wire can be moved up or down\nto coincide with the central longitudinal axis 52 (FIG.\n5 3) of the axial bore 40. Whereas in the prior a t apparar\ntus the set screw 38,as shown in FIG. 3, typically includes a spherical tip, the type of set screw employed by\nthe subject invention is a set screw 65 with a flat tip 66,\nthus removing the tendency for crimping the wire\n10 probe 24 at the point of contact with the wire and/or\n0\nanvil face portion of the opposing set screw 6 . It\nshould be noted that the addition of the second set\nscrew 60 does not unbalance the tuned mass of the\ntransducer assembly which includes the tip portion 26.\nI5 This is in contrast to earlier attempts which added a\nwire clamping fixture to the external tip 26 of the transducer. Such an arrangement caused an unbalance in the\nsystem, resulting in the loss of energy in the wire probe.\nReferring now to FIG. 7, the second feature of the\n20 invention is directed to the utilization of a damper tube\nmember 70, typically 3\xe2\x80\x9d to 4\xe2\x80\x9d in length, which is placed\nover the external portion of the wire probe 24 in the\nregion where the wire probe emerges from the transducer tip 26, and extends outwardly therefrom termi25 nating in a block of relatively thick, soft rubber 72\nwhich has two offset bores 74 and 76 formed therein\nwith the latter adapted to accommodate a catheter 16\nwith an off axis wire lumen 77 shown in FIG. 7 The\n.\nsoft rubber block 72 is adapted to act as a damper and\n30 catheter joint, and is held in position by a support member 78 which is secured to a base member 80. Base\nmember 80 corresponds, for example, to the base mem.\nber 30 shown in FIG. 1 In order to provide additional\nsupport for the damper tube 70 an intermediate damper\n\nthreaded screw hole 42, the tip 50 of the set screw 38 35 tube support member 82 including a rubber bushing 84\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n8\n\ncauses a crimping of the end of the wire probe 24 into\nthe cone point 44,which causes the probe wire 24 to\nbecome offset relative to the central longitudinal axis 52\nof the transducer tip 26. As a consequence, a relatively\nhigh mechanical stress is induced into the wire probe at 40\npoint 54. This condition has been found to be the primary source of premature breakage when subjected to\n)\nlateral vibration from the transducer 28 (FIG. 1. Additionally, the undamped motion of the vibrating wire at\nthe point 56 where it emerges from the transducer tip 26 45\nalso contributes to the metal fatigue problem causing\nthe wire probe to break.\nWith the foregoing in mind, the invention is directed\nto overcoming the problem of premature breakage of\nthe wire probe 24 through the addition of two structural 50\ncomponents, one of which prevents deformation of the\nwire probe at the point of clamping, while the other\ninhibits lateral vibration of the wire probe in the area\nwhere it is being driven by the ultrasonic transducer.\nWith respect to the first feature, as illustrated in 55\nFIGS. 4 and 5, the transducer tip 26 is modified to\ninclude a second threaded screw hole 58 diametrically\nopposed to the threaded screw hole 42 and which extends into the longitudinal bore 40. The threaded screw\nhole 58 is adapted to accept a second set screw, one 60\nwith fine threads, which is shown by reference numeral\n60 in FIG. 5. Further, the set screw 60, as shown in\nFIG. 6, includes a flattened end portion 62 having a\nsurface which includes at least one, but preferably a pair\nof mutually transverse shallow grooves 64 forming a + 65\nwhich are adapted to accommodate and thus act as an\nanvil for the end portion of the wire probe 24 when\ninserted in the bore 40. The axis of the wire probe 24\n\nis placed approximately midway between the trans-\n\nducer tip 26 and the member 72.\nIn such a configuration, the linear vibrations imparted by the transducer assembly 28, including the\ntransducer tip 26,are not significantly damped but are\ntransmitted along the wire probe 24 and out of the\ndamper tube 70.At that point, i.e. in the region of the\ndamper and catheter joint 72,the vibrational energy is\nfree to induce the desired random lateral motion in the\n4\nwire probe 2 necessary to shatter kidney stones. \xe2\x80\x99Additionally, the high mechanical stress caused at the point\nof clamping the wire 24 to the transducer tip 26 as well\nas the undamped motion of the vibrating wire where it\nexits from the transducer contributing to the metal fatigue problem have been alleviated.\nThe advantage of the ultrasonic kidney stone disintegration instrument modified in accordance with the\nteachings of this invention is a sizable increase in instrument lifetime, typically by a factor of fifteen or more.\nIn summation, what has been shown and described is\nan improvement in an instrument for disintegrating\nkidney stones by the introduction of a grooved adjustable anvil in the transducer tip at the clamping point of\nthe wire probe to lessen concentrated stresses in the\nwire as well as the introduction of a vibrational damper\nsystem which minimizes lateral wire motion at the\ntransducer tip while nevertheless transmitting linear\nmotion thereto which acts to prolong the useful life of\nthe wire probe.\nHaving thus shown and described the invention in its\nspecific detail, the same has been provided by way of\nexplanation and not limitation and accordingly all modifications, alterations and changes coming within the\n\n5\n\n4,474,180\n\nspirit and scope of the invention are herein meant to be\nincluded.\nI claim:\n1.
