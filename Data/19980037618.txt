Miller-Urey sparkdischarge laboratory experiments,\ncarried out to simulate\nhypothetical hydrogen-rich\nprimitive Earth atmospheres, yield\norganic bulk reaction products which are :_ isotopically heavier\nthan -10%0 and that could not have contributed to the carbon in\nthe apatites. We can rule out reduced carbon from carbonaceous\nmeteorites (the richest contain ~3 mass% reduced C), as carbon\nisotope ratios for these generally cluster at _ -11 to -18%_ and\nthere is no reason to expect meteoritic carbon to be selectively\nassociated with apatite in BIF. Regardless of the modes of origin\nfor the carbon components in the various materials mentioned\nabove, the ,5_3Cvalues for the carbon inclusions in apatite are 1015%o lighter still than the ,$13Cvalues seen in such abiogenic\nsamples, and are characteristic of the range of carbon isotopic\ncompositions for bioorganie matter (Fig. 2).\nFor strongly negative carbon isotope values in metamorphosed\nsediments to be convincingly interpreted as unaltered products of\nbioorganic fractionation, it is necessary to analyse the magnitude\nand sign of such effects that could have perturbed an original\ndistribution. Empirical studies have shown that the loss process of\nCO: from the oxidation of organic matter is kinetically controlled,\nand the evolved CO: is isotopically lighter than the source organic\ncarbon. Hence, loss of volatiles from thermally degrading organic\nmatter leads to the residual organic matter being isotopically\nenriched in _C. However, to investigate theoretical scenarios\nwhere progressive thermal metamorphism in principle could\nlead to enrichment of residual carbon in I :C, we evaluated possible\nchanges in the h\'_C value of organic matter included in apatite\nunder both thermodynamically\nopen-system (Rayleigh) and\nclosed-system\n(single-step)\nbehaviours.\nDepending\non the\noxygen fugacity of the system, metamorphism can result in the\nrelease from carbonaceous matter of different proportions of CO,\nand CH_ fluids, but a loss of methane which partitions the light\nisotope can never produce isotopic compositions lighter than the\nstarting materials. On the other hand, the escape (during alia-\n\ngenesis and metamorphism)\nof isotopically heavy CO: evolved\nfrom the organic matter trapped within the apatites could, in such\na theoretical model, drive the residue to lighter isotopic values.\nThe most extreme isotopic shifts would result from a Rayleigh\ndistillation process, which assumes a continuously\nreactive\n(graphitic) residue and immediate removal of CO: from the\nsystem. The progressive change in \'_C/_\'C of the graphite residue\nby such a Rayleigh-type process is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of\nthe fraction of carbonaceous matter consumed in degassing to\neither CO, or CH_ in the apatit\xc2\xa2. This figure shows that, for any\ndegree of degassing and without consuming all of the carbon\ninclusion in the process, it is not possible to generate a final value\n(C r) of _\'_O "= -35%o from an inorganic initial material (C) with\n6_\'_C > -10%o. In fai:t the thermodynamically\ndetermined Rayleigh evolution lines do not intersect the inorganic carbon field\nexcept toward the limit ofF = 1/oc, where F is the mole fraction\nof remaining carbon. We assert that neither by kinetic nor by\nthermodynamic arguments, can loss of volatiles by thermal degradation of organic matter modify isotopically heavy abiotic reduced\ncarbon to make is resemble biogenic organic carbon.\nIn the CHFA mineral structure, carbonate primarily substitutes\nfor [PO:_-], and less frequently for [OH-]. Thermally induced\ndecarbonation of CHFA occurs between 400 and 800 _C via the\ndecarboxylation of structural CO._, and possibly of [CO._-, OH-]\nand [CO C, F-] ion pairs\nleading to the formation of stable\nfluorapatite. However, there is no known mechanism that can\nreduce structural CO._- in CHFA, or its decarbonation product\nCO,, at low partial pressure of hydrogen, to produce carbonaceous inclusions in apatite. Any such hypothetical carbon\nformed by reduction of carbonate or the evolved CO, would\nremain within the inorganic field of carbon isotope ratios\nanyway. Moreover, a simple mass-balance calculation shows that\neven 100% efficiency of such an assumcd carbonate-reduction\nprocess could not supply the observed volume of carbonaceous\ninclusion contained in each of the apatitcs. The association of\napatitc with carbon is observed in the Pilbara sediments as well as\nin other younger, unaltered modern sediments, and in laboratory\ncultures of microorganisms; these features cannot be explained by\nmetamorphism.\nWe thcrofore conclude that metamorphic effect\n\nRG. 3 Theoretical changes in the _13C values of organic carbon by\ndegassing\nof CO2 and CH4 using a Rayleigh distillation\nprocess (opensystem behaviour) z" c_3C = [_$_3Cf/F"Z\']\nwhich assumes a continuously\nreactive (graphitic) residue and immediate\nloss of gas from the system with\nJack of continuous\nisotopic equilibrium\nbetween the evolved gas and the\nresidue.
