b"Environment/Resources\nManagement\n\nWeather lnfonrmtkn Processing\nNASA\n\ntechnology\nspawned an\nadvanced\nweather\nforecasting\nsystem\n\nOn September 11, 1989, Typhoon Sarah hit the east\ncoast of the Republic of China (Taiwan), packing\nwinds of 125 miles per hour. But the people of the\nisland republic were ready for Sarah. The country's\nCentral Weather Bureau was able to issue timely\nwarnings, aided by its brand new METPRO Weather\nSatellite Reception and Processing Ground Station.\nMETPRO collected data from the Geostationary\nMeteorological Satellite positioned over the Equator\nnear Australia and converted the data into images\nshowing the size, center and track of the storm as it\napproached Taiwan.\nA product of General Sciences Corporation\n(GSC), Laurel, Maryland, METPRO is a complete\nmeteorological data\nacquisition and\nprocessing system (left)\ndesigned to meet the full\nrequirements of\nmeteorological research\nand operational weather\nforecasting. It consists of\noff-the-shelf hardware\nand software\ncomponents produced\nby other companies and\nintegrated by GSC,\ntogether with GSCdeveloped METPRO\napplications software for\ncollecting and\nprocessing raw weather\ndata from satellites,\nremote ground-based\nobservation systems and\nradio weather broadcasts\nto generate weather\nmaps and images. In\n1990, GSC introduced the\nMETPRO UMX\n\nworkstation for production of high quality weather\ngraphics and reports.\nGSC is a high technology consulting firm\nspecializing in scientific and engineering support.\nThe company has developed several commercial\nproducts based on experience acquired in contract\nwork for NASA and other government agencies. The\ncompany was founded by Drs. Jeffrey C. Chen and\nLily C. Chen, president and executive vice president\nrespectively. The Chens emigrated from the Republic\nof China in the early 1970s and studied at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin, both earning doctorate\ndegrees in nuclear physics in 1974. Four years later,\narmed with a $75,000 NASA contract, the Chens\nstarted GSC as a basement industry. From that\nmodest beginning, GSC has expanded dramatically;\nthe company now has more than 240 employees,\nannual sales of about $20 million and is predicting\ngrowth of 25-30 percent a year.\nAt lower left, Drs. Jeffrey and Lily Chen consult\nwith a GSC programmer. On the programmer's\nconsole is a METPRO image of Typhoon Sarah,\n\nI\n\nshown in closeup above. Outlined in red in center\nphoto is the island of Taiwan and, to the north, the\ntip of mainland China; the eye of the storm is clearly\nvisible to the east of Taiwan. At right is an example\nof another METPRO product, a sea surface\ntemperature map of the waters off the coasts of\nsouth China and Korea, created by processing data\nfrom the TIROS satellite's Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer; the dark blue color indicates\nthe lowest temperature range (0 to 2 degrees\nCentigrade), the reddish brown color the highest (10\ndegrees) and the other colors denote two degree\nincrements in between.\nGSC's initial NASA work, for Goddard Space\nFlight Center's Laboratory of Atmospheric Sciences,\ninvolved development of a research system - called\nMETPAK - for processing and analyzing data from\nweather satellites. Later, GSC produced an enhanced\nNASA version of METPAK that allowed processing\nweather observations from radar, surface and satellite\nsensors, as well as oceanographic data. This\nAtmospheric and Oceanographic Information\n\nCY.\n\nd\n\nProcessing System served as the departure point for\nGSC's development of the commercial METPRO\nsystem, introduced in 1989. GSC has sold four\nMETPRO systems (two to the Republic of Chma, one\neach to Korea and Thailand) and has prospects for a\nnumber of others.\nIn addition to continuing work for NASA in\nsupport of weather, Earth observation, astronomy,\noceanography and other areas of research, GSC has\nperformed extensive contract work for such other\nagencies as the Environmental Protection Agency,\nthe National Institutes of Health, the National\nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the Department\nof State (GSC supports office automation for more\nthan 250 U.S. embassies).\nBesides METPRO, GSC has recently introduced\ntwo other commercial products: RISKPRO, an\nenvironmental toxic chemical assessment system, ana\nMAPPRO, a geographic information system.\n\nSpecial\napplications\nsoftware\ngenerates\nweather\n\nnuips and\nimages\n\n"
