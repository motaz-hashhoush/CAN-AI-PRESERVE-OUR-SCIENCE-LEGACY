b'Increasing Efficiency of Fecal Coliform Testing through EPA-Approved Alternate Method Colilert*-18\nBrian Cornwell\nNASA GSFC Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA 23337\nBrian.E.Cornwell@NASA.gov\nCost Comparison Chart\n\nIntroduction\n\nCost Comparison\n\nThe 21 SM 9221 E multiple-tube fermentation\nmethod for fecal coliform analysis requires a\nlarge time and reagent investment for the\nperforming laboratory. In late 2010, the EPA\napproved an alternative procedure for the\ndetermination of fecal coliforms designated as\nColilert*-18. However, as of late 2016, only two\nVELAP-certified laboratories in the\nCommonwealth of Virginia have been certified in\nthis method.\n\nTo compare costs of the two tests, we must consider the cost of materials, personnel hours, and additional quality\ncontrol materials and hours.\n\nIDEXX Colilert*-18 method requires the Colilert*-18\nreagent snap pack to be introduced to a 100mL sample,\nallow time to dissolve the reagent, then the sample is\nsealed in a Quantitray. The sample is then incubated at\n44.5\xc2\xb1oC for 18 hours.2 The Colilert*-18 method\nprovides a 1-step incubation process that is simpler for\nlab personnel. The setup procedure also requires less\ntime and effort for lab personnel to accomplish. IDEXX\ncomparator provides less human error in determining\npositive/negative results for this test.\n\n21 SM 9221 E Colilert*-18 Difference\n\n21 SM 9221 E\n\n21 SM 9221 E requires greater quality control per batch of samples analyzed. VELAP accreditation requires each lot of purchased\nprepared medium to have a verified appropriate response by testing with known positive and negative control cultures. This\nmethod requires, per batch, a method blank as well as a duplicate sample per 10% total samples required.1 The cost of quality\ncontrol per test is $19.06. This estimate takes into account the cost of performing quality control on the amount of media tubes\nrequired to perform 200 tests (1000 double strength and 2000 single strength).\nThe time required to perform the setup of one sample for analysis varies from one analyst to another,\nbut has been estimated to be 17 minutes for 21 SM 9221 E. That includes the transfer time from the\nfirst incubator to the second and the additional quality controls required by 21 SM 9221 E. Estimated\nlabor cost, based on $19/hr, is $5.38 for 21 SM 9221 E.4\n\nColilert*-18\n\nTime spent per test\n(est. avg.)\n\n17 min\n\n3 min\n\n14 min\n\nLabor costs per test\n(based on est. avg.\nat $19/hr)\n\n$5.38\n\n$0.95\n\n$4.43\n\nCost of materials\nper test\n\n$15.52\n\n$7.54\n\n$7.98\n\nCost of Quality\nControl per test\n\n$19.06\n\n$0.33\n\n$18.73\n\nTotal\n\nPer test, the media tube (5 tubes of A-1 Double Strength Media broth and 10 tubes of A-1 Single Strength media broth) cost for 21\nSM 9221 E is $38.55 and the costs of materials (pipet tips, sample bottles) is $1.27, bringing the total to $15.52.3,4\n\nMethod Descriptions\n21 SM 9221 E requires the inoculation of sample with a\nseries of 3 dilutions with 5 A-1 media broth-filled tubes\nper dilution (15 total tubes). These tubes are placed in\nan incubator for 3 hours at 35.0\xc2\xb10.5oC for 3 hours,\nthen transferred to another incubator at 44.5\xc2\xb10.2oC for\n15 hours. The tubes are then visually analyzed for\nchange in clarity to determine the end result in\nMPN/100mL. Inoculating the 15 tubes per sample is\ntime-consuming to the laboratory personnel. Following\nthe two-step incubation process is also cumbersome,\ncompared to the one-step process. In addition, a method\nblank per batch is required for this method, as well as a\nduplicate sample to be run per 10% of total samples\nanalyzed.1\n\nConclusion\n\n$39.96\n\n$8.82\n\n$31.14\n\nThe Colilert*-18 costs of materials for a single test 1 Quantitray ($1.73 ea), 1 sample bottle ($0.60 ea)\nand 1 reagent snap pack ($5.41 ea) are $7.54.3\nVELAP accreditation requires each lot of purchased prepared medium to have a verified appropriate\nresponse by testing with known positive and negative control cultures. Colilert*-18, however, does not require either of the\naforementioned quality controls that 21 SM 9221 E requires (duplicate sample and method blank), although it does recommend a\nduplicate sample.2 The cost of quality control for one test, using this method, is $0.33. This estimate\ntakes into account the cost of performing quality control on the amount of Colilert*-18 snap packs to\nperform 200 tests. The cost would be reduced, per test, with larger orders.\nThe time required to perform the setup of one sample for analysis has been estimated to be 3\nminutes for Colilert*-18. Again, this time varies between analysts. The estimated labor cost, based\non $19/hr, is $0.95.\n\nEPA Accreditation Steps\n1.\n\nInitial demonstration of laboratory capability\n\n2.\n\nProficiency Testing\n\n3.\n\nQC check: Positive and Negative\n\n4.\n\nTesting actual wastewater samples: Side-by side testing\nof Colilert*-18 and approved 40 CFR Part 136 method\n\nCitations and Notes\n1Method\n\non seven representative effluents, with QC check of one\n\n9221 E, Standard methods for the examination of water and waste water, 22nd edn.
