Since the Earth's current human population is stressing the environment and the resources off-Earth are relatively unlimited, by as soon as 2040 more than one thousand people could be living in Earthorbiting artificial-gravity habitats. Eventually, the majority of humanity may live in artificialgravity habitats throughout this solar system as well as others, but little is known about the longterm (multi-generational) effects of artificial-gravity habitats on people, animals, and plants. In order to extend life permanently beyond Earth, it would be useful to create an orbiting space facility that generates 1g as well as other gravity levels to rigorously address the numerous challenges of such an endeavor. Before doing so, developing a ground-based artificial-gravity facility is a reasonable next step. Just as the International Space Station is a microgravity research facility, at a small fraction of the cost and risk a ground-based artificial-gravity facility can begin to address a wide-variety of the artificial-gravity life-science questions and engineering challenges requiring long-term research to enable people, animals, and plants to live off-Earth indefinitely.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160001103, "id": "0ec5323bd3c44a4bac71c8ad4ffc8b18", "publicationDate": "2015-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160013852, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "An Artificial-Gravity Space-Settlement Ground-Analogue Design Concept", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160001103.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160001103/downloads/20160001103.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160001103/downloads/20160001103.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160001103/downloads/20160001103.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
