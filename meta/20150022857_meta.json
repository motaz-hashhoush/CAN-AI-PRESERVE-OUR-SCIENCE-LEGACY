This renders preflight training and countermeasure development difficult, as a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach is inappropriate. Therefore, it would be highly advantageous to know ahead of time which crewmembers might have more difficulty adjusting to the novel g-levels inherent to spaceflight. This information could guide individually customized countermeasures, which would enable more efficient use of crew time and provide better outcomes. The principal aim of this work is to look for baseline performance metrics that relate to locomotor adaptability. We propose a novel hypothesis that considers baseline inter-trial correlations, the trial-to-trial fluctuations (\"noise\") in motor performance, as a predictor of individual adaptive capabilities.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150022857, "endDate": "2016-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Space Biomedical Research Inst.
