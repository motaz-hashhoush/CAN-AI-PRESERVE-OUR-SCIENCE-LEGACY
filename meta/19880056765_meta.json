The costs are compared to the cost of shipping the same volatiles from earth, assuming the use of nuclear powered mining facilities and freighters. Mineral resources and possible products from the Martian moons, possible markets for these products, and the costs of transporting these resources to LEO or GEO or to transportation nodal points are examined. Most of the technology needed to mine the moons has already been developed. The need for extraterrestrial sources of propellants for ion propulsion systems and ways in which the mining of the moons would reduce the cost of space operations near earth are discussed. It is concluded that it would be commercially viable to mine the Martian moons, making a profit of at least a 10 percent return on capital.", "title": "The economics of mining the Martian moons", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T16:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880056765, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Leonard, Raymond S."}, "organization": {"name": "Ad Astra, Ltd.", "location": "Santa Fe, NM, United States"}}, "id": "2446b02edb4f4eb4b008c6293ae73625"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880056765, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Blacic, James D."}, "organization": {"name": "Los Alamos National Lab.", "location": "NM, United States"}}, "id": "e74c135a46ad441493550bbee073a1fb"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880056765, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vaniman, David T."}, "organization": {"name": "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "location": "NM, United States"}}, "id": "fcc00a41805f441f96635011a42e74b5"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880056765, "endDate": "1987-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA and Space Studies Institute"}}, "meetingId": "9b93b6eff968402cb6fcc849fb6d5517", "id": "1811ad7ec9b94c799c4881e3abe987c7"}], "name": "Space manufacturing 6 - Nonterrestrial resources, biosciences, and space engineering", "location": "Princeton, NJ", "id": "9b93b6eff968402cb6fcc849fb6d5517", "startDate": "1987-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880056765, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880056765, "id": "dc613acb18fa4a3e82fea6b481436181", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
