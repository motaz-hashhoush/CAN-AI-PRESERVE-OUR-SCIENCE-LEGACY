b'Robotics Offer Newfound Surgical Capabilities\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nA\n\nnyone who has ever worked on a car\xe2\x80\x99s engine\nor tried to fix a sink knows the frustration of\ntrying to perform precision work in a hard-toreach place. Imagine how that sense of frustration might\nmagnify when, instead of trying to wrap the head of a\nwrench around a leaky nut under the kitchen counter, the\nscenario involves conducting repairs on the International\nSpace Station while floating nearly 200 miles above Earth.\nTo ease this frustration, NASA funded work on autonomous robotic devices that would be able to retrieve tools\nand even crew outside of the station.\n\nPartnership\nBarrett Technology Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts,\ncompleted three Phase II Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) contracts with Johnson Space Center.\nIn 1989, the company worked with NASA on a Phase II\nto create a robotic arm, and in 1991, was again awarded\na Phase II to create a hand. Nearly a decade later, the\ncompany was awarded a third Phase II for further\nminiaturization of the components that comprise the\nrobotic devices.\n\nProduct Outcome\nBarrett has developed and commercialized three core\ntechnologies that trace their roots directly back to the\nSBIR work with NASA. The first is a robotic arm, the\nwhole-arm manipulation (WAM) system; the second is\na hand that functions atop the arm, the BH8-Series; and\nthe third is a motor driver that the company refers to as\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe puck,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is similar in shape to a hockey puck, but\none-tenth the size.\nThe SBIR work with NASA led to the development\nof the first commercially available cable-driven robot, a\ndistinction that earned Barrett a place in the \xe2\x80\x9cGuinness\nWorld Records\xe2\x80\x9d book as the world\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced\nrobotic arm. Designed for applications that require\n46\t\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\n\t\n\nsuperior adaptability, programmability, and dexterity,\nthe WAM can reach around large objects and grasp them\nwith its arm links like huge fingers, while conventional\nrobotic arms are restricted to hand end-effectors, and\nthus restricted to grasping smaller objects. The WAM has\nother advantages over traditional robotic arms, in that it\nuses gear-free cables to manipulate its joints, allowing it to\nfeel and control subtle forces.\nThe arm consists of a shoulder that operates on a\ngearless differential mechanism, an upper arm, and a\ngear-free elbow, forearm, and wrist. This arrangement of\njoints coincides with the human shoulder and elbow, but\nwith much greater range of motion. Like a person\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\nbut unlike any industrial robotic arm, the WAM Arm is\nbackdriveable, meaning that any contact force along the\narm or its hand is immediately felt at the motors, supporting graceful control of interactions with walls, objects,\nand even people. With a human-scale 3-foot reach, it\nis so quick that it can grab a major-league fastball, yet\nso sensitive that it responds to the gentlest touch. The\nWAM Arm is available in two main configurations, fourdegrees-of-freedom and seven-degrees-of-freedom, both\nwith human-like kinematics. Internally protected channels allow the user to pass electric lines and fiber optics\nrequired for custom end-effectors and sensors.\nThese characteristics make it ideal for myriad applications, including in space, where use of robots is often safer\nthan people, in manufacturing, and in medicine.\nRecently, an adaptation of the WAM has been cleared\nby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use\nin a minimally invasive knee surgery procedure, where\nits precision control makes it ideal for inserting a very\nsmall implant. Barrett Technology licensed the arm\nto MAKO Surgical Corporation, of Fort Lauderdale,\nFlorida, for use in the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ckeyhole\xe2\x80\x9d orthopedic\nsurgery procedures.\nThe company uses small titanium knee implants\ninstead of the more common and more traumatic totalknee replacement, thus limiting surgery to only the\n\nThe BarrettHand is a multifingered programmable grasper\nwith the dexterity to secure target objects of different sizes,\nshapes, and orientations.\n\ndiseased part of the bone. These surgeries, however,\nrequire an array of complex implant shapes to cover the\nvariety of disease patterns and bone geometries. To insert\nthese devices, surgeons generally cut small pockets into\nthe diseased bone with a high-speed, hand-held cutting\ndevice. While lacking in robotic precision, this technique provides the surgeon with the tactile sensation of\nthe cutting, which in turn provides a wealth of intuitive\ninformation about the diseased bone that is not available\nfrom preoperative X-rays.\nSpinoff 2008\n\nand compact form, it is totally self-contained. Plus,\ncommunicating by industry-standard serial communications, integration with any robotic arm is fast and\nsimple.\nThe BarrettHand BH8-Series neatly houses a CPU,\nsoftware, communications electronics, servo-controllers,\nand four brushless motors. Of its three multijointed\nfingers, two have an extra degree of freedom with 180\ndegrees of synchronous lateral mobility supporting a large\nvariety of grasp types.\nBarrett\xe2\x80\x99s Ultra-Miniature Puck Brushless Servo\nElectronics Module, or \xe2\x80\x9cPuck,\xe2\x80\x9d is the world\xe2\x80\x99s smallest\nand most power-efficient, high-performance servomotor\ncontroller. It is based on the work done with NASA, as\nwell as grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and\nthe National Science Foundation (NSF). Barrett has been\nshipping the Pucks in all of its robotic WAM Arms for\nthe past 3 years, because the device offers several distinct\nadvantages: the absence of a controller cabinet improves\nreliability and portability; the incredibly low power\nconsumption (an order of magnitude less than any other\narm in its class) increases safety and portability, while\nalso making the device \xe2\x80\x9cgreener;\xe2\x80\x9d and the ultra-high\nbrushless-servo performance enables applications such as\nforce-field-enabled medical surgery.\nWhile the Puck is not currently available outside the\nWAM Arm today, Barrett has applied for NSF funding to develop features to make this module universally\nadaptable within 3 years to a wide range of brushlessservomotor applications. v\nThe BarrettHand offers unmatched versatility, programmability, and ease of integration with commercial robotic arms, including\nthe Barrett WAM Arm.\n\nThe WAM-based technologies combine the best of a\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s intuition and a robot\xe2\x80\x99s precision through active\nhaptics (touch sensing). The WAM Arm improves the\nprecision of the implant pockets while still allowing the surgeon to feel bone condition. Matching pocket and implant\ngeometries minimizes trauma, ensures secure implant\nretention, and optimizes resulting joint functionality.\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\nLike the WAM Arm, the BH8-262 BarrettHand\noffers many benefits in dexterity. A multifingered\nprogrammable grasper, the BarrettHand can pick up\nobjects of different sizes, shapes, and orientations.\nAccording to the company, integrating this device\nimmediately multiplies the value of any arm requiring\nflexible automation. Even with its low weight (1.18kg)\n\nWAM\xe2\x84\xa2, BarrettHand\xe2\x84\xa2, and Puck\xe2\x84\xa2 are trademarks of Barrett\nTechnology Inc.\n\nHealth and Medicine \t 47\n\n'
