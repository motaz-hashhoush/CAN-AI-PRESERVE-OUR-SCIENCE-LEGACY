The Chinese anti-satellite test in January 2007 and the accidental collision of two spacecraft in February 2009 created more than 4000 new cataloged debris, representing an increase of 40% of the official U.S. Satellite Catalog. The frequency of collision avoidance maneuvers for both human space flight and robotic operations is increasing along with the orbital debris population. However, the principal threat to space operations is driven by the smaller and much more numerous uncataloged debris. Although the U.S. and the international aerospace communities have made significant progress in recognizing the hazards of orbital debris and in reducing or eliminating the potential for the creation of new debris, the future environment is expected to worsen without additional corrective measures.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100004498, "endDate": "2010-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "18db57b617db49c7827e0db33d4fb103", "id": "3f4190172f254e27ac499f2890aecfd0"}], "name": "33rd Annual Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "18db57b617db49c7827e0db33d4fb103", "startDate": "2010-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100004498, "id": "5e4ec19a81a041359807073202f740ab", "publicationDate": "2010-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100004498.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100004498/downloads/20100004498.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100004498/downloads/20100004498.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100004498/downloads/20100004498.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
