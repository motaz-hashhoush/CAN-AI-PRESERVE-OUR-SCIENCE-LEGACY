INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Foreword\nThis report updates and expands the Solar Array Flight Experiment/Dynamic Augmentation Experiment\n(SAFE/DAE) brochure report, released in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 1985. Since the 1985 brochure report\npresented the results of a preliminary study of flight data, results contained herein supersede that previously\nreported. The Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC) SAFE final Report [ I ] is an additional source of\ninformation pertaining to the experiment. The LMSC report is broader in its coverage of the SAFE design, thermal\nanalyses, and postflight inspections. This report provides a broader and more indepth coverage of solar cell module\nelectrical performance and the structural dynamics experiments.\n\nB. Background Information\nIn September 1984, NASA tested the Solar Array Flight Experiment/Dynamic Augmentation Experiment\n(SAFE/DAE) on Shuttle mission STS41D. This testing qualified advanced solar array and large space structures\ntechnologies applicable to a variety of future space missions. This report discusses these new technologies and\nprovides a review of the SAFE/DAE design, flight operations, and flight results.\nThe principal component of the SAFE/DAE was a large, lightweight solar array wing designed for retraction\nas well as deployment operations in space. Both operations were accomplished by means of a foldhnfold method of\nsolar cell panel deployment. Compared with the Skylab solar arrays (launched in 1973), that were similar in size,\nthe SAFE solar array had the following unique features:\na) Approximately 1/8 the weight\n\n- Enables\n\nmore payload to be carried per shuttle launch.\n\nb) Retractable as well as deployable - Facilitates repair or replacement of the solar array in orbit.\nc) Deploymenthetraction to an intermediate position - Exposes only the amount of solar array needed to\nthe space radiation environment, thereby reducing degradation and providing for increased lifetime; accommodates\nmission operations with higher spacecraft accelerations.\nd) Restowage to survive docking and landing loads as well as launch loads - Facilitates on-orbit docking\nand return to Earth for testing and refurbishment.\nThe lightweight characteristics of this solar array technology led to the need for experimental testing in\nspace. Since elaborate test fixtures are required in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity to support the wing in any configuration, except\nfully retracted, deployment/retraction capabilities could fully be proven only by testing in space. Similarly, the\n\ndynamic behavior of the deployed \xe2\x80\x99wing in space could not be determined with confidence through ground evaluations. For these reasons and because future NASA missions could benefit from this technology, the Office of\nAeronautics and Space Technology (OAST) made the decision in 1977 to test a full scale wing as an experiment\naboard the Shuttle.\nThe objectives of SAFE/DAE were as follows:\na) To demonstrate the readiness of large area, lightweight, photovoltaic array technology.\nb) To demonstrate the capability to deploy and retract such arrays in the space environment.\nc) To measure the electrical and thermal performance of advanced solar cell modules for comparison with\npredictions.\nd) To measure the deployed wing dynamics for comparison with analytical model predictions.\ne) To demonstrate advanced methods for data acquisition, reduction, and analysis of the dynamics of large\nspace structures.\nThe STS-41D mission accomplished these objectives when it provided for 18 hr of testing and test data.\nAfter the flight, the SAFE hardware was returned to Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC) for inspection\nand tests to determine the effects of space operations. The results of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)\nanalyses and the LMSC inspection and tests are reported herein.\n\nII. SOLAR ARRAY FLIGHT EXPERIMENT (SAFE) DESCRIPTION\n\nA. SAFE Wing\nThe SAFE wing design was developed to achieve a specific performance of at least 30 W/lb (66 W/kg).\nWeight reductions were achieved by using thin polymer films and composite materials throughout the design. However, in order to reduce program costs, these materials were used in wing hardware only in those elements where\ntechnology readiness for fabrication, handling and performance needed to be established. A weight summary for the\nSAFE is provided in Table 1 . The \xe2\x80\x9cas-built\xe2\x80\x9d wing design is given in the discussion that follows.\nThe SAFE wing (Fig. I ) is a flat-fold flexible substrate solar array, sized to output more than 12.5 kW at the\nbase of the wing at 55\xc2\xb0C normal to the Sun in near-Earth space. The array blanket consists of 84 panels, 0.37 m x\n4.0 m (14.5 in. X 13.1 ft) in size, that are mechanically hinged together to allow easy replacement of panels. Only\ntwo of the 84 panels have active solar cells. The third panel from the outboard end of the blanket contains two active\nsolar cell modules (Fig. 2). One module employs 8-mil thick 2 cm X 4 cm silicon solar cells with 6 mil covers. The\n704 cells in this module are electrically connected, 4 in parallel X 176 in series. The other module is made with\n150 each, 8-mil thick 5.9 cm x 5.9 cm silicon solar cells in series. For cost reasons, there was not an attempt to\nmaximize packing factor (cell area t panel area) on these modules. All the cells on this panel have wraparound contacts and are welded to a printed circuit copper interconnect system that is encapsulated between two each 1-mil\nthick Kapton sheets with high temperature polyester adhesive. A third module, which is located on the first panel\nfrom the outbooard end, employes 2-mil thick, 2 cm x 2 cm silicon cells with 3-mil covers. This module contains\n\n2\n\n80 cells connected four in parallel by 20 in series. The interconnect system is welded to contacts located on the top\nand bottom sides of these cells. A 2-mil thick Kapton sheet serves as the substrate for these cells. Additional details\nare given in Table 2. The remaining 82 panels in the blanket use cell size glass mass simulators, cell size aluminum\nmass simulators, and 7.5 cm X 17.5 cm aluminum mass simulators. The simulators are bonded to 2-mil thick\nKapton panels.\nTABLE 1 .

The box cover\nemploys a graphite-epoxy structure with aluminum honeycomb to demonstrate methods for reducing weight. The\nmast (Fig. 3 ) is a coilable longeron lattice structure using fiberglass-epoxy longerons and battens with steel diagonal\ncables. The longerons in the outboard 1 1/2 bays of the mast, which are not required to coil even when fully retracted,\nare made of aluminum to carry the forces required to preload the blanket in its containment box during retraction and\nstorage. Microswitches, located in the mast canister, work in conjunction with actuators on the mast to select 70\npercent or 100 percent wing deployment positions. The mast, built by AEC-Able Engineering Co., Inc., is driven\nby redundant brushless DC motors acting through a differential. The mast motor drive assembly is built by Aeroflex\nLaboratories.

SAFE Wing Support Structure\nA wing support structure which provides mechanical interface with the Shuttle integration support structure\nis shown as a part of the Experiment Package in Figure 4. It also serves as a mount for the data acquisition system\n(DAS) box and the SAFE tape recorder, and it has provisions for separating the wing with the remote manipulator\nsystem (RMS) arm, should the wing fail to retract to a safe reentry configuration. Figure 5 is a view of the OAST\npayload, comprised of the SAFE/DAE and the Solar Cell Calibration Facility (SCCF), in the shuttle cargo bay\naboard STS-41D. The SAFE wing is located approximately 20 ft from the crew compartment.\n\nC. SAFE Data Acquisition System (DAS)\nThe DAS includes the experiment instrumentation, the signal processing to convert analog data to 8 bit PCM\ndata, and a tape recorder to record these data during on-orbit experiment operations. The experiment contol,\npower distribution, and pyrotechnic initiator circuits (PICs) are a part of the DAS. The PICs facilitate wing release\nfor separation should it become necessary.\n\nFigure 3. SAFE extension mast and canister.\n\nThe main elements of the SAFE extension mast are 3 fiberglass-epoxy longerons approximately 110 ft long that were coiled into or uncoiled from the mast canister during retraction/\nextension operations. The canister is approximately 15 in. in diameter by 5 ft in length.\nRedundant, brushless DC motors operating through a differential gear box provide the driving force for mast operations.\n\n7\n\nX\n\nACCELEROMETERS\n\nFigure 4. Experiment package.\nThe experiment science instrumentation consists of five thermistors, six low-"g" accelerometers, and solar\ncell module voltage and current monitors. One thermistor per module measures the temperature of the back surface\nof the three active solar cell modules. The other two thermistors are used to measure the temperatures of the cells on\nthe 2 cm X 4 cm and 5.9 cm x 5.9 cm modules. In this way, temperature gradients through the substrate are\nestablished. Figure 4 shows the location of the accelerometers. Three are located at the base of the wing for measuring X, Y , and Z accelerations. Accelerometers for measuring X and Y motions of the end of the wing are located on\nthe array cover near the mast tip. Torsional acceleration is detected by an accelerometer oriented in the X direction\nnear the end of the cover. Voltage and current (IV) data are obtained for each of the three active solar cell modules by\nswitching them through eight resistive load points. Internal voltages and mast motor current are also measured. The\nOrbiter supplemented the DAS by providing closed circuit TV (CCTV) coverage of test operations and onboard\ndisplay and downlinking of selected SAFE data.\n\n8\n\n. . . . . .\n\n@ SCCF\n\n@ ELCTRONICS\n\nPACKAGE, DAE\n\n0\n\nRETROREFLECTOR\nFIELD TRACKER\nDAE\n\n4\n\nRMS GRAPPLE\nFIXTURE\n\n@\n\nSAFE WING\n\nFigure 5 .

OAST-1 was located approximately 20 ft from the AFD bulkhead. Three (3) satellites were successfully deployed before OAST-1 test operations were conducted.\n\n9\n\nThe experiment control circuitry interfaces with the Orbiter aft flight deck (AFD) standard switch panel.\nSwitch commands on the panel operate relays in the DAS box to control 28 VDC power to the DAS electronics,\ncomponent heaters, tape recorder, mast motors, and the PICs. Displays on the switch panel and a TV monitor near\nthe panel provide the experiment operator with the status of the experiment hardware. The PICs are separate and\nredundant and can utilize both primary and auxiliary orbiter power. Electrical interfaces with the experiment are at\nconnectors on the DAS box.\nThe experiment tape recorder is a Lockheed Electronics Company Mark V, Type 4200. It employs 450 ft of\nhigh temperature tape and will record for 6 hr.\nA more detailed description of the SAFE wing, wing support structure, and data acquisition system are\ngiven in Reference I .\n\nD. Photogrammetry\nAs part of the SAFE, the Shuttle television cameras were used to gather photogrammetric data on the\ndynamic motions of the structure. Sixty-three white circles, approximately 16.5 cm (6.5 in.) in diameter, are\nlocated at regular intervals on the front of the blanket. Another 63 circles are located at the same positions on the\nback of the blanket. The Shuttle CCTV system monitored and recorded the relative motion of these targets in\nresponse to controlled excitations of the deployed structure. Cameras located near the four comers of the cargo bay\nwere used, with diagonally opposite camera pairs focused on the same position of the blanket to obtain stereoscopic\nimages for photogrammetric analysis. These data were analyzed after the flight to determine the wing dynamics and\nto verify photogrammetric utilization of television cameras and recorders as a remote sensing system.\nThe Langley Research Center report [2] provides a detailed description of the photogrammetry hardware,\nanalysis methodology, and flight results.\n\n111. DYNAMIC AUGMENTATION EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe DAE is an adaptation of a multifield star tracker that was designed to determine the dynamic characteristics of the SAFE wing during special SAFE wing dynamics tests. A retroreflector field tracker (RFT) (Fig. 5 ) ,\npositioned near the base of the wing, uses laser diodes to illuminate 23 targets on the wing. Ball Aerospace Systems\nDivision contracted with MSFC to develop and provide the RFT. The targets are made of retroreflective tape placed\non small aluminum supports. Sixteen (16) of these targets are located on the back of the blanket (Fig. 6). As the\nblanket flattens during deployment, these targets stand off the blanket surface to provide the best reflective angle.\nFour targets are located on the wing mast, two on the containment box cover and one on the tip fitting of the mast.\nThe targets retum the emitted energy to a receiver in the RFT that focuses the reflector images on a solid state\nsensor. The sensor samples the image position in the focal plane, and a microprocessor computes the position of the\ntargets. A second microprocessor computes the dynamic array displacement from the line of sight and provides a 12\nbit digital output, through a PCM multiplexer, to a digital tape recorder. The data are recorded and returned for\nground processing. The PCM multiplexer, tape recorder, and a Power Conditioning and Distribution Assembly are\nlocated in the DAE Electronics Package (Fig. 5 ) .\n\n10\n\nFigure 6. DAE retroreflector targets.\n\nTwenty-three (23) retroreflectortargets for the DAE were located on the SAFE wing. A tape\nmade by 3-M Company served as the retroreflective element. The picture was taken, using\na flash camera and a darkened room, with the SAFE wing in its horizontal test fixture at\nLMSC.\n\n11\n\nIV. FLIGHT OPERATIONS\n\nA. Overview\nThe flight test timeline allotted approximately 23% hr for SAFE/DAE testing over a three-day period.\nIncluded were extension/retraction testing, dynamic testing, and solar cell module performance testing. As\ndescribed below, test operations proceeded without difficulty, facilitating testing in addition to that timelined to be\nconducted.\n\nB. Extension/Retraction Testing\nFour extension/retraction cycles had been identified by the investigators as being required to demonstrate\nthe capability of the wing to extend and retract and gather supporting data. Orbiter TV cameras, located on the cargo\nbay bulkheads, and the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm and video tape recorders (VTRs), located in the aft\nflight deck, were used to gather data. Postflight studies of the unfolding/refolding actions of the blanket and mast\noperational characteristics were performed to determine the capabilities of this technology and identify potential\nimprovements.\nPrior to flight of the experiment, an analytical model of the deployed array was developed and used in\nresponse analyses to predict the solar array dynamic response to a specific Orbiter Vernier Reaction Control System\n(VRCS) firing sequence. The parameter values used in the analytical model were determined or verified by onground testing to the extent possible or practical. Stiffness of the extension mast and mast canister interface compliance were verified by both static and dynamic testing. The tension in guidewires and blanket tension mechanisms\nwere determined by functional tests, but only in ambient temperature. Shear stiffness of the blanket was verified by\na coupon test. Weight distribution was determined by weighing individual parts, major assemblies, and the total\nsystem.\nSince the adequacy of the analytical dynamic model could not be determined until dynamic tests had been\nconducted in space, it could not be determined with sufficient confidence prior to flight that the orbiter could be\nmaneuvered between attitudes, with the wing extended, without exceeding the mast longeron bending moment\ncapability. For this reason, the flight plan called for the wing to be retracted whenever the orbiter performed attitude\nmaneuvers. As a result, I O extension/retraction cycles were identified in the flight test timeline. However, real-time\nevaluation of the first dynamic test data (down-linked accelerometer data) proved the adequacy of the dynamic\nmodel to predict wing behavior (acceleration, tip deflection, etc .), confirming preflight predictions that mast longeron load capability would not be exceeded with the required orbiter maneuvers. The number of extension/\nretraction cycles needed to accomplish all objectives were therefore reduced to four (Table 3 ) .\n\nC. Dynamic Testing\nEight dynamic tests were specified in the flight test timeline to acquire data necessary to accomplish the\nwing dynamics objective. Four of these tests were scheduled to be conducted during the daylight periods at approximately orbital noon, with the remainder to be conducted after midnight during dark periods. Accelerometers and\nphotogrammetry were used to gather dynamics data during daylight, while accelerometers and the DAE were used\nduring periods of darkness.\n\nTABLE 3.

Scientific and \xe2\x80\x9chousekeeping\xe2\x80\x9d data were obtained for all the test\nevents. The SAFE data system had an internal elapsed time clock that was used to correlate recorded test data with the mission elapsed time (MET).\n\n13\n\nPredetermined firing sequences of the VRCS provided accelerations to excite the wing extended to the 70 or\n100 percent deployed position in the out-of-plane (orbiter pitch), in-plane (orbiter roll), and multimodal (combination of pitch and roll) modes. These firings were planned to provide adequate displacement of the array for good data\nacquisition, without exceeding the structural capability of the array. Since the first dynamics test proved that the\norbiter could maneuver between attitudes without retracting the wing, time was conserved, enabling 14 dynamics\ntests to be conducted during the mission. As a result of array response being less than predicted during the first two\ntest days, excitation energy was increased to 1.5 its previous level for the third day\xe2\x80\x99s tests. Test cases shown\nrepeated in Table 2 were performed to verify repeatability and to obtain redundant data.\n\nD. Solar Cell Module Performance Testing\nTwo solar cell module performance tests were conducted. In the first, the wing was extended in a solar\ninertial attitude before sunset on orbit 47. The wing remained in this attitude until orbit 49. Performance data were\nrecorded from 5 min before sunrise until 5 min after sunset, during orbit 48.\nIn the second performance test, extension of the wing was begun in a solar inertial attitude about sunrise on\norbit 66. Module performance data were recorded during the extension and for I5 min thereafter. The orbiter was\nthen maneuvered into a gravity gradient attitude for additional SAFE dynamics testing.\n\nV. EXPERIMENT ANALYSES AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nA. Array Extension/Retraction Testing\nTwo methods have been used to evaluate the performance of SAFE mechanical operations: review of flight\ndata and postflight observations of the hardware. Flight data consist primarily of video tapes and still photos. Some\ninformation was derived from the DAE and accelerometer and motor current data. Postflight evaluation consisted of\noperational testing and a visual inspection of all aspects of the array structure. The array was fully deployed in the\nhorizontal fixture at LMSC in January 1985 for this inspection.\nDuring the first on-orbit extension test, which was performed in a tail-to-Earth gravity gradient attitude, a\ngrouping of the unfolding panels at the outboard end of the wing was observed. Nominally, the panels are expected\nto unfold in a uniform accordion manner. As the extension continued, panels were released from the grouping,\nimparting a brief wave motion into the blanket. These effects did not significantly affect other characteristics of the\nextension operations. The time required to extend to the 70 percent position was nominal, taking 9 min and 18 sec.\nMast motor currents were approximately the same as had been observed in ground testing. Later extensions did not\nexhibit the panel grouping effect. In Figure 7, the expected uniform accordian unfolding configuration can be\nobserved. The grouping is believed to have resulted from trace amounts of adhesives that were inadvertently left on\nthe blanket surface during fabrication and assembly of the blanket and storage of the blanket in its compressed state\nfor several months before the flight. Panel-to-panel sticking had been observed in preflight ground testing and\nattempts were made to remove the adhesives when it was encountered. However, it was used extensively in the\nblanket design, and because of its color, was difficult to locate and remove completely. Postflight inspections gave\nno definite reasons for the grouping. It is possible that vacuum and the elevated temperatures experienced in space\nhad a cleaning effect upon the blanket.\nAt times during the flight, a curling of the blanket with the edges toward the mast was observed (Fig. 8). It\nwas always evident in DAE data taken about midnight with the orbiter in a gravity gradient attitude. In this attitude,\nthe active side of the solar array blanket was facing the Earth. Having been in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s shadow for several minutes,\nblanket temperatures were low: solar cell module temperatures ranged from -60\xc2\xb0C to -80\xc2\xb0C.\n\n14\n\nFigure 7. SAFE wing deployment.\nAfter the first extension event, extension/retraction operations exhibited uniform accordianlike unfolding/refolding characteristics. The picture was taken about sunrise through a\nwindow of the Aft Flight Deck with the Orbiter in a solar inertial attitude. A shadow of the\nOrbiter vertical tail member can be seen on the blanket.\n\n15\n\nb\n\nFigure 8 . Curled blanket.\n\nImproper allowances for temperature induced expansion and retraction of the SAFE\nblanket materials sometimes resulted in a curvature of the blanket. This picture was taken\nabout sunset from the Aft Flight Deck with the Orbiter in a solar inertial attitude. A shadow of\nthe Orbiter vertical tail member can be seen on the blanket.\n\nORiGIWAt. P h E tS\nOf POOR QUALtlV\n16\n\n.I\n\nUpon entering sunlight in this attitude, the blanket was observed to flatten (Fig. 9). An STS-41D crew\nmember reported that the blanket became flat in about 10 min. Stabilized temperatures of the solar cell modules\nduring this period were in the neighborhood of 50\xc2\xb0C to 60\xc2\xb0C. All observations of the blanket during the solar inertial\nattitude, with the active side of the blanket toward the Sun, showed the blanket to be curled. Temperatures of the\nsolar cell modules over one orbit in this attitude ranged from approximately -80\xc2\xb0C to approximately 75\xc2\xb0C.\n\n+\n\nReview of the DAE data shows a consistency in curling from one test event to another in the same blanket\ncross sectional view. This consistency does not hold from one cross sectional view to another during the same test\nevent. Maximum depth of the curl, as determined from the DAE views, is 44 cm (17.7 in.). These inconsistencies\nsuggest that the curling of the blanket is caused by some thermal expansion condition or combination of conditions.\nNo thermistors were in place that would measure thermal gradients in the blanket at locations other than on the\nactive solar cell modules. Postflight testing at LMSC [ l ] has indicated that the panel curvature was caused by an\ninadequate thermal expansion gap between aluminum frames and Kapton sleeves, which serve as a stiffening mechanism in the panels that comprise the blanket. The major factors contributing to the inadequacy of the gap are\nKapton shrinkage factors (when exposed to vacuum), not considered in the design, and temperature differences\nbetween the aluminum frames and the Kapton. Preflight thermal distortion analyses assumed the aluminum frames\noperated at the same temperature as the Kapton. Elevated frame temperature relative to the Kapton, when combined\nwith smaller gap due to Kapton shrinkage, caused the panels to curve in the direction observed in flight.\nObservations of visual recorded data (film and TV) indicate a built-in twist in the mast. This twist has been\ndetermined to be 7.8 deg from photogrammetry and DAE data. The twist was known to exist before the flight but\nwas not corrected since it did not cause blanket alignment to fall outside specifications or detract from the wing\nextension/retraction capability.\nOther interesting phenomena that occurred during extensions and retractions of the wing were oscillatory\nmotions of the mast and the blanket. During extensions to and retractions from the 70 percent deployed position, a\nmast oscillation developed and decayed. Accelerometers indicated its peak to be approximately 1 1 ft from the 70\npercent deployed position. During extensions from the 70 percent position to the 100 percent deployed position,\naccelerometers indicated that motion peaked about 4 ft from the 100 percent deployed position. During retraction\nfrom the 100 percent to the 70 percent deployed position, mast oscillatory motion was again observed, but saturation of accelerometer data circuitry prevented determination of the mast length at which maximum motion occurred.\nThese mast motions did not detrimentally affect the unfolding/folding characteristics of the blanket.\n\n4\nDuring all retractions, when the length of the blanket was reduced to approximately 1 ft, visually detectable\nblanket longitudinal oscillatory motion began, grew in amplitude for approximately 20 sec, and then decayed at\nabout the same rate. Calculations, based on video tape coverage, indicate that the frequency was about 0.75 Hz,\nwhich is the rate of mast nut rotations. The amplitude of the motion reached a level at which it appeared that active\nsolar cells or the glass solar cell simulators could be broken. However, postflight examination of cells and simulators did not reveal any additional breakage (cracks) over that which existed before flight. The extension/retraction\ndynamics of the wing has been studied at MSFC and is reported in References 3 and 4.\nThe blanket container, locking system, release system, and tension wire system appear to have functioned\nproperly during the flight. Close inspection of the locking levers, which provide preload to the blanket, revealed\nsome scratches at the entrance to the cam system. These have been attributed to wobble in the mast as it approached\nthe near-closed position. A thorough postflight inspection of the mast revealed no significant structural damage.\nSmall amounts of contamination and discolorations were observed on the outer most panels of the wing. Samples\nwere taken in these areas, analyzed, and determined to be BRAYCO grease from inside the mast containing fine\nparticles from the mast rollers and the inside surface of the rotating nut. In addition, the chemical analysis revealed\nthe presence of a waxy substance in the contamination. The source of the wax was traced to the strands of stainless\nsteel wires used in the diagonal cables of the mast. An inspection of the wing for atomic oxygen interaction effects\ndid not reveal any change. It was concluded that the wing was not flown with its major surfaces perpendicular to the\nvelocity vector sufficiently long for these effects to be detectable by ordinary visual inspection.\n\n17\n\nORlGIWAL PAGE 1\ns\nO f POOR QUALITY\n\nFigure 9.

Dynamics of the Deployed Array\n1. Background. One of the original objectives of the flight experiment was to determine the on-orbit\ndynamic characteristics by test. This was to include determination of natural frequency, modal damping, and mode\nshape of the mast and blanket. Early in the development of the experiment, the decision was made to instrument the\nexperiment with accelerometers at the base of the array and on the containment box cover. From this limited instrumentation, the natural frequency, response of the containment box cover, and the modal damping of the structure could be determined. It was not possible to obtain the mode shape. With the start of the Large Space Structures\n(LSS) Technology program, there was increased interest in performing dynamic testing of a large, very flexible\nstructure in space. The solar array experiment was an excellent structure on which to implement such testing. In\nresponse to this opportunity, the Langley Research Center developed the photogrammetry technique for reducing\nthe modal characteristics of the deployed array. Also, in response to this opportunity, the Marshall Space Flight\nCenter developed the Dynamic Augmentation Experiment which is a different approach for accomplishing the same\nobjective. Both of these experiments were designed to facilitate determination of dynamic mode shapes.\nAn additional source of dynamic data for the wing are photographs of the mast cover, taken from the crew\ncabin with a 35mm Nikon camera and 500mm lens.\nThe end result was that redundant methods of determining the dynamic characteristics of the deployed array\nwere used. Results of the various methods will be shown and compared, where appropriate.\n\n2. Preflight Testing. In order to develop an analytical preflight structural dynamic model of the deployed\narray, as much ground testing of the array was performed as could be considered practical. These tests are described\nas follows:\na. Static Load Tests. Static load tests of a 12-ft segment of the mast were performed. Later a static load\ntest of the total length mast, installed in the canister, was performed with the mast in a horizontal position and\nsupported by a water table. From these tests, the bending and torsional stiffness of the mast were determined, as well\nas the mastkanister interface compliance.\nb. Modal Survey Tests. A modal survey test of the mast, with canister, was conducted with the mast in\na horizontal position and supported along the mast length by long suspension wires. From this test, the bending\nstiffness and mastkanister interface compliance, determined by the static load test, were further verified (only small\ndifferences in the interface compliance were observed). Additionally, the modal damping of the mast was determined. Because of air resistance and complicated support required, the total system, with blanket attached, was not\nground tested.\nc. Functional Tests. Functional tests of the constant force mechanisms, used for keeping the blanket\nand guide wires in tension, were performed for each mechanism separately. Each mechanism had separate\ncharacteristics, and these differences were included in the analytical model.\nd. Blanket Shear Stiffness Tests. A shear test of a section of blanket was performed to determine the\nshear stiffness to be included in the model of the blanket.\ne. Weight Measurements. Components and assemblies were weighed, so that accurate mass\ncharacteristics were available for inclusion in the analytical model.\n\n19\n\n3. Preflight Analysis. A structural dynamic model was developed by LMSC for both 70 percent deployment and 100 percent deployment configurations. These analyses incorporated the results from the various structural tests. The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory performed a space shuttle on-orbit flight control systedsolar array\ndynamic interaction study. The study was basically a response analysis of the solar array wing to the shuttle vernier\nreaction control system. Seventy-two response analysis cases were performed in an attempt to identify the worst\nloading case. Also, the response to the planned test excitations were performed. The most important purpose of\nthese response analyses was to obtain confidence that the load-carrying capability of the mast would not be\nexceeded for any shuttle operation with the solar array extended. Consequently, to be conservative, a damping\nvalue of 0.5 percent of critical was used for all cases. The dynamic test of the mast alone had shown a damping of 1.5\npercent of critical, and dynamic testing of a 9-ft section of similar mast had resulted in approximately 3.0 percent\ndamping, so that the 0.5 percent value was known to be conservative. The second purpose of the response analysis\nwas to predict the response for the planned test configuration. The results of these response analyses were verified\nby independent response analyses, performed by in-house personnel at MSFC and by support contractor personnel\nat JSC.\nIn summary, analyses showed the solar array wing to be capable of withstanding orbital maneuvers and\nstation keeping with the array extended to the 70 percent extension configuration. The attitude control system was\ninhibited when the array was extended beyond 70 percent.\n\n4. Operational Considerations. Fourteen on-orbit dynamic tests were performed. A description of these\ntests is given in Table 4. From the Table, it can be seen that photogrammetry data and DAE data were never taken\nsimultaneously. This was necessary because of the television camera requiring light for operation and the retroreflector field tracker requiring darkness for operation. Accelerometer data were taken for all cases. The Nikon\ncamera was used for two tests. Therefore, there was always at least two methods of taking data for any given test,\nallowing comparison of test results from different data sources.\nThere were observed anomalies that were not reflected in the preflight analysis that should be addressed\nbefore a discussion of test results. When the flight mast was originally manufactured, a twist in the mast was measured to be approximately 6 deg. By selectively replacing diagonal wires, the twist was reduced to less than l deg.\nLater, the outermost bays of the mast were damaged by overcycling that part of the mast. Because of the damage, all\ndiagonals in the outer 16 ft of the mast were replaced. Additionally, eleven diagonals distributed throughout the\nremaining length of the mast were replaced. Due to cost and schedule considerations, the mast twist was not\nremeasured on the water table before flight. Postflight analysis, from DAE experiment data, showed the twist during flight to be 7.8 deg. Since this twist was not included in preflight models, pitch motion of the orbiter did not\ninduce pure, out-of-plane motion in the solar array.\nAnother anomaly was the curved blanket about the longitudinal axis (toward the mast) during darkness and\nshortly after coming into daylight. The curved blanket affected the dynamics of the deployed array, such that\ncomparison of photogrammetry results with DAE results, except in a gross sense, is not warranted. It is very beneficial that dynamic tests were performed in both daylight and darkness, as will become evident in the discussion that\nfollows.\n5 . Flight Data Analyses and Results. This section discusses and compares the three approaches for determining the deployed array dynamics.\n\n1\n\na. Accelerometer Analyses. Figure 4 shows accelerometers located at the base of the mast and on the\ncontainment box cover. For on-orbit dynamics, the accelerometers at the base of the mast were of little value,\nbecause the major acceleration would be at the outer end of the mast. There were three single axis accelerometers on\nthe cover. Two, near the center of the cover, measured X (pitch) and Y (yaw) accelerations. There was also one near\nthe end of the cover measuring X (pitch) acceleration, making it possible to identify torsional motion of the array by\ncomparison of acceleration from the two X measurements. Good data were recorded for all three accelerometers for\nall fourteen tests. These data were recorded on tape and returned to MSFC for analysis.\n\n20\n\nTABLE 4.

The data were filtered of unwanted frequency content, and static bias in the\naccelerometers was removed so that the data could be integrated to provide velocity and displacement values. From\nthe accelerometer data, the following information was obtained: (a) adjusted acceleration time histories; (b) power\nspectral density (PSD) plots for each acceleration time history; (c) displacement time histories, obtained by integrating the adjusted accelerations twice (with assumption that the velocity and displacement were zero at initiation of\ntest); (d) and, finally, modal damping, calculated from the accelerometer PSD\xe2\x80\x99s using the half-power method. It\nwas realized that values obtained from such analyses must be regarded as something less than exact. For example,\nall sources of dynamics information indicate the solar array was not completely at rest at initiation of test, even\nthough the Shuttle vernier reaction control system had been deactivated for 10 minutes prior to start of test. Also, the\nbandwidth in the data reduction was not as small as desirable, but was as small as the recorded data would allow.\n\n21\n\nFrom the PSDs, it was possible to identify up to three modes for out-of-plane excitation, but from multimodal and in-plane excitation, only the primary mode could be identified. This is primarily due to the higher damping for in-plane motion that will be discussed later. Attempts were made to obtain displacement of higher modes by\nfiltering out the lower frequencies, as well as high frequency. The quality of these plots does not warrant publication.\nA typical acceleration plot is shown in Figure 10. For this plot, frequencies are filtered above 3 Hz. The same\ndata are shown in Figure 1 1 , with frequency data above 0.08 Hz filtered. Notice that the plot is much smoother with\nsecondary modal accelerations removed. Figure 12 shows the power spectral density for the first out-of-plane test of\nthe blanket at 70 percent extension. Note that three distinct frequencies are evident. A fourth, less pronounced peak\nat 0.11 Hz, is not fully understood. Figure 13 shows the displacement for the same case with filtering above 3 Hz.\nDisplacement with filtering above 0.08 Hz is shown in Figure 14. Again, the curve is much smoother with secondary modal contribution removed.\n\n0.500EMl\n\nMAST TIP\nACCELERATION\n(MIL-GI\n\n-0.500EtO 1\n\n1\n\n0.000E+00\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI\n\nTIME IN SECONDS\n\nFigure 10.

Provided are test results and\nanalysis results using 0.5 percent (Ref. 5 ) and 5.0 percent (Ref. 6) of critical damping. Preflight response analyses\nwere performed with 0.5 percent damping, in order to be conservative in mast longeron load predictions. A\npostflight analysis was performed using 5.0 percent damping to show the effect on response amplitude.\nIt is noteworthy that there is more coupling of out-of-plane and in-plane motion than predicted in the\npreflight model. The twist in the mast resulted in some modal coupling; also accelerometer readings did not measure\npure X and Y acceleration. For the report, the vector components have not been changed to reflect true X and Y\nacceleration.\nThe natural frequency of the deployed array was consistently higher in darkness than in daylight. The\nchange in frequency is primarily due to the blanket curling phenomenon. A postflight analysis (Ref. 6) was\nperformed to reflect the change in frequency due to mast twist, blanket curl, and both blanket curl and mast twist. A\nsummary of this analysis is given in Table 6. It can be seen that the analysis shows curling phenomenon is the\nprimary contributor to change in frequency between daylight and darkness.\n\nTABLE 5 .

LMSC, in a search for an explanation to this phenomenon, performed a simple approximation analysis to\nshow that if the tension wire reel-out force were greater than the reel-in force by as little as 1.O Ib, then the entire\nkinetic energy would be dissipated in one-half cycle of motion in the free response period. Consequently, a\npostflight test on a single constant torque mechanism was conducted, and the difference in wire tension force\nbetween reel-out and reel-in was found to be about 0.65 Ib. A paper (Ref. 8) prepared by Mr. Earl Pinson of LMSC,\ndocuments this test and was given in the proceedings of the 20th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium.\n25\n\nTABLE 6.

Photogrammetry Analyses. A typical result of photogrammetry triangulation is shown in Figure 15.\nThese are 3-D (3 Dimensional) displacement time histories in the orbiter X, Y, and Z axes that have been developed\nfrom 4 simultaneous 2-D CCTV images. The X axis is along the axis of the orbiter payload bay; the Y axis is in the\nplane of the wings; and the Z axis is perpendicular to the plane of wings.\nAfter the 3-D time histories are obtained, the next major step of the analysis process is application of system\nidentification techniques to determine the dynamic characteristics of the solar array. To obtain some \xe2\x80\x9cquick look\xe2\x80\x9d\nresults from flight test data, standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was applied to the X axis plot from\nFigure 15. These data are from a test at 100 percent extension in which the excitation was chosen to excite the\nout-of-plane bending modes. Figure 16 shows a frequency plot obtained by the FFT analysis. The two frequencies\nclearly identified (0.038 Hz and 0.097 Hz) are very close to the preflight predicted frequencies for the first and\nsecond out-of-plane bending modes. Using the same response curves from Figure 15, a damping factor of 3.3\npercent was calculated using the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA). The ERA system is a time domain\nanalysis technique, developed at Langley Research Center by Mr. Richard S . Pappa and Dr. Jer-Nan Juang.\nDeveloped from principles proposed for use in the controls field, the ERA system constructs an analytical model, or\nrealization, of a structure from measurements of its free-decay dynamic responses. Reference 9 gives a thorough\ndiscussion of the ERA system. Figure 17 shows curves representing various assumed damping factors overlayed on\nthe plot of X axis motion from Figure 15. The important point to note here is that the damping factor calculated from\nflight data is significantly higher than the 0.5 percent factor that was assumed for the preflight predictions.\nAfter the above preliminary determinations, efforts were concentrated on detailed applications of the ERA\nsystem to two tests, one at 70 percent deployment and one at 100 percent deployment, in which excitations were\ndesigned to excite multimodal responses. As an aid in interpreting dynamic responses, the ERA analysis was\nperformed using an ICASE technique, as illustrated in Figure 18. A \xe2\x80\x9cdata window,\xe2\x80\x9d 250 data points wide, was\nestablished from the beginning of the free-decay response. With a sample rate of three samples per second, this\n\xe2\x80\x9cdata window\xe2\x80\x9d is approximately 83 sec long and covers three complete response cycles. An ERA analysis was done\non this data segment, then the \xe2\x80\x9cdata window\xe2\x80\x9d was moved down stream five data points, or approximately 1.67 sec in\ntime, and the ERA analysis repeated. This sequence was repeated until 100 cases were analyzed. Typical results for\na multimodal test at 100 percent deployment are shown in Figures 19 and 20. Figure 19 shows results for motion in\nthe X direction and Figure 20 shows Y direction results. Frequency is shown in the left plot, and zero-to-peak\ndisplacements are plotted on the right. The ordinate is the ICASE number or the number of the ERA analysis case.\nMoving up the ordinate, from ICASE-I to ICASE-100, corresponds to increasing time in the response curves.\nNotice in Figure 19 that a very dominant mode occurs at just less than 0.04 Hz. There are four other frequencies\nidentified, but their maximum amplitudes are much less than the first mode. In Figure 20, the amplitudes are much\nless for the Y direction motions, but the second frequency of approximately 0.06 Hz shows up more clearly.\n\n26\n\nl o a , OP, HRES TEST (6)\nTARGET NO. 2\nMEAN = 801.37 MAX.

Typical results of multiple ERA analyses of out-of-plane\ntests (photogrammetry experiment).\n\nMuch difficulty was experienced in determining reliable damping factors for any but the first mode. This is\nnot surprising when one considers the extremely low frequencies of the solar array dynamic response and the small\namplitudes of the higher modes. Further examination of Figures 19 and 20 indicate that only the first mode appears\nto be even close to an exponential decay. Frequency information for mode 1 has been expanded in Figure 21, with\ndaiiipiiig fzicior replacing displacement in the right hmd plot. Not only i s the frequency seen to increase in time, but\ndamping factor decreases from about 4.0 percent down to near 3.0 percent. These results indicate that the solar array\ndynamic characteristics are definitely non-linear.\nApplication of the ERA system identification technique to the solar array flight data has to date identified\neight specific modes in the dynamic response. They are summarized in Table 7 and compared to preflight analytical\npredictions. Five of the first six modes at 70 percent deployment and three of the first four modes at 100 percent\ndeployment have been identified from data obtained using CCTV photogrammetry measurements. Note that in both\nconfigurations, the predicted first in-plane bending mode has not been identified. In Figures 22 a through h, plots of\neach mode identified from flight test data are compared to the preflight, analytically predicted mode. The figures\nshow an oblique view looking from above the X-Y plane (or the plane of the orbiter wings) and a side view looking\nalong the Y axis in the plane of the solar array blanket, perpendicular to the X axis. Figures 22b and 22g show a view\nlooking along the X axis down the payload bay instead of the side view. The lines at the bottom of the individual\nplots are a stick model representation of the orbiter, between the location of the solar array and the location of the\n\\ ernier control thrusters used for excitation. This stick model plot is not complete in any of the Figures, except the X\na tis views in Figures 22b and 22g.\n\n29\n\n*\n\nrU3\n\nTfi\'klL87.

First, statistical studies were done on the results from the triangulation i.nalyses of a test at 100 percent deployment. Considering 20 targets seen by all four cameras, 1-sigma RMS\ndispla, ement accuracies were calculated from a section of data during the quiescent period, prior to dynamic excitation. Rzsults show that measurement of relative displacement at a distance of 3 1 m away is accurate to better than\n1 .O mm in both X and Y directions. From the same segment of data during the quiescent period, peak to peak\nmotions f targets at the tip of the solar array, 31 m away, were calculated to be I .5 cm (0.59 in.) in the X direction\nand 0.44cin (0.175 in.) in the Y direction. This is a significant result, in that it shows the solar array was not truly\nquiescent prior to dynamic excitations. In fact, all CCTV data that have been reduced to date show some residual\nmotion of thc solar array, during the quiescent period prior to dynamic excitation. No conclusive evidence has been\nfound to identify the cause of this low-amplitude oscillation. It appears that the solar array is being driven by some\nlow-level disturbance such as aerodynamic drag or some small background disturbances from the shuttle orbiter.\nAlthough the relative magnitude of this quiescent displacement is not large, it is important to know it is there since it\ncould affect determinations such as damping calculations of higher order modes where the amplitude is of the same\norder of magnitude as the quiescent displacements.\nc. Dynamic Augmentation Experiment Analyses. Data were obtained on all targets, on all tests, even\nthough some targets were outside of their nominal positions due to the array blanket darkside curvature. The array\nexcitations and data take started near orbital midnight and continued for 12 min.\nThe eighteen targets for the six 70 percent tests each provided X and Y displacement data for a total of 36\ndata samples per test. All 36 data samples were simultaneously evaluated by two different response analysis techniques. Both techniques utilize a time-domain curve fit of the data to obtain the modal damping information, and a\nFast Fourier Transform technique to obtain modal amplitude and phase relationships.\n\n30\n\nTEST 7 TARGET 6Y\n\n.08\n\n.12\n\n.6\nI\n\n0\n\nFREQUENCY.

(Concluded)\n\nThe structural dynamic natural frequencies and mode shapes, both analytical and measured are compared in\nFigures 23a through 23e and Table 8. As noted in the data, the second analytical mode was not able to be extracted.\nThis mode is a lateral response, and significant effort was expended to excite it with in-plane and multimodal tests.\nMode shapes tended to match well, but natural frequencies not only differed, but changed in test from different\nexcitations and during decay from each individual excitation. This phenomenon is characteristic of significantly\nnonlinear structures. The nonlinearity of the structure is illustrated in Figures 24 and 25. Figure 24 is a plot of the\nfirst mode (out-of-plane deflection) natural frequency versus tip displacement for the first DAE test. This test is\nillustrated, because it obtained the maximum tip response of all tests; therefore, providing the largest range of\nfrequency and damping change. At a tip displacement of approximately 2 cm peak-to-peak, the frequency remained\nconstant. The 0.059 to 0.072 Hz frequency change amounts to a 22 percent change. The damping change for the\nsame mode, same test is illustrated in Figure 25. From a tip displacement of 1 I cm single amplitude (SA) to 2 cm\nSA, the damping factor averages about 0.08. For less than 2 cm SA, the factor averages approximately 0.02.\nIn summary: (1) the DAE experiment successfully measured the SAFE solar array dynamic response, even\nunder out-of-design conditions and; (2) four of the first five solar array modal characteristics were successfully test\ndetermined. Additional details describing the DAE, its design, method of operation, analyses, and flight experiment results can be found in Reference 10.\nd. Comparison of Results. Since all photogrammetry data were obtained in daylight, and all DAE data\nwere obtained in darkness, a direct comparison of test results is unwarranted, because of the before mentioned\ncurling phenomenon. However, accelerometer data were obtained for all test cases and can be compared directly\nwith each of the other data sets.\n\nTABLE 8.

Solar array tip displacement versus time\n(Dynamic Augmentation Experiment).\nTable 9 shows a comparison of frequencies obtained from photogrammetry measurement with those from\naccelerometer measurement and preflight analysis. Since these measurements were taken in daylight, the curling\nphenomenon does not affect the frequency. It can be seen from the table that there is good agreement between\nphotogrammetry data and analysis. There is also reasonable agreement with accelerometer results. Because of the\nhigh in-plane damping, the displacement was too small for the photogrammetry technique to be applied. The damping from accelerometer and photogrammetry results was comparable where data from photogrammetry were available. The maximum mast tip deflection from the 100 percent deployed out-of-plane test was determined to be 19.1\nin. from photogrammetry data compared to 18.0 in. from acceierometer data. It should be noted that\nphotogrammetry results show that the frequency increases with time, after excitation, and damping decreases with\ntime, indicating a nonlinear system. Consequently, frequency and damping values are to be taken as average values\nfor the total data taking time. Overall, the comparison of photogrammetry data with accelerometer data and analysis\nis quite close.\nTable 10 shows a frequency and damping comparison of values obtained from DAE measurement with those\nfrom accelerometer measurement, and both preflight analysis and postflight analysis. Postflight analysis values\nincorporated the mast twist and blanket curl that were present during darkness. This accounts for the poor comparison of test results with preflight analysis. DAE data confirm the nonlinearity of frequency and damping reported\nfrom photogrammetry. In reporting frequencies and damping results for DAE, the range of values was provided\nrather than a single value. If one is interested in values at times of large response amplitude, then the smallest\nfrequency value and the largest damping value are applicable. Frequencies from both the accelerometer data and\nDAE data do not match well with the postflight analysis results. This may mean that the model of the curled configuration is not totally accurate, or that there are other phenomena not accounted for in the analysis. The comparison of accelerometer data and DAE data is reasonably acceptable.\n\n39\n\nTABLE 9.

Dynamics Summary. The solar array behaved dynamically, as predicted for out-of-plane excitation\nduring daylight. Differences in response to in-plane excitation and darkness tests have explanations that have been\nsubstantiated by postflight tests and analyses. The on-orbit dynamic tests proved invaluable, both to the understanding of the dynamics of the solar array and to establishment of testing techniques of large space structures.\n\nC. Solar Cell Module Performance Testing\n1 . Flight Data. Current-voltage data were obtained for each of the three active solar cell modules, shown in\nFigure 2. A current-voltage (IV) curve for the 2 cm X 4 cm module is shown in Figure 26. Actual data points (8\neach) are shown as x\xe2\x80\x99s connected by straight lines in the plot. The smooth curve is drawn by using the Hughes\nAircraft Company solar cell model (Report No. SSD 701 35R) and short-circuit current (I,,), open-circuit voltage\n(V,,), maximum power point current (I,,), and maximum power point voltage (V,,). The maximum power point,\nused as an input to the Hughes model, was determined by multiplying current times voltage at each data point to\nobtain a \xe2\x80\x9ctrial\xe2\x80\x9d maximum power; then a curve fit to this trial maximum power point and one data point on each side\nwas performed to determine current as a function of voltage over this range of the curve. The current and voltage\nvalues for the maximum I x V value, determined from the curve fit, were then used in the model as the true I,, and\nVmp.\n\nSome scatter is noted in Figure 26 for the data points on the short-circuit current side slope of the IV curve.\nThis scatter existed for the 2 cm X 4 cm and 5 . 9 cm X 5.9 cm modules and was noticeable in plots for each module,\ndepending upon module temperature and the resulting voltages encountered. Since the amount of scatter was larger\nthan the 1 bit resolution of the data system, an anomaly in the data system was implied. Postflight testing at MSFC\nrevealed that the load circuits for the 2 cm X 4 cm and 5 . 9 cm x 5 . 9 cm solar cell modules shunted a multiple of\n16.6 ma around the current sensing resistors. Since the multiplying factor ( 1 , 2, or 3) was a function of the selected\nload point, current corrections to the IV curve were easily implemented in computerized reduction of the data at\nMSFC. Figures 27, 28, and 29 illustrate corrected IV curves for each of the three modules at quasi-static stabilized\ntemperatures. It can be noted in these Figures that the selection of load points for the 2 cm X 4 cm module was better\nthan for the other two modules.\nPlots of I,, for each of the modules are shown in Figures 3 0 , 3 1 , and 32. The periods of higher current at the\nbeginning and end of each plot result from sunlight reflected off Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. All plots that depict module\ncurrent are corrected for off-pointing errors, in addition to the shunting corrections identified above.\nOpen-circuit voltage plots for each of the modules are shown in Figures 33, 34, and 35. In the early part of\nthe daylight portion of the orbit when the modules were cold, the signal conditioners for the 2 cm X 4 cm cell\nmodule and the thin cell module were saturated, and the true Voc cannot be determined. This condition existed for\nabout 1 min and is depicted by the flat portion (slope = 0) at the top of the curves.\nMaximum power point voltages, at the base of the wing, for the three modules are depicted in Figures 36,\n37, and 38. Figures 39,40, and 41 illustrate the maximum power point currents. The larger scatter observed in plots\nfor V,, and I,, is caused by the insensitivity of power near the maximum power point to voltage/current changes\nand the one bit resolution of the data system. Observation of maximum power in Figures 4 2 , 4 3 , and 44 shows that\nthe larger relative transitions in V,, and I,, do not result in the same magnitude of transition for power when V,,\nand I,, \xe2\x80\x98are multiplied.\n\n41\n\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\n0.9\nl\nn\n\na\n.\n\nz\na\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n60\n\n100\n\nVOLTS\n\nFigure 26.

Analyses were performed to compare actual performance in\nspace with predicted performance, based upon laboratory measurements. Postflight flash solar simulation data,\nfrom tests conducted in the LMSC laboratories, were used as reference data for the 2 cm X 4 cm and the 5.9 cm x\n5.9 cm modules. The postflight data were selected for reference because: (1) it agreed within 1 percent (for Isc) with\nthe preponderance of the preflight data (see Table 1 1); (2) tabular data were available from which to obtain parameter values and make interpolations; (3) ambient rmm temperature was accurately recorded; (4)postflight visual\ninspections revealed no detectable damage. Reference data for the thin cell module were taken from Reference 1 1.\nThese data were used instead of LMSC data, because it was not known whether the LMSC standard solar cell used\nin the flash testing had a matching spectral response to the thin cell module. Slight adjustments of t\'he ground test\ndata for the 2 cm X 4 cm and the 5.9 cm x 5.9 cm modules were made as the result of a check of the LMSC\nstandard cell calibration against a cell that was calibrated aboard the Solar Cell Calibration Facility (SCCF) that\naccompanied the SAFE on the STS41D mission. The SCCF cell had the same essential design characteristics to\nproduce a matching spectral response with the LMSC modules.\nActual versus predicted performance comparisons were made at the output of each module to eliminate the\neffect of power hamess resistance changes with temperature. Changes in the resistances of the three module interconnect systems, as a result of temperature changes, were not taken into effect.\na. Laboratory data analyses. The maximum power at the 2 cm X 4 cm module and the 5.9 cm X 5.9\ncm module terminals was determined by separating out the effects of harness resistance from the postflight LMSC\nflash simulation test data as follows:\n( 1 ) For the power range near the knee of the module IV curve, established for the base of the wing,\nsubtract the power loss in the hamess; i.e. P(modu1e) = P(base) - 12R where P (base) = I X V(base); R = 2.22\nohms at the room ambient temperature.\n\n51\n\nTABLE 1 1 .

Predicted space performance. The operational performance of the modules in space was predicted\nfrom laboratory measured parameters as follows:\n\nThe above symbols are defined in the List of Acronyms and Symbols. Except for K,, parameter coefficients\n(ICmp,KVrnp,Klmp,etc.) are given in Table 12. Temperature coefficients for the 2 cm X 4 cm module and the 5.9 cm\nX 5.9cm module were available from LMSC single cell test data. Temperature coefficients for the thin cells were\ndetermined from Reference 12. K, (0.9954) corrects the LMSC test data for the calibration difference between the\nLMSC standard cell and SCCF cell. Since Reference data for the thin cell module was not LMSC test data, the value\nfor K I in the above equations for the thin cell module was taken as 1 .O.\n\n52\n\nTABLE 1 2. TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENTS, PERCENT/"C\n\nc. Actual space performance. Module terminal performance in space was determined for all three modules, using the same method given in paragraph a above for determining the terminal performance of the 2 cm X 4\ncm and 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm modules from laboratory test data. Harness resistance losses were subtracted from the\nactual space performance measured at the base of the wing. The resistances at operational temperature were determined by analyses to be 2.46 ohms and 1.23ohms for the 2 cm x 4 cm/5.9 cm x 5.9 cm and the thin cell modules,\nrespectively. A point in the orbit, near orbital noon, was selected for performance calculations to minimize the\ncontribution of light reflected from Earth (Earth\'s albedo) upon module performance. The temperatures of the modules were near their highest values at this point, but did not differ much from average quasi-static hot temperatures.\nV,, derived temperatures were used in this analysis because thermistor derived temperatures appeared suspect.\nThermistor temperatures were typically cooler because of a heat conduction path from the thermistor to the rear\nsurface of the cooler cell substrate. Additionally, there was a thermal lag between the cell temperature and the\nthermistor temperature, caused by a thermal resistance between the cell and the thermistor. The 1 bit resolution\ncapability of the data system does however limit the accuracy of the V, derived temperatures to 2.3"C for the 2 cm\nX 4 cm and thin cell modules, and 3.4"C for the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module.\n3 . Actual \'v\'eisus Predicted Perfarmance. Tab!es !3, !4, and IS depict the comparison of actual module\nperformance with predicted performance. It is noted that short-circuit current predictions were pessimistic in all\nthree cases; however, excluding a 1/2 to 1 bit inaccuracy in the data system, the accuracy achieved is probably\ntypical of what is generally experienced because of the difficulties encountered in establishing uniform air-mass\nzero, 1-sun light intensities and current temperature coefficients in the laboratory. Except for the 2 cm X 4 cm\nmodule, power predictions exceeded what was achieved, i.e., 1.7 percent for the thin cell module and 2.5 percent\nfor the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module. Power measured for the 2 cm X 4 cm module exceeded predictions by 1.5\npercent. These deviations are within the 1 bit resolution capability of the data system at the temperature, voltage,\nand current of interest. Using the 5.9 cm x 5.9 cm module as an example, we have:\n\na. For temperature: 3.4"C (1 bit) gives 3.4"C\n\nX\n\n0.43 percent/"C = 1.46 percent.\n\nb. For maximum power voltage: 1.125V (1 bit) divided by 55V = 2.04 percent.\nc. For maximum power current: 0.010 A (1 bit) divided by 1.11 A = 0.9 percent.\n\n53\n\nTABLE 13.

Based on the data\nsystem design, gain and scaling factor inaccuracies are approximately 0.5 percent. Since, on the average, the data\nsystem inaccuracy should be less than 1/2 bit, the average system error for the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module should be\nno worse than 4.4 percent divided by 2\n0.5 percent = 2.7 percent. A similar value would also be determined\nfor the 2 cm x 4 cm and thin cell modules if the same assessment were made for them. Comparing the data system\ninaccuracy with the differences between predicted performance and actual performance, it can be said that performance predictions were good. This statement is based upon predictions being made at measured space temperatures;\nbut for the 2 cm X 4 cm and 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm modules, V,, derived temperatures agree with the LMSC predicted\ntemperatures within 1\xc2\xb0C at the point where module performance predictions were made (Figs. 45,46, and 47). The\naccuracies achieved in the predictions also imply that ground test data and temperature coefficients (Table 12) were\ngood.\n\n+\n\n4. Performance Comparison Between Modules. An interesting comparison to make between modules is\ndegradation in power performance from a given laboratory test condition to a selected pointkondition in orbit. The\nlaboratory test condition was 1 sun, air-mass zero at 28\xc2\xb0C. This requires that maximum power from lab tests for the\n2 cm X 4 cm and the 5.9 cm x 5.9 cm modules be corrected for differences incurred between 16\xc2\xb0C and 28\xc2\xb0C. Using\nthe temperature coefficients from Table 12 and laboratory power performance from Tables 13, 14, and 15, the\nfollowing comparison is made:\nLab Power\n(Watts) at\n28\xc2\xb0C\n\nModule\n2cm\n\nX\n\n4cm\n\n5.9 cm x 5.9 cm\nThin Cell\n\nSpace Power\n(Watts) ( 1\nSun, AMO)\n\nDegradation (%)\n\n89.125\n\n71.225\n\n20.1\n\n80.910\n\n61.272\n\n24.3\n\n4.671\n\n3,639\n\n22.1\n\nDisregarding temperature differences, the degradation in performance for the 2 cm X 4 cm and 5.9 cm X\n5.9 cm modules should be the same. However, the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module operates at a higher temperature (2.3"C\nmeasured/3"C predicted) than the 2 cm X 4 cm module, accounting for about 1 . 1 percent of the difference. The\nremaining difference (3. I percent) could be accounted for by 1 or more of the following conditions:\na) Flight data system inaccuracies.\nb) Fewer points near the knee of the IV curve for the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module makes it more difficult to\naccurately establish the maximum power point. Visual observation of the IV curves (Figs. 27, 28, and 29) for the\nthree modules indicates that the analytical model, used to establish the curves, fits the actual data better on the 2 cm\nX 4 cm and thin cell modules than the 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm module. It can be noticed for the latter module that for a\ngiven current near the knee of the IV curve, model predicted voltage lies below the actual voltage. This condition\ncertainly accounts for part of the difference between the 2 cm X 4 cm and 5.9 cm X 5.9 cm performances.\nc) Inaccuracies in laboratory measurements.\nd) Actual electrical performance differences.\nAssuming the data system accurately measured the power, 0.55 percent of the difference in degradation\nbetween the thin cell module and the 2 cm x 4 cm module can be accounted for by the higher temperature coefficient for the thin cell module.\nTaking these considerations into account, it can be stated that performance in space was reduced from that\nmeasured in the laboratory by a similar amount for the three modules.\n\n55\n\nloo\n80\n\ns\n\n60\n\n40\n\n-\n\nW\n\na\n\n2\n\n2\n0\n\nTHERMISTOR\n\n0\n\nz\n\nMODEL PREDICTION\n\n0\n\nP\nI-\n\nOPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE DERIVED\n\nW\n\nu\n\no\n\nv)\nW\n\nW\n\nU\n\n(3\n\n-20\n\nW\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\n-80\n\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n1600\n\n2000\n\n2400\n\n2800\n\n3200\n\n3600\n\n4000\n\nTIME IN SECONDS\n\nFigure 45.

Another objective of the experiment was\nto determine if degradation in electrical performance of the modules would occur as a result of extension/retraction\noperations. A second performance test (Event 24 in Table 3) was performed after extend to 100 percent, retract\nfully, extend to 70 percent, retract fully, and extend to 70 percent operations were performed. A point in the second\ntest was selected where the open-circuit voltages and short-circuit currents were as close as could be found to the\nearlier condition. This ensured that temperatures and intensity conditions were sufficiently alike to make good\ncomparisons. If degradation in module current-voltage performance occurred under these conditions, it would be\nmanifested in a \xe2\x80\x9cdrooping\xe2\x80\x9d IV curve, typical of increased module series resistance. Open-circuit voltage and shortcircuit current conditions were found for aii three moduies that were equivalent io those aiialyzed i the first\n:\nperformance test. Compare Figures 48,49, and 50 with Figures 27, 28, and 29. Table 16 compares module performances between the two tests. Module performance at the base of the wing was the basis for this comparison. The\ndata given in Table 16 indicate that module performance was not degraded by extension/retraction operations. This\nis further verified by postflight visual inspections and tests that revealed no detectable damage to either of the\nmodules.\n6 . Electrical Performance from Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Albedo. Eight dynamics tests were conducted with the orbiter in a\ngravity gradient mode and the active side of the array blanket facing Earth. These tests were conducted about orbital\nnoon, each taking about 5 min. Since the SAFE tape recorder was on for each of these tests, solar cell module\nperformance data were obtained in addition to accelerometer dynamics data. Short-circuit current for each of the\nmodules was analyzed to obtain data for use in future studies of the effect of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s albedo on power output. Table\n17 summarizes the results of this analysis. The lower performance exhibited by the thin cell module is caused by its\nlocation on the most outboard panel of the blanket. In this location, the thin cell module does not have as large a\nview factor of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface as the other two modules.\n\n57\n\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\n0.9\nv)\n\n2\n6\n0.6\n\nPMp = 58.5 WATTS\nTEMP (Voc DERIVED) = 77.2OC\nGMT:247: 15:00:57\n\n0.3\n\n20\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n100\n\nVOLTS\n\nFigure 48.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Solar Array Flight Experiment/Dynamic Augmentation Experiment was successfully tested during the\nShuttle STS41D mission and all objectives were met. As a result of flight data analyses, the following conclusions\ncan be stated.\na) The unfold/fold method of deploying/retracting large flexible, lightweight solar arrays works well in\nouter space. The SAFE demonstrated the method to be tolerant of off-nominal operational conditions when the array\nwas successfully deployed and retracted under conditions of blanket curl and panel oscillations. These conditions\nare anomalous to array operations and can be eliminated through proper design and testing.\nb) Analyses of dynamic test data show that the array was well behaved dynamically with frequencies being\nclose to predictions. Motion decayed quickly after completion of excitation inputs, which means that the array had\ndesirably high damping values. These results are verified by all three means of measuring dynamic performance:\ni .e., accelerometers, photogrammetry, and the Dynamic Augmentation Experiment.\nc) Measured space electrical and thermal performance of the solar cell modules were close to predictions.\nComparison of preflight, flight, and postflight test results indicates that module performance was not degraded by\nlaunch, space extension/retraction and dynamics testing, or reentry environments.\nd) Both CCTV photogrammetry and the Dynamic Augmentation Experiment were used to remotely\nmeasure solar array dynamic characteristics. The results show both techniques are capable of measuring dynamic\nresponses of large, low frequency structures which cannot be adequately instrumented with accelerometers.\n\nI\n\nRecommendations that can be made as a result of the SAFE/DAE program are as follows:\na) During future developments of flexible, lightweight solar array blankets for space application, (1) conduct thermal-vacuum tests to characterize the susceptibiilty of the blanket to curl in its operational environment; (2)\ndevelop a mast design that will not act as an excitation force for the natural frequencies of oscillation of the deployinghetracting array.\n\nDigital data acquisitions systems in future experiments should utilize at least a IO bit word to improve\ndata accuracy and ease data analyses.\nC)\n\nd) Exercise extreme care in performing solar simulation testing of solar array electrical modules to\nminimize the data scatter inherent therein.\n\n61\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nLockheed Missiles and Space Co.: Solar Array Flight Experiment Final Report.

The SAFE\nwas a lightweight, flat-fold solar array that employed a thin polyimide film (Kapton) as a substrate for the solar\ncells. Extriision/retraction, dynamics, electrical and thermal tests, were performed. Of particular interest is the\ndynamic behitvior of such a large lightweight structure in space. Three techniques for measuring and analyzing this\nbehavior werc employed. The methodology for performing these tests, gathering data, and data analyses are\npresented.\nThe report shows that the SAFE solar array technology is ready for application and that new methods are\navailable to assess the dynamics of large structures in space.\n\n17.
