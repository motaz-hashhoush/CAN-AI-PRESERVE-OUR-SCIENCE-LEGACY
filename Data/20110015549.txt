By mission\ndesign and both ef\xef\xac\x81cient navigation and \xef\xac\x82ight operations during the primary phase of the\nTHEMIS mission from February 2007 to September 2009 (Angelopoulos 2008), the outermost two THEMIS spacecraft P1 and P2 found themselves with fuel reserves suf\xef\xac\x81cient\nto undertake a series of over forty maneuvers, including multiple lunar approaches and \xef\xac\x82ybys, that enabled them to reach and parallel the Moon during trans-lunar injection phases\nfrom October 2009 through September 2010. From October 2010 to January 2011, the two\nspacecraft were in Lissajous orbits at the Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon system that\nstraddled the Moon and were separated by distances on the order of \xe2\x88\xbc20 Earth radii (RE ).\nFrom January to July 2011, their Lissajous orbits were separated by 5 to 20 RE on the same\nside of the Moon. In July 2011 they entered lunar orbits (one prograde, the other retrograde)\nwith separation distances ranging from 500 km to 20 lunar radii (RL ). Note that 1 RE is\n6371 km, while 1 RL is 1737 km.\nObservations from lunar orbit over a such wide range of interspacecraft separations are\nideal for addressing a number of longstanding heliophysics objectives, including de\xef\xac\x81ning\nthe characteristics of reconnection and turbulence in the solar wind and distant magnetotail,\nthe nature of particle acceleration at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bow shock and interplanetary discontinuities, and the electrodynamics of the solar wind\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the Moon. However, by\ncareful optimization of mission parameters, in particular periselene and orbital inclination,\nthe fully-instrumented and fully-functional ARTEMIS spacecraft can also be employed to\naddress a set of planetary research objectives including the composition and magnetization\nof the lunar surface, the effects of electric \xef\xac\x81elds on dust in the vicinity of the Moon, and\nthe structure of the lunar interior. With orbits that will remain stable for over a decade,\nARTEMIS will provide observations of the lunar environment over solar cycle time scales,\noffer measurements that overlap and enhance those of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) missions, and\nprovide crucial solar wind observations for correlative studies with other NASA missions to\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere and ionosphere/thermosphere.\nAngelopoulos (2011, this issue) provides a mission overview for ARTEMIS that summarizes the overall scienti\xef\xac\x81c objectives, orbits, instrumentation, mission and science operations\nthat are expanded upon in individual papers in this compendium. This paper describes how\nthe above mission elements will enable the ARTEMIS team to reach scienti\xef\xac\x81c closure. In\nterms of organization, Sect. 2 describes ARTEMIS planetary objectives while Sect. 3 describes the ARTEMIS heliophysics objectives. Section 4 presents conclusions.\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\n2 ARTEMIS Planetary Science Objectives\nThe Moon holds critical information regarding the origin of the solar system. Because it is\ndevoid of plate tectonics, volcanism and surface-altering atmospheric processes, the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s\nsurface has recorded the 4.5 billion years of solar system history more purely than any other\nplanetary body. Understanding the lunar surface and the strati\xef\xac\x81cation of the lunar interior\nprovides a window into the early history of the Earth-Moon system and can shed considerable light on the evolution of terrestrial planets such as Mars and Venus. The surface is constantly sputtering ions and dust, which then enter and circulate within the lunar exosphere\nbefore escaping into the solar wind. Ions \xe2\x80\x98picked-up\xe2\x80\x99 by the solar wind gain similar velocities but mass-dependent energies as they follow mass-dependent trajectories. ARTEMIS\nwill use its energy-angle spectroscopic capability and its electric and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld sensors to determine the motion, source, composition, and \xef\xac\x82ux of exospheric ions. The surface\nelectric \xef\xac\x81elds that loft and transport dust particles can be remotely sensed using electron re\xef\xac\x82ectometry or measured directly from altitude. ARTEMIS will use its electromagnetic \xef\xac\x81eld\nmeasurements to determine the forces acting on dust populations and cause their acceleration and deposition or loss in the lunar environment.\nApollo-era data indicates that the Moon formed via the impact of a Mars-sized object\nwith the early Earth, and later differentiated into primary crust, mantle residuum, and possibly a small iron-rich core. Radial pro\xef\xac\x81les for the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s temperature and composition,\nand their lateral variability today, hold important clues regarding the history of lunar differentiation. Broadband ( 10 mHz to 10 Hz) electromagnetic sounding will improve our\nknowledge of these state variables for the core, mantle, and crust. The sensitive magnetometers on ARTEMIS will approach the Moon on orbits that bring them, one at a time, to within\n100 km of the lunar surface, i.e. to altitudes close enough to detect the core response to\nvarying external drivers but distant enough to minimize perturbations from crustal anomalies. ARTEMIS also provides sensitive horizontal electric \xef\xac\x81eld measurements from 1\xe2\x80\x9310 Hz\nthat will further enable magnetotelluric investigations.\nFinally, ARTEMIS will use its comprehensive particle and \xef\xac\x81eld sensors to study the interaction of the solar wind with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies. Initial Kaguya observations\nhave already provided signi\xef\xac\x81cant new information on an ion sheath, electron heating and\nsolar wind re\xef\xac\x82ection around magnetic anomalies at 100 km (Saito et al. 2010), but wave\nproperties and solar wind particle \xef\xac\x82ow around the strong \xef\xac\x81eld region remain poorly understood. ARTEMIS will study the magnetic anomalies to infer properties of the ancient, seed\nmagnetic \xef\xac\x81eld and to determine the accessibility of the solar wind to the surface and the effect it has on lunar surface ageing. Electric \xef\xac\x81eld and plasma wave data, together with ion and\nelectron measurements in the vicinity of the mini-magnetosphere and shock-like structures\n(e.g., Halekas et al. 2006a) that form around the crustal anomaly (the \xef\xac\x81rst comprehensive\nplasma measurements attempted at the Moon) promise exciting new science with possibly\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant rami\xef\xac\x81cations for planetary evolution.\n2.1 Exospheric Ions and Plasma Pick-up\nForty years after the \xef\xac\x81rst Apollo landings, the composition and structure of the lunar exosphere remain poorly understood. A number of studies have used ground-based measurements to investigate the existence, extent, variability and likely sources of easily observed\nexospheric species such as sodium and potassium (Potter and Morgan 1988; Tyler et al.\n1988; Mendillo et al. 1991, 1999; Wilson et al. 2003, 2006). However, the behavior of these\nspecies may not be representative of other, more abundant, species (Potter and Morgan 1988;\nFlynn and Mendillo 1993).\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 1 A schematic showing the trajectories of recently picked-up ions and the expected measurements of\nthe \xef\xac\x82uxes (top left) and composition (top right) of the picked-up ions\n\nIn situ measurements of pickup ions offer an appealing complementary means of probing\nsurface and exospheric properties and processes at the Moon (e.g. Hartle and Thomas 1974;\nCladis et al. 1994; Yokota and Saito 2005; Hartle and Killen 2006; Hartle and Sittler 2007;\nSaito et al. 2010). Newly created ions, produced by solar wind sputtering, photostimulated\ndesorption, micro-meteoriod impact vaporization or ionization of exospheric gases are generated at relatively low energies (0.01\xe2\x80\x9310 eV), but immediately feel the effect of solar wind\nmagnetic and electric \xef\xac\x81eld (Stern 1999; Wurtz et al. 2007). The \xe2\x80\x98picked-up\xe2\x80\x99 ions are then\naccelerated in cycloidal trajectories like that shown in Fig. 1.\nIn situ measurements by ion instruments on the space plasma missions AMPTE, WIND,\nand GEOTAIL con\xef\xac\x81rmed the presence of lunar heavy ions far downstream from the Moon\nin the solar wind and in the distant magnetotail (Hilchenbach et al. 1991, 1993; Kirsch\net al. 1997; Mall et al. 1998), but relied on fortuitous con\xef\xac\x81gurations of the solar wind and\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nIMF and were not able to provide comprehensive information on exospheric composition,\nsource rates, or variability. Further, these studies could not distinguish between lunar ions\noriginating at the surface and those created in the exosphere.\nMore recent studies have shown that it is possible to separate the signatures of surface and\nexospheric ions, using measurements made at altitudes smaller than the typical gyroradius\nof newly ionized lunar species. For example, the upper left inset in Fig. 1 shows the result\nof a computation by Yokota and Saito (2005) of the expected differential \xef\xac\x82uxes of Na at\n\xe2\x88\xbc100 km altitudes resulting from both surface sputtering and exospheric photoionization.\nThe surface ions are nearly monoenergetic, while the atmospheric ions spread out in energy\ndue to the extended source and low observation altitude. At higher altitudes, the ions would\nbe accelerated still further, resulting in a much more monoenergetic spectrum and much\nhigher ion energies for both surface and exospheric sources (with little reduction in \xef\xac\x82ux\nunless signi\xef\xac\x81cant scattering occurs in one ion gyroperiod). At distances within two gyroradii\nfrom the source, one may discriminate between ions with different masses by comparing\nobserved energies and gyrophases with those predicted for the cyclical motion shown in\nFig. 1, though distinguishing between surface and exospheric ions becomes more dif\xef\xac\x81cult.\nKaguya \xef\xac\x81ndings have recently advanced our understanding of the solar wind\xe2\x80\x99s interaction\nwith the lunar surface as well as the near-Moon wake. Kaguya\xe2\x80\x99s in situ ion mass spectrometry was used to con\xef\xac\x81rm the presence of Na+ in addition to He+ , C+ , O+ , K+ , and Ar+ in the\nsunlit lunar exosphere at altitudes \xe2\x88\xbc100 km when the Moon was in the solar wind (Yokota\net al. 2009) and Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere (Tanaka et al. 2009). Some ions originated from the\nexosphere, others from the surface. Other species may be present as well. The heavy ion \xef\xac\x82ux\nvaries with solar zenith angle but not with solar wind \xef\xac\x82ux or meteor shower occurrences,\nsuggesting a stable driver for the sputtering process.\nKaguya observations also indicate that from 0.1 to 1% of the solar wind protons incident\nupon the Moon are re\xef\xac\x82ected. Solar wind convection electric \xef\xac\x81elds accelerate some of these\nprotons to speeds triple those of the solar wind (Saito et al. 2008). The pickup ions \xef\xac\x81nd\naccess not only to the high latitude wake, but also areas deep within the low latitude and\nlow altitude wake through fully kinetic processes. Knowledge of the solar wind electric and\nmagnetic \xef\xac\x81elds suf\xef\xac\x81ces to reconstruct observed proton spectra from dayside re\xef\xac\x82ected proton\nsources.\nThe ESA and SST instruments on ARTEMIS will measure the energy and direction of\npickup ion particle distributions, while the EFI and FGM instruments will measure the ambient electric and magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds. With this information, researchers will be able to backtrack\nobserved pickup ions to either surface or exospheric sources. Furthermore, they will be able\nto roughly determine the ion mass, since both the ion energy and the size of the cycloidal trajectories scale with mass. ARTEMIS can therefore use pickup ion measurements to remotely\nprobe the properties of the surface and the exosphere. Measurements from the ARTEMIS\nprobe measuring the lunar exosphere can then be combined with observations from the other\nARTEMIS probe to determine the response of the exosphere to solar wind drivers.\nAlthough ARTEMIS will generally be further away from the Moon than Kaguya, the\nlarge geometric factor of the ESA total ion instruments (a factor of \xe2\x88\xbc10 greater than those\non Kaguya) will enable sensitive measurements of the pickup ions under stable solar wind\nconditions over distances ranging from 100 km to several thousand km from the lunar surface. When applied as a function of lunar phase the technique will determine the dependence\nof the lunar exosphere on lunar longitude undergoing illumination, thereby providing the ion\ncomposition versus selenographic longitude. Since the pickup ion trajectories measured by\nARTEMIS can be back-traced, the latitudinal exospheric ion distribution can also be determined.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nA second method of indirect detection of lunar ions may also be possible using\nARTEMIS measurements. Pickup ions form ring distributions that can generate electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. It may be possible to detect these waves using the ARTEMIS\nvector magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld data. Waves from pickup ions have been identi\xef\xac\x81ed in the plasma environments of many solar system bodies, including Venus, Mars, and even the moons of the\ngiant planets (Russell et al. 1990; Kivelson et al. 1996; Paterson et al. 1999; Grebowsky et al.\n2004; Dougherty et al. 2006; Russell and Blanco-Cano 2007; Delva et al. 2008), and their\npresence or absence can be used to constrain the local density of pickup ions, and therefore\nthe source strength.\nFinally, synergistic measurements made by ARTEMIS and other orbiting spacecraft can\nbe used to constrain exospheric properties. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission carries the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) ultraviolet instrument (Gladstone\net al. 2010), while the upcoming Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE)\nmission carries the NMS for neutral mass spectrometry and the UVS ultraviolet/visual spectrometer (Delory et al. 2009). These missions thus measure gases before ionization, while\nARTEMIS measures them post-ionization. By coordinating ARTEMIS measurements with\nthose from these and other spacecraft, we can greatly advance our understanding of the lunar\nexosphere and its coupling to the surface and the space environment.\n2.2 Surface Charging, Electric Fields, and Dust\nAlthough one might think of the lunar environment as essentially dormant, it is in fact very\nactive electrically. Since the Moon has only a tenuous exosphere and no global magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld, its surface lies directly exposed to the impact of solar UV and X-rays as well as solar\nwind plasma and energetic particles. This creates a complex and dynamic lunar electric environment, with the surface typically charging positive in sunlight and negative in shadow\nto potentials that vary over orders of magnitude in response to changing solar illumination\nand plasma conditions. These potentials have been measured by instruments on the surface\nand by Lunar Prospector in orbit, but we still do not fully understand the near-surface environment, especially the role of secondary and photoemitted electrons, and the structure of\nthe plasma sheath at the surface.\nThe largest observed lunar potentials typically occur on the nightside, in the absence\nof photoemission, where ambient plasma currents primarily drive surface charging (Manka\n1973; Stubbs et al. 2007). Using measurements of the angular distribution of re\xef\xac\x82ected electrons and accelerated secondary electrons from the surface, Lunar Prospector provided estimates of negative nightside lunar surface potentials of \xe2\x88\xbc\xe2\x88\x92100 V or less in the wake\nand magnetospheric tail lobes (Halekas et al. 2002a, 2008c), and occasionally as high as\n\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x80\x934 kV in the magnetospheric plasmasheet (Halekas et al. 2005, 2008c) and during SEP\nevents (Halekas et al. 2007). However, all Lunar Prospector measurements were fundamentally handicapped by a lack of spacecraft potential measurements and the spectrometer\xe2\x80\x99s\nrather coarse electron energy resolution. ARTEMIS\xe2\x80\x99s high resolution full plasma and electric \xef\xac\x81eld measurements will enable researchers to measure lunar surface potentials from orbit accurately and precisely, as well as determine their response to external in\xef\xac\x82uences. The\nexcellent energy resolution of the electron spectrometers on ARTEMIS will also enable a\nbetter understanding of the importance of lunar photoelectrons and secondary electrons, and\nmay allow us to determine whether the potential in the plasma sheath varies monotonically,\nor non-monotonically as suggested by recent simulations (Poppe and Horanyi 2010).\nNear-surface electric \xef\xac\x81elds like those described above can loft micron-sized charged dust\ngrains (Nitter et al. 1998). The horizon \xe2\x80\x98glow\xe2\x80\x99 observed by cameras on the landed Surveyors\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\n5, 6 and 7 at lunar twilight was attributed to sunlight scattering by dust electrostaticallylevitated just above the lunar surface by electric \xef\xac\x81elds at the terminators (Criswell 1973;\nRennilson and Criswell 1974). Astronauts in Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s command module also witnessed\na twilight horizon glow extending 10\xe2\x80\x99s of kilometers above the lunar surface which was\nsuggested to result from surface ejection of submicron grains to high altitudes (McCoy and\nCriswell 1974; McCoy 1976). Lunar Prospector has con\xef\xac\x81rmed the presence of strong and\ndynamic near-surface electric \xef\xac\x81elds that are capable of lofting small charged grains to high\naltitudes (10\xe2\x80\x99s of km) in a dust \xe2\x80\x98fountain\xe2\x80\x99 effect (Stubbs et al. 2006). These near surface\nelectric \xef\xac\x81elds may be strongest at the terminator\xe2\x80\x94the starting location of the lunar wake\n(Farrell et al. 2007).\nThe nature of the wake plasma discontinuity at the terminator remains unknown. Ideally, there should be a \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 plasma discontinuity at the terminator dividing \xef\xac\x82owing solar\nwind plasma from a perfect plasma void. Due to their higher thermal velocities, electrons\nshould migrate into the plasma void further than ions, thereby creating a very large ambipolar E-\xef\xac\x81eld just above the lunar surface. This initial plasma expansion E-\xef\xac\x81eld could drive\ndust transport at the terminator (Farrell et al. 2007). However, plasma discontinuities tend to\ndissipate by radiating plasma waves at group velocities that exceed the speed of the discontinuity. These oscillatory waves and their related ULF/VLF electric \xef\xac\x81elds may diminish the\nambipolar effect and associated dust lofting.\nARTEMIS will examine the wake \xef\xac\x82ank/discontinuity as a function of distance from the\nterminator, providing enough passes under varying solar wind and IMF directions to provide\na unique evaluation of the effectiveness of the ambipolar forces in surface dust lofting. In\nessence, ARTEMIS will cross the discontinuity at various stages of its evolution, providing\ndetailed observations of the plasma expansion and discontinuity dissipation processes. For\nsimilar solar wind and IMF con\xef\xac\x81gurations, the wake \xef\xac\x82ank can be considered time stationary,\nand passages through the \xef\xac\x82ank at various altitudes are equivalent to examining the discontinuity dissipation process as a function of time. The initial plasma expansion process is not\nonly fundamentally new science, but also crucial to understanding surface dust lofting from\nE-\xef\xac\x81elds at the terminator.\n2.3 Internal Structure\nElectromagnetic sounding encompasses a wide variety of inductive methods used to sense\nthe interior of the Earth, the Moon and other planetary bodies (Schuster and Lamb 1889;\nGrant and West 1965; Sonett 1982; Khurana et al. 1998; Simpson and Bahr 2005). Suitable signals for planetary-scale soundings arise from the solar wind, magnetospheres, ionospheres, and lightning, depending on the planetary environment (Grimm 2009). These timevarying electromagnetic source \xef\xac\x81elds induce eddy currents in planetary interiors, whose\nsecondary electromagnetic \xef\xac\x81elds are detected at the surface. The secondary \xef\xac\x81elds shield the\ninterior according to the skin-depth effect, which is exploited by electromagnetic sounding\nby using impedance measurements over a range of frequency to reconstruct conductivity\nover a range of depth.\nElectromagnetic induction studies performed during Apollo gave an indication of the\ndeep electrical conductivity pro\xef\xac\x81le and limited the radius of any strongly conducting core\nto less than about 20% of the lunar radius (e.g, Sonett et al. 1972; Dyal et al. 1974; Hood\net al. 1982; Hood and Sonett 1982). Laboratory conductivity-temperature measurements\nwere used to translate the lunar conductivity pro\xef\xac\x81le to a selenotherm that is roughly equivalent with the background, global heat \xef\xac\x82ow derived by Wieczorek et al. (2006). The outer\n500 km was poorly constrained due to the limited magnetometer bandwidth (higher frequencies are needed to resolve shallower depths).\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\nFig. 2 The ARTEMIS\nspacecraft probe the lunar\ninterior individually by the\nmagnetotelluric method and\njointly using the magnetic\ntransfer function method. The\ninvestigation will provide\nconstraints on core size, on the\ncomposition of the lower mantle,\nand on the nature of\nupper-mantle heterogeneity,\nparticularly the anomalous\nProcellarum KREEP Terrane\n\nIn spite of these advances, signi\xef\xac\x81cant questions remain. The International Lunar Network\nScience De\xef\xac\x81nition Team Report (1998) identi\xef\xac\x81ed three new investigations for electromagnetic sounding: (1) determine the structure of the outer 500 km (upper mantle and crust) that\nmay contain key information on early lunar evolution, speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the extent of the magma\nocean and the origin of major provinces; (2) provide tighter bounds on the conductivity of\nthe lower mantle (500\xe2\x80\x931400 km depth), that may constrain trace amounts of H2 O (Saal et al.\n2008; Grimm and McSween 2009); and (3) determine whether the Moon has a core, and is\nit metal or molten silicate.\nThe fundamental quantity that must be measured in any induction experiment is the frequency dependent electromagnetic impedance Z. The most important constraint is that two\nknown quantities are always necessary (Grimm 2009), e.g., Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s Law Z = V /I . Apolloera lunar studies used the distantly-orbiting Explorer 35 to determine the source magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld, and compared this to Apollo 12 surface measurements that represent the sum of source\nand induced \xef\xac\x81elds. This is the Transfer-Function technique (see Fig. 2). Alternatively the\nMagnetotelluric Method can provide a complete sounding from individual platforms using orthogonal horizontal components of the electric and magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds (e.g., Vozoff 1991;\nSimpson and Bahr 2005; Grimm and Delory 2008). The plane-wave impedances determined\nby the Magnetotelluric Method are extendable to spherical geometry when skin depths become comparable to the planetary radius (Weidelt 1972; see also Schubert and Schwartz\n1972).\nWith these considerations, we have de\xef\xac\x81ned an electromagnetic sounding investigation\nfor ARTEMIS. Transfer Function soundings can be performed when the Moon is in the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail, both probes are in daylight, one probe is near periapsis (\xe2\x88\xbc100 km),\nand the other at least several lunar radii away (including up to apoapsis \xe2\x88\xbc19,000 km). This\nensures that the distant probe measures only the primary \xef\xac\x81eld while the periapsis probe\nmeasures the sum of the primary and secondary \xef\xac\x81elds. Only the \xef\xac\x82uxgate magnetometers are\nnecessary. This geometry contrasts with the free-solar-wind environment used for Apollo\nTransfer Function soundings. Here, the dayside con\xef\xac\x81ning plasma layer would have required\nthe second measurement (primary+secondary \xef\xac\x81eld) to be made at or near the surface, well\nbelow the ARTEMIS periapsis altitude. Measurements with both spacecraft in the wake are\nalso possible, although it may be more dif\xef\xac\x81cult to separate the relevant signals in the hot\ntenuous plasma in this shadowed region, where spacecraft charging may reach extremes.\nThe probe periapses of 100 km restrict the minimum investigation depth to a few hundred km or greater. They may glimpse some upper mantle structure but will certainly probe\nthe lower mantle, especially given that measurements may be made during some tens of\nminutes around periapsis. Close study of \xef\xac\x81eld-line de\xef\xac\x82ection over many periapses passages\nmay be used to detect the core (Russell et al. 1982; Hood et al. 1999).\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nARTEMIS will conduct the \xef\xac\x81rst extraterrestrial tests of the Magnetotelluric Method, using both electric (EFI) and magnetic (FGM) records during periapsis passages. While these\nmeasurements may be possible under a variety of conditions and geometries, they are likely\nbest conducted in sunlight while in the magnetotail. As these are the same conditions favoring Transfer Function soundings, results should be identical: discrepancies will highlight the\nkinds of data processing and/or auxiliary information needed to extract the electromagnetic\npart of the electric-\xef\xac\x81eld.\nWith its 1.5-yr mission at low periapses, ARTEMIS will have both data redundancy\n(signal integration) and geographic coverage around the equator. The ARTEMIS mission\nwill advance our understanding of the deep lunar interior and provide a baseline for nextgeneration lunar and planetary electromagnetic sounding.\n2.4 Magnetic Anomaly Interactions\nMaps for lunar crustal magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds remain signi\xef\xac\x81cantly undersampled and the causes of\nlunar crustal magnetization remain uncertain. Local enhancements in the crustal magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld can shield the lunar surface from space weathering caused by ion sputtering and generate mini-magnetospheres whose effects can be felt far from the lunar surface. ARTEMIS\nwill provide the combination of in situ and remote observations needed to substantially improve our global picture of crustal magnetism and then determine its effects on its immediate\nenvironment.\n2.4.1 Causes of Crustal Anomalies\nPatterns of crustal magnetization preserve a record of planetary evolution. Thermoremanent\nmagnetization in the presence of a dynamo magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld is the dominant process by which\nthe terrestrial crust has been magnetized, as is likely the case for Mars (Connerney et al.\n1999). Alternating \xe2\x80\x98stripes\xe2\x80\x99 of magnetized sea\xef\xac\x82oor crust at mid-ocean ridges were crucial\nin con\xef\xac\x81rming geodynamo polarity reversals and the plate tectonics hypothesis (Vine and\nMatthews 1963; Vine and Wilson 1965). The origin(s) of lunar magnetism are far less certain: lunar sample measurements indicate the possible existence of a lunar dynamo from\n3.6\xe2\x80\x933.9 billion years ago (Cisowski et al. 1983) with an order of magnitude decrease before\nand after that period.\nThere are many hypotheses for the source of the ambient \xef\xac\x81eld and the magnetization process. Steady magnetizing \xef\xac\x81elds of both external (solar or terrestrial) and internal (lunar dynamo) origin have been proposed, as have transient \xef\xac\x81elds generated by impacts (for reviews,\nsee Fuller 1974, and Wieczorek et al. 2006). Thermoremanent magnetization is likely the\ndominant process for igneous lunar samples; however, shock remanent magnetization may\nbe signi\xef\xac\x81cant in lightly metamorphosed breccias, which carry the strongest and most stable\nremanent magnetization of all lunar samples because they contain more metallic iron grains\n(likely produced by meteoritic impacts) (Fuller et al. 1974; Fuller and Cisowski 1987). Mare\nbasalts, on the other hand, contain less nanophase iron and generally have weaker remanent\nmagnetization (Coleman et al. 1972).\nWith samples from only a handful of lunar landing sites, orbital magnetic measurements have been relied upon to study the global pattern of crustal magnetism. Two types\nof data have been used: magnetometer and electron re\xef\xac\x82ection measurements. Magnetometer data provide vector information but are limited by spacecraft altitude and the fact that\nlunar crustal magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds at satellite altitudes are typically very weak: \xe2\x88\xbc2 and \xe2\x88\xbc3 orders of magnitude weaker than the terrestrial and Martian cases respectively (Connerney\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\net al. 2004). Electron re\xef\xac\x82ection measurements invoke magnetic mirroring and use magnetometer observations together with electron energy and angular distributions measured from\norbit to estimate the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld magnitude at the lunar surface (Anderson et al. 1975;\nLin et al. 1976). Electron re\xef\xac\x82ection data have the virtue of being particularly sensitive to the\nweakest crustal \xef\xac\x81elds (Halekas 2003; Mitchell et al. 2008).\nElectron re\xef\xac\x82ection and magnetometer measurements from the Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellites (Hood et al. 1981; Lin et al. 1988) and the Lunar Prospector spacecraft (Hood et al.\n2001; Halekas et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2008) have enabled global mapping of lunar crustal\n\xef\xac\x81elds. However, the map is severely undersampled, with signi\xef\xac\x81cant noise and pixelization\nclearly visible (see Fig. 3), accounting for much uncertainty in geophysical interpretation.\nARTEMIS ESA, with better energy resolution than Lunar Prospector or Apollo, will, along\nwith ARTEMIS magnetometer measurements, enable more accurate correction for the effects of electrostatic potentials between the lunar surface and the spacecraft (Halekas et al.\n2002b; Mitchell et al. 2008) and therefore provide more accurate crustal \xef\xac\x81eld estimates. The\ntwo ARTEMIS probes will make many hundreds of low altitude (<400 km) electron re\xef\xac\x82ection measurements within 10\xe2\x97\xa6 (20\xe2\x97\xa6 if optimized) of the equator on every periselene pass,\nresulting in better spatial coverage and higher \xef\xac\x81delity crustal \xef\xac\x81eld maps in these regions\nthan currently exist.\nExisting maps show weaker \xef\xac\x81elds over the mare basalts compared with the highlands (in\nagreement with the aforementioned sample studies) and reveal that the largest area of strong\ncrustal \xef\xac\x81elds lie in regions diametrically opposed to the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium and\nOrientale impact basins (see Fig. 3). This led to the hypothesis that crustal magnetization\nis associated with basin-forming impacts. According to this hypothesis, the hypervelocity\n(>10 km/s) impacts that form such large basins produce a plasma cloud that expands around\nthe Moon, compressing and amplifying any pre-existing ambient magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld at the antipodal point (Hood and Huang 1991), where the focusing of seismic energy and impact of\nbasin ejecta may result in substantial shock remanent magnetization (Hood and Artemieva\n2008). A key element of this hypothesis is that it does not require a global dynamo \xef\xac\x81eld,\nalthough recently Wieczorek and Weiss (2010) have shown that the simplest explanation for\nsome of the strongest anomalies like Reiner-Gamma involves a steady, dynamo magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld. Better maps enabled by ARTEMIS in the equatorial regions will help to elucidate the\nmechanism of antipodal magnetization by allowing us to better constrain the characteristics\nof the remanent crustal remanent magnetization.\n\nFig. 3 Impact basin rims (white circles, for Imbrium the interior ring is also shown) and their antipodes\n(black circles), superimposed on a map of total surface magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld strength averaged over 5 \xc3\x97 5\xe2\x97\xa6 bins\n(Mitchell et al. 2008)\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nIn summary, the ARTEMIS electron re\xef\xac\x82ection data set will substantially augment existing observations, enabling greater resolution in the equatorial regions and thus more con\xef\xac\x81dent interpretation. In so doing, ARTEMIS will improve our knowledge of the interconnected histories of lunar impacts, basin formation, magmatism and the ancient lunar dynamo.\n2.4.2 Effects of Crustal Anomalies on the Plasma Environment\nThe sub-ion inertial scale lengths associated with crustal magnetic anomalies raise a host\nof questions about the nature of their interaction with the solar wind. Does the solar windanomaly interaction produce a shock? Do the magnetic anomalies shield a region from the\nsolar wind, generating a lunar \xe2\x80\x9cmini-magnetosphere\xe2\x80\x9d that stands off and de\xef\xac\x82ects the solar\nwind (Hood and Schubert 1980; Hood and Williams 1989; Hood 1992; Lin et al. 1998;\nHarnett and Winglee 2000)? Past and current missions have led to great progress on these\nquestions, but ARTEMIS stands ready to add to our knowledge, thanks to its comprehensive\nplasma instrumentation and two-probe design. ARTEMIS offers the unprecedented (at the\nMoon) capability to measure full 3-D plasma distributions and electric \xef\xac\x81elds, allowing better\nunderstanding of the microphysics of the interaction, and to measure the properties of the\nplasma just upstream from the anomaly region, allowing separation of spatial and temporal\neffects. The results may be applicable to other bodies, including Mars (e.g., Breus et al.\n2005), asteroids such as Gaspra and Ida (Kivelson et al. 1995), and possibly Vesta (Vernazza\net al. 2006).\nExplorer 35 and the Apollo subsatellites \xef\xac\x81rst observed the effects of magnetic anomaly\ninteractions near the limb in the form of compressional waves propagating downstream. Lunar Prospector, however, observed the effects extending to \xe2\x88\xbc100 km altitudes, sometimes\nwell upstream (>45\xe2\x97\xa6 ) from the limb and their apparent sources, seemingly requiring the formation of a shock (Lin et al. 1998). The coincident enhancements in the upstream electron\ndensity, electron \xef\xac\x82ux, magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld strength, and whistler mode wave activity upstream\nseen in Fig. 4 all suggest the presence of a shock (Lin et al. 1998; Halekas et al. 2006b,\n2007, 2008b). By contrast, simulations for the solar wind interaction with dipoles with dimensions comparable to lunar anomalies only predict whistler or magnetosonic wakes, not\nshocks (Omidi et al. 2002). Some simulations suggest that the non-dipolar nature of lunar magnetic sources might increase the ef\xef\xac\x81ciency of the interaction (Harnett and Winglee\n2003), perhaps resolving this discrepancy. Also, surface in\xef\xac\x82uences, including secondary\nelectrons, photoelectrons, and dust, may turn out to play a role. To determine whether lunar\nanomalies do in fact form shocks (Halekas et al. 2006a, 2006b), we need the capability of\nARTEMIS plasma instrumentation, which thanks to the spinning spacecraft and spacecraft\npotential measurements, can make precise measurements of bulk properties and anisotropies\nof the 3-D velocity distributions of both electrons and ions.\n2.4.3 Space Weathering: Effects of Crustal Anomalies on the Lunar Surface\nThe Moon, like any other body exposed to the harsh space environment, is subject to galactic and solar cosmic rays, irradiation, implantation, and sputtering from solar wind particles,\nand bombardment by meteorites and micrometeorites. This exposure causes radiation damage, chemical changes, optical changes, erosional sputtering, and heating, all essential parts\nof the process called space weathering. Space weathering is important because these processes affect the physical and optical properties of the surface of many planetary bodies.\nTo properly interpret remote sensing observations, it is critical to understand the effects of\nspace weathering.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 4 Lunar Prospector electron energy spectra, electron density, and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld strength, longitude,\nand power frequency spectra suggestive of a shock\n\nA number of observations suggest that magnetic anomalies can shield the surface from\nthe solar wind, with clear implications for surface weathering, and possible implications\nfor the formation of the lunar albedo markings often observed near strong crustal magnetic\nsources (e.g., Hood and Schubert 1980; Richmond et al. 2005). Lunar Prospector observations of low altitude density cavities above a strong crustal anomaly lend some support\nto this idea (Halekas et al. 2008a). More recent Kaguya observations of ion \xef\xac\x82ow deceleration, electron heating, and no scattered protons above strong crustal anomalies also suggest\nsurface shielding (Saito et al. 2010). Finally, Chandrayaan has provided observations indicating no scattered neutral atoms from the same region discussed by Halekas et al. (2008a),\nstrongly suggesting the existence of a magnetically shielded surface region (Wieser et al.\n2010).\nThe two ARTEMIS probes will enable more observations like those by Kaguya, but\nwith more comprehensive plasma instrumentation, and the ability to compare observations\nupstream and outside of the anomaly region with those inside. This will enable separation\nof temporal and spatial effects, and allow researchers to clearly determine how the anomaly\ninteraction affects the incoming solar wind \xef\xac\x82ow, including whether and how electrons and\nions de-couple near anomalies, what mechanisms produce electric \xef\xac\x81elds, and the nature and\ndistribution of particle heating and wave-particle interactions.\n\n3 ARTEMIS Heliophysics Science Objectives\nARTEMIS will address the host of heliospheric science objectives illustrated in Fig. 5. Topics include reconnection, particle acceleration, and turbulence in the magnetotail and interplanetary space, and the structure and evolution of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s plasma wake. This section\npresents a selection of topics to be considered as a function of location in orbit: addressing\nsuccessively the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail, the solar wind, and the lunar wake.\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 5 ARTEMIS heliophysics scienti\xef\xac\x81c objectives address topics including reconnection, particle acceleration, and turbulence in the solar wind and Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail and the formation and evolution of the lunar\nwake\n\n3.1 In the Magnetotail\nThe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail comprises two lobes with oppositely directed magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds divided by an equatorial current sheet embedded within a plasma sheet marked by enhanced\ndensities and temperatures but depressed magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld strengths. Conditions within the\nnear-Earth magnetotail are relatively well-understood, thanks in large measure to the multipoint measurements returned by the THEMIS mission. By contrast, \xef\xac\x82eeting glimpses of the\ndistant magnetotail by the Explorer-33 and -35, ISEE-3, Geotail, and Wind missions have\nraised numerous questions that can only be answered by examining extensive multipoint in\nsitu observations. Potential research topics include the structure of the distant magnetotail\nduring prolonged intervals of northward IMF orientation, the length, shape, and occurrence\npatterns for reconnection lines at lunar distances, the evolution of the heated and accelerated \xef\xac\x82ows ejected by these reconnection lines, the shape, dimensions, internal structure,\nand evolution of antisunward-moving plasmoids and \xef\xac\x82ux ropes, boundary waves on the surface of the magnetotail, and the nature of turbulence within the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail plasma\nsheet.\nARTEMIS will provide the observations needed to address these questions. Together\nwith the Moon, the two ARTEMIS spacecraft will spend about 4.5 days of each 28-day\norbit about the Earth within the magnetotail at lunar distances, and 20 to 30 hours per\norbit within the plasma sheet (Hapgood et al. 2007). With interspacecraft separation distances ranging from 500 km to 20 RE , the two spacecraft will be well situated to determine\nnot only the steady-state macrostructure of the distant magnetotail, but also the meso- and\nmicro-scale characteristics of the superimposed transient events as a function of solar wind\nconditions.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\n3.1.1 Structure of the Magnetotail\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst question to be addressed concerns the structure of the distant magnetotail during\nprolonged intervals of northward IMF. Magnetosheath momentum imparted to the magnetosphere drags magnetospheric magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines antisunward to form the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail. During periods of southward IMF orientation, this momentum is imparted via the\nreconnection of magnetospheric and interplanetary magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines on the dayside magnetopause. Theory predicts, and observations con\xef\xac\x81rm, that the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s polar caps lie on open\nmagnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines leading to interplanetary space during intervals of southward IMF orientation (Dungey 1961). The situation during periods of northward IMF (NBZ) remains\nunclear. Reconnection on the dayside equatorial magnetopause ceases, terminating the production of open magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines. Reconnection within the magnetotail continues, transforming open lobe into closed plasma sheet magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines. The likelihood of dual lobe\nreconnection, which also closes open lobe \xef\xac\x81eld lines while appending magnetosheath magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines to the magnetosphere, increases. The magnetotail may become topologically\nclosed during prolonged NBZ periods.\nObservations from low altitude polar orbiting spacecraft like DMSP can be used to infer\nthe polar cap size, the amount of open \xef\xac\x82ux in the lobes, and whether or not the magnetotail ever closes. Low-altitude observations indicate that the size of the open magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld\nline region within the polar cap slowly diminishes during periods of strong and persistent\nnorthward IMF (Newell et al. 1997). However, spacecraft may fail to enter the polar caps\nwhen their size diminishes, resulting in a mistaken interpretation that they are absent. Furthermore, their identi\xef\xac\x81cation can become more dif\xef\xac\x81cult during extended NBZ periods because the characteristics of the precipitating particles used to identify their boundaries may\nchange. In the absence of clear predictions for the shape and geometry of the magnetotail\nand its plasma and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld characteristics during NBZ periods, in situ observations\nof the magnetotail have also generally been inconclusive. A chance Wind encounter with\na strongly deformed and twisted magnetotail some 125 RE from Earth during an extended\nNBZ period on October 22\xe2\x80\x9324, 2003 indicates an open magnetotail; albeit one with highly\nunusual plasma and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld properties (\xc3\x98ieroset et al. 2008).\nGlobal numerical models for the magnetosphere predict strikingly different magnetospheric topologies during NBZ periods. Many predict magnetospheres that close near Earth,\nas envisioned by Axford and Hines (1961). Others predict closed magnetospheres that extend much further, perhaps in response to viscous momentum transfer enhanced by the\nKelvin-Helmbholtz instability (Miura 1984). Predicted lengths for the closed magnetotails\nvary from as little as \xe2\x88\xbc30 to several hundred RE (Usadi et al. 1993; Watanabe and Sato 1990;\nOgino et al. 1992; Fedder and Lyon 1995; Gombosi et al. 1998; Guzdar et al. 2001). However, not all models predict tail closure during NBZ periods. Raeder et al. (1995) presented\nidealized simulations of a NBZ period where the tail stayed open for several hours. In fact,\nRaeder (1999) argued that the prediction of a closed tail in most numerical MHD models\nwas due to excessive numerical diffusion, a point discussed in further detail by Gombosi\net al. (2000) and Raeder (2000).\nFigures 6 and 7 present Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) predictions for the size and shape of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail during the October 22\xe2\x80\x9324, 2003\nWind event. The width of the magnetotail diminishes with distance downstream, but an open\nmagnetotail that \xef\xac\x82aps dawnward and duskward is still present at lunar distances. Torques applied by the IMF twist the magnetotail, causing the southern lobe to shift northward at dusk\nand the northern lobe to shift southward at dawn (e.g., Sibeck et al. 1985)\nARTEMIS will provide the observations needed to determine the size, shape, and internal structure of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail as a function of independently measured solar\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 6 OpenGGCM simulation predictions for the component of the plasma velocity along the Sun-Earth\nline during the October 22\xe2\x80\x9324, 2003 strong NBZ event. Magnetotail widths diminish steadily with distance\nantisunward\n\nFig. 7 OpenGGCM predictions for sunward (red) and antisunward (blue) magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld polarities within\nmagnetotail cross-sections 60 RE from Earth at 20:00 UT on October 22, 2003 and 04:00 UT on October 23,\n2003. The magnetotail is severely twisted and deformed\n\nwind and geomagnetic conditions, during both northward and southward IMF orientation.\nTwo point ARTEMIS measurements will aid in determining the orientations of the various boundaries and the characteristics of their \xef\xac\x82apping motions. One of the two ARTEMIS\nprobes will frequently monitor magnetosheath conditions immediately outside the distant\nmagnetotail magnetopause while the other measures (e.g.) electron pitch angle distributions at the magnetopause and deeper within the magnetotail, the key information needed\nto reveal magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld line topology and history in those regions (Hasegawa et al. 2005;\n\xc3\x98ieroset et al. 2008). Multi-season and multi-year observations will permit researchers to\ntest whether dual lobe reconnection for northward IMF orientations becomes more ef\xef\xac\x81cient\nwhen the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s dipolar tilt diminishes (Li et al. 2008).\n3.1.2 Plasmoids and Flux Ropes: Reconnection Within the Near-Earth Magnetotail\nAs illustrated in Fig. 8, bursts of reconnection along extended lines in the near-Earth magnetotail release immense antisunward-moving \xef\xac\x82ux ropes, or plasmoids, that carry vast quantities of plasma and magnetic \xef\xac\x82ux antisunward through the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s plasma sheet. Spacecraft\nin the vicinity of the plasma sheet may directly enter the plasmoids, while spacecraft within\nthe magnetotail lobes record perturbation signatures known as traveling compression regions (TCRs). In conjunction with Geotail, Cluster, and baseline THEMIS observations of\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 8 Reconnection at an x-line in the near-Earth magnetotail results in dipolarizations of the magnetospheric magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld and releases enormous plasmoids that move antisunward through the magnetotail.\nWhen separated transverse to the axis of the magnetotail, ARTEMIS probes P1 and P2 will be well-situated\nto determine the dimensions, shape, and internal structure of the plasmoids\n\nthe near-Earth magnetotail, and employing its own observations separated by 1\xe2\x80\x9310 RE along\nthe Sun-Earth line, ARTEMIS will provide the observations needed to determine the internal\nstructure of plasmoids and track their evolution down the magnetotail.\nPlasmoid dimensions are a crucial factor in determining their signi\xef\xac\x81cance to the solar\nwind-magnetosphere interaction. Plasmoid diameters increase by a factor of 2\xe2\x80\x933 from neartail to lunar distances (Ieda et al. 1998), but the reasons for this growth remain unclear.\nPart of the growth results from expansion in response to lower ambient pressures in the distant magnetotail, part may be due to continued reconnection at reconnection lines moving\ndown the magnetotail with the plasmoids, and part may be due to the coalescence of smaller\nplasmoids to form larger plasmoids as they are transported tailward. The cross-tail extent\nof plasmoids remains unknown. Although plasmoids in the distant magnetotail often exhibit force-free structures, their magnetic topology remains uncertain. Magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines\nwithin plasmoids may be closed loops, connected to Earth, or connected to the interplanetary\nmedium.\nAzimuthal probe separations of 1\xe2\x80\x9310 RE will enable ARTEMIS to determine the crosstail extent, orientation, and shape (using minimum variance analyses of the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld)\nof plasmoids. Radial separations will provide the observations needed to determine how\nrapidly plasmoid diameters change with distance downstream (e.g., Slavin et al. 1999).\nGrad-Shafranov reconstruction techniques (Hasegawa et al. 2004) will be used to determine\nthe plasma and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld structure within the plasmoids from time series measurements\nand an assumption that they are in near pressure balance with their immediate environment.\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\nFig. 9 Reconnection along an\nextended and curved line in the\ndistant magnetotail. Because the\nline demarcates the boundary\nbetween sunward (Earthward)\nand antisunward \xef\xac\x82ows, its\nlocation can be determined when\nARTEMIS probes P1 and P2 are\nradially separated. By contrast,\nits extent can be determined\nwhen the two spacecraft lie\nseparated transverse to the axis of\nthe magnetotail\n\nHigh time resolution ARTEMIS measurements of multiple pitch angle distributions during\nevents with anticipated time durations ranging from 100 to 200 s will not only offer an\nopportunity to determine their magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld topology, but also to test predictions concerning reconnection-related electron energization in contracting magnetic islands (Drake et al.\n2006).\n3.1.3 Occurrence Patterns for Reconnection in the Distant Magnetotail\nBy contrast to the situation in the near-Earth plasma sheet, where reconnection associated with geomagnetic substorms is often bursty and patchy (Baumjohann et al. 1989,\n1990; Angelopoulos et al. 1992), ISEE-3, Geotail, and Wind observations of long-duration\nreconnection-heated plasma jets suggest that reconnection in the distant magnetotail plasma\nsheet is often quasi-steady and large-scale. As illustrated in Fig. 9, reconnection may occur\nalong curved reconnection lines whose cross-tail extent depends upon the IMF orientation\n(Feldman et al. 1985; Nishida et al. 1995; Angelopoulos et al. 1996; \xc3\x98ieroset et al. 2000).\nIn the absence of multi-point measurements, we do not know either the conditions favoring\nlocalized and extended reconnection in the distant magnetotail or the shape of the reconnection line. Two-point ARTEMIS observations enable both the occurrence patterns of reconnection and its extent across the lunar magnetotail to be determined as a function of guide\n\xef\xac\x81eld strength, geomagnetic, and solar wind conditions.\n3.1.4 Heating, Particle Acceleration, and Plasma Transport at Distant Reconnection Lines\nThe plasma sheet within the distant magnetotail is an excellent location to study magnetic\nreconnection. By contrast to the near-Earth magnetotail, there is no heating in response to\n\xef\xac\x82ow braking against the dipolar magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines. Furthermore, the \xef\xac\x81nite mantle densities in the distant magnetotail mean that plasma parameters in the in\xef\xac\x82ow region can be\nbetter characterized than they would be in the very tenuous near-Earth magnetotail. Topics\nfor investigation by ARTEMIS include the process(es) by which reconnection heats plasmas, particle acceleration in reconnection geometries, and the subsequent motion of the\nreconnected plasma.\nThe degree to which reconnection heats ions, and the factors controlling this heating,\nare presently not known. Results from some recent simulations suggest that the heating is\nproportional to the speed of the out\xef\xac\x82owing Alfv\xc3\xa9nic jets, which are in turn related to the\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nAlfv\xc3\xa9nic velocities of the in\xef\xac\x82owing plasma (Drake et al. 2009). The two ARTEMIS spacecraft will provide numerous opportunities to simultaneously compare in\xef\xac\x82ow and out\xef\xac\x82ow\nparameters.\nParticles can be accelerated to suprathermal energies by drifting along X-lines, but also\nby Fermi-acceleration in the collapsing bubbles that surround O-lines (Hoshino et al. 2001;\nDrake et al. 2006). Wind observations of a single event in the distant magnetotail (at\nXGSE = \xe2\x88\x9260 RE ) provide evidence for electron energization to at least 300 keV (\xc3\x98ieroset\net al. 2002). Two-spacecraft ARTEMIS observations of plasma \xef\xac\x82ows and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld\ncomponents normal to the current sheet are essential to discriminate between (and track the\nmotion of) X-lines and O-lines. ARTEMIS will provide the previously unavailable high resolution plasma and electric \xef\xac\x81eld measurements needed to determine the causes for electron\nenergization.\nSteady reconnection in the distant magnetotail should eject high-speed plasma \xef\xac\x82ows\nand energized particles both Earthward and away from the Earth. The occurrence patterns\nand extents of distant magnetotail reconnection lines will be determined from two-point\nARTEMIS observations of the Earthward (antisunward) streaming energetic particles in the\nplasma sheet boundary layer, sunward (antisunward) \xef\xac\x82ows, and northward (southward) magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld components in the current sheet expected sunward (antisunward) from the reconnection line. There are indications that most of the sunward plasma jets from the distant tail\ndo not reach the near-Earth plasma sheet (e.g., \xc3\x98ieroset et al. 2004). Working in conjunction\nwith the three inner THEMIS spacecraft, Cluster, and Geotail, ARTEMIS will establish the\nrelationships between plasma \xef\xac\x82ows in the lunar and near-Earth plasma sheet to determine\nthe fate of reconnection jets generated in the distant tail. The results will help distinguish\nbetween models in which the \xef\xac\x82ows are decelerated and/or de\xef\xac\x82ected towards the \xef\xac\x82anks.\n3.1.5 Boundary Waves, Flux Transfer Events, and Turbulence in the Magnetotail\nThe Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability may play an important role in transferring solar wind\nmass, momentum, and energy into the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail (Fujimoto and Terasawa 1994;\nMiura 1984, 1992), perhaps dominating the overall solar wind-magnetosphere interaction\nduring intervals of northward IMF orientation when reconnection shuts down on the dayside magnetopause. The instability is most likely along the low-latitude \xef\xac\x82ank magnetopause,\nwhere and when \xef\xac\x82ow shears lie nearly perpendicular to weak northward magnetosheath and\nmagnetospheric magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds (Southwood 1968). As illustrated in Fig. 10, the amplitudes and wavelengths of waves generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability should grow\nFig. 10 Illustrating the expected\nevolution of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability\nfrom a linear stage on the dayside\nmagnetopause to a nonlinear\nstage on the \xef\xac\x82anks of the distant\nmagnetotail\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nwith downstream distance. The waves may merge into larger vortices (Miura 1997), perhaps\nwith steepened trailing edges (Chen and Kivelson 1993). They may also generate fast-mode\nshocklets (Lai and Lyu 2006) or induce turbulence (Matsumoto and Seki 2007). Simulations\nthat include the effects of coupling with the ionosphere and/or the tail lobes indicate that \xef\xac\x81nite plasma sheet thicknesses may suppress the nonlinear growth of the instability (Galinsky\nand Sonnerup 1994; Takagi et al. 2006).\nObservations indicate that the KH instability is relatively common on the \xef\xac\x82anks of the\nnear-Earth magnetotail, occurring for the predicted solar wind conditions and exhibiting the\nexpected signatures (Fair\xef\xac\x81eld et al. 2000; Hasegawa et al. 2006). The structural properties\nof the KH waves are similar on the dawn and dusk \xef\xac\x82anks of the near-Earth magnetosphere\n(Hasegawa et al. 2006; Nishino et al. 2011). However, non-MHD processes that depend\non the polarity of the \xef\xac\x81eld-aligned vorticity could lead to dawn-dusk asymmetries further\ndownstream (Nakamura et al. 2010).\nAlthough the distant magnetotail magnetopause is constantly in motion, and this motion\nhas occasionally been attributed to the KH instability (Sibeck et al. 1987), little is known\nabout the properties of the instability at downstream distances beyond 30 RE . ARTEMIS\nwill provide the simultaneous two-point observations of magnetosheath and magnetosphere\nneeded to test instability criteria and determine the velocities, amplitudes, and wavelengths\nof the resulting boundary waves. Both the two-point observations, and comparisons with simultaneous Cluster and Geotail traversals of the near-Earth magnetopause, will help determine whether waves breakup, coalesce, expand, stabilize, or simply propagate downstream.\nThe same two point observations will be examined for evidence of KH-generated reconnection, diffusion, turbulence, shocklets, and dawn/dusk asymmetries (e.g. Chaston et al.\n2007).\nObservations on the dayside and near-Earth \xef\xac\x82ank magnetopause reveal the presence of\ntwisted ropes of interconnected magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines\nmarked by transient magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld strength increases and bipolar magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld signatures\nnormal to the nominal magnetopause. Interpreted as \xef\xac\x82ux transfer events or FTEs, the \xef\xac\x82ux\nropes provide evidence for the frequent occurrence of unsteady reconnection at the magnetopause (Russell and Elphic 1978; Raeder 2006). The signi\xef\xac\x81cance of the events to the overall solar wind-magnetosphere interaction remains to be determined. If entirely disconnected\nfrom the ionosphere, the events may simply advect antisunward with the magnetosheath\n\xef\xac\x82ow, maintaining their orientation and helical magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld geometry, and represent nothing more than an interesting curiosity. However, if one end of the \xef\xac\x82ux ropes remains anchored in the ionosphere while the other extends into interplanetary space, the events may\naccount for a signi\xef\xac\x81cant transfer of solar wind mass, energy and momentum to the magnetosphere. In this case, the \xef\xac\x82ux ropes will stretch out parallel to the Sun-Earth line and\nsink into the magnetotail lobes (Sibeck and Siscoe 1984). Two-point ARTEMIS measurements will help determine event motion, orientation, length, and topology at lunar distances,\nthereby providing crucial information concerning their role in the solar wind-magnetosphere\ninteraction.\nTurbulent dissipation is an effective mechanism for heating \xef\xac\x82uids and transferring mass,\nmomentum and energy. Although turbulence is ubiquitous in space plasmas, much remains\nto be determined concerning its initiation and subsequent evolution. Turbulence in the nearEarth plasma sheet has been studied using Cluster (Weygand et al. 2007). The dissipation\nrange was on the order of the ion inertial lengths or gyroradius (\xe2\x88\xbcfew hundred km) and\nthe correlation coef\xef\xac\x81cients diminished to zero beyond scales of 3 RE . Flow \xef\xac\x82uctuations\nwere small relative to the sound and Alfv\xc3\xa9n speeds (except during dynamic conditions).\nBy contrast, \xef\xac\x82ow \xef\xac\x82uctuations are comparable to the sound and Alfv\xc3\xa9n speeds in the distant\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nmagnetotail and therefore dynamically and energetically important. Theory and simulations\npoint towards magnetotail reconnection and velocity shears at the \xef\xac\x82anks as likely drivers\nof plasma sheet turbulence. Both drivers can affect energy circulation and particle transport\nwithin the magnetosphere. Characterizing the nature of the \xef\xac\x82uctuations, and determining\ntheir origin and dissipation is therefore important for global circulation. It is quite likely\nthat the distant tail also exhibits an inertial range of turbulence. ARTEMIS will use varying\ninterspacecraft separation distances to characterize turbulence over a wide range of spatial\nscales.\nARTEMIS may also observe turbulence at the distant magnetotail magnetopause. During\nperiods of northward or nearly radial IMF orientation, reconnection on the high-latitude and\n\xef\xac\x82ank magnetopause results in high speed antisunward \xef\xac\x82ows in a boundary layer of open\nmagnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines disconnected from Earth. High-latitude reconnection can continue for\nhours under northward IMF conditions (Frey et al. 2003; Hasegawa et al. 2008). The distant\nhigh-latitude magnetopause is an ideal region to study turbulence in reconnection out\xef\xac\x82ows.\nBy contrast to the dayside magnetopause, the effects of Alfv\xc3\xa9n waves re\xef\xac\x82ected from the\nionosphere need not be considered. And by contrast to the near-Earth plasma sheet, the\nresistance of the dipolar magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld region need not be addressed. ARTEMIS will determine whether or not a quasi-steady inertial range of turbulence is attained as a result of\nenergy injection via reconnection. The two-point measurements permit estimations of the\nwavelength (instead of or in addition to the frequency) of the associated waves (Chaston\net al. 2008). A spacecraft in the magnetosheath can provide information about the nature of\nmagnetosheath turbulence and whether conditions favor high-latitude reconnection, thereby\nhelping discriminate between the effects of magnetosheath and reconnection-induced turbulence.\n3.2 In the Solar Wind\nTogether with the Moon, the ARTEMIS spacecraft will spend most of their orbit about the\nEarth in the solar wind. Here ARTEMIS provides a unique opportunity to address longstanding questions concerning the physics of the foreshock, interplanetary shocks, reconnection\nin the solar wind, and plasma turbulence. In particular, ARTEMIS will be used to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 examine how the bow shock, and collisionless shocks in general, accelerate particles to\nhigh energies;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 study the structure of interplanetary shocks, and examine how non-planar structure can,\nfor example, in\xef\xac\x82uence the production of type II radio emission;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 explore reconnection in the solar wind, and provide the high time resolution measurements required to understand low magnetic shear reconnection, which recent measurements suggest predominates in the heliosphere.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xef\xac\x81ll in the gaps in our knowledge of solar wind turbulence by providing cross- observations\nof solar wind features from spacecraft separated by previously inaccessible interseparation distances of 11,000\xe2\x80\x9350,000 km.\n3.2.1 Shock Physics\xe2\x80\x94Particle Acceleration in the Terrestrial Foreshock\nIn addition to mediating the \xef\xac\x82ow of super-magnetosonic plasma, collisionless shocks also\nact as sites for particle acceleration (see, e.g., reviews by Terasawa 2003; Burgess 2007).\nIf the upstream magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld is not perpendicular to the shock normal, then a portion of\nthe in\xef\xac\x82owing plasma can escape back into the upstream region rather than being processed\nby the shock; the interaction of this backstreaming component with the in\xef\xac\x82owing plasma\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nleads to wave generation and particle acceleration (Eastwood et al. 2005). The way in which\ncollisionless shocks produce energetic particles is a problem of extremely broad astrophysical importance. The Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bow shock/foreshock is one of the best laboratories we have for\nstudying in-situ the basic physical processes that govern shock particle acceleration (Burgess\n2007).\nDiffusive shock acceleration (Axford et al. 1977; Bell 1978a, 1978b; Blandford and Ostriker 1978) is widely cited as the process by which ions are accelerated to high energies\nat shocks. At the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bow shock, ion energies extend to at least several MeV (Lin et al.\n1974; Desai et al. 2000). Diffusive shock acceleration theories predict that the density of energetic ions falls exponentially with distance from the shock front into the upstream region.\nOn a statistical basis, single spacecraft observations just upstream of the bow shock have\nshown that the energetic ion \xef\xac\x82ux e-folding distance varies from 3.2 +/\xe2\x88\x920.2 Re at 10 keV to\n9.3 +/\xe2\x88\x921.0 Re at 67 keV (Trattner et al. 1994). In a two-spacecraft case study using Cluster, Kis et al. (2004) and Kronberg et al. (2009) found the e-folding distance varied from\n0.5 Re at 11 to 2.8 Re at 27 keV, and increased almost linearly with energy up to \xe2\x88\xbc120 keV.\nAlthough two-point observations provide a far more reliable measurement of the e-folding\ndistance, the Kis et al. (2004) and Kronberg et al. (2009) multipoint analysis studied only\none event, thus limiting their conclusions to high Mach number solar wind in a limited location (a few RE upstream of the shock) over a limited time interval (8 hours of data due to the\norbit of the spacecraft). Evidently a multi-point statistical survey is desirable and necessary\nto better understand the nature of accelerated particles upstream of the bow shock.\nARTEMIS will make extensive observations of the upstream region where particles are\naccelerated to high energies. ARTEMIS will not cross the sub-solar bow shock except during\nextreme solar wind conditions, e.g. very low solar wind Mach numbers (Farris and Russell\n1994), that would in itself result in serendipitous scienti\xef\xac\x81c discoveries. The presence of two\nspacecraft allows correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the \xef\xac\x81eld to be studied in\nthe key range of 0.1\xe2\x80\x9320 RE without the confounding effects of upstream variability\xe2\x80\x94indeed\nobservations can be quanti\xef\xac\x81ed according to upstream conditions. Foreshock energetic particles will be observed both intermittently and continuously over many days, providing excellent statistics. The ARTEMIS probes will sample a much wider range of distances from\nthe shock than previously accessible, at various distances from the tangent line and over a\nwide range of depths in the foreshock.\nARTEMIS will also provide experimental data that challenges the common use of linear\ndiffusive shock acceleration theory. At the bow shock there is already incontrovertible evidence that the linear theory is insuf\xef\xac\x81cient; for example, magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld \xef\xac\x82uctuations do not\nexhibit the power law spectrum assumed by models over the required frequency range (Terasawa 1995). Although linear diffusive shock acceleration theory has been extended into the\nquasi-linear regime (where the energy \xef\xac\x82ows from the particles to the waves, but the waves\nthemselves are given by linear theory) (Lee 1983), experimental tests of quasi-linear theories at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bow shock have not been carried out (Burgess 2007). Furthermore, recent\nlarge-scale hybrid simulations predict that rather than continuing to diminish, the energetic\nparticle \xef\xac\x82ux approaches a constant at some point far upstream of the shock (Giacalone 2004).\nARTEMIS measurements will help to establish the homogeneity of the upstream wave \xef\xac\x81eld,\nof key importance for developing more complex theories of particle acceleration in the foreshock.\nFinally, as noted by Burgess et al. (2005), diffusive shock acceleration has also often\nbeen challenged by the hypothesis that all upstream ion enhancements at Earth are exclusively magnetospheric in origin (e.g. Sarris et al. 1987). Although studies have concluded\nthat most upstream energetic ions do not originate in the magnetosphere (Gosling et al.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\n1989), the presence of energetic magnetospheric oxygen in the foreshock has been reported\n(Mobius et al. 1986). The combination of ARTEMIS, making measurements in the foreshock, together with the remaining three THEMIS spacecraft at the magnetopause and in\nthe magnetosphere measuring changes in energetic ions and the state of the magnetosphere,\nwill allow the magnetospheric input of energetic particles to the shock to be deconvolved\nfrom diffusive shock acceleration better than ever before for a variety of solar wind conditions.\n3.2.2 The Structure of Interplanetary Shocks\nInterplanetary (IP) shocks energize particles, and observations in their vicinity can be used to\ntest theories of particle acceleration. They are thought to be responsible for the production of\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs) in so-called gradual events. In one study of particular note,\nKennel et al. (1986) used ISEE-3 observations of an IP shock to test the Lee (1983) quasilinear theory of diffusive shock acceleration. A number of disagreements were observed\nwhich could be explained by variations in the upstream conditions, but since data from only\na single spacecraft were available, this could not be resolved. By simultaneously observing\nthe conditions both up- and downstream of interplanetary shocks, and then generating statistics based on observations of many IP shocks during the course of the mission, ARTEMIS\nwill provide new information about how IP shocks generate energetic particles. The routine\nacquisition of spin resolution (3 s) plasma moments will be of particular importance in this\nregard. Figure 11 shows an example of an IP shock observed by both ARTEMIS spacecraft\non 5 April 2010. At this time the spacecraft were in transition from terrestrial to lunar orbit.\nRelated to this issue is the nature of type II radio emission. Type II radio emissions are\nthought to be generated patchily in the region upstream from Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)driven interplanetary shocks (Bale et al. 1999; Pulupa and Bale 2008), and are a useful tool\n\nFig. 11 ARTEMIS P1 (left) and P2 (right) observations of an interplanetary shock on 5 April 2010. From\ntop to bottom, the panels show: SST ion energy \xef\xac\x82ux, ESA ion energy \xef\xac\x82ux, SST electron energy \xef\xac\x82ux, ESA\nelectron energy \xef\xac\x82ux, ESA ion velocity components, ESA ion density, and FGM magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld components.\nNote that because the spacecraft were in transition from Earth to lunar orbit, they were widely separated at\nthis time. The ARTEMIS-1 encounter occurred at 08:12 UT and the ARTEMIS-2 encounter at 08:42 UT.\nBoth ARTEMIS spacecraft detected signi\xef\xac\x81cant \xef\xac\x82uxes of energetic electrons and ions\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nfor tracing the propagation of CMEs through the heliosphere. It is still unclear whether the\nstructuring of type II emissions is due to the curvature of the shock on scales of 10 s of\nEarth radii, or due to the curvature of the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld, although it is known that upstream\nturbulence alone cannot explain the dimensions of the acceleration regions inferred from\na single spacecraft (Pulupa and Bale 2008). Furthermore, the ultimate cause of any such\nrippled shock structures remains unclear, especially as a function of upstream conditions.\nSince the emissions are controlled by the shock structure, to better understand how type II\nemission is produced (and thus improve its utility in tracking CMEs) it is necessary to study\nhow shock structure varies with upstream plasma beta, Mach number (also related to the\nCME speed) and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld orientation.\nARTEMIS measurements will allow investigation of IP shock rippling and inhomogeneities on scales of 0.1\xe2\x80\x9320 RE , highly relevant to the problems discussed here (Pulupa\nand Bale 2008). Two-point measurements of magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld vectors will help determine the\ncurvature of magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines, while two-point measurements of shock normals will help\ndetermine shock curvature. Targeted burst mode operations will allow high (3 s) time resolution 3-D ion and electron distributions to be captured, providing new details about the\nupstream structure and the presence of electron beams. Burst mode operations can be targeted to capture the interplanetary shock crossing at high time resolution, including the 3-D\nelectric \xef\xac\x81eld, to better understand how the electron foreshock beams are created.\n3.2.3 Solar Wind Reconnection\nThe recent discovery of reconnection exhausts in the solar wind (Gosling et al. 2005) revealed a new laboratory for reconnection research. Extremely long X-lines, extending hundreds of Earth radii, have been reported in the solar wind (Phan et al. 2006, 2009; Gosling\net al. 2007a). All extended X-line events reported so far were found in large magnetic\nshear current sheets where the reconnection exhausts were wide. However, there are many\nmore low-magnetic shear (and much narrower) reconnection exhausts in the solar wind that\ncan only be resolved by high time resolution plasma measurements (Gosling et al. 2007b).\nARTEMIS, in conjunction with Wind, will allow the investigation of the extent of the reconnection X-lines for low magnetic shears, and establish whether their X-line extent scales\nwith current sheet width as suggested in 3D simulations of reconnection (e.g. Shay et al.\n2003). The multi-point, high-resolution measurements will also be used to investigate the\nstructure of the reconnection exhaust as a function of the distance from the X-line.\n3.2.4 Solar Wind Turbulence\nTurbulence is a multi-scale phenomenon that mediates the transfer of energy, mass, and momentum. The presence of turbulence within the solar wind has been well established from\nstudies of power spectra, probability distribution functions, scaling exponentials, Reynolds\nnumber determinations, etc. Most previous solar wind studies have not focused on the determination of the three fundamental turbulence sale lengths: the correlation scale, the Taylor\nscale, and the dissipation scale. The correlation scale is associated with the largest possible\nturbulent eddy scale size. The Taylor scale is the scale size within the inertial range at which\nviscous damping begins to become important for eddy damping, and the dissipation scale is\nthe scale at which the turbulent eddies have been damped out and the particles are heated.\nStudies of these fundamental turbulence scales are important to help us understand cosmic\nray modulation and particle scattering within the solar wind.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nStudies of magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld \xef\xac\x82uctuations indicate that the correlation scale is on the order\nof several million kilometers and the Taylor scale on the order of a few thousand kilometers (Mattheaus et al. 1990, 2005; Dasso et al. 2005; Weygand et al. 2007, 2009a, 2009b).\nHowever, Mattheus et al. (1990), Dasso et al. (2005), and Weygand et al. (2009a, 2009b)\nhave shown that solar wind turbulence is anisotropic and correlation scale can vary with\nthe respect to the mean magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld direction. Mattheaus et al. (1990) attribute this feature to two different types of turbulence present within the solar wind: slab and quasi-two\ndimensional turbulence. Both Mattheus et al. (1990) and Dasso et al. (2005) used single spacecraft observation to show this anisotropy in the turbulent magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld \xef\xac\x82uctuations and determined the correlation scale by \xef\xac\x81tting an exponential function to autocorrelation values. Dasso et al. (2005) subdivided results by solar wind speed. They showed\nthat the correlation scale is longest along the mean magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld direction in the slow solar wind (<400 km s\xe2\x88\x921 ) but longest in the perpendicular direction in the fast solar wind\n(>500 km s\xe2\x88\x921 ).\nWeygand et al. (2009a, 2009b) employed spacecraft pairs within the solar wind to avoid\nthe inherent assumption in previous studies that the solar wind magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld \xef\xac\x82uctuations are\nfrozen into the \xef\xac\x82ow. The Weygand et al. (2009b) study demonstrated systematic variations\nof the two-dimensional cross-correlation function for slow, intermediate, and fast solar wind\nspeeds. However, two separate exponential \xef\xac\x81ts were required to \xef\xac\x81t cross-correlation values\nacross the full range of spacecraft separations observed. The \xef\xac\x81rst exponential \xef\xac\x81t the correlation values obtained for large ACE, Geotail, IMP-8, Wind, and Interball-1 interseparation\ndistances, while the second exponential with a smaller decay length \xef\xac\x81t the much smaller\ninterspacecraft separations for the Cluster spacecraft. Weygand et al. (2009a) hypothesized\nthat this smaller scale resulted from instrumental differences or foreshock turbulence.\nHowever, limited THEMIS solar wind magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld measurements indicate that the second exponential decay lengths at all solar wind speed ranges do not result from instrumental\nbias or foreshock turbulence, but rather represent real features in the solar wind. Figure 12\n(Weygand et al. 2009b) displays the cross correlation values versus the spacecraft separation\nfor various spacecraft pairs in the fast solar wind (>600 km/s). The blue values between the\ntwo vertical dashed lines are the cross-correlation values from the THEMIS B and C spacecraft.\nFig. 12 Cross-correlation\ncoef\xef\xac\x81cients versus the distance\nseparating spacecraft for the fast\nsolar wind (>600 km/s) outside\nthe foreshock. Cluster\ncorrelations cover the range of\nseparations between 0 and\n\xe2\x88\xbc10,000 km in black. ACE,\nWind, Geotail, IMP8, and\nInterball-1 correlations cover\nseparations greater than\n100,000 km. Blue asterisks\nindicate limited THEMIS B and\nC correlations between the two\ndashed vertical lines. The range\ncurve results from a single\nexponential \xef\xac\x81t to all the data. The\ndashed curve represents the sum\nof two exponentials \xef\xac\x81t to all the\ndata\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nWhile the THEMIS cross correlation values have been an enormous help, the physical\nmeaning of the second exponential decay lengths remains unclear. It may be related to the\nhypothesis that turbulence is bound within solar wind \xef\xac\x82ux tubes (Borovsky 2008). Large\ndecay lengths are related to the walls of the solar wind \xef\xac\x82ux tubes while the small decay\nlengths are associated with the correlation scale of the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld turbulence within the\n\xef\xac\x82ux tubes.\nARTEMIS will play a critical role in these investigations. Inter-separation distances at the\nMoon will range from 500 km to about 31,000 km, precisely \xef\xac\x81lling in the poorly sampled\nregion from 1.5 \xc3\x97 104 to 3.0 \xc3\x97 104 km where Fig. 12 indicates a transition between the two\nexponential \xef\xac\x81ts.\n3.2.5 Upstream Monitors\nIn lunar orbit, ARTEMIS will be an excellent monitor of the solar wind conditions upstream\nfrom the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere. Unlike Earth-orbiting satellites, ARTEMIS will remain\noutside the magnetosphere for extended periods of time, and will, for example, be able to\nobserve the entire passage of a CME. As such, ARTEMIS will provide useful input to global\nsimulations of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere and services such as the Community Coordinated\nModeling Center (CCMC). ARTEMIS will be closer to the Earth than existing L1 solar wind\nmonitors, and therefore offers a more precise measurement of the exact solar wind input to\nthe magnetosphere\xe2\x80\x94such measurements will be of use to other teams studying the magnetosphere with both satellite- and ground-based experiments. Finally, by comparing ARTEMIS\ndata to that from L1 monitors such as ACE and Wind, it will be possible to develop new\nmodels that advect L1 solar wind monitoring data to the Earth, thereby improving our understanding of how L1 monitoring data should be used to predict magnetospheric dynamics.\n3.3 The Lunar Wake\nAs an essentially non-magnetic and non-conducting body with no ionosphere, the Moon absorbs most of the incident solar wind plasma, leaving a plasma void, or wake, within plasma\n\xef\xac\x82ows (Schubert and Lichtenstein 1974). The plasma cavity formed downstream from the\nMoon represents one of the best natural plasma vacuums in the solar system, and an excellent basic physics laboratory for understanding the general process of plasma expansion into\na vacuum, with applications ranging from low-altitude earth orbiting satellites to outer planet\nmoons. Although the lunar wake has been studied since the Apollo era (Ness et al. 1967;\nColburn et al. 1967), we still do not fully understand many aspects of its formation, dynamics, and re\xef\xac\x81lling.\nNevertheless, our understanding of the wake has advanced with each new lunar mission. Far from being a passive region, the wake hosts a wide variety of dynamic phenomena (see Fig. 13). Wind, with a suite of modern plasma instruments, made a number\nof lunar \xef\xac\x82ybys and discovered a wake extending to at least 25 RL downstream (Clack\net al. 2004), counter-streaming anisotropic ion beams re\xef\xac\x81lling the wake along magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld lines (Ogilvie et al. 1996; Clack et al. 2004), and electrostatic and electromagnetic plasma waves in and around the wake (Kellogg et al. 1996; Farrell et al. 1996;\nBale et al. 1997). Nozomi observed non-thermal ions and counter-streaming electrons upstream from the Moon (Futaana et al. 2001, 2003), possibly associated with wake processes.\nGeotail observed ULF waves associated with the lunar wake region (Nakagawa et al. 2003).\nLunar Prospector discovered the important role of non-Maxwellian solar wind electrons\nin driving low-altitude wake re\xef\xac\x81lling (Halekas et al. 2005). Kaguya, Chang\xe2\x80\x99E, and Chandrayaan discovered ion scattering from the dayside surface (Saito et al. 2010; Wieser et al.\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 13 Our current understanding of the electrodynamics of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the solar wind. The\nMoon carves out a cavity, known as the wake, in the oncoming solar wind. Ion beams stream inward to \xef\xac\x81ll\nthe cavity, which is bounded by rarefaction waves, diamagnetic currents, and inward-pointing electric \xef\xac\x81elds.\nCrustal magnetic anomalies may launch shocks into the solar wind, while the nightside lunar surface charges\nnegative and emits secondary electrons\n\n2009), and observed gyrating protons (Type-I entry) and re-picked up scattered protons\n(Type-II entry) re\xef\xac\x81lling the low altitude wake perpendicular to magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines (Nishino\net al. 2009a, 2009b; Holmstrom et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010).\nWhile these observations have shed light on the global structure of the lunar wake and\nemphasized the need to treat it kinetically, our understanding of the physical nature of the\nwake and how it re\xef\xac\x81lls is limited primarily due to the relative paucity of in situ measurements made in the region. Early Explorer and Apollo satellites carried limited plasma instrumentation and the Lunar Prospector instrument package did not include ion detectors or\nelectric \xef\xac\x81eld analyzers. Wind provided a relatively complete plasma data set from the lunar\nwake, but made only a handful of passes, leaving wake coverage far from complete. Nozomi and Geotail also have made only a very limited number of lunar \xef\xac\x82ybys. Chandrayaan,\nChang\xe2\x80\x99E, and Kaguya only observed the wake over narrow ranges of distances from the\nMoon. To date, there has not been a dedicated mission to provide comprehensive coverage\nof the lunar wake over a wide range of distances and complete our understanding of its\nstructure.\n3.3.1 Structure of the Wake\nGlobal hybrid simulations (kinetic ions, \xef\xac\x82uid electrons) con\xef\xac\x81rm that kinetic effects are important. Figure 14, showing the formation of a plasma void in the lunar wake that is re\xef\xac\x81lled\nby two beams counter-streaming along magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines in X\xe2\x80\x93Y plane, demonstrates the\ncomplex structure of the lunar wake even for ambient magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld orientations that lie\ntransverse to the wake axis. The same simulation also indicates that the lunar wake could\nextend well beyond 25 RL downstream.\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 14 Results from a global hybrid simulation for the interaction of the solar wind with the Moon. Proton\ndensities, normalized to the value in the unperturbed solar wind, are shown in the X\xe2\x80\x93Y plane containing the\nIMF, which points in the Y -direction. The results show the formation of a plasma void in the lunar wake that\nis re\xef\xac\x81lled by two beams counter-streaming along magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 13, asymmetries in the lunar wake structure are expected whenever the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld does not lie parallel to the wake, since diamagnetic current systems,\nand the resulting magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld perturbations, differ for perpendicular vs. parallel magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81elds. In addition, limb compressions are often observed external to the wake cavity and\nrarefaction wave, located downstream from crustal magnetic anomalies (Russell and Lichtenstein 1975). Previous measurements suggest that these structures are compressional features (Siscoe et al. 1969) that propagate outward at magnetosonic wave velocities (Whang\nand Ness 1970). One expects them to propagate downstream from crustal magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld regions, producing a highly asymmetric structure external to the main wake cavity. However,\nno observations have clearly con\xef\xac\x81rmed this supposition, or determined how far downstream\nthese features propagate and to what degree they affect the structure of the wake interior to\nthem. Many observations have found asymmetric wake characteristics on individual orbits\n(Ness et al. 1968), but single spacecraft cannot clearly distinguish between asymmetries and\ntemporal variations.\nThe orbital coverage and complete plasma instrumentation of ARTEMIS will enable a\ncomprehensive determination of the wake\xe2\x80\x99s extent and structure. The two-point measurements provided by ARTEMIS will allow unambiguous identi\xef\xac\x81cation of asymmetries in the\nwake due to the perturbing in\xef\xac\x82uences of solar wind and crustal magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds or other\neffects.\n3.3.2 Wake Re\xef\xac\x81lling and Dynamics\nPrevious missions have measured several modes of wake re\xef\xac\x81lling, but we do not yet understand their relative importance or the interplay between them. Wind saw ion beams\naccelerated along magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines into the wake from the \xef\xac\x82anks (Ogilvie et al. 1996;\nClack et al. 2004) several lunar radii downstream, implying a potential drop across the wake\nboundary that occurs as a natural consequence of the pressure gradient across the wake\nboundary and the difference in electron and ion thermal velocities. Simulations have contributed greatly to our understanding of this process, which re\xef\xac\x81lls the wake along magnetic\n\xef\xac\x81eld lines (Farrell et al. 1998; Birch and Chapman 2001, 2002; Kallio 2005; Travnicek et al.\n2005; Kimura and Nakagawa 2008). Meanwhile, recent low altitude observations show that\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nthe wake also re\xef\xac\x81lls perpendicular to magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines (Nishino et al. 2009a, 2009b;\nHolmstrom et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). Only ARTEMIS, with its elliptical orbit, can\nunravel the interplay between parallel and perpendicular re\xef\xac\x81lling processes, and determine\ntheir relative importance as a function of location in the wake.\nThe wake provides a rich laboratory for plasma waves and instabilities, with a broad\nspectrum of waves observed in the central wake (Kellogg et al. 1996), and even far upstream on magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines connected to the wake boundary (Nakagawa et al. 2003;\nFarrell et al. 1996; Bale et al. 1997). Waves observed to date include ion acoustic waves and\nLangmuir waves from instabilities related to differential ion/electron shadowing (Bale et al.\n1997), and whistlers produced by beam instabilities near the wake boundary (Nakagawa\net al. 2003; Farrell et al. 1996, 2008). Waves predicted but not conclusively observed before ARTEMIS include instabilities generated by counter-streaming electrons in the central\nwake (Birch and Chapman 2001, 2002), ion acoustic-like interactions generated by re\xef\xac\x81lling\nion beams in the central wake (Farrell et al. 1998), and low frequency electromagnetic turbulence with frequencies near the local proton gyrofrequency (Travnicek et al. 2005). Most\nrecently, Kaguya has observed broad spectrum electrostatic turbulence associated with a\ntwo-stream instability formed by electrons pulled into the wake along \xef\xac\x81eld lines by the superabundance of charge from pickup ion Type II entry perpendicular to magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld lines\n(Nishino et al. 2010). We have barely explored this menagerie of plasma waves, and the\ninstability growth mechanisms and wave-particle interactions remain far from understood.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 15, the \xef\xac\x81rst lunar wake \xef\xac\x82yby by ARTEMIS revealed electrostatic oscillations associated with counter-streaming electrons in the central wake and the regions\nmagnetically connected to it, providing the \xef\xac\x81rst con\xef\xac\x81rmation for the predictions of Nakagawa et al. (2003) and Birch and Chapman (2001, 2002). See Halekas et al. (2011, this\n\nFig. 15 Observations from the \xef\xac\x81rst lunar wake \xef\xac\x82yby by ARTEMIS probe P1 on Feb 13, 2010. The \xef\xac\x81gure shows energy-time spectrograms for electrons streaming parallel (0\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x97\xa6 pitch angle) and anti-parallel\n(165\xe2\x80\x93180\xe2\x97\xa6 ) to the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld (in eV/(cm2 s sr eV)), and an electric \xef\xac\x81eld wave frequency-time spectrogram. The anti-parallel streaming solar wind strahl population penetrates all the way through the wake from\nthe exit side, while most of the core population is excluded from the central wake by the wake potential.\nA residual core population penetrates from the entry side of the wake, and is accelerated outward by the wake\npotential, forming a counter-streaming distribution that excites electrostatic oscillations\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nissue) for more details. Further passes will enable researchers to determine the distribution\nof wave activity within the wake.\n3.3.3 Response to External Drivers\nThe wake structure will certainly vary in dynamic response to external drivers. Several studies (Ogilvie and Ness 1969; Colburn et al. 1971; Whang and Ness 1972; Halekas et al.\n2005) provide tantalizing hints how the wake responds to changing solar wind conditions,\nbut the limited data and orbital coverage of the previous missions constrains our knowledge\nof this response to external drivers. Hybrid simulations have shown that the orientation of\nthe IMF with respect to the solar wind \xef\xac\x82ow direction affects both the downstream extent and\nsymmetry of the lunar wake (Travnicek et al. 2005).\nAlthough the Moon spends the majority of its time in the solar wind, it also spends\n\xe2\x88\xbc5 days each month in the terrestrial magnetosphere, where the plasma environment differs\ngreatly from that in the solar wind. Magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld con\xef\xac\x81gurations and \xef\xac\x82ow speeds in the\nplasma sheet are highly variable, which should result in lunar wakes very different from\nthose in the solar wind. For example, reconnection beyond 60 RE should result in sunward\nplasma sheet plasma \xef\xac\x82ows and a sunward-orientated wake.\nUsing dual-probe measurements, ARTEMIS will determine the response of the lunar\nwake to solar wind drivers. ARTEMIS will provide the \xef\xac\x81rst detailed measurement of the\nlunar wake plasma environment within the terrestrial magnetosphere.\n\n4 Concluding Remarks\nFrom vantage points near and in orbit about the Moon, ARTEMIS will provide the comprehensive two-point particle and electromagnetic \xef\xac\x81eld observations needed to chart and\nunderstand a host of planetary phenomena. Observations of pick-up ions will be used to\ndetermine the composition of the exosphere and hence the lunar surface as a function of\nexternal conditions. Electric \xef\xac\x81elds that can loft dust in the vicinity of the Moon will be measured both directly and remotely. The structure of crustal magnetic anomalies that shield\nsome regions of the Moon while creating mini-magnetospheres complete with bow shocks\nin the oncoming solar wind will be mapped.\nThe same lunar vantage points offer an opportunity to address a series of longstanding\nheliospheric research problems. ARTEMIS will map the structure of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetotail,\ndetermining its structure and the characteristics of magnetic reconnection, particle energization, and turbulence as function of solar wind conditions. While in the solar wind, the two\nspacecraft will provide the observations needed to understand reconnection at interplanetary\ndiscontinuities and particle acceleration at both the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bow shock and interplanetary\nshocks. They will also serve as excellent monitors of the solar wind input into the magnetosphere for other forthcoming NASA and international missions. Finally, the ARTEMIS\nspacecraft will provide the comprehensive observations needed to understand the steadystate and time-dependent structure of and processes within the lunar wake.\nThe novel repurposing of the outermost two THEMIS spacecraft demonstrates the creativity of the THEMIS/ARTEMIS team at its best. It has set the stage for potentially dramatic\nadvances in our understanding of the Moon and its environment. This will be a joint undertaking of both the THEMIS/ARTEMIS team and the international community, for all of the\nobservations returned by ARTEMIS will become immediately available via the mission\xe2\x80\x99s\nweb site, themis.ssl.Berkeley.edu, just as is the case for THEMIS.\n\nD.G.
