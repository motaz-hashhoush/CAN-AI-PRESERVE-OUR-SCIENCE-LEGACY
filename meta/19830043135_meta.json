Attention is given to concentrator arrays, in which highly reflective surfaces concentrate solar energy onto the solar cells. Two types of concentrator arrays are under consideration: one with a low geometric concentration ratio which after reflector losses can produce about 5 suns at the cell surface, and the other with a Cassegrainian concentrator that produces a flux level of 100 suns on the cell surface. Costs are reduced from the $300/W for planar arrays to $250/W and as little as $100/W, respectively, in 1982 dollars. The storage of electrical energy by means of novel battery systems is also considered.", "title": "Electric power - Looking at regenerative systems", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830043135, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, J.
