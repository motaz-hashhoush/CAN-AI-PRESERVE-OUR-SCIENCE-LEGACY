An analysis of the work's decompiled code revealed a battery of attacks by a knowledgeable insider, and demonstrated a number of security weaknesses. The attack occurred in an open network, and little can be inferred about the vulnerabilities of closed networks used for critical operations. The attack showed that passwork protection procedures need review and strengthening. It showed that sets of mutually trusting computers need to be carefully controlled. Sharp public reaction crystalized into a demand for user awareness and accountability in a networked world.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900014594, "id": "0ff4c4712d1246d6855dfaa70eff5cd0", "publicationDate": "1989-02-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900014594.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900014594/downloads/19900014594.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900014594/downloads/19900014594.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900014594/downloads/19900014594.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
