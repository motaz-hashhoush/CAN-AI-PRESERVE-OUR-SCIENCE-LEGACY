Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to a spacecraft having a jettisonable\nheat shield. More particularly, it relates to a spacecraft having\nsuch a heat shield together with extendable landing gem\nmounted inside of the forward end of the shell.\nFor a spacecraft of the type which would be useful for exploration of M r ,for example, it is desirable to have an exas\ncursion module which has a jettisonable heat shield, which\nthereby provides a vehicle with a lower terminal landing and\nf\nascent weight, a lower center o gravity, and improved visibility of crew. It is also desirable to have a spacecraft which does\nnot require turnaround during descent, since this keeps the\ncrew and all systems in a single attitude to the flight and ianding path during this very critical period. Furthermore, the altitude- and velocity-sensing apparatus would not be interrupted, the crew position with respect to retardation, ianding,\nand lift-off would not be altered and therefore proximity to instruments and control would remain the same. Furthermore,\nthe crew scanning provisions would remain in a most simple\nform because the landing objective would always be in the\nsame direction.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nHeretofore, spacecraft have not been designed with jettisonable heat shields, and with extendable landing gear inside\nof the forward end of the shield, and with crew stations rearward of the landing gear.\n\nS U M M ~ OFY INVENTION\n~ THE\nThis invention includes a spacecraft having a jettisonable\naerodynamic shell of heat-resistant material to provide a heat\nshield. lit includes an excursion module removably housed in\nthe shell. The module has a retracted landing gear and a forwardly thrusting thrust means, such as a rocket engine, at the\nforward end thereof. The module also includes a crew station\ngenerally rearward of the landing gear. Means are also provided for jettisoning or separating the module from the shell\nbefore landing of the module, whereby the rocket engine may\nbe operated after removal of the shell to provide braking of\nthe module and hover capabilities, if required during the landing.\nMeans may also be provided for slowing the velocity of the\nmodule and shell before separation of the module from the\nshell, during which time the heat shield capabilities of the shell\nwould be utilized to protect the module. The means for\nseparating the module from the shell may include thrusters or\nmeans for splitting the shell so that it falls away.\nIBIUEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ~ ~ A W r N ~ S\nReference to the drawings will further explain the invention\nwherein:\nFIG. B shows a mother space vehicle;\nA\nFIG. PB shows a spacecraft of this invention shortly after\nseparation from the mother vehicle;\nFIG. IC shows a spacecraft of this invention being\ndecelerated:\nFIG.ID show the separation ofthe module from the shell;\nFIG. 1E shows the landing gear of the module extended and\nthe thrust means actuated to slow descent of the module;\nFIG. IF shows the spacecraft landed;\nPIG. 16 shows the spacecraft landed with crew compartmenu deployed;\n\nRefenring now to the various FIGS. 1, and\n1A first, a\n11 is shown as it might appear in orbit\n15 mother space veh\n\nrs traveling with the blunt end rearward\naround the Planet\nand pointed end forward and moving from right to left as\nshown in FIG. 1. The spacecraft of this invention is generally\ndesignated by the numeral 12 and is of aerodynamic configu20 ration and conforms with the recess 13,shorn in the forward\nend of space vehicle BP, from which it is shown separate. This\nseparation is accomplished by release of conventional latch\nmeans plus operation of thrusters 14,shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.\nThe spacecraft 12 is then decelerated in the Mars at25 mosphere by \xe2\x80\x9cair braking,\xe2\x80\x9d or by deployment of atmosphereresisting element such as a parachute or ballute 16,or both.\nOuter shell 18 is of heat-resistant materia! so that it serves as a\nheat shield during entry into the atmosphere. Thereafter it is\njettisonable to reduce landing weight.\n30 The outer shell 18 may be jettisoned by operation of\nthrusters 23 attached to shell 18. Alternatively, shell If4 could\nbe built in sections and, by use of explosives or other means,\narranged for separation from the spacecraft. The landing gear\n35 22, which is shown in the stowed or retracted position in FIG.\n2, is then actuated to the landing position as shown in FIGS.\n1E and 3. With the landing gear deployed, the forwardly\nthrusting thrust means in the form of descent engine 24 is ignited and provides retroforce for landing and hovering capa40 bilities.\nIt will be noted that the descent engine 2\n22 are toward the forward end of the spacecraft in the initial\nassembled condition. The spacecraft also includes a crew station designed by the numeral 26\n45 landing gear 22 and descent engine\nthe crew is positioned in a general1\nto the landing plane of the Mars surface.\nSince the retardation forces are relatively low in landing on\n,\nthe planet Mars, the crew station is arranged for the crew to - ,\n50 stand feet downward with primary forces being resisted\n\xe2\x80\x9ceyeballs down.\xe2\x80\x9d Each man of\ncrew faces outwardly\ntoward his own scanning window 2 r 360\xe2\x80\x9d visual inspection\nof the landing site. Restraining straps and back supports are\nsecured to the structure to aid crew members in holding their\n55 stance against perturbations.\nIn addition to crew station 26,living quarters may also be\nprovided for the crew in the form of cabins 30 which are adjacent to crew station 26 and are arranged to fold down in a\n60 pivotal manner, as shown in dotted line in FIG.3 and as shown\nin solid line in FIG.16.\nReturn of the crew i accomplished as shown in FIG. 11 by\ns\nactivation of ascent engine 25 to provide lift-off thrust. As\nascent continues, staging such as that shown in FIG. BJ with\n65 fuel tanks being jettisoned, is required preparatory to\nrendezvous with mother vehicle 11, for example.\nThis invention provides a novel M m excursion module\nspacecraft arrangement wherein the normal planetary descent\nmission does not require a turnaround in order to touch down.\n70 Outer shell 1 acts-as the heat shield and, may be of one or\nseveral pieces, and is jettisoned prior to touch down to provide\nlower gross landing weight and a lower center of gravity for\nthe vehicle.\nDescent engine 24 provides the desired retropropulsion\n75 during deceleration and for hovering and landing capabilities.\n\nEngine 25 provides lift-off capabilities as discussed above. A\npreferred type of engine would be of the plug nozzle-type\nf\nbecause o its compact design.\nIt is to be understood that the foregoing description is illustrative only and other embodiments of the invention will be\nobviousto those sbiled in the art in view of this description.\nI claim:\n1.
