Pfriem for recording quasi-stationary cylinder wall temperatures. The new device is a resistance thermometer, the temperature-susceptible part of which consists of a gold coating applied by evaporation under high vacuum and electrolytically strengthened. After overcoming initial difficulties, calibration of plugs up to and beyond 400 degrees C was possible. The measurements were made on high-speed internal combustion engines. The increasing effect of carbon deposit at the wall surface with increasing operating period is indicated by means of charts.", "title": "Recording Rapidly Changing Cylinder-wall Temperatures", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930094404, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meier, Adolph"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f0bf5e2961a44b00bf26c1ec95a99f5b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-07-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930094404, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930094404, "id": "651f8ac66a0c46f68a85cbfa4e478296", "publicationDate": "1942-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930094404.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930094404/downloads/19930094404.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930094404/downloads/19930094404.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930094404/downloads/19930094404.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
