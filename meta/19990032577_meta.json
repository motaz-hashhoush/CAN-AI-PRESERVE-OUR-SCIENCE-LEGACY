Beautiful panoramic views of the shuttle on the launch pad, engine ignition, Rocket launch, and the separation and burnout of the Solid Rocket Boosters are shown. The footage also includes an animation of the mission. Detailed views of the path that the Orbiter traversed were shown. Once the Orbiter lands on the surface of Mars, it will dig a six to eight inch hole and collect samples from the planets' surface. The animation also included the prospective return of the Orbiter to Earth over the desert of Utah. The remote sensor on the Orbiter helps in finding the exact location of the Orbiter so that scientists may collect the sample and analyze it.", "title": "Mars Climate Orbiter", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T01:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990032577, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990032577, "id": "6670cb67cb0446b9b411d2d298dacb67", "publicationDate": "1998-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
