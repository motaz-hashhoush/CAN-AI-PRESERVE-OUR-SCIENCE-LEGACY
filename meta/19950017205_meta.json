In turbines, it has been used to control secondary flows by tailoring blade turning to reduce flow overturning and underturning and to create more uniform loss distributions from hub to shroud. In the present study, the Pump Consortium centrifugal impeller has been redesigned using blade lean. The flow at the exit of the baseline impeller had large blade-to-blade variations, creating a highly unsteady flow for the downstream diffuser. Blade lean is used to redesign the flow to move the high loss fluid from the suction side to the hub, significantly reducing blade-toblade variations at the exit.", "title": "Use of Blade Lean in Turbomachinery Redesign", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950017205, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moore, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.", "location": "Blacksburg, VA, United States"}}, "id": "6578437b702d48cfa171e30cbd09bedc"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950017205, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moore, Joan G."}, "organization": {"name": "Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.", "location": "Blacksburg, VA, United States"}}, "id": "0197122bcd6f46ecad55b02dce3e1ed7"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950017205, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lupi, Alex"}, "organization": {"name": "Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.", "location": "Blacksburg, VA, United States"}}, "id": "4857f6d1c5b54915a2214ecdb5612ccf"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950017205, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950017205, "id": "caaac18a27a84e6e8d623402ac7e17e9", "publicationName": "NASA.
