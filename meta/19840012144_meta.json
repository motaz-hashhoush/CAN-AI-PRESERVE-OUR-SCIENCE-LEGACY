The atmosphere and oceans are modelled mathematically and their phenomenology studied by computer simulation methods. The present state-of-the-art in the computer simulation of large scale oceans on the CYBER 205 is discussed. While atmospheric modelling differs in some aspects, the basic approach used is similar. The equations of the ocean model are presented along with a short description of the numerical techniques used to find their solution. Computational considerations and a typical solution are presented in section 4.", "title": "Ocean modelling on the CYBER 205 at GFDL", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T23:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840012144, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cox, M."}, "organization": {"name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "location": "Princeton, NJ, United States"}}, "id": "b48a90284c024d25823755425001925e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19840012144, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840012144, "id": "b568183aa03447dc856244d1cb74bdf2", "publicationName": "NASA.
