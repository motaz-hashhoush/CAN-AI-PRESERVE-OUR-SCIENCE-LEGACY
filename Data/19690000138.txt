The basis for the problem\nlies in the selection of a slip ring having little or no\nwear, a very long maintenance-free life and low electrical loss. Under ordinary atmospheric conditions,\nthe liquid mercury slip ring fulfills all of these requirements, but due to the prohibitively high vapor pressure\nof mercury, this simple, reliable slip ring system cannot\nbe used in ultrahigh vacuum.\nGallium, which has a very low vapor pressure, was\nsubstituted for mercury in a liquid slip ring system\nwith excellent results under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The gallium rotary electrical contact consists\nof a copper ring mounted on a rotating shaft that is\n\nimmersed in a copper cup containing gallium. (See\nfigure.)Some mild abrasion of the copper surface,\nwhile it is in contact with the liquid gallium, is necessary for the gallium to wet the copper surface. The\ngallium is initially liquified by a small electric heater\nmounted on the gallium cup and will remain liquified\nbecause of the heating effect of the electrical current\nflowing through the slip ring, so that the heater can\nthen be shut off.\nThis type of slip ring has operated in a vacuum of\nlO 11 torr, periodically carrying currents of 25 amperes\ndc, for a period of two years with no maintenance. A\nmoderate amount of outgassing occurs during the\ninitial period of contact rotation and as the contact\ntemperature increases, bakeout of the vacuum system\nin which this type of rotary slip ring is used must be\nI\t\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
