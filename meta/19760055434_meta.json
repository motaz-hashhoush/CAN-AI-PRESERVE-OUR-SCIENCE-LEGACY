The study indicates that fuel consumption improvements of as much as 5% may be possible in current JT3D, JT8D, and JT9D turbofan engines. Aerodynamic, thermodynamic, material, and structural advances are expected to yield fuel consumption improvements on the order of 10 to 15% in advanced turbofan engines, with the greatest improvement stemming from significantly higher cycle pressure ratios. Higher turbine temperature and fan bypass ratios are also expected to contribute to fuel conservation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760055434, "endDate": "1976-07-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Society of Automotive Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "797318ae53fc415cb0dfad48b3c27a17", "id": "090fa065eb274c5ea9ba467d163bc4b4"}], "name": "Propulsion Conference", "location": "Palo Alto, CA", "id": "797318ae53fc415cb0dfad48b3c27a17", "startDate": "1976-07-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760055434, "id": "5830eb20d86d4879b7cba5035ea0935d", "publicationDate": "1976-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
