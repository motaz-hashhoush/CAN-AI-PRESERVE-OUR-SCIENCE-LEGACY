Oberon and Titania, the two outermost major moons, have similar bulk properties but different appearances. Oberon appears to have been a largely passive structure for incoming projectiles, while Titania's surface shows extensive resurfacing. Umbriel and Ariel also have similar bulk properties and contrasting appearances, the former being totally bland except for two unexplained bright spots and the latter having a extensive network of surface faults. Miranda, the smallest and innermost of the major moons, has three large, remarkable ovoid regions on its surface. It is suggested that these ovoids are due to an uncompleted differentiation process.", "title": "The moons of Uranus", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T04:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870048275, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Torrence V."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "8d3d0cb61e0f4340b2855a54004b6fbb"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870048275, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brown, Robert Hamilton"}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "5f98624369ab4300b51e4f8ca0cc72a3"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19870048275, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Soderblom, Laurence A."}, "organization": {"name": "USGS", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "id": "4a7fba844b1a426ca0963a8bdfe964ff"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870048275, "publications": [{"volume": "256", "submissionId": 19870048275, "issn": "0036-8733", "id": "ae14c35def1948a58d516b4b38c38889", "publicationName": "Scientific American", "publicationDate": "1987-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
