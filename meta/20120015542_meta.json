After only three releases of the initiative, a total of 66 CubeSats now await launch opportunities. So, how is this challenge being resolved? NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP) has studied how to integrate PPODs on Athena, Atlas V, and Delta IV launch vehicles and has been instrumental in developing several carrier systems to support CubeSats as rideshares on NASA missions. In support of the first two ELaNa missions the Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) was adapted for use on a Taurus XL (ELaNa I) and a Delta n (ELaNa III). Four P-PODs, which contained a total eight CubeSats, were used on these first ELaNa missions. Next up is ELaNa VI, which will launch on an Atlas V in August 2012. The four ELaNa VI CubeSats, in three P-PODs, are awaiting launch, having been integrated in the NPSCuLite. To increase rideshare capabilities, the Launch Services Program (LSP) is working to integrate P-PODs on Falcon 9 missions. The proposed Falcon 9 manifest will provide greater opportunities for the CubeSat community. For years, the standard CubeSat size was 1 U to 3U. As the desire to include more science in each cube grows, so does the standard CubeSat size. No longer is a 1 U, 1.5U, 2U or 3U CubeSat the only option available; the new CubeSat standard will include 6U and possibly even 12U. With each increase in CubeSat size, the CubeSat community is pushing the capability of the current P-POD design. Not only is the carrier system affected, but integration to the Launch Vehicle is also a concern. The development of a system to accommodate not only the 3U P-POD but also carriers for larger CubeSats is ongoing. LSP considers payloads in the lkg to 180 kg range rideshare or small/secondary payloads. As new and emerging small payloads are developed, rideshare opportunities and carrier systems need to be identified and secured. The development of a rideshare carrier system is not always cost effective. Sometimes a launch vehicle with an excellent performance record appears to be a great rideshare candidate however, after completing a feasibility study, LSP may determine that the cost of the rideshare carrier system is too great and, due to budget constraints, the development cannot go forward. With the current budget environment, one cost effective way to secure rideshare opportunities is to look for synergy with other government organizations that share the same interest.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120015542, "endDate": "2012-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "544bac8c759a47b284ce63d7ac323dcc", "id": "ea14e3f8b0d34e1e9eeac98dc3adfa70"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Utah State Univ.", "location": "Logan, UT, United States"}}, "meetingId": "544bac8c759a47b284ce63d7ac323dcc", "id": "fd19bc357a65494ea91ac9b2d56153f3"}], "name": "26th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites", "location": "Logan, UT", "id": "544bac8c759a47b284ce63d7ac323dcc", "startDate": "2012-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120015542, "id": "11b209fac76540f79497a01120df1580", "publicationDate": "2012-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120015542.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120015542/downloads/20120015542.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120015542/downloads/20120015542.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120015542/downloads/20120015542.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
