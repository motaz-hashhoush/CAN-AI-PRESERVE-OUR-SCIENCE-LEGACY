The intended application of the computer includes such critical real-time tasks as 'fly-by-wire' active control and completely automatic Category III landings of commercial aircraft. The FTMP architecture is briefly described and it is shown that it is a viable solution to the multi-faceted problems of safety, speed, and cost. Three job dispatch strategies are described, and their results with respect to job-starting delay are presented. The first strategy is a simple First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) job dispatch executive. The other two schedulers are an adaptive FCFS and an interrupt driven scheduler. Three failure modes are discussed, and the FTMP survival probability in the face of random hard failures is evaluated. It is noted that the hourly cost of operating two FTMPs in a transport aircraft can be as little as one-to-two percent of the total flight-hour cost of the aircraft.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790056270, "endDate": "1979-06-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "National Computer Conference", "location": "New York, NY", "id": "13177b855f084f62845081ccf20753d1", "startDate": "1979-06-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790056270, "id": "1144aaff60cb4ab183240ee73cb9abfd", "publicationDate": "1979-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
