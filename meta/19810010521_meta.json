The results of these tests showed that the pilots seldom used the drum window apparently because it was difficult to read as indicated by average drum window dwell times of .6 seconds. It is suggested that pilot scanning data be collected for other type of altimeters in order to find those with good scanning characteristics.", "title": "How a pilot looks at altitude", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T02:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810010521, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spady, A.
