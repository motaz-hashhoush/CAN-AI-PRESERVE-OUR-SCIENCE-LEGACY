Free world countries were surveyed with primary emphasis on the United States and Western Europe because that is where the most advanced technology resides. The survey includes major contemporary systems on operational aircraft, R&D flight programs, advanced aircraft developments, and major research and technology programs. The survey was not intended to be an in-depth treatment of the technology elements, but rather a study of major trends in systems level technology. The information was collected from open literature, personal communications and a tour of several companies, government organizations and research laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840014515, "id": "f81f05ada86c42b5a4cf699aca986a79", "publicationDate": "1984-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840014515.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840014515/downloads/19840014515.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840014515/downloads/19840014515.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840014515/downloads/19840014515.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
