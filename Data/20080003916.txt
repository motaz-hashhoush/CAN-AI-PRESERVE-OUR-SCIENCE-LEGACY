b'Advanced Airfoils Boost Helicopter Performance\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nA\n\ndvanced rotorcraft airfoils developed by U.S.\nArmy engineers working with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Langley\nResearch Center were part of the Army\xe2\x80\x99s risk\nreduction program for the LHX (Light Helicopter\nExperimental), the forerunner of the Comanche helicopter. The helicopter\xe2\x80\x99s airfoils were designed as part\nof the Army\xe2\x80\x99s basic research program and were tested\n\nin the 6- by 28-inch Transonic Tunnel and the LowTurbulence Pressure Tunnel at Langley. While these\nairfoils did not get applied to the Boeing-Sikorsky\nComanche rotor, they did advance the state of the art\nfor rotorcraft airfoils.\nThe improved blade offered significantly greater lift\ncapabilities, less drag, and less pitch (alternating lift and\ndescent of the nose and tail of an aircraft during flight)\n\nthan its predecessor and other conventional blades, when\ncompared during high-speed flight-performance testing.\nThe Langley airfoil design, technically known as\nRC4, has managed to \xe2\x80\x9clift off\xe2\x80\x9d and find much success in\t\nother applications.\n\nPartnership\nCarson Helicopters Inc. licensed the Langley RC4\nseries of airfoils in 1993\xe2\x80\x942 years after the Comanche\nproject commenced\xe2\x80\x94and began development of a\nreplacement main rotor blade for their helicopters.\nThe new Carson composite main rotor blades did not\nreceive full Federal Aviation Administration certification\nuntil 2003. Regardless, it was well worth the wait for\nFrank Carson, president of the Perkasie, Pennsylvaniabased company and a longtime helicopter pilot and\ndesigner. \xe2\x80\x9cThe NASA Langley airfoil is one of the best\nairfoils in the world. Almost no one realizes how good\nit is. It\xe2\x80\x99s better than most anyone else has yet to come\t\nup with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProduct Outcome\n\nThe NASA-developed rotorcraft airfoils permit greater lift and lower pitching-moments than other rotorcraft airfoils\xe2\x80\x94ideal for\nheavy lifting operations.\n\n50\t\n\nTransportation\n\n\t\n\nCarson Helicopters provides a unique array of services\nthat require hauling heavy loads. These services range\nfrom airlifting external cargo, suppressing wildfires,\t\nand carrying out emergency rescues, to performing\nhigh-rise rooftop installations, pouring concrete, and\nerecting steel structures and power lines in areas groundbased cranes cannot access (soft grounds and swamp\t\nareas, environmentally protected areas, and elevated/\nmountain terrain).\nThe company\xe2\x80\x99s entire fleet of Sikorsky S-61 helicopters has been rebuilt to include Langley\xe2\x80\x99s patented airfoil\ndesign on the main rotor. As a result of this retooling,\nthe helicopters are now able to carry an additional 2,000\npounds (11,000 pounds total), fly 17 miles per hour\nfaster, and travel 70 miles farther on the same fuel load.\nAdditionally, the five blades on an S-61 main rotor are\nmade from advanced composite materials that give them a\nSpinoff 2007\n\n20,000-hour service life\xe2\x80\x94double that of the conventional\nmetal S-61 blades\xe2\x80\x99 life\xe2\x80\x94which ultimately reduces the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s operating maintenance costs.\nIn 2003, Carson Helicopters signed a contract with\nDucommun AeroStructures Inc., to have the Gardena,\nCalifornia-based firm manufacture the composite blades\nfor Carson Helicopters to sell. The commercial blades\nare due to fly on a U.S. Presidential VH-3 helicopter\nin late 2007, as part of the VH-3D Lift Improvement\nProgram sponsored by the U.S. Naval Air Systems\nCommand. Overseas, a customized set of blades is\t\nbeing tested for potential use on a British Sea King Royal\nNavy helicopter.\nIn aerial firefighting, the performance-boosting airfoils have allowed for a major modification to be made\nto a Sikorsky S-61 chopper, in order to help the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture\xe2\x80\x99s Forest Service control the\nSpinoff 2007\t\n\nThe advanced airfoils, as applied to the main rotor of an S-61 helicopter, greatly increase the lifting capacity, operational\nenvelope, and forward flight speed of the helicopter.\n\nspread of wildfires. Because the airfoils permit heavier\nlifting than ever before, Carson Helicopters was able to\ninstall an oversized belly tank on its S-61 Fire King (or,\nas the company likes to call it, the \xe2\x80\x9cSwiss Army knife of\nhelicopters\xe2\x80\x9d). With this modification, the Fire King is the\nonly Type 1 helicopter (the heaviest type of helicopter,\nbased on a scale of Type 1 to Type 3) that can carry up to\n\n15 firefighters and hold 1,000 gallons of water in its belly\ntank at the same time. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the helicopter has an\n8,000-pound onboard cargo capacity. There are currently\neight Fire Kings flying with the composite blades and the\n1,000-gallon belly tank. v\n\nTransportation \t 51\n\n'
