b'SUMMARY REPORT OF THE\nSIMULATION COMMITTEE\nRichard L. Kurkowski\nTechnical Assistant\nFlight Systems Research Division\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nThe Simulation Committee consisted of the following:\nRichard L. Kurkowski (Chairman), NASA/AmesResearch Co.\nCharles R. Chalk,\'Calspan Corporation\nPaul L. Jernigan, Douglas Aircraft Company\nJim Luers, University of Dayton Research Institute\nDwight R. Schaeffer, Boeing Aerospace Co.\nAs in the case of the other standing committees, this\ncommittee held a two hour session with each of the four\nrotating committees. The sessions were not highly structured\ns o as to allow a free exchange to determine the status of\naircraft/meteorology simulation technology, what the problem\nareas were, and what additional work was needed. Each of the\nfour sessions was surprisingly fresh, non-repetitive, and\nwith slightly different emphasis; however, the discussion\nrelative to wind shear seemed to dominate these meetings, as\nwell as the topic presentations.\nThe multitude of individual points of concern and information supplied in the four sessions have been summarized and\norganized using the following outline:\nI.

A software model of a system without pilot or hardware involved can be considered a simulator in a loose sense,\nand this approach is used extensively for paper studies of\naircraft and aircraft systems concepts. These studies\ninclude: aircraft performance, system performance, structural\nresponse, guidance navigation and control, failure mode\nanalyses, etc. Increased complexity comes with adding hardware such as in "iron bird" control system simulators, or\nwith the addition of a pilot station including controls and\ndisplays. A pilot simulator can be static base or moving\nbase. In training, static cockpits are used for procedures\ntraining with moving base simulators used for critical flight\nphases and failures where motion affects the pilot\'s control\nand systems management tasks. Training as used here includes\ninitial checkouts, type transitions, and recurrency or\nproficiency checks. Engineering and research simulators are\ngenerally more flexible devices wherein conditions and systems\n\n292\n\ncharacteristics can be quickly varied s o that a range of\nsystem parameters may be studied.\nBy their nature, Research Simulators tend to be the most\nflexible of any simulators and can be as complex as the task\nand size of the mission under study requires. Piloted\nsimulator studies include: flight dynamics, handling\nqualities, control systems, guidance systems, navigation,\nATC interface, certification criteria development, failure\nmode analyses, displays, and human factors. In addition,\nmore and more use is being made of the piloted simulator to\nrecreate the critical flight situation for aircraft accident\ninvestigations.\n11.\n\nAtmospheric Disturbance Modeling Requirements\n\nAtmospheric disturbance used in simulations include\nground level mean wind, wind shear and turbulence. Wind\nshear models should include both horizontal and vertical\nshears with time or altitude change. Turbulence models\nnormally include a11 three velocity components, oriented to\nthe body axis of the aircraft, i.e., longitudinal, lateral,\n)\nand vertical (u, v, w . The sophistication and fidelity of\nmodels for atmospheric disturbances vary as a function of:\nthe type of simulator, the study objectives or task to be\nperformed, and the resources (time, manpower, and money)\navailable to the project.\nFor training simulators, representative disturbance\nmodels can be used with some variation in intensity to expose\npilots to a range of situations. For instance, representative wind shears should be used to train pilots to recognize\nthe shear situation and learn how to cope with shear conditions. Research simulators have varying requirements for\ndisturbance modeling. For piloted simulators, again, representative models with varying intensity can be used. For\n\n293\nd\n\nautopilot studies, criteria development and structural\ndesign, accurate statistical and temporal models are required\nto assure accurate study results. For accident investigation\nsimulations, exact duplication of weather (ceiling and visibility, ground winds, wind shear, and turbulence) existing at\nthe time of the accident are required.\nThe common approach to simulating disturbances is to use\nfiltered random noise generator signals to simulate turbulence\nand to superimpose this on top of wind shear profiles which\nare stored as table look ups. For some simulation tasks\nthese models can be frozen (i,e., no altitude variation).\nOthers such as landing approach require variation with altitude and horizontal space. Some complex models have been\nmechanized with 4-D (x, y, z, t) characteristics.\n111. Status of Simulator Capabilities for Modeling\nDisturbances\n\nThe question was raised as to the capacity and capabilities of simulators to handle atmospheric disturbance data and\nmodels. This is a function of the specific simulator. With\nmost simulators using large memory capacity, there has been\nno problem in simulating local disturbances acting upon\nsimulated aircraft. Most training simulators have the\ncapacity to implement the turbulence and shear models. The\npoint was made that even though the models are adequate, the\nimplementation of the turbulence and wind models in training\nsimulators may be improperly mechanized.\nThe ability of the simulator to duplicate motion cues\nis highly variable depending upon the specific simulator and\nits degrees of freedom and "wash out" program. Very few\nsimulators can duplicate the very high acceleration associated\nwith severe turbulence environments, especially when you\n5onsider the low frequency, large amplitude, portion of the\n\n294\n\nresponse spectrum. Visual displays also start to limit and\nexhibit lags if driven outside their nominal amplitudefrequency envelope.\n\nIV.\n\nStatus of Atmospheric Disturbance Models\n\nAtmospheric disturbances may be divided into categories\nsuch as ground level mean winds, low level wind shears,\nterminal area wind shears, low altitude turbulence and high\naltitude turbulence. Using these categories a table was\nprepared by the group chairman to indicate the approximate\nstatus of disturbance model data as reflected by the\ncommittee meetings. This status is shown in Table I.\nTable I\nStatus of Atmospheric Disturbances Models\nI ta for Models\nNeeds\nAssimilation More\nidequate Dissemination Needec\nI\n\n.\n.\n\nGround Level Mean Wind\nWind Shear\nLow Leve1\nLocalized Effects\n(buildings, terrain,\ncarriers, nonaviation ships)\nTerminal Area\nStable Atmosphere\nInversion\nWarm Front\nUnstable Atmosphere\nThunderstorm\nAtmospheric Turbulence\nLow Altitude\nHigh Altitude\n\n295\n4\n\nJ\n\n?\n\n?\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nJ\nJ\n\nJ\nJ\n\nGround level mean wind data and models are generally\nadequate, although specific unique sites may require\nassimilation of existing data or additional data. Models of\nlow level wind shear with unique site characteristics such\nas buildings, terrain features, aircraft carrier, and "nonaviation" ships, are not readily available although work is\nprogressing in this area. Assimilation of existing data and\nadditional data is needed to model shears in warm front and\ninversion conditions. This is also true of gust. front wind\nshears associated with thunderstorms like the J F K accident\nconditions. More accurate data on this type of wind shear\nis needed to scope the magnitudes and characteristics which\ncan be expected in aircraft operations.\nAtmospheric turbulence models are in fair shape although\nadditional data and analysis of existing data is desirable.\nOne of the problems in this area is that there are t o o many\nmodels and some sort of standardization is required. Additionally, the models may not be implemented properly in the\nsimulation. Patchy qualities and intermittency of atmospheric turbulence needs to be specified. Some studies have\nshown that for piloted simulations, small variations in .\nspectral models are not significant to pilot ratings of aircraft handling qualities. Additional data is needed for\nVTOL aircraft operations and to answer spatial distribution\neffects questions.\nV.\n\nSpecific Problem Areas\n\nThis section points out specific problem areas which\nwere discussed in various categories and indicates in some\ninstances, potential research to solve the problems.\nA.\n\nDefinitions, Data Measurement, Analysis, and Format\n\nThere is a need for standardized definition of\nterms, e.g., what is the difference between turbulence and\n\n296\n\nwind shear? Basically it\'s a matter of frequency content\nbut the cutoff between the two can vary depending upon type\nof aircraft and approach speeds. Further definition is\nrequired. Terminology for wind shear should be standardized.\nConsiderable meteorological data has been gathered over\nthe years. Most of this data is not aircraft controlrelated and is more aimed at synoptic modeling with very low\nfrequency characteristics. Data suitable for aircraft\napplication has been and is being generated, however. But\nthese data need to be analyzed and translated into models\nwhich are in a format that the aeronautics user can apply.\nThe models should not be so complicated that whole computers\nare used up. Leadership and direction are needed in this\narea. Models should not be s o complicated that they permit\nduplication of all possible atmospheric cases. The models\nneed to be "simplified" and generalized for simulation purposes. Cooperation between meteorologists and engineers is\nrequired.\nTurbulence models need to be standardized. Boeing, for\ninstance, has some fifteen or more models in use in the\ncompany. Some Government organization should be involved to\ncause this standardization to come about. The turbulence\nmodel in MIL-F-8785B provided a start in this direction.\nHowever, users of the turbulence section of MIL-F-8785B\ndocument should be cautioned to consult AFFDL-TR-72-41,\ntitled "Revisions to MIL-F-8785 (ASG) , Proposed by Cornel1\nAeronautical Laboratory." TR-72-41 contains proposed revisions to section 3.7, Atmospheric Disturbances, including:\n1 New definition of the values for oU, ow, CJ\n)\n2) Interpretation of rotary gust disturbances\n3) Development of a wind shear model\n\n297\n1\n\nB.\n\nSimulation Studies Criteria\n\nMany simulation studies and analyses are made for\nthe purpose of determining a system\'s characteristics\nrelative to a set of accepted criteria. In military aircraft\nhandling qualities, for instance, MIL Spec. F-8785B has been\nthe guide for acceptability. Such criteria must be carefully determined so as to not lead to meaningless tests.\nWork on autoland systems was sighted as an area for better\ncriteria. Present requirements state a goal of one fatal\naccident on lo-\' landings. Companies are interpreting this\ncriteria literally and devising simplified analog simulation\nwhich is run at fast time for many, many trials. Complex\ndigital simulations which run at real time or slower can\nbecome very expensive and time-consuming. More guidance is\nt\nrequired in this area. I was felt that narrower error dispersions should be required. New approaches were suggested\nsuch as used by Foster and Neuman (NASA-Ames) wherein turbulence and wind shear disturbance cases for autoland were\nlimited to those which could cause large dispersions and hard\nlandings.\nC. Atmospheric Disturbance Models\nWith regard to wind shear, a need was expressed for\nmore information on local effects of terrain, buildings, etc.,\non flow in the local environs of airports, STOL ports, or\nVTOL pads. Specific concern was expressed over the St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, situation. The FAA would like a model\nof the flow for this airport which they could use as a guide\non wind sensor locations for providing landing aircraft\npilots with better information than is presently available.\nOne technique for flow visualization of such situation was\nsuggested. This would entail photographs of snow showers and\nthe flow patterns. This would not work, of course, for warm\nclimates but maybe smoke pots could be used for this approach.\n\n298\n\nModels are needed to define the shear environment in\nthe vicinity of thunderstorms where the most severe cases\noccur. NSSL severe thunderstorm data bank is extensive and\nadditional spring storms data is in the process of being\ngathered. Analysis and modeling of this data will be used\nto try to forecast storm severity and turbulence especially\nfor gust fronts, and to predict turbulence and shear magnitudes to be expected.\nFor training simulators, representative wind shear\nmodels are needed, including severe conditions, in order to\nexpose pilots to wind shear situations, especially those\nwhich exceed the performance capabilities of transport aircraft .\nWith regard to atmospheric turbulence modeling for\nsimulation, there was no unanimous agreement on any one of\nthe many turbulence models now in the literature and under\ndevelopment. It was felt that the MIL spec F-8785B turbulence model was a very good start but more work is required.\nAdditional analysis is required on the variation of scale\nlength and rms intensity with altitude. Indications are that\nthe scale length for low altitude should be smaller than\nspecified in the MIL spec model. Considerable work has been\ndone on non-Gaussian models which exhibit more patchy and\nmore intermittent characteristics similar to those observed\nin measured data. Some controversy developed over this\npoint. It was suggested that the present Gaussian models\nwould also appear patchy if the proper axis reference system\nwas used. Most turbulence model mechanizations are oriented\nto the aircraft body axis system. It was argued that the\nturbulence should be modeled in an earth reference wind axis\nsystem and then transferred to the aircraft trody axis as a\nfunction of aircraft heading, etc. Additional information\nwas provided which showed a strong coherence of turbulence\n\n234\n1\n\ndata a t v a r i o u s a l t i t u d e s .

There is no standard model for\nthis case. The MIL Spec model can be tricked into working\nfor this case by including very small mean velocities in the\nmodel. In addition, there is a need for turbulence and wind\nshear models for VTOL aircraft landing on small ships, in\nsome cases on a notched step on the stern of the ship. The\nwake of the ship could cause considerable control probl-ems.\n\nD. Aircraft/Atmospheric Disturbance Response Modeling\nMore attention must be given to mechanization of\natmospheric disturbances and related modeling of aircraft\nresponses to these disturbances. Many simulation reports\ncome out without any documentation of the algorithms used in\nthe mechanization. It was suggested that future reports\nshould include this information or at least give reference\nto such documentation. One such undocumented variation is\nthe axes system used. As stated earlier, most mechanizations\norient mean wind to earth reference and turbulence to body\nsxes. Yet considerable statistical and tower turbulence data\nis referenced to the mean direction of the wind. A s stated,\nsimulations should be done with turbulence and mean wind\nreferenced to earth and transformed to aircraft body axes.\nIt was noted that airline training simulators are not generally programmed properly to simulate wind shear. They do\nhave approximations of shear which can scare pilots a bit\nbut most need to be reprogrammed to more properly simulate\nrepresentative shear profiles. Further work is needed in\nmethods to model disturbances as distributed lift rather than\nthe common single point model. Information is needed on VTOL\nairplane response to large sideslip situations. This is the\ncritical area for most high performance VTOL aircraft. Wind\ntunnel data is required.\n\n301\n1\n\nE. Critical Case Studies\nFurther information is needed to determine what\nthe critical wind shear profiles and magnitudes are which\nwould induce hard landings for various types of aircraft.\nDifferent aircraft types will have different response to the\nsame wind shear. For a given aircraft, variations should\ninclude configuration and weight variations and engine out\ncases. For training simulators, only a limited number of\nwfnd shear models need be defined (maybe four). Magnitudes\nshould be varied to include limit situations and less severe\ncases. For research and engineering simulators, a limited\nnumber of profiles need to be defined. These should include\nvariable shear and variable direction. For structural design\nonly extreme cases need to be defined. One method of analysis was suggested based on Boeing SST studies wherein joint\nprobabilities of turbulence and failure states were determined for various criticality levels. Possibly a wind shear\nanalysis could be made in an analogous manner.\nF. Atmospheric Disturbances and Meteorological\nConditions\nSome discussion was held on the relationship of\ndisturbances and meteorological condition (i.e., ceilings,\nvisibilities). For instance, there are some areas of the\nworld where high wind and fog exist simultaneously, but this\nis not the general case. Generally, speeds are low and turbulence is low when fog exists. Correlation between visual\nobservations of thunderstorms or rain showers and severity\nof disturbances cannot be reliably made. For instance, John\nBliss, the Flying Tiger captain who preceded the fatal\nEAL 727 flight in approach to JFK in June \'75, stated that he\nhad flown through lots of rain showers that looked worse than\nthis one at Kennedy.\n\n302\na\n\nG.\n\nPilot Learning Effects\n\nSome discussion centered on the learning effects\nin piloted simulations. There is a risk that if only a few\nmodels are used, pilots can learn the wind shear profile\nthe simulator; however, the problem may not\nand lloutsmart\'\'\nbe significant for "production" training programs where\nthere generally is not very much time to take a long look at\nspecial situations. For research and engineering simulations\nwhere case after case is run, project engineers need to\nguard against the learning effect for valid results.\n\nH. Operations Related Discussions\nIt was suggested that aircraft equipped with\ninertial navigation systems be used to measure wind conditions and be used as real time probes on a routine basis.\nThis information could be automatically transmitted to\napproach control for use in advising subsequent aircraft\nduring their landing approach. It may even be possible to\nuse the transponder to transmit wind info directly back up to\nother aircraft.\nThe question of autoland vs. pilot role was raised.\nSpecifically, it was suggested that much of the problem with\nwind shear during approach disappears if the autoland is\nleft engaged. This was countered with the fact that most\naircraft do not have autoland systems. Even if they did,\na CAT I11 beam must be used to touchdown and not many airports have CAT I11 qualified ILS systems. So autoland is not\nthe total answer to the problem. It was suggested that a\npotential research program should examine further the pilot\'s\nrole during autoland approaches especially in the event of\nstrong wind shears. If the pilot dislikes the autoland\napproach and disengages at low altitude, large transients due\nto the disengage could be more than the pilot can handle.\n\n303\n\n'
