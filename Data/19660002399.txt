Even among the biggest defense contractors--the canpanies receiving the largest amounts of contract wards fran DOD and USA-the m J o r i t y look t o civilian markets f o r the bulk of their sales.\nNevertheless, because of the unusual nature of the ecananic resources\ndevoted t o defense and space prograna, they affect the American econcmgr in\nSeveral important ways.\n\nThe following is a sampling of these impacts:\n\n1 Defense/space programs u t i l i z e a major share of the s c i e n t i f i c\n.\nand engineering t a l e n t i n the thited States; t h i s tremendous demand may have\n\ncreated more than a l i t t l e of its own supply, and that f o r the rest of the\neconany as w e l l .\n\n-22\n.\n\nDefense/space programs receive the great bulk of a l l the goods and\n\nservices purchased by the Federal Government; i n creating t h i s vast market\nf o r private industry, these programs have also served as the instrument\nf o r the expansion of the d i r e c t role of the Federal Government i n the\nAmerican economy as a purchaser and consmer of\' goods and services.\n\n3.\n\nBecause of the specialized nature of\' defense/spsce purchases-\n\nprimarily high-technology weapon and space systems--a relatively few durable\ngoods industries provide most of these needs.\n\nIn turn, these industries\n\nhave becane the leading growth industries i n the Nation and the regions i n\nwhich they cluster among the fastest growing areas.\n\n4.\n\nT e expansion of defense/space programs also signifies that an\nh\n\nincreasing share of the national econcsny is independent of the level, or\nof changes i n the level, of private consumption and investment; these\ngovernmental programs are independent of forces producing fluctuations i n the\nprivate sector of the economy because they respcmd t o a different set of\ndemands\n\n.\n\nSane s t a t i s t i c a l perspectives m a y be h e l p f u l in understanding the\n\nnature of the r o l e that defense and space programs p l a y in the national economy.\nSane Aggregate Comparisons\nU n t i l ccmparatively recently, expenditures f o r national security w e r e\n\na very minor factor i n t o t a l econmic activity.\n\nI n the half\' century p r i o r\n\nt o 1930, such outlays normally equaled less than one percent of the Gross\nNational Product(GNP), except \'for the World W a r I period.\nmilitary\n\nOUthyS\n\naveraged 1.3 percent of GNP.\n\nRm 1931 t o 1939\na\n\nWorld W a r 11, of course,\n\nraised security programs t o what appesrs t o be a relatively permanent high\n\nl e v e l i n the American econcpny.\n\nPresently, purchase6 by the Department of\n\n-3Defense and NASA are $57 b i l l i o n or 9.7 percent of the t o t a l output of the\nNation.\n\na\n!Be proportion w a s even higher during World Wr I1 (peak of 48\n\npercent) and the Korean W a r (peak of 12 percent).\nAn alternative measure of the econcinic impact of defense/space\n\na c t i v l t y i s the portion of the work force devoted t o defense activities.\nFigures f o r 1963 reveal t h a t 6.7 million workers were in defense-related\nemployment, representing 9.4 percent of t o t a l United States employment.\n\nA\n\nl i t t l e over half\'were employed d i r e c t l y by the Federal Government, either i n\nthe Armed Forces o r i n defense-related work in Federal agencies.\n\nThe remainder\n\nwere i n defense-related employment i n private industry, working f o r prhe\n\ndefense contractors, subcontractors or firms providing materials and services\n\nt o contractors.\nB e current level of military demand r e f l e c t s an extended period of\n\ns\nCold War, interspersed by incidents leading t o limited conflicts, such a\nKorea and Viet Nan, and temporary thaws end defense cutbacks, such as i n 1957-58\nand i n 1963-64.\n\nAn abrupt change in the nature of the external environment,\n\nand in the countryss reaction t o it, would cause another major s h i f t from the\npresent proportion of a l i t t l e l e s s than one-tenth of the Nation\'s resources\nbeing devoted t o armaments and related security programs. (See Table 1)\nClearly, the level and composition of national security demands are relatively\nindependent of influences i n the private econcany.\n\nDefense and space spending\n\ndoes not regularly a c t as a stabilizer t o counter swings i n private consumption\nor investment, b u t neither does it necessarily move in p a r a l l e l t o accentuate\nsuch destabilizing swings in the private economy.\nThe impact of defense and space spending on the economy depends on\n\nmany factors other than the level and r a t e of change of such spending.\n\n-4-\n\nTable 1\n\nMEASURES OF TEIE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF DEFENSE/SPACE PROGRAMS\n\nDATA FOR 1963\n\nG P Cmparisons (dollar amounts i n billions)\nI\nV\nGross Mational Product\n\n$585 1\n\nPurchases of goods and services f o r\nNational Defense\n\n$ 56.7\n\nN a t i o n a l Defense as percent of GlQ\n\n9-75\n\nmployment ~csnparisons(in millions)\n\nTotal U.S.\n\nemployment\n\n71.5\n\nEstimated defense-related employment\n\nDefense employment as percent of t o t a l\n\nSource:\n\n6.7\n9.4$\n\nU.S. Departments of Cunmerce and Labor.\n\n-5Heavy reliance on d e f i c i t financing during World W a r 1 , in contrast t o the\n1\ntax financing of the Korean W a r , produced different results on consumer incame\n\nand spending and, hence, different econmic stabilization problems.\n\nVariations\n\ni n tax structures t o finance any given level of expenditures are l i k e l y t o\ninfluence the impact of defense and space outlays.\n\nAlso, consuner and business\n\nexpectations may d i f f e r fran one period t o another.\n\nFinally, the availability\n\nof resources a l s o affects the timing and extent of the impact on prices, production, and economic growth.\n\nLr\n\nBudgetary Implications\nMilitary and space spending daminates the Federal Budget.\n\nFram the\n\npoint of view of econGmic activity, these programs account f o r over 85 percent of a3lFederalGovernment purchases of goods and services.\n\nIn real\n\nterms (when the dollar figures are adjusted t o eliminate changes resulting frm\ninflation) virtually a l l of the increase i n the absolute amount of Federal\npurchases during the past two decades has been accounted f o r by defense\nand space programs.\n\nIn the aggregate, purchases of all other Federal Government\n\nagencies are a t about the sane level as i n 1940. The large increases i n\nFederal Government spending for civilian purposes have been transfer payments\n\nand grants, which do not shuw up directly i n GI@.\n\nHence, the rise i n the\n\nFederal share of GNP frm 6.2 percent i n 1940 t o 10.3 percent i n 1964 has been\naccounted f o r entirely by defense/space expenditures.\n\nO this basis, it can\nn\n\nbe seen t h a t these security-related expenditures have served, intentionally\nor otherwise, as the means for the expansion of the position of the Federal\nGovernment aa\n\net\n\npurchaser and consumer of g o d s and services.\n\nT e rather unique composition of military and space requirements\nh\naffords useful insights i n t o the nature of the resources required t o meet these\n\n-6needs and of the resultant geographical and industrial d i s t r i b u t i o n of these\nresowces.\n\nAs can\n\nbe seen i n Table 2, c a p i t a l outlays--which roughly correspond\n\nto plant and equipment expenditures in the private ecancpny--receive 47 percent\nof the funds. This is in striking contrast t o other sectors of the ecanany,\nsuch as casumer purchases of goads and services.\n\nConsumer spending on durable8\n\n(including residential housing) accounts for only 21. percent of t o t a l personal\nconsumption expenditures plus housing.\n\nSuch hard g o d s or c a p i t a l i t a s\n\nprodwed for IX)D and NASA are currently almost half as large\n\n88\n\nthe t o t a l\n\nproduction of new plant and equipment f o r the private sector of the econctny.\n\nWithin the c a p i t a l outlays segment, the concentration on research and\ndeveloplnent (R&D)--$\n\npercent of capital outlays--is noteworthy.\n\nThese R&D\n\ndlsbursemnts of the Department of Defense and RASA, in turn, Finance about\n\nf\nthree-fiftbs o\' a l l the R&D performed i n the United States.\n\nPley also represent\n\nthe m a o r element in the rising trend of R&D in the United States in recent\nyears, f a r surpassing in d o l l a r significance the increase i n RdJ) funds\nsupplied by all other sources, inclUaing private industry, colleges end\n\nuniversities, and other nonprofit institutions.\nReflecting the tremendous input of science and technology, the can-\n\n.\n\n-.-\n\nposition of the capit& goods acquired by defense and space programs has\nchanged significantly and frequently in the period since World War 1 .

For a typical cmpany producing aerospace systems, engineers and\nrelated technical personnel no longer constitute merely a single important\nb u t limited department.\n\nThey may exceed i n actual numbers the total. of\n\nfactory or "blue collar" employment.\n\nIn large measure, these companies\n\nhave became primarily large aggregations of R&D resources.\nAircraft and missile campanies alone employ more s c i e n t i s t s and\nengineers on research and development work than the cambined t o t a l of the\nchemical, drug, petroleum, motor vehicle, rubber, and machinery industries.\nIt has been estimated t h a t about 52 percent of all the s c i e n t i s t s and -\n\nengineers doing F W work in American industry are engaged on projects funded\ne i t h e r by DOD or NASA.\nAnother striking relationship found between defense/space procurement\ntrends and the American economy i s the close correspondence between "growth"\nindustries and the industry groupings t h a t comprise the m a o r DOD and NASA\n\n-14suppliers, notably aerospace and electronics.\n\nL3\n\nA study of the e a r l i e r\n\npostwar period concluded t h a t fluctuations i n these security-related\n\n14\n\npurchases a l s o were a major source of the shift in i n d u s t r i a l output patterns.\nChangbg Manpower Requ3,zemf33*8\nAs a result of the change i n product m i x , there has also been a change\n\nin the occupational distribution of defense/space employment i n private\nidustry.\n\nThe change i s characterized by a high proportion of workers i n\n\nprofessional and technical occupations and a below average proportion at\nthe lower levels of skills.\n\nScientists and engineers are, of all occupational\n\ngroups, the ones most involved i n the defense and space programs.\n\nAbout\n\none out of every four i n the country were on work connected with these\n\nprograms in 1963.\nIn 1958, production workers represented 64 percent of the work force\n\ni n the f i v e major defense-related industries as cmpared t o 75 percent in\nmanufacturing as a whole.\n\nBy 1963, t h e proportion of workers i n production\n\njobs had f a l l e n t o 57 percent in the defense industries, whereas in t o t a l\n\nm n f cum it had declined only 1percent t o 74 percent.\na ua t r\n\nA t the same\n\ntime, the proportion of defense workers i n professional and technical\n\n\'\n\noccupations w a s two-thirds higher than the corresponding figure f o r workers\ni all manufacturing.\nn\n\nA t t h e other end of the occupational ladder, only\n\n2 percent of the employees i n defense p l a n t s were i n semi-skilled o r\n7\nskilled jobs, while\n\nUr\n\n63 percent of t h e workers i n c i v i l i a n plants were i n\n\nthese occupational categories.\nThe defense and space programs, however, acted as more than sources\n\nof demand for scientists, engineers, and other technical employees.\n\nBoth\n\n-15-\n\nI\n\nd i r e c t l y and indirectly, they served t o increase the supply of such personnel.\n\nI\n\nThe d i r e c t means included university fellowships, aid t o research funding,\nand training programs.\n\nThe more indirect influence on the supply of\n\ns c i e n t i s t s and engineers was in creating a favorable labor market f o r them,\nvia increasing pay rates and employment opportunities,\n\nI n addition, there ha9 been a significant movement f r a military\nemployment, both those with government agencies and t\'nose w i t h defense\ncontractors, t o the private economy.\n\nacquired i n the military service (over 16 percent of enlisted personnel\nseparations frm the Armed Services during the period 1957-63 were trained\ni n electronic skills, either as operators of equipment or as ma3ntenance\nA example of the movement of defense industry personnel t o\nn\n\nc i v i l i a n work occurred as the result of the m a - S o a r cancellation;

i l i t y t o canpete for the m i l i t a r y business available,\n\n-1gHowever, in scme states, relatively large amounts of defenselspace\nwork represent comparatively small portions of t o t a l

i r relatively high degree of dependence on defense and space\nwork, are especially affected by shifts in the types of these prow=.\n\nOne\n\nindication of the magnitude of t h i s dependence is the portion of the state\'s\npersonal income derived fran direct military payrolls and fran wages and\n\nsalaries of defense workers in private Industry.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, six\n\nstates depend on defense and space work for at least 10 percent of persona3\nincome--Virginia,\n\nUtah, Washbgbn, California, Alaska, and Hawaii.\n\nFor all\n\nother states, t h e proportion is less than 10 percent.\n\nWithin various state^, the concentration I s far greater; important\nexamples are such metzopolitan areas as Washington, DmC., Boston, tlichita,\no\nHuntsville, Cape Kennedy, L s Angeles

capabilities of established\nmanufacturing firms were drawn upon.\n\nWith the increasing importance of\n\na i r c r a f t , missiles, electronics, and space systems, newer firms became\nincreasingly important and they tended t o locate i n the newer industrial\ns t a t e s of California, Texas, Washington, o r in rejuvenated New Ebgland states.\nThe dalnance of California is e\n\nm more striking,

industry\n\nemployees working on these programs show up d i r e c t l y i n persond incane,\nand also are reflected in t h e Gross National Product.\n\nThe inves-hnent\n\noutlays by government

are f e l t of an induced\nnature (so-called multiplier and accelerator effects).\n\nThe m u l t i p l i e r\n\ne f f e c t of government purchases frm private industry has been estimated i n\nthe

million dollars, state and local revenues of 30\nmillion dollars, and reduee unemployment insurance costs by 160 million\ndollars.\n\nLE\n\nHence, the net budgetary costs of defense and space programs\n\nwould appear t o be rather l e s s than the gross o r clearly visible expenditureB.\n\nThere i s yet another aspect of the economic impact of defense/space\nprograms which may be more illusive, more controversial, and possibly in the\nlongrun of greater significance.\n\nThat is the "spillover," "fall-out" o r\n\ntransfer of defense and space technology t o other areas of the

concern i s that\nshort-run considerations may impair the long-term capability of the economy\nt o support a large and sometimes expanding array of national security programs.\n\nmere i s no simple o r generally agreed on method t o measure or determine the "burden" of defense and space programs on the economy, much less\nwhat, if any, econmic ceiling exists on such programs.\n\nUsing the GNP caparison, the portion of our national resources devoted\nt o armaments has tended t o diminish rather than increase i n recent years,\nfrcan 10.5 percent i n 1957 t o 8.4 percent in 1964.\n\nDuring m u c h of t h a t\n\nperiod, considerable unutilized or underutilized capacity existed in the\neconc%oy, far more than was generally desired.\n\nPrice inflation has not\n\nbeen particularly troublesame i n recent years; the wholesale price index\nhas fluctuated within the narrow range of 99.0 t o 100.7 from 1957 t o\n\n1964. (Base of 1957-59 = 100).\nWith reference t o the concern over budgetary deficits, it should be\n\nrecalled that t h e major increases i n Federal expenditures in recent years\nhave occurred i n the dmestic civilian area, particularly i n the education,\nwelfare, and health programs.\n\nThe balance-of-payments problem continues.\n\n-29However, the impact of national security programs here i s not i n terms of its\nt o t a l , but of t i e allocation between dmestic and overseas outlays.\n\nIn\n\nt h i s latter connection, I W A programs have l i t t l e impact on the balance of\n\npayments and the DOD has taken numerous steps t o reduce i t s adverse influence\n\non U S\n..\n\ninternational accounts.\nThe r e a l cost t o society of allocating productive resources t o defense\n\nand space programs may be said t o be that these resources axe unavailable\nf o r other purposes.\n\nYet, such resources\n\nother uses i n practice.\n\n~ca$\nnot\n\nbe entirely diverted fram\n\nSame or all of the resources so used m i g h t have\n\nremained unemployed but f o r the expansion of defense or space activities.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is any such sacrifice in a given time period,\nand i f the loss is i n investment, additional sacrifices will accrue in\n\nsubsequent time periods as society foregoes the returns on the absent\ninvestment.\nEven where resources utilized by defense and space programs are diverted\n\nfrm other sectors, the value of the resultant output does not necessarily\nmeasure the value of the output diverted frm the c i v i l i a n sectors.\n\nFor\n\nexample, when resources s h i f t from cmparatively low-valued products such\n\nas agriculture t o high-valued products such as space exploration systems,\nthe increment of\' GBP so absorbs exceeds in value the output yielded by the\n\nSuch structural shifts axe a characteristic of t h e develop-\n\nprivate sector.\n\n-\n\nment of the American economy and a manifestation of i t s r e l a t i v e l y

r e f l e c t as to the allocation of me of our most\n\nv i t a l resources, science and technology.\nOverall, available analyses of the "bueden" of defense/space expenditures\nhave generally concluded that, if necessary f o r military or p o l i t i c a l\nr e a m s , the American econany could handle, with a minimum of dislocation o r\nhardship, a far higher level of such spending than haa been experienced in\n\nrecent yeaxs.\n\nSuch studies o r statements have been made by such diverse\n\ngroups as the Committee f o r Econcsnic Development, the National\n\nPlanning\n\nAssociation, a panel of the United States Arms Control and Dissnnaanent\nAgency, and a groug of outstanding university and research econanists appearing before the J o i n t E c o n d c Camnittee of the Congress.\n\nHowever,\n\nmafly such\n\nanalyses also concluded that t h e long-term growth and prosperity of the\nUnited States do not require even the current l e v e l of national security\nspending.\n\n/14\n\nHence, economic constraints do not appear t o be an important l i m i t a t i c m\n\non the level of defense or space spending-directly.\n\nIddirectly, and\n\nessentially through the Federal bu3getary process, financial constraints have\n\nand are likely t o continue t o restrict the portion of the Nation\'s resources\ndevoted to these purposes.\n\nThis, of course, r e f l e c t s the fact that govern-\n\nmental appropriations for these items are not made i n isolation, but result\n\nf o the interplay of many conflicting requirements and M\nrm\n\ns\n\n,

Tsx reductions helped t o maintain aggregate consumer\n\n.\n\nincane and personal consumption spending.\n\nThe l e v e l off i n the t o t a l of\n\ndefense and space spending I 1963-64 was accanpanied by a decline in the\nn\nnational unemployment rate, clearly indicating the capability of the American\neconamy to &Just rapidly at least t o moderate changes in defense or space\n\nexpenditures.\nNumerous studies of t h e econmic impact of\n\n80s\n11\n\ncontrol and dis-\n\narmament have cancluded that the United States is fully capable of malting\nthe necessary econanic adjustment t o fundamental reductions in the level of\n\nnational security expenditures; the Urnitations are considered t o be mainly\n\ni n the p o l l t i c a l sphere-the\n\nwillingness of the Nation t o take measures of\n\nsufficient magnitude and prcmptnees t o u t i l i z e the resources t h a t would\n\n/15\n\nbe released in such eventuality.\n\n-32Footnotes\n\nE Burns, "MiUtary Expenditures, Econauic GrUWkh, and .\n.\n.Stability," in US Congress, Joint Econanic CQmaittee, Federal\n..\nBpenditure Policy f o r E c o n d c Grcrwth and Stability, 1957, p 509;\n.\nMOL.
