In recent work we have demonstrated short-term frequency stability of 3 x 10(exp -14)/nu(sub tau) when a cryogenic oscillator of stability 2-3 x 10(exp 15) was used a the local oscillator. The trapped ion frequency standard employs a Hg-202 discharge lamp to optically pump the trapped Hg(+)-199 clock ions and a helium buffer gas to cool the ions to near room temperature. We describe a small Hg(+) ion trap based frequency standard with an extended linear ion trap (LITE) architecture which separates the optical state selection region from the clock resonance region. This separation allows the use of novel trap configurations in the resonance region since no optical pumping is carried out there. A method for measuring the size of an ion cloud inside a linear trap with a 12-rod trap is currently being investigated. At approx. 10(exp -12), the 2nd order Doppler shift for trapped mercury ion frequency standards is one of the largest frequency offsets and its measurement to the 1% level would represent an advance in insuring the very long-term stability of these standards to the 10(exp -14) or better level. Finally, we describe atomic clock comparison experiments that can probe for a time variation of the fine structure constant, alpha = e(exp 2)/2(pi)hc, at the level of 10(exp -20)/year as predicted in some Grand Unified String Theories.", "title": "Hg(+) Frequency Standards", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000056935, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Prestage, John D."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "43099da24732489ca748ee13b6b1e6db"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000056935, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tjoelker, Robert L."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "01ea7f13be97459e9e0dfcf2ce63aabd"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20000056935, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Maleki, Lute"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "7ef3310c0d664171a9f509b03696dfaa"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000056935, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000056935, "id": "fd0bd05e280048639b5835120426d1a1", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000056935.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000056935/downloads/20000056935.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000056935/downloads/20000056935.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000056935/downloads/20000056935.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
