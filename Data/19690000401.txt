Conventional fluid\nlubricants cannot be used in vacuum without hermetic\nsealing as these rapidly volatilize under the low pressure and expose the metal wearing surfaces to seizure\nand binding. Solid-film lubricants are effective only\nfor relatively short-term use. Gears, and other rotating\nmechanical parts, made entirely of a self-lubricating\nplastic, such as polytetrafluoreothylene (TFE), have a\nlimited load-carrying capability compared to gears\nmade of metal.\nThe new self-lubricating gears are constructed of\nalternating layers of metal and a dry lubricant material,\ne.g., TFE with a suitable reinforcing material (such\n\nMetal Layers\n\nas bronze powder) bonded into a laminated composite\nunit which is machined to form a standard gear. The\nlubricating material is layered in planes at an angle\nwith respect to the top and bottom metal surfaces of\nthe gear; so that during rotation, the dry lubricating\nmaterial tends to move across the entire meshing\nsurface of the opposing gear and thereby provide a\ncontinuous replenishment of an interfacial lubricant\nfilm. The use of an odd number of gear teeth on one\ngear of each set will ensure a full 360-degree lubricant\ninterface. The advantage of this gear construction\nis that it combines the strength of a metal, such as\nhardened steel, for high load-carrying capacity and a\ncontinuously replenishable, solid-film lubricant between the meshing surfaces of a gear set.\ncontinued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
