This map\nshows that all areas on Mars at a scale of 1\xc2\xb0 latitude by 1\xc2\xb0 longitude have\nrocks exposed at the surface, and no areas have more than 25-30% rock cover.\nRocks are most common in high-inertia regions, such as Valles Mariners and\nAcidalia Planitia, and are less abundant in Tharis, Arabia, and Elysium.\nThese observations were used to assess the importance of major dust\nstorms in the deposition and removal of fine dust material, both at present\nand in the past.\n\nThermal, radar, and visual remote sensing observations were\n\nused to determine the location and physical properties of regional dust\ndeposits, located in Tharsis, Arabia and Elysium. The surfaces are covered by\nfine (~2-40 urn), bright (albedo > 0.27) particles, with fewer exposed rocks\nand coarse deposits than found elsewhere. Dust is currently deposited\nuniformly throughout the equatorial region at a rate of -40 um/global storm.\nOver geologic time the rate of accumulation may vary from 0 to 250 pm/year due\nto changes in atmospheric conditions produced by orbital variations.\n\nDust\n\ndeposited during global storms is subsequently removed only from dark regions,\nresulting a net accumulation in the low-inertia, bright regions.\n\nThe\n\nthickness of these current dust deposits is 0.1 to 2 meters. The thermal\ninertia places a lower limit of -0.1 m on the thickness of these deposits,\nwhile the sparse but ubiquitous presence of exposed rocks and the degree of\n\n3\nvisible mantling indicate that the thickness is less than 5 meters.\nDual-polarization radar observations of a very rough texture in Tharsis are\nconsistent with this model, with a ~2 ra thick dust layer burying most of the\nsurface rocks but permitting radar sampling of the rough sub-surface. Based\non their thickness and rate of accumulation, the age of these deposits is\n105-106 years, suggesting a cyclic process of deposition and removal.\n\nOne\n\npossible cause may be cyclic variations in the magnitude and location of\nmaximum wind velocities related to variations in Mars\' orbit. At present,\nperihelion and maximum wind velocities occur in the south whereas regional\ndust deposits occur in the north, suggesting net transport from south to\nnorth.\n\nOrbital parameters oscillate with periods ranging from SxlO1* to 106\n\nyears. The agreement between these periods and the dust deposit age suggests\na possible link.\n\nAt different stages in orbit evolution, maximum wind\n\nvelocities will occur in the north, with subsequent erosion and redistribution\nof the accumulated fines.\n\nBased on this model, much of the uppermost martian\n\nsurface is very young and is being continually reworked.\nGlobal remote sensing observations were also used to derive a simple,\nself-consistent model for the surface layer. The data sets used include radar\ncross-section measurements at several wavelengths, radio whole-disk thermal\nemission observations at two wavelengths, the global distribution of thermal\ninertia, deviations of diurnal temperatures from those of a homogeneous model,\nand thermal spectral estimates of surface rock abundance and of the thermal\ninertia of the non-rocky component of the surface.\n\nThe data sets which most\n\nconstrain the interpretation are the rock abundance map and the correlation of\nthermal inertia with radar cross-section; these require the rock abundance to\nnot vary significantly from place to place, and simultaneously require the\ndensity and thermal inertia of the fines to vary in a consistent manner. The\n\n4\n\nsimplest model which can explain all of the data involves a global\ncase-hardened crust ("duricrust") which varies spatially in its degree of\nformation.\n\nIn general, low-thermal-inertia\n\nregions have a poorly-developed\n\ncrust and high-inertia regions have a well-developed crust; there are, however\nregions that consist of coarse particles, which do not fit\nChryse).\n\nthis model (e.g.,\n\nThis model is consistent with the ages of low-inertia regions, and\n\nwith aeolian mechanisms for their development.\n\nThe duricrust is thought to\n\nform via the mobilization of salt ions within a layer of water adsorbed within\nthe tegolith, and its\n\nformation may be associated with the exchange of water\n\nbetween the regolith and atmosphere which occurs on the 105- and 10^-year\ntimescale.\nViking Lander Sites\nThe models discussed above were compared to observations at the two\nLander sites to determine whether these sites were representative of Mars as a\nwhole.\n\nIt was found that the Lander sites do not fit most of the global\n\ntrends of remote-sensing data.\n\nThe presence of a duricrust in the top meter\n\nof the surface is inferred for most regions of high thermal inertia, but the\nduricust is thinner at the Lander sites than elsewhere.\n\nRegions of low\n\nthermal inertia are covered by greater than several centimeters of\nunconsolidated dust.\n\nA thin, microns-thick layer of bright dust appears at\n\nthe surface at the Lander sites, and these locations may be regions of\nincipient formation of low thermal inertia.\n\nThus, the Lander sites are\n\nintermediate in structure between classical bright and dark regions, and are\ndistinctive from most of the rest of the planet.\nTharsis Volcanoes\nPhotographs and other remote sensing data of Ascraeus Mons were analyzed\nin order to relate the remotely determined surface properties to the geology\n\n5\nof the volcano.\n\nPhotogeologic analysis indicates that Ascraeus Mons Is\n\nsimilar to terrestrial basaltic shield volcanoes in both surface morphology\nand estimated rheologic properties. Lava flows are interpreted to include\npahoehoe, aa, and toey pahoehoe, with deposits of aeolian or pyroclastic\nmaterials on the surface above 15 km elevation.\n\nThe wavelength dependence of\n\nalbedos on Ascraeus Mons parallels the reflectance spectrum of classical high\nalbedo regions (e.g. Arabia), which suggests that dust is present throughout\nthe volcano summit area. High spatial resolution infrared sequences show no\ncorrelation between the thermal properties and surface terrains, including\nvarious lava flow terrains, consistent with dust deposits at least 2 cm thick\non all terrains.\n\nCaldera walls have the highest thermal inertias of the\n\nvolcano but bedrock exposures probably account for < 15% of the observed area.\nThermal inertias increase down the flanks of the volcano, but the areal\nabundance of high thermal inertia materials (I = 30) decreases; downslope\nsediment transportation and sorting could account for both of these trends.\nThe properties of Ascraeus Mons at visual and infrared wavelengths are\ndominated by surface materials that do not appear to be directly associated\nwith the underlying terrains suggesting resurfacing by windblown dust.\nLunae Planum-Kasei Vallis\nThe Kasei Vallis-Lunae Planum region of Mars was investigated using\nradiometrically calibrated 3-color Viking Orblter image data, high-resolution\nViking monochromatic images, Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data, and\nvisible and near-^infrared reflectance spectra of regions on Mars and\nterrestrial analog materials.\n\nIRTM thermal inertia values for Lunae Planum\n\nare relatively low, indicating a fine-grained surface.\n\nThermal inertia values\n\nfor Kasei channel floors are higher, especially in association with very dark\npatches and streaks which have among the highest thermal inertia values\n\n6\nobserved for Mars.\n\nThe bright and reddest surface exposures in this region\n\nhave colors (albedo ratios) similar to the low-inertia, high-albedo regions.\nThe lowest-albedo areas in this study region are the high-inertia streaks on\nthe channel floors, which have a significantly lower Red/Violet ratio than\nany previously observed dark, non-volatile raartian materials.\n\nThese\n\nreflectance properties are consistent with unweathered or only slightly\nweathered basalt or basaltic glass.\n\nCombined with thermal inertia size\n\nestimates of 1-4 mm and morphologic evidence, it appears that these dark\nexposures are aeolian dune deposit fragments. The individual particles are\napparently mobile enough at the present time to prevent significant\naccumulation of aeolian dust or surface weathering products.\nPUBLICATIONS\nPapers\n\nChristensen, P.R., 1982, Martian dust mantling and surface composition:\nInterpretation of thermophysical properties, J.
