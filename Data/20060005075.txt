b'Sage Simulation Model\nfor Technology Demonstration Convertor\nby a Step-by-Step Approach\nRikako Demko* and L. Barry Penswick.\xe2\x80\xa0\nSest, Inc., Middleburg Heights, Ohio 44130\n\nThe development of a Stirling model using the 1-D Sage design code was completed using\na step-by-step approach. This is a method of gradually increasing the complexity of the Sage\nmodel while observing the energy balance and energy losses at each step of the development.\nThis step-by-step model development and energy-flow analysis can clarify where the losses\noccur, their impact, and suggest possible opportunities for design improvement. Starting\nwith the simplest Technology Demonstration Convertor (TDC) Stirling model, the energy\nflows and losses are shown at each step. In one of the steps, sub-cases were developed to\ninvestigate the sensitivity of the model to certain parameters. These sub-cases are helpful in\nclarifying the characteristics of the specific model and contribute to the accuracy of the\nsimulation results. Finally, the model predictions were compared with TDC data, and then\ncalibration parameters were adjusted to improve agreement with the data.\n\nNomenclature\nBS\nC\nCS\nCW\nES\nExp.Data\nH\nHW\nInd.

The computer\nsimulation of the Stirling convertor is an important part of this development effort. The simulation is used to\npredict convertor performance of the thermodynamic cycle. Today, Stirling engine and cooler designers, such as\nINFINIA Corp. (formerly Stirling Technology Company (STC)), and Sunpower, use Sage simulation software to\nmodel and design Stirling devices. Sage is a one-dimensional (1-D) steady-periodic Stirling cycle design and\nsimulation program developed by Gedeon Associates of Athens, Ohio.1 This report explains how Sage was used to\nconstruct a Stirling convertor model via a step-by-step development process, shows some sensitivity study results\nfor the model, and compares predictions of the model with engine data.\nStirling engine research at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) started with the kinematic automotive Stirling\nengine development project to achieve higher automotive engine efficiency.2 In the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, research and\ndevelopment of free-piston Stirling convertors (engine plus linear alternator) as the power source for space missions\nstarted, because the Stirling convertor is highly efficient which leads to low-mass systems. As a part of the effort,\nStirling computational models were developed to predict convertor performance and aid in their design.\nModeling of the Stirling cycle by NASA GRC began in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s.3-4 Later, two 1-D Stirling design codes,\nGLIMPS and HFAST were used to compare engine simulation results with experimental results.5 GLIMPS was a\npredecessor of the Sage 1-D Stirling simulation code developed by Gedeon Associates1. HFAST is a 1-D Stirling\ncycle simulation harmonic code written in FORTRAN, and developed by Mechanical Technology, Inc.6 Later the\nmodeling effort was extended to two-dimensional (2-D) simulation by Cleveland State University,7,8 and today there\nare ongoing multidimensional simulation efforts using commercial simulation codes.9-12. Ebiana and Pawar of\nCleveland State University developed a Sage free-piston model, with both power piston and displacer modeled as\nspring-mass-damper systems.13\nSage is the most widely used Stirling cycle analysis code however; a step-by-step method of constructing such a\nmodel has not been described in the open literature. This paper describes one step-by-step procedure for modeling\nthe Technology Demonstration Convertor (TDC), which was designed and manufactured by INFINIA Corp and is\nbeing tested at NASA GRC.\nThe evolution of this particular Stirling engine model is explained through increasingly complex cases while\ntracking the power produced, heat flow, losses, and energy balance. This method starts from a simple model, and\neach step adds component(s) that make the model more realistic, and complex. This technique shows the impact of\nthe evolution of the model on its predictions through a number of stages.\nSage software represents each part of the Stirling device visually by component, in a window that shows\nconnections between model components. Components of the model are connected by several types of connectors,\nsuch as heat flow, mass flow, etc. In this study, the operating conditions were kept the same for all major cases.\nHowever, some sub-cases were run by changing certain engine parameters in order to study their effect on the\nStirling cycle.\nThe energy flows are shown in each step as the engine model evolves, to show the changes in power produced,\nheat flow and in energy losses. Energy balances were carefully checked for each case.\n\nII.\n\nTechnology Demonstration Convertor Description\n\nA Stirling convertor manufactured by INFINIA Corp. was simulated, as shown in Fig. 1. The TDC is a gammatype free-piston Stirling convertor. The peak electric power output is about 55 to 64 We depending on the operating\ncondition. Heat is input at the heater head at temperatures up to 650\xcb\x9aC. The power piston and displacer are\nsupported by flexures. This system consists of two major areas: the working space in the heater head and the\nbounce space in the pressure vessel. The main thermal energy exchange happens in the working space, as the\ndisplacer drives oscillating-flow through the heat exchangers in series (heater, regenerator, and cooler). In the\npressure vessel, a power piston oscillates, resulting in changes in volume of the compression space and oscillatingpressure in the working fluid (helium). A linear alternator is attached to the power piston to convert the oscillating\nmotion to electric power, which appears as damping on the power piston. The Sage simulations described in this\npaper concentrated on the working space, using an assumed alternator efficiency of 82% to convert the cycle power\ninto electric power.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBounce Space\nPressure Vessel Area\n\nLinear Alternator\n\nWorking\nSpace Heater\nHead Area\n\nPower Piston\n\nCompression\nSpace\nExpansion\nSpace (ES)\n\nDisplacer\n\nHeater (H)\nRegenerator (R)\nCooler (C)\nBounce Space\nFigure 0.

Form of energy flow diagrams used for Sage TDC model cases.\n\nC. Case 1 (Base Model)\nThe first case starts with the most simple structure for the Sage TDC model. This model contains the basic\ncomponents for a Stirling cycle working space; constrained power piston, constrained displacer, heat exchangers\n(heater, regenerator, and cooler), expansion and compression spaces. The Sage model elements were selected, and\nconnected, to represent these components as shown in Fig. 3a. The Sage model was run (solved), and an output\nlisting which defines the power and heat flows was generated. From this Sage output listing for the Case 1 model,\nthe energy flows shown in Fig. 3b were taken. The energy flow quantities shown in Fig. 3b can be defined by\nreference to the energy flow names shown in Fig. 2. These results from the simple model (Fig. 3b) show the very\nbasic energy and heat flows without some of the heat conduction and other losses included.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 3a.

This is also\nsummarized in Table I. Tables of this form will also be used to compare results for the various cases. Fig. 3b also\nshows fluid enthalpy flows between the fluid components.\nD. Case 2 (Adds displacer shell & cylinder liner conduction losses)\nIn Case 2, the conduction through the displacer cylinder liner and displacer shell was added as shown in Fig. 4a.\nThese were added via Sage \xe2\x80\x9cbar conductor\xe2\x80\x9d elements. Sage Case 2 model numerical results are shown in the\nenergy-flow diagram of Fig. 4b. By comparison with the energy flow analysis of Case 1, the impact of the new heat\nconduction loss is easily found. The difference in pressure phase angle between the experimental data and\nsimulation result is 5.89\xcb\x9a, with the simulation indicating a greater phase angle.\n\n(displacer shell)\n(displacer)\n\nFigure 4a.

The\nheat conduction losses essentially added to the heat in required and the heat out, and should have little to no effect\non power. This is because the temperatures were fixed in these simulations; the conduction loss should have no\nimpact on the thermodynamic cycle. It is believed that the slight difference in the Total PV Power was caused by\nthe slightly different paths that Sage took to get to the two solutions. The PV Efficiency was reduced because the\nHeat In was increased by the heat conduction losses. The PV efficiency decreased by more than 3 percentage\npoints, primarily due to the added heat conduction loss. The difference in pressure phase angle between the\nexperimental data and the Case 2 simulation result was 5.83\xcb\x9a, with the pressure phase angle from the simulation\nresults being larger.\nE. Case 3 (Addition of bounce space and power-piston seal)\nCase 3 involved the addition of the bounce space (variable volume surrounding the alternator in Fig. 1) and the\npower piston seal. Fig. 5a shows the model component interconnections with the addition of the bounce space and\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\npower piston seal into the Sage model of Case 2. The power piston seal was added within the constrained piston\nmodel component. By this addition, piston seal loss, piston shuttle loss, and heat loss from the bounce space were\nincorporated into the energy balance. Sage predictions for Case 3 are summarized in the energy-flow diagram of\nFig. 5b.\n\nFigure 5a.

Table III shows that the addition of the\nbounce space and the power piston seal resulted in increases in heat in and heat out, and a decrease in Total PV\nPower, all approximately 1 W. A PV Efficiency reduction of about 0.5 percentage points resulted. The pressure\nphase angle was reduced by 0.3\xcb\x9a from Case 2 to Case 3.

The\ntemperature distribution was assumed to be linear along the axial length of the appendix gap. Sage predictions for\nCase 4 are summarized in the energy-flow diagram of Fig. 6b.

The pressure phase angle was reduced by 0.45\xcb\x9a from\nCase 3 to Case 4. This can be attributed to some of the working fluid leaking past the displacer and not going\nthrough the heat exchangers since the heating and cooling of the working fluid is the largest source of the pressure\nphase angle. As an example, if there were no heating and cooling of the working fluid, the working space volume\nwould essentially be a gas spring with nearly no phase angle at all. The difference in pressure phase angle between\nthe experimental data and simulation result decreased to 5.0\xcb\x9a with the simulation pressure phase angle still being\nlarger.\nG. Case 5 (Addition of displacer-rod seal and the volume inside the displacer)\nIn Case 5, the displacer rod seal and the variable volume inside of the displacer were added. These additions\nwere accomplished by adding the volume (generic cylinder) and the displacer rod (constrained piston and cylinder\nelement) to the Sage model as shown in Fig. 7a. It can be determined via the numbers on the mass-flow connectors\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(m\n\n) that the displacer rod seal connects the compression space to the volume inside of the displacer.

The pressure\nphase angle had no change from Case 4 to 5. The pressure phase angle difference between the experimental data\nand simulation results remained unchanged at 5.0\xcb\x9a. This indicates that the seal between the working space and the\nvolume inside of the displacer allows no significant leakage. The pressure amplitude was not reduced nor was the\npressure phase angle reduced, resulting in the same Total PV Power as when there was no leak path being modeled.\n\nH. Case 6 (Change from constrained to \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d displacer)\nAn investigation undertaken in this step-by-step model development was to change the displacer operation from\nconstrained mode to \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d or unconstrained motion. This would show the response of the displacer (motion) to the\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\npressure wave as calculated by Sage, which could then be compared to the data. The free-displacer movement is\ndetermined by the displacer mass, the displacer spring rate, and the damping that it experiences, when the pressure\nforces act on it. In the constrained mode, the displacer movement is specified by a set amplitude and phase angle\nrelative to the power piston. While the displacer mass and the spring rate of the flexure can be measured directly,\nthe damping that it experiences is complex, being based primarily on the oscillating flow losses in the heat\nexchangers and manifolds, and to some lesser extent, on the other displacer losses such as leakage. It was felt that\nthis study could provide some insight into Sage\xe2\x80\x99s ability to model the losses acting on the displacer. Also, since the\nsize of the displacer rod of the TDC being modeled was accurately known, the power supplied to drive the displacer\nwas also known. This could be compared to the analytical predictions. The input parameters necessary for\ndefinition of the free-displacer model were mass, spring rate, and damping coefficient of the displacer.\n\nFigure 8a. Sage diagram showing interconnection of Sage\nCase 6 TDC model components.\n\nThe spring rate and damping coefficient had to be defined to complete the Case 6 free-displacer TDC model.\nFirst, a spring constant was obtained experimentally by the INFINIA Corp. and was used as a starting point. The\nSage mapping function was then used to select a final set of constants. The mapping function was used to obtain a\nsequence of solutions over a specified range of input variables. In this case, mapping was used to explore\ncombinations of spring rates and damping to best fit the Sage simulation results with the experimental data.\nTherefore, for this case, the experimental data measured displacer amplitude and phase angle were not used as inputs\nto the model, rather, they were part of the output that was being studied. The simulation results were compared with\nexperimental data based on the following output parameters: Electrical Output Power (PV Power times the assumed\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nalternator efficiency), Overall Efficiency, Pressure Phase Angle, Pressure Amplitude, and Displacer Amplitude.\nBest overall agreement was obtained when Sage indicated a spring rate some 13% greater than the measured value.\nThis discrepancy could be a result of uncertainty in the non-linear element of the experimental spring rate equation.\nThe corresponding damping coefficient was 2.550E-2 (N\xc2\xb7s)/m. The selection of the combination of spring constant\nand damping coefficient was based on overall agreement with the experimental data with special attention having\nbeen paid to the pressure phase angle. As a result of this initial study, there will be some future effort to try to\nfurther compare the modeled displacer dynamics to the measured experimental data results..\n177.8\n\n112.5\n11.76\n\n135.8\n148.3\n\n85.44\n\n72.80\n\n13.38\n\n13.38\n\n72.06\n\n13.38\n\n135.8\n\n134.9\n3.207\n\n0.1712\n\n-72.80\n\n0.9086\n12.10\n0.009577\n0.1807\n0.005934\n\nPVPwr(exp ) =\n135.8 W\nPVPwr(cmp ) =\n-72.80 W\nPVPwr(bounce ) = -0.1712 W\nTotalPVPwr\n= 62.83 W\nCooler Heat Out =\n112.5 W\nHeater Heat In =\n177.8 W\nPV or Ind.

The change from the constrained to the free-displacer\nmodel, and the adjustment of spring rate and damping to match TDC data caused overall Total PV Power to\ndecrease. The primary reason for the decrease in Total PV Power came from a decrease in displacer amplitude,\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwhich means that a different Stirling cycle is now being modeled than had been modeled in Cases 1 through 5. The\ndisplacer amplitude in the Sage free-displacer model was determined by parametrically altering the spring rate and\ndamping coefficient, with the selected combination of these constants resulting in the displacer amplitude being\n14.4% less than the measured amplitude and the phase angle being different than in the data. The pressure phase\nangle was reduced by 0.13\xcb\x9a relative to Case 5. Compared with the TDC data, Case 6 Total PV Power was high by\n0.88 W (1.4 W) and PV Efficiency was high by 1.79 percentage points, which were the primary drivers for\ndetermining the spring rate and the damping. As stated earlier, this study will continue in the future.\n\n80\n70\n60\n50\nPV Power, W\n40\nPV Efficiency, %\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nExperimental Data\n\nSage Simulation Cases\n\nFigure 9.

The\ndecrease of the power output was caused by the increase of losses implemented in the model. The PV Efficiency\nalso decreased as the model construction progressed.\n\nIV.\n\nSensitivity Check\n\nInitial comparisons with experimental test data suggested that some adjustments to calibration parameters\nprovided by Sage might be valuable for code validation purposes. Therefore a sensitivity study was conducted for\nthe Sage calibration parameters. Also, sensitivities to parameters that may have some significant uncertainty were\nchecked. The sensitivity of the TDC model performance to heater and cooler heat transfer coefficient multipliers\nand regenerator friction-factor multiplier was checked. Sensitivities of model to regenerator porosity and displacer\nappendix gap was also checked. For these sensitivity checks, the more simple Stirling model of Case 2 was used.\nA. Heater / Cooler Heat Transfer Multiplier (Hmult)\nThe heat transfer multipliers in Sage are empirical parameters which can be used to adjust the heat-exchanger\nheat-transfer correlations for code calibration purposes. These parameters, named Hmult might be expected to be\n15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nless than 1.0, due to fin effectiveness of the heater and cooler fins. An Hmult of zero would imply no heat transfer\nbetween the solid heat exchanger and the working fluid. Hmult of 1.0 indicates a fin effectiveness of 1.0, and values\ngreater than 1.0 might be expected if the correlations within Sage were in error. Hmult was exercised over a wider\nrange of values than might be expected in a high performance Stirling design to see the impact.\n250\n\n250\n\n200\n\n200\nElectrical Power, W\n\n150\n\n150\n\nHeat In, W\n\nElectrical Power, W\nHeat In, W\nCS Pressure Amplitude, kPa\n\nCS Pressure Amplitude, kPa\nOverall Efficiency, %\n\n100\n\nOverall Efficiency, %\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nH t H tT\nf M lti li\nFigure 10.

Electrical Power, Heat In, CS Pressure\nAmplitude, and Overall Efficiency as a functions of\ncooler heat transfer multiplier.\n\nFigures 10 and 11 show a summary of the results as the multipliers were varied for the heater and the cooler\nrespectively. The heat transfer multipliers of the heater and the cooler affect the performance most at values less\nthan 1.0. At values greater than 1.0, the effect on the performance reaches a plateau, indicating that near isothermal\nperformance of the heat exchangers has been achieved. However, reduction in Hmult below 1.0, even to values as\nsmall as 0.5 showed little effect on performance. Substantial reductions in Hmult, to values less than 0.25 were\nrequired before performance dropped noticeably.\nB. Regenerator Friction-Factor Multiplier (Fmult)\nThe regenerator friction factor multiplier, Fmult, is a dimensionless, empirical multiplier for viscous pressure\ndrop. Fig. 12 shows a decrease in electrical power as Fmult was increased. The decrease of electrical power is\nreasonable due to dissipation in the increased viscous losses. The pressure phase angle (not shown in Fig. 12) was\nnot reduced as rapidly as the electrical power. It is worth noting that the pressure amplitude increased as the friction\nmultiplier was increased. This seems reasonable since the power piston could \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d a greatly increased regenerator\nflow resistance as having a similar effect as a decrease in working space volume. Since the Case 2 model was a\nconstrained mode model, the piston and displacer amplitudes were fixed for these sensitivity studies.\nThe friction factor multiplier could also be investigated in the study of a free displacer. Since the flow loss\nthrough the heat exchangers is the major source of damping on the displacer, a value of Fmult should be able to be\ndetermined through Sage that results in the correct displacer dynamics, as measured in the experimental test data.\nFor a given design, this could provide an indication if Sage under-predicts or over-predicts flow losses. Studying\nthe dynamics could be more telling than the PV power produced since the power dissipated through flow losses is\nsmall compared to the Total PV Power generated, yet slight changes in the flow losses will have a pronounced effect\non the dynamics of the displacer.\n\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nElectric Power, W\n\n350\n\n300\n\nHeat In, W\nCS Pressure Amplitude, kPa\n\n300\n\n250\n\nOverall Efficiency, %\n\n250\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\nElectrical Power, W\nHeat In, W\nPressure Amplitude, kPa\nOverall Efficiency, %\n\n100\n\n150\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n0\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n-50\n\n10.0\n\n0\n0.70\n-50\n\n0.75\n\n0.80\n\n0.85\n\n0.90\n\n0.95\n\n-100\nRegenerator Flow Friction Multiplier\n\nFigure 12.

Electrical Power, Heat In, CS Pressure\nAmplitude, and Overall Efficiency as a function of\nregenerator porosity.\n\nC. Regenerator Porosity\nFig. 13 shows the performance change as the regenerator porosity was varied. This was studied since there\ncould be some error in measuring regenerator porosity, and with the nature of random fiber regenerators there could\nbe some variability in the regenerator performance as a function of porosity. It was found that the cycle does not\nproduce positive power output with the regenerator porosity less than 75%, and as the porosity was increased up to\n95%, Electrical Power Output increased. The pressure phase angle (not shown in Fig. 13) increased slightly as the\nporosity increased, and the pressure amplitude was found to decrease. The Electric Power Output and Overall\nEfficiency reached a peak around 91% porosity, and then show little change up to 95% porosity. Compression\nspace pressure amplitude and heat input both showed more sensitivity to porosity in the 90 to 95% range, than the\npower and efficiency.\n\nD. Displacer Appendix Gap\nThe performance change due to the variation in the displacer appendix gap was investigated. As anticipated,\nincreasing the size of the gap decreased the cycle efficiency, as shown in Fig. 14. This is due to increased thermal\nlosses from the hot end to the cold end without useful thermodynamic work having been performed in the cycle by\nsome of the working fluid. This results in increased heat input being required and decreased power output.\n\n17\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n250\n\n200\n\nElectrical Power, W\n\n150\n\nHeat In, W\nCS Pressure Amplitude, kPa\n100\n\nOverall Efficiency, %\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n0.0002\n\n0.0004\n\n0.0006\n\n0.0008\n\n0.001\n\n0.0012\n\nAppendix Gap m\n\nFigure 14.

Improved agreement was found\nwith values of 0.5 for both the heater and cooler, suggesting the possibility that fin effectiveness may be about 0.5.\nSimulation 2 results, shown in Table VII, were all greater than the experimental data: for electric power output the\n18\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ndifference was 5.93 W (11.6%), CS pressure amplitude 0.029 MPa (16.1%), pressure phase angle difference was\n4.6\xcb\x9a, and net efficiency 1.3 percentage points (4.7%). These differences with the experimental data are smaller than\nfor Simulation 1.\nFor Simulation 3, improved agreement was found with Hmult for the heater and cooler remaining at 0.5, and\nregenerator Fmult changed to 1.4. The Simulation 3 results, shown in Table VII, were again greater than the\nmeasured values, but by reduced amounts. All were greater than the measured experimental data, with the exception\nof net efficiency which was smaller than the measured value. The differences were: electric power output difference\nwas 1.8 W (3.6 %), CS pressure amplitude 0.031 MPa (17.2%), pressure phase angle difference was 4.2\xcb\x9a, and net\nefficiency -0.4 percentage points (-1.45%). The difference from the experimental data was smallest with this\nsimulation result, and overall agreement of predicted and measured power and efficiency was good however,\nagreement of the predicted pressure amplitude and pressure phase angle with the measured experimental data values\nwas not felt to be satisfactory. Although the end-result power and efficiency were in good agreement with the\nmeasured test data, it was apparent that there were compensating errors is some parameters used to calculate overall\nperformance.\nFor future improvement of the model, a change in the radial gap between the power piston and the cylinder will\nbe investigated. All of the clearance seals were modeled with the nominal component diameter centered in the\nnominal bore, with equal radial clearance seal gap around the leak path. The components should be modeled with\nsome eccentricity, as would be expected in assembled hardware. Also, there could be some enhanced leakage or\npumping effect as the piston may not operate with constant eccentricity over the entire cycle. A preliminary\ninvestigation has been conducted and the difference in the radial gap did affect the pressure phase angle.\n\nVI.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nA Sage TDC model was developed using a step-by-step method. The changes in energy flow due to various\nchanges in the model were documented. Sensitivities of the TDC model performance to calibration factors and to\nother parameters that may have some uncertainty were checked. Calibration of the constrained piston and displacer\nmodel with heater and cooler heat transfer, and regenerator friction-factor calibration factors yielded reasonable\nagreement with the overall engine data: predicted electric power was high by 1.8 W (3.6 %); predicted heat input\nwas high by 9.6 W (5.2 %); this resulted in a predicted net efficiency that was low by 0.4 percentage points (-1.6%).\nWhile these gross results of electric power output and efficiency are in good agreement with experimental data, it is\nrecognized that they result with pressure amplitude and pressure phase angle not in good agreement with the data. It\ntherefore appears that there are compensating errors within the present model that allow it to generate the reasonably\ncorrect gross values. Several possible solutions are being explored to produce improved agreement with the test\ndata by determining the correct values of the calibration factors and more accurately modeling the hardware as it\nexists during operation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work described in this paper was performed for the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the\nRadioisotope Power System (RPS) Program, which provided funding for this project.
