The Smart\nCurrent Signature Sensor and software were designed and developed to be utilized on any application\nusing solenoid valves. The system monitors the electrical and mechanical health of solenoids by\ncomparing the electrical current profile of each solenoid actuation to a typical current profile and reporting\ndeviation from its learned behavior. The objective of this partnership with Graftel is for them to develop\nthe technology into a hand-held testing device for their customer base in the Nuclear Power Industry.\nThe device will be used to perform diagnostic testing on electromechanical valves used in Nuclear Power\nplants. Initially, Graftel plans to have working units within the first year of license in order to show\ncustomers and allow them to put purchase requests into their next year's budget.\nThe subject technology under discussion was commercialized by the Kennedy Space Center Technology\nPrograms and Partnerships Office, which patented the technology and licensed it to Graftel , Inc. , a\ncompany providing support, instrumentation, and calibration services to the nuclear community and\nprivate sector for over 10 years. For the nuclear power industry, Graftel designs, manufacturers, and\ncalibrates a full line of testing instrumentation. Grafters smart sensors have been in use in the United\nStates since 1993 and have proved to decrease set-up time and test durations. The project was funded\nby Non-Destructive Engineering , and it is felt that this technology will have more emphasis on future\nvehicles.\nGraftel plans to market the Cu rrent Signature Sensor to the Electric Utility industry. Graftel currently\nsupplies product and services to the Nuclear Power Industry in the United States as well as\ninternationally. Product and services sold are used in non-destructive testing for valves, penetrations and\nother applications. Graftel also supplies testing services to an industrial customer base. The customer\nbase includes 90 percent of the U.S. Nuclear plants and plants in Brazil , Europe, and Asia. Graftel works\ninternationally with two representative groups and employees and has ten people at the principle location\nand a group of contract engineers around the country.\nThe benefits of the Smart Current Signature Sensor are several. One of the main benefits provided by the\nsystem is the ability to detect potential failures and operational degradation of solenoid valves that will\ncause failures in the near future and notify the users before they happen (valve health prognosis) . Such\ncapability greatly increases the safety, the reliability and the availability of the systems being instrumented\nwith this device. Additionally, this approach will provide cost savings associated with failure\nconsequences such as launch scrubs, etc. The Smart Current Signature Sensor was designed and\ndeveloped to be utilized by the Space program on its ground support equipment and vehicle valves.\nBecause of the uniqueness of the application , the sensor was designed with such flexibility that it could\nbe utilized on any application using solenoid valves. An important advantage is that the system learns\nfrom good solenoid valves and reports deviation from its learned behavior; therefore, it is suitable for any\naerospace application . Two additional major benefits of the software are the automatic identification of\nthe features using a very small sample of the current signature and enhancements to the difference filter\nthat provide a method to control the amount of noise rejection .\n\nNASA Point of Contact:\n\nCommerical Point of Contact:\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/\nJim Nichols\nLicensing Manager\nInnovative Partnerships Program\nMail Code - KT-A2\nKennedy Space Center, FL 32899\nTelephone: 321 -867-6384\nE-mail : james.d.n ichols@nasa.gov\n\nJames Glover\nPresident\nGraftel, Incorporated\n870 Cambridge Drive\nElk Grove Village, IL 60007\nTelephone: 837-364-2600\nE-mail: jgkl@well.com\n\nSmart Current Signature Sensor (SCSS) Analog and Digital Modules\n\nSide Bar on NASA's Innovative Partnerships Program\nTechnology transfer has been a mandate for NASA since the Agency was established in 1958 by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act. National leaders at that time recognized that NASA would play an\nimportant role in driving technology development to achieve its goals in space and aeronautics, and that\nthose technologies could provide important benefits for the Nation . The Act requires that NASA provide\nthe widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of its activities and results, and granted NASA the\nauthority to patent inventions to which it has title. Under the terms of this Act, NASA retains title to all\nNASA inventions and intellectual property created using government funds , unless specifically waivered\nby the NASA Administrator.\nSince 1980, Congress has enacted a series of laws to promote technology transfer and allow commercial\nuse of government-funded inventions. These laws encourage the sharing of technology and resources\nbetween federal laboratories and private industry, including personnel , facilities, methods, expertise, and\ntechnical information in general. NASA's Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides needed\ntechnology and capabilities for NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), and ESMD\nPrograms and Projects, through investments and partnerships with Industry, Academia, Government\nAgencies, and National Laboratories. As one of NASA's Mission Support Offices, IPP supports all four\nMission Directorates and has Program Offices at each of the NASA Centers. In addition to leveraged\ntechnology investments, dual-use technology-related partnerships, and technology solutions for NASA,\nIPP enables cost avoidance, and accelerates technology maturation .\nIPP consists of the following program elements, as summarized: Technology Infusion , which includes the\nSmall Business Innovative Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STIR) Programs and\nthe IPP Seed Fund ; Innovative Incubator, which includes Centennial Challenges, and new efforts such as\nfacilitating the purchase of services from the emerging commercial space sector and Partnership\nDevelopment, which includes Intellectual Property management and Technology Transfer, and new\ninnovative partnerships. Together these program elements increase NASA's connection to emerging\ntechnologies in external communities, enable targeted positioning of NASA's technology portfolio in\nselected areas, and secure NASA's intellectual property to provide fair access and to support NASA's\nstrategic goals. Technology transfer through dual-use partnerships and licensing also creates many\nimportant social-economic benefits within the broader community.\n\n"
