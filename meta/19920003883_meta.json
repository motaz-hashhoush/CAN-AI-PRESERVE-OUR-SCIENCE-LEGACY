Its purposes are to observe cataclysmic events such as hurricanes, typhoons, and regional weather phenomena; to relay meteorological data from surface collection points to the Data Processing Center in Japan; and to transmit processing imaging data for facsimile reproduction. The satellite will be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center (TaSC) in Japan by a type H-II launch vehicle. The Deep Space Network (DSN) will support the transfer and drift orbit mission phases. The coverage will consist of the 26-m antennas as prime and the 34-m antenna at Madrid as backup support for launch through drift orbit. Maximum support will consist of two 8-hour tracks per station for a seven day period, plus 23 days of contingency support from all complexes. Information is given in tabular form for DSN support, frequency assignments, telemetry, command and tracking station responsibility.", "title": "Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5)", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920003883, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Horii, M."}, "organization": {"name": "National Space Development Agency", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "id": "40967a5aaf2844249dd7594d4822758b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920003883, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920003883, "id": "ea418a3dbe834f4ebc8b2eedaf1c3304", "publicationName": "JPL, California Inst. of Tech., Deep Space Network: Mission Support Requirements", "publicationDate": "1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920003883.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920003883/downloads/19920003883.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920003883/downloads/19920003883.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920003883/downloads/19920003883.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
