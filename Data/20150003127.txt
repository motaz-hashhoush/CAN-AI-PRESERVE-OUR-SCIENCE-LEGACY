FIG. 1\nsummarizes the quantum efficiency of some conventional.\nUV detectors.\nIn the first category, an immense investment has been made\nin silicon visible imagers in order to produce detectors with\nvery low noise, low dark current, and very large formats (e.g.,\nlarger than 4 k\xe2\x80\xa24 kpixels). In addition, new techniques such as\nlateral gain CCDs and low noise CMOS sensors are being\ndeveloped so that silicon sensors continue to improve and\nbecome viable for photon counting applications. It is of\ncourse possible to use silicon sensors directly as a UV detector. The problem is that silicon sensors are almost never solar\nblind, a feature that is required for use in most interplanetary\napplications. In fact, the UV sensitivity must be incorporated\nas an "add-on" since conventional devices usually begin to\ncut off for wavelengths shorter than about 400 mu. The UV\nresponse is therefore almost always worse than the visible.\nWhile it is possible to make a camera system solar blind by\nusing optical. filtering, the UV/visible rejection ratio desired\nby most planetary applications places enormous burdens on\nthe filler designer. The less than unity UV/visible responseratio of silicon sensors makes a challenging job even more\ndifficult.\nNew materials such as gallium nitride (GaN), silicon carbide, and even diamond are being formed into detector arrays.\nUsually an array of diodes is made and is hybridized to a\nCMOS readout. Additionally, monolithic imagers with transistors made from the host or substrate material. exist at least\nin concept. These materials offer the promise of direct solarblind UV imagers and research into their development is\nimportant. However, realistically, it will be more than a\ndecade before monolithic imagers (not photocathodes) in\nthese new materials can provide performance equivalent to\nsilicon imagers.\n\nThe available detector chosen for most imaging applications has been a microchannel plate (MCP)-based imager.\nMCP-based detectors use a solar-blind photocathode that\nabsorbs photons (UV, visible or near-IR) and ejects the pho5 toelectrons into the vacuum. The free electrons are then collected by an MCP that is made from an array of tubes that are\non the order of ten micrometers in diameter. Electrons entering these tubes are accelerated by high fields and they free\nelectrons from the tube walls in each collision, creating an\nio electron multiplier effect. The MCP provides electron signal.\ngain while the tube structure confines the electrons and preserves the spatial. information. Electron bursts generated by\nthe MCP are read out by various schemes such as multi-anode\narrays. Another scheme for readout consists of a phosphor for\n15 conversion of electrons to photons and a silicon imager (CCD\nor CMOS) sometimes coupled through fiber optic faceplates.\nThe latter readout scheme is often referred to as an image\nintensifier.\nWhile MCP-based imagers have been used successfully,\n20 they have significant drawbacks, such as low QE, limited\nresolution, small format size, limited number of pixels, high\nvoltage requirements, and difficulty of fabrication in sealedtube configuration. The QE in practice is \xe2\x80\x9410% for wavelengths longer than 150 mu. Attempts to incorporate opaque\n25 near UV photocathodes on MCPs have faded. Resolution\nappears to be limited to 25-40 microns by fundamental.\ncharge cloud variance in MCPs that cannot be predicted a\npriori. Also, format size cannot exceed 60 mm without great\ncost and difficulty, especially in sealed tubes. There are also\n30 practical. difficulties that can make their inclusion in lowcost, short-duration flight development programs problematic (in particular, the acquisition of quality MCPs, especially\nin the larger formats, and the yield of sealed tube fabrication\ncycles). High voltage stability and arcing is a chronic con35 cern, especially with proximity-focused photocathodes.\nWhile large-format sealed tube MCP detectors have been\nmade (e.g., 65 mm diameter for GALEX), their fabrication is\nextraordinarily challenging and not readily duplicated.\nElectron Bombarded CCDs (EBCCDs) were developed to\n40 overcome the limitations of MCPs. They eliminate the MCP\nand instead accelerate the photoelectrons from the photocathode directly into the back surface of a CCD. In a typical.\nEBCCD, photoelectrons are accelerated by \xe2\x80\x9410-20 keV and a\npermanent magnet is used to bend the electrons away from the\n45 light path and into the back-illuminated CCD anode (see FIG.\n2). Energetic photoelectrons penetrate the surface electrode\nof the back-illuminated CCD and enter the low-doped sensitive region, where each incident photoelectron liberates many\nsignal. electrons. Since the input-referred noise floor of a\n50 moderate-speed CCD is on the order of 5 to 25 electrons,\nmodest multiplication is required in order to allow the\nEBCCD to be single-photon counting at near UV wavelengths. Moreover, because silicon detectors are sensitive to\nbackground radiation at visible and near infrared wave55 lengths, a magnetic or electrostatic field is used to bend the\nphotoelectrons around a light shield so that there is no direct\nline-of-sight between the photocathode and CCD.

In particular, the current invention introduces Delta-doped Electron\nBombarded Arrays (DDEBAs), a novel. class ofphotodetectors that will reduce the size, mass, power, complexity, and\ncost of conventional imaging systems while improving performance by using a thinned imager that is capable of detecting low-energy electrons, has gain and is of low noise.\nIn general. terms, a low light level photodetector can be a\nmonolithic semiconductor structure (such as a semiconductor\navalanche detector with integrated absorption and gain\nregions), or a composite photodetector comprised of discrete\nparts that perform the following functions: a photocathode\nthat converts light to electrons, a gain mechanism to amplify\nthe signal., and an electron sensor. A conventional. implementation of the composite photodetector uses a photocathode (either as a standalone component or deposited on a\nmicrochannel plate that, together with a high voltage source,\nconverts light to electrons and provides electron multiplication to achieve the necessary conversion and gain functions).\nWhen a microchannel plate is used, the photodetector is\nreferred to an MCP detector (or an MCP-based detector). In\nthe case of the MCP detector, amplification (or gain) is\nobtained by providing the interior surfaces of the glass tubes\nconstituting the MCP with a high electron yield surface. Each\nincoming electron ricochets on a tube interior surface many\ntimes, producing as many as 300 additional. electrons for\neach incoming electron. Whereas it is desirable to eliminate\nthe micro-channel. plate from the composite photodetector,\nsuch elimination requires an alternate method of providing\ngain. Electron-bombarded CCDs are conventional detectors\nthat have eliminated the microchannel plate (MCP). In a\nconventional. EBCCD, the necessary gain is provided by\naccelerating electrons from the photocathode with high voltage and taking advantage of the conversion gain due to quantum yield in the semiconductor material.\nAs shown in FIG. 2, the electron sensor in such a composite\nphotodetector can be an electron-bombarded charge coupled\ndevice (EBCCD) or an electron-bombarded CMOS active\npixel. sensor (EBAPS) imaging detector. The photocathode\nand the electron sensor generally are mutually facing planar\ndevices separated by a vacuum gap across which a large (e.g.,\n10 kV) electric field is imposed. As photons from a field of\nview strike the photocathode, electrons are emitted from the\nsurface of the photocathode facing the electron sensor. The\nemitted electrons are accelerated across the vacuum gap and\nstrike the electron sensor. The electron sensor amplifies the\nelectron current, providing the necessary gain by exploiting\n\nUS 8,558,234 B2\n7\nthe quantum yield of the semiconductor material. of the\nEBCCD or EBAPS detector array.\nConventional. EBCCD or EBAPS are insensitive to low\nenergy electrons, and therefore require high voltages to provide electrons with sufficiently high energy. Because of the\nhighvoltages required, this conventional. EBCCD or EBAPS\ndetector array requires a large separation (gap) between photocathode and electron detector, and the large gap necessitates\na magnetic field to maintain spatial. resolution, as shown in\nFIG. 2. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to reduce\nthe high voltage and also narrow the gap between photocathode and the imaging array to the point that proximity focusing\nis possible. This requirement dictates the use of a detector\ncapable of high efficiency detection of low energy electrons\nwith gain. There are four features required to making a compact, easy to fabricate, low cost, high efficiency photon counting imagers, namely,\n1) Eliminate the requirement for high voltage;\n2) Eliminate the need for microchannel plates;\n3) Eliminate the instability inherent in conventional. photocathodes; and\n4) Remove the need to use a magnet.\nThe inventive DDEBA detector technology takes advantage of the superior QE and resolution of conventional. EBCCDs and EBAPS (as compared to MCP-based photodetectors), while advancing the technology to overcome the\naforementioned shortcomings. An exemplary embodiment of\na DDEBA detector in accordance withthe current invention is\nshown schematically in FIG. 3. The DDEBA device (10) in\naccordance with the invention generally comprises a photocathode (12) to absorb the desired light and produce electrons, a CCD or CMOS imager array (14) that is thinned and\ndelta doped to detect low-energy electrons (15) produced in\nthe photocathode disposed across an accelerating field space\n(16) from the photocathode, and an electric field generator\ncapable of generating a low electric field (<kV) (18) across\nthe accelerating field space between the photocathode and the\nimager array.\nDuring operation of the DDEBA detector of the invention,\nlight at a desired wavelength is absorbed by the photocathode\n(12) and electrons are produced. The electrons produced by\nthe photocathode are then accelerated across the accelerating\nfield space (16) by the electric field (18), to the delta-doped\nimager array (14). Light outside the desired wavelengths (19)\nwill either be blocked or will be directly transmitted through\nthe photocathode (12) will be detected by the DDEBCCD/\nDDEBAPS array (16). The directly transmitted photons will\nproduce single electron-hole pairs in the DDEBA, while photoelectrons produced by the photocathode are accelerated by\nthe electric field to 1 keV, and will produce over 200 pairs\n(20). In high data rate operation then, the directly transmitted\nphotons represent noise, similar to but somewhat distinct\nfrom array read and dark noises. Applying a threshold to\ndiscriminate against background photons then allows the\nDDEBA to count the desired photons, thereby allowing flexible operation of the detector with no magnets. In addition, by\nkeeping the distance between the photocathode and imager\narray small it is possible to proximity focus said photodetector thereby further improving performance.\nAs will be discussed in greater detail. below, the key innovations to this device are the thinned, delta-doped imaging\narray that possesses internal gain combined with a high efficiency, semitransparent photocathode in a novel., compact,\nproximity-focused EB image intensified configuration. In\nparticular, the current invention is directed to an advanced\nDella-Doped Electron Beam Array (DDEBA) using high-\n\n8\ngain delta-doped arrays (CCD or CMOS) and high efficiency,\nstable, photocathodes with the following features:\nFirst, the detector uses delta-doping technology to modify\nthe band-structure of the thinned CCD or CMOS Active\n5 Pixel. Sensor (APS) arrays used in the device and incorporating them in the EB format with a photocathode to\nprovide the necessary low-energy electron detection\ncapability. The result is an order of magnitude reduction\nin the low-energy electron detection threshold, and a\n10\nsimultaneous reduction in the required operating voltage\nand power of EB arrays.\nSecond, the detector of the invention reduces the complexity and increases the stability and efficiency of the detec15 for by using a photocathode of an epitaxially-grown\nwide bandgap material. such as GaN and related alloys\nIII-N alloys, and in particular GaN and A1GaN films\nwith delta layers on sapphire or GaN substrates.

They are also radiation tolerant. III-N materials\nmake excellent photocathodes and can be coupled in an\nEB configuration with the mature and high performance\n25\ntechnology of silicon imagers. (See, e.g., R. Strittmatter,\net al., "Investigation of Della-Doped III-Nitride Photocathodes for Stable Electron Emitting Surfaces", Materials Research Society, III-N Workshop, Pittsburg, Pa.,\nJuly 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein\n30\nby reference.) However, although the specific advantages of III-N materials are described herein, it should be\nunderstood that other wide bandgap materials may be\nused depending on the spectral. range that the detector/\nimager in accordance with the invention is meant to\n35\ncover.\nThird, using the gain and low noise to threshold against the\nvisible or out of band photo-electrons and therefore\neliminate the requirement for the magnets.\nAccordingly, using the inventive DDEBA design, it is pos40 sible to produce a detector that is compact (no high voltage\npower supplies or bulky magnets), low power (CCD/CMOS\ntechnology), highly stable and robust (novel. III-nitride photocathode and delta doped arrays). In addition, with a tunable\nphotocathode, of the type proposed for use with the invention,\n45 it is possible to use the device to detect any spectrum of light\nfrom near-IR to UV.\nThe Photocathode\nAs described above, the current invention uses a class of\nhighly efficient photocathodes that do not require deposition\n50 an activating metal. such as Cesium, and are impervious to\nexposure to atmosphere and may therefore be manufactured\nin a relatively efficient and inexpensive manner.\nBackground\nThe performance of any photocathode is limited by the\n55 efficiency with which the photocathode emits electrons in\nresponse to incoming photons. The photocathode is generally\na planar semiconductor crystal. Each incident photon creates\na hole-electron pair in the semiconductor crystal. by elevating\nan electron from the valence band to the conduction band,\n60 leaving a hole in the valence band. Generally, a semiconductor material having a bandgap energy corresponding to the\ninfraredregion (such as GaAs) does not readily emit electrons\nfrom its surface when struck by photons, due to an energy\nbarrier that arises at the crystal. surface of the semiconductor.\n65 In order for surface emission to occur, the electron must\novercome both the work function of the surface and the band\ngap energy of the semiconductor. Conventionally, this prob-\n\nUS 8,558,234 B2\n9\nlem is overcome by "activating" the surface of the photocathode in such a manner that this energy barrier is overcome.\nStandard "activated" photocathode materials in the case of\nUV or IR photocathodes are group III semiconductor or\ngroup III-V compound semiconductors, with an "activation"\nthat consists of depositing a thin Cesium (Cs) coating on the\ncrystal. surface. In such a material., the Fermi levels in the Cs\nand semiconductor layers equilibrate at the interface between\nthe layers, forcing the valence and conduction band structures\nin the semiconductor layer to "bend" so much that the conduction band at the surface is below the Fermi level and the\nbulk conduction band bottom lies above the vacuum level at\nthe surface. This condition is favorable for electron emission\nfrom the photocathode surface because electrons excited in\nthe bulk can diffuse toward the surface where they can tunnel.\nor be ballistically emitted from the crystal. into the vacuum.\nThe problem with these materials is that the Cs coating step\ncan only be performed in a vacuum, because Cs is highly\nreactive with oxygen and therefore unstable in oxygen containing environments. The surface activation of the photocathode is therefore extremely difficult and expensive to perform, and the "cesiated" device is neither robust nor\npermanent. It is unstable and not long lasting, being subject to\nattack when exposed even slightly to oxygen atoms or molecules. On the other hand, Cesium coating of the GaAs surface provides highly desirable photocathode attributes, specifically (a) a high yield of photoelectrons when under\nillumination (because it has a short photon absorption length\nfor efficient photon absorption, a long electron diffusion\nlength to minimize photoelectron losses, and a small or negative electron affinity), and (b) high conductivity to avoid\ncharging due to electron loss by photoemission. It has seemed\nthat such desirable attributes could only be realized through\nthe expensive and impermanent Cesium coating step. The\nresult is that the photocathode is chemically unstable. What is\nneeded, therefore, is another way of activating the photocathode that realizes all of the foregoing desirable attributes (high\nyield and high conductivity) while at the same time providing\na structure that is highly stable and robust both chemically\nand physically (unlike these cesiated structures).\nFor example, one such material for near to mid UV detection (used in sealed tube configuration with MCPs) is Cs 2Te.\nThis material has exceptional. quantum efficiency with peak\nQE of above 50% at wavelengths between 165-190 mu in the\nopaque configuration. It is solar blind with a cut off wavelength around 265 mu depending on particular fabrication\nparameters. The conductivity of Cs 2Te, however, is extremely\nlow. To overcome this deficiency, Cs 2Te photocathodes must\nbe thin to allow charge flow from the conductive substrate to\nthe photocathode surface. This reduces the absorption efficiency of the photocathode, but as noted above, very high QE\nis still achieved with this material. The major drawback of this\nmaterial for use as a photocathode is its reactivity and consequent instability. Even short term exposure to atmosphere, <5\ns, results in degradation of the material performance to the\npoint of inutility. This severe difficulty necessitates stringent\nfabrication procedures. The current procedure for fabricating\nphotocathode imagers using Cs 2Te involves fabrication of the\nmaterial., installation of the photocathode into the imager,\nalignment, and window sealing all in vacuum. Because of thi s\nfabrication difficulty, if not for the lack of another material\nwith acceptable QE in the near UV, Cs 2Te would have been\nabandoned long ago.\nThe ideal photocathode material must: 1) produce a high\nyield of photoelectrons when under illumination (i.e., short\nphoton absorption length, long electron diffusion length, and\nsmall or negative electron affinity); 2) be conductive to avoid\n\n10\ncharging due to loss of electrons from photoemission; and 3)\nbe robust both chemically and physically. In addition, it\nwould be desirable to have a material. system that is activated\nfor photoelectron emission as mentioned above in which the\n5 photon absorption spectrum can be independently adjusted\nwithout compromising or sacrificing any of the foregoing\ndesired attributes. In particular, for some space applications it\nis important that the sensor be blind to visible light (e.g., from\nthe sun), and therefore it is useful. to be able to set the photon\n10\nabsorption spectrum of the detector to exclude certain wavelength regions while including desired ones.\nInventive Photocathode\nPhotocathodes for generating electrons in response to inci15 dent photons in the DDEBA detector in accordance with the\ninstant invention may take the form of one of either a Piezoelectrically-Enhanced Photocathode (PEPC) or a Deltadoped Enhanced Photocathode (DEPC). Both of these photocathode types take advantage of the near ideal. properties of\n20 wide bandgap semiconductor materials. For example, in\nembodiments of the invention designed to be operated in the\nUV spectral. range, III-nitride materials are nearly ideal. for\nphotocathode applications. In particular, it has been discovered that III-N materials, and the like, are physically and\n25 chemically robust, can be doped both n and p type, and have\ndemonstrated high quantum efficiencies as photocathodes,\nthereby removing many of the manufacturing and operational. constraints found with conventional. Cs doped photocathode materials.\n30\nStability of the Surface\nThe surfaces of III-N materials, such as GaN, have been\nfound to be extremely stable. (See, Bermudez, J. Appl. Phys.,\n80, 1190, (1996).) For example, the oxidation of GaN tenni35 nates after approximately one monolayer with no significant\nprogression of this oxidation until temperatures in excess of\n700\xc2\xb0 C. This stability reduces the stringent fabrication and\noperation requirements associated with Cs containing compounds especially in the near UV range.\n40\nLow Level of Surface States\nIII-N materials such as GaN surface have also been found\nto possess a low level of surface states. (See, P.M. Bridger, et\nal., Appl. Phys. Lett., 74,3522 (1999); and Schmitz A C, et al.,\nJ. Elec. Mat., 27: (4) 255-260 April 1998, the disclosures of\n45 each of which are incorporated herein by reference.) This\nallows for the modification of the surface barrier for electron\nemission by suitable modification of the semiconductor surface. Lowering the surface electron affinity significantly\nimproves the emission efficiency of photocathodes. This\n50 modification is typically achieved by deposition of a monolayer of Cs or CsO. The surface dipole created by this thin\nlayer of electropositive material. leads to significant band\nbending near the surface, resulting in negative electron affinity (NEA), where the bulk conduction band minimum lies\n55 above the vacuum level. Electrons excited within the bulk can\ndiffuse to the high field region near the surface where they can\ntunnel., or be ballistically emitted from the crystal.\nThe nitrides are excellent candidates for this type of surface\nenergy engineering given their already low electron affinities.\n60 P-type GaN has been shown to have near zero effective electron affinity, and sub-monolayer adsorption of Cs results in\nfurther reduction in its electron affinity, reaching \xe2\x80\x942.1 eV by\nthe completion of the first monolayer. (See, M. Eyckeler, et\nal., JUST B, 16 (4) 2224 1998, the disclosure of which is\n65 incorporated herein by reference.)

(See, Hoenk, M.\nE., et al., Proceeding SPIE, 741913-34, 2009, the disclosure of\nwhich is incorporated herein by reference.) Because the\ndetector is made in a standard CMOS process, all timing and\ncontrol. circuitry necessary for readout can be integrated onchip. In addition, application-specific signal-processing circuits can be integrated into the design to add customized\ndata-processing functions for particular applications.\nAnother advantage for scientific imaging is the low power\ndissipation of CMOS imaging arrays, typically in the range of\nmilliwatts or tens of milliwatts.\nAs with CCDs, light incident on CMOS APS arrays may be\nscattered or absorbed in the front surface structures that make\nup the array electronics. In addition, CMOS APS arrays suffer\nfrom an additional. loss of efficiency because the light-sensitive photodiodes occupy only part of the surface, the remainder of the surface being devoted to the transistors necessary\nfor detection, signal. processing, and readout. While it is\npossible to recover part of these losses using antireflection\ncoatings and lenses, back illumination offers far better performance for scientific CMOS imaging arrays, including\nhigher quantum efficiency, potentially 100% fill factor, and\nsensitivity in the ultraviolet.\nFrom a materials science standpoint, the back surfaces of\nthinned CCDs and CMOS imaging arrays are identical. The\ncommonalities of CMOS imaging arrays and CCDs are such\nthat the processes developed for delta-doping CCDs,\ndescribed above, apply equally well to CMOS devices.\nDespite the similarities, there are differences between the two\ndevice architectures relevant to the thinning and back illumination. One minor difference lies in the relative thicknesses of\nCCDs and CMOS arrays. The epilayer thickness in a standard\nCMOS process is only 5 microns in thickness, compared to\nthe 10-15 micron epilayer thickness of typical. CCDs. This\nmakes the thinning process slightly more difficult for CMOS\ndevices, the tolerances for thinning uniformity are tighter for\nthe thinner membranes. In addition, after thinning the depletion edge of the front surface structures reaches the back\nsurface in some areas of the device, so that prior to deltadoping, thinned CMOS arrays were found to be saturated\n\n16\nwith dark current at room temperature, and hence inoperable.\nDelta-doped, back-illuminated CMOS arrays did not exhibit\nany excess dark current, because the back surface defects are\nfully passivated by the delta-doping process. In addition, it\n5 should be noted that the more complicated pixel. structure of\nCMOS APS arrays leads to a requirement that these devices\nbe optimized for back illumination, in order that the three\ndimensional. electronic potential. in the pixels causes all of\nthe signal. charge to be collected at the sense nodes in the\nto array. Absent such optimization, some of the signal. charge\nmay not be detected, and the potential. with back illumination\nfor achieving 100% fill factor will not be realized.\nAlthough CMOS imagers are low power and their digital.\n15 interface makes them easy to integrate into systems, the noise\nperformance of most CMOS imagers is significantly inferior\nto CCDs. A low noise scientific CCD may have an input\nreferred noise of 2 to 4 electrons, compared with 10 to 50 for\nCMOS imagers. However, the physics of the electron bom20 bardment technique used in accordance with the DDEBAPS\ndetectors of the instant invention result in a gain with a subPoisson noise. That is, the noise is shot noise divided by a\nquantity known as the Fano factor. This multiplication is\nbefore and independent of the readout, so the readout noise is\n25 not multiplied by the gain factor. Typically with high-energy\nprocesses in silicon, one electron-hole pair is generated for\nevery 3.6 eV of incident energy. For an electron acceleration\nof 1 keV, each electron liberated from the photocathode will\ngenerate approximately 270 electron-hole pairs in the silicon.\n3o The signal. generated per incident photon would therefore be\nsignificantly greater than the read noise, and even if the pixel.\nread noise was 50 electrons, as a whole the electron bombarded imager would have an input referred noise of 0.2\nelectrons. Accordingly, using a frame-thinning approach\n35 originally developed for CCDs, it is possible to demonstrate\nhigh quantum efficiency in delta-doped CMOS arrays (FIG.\n12). This data show that reflection limited quantum efficiency\nis also attainable in delta-doped CMOS APS imaging detectors, just as with delta-doped CCDs. Accordingly, the detector\n4o array for use with the DDEBA detector of the current invention may also take the form of a delta-doped CMOS APS\ndevice.\nThe development of an electron bombarded delta-doped\nCMOS APS would complement the development of electron45 bombarded delta-doped CCDs, providing the following new\ncapabilities:\nUltra-low Power Imaging\nThe replacement of the MCPs would reduce the power in\nan EBCCD structure from tens or hundreds of watts down to\n5o a few watts.

Clarke and\nPaxton, 2002, have reviewed the basic principles of UV\nobservations of solar system atmospheres. (See, "Ultraviolet\nRemote Sensing Techniques for Planetary Aeronomy", J.\nClarke and L.
