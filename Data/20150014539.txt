Introduction\nChildhood obesity is a serious global public health concern (WHO, 2015; Wang Y &\nLobstein T, 2006). Low self-esteem and related mental health problems are common in obese\nchildren (Strauss RS, 2000) as well as poor academic performance and career development\n(Gurley-Calvez T, 2010).Westernized dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles are identified as the\nmajor risk factors of current alarming rate of obesity along with genetic susceptibility (Popkin\nBM, 1999). Children in many countries, including South Korea, have become increasingly\nsedentary due to urbanization changes in their respective societies (Ng SW, et al. 2009, Salmon J\net al. 2011). In particular, South Korea had abundant dissemination of mobile technology, such\nas tablet and smart phone devices. Children have become reliant on mobile devices and are less\nlikely to perform physical activities (Do, et al, 2013).\nEffective and sustainable intervention programs are needed to fight the global obesity\nepidemic (IOM, 2012; Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015). Previous studies suggested\nfocus on prevention strategies that begin in early childhood, a period when children establish\ntheir life habits. (Salmon J et al. 2011). Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis including\nours found that obesity prevention programs for young children have a greater intervention effect\n(Waters E, et al, 2011; Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015).\nThe NASA Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut (MX) program was developed to promote\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s exercise and healthy eating with excitement for training like an astronaut (Lloyd C,\n2012).At present, the NASA MX Program covered 28 countries, enrolled children through their\nteachers in school setting (MX report 2014, 2015).\nThis pilot study adapted the NASA MX intervention program for young children in South\nKorea. We assessed its feasibility and effectiveness in promoting physical activity (PA) in\nchildren and in improving parents\xe2\x80\x99 perspectives. We also examined the status of PA in young\nchildren. More than 80% of five-year-old children go to a Kindergarten or day care center in\nSouth Korea (MH Suh et al, 2013).Thus, reaching young children through child care and\neducation settings could be a good approach for early childhood obesity prevention.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1 Study design and subjects\nThis intervention pilot study was designed as a Korean adaptation of the NASA MX\nprogram for preventing childhood obesity. The study investigated the current status of PA among\nchildren in South Korea and whether the MX program increased children\xe2\x80\x99s PA. Other research\nquestions assessed parental belief regarding healthy behaviors and improvement in their\nknowledge of child health. The Korea Institute of Child Care and Education (KICCE) recruited\nhealthy children through kindergartens and daycare centers in the three months before the\nprogram started. After screening the facility quality and interviewing directors and teachers,\nthree kindergartens and eight lead teachers were selected to participate.\nWe included 5-year old children from three specified kindergartens in the city of Seoul,\nO-san, and Yong-in, but not younger children as they could verbally express their ideas and\nfeelings during the discussion section activity. It was important that children were able to\nparticipate in the discussion so that we could monitor their comprehension of the intervention\ncurriculum. After excluding those children without parental consent for participation (n=8), there\n3\n\nwere 212 children in eight classes at baseline. Parents of all participating children were involved\nin activities and baseline survey; 154 parents participated in post-intervention survey. To address\npossibility of selection bias due to the follow-up loss in post-intervention survey, we compared\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s baseline characteristics in between follow-up (n=154) and non-follow-up group (n=58)\nusing t-test and X2 test. There was no significant difference in children\xe2\x80\x99s sex (p=0.67), BMI\nstatus (p=0.31), score of leisure time activity at home (p=0.47) and physical activeness levels\n(p=0.40) at baseline. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the KyungHee University in South Korea (KHU IRB 2014-G20).\n2.2 Intervention program\nThe Mission X intervention materials were designed for children aged 8-12 years old. We\nadapted and developed an age-appropriate curriculum and teacher guidebook in Korean work\nwith an advisory committee. The teachers\xe2\x80\x99 guidebook provided aims, a list of necessary\nequipment, length of the activity, directions with introductory scripts and questions to bring\nchildren in, an astronaut toy, discussion topics during activity, figures and video clips to see\nactual practices, evaluation questions for group monitoring and assessment after the activity. It\nalso had additional guidelines for fitness acceleration, background information on the purpose of\nthe main activity, and safety. All teachers had training one month before the program started and\nreceived quality control monitoring and focus group discussion at least two times during this\nprogram.\nThe 6-week Korean adapted version of the Mission X curriculum selected topics on PA and\ntwo topics on nutrition education from the 18 modules provided in the standard NASA MX\nprogram. These modules were selected according to the recommendations of the KICCE\nadvisory committee members of early child care and education, sports science and preventive\nmedicine fields and current kindergarten and childcare center teachers (Table 1). Each activity\ntook about 40-60 minutes in the classroom or outside of the classroom dependent on the lead\nteacher\xe2\x80\x99s preference. The first activity launched at the last week of October 2014 and the last\nactivity took place during the first week of December 2014.\nWe provided weekly flyers to parents, which included the aims and background knowledge\non the activity and provided detailed direction for family activities at home that paralleled the\nclassroom learning to encourage continued practice of the activities at home. To monitor\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s changes at home, we had 4 times of focus group interviews with total 20 parents in\nabout 1.5 hours.\n--Table 1 about here -2.3 Assessment and measures\nTo understand the child\xe2\x80\x99s PA, diet and nutrition knowledge status and changes in parental\nattitude and belief on child health, a set of measures were collected at baseline and postintervention from children and their parents, including children\xe2\x80\x99s baseline BMI status, leisure\ntime activity at home, psychological need satisfaction in exercise scale, 2 days 24hr dietary\nrecall, dietary quality and habits (Kim H et al, 2012), nutrition knowledge (Yang I et al, 1995),\nparents attitude and beliefs in child\xe2\x80\x99s PA. Baseline weight and height were reported by their\nparents after measuring them at home. Others were collected from their parents by survey\n4\n\nquestionnaire. Lead teachers sent participating parents the pre questionnaire two weeks before\nthe program began and the post questionnaire within one week of the program\xe2\x80\x99s end.\nPreschool children are sensitive to examiners who score their PA and exercise ability,\ntherefore, we asked parents to respond to the questionnaires to mitigate unnecessary biased\nresults reported by children.\nBaseline body mass index (BMI) status\nBMI status was classified using the sex-age specific BMI percentiles from the Korean\nCDC Growth Chart (KCDC, 2007): 85th percentile and above to present those who are at risk of\noverweight (called \xe2\x80\x9coverweight\xe2\x80\x9d in this report), and under 10th percentile to present those who\nare at risk of underweight (called \xe2\x80\x9cunderweight\xe2\x80\x9d in this report). The rest were considered as\nnormal BMI.\nLeisure time activity at home\nWe used the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin G, Shephard RJ. 1997),\nwhich calculated the Weekly Leisure-Time Activity Score at home from the following equation:\nLeisure-Time Activity Score= (9 \xc3\x97 average frequency of strenuous exercise/ week) + (5 \xc3\x97\naverage frequency of moderate exercise/ week) + (3 \xc3\x97 average frequency of mild exercise/ week)\nThe questionnaire also included the definitions and examples of three types of exercise to\nguide parents and it had been used to measuring children\xe2\x80\x99s PA (Krebs N et al, 2007) and\nvalidated for Korean children as well (Kim Y et al, 2010). To monitor children\xe2\x80\x99s change in PA\nwe asked parents the differences in frequency, types of activity as well as interests, overall PA\nlevel of their children in the pre-and-post questionnaires. The level of PA was classified as active\nand insufficiently active by the cut point of 24 units, obtained with two intensities of strenuous\nand moderate. This cut point is closest to the public health recommendation \xe2\x80\x9cminimal weekly\nvolume with strenuous and/or moderate PA,\xe2\x80\x9d (Godin & Shephard, 1985). In addition, we asked\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s preferred type of PA, and their additional routine exercise with lessons (i.e. private\nsport club, recreational program in community facilities, etc.).\nPsychological need satisfaction in exercise scale\nPsychological need satisfaction after exercise is related to happiness and continued\nmotivation towards performing PA, which is based on the self-determination theory (Deci &\nRyan, 2002). Our research team used the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise scale that\nWilson PM, Rogers WT, Rodgers WM et al. (2006) developed and Kim SK (2007) validated in\nKorean. We asked parents to help children identify the visual representation of the Likert scale\nthat most closely matched their feelings. To perceive psychological need satisfaction in PA\nsettings, the components of competence, autonomy and relatedness were chosen to assess the\nsatisfaction of various exercises (Wilson PM et al, 2006). We used the three sub-scores and a\ntotal score to present results in this study.\n\n5\n\nParental attitude and beliefs\nWe asked parents the degree of change in their attitude and beliefs on 1) how PA is\nimportant to their child\xe2\x80\x99s health and development, 2) if their child can endure difficult exercise\nfor a prolonged time, 3) if their child is happy/satisfied during exercise, 4) whether children\xe2\x80\x99s\nself-confidence in exercise is related to a positive self-image at the end of the program. We also\nhad four focus group interviews with 12 parents to understand the social norms of children\xe2\x80\x99s PA\nand fitness.\n2.4 Statistical analyses\nTo present children\xe2\x80\x99s positive changes after this program, we used percentage of post\npositive change (PPC %).\nFor data analysis, firstly we tested sex differences in children\xe2\x80\x99s anthropometric\nmeasurements, their leisure time PA at home, and physical activeness levels using t-test and X2\ntest. Second, we used paired t-test and wilcoxon signed rank test whether there was significant\ndifference between pre and post in children\xe2\x80\x99s level of PA and psychological need satisfaction in\nexercise. Lastly, to examine whether there was a difference in demographic characteristics\namong those groups with a high PPC%, we assessed the measures (actual PA, children\xe2\x80\x99s\nsatisfaction with exercise, and parental attitudes and beliefs) by sex, BMI status, and PA levels\nusing X2 test. Data management and analysis were conducted using SAS 9.3 Cary, NC.\n3. Results\nBaseline characteristics of study subjects\nAt baseline, 12.8% of children were overweight, 18.2% underweight, the rest had a\nnormal BMI. Boys were generally heavier and taller than girls, but their BMIs were not\nsignificantly different.\nComparison of physical activity level by sex and BMI status at baseline\nGirls had significantly lower leisure time activity scores (mean: 40.7 (SD: 24.5)) than\nboys (59.0 (23.6)), the difference was 18.3 (p<0.001). Girls were 2.4 times more likely to be\ninsufficiently active than boys (43.3% vs. 17.9%, p<0.001) (Table 2).\nParticipating rate of the after-school PA program (private education) was significantly\ndifferent by sex: Fewer girls (47.9%) joined the PA program than Boys (71.7%). Also children at\nrisk of being overweight (50.0%) showed lower rate of participation in the program than others\n(Insufficient: 69.7%, normal: 58.1%). The children\xe2\x80\x99s preferred physical activities differed by sex.\nBoys were more likely to do Taekwondo (41.3%), soccer (40.4%) and swimming (26.9%), while\ngirls preferred jump roping (36.3%), biking (33.0%) and water playing (33.0%), which require\nless active motions than those in boys.\nLevel of PA did not differ significantly by children\xe2\x80\x99s BMI status (p>0.05). Those who\nwere underweight (32.4%) or overweight (37.5%) tended to be slightly more inactive than\nchildren had normal BMIs (27.9%) (Table 2).\n--Table 2 about here --\n\n6\n\nPre- vs. post changes in children\xe2\x80\x99s PA, interest in PA and their satisfaction in exercise\nAccording to parental report, about half of children became more physically active\n(49.4%) and more interested in exercise (59.1%) after the intervention than at baseline. More\nthan half of the children had better psychological need satisfaction in exercise (competence:\n60.4%, relatedness: 69.5% and autonomy: 52.6%) than at baseline. There were statistically\nsignificant pre and post differences in children\xe2\x80\x99s level of PA and psychological need satisfaction\nin exercise (p<0.001) (Table 3).\nThere was no significant difference in the level of changes on children\xe2\x80\x99s physical\nactiveness and interest in exercise by sex, BMI status or children\xe2\x80\x99s previous activeness level after\nthe MX program (p>0.05). However the positive changes in level of physical activeness and\ninterested in exercise were quite different by children\xe2\x80\x99s BMI status: children at risk of being\nunderweight were 1.6 times more likely to improve their physical activeness (45.2 vs. 27.8%)\nand they were 1.8 times more likely to increase their interest in exercise (68.2 vs. 38.9%) than\nthose children at risk of overweight after the program. Overweight children were less likely to\nincrease PA or interest in exercise than others after the intervention program. Girls had a slightly\nhigher percent of positive change in psychological need satisfaction in exercise in terms of\ncompetence and relatedness than boys, although they were not significantly different (p>0.05)\n(Table 3).\nParents reported that 26.6% children changed their preferred type of PA, 34.4% children\nincreased their frequency of PA and 27.9% children spent more time on PA than before this\nprogram. However there was no significant difference in the change of type, frequency and time\nspent on PA after this MX program by sex, BMI status, and children\xe2\x80\x99s previous activeness level\n(p>0.05).\n--Table 3 about here --\n\nParental changes in their attitude and beliefs about their children\xe2\x80\x99s PA\nTable 4 showed how parents described their changes in attitude and beliefs on children\xe2\x80\x99s\nPA and their health after the intervention. A majority of parents reported that PA was a necessity\nfor their children (94.2%); 64.3% of the participating parents said they had underestimated their\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s capability and found their children can do more strenuous exercise than they had\nexpected; 80.5% of parents became aware of an improvement in their children\xe2\x80\x99s happiness after\nPA; and 80% parents found there was a positive relationship between children\xe2\x80\x99s self-competence\nin PA and their self- esteem (Table 4).\nIn particular, those parents of overweight children were more likely to recognize that PA\nwas a necessity for their children (100.0%), to reassess their children\xe2\x80\x99s PA capability (77.8%)\nand to be aware of increased happiness after PA (94.4%) than others. There was no significant\ndifference in parental attitude and beliefs about children\xe2\x80\x99s PA by children\xe2\x80\x99s sex, BMI status and\nprevious physical activeness level (p>0.05) (Table 4).\n7\n\n--Table 4 about here -4. Discussion\nThis study adapted the NASA MX Program for young children in South Korea and found\nthat the program was feasible and effective in promoting PA in children and in improving their\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 attitude and beliefs about child\xe2\x80\x99s PA. After the intervention, 49.4% of children increased\ntheir physical activeness and 59.1% of children became more interested in exercise. Children\nalso gained psychological need satisfaction in exercise regarding to competence, relatedness and\nautonomy. Parents increased their recognition of the necessity of childhood PA (94.2%),\nreassessment of child\xe2\x80\x99s PA capability (64.3%), awareness of child\xe2\x80\x99s happiness after PA (80.5%).\nThere was no significant difference in children and their parental changes by children\xe2\x80\x99s sex, BMI\nstatus and PA level at baseline. The results of this pilot study suggest that the newly adapted MX\nprogram is an affordable early childhood obesity prevention program.\nHealth promotion programs in young children may be more effective and easier to\nimplement than those in older children (Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015; Water E et al,\n2011). Children format their behavior patterns in preschool years along with proficient basic\nmotor and physical skill development (Lakshman R et al. 2013). Although few studies have been\ndeveloped for obesity intervention among preschool-aged children, preschool-aged children have\nshown greater intervention effects (-0.26kg/m2) when compared to older children (-0.15kg/m2 in\naged 6-12, -0.09kg/m2 in aged 13-18) the 2011 updated Cochrane review (Waters E, et al, 2011).\nThis evidence highlights the importance of early childhood obesity prevention programs.\nIn addition, due to the linkage between self-determination theory and health promotion\nattempts (Frederick-Recascino, 2002), the future PA levels of preschool-aged children can be\nself-motivated by their psychological need satisfaction in exercise from this early exposure of\nroutine physical movement. In this study we found more than half of children increased\npsychological need satisfaction in exercise than before as well as their changes in physical\nactiveness and interests in PA after participating in this program. Childhood obesity prevention\nprogram should take this benefit to build children\xe2\x80\x99s healthy habits from early exposure of regular\nphysical movement.\nIn particular, the overweight children did not show much increase in interest in exercise\nor satisfaction when performing exercise, although there was no significant difference, which we\nbelieve is due to the small sample size of this study. A systematic review for the association\nbetween health benefits and PA in school-aged children from 86 original papers showed similar\nresults. Only moderate to vigorous intensity PA were consistently and strongly related to obesity\nreduction (Janssen L et al, 2010), because obese children have reduced aerobic and anaerobic\ncapacities (Lafortuna CL, 2002). Further attention is needed to develop self-motivated PA\nstrategies for overweight and obese children than others.\nWe found sex difference in level of PA. Girls were less physically active than boys, as\nthey were two times more likely to be in insufficiently active group. Fewer girls (47.9%) joined\nin the afterschool PA promotion program than Boys (71.7%). The preferred types of activities\namong Korean girls requires less active motions than those in boys. This result was similar to\nseveral previous reports in other countries. Girls were less likely to engage in vigorous activity\nthan boys during recess in U.S. schools (Ridgers ND, et al, 2010). Seven studies in Australian,\n\n8\n\nCanadian, Spain, Estonian, Singaporean, and other countries\xe2\x80\x99 consistently showed female\nchildren spent less time on exercise, organized sports, and were less active than boys (Bailey R et\nal, 2005). In addition girls are expected to be more inactive after the transition period from early\nchildhood to adolescence (Craig et al, 2001).\nStudies suggest that inactive behavioral characteristics and the ecological influence of\nbuilt environments increase the sex difference gap. Ridgers and colleges found that girls\npreferred to chat in a small group and engage in verbal games, conversation and socializing\nrather than physically moving (Ridgers et al, 2010). Additionally, girls can be more influenced\nby safety issues in their neighborhood, and accessibility of recreational parks and facilities than\nboys, which have been shown to have a significant association with children\xe2\x80\x99s PA levels\n(Pradinuk M, et al, 2011). Another possible barrier is the indirect impact of peer pressure and\ncultural expectations, which may reduce the amount of PA performed by girls. Conversely, boys\nmay experience more peer pressure for PA than girls, as this study showed 71.7% of boys (vs.\n47.9% in girls) participated in the afterschool PA program. Girls may be encouraged to seek\ncertain activities which their peers perceived as feminine (Bailey R et al, 2005).\nDifferent gender norms in PA may exist in the Korean culture. A study reported that boys\nwere deemed more aggressive and competitive, and girls were perceived to promote fun-based\nlearning environments in Indian children (Ramanathan S, et al, 2009). In this study, parents of\nfemale participants were more likely to report improvement in happiness among their children\nthan those parents of male participants (86.1 vs. 75.6%) and the relationship between children\xe2\x80\x99s\ncompetence in PA and self-esteem (83.3 vs. 76.8%). Still, post-positive changes were not\nsignificantly different by sex. Further studies are needed to identify how peer influence and\ncultural differences act on the sex-differences in PA levels in South Korea.\nBuild a community network among kindergartens, day-care centers and families are key\nfor successful health promotion programs in young children. In this program, the kindergarten\nteachers taught children how to perform certain PA and why it is important for their health.\nMany childhood obesity prevention studies had school based setting (83.9% from all\ninterventional study by 2012 in Wang Y et al, 2013). Schools have been identified as the most\nimportant channel of obesity intervention for school-aged children because they offer access to\nlarge populations of students and provide the opportunity to institutionalize obesity prevention\nprograms in communities (Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y et al, 2015). In particular, more than\n80% of Korean children who are four and five go to kindergarten or a daycare center. The\nKorean government recently started to support all tuition for early child care and education\nregardless of family income level, which has increased attendance (Seo MH et al 2013). In South\nKorea, kindergarten and daycare centers could be the best network to empower young children to\ndevelop healthy habits.\nWe found parents changed their beliefs and attitudes on children\xe2\x80\x99s PA even though they\nonly had the program through the weekly family flyers and one time focus group interviews.\nPreviously our team examined the effectiveness of childhood obesity prevention programs in\nhigh-income countries, and found that the most effective programs were those were delivered a\nPA intervention in a school-based setting with a family component, or diet and PA interventions\nin a school-based setting with home- and community components (Wang Y et al, 2013; Wang Y\net al, 2015). Parental belief changes may lead to a family focus on PA. In a previous focus group\nstudy children mentioned that they did not perform activity outside of the home or kindergarten\n9\n\ndue to parents\xe2\x80\x99 and teachers\xe2\x80\x99 perceived risk that children could be hurt or catch a cold (Cammisa\nM et al. 2011). Childhood obesity prevention programs should involve parents and primary child\ncare providers to get their children active and improve children\xe2\x80\x99s health outcomes.\nLimitations of this study included its small sample size, the relatively short intervention\nduring six weeks (which might not be long enough to change children\xe2\x80\x99s PA behaviors and BMI),\nfollow-up loss in post-intervention survey, and that BMI was not assessed post-intervention.\nHowever, this is the first pilot study to develop pre-school age curriculum for obesity prevention\nthough the network with kindergarten and child care center setting with a parent component in\nSouth Korea. Therefore, we investigated the intervention effect on various aspects of children\xe2\x80\x99s\nphysical activeness as well as their psychological need satisfaction. Psychological change in\nchildren is important as it may promise their future motivation for PA and overall health. Early\nchild care and education system is a strategic network for preventing childhood obesity. Parents\nwill play a key role. Our study showed that after the intervention, the majority of parents showed\nchanges in their attitude and beliefs regarding their children\xe2\x80\x99s PA, thus may allow their children\nto have more PA at home and in school.\nIn conclusion, this pilot child obesity prevention program adopted from the NASA child\nfitness promotion program showed benefits on young children and their parents in South Korea.\nFurther research needs to test its long-term effects on child BMI and other health outcomes.\n\n10\n\nReferences\n1.
