BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS.)\n\n-3-\n\nSCOUT DEVELOPMENT\nNASA\'s Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., developed\nthe Scout vehicle and manages it under the overall direction\nof the Headquarters Office of Space Science and Applications.\nThe Astronautics Division of LTV Aerospace Corp., Dallas, Texas,\nis prime contractor.\n\nA new second-stage motor manufactured by Thiokol Chemical\nCorp., Huntsville, Ala., and a new fourth-stage produced by\nUnited Technology Center, Sunnyvale, Calif., will be flight\ntested for the first time on the Scout vehicle by the forthcoming launch.\n\nThe improved second stage motor \xe2\x80\x94\n\nCastor IIA \xe2\x80\x94 is\n\ndesigned to deliver 58,000 pounds of thrust with a burning\ntime of 4l seconds.\n\nThe new fourth stage, designated PW-4,\n\nis intended to produce 5*600 pounds of thrust with a burning\ntime of 31 seconds.\n\n-more-\n\n-4The concept of air transportability for the fully-assembled\nScout will receive a final evaluation during the operation.\nOn July 27* the assembled vehicle with live motors and its\ntransporter went through the simulated airlift from Wallops.\nAn Air Force C-133 exposed it to an airlift flight environment\nanticipated during delivery to a launch site.\n\nComplete launch\n\nreadiness checks have been repeated since the flight.\n\nNASA officials in charge of the Scout program hope to\nrealize economic and reliability benefits by processing all\nScout vehicles at a single location using recently improved\nprocedures, then airlifting the complete vehicles on their\ntransporters to any launch site.\n\nA preliminary air trans-\n\nportability test was made in May 1964, with a Scout fitted\nwith dummy motors. Good results obtained in that test led\nto last week\'s flight with the complete vehicle.\nThe evaluation Scout will flight-test two improved fourthstage spin rockets.\n\nThe improved spin motors will be combined\n\nwith two of the earlier type for the coming flight.\n\nIncreased\n\nspin Impulse is desirable to match the heavier payloads\ncontemplated for future missions.\nbefore fourth-stage motor ignition.\n\n-more-\n\nSpin-up occurs six seconds\n\n-5During the flight, the Scout guidance system will be\nprogrammed to perform a yaw torquing or "dog-leg" maneuver\nto achieve a higher orbit inclination angle than those previously\nflown from Wallops Island.\n\nThe capability for yaw torquing has existed in the guidance\nsystem but has not been exercised.\n\nPresent orbit inclination\n\nangles from Wallops Island are about 52 degrees.\n\nWith yaw torquing (right or left), the Scout will be\ncapable of attaining either a 73 or a 28-degree orbit with a\n100-pound payload at an altitude of 460 statute miles.\n\nThus,\n\norbits more nearly polar or more nearly equatorial are possible from the Wallops launch site.\n\nThe yaw maneuver will be performed by the hydrogen\nperoxide Jet control system during the third-stage coasting\nperiod before fourth-stage spin-up and ignition.\n\nBecause engineering evaluation of the Scout system performance is the primary purpose of the flight, special instrumentation and telemetry packages have been provided for gathering\na number of measurements in addition to those regularly made.\n\n-more-\n\n-6A precision velocity meter will make very accurate\nmeasurements of vehicle velocities through fourth-stage\nburning. Other instruments will measure vibration, temperatures, motor pressures, spin-motor performance, ignition\nsystem voltages and other quantities needed for a complete\nengineering evaluation of the performance of the improved\nScout.\n\nElectrostatic charge measurements will be made on\n\nstages two and three.\n\nImproved solid-state telemetry systems will be used to\nreduce weight and increase reliability.\n\nFinally, a new lightweight radar tracking beacon will\nbe carried on the vehicle.\nSECOR SATELLITE\n\nOperation of the Sequential Collation of Range (SECOR)\nsystem of satellites and overaeas ground stations is a\nproject directed by the Army Map Service, Corps of Engineers,\nU.S. Army.\n\nIn addition to pinpointing the locations of land bodies\nseparated by large expanses of ocean, the SECOR system will\nhelp in determining the exact size and shape of the Earth.\n-more-\n\n-7The satellites and ground stations provide an all-weather\nsystem for measuring distances up to 1,000 miles to an accuracy\nof less than 100 feet.\n\nKey piece of equipment on the 45-pound satellite is an\neight-pound transponder, a transistorized device which receives\nand retransmits radio signals from four ground locations that\nmeasure the range to the orbiting satellite.\n\nIn operation, precise location of three of the stations\nis known. Location of the fourth is determined mathematically\nfrom the measured ranges.\n\nTwo Geodetic Explorer satellites (GEOS A & B) planned\nby NASA for launch this year and next will integrate use of\nthe existing Army SECOR ground stations in support of the\nNational Geodetic Satellite Program which has as an objective\na refined mathematical determination of the Earth\'s size,\nshape, mass and variations in gravity.\n\nThe planned SECOR satellite orbit, subject to pre-launch\nrevision, will have a peak altitude of about 1,725 statute miles\nand a low point of about 690 statute miles.\ninclined about 65 degrees to the Equator.\n\n-more-\n\nIt will be\n\n-8PROJECT PARTICIPANTS\n\nScout is managed by NASA\'s Langley Research Center, Hampton,\nVa., under the general direction of the Office of Space Science\nand Applications, NASA Headquarters.\n\nPrincipals are:\n\nNASA HEADQUARTERS\n\nDr. Homer E.
