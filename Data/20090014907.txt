The UMS is designed to operate in conjunction with the airflow of\nthe Waste Collector Subsystem (WCS) of the ISS; the hardware consists of a laptop computer and a\nmechanical module. The laptop will be the primary crew interface, while the mechanical module contains\na liquid/air separator, a motor, solenoid valves, fluid plumbing and the sample acquisition port. While\ndeployed, the mechanical module will reside in the Waste and Hygiene Compartment in the U.S.\nLaboratory Module, Destiny.\nDuring the equipment checkout,the UMS hardware will be functionally tested to determine its efficacy at\neliminating liquid carry-over between cycles, inaccurate void volume measurements, and cross\ncontamination in void samples. Samples obtained as part of the checkout will be returned aboard STS129/ULF3 for postflight analysis. Once proper functioning has been verified, the UMS will be available for\nuse by experiments that require urine collection.\nA safe, accurate and reliable means of obtaining representative urine samples and total void volume\nmeasurements from the ISS crewmembers is essential to human research. Use of the UMS will\nsubstantially reduce the launch mass and volume of consumables required for urine collection, eliminate\nthe need for on-orbit stowage and disposal of large quantities of leftover urine, avoid the loss of urine to\nthe water reclamation system when urine samples are required, resolve gender issues with the current\nsystem, and provide ease of operation.\nThe UMS will also facilitate the performance of future investigations requiring urine sample collection by\nautomatically measuring void volume which is required to enable future real-time analysis of samples.\nOn-orbit analysis would reduce the number of samples requiring return to Earth and provide more timely\nresults to investigators and feedback to medical personnel regarding crew health.\nProject Type: Facility\nImages and Captions:\n\nComputer generated depiction of the Urine Monitoring System (UMS).

One crewmember will act as both operator and\nsubject to perform UMS tasks.\n\no\n\nThe crewmember will perform evaluation exercises for air flow, calibration, and user interface.\n\no\n\nSamples from the calibration exercises and from the user interface evaluations will be returned to\nground for additional analysis.\n\nOperations: The crew will install and activate the ISS UMS. One crewmember will act as both operator\nand subject to perform the following tasks:\no Airflow evaluation will demonstrate existence of proper airflow at the ISS UMS urinal hose user\ninterface. The operator will insert a male funnel at ISS UMS urinal hose, verify nominal urine\nprefilter is installed, and activate the ISS UMS. Once the ISS UMS is ready to accept liquid, the\noperator will inject water into funnel from approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1-cm) away\nutilizing the personal hygiene hose.\no Calibration evaluation is intended to gain thorough separator bowl pressure readings for:\npressure versus volume calibration and precise and accurate individual void volume\nmeasurements. The operator will inject each pre-filled calibration syringe into the ISS UMS urinal\nhose, simulating various micturition (urination) volumes. Certain calibration syringes will be\ninjected one per cycle and treated as single micturitions, while others will be injected in sets per\ncycle. The operator will also acquire samples for postflight analysis. One set of calibration\nsyringes will be utilized upon ISS UMS activation (checkout start) and one set of calibration\nsyringes are to be utilized prior to ISS UMS deactivation (checkout end) A total of thirty-four\ncalibration syringes will be utilized for the evaluation.\no Full user interaction evaluation: will involve participating crewmember to utilize the ISS UMS\nduring nominal micturition in lieu of direct WCS utilization. Crewmembers will complete a nominal\nISS UMS cycle for each micturition, including acquisition of a sample for postflight analysis. All\nmicturitions in a day for five mission days is planneded.\nCategory: Facilities\nSubcategory: Small Hardware\nManifest Status: Ongoing\nAvailability: Developed for ISS\nPrevious Missions: The UMS is a successor design to the existing Space Shuttle Urine Monitoring\nSystem, which flew on seven Shuttle flights after its initial development in 1979.\nSupporting Organization: Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD)\nWeb Sites:\nISS UMS GFE Website\nhttp://ea.jsc.nasa.gov/eawebfiles/ea-projects/flightgfe/ISS_UMS/html/ISS_UMS.htm\n\n'
