Langel\nThe near-earth magnetic field is a com p lex combination of fields from outside the earth, fields from\nthe core of the earth and fields from the crust of\nthe earth. Furthermore, the first two mentioned\nsources are time varying. Magnetic field measurements\nfrom space have proven to be the only practical tray\nto obtain timely, global surveys. Early measurements,\ncommencing with the Sputnik and Vangiard spacecraft,\nmeasured only the magnitude of the field due to the\nextreme difficulty of making accurate vector measurements. The Magsat spacecraft, operable from November 2, 1979 through June 11, 1980, obtained the first\ntriily accurate, global, vector magnetic survey. The\nattitude accuracy of 20 arc-seconds was achieved by\nthe use of two star cameras and a very accurate sunsensor supplemented by a pitch gyro and an optical\nsystem to transfer the spacecraft attitude to the\nlocation of the vector magnetometer at the end of the\nboom.\nMeasurements from Magsat, and earlier spacecraft,\nhave been utilized to map both the earth\'s core fields\nand the fields arising in the geologically interesting\ncrust of the earth. The standard model of the core\nfield is of the same form today as that developed by\nGauss in 1939. It consists of a scalar potential represented by a spherical harmonic series. Models of\nthe crustal field are relatively new. The first\nglobal map appeared in the literature in 1975. Mathematical representation is achieved in localized areas\nby arrays of dipoles appropriately located in the\nearth\'s crust.\nBesides the obvious use for navigation, measurements\nof the earth\'s field are utilized in diverse fields\nsuch as mapping of charged particles in the magnetosphere, studying fluid properties in the earth\'s core,\ninferring the electrical conductivity of the upper\nmantle and delineating regional scale geologic features.\n\n(1)\n\n}\n\nR\'\n\nF\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe near-earth magnetic field contains contributions -From three sources:\nthe earth\'s core, the earth\'s crust, and external current systems in the\nearth\'s ionosphere and beyond. By far the largest in magnitude is the\nfield from the core, or the "main" field. Nearly dipolar in nature, the\nstrength of the main field is more than 50,000 nT (nanotesla) as the\npoles and near 30,000 nT at the equator. Its variation with time\n("secular" variation) is slow, with a maximum of about 1% per year.\nExternal current systems are time varying on a scale of seconds to days\nand can vary in ma g nitude from a fraction to thousands of nanoteslas.\nThese current systems are located in a ce-vity-like region surrounding\nthe earth, known as the "magnetosphere." Although always present the\nstrength and location of these currents vary considerably between\nperiods of magnetic quiet, defined as titres when the temporal variation\nis small, and periods of magnetic disturbance when the temporal varia-\n\ntions become Large.\nPrior to the satellite era the earth\'s magnetic field was (and still is)\nmonitored by means of permanent magnetic observatories that measure the\nambient field continuously (Figure 1), and by periodically repeating\nmeasurements at selected sites. Field surveys are necessary to fill in\nthe spatial gaps between observatories and repeat sites. Such surveys\nwere first conducted by early mariners and land surveyers.\nEdmund Hall\'ey made a sea voyage during 1689-11700 expressly to survey the\nmagnetic field over the oceans, In 1701 he published the first chart of\nthe magnetic declination in the region of the Atlantic Ocean; in the\nfollowing year he extended his chart to the Indian Ocean and to the sea\nnear China.\nIn addition \'to land and sea surveys some aircraft have been especially\nadapted for the measurement of magnetic fields. Such surveys have\nusually, although not always, measured only the scalar magnitude of the\nfield. Mary countries have been surveyed in their entirety, some more\nthan once. In addition to their obvious value for modeling the earth\'s\nmain field, such surveys are particularly useful for mapping the anomaly\nfield at low altitude and, as a result, have been conducted by the oil\nand mineral exploration industry on a local scale.\n\nSatellite measurements of the geomagnetic field began with the launch\nof Sputnik 3 in May 1958 and have continued sporadically in the intervening years. Table 1 is a list of spacecraft that have made significant contributions to our understanding of the near-earth geomagnetic\nfield. Each had its own limitations, ranging from a lack of global\ncoverage caused by the absence of on-board tape recorders to limited\naccuracy due either to instrumental shortcomings or to ambient spacecraft fields. Prior to Magsat, only the polar orbiting OGO 2, 4, and 6\n(POGO) satellites have provided a truly accurate, global geomagnetic\nsurvey. These satellites operated between 1965 and 1971; their alkali\nvapor magnetometers provided global measurements of the field magnitude\napproximately every 1/2 second over an altitude range of about 400 Ito\n1500 kn.1,2\n(2)\n\nr\t\n\n-\t i\t ^.\t ^\n\nt\n\nA^,^+i\n1 M.\'\n\nr\xe2\x80\xa2f\t\n\nSJ\t\n\n\\\t\n\nT.L/p\n\n,.^: etr\n\n.\n\n^ / is\niTl.r^\n\n`7 i\t\n`\t\n\n.^a\n\nI.\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2\t ^\t\n\n1\n\n,^T\n\n,^\t\n\n51 r;\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\n\nI\n\nt\t\n\n\'\'\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^^ r \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2-,ems,:. r \xe2\x80\xa2 s ",\t\n\n^+\t\n\n.:-\t\n\n__\t\n\nt\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n^^\n\nLJ\n\n^.\n\n..J..\n\n1\t \'\n-\n\nI\t\n\nt\t\n\nC\t\n\n.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x94ewr,^T\'\xe2\x80\xa2,^.^ i..,..y^ \t\n\n_\t\n\nt\t\nt\t\n^\t\n^.^^T^\'. ^_r!T ^v+!^ +4w`^^.s\xe2\x80\xa2wx\xe2\x80\xa2^w\xe2\x80\xa2^. .\n\nMAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES IN^\nOPERATION\t 1978\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n_\t\n\n..wMw\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nw.^l^w\xe2\x80\xa2.w\t\n\n..v.1^.^\'t\n\nFig. 1\n\nTahlc 1\nSATILL11\'IS 1\'H A^T ONE W.A`,VRLD TI4C wrAlt L-NkrH\n\nCL!

Magsat was launched into an orbit\nwith 96.76 0 inclination, 561 km apogee and 352 km perigee. The orbit\nwas sun-synchronous in the twilight plane. The magnetic field was\nmeasured with both a cesium vapor and a fluxgate magnetometer. In\norder to achieve 6 nT accuracy in the component measurements it was\nrequired to measure the spacecraft attitude to 20 arc-seconds. This\nwas accomplished by two star cameras on-board the spacecraft and a sunsensor attached to the vector magnetometer. In order to eliminate the\neffect of spacecraft magnetic fields, the magnetometers were located at\nthe end of\n3 meter boom. An optical system measured the attitude of\nthe magnetometer relative to the star cameras.\n\na\n\nMagsat remained in orbit until June 11. Figure 2 shows the decay of the\n\norbit.\n\nMagsat has provided the first truly global geomagnetic surveys since the\nPOGO satellites and the very first global survey of vector components of\nthe geomagnetic field. Designed with two major measurement tasks in\nview, Magsat provided a global vector survey of the main geopotential\nfield and a lower altitude measurement of crustal anomalies.\n\'\t\nr\nData from Magsat is being analyzed by a large number of investigators,\nsome of whom are working cooperatively. Investigations are being\ncarried out by scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and\nthe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and by scientists selected in\nresponse to a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO). This report\nreflects mainly the work at GSFC. A total of 19 domestic and 13 foreign\ninvestigators were selected from responses to the A0.\n\nMAGSAT APOGEE AND PERIGEE HEIGHTS\n(Km) vs. TIME\nKa,\n\n560\nasp\n4t10\n350\n300\n75f1\nPRE LAL\n?00\n150\n100\n\nY\n4 PP I, P l^ J\xe2\x80\xa2 1 1 71 a l 1 \t\nNOV }DEC JAN 1R[U Fg8\t\n\nFig.\n\n1 N 711 1 71. 711,\nMAR _ APR\n\nMAY _ JUN\n\nz\n\n(4)\n\nGEOMAGNETIC HELD MODELING\nGeomagnetic field modeling derives the spherical harmonicpotential\nfunction that best represents the main field of the earth ir, a leastsquares sense. Theoretically such a putential function could be made to\nrepresent both the core and crustal fields exactly. in practice a\nrestricted model must be chosen on practical grounds: the finite limitation on computer Si4e and speed. Most researchers attempt only to \xe2\x80\xa2 epre-\n\nsent the core field with a potential function and use alternate methods\nof describing the crustal fields.\nOne of the principal contributions of satellite magnetic field measurements to geomagnetism has been to make available a truly global distri-\n\nbution of data. Surface measurements are notably sparse, particularly\nin oceanic and remote regions. The problem is compounded by the secular\nvariation in the main geomagnetic field which as was stated earlier, can\nmuch\nas 1% per year in some localities. This means that to\namount to as\nrepresent the global geomagnetic field accurately at any given time\n(epoch), worldwide measurements must be made, at times near that epoch,\na feat only achieved by satellite observations, and even then only by\nthe POGO and Magsat satellites with their on-board tape recorders and\nsecular\nva*r-ianear-polar orbits. Accurate global reprosentation Of the\nSurveys.\ntion itself would require periodic worldwide\nThe POGO satellites accomplished one such survey and Magsat furnished (Another. These,\ntogether with existing surface data, permit accurate global representation of secular variation for the period beginning with GIGO 2 until the\ndemise OF Magsat: roughly October 1965 through June 1980. Future satellite surveys will be needed for accurate global representations beyond\nthe lifetime of Magsat.\nAlthough POGO data were global and taken over a short time span, the\nlimitation Of Measuring only the field magnitude resulted in some\nambUgUity in the f i e ld direction in spherical harmonic analyses based on\nPOGO data\n\nalone. 3 -\t\n\nThis ambiguity has been removed\n\nby\n\nthe acquisition\n\nof global vector data with Magsat. In deriving a spherical harmonic\nmodel, the presence of large amplitude external fields would contaminate\nFor\nthis reason only data from selected magnetically quiet\nthe results.\n\nperiods is chosen.\n\nOf\n\nthe Magsat data currently available for analysis,\n\nNovember 5 and 6 showed the lowest value of magnetic activity indices.\nPlots of the data indicated that these days were indeed very quiet\nmagnetically. Accordingly, a selection of 15,206 data points from those\ndays was used to derivq ^he first geomagnetic field model from Magsat,\ndesignated MGST (6/80) .\n\nThis model fits the selected data with the mean and standard deviations\n\nas follows:\n\n(5)\n\n\t\n\nComponent\n\nMean\nDeviation\n\n(^!T)_\n\nar\n\nStandard\nDeviation\n(LT\n\n\t\n\nmagnitude\nBr\nB6\nB^\n\n0.1\t\n2.5\n\t\n-0.1\n\t\n0.5\n\n8.2\n6.5\n7.6\n7.4\n\nThe fit to the data is very good with deviations mainly due to a combination of fields from unmodeled external and crustal sources.\nMagsat data has now beer~ coi lbined with other selected data to derive a\npreliminary model va"id For- the period 1960 to 1980. In order to represent the long term, or secular, variation of the main field, first,\nsecond and third derivation of some of the spherical harmonic coefficients were derived. Besides Magsat, POGO data, data from 147 magnetic\nobservatories and selected repeat station and shipborne data were\nincluded. The resulting spherical harmonic coefficients, designated\nGSFC(9/80) are given in Table 2. Table 3 summarizes the statistics for\nGSFC(9/80) and, for comparison, our best pre-Magsat model (PMAG(6/80)),\nthe recently published 8 model used in the British and U.S. Naval 1980\nworld magne\xe2\x80\xa2iic charts, WC80, the mode1 9 utilized in the USGS 1975 world\ncharts, and the MGST(6/91 0) model. Note;\nL The GSFC(9/$0) model represents the Magsat data almost as well as\ndoes MGST(6/80) even though GSFC(9/80) is applicable for 20 years v,hile\nMGST(6/80) is for a single epoch.\n2. PMAG(7/80) represents Magsat data substantially better than other\npre-Magsat models.\n3. Both PMAG(7/80) and GSFC(9/80) represent the POGO data better than\neitherWC80 or ACW75.\nIt is not really fair to compare the representation of surface data\nbetween models since some models include solution for the observatory\nanomaly fields at the surface.\nFigure 3 shows how these procedures allow accurate representation of\nobservatory data during the time span of the data utilized in the model.\nThe data plotted is for the observatory at Amberley. The three\nmeasured components,, yearly averages, are plotted with X, Y, Z symbols.\nThe predicted field from GSFC(9/80), taking the observatory anomaly\nsolution into account, is represented by the indicated lines. The\nmodel represents the measured field very well for 1960.5-1975.5 but\nincreasingly diverge for years prior to 1960.

Anomaly maps have been derived from aeromagnetic and shipborne data for many years and used in the construction of\ngeologic/geophysical models of the crust. Investigations with aeromag\nnetic and shipborne magnetic data have mainly concentrated on the very\nlocalized anomalies associated with small-scale geologic features and\nlocalized mineralization. However, in the past few years there has\nbeen an increased interest in studies of the broad-scale anomalies that\nappear in regional compilations of aeromagnetic and shipborne data.10-14\nSatellite anomaly maps are of recent origin and describe only the very\nbroadest scale anomalies. Aeromagnetic and shipborne anomaly maps have\nusually been interpreted assuming a flat earth and a constant ambient\nfield over the region of interest. Because of the extremely large scale\nof satellite-derived anomalies, both of these assumptions become invalid,\nthus necessitating development of new analysis techniques.\nOriginally, it was thought impossible to detect fields of crustal origin\nin satellite data. However, while analyzing data from tte POGO satellites, Regan et al. 15 discovered that the lower-altitude data contained\nseparable fields caused by crustal anomalies, Figure 4, thus opening the\ndoor to a new class of investigations. ;;one of the satellites shown in\nTable 1 was designed for solid earth studies, yet results from the POGO\nsatellites have demonstrated the capability of mapping broad-scale\nanomalies. Although the map of Regan et al. was partially contaminated\n\n(9)\n\n^.w\n\na\n\nby "noise" from magnetospheric \xe2\x80\xa2 and ionospheric fields, the reality and\ncrustal origin of several of the anomalies defined by the map were\nclearly demonstrated. More recently Langel et al. 5 have compared a\nPOGO-derived anomaly map with upward-continued aeromagnetic data from\nwestern Canada. Figure 5 shows the results of that comparison. The\ntwo maps are in substantial agreement, demonstrating further both the\nreality and crustal origin of the anrtmalies\n"\n\'\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9d ^r " :+r a,-.. x r7\' t"^i\n^\' ,: ^ x\'Iv^x%. arr:,-\xe2\x80\x9e;a^^. eAit^1:\n^\nr:\n^.^ ^.,...\xc2\xbb.-...+a-..^.sa^a "vss:rt;^: ;r^"^".,.....rn\xe2\x80\xa2at^\xe2\x80\xa2,^..^;.r.\xc2\xab..x , ^.,r} rer;:^\n\nr\n\n40\n\n30\n20\n\nto\n01(\n\xe2\x80\xa210\n.20\n\n-30\n-40\n0 20 4A 60 80 104 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 34 0 3GOVI\nrgy\t\nr"T\n.0/t!\'P"+\'7\xe2\x80\xa2"\'^"\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2"*!fT\n+-\t\n.\':\'";"""r\xe2\x80\x94rrt^\xe2\x80\x9e.ar\' \xc2\xb0"0 \t ti.\xc2\xbbr.1r,\xe2\x96\xba\xc2\xbb++ r+srw\'e^\xe2\x80\xa2Y\'\n_^.:rtsrfws;r+,Y \t\n\xe2\x80\x94 ^\'+^.yr.:^ \t\n^t,^yr^,.:\t\nr v +t H\t\n\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\xa2*..--::...\xe2\x80\x94=.:..:^a..:..^:Ayc"\nIS\nan\nH\n\' AFTER\t REGA ,\t Al^^ ^ Y\nI, GEOPN, RES., 80 800, 1915\n^"\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n` \xc2\xb0 ^t\' M ^^\t\n{.rr\n\nf\ny r\n\ni+\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\t\n\n^\ntbeM\'ietow _\n\n*\t\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 w\t\n\n_\t\n\n. .\t\n\n..; ..^..\t\n\nto +\n^Eb+6\t\t\n\n,.\t\n\nmotto-4\n\n0to+t\t\n\n44 )9+6\t\n\nAle\xc2\xbbL\n\n, \xc2\xbb.._\xc2\xbbgym.\t\n\n-4 014\n\nn" -_.\n\naly\nGlobal magnetic-anomaly man; contour tttc " \xe2\x96\xbatal, 2 gammas\n\nFig. 4 The First Published Global Satellite Magnetic Anomaly Map\nUPWARD\t\n\nCOf MNUATION\t\nRM km\t\n\nSCALAR MAGNE\'1lC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^ L\n\nHELD ANOMAUES\ncnCO SATELUTE5\n\n1\n^.,\n\neo\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWN\n22\n\ntoo\'\n\n50\'\n\n240 \'\t\n\n240,\n\n\xc2\xbb Fig. 5 Comparison Between Upward Continued Aeromagnetic\nData and POGO Anomaly Data\n\n(10)\t\n\nORK4TNAI, PAGE Is\nOF POOR QUAL11-\n\nx^\n\nAverage maps can be misleading because the average satellite altitVie is\nty\n,here the same.

This is illustrated in Figure 8 which shows\nhow resolution increases as altitude decreases. The anomaly map is\nfrom POGO data. The solid line shows a coimnon track location for OGO 4\nand Magsat. The scalar residual fields from the two spacecraft are\nshown on the right.

Analysis of the data is considerably more time consuming than for scalar data and no anomaly maps\nhave been prepared. Figure 9 shows one full orbit of data. The plots\nare of residuals to a thirteenth degree and order field model.\nAnomalous fields are clearly present in the scalar data at the top. In\nthe X and Y components, external fields are present as indicated by the\nfluctuating residuals near the poles. Two anomalies, however, are\nclearly present ir, the vector data. In the center of the plot at about\n5 . 100 north latitude is a low in scalar field and a corresponding low in\nthe X and Z components. This is the Bangui or Central African anomaly.\nJust to the north of Bangui, at about 60 O N latitude (at 4:42:39 UT) is\nanother low in scalar field with corresponding lows evident in the X and\nZ ct),mpotient, This anomaly is over nurthern Scandanavia.\nt\nFor goologi d studies such anomaly maps must be inverted to a description\nof tile magnetic properties of the crustal rocks. Such inversions are\nnot unique; constraints from other data sources will be required in\ntheir interpretation. As a \'First step in such modeling, traditional\nequivalent source methods, adapted for the case of a spherical earth\nwith changing field incAination, have been applied to the United\nStates 17 and Australia l .

A11 of the\nanomalous field is assumed to be zero. The results for the United\nStates are shown in Figure 10. In many regions known geologic features\nare clearly outlined (e.g., the Basin and Range Province, Colorado\nPlaleau, Rio Grande Rift, Michigan Basin, and Mississippi Embayment)\nwhereas some features are notable by the absence of magnetic features\n(e.g., the mid-continent gravity high). It will be some years before\nthese maps are fully understood and interpreted, but they promise to\nshed new light on the geology of the deep crust.\nAnomaly maps, or even magnetization maps, are not an end in themselves.\nThe object of these efforts is to derive models of the crust and upper\nmantle for large-scale regions of the globe. There are many kinds of\nmodels; their common purpose is to generalize observations and prediction. Through synthesis of particular models, complex models of\ncrustal geologic systems are built up in terms of structural and compositional variations and the movements of material and energy. Conclusions can then be drawn about the evolution of regions that lead to\ninferences about the distribution of natural resources.\n\n(13)\n\nMAGSAT LATITUDE PLOT\nNOVEMBER 5, 1879\n50.0\nco\n\nQ\nw\nO\n\n0.0\ni\t\n\na\n\n50.0\n100,0\nX\t\n\n50.0\n\nIs\n\nI\n\n0.0\nt\n\nw\n\n-50.0\n\xe2\x80\xa2100.0\nzuu.0\n\nQ\nw\n0\t\n\n150.0\n100.0\n50.0\n0,0\n\xe2\x80\xa2504\n.ton n\nnu.0\n\nN\nJ\t\nW\n\n0.0\n\nO\n\n500\nLAT 0. 00\t\nTIME\t\nLONG\t\nALT\t\n\n60 . 00\t\n42750\t\n169.8\t\n395.8\t\n\n6000\t\n44239\t\n30.3\t\n355.6\t\n\n0.00\t\n45815\t\n14.5\t\n425.5\t\n\n^0 00\t\n51407\t\n\xe2\x80\xa21.7\t\n534.0\t\n\n-60 0(1\t\n52943\t\n161.5\t\n575.5\t\n\n0.00\n54550\n-177.3\n508.7\n\nFig. 9 Magnitude and Component Data from Magsat after Removal of Field\nFrnm i Snh p rir;;l HArmnnir_ Mndel\n\nFig. 10 Equivalent Bulk Magnetization from POGO Data Assuming a\nConstant-Thickness Magnetic Crust of 40 km.

Information about the inner earth must be\nobtained by indirect methods such as seismology and measurements of the\ngravity and magnetic fields.\nCombining Magsat data with POGO and near-surface surveys will permit\nmore accurate determination of the secular variation of the core field.\nThis variation will be used to study properties of the fluid motions\nin that core; in turn, appropriate magnetohydrodynamic constraints will\nbe investigated to determine if they can aid in better modeling the\nsecular variation.\nWhen they are time-varying, magnetospheric fields result in induced\nfields within the earth because of the finite conductivity of the earth.\nThe characteristics of these induced fields are determined by the properties of the materials in the earth\'s mantle (i.e., composition,\ntemperature). At present the limiting factor in determining a precise\nconductivity profile within the earth, with adequate spatial resolution,\nis the accuracy possible in determining the external and induced fields.\nMagsat vector measurements, together with surface data will be used for\na more accurate analysis than was previously possible.\nT.\n\nCONCLUSION r.\n\nSatellite-based magnetic field measurements make global surveys practical for both field modeling and for the mapping of large-scale crustal\nanomalies. They are the only practical method of accurately modeling\nthe global secular variation. Magsat is providing a significant contribution, both because of the timeliness of the survey and because its\nvector measurement capability represents an advance in the technology\nof such measurements.\nData from Magsat is available for any interested user through the\n"National Space Sciences Data Center at GSFC.\nWith the success of Magsat, future missions should take two courses.\nField modeling requires periodic surveys, but not low-altitude measurements as required for crustal studies. On the other hand, further\nadvances in satellite crustal studies will rest on NASA\'s ability to\norbit magnetometers at still lower altitudes, concepts for which are\nstill in \'the state of discussions as to their feasibility.\n\n(15)\n\nACKNOWUDGEMENTS\n-1-- ---- -I wish to thank all members of the Magsat team for making possible the\n\nacquisition and Analysis of these data.
