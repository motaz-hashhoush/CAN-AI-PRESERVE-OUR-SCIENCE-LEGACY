To date four large Wolter I grazing incidence x-ray optical shells have been electroformed from nickel. The mirrors were fabricated utilizing each of two nickel alloy plated aluminum substrates twice. A wide variety of testing has been completed by NASA MSFC and UAH. This testing includes heat treatment control tests, subscale plating and fixture testing, alloy control of the electroless nickel, adhesion and release testing of the gold to electroless nickel, electroforming instrumentation and software and fabrication of subscale models. The full scale shells are one millimeter thick nickel electrodeposited over a thin gold layer which in turn has the optical surface on the inside. The optical surface is the replicate of the surface prepared on the substrate. Appendix I briefly outlines the fabrication process. Major objectives which were shared by UAH and MSFC include the design of facilities, equipment and tooling and procurement of materials and equipment. Process development followed with the fabrication of small scale pilot units. Procurement commenced immediately and equipment and materials were ordered to implement the fabrication of first surface full scale substrates (mandrels) and the second surface electroformed optical components. All principal objectives have been achieved. Inspection of the mirrors in visible and x-ray modes validates that the required performance and the quality can be achieved by an electroforming replication process. A very distinct progressive improvement has been achieved with each of the four mirrors produced. The final mirror exceeded the original goals and set an improved standard for flight hardware. The future goal of a 30 arc second resolution at 8 KEV x-ray appears to be achievable by this process when proper cleanliness and process control is utilized.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940020192, "id": "8c71150b65df42eeb97d6abed151dccb", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940020192.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940020192/downloads/19940020192.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940020192/downloads/19940020192.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940020192/downloads/19940020192.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
