The feasibility of such monitoring was demonstrated by the Tiros 2 satellite in 1961. Nimbus 1 showed that breaks in the sea ice can be easily monitored during continuous nighttime conditions; Nimbus 3 showed the practicality of delineating regions of active melting of ice and snow in temperate areas. Landsat data have been found to be particularly useful for monitoring and studying glaciers and their attendant surface features. Ice concentration can be determined with reasonable accuracy from a sequence of electronically scanned microwave radiomenter images made aboard Nimbus 5. In the future we can expect improved sensors and spacecraft systems with longer operating lives.", "title": "Ice reconnaissance by satellite", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T15:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760055141, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gloersen, P."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, Md., United States"}}, "id": "5997523d8d5040cc8125d6ca4591ae5f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19760055141, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Strome, W.
