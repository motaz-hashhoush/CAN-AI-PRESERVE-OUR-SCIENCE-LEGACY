To satisfy legacy issues, blends to 50% alternate fuel with petroleum fuels are certified\nindividually on the basis of processing and assumed to be feedstock agnostic. Adherence to alternate fuels\nand fuel blends requires \xe2\x80\x9csmart fueling systems\xe2\x80\x9d or advanced fuel-flexible systems, including combustors\nand engines, without significant sacrifice in performance or emissions requirements. This paper provides\npreliminary performance (Part A) and emissions and particulates (Part B) combustor sector data. The data\nare for nominal inlet conditions at 225 psia and 800 \xef\x82\xb0F (1.551 MPa and 700 K), for synthetic-paraffinickerosene- (SPK-) type (Fisher-Tropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP-8+100 relative to JP-8+100 as\nbaseline fueling. Assessments are made of the change in combustor efficiency, wall temperatures,\nemissions, and luminosity with SPK of 0%, 50%, and 100% fueling composition at 3% combustor\npressure drop. The performance results (Part A) indicate no quantifiable differences in combustor\nefficiency, a general trend to lower liner and higher core flow temperatures with increased FT fuel\nblends. In general, emissions data (Part B) show little differences, but with percent increase in FT-SPKtype fueling, particulate emissions and wall temperatures are less than with baseline JP-8. High-speed\nphotography illustrates both luminosity and combustor dynamic flame characteristics.\n\nIntroduction\nSynthetic and biomass fueling are now considered as near-term aviation alternate fueling. The major\nimpediment is a secure sustainable supply of these fuels at reasonable cost. Alternate aviation fuels are\ncurrently required to satisfy MIL-DTL-83133F (2008) for Fisher-Tropsch- (FT-) equivalent processed\nASTM D 7566 (2010) and known as \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel replacements (military and civil, respectively). As in\naviation, many land-based and marine power generation systems are elderly, known as the legacy issue.\nFueling these systems requires careful compliance to the fuel handling and engine systems for which they\nwere (are) designed. To satisfy a sustainable fuel supply, it will be necessary to accept fuels derived from\na variety of feedstocks. Consequently, adherence to alternate fuels and fuel blends requires \xe2\x80\x9csmart fueling\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n1\n\nsystems\xe2\x80\x9d or advanced fuel-flexible systems, including combustors and engines, without significant\nsacrifice in performance or emissions requirements. \xc2\xa0\nThe common military services fueling concept is that JP-8+100 or alternate FT-type fuels that can\nfuel gas turbines as well as many diesel systems. Diesel biomass-derived oils are often unsuitable because\nsufficient aromatics and sulfur are lacking, which provide lubricity, thus reducing design component life.\nTo counter these issues, additives are promoted. \xc2\xa0\nThis paper provides preliminary performance, luminosity, emissions, and particulates combustor\nsector data relative to JP-8+100 as baseline fueling, for synthetic-parafinic-kerosene- (SPK-) type fuel\nblends (herein FT-type fuel) and projections for testing of biofuel fuel blends leading to preliminary\ndevelopment of smart fueling (fuel flexible) and combustor systems for the next generation aeronautic\nand aeronautic-derivative gas turbine engines. Fuel flexibility is an engine operations goal to enable\nvarious designer fuels operations with minor alterations in controller function or geometry.\nTruly performance and emissions are coupled issues; however, combustor performance will be\npresented in Part A and combustor emissions as Part B for understanding both in sufficient detail.\nHerein, fueling acronyms are synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), and hydro-treated renewable jet (HRJ)\nalso known as bio-SPK or SPK-HEFA (SPK from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) and proposed as\nASTM D7566-Annex-1.\n\nPart A: Combustor Performance\nPart A presents fueling characteristics, facility development, and operation followed by thermal\nperformance of the combustor and combustor visualization. The results are for one of several\ncombustors\xe2\x80\x94herein denoted as combustor A\xe2\x80\x94to be evaluated in development of fuel-flexible engine\ncombustors.\nMost data herein are testing at nominal inlet conditions of 225 psia and 800 \xef\x82\xb0F (1.55 MPa, 700 K) at\n3% combustor pressure drop, where JP-8+100 (JP-8) is taken as baseline. Selected emissions data are\nprovided at and below 225 psia (1.55 MPa).\n\nFuel Characteristics\nIn general all alternate fueling is required to meet or exceed MIL-DTL-83133F or ASTM D7566 and\nAnnex 1 requirements. The carbon-distribution for each fuel used and primary characteristics differ\ndepending on feedstock source and distilling practices, yet all fall within specification. Typical Cdistributions for JP-8 and an (SPK) FT-derived fuel are shown in Figure 1(a) with vendor variations in\nfuels illustrated in Figure 1(b). Secondary refining of petroleum-based kerosene fuels can also satisfy\nspecifications.\nThe specifications for one of the fuels, AFRL No. 5172 Shell GTL-SPK (FT), are presented in\nAppendix A.\nWhile fuels purchased by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) are within specification,\nindependent of whether petroleum- or alternate-based fuels, batch-to-batch variations do occur depending\non processors, feedstock, ;production date and location of fuel production: a world-wide fuels sourcing\nproblem.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n2\n\nFigure 1(a).\xe2\x80\x94R\nF\nRepresentative carbon distribu\nutions for JP-8 and AFRL\n8\nNo. 5172 FT (SPK) from Shell gas-to-liqu (GTL) with 0 aromatics\nT\nuid\n0%\nand 0% sulfu The JP-8 cit is 19% aro matics and 120 ppm sulfur.\nur.\nted\n00\n\nFigure 1(b).\xe2\x80\x94 Variations in re\nF\nV\nepresentative c\ncarbon distribut\ntions for\nproposed alt\nternate fuels wi high and low n-paraffinic t isomer ratios\nith\nw\nto\ns.\n\nCombu\nustor and Facility Characteris\nF\nstics\nThe general descrip\ng\nption of the combustor and supporting r\nc\nd\nresearch cell data are simil to those\nlar\nreported in Hendricks et al. (Ref. 1). The particu aspects of the geometr tested are p\ne\nular\nf\nry\nproprietary an\nnd\nwill not be discussed herein. Details of the High Pressure Com\nh\ns\nmbustion Rese\nearch Facility at the Air Fo\ny\norce\nResearch Laboratory (A\nAFRL) are pr\nrovided by Sh\nhouse et al. (R 2).\nRef.\nAltho\nough some gen\nneral aspects of the fuel de\nelivery system and operatio of the fac\nm\nons\ncility are similar to\nthose of References 1 and 2, specific facility mod\nR\na\ndifications an increased c\nnd\ncapability to h\nhandle fuel\nblending had to be mad including remote altern test fuel s\nh\nde,\nnate\nstorage/tanka and delive of the alte\nage\nery\nernate\ntest fuel to the facility fuel pumps, flow meters, and control sy\no\nf\na\nystems (see A\nAppendix B).\n\nNASA/TM\nM\xe2\x80\x942012-21712\n28\n\n3\n\nFacility Development\nBefore validation data could be taken, it was necessary to learn what it takes to conduct high-pressure\ncombustor testing of alternate fuels such as FT and biomass feedstock fuels. It is first necessary to\nestablish the combustion parameters required by the study such as operability, performance, durability\ntime-dependent measurements such as flame studies, and others. Next, an assessment of the effects of\npressure ratios and inlet temperatures on both the combustor sector model and desired data was\nundertaken as well as most importantly, how to safely blend the fuels. The blending system, while\ncomplex, enables operations to establish and stabilize combustor inlet pressures and temperatures of\npreheated air at the required test condition without the additional complication of simultaneously\nestablishing fuel blend.\nTo establish the fuel delivery system, questions such as how much fuel and time are required to fully\nevaluate a typical fuel candidate must be resolved. A 500-gal trailer-mounted fuel tank was chosen for\nporting alternative fuels with the added feature of coupling to the facility fueling system. The facility has\ntwo duplicate fuel systems that provided a means of handling JP-8 fuel with one system to pump, meter,\nand control the JP-8 fuel; this system is referred to as the main fuel delivery system. The identical system\nwas fed the alternative fuel supply, which is pumped from the trailer into the facility primary fuel system\nand ultimately blended online with the main fuel system to provide the desired fuel blend from 0% to\n100% trailer fuel. An analysis of fuel blending errors is provided in Appendix C. To verify the 50/50\nblend, samples were collected just upstream of the fuel injectors and analyzed using liquid\nchromatography; blending is within \xc2\xb14%.\n\nTest Parameters and Data Collection\nFor this series of testing, the nominal test conditions for pressures and temperatures of blends and the\nextensive data collection systems have been established. The parameters were chosen to be most\nrepresentative of engine operations envelope from idle to altitude cruise; however, TO (take-off) pressures\nare currently beyond the range of this facility.\nCombustor parameters\nInlet pressures (P): 75, 125, 175, and 225 psia (0.517, 0.862, 1.207, and 1.551 MPa)\nInlet temperature (T): 500, 625, 725, and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (533, 603, 658, and 694 K)\nCombustor pressure drops (\xce\x94P): 3%, 4%, and 5%\nFuel blends: 100% JP-8, 50:50 JP-8:FT, and 100% FT\nData collection\nGaseous emissions\nExit temperature rake type B thermocouples, (also for metal and sidewall temperatures)\nPhoto diode output (voltage)\nStill and high-speed photography\nSmoke and particulate emissions\nCombustor outer and inner liner temperature data are given in Appendix D, and estimates of errors in\nperformance, flame temperature, emissions data, and geometric coordinates are given in Appendix C.\n\nCombustor Thermal Performance\nThe combustion efficiencies for combinations of fuel:air ratio F/A and fuel compositions were of the\norder of 99.9% (Table 1), and one is unable to distinguish combustor changes from this single parameter;\nthus, other parameters will be investigated.

Sidewall temperature TSWFD ranges are 5.6% , 2.1%, and 1.4% higher for FT fueling for\nF/A = 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02, respectively. This may relate to the flame front moving away from\nthe fuel injection interface.\n4. Rake temperatures show core flow generally higher with FT than with JP-8, but one rake\nthermocouple (TC) was lost during testing, which inhibits conclusiveness.\n5. All temperatures increase with F/A.\n6. The 50:50 blend test results generally are between JP-8 and FT and somewhat closer to FT.\n7. Lean blow out (LBO) and ignition (IGN) tests were not part of the planned test program, yet\nobservations made during startup and shutdown procedures were consistent with previous\nJP-8+100 testing. For a limited data set at a nominal 5% combustor pressure drop, the F/A\nfor LBO is nearly 40% of the IGN F/A for both 100% FT and JP-8+100. On the average,\n(F/A) LBO 100% FT /(F/A) LBO JP-8+100 < 1, with some sensitivity to percent combustor pressure\ndrop, and (F/A) IGN 100% FT /(F/A) IGN JP-8+100 < 1. Definitive values at lower percent combustor\npressure drops are insufficient for conclusions.\n8. Altitude relight, ignition and LBO testing programs remain to be carried out.\n9. High-speed photographs of the combustion process provide some insights for CFD analysts as\nwell as heuristic information for combustor designers. For example, there was decreased\nluminosity with FT versus JP-8, and clips show enhanced vorticity for the conditions cited in\nTable 1.\n\nPart B: Combustor Emissions\nPart B presents gaseous emissions as CO2, CO, and NOx (which also includes smoke and luminosity\ndata); particulate emissions including distribution; and a brief comparison to small and large engine\ntesting results from other programs. The emissions data are taken for the same tests and test conditions\ncited in Part A, nominally 225 psia at 800 \xef\x82\xb0F (1.551 MPa at 700 K) with the sampling probe located at\nthe nozzle exit plane. Emissions have a direct impact on aviation climatic constraints based on life cycle\nanalysis (LCA) of fueling feedstocks, which includes fueling development and engine emissions. Herein\nthe testing is directed toward fuel flex engine combustors, providing basic data for LCA fueling\nevaluations, where combustor A is one of several to be evaluated in development of fuel-flexible engine\ncombustors.\n\nGaseous Emissions\nMeasurements for NOx were determined from combining NO and NO2 measurements (Figs. 11(a)\nand (b). Nitric oxide (NO) with molecular atomic dimension (0.115 nm) (NO), while less than JP-8 at\nF/A = 0.010, steadily increases to become marginally higher than JP-8 at F/A = 0.020 (extrapolated)\n(Fig. 11(a)). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (0.221 nm) (ppm) for FT or 50:50 blended fueling is considerably\nhigher than for JP-8 and generally increases with F/A. Combining nitrogen dioxide (ppm) and nitric oxide\n(ppm), the trend with F/A and fuel composition is similar to that seen for NO; a slight decrease in NO2:\nless than JP-8 at F/A = 0.010 and marginally higher than JP-8 at F/A = 0.020 (Fig. 11(c)).\nRegarding the variation of %CO2 (0.0116 nm), ppm CO, and %O2, (Figs.12, 13, and 14, respectively),\nwhereas each is strongly dependent with increasing F/A, the increase in %CO2 and ppm CO and the\ndecrease in %O2 are marginally consistent with varied dependencies on fuel composition. The %CO2\nappears somewhat consistent with decreased %CO and O2 with fueling changes from JP-8 to FT, in\nagreement with flame temperature (Fig. 2).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n19\n\nFigu 11(b).\xe2\x80\x94Nitr\nure\nrogen dioxide e\nemission (ppm)\nva\nariations with F and fueling composition.\nF/A\n\nFigure 11(a).\xe2\x80\x94Nitric oxide emissio (ppm)\ne\nc\non\nvar\nriations with F/A and fueling composition.\nA\nc\n\nFigu 11(c).\xe2\x80\x94NO emission va riations (ppm)\nure\nOx\nwith F/A and fue\nw\neling compositiion.\n\nEINOx or KHN\nNOx] \xef\x82\xbb (ppm NOx) (1 + FAR)/(630 FA\nm\nF\nAR)].

For example, if most of\nthe particles are >10 nm in size, determination of EI values in the range of (1 to 100)\xef\x82\xb41014/kg fuel\nburned is to about 10% precision. Similarly, the \xe2\x80\x9capparent\xe2\x80\x9d black carbon (BC) EI of between 10 and\n1000 mg/(kg fuel burned) is also to about 10% precision. However, estimate of errors can be an order of\nmagnitude greater arising from the several factors such as (Ref. 8)\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nLack of instrument measurement specificity for black carbon(BC)\nLack of direct measurement approaches for BC mass\nLack of standards: BC characteristics vary widely between and within combustion sources\nSevere particulate losses within sampling lines (e.g., 50% to 70% in a 25-m line prior to the\ndiagnostic instruments)\n5. Interference from background particulates, which often comprise dust and other refractory\nparticles that do not evaporate in the combustor.\nComparisons of engine on-wing missions data (Ref. 8) and combustor-sector test data herein imply\n(but not conclude at this time) that sector test data replicate, at least qualitatively, on-wing test data,\nproviding both detail and insights not gained from on-wing testing, including particulate data. Post\nAAFEX 2010 Workshop data (Ref. 9) also show similar qualitative emissions trends for both gaseous and\nparticulate emissions with emissions results herein, yet elude quantitative comparisons for lack of\nmeasurement scales on many of the AAFEX reported emissions data plots.\nThere are qualitative differences in the emissions depending on SPK alternate fueling relative to both\nSPK and JP-8 fueling; however, quantitative values are not given and while these differences appear to be\nminor, but not insignificant, the actual values remain to be demonstrated. While this feedstock\ndependency of the fueling may not be large, it remains to be evaluated, which in turn affects the ASTM\nspecifications and the presumption of being feedstock agnostic.\nThe EPA (Ref. 10) provided logarithmically-transformed emissions index composites data sets for\nthree turbofan engines with selected fueling types similar to those used for AAFEX. These data show\nsignificant changes with engine and fuel type. Sixty-four semivolatile organic compounds (n-alkanes and\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured (Ref. 10). The coupled concerns over engine\nand fuel type may delay FT fueling certification or prompt regulation.\nIt should also be noted that current aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs) (2011) have significantly\nhigher black carbon emissions than on-wing engines (Ref. 8).\n\nConclusions: Part B\nAlternate fueling testing is being carried out to determine preliminary performance, emissions, and\nparticulates combustor sector data relative to JP-8+100 as baseline fueling, for SPK-type (e.g., FischerTropsch, FT) fuels blends and projections for testing of biofuel fuel blends leading to preliminary\ndevelopment of smart fueling (fuel flexible) and combustor systems for the next generation aeronautic\nand aeronautic-derivative gas turbine engines. Herein alternate fueling test results for a well characterized\nbut proprietary combustor are provided for JP-8+100, a FT-derived fuel, and a blend of 50% each by\nvolume.\nThe test data presented are part of a more extensive data set where combustion parameters were\nvaried over a range of values. The data herein are for the case of nominal inlet conditions at 75 psia\n(0.517 MPa) to 225 psia (1.551 MPa) and 800 \xef\x82\xb0F (700 K), and JP-8+100 is taken as the baseline.\nThe 50:50 blend test performance and emissions results generally are between JP and FT and\nsomewhat closer to FT\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n31\n\nEmissions: CO is lower with FT; CO2 is about the same; NO is lower with FT; NO2 is higher with FT\nfueling F/A; NOx is lower to higher with FT with F/A; O2 decreases with F/A (consistent with\ntemperature increase), is lower with FT with increased spread from JP-8 with F/A, again consistent with\nrake temperature; HC generally decreases with F/A, yet FT humps at 0.015. No explanation is provided.\nBasic emissions show more change with F/A than with JP-8 or FT; the latter being the more\nsignificant. These results appear to agree qualitatively to on-wing engine testing. Quantitative agreement\nrequires resolution pending data release. The other aspect is to look at how emissions change with\npressure and EXTRAPOLATE those results to core pressure on the ground, that is, at much higher\npressures.\nThese comparisons and test data presented herein imply\xe2\x80\x94yet at this time cannot conclude\xe2\x80\x94that\nsector test data replicate, at least qualitatively, on-wing test data, providing both detail and insights not\ngained from on-wing tests. Post AAFEX 2010 Workshop analysis of released data and data herein is\nwarranted.\nComparisons of engine on-wing test data (Ref. 8) and combustor-sector test data herein imply (but\nnot conclude at this time) replicate, at least qualitatively, on-wing test data, for both gaseous emissions\nand particulate results, providing both detail and insights not gained from on-wing tests. Post AAFEX\n2010 Workshop data (Ref. 9) also show similar qualitative emissions trends with results herein, yet elude\nquantitative comparisons for lack of scales on many of the AAFEX reported data.\nSPK and JP-8 emissions profiles are qualitatively similar, yet there are observable differences in the\nemissions depending on alternate fueling feedstock and engine type, however quantitative AAFEX values\nare not provided and remain to be demonstrated. This feedstock dependency makes it more difficult for\nASTM to certify as fuel feedstock agnostic and may require conformity to more strict ASTM fuel\nrequirements?\nIt should also be noted that current aircraft APU\xe2\x80\x99s (2011) have significantly higher black carbon\nemissions than on-wing engines (Ref. 8).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n32\n\nAppendix A.\xe2\x80\x94Fuel Specifications\nTABLE A\xe2\x80\x931.\xe2\x80\x94FUEL SPECIFICATIONS FOR FT FUEL,\nAFRL NO. 5172-6: LAB REPORT 2007LA06946001\nMethod\nTest\nASTM D 3242\xe2\x80\x9305\nTotal acid number (mg KOH/g)\nASTM D 1319\xe2\x80\x9305\nAromatics (% vol)\nASTM D 3227\xe2\x80\x9304a\nMercaptan sulfur (% mass)\nASTM D 4294\xe2\x80\x9303\nTotal sulfur (% mass)\nASTM D 86\xe2\x80\x9307a\nDistillation\nInitial boiling point (\xef\x82\xb0C)\n10% recovered (\xef\x82\xb0C)\n20% recovered (\xef\x82\xb0C)\n50% recovered (\xef\x82\xb0C)\n90% recovered (\xef\x82\xb0C)\nEnd point (\xef\x82\xb0C)\nResidue (% vol)\nLoss (% vol)\nASTM D 93\xe2\x80\x9307\nFlash point (\xef\x82\xb0C)\nASTM D 4052\xe2\x80\x9396\nAPI gravity @ 60 \xef\x82\xb0F\nASTM D 5972\xe2\x80\x9305\nFreezing point (\xef\x82\xb0C)\nASTM D 445\xe2\x80\x9306\nViscosity @ \xe2\x80\x9320 \xef\x82\xb0C (mm2/s)\nASTM D 3338\xe2\x80\x9305\nNet heat of combustion (MJ/kg)\nASTM D 3343\xe2\x80\x9305\nHydrogen content (% mass)\nASTM D 1322\xe2\x80\x9397\nSmoke point (mm)\nASTM D 130\xe2\x80\x9304\nCopper strip corrosion (2h @ 100 \xef\x82\xb0C)\nASTM D 3241\xe2\x80\x9306\nThermal stability @ 260 \xef\x82\xb0C\nChange in pressure (mmHg)\nTube deposit rating, visual\nASTM D 381\xe2\x80\x9304\nExistent gum (mg/100 mL)\nASTM D 5452\xe2\x80\x9306\nParticulate matter (mg/L)\nMIL\xe2\x80\x93DTL\xe2\x80\x9383133E\nFiltration time (min)\nASTM D 1094\xe2\x80\x9300\nWater reaction interface rating\nASTM D 5006\xe2\x80\x9303\nFSII (% vol)\nASTM D 2624\xe2\x80\x9307\nConductivity (pS/m)\nASTM D 5001\xe2\x80\x9306\nLubricity test (BOCLE) wear scar (mm)\nASTM D 4809\xe2\x80\x9306\nNet heat of combustion (MJ/kg)\nMIL\xe2\x80\x93DTL\xe2\x80\x9383133E\nWorkmanship\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n33\n\nResult\n0.002\n0.0\n0.000\n0.00\n148\n162\n163\n169\n185\n198\n0.9\n1.1\n44\n60.5\n\xe2\x80\x9354\n2.6\n44.2\n15.6\n40.0\n1a\n0\n1\n<1\n0.5\n3\n1\n0.00\n233\n0.77\n44.2\nPass\n\nTABLE A\xe2\x80\x932.\xe2\x80\x94FUEL SPECIFICATIONS FOR\nAFRL NO.

The emissions analyzers are calibrated prior to every\nday-to-day test using certified (2%) gas concentrations. The relative error is considered representative data\n(across industry), when it is between 10% and 15% (10% for engines above idle and 15% at idle). Herein the\nuncertainty in the measured raw emissions data is considered 3%, accurate to the 2% certified gas calibrations\nand accounting for the combined propagated error for the analyzer specifications: 1% full-scale reading. With\nmultiple calibration gases the analyzers are accurate with the standard gas, repeatable (precise), such that the\nrelative error in the carbon balance is considered accurate to 3%.\nNote 3: The calculated flame temperature is a thermodynamic energy balance between reactants and products,\nutilizing emissions data (efficiency) and experimental operating conditions; it is consistent with temperatures\ndetermined from thermocouple rakes (based on multiple experiments, to within \xc2\xb110 \xc2\xb0F (\xc2\xb15.6 \xc2\xb0C)), which\nreinforces the cited 0.5% error full scale. However, the calculated flame temperature can be no better than 3%\nbecause it is based on efficiency, as calculated from SAE ARP 1533 [11].\nEstimates of error for on-wing data\ngaseous emissions \xc2\xb15 % or better\nBlack Carbon (BC) number or mass \xc2\xb16 % or better\nParticulates measurement variations [not repeatability ( precision) error bands] can be large as there are\nno convenient methods for calibrating instruments. Nanoparticulates are lost on rake placement, probe\ninlets, transport tubing walls and vary by species (Ref. 8), with estimate of error:\nEI Number [200% (dirty engine (APU) and 100% (clean engine)]\nEI mass 50% to 100%\nError of estimate for fuel blend\nIn an analysis to verify fuel blending, samples of the 50/50 blended fuel were collected just upstream\nof the fuel injectors. The FT fuel used to make the JP-8+100/FT blend contained no aromatics (<0.2\nvolume %), so analysis of aromatic hydrocarbon content was used to determine the ratio of JP-8+100 in\nthe JP-8+100/FT blend. The analysis was performed using ASTM D6379. In this method, normal-phase\nhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with refractive index detection was used. The aromatics\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n37\n\nwere eluted from a cyano column (4.6 \xef\x82\xb4 150 cm) with hexanes as the mobile phase. Standards containing\nmono-aromatics and di-aromatics were used to calibrate the HPLC (Agilent Model 1100). Both standards\nand samples were diluted to the same level (1:50) in hexanes before injection into the HPLC. The\nrefractive index peak areas were used to quantify the mono-aromatics and di-aromatics concentrations.\nThese were summed to yield the total aromatics content in the fuels in volume percent. The JP-8+100 fuel\nsample contained 17.3 volume % aromatics and the JP-8+100/FT blend sample contained 8.3 volume %\naromatics. Thus, the ratio of JP-8+100 in the blend was 8.3/17.3 or 0.48, or 48% JP-8+100 and 52% FT to\nwithin 4%.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217128\n\n38\n\nAppendix D.\xe2\x80\x94Combustor Thermal Data and

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nAlternate aviation fuels for military or commercial use are required to satisfy MIL-DTL-83133F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 (2010) standards,\nrespectively, and are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel replacements. To satisfy legacy issues, blends to 50% alternate fuel with petroleum fuels\nare certified individually on the basis of processing and assumed to be feedstock agnostic. Adherence to alternate fuels and fuel blends\nrequires \xe2\x80\x9csmart fueling systems\xe2\x80\x9d or advanced fuel-flexible systems, including combustors and engines, without significant sacrifice in\nperformance or emissions requirements. This paper provides preliminary performance (Part A) and emissions and particulates (Part B)\ncombustor sector data. The data are for nominal inlet conditions at 225 psia and 800 \xc2\xb0F (1.551 MPa and 700 K), for synthetic-paraffinickerosene- (SPK-) type (Fisher-Tropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP-8+100 relative to JP-8+100 as baseline fueling. Assessments are made\nof the change in combustor efficiency, wall temperatures, emissions, and luminosity with SPK of 0%, 50%, and 100% fueling composition\nat 3% combustor pressure drop. The performance results (Part A) indicate no quantifiable differences in combustor efficiency, a general\ntrend to lower liner and higher core flow temperatures with increased FT fuel blends. In general, emissions data (Part B) show little\ndifferences, but with percent increase in FT-SPK-type fueling, particulate emissions and wall temperatures are less than with baseline JP-8.\nHigh-speed photography illustrates both luminosity and combustor dynamic flame characteristics.\n15.
