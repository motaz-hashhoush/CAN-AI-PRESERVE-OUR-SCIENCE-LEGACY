One of the challenges of developing such technologies is terrestrial testing with lunar dust simulants. Dust has a stochastic nature of depositing and it can be difficult to accurately apply it to surfaces of interest. Deposition density, particles size distribution, and percent coverage are all factors that affect the quality of dust mitigation testing. Therefore, to enable such testing the dust mitigation and seals teams at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) have developed a system  that  can  uniformly  and  repeatably  deposit  lunar  simulants  on  a  range  of surfaces.  Testing  of  the  Dust  Deposition  System  (DDS)  and  an  associatedsimulant preparation methodology have quantified the levels of uniformity and precision for this system.   Furthermore,   the   deposition   system   has   been   paired   with   automated micrograph capturing and machine learning image analysis to correlate the images of dust on a surface to deposition density (in g/cm2). This correlation alleviates the need for  tested  samples  to  be  accurately  weighed  with  milligram  precision  and  may  be  a useful  tool  for  in-situ  contamination  evaluation  on  the  Moon.  This  paper  covers  the design and validation testing for the DDS.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210025178, "endDate": "2022-04-23T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "6457a6ab23c95056a4fd2df12a5908a5", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Civil Engineers", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "232fd362391b4d338fa62a2cfaf5847c", "id": "925949b280074c0baa0272a088919fef"}], "name": "ASCE - Earth and Space Conference", "location": "Virtual", "id": "232fd362391b4d338fa62a2cfaf5847c", "url": "https://www.earthspaceconference.org/", "startDate": "2022-04-19T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Uniform Dust Deposition System for Dust Tolerance Studies - ASCE Earth and Space 2022 - SUBMITTED.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210025178/downloads/Uniform%20Dust%20Deposition%20System%20for%20Dust%20Tolerance%20Studies%20-%20ASCE%20Earth%20and%20Space%202022%20-%20SUBMITTED.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210025178/downloads/Uniform%20Dust%20Deposition%20System%20for%20Dust%20Tolerance%20Studies%20-%20ASCE%20Earth%20and%20Space%202022%20-%20SUBMITTED.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210025178/downloads/Uniform%20Dust%20Deposition%20System%20for%20Dust%20Tolerance%20Studies%20-%20ASCE%20Earth%20and%20Space%202022%20-%20SUBMITTED.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
