MAP incorporates two modified Lockheed Martin AST-201 (Autonomous Star Tracker) star trackers. The AST-201 employs an eight element radiation hardened lens assembly which is used to focus an image on a charge coupled device (CCD). The CCD image is then processed by a star identification algorithm which outputs a three-axis attitude. A CCD-shift algorithm called Time Delayed Integration (TDI) was also included in each star tracker. In order to provide some radiation effect filtering during MAP's three to five phasing loop passes through the Van Allen radiation belts, a simple pixel filtering scheme was implemented, rather than using a more complex, but more robust windowing algorithm. The trackers also include a fiber optic data interface. This paper details the ground testing that was accomplished on the MAP trackers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020060504, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "61fbc92f3e644cfe829b68a4bfe41d88", "id": "00ff47f6624045cab0923d55f4b2862d"}], "name": "AIAA Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Monterey, CA", "id": "61fbc92f3e644cfe829b68a4bfe41d88", "startDate": "2002-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020060504, "id": "f286f79a6e344c03ae863d85be1313ed", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020060504.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020060504/downloads/20020060504.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020060504/downloads/20020060504.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020060504/downloads/20020060504.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
