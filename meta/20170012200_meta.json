Stennis Space Center (SSC) to develop the INSIGHT program, which will autonomously monitor and control the Nitrogen System of the High Pressure Gas Facility (HPGF) on site. The INSIGHT program is in need of generic timing capabilities in order to perform timing based actions such as pump usage timing and sequence step timing. The purpose of this project was to develop a timing module that could fulfill these requirements and be adaptable for expanded use in the future. The code was written in Gensym G2 software platform, the same as INSIGHT, and was written generically to ensure compatibility with any G2 program. Currently, the module has two timing capabilities, a stopwatch function and a countdown function. Although the module has gone through some functionality testing, actual integration of the module into NPAS and the INSIGHT program is contingent on the module passing later checks.", "title": "Work Experience Report", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2017-12-15T12:44:28.0400000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20170012200, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Guo, Daniel"}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M System Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "8d2aa3ad8f264fafa0d0889348d47ae4"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20170012200, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170012200, "id": "d15caeeffdea404bb65cf67ee7d10b37", "publicationDate": "2017-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170012200.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170012200/downloads/20170012200.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170012200/downloads/20170012200.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170012200/downloads/20170012200.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
