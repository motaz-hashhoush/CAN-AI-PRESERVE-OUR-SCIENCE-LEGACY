I n addition several other drawbacks e x i a t . This m e t h o d is expensive in t h a t t h e\nl i f e support systems (EVA s u i t ) a r e expensive t o r a i n t a i n w i t h costs e s t b a t e d t o be S00.900\nper EVA hour.\nAlso when comparing t h e timo t o peirform task. during EVA t o normal a c t i v i t i e s\non t h e ground it can take up t o e i q h t times a s long t o perform t h e s m task.\na e\nAdditional\nti# rust be spent i n pre and post EVA a c t i v i t i e s .\nW i t h these f a c t s i n r i n d it would\nthus\nbe important f o r the astronaut t o r e ~ h the sta\'ion unless absolutely required to\nin\nleave.\nEVA\n\nZVA\nIVA allows the astronaut t o remain i n the s t a t i o n and perfom tasks outside using a\nruote\ntaleoperated Banipulator.\nPresently tu0 systems the Flight Telerobitic Servicer (FE) and\nthe nobile Service Center ( W C ) have been i d e n t i f i e d to d o this.

Because the robot is local to the subsystem, it could aid in the diagnosis\nof the failure through subsystar testing.\nIf the immediate cause of the failure cannot ba\nidentified, or narrowed to a particular,ORU the robot would be available to do OR0 swappifig to\nd e t e d n e which component had failed.\nASSEXBLY\n\nWell defined assembly tasks such as first tire insertion of O l 7 5 into the subsystems could be\nR.\'\naccomplished us*\nthe robots. With proper considerations given component design such as a\nCommon interface and methods of l?cking the component into place on the structure the robot\ncsuld perfor8 m r complicated assembly operations.\noe\nThese s w techniques would be useful in\nreducing the complexity and time required to do assembly using EVA or IVA.\nUsing Nltiple\nrobots in the individual subsystems would allow simultaneous operations to proceed.\n\nINSPECTION\nIf it is determined +kat the cause of the failure is external to the ORU, the astronaut could\nuse the robots sensors and vision system to help identify the cause of the failure.\nThe\nastronaut would either program the robot to rake the repair or use the infornation obtained to\nhelp plan an EVA.\nPreventative inspections and service of the co8ponents in the subsystem\nwould help to predict and prevent catastrophic failures. These could be carried out on a\nregular bash without astronaut attention and be reported directly to the health Bonitoring\nsysteB.\nPG\nN\n\nA primary concern for use of robots would be the prograrring of the many and various task8.\nThis could be accomplished using graphic simulation and offline Pragrarrfng ( O W ) based on a\nCAD data base of the Space Station. The majority of t a m k . can k identified, p r o g r w , and\nsimulated prior to launch. n o s e programs would be stored and oxecuted as roquird during\noperation.\nHovever, many tasks would roquiro programring during flight.\nThis could k\naccomplished by ground crews using the O L P and simulation stations, and then uploaded to the\nstation for execution. The astronaut could perform tho sfiiulation (and prograBBing if\nnecessary) on board the Space Station to verify that tho task will be accomplished to hislher\nsatisfaction.\nm e OLP/sirulation system would be provided w i t h a usor friendly interface.\n\nSpecifying the particular subsystar in question would bring a simulated cell onto the display\nwith the robot and all components. By s h p l y indicating tho positions to 10ve to or the task\nco perform the program would be simulated and dawn loaded to the robot for execution.
