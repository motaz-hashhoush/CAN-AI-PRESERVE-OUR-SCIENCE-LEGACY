The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has two CTs that\nwere designed and built for the Apollo program in the 1960\'s, maintained and retrofitted for use in\nthe Space Shuttle program. As a key element of the Space Shuttle ground systems, the crawler\ntransports the entire 12-million-pound stack comprising the orbiter, the mobile launch platform\n(MLP), the external tank (ET), and the solid rocket boosters (SRB) from the Vehicle Assembly\nBuilding (VAB) to the launch pad. This rollout, constituting a 3.5-5.0-mile journey at a top speed of\n0.9 miles-per-hour, requires over 8 hours to reach either Launch Complex 39A or B. This activity is\nonly a prelude to the spectacle of sound and fury of the Space Shuttle launch to orbit in less than 10\nminutes and traveling at orbital velocities of Mach 24.\nThis paper summarizes preliminary results from the Crawler Transporter Sound Attenuation Study,\nencompassing test and engineering analysis of significant sound sources to measure and record full\nfrequency spectrum and intensity of the various noise sources and to analyze the conditions of\nvibration. Additionally, data such as ventilation criteria, plus operational procedures were considered\nto provide a comprehensive noise suppression design for implementation. To date, sound attenuation\nstudy and results on Crawler 2 have shown significant noise reductions ranging from 5 to 24 dBA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTechnological advances and spin-offs attributable to the United Space (US) space program have\ntransformed the way we live, work, and communicate around the world. However, one piece of the\nequipment that has virtually remained unchanged (lot of subsystem upgrades, but no major structural\nor vibraoacoustics modifications) over the last four decades is the CT. Designed for 100 miles of\nservice, each CT has amassed over 1700+ miles hauling Saturn V\'s, Saturn 1B\'s, and the Space\nShuttle, while being the quintessential workhorse of the US space program. The "mighty tortoise"\nhas been featured on Discovery channel [1]. In 1977, ASME named the Crawler Transporters, as the\n18th National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks [2]. In celebration of the fortieth\nanniversary of world\'s largest tracked land vehicles, this paper briefly outlines on-going sound\nattenuation study, planned modifications that are envisioned, and those partially implemented. The\ngoal is to enhance the reliability, availability, and maintainability of the CT for return to flight of the\nSpace Shuttle launch operations.\nSOUND ATTENUATION METHODOLOGY\nThe approach involved sound pressure level and sound intensity level measurements of the significant\nnoise sources on the Crawler Transporter. Sound intensity measurements were used to assist in\ndetermining the significance of noise sources located in multi-source noise environment. A\npreliminary assessment of CT noise sources and as-built issues such as the engine and generator sets\nexhausting to the underside of CT\'s superstructure; the engines radiators drawing cooling air inwards\ntowards the CT housing; the Jacking Equalization and Leveling System (TEL) system pumps, steering\nhydraulic system and super charger\' pumps that are rigidly mounted to the CT superstructure with\ntheir hydraulic lines crisscrossing under the CT and inducing noise into all areas of the CT, including\nthe Control Room and the Cabs; the ventilation cooling air exiting through louvered openings in the\nfloor of the Crawler Transporter Engine and Equipment House; and lastly, the noise sources\nsurrounding the movement of the trucks particularly the jacking and leveling system, the steering\nsystem, the truck propulsion motors, mchanical noise associated with the movement of the shoes\nover the bogies and sound of the crawler way . gravel being crushed.- Sound pressure level\nmeasurements were made (Table 1) of the existing noise sources that could be readily identified and\nisolated from other sources. Many of these sound pressure level measurements were completed in\nyear 2000, with the Crawler Transporter connected to shore power to assist in the isolation process.\nBased on the initial survey, a total of nine (9) separate noise mitigation recommendations were\ntargeted for an overall reduction in the Control Room noise level to 85 dBA or below, lowering the\noverall Engine/Pump room noise level by 5 dBA or better and reducing the overall noise level in the\ngeneral area under and around the CT by 8 to 10 dBA. Initial recommendations included an\nAcoustical isolation wall between the Control Room and the Engine/Pump Room, as well as\ninstalling acoustical vestibules and doors at the four Engine/Pump Room\'s door openings, installing\nabsorption panels on the Engine/Pump Room\'s ceiling and walls, isolating the JEL skid and piping\nfrom the CT\'s superstructure, providing in-line hydraulic silencers for the JEL systems, installing\ninlet acoustical fan forced ventilation hoods under the CT\'s floor on the existing louvered floor\nopenings, replacing wall inlet vent fans with acoustical fan forced exhaust ventilation hoods, and\nlastly replacing and isolating the engine muffler and exhaust systems from the CT\'s superstructure.\nInstrumentation\nSound level measurements of Crawler Transporter #2 were undertaken during the site visits on\nMay 12 - 13 and August 12 - 14, 2000. Sound pressure level measurements were undertaken on the\nfirst visit with the CT stationary and sound intensity and sound pressure level measurements were\nundertaken on the second visit during a shuttle roll-out. The sound pressure level measurements were\n\nconducted with a Bruel & Kjr Model 2260 Precision Real Time Sound Analyzer and a Brilel &\nKjr Model 4189 Microphone. These systems measure and record 1/3-octave band frequency\nsound pressure level spectra. The measurement system was field calibrated at the start of each series\nof measurements and checked upon completion using a Bruel & Kjan Model 4231 Sound Pressure\nLevel Calibrator. The sound intensity level measurements were conducted with two Bruel & Kjer\nModel 2260 Precision Real Time Sound Analyzers, each equipped with a Bruel & Kjer Model 4197\nMicrophone Pair mounted on a 2683 Sound Intensity Probe. These systems were used to measure\nand record 1/3 octave band frequency sound intensity and sound level spectra. The measurement\nsystems were field calibrated at the start of each series of measurements and checked upon\ncompletion using a Bruel & Kjr Model 3541 Sound Intensity Calibrator and Model 4228 Piston\nPhone.\nMeasurements\nSound Pressure Level (SPL) measurements were taken of the ventilation fans and radiator fans and\nSound Intensity measurements were taken throughout the inside and around the CT periphery\nincluding the ALCO/WHITE engines, Hydraulic Supercharger Pumps, Steering Pumps, JEL Pumps,\nControl Room Floor and Walls, Cab 1 Side/Rear Walls, Truck front/outside faces, and JEL cylinder\ncorners. Sound Intensity Contours (dBA), Sound Intensity and Pressure Level Bar Graphs, and\nSound Pressure Level Bar Graphs are well documented for most the CT areas [3].\nProcessed Data - Sound Pressure Level (SPL)\nThe sound pressure level measurements provide an overall sound level of all the combined noise\nsources at the microphone position. Thus, sound pressure levels are very useful when it is possible to\nmeasure one piece of equipment at a time. When undertaking interior sound level measurements the\nsound pressure level includes the direct sound radiating off of a sound emitting surface, reflected\nsound from first and second reflections off of various surfaces, and the reverberant component from\nsound that has reflected many times from the various interior surfaces present.\nThus, sound pressure level measurements are not as useful for discerning the amount of sound caused\nby an individual sound source in a multi-source environment. Sound pressure level measurements\nwere undertaken of the various electrical powered ventilation fans and radiator fans without other\nequipment operating. Their sound level does not change with the load on the Crawler Transporter\nonly their duration of operation changes with load. The measured 1/3 octave band sound levels are\npresented as bar graphs in the Reduced Data in the CT Sound Attenuation Study and Installation\ndocument [3].\nProcessed Data - Sound Intensity Level (SIL)\nSound intensity level measurements were undertaken of the major noise sources that change intensity\nlevel with load including the diesel generator sets and the hydraulic systems as well as various control\nroom and cab surfaces. The sound intensity level measurements consisted of a series of\nmeasurements taken on a known grid of the noise source or surface under consideration. A 0.5-meter\nmeasurement grid was used for all sound intensity level measurements with the exception of the\ntrucks, in which case a 0.75-meter measurement grid was used. Sound pressure level measurements\nare automatically recorded along with the sound intensity measurements.\nThe sound intensity measurements provide an indication of both the sound intensity level and the\ndirection of the sound energy flow. Thus, a sound intensity measurement indicates that sound may be\nflowing out of or into a surface. In order to visualize the sound energy flow, the sound intensity data\nwas input into mapping software to generate 1/3 octave band sound intensity noise contours of the\n\nmajor noise sources and surfaces. The contours are presented as 2D maps with an outline of the\nequipment overlaid onto the contour and a 3D contour map to provide a graphic representation of\nsound energy flow from the surface of interest. The sound level is represented by different colors for\nboth the 2D and 3D maps. The sound intensity contours are presented in th ,\xc3\xa7 rued data sound\ncontours appendix and an example of the raw sound intensity data is presented in a tabular form in the\nCT Sound Attenuation Study and Installation document released in 2000 [3].\nSTUDY RESULTS AND ENHANCEMENTS\nPhase .1\nIt consisted of removal of the old (Figure 1) and installing new upgraded engine exhaust mufflers\n(Figure 2) and upgrading engine/pump room ventilation. The first phase was designed to reduce\nnoise levels around the CT both on the ground and on the walkways. A secondary benefit of the\nabove upgrades resulted in improved air quality in the engine/pump room. Previously, the engine\nexhaust outlets were located directly under the CT, thus operators when walking under the CT to\ninspect the large trucks would be close to the exhaust outlets, and thus they were exposed to the noise\nand diesel smoke. Along with the upgraded mufflers the exhaust pipes have been extended out\nbeyond the end of the CT to terminate up in the front of the radiator fans (Figure 3). This greatly\nincreased the distance between the operator and the exhaust outlet noise and the diesel smoke.\nUtilizing the air movement from the radiator fans as the direction was reversed; the diesel smoke is\nnow blown out from the end of the CT rather than in the past as it was exhausted under the CT, thus it\nwould drift up into the CT.\nIn the past, the ventilation air was drafted in from the sidewalls (Figure 4) for the engine/pump room\nwhereby it would first sweep across the engines before being driven down over the workers and then\nexhausted out through twelve louvered outlets in the floor. The ventilation air is now drawn in from\nunder the CT through twelve filtered fan forced ventilation inlet hoods (Figure 5), thus using the\ncoolest air available. The cool air is forced up through the floor grates, and first sweeps across the\nworkers. It then flows across the engines on its way to the ceiling before being exhausted outside via\nfourteen silenced fan forced exhaust outlets (Figure 6). This change in airflow direction as well as the.\nincreased volume of ventilation air allows the engine/pump room to operate with a reasonable\ntemperature increase, and allows the doors to remain closed during operations. The \'closed doors in\nconjunction with the silenced floor and wall ventilation openings have significantly reduced noise\nlevels\' around the CT both on the catwalks and on the ground while enhancing operational conditions\nfor the CT Crew.\nPhase 2\nThis phase of the noise control will be noise suppression of the JEL hydraulic systems. The hydraulic\nsystems are all hard mounted to the s superstructure and use the rigid pipe except for its fmal\nconnections to the hydraulic cylinders. The pump tone generated by the JEL hydraulic\' systems was\nidentified as one of the major noise sources in the control room and in the driver cabs even though the\nhydraulic lines do not run directly under these areas. The JEL system noise control measures include\nmounting the JEL motors and pump skids on rubber isolators, the use of elastomeric pipe mounting\nclamps to isolate the hydraulic lines from the CT\'s superstructure, installation of flexible hose\nbetween the pumps and the rigid hydraulic lines and installation of in-line hydraulic silencers to\nattenuate the pump tone. Currently, the schedule is to conduct this work in 2004.\n\nPhase 3\nThis phase will encompass the installation of acoustical absorption on the walls and ceilings of the\nengine/pump room, use of sound lock vestibules at the engine/pump room\'s doors, and application of\nan upgraded sound reduction wall between the engine/pump room and the control room. This will\nreduce the noise levels in the control room, and further lower noise levels outside of the CT because\nof a decrease in the reverberant sound level inside the engine/pump room.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFollowing the completion of the Phase 1 of CT-2, the preliminary noise level readings indicate\nsignificant reductions as outlined in Table 2. On the catwalk on the side of the CT, the sound level\ndropped by 24 dBA when the ventilation air exhaust openings were addressed, which reduced that\nnoise level down from 101 dBA to 77 dBA. Additionally, on the ends of CT the new ventilation air\nexhaust openings suppressed the exhaust opening noise level by 16 dBA (down from 101 dBA to\n85 dBA).\nThe new ventilation systems allow the CT to operate with the engine/pump room doors closed, thus\nfostering a quieter environment on the catwalks, as well as under and around the CT. Now, with\nphase I complete on CT # 2, the difference in noise level on the catwalks with the doors open and\nclosed is 11 dBA, down from 97 dBA with the doors open to 86 dBA with the doors closed.\nUnder the center of the CT with the engines and ventilation fans operating, the noise level was\nreduced by 9 dBA, down from 93 dBA to 84 dBA.\nThe CT\'s AC power is generated from two 1073 HP White engines. The AC engine exhaust outlet\nnoise level was reduced from 85 dBA at 600 RPM down to 75 dBA, and from 91 dBA at 900 RPM\ndown to 86 dBA. Due to recent modifications to the venturi exhaust tips, these sound levels should\nnow be lower than the preliminary measurements.\nThe CT\'s DC power is generated from two 2750 HP Alco engines. The DC engine exhaust outlet\nnoise level was reduced by 13 dBA when operating at 350 RPM, down from 80 dBA to 67 dBA, and\ndown from 93 dBA to 84 dBA when operating at 1000 RPM.\nThe three implemented upgrades to-date, involving replacement and isolation of engine mufflers and\nexhausts, floor louver noise attenuation inlet fan hoods, and replacement of wall exhaust vent fans\nwith acoustical hoods, aided in eliminating diesel smoke (more of a nuisance during operations) and\nreduction in operating temperature within the engine/pump room from ambient.\nThe results presented in this report are reflective of the Phase I noise abatement for the CT. This\nphase involved the Engine Exhaust Silencers and the CT Inlet and Exhaust Ventilation systems.\nPhase 2 will cover the Hydraulic Noise Abatement modifications. Phase 3 will include the\ninstallation of acoustical panels on the Engine/Pump Room\'s Wall and Ceiling, and installing an\nAcoustical Isolation Wall between the Control Room and the Engine/Pump Room.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe article is dedicated to the entire CT design, operations and maintenance crew, for displaying\nunparallel pride in ownership of two Crawler Transporters and displaying pro-active stance to support\nmyriad of requirements put forth by NASA management.
