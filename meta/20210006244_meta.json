It was originally created in order to compare the DEJAVU runtime veri\ufb01cation tool1 with another similar tool. DEJAVU\u2019s logic is \ufb01rst-order past time temporal logic. In order to monitor such properties ef\ufb01ciently, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) [1] are used for representing the data observed in a trace. The details on the logic and its algorithm are described in e.g. [2, 3, 4]. The benchmark consists of six properties, formulated in English, and formalized in DEJAVU\u2019s logic. For each property is provided (normally) three traces, of sizes varying from 10,000 events to one million events. Traces are represented in CSV format.", "title": "The DejaVu Runtime Verification Benchmark", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210006244, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ulus, Dogan"}}, "id": "512c29c92703433ba107fcc90cdf3a48"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210006244, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Peled, Doron"}}, "id": "bb711352d4144db29eb342cefb5374f0"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210006244, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Havelund, Klaus"}}, "id": "b0457ee2603b45329015e286b26ef9ca"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:00:18.9287400+00:00", "id": 20210006244, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/49121", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210006244, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "d1d6c12e75bf469093deaf862e6ad772", "publicationDate": "2018-10-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
