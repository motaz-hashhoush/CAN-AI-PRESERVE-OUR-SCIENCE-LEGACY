b'Know Your Enemy \xe2\x80\x93 Implementation of Bioremediation within a Suspected\nDNAPL Source Zone Following High-Resolution Site Characterization at\nContractors Road Heavy Equipment Area, Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAnne Chrest (anne.m.chrest@nasa.gov) (NASA, Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA)\nRebecca Daprato, Ph.D., P.E. and Mike Burcham, P.E.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),\nKennedy Space Center (KSC), has adopted high-resolution site characterization (HRSC)\nsampling techniques during baseline sampling prior to implementation of remedies to confirm\nand refine the conceptual site model (CSM). HRSC sampling was performed at Contractors\nRoad Heavy Equipment Area (CRHE) prior to bioremediation implementation to verify the extent\nof the trichloroethene (TCE) dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source area (defined as\nthe area with TCE concentrations above 1% solubility) and its daughter product dissolved plume\nthat had been identified during previous HRSC events. The results of HRSC pre-bioremediation\nimplementation sampling suggested that the TCE source area was larger than originally\nidentified during initial site characterization activities, leading to a design refinement to improve\nelectron donor distribution and increase the likelihood of achieving remedial objectives.\nApproach/Activities. HRSC was conducted from 2009 through 2014 to delineate the vertical\nand horizontal extent of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) in the groundwater.\nApproximately 2,340 samples were collected from 363 locations using direct push technology\n(DPT) groundwater sampling techniques. Samples were collected from up to 14 depth intervals\nat each location using a 4-foot sampling screen. This HRSC approach identified a narrow (~5 to\n30 feet wide), approximately 3,000 square foot TCE DNAPL source area (maximum detected\nTCE concentration of 160,000 micrograms per liter [\xc2\xb5g/L] at DPT sampling location DPT0225).\nPrior to implementation of a bioremediation interim measure, HRSC baseline sampling was\nconducted using DPT groundwater sampling techniques. Concentrations of TCE were an order\nof magnitude lower than previous reported (12,000 \xc2\xb5g/L maximum at DPT sampling location\nDPT0225) at locations sampled adjacent to previous sampling locations. To further evaluate the\nvariability in concentrations observed additional sampling was conducted in 2016. The results\nidentified higher concentrations than originally detected within the previously defined source\narea and the presence of source zone concentrations upgradient of the previously defined\nsource area (maximum concentration observed 570,000 \xc2\xb5g/L).\nThe HRSC baseline sampling data allowed for a revision of the bioremediation design prior to\nimplementation. Bioremediation was implemented within the eastern portion of the source area\nin November and December 2016 and quarterly performance monitoring was completed in\nMarch and June 2017. Reductions in CVOC concentrations from baseline were observed at all\nperformance monitoring wells in the treatment area, and by June 2017, an approximate 95%\nCVOC mass reduction was observed based on monitoring well sampling results.\nResults/Lessons Learned. The results of this project suggest that, due to the complexity of\nDNAPL source zones, HRSC during pre-implementation baseline sampling in the TCE source\nzone was an essential strategy for verifying the treatment area and depth prior to remedy\nimplementation. If the upgradient source zone mass was not identified prior to bioremediation\nimplementation, the mass would have served as a long-term source for the dissolved plume.\n\n'
