be suitable for fixing loose particulate soils with a polymer film without visually detectable disturbance of the\nsoil particle spatial relationships.\n\nA two-component system uses a gas\n\nmonomer condensible at the soil temperature and a gas-phase catalyst acting\nto polymerize the monomer.\n\nA one-component system uses a monomer which\n\npolymerizes spontaneously on and within the top few millimeters of the soil.\nThe two-component system may result in a simpler apparatus, but has\nbeen demonstrated to operate over a narrower temperature range, approximately -40 to -10\xc2\xb0C.\n\nOther two-component polymer systems have been\n\nidentified which may operate at soil temperatures as high as + 100 \xc2\xb0C, but\nstill over relatively narrow temperature ranges of approximately 30 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe one-component system has been demonstrated to operate successfully with initial soil temperatures from -70 \xc2\xb0C or lower to +150 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nvii\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe micro structure of the lunar surface is known only to the extent\nrevealed by stereo photographs at a resolution of approximately 80 fjtm\n(Ref. 1).\n\nThe Surveyor surface sampler operation, with television monitor-\n\ning, furnished soil mechanics data at depths greater than several millimeters (Ref. 2), but the soil mechanics and morphology of the top few millimeters are still largely unknown.\n\nSome physical characteristics have been\n\ninferred from visible, infrared, and radio-frequency measurements, both\nactive and passive (Refs. 3 to 5), but several interpretations of the data are\npossible.\nSampling of the lunar surface for sample return has unfortunately resulted in destruction of the micrestructure of these top few millimeters of\nthe soil sample which are expected to be extremely tenuous and perhaps\ninfluenced by static charge, interlocking reentrant surfaces, and Van der Waals 1\nforces.\n\nPreservation and sample return of the lunar surface soil in its\n\nvirgin configuration would be of interest not only in and of itself, but also as\nan aid in the interpretation of other phenomena.\n\nFixation (in the sense of\n\nmicroscopy) of the soil requires that it be at least partially encapsulated by a\nfluid which conforms to the virgin configuration without disturbing it.\n\nPour-\n\ning of a liquid would certainly destroy the fine structure, so that deposition\nof a fixative from the gas phase is the only appropriate method of fixation.\nEvaporation or sputtering of a metal onto the surface has been considered,\nbut due to the high sticking coefficient of the metal, only line-of-sight deposition would be achieved, resulting in fixation of only the top monolayer of\nsoil.\nAsa result of these considerations two polymer systems in which\norganic monomer vapors are polymerized during or after condensation on\nand within the soil have been investigated and tests to fix soil under simulated lunar conditions have been successful.\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nAt least one of these organic vapors has an extremely low sticking\ncoefficient, of the order of 10"^ at room temperature, and penetrates into\nthe soil to a depth of 2 to 3 mm before condensing upon and fixing the soil.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nII.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nSince it would seem to be impossible to return an undisturbed sample\nof what must be an extremely fragile structure, fixation is the only technique\n(other than difficult in situ experiments) that might be used to study the\nmicro structure of the surface and its significance relative to other experiments.\nA large proportion of the experiments performed on soil samples returned by the Apollo spacecraft involves the sample depth and/or orientation;\ntherefore, documentation of the sample by fixation is applicable to many of\nthese experiments.\n\nAlso of interest is potential applicability to Earth-based\n\nmeasurements of lunar surface properties and to other studies such as lunar\nerosion processes.\nExamples of specific applications are:\nA.\n\nLunar Surface Physical Properties\nThe structure and composition of the top few millimeters of lunar soil\n\nhave been topics of investigation since Epstein (Ref. 6) first proposed a\nporous surface material in explanation of the rapid lunar eclipse cooling first\nobserved by Pettit and Nicholson in 1927 (Ref. 7).\n\nHowever, infrared mea-\n\nsurements alone do not provide adequate information for determination of a\nthermal model of the lunar surface.\n\nIndependent measurements of photo-\n\nmetric properties, thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat as a\nfunction of depth would be required to define completely a near-surface\nthermal model.\n\nCurrent theoretical models do not fit the infrared data with-\n\nout physically meaningless parameter adjustment (Ref. 8).\n\nStudies of the\n\nmorphology and composition of the surface could be conducted on fixed\nsamples.\n\nSoil mechanics and other aspects of the physical properties\n\nwould, of course, not be preserved, although studies of the sample configuration might allow inferences with respect to these properties.\nB.\n\nGardening\nStudies of nuclear track densities and solar wind abundances as a\n\nfunction of depth will be possible with fixed samples, thereby eliminating any\nuncertainty in the results of these experiments due to mixing in the upper\npart of the sample.\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nC.\n\nErosion\nThis heading is differentiated from gardening in that the erosion\n\nprocesses might be studied by means of fixation of key features such as the\nboundaries between rocks and soil.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nTECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS CONSIDERED\n\nFixation Techniques\nSeveral polymer systems and three techniques for application of the\n\npolymer to the soil have been considered.\nThe first and most thoroughly tested technique utilizes an inverted\nfunnel, the rim of which is pressed into the soil so that some degree of sealing is effected.\n\nThe funnel is capable of sustaining an inside pressure of\n\napproximately 1. 3 X 10^ N/m^ (10 torr) relative to the ambient pressure\nwithout blowout of the soil.\n\nA basalt rubble, crushed from lava flow mate-\n\nrial from Little Lake, California, was used for all of the fixation tests.\n\nThe\n\nparticle-size distribution for the soil is shown in Fig. 1. Although the distribution is appreciably coarser than that of the lunar nominal soil, the\nnative physical configuration of lunar soil could not be reconstructed in any\ncase, so that matching the particle-size distribution was not considered\ncritical to the validity of the fixation tests.\n\nTests with such material would,\n\nof course, be required prior to flight application of a fixation experiment.\nThe second technique employs a nozzle to direct the gaseous fixative\nat the soil.\n\nIt was anticipated that, should this technique prove feasible, it\n\nmight be employed in places inaccessible to a funnel, such as an erosion\nfillet adjacent to a rock.\nA third technique which has been considered, but not tested, would\nemploy a tube with porous walls that is pressed into the soil.\n\nThe fixative\n\nwould be deposited through the walls of the tube and the tube would be withdrawn with the sample adhering to it.\n\nSince it is probable that insertion of\n\nthe tube would considerably disturb the soil, and since the primary application of fixation is considered to be the top few millimeters of soil, this technique has not been investigated.\nB.\n\nSoil Permeability\nThe major part of the work reported here involved the inverted funnel\n\ntechnique.\n\nIt appears most likely to be successful, since it is closest to\n\nduplicating Earth laboratory conditions (i.e., pressure and temperature) on\nthe lunar surface.\n\nAccordingly, prior to the fixation tests the gaseous con-\n\nductivity (permeability) of vacuum-baked soil was measured with air\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nutilizing the funnel technique.\nworking above 53 N/m\n\nDue to apparatus limitations and the fact that\n\n(400 mtorr) differential was not anticipated, the mea-\n\nsurements were restricted to that pressure range.\n\nFigure 2 is a sketch of\n\nthe apparatus used for the measurements and Fig. 3 is a plot of the soil gaseous throughout as a function of differential pressure for two cases; the funnel\nrim being pressed lightly into the soil, and the soil being piled up around the\noutside of the rim.\n\nIf one assumes that the soil below the funnel edge can be\n\nconsidered infinite in extent, the specific conductance of the soil, neglecting\nedge and end effects, is\n\nj\n\n-\n\n-7\n\nAp\n\nwhere Q is the throughput, d the path length to the funnel edge (Fig. 3), A\nthe exposed soil area, and p is the funnel pressure.\n\nG\n\n_ 0.44 (N/m ) m /min X 5 X 10"^ m\n1. 33 X 10"2 m2 X 53 N/m 2\n\n= 3. 1 X 10"3 m 3 /min\n\nwhere the area of the soil exposed to the funnel interior was 133 cm\n\nand the\n\nfunnel rim was buried 0. 5 cm.\nData presented in Section IV of this report indicate that 5% by weight\nof polystyrene is more than adequate to produce good soil fixation.\n\nIf it is\n\nassumed that 1% fixative is adequate for preservation of the lunar soil\nmorphology for sample return and that the in situ density of the soil is\n1.5 X 10\'3 kg/cm 3 , then it is necessary that 0. 005 X 10"3 kg/cm 2 of fixative permeate the soil for fixation to a depth of 0. 3 cm.\n\nAssuming the\n\npermeability of the soil for the gaseous fixative to be the same as that for\nair, and utilizing the equation:\nG^AAP\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nwhere m/t\n\nis the flux rate, the specific conductance for M = 104 (the\n\nmolecular weight of both of the organic monomers of interest) is given\nby:\n\n= 3. 1 X 1<T3 (N/m 2 ) m 3 /min\nN/m"\n\nx 4 _ 5g x\n\nlfl-5\n\nkg\n(N/m 2 ) m 3\n\n*P = 5 X 10" 2 kg/m 2\n\nAP = 67 N/m 2 (500 mtorr)\n\nd = 3 X 10"3 m\n\nmd\nG,,AAP\nM\n\n= 15 min\n\nThe above calculation is of limited value since, relative to air, the\nfixative is condensible and of vastly different adsorptive properties.\n\nMore-\n\nover, the point has been made that permeation of fine soil by a gas near the\nsoil surface will eventually seal the surface, thus limiting the depth of penetration which can be achieved under given conditions.\nIt would be expected that the depth of penetration could be increased by\nmaintaining the surface relatively hot during the initial phases of deposition,\nthus preventing the fixative from sealing the surface and allowing greater\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\npenetration, then cooling the surface during deposition to complete the\nprocess.\n\nHowever, such a process is not quite so straightforward.\n\nBoth\n\npermeation and deposition rates are functions of temperature, and so, for a\nfixed pressure, the\npermeation rate = \xe2\x80\x94 = f(T)\n\ndeposition rate = g(T)\nPenetration can then be expected to increase with temperature in the region\nwhere\n6T\n\n6T\n\nDeposition times will, of course, increase with temperature in any case.\nThe function f(T) can be expected from kinetic theory to be proportional to T\n\n\'\n\ntional to T \'\n\nif the flow can be considered molecular, but may be propor\nto T\n\nif the process is diffusive.\n\nThe deposition rate de-\n\npendence on temperature is of the form\n\ng(T) cc \xc2\xab\nIt would be necessary to determine both functions in order to infer the\neffectiveness of temperature gradients on depths of penetration.\n\nFor the\n\npurpose of the work reported here a direct measurement of the effects of\ntemperature on depth of penetration is preferable.\n\nHowever, it should be\n\nnoted that, for permeation and deposition rates of the forms mentioned,\nthere will be an optimum temperature for maximum penetration.\nC.\n\nPolymer Systems Considered\nBrief descriptions of each of the systems which have been considered\n\nare:\n1.\n\nMonomer/Catalyst Systems.\n\nAlthough a large number of both\n\nmonomers and catalysts exist in the vapor phase and can be condensed onto\nsoils to form polymers, only the styrene/BF, system has been tested during\nthis program.\n\nIn monomer/catalyst systems the polymerization reaction\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\ntakes place upon exposure of the monomer to the catalyst, and the reaction\nhas proceeded best when the monomer is first condensed onto the soil in the\nli"quid phase and then exposed to the catalyst.\n2.\n\nParylene.\n\nThe Parylene system which has been used in these\n\nstudies is Parylene-N.\n\nThe Parylene dimer (di-p-xylylene) is available\n\nfrom Union Carbide Corp. as a stable white crystalline material:\n\nCH,\n\nCH\n\nCH,\n\nThis pure chemical is sublimed and then pyrolyzed in the vapor phase to\nyield the Parylene monomer divalent radical:\n\nCooling of the monomer vapor to a temperature below ~100\xc2\xb0C results in\nspontaneous polymerization to yield the Parylene polymer, poly-paraxylylene:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2CH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 CH\n\n-J n\n\n1Trademark of Union Carbide Corp.\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nThe number of repeating units, or "n," is generally in the range of\n5000; the molecular weight, therefore, is about 500,000.\n\nFurther details on\n\nthe properties of Parylene can be found in Ref. 10.\n3.\n\nPhotopolymerization.\n\nA wide variety of monomers has been\n\npolymerized by exposure to ultraviolet light.\n\nSeveral tests were performed\n\nin which a monomer was condensed into the soil and then exposed to ultraviolet rays. Although polymerization was obtained for a thin surface film,\nthe reaction did not propagate into the soil sample.\n4.\n\nPolymerization by High-Energy Radiation. Polymerization by\n\nmeans of exposure of a monomer to X- or \\-rays has been suggested but has\nnot been investigated due to an assessment that this system might prove to\nbe less attractive than others from a size and weight standpoint and due to\nmanned flight personnel safety considerations.\n\n10\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nMONOMER/CATALYST PROCESSES AND RESULTS\n\nStyrene Polymerization\nThe polymerization of styrene is a chain reaction that can be readily\n\ninitiated thermally or by the aid of various catalysts.\n\nThe reaction can be\n\ndepicted schematically as follows:\n\nCH=CH\n\nCH - CH 2\n\no \xe2\x80\x94o\n2\n\nDuring polymerization the double bonds disappear and heat is evolved\nO\n\namounting to 160 X 10 cal/kg which is almost equivalent to the heat of\nhydrogenation of the double bonds.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\n*\n\n0.90 X 10" kg/cm\n\nThe density increases from about\n\n3\n\no\n\nto about 1.045 X 10\n\no\n\nkg/cm\n\nfor the polymer.\n\nThe\n\nmolecular weight of the polymer may range from a few thousand to over one\nmillion, depending on the polymerization conditions.\nThermally initiated polymerization of styrene proceeds rather slowly\nunless fairly high temperatures are used, in which case the reaction is apt\nto become uncontrollable.\n\nPeroxide and other free radical catalysts are\n\nable to speed up the polymerization reaction at moderate temperatures but\nstill yield only fairly slow reactions.\nCatalysts such as B F _ , SnCl., and A1C1. cause the polymerization\nreaction to proceed by an ionic rather than a free radical mechanism.\ncatalysts are extremely reactive, even at low temperatures.\n\nThese\n\nBecause of its\n\nhigh activity in catalyzing polymerization of styrene at low temperature, and\nits ease of handling as a gas, BF_ was chosen as the p r e f e r r e d catalyst in\nthis investigation.\nB.\n\nMechanism of Soil Fixation With Styrene\nA hypothesis for the mechanism of soil fixation by styrene polymeriza-\n\ntion is proposed as follows: When the soil mass is exposed to styrene vapor\nat a pressure approaching the saturation pressure at any given temperature,\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n11\n\nstyrene is physically adsorbed on all the available surfaces to a thickness of\na few monolayers.\n\nMore importantly, capillary condensation takes place in\n\nthe sharply reentrant angles near the points of contact between grains.\nPolymerization of the condensed styrene in situ will form solid bridges at\ngrain interfaces.\n\nThe important feature of the mechanism is that capillary\n\ncondensation can take place below the saturation pressure of styrene at the\ncorrect sites to effect bonding.\n\nHence, it is unnecessary to saturate the\n\nsoil mass with an excessive amount of styrene to achieve the desired consolidation.\nCondensation takes place in the reentrant region near contact points by\nvirtue of the reduction in vapor pressure over a concave liquid meniscus.\nThe extent of lowering of vapor pressure over a curved meniscus finds\nexpression in the Kelvin equation:\n\nrRT\n\nWhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus, y is the surface\ntension of the liquid, V is the molecular volume, 8 is the contact angle of\nthe liquid against the solid, P is the equilibrium vapor pressure over the\ncurved meniscus and P\xc2\xbb is the vapor pressure of the bulk liquid.\n\nAlthough\n\nthe Kelvin equation was originally derived for condensation in a cylindrical\ncapillary tube, it holds in general for any kind of pore structure, including\nslots and parallel plates.\nIf we depict two grains in contact as shown in Fig. 4, the diameter of\nthe neck, D, is a function of the radius of curvature, r, which in turn is\ndetermined by the relative pressure of styrene vapor (P/P.) in the system.\nIt is assumed here that the significant radius of curvature is the one\nin the plane cutting the center of the two spheres.\n\nThe height of the spher-\n\nical segment, h, is taken as approximately equal to r, the so-called Kelvin\nradius.\nThe Kelvin radius required to bring about a reasonable reduction in\nvapor pressure is quite small.\n\nNevertheless, in fine-particle systems\n\nvapor pressure reduction is quite easily observed.\n\nUsing the Kelvin equa-\n\ntion, relative lowering of vapor p r e s s u r e for different radii are calculated\nas in the following:\n12\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n-2vM\npRT(lnP/P0)\n\nFor styrene at 0\xc2\xb0C\n\nY = 3.45 X 10"2 J/m2\nM = 104\np = 9. 24 X

neck area) can, therefore, be approximated\nfor any idealized particle system for a given relative pressure of styrene\nvapor.\n\nFor contact between two spherical particles with radii &l,\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n13\n\nr = h =\n\nFor 10-fJLm radius particles, the following values have been calculated:\n\nT-./T-.\nP/Pn\n\n0\n\n,., . diameter D\n.\nT-.\nNeck ,.\n,\n.\n(|J.m)\n^

formed at pressure well\nbelow the saturation pressure of styrene.\nIt is believed that the mechanism described should be generally applicable whether the catalyst required to effect polymerization is added after the\ncapillary condensation or is present in the system during condensation.\nThere is no evidence for extensive vapor-phase polymerization; hence, it is\nproposed that condensation takes place as described, but the styrene is\nrapidly polymerized as it condenses by catalyst diffusing into the liquid\nphase.\n\nInitially the BF_ is thought to be chemisorbed on the solid surfaces\n\nif added before the styrene is introduced. Adding the BF_ and styrene\nsimultaneously need not change the basic mechanism.\n\nStyrene will condense\n\nand be polymerized by BF_ dissolving in it from the vapor phase.\nExperimental evidence indicates that addition of the styrene first to the\nsystem, followed by catalyst addition, results in a more uniform distribution\nof polymer in the soil system.\n\nIt is believed that this is due to the self-\n\nregulating properties of the system.\n\nThe soil mass at the surface receives\n\nthe styrene vapor first and styrene will condense there first.\n\nHowever, the\n\nheat liberated will increase the vapor pressure at this region and the vapor\nwill tend to seek out cooler portions of the system.\n\nTherefore, when fixed\n\nequilibrium conditions are achieved, there will be a tendency for fairly\n\n14\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nuniform distribution of the styrene in the condensed phase.\n\nThis process is\n\nupset if polymerization takes place fairly rapidly as styrene condenses,\nbecause the vapor p r e s s u r e is reduced by polymerization.\n\nThe net result is\n\nthat the distribution is likely to be uneven; in fact, this is observed experimentally.\nC.\n\nApparatus\nThe apparatus shown schematically in Fig. 5 was constructed for use\n\nin this phase of the investigation.\nto evacuate the bell jar.\n\nA high-speed oil diffusion pump was used\n\nAn external manifold, with separate vacuum sys-\n\ntem, was used for feeding measured quantities of monomer vapor and\ncatalyst into the bell jar.\nThe base plate of the bell-jar system contained a brass disk that\nserved as a heat sink for the Peltier cooler which was affixed to it.\n\nThe\n\nheat sink was equipped with an internal coil through which water or other\ncoolant circulated.\n\nA metal tray or cup was placed on top of the Peltier\n\ncooler and contained a layer of simulated lunar soil.\nTemperature control of the soil sample was effected by regulating the\ntemperature of the heat sink by circulation of coolant and by adjusting the\npower input to the Peltier cooler.\n\nBy reversing the current through the\n\nPeltier device it was used to heat the sample as well as cool it.\n\nThe tem-\n\nperature of the heat sink, top plate of Peltier cooler, and soil sample w e r e\nmeasured with thermocouples and temperatures w e r e continuously recorded\nduring experiments.\n\nBecause of the low thermal conductivity of the soil,\n\nabout 500 N/m^ (4 torr) helium pressure was usually established temporarily\nin the bell jar to assist in cooling the soil sample.\nD.\n\nExperimental\n1.\n\nOpen-Cup Experiments.\n\nThis phase of the investigation was de-\n\nsigned to determine feasibility of polymerizing styrene in a. soil mass to\neffect its consolidation.\n\nA weighed quantity of soil was placed in a metal\n\ncup and placed on the top plate of the Peltier cooler.\n\nThe configuration is\n\nshown in Fig. 6.\nThe soil sample was heated to about 60 to 80 \xc2\xb0C in a vacuum to degass\nit.\n\nThen it was cooled below room temperature, the valve to the vacuum\n\npump and cold trap was closed, and styrene vapor admitted to the bell jar.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n15\n\nAfter 10 min, BF-, gas was added to the bell jar to a p r e s s u r e of several\no\n\nhundred N/m\n\n-^\n\n(several torr).\n\nThe operating parameters and results of the various open-cup experiments are tabulated in Table 1. The f i r s t two experiments failed to yield\nsignificant fixation of the soil, but the poor results are attributed to accidental displacement of the thermocouple during assembly, therefore the\nsoil temperature never reached the indicated value.\n\nStyrene vapor con-\n\ndensed preferentially on the Peltier cooler and copper plate and hardly at all\nin the soil.\n\nIn later experiments, judicious placement of radiation shields,\n\nand some slight warming of the Peltier cooler immediately before adding\nthe styrene vapor, insured that the soil was initially the coldest part of the\nsystem; hence, styrene would preferentially condense on and in it.\n\nUnder\n\nthese conditions good consolidation of the soil was effected in several runs.\n(Run 7 in Table 1 is cited as a typical good run).\nThe best results were obtained when the styrene was added to the system first and polymerized in situ.\n\nThe progress of addition of the styrene\n\nand its subsequent polymerization was readily followed by observing the\ntemperature of the soil (Fig. 7).\n\nDuring condensation of the styrene, there\n\nis a steady increase in temperature due to liberation of the heat of condensation.\n\nUpon addition of BF-^, there is a steep exotherm due to the heat of\n\npolymerization.\n2.\n\nClosed-Cup Experiments.\n\nAlthough the open-cup experiments\n\ndescribed in the preceding section demonstrated the feasibility of soil fixation with polystyrene, the approach does not represent a practical method\nof soil fixation in the lunar environment, because pressure of reactants\ncannot be maintained in high vacuum.\n\nAttention was directed, t h e r e f o r e , to\n\nan approach in which a small inverted cup was pressed into the soil in\nvacuum, and the reactants introduced to the interior of the cup.\nThe closed-cup experiments were generally successful in effecting\nconsolidation of the soil, except when poor sealing around the edge of the\ncup allowed the reactants to escape too rapidly.\nof three different cups.\n\nThis problem led to design\n\nThe type shown in Fig. 8, and to some extent a\n\nsimilar type (not shown) involving an added baffle in the soil, failed to provide reliable sealing.\n\nThe weakness of these designs appears to be lateral\n\ndisplacement of the cup when lowered into the soil as the knife edge\n16\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nencounters large particles.\n\nUnable to penetrate a large particle, the cup\n\ntends to slide sideways with excessive disturbance of the soil.\ncup of the type shown in Fig. 9 was generally more successful.\n\nThe closed\nLess soil\n\nis disturbed and a longer diffusion path is presented to the reactants.\nFurther reliability was insured by screening the soil to remove large lumps.\nThe various parameters investigated are outlined in Table 2 for the\nclosed-cup experiments.\n\nGood soil fixation was obtained at various temper-\n\natures from 0 to -33 \xc2\xb0C (initial soil temperature).\n\nAgain the best results\n\nwere obtained by addition of styrene first followed by BF^.\n\nWhen the catalyst\n\nwas added first, the tendency was to obtain nonumform distribution of\npolymer.\n3.\n\nOpen-Nozzle Experiments.\n\nThe next phase of the investigation\n\ninvolved use of a supersonic nozzle to introduce the monomer-catalyst mixture.\n\nThe experimental nozzle and relationship to the condensing surfaces\n\nare depicted schematically in Fig.\n\n10. The first two experiments were con-\n\nducted with a polished aluminum plate instead of the tray holding the soil\nsample.\nIn Run 1 (Table 3) a 12-mm ID nozzle was used and only a trace of\npolystyrene was collected on the plate which was maintained at -60 \xc2\xb0C during\nthe run.\n\nReduction of the nozzle diameter to 8 mm for Run 2 led to collec-\n\ntion of 50 mg of polystyrene on the plate.\n\nThis amounted to about 10% of the\n\ntotal styrene fed through the nozzle in 6\xc2\xb0 mm.\n\nAfter this encouraging re-\n\nsult, the experiment was repeated with a thin layer of simulated lunar soil.\nUnfortunately, no significant fixation of the soil was obtained\n\nThe poly-\n\nstyrene content of the soil was 0. 1% by weight, which is insufficient to fix\nthe soil.\n\nIt is probable that the soil temperature, at least at the surface,\n\ndoes not remain at low enough temperature during the experiment.\nLater experiments involved increasing the nozzle p r e s s u r e and attendant flow of reactants.\n\nIt was n e c e s s a r y to install a liquid-nitrogen-cooled\n\nshroud around the walls of the bell jar to maintain the system p r e s s u r e at a\nlow level with the high reactant flow rate.\ntrifluonde etherate was used as a catalyst.\n\nIn the final experiment, boron\nBeing less volatile than BF-j, it\n\nwas thought that it might be more effective under these rapid pumping conditions.\n\nNone of the open-nozzle tests proved successful.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n17\n\nE.\n\nOther Two-Component Systems\nThe utility of a two-component system depends on the monomer con-\n\ndensing from the gas phase.\n\nThis implies that the substrate be near the\n\ncondensation temperature but not so cold as to f r e e z e the monomer and thus\ninhibit its polymerization.\nThe material (styrene) chosen for this study satisfies these conditions\nfor the immediate range of the lunar surface temperature, but would not be\nsuitable for a higher temperature substrate, since it would pass through the\nsoil as a gas without condensing.\n\nThis constraint prompted a brief search\n\nfor candidate materials whose boiling points would be near 100 \xc2\xb0C at the prevailing low pressures.\nThe search revealed a family of at least 17 styrene derivatives with\nboiling points ranging from a low of 60 \xc2\xb0C at 2. 26 X 103 N/m 2 (17 torr)\n(a methylstyrene) to a high of 277 8 C at 10 5 N/m 2 (2-nitro- styrene).\n\nThe\n\nliterature was meager in boiling point data at other pressures, but extrapolation suggests that several materials would be candidates for the 100 \xc2\xb0C\nrange.\nAll the styrene derivatives would be catalyzed by boron trifluoride and\nthis suggests the possibility of a phased system using two or more monomers.\nIf a low boiling monomer were released and did not produce the typical heat\nof condensation, a progressively higher boiling material could be released\nuntil the condensation was noted by the operator, or was used to automatically trigger the catalyst release.\nIt follows that any device designed to utilize these materials must be\nmaintained at a temperature high enough to avoid condensation in the valving,\nmanifolds, and nozzles.\n\nThis could reasonably be accomplished by proper\n\nthermal design of the apparatus.\nThe epoxies were identified as another attractive family of materials.\nOne of these, phenyl glycidyl ether, has a boiling point of 138\xc2\xb0C at 400\nN/m .\n\nIts handling parallels that of the styrenes, but catalysis might best\n\nbe accomplished by an amine compound, again in the gas phase.\nA system of this class would have the possible advantage of matching\nthe chemistry and refractive index of the post-mission embedding for thin\n\n18\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nsections.\n\nA disadvantage might stem from the need for heating the catalyst\n\nsource (not required with boron trifluoride).\nIt is reasonable to expect that other two-component systems exist and\nshould be studied along with those already identified.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n19\n\nV.\nA.\n\nPARYLENE PROCESS AND RESULTS\n\nParylene Process\nIt was stated in Section III that the Parylene monomer polymerizes\n\n11\n\nspontaneously" upon cooling to a temperature below 100 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nThe mechanism\n\nof polymerization is not known in detail, but the material does not pass\nthrough the liquid phase during polymerization and thus should exhibit no\neffects due to surface tension, as might be expected with processes in which\na liquid contacts the soil.\n\nThe quantitative significance of this detail is not\n\npresently known.\nB.\n\nApparatus\nFigure 11 shows the apparatus used in the Parylene fixation tests\n\nemploying the funnel technique.\n\nThe pyrolyzer is maintained at a tempera-\n\nture of 500 to 680 \xc2\xb0C, and the evaporator (sublimator) is controlled at a\ntemperature less than 200 "C such that the indicated pressure measured at\nthe pyrolyzer vacuum gauge is approximately 13 N/m^.\n\nIn order that the\n\nreaction process proceed properly, it is also necessary that the Parylene\nflow rate through the pyrolyzer be correct.\n\nIt has been found experimentally\n\nthat the 10-mm vent shown on the funnel results in a flow rate of approximately 0.003 kg/h at a pyrolyzer p r e s s u r e of 13 N/cm^ and that a polymer\nof good quality is produced under these conditions.\n\nFrom the conductance\n\nequation given in Section III, exposure of the soil to the monomer under\nthese conditions will result in a permeation rate of approximately 0 . 0 0 0 2\nkg/h for the 50 cm 2 sample (8.0-cm dia), P = 13 N/m 2 and a funnel depth\nof 3 mm.\n\nThus, only about 6% of the monomer generated by a properly\n\noperating pyrolyzer of 2. 5-cm dia can be used in fixing a soil sample 8 cm\nin diameter.\n\nAlthough the percent Parylene in fixed samples has not been\n\ndetermined because of such factors as escape through the vent, deposition\non the funnel, and general unsuitability of the experimental setup for quantitative measurements, those measurements which have been made indicate\nthat less than 5% polymer by weight is required.\nThe pyrolyzer pressure gauge was maintained at 265 \xc2\xb0C in order to\nprevent deposition of polymer on the gauge elements.\n\nA bend in the tubing\n\njoining the pyrolyzer to the funnel or nozzle thermally isolates the pyrolyzer\nfrom the soil sample.\n\n20\n\nThe LN ? shroud serves two purposes, simulation of\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nthe space thermal environment and as a cryogenic pump for condensible\ngases, particularly the large quantities of Parylene generated.\nO\n\nwas typically held below an indicated pressure of 10\n\nThe bell jar\n\nT\n\nN/m\n\nduring all runs.\n\nControl of the initial temperature of the soil was facilitated by means\nof adding about 1. 3 X 103 N/m 2 (10 torr) of N2 to the system.\n\nFor the low-\n\ntemperature runs LN? was circulated through the shroud until the temperature indicated by thermocouples buried in the soil reached the desired remperature.\n\nFor the high-temperature runs an incandescent spot lamp located\n\nwithin the shroud was directed at the soil until the buried thermocouples\nreached the desired temperature.\n\nThe lamp was then turned off.\n\nThe gas-\n\neous N\xc2\xa3 was evacuated after the desired temperature had been reached and\nthe run begun.\nC.\n\nExperimental\n1.\n\nOpen-Cup Experiments.\n\nThe initial Parylene soil fixation experi-\n\nments were conducted at Union Carbide Corp. facilities with existing equipment.\n\nWith this equipment a deposition chamber follows the pyrolyzer and\n\nprecedes a cold trap and mechanical vacuum pump.\n\nThe deposition chamber\n\npressure is controlled by the source output and by the ratio of the chamber\ninput to output conductance.\n\nOnly the source output is controlled, by con-\n\ntrolling the temperature of the evaporator.\n\nThe soil sample was contained\n\nin an open cup placed in the deposition chamber.\n\nThe initial tests were suc-\n\ncessful but did not simulate conditions achievable for in situ samples on the\nMoon.\n\nHowever, these initial tests were encouraging enough that tests of\n\nthe type described in Section III of this report were conducted.\n2.\n\nInverted Funnel Experiments.\n\nPrevious experience had indicated\n\nthat the seal formed at the rim of a funnel inverted in soil is capable of withstanding several hundreds of Newtons per square meter of pressure without\nblowout of the soil.\n\nThe initial inverted funnel experiments were conducted\n\nwithout the funnel vent, but the soil conductance was inadequate to maintain\nflow through the pyrolyzer; thus, the dimer cracking reaction did not proceed\nproperly.\n\nIt was possible under these low flow rate conditions to maintain\n\nan indicated pressure of 13 to 27 N/m\n\nin the pyrolyzer for several hours\n\nwithout measurable evaporation of the dimer or detectable deposition of\nParylene on the soil.\n\nIn order to establish conditions in the pyrolyzer such\n\nthat the reaction would proceed normally, as in the open-cup experiments,\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n21\n\nthe funnel was vented to the high vacuum within the shroud through a 10-mm\nID tube for runs at pyrolyzer pressures of 13 N/m .\n\nFor some later runs\n\nthe vent tube was further restricted in order to operate at higher pyrolyzer\n(and funnel) p r e s s u r e s in an attempt to increase the penetration of the fixative.\n\nThe soil surface was also heated.\n\nAll attempts at increasing the pene-\n\ntration failed for the specific soil used in these tests.\n\nA coarser soil would\n\nundoubtedly allow greater penetration but no runs were made with coarse\nsoils.\n\nRun 52671 was made with a finer cut (~300 fim) of the same soil in an\n\nattempt to duplicate conditions of the styrene/BF- runs and resulted in somewhat less penetration.\nTable 4 is a summary of key runs made using the inverted funnel technique.\n\nOnly a representative number of runs have been tabulated.\n\nApproxi-\n\nmately 10 runs either yielded negative results or were incomplete and are\nnot tabulated, although the general results of such runs have been discussed\nabove.\nIn a few cases the pyrolyzer pressure did not increase in a normal\nmanner until about a half hour after the run had begun.\n\nIt was found for these\n\ncases that the initial seal of the funnel to soil had been poor but that Parylene\nhad deposited at the leak, finally sealing it and allowing the deposition to\nproceed normally.\n3.\n\nOpen-Nozzle Experiments.\n\nThree types were conducted. The\n\nnozzle exhaust was directed at:\n(a)\n\nA cold copper plate.\n\n(b)\n\nA pressure gauge of the same type used in the pyrolyzer.\n\n(c)\n\nSoil samples.\n\nThe nozzle was offset from the pyrolyzer to break the thermal radiation path, and the apparatus was operated in the same manner as with the\nfunnel.\n\nThe nozzle ID was 9. 2 mm, so that operating parameters were\n\nnearly identical.\n\nNozzle standoff distance was 2. 5 cm.\n\nThe copper plate was thermally attached to the LN-, shroud and was\nheld at or below -40 \xc2\xb0C throughout the deposition. The interior of the LN 7\n-3\n2\nshroud was again held at or below 10 N/m except in the nozzle wake.\nEvaporation and pyrolysis of 10\n\nkg of Parylene yielded a disk of polymer\n\nabout 2 cm in diameter by 0. 12 mm thick.\n22\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nMeasurement of the recovery p r e s s u r e at a distance of 2. 5 cm from\nthe nozzle indicated that approximately 10 to 20% of the pyrolyzer pressure\nwas recovered at gauge port in a flat plate normal to the flow.\nTwo soil samples were fixed under conditions identical to the above\ntests.\n\nFixed, but somewhat friable, samples 2 cm dia X 2 mm thick were\n\nobtained.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n23\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAccuracy of Fixation\nThe goal of the work reported here is preservation of the morphology\n\nof the top few millimeters of the lunar soil.\n\nHowever, no requirement for\n\naccuracy of fixation has been given, and no measurement of the accuracy\nachieved has been made.\n\nAlthough a large number of techniques for mea-\n\nsurement of the accuracy of fixation can be listed, the most definitive test\nwould be to simulate the appropriate sample return experiment.\n\nFor ex-\n\nample, for nuclear track studies the sample could be exposed to radiation\nwhile in the simulator and then fixed.\n\nThe normal or proposed sample re-\n\nturn experiments could then be conducted on the sample.\n\nUntil such tests\n\nare conducted or accuracy criteria otherwise established, no work can be\ndone to determine if sufficient accuracy is being achieved.\ndetermining accuracy of fixation have been employed.\n\nTwo means for\n\nIn the first, sand\n\ngrains were dropped into soil samples prior to fixation.\n\nBoth polymer sys-\n\ntems left vertical walls where the sand had dropped into the soil.\n\nIn the\n\nsecond, a light coat of aerosol paint was deposited on the soil surface, and\nno disturbance could be observed after fixation.\nB.\n\nRemoval of Fixative\nThe choice of the best fixation system must hinge not only on the\n\nsample-fixing constraints, but on the intended use of the returned material.\nParylene and epoxies are good materials for thin sectioning since they are\nhighly Inert and are also a good match for the refractive index of the embedment.\n\nTheir inert nature may be a disadvantage to the goal of removing the\n\nmatrix.\n\nLikewise, the release or exposure of the surface of discrete par-\n\nticles may be complicated by such an inert film.\nStyrene and its derivatives might prove to be advantageous in returned\nmaterial analysis due to their high solubility.\n\nAnother possibility for the\n\nremoval of fixative is by localized heating with an electron beam in vacuum.\nThis method has the multiple effect of breaking chemical bonds, heating,\nand pumping away the volatile products.\nA similar method which should be effective on styrene and might be\neffective on Parylene is bombardment with active ions.\n\n24\n\nSuch a gas-phase\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n"etching" should be investigated as a means of preparing samples for observation in a scanning electron microscope.\n\nIndeed, the reaction would be\n\nbest investigated in a microscope that is equipped with an ion gun so as to\nunderstand the action of the "etchant" on the fixative and the underlying lunar\nmaterial.\nSimulated soil samples fixed by both the Parylene and monomer/\ncatalyst processes have been embedded in epoxy and thin sectioned.\nThe thin sectioning was done using customary materials and techniques\nwith one exception: the fixed sample was placed in a vacuum system with\nthe embedding material\n\nin an externally tiltable cup above.\n\npressure was reduced to below 7 N/m\n\nThe vessel\n\nuntil outgassing of the resin\n\nsubsided, voids in the sample were clear of gas, and any unreacted materials pumped away.\nThe resin mix was then poured by remote control into the sample cup,\ntotally immersing the sample.\n\nNo bubbling was noted, indicating that no gas\n\nwas displaced from pores in the sample.\n\nThe system was then returned to\n\nambient p r e s s u r e and the infused sample t r a n s f e r r e d to an oven to cure.\nThe resulting block was diamond sawed, mounted, and lapped in the\nconventional way.\n\nThe thin sections were examined in the microscope and\n\nno evidence of voids was seen.\nC.\n\nOther Performance Factors\nWhat may be an advantage for one experiment may be a disadvantage\n\nfor another.\n\nBased on the assumption that an inverted funnel technique would\n\nbe used for a flight experiment, some of the apparent advantages and disadvantages of the two polymer systems are listed as follows:\nAdvantages\nMonomer/catalyst\n\nParylene\n\nLow weight and power\n\nNo liquid phase\n\nShort deposition time\n\nWide temperature range\n\nEasily removed\n\nNo fluid handling\n\nResin, Shell

temperature range\n\nLong deposition time\n\nFluid handling required\ntoxic catalyst\n\n26\n\nHigh weight and power\n\nNot easily removed\n\nJPL, Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe feasibility of soil fixation with no visually apparent disturbance\nhas been established for two basic polymer types, the monomer/catalyst\ntype and the Parylene type.\n\nBoth employ gaseous deposition of the fixative.\n\nThe fixatives can be deposited at p r e s s u r e s of less than 1. 33 X 10\n\nN/m\n\n(10 t o r r ) , thus allowing a seal to be made between an inverted "funnel" and\nthe lunar soil.\nThe fixed samples are tough and readily handled.\n\nConsiderable effort\n\nis required to break off a piece of a sample, and it is necessary to f r e e the\nsample from the funnel with a knife or spatula.\nCompletion of tradeoff studies between the two polymer types and\ndesign of flight instruments would require additional work and determination\nof the specific experiments to which the technique would be applied.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-521\n\n27\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nGold, T. , "Apollo 11 and 12 Close-up Photography."
