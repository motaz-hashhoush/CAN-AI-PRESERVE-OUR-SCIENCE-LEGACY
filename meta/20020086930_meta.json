An example is Maryland Summer Centers for Gifted and Talented Students sponsored by the Maryland State Department of Education. Some 2,600 students participated in the 1990 program. One of the 12 centers is the Center for Space Science and Technology at Goddard Space Flight Center, which provides instruction to students of the 9-12 grade level. This center is operated by a three organization partnership that includes the Maryland State Department of Education, the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Center, which hosts the instructional program and provides volunteer scientists and engineers as instructors. Typical two-week space intern program includes panel discussions, lectures, tours, field trips and hands-on activity focusing on various space science topics. Senior high students benefit from a one-to-one mentor relationship with a volunteer scientist or engineer. Another example was the Paducah (Kentucky) NASA Community Involvement Project, a joint educational effort of Langley and Lewis Research Centers, Marshall Space Flight Center, the Kentucky Department of Education, the City of Paducah and Paducah Independent Schools. It was a 16 day exposition/symposium featuring seminars on space subjects.", "title": "NASA/State Education Cooperation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086930, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086930, "id": "ce6d5bc4aa7c40fb9e46b71199687951", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086930.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086930/downloads/20020086930.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086930/downloads/20020086930.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086930/downloads/20020086930.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
