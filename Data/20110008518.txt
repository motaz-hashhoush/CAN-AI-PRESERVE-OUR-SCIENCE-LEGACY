b'Human Modeling For Ground Processing Human Factors Engineering\nAnalysis\nLecture\n\nAbstract\n\nThere have been many advancements and accomplishments over that last few years using human modeling for\nhuman factors engineering analysis for design of spacecraft and launch vehicles. The key methods used for this\nare motion capture and computer generated human models. The focus of this paper is to explain the different\ntypes of human modeling used currently and in the past at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) currently, and to\nexplain the future plans for human modeling for future spacecraft designs.\nSummary\n\nThe purpose of this study is to describe the different human modeling used at the Kennedy Space Center for\nhuman factor analysis. The work in this proposal includes literature review of work performed at KSC and\ndiscussions with experts in the field of human modeling at the Kennedy Space Center. As will be shown in this\nwork, there have been several successes by using human modeling for analyzing the human activities in\nspacecraft processing. We are now at the point where the knowledge, skills and experience from the past can be\ncombined with the current direction for technology to enable even greater strides to be made for human\nmodeling for human factors analysis for future space flight systems.\n\n'
