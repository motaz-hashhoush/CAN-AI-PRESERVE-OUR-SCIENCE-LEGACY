The impact of providing aircraft armor in lieu of engine armor for typical three- and four-engine wide bodied transports for protection within the length of the engine case as well as from fragments exiting ahead of the enlet engine inlet flange is assessed. For protection within the length of the engine case, armor weight penalties, plus fuel burned and dollar cost of carrying the armor protection are defined. Immediately ahead of the inlet flange, direct tangential impacts are predominant, but further forward, rebound impacts predominate. Armor thickness requirements and fuel cost impact of protection are given.", "title": "Approaches to rotor fragment protection", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T13:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780002133, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oconnor, M.
