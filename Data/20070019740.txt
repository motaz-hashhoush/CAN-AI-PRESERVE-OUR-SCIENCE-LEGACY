b'Poultry lndustry Energy Research\nThe poultry industry, a multi-billiondollar business in the United States,\nuses great amounts of energy in such\noperations as broiler growing, feed\nmanufacturing, poultry processing\nand packing. Higher costs and limited\nsupply of fuels common to the industry are predicted, so poultry producers are seeking ways to reduce\nl - . . - - s ~ e r g expenditure. NASA is providy\ning assistance to Delmarva Poultry\nIndustry, Inc., an association of some\n4,000 growers and suppliers in one of\nthe nation\'s largest poultry production areas. Delmarva is the East Coast\npeninsula that includes Delaware and\nparts of Maryland and Virginia.\nThe upper right photo shows a weather\nstation in the Delmarva area (wind indicator on the pole, other instruments\nin the elevated box). The station is located at the University of Maryland\'s\nBroiler Sub-station, Salisbury; Maryland, where the university conducts\nresearch on poultry production and\nprocessing. The sub-station is investigating ways of conserving energy in\nbroiler production and also exploring\nthe potential of solar collectors as an\nalternative energy source. For these\nstudies, it is essential that researchers\nhave continuous data on temperature,\npressure, wind speed and direction,\nsolar intensity and cloud cover.\nEquipment to acquire such data was\nloaned and installed by NASA\'s\nWallops Flight Center, Wallops Island,\nVirginia.\nIn a related project, Wallops Flight\nCenter is helping Delmarva Poultry\nIndustry establish a seasonal wind\nprofile for the area. The intent is to\nassess the future potential of wind\nturbine power systems, now being\ndeveloped by NASA and the Department of Energy, for reducing costs of\nDelmarva feed manufacturers. The\nCenter provided and installed wind\nmeasuring equipment at a typical site\n\nadjacent to the Chesapeake Food\nFeed Mill, Princess Anne, Maryland.\nThe equipment will gather data over a\ntwo year period.\nBriefcarre Communicator\nIn the photo at bottom right, a U.S.\nPark Police officer is demonstrating a\nbattery-powered communications\nsystem, sufficiently compact to be\npacked in a briefcase-size container,\nwhich can send and receive signals\nover great distances by means of\nsatellite relay. Key to the system\'s eff icacy is the hi~h-powered\ntransmitting and receiving equipment aboard\nsuch NASA satellites as the Applications Technology Satellite6 (ATS-6)\nand the joint U.S.-Canadian Communications Technology Satellite\n(CTS); this enables the briefcase\ncommunicator to pick up satelliterelayed signals by means of the small\nhook-on antenna shown instead of\nthe more elaborate-groundequipment\ncustomarily needed. Developed by\nNASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center,\nthe communicator is intended for use\nin emergency situations. It has utility,\nfor example, in disasters, such as\n\nfloods and hurricanes, where power\nfailure disrupts conventional communications; for on-the-spot transmissions from major accident sites; or\nin remote areas where no other\nmeans of communication exists.\nThe system\'s usefulness was demonstrated last summer in a field exercise\nconducted at BaltimoreIWashington\nInternational Airport by the Maryland\nInstitute for Emergency Medical Services. The exercise, one of several\nsimilar demonstrations, simulated a\nmajor accident and assumed that\nlarge numbers of "burn patients" required immediate medical treatment\non the scene. The briefcase communicator, used in conjunction with\nthe ATSB satellite, provided an onthe-spot method of consulting burnspecialist physicians hundreds of\nmiles away in Boston and Chicago. It\nwas used by emergency medical\ntechnicians to describe verbally, and\nto show via slow-scan TV, the conditions of the "patients." In a real\nemergency, patients would be treated\nat the scene by medical technicians\nremotely directed by specialists.\n\n'
