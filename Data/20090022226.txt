b'Exploration Supply Chain Simulation\nThe Exploration Supply Chain Simulation project was chartered by the NASA Exploration\nSystems Mission Directorate to develop a software tool, with proper data, to quantitatively\nanalyze supply chains for future program planning. This tool is a discrete-event simulation\nthat uses the basic supply chain concepts of planning, sourcing, making, delivering, and\nreturning. This supply chain perspective is combined with other discrete or continuous simulation\nfactors. Discrete resource events (such as launch or delivery reviews) are represented as organizational\nfunctional units. Continuous resources (such as civil service or contractor program functions) are\ndefined as enabling functional units. Concepts of fixed and variable costs are included in the model\nto allow the discrete events to interact with cost calculations. The definition file is intrinsic to the\nmodel, but a blank start can be initiated at any time. The current definition file is an Orion Ares I\ncrew launch vehicle. Parameters stretch from Kennedy Space Center across and into other program\nentities (Michaud Assembly Facility, Aliant Techsystems, Stennis Space Center, Johnson Space\nCenter, etc.) though these will only gain detail as the file continues to evolve.\n\nDecision/Data\nModels and\nAnalysis\n\nThe Orion Ares I file definition in the tool continues to evolve, and analysis from this tool is expected\nin 2008. This is the first application of such business-driven modeling to a NASA/government\xe2\x80\x93\naerospace contractor endeavor.\nContacts: Michael C.
