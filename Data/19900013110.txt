Since that time, the limit to the number of neutrinos has been\n,\nreexamined (still finding Nu< 4) (31, and the upper limit to qlo from primordial 7Li has\nof light neutrinos:\n\nbeen slightly tightened (qlo5 5\n\n- 6.4)[4],[5]. Recent measurements of the neutron mean-\n\nlife using ultra-cold neutrons [SI, along with a new compilation o the nuclear reaction\nf\ncross eections relevant to the big-bang reaction network[7], modify the predicted yields of\nprimordial elements as a function of qlo and N- the changes in nuclear physics primarily\n,\naffect \'Li production and the decrease in the neutron mean-life (and its uncertainty) is\nreflected in the \'He yield. In this letter we discuss these changes and their effects as well as\nprovide an assessment of the most reasonable current limits to the primordial abundances.\n\nIn particular we note that the observational data on \'He have improved somewhat and\nseem to constrain Y to a lower value than that used by Yang et d.[l]. We also discuss\n,\nthe relationship between the primordial nucleosynthesis and collider limits to the number\nof neutrinos and show that the LEP and SLC results[9] can be used to constrain the\nprimordial abundance of \'He.\nWe have updated the big-bang nuclear reaction network using the cross sections of\nCaughlan and Fowler[7]and find that \'Li is the only element whose primordial abundance\nchanges noticeably. Low-q production of \'Li decreases due to a decrease in \'He(t,r)\'Li\nand an increase in \'Li(p,a)\'He. The high-q 7Li production increases due to an increase\nin D(d,n)3He. There is also a slight decrease in D+3He production for all values of q due\n\nIn k.1 and k.2, we show the big-bang yields o \'Li, D,\nf\nand 3He (by number relative to hydrogen) for N= 3 or 4 and a neutron mean-life of 889.8\n,\nseconds (r+ = 10.28 minutes) as a function of q (variations in these primordial abundances\ndue to allowed changes in the neutron mean-life are negligible).\nAlthough primordial \'He shows no effects of the changes in the nuclear reaction network, it is sensitive to changes in weak interaction physics. Using ultra-cold neutrons (Le.,\nneutrons with kinetic energies less than the neutron scattering potential of their storage\nto increases in d-d reactions.\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the current status of the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis model, see Walker, Steigman, Schramm and Olive [8]\n\n.\n\n1\n\nvessel[lo]), Mampe et d.[S]\nhave measured the mean-life of stored neutrons to be 887.6 f3\nsec. When combined with earlier measurements of the neutron mean-life[ll], we find for a\nworld average:\n\nr,, = 889.8 f 4.4 sec,\n\n(1)\n\nor a reduction in the neutron half-life to r i = 10.28 f 0.05 minutes. The amount of \xe2\x80\x98He\nproduced in the big-bang depends on the neutron-to-proton ratio when weak interactions\nfreeze-out. A decrease in the neutron half-life is equivalent to an increase in the weak\ninteraction rates, thus leading to a decrease in the neutron-to-proton ratio at freeze-out\nand resulting in less primordial \xe2\x80\x98He. The change in the primordial m s fraction of \xe2\x80\x98He\nas\ndue to changes in the neutron half-life is given by AYP= 0.2(rn- 889.8 sec) /889.8 sec. Note\nthat *2-o changes in r lead to AYp= f0.002. Variations of this magnitude in Ypare also\nfound if radiative and Coulomb corrections to the tree-level weak rates are included[l2].\nThe accuracy of the measured neutron mean-life requires that we include these higher order\ncorrections to the weak rates which we have done2. In fig. 3 we show the mass fraction\nof \xe2\x80\x98He as a function of q for r, = 889.8 f 8.8 seconds and Nu= 3 and 4. A good fit (for\n2.55 qlo\n\n5 10) to primordial \xe2\x80\x98He production in the standard big-bang is\nY = 0.228 + 0.010 In qlo + 0.012(Nu - 3) + 0.185( rn\n,\n\n- 889.8\n889.8\n\n1 9\n\nwhere r, is the neutron mean-life measured in seconds.

Adoption of\n\nthe plateau halo stars as representing the primordial \'Li abundance requires a mechanism\nto increase the disk abundance of Li to 10-e over the history of the galaxy. Two such\nmechanisms (production in Type II supernovae shocks passing thru hydrogen envelopes[161\nor via neutrino synthesis in nupernovae cores[l7]) may be able to account for the disk \'Li\nenhancement. The best argument, however, for believing that the Pop.II abundances do\nin fact represent primordial \'Li i the presence of the narrow \'Li plateau. Stars in the\ns\nplateau cover a range of temperatures and metallicities sufficiently diverse that it seems\nhighly unlikely that a substantial depletion mechanism independent of stellar properties\ncan be found. The 2-0 upper limit from the plateau stars to 12\nlog(\'Li/H) is 2.23\n(\'Li/H< 1.70 x 10"O) and bounds the baryon-twphoton ratio from above (see Fig. 1 ):\n\n+\n\nfor N = 3. From a recent study of depletion models[5] it was concluded that 12 +\n,\nlog(\'Li/H) 5 2.21(2-0) for models with standard isochrones and at most 12 + log(\'Li/H)\n- 2.36 (2-0) for models including diffusion. Thus even with some depletion we have the\nconstraint qlo 5 4.8, for N = 3.\n,\nSince primordial D and \'He are monotonically decreasing functions of the baryon-te\nphoton ratio, an upper limit to their primordial abundance constrains ql0 from below[l].\nDeuterium is easily converted to \'He at temperatures above 6 x lOS0K via D(p,r)\'He\nand, since the pre-main sequence Sun is fully convective, the observation of \'He implanted\nby the solar wind in gas-rich meteorites[l8], on lunar foils[19], and in lunar soils[20], is a\nmeasure of the s u m of pre-solar D and \'He: 1O4(yZs/~,), = 4.03 f 0.19 (where y, is the\ns u m of D and \'He relative to hydrogen, by number, and y4 is the ratio, by number, of \'e\nH\nto hydrogen). Adopting\' y,@ = 0.10 f 0.01, we find conservatively:\n3.11 L 10sy,,O 5 5.06.\n\n(5)\n\nDepending on the history of 9He destruction and production in stellar environments, yZS0\ncan be used to constrain yZSp.

The difference\n\nbetween the lower bound and the amount of visible matter argues that a significant fraction\nof baryons are unlit.\n~~\n\nT i analysis improves on that given in Yang et Or.[l] who assume a single generation\nhs\nof stellar processing. In fact, the single generation assumption would yield a very similar\nlimit: 106y23p< 1 . for c3 2 1/4.\n05\nRecent measurements[23] o the microwave background indicate a temperature of\nf\n2.78 f00\'.\n.1K\n\n4\n\nHaving derived a lower bound on qlo of 2.6 from D+SHe and taking a 2-0 lower bound\nI\n\nto the neutron mean-life we find (using equation (3) )\nN,53.4+20(\n\nYmaz - 0.240\n0,240\n1,\n\nwhere Ypmoz is the 2-0 upper limit to the mass fraction of primordial \xe2\x80\x98He allowed by\nobservation. The size of the numerical coefficient on the Y,term represents the sensitivity\nof primordial \xe2\x80\x98He to the expansion rate. In order to extract the primordial abundance\nof \xe2\x80\x98He from obervations, the \xe2\x80\x98He contribution from stellar nucleosynthesis must be determined. Peimbert and Torres-Peimbert[24] suggested that mch a subtraction might be\naccomplished by correlating the observed \xe2\x80\x98He data with some indicator of metallicity (Z),\n\ndY\nY = Yp+ -2,\ndz\nand extrapolating to zero metallicity. Highly-ionized HI1 regions in low-metallicity galaxies\na.re the measurement of choice and oxygen is the traditional Z indicator. While the oxygen\nseen in these objects is produced by stars having masses\n\n2 12Ma, stellar \xe2\x80\x98He\nthe\n\ncomes\n\nfrom all stars 2 2Maleading to the conclusion that oxygen may not be a good diagnostic\nof stellar \xe2\x80\x98He production[25]. Nitrogen and carbon are produced in intermediate mass stars\nand therefore may more closely track stellar \xe2\x80\x98He production than does oxygen [26]. We\nhave compiled a (Y,N,O) data set with 36 objects (33 objects reviewed by Pagel(271 plus\n3 others) and a (Y,C) data set consisting of 6 objects (5 objects considered by Steigman,\n\nGallagher, and Schramm[26] and 1 other). A linear least-squares fit to these data yields\nthe following:\n\nY = (0.226 f 0.005) + [(1.6 f 0.4)\n\nX\n\n10\xe2\x80\x991-\n\n0\n\n61\n\nN\n+\nC\n= (0.234 f 0.008) + [(2.6 f 2.3) x 102]7j\n\n= (0.230 f 0.004) [(3.0 f 0.7) x 103]7i\n\n(12)\n\nThe errom in the fits are 1-0 with respect to the quoted statistical errors in the observations.\nHowever, because some galaxies are reported with what appear to be underestimated errors\n(systematic errors are generally not included), the fits are quite sensitive to the individual\ndata points. Fluctuations in the fits lead one to believe (this is discussed in great detail\n\n,\nin [8) ) that a fair estimate of the primordial helium abundance is Y = 0.23f0.01. For\n5\n\nYpmaz= 0.240, the upper ound to the number of light neutrino species from primordial\nnucleosynthesis is (from eqn.(lO) )\n\nNu 5 3.4.\n\n(13)\n\nThe cosmological limit is in remarkably good agreement with the results of the LEP\nand SLC e+e- colliders which, when combined in weighted average, find Nu< 3.6 at\nthe 2-0 level[9] Of course, the Zo experiments and the cosmological limits on N are\n,\ncomplementary[28]. The width of the Zo receives contributions from anything that couples\nto the Zo and has a mass < M z / 2 , whereas the coamological limit is sensitive to particles\nwhich contribute to the energy density o the universe during primordial nucleosynthesis.\nf\nIn addition to relativistic neutrinos with m MeV, the energy density at this epoch can\nalso be affected by slightly non-relativistic neutrinos having masses from a few to a few tens\nof MeV(291 or by superweakly interacting particles[30]. Since the experimental number is\nin such good agreement with the cosmological prediction, significant exotica are unlikely.\nHowever, one loophole worth noting is that the experimental limit on the u, mass (< 35\nMeV) could allow the u, to be incorrectly assessed in cosmological counting while still fully\ncontributing to the Zo counting.\nTo summarize, we have shown that recent changes in nuclear cross sections and the\nneutron mean-life produce some modest changes in the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis\npredictions for D, SHe, \'He, and 7Li. The neutron mean-life is now measured to such a\nhigh degree of accuracy that uncertainties in the standard big-bang results are due in large\npart to changes in nuclear physics. For example, if we assume that there are only 3 light\nneutrinos, the standard big-bang predicts a \'He abundance in the range (see Fig. 3 )\n\n.\n\n0.235\n\nY, 5 0.245,\n\nwhere we use the constraints on the baryon-to-photon ratio from D +e\n"\n\n(14)\n\nand \'Li:\n\nIn order to limit the number of tight neutrinos, we need to extract the primordial abundance of \'He from measurements which are aurely contaminated by stellar nucleosynthesis.\nFollowing tradition, we have tried to fit the observations of \'He in metal-poor highly ionized objects to a linear dependence on metallicity, using either carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen\nas the tracers of stellar \'He production. Surprisingly, we find that fits all indicate that Y,=\n0.23f0.01. We cannot infer a "2-0 upper-limitn to Ypbecause large systematic errors dom-\n\ninate. I indeed the upper limit to primordial \'He is 0.24, then big-bang nucleosynthesis\nf\nconstrains the number of light neutrino species: Nu< 3.4.\n6\n\n,\n\nAcknowledgemento\nGS profited from correspondence with B.
