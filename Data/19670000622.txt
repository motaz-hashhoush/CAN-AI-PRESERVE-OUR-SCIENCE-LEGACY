It was found during studies that only 60% of\nthe propellant was available for the accelerating\nprocess. This efficiency loss was attributed to a sluggish valve controlling the propellant injection into\nthe thrustor.\nThe solution:\nA miniature solenoid valve, utilizing advanced ferromagnetic core design which meets all the rapidacting requirements with a minimum of input energy.\nWith concise packaging, the entire valve, including its\nenergy-storage capacitor and switching electronics, fits\ninto one cubic inch. The mechanical operation is\nsimple, eliminating part wear and maintenance.\nHow it's done:\nThe valve consists of a toroidal core wound with\n40 turns of wire. A 60 0 sector of the core is cut out\nand mounted on a Be-Cu diaphragm to serve as a\nmovable armature. This diaphragm also provides the\nrestoring force toward the null position. A 5-mm\ndiameter hemispherical plug, mounted on the armature, seats against an 0-ring to form the valve\nclosure. The valve is fed from, a 125-microfarad electrolytic capacitor, charged to voltages between 20 v\n\nMovable Armature\n\nand 150 v, and is switched with a silicon-controlled\nrectifier.\nNotes:\n1. This valve has been successfully tested through 28\nmillion cycles at a frequency of 100 cycles/sec without seal deterioration. The valve operates on 0.1\njoule of energy and opens or closes in about 100\nmicroseconds.\n. This valve can be used in any flow control application requiring a high degree of reliability, small\nsize, and fast response.\n3.
