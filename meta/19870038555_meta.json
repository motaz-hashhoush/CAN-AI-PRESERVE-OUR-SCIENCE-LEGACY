Losses can occur either from a reduction in the array electrical performance or with nonoptimal extraction of power from the array. Electrical performance degradation is caused by electrical mismatch, transmission losses from cell surface soiling and steep angle of reflectance, and electrical losses from field wiring resistance and the voltage drop across blocking diodes. The second type of loss, concerned with the operating points of the array, can involve nonoptimal load impedance and limiting the operating envelope of the array to specific ranges of voltage and current. Each of the loss mechanisms are discussed and average energy losses expected from soiling, steep reflectance angles and circuit losses are calculated.", "title": "Photovoltaic array loss mechanisms", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870038555, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gonzalez, Charles"}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena , United States"}}, "id": "ee6cc92a1ec84254a700c310ad0155e8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870038555, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1016/0379-6787(86)90136-5", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "18", "submissionId": 19870038555, "issn": "0379-6787", "id": "54430d039b5b4a73ae9459e64a6ed26f", "publicationName": "Solar Cells", "publicationDate": "1986-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
