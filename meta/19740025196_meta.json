Passive concepts were demonstrated analytically for both the forward and intertank compartments, and a worst case external heating environment was determined for use during the study. The thermal control system specifications and designs which resulted from the research are shown.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740025196, "id": "3c4f1e85c5c54377a21ae4bad4920e9f", "publicationDate": "1974-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740025196.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740025196/downloads/19740025196.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740025196/downloads/19740025196.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740025196/downloads/19740025196.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
