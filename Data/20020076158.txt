b'ny computer game joystick jockey will tell you:\nIt\'s all in the touch. But a new technology called\nForce Feedback is adding vivid physical "feel"\nsensations to computer entertainment systems.\n"Get a grip" takes on added dimension in the fastpaced, virtual world of computer gaming. Experience\nthe recoil from shooting a gun in virtual reality Perceive\nthe jarring bounce, bump, and vibration while driving\nover simulated road terrain. Feel the reaction of your\ncomputerized dragster as it slams into the race track\nwd.\nI-FORCE" is a computer peripheral from Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California. This Silicon\nValley-situated high-technology firm has taken interaction to a new dimension-one that literally comes alive\nin your hands.\nI-FORCE was derived from virtual environment\nand human factors research and done at the Advanced\nDisplays and Spatial Perception Laboratory at Ames\nResearch Center, in collaboration with Stanford\nUniversity\'s Center for Design Research.\nEntrepreneur Louis Rosenberg, a former Stanford\nresearcher, now president of Immersion Corporation,\nAn early Force Feedback\nprototype was derivedfiom\nwork done at NASA\'s\nAdvanced Displays and\nSpatial Perception\nLaboratoy.\n\ncredits much of the knowledge acquired to move Force\nFeedback into the commercial world to the NASAuniversity joint research efforts. Rosenberg collaborated\nwith Dr. Bernard Adelstein at Ames on studies of\nperception in virtual reality. Immersion Corporation\nadapted the basic qualities of Force Feedback: the\ncrispness of initial contact, the hardness of surface\nrigidity, and the cleanness of final release, all in a virtual\nenvironment.\n"It took us three years and much innovation, but\nImmersion can now produce consumer Force Feedback\n\nproducts," Rosenberg says. The result was an inexpensive way to incorporate motors and a sophisticated\nmicroprocessor into joysticks and other game controllers. These devices can emulate the feel of a car on the\nskid, a crashing plane, the bounce of a ball, compressed\nsprings, or other physical phenomenon.\nImmersion anticipates that the technology has the\npotential to increase the realism of the game environment and provide a more engaging and entertaining\nexperience. By adding physical sensations to the toolbox\nof perceptual effects\nImmersion Corporationhas\nthat game developcommercialized Force\ners have at their\nFeedback technology and\ndisposal, Immersion\nadded the sensation offeel\ntojoysticks used in computer\ncontends that new\nsimuhtion games. NASA\'s\nlife can be breathed\nwork in advanced dh-play\ninto common video\ntechnologiesplayed a\ngame paradigms. In\ncentqiece in the concept.\nessence, may the\nforce be with you.\n"Force Feedback will make the\nabstract world of\nsoftware tangible,\n"\n-.-ra\nphysical, and\npersonal. It\'s not\njust visual any more!" exclaims promotional material\nfrom the company.\nTo run I-FORCE, Immersion developed a Force\nFeedback software protocol known as the I-FORCE\nAPI. The I-FORCE hardware and electronics architecture has been licensed to numerous manufacturers of\ncomputing peripherals. The first products incorporating\nthe I-FORCE technology appeared in 1996.\nFor example, CH-Products of Vista, California\nembodied the I-FORCE technology into their popular\nline of Flightstick and Combatstick controllers. Many\nmore products from various vendors using I-Force are to\nfollow as major hardware manufacturers have endorsed\nthe Force Feedback concept.\nImmersion\'s Rosenberg predicts that Force Feedback may go far beyond joysticks, such as a tool for\nhandicapped people to escort unsteady hands or literally\npushing open doors during a cyber-tour of a house for\nsale. Already, Immersion offers the Virtual Laparoscopic\nInterface" that can hone the skills of a surgeon through\nrealistic surgical simulations. In a similar fashion, the\ndelicate nature of catheter-based procedures are also\nbeing targeted as an emerging simulation.\n\n.\n,\n\n1\n1\n\n5-\n\nTM\n\nI-FORCE and Virtual Laparoscopic Interface are trademarks of\nImmersion Corporation.\n\nCommercial bnefits-Spin&\n\n'
