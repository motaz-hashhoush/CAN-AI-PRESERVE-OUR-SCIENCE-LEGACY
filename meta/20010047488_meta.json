This light comes in many different colors, the sum of which comprises what is commonly I known as the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. Unfortunately, the earth's atmosphere blocks almost all of wavelengths in the EM spectrum. Only the visible (400-700 mn) and radio (approx. 1-150 m) \"windows\" are accessible from the ground, and thus have the longest observational \"history.\" These early restrictions on the observational astronomer also gave rise to classifying \"kinds\" of astronomy based on their respective EM portion, such as the term \"radio astronomy.\"", "title": "Kinds of Astronomy-5", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:28:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010047488, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ennico, Kimberly"}, "organization": {"name": "Arizona Univ.", "location": "Tucson, AZ United States"}}, "id": "bde3f2e87b0449958a165f6b194d3be8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20010047488, "meta": {"author": {"name": "DeVincenzi, D."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "dd7d6f01a41644d7aa618c23a784c9e7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010047488, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010047488, "id": "2382354367a84ca2a7e49f78333291a6", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010047488.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010047488/downloads/20010047488.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010047488/downloads/20010047488.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010047488/downloads/20010047488.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
