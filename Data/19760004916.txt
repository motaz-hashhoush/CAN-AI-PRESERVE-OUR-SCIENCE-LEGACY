b'driver\'s license. But for that very reason they\nmay not be accessible to the elderly, the young,\nthe poor, or the handicapped who require some\nform of puolic transportation by air, rail, or\nhighway.\nA second concept of evaluation is\nreliability. All forms of transportation are\ngenerally mechanically reliable. Aircraft,\nhowever, are much more vulnerable to weather\nthan the other modes. Localities with severe\nweather conditions may find a corresponding\nlack of reliability in air service. Under some\nconditions, however, air service may be more\nreliable than highway modes.\nThe third concept is adaptability to both\nload and terrain. General aviation is not as well\nadapted to bulk loads as are trucks or boxcars.\nBuses and cars suffer a similar limitation. Terrain, except the most rugged, poses little problem to aircraft, however.\nRouting flexibility is the fourth concept. Except for r ~ i (and water) transportation, most\nl\nmodes can reach most areas.\nFifth, the cost of using the various modes is\nalso discussed in Chapter II. The importance of\nthis factor depends on the socio-economic\ncharacteristics of the citizens of the community,\nsome of whom could afford to use one mode but\nnot another. Economics must also be considered in the light of the importance of time\nand comfort. Americans tend to consider the\nfull-size automobile as a standard of comfort.\n\nDeveloping The Plan\nIntroduction\nSo far this chapter has discussed the factors involved in deciding whether or not the\ncommunity needs the services of general aviation and in formulating a plan to meet any such\nneeds. That a plan is to be forinulated implies\nthat a prelimiinary decision has been made by\nthe community that it needs the services being\nplanned.\nSuch a preliminary decision is little more\nthan an educated guess, especially since it is\nbased on a subjective estimation of community\ngoals which, typically are difficult to determine\nsince they are rarely discussed. They exist\nmore in behavior patterns and in basic assumptions than in words. A decision-maker is more\nlikely to discover the goals which certain individuals or groups advocate for the community\nthan those of the community as a whole.\nThe difficulty of discovering community\ngoals is compounded by the lack of citizen\nrasponse to less-than-concrete plans and to invitations to become involved in the esrly stages\n\nof the planning process. As plans become more\nconcrete, citizens are more likely to respond,\nonly to discover that their role is simply to applaud or oppose the developed plans but not to\ncontribute to them. Conquently, community\nleaders must take steps to involve citizens in\nthe formulation of plans as early as possible in\nthe planning process. If done successfully,\ncitizens will have an opportunity to articulate\ntheir goals and to incorporate them into the\ndeveloping plans.\nSuch an effort runs contrary to an\nauthoritarian leadership style in which a decision is made and then announced to the community. A democratic approach, seeking community input before the decision is reached is\nantithetical and seems to be slow, frustrating,\nand bogged down in endless discussion.\nLeadership seeking community involvement enables the community to discover its\ngoals during the process of planning; the "endless discussion" becomes a method of incorporating those goals. If, indeed, the discussion\nis endless, one could argue that the proposed\npublic project is not. rnsonant with community\ngoals but stems, instead, from some special interest.\nThere are several benefits to community involvement. Once a plan is formulated, it is\nunlikely to be bogged down by unanticipated\nopposition, lawsuits, and action groups,\nbecause all interests have been consulted. The\ncooperation involved in formulating the plan\nwill promote a sense of community pride and\nawareness. Furthermore, the goals discovered\nthrough such a process will provide guidelines\nfor future planning efforts. One gains thoroughness of decision-making by sacrificing speed.\nWhile the ideal of full citizen participation\nin planning may be unrealizable presently, it\ncan be approximated by publicizing the plancomments, and holding\nning process, solic~ting\nwell-announced public hearings before making\ndecisions at crucial points in the planning process, as well as by conducting surveys to determine local preferences.\nIn addition to citizen participation, a second principle of planning is comprehensiveness. Satisfying the needs for general aviation\nservices should be part of the overall community development effort.\nChapter I provides a useful outline of the\nmany steps necessary in the planning process.\nThe basic sequence in the planning development process will be discussed here. It consists\nof (1) describing alternative ways of satisfying\nestimated needs, (2) evaluating the alternatives\n\nand selecting one, (3) developing a plan to implement the selected alternative. (4) measuring\nthe physical, economic, social, and political impacts of the selected plan on the community, (5)\nevaluating the impacts which have been projected, and (6) revising the plan on the basis of\nthe assessed and evaluated irnpai\'s. This section will deal with the first three steps in the\nbasic sequence.\n\nAlternatives\nOnce the needs have boen identified, planners should devise a variety of ways. if possible, to satisfy those needs. Alternatives will\nhave to be evaluated on the basis of the existing\nresources of the community. Consequently, the\nfirst step IS h list the estimated needs and the\nsecond is to take an iriventory of those factors\nin the community which may contribute to need\nsatisfaction.\nThe needs may be satisfied by other means\nthan the acquisition of access to general aviation facilities. Better transportation ot people\nandlor goods may be obtained by the acquisition of bus, truck. or railway service, or simply\nby improving the local highway system or access i o interstate routes.\nSometimes, however, in?portantneeds cannot be met without the acquisition of better access to a general aviation facility. It is possible\nthat a nearby community has an airport which\nwould be suitable. On3 plan might be to imprave access to that airport by instituting taxi or\nlimousine servlce or by building or improving\nan access r3ad to such an airport. If such an\nairport exists nearby hut does not provide the\nservlces required, one plan might be to join\nwith the neighboring community to improve\ntheir airport, in effect making it a regional airport.\nAnother alternative IS for the community to\ncsnstruct or expand its o!\'.n a~rport.\nThen two\nimportan! sets of alternatives arise. The airport\nmay be the local community\'s or it may be established through a regional authority or commission. Again, the airport may be constructed\nto FAA specifications or it may be built using\nother standards. (The implications of this alternative have been discussed above.)\nEach of the various alternatives relevant to\nthe local situation (and outlined in the preceding portions of this chapter) should each be formulated in terms of the needs it satisfies, the\ncosts and revenues, and the community goals ~t\nsewes.\nEvaluation and Selection of Alternatives\nBrief descr;ptions of methods for com-\n\nmunity need satisfaction will serve as the basis\nfor involvins !he c~mmunityin the decisionmaking process. 1he fact that a plan is in\nprogress should be ,?ublicized and local civic\nservice organizations should be notified about\nthe tentative plan choice. The plans should be\nmade easily available and written comments\nshould be solicited. Finally a public hearing on\nthe alternatives shculd be announced. After the\nwill have\npublic hearing, the decis~on-makers\nsome basis on which to select the most desirable alternative.\n\nDevelopment of Preliminary Plan\nUnless the alternative selected involves\nbuilding or expanding an airport, it falls outside\nthe scope of this report. If a new airport is\nchosen, a preliminary p l m milst be developed.\nThis plan should be drjveloped by considering\nvarious alternatives In the light of the factors\nmentioned earlier in this chapter. Planning\ndevelopment is covered more thoroughly in\nChapters I, II, IV, and V. Among the factors to\nbe considered are the sponsor, funct~on,form,\nfunding, and site of the airport. Alternatives\nshould be considered for each item.\nOnce several alternative plans have been\ndrawn up, community input should be solicited\nagain In an effort to provide clues to unexpected impacts of thc various alternatives. After\nthis solicitation the plans should be assessed\nand evaluated in terms of their impacts as discussed in the next section.\n\nIMPACTS\nThis section will deal only with the impacts\nof airports upon the community. Chapter II\nidentified and d~scussed\nmany of the physical\nimpacts of general aviation, including noise\nwater quality, and land use. In this\nlevel, air a ~ i d\nsection economic, social, and poli -al effects\nwill be considered. Some ecorimvb ;mpacts of\na proposed airport will havs been included in\nthe plans as a projected demand for ysccral\naviation servlces and as en examination of the\nof\neconomic and flscal capabil~ties the comgeneral aviamunity. As Chapter II ~ndicated,\ntion airports frequently operate i ~at loss and the\nsubsldy they receive is after, justifled on the\nbasis of hooed-for secqndary impact, such as\nindustrial development.\nOnce probable impacts have been identifled. ~tIS necessary to recorsider the questior,\nof community need At that point the publ~c\nIS\nmost l~kely become ~ i i o u s ; /Interested In\nto\nthe planning since people tend to react only to\nprojects which are relatively concrete.\n\nThe Use Of Airports\nTo Attract Industry\nIt has been argued that airports and\ngeneral aviation services are a necessity if a\nsmall city or town is to expand or retain its present industrial base. Since many small towns\nbelieve that industrialization is the answer to\ntheir problems, they may be led to invest their\ndevelopment efforts in aviation facilities rather\nthan in other areas. The arguments in favor of\naviation development and the likely consequences of industrialization should be considered by any town seekina revitalization.\nThe problems of small towns which lead\nthem to seek new industry are generally the\nresuIt of the trends toward the mechanization of\nagriculture and the urbanization of the population. Mechanization increases agricultural productivity per worker so that fewer !arm workers\nare needed. Workers not needed either migrate\nfrom rural areas or remain to become\nDeclining\nunemployed or ~ n d e r e r n p l o y e d . ~ ~\npopulation is bad for business. Local businesses leave, thereby degrading the qual~tyof\nmore attractive\nrural life and making the c~ties\nfor those who remaln. As the population of the\ncountryside declines, local industries may\nleave ~fthey depend on local markets6\' Communities believe that added industry would attract nev jopulation, increase the tax base, and\ncreate more disposable income, all of wh~ch\nwould improve the social and economic quality\nof life.\nProponents of general aviation Prgue that\nthe availability of alr transportation will promote\neconomic growth by (1) attracting new industry,\nestablished business and industry\n(2) help~ng\nsurplus rarm labor).\nexpand (thereby employ~ng\nand (3) retaining present industry.68\nThis view is\nbased on the expanding use of business\naircraft and on the trend of industry to avoid the\n--\n\n-\n\n** Federal A v ~ a t ~ oAdrnlntstratton.

The commission also\nargued that "it has been factually established\nthat few businesses are willing to build plants\nand other facilities in a community that has no\nairport."\'O The same direct relationship between aviation activity and economic development has been suggested by the FAA which indicated that (a) the airport is a direct economic\nasset to the community because firms require\naviation services. and that (b) "oocumented\ncases" show that the existence of an airport is a\ncontrolling factor in the decisions of industries\nto vove in or out of a community." The FAA.\nhowever, has not presented the "documented\ncases" that support the suggested critical influence of an airport In plant locat~on. addiIn\ntlon, the type of ciocumentation that is available\nis frequently questionable from a methodological point of view An example is a 1965 sarvey\nof 500 co~vmunit~es\nconducted by the Texas\nAeronautics Commlsslon. The commission reported that it asked communities whether or not\nindustry and business had located there due to\nthe exls!ence of an airport and found that all of\nthe commun~ties the 50.000-100.000 populain\ntion range responded yes. while only 36.3 percent of the commun~tiesin the 2,000-5.000\npopulation range responded yes One would\nexpect the larger commun~ties have access\nto\nto an airport and to rat~onallzethe airport In\nterms of the needs of the busmess community.\nin\nThis IS probably a good example of the b ~ a s\naviation studies that Jeremy Warford referred to\nin his study entitled Public Policy Toward\nGeneral Aviation.

There is a rich supply of\nknowledge available in local universities,\nresearch institutions, and engineering firms. At\nhand are advertising agencies, sophisticated financing, utilities, and transportation. In addition metropolitan areas benefit from the external economiss of agglomeration and from the\ncultural amenities which can only be supported\nby a largc population. Small communities often\npresent problems to industry. They may provide\nlow levels of public service and few opportunities for contact with customers, supplier:,\nand other producers. Local labor may not be\neasily trained due to lower levels of education;\nmanagement and executive personnel are\ns\nunlikely to be available. Also, there 1 likely to\nbe a lack of mechanical and construction\nworkers, of housing, and of other facilitie~.\'~\nIt is important to keep in mind that the national economy is becoming more and more\nservice oriented. Thus, while one-third to onehalf of new manufacturing plants open in small\nor non-metropolitan communities goods-related employment has dropped from one-half of\nthe non-agricultural total to 26 percent.\'\' In the\npast, many industries located near raw\nmaterials, but today only seven percent of the\nlabor force is estimated to be near such\nresources; consequently, industries tend to\nlocate near consumers and capital.

Shively studied 330 responses to\na survey of Nebraska industrial plants. The\nmost important factors determining industrlal\nlocation decisions includedquallty, availability.\nand cost of labor and the existence of a rightto-work law in the state; highway transportation\nand proximity of markets; reliability of electrical\nservice and availability of natural gas;\navailability of sites; and the fact that the peopla\nwho started the plant lived in the area. (See Table Ill-V.) A consultant indicated that small\ncommunities attractive to industry had good\nhighways with ready access to Interstate\nrcutes; - strong and intelligent community\nleadership; a lack of domination by a single industry; a good supply of labor; a big city within\n50 miles; and unforbidding terrain.

What then\nare the impacts of industrialization likely to be?\nThe answer to thls ques!ion depends on the\nnature of the community and on the new industry, but there are certain factors which can give\na general indication of the probable effects.\nFirst, the favorable economic impacts of\nthe new flrm may be less than antic~pated.\nCommunities often seek industry In order to\nbring in more money a;ld improve business\nwlth the payroll of the new firm. Thus, each dollar of payroll will generate income for others as\nit is spent. If the new Industry IS to be a slgniflcant economlc benefit thls mult~pl~cative\neffect\nshould be large. Unfortunately. the smaller the\ncommunity, the smaller the multlpller, because\nthe money flows out of a small community faster\nthan out of a larger one. So while the multiplier\nfor investment dollars is taken to be about\nlevel. the mult~pller\nshrlnks\nseven on a nat~onal\nto three or four at the state level. The local communlty. ~f small, can count on very llttle from\nthis ~ ! . ~ l t ~ p l ~ c a t ~ o n . ~ ~\nThe loss of payroll mult~pl~cation due to\nIS\n;he "leakags" of money oui of the community\nor the fallure 3f the payroll to represent new\nmone!. A majcr cause of leakage is the portion\nof the work rorce composed of non-resident\ncommuters who take their paychecks out of the\ncommunity In which the firm 1 located and\ns\nspend it elsewhere. In the case of one steel\nplant, 83 percent of the work force resides in\ncountles other than that i r ~\nwhich the plant is lo-\n\ncated. Again, the local residents who commute\nto jobs 9uts1de the community, may quit their\nold jobs to take new ones at the new local plant.\nExcept for the increase in their wages, their\ntake-home pay represents no new money coming into the community, since they were already\nbringing it in from the jobs to whlch they pre.~\nviously c g m r n ~ t e dSimilar considerations a p\nply to those on welfare or unemployment-that\nportion of the payroll which really r, -esents\nnew money may not be spent locally unless an\nadequate economlc I n f r a s t r u c t u r e has\ndeveloped. locals may travel to larger towns or\nuse mall-order catalogs to shop because of the\nexpense and lack of variety of goods locally.\nl\nMoney saved ~n ~ c abanks may also represent\nleakage since commercial paper may be more\nattractive than local ~nvestment.~~\nConsequently. communities should not accept new plant locations without evaluating the\nprospective industrys The most importznt\nquestions In this regard are the kind and source\nof labor. Will the plant require labo: of e sort\navailable locally or will a large number of the\nworkers commute? One plant located :n Appalachla employed 3.000 workers who commuted to the plant from 27 counties in two\nstates9\' Some companles prefer their workers\nto live out of town in order to reduce local\npublic servlce needs and consequent taxes on\nthe f ~ r r n .Will the new industry employ workers\n*~\nwho are now unemployed or underemployed. or\nwill it simply increase competltlon for those\nalready employed?

The potential stress on\nlocal public services has been mentioned in\npassing. Paying for increased services cen be a\nfinancial strain o n a small community,\nespecially if the new industry has been offered\ntax incentives to locate in that area.

Runoff can tax the\nsewer or storm system, cause erosion, and\nflood basements.lo3\nThere are social and political consequences to be considered as well.

Economics lead to political consequences as well. If a town builds an airport with\nhopes of industrial development the reputation\nof the responsible community leaders may rise\nor fall as industry arrives or fails to appear In\naddition. the cost of constructing an unwarranted airport will either result in higher taxes\nor lower levels of local services.\nIf the airport does help to bring in industry,\nthe community may find that its life style has\nchanged. for example, from serii-rural to semiindustrial lite. Since new industries could be\nexpected to draw employees from the surroundthe\ne\ning cour~tryside, new l ~ f style would involve\ndaily commuting. which in turn may lead to r i s h\nhours. traffic jams, new road construction. and\nforce to handle the trafflc\nan increased pol~ce\nThis will result in some increased stress. as will\nthe change from a farm life to an industrial discipline.\nShould significan! growth take place the\nlocality would be called upon to prov~de\nthe\nhigher level of government service typical of a\n.\nsmall c ~ t yIt IS likely that local taxes, after an initial decrease in rate to take into account the\nadded base due to new industry. would once\nagaln begln to cl~mb.\nSocial and economic impacts will of\ncourse bary depend~ngon the nature of the\ncommunity involved. In a large metropolltan\narea, the effects of addlng a small general aviation a~rport\nwould be mlnimal com2ared to the\narea\'s entire economv and soc~tlty If the\ngeneral aviat~on alrport IS really a new\nmetropol~ian\nairport suitable for alr carrler service. the effects would be larger and are rather\nwell studied In an Isdated urban area. there\nmay be a large eccnomlc effect and a smaller\nsocial impact since the lrfe style ,s already Industrlal and urban\nThere are also some consequences whlch\nseem to be reiatlvely Independent of the eco-\n\nrlomlc variables. They are hard to measure and\nf?llprimarily into a category which one could\n\ncall community solidarity or community interaction. Despite the difficulties of measurement.\nthese factors can be extremely important in the\nquality of life of the community.\nIn order to build an airport under the Ohio\nplan, a community had to seek it actively by\ndeveloping plans and raising money. I t\ntherefore became more organized than it had\nbeen in order to acquire the airport. Leaders\nhad to promote, persuade. and generate communlty c o n c e n s ~ s In effect the communlty\n.~~~\nunited around a project and the project became\na symbol of the community. While the airport\nmay not put the community on the map in the\neyes of the rest of the world, it makes the community feel that it is on the map: the airport\nbecomes a source of civic pride and identification.\nThe airpcrt In Vinton County, Ohio.\nbecame a more lasting example of thls theme.\nVinton\'s alrport became its community center. a\nplace where art exhlbits and other cultural and\nrecreat~onal\nevects take place.lo9\nAga~n airthe\nport serves as cr way of bringing people\ntogether and making them proud of their community.\nThese characteristics of the local airport\nfrom its mere creado not follow automat~cally\ntion; they are highly dependent on the planning\nprocess, becomlng possible with full citizen\nparticipation. Positive benefits also depend on\ncomprehensive planning and land use. \'JVith\nproper planning and implementation an economically-warranted airport can become something of dlrect value to many cltlzens. slnce\nothers besides businessmen and pilots will be\nusers of the facility. Such direct benefits are\nmore easily perceived than those indirect\nbenefits whlch flow from the addit~onal\nindustry\nan alrport may generate.\nIt IS important to polnt out. however, that\nsuch benefits as these may be derived from\nthings other than a ~ r p o r t s t h eccmmunlty\ncould unite around buildlng a community\ncenter, a water supply system, or a recreational\narea. If other circumstances do not warrant an\nairport. the above mentioned social benefits\nalone do not justify it either.\n\nRe-Evaluation\nOnce the various plans have been studied\nand their probable ~mpactsdeterm~ned,the\n\'O\'\n\nFarnsworth. op o r . p 24\n\n\'O*\n\nStebb~ns.op o r . p 42\n\ncommunity has developed a new awareness of\nthe issues involved in providing general aviation services. !t is likely that groups within the\ncommunity have become interested in the\nissue, and that anti-, pro-, and neutral-airport\nsentiments have developed. It is reasonable to\nassume that ?here could be a significant\ndifference between the estimate of community\nneeds made at the time of the initial decision to\ninitiate the planning process, and that which\ncould be made now in the light of concrete\nfacts, plans, and additional community inputs.\nDecision-makers must take advantage of this\nopportunity to re-evaluate their original findings. Consider, for example, the case where the\nplans cal! for the construction or expansion of\nan airport. The airport is now more than a\ndream: ~t is an actual plan with estimated\nbenefits and costs and projected physical.\nso~.al,\npolitical, and economic impacts. It has\nattracted the attention of numerous individuals\nin the community. One of three possible paths\nmight now be pursued: the plan may be dropped, revised, or Implemented as is.\nThe same methods described earlier in this\nchapter may be used to stimulate the incorporainputs into the decision-makrng\ntion of c~tizen\nprocesspubl~cizing plans, soliciting comthe\nments, and holding public meetings.\nImpacts are not necessarily exclusively\ngood or bad. Even among those undesirable\nimpacts, some will be worse than others. How\nimportant is ~t to the community. for example,\nthat the alrport IS likely to increase the noise\nlevel In certain areas by a given amount? In the\ncase of social and economic impacts, evaluatlon is even more difficult. If ~tseems likely that\nan alrport will attract industry and increase the\nsize of the conmunity. then the communlty\nmust decide on the desirability of such an Impact. What value does the community place on\nthe pride that may go with having an airport?\nThe community will have to determine the\nposslble degree of relationship between\ngeneral aviation and each gf a var~etyof factors. It mu?r also evaluate the relative importance of tht3e factors In the !ight of community\nbenefit or\ngoals. The evaluation of the ove~all\ndlsbeneflt of the impact of a general avlation\nairport on the community is a cornplex matter.\nSeveral evaluative techniques are available, but\nnone of them is completely satisfactory.\nOne approach is to develop "before-andafter" scenarios describing the community with\nand without the facility, in terms of such factors\nas expanded industry, population growth. tax\nvalues, and the like. These scenarios could\n\nthen be evaluated subjectively by the community, in the light of its goals and objectives\nThis method assumes the genera; aviation\nfacility to be the only influencing variable in\nsocial and economic development and tends to\nneglect other equally impc r! factors In rhe\ncommunity\'s development s ~ ~ ~ ralso tends\nIt t .\nto neglect those real values within the sociocultural framework of the community hizh are\nneither economic nor quantifiable. Ano:?er\nmethod is that of "cost-benefit analysis," which\nweighs economic and social benefits against\neconomic and social costs. The analysis is conducted after dollar values are assigned to all\nnon-monetary costs and benefits. The artificial\nquantification of such fectors as the value of\nhuman life and the quality of the environment,\nhowever, can lead to questionable, or at the\nleast controversial, conclusio~s.\nA reasonable approach to impact evaluation therefore. seems to be one in which both\nmonetary and non-monetary factors can be\nanalyzed withln a framework that maintalrls a\nviable separation between the two. yet overs insight into the interaction between them. Such a\nframework is that cf "cost-effectiveness." in\nwhlch the direct and indirect non-monetary\ncosts or benefits of a given course of action are\nevaluated relatl~e the monetary costs. Each\nto\nalternative plan could thus be ranked in accor-\n\n:\ndance with the degree to which i satisfies\ngiven community goals. Tradeoffs between the\nlevels of satisfaction of different competing.\nand sometimes nontradictory, community goals\nmust be considered by the planners, decisionmzkers, arld the community at large. The decision is basically one in which the community\nhas to make a choice between alternative options leading to different ic\'xitifiable futures,\ngiven t\'ie costs associated with these options.\nSuch anaiyses and decisions are usually made\nin the political arena, in accordance with the\nprocesses of social choice prevailing in the\ncommunity.\n\nThe re-evaluation of community needs and\ngoals might show that the facility is not warranted after all. !t may, on the other hand. accentuate the need for the facility. The reevaluation can form the basis for a determination of the types of desirable impacts to be encouraged. As revised and amended plans are\ndeveloped, impacts must be re-assessed In\norder to make certain !hat no new negative impacts are introduced, and that the replanned\nfacility has both mitigated the negative and\naugmented the positive expected impacts. The\niterative process of glanning, assessi,ig impacts, and re-evaluatingshould contlnue until a\nsatisfactory plan IS obtained\n\n'
