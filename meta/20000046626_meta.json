This study followed previous DGCA research on the topic but included more airports in much more detail. The main purpose of this new benchmark study was to provide insight into the levels and types of airport charges worldwide and into recent changes in airport charge policy and structure, This paper describes the 1996 analysis. It is intended that this work be repeated every year in order to follow developing trends and provide the most up-to-date information possible.", "title": "Benchmark Airport Charges", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T14:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000046626, "meta": {"author": {"name": "deWit, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "bbe616d6cbb4426e81332cb48827d819"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000046626, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cohn, N."}, "organization": {"name": "Hague Consulting Group", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "012db7f7cb45446c96c8547aa7c93b72"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000046626, "publications": [{"volume": "4", "submissionId": 20000046626, "issue": "2", "issn": "1093-8826", "publisher": "Aviation Inst., Univ. of Nebraska", "id": "9a48bce1924941d6a24d7a02b292143b", "publicationName": "Journal of Air Transportation World Wide", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
