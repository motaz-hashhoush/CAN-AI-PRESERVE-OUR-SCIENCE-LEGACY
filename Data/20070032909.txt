The root of concern with food security, defined as secure\naccess at all times to sufficient food (WorldBank, 1986), can be traced back to the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights in 1948, which recognized the right to food as a core element of an\nadequate standard of living (UnitedNations, 1948). Determining the vulnerability of a\npopulation to food insecurity is of interest not only to prevent suffering among the local\npopulation due to food shortages but also, through early intervention, to limit the expense of\nameliorating that shortfall.\nThe US Agency for International Development\xe2\x80\x99s Famine Early Warning System Network\n(FEWS NET) uses social science methodologies to monitor food security. Because many\ncountries experience significant interannual rainfall variability and thus variability in food\nproduction, spatial data with country-wide coverage is essential, not just the data from the few\nmeteorological stations that are typically available in these countries. The spatial data are\nobtained from satellite vegetation remote sensing and are often integrated in global information\nsystems (GIs) for analyses. The success of famine early warning is determined by its capability\nof applying the data to complex decision-making, often conducted in times of crisis. Currently\nmuch of the interpretation of the data is qualitative and depends on \xe2\x80\x9cconvergence of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d,\nthat is confirmation through multiple indicators that move in the same direction, to reach\nconsensus at a variety of scales. In order to advance the skill of prediction, objective indicators\nare needed that integrate data using mechanistic relationships to determine the scope and extent\nof an emergency (Buchanan-Smith and Davies, 1995).\n\n3\n\nEarly warning systems have recently integrated analysis of food access and food\navailability. Moseley (2001) describes this \xe2\x80\x98third wave of innovation\xe2\x80\x99 as an integrated approach\nthat identifies homogeneous livelihood zones within each country with explicit knowledge\nregarding the sources of income and food for the demographic groups in each zone (Downing,\n1991; Kennedy and Payongayong, 1992; Moseley and Logan, 2001; FEWS, 2005). By\nanalyzing people\xe2\x80\x99s access to food and income as well as their other options for coping with\nadverse events and processes, the livelihoods approach improves judgments of the types and\nmagnitude of the food security problems (Boudreau, 1998; Seaman et al., 2000; Mathys, 2005).\nFor example, the livelihood of those who are reliant on rainfed agriculture for both food and\nincome depends both on production and rising grain prices.\nEarly and effective intervention depends on appropriate information and preparation,\nincluding :\nMonitoring of the biophysical conditions of the growing season with satellite observations of\nvegetation and rainfall, interpreted qualitatively and with models such as crop models.\ne\n\nMonitoring of the local economic and political situation to locate regions experiencing\nabove-normal food prices coupled with reductions in normal coping strategies such as a\nreduced local or national government ability to respond.\n\ne\n\nContingency planning and scenario development that ensure national governments and\nregional organizations are prepared to respond appropriately when monitoring indicates that\ninterventions may be beneficial.\n\nCurrent food security problems are often monitored using current remote and local observations\nof food security conditions. These observations are used to develop immediate food aid need\n\n4\n\nassessments and therefore they need to have a high degree of accuracy and precision. More\nsophisticated approaches such as modeling are rarely used because the focus is typically on\ncurrent crises.\nIn the past five years planning and preparation for crises, particularly in regions that\nexperience problems frequently, has increased in importance (FEWS, 2006). Clearly\nanticipation of fbture problems makes for better integration with humanitarian aid sources that\nrequire lengthy negotiation, early purchasing, mobilization, and shipping of food aid (personal\ncommunication, Richard Choularton, Chemonics FEWS NET, 2006). The necessary precision\nof the information needed for planning and forecasts of possible future food insecurity is far\nlower than that required to estimate current food aid needs. Recent research has enabled the\nprojection of vegetation index dynamics up to four months into the future (Funk and Brown,\n2006) that could be incorporated into operational analyses of food security. The purpose of the\nwork presented here is to develop methods to apply the projections to planning for future food\naid to enable the estimation of spatial locations and severity of fbture problems in regions at risk.\nThis research focuses on three countries in West Africa, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali,\nwhere an important indicator of food access is the price of locally grown grains in informal\nvillage markets. Rural households in most of the Sahel sell grain in order to obtain cash for\nhousehold needs (Jape and Minot, 1989). Farmers typically sell a portion of their crop on the\nmarket directly after the harvest when the price is low, save a portion for consumption, and\npurchase food fiom the market as their own supplies diminish later in the year, usually at a much\nhigher price. These transactions typically occur within five kilometers of the household\xe2\x80\x99s land\nbecause transportation is both expensive and unreliable (Platteau, 1996). Reliance on agriculture\nas a primary source of both income and food has led to a fundamental vulnerability to seasonal\n\n5\n\nand inter-annual rainfall. Cash income is therefore important because food grown in areas with\nadequate rainfall can generally be purchased even if grain cannot be grown locally in some years.\nSeasonal variations in food prices are a disadvantage for local producers due to food\nmarketing patterns in infiastructure-poor economies (Barrett, 1996). While food markets are\nbecoming more integrated, annual and interannual variations in prices are still large due to\nconstraints in the production system and efficiency in distribution In the small, isolated, and\ninformal markets that are typical of the region, food prices are intimately linked with local food\nproduction.\n\nMultiple variables can affect the production of cereal crops, not just whether or not\n\nadequate rain is received. These variables include area planted, insect and animal damage, soil\nerosion, soil infertility, and damage due to wind among other factors (Hoogmoed and Klaij,\n\n1990; Klaij and Hoogmoed, 1993). International food trade, production imbalances between\ndifferent areas of a country, and limited road networks may also influence the local prices of\nfood (Cutler, 1984; De Waal, 1988; Deaton and Miller, 1996). Variability in the rainfall has a\nsignificant negative impact on food access, both because of reductions of grain meant for onf m consumption and because of consequent increase in grain prices during periods of shortfall\nbefore the next harvest.\nThe current work investigates whether predictions of changes in prices can be improved\nby incorporating remotely sensed vegetation into quantitative price models. Remotely sensed\nvegetation data is used qualitatively by the food security community to link vegetation indices to\nagricultural yields (Fuller, 1998; Funk et al., 2005; Funk and Brown, 2006). The justification for\nusing satellite data in famine early warning activities came from research on net primary\nproduction (NPP) (Prince et al., 1990; Diallo et al., 1991;Justice et al., 1991 a; Prince, 199 1). At\n\nfmt primary production estimates from satellite data were used to determine if an area was\n\n6\n\nexperiencing a decline in food availability. Later, early warning organizations moved towards\nadditional indicators based on a wide variety of locally gathered social and economic data.\nUnfortunately no direct connection between remotely sensed indices and food access has been\nestablished.\nThis paper presents a price-vegetation model that is used to create maps of price\npredictions using West Africa as an example. The intention is to use satellite observations of\nvegetation to allow regions such as West Africa to improve the functioning of their markets,\ninformation systems, and government organizations that are involved in food security. The\nmodel is presented first, with its data and outputs. Next, an analysis of the relative impacts on\nlocal prices of local conditions and millet of export regions is presented. The maps of prices\nacross the region, that are made possible by the spatially continuous nature of remotely sensed\nvegetation data, are compared with specific market price observations. A generalized model that\nexploits the spatially continuous nature of remote sensing data is presented. The impacts of\nmapping forecasted prices on the ability of regional, national and international governments and\norganizations to respond to market movements due to environmental conditions are discussed.\n2.0\n\nInput Data\n2.1\n\nPrice Data\n\nThe price data used were monthly millet prices from 445 markets in Niger, Mali and\nBurkina Faso. The data were obtained from local market price monitoring organizations through\nthe USAID\xe2\x80\x99s Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) (May, 1991; Chopak, 1999). The data\nhave been kept in the local currency (CFA)\xe2\x80\x99. The data series vary in length, with all data ending\nin 1999, but beginning in different years (Niger in 1982, Mali in 1987 and Burkina Faso in\nI\n\nThe CFA is fixed for all three countries at the same exchange rate with the French franc. This rate varied over the\nperiod of interest, with a significant devaluation occurring in 1994.\n\n7\n\n1989). All the price datasets have similar means and standard deviations (Table 1). The 126\nmarkets with fewer than 50 months of data out of the total possible of 2 15 months were\nexcluded. 29% of the data in the three countries were either missing or could not be used due to\na lack of sufficient consecutive months of data. 68,904 monthly millet price data points were\navailable for analysis.\nAlthough the FEWS database also includes monthly data for maize, rice, sorghum, wheat,\npeanuts, and a variety of other local and imported products, this study considered only millet\nprices. Millet is the most frequently purchased commodity in West African rural areas when\nown-grain production is low (Jayne et al., 1996). It is also the most widely grown and most\nreadily available grain. Market locations are shown on a map of NPP in Figure 1.\nThe millet price data were deflated with a national annual consumer price index (CPI)\n(IMF, 1999c; IMF, 1999b; IMF, 1999a), interpolated across months. The CPI was used to relate\nchanges of consumer\xe2\x80\x99s purchasing power over time in the three countries where data were used\n(Jayne et al., 1996). The deflation removes inflation trends from the data and corrects for the\nimpact of 50% devaluation of the CFA in 1994.\n2.2\n\nSatellite Vegetation Data\n\nVegetation index data was used as a proxy for agricultural production. Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data have been used extensively in the Sahel to detect\nvariations in vegetation production, and have been shown by a number of authors to be\ncorrelated to both NPP, crop yields (Tucker, 1985; Prince, 1991; Tucker et al., 1991; Fuller,\n1998), and precipitation (Tucker and Nicholson, 1999). NDVI data were obtained from the\nN O M Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) archive, which has 8 x 8 km\nspatial and monthly temporal resolutions. The data were processed by the Global Inventory\n\n8\n\nMonitoring and Mapping Study (GIMMS) group at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n(Tucker et al., 2005). The AVHRR sensor has appropriate spatial, spectral and temporal\nresolutions to monitor the entire Earth, hence it is adequate to cover all West Africa (Justice et\nal., 1985; Townshend and Justice, 1986; Justice et al., 1991a; Justice et al., 1991b; Townshend,\n1994). The mean of a five by five-pixel box (40 x 40km) centered on each market was\ncalculated from monthly maximum value NDVI composites (Holben, 1986).\n2.3\n\nNet Primary Production Classification\n\nA map of the means of annual NPP was used to classify the markets into those in similar\nagroecological potential zones, in classes of 100 grams of carbon per square meter per year (g m2yr-1).The NPP .data were obtained from the Department of Geography, University of Maryland\n\n(Prince and Goward, 1995). The nine classes range from a desert environment with an NPP of 0100 g m-*yr-\xe2\x80\x99(class 1) to the sub-humid Sudanian zone in the south of Burkina Faso and Mali\nthat has an annual NPP of 800-900 g m-*yr\xe2\x80\x9d (class 9). The NPP classes parallel latitude bands\nand are continuous across the landscape from East to West (Figure 1). The NPP data provided a\nclassification of markets having similar agroecological potential. NDVI time series were used in\nthe models instead of NPP because they provided the monthly time step that allowed\nrelationships between the environmental characteristicsand price to be derived.\n3.0\n\nMethodology\nPrevious work has shown that there was a negative linear relationship between vegetation\n\nproductivity and millet prices in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger during the 1980s and 1990s\n(Brown et al., 2006). Empirical Mode Decomposition was used here to isolate components with\ndifferent cycles of fluctuations (seasonal, interannual, errors) in order to model the\nenvironmental effect on price from stochastic economic effects (Huang et al., 1998; Pinzon,\n\n9\n\n2002; Pinzon et al., 2005). By partitioning the data into components that had variations at the\nsame timescale as the growing season, the seasonal component that is most related to crop\nproduction could be isolated. By using satellite-derived vegetation data to account for these\nseasonal variations instead of a dummy variable, the estimate of the modeled price was improved\n(Deaton and Laroque, 1992; Brown et al., 2006). The model uses Markov theory to describe the\ntrend, since this is the component of price that is most clearly driven by economic forces. The\nhigh-frequency component, which we assume to be noise for the purposes of this analysis, was\nnot modeled.\nThe Markov property can be stated as follows: the future evolution of the system depends\nonly on its current state and it is independent of its history. This means that to predict next\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99s prices only the current month\xe2\x80\x99s prices are needed. Although the Markov property is\nusually expressed using probabilities, Equation 1 shows the relationship as a deterministic linear\nregression.\nprice, = a + jCprice,_,)+ error\n!\n\nEquation 1\n\nA linear model was used instead of the probabilistic form of the Markov property to estimate\nmore precisely the price dynamics. Although it is clear that the equation above will not take into\naccount seasonal variations, this simplified equation should capture the majority of the price\ndynamics at one time period lag. FIJI exploration of the use of probabilistic Markov theory for\nthis application can be found in (Brown, 2006). The linear estimation is very similar to an\nautoregressive moving average model (ARMA), but the coefficients here are estimated for each\nmarket.\n\n10\n\nHuang et a1 (1998) introduced the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) as an\nalternative to standard decomposition technique for representation of nonlinear and nonstationary\ndata that show clear physical scales or Gequency content. The Empirical Mode Decomposition\ntechnique is empirical, intuitive, direct, a posteriori, and adaptive, with the decomposition\nfunctions based on and derived from the data (Huang et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1999). Unlike\nFourier decomposition (Wilks, 1995; Trefethen and Bau, 1997), the EMD takes the basis for the\nsignal from the data themselves. The goal of the EMD is to decompose the signal into individual\nintrinsic modes of oscillation (Huang et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1999; Pinzon et al., 2001). At\nany given time, the data may be represented by many different, coexisting modes of oscillation,\neach one superimposed on the others.\nThe components were isolated using a sifting process repeated as many times as is\nrequired to reduce the extracted signal to an intrinsic mode function (Huang et al., 1998). The\nsifting allowed the expansion of the time series into modes that would reveal the principal\nfrequencies or scales that dominate the signal. The components of an EMD are usually\nphysically meaningful, since each mode is defined by the physical data themselves, and are\nadditive, so summing all components recreates the original time series. The EMD technique was\napplied to both the NDVI and the price time series and three components were extracted from\neach: the trend, the seasonal component characterized by a 12-month period, and a component\nthat consisted of high frequency oscillations with a nearly Gaussian distribution, treated here as\nerror.\n\n3.2\n\nDescription of the Model\n\nThe decomposition technique provided a way to isolate the portion of the price which is\nseasonal in nature, in that the data had a regular 12-month period. In the model, it was assumed\n\n11\n\nthat the seasonal price component isolated using EMD was most related to variations in the\nenvironment measured by the NDVI. Thus, the NDVI seasonal profile was used to model the\nprice seasonal component using two linear regressions. The regressions relate the green-up of\nvegetation during the onset of the rainy season to the increase in prices leading to the harvest,\nand the senescence of vegetation to the decline in cereal prices during the harvest. This was\ndone to associate the price with the NDVI in order to take advantage of the NDVI\xe2\x80\x99s spatially\ncomplete information about the variations in the environment. The coefficients from the\nregressions between the NDVI and price profiles were applied to the monthly time series of\nNDVI data to estimate the monthly price seasonal profile.\nUsing the EMD decompositiontechnique, the following procedure was used in order to\nmodel the prices (Figure 2).\n1. Decomposition of both the mean NDVI of a 5x5 pixel box around each market and the\naccompanying millet price time series each into two components: a trend and a seasonal\ncomponent.\n2. A mean seasonal profile was created for NDVI and price for centered on the location of each\nmarket by averaging all available months of data from all years for each market. Linear\nregression was performed fkom May to August and from August to December between the\nmean price seasonal profile and the mean NDVI seasonal profile. The coefficients from these\nregressions were then applied to the NDVI data for all years to construct a continuous\nvegetation-based price seasonal time series from May to December for all years. The slope\nof the mean price profile from January to May was used to inform the period when the NDVI\nhas little information due to the onset of the dry season, and the price is increasing as supply\nin the markets diminish.\n\n12\n\n3. The reconstructed seasonal price component was subtracted from original price data and the\nEMD decomposition re-run with the new price dataset, providing a new trend component and\nenabling the identification and removal of the noise component.\n4. The trend component from step 3 represented the economic portion of the price that could\nnot be explained by NDVI changes. The trend was predicted using the relationship between\nthe current and next month price based on a strong Markov relationship (Equation 1).\nThe trend and seasonal components were then summed to reconstruct the historical price time\nseries. By basing the portion of the price that has seasonal characteristics on the NDVI, the price\nreconstruction was improved over traditional economic models that either remove this portion or\nuse an invariant climatology (see (Deaton and Laroque, 1992)). In addition, the model provided\na spatially continuous map of prices derived from the satellite remote sensing data.\nThe model described above assumes that the local vegetation conditions are more\nimportant than the conditions in the primary millet export zones (shown in Figure 3). To\nevaluate the relative importance of local conditions vs conditions in the export zones, the model\nerror of predictions made using the vegetation from local market regions was compared to the\nidentical model using the average vegetation signal in millet regions in West Africa. Because\nthere is significant cross-border trade, the region from Senegal through to Chad was considered\nas one region and included in the mean.\n\nAn additional evaluation of the integration of the markets from before and after 1994 was\nmade by comparing model effectiveness during these two time periods. The number of\nobservations was comparable for these two time periods, with 12,190 observations before 1994\nand 13,730 after. 1994 is an important date in the region because it was the year in which all\n\n13\n\nthree countries devalued their currency and began market liberalization policies, which led\neventually to increased market integration.\n\n3.2 Evaluation of the Price Model\nThe markets were divided into training and validation sets with just over 50% of the data\nin the training set and the remainder in the test set. The coefficients were developed from the\ntraining set and then applied to all markets. The markets in the validation set were used to\nestimate the goodness of fit of the model through a comparison of the model output and the\nprices in the validation markets. Standard evaluation techniques such as the R-squared, F\nprobabilities and stability of the coefficients were examined. The root mean square error\n\n(RMSE) (D\xe2\x80\x99Agostino, 1986) was calculated for each market price time series and the extracted\nmapped price, and the normal probability plot and histogram plots by month and year were used\nto estimate the goodness of fit of the model. To determine if the model had a positive or\nnegative bias, as required to use the model for applications, normal plots were summarized with\nthe Rp statistic, a version of the Shapiro-Wilk test (D\xe2\x80\x99Agostino, 1986). The Rp is a measure of\nthe normality of the residuals, since it correlates the ordered residuals with the standard normal\ndistribution. To determine the goodness-of-fit of the model, the\xe2\x80\x98RMSE and Rp were calculated\nfor the test markets once the model was applied to the whole dataset. To compare the model\xe2\x80\x99s\nability to predict the actual price, the actual and the predicted price for all time periods and all\nmarkets were regressed against each other and the coefficient of determination was reported. In\norder to save space only the RMSE is reported in this paper, but all other analyses are available\nupon request.\n\n14\n\nThe EMD decomposition of the price data allowed the separation of the overall trend\nfrom the yearly seasonal increases in price. The trend component was able to isolate nonenvironmentally related movements in price very effectively, reducing the errors of the linear\nmodel of price. Figure 4a shows the original price time series, the decomposed price (Figure 4b)\nand the actual compared with the predicted price (Figure 4c) from the market in Macina, Mali.\nNotice the low millet prices in 1993 and 1994, influenced by a 50% devaluation of the currency\nand resulting high inflation rate for the next few years in all three countries (Kelly et al., 1995;\nCoulibaly et al., 1998; Yade et al., 1999), and a very large millet crop as a result of one unusually\nwet year (Tucker and Nicholson, 1999; Nicholson, 2000).\n4.1 Model Accuracy\nThe results of the EMD model are summarized in Table 2 using RMSE. The EMD\nmodel is compared to results using price only on raw data, as presented in the methodology,\nwhere the current month\xe2\x80\x99s price was used to predict the next month\xe2\x80\x99s price with the raw data.\nNote the errors for the simple, price-only model were seasonal, increasing during the harvest and\npost-harvest months of September - December, and were larger in the Sahel and smaller in the\nmore humid zones. In addition to the linear model, the standard deviation of the noise\ncomponent is presented, since the errors in the model should be less than the noise level present\nin the data (Table 2).\nBy modeling the seasonal cycle of prices using the seasonal information from remotely\nsensed vegetation data, it was possible to explain more fully the impact of differences in the\nenvironmental conditions on millet prices. When the local growing season was poor, lower\nmillet production resulted in less price seasonality. The prices aRer harvest did not fall as much\nas normal, but instead continued to grow throughout the following year, depending on the extent\n\n15\n\nof the shortfall. The EMD decomposition allocated this overall price increase to the trend\nportion of the price instead of in the seasonal portion, thus the small seasonality during drought\nyears in both the price and vegetation signal was appropriate. Table 2 shows the errors of the\nreconstructed time series by month and by region when the prices were used as point data,\ndecomposed and reconstructed individually.\n\nPrice Maps\n\n4.2\n\nAs outlined in the methodology, the seasonal NDVI component was used to estimate the\nseasonal price time series. Figure 5a shows the average seasonal profiles calculated from the\n/\n\nextracted seasonal price component for the nine NPP classes with the predicted curves. The\ncurves were fairly invariant from the north to the south of the region, unlike the vegetation\n(Figure 5b) where increasing seasonality occurred in the NDVI year profiles towards the north.\nFigure 6 shows the spatial distribution of the errors from the seasonal component by market from\nall years. The RMSE was calculated on the residual of the actual seasonal profile for each\nmarket for all years subtracted from the calculated seasonal profile from NDVI for each year.\nThe changing seasonality seen in Figure 5b caused larger errors in the North. Due to aridity, the\nNDVI does not have a clear seasonality in the northern part of the Sahel with which to model the\nprice resulting in errors in the calculated price time series when compared to the seasonal profile\ncalculated from the original price data.\nTo produce spatially varying maps of millet price, seasonal price estimates based on the\nby-pixel transformation of NDVI were scaled with the averaged price trends from each NPP\nclass. Figure 7 shows the model output for the August price for 1989 through to 1999, and\nbecause the map was created using data that was corrected for inflation, it shows real prices.\nLarge swings in food prices in the region are evident from the large variation among the years\n\n16\n\ndue to the averaged price trends. The variation within the year was much smaller, although the\nprice in December was nearly always below 90 CFA/kg and the price in August was frequently\nabove 90. For wage laborers, landless and urban dwellers, who are dependent on the market to\nobtain food, these large seasonal and interannual price changes significantly reduce their access\nto food.\n4.3\n\nComparing Local Conditions to Millet Export Regions\n\nThe model was based on the premise that local conditions are strong determinants of\nlocal market prices. If markets are integrated, however, then prices in one market are less a\nfunction of local conditions than overall conditions in the region from which surplus, which\nmakes it to the market, originates. Figure 8 compares the RMSE from the price only model, the\nEMD model using local NDVI values and millet region values, and the price derived from the\nmaps shown in Figure 7. The raw price data were used for comparison, without removing the\nhigh frequency noise as was done for the RMSE in Table 2. The model using the NDVI from the\nmillet production regions was slightly lower than that from the local NDVI. The errors of both\nmodels were generally below that of the price-only model. The errors derived from the price\nimage were generally higher, but were still reasonable, and in some periods and regions\napproached that of the model with more precise input. Using the millet area NDVI observations\nreduced the errors of the model slightly indicating that the markets were integrated, but the local\nNDVI was still quite significant.\nWhether local or regional conditions were more important depended on whether market\nintegration increased during the period of record. To investigate this question, the RMSE for the\nperiod from before 1994 was and compared with that after 1994 for three cases: model with the\nlocal NDVI, with the regional NDVI, and the price-only model. The price-only model showed\n\n17\n\nsignificantly larger errors in regions with low NPP during the pre- 1994 period, indicating that the\nmarkets were significantly more integrated in the post 1994 period. This agreed with several\nreport that millet markets in this region have become increasingly well integrated (Vitale and\nBessler, 2006). The driest region, NPP zone 1 ( 0-100 g/m2/yr),which even in good years was\nunable to produce enough millet for its populations and to fill its markets, had higher errors in\nboth NDVI models than price alone. This was to be expected since these markets are more likely\nto be integrated with those that are more self-sufficient, because most of the grain in the market\ncomes from elsewhere. NPP zones 2 , 3 and 8 had the highest errors in the markets with price\nalone, but these were ameliorated by including NDVI in the model.\n\n5.0\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nFamine early warning, represented by FEWS NET, now integrates assessments uf\n\nhousehold vulnerability to shocks (Boudreau, 1998), indicators of the economic and political\nsituation, and measures of unfavorable meteorological conditions (Verdin et al., 2005). This\nstudy shows that, by linking food prices and remotely sensed vegetation index data in\nquantitative relationships, the importance of rainfall-driven variations on the evolution of prices\ncan be assessed. This relationship can be applied by providing an improved price model for areas\nof rainfed agriculture, which is likely to be valuable for planning purposes. Because the results\nof the model show that rainfall dynamics, as captured by vegetation index data, can improve the\nprice model in some regions, the model should improve the interpretation of the input variables\ntaken individually and provide an improved leading indicator of changes in food prices. Maps of\nfood prices can be integrated with other data to create an enhanced leading indicator of changes\nto food prices for planning purposes.\n\n18\n\nFood price variations are critical to food security, both directly and as an indicator of\ncurrent trends. The dynamic relationship between supply, which depends in part on rainfall, and\nprices observed in specific markets allows the calculation of spatially continuous maps of prices.\nBy coupling two indicators into one map, the intensity and extent of price-induced vulnerability\ncan be identified. This extrapolation of prices in a few markets to the entire region using satellite\ndata could be exploited by food security organizations to enable the need for humanitarian\nassistance and its magnitude to be estimated for the immediate future.\nThe price models that use real-time vegetation observations provide information with\nonly moderate accuracy, but adequate to be incorporated into planning responses that benefit\nfrom anticipation of need. In fact the reduction in skill by generalizing across productivity zones\nwas found to be only moderate, but the gain in knowledge of the spatial extent of anomalous\nprices exchange provided by the model made the sacrifice of accuracy more than justified. Many\nvulnerable communities are isolated geographically and so the extension of price data from\nsentinel markets to provide estimates of future prices in areas that have no markets is likely to be\nparticularly useful.\nPrice maps produced from this model, however, are only effective in regions that have\nclosely coupled production and marketing systems. Regions where most of the food is imported,\nor in countries or times when food prices are controlled by outside events (by centrally fixing\nprices or during political or economic crises, for example), the model will capture less of the\nchanges in food prices. Thus modeled millet prices are of limited accuracy in urban areas and in\nareas with significant trade in commodities into and out of the region.\nThe results of this study show that the quality of the growing season affects the price of\nmillet at the annual and the seasonal time scales. If the growing season is characterized by\n\n19\n\nerratic, sparse rainfall, higher cereal prices are the result, but with well-distributed, abundant\nrainfall the region experienced lower prices. The use of one time series of vegetation data from\nthe millet export zone reduced model errors over using the local NDVI time series for the zone\n\nof shortage. The dryer the area, the greater the skill of the model runs using a unified vegetation\ntime series from the millet export zone over local vegetation data. Coupled with an analysis of\nthe model performance from before and after 1994, the time when market liberalization policies\nbegan in earnest, these results show that the markets have become better integrated through time.\nThe errors were very similar between the local and millet zones vegetation signal and, althougll\nerrors from price time series derived from mapped prices were generally higher, they were still\nsufficiently small for the estimates to be useful. Thus although vegetation information fiom\nsurplus-producing zones improves the price model, using the local information to create\nrelationships which enable these maps is reasonable.\nThe required accuracy of these anticipated prices is far lower than for food aid. Price\nprojections need only give planners a general idea of which direction food prices are likely to\nmove. This information can be used to direct the on-the-ground assessments needed to respond\nin an accurate and timely manner and can help food program organizations begin the large task\nof building up grain reserves in the most threatened areas.\nAlthough issues of supply and demand are primary in controlling prices, improvement in\nestimation of prices using environmental factors can make important contributions to food\nsecurity monitoring (Brown et al., 2006).\n\n20\n\nReferences\n\nC.
