Possibly, the mass of the black hole, if any, does not exceed 100 M(solar) or so. Further work is needed in order to distinguish between such a modest-mass black hole and its potential rival such as a very massive star of about the same mass. Anyway, the Galactic nucleus seems to be a tracer of a past star burst rather than a remnant of a Seyfert galaxy activity.", "title": "Testing the AGN paradigm for our home Galaxy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930045809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ozernoy, Leonid"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "afd90f2ee2124beeb81f0795c678938f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930045809, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930045809, "publisher": "American Institute of Physics", "id": "d118a203be6440bbbfd11f45c2caf807", "publicationName": "In: Testing the AGN paradigm; Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Topical Astrophysics Conference, Univ. of Maryland, College Park, Oct. 14-16, 1991 (A93-29801 11-90)", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
