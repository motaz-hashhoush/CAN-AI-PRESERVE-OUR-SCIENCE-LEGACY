In 2012 NMA has taken over the full responsibility for the GEOSAT software. This implies that FFI stopped being an IVS Associate Analysis Center in 2012. NMA has been an IVS Associate Analysis Center since 28 October 2010. NMA's contributions to the IVS as an Analysis Centers focus primarily on routine production of session-by-session unconstrained and consistent normal equations by GEOSAT as input to the IVS combined solution. After the recent improvements, we expect that VLBI results produced with GEOSAT will be consistent with results from the other VLBI Analysis Centers to a satisfactory level.", "title": "NMA Analysis Center", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-03-30T16:35:09.7830000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150003914, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kierulf, Halfdan Pascal"}, "organization": {"name": "Norwegian Mapping Authority", "location": "Honefoss, Norway"}}, "id": "bac3d733f2884d7d94656a4f84c96e13"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20150003914, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Andersen, Per Helge"}, "organization": {"name": "Norwegian Defence Research Establishment", "location": "Kjeller, Norway"}}, "id": "b51414d6117949a39ddb0d1c7a78dc7b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150003914, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150003914, "id": "cc542615b04f4a8fac8cced146774d15", "publicationName": "International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry 2012 Annual Report", "publicationDate": "2013-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140010415, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry 2012 Annual Report", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150003914.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150003914/downloads/20150003914.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150003914/downloads/20150003914.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150003914/downloads/20150003914.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
