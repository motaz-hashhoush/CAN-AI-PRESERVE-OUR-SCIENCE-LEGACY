In this study, Boeing identified and analyzed advanced concepts and technologies for\naircraft that would fly in the 2030-2035 timeframe. Large possible improvements in fuel burn,\nemissions, and noise were identified and roadmaps developed for key technologies. Specific\nrecommendations for future work were made in the Boeing Phase I Final Report (1), many of\nwhich are addressed in Phase II:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConduct additional design and analysis of hybrid electric gas turbine propulsion\nConduct a comprehensive study of high aspect ratio truss braced wings\nConsider additional noise technologies (partially addressed as part of hybrid electric\ntasks)\nConduct a follow-on study to consider the synergistic benefits of methane and/or\nhydrogen fuel\n\nConsidering the recommendations of Boeing and the other contractor teams, as well as program\nobjectives, NASA developed these Research Objectives for Phase II:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExperimental and Higher-Fidelity Exploration of Key Technologies to investigate the\nprioritized technology challenges identified in Phase I and begin moving toward the\nrealization of the proposed vehicle concept(s) capabilities that would enable an entry into\nservice (EIS) in the 2030-2035 timeframe, market permitting\nN+3 Advanced Vehicle Concept Study to further explore, refine, and otherwise update the\npreferred N+3 advanced vehicle and component concept(s) identified and developed\nduring Phase I\nN+4 Advanced Vehicle Concept Study to leverage the substantial investment of Phase I\nand study the effect of additional technology development time beyond that assumed in\nPhase I\n\nBoeing structured the SUGAR Phase II program to address the recommendations from Phase I as\nwell as the research objectives provided by NASA. Three major tasks, corresponding to the\nResearch Objectives, are included in the Phase II effort. Subtasks are organized and grouped by\ntechnical area (Figure 1.1).\n\n1\n\nSUGAR Phase II\n\nTask 1 Task 2 Task 3\n\nSUGAR Phase I\n\nManagement\nN+4 Advanced Concept Study\nN+4 Concept Study (Task 1.0)\nTruss Braced Wing\nTruss Braced Wing Concept Refinement & Higher Fidelity Exploration (Task 2.1)\nTruss Braced Wing Experimental Validation (Task 3.1)\nAdvanced Aerodynamic Technology Experiment (Task 3.2)\nHybrid Electric Propulsion\nHybrid Electric Concept Refinement & Higher Fidelity Exploration (Task 2.2)\nHybrid Electric Sim.

In Phase II (depicted in Figure 1.2), the team was\nexpanded to include Virginia Tech, NextGen Aeronautics, and Microcraft to enhance the technical\ncapabilities and to build hardware to support the testing of the truss braced wing tasks.\nThis is the Final Report for Tasks 2.1, 3.1, and 3.2. Task 1 is fully documented in the Task 1 final\nreport (2) and the Hybrid Electric Tasks 2.2 and 3.3 are fully documented in a separate Final\nReport (Volume II \xe2\x80\x93 Hybrid Electric Design Exploration). A separate test report for Task 3.1\nprovides additional information (Volume III - Truss Braced Wing Aeroelastic Test Report).\nDocumentation for the testing in Task 3.2 is included in this report.\nIn Phase I of the SUGAR study, a preliminary analysis was performed on a truss braced wing\nconfiguration with N+3 technologies. The study showed that these configurations have potential\nfor reduced fuel burn depending on the weight and aerodynamic performance of the wing. It was\nrecommended exiting Phase I that a comprehensive study of high aspect ratio strut braced wings\nbe performed.\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Phase II Team Structure\n\nTo reduce uncertainty in the performance of TBW configurations, the SUGAR Phase II team\ninvestigated the structural, aeroelastic, and control challenges that remained unaddressed in\nPhase I.

For clarity, this document breaks the\nconfiguration development into three sections.\nSection 2.1, Configuration Basis, Design Trades, and Evolution, focuses on the trades and logic\nthat lead to the air vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s current embodiment. All data contained within is intended to\ndocument the mid-iteration trades and should not be correlated to the final configuration\nperformance unless specifically noted.\nSection 2.2, Configuration Description, details the final configuration in detail. This section\nrepresents the vehicle as analyzed for vehicle performance.\nSection 2.3, Configuration Analysis and Final Performance, contains the analysis results and\nperformance data for the vehicle described in the previous section.\nThe technology plans and roadmaps are included in Section 2.4.\n\n2.1\n\nConfiguration Basis, Design Trades, and Evolution\n\nDesign trades and configuration basis are described in the following sections. The data contained\nwithin are not representative of the final configuration unless specifically noted.\n2.1.1\nAssumptions and Definitions\nThe coordination and planning process for the SUGAR study has highlighted how similar looking\nconfigurations can be different in design intent. Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech have experience\noptimizing truss braced wings, however the underlying assumptions used in their previous\nvehicle optimizations are different than those envisioned by The Boeing Company. This section\nwill describe many of these options and define the vocabulary used within this report for\ndifferent TBW structural layouts. It will also illustrate which options are considered the baseline\nfor this study and why those options were chosen. Some, but not all of these baseline decisions\nare traded in this study.\n2.1.1.1\nPrimary Wing and Jury Strut Definitions\nTruss braced concepts are comprised of a wing, primary wing struts, jury struts, and a truss\nsupport structure (in this case the fuselage). Primary wing struts and jury struts are distinguished\nby their intended purpose. Primary wing struts are intended to effect wing bending loads,\ntypically relieving wing box load and transferring it into the lower fuselage carry thru or to change\nload direction. Jury struts are intended to force buckling modes to higher frequencies thus\nstabilizing the wing and/or primary wing struts. Figure 2.1 illustrates the distinction between strut\nelement types. A configuration with a single primary wing strut it is typically considered a strut\nbraced wing rather than a truss braced wing. Sometimes the structural element connecting a\n\n5\n\nwing to an engine is referred to as a strut; for clarity, this study will refer to this element as a\npylon\nJURY STRUT\n\nPRIMARY WING STRUT\n\nFigure 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Example Geometry Showing Strut Definitions\n\n2.1.1.2\nConstraints for Number of Strut Elements\nThere are countless variations on the number and layout of strut elements for a truss braced\nwing. Figure 2.1 shows a configuration with four primary wing struts and three jury struts. The\ncomplexity of the wing structure and manufacturing is assumed to be proportional to the number\nof primary and jury wing struts. For simplicity, and based on previous studies by Virginia Tech and\nGeorgia Tech, a single strut was selected for the baseline 765-095 (SUGAR High) configuration. A\nstrut option was traded (referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d strut for this study) which has two streamwise coplanar primary struts with an optional fairing covering a portion of each strut or both struts in\ntheir entirety (see Figure 2.2). Zero, one, and two jury struts were considered in a trade study.\n2.1.1.3\nWing to Fuselage Attachment\nThe attachment of the wing to the fuselage is assumed to be handled by a conventional\ntrapezoidal panel similar to heritage Boeing high wing aircraft developed in Long Beach. This\nattachment scheme assumes the primary wing strut will not carry the entire wing bending load\nleaving a portion to be carried across the centerline by the wing box. Alternatively, the wing could\nbe pinned at the side of body forcing all wing loads to be carried by the strut. It is possible that\nthe pinned attachment is not a significant penalty and could speed manufacturing. This structural\noption should be traded but has not been addressed by this study.\n2.1.1.4\nStrut Attachment Constraints\nOne end of the primary wing strut is assumed to attach to the wing box, somewhere between\nthe front and rear spars, at an optimum percentage of the semispan, both of which were traded\nby a wing planform MDO. The other end is assumed to attach to the fuselage and share the\nforward attachment structure of the main landing gear trunnion. Jury struts are assumed to\nattach to the primary struts providing stabilization without breaking the primary load path. The\nother end of the jury strut will be allowed to extend to any primary structure on the fuselage or\nwing. It is assumed for the baseline that all the strut endpoints are attached with a universal joint\nor pin joint, however, a moment carrying attachment was traded in the wing planform MDO.\n\n6\n\n2.1.1.5\nLifting Struts\nFor this phase of the study it is assumed that the strut will not carry any lift loads. It is foreseen\nthat the optimum lift carried by the primary wing strut would be non-zero; however, interference\ndrag in regions where the lifting strut comes in close proximity to the wing will likely be severe.\nIt may be a vehicle benefit to have lift carried by the gear pylon and the strut root but it is seen\nas a second order effect. This study focuses on developing a global understanding of the species;\nthe optimum lift to be carried by the strut and gear pylon is a design detail to be considered in a\nsubsequent study.\n\nThe Baseline and Traded\nGeometries Have\nSimilar Front Views\n(Streamwise Co-Plainer)\n\nVariable Chord Primary Wing Strut\nTo Resist Buckling Is Allowed\n\nBASELINE\n\nTRADED OPTION\n\nTwo Co-Plainer Struts With\nOptional Fairing Traded\n\nFigure 2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Allowed Arrangements for Wing Struts\n\n2.1.2\nDesign Considerations\nThis section contains design considerations that must be attributed to aircraft with high wings,\nstrut braced wings, and high span wings. These topics are not intended to be all inclusive;\nadditional design considerations may apply. In addition, the sources for these topics are limited\nto government regulation. Airframe manufacturers maintain a proprietary set of design\nrequirements and objectives that can increase the levels of safety set forth by external regulation.\n\n7\n\n2.1.2.1\nHigh Wing\nHigh wing aircraft configurations are not typically used for twin aisle aircraft or single aisle aircraft\nlarger than regional sizes. These configurations will require special attention in the areas of\nvertical crash loads and ditching.\nVertical Crash Loads\nA substantial portion of an airplane\xe2\x80\x99s weight is comprised by its wing, which for a low wing aircraft\ninvolved in a vertical crash, is one of the first components to come in contact with the ground. In\nthis scenario, the fuselage needs to react only the payload and its own inertial loads. For a high\nwing aircraft, the fuselage is the first component to touch the ground and it must additionally\nreact the wing deceleration load. An erroneous common perception is that the wing must not be\nallowed to deform the fuselage.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) states that \xe2\x80\x9cneither 14 CFR 25.561 nor any other part\n25 requirements address the structural capability of the airframe as a whole in a crash landing\xe2\x80\x9d\n(3). The FAA continues by stating that structural deformation of the fuselage is allowed, but it\nmust maintain a survivable volume for the passengers while protecting them from the release of\ninternal items of mass including seats, overhead bins, and support structure. The aircraft should\n\xe2\x80\x9cprovide a level of crash survivability equivalent to that of conventional large transport category\nairplanes\xe2\x80\x9d (3).\nThese requirements may impact the design of a high wing aircraft. The weight impact would\ndepend on the structural arrangement and finalized configuration weights thus it is not\nquantified in this document. It may be beneficial to space the landing gear and wing carry thru\nstructure longitudinally. The landing gear is largely rigid structure when stowed and in a vertical\ncrash could create a pinch point if the wingbox is directly overhead.\nFrom a fuselage crushing perspective, the truss braced wing may have some advantages over a\ntraditional high wing as the strut support structure would impact the ground first. This would lift\nthe outboard wing while pushing them outboard. This could reduce the amount of structure\nrequired to maintain a survivable volume but may come with additional penalties (portions of\nthe wing box that contain fuel must retain the fuel in a crash for example).\nDitching\nOccasionally, an aircraft is required to make an emergency landing on water (referred to as\nditching). In this situation, it is required (4) to provide adequate exit capacity and time for\nevacuation. Traditionally, low wing configurations rely on the buoyancy of the wing fuel tanks to\naide in flotation and provide stability to the aircraft. A high wing configuration must rely primarily\non the buoyancy of the fuselage to float and thus, would float lower in the water than a\nconventional airplane.\n\n8\n\nSpecial care will be required to ensure the high wing aircraft floats with (likely the forward) exit\ndoors above the waterline for a time duration that accommodates evacuation with water leakage\nrates consistent with probable structural damage. Openings for aircraft systems will also have to\nbe accounted for which may drive their location in the airplane. Aft fuselage skin gauges may be\nset by ditching requirements. Overall, care will be required to meet ditching requirements but\nthey are foreseen as manageable.\n2.1.2.2\nTruss Braced Wing\nThe truss braced wing configuration will require special attention as it is not explicitly covered\nunder the current regulations. Areas of which require attention include bird strike and damage\ntolerant design.\nBird Strike\nThe current FAA requirements specify strike protection for 4 and 8 pound birds at several\ndifferent speed conditions. The JAR requirements hold the entire airframe to continued safe\nflight after a 4 pound bird strike. It is unclear how this requirement will be levied against the strut\nbraced wing configuration. Interpretation of the rules will be required and an FAA/JAR\nharmonization activity is currently underway. The weight of the bird has less contribution to the\nenergy of impact than the speed of the bird (function of cruise speed). The current embodiment\nof the truss braced wing design has a low cruise speed however, higher speed configurations are\nbeing discussed.\nTwo approaches exist for meeting the bird strike constraints. One approach is to absorb the\nenergy with aircraft structure ensuring that sufficient load path remains after impact to handle a\nreduced set of flight loads. An alternate approach is to deflect the bird energy by means of a\ndeflector. Based on experience with vertical tails which absorb bird strike energy with structure,\nthe strut will likely require a bird deflecting strategy. This deflector could be constructed with\ncomposite or metallic materials depending on bird energy and volume available.\nThe jury strut is of greater concern due to its small size. Two approaches should be traded, a bird\ndeflector similar to that envisioned for the strut, or an aircraft design that is damage tolerant\nwhich can operate without the jury strut at reduced load. The current SUGAR designs ignore bird\nstrike but acknowledge the design criteria\xe2\x80\x99s potential impact to the final configuration.\nDamage Tolerant Design Criteria\nCurrent design rules require a damage tolerant design for primary aircraft structure. This\nregulation can be satisfied by a trade between inspection intervals and redundancy in the load\npaths. The design standard essentially requires structure to be rated to limit load with damage\nthat could be overlooked for one inspection interval. Thus, an increase in inspection frequency\nor more structural redundancy, both provide contribution to operating cost, will need to be\n\n9\n\ntraded for the truss braced wing. The wing struts are particularly vulnerable because the\nstructure is relatively small and highly loaded.\nTraditional approaches to damage tolerant design will need to be employed when detailed strut\ndesign begins. With appropriately tailored structural geometry, the struts and their fittings\nshould be capable of meeting this requirement.\n2.1.2.3\nHigh Span Wings\nSeveral design considerations stem from having wings of significant span. These primarily include\nthe areas of stability and control and airport compatibility.\nStability and Control\nStability and control challenges come in the form of high and low speed considerations.\nHigh Speed Considerations\nThe 765-095 is targeted at commercial airline operation and will spend most of its time in the\ncruise configuration at speeds high enough to require considerable attention to stability margins.\nRelaxed stability can contribute to drag savings but requires care that the actuator size and rates\nare achievable and that increased weight and complexity are properly traded with the benefits.\nRelaxed high speed stability must not adversely affect the trim and control power required during\nother flight phases.\nThe supercritical wings suggested for the design have large pitching moments compared to\nconventional wings. This increases the trimming load required from the horizontal tail and offsets\nsome of the tail off L/D gains. Additionally, aft loaded supercritical wings can have stall patterns\nwith the final break occurring near the trailing edge which can lead to large pitch up and / or nonsymmetrical conditions.\nAnother consideration is that the normal response of the shocks to small local changes in the\nfreestream flow combined with the proposed flexible structure could require a potential need\nfor local spanwise control of the flexible structure and the possibility of very high actuation rate\nrequirements.\nStability levels of straight wings at these speeds have not been subject to significant flight test,\nso the wind tunnel or CFD to flight test correlations have not been established. This will be a\nsignificant risk that will need to be mitigated in a risk reduction program. Empirical data should\nonly be used with great care.\nLow Speed Considerations\nThe bank angle for wing tip strike, gust loads during ground roll, bumps on taxiways, or perhaps\njust the sink rate at touchdown may be factors in how flexible the wing can be. As previously\nnoted, the stall characteristics may not be as consistent as current designs. In all configurations,\n\n10\n\nthe wing stiffness (or control laws) will need to assure a symmetrical configuration through the\npull, stall, and prevent any sudden disturbance from developing post stall. The control system\ncould be used to configure the wing to ease the stall characteristics but each new function adds\nrisk and complexity.\nMeeting the crosswind and steady heading sideslip requirements requires max lift coefficient and\nAOA at max lift coefficient to drop off gently and predictably with increasing sideslip. Highly\noptimized conventional wings tend to drop off quickly and have had issues with the full rudder\nsteady heading sideslip demonstrations. The FAA / JAA harmonization process lower the speeds\nthat these demonstrations are required. Any future reduction in the speeds would require flat\nmax lift coefficient versus beta curves.\nSpoilers will most likely be required for high cruise speeds (where aileron effectiveness is low\nbehind shocks) and low speed operation near the ground (where large amounts of control are\nrequired by gusts). Spoilers will be required for most of the slowdown / go down maneuvers.\nStopping these very efficient aircraft may also be a significant challenge. Currently spoilers and\nreverse thrust are used to supplement the brakes and flap drag. Both spoiler and reverse thrust\ncreate large turbulent flow fields, RTO or landing conditions may limit the flexibility of the wingstrut-body combination.\nAirport Compatibility\nAircraft wingspans have been growing over the years. The trend is driven by the continuous need\nfor improving aircraft performance to meet airlines\xe2\x80\x99 operating (economics) challenges and to\nreduce environmental impacts. As shown in Figure 2.3, each aircraft family has experienced\nwingspan growth to the limit of its airport design category:\n\n11\n\nWing Span (M)\n80\n\nA380\nCode F < 80 m\n\n747-8\n\n70\n747-400\n\n60\n\n747-100\nMD-11\n\n50\n\nA330-300\nA340-300\n\n767-400\n\nDC-10-10\n\n787-9\n\n767-300\n767-200\n757-200\n\n40\n\n787-8\n\n767 winglets\n\nDC-10-30\nCode D < 52 m\n\nA350-900\n\n777-300ER\nA340-600\n\n777-200\n\nCode E < 65 m\n\nA300-600\n\nA300-600F\n\nA310-300\n\nA320-200\n\nCode C < 36 m\n\n757 winglets\n\n757-300\n737 NG\n\n737 Winglets\n\n30\n737-300\n\n737-100\n\n20\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\nEntry into Service (Year)\n\nFigure 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Aircraft Wingspan Growth Trend\n\nAirport\xe2\x80\x99s airsides (the aircraft maneuvering area of an airport) are built to support ground\noperations and to meet the servicing needs of aircraft operations. Airside layout and functionality\nis largely determined by the operational and physical characteristics of the most demanding\naircraft that uses the facility. Aircraft wingspan is one of the most critical aircraft physical\ncharacteristics, impacting all geometrical separations in the airside areas where movement or\nservicing of aircraft is anticipated (such as runway to runway, runway to taxiway, taxiway to\ntaxiway, taxiway to object separations, etc.). Other aircraft operational and physical\ncharacteristics, such as tail height and outer main gear wheel span, also have impacts to layout\nand functionality of various airside components at airports. The following section will discuss\nairport compatibility issues related only to aircraft wingspan.\nThe areas impacted by the aircraft wingspan are depicted in Figure 2.4 and listed:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nrunway \xe2\x80\x93 runway separation\nrunway \xe2\x80\x93 object separation\nrunway \xe2\x80\x93 taxiway separation\ntaxiway \xe2\x80\x93 taxiway / taxilane separation\ntaxiway / taxilane \xe2\x80\x93 object separation\naircraft parking position (with and without jet bridge)\nde-icing facilities\nengine run-up pad (open or partially enclosed pad)\naircraft hangars\n\n12\n\nTaxiway\nWidth\n\nTwy / Object\nSeparation\n\nRunway\nWidth\n\nRwy / Twy Separation\n\nSeparations\nat Gate\n\nFigure 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Areas Impacted by Aircraft Wingspan\n\nAirport Design Criteria and Potential Impacts of High Wingspan\nTo ensure safe operation of airports as well as aircraft, each country or state enforces a set of\nairport design criteria by either adopting standards established by the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO) or by establishing their own standards. ICAO publishes a set of airport design\nstandards (5), while the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States establishes\nsimilar standards (6). These standards documents contain airport design criteria expressed by\nway of an airport reference coding system which relates to the operational and physical\ncharacteristics of the airplanes that the airport intends to serve through the airport reference\ncoding. It is important to note that these standards are not intended to limit operations, but to\nprovide guidelines that will accommodate a family of aircraft so as to avoid the need to make\ninfrastructure changes each time a new aircraft begins operations into an airport.\nICAO\xe2\x80\x99s airport reference coding classifies an airport based on aircraft reference field length,\nwingspan and outer landing gear wheel span, while the FAA uses aircraft approach speed,\nwingspan, and tail height as classification parameters. This section intends to address only\naircraft wingspan; therefore, only classification criteria relating to wingspan will be discussed\nherein. Table 2.1 shows the relationship between aircraft code letter and wingspan.\n\n13\n\nTable 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Airport Reference Code Letter\n\nICAO Aerodrome Reference Code Letter 1\nCode\nWingspan\nLetter\nmeters (ft)\nA\nUp to but not including 15m (49)\nB\n15m up to but not including 24m (78.7)\nC\n24m up to but not including 36m (118.1)\nD\n36m up to but not including 52m (170.6)\nE\n52m up to but not including 65m (213.3)\nF\n65m up to but not including 80m (262.5)\n\nFAA Airport Reference Code Letter 2\nAirplane Design\nWingspan\nGroup\nfeet (meters)\nI\n< 49 (15 m)\nII\n49 \xe2\x80\x93 < 79 (24.1)\nIII\n79 \xe2\x80\x93 < 118 (36)\nIV\n118- < 171 (52.1)\nV\n171- < 214 (65.2)\nVI\n214- < 262 (79.9)\n\nAn airport should be designed and constructed to meet these design standards established for\nits airport reference Code Letter category, unless otherwise approved by its jurisdictional aviation\nauthority.

The first component is a Code Number\nfrom 1 to 4 that relates to the airplane reference field length. Besides the wingspan, the outer main gear wheel span is the other\ndeterminant of the Code Letter.\n2\nOnly the first component of the FAA Airport Reference Code Number (the airplane design group code) is shown. The second\ncomponent, called the aircraft approach category (which ranges from categories A to E) is based on the aircraft approach speed.\nBesides the wingspan, the tail height is the other determinant of the airplane design group.\n\n14\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAircraft whose wingspan is larger than the airport reference Code Letter to which an\nairport is currently designed to be rejected for operations at the airport\nSpecial operational restrictions to be imposed. Such restrictions could be in various forms:\no temporarily closing a parallel taxiway while the larger aircraft is on the adjoining\nrunway or taxiway\no disallowing the larger aircraft from using a particular runway or taxiway\no limiting the aircraft wingspans on adjacent operational areas\no declaring only a limited time frame for such an operation\n\nAny restriction, regardless of form, will disrupt normal operations at an airport, and may cause\nflight delays and airport capacity / throughput reduction.\nDue to budget and / or space availability, not every area of an airport will be designed and built\nto one airport reference Code Letter. Especially at terminal aprons where aircraft park, the\nparking stands (including stands with jet bridges and remote stands without jet bridges) are sized\nto accommodate particular sizes of aircraft to maximize capacity and maintain a safe apron\ncirculation and space for Ground Service Equipment (GSE) storage and staging. A larger wingspan\naircraft attempting to park in a smaller parking stand, generally, will cause:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nclosure or restrictions on adjacent parking stands to smaller wingspan aircraft\nrestrictions on apron circulation (e.g., apron taxilanes, service roads)\nreduction in size or relocation of GSE storage and staging area\ndelay and capacity reduction in the airport terminal area as a combined effect of\noperational restrictions and the reduced passenger capacity of larger wingspan aircraft\n(compared with the same capacity aircraft with smaller wingspans)\n\nDesign standards for several other wingspan-impacted areas are not listed in Table 2.2, but they\ninclude runway-runway separation, runway-object separation, de-icing facilities, and aircraft\nhangars.\nRunway to runway and runway to object separation are also related to wake vortex (the\nturbulence that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air, the most important of which\nare wingtip vortices which can remain in the air for up to three minutes after the passage of an\naircraft). A non-infrastructure impact from an increase in the wake vortex turbulence is the\nseparation between aircraft on arrival and departure. As the turbulence increases, greater\nseparation is required, negatively impacting the throughput, and potentially overall airport\ncapacity. The wake vortex turbulence is related to aircraft weight and wingspan \xe2\x80\x93 turbulence\nincreases as the weight goes up, and decreases with increases to the span.\n\n15\n\nDe-icing facilities, engine run-up pads (especially partially enclosed pads), and aircraft hangars\nwill also be impacted by an increased wingspan. Most likely many of these will not be wide\nenough to accommodate increased wingspans and it is expected that modifications to these\nfacilities will be required. Further study is required to determine the impact of these changes\nImpacts of SUGAR Aircraft Wingspan on Airports Worldwide 3\nThe SUGAR program identified a 737-like aircraft as the study aircraft. Its wings incorporate a\nunique folding wing design mechanism. The unfolded wingspan (approximately 52m) will stay\nwithin the ICAO Code Letter D wingspan limit and the folded wingspan (approximately 36m) will\nstay within the Code Letter C wingspan limit.\nThis SUGAR aircraft intends to operate with its wings unfolded on the runway and folded\nwhenever the aircraft is off the runway. The SUGAR aircraft wings will be compatible with the\nICAO Code Letter D runway environment (including runway to parallel taxiway separations), and\nCode Letter C taxiways and parking aprons. Since the airports are traditionally designed for an\nunfolded wing, the SUGAR aircraft will have design and operational incompatibility on ICAO Code\nLetter C airport runways as well as with hangars and aprons when the wing is unfolded\n(mechanical malfunction or maintenance that requires the wings to be unfolded).\nThis study has analyzed the worldwide airport class distribution by traffic and has examined\nrunway-to-taxiway separations at 100 Code Letter C airports which are within the top 115 Code\nLetter C airports by traffic. The following sections discuss the findings.\nWorldwide Airport Distribution by Traffic\nThis study analyzed the worldwide airport reference coding distribution by scheduled flights as\nreported in the Official Airline Guide (OAG) through February 2012. It should be noted that the\nOAG database used in the study records only scheduled flights, without visibility of most freighter\nand all charter operations. Moreover, the database accuracy mainly relies on the reporting\nairlines. The study included a total of 2,313 commercial airports worldwide. As shown on Figure\n2.5, 58.5 percent of studied airports worldwide support only Code Letter C aircraft traffic; 18.7\npercent serve Code Letter D traffic; 21.4 percent serve Code Letter E traffic; and only 1.4 percent\nserves Code Letter F traffic.\n\n3\nThis study focuses on wingspan impact to ICAO Code C airports. It is expected that the conclusions reached in this study will be\ntransferable to other aircraft families.\n\n16\n\nFigure 2.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Worldwide Airport Distribution by Traffic 4\n\nIt should be noted that the airport distribution discussed above is based on aircraft that the\nairports served both in the past and serves at the time of this study. It does not reflect the airport\nclass that its physical geometry can accommodate. For simplicity, this study only considers, for\nexample, that an increase in wingspan on a Code Letter C aircraft will have more visible impacts\non those airports with Code Letter C traffic (not on Code Letters D through F traffic) as of the\ntime of the study.\nWingspan Impacts on Runway-to-Taxiway Separations\nThis study examined runway and taxiway centerline separations at 100 Code Letter C airports.\nThese airports serve aircraft not larger than Code Letter C and are within the top 115 Code Letter\nC airports by traffic (15 of the top 115 airports did not have clear enough images in Google Earth\nto make measurements). The study was based on the latest images provided by Google Earth\nPro. It is found that, out of these 100 airports, 75 percent of the airports have runway and taxiway\ncenterline separations above the ICAO Code Letter C and D requirements (or FAA Airport\nReference Code (ARC) 5 III and IV standards6). This finding indicates that the SUGAR aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s\nunfolded wingspan of 52m may not cause significant impacts on the runway system at the top\n4\nCode Letter C aircraft included in the analysis are 717, 727, 737, MD80, MD90, DC-3 to -7B, A318, A319, A320, A321, TU-134,\nYAK-42. Regional jet and turboprop Code Letter C aircraft are not included. Code Letters D-F aircraft included in the analysis are 707,\n720, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD11, DC-7C, DC-8, DC-10, A310, A300, A330, A340, A380, IL-76, IL-96, TU-204, AN-124, TU-154, TU204\n5\nThe FAA ARC consists of two components. The second component, depicted by letters from A to D, is the aircraft approach category\nwhich relates to aircraft approach speed. The first component, depicted by a Roman numeral from I to VI, is the airplane design group\nwhich relates to airplane wingspan or tail height, whichever is the most restrictive.\n6\nOut of the 100 airports studied, 18 are US airports. US airports follow the FAA standards, published in AC 150/5300-13, \xe2\x80\x9cAirport\nDesign\xe2\x80\x9d. The FAA standards are different from the ICAO standards as shown on Table 2. In terms of runway-to-taxiway separations,\nthe FAA standards are less demanding. Airport design groups III and IV require 400 feet (120 m) runway and taxiway centerline\nseparations by FAA criteria.\n\n17\n\n100 Code Letter C airports worldwide (by number of operations). However, the extent of\nwingspan impact on the runway system at the remaining Code Letter C airports will vary by\nairport, due to the uniqueness of each airport and its jurisdictional aviation authority. It should\nbe noted that this study classified the airports into different categories (Code Letters) only by\nway of the aircraft that are serving the airport. The ICAO / FAA standards are the minimum design\nstandards and airports may have over-designed their infrastructure in anticipation of future\ngrowth. Additionally, this study examined the airports based on today\xe2\x80\x99s ICAO / FAA standards. In\nmany cases, these have been gradually reduced over the years from the criteria that were\neffective at the time of the design / construction of a given airport.\nWingspan Impacts on Other Areas\nThe SUGAR aircraft will be expected to maintain a Code Letter C wingspan (folded) while it is off\nthe runway. Because this aircraft will operate in areas designed and operated to accommodate\nan ICAO Code C wingspan we will need to convince the airport authorities worldwide that once\nin the folded position, the aircraft will have a fail-safe and fool-proof means to maintain the\nfolded condition, even if there is a loss of power, or any other system breakdown. Without full\ndisclosure of the on-board fold and unfold systems, airports will be forced to declare that they\ncannot accept an aircraft whose span might inadvertently become Code D when all of the\nclearances and separations that allow the aircraft to even be on the airport are based on a folded\nspan.\nPotential Issues with the SUGAR Aircraft Folding Wings\nAs mentioned above, a major potential issue with the SUGAR aircraft folding wings will be human\nacceptance, especially, by the airports and their jurisdictional aviation authorities. The SUGAR\naircraft, by its unfolded wingspan, will be identified as Code Letter D aircraft. It is unknown\nwhether the SUGAR aircraft will be accepted by individual jurisdictional aviation authorities and\n/ or the airport operators as a Code Letter C aircraft for taxiing and parking, until after such time\nas a similar folding wing aircraft has been introduced into commercial service and accepted by\nthe authorities.\nSecondly, the dual status of the SUGAR aircraft (hybrid Code C/D) will create challenges to Air\nTraffic Control (ATC) and airport operational controllers (ground controllers). ATC and airport\nground controllers will need to employ two sets of standards (Code Letter D during approach and\ndeparture, and Code Letter C standards everywhere else) to direct the SUGAR aircraft\nmaneuvering at an airport. Any inadvertent folding wing mechanism failure or any irregular\nchanges required from the routine folding-unfolding configuration will need to be addressed at\nevery operational level. Our early attempts with the 777 wing fold (the aircraft was referred to\nas the 767-X at the time) faced a very skeptical airport audience. Their belief was that any\nmechanical system will be prone to break-downs and failures, so they implied that they would\n\n18\n\nrequire full span compatibility for the aircraft on their airports. Early disclosure of the fold /\nunfold process will be required by airports and aviation authorities in order for the aircraft to be\naccepted.\nIn cold climate areas, aircraft de-icing is normally conducted at the gate before departure and /\nor at a designated de-icing apron located somewhere between the gate and the runway. To\nensure that wing-folding area is free of ice during unfolding, ATC procedures may require\nmaintaining an unfolded-wing configuration after de-icing, or perhaps some on-board anti-icing\nfeature may be required. Our thought process at the time was that even though de-icing was\nthen (and still is now) primarily achieved by de-icing at the gate, that a secondary de-icing would\nbe provided as the aircraft neared its departure threshold, at which time the wings would be fully\nin the unfolded position. While this may seem to be only a back-up system, many airlines /\nairports use this technique today, due to the problem of dispatched aircraft running short on\ntheir holdover times. When an aircraft in the takeoff queue is within a few minutes of the icepreventative effectiveness of their last de-icing, a secondary de-icing vehicle is often prepositioned near a threshold to apply a final de-icing treatment. This practice will probably\nbecome a requirement for folding wing aircraft once they are deployed to the world\xe2\x80\x99s airports.\nGeorgia Tech Airport Compatibility Dashboard\nCompared to current transport aircraft, the wing span of the SUGAR concept is potentially much\nlonger for the same aircraft weight/seat class. This increase in span is critical to the advantages\nof the design. Practically, the operation of the SUGAR concept may be limited by existing airport\ninfrastructure parameters, and thus may have access to only a subset of airports. Several\npotential limiting parameters include runway width, taxiway width, runway-taxiway separation,\ntaxiway-object separation and separations at gate, as illustrated in Figure 2.4\nRunway width can impose limitations depending on the undercarriage width, and runwaytaxiway separation depends on the wing span. The wing folding mechanism can be used to\nmitigate the problems with taxiway-object separation and separations at gate. Aircraft weight is\nanother potential limiting factor, however, it is assumed the weight of a SUGAR concept can be\naccommodated by the runway of the airport design group number selected based on the wing\nspan.\nObjective\nThe purpose of this task was to provide a parametric-based analysis for wing span/fold location\nfor a constraint analysis based on runway widths and lengths and minimum taxiway-runway\nseparation. Utilizing this information, the user can determine the number of United States\nairports that are accessible by a variable span SUGAR aircraft with and without a wing fold, as a\nfunction of the fold location and fold angle. This information can be used to aid in preliminary\n\n19\n\ndecision making as regards the desired exploration space for more integrated design of a wing\nfold mechanism at multiple potential aircraft sizes.\nThe outcome of this task is a dashboard analysis tool, constructed in MS Excel that utilizes\ncollected airport data, combined with aircraft-level aspects of the wing design to determine the\naccessible United States airports. Below, the data sources will be described, along with any\nnecessary assumptions employed, followed by a physical description of the dashboard\ncomponents. Finally, a sample use-case will be provided to demonstrate how the tool can be\nimplemented to perform the objective.\nDescription of Data Structure\nThe dashboard is a data-driven tool, based on several available and specifically collected or\ncomputed sets of information. The data are provided in the \xe2\x80\x98Runway Data\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Wing Fold\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98OAG Feb\n2012 Twy-Rwy\xe2\x80\x99 tabs within the dashboard.\nThe Runway Data tab contains a collection of United States airport runways, including their\nlatitude and longitudinal locations. This information is used to demonstrate the available airports\non a map of the contiguous United States. This data also contains effective runway lengths and\nrunway widths, used to determine which U.S. runways meet the criteria selected in the\ndashboard. Runway length is important because takeoff distance, although not directly related\nto the wing span, has to be considered in the airport compatibility study.\nThe Wing Fold data tab contains the first-order computations of the wing geometry, which allow\nthe dashboard to dynamically display changes in wingspan, fold length, and fold angle.\nThe OAG Feb 2012 Twy-Rwy tab contains the runway-taxiway separation information. This data\nwas obtained through the use of publically available internet mapping software, which allowed\nfor the examination of specific airports to manually measure the runway-taxiway separation for\nthe top 90% of United States airports based on total operations. The real runway-taxiway\nseparation of an airport can be more (and sometimes less) than the one required for its airport\ndesign group number assigned per the airport design specifications. The SUGAR concept may be\nable to operate at an airport of lower airport design group number, and those runway-taxiway\nseparation data have to be measured directly from the airport satellite photos. Some airports do\nnot have a taxiway, and in that case the runway-taxiway separation will be represented by the\ndistance between the runway centerline and the closest parallel taxi line in the apron or ramp.\nThis information is ultimately used at the dashboard level to determine the percentage of\nairports for a given airport ICAO Code that meet the necessary runway-taxiway separation\ncriterion.\n\n20\n\nDashboard Architecture\nThis dashboard is made in Excel, and it does not use macros to ensure compatibility with other\nversions of excel. The user-interface of the dashboard is located in the \xe2\x80\x98Dashboard\xe2\x80\x99 tab. The\nDashboard is arranged into three sections: the Runways, Wing Fold, and Runway-Taxiway\nsections. Each of these is impacted in certain ways by the inputs: wing span, fold length, fold\nangle, runway length, and runway width. These inputs are provided by the user based on the\nspecific analysis scenario, and can be varied dynamically to provide instantaneous tradeoff\nresults. In general, the color-coding on the dashboard uses a red/green paradigm, where red\ndesignates dissatisfaction of the filtering criteria, and green implies satisfaction. Some inputs are\nprovided as a range (minimum and maximum) whereas others are provided as specific values.\nThese are summarized in Table 2.3.\nTable 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 User inputs to the dashboard.\n\nVariable\nWingspan\nFold Length\nFold Angle\nRunway Length\nRunway Width\n\nUnits\nType\nMinimum Maximum\nFeet\nSingle-Value\n36\n326\nFeet\nSingle-Value\n0\n30\nDegrees Single-Value\n0\n135\nFeet\nRange\n0\n15000\nFeet\nRange\n0\n320\n\nThe Runways section of the dashboard is shown in Figure 2.6. The inputs to the Runways section\nare runway length and (required) runway width. This section lets the user filter from a list of over\n5,700 domestic runways of the continental United States by runway length and width. The user\ncan choose to include or exclude tower-less and military airports. The runway width should be\nselected based on the undercarriage width. However, the undercarriage width usually is not\nknown during the conceptual design stage. Instead, the user can provide an estimate of a\nreasonable range for the undercarriage width, and examine the impact of that range on the\nnumber of domestic runways that the SUGAR concept can operate on with a certain wing-fold\ndesign.\n\n21\n\nFigure 2.6 \xe2\x80\x93 The Runways section of the dashboard.\n\nThe Wing Fold section is shown in Figure 2.7. The inputs to the Wing Fold section are wing span,\nfold length and fold angle. The wing span input refers to the unfolded wing span. The fold length\nrefers to the length of the folded section from the point of the fold to the tip of the wing. The\nfold angle is an absolute value measured as the exterior angle from the span-wise axis of the\naircraft to the wing-fold section. The wing span after folding will be calculated based on the wing\ndesign inputs provided.\n\nFigure 2.7 \xe2\x80\x93 The Wing Fold section of the dashboard.\n\nThe airport design group number for the resulting aircraft configuration is computed and shown.\nThis design group number is also based on the wing span after folding. The ICAO Reference Code\nLetter is also provided. This information is then used to lookup the minimum runway-taxiway\nseparation for these aircraft based on Table 2.2.\n\n22\n\nThe Runway-Taxiway section is shown in Figure 2.8. The input to the Runway-Taxiway section is\nthe minimum required runway-taxiway separation (provided in feet), determined from the ICAO\nreference letter that corresponds to the specified aircraft configuration. Again, all comparisons\nare performed on the wingspan after folding to demonstrate the increased compatibility from\nwing-fold implementation.\n\nFigure 2.8 \xe2\x80\x93 The Runway-Taxiway section of the dashboard.\n\nThis section uses the minimum separation to filter a list of 1777 airports worldwide of Code C, D,\nE and F. The filter results are provided for each of the airport codes as a percentage of airports\nthat meet the minimum runway-taxiway separation distances for the specified configuration. The\nairport design specifications including ICAO Annex 14, Aerodromes, and FAA Advisory Circular\n50/5300-13, Airport Design, provide the guidelines and rules for selection/determination of the\nproper airport design group number, runway width and runway-taxiway separation. (5) (6)\nSample Use Case\nAs an example, a use-case is provided to demonstrate how the dashboard should be utilized. The\nexample is based on the SUGAR High (N+3 Advanced High Span) aircraft (1). The particular\nconfiguration has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of approximately 140,100 lbs. (not a\ndashboard input but provided for reference) and a wingspan of 215 feet. The Takeoff Field Length\n(TOFL) trades identified a minimum TOFL of 8,190 feet. For aircraft of this weight, per Advisory\nCircular 150/5300, the minimum runway width for this type of aircraft is 200 feet. (6) The\n\n23\n\nmaximum is unconstrained, as this use-case will assume that there is no max limit on runway\nwidth that the aircraft can operate on. These input values were provided to the dashboard to\nproduce the baseline front-view geometry shown in Figure 2.9.\n\nFigure 2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 Baseline front-view of the use-case SUGAR Volt aircraft.\n\nAnalyzing the United States airports that conform to the runway length and width specifications\nshows that only a negligible percentage of airports (19) airports in the continental United States\ncan operate this concept. The spatial distribution of these airports (shown in Figure 2.10) covers\nmany of the metro-plex regions when compared to the 21 areas identified by the FAA (6) in Figure\n2.11, with the most notable omission being the Denver, CO region, and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nFigure 2.10 \xe2\x80\x93 Runway-view shows the number of U.S. runways that meet the specified minimum width\n\n24\n\nFigure 2.11 \xe2\x80\x93 FAA Metroplex regions (7)\n\nThe airport design group and ICAO Reference Code Letter are VI and F respectively for the\nbaseline configuration. These designations correspond to a minimum runway-taxiway separation\nof approximately 623 feet. This information is used to determine the percentage (out of 1,777)\nof OAG airports that support this runway-taxiway separation. The input specifications result in\n40.6% of airports (721) supporting the minimum runway-taxiway separation required to operate\nthe aircraft without a wing-fold. Twenty-two of these airports are United States airports, as\nsummarized in Figure 2.12.\n\nFigure 2.12 \xe2\x80\x93 Breakdown of 1,777 OAG airports with respect to the runway-taxiway separation criteria.\n\nTo examine the potential impact of adding a wing-fold, the user can select a reasonable baseline\nfold angle and examine the impact of varying the fold length. In the interest of simplicity, the\nbaseline fold angle will be 90 degrees for this use-case, as shown in Figure 2.13.\n\n25\n\nFigure 2.13 \xe2\x80\x93 Folded configuration changes the airport design group and minimum runway-taxiway separation.\n\nVarying the fold length shows that there is an immediate change in the design group with a fold\nlength of only 2 feet. The change occurs in the airport design group, which affects the minimum\nrunway-taxiway separation. This change adds over 200 OAG airports with the necessary\nminimum runway-taxiway separation, and increases the number of United States airports from\n22 to 34. Further increasing the fold length to 24 feet provides another change to the airport\ndesign group, adding an additional 100 of the OAG airports and the number of U.S. airports\nenabled by the wing-fold increases to 38. Therefore, the user could reasonably conclude that\nwing-folds within the vicinity of 2 and 24 feet should be targeted for further exploration. If\nconsideration is warranted, the user can trade the location of the fold (i.e. \xe2\x80\x93 the length) by\nchanging the angle of the fold (reducing the range of motion required to fold the wing) to achieve\na similar effective span as shown in Figure 2.14.\n\nFigure 2.14 \xe2\x80\x93 Similar wingspan after folding can be achieved by trading fold length for fold angle.\n\n2.1.3\nVehicle Design Evolution\nThe initial release of the 765-095 SUGAR High configuration was generated under the first phase\nof the SUGAR program. The fuselage and empennage arrangement for the configuration are\ntypical for a high wing transport, but the wing, landing gear and their integration with the rest of\nthe vehicle occupied unexplored design territory.\nPhase II revised the initial release with many geometry refinements; several of these were the\nproduct of a detailed integration exercise between the fuselage, landing gear, and wing strut.\nThese changes resulted in configuration Revision A.\n\n26\n\nRevision A was used to initiate a planform and strut Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO). The\nresults of the optimization were used to derive Revision B. A high speed wing design, which set\nwing thickness distribution and airfoil shape, was then generated by Boeing for the resulting\nplanform. This design was released as Revision C which, in turn, was used as the starting point\nfor an increased fidelity high speed aerodynamic analysis, a low speed aerodynamics design, and\nan aeroelastic Finite Element Analysis (FEM). The resulting updates were rolled into the final\nconfiguration released for this phase of the strut braced wing study, Revision D. This process is\nillustrated in Figure 2.15.\n\n765-095\n\nPHASE I\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fuselage Refinement\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Baseline Assumptions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Landing Gear Integration\n\n765-095-RA\n\nPHASE II\nDoes not include wing / strut definition\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wing Planform MDO\n\n765-095-RB\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wing Design\n\n765-095-RC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Overflow Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DACVINE Analysis\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aeroelastic FEM\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Engine Integration Update\n\n765-095-RD\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aero Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mass Properties\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sizing\n\nFigure 2.15 \xe2\x80\x93 Configuration Evolution\n\n2.1.4\nWing Planform Development\nGeorgia Tech and Virginia Tech have, in partnership, developed a design environment which\nutilizes structures, aerodynamics, mass properties, and performance tools to explore the truss\nbraced wing design space. This capability was leveraged to determine a starting point for the\nSUGAR program. In summary, the effort was comprised of a coordination effort to baseline\nassumptions and requirements, an airfoil design task, and a strut and wing planform optimization\nled by the university team.\n2.1.4.1\nModel Analysis Coordination\nIn order to minimize any discrepancy in analysis constraints or methods, Boeing, Virginia Tech,\nand Georgia Tech discussed the truss braced wing MDO procedure used within the university\ndesign environment. Changes and constraints requested by Boeing are documented:\n\n27\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInterference drag for the wing and jury struts was calculated from a database of CFD data\nthat was run outside the MDO environment\nMach Ratio effects from the body were incorporated into the MDO environment.\nExcrescence drag was included for this MDO.\nLifting struts were assumed to be outside the scope of this study. Previous studies have\nshown that more optimum lift distributions can be achieved with a lifting strut. Boeing\nexperts believe that the interference drag penalty of a lifting strut in close proximity to\nthe wing will be severe and may not have been captured by the previous university CFD\nanalysis.\nAdvanced Material Properties (quasi-isotropic):\no E=10.5 MSI\no G=3.9 MSI\no Nu=0.325\no Ultimate Strain Allowable 4500 micro In/In\no Density = .057 lb/in^3\nA pseudo-dynamic gust is included in the MDO by factoring static gust loads by 1.0\nbetween wing root and truss brace. Outboard of truss brace a linear interpolation from\n1.0 (inboard) to 1.4 (at the wing tip) is used.\nThe design speed envelope of the airplane is illustrated in Figure 2.16.\n\n2.1.4.2\nBoeing 2D Airfoil Design\nAdvancements in design tools and computing resources have enabled three-dimensional wing\ndesign to become the standard at The Boeing Company. The SUGAR Phase II team included a\ntwo-dimensional design task for the sole purpose of constraining local wing sections to\nthicknesses that are appropriate for the drag divergence Mach number of interest, Mach 0.70.\nPrevious studies have shown that sectional lift coefficients are not likely to increase past 0.8. In\norder to press the state-of-the-art designs, it was decided to attempt to attain a sectional lift\ncoefficient of 0.9. Experience from the Phase I effort led the team to push the cruise altitude to\n43,000 feet.\n\n28\n\n0.6\n\n60,000\n\n0.7\n\n0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1.0 Mach\n\nDesign Dive Speed\n\n0.5\n\nMax Operating Speed\nOperational Speed\n\n50,000\n0.4\n\nPressure Altitude (ft)\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n10,000\n\n0\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nCalibrated Airspeed (Knots)\n\nFigure 2.16 \xe2\x80\x93 Design Speed Envelope\n\nAirfoil Design Tools\nBoeing utilizes both commercial codes and internally developed applications to design and\nanalyze aircraft geometry. The design process and tools used for a specific problem are\nspecifically tailored using recent code developments, user familiarity, and code applicability. For\nthis project, several analysis codes were used.\nCDISC \xe2\x80\x93 Inverse Design\n\nThe Constrained Direct Iterative Surface Curvature (CDISC) program is an aerodynamic-design\ntool for defining surfaces that match a prescribed pressure distribution. It uses streamline\ncurvature theory to adjust an existing geometry to the target pressure distribution. It was\ndeveloped as a stand-alone program by NASA that can easily be used in conjunction with various\nflow solvers and includes the capability to specify various geometry constraints (such as\nspanwise/chordwise curvature, thickness, etc.). The prevalent uses include the common suite of\nNavier Stokes codes: OVERFLOW, CFL3D, TLNS3D and USM3D. For the 2-D airfoil design done in\nthis study, CDISC was coupled to CFL3D.\n\n29\n\nOverflow \xe2\x80\x93Analysis\n\nOverflow is an overset grid flow solver for simulating fluid flow around solid bodies. It is a\ncompressible 3-D flow solver that solves the time-dependent, Reynolds-averaged, Navier-Stokes\nequations using multiple overset structured grids and has several turbulence models available.\nFor the 2-D analysis done in this study Overflow was used with the S-A turbulence model.\nCFL3D \xe2\x80\x93 Coupled to CDISC Inverse Design\n\nCFL3D is a Reynolds-averaged, thin-layer, Navier-Stokes flow solver for structured grids. It is used\nhere coupled to CDISC inverse design and used for its robustness, speed and ease of use\ncompared to Overflow. It was run with the Baldwin-Barth turbulence model which gave a good\nmatch to the pressure distribution predicted by Overflow.\nMethodology, Constraints, and Resulting Airfoil Characteristics\nTwo approaches were used for generating airfoil data for this task. The turbulent airfoil design\nwas chosen from a library based on historical experience. The airfoil chosen was designed for a\nhigher Mach number and lower lift coefficient than the task requirements thus adjustments to\nthe data were made based on internal methods to account for the differences. The design for an\nupper surface laminar airfoil was seeded from the turbulent airfoil. The process used an inverse\ndesign method to maintain a pre-determined, favorable pressure gradient on the upper surface\nfrom just aft of the leading edge terminating at a shock whose location was prescribed as far aft\nas deemed reasonable based on engineering judgment and previous experience. The section lift\nwas maintained as well as the maximum thickness of the airfoil. The inverse design was\nperformed using CDISC and CFL3D. The resulting airfoil had a lower surface pressure ramp that\nwas favorable for laminar flow, even though it was not specifically addressed in the design\nprocess, so a lower surface laminar design could use the same airfoil shape allowing the trade\nstudy to focus on high lift leading edge devices. The airfoils will be referred to as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nT1 \xe2\x80\x93 Turbulent Baseline Airfoil\nL1 \xe2\x80\x93 Upper Surface Laminar\n\nOnce the airfoil shapes were defined, Overflow was used to conduct 2D angle of attack and Mach\nnumber sweeps using the RANS S-A turbulence model. The resulting data was used to generate\ncurves of sectional drag coefficient vs. Mach number for a fixed lift coefficient. Drag divergence\nis defined as the point where the slope of this curve reaches 0.1. The three designed airfoils drag\ndivergence characteristics are shown in Figure 2.17.\n\n30\n\nLaminar (Upper & Lower Surfaces)\n\nLaminar (Upper Surface Only)\n\nDrag Coefficient\n\nTurbulent (Baseline)\n\n0.60\n\n0.61\n\n0.62\n\n0.63\n\n0.64\n\n0.65\n\n0.66\n\n0.67\n\n0.68\n\n0.69\n\n0.70\n\n0.71\n\n0.72\n\n0.73\n\n0.74\n\n0.75\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 2.17 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil Drag Divergence\n\nIn parallel to calculating divergence Mach number, a Boeing proprietary process was used to\nestimate the lift coefficient for buffet onset at various Mach numbers. The lift coefficient was\nthen divided by the FAA required 1.3g margin to determine the maximum operational lift\ncoefficient for the section. The Korn factor was then calculated at both the drag divergence and\nthe buffet limit points; the lowest Korn factor was then chosen for distribution to the university\nMDO team.\nThere are two inherent assumptions in the approach used for this task. The first assumption is\nthat the divergence Mach number can be approximated by the Korn equation. For the purposes\nof this study, this assumption is reasonable. The second (and likely invalid) assumption is that the\nbuffet boundary follows the Korn equation. If buffet boundary is used to constrain the Korn\nfactor, the result would be overly conservative as cruise lift coefficient decreases, but would\nallow for wings that were all technically viable at or below cruise lift coefficient of 0.9. For this\nstudy, a buffet constrained Korn factor was used. The resulting airfoil characteristics are shown\nin Table 2.4.\n\n31\n\nTable 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil Characteristics\n\n(T1)\nTurbulent\nThickness (%)\nCamber (%)\nMDesign\nClDesign\nMdd\nKA\nEstimated Clbuffet\nLaminar Run (%)\n\n(L1)\nUpper\nSurface\nLaminar\n\n(L1)\nBoth\nSurfaces\nLaminar\n\n0.133\n2.3\n0.7\n0.9\n0.707\n0.929\n1.29\nN/A\n\n0.12\n2.3\n0.7\n0.9\n0.6997\n0.915\n1.24\n54\n\n0.12\n2.3\n0.7\n0.9\n0.6997\n0.916\n1.25\n54 / 40\n\n2.1.4.3\nSUGAR TBW Configuration Multi-Disciplinary Optimization\nThe aircraft design space was explored using the university MDO environment. The performance\nrequirements, tool background, and trades are covered in the following sections.\nSUGAR TBW Configuration and Design Requirements\n\nJury\nStrut\n\nFigure 2.18 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR TBW concept\n\nThis airplane has a conventional wing-tail arrangement with a fuselage, a high wing, and a T-tail.\nFor enhanced takeoff and low speed flight performance, slats and flaps are provided. The\nfuselage accommodates a mixed seat arrangement of 12 first class and 142 economy class seats.\nThe fuselage geometry had been refined from that of the Phase I configuration by Boeing and\nwas utilized in this MDO study. Aerodynamically shaped landing gear pods are attached under\nthe belly of the fuselage, providing a structurally efficient integration of the strut. Two advanced\nhigh bypass ratio engines are attached under the wing.\n\n32\n\nPayload\n\nThe target payload and range capability of the TBW aircraft is depicted in Figure 2.19. The aircraft\nis required to fly longer than 900 nm distance carrying the maximum payload of 46,000 lbs. This\nmaximum range at the maximum payload is labeled Pt1 in the payload range envelope, which is\nthe intersection of the maximum zero fuel weight limit line and the MTOW limit line. With the\ndesign payload, defined as 154 passengers with 200 lbs per passenger, the aircraft must be\ncapable of achieving at least 3,500 nm range. This maximum range at the full cabin loading is\nlabeled Pt2 in the payload range envelope. In addition, total available onboard fuel volume must\nbe greater than mission fuel required for Pt2 mission by 10 percent. Pt3 represents an average\nmission determined from the Boeing Phase I study, at which the vehicle is anticipated to operate\nmost frequently.\n\nPt1\nPt3\n\nMax Payload: 46,000 lbs\n(200 lbs X 154 PAX + 15,200 lbs)\nPt2 Design Payload: 30800 lbs\n(200 lbs X 154 PAX)\nAvailable fuel volume must\nbe greater than 1.1 x\nmission fuel @Pt2\n\n900 nm\n\n3500 nm\n\nRange\n\nPt1 range must be\ngreater than 900\nFigure 2.19 \xe2\x80\x93 Payload and range capabilities for SUGAR TBW aircraft\n\nRange performance was evaluated with the N+3 mission profile utilized in Boeing SUGAR Phase I\nstudy. The reference profile is illustrated in Figure 2.20. Initially, the aircraft climbs out for\nminimum fuel burn with no restrictions in terms of speed and altitude, cruise-climbs at Mach 0.7,\nmaintaining optimum altitude, and descends at maximum L/D.

The original TBW MDAO framework was implemented in\nModelCenter with a number of contributing analyses such as aerodynamic analysis and structural\nanalysis developed to analyze TBW configurations, as well as conventional tube-wing\nconfigurations. For more details regarding the analysis modules not described in this paper,\n\n34\n\nplease refer to Ref (8). In order to address design elements specific to the SUGAR configuration,\nas well as to improve analysis fidelity, a number of modifications were applied to the original\nTBW tool with Boeing support. These modifications included modules for aerodynamic analysis,\nstructural analysis, propulsion system modeling, and tail sizing. Each of these modules is\ndiscussed in greater detail in the following sections.\nAerodynamic analysis\nAerodynamic analysis modules were updated to account for the effect of the fuselage on the\nairflow over the wing. An empirical equation provided by Boeing that related Mach number at\nwing leading edge to spanwise location along the wing was implemented. Figure 2.21 depicts\nvariation of M-ratio, defined as ratio of wing leading edge Mach number to free stream Mach\nnumber used for this study.\n1.02\n\n10% Reduction from SUGAR\nSUGAR Fuselage Radius\n10% Increase from SUGAR\n\nM-Ratio\n\n1.015\n1.01\n1.005\n1\n0.995\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nSpanwise location (ft)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFigure 2.21 \xe2\x80\x93 Ratio of wing leading edge Mach number to free stream Mach number\n\nStructure Analysis\nThe structural analysis module was updated to handle different boundary conditions and to\nenable the modeling of dynamic gust loads. Boeing had expressed significant interest in\nunderstanding the tradeoffs of using pin-joints for the strut and truss assembly. The use of pinjoints can have a favorable influence on the fabrication, assembly and maintenance of the truss\nstructure. The sizing of such a structure required the ability to model the joints between wing\nand truss members using pin-joints or ball-joints. Pin-joints allow the transmission of all force\ncomponents and all moment components except the one along the axis of the pin. Ball joints\nallow the transmission of all force components without any moment transfer. The code was\nmodified so that a simple flag in the input deck could be changed to select one of the three\nconditions at each connection: rigid joint, pin-joint and ball-joint. A similar flag for the boundary\ncondition on the wing and strut allowed the selection between fixed and pinned boundary\ncondition.\nThe structural sizing code developed at Virginia Tech used quasi-steady load definitions. In other\nwords, the influence of a dynamic gust on stress levels could not be taken into account. Boeing\nconsidered this to be an important effect for the design studies, and suggested that in order to\ninclude the influence of dynamic gust in a quasi-steady load definition, an additional scaling\n\n35\n\nfactor be used for the loads from the wing-strut joint to the wing tip. The scaling was defined to\nbe linear from 1.0 at the wing-strut intersection, to (1.0+x) at the wing tip, where \'x\' is a factor\ndefined by Boeing. The structural sizing code was modified to include this scaling influence. The\nwing structure analyses were conducted based on advanced material properties provided by\nBoeing.\nPropulsion System Model\nThe propulsion module was revised based on gFan+ engine data supplied from GE. This module\nwas used for the configuration analysis and optimization. Thereafter, one configuration was\ndown-selected and the effect of cruise Mach number was analyzed. For this purpose, Georgia\nTech developed engine decks for each Mach number considered, in addition to using the gFan+\nengine data from General Electric.\nTail Sizing\nA new tail sizing module was incorporated into the MDO environment. The analysis commences\nwith repositioning the wing to align 25% MAC with a target longitudinal location provided by\nBoeing for a proper static margin. The horizontal tail and vertical tail areas are calculated based\non a surrogate model derived from a dataset generated by Boeing using a proprietary tool. The\nestimates required tail volume coefficients for a number of input parameters such as wing span,\nfuselage length, spanwise engine location, CG excursions due to fuel burn and payload, and\nlength of tail moment arms. Once tail areas are calculated, the vertical tail location is adjusted\nsuch that the aft spar of the horizontal tail connects to a fuselage frame at a specific location.\nSubsequently, the horizontal tail is relocated such that the aft spars of the horizontal tail are\naligned with the aft spar of the vertical tail. Since this adjustment changes length of tail moment\narms, the process iterates until it converges.\nIn addition to those major disciplinary codes, the TBW MDO environment evolved through\nincorporation of numerous minor enhancements such as wing tip clearance angle analysis, the\ninclusion of engine location as a design variable, and automated wing repositioning to align 25%\nMAC to a target longitudinal location. The weight analysis module was updated to estimate\nchanges in aircraft center of gravity due to fuel burn, required for the tail sizing module. While\nthe design environment featured numerous modifications to improve its fidelity, there were\nseveral areas in which additional improvement is particularly desirable. In particular, the landing\ngear pod drag estimation featured lower fidelity than other parts of the environment, and no\nanalysis of flutter was included in the MDO framework. These areas of deficiency are expected\nto be assessed in detail in subsequent tasks as part of higher fidelity analyses and tests conducted\nby Boeing.\n\n36\n\nIn order to support tool development, the team developed a set of test configurations as test\nbeds. Those test configurations have been matured along with tool enhancement as depicted in\nFigure 2.22.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Number of flight\nattendants was\nchanged to three\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maximum structural\npayload was included\nin load analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fuel allowance for a\nmissed approach was\nremoved\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aircraft was sized for\n3500 nm range\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strut chord increases\nto 70% of wing chord\n\nTC201\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Landing gear pod\nincluded\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Minimum skin gage\nadjusted to 0.15\ninches\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dynamic gust load\nadjustment of\noutboard wing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Drag estimation at\noff-design points was\nrevised\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CG travel due to fuel\nburn were reflected\ninto HT sizing\n\nTC202\n\nTool Version 2.1.0.2i\n\n2.1.1.2m\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mixed BCs on strut/jury\n\xe2\x80\xa2 No Strut/Wing\nconnection member\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Material properties\nupdated\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wing folding location\nupdated\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GE gFan+ engine\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fuselage effect on\nairflow over wing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NLF on upper surface\nonly\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Korn Factor:0.95->0.91\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Krueger L.E. flap, single\nslotted T.E. flap\n\nTC203\n2.2.3.2u\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NLF on HT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduce wing t/c\n\n2.2.6.3d\n\nTC204a\n\n2.2.3.2u\n\nTC303\n2.2.3.3a\n\nJune 30\n\nSep. 12\n\nTC204\n\nTC203a\n\nTC201\n\nTC205\n\nTC303a\n2.2.3.3a\n\n2.2.6.3d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tapering strut design\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Engine location as an\noptimization variable\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unified environment for\nthree wing/truss systems\n\nTC105B\n2.2.6.3f\n\nTC105C\n2.2.6.3f\n\nTC205B\n2.2.6.3f\n\nTC205C\n2.2.6.3f\n\nTC305B\n2.2.6.3f\n\nTC305C\n\nSBW\nBall joint\nSBW\nClamped\nOne-jury TBW\nBall joint\nOne-jury TBW\nClamped\nTwo-jury TBW\nBall joint\nTwo-jury TBW\nClamped\n\n2.2.6.3f\n\nFigure 2.22 \xe2\x80\x93 Test Configuration and Tool Evolution\n\nSUGAR MDO Approach\nCompared with a conventional cantilever wing configuration, the TBW configuration has a\nsignificantly larger design space, because of myriads of possible truss system designs. In addition,\nwing natural laminar flow (NLF) design options add another dimension into the already\ncomplicated design space. The overwhelming scope of the TBW MDO is managed with a staged\napproach illustrated in Figure 2.23.

For the second condition, both ends were considered\nto be clamped (rigid joint)\nThe Stage 2 study is aimed at investigating alternative natural laminar flow options in conjunction\nwith high lifting system options based on the best TBW architecture selected from Stage 1.\nThe Stage 3 study is aimed at refining a TBW configuration selected from Stage 2 from the airvehicle integration point of view through an iterative, experienced human-in-the-loop process,\nleading up to a final configuration for subsequent research activities including detailed OML\nlofting and higher fidelity analyses and tests, which will be conducted by Boeing.\n\nStage 1\n\nTBW Architecture\nand Wing Span Limit\n\nOne strut\n\nC200 Series\n\nC300 Series\n\nOne strut + one jury\n\nC100 Series\n\nOne strut + two juries\n\nBoundary conditions\n-All clamped\n-Mixed ball joint\n-Mixed pin joint (as time permits)\n\nChoose One TBW Architecture\n\nStage 2\n\nNatural Laminar\nFlow Option\n\nNLF/HLD Option1\n\nNLF/HLD Option2\n\nNLF/HLD Option3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Turbulent\n\xe2\x80\xa2 L.E.

From this test\nconfiguration, two parallel branches of optimization were simultaneously begun. The first\nbranch, shown on the left in Figure 2.24, exclusively utilized Design Explorer as the optimization\ntool. A suitably wide range was allowed for each design variable so as to provide a sufficiently\nbroad design space for the optimizer to operate in. This is shown by the dotted black line in the\nleft column of Figure 2.24. The results from this optimization run were then analyzed for\noptimality (with respect to minimization of the objective function) and feasibility (with respect\nto satisfying of all problem constraints). In particular, the obtained solution was checked for\ndesign variables, which may have finished at either their respective upper or lower bounds. In\nthis case, the solution lay on at least one face of the hypercube representing the allowable design\nspace. In case of such an occurrence, the design variable bounds for the concerned variables\nwere adjusted, following which a subsequent optimization run was commenced. This procedure\nwas continued until a solution was obtained for which infringement on the design variable\nbounds was either eliminated or minimized. Mathematically, such a solution represents at least\na local optimum, i.e. there exists a finite design space neighborhood in the vicinity of the solution\nwhere the objective function value is higher than that for the solution. The run-time for Design\nExplorer is strongly related to the number of design variables being considered for the\noptimization. The MDO analyses carried out at Georgia Tech considered strut-braced wing (SBW),\ntruss-braced wing (TBW) with one jury support, and truss-braced wing (TBW) with two jury\nsupports, featuring a progressively increasing number of design variables that were necessary to\ndefine the more complicated geometry involved. Typical Design Explorer run-times recorded for\na single MDO were in the range of 2-3 days.\nThe second branch of the optimization, shown on the right in Figure 2.24, utilized Darwin as the\noptimization tool. Darwin utilizes genetic algorithm based optimization, and is better suited for\nmulti-modal design spaces. However, Darwin has a significantly longer run-time than Design\nExplorer (run-times of the order of days were not uncommon), and hence the second branch uses\nDarwin only as its first step. The \xe2\x80\x9ctop\xe2\x80\x9d solutions obtained from using Darwin were used as starting\npoints for subsequent optimization searches using Design Explorer, as shown in the figure.\n\n39\n\nFigure 2.24 \xe2\x80\x93 Optimization approach for MDO study\n\nIt should also be mentioned that in the initial stages of the MDO study, the sensitivities of the\nresponses to certain initially selected design variables were analyzed. If the effect of a design\nvariable on system level responses was found to be insufficient to warrant further consideration,\nthe design variable was dropped from subsequent optimizations, which thus featured a reduced\ndimensionality of the design space. For example, at the initial stages of the study, the sweep\nangles of the inboard and outboard sections of the wing were considered separately. However,\na sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of the outboard wing sweep angle on the system\nmetrics was negligibly small. As a result, the outboard wing section sweep angle was set to equal\nthe inboard wing section sweep angle, with only the latter being retained as an active design\nvariable.

An optimization process may\ndrive a design to an extreme to gain a minuscule, additional improvement in the objective\nfunction incurring significant penalties or potential technical issues in other design criteria. For\ninstance, a long and slender wing may reduce the number of serviceable airports, and it may also\nbecome more vulnerable to aeroelastic instability. Therefore, the dominance of very high AR\nwing designs warrants the need for investigating the sensitivity of fuel burn with respect to wing\nspan.\nTo this end, three TBW architectures are optimized for different span limits, and the results are\nsummarized in Figure 2.25. Comparison of the optimum configurations led to a few observations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor a given wing span, adding a jury leads to a higher AR, less swept, and smaller wing\nrequiring a higher engine thrust, which results in a higher wing loading and a higher\nthrust-to-weight ratio.\nA larger span allows a higher optimum wing aspect ratio, which is well expected.\n\nIn addition to the span constraint, the take-off field length and maximum range of Pt1 appeared\nto be the active constraints for all optimum designs. The available fuel volume and the maximum\nrange of Pt2 constraints also became active for a few cases.\nTotal wing and truss weights of the optimum TBW configurations are compared in Figure 2.26,\nwhich clearly indicates that a longer span (or higher aspect ratio) wing is heavier. For the same\nwing span limit, it is evident that adding a jury leads to a lighter wing. However, the two jury TBW\nconfiguration provides only a marginal benefit in wing weight reduction relative to one jury TBW.\nAerodynamic efficiency generally improves as the span constraint is relaxed as shown in Figure\n2.27, which compares lift-to-drag ratio at a representative cruise condition. Adding a jury\nincreases drag, resulting in degradation in aerodynamic efficiency for most cases. Such drag\npenalties are found to be substantial for a two jury TBW, outweighing the weight benefit.\nMaximum Take-off weight (MTOW) is compared in Figure 2.28. Overall, MTOW increases as the\nwing span constraint is relaxed.\n\n42\n\nFigure 2.25 \xe2\x80\x93 Matrix of optimum TBW configurations obtained from MDO\n\nThe one-jury TBW appeared to be the architecture that offers the best fuel efficiency for the\nSUGAR mission throughout all span limits investigated in this study as shown in Figure 2.29.\nOverall, relaxation of the span constraint results in higher fuel efficiency. However, the benefit\nquickly diminishes after the span reaches 170 ft, offering less than 1.4% fuel burn improvement\nfor any further increase in wing span. Therefore, a one-jury TBW with 170 ft span, designated as\nC210b, was selected as a baseline for the Stage 2 MDO study that is aimed at investigating the\neffect of alternative natural laminar flow options.\n\n43\n\n25000\n\nC100\nC200\n\nWing Weight (lb)\n\n20000\n\nC300\n\n15000\n10000\n5000\n0\nb<150\n\nb<160\n\nb<170\n\nb<180\n\nUnconstrained\n\nFigure 2.26 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of total wing truss system weight\n\nL/D (M0.7, Alt 45k, CL 0.7)\n\n35\n\nC100\n\n30\n\nC200\n\n25\n\nC300\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nb<150\n\nb<160\n\nb<170\n\nb<180\n\nUnconstrained\n\nFigure 2.27 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of lift-to-drag ratio\n146000\n144000\n\nMTOW (lb)\n\n142000\n\nC100\nC200\nC300\n\n140000\n138000\n136000\n134000\n132000\nb<150\n\nb<160\n\nb<170\n\nb<180\n\nFigure 2.28 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of maximum take-off weight\n\n44\n\nUnconstrained\n\n6300\n\nC100\n\nBLock Fuel, Pt3 (lb)\n\n6200\n\nC200\nC300\n\n6100\n6000\n5900\n5800\n5700\n5600\nb<150\n\nb<160\n\nb<170\n\nb<180\n\nUnconstrained\n\nFigure 2.29 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of block fuel weight\n\nStage 2: Down-selection of NLF Option\nThe MDO study also analyzed the effect of natural laminar flow (NLF) on the aircraft metrics of\ninterest and objective function (block fuel for Pt3 mission). The NLF analysis was performed in\nconjunction with an analysis of various high-lift device (HLD) options. The NLF-HLD configurations\nof interest are described in Table 2.7.\nTable 2.7 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR MDO NLF Options and Associated HLD System\n\nDuring the Stage 1 study, low speed performance metrics including take-off and landing field\nlength, approach speed, and second segment climb rate were calculated with a simple empirical\nmethod embedded in FLOPS, which does not require detailed low speed aerodynamic data. The\nStage 2 study employed the more detailed field performance analysis method available in FLOPS\nin order to more accurately propagate the effect of HLD options to aircraft field performance.\nLow speed aerodynamics for the HLD options were predicted offline through the use of a higher\nfidelity aerodynamics tool, and the resulting low speed drag polars and lift coefficient vs. angle\nof attack (CL vs. \xce\xb1) curves were incorporated into the TBW tool.\nAs shown in Table 2.7, the first configuration, the C210 series, featured natural laminar flow only\non the upper surface of the wing. In addition, it is equipped with a leading-edge Krueger flap and\na single-slot trailing-edge flap as high-lift devices. The second configuration, the C211 series,\n\n45\n\nfeatured fully turbulent flow over both the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. For this\nconfiguration, a leading-edge slat and a single-slot trailing-edge flap were considered as high-lift\ndevices. Finally, the third configuration, the C212 series, featured NLF on both the upper and\nlower surfaces of the wing. No leading-edge high-lift device was considered, and this\nconfiguration featured only a single-slot trailing-edge flap. The different HLD options give\ndifferent maximum lift coefficient values for the aircraft that affect only its takeoff and landing\nperformance, respectively through takeoff field length (TOFL) and landing approach speed\n(VAPP). The NLF condition affects the cruise performance, through the variation of skin friction\ndrag, and thus has an effect on the objective function (block fuel). Additionally, the extent of NLF,\ngiven by the location of transition from laminar to turbulent flow in percentage of wing chord\nwas also varied during the analysis. Optimum configurations obtained for three NLF options are\nshown in Figure 2.30.\nC210b\n\nUnit\nSREF: ft2\nb: ft\nTSL: lb\n\nAR:17.05\nSREF:1693\nb:170\n\nC211b\n\nb<170\n\nW/S=81.8 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.267\n\nTSL:18465\n\nC212b\n\nb<170\n\nW/S=95.4 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.287\n\nAR:19.93\nSREF:1451\nb:170\n\nTSL:19860\n\nb<170\n\nW/S=73.3 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.265\n\nAR:15.20\nSREF:1900\nb:170\n\nTSL:18477\n\nFigure 2.30 \xe2\x80\x93 Optimum TBW configurations obtained for different NLF options\n\nFigure 2.31 shows a comparison of the aerodynamic efficiencies of the optimized designs for each\ncategory. The lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio, used as a measure of the aerodynamic efficiency, was\nevaluated at 45,000 ft, Mach 0.70 and a lift coefficient of 0.70. Owing to the reduction in skin\nfriction drag, the C212 configuration (NLF on both upper and lower surface) has the best\naerodynamic efficiency, while the 211 configuration (fully turbulent flow) has the lowest. Within\nthe same configuration, the aerodynamic efficiency is seen to be higher when the span constraint\nis relaxed to 180 ft as compared to 170 ft. This is expected, since the higher span limit allows for\na higher aspect ratio that results in improved aerodynamic efficiency. Within the C210 and C212\nseries, it is also seen that the aerodynamic efficiency is positively related to the extent of NLF,\nwith a delayed transition to turbulent flow allowing for higher efficiencies.\n\n46\n\n35.0\n\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\n\nC210\n\nC211\n\nBoth Surface NLF\n\nL/D\n\n20.0\n\nUpper Surface NLF\n\n25.0\n\nTurbulent\n\nb<170, 70%\n\n30.0\n\nC212\n\nFigure 2.31 \xe2\x80\x93 Aerodynamic efficiency of NLF configurations\n\nFigure 2.32 shows the block fuel of the Pt3 (900 nmi) mission for the three configurations. Among\nthe three NLF configurations, the C212 series has the best block fuel performance on account of\nthe largest reduction in skin friction drag owing to natural laminar flow on both upper and lower\nwing surfaces. For the same reason, the C211 series (all turbulent flow) suffers the most\nsignificant block fuel penalty. For the C211 series (all turbulent flow), the block fuel performance\nis seen to improve when the wing-span constraint is relaxed from 170 ft to 180 ft. Further, within\nthe C210 and C212 series, the block fuel performance is improved as the allowable extent of NLF\n(prior to transition to turbulent flow) is increased.\nIt was found that the take-off field length constraint is one of the main drivers for the C210 series\n(NLF on wing upper surface) and the C212 series (NLF on both upper and lower surface),\nrendering significantly low wing loadings as depicted in Figure 2.30. C212b wing loading is as low\nas 73 lb/ft2. C210b wing loading is slightly higher but only 82 lb/ft2. The C212 series outfitted with\na trailing edge flap only is found to have only little room to improve take-off maximum lift\ncoefficient. The C210 series were re-examined with hypothetical improvements to take-off\nmaximum lift coefficient.\nThe investigation indicates that the C210 series (NLF on wing upper surface) can be as fuel\nefficient as C212 series (NLF on both upper and lower surface) if maximum lift coefficient of 2.2\nis achieved as illustrated in Figure 2.33. A subsequent study on low speed aerodynamics\nconfirmed that maximum lift coefficient of 2.2 is achievable by increasing the flap area and takeoff flap deflection angle while maintaining a sufficient margin for the second segment climb\nperformance requirement as depicted in Figure 2.34. Based on Stage 1 and 2 studies, the NLF on\nwing upper surface option with a 170 ft wing span and take off CLmax of 2.2, labeled as C210b2.2,\nwas selected as the baseline for further refinement.\n\n47\n\n6400\n6300\nb<170, 70%\n\nBlock Fuel (lbs)\n\n6200\n6100\n6000\n5900\n5800\n5700\n\nBLock Fuel, Pt3 (lb)\n\n5600\n5500\n5400\n\nC210\n\nC211\n\nC212\n\nFigure 2.32 \xe2\x80\x93 Pt3 block fuel for NLF configurations\n\nBlock Fuel (lbs)\n\nNLF on\nWing Upper Surface\n6000\n5800\n5600\n5400\n\nCLmax\n1.8\n\nCLmax\n2.0\n\nNLF on Wing\nUpper and\nAll\nLower\nTurbulent\nSurfaces\n\nCLmax\n2.2\n\n5200\n5000\n\nWing Span is limited to 170 ft for all\nFigure 2.33 \xe2\x80\x93 Block fuel improvement of C210 series by increasing maximum lift coefficient\n\n48\n\n12000\nTOFL\n\nTOFL (ft), SSFOR (ft)\n\n10000\n\nSSFOR\n\nTOFL\nTarget\n8190 ft\n\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n10 deg\n\n18 deg\n\n20 deg\n\n22 deg\n\n24 deg\n\n1.8022\n\n2.1761\n\n2.2397\n\n2.2868\n\n2.3328\n\nFigure 2.34 \xe2\x80\x93 TOFL and second segment climb excess thrust for varying flap deflection angles\n\nStage 3: Refinement of Down-selected Configuration\nC210b2.2 has been further refined addressing potential air-vehicle integration issues, which\ncould not be fully assessed within the MDO framework. First, high lift device arrangement was\nadjusted to extend the leading edge flap to the tip of the wing. With a revised low speed polar,\nC201b2.2 was re-optimized while wing area and aspect ratio were fixed. Subsequently, Boeing\nconducted a preliminary OML and wing structure integration study, and finalized wing sweep and\ntaper ratio of the inboard and outboard wing sections. And finally, wing anhedral angle was set\nto 1.5 deg to ensure appropriate stability characteristics of the aircraft, and the rest of the still\nactive design variables were re-optimized, which formed the final TBW configuration (C401c)\nfrom the MDO study. Since this refinement was applied to a limited subset of the design space,\nchanges in Pt3 mission block fuel during the process were found to be inconsequential as shown\nin Figure 2.36.\n\n49\n\nDown-selected\nfrom Stg. 1 and\nStg. 2 MDO\n\nBoeing wing layout\n(Straighten TE spar,\nAlign strut and LG\nattach. structures)\n\nUpdated low\nspeed polar\n\nC210b2.2\n\nWing dihedral\n-1.5 deg\n\nC401a\n\nC210b2.17\n\nC401c\n\nMain wing sweep and\nTR was frozen\n\nWing area and AR\nwere frozen\n\nAll wing and truss\nsurface planforms\nwere frozen.\n\nSref=1502 ft2\nb= 170 ft\n\nSref=1502 ft2\nb= 170 ft\n\nSref=1502 ft2\nb= 170 ft\n\nSref=1502 ft2\nb= 170 ft\n\nW/S=90.1 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.238\n\nW/S=90.9 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.250\n\nW/S=90.9 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.248\n\nW/S=90.9 lb/ft2\nT/W=0.248\n\nFigure 2.35 \xe2\x80\x93 Configuration refinement overview\n\nBlock fuel (lb)\n\n6000\n5800\n5600\n5400\n5200\n5000\nC211b2.2\n\nC211b2.17\n\nC401a\n\nC401c\n\nFigure 2.36 \xe2\x80\x93 Changes in Pt3 Mission block fuel during Stage 3\n\nCruise Speed Sensitivity Study\nThe effect of the cruise Mach number was investigated in conjunction with the impact on aircraft\ncost. Prior to this, all optimizations had been performed at a default cruise Mach number of 0.70.\nFor this analysis however, the environment was modified slightly to allow for aerodynamic\nlookup tables to be generated for varying cruise Mach numbers.\nThe effect of cruise Mach number on the block fuel performance of an optimized TBW-aircraft\nwas analyzed across the Mach number range 0.60 \xe2\x80\x93 0.80 (in increments of 0.05), which is the\nrange in which configurations of this nature may be expected to operate. Also, for each Mach\nnumber, a custom engine deck was generated using a nonproprietary version of NPSS gFan+\nengine model, which Georgia Tech developed to closely represent GE gFan+ model based on\npublic domain data (1). Georgia Tech gFan+ engines were designed for alternate cruise speeds as\nfollows:\n\n50\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAerodynamic design point Bypass Ratio was held constant at 13\nEngine sizing points and conditions were held constant except for cruise Mach and\naltitude\nDesign point Fan Pressure Ratio (FPR), Low Pressure Compressor Pressure Ratio (LPCPR),\nwere adjusted to optimize propulsive efficiency for alternate cruise Mach by adjusting\nOPR to account for lower/higher total temperature at lower/higher cruise Mach number\nSizing the engine for lower cruise Mach numbers, allowing for higher cruise OPR, yielding\nsome TSFC reduction in addition to benefits from reduced flight speed\n\nFor each Mach number, the Pt3 mission block fuel was set as the objective function for the\noptimizer, and the geometric and performance constraints outlined in Table 2.5 were applied to\nthis study as before. ModelCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Design Explorer optimizer was then used to carry out the\noptimization.

As expected, the\nwing sweep increases progressively with increase of Mach number. In addition, for the higher\nMach numbers, the outboard section of the wing is more tapered and has a lower thickness-to-\n\n51\n\nchord ratio. As expected, for the higher Mach numbers, the thrust requirement is higher, and\nthere is a monotonic reduction in the cruise L/D. On account of the monotonic increase in aircraft\ngross weight coupled with a much smaller variation in wing planform area, the higher Mach\nnumber designs also have a slightly higher wing loading.\nFor each of the designs shown in Table 2.8, all of the constraints were satisfied, and there were\nminor variations in the actual constraint values.\n\nFigure 2.37 \xe2\x80\x93 Effect of cruise Mach number of Pt. 3 mission fuel burn\n\nIn addition to an analysis of the variation of aircraft geometry with increasing cruise Mach\nnumber, a key observation of this work was the variation in the Pt. 3 mission block fuel, which is\nshown in Figure 2.37. The gray curve represents the results obtained from the Boeing SUGAR\nPhase 1 Report (1), and these are included here for comparison purposes.\nThe optimal designs denoted by the blue curve represent designs that all use the GE gFan+ engine\ndeck (for Mach 0.70). Since the cruise Mach number range is from 0.60 \xe2\x80\x93 0.80, for all but one of\nthe designs (i.e. Mach 0.70), the engine deck represents an off-design operating point for the\nengine. The resulting penalty in block fuel performance is clear from the shape of the blue curve\nbelow and above the design operating Mach number of Mach 0.70.\nThe red curve denotes optimal designs obtained using custom GT engine decks for each relevant\nMach number of interest. In other words, each airplane is optimized with an engine model\n\n52\n\ndesigned for cruise operation at the corresponding Mach number. The results obtained clearly\nshow an increasing trend in block fuel as the cruise Mach number is increased.\nIt should be noted that the previously obtained C401c design (within dotted circle) is the design\npoint that is common to both the curves, since the gFan+ engine is optimized for a cruise Mach\nnumber of 0.70, which also happens to be the actual cruise Mach number for this design.\n\nFigure 2.38 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of drag breakdown\n\nIt can be seen that the slope of the red curve is higher than that of the gray curve. This can be\nexplained by a consideration of the aerodynamic drag breakdown of the TBW optimal designs.\nFigure 2.38 shows the breakdown of the aerodynamic drag of each design into induced (CDi)\ndrag, friction drag (CDf), wave drag (CDw) and interference drag (CDint). The induced drag\ncoefficient reduces with increasing Mach number due to a reduction in the lift coefficient at\ncruise. The interference drag is reasonably constant across the Mach number range considered,\nand as expected, the wave drag is negligible for the lower Mach numbers but is significant as the\nMach number increases.\nThe sharp increase in the wave drag originates from the fact that the landing gear pod is fixed\nrelative to the fuselage of the aircraft for all the designs. The optimization affects the design of\nthe wing, strut and juries, but not that of the fuselage or the landing gear pod. Now, as the cruise\nMach number is increased, the optimizer naturally increases the sweep angle of the wings to\nreduce the wing wave drag contribution. However, as a result of the fixed position and geometry\nof the landing gear pod, the strut-pod attachment point is fixed, and this prevents the strut from\nbeing swept back as much as the wing. As a result the strut sweep angle is considerably less than\nthat of the wing at the higher Mach numbers (e.g., Mach 0.60 compared to Mach 0.80, as shown\nin Figure 2.39 and this results in the strut encountering higher wave drag at the higher Mach\nnumbers. This higher drag ultimately results in a higher fuel burn over the Pt.3 mission.\n\n53\n\nFigure 2.39 \xe2\x80\x93 Geometric constraint of the strut due to the fixed attachment to the landing gear pod\n\nDesign Optimization with Respect to Direct Operating Cost\nCost estimating capability was achieved through the addition of the program Aircraft Life Cycle\nCost Analysis, or ALCCA (9). This program, originally written by NASA and modified within the\nASDL, performs bottom up cost estimation of aircraft, both for manufacturers and airlines. Within\nthis project, the primary metric of interest was the airline\'s direct operating cost (DOC), as it\nserved a useful parameter for optimization.\nIn order to determine the direct operating cost for a given vehicle, ALCCA calculated numerous\ncost components and summed them together. This can be decomposed into the cash DOC and\nthe ownership costs. The Cash DOC reflects operating costs associated with each flight, and\ninclude the fuel, crew salary, and maintenance costs. The other major component of the DOC is\nthe ownership cost, which includes costs not related to usage but to ownership of the vehicle\nitself. This includes depreciation, hull insurance, and financing. The overall DOC is calculated by\nfinding each of these cost components.\nWithin the cash DOC the cost of maintenance depends largely on the cost per hour for\nmaintenance and the amount of time spend on maintenance. This comes from inputs given by\nthe user that define values such as the hourly rate paid to maintenance personnel, and the\nexpected amount of maintenance, such as mean time between failures and mean time to repair.\nSimilar to maintenance costs, flight crew costs depend largely on inputs such salaries and the\namount of time they work. Like maintenance, these values were based on defaults programmed\ninto ALCCA, as they could be expected to be similar to typical values for current aircraft.\nThe cost of fuel was based on the quantity of fuel consumed, and the cost per gallon of fuel. The\ncost per gallon of fuel is a straightforward value that is simply input by the user, and can be based\non the current cost of aircraft fuel. The other required value for this estimate, the fuel consumed,\nwas not an input, and instead was based on the block fuel value, as calculated by the MDO based\non the vehicle and specified mission profile.\n\n54\n\nThe other major component of the DOC, ownership cost, was the sum of financing, depreciation,\nand insurance, all of which depended predominantly on the value of the vehicle itself. This value\nwas determined using ALCCA\'s estimate of the vehicle\'s manufacturing cost. Consequently, this\nwas one of the most difficult aspects of the cost estimate. ALCCA\'s manufacturing cost estimation\nis based on regressions from historical data, and uses the weights of various components of the\naircraft, such as wings, fuselage, vertical tail, horizontal tail, and engines. It also requires a\nbreakdown of materials used in these components, as well as values that characterize the\nlearning curve (which governs the rate at which the production cost goes down as successive\nunits are produced). ALCCA\'s estimate also reflects the total number of units manufactured, since\ninvestment costs are ameliorated across all vehicles produced. The profile of production rate is\nalso considered. To provide the information required for ALCCA to make its estimates, data came\nfrom three places. For values that were already determined by the MDO, these were used as\ninputs. Where possible, values not given by the MDO were estimated based on records for\ncomparable vehicles. In the case of inputs for which no information was available, ALCCA\'s\ndefault estimates were used.\nExamples of ALCCA inputs for which the MDO provided information include the weight\nbreakdown of the vehicle. As the weights of the various components of the aircraft have a strong\ninfluence on the manufacturing cost estimated by ALCCA, the fact that these values were based\non the results of the MDO increased confidence in ALCCA\'s manufacturing cost estimate. In the\ncase of the material breakdown of each major vehicle component, values from the Boeing 737800 were used. Values from the Boeing 737-800 were also used for estimates related to the\nmanufacturing program, such as the number of years of development preceding the production\nof the first unit, cost of the engines, the rate of return of the manufacturer, and the learning\ncurves. All other manufacturing variables were defaulted to ALCCA\'s built in values. This included\nthe number of units produced, and the profile of production rate on a month by month basis.\nOf the various cost components of the DOC, fuel costs and depreciation were the highest,\nfollowed by flight crew. This was followed by the cost of maintenance, which represented a much\nsmaller part of the overall DOC. Because of this, the DOC was most sensitive to factors affecting\nfuel burn and manufacturing cost. Because the fuel cost is based on block fuel and the cost per\ngallon of that fuel, the DOC was very sensitive to the cost of fuel. This matches prevailing\nexpectations about the DOC, and supports the underlying premise of this project, namely that\nfocusing on fuel efficiency can positively affect the overall cost of operating the vehicle. The other\nmajor component of the DOC was the depreciation cost. This was close enough to fuel costs that\ndepending on the price per gallon of fuel and on the cruise speed given, depreciation could be\nlarger or smaller that the fuel cost. Because depreciation was based on the manufacturer\'s price,\nthe overall DOC was sensitive to everything that influenced the manufacturer\'s price. While the\ncost of designing and manufacturing an aircraft is typically hard to predict and features a great\n\n55\n\ndeal of uncertainty, ALCCA represents one of the best available options for predicting these\nvalues. Whatever uncertainty may be associated with the depreciation cost of the vehicle, it is\ndoubtful that it could be known with much greater confidence within the scope of this project.\nThe weight components in particular increase confidence in the value determined by ALCCA for\ndepreciation costs, as these were taken directly from the MDO rather than from some\ncomparable vehicle. The cost of the flight crew can also be considered to be reliable due to the\nsimplicity of the equations with which it is found. This can also be said of the maintenance costs,\nwhich at any rate has much less influence on the DOC, due to its small size.\nAfter optimizing based on minimization of the block fuel for the five different cruise Mach\nnumbers of 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, and 0.8, the process was repeated for all five Mach numbers using\ndirect operating cost as the metric of interest. For each of the two sets of five optimum designs,\nfuel consumption, empty weight, and aircraft price all showed trends of increasing with\nincreasing Mach number as shown in Figure 2.40, Figure 2.41, and Figure 2.42, respectively. This\nmakes sense, as it reflects the fact that at higher Mach numbers more fuel is required, as well as\nlarger wings to support the increased take-off gross weight. This is reflected in the acquisition\nprice of the vehicle, which is strongly influenced by the weight of the vehicle.\nThe two approaches converged on similar designs, but in no cases did they converge on a single\ndesign that was considered the best by both metrics. With respect to fuel burn, the designs found\nby minimizing fuel burn featured lower block fuel than those optimized with respect to DOC. The\nreverse was true when looking at the DOC of the optimum vehicles that were found; for each\nMach number the designs found by minimizing DOC had lower values for DOC than those found\nby minimizing for fuel burn. It is also of note that the plots showed a kink in the trend for Mach\n= 0.75. This merits further investigation to identify the cause of this anomaly.\n6300\n6200\n\nFuel optimized\n\nBlock Fuel (lbs)\n\n6100\n\nDOC optimized\n\n6000\n5900\n5800\n5700\n5600\n5500\n5400\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\nCruise Mach\nFigure 2.40 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of block fuel between the fuel burn optimum and the DOC optimum\n\n56\n\n81000\n\nFuel optimized\n\nEmpty Weight (lbs)\n\n80000\n\nDOC optimized\n\n79000\n78000\n77000\n76000\n75000\n74000\n73000\n72000\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\nCruise Mach\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\nFigure 2.41 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of empty weight between the fuel burn optimum and the DOC optimum\n\n59\n\nFuel optimized\n\nA/C Price (M$)\n\n58.5\n\nDOC optimized\n\n58\n57.5\n57\n56.5\n56\n55.5\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\nFigure 2.42 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of aircraft price between the fuel burn optimum and the DOC optimum\n\nThe percent difference for each design variable was compared for each of the two designs found\nat each Mach number in Figure 2.33. This does not reveal any clear trends, suggesting that\ndespite the similarity in output parameters between the two sets of optimums, the designs\nachieve their optimums in different ways. This suggests that within the design space exist many\nsimilarly desirable local optima. This corresponds to what has been found throughout this\ninvestigation, where the existence of many local variables with similar optimality has been\ndetected consistently. Perhaps the only trend seen when looking at the percent difference\nbetween the two sets of designs at each Mach number is that the variation between the design\nvariables decreases as Mach number increases. One interpretation of this is that as the\nrequirements become more demanding at higher Mach numbers, the feasible design space\nshrinks down and allows a smaller range for each of the design variables that can be used.\n\n57\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nWing.Sw_input\nWing.TR_inbd_input\nWing.TR_outbd_input\nWing.AR_input\nWing.TOC_r_input\nWing.TOC_b_input\nWing.TOC_t_input\nWing.Lambda_inbd_input\nWing.eta_input\nStrut.TOC_r_strut_input\nStrut.TOC_j1_strut_input\nStrut.TOC_b_strut_input\nStrut.CR_r_strut_input\nStrut.CR_j1_strut_input\nStrut.CR_b_strut_input\nJury.CR_jury_1_input\nJury.TOC_jury_1_input\nJury.eta_jury_1_strut_in\nJury.eta_jury_1_wing_inp\nM = 0.6\n\nM = 0.65\n\nM = 0.7\n\nM = 0.75\n\nM = 0.8\n\nFigure 2.43 \xe2\x80\x93 Changes of design variables between the fuel burn optimum and the DOC optimum\n\nVarious metrics related to operating costs were considered under two scenarios, one in which\nthe cost of jet fuel is $3.40, and the other in which the cost of jet fuel was $5.18. These fuel cost\nassumptions were obtained from a forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\n(10), in which EIA projected jet fuel cost to 2035 with three different scenarios \xe2\x80\x93 "low oil price",\n"reference", and "high oil price". The lower and higher jet fuel costs respectively represent EIA\'s\nprojection for year 2035 under "reference" and "high oil price" scenarios.

The\nDOC breakdown shows that fuel and depreciation are the largest components, followed by crew\ncosts, followed by all remaining cost components combined as shown in Figure 2.46.\nThe cost of all fuel used increases with increasing Mach number, since more fuel is used at higher\ncruise Mach numbers. Conversely, ownership costs and crew costs go down with increasing\ncruise Mach number since crews are paid for fewer hours per flight, and ownership costs are\nspread out over a greater number of flights. The relationship between the productivity and cruise\nspeed is shown in Figure 2.47. The changes in fuel costs and crew costs largely cancel each other\nout, which yielded a relatively constant cash DOC trend across different Mach numbers. When\nall cost components are considered in the plot of the total DOC, the trend associated with\nownership costs factors in, and the total DOC goes down with increasing Mach number. This\ndecreasing trend for Total DOC was somewhat surprising, as it was not expected to be monotonic\nbut rather bucket shaped. This would reflect an optimum Mach number, where the influences of\nthe increasing costs from fuel and decreasing costs from crew and ownership would be\nminimized. This still appears to be the case, but the Mach number at which the total DOC is\nminimized is greater than Mach 0.8 under the assumptions currently used in this investigation.\n\n59\n\nFuel cost: $5.18/ gallon\n\nFuel cost: $3.40/ gallon\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\xc2\xa2/ASM)\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n\xc2\xa2/ASM)\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n\nHullInsure\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\nCruise Mach\n\nCruise Mach\nDepreciation\n\nEngine\n\nBurden\n\n10\n0\nAirframe\n\nFigure 2.46 \xe2\x80\x93 Breakdown of total DOC\n\n06\n\nFlightCrew\n\nFuel\n\nFigure 2.47 \xe2\x80\x93 Productivity vs. cruise speed (Number of Trips per Year; Utilization = 2,835 hrs; Mission Range = 900 nm)\n\nIt is also significant that as fuel costs go up, this increases the importance of fuel economy. The\nincrease in fuel costs causes the fuel component to represent a greater share in the total DOC.\nThus, a given percent reduction here may have a large impact on the overall DOC of the vehicle.\n2.1.4.4\nMulti-Disciplinary Optimization Data Used for Post Analysis\nLoads and aerodynamic data developed by the MDO provided design targets for Boeing discipline\nexperts during the development of 765-095 Revisions B and C.\n\n60\n\nLoads Data\nThe MDO environment included 17 different loads cases in the structural analysis.

The input nodal loads\nfor the wing are illustrated in Figure 2.48. It should be noted that the nodal loading of the\nstructure between the jury strut and primary wing strut are reduced due to reduced node\nspacing. The load at centerline is half the total node load because of model symmetry.\nThe external loads are used to calculate the truss member internal loads. Figure 2.49 shows the\nwing shear and Figure 2.50 shows the wing bending moment for all the load cases analyzed. The\nbending moment data for all load cases was used to determine design bending moment curves\nwhich are shown in Figure 2.51. A portion of the inboard wing is sized by global buckling due to\nthe high compressive force imparted on the wing by the wing strut. This compressive force is\nillustrated in Figure 2.52 and the corresponding wing strut load in Figure 2.53.\n\n61\n\nThousands\n\n15.0\n\n10.0\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n\n5.0\n\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n\nNode Vertical Load (lb)\n\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n\n80\n\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n\n-5.0\n\nReduced Nodal\nSpacing Reduces\nNode Forces\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\nWing Fold\n\nStrut\n\nEngine\n\nJury Strut\n\n-15.0\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\n1/2 Load on Symmetry Plane\n\n-10.0\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n\nSpan (ft)\n\nMillions\n\nFigure 2.48 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Loads (External to Truss System)\n0.12\n\n0.09\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n0.06\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.03\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\n-0.06\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\nStrut\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nWing Fold\n\n-0.12\n\nJury Strut\n\n-0.09\n\nEngine\n\nVertical Shear (lb)\n\n0.03\n\nFigure 2.49 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Shear\n\n62\n\nWing Fold\n\nStrut\n\nJury Strut\n\nMillions\n\n1.75\n\n1.50\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n\n1.25\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n\nBending Moment (ft-lb)\n\n1.00\n\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n\n0.75\n\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n\nRegion Sized by\nGlobal Buckling\nLoad Case:\n0 ft, M 0.4, Empty, Gust\n\n0.50\n\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n\n0.25\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.50\n\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nWing Fold\n\n1.75\n\nStrut\n\nJury Strut\n\nMillions\n\nFigure 2.50 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Moment\n\n1.50\n\n1.25\n\nBending Moment (ft-lb)\n\n1.00\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n0.75\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n\nRegion Sized by\nGlobal Buckling\nLoad Case:\n0 ft, M 0.4, Empty, Gust\n\n0.50\n\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n\n0.25\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.50\n\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nFigure 2.51 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Design Moment\n\n63\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n0.20\n\nTension\n\nMillions\n\n0.30\n\n0.10\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n\n0.00\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nCompression\n\n0.0\n-0.10\nAxial Load (lb)\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n\n-0.20\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.30\n\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.40\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.50\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\n-0.60\n\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nWing Fold\n\nJury Strut\n\nEngine\n\n-0.80\n\nStrut\n\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n-0.70\n\nMillions\n\nFigure 2.52 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Axial Load\n0.80\n\n0.60\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n\n0.40\n\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n\nTension\n\n0.20\n\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\n-0.20\n\n-0.40\n\nCompression\n\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\nJury Strut\n\nAxial Load (lb)\n\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nFigure 2.53 \xe2\x80\x93 Strut Axial Load\n\n64\n\nThe loads are then used to size the structure.

The wing tip deflection predicted by the MDO is significant when compared to\nconventional configurations. This is especially true if the deflection is measured from the strut\njunction. This is largely due to the rotation that is allowed at the strut junction (a ball or pin joint\nconnection). If the rotation at the strut junction is accounted for, the wing deflection (though\nhigher than typical) is reasonable. The deflections of the entire truss are plotted to scale for\nbetter perspective.\n12.0\n\n10.0\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n\n6.73\'\n\n8.0\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n\n6.0\n\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n0 ft M 0.4, TOGW Slope @ Strut\n\n4.0\n\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n\n2.0\n\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n0.0\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n40K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\n-2.0\n\nSpan (ft)\n\nWing Fold\n\nStrut\n\nJury Strut\n\n-4.0\n\n40K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\nEngine\n\nNode Vertical Deflection (ft)\n\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n\nFigure 2.56 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Node Deflection\n\n66\n\nNode Vertical Location (ft)\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\nNode Lateral Location (ft)\nUndeflected\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, MZFW\n0 ft, M 0.4, TOGW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, TOGW, Gust\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, TOGW\n2g, Taxi Bump, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.4, MZFW, Gust\n20K ft, M 0.6, MZFW, Gust\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, 2.5g, MZFW\n0 ft, M 0.2, TOGW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, TOGW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, TOGW, Gust\n\n36K ft, M 0.7, -1.0g, TOGW\n0 ft, M 0.2, MZFW, Gust\n10K ft, M 0.5, MZFW, Gust\n30K ft, M 0.7, MZFW, Gust\n\nFigure 2.57 \xe2\x80\x93 Truss Node Deflection\n\nAerodynamic Data\nTwo pieces of aerodynamic data from the MDO environment will be used as design goals for\nfuture tasks. The wing lift distribution (Figure 2.58) and the drag divergence Mach number (Figure\n2.59) will be used as targets for the high speed wing design. The lift distribution is used to trade\ninduced drag (which tends toward an elliptic distribution) and wing structural weight (which\ntends toward a triangular distribution). The wing lift distribution that resulted from the MDO is\nshown in blue and is compared to an elliptic distribution in purple. The distribution is slightly\ntriangular and falls within expectation. Also included is a coefficient of normal force (illustrated\nin red) which is approximately equal to sectional lift coefficient. The sectional lift coefficient is\nsurprisingly flat and lends credence to a 2D starting point for design.\nAdditional surprises stem from the drag divergence plot. Several definitions of drag divergence\nexist, but no matter which is used, the results of the MDO clearly indicate the optimum speed to\nfly for fuel efficiency is well below divergence. One typical definition for drag divergence is when\nthe slope of the drag due to Mach number vs. Mach number curve reaches 0.05. The MDO results\nin a configuration that cruises at a slope of 0.021, less than half the slope of a conventional\nconfiguration. These results are mirrored by internal Boeing analysis. For this study, a design\ntarget slope of 0.021 will be used to bound wing thickness.\n\n67\n\nChord * Cn / Chordavg\n\n1.0\n\nElliptical Distribution\n\nCn\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nChord Cn / Chordavg; Cn\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nWing Fold\n\nJury Strut\n\nEngine\n\n0.1\n\nStrut\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n0.73\n\n0.74\n\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\nFigure 2.58 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Lift Distribution\n0.0020\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0003\n\nCDc\n\n0.0015\n\n0.0000\n0.64\n\n0.65\n\n0.66\n\n0.67\n\n0.68\n\n0.69\nMach Number\n\n0.7\n\nFigure 2.59 \xe2\x80\x93 Aircraft Drag Divergence\n\n68\n\n0.71\n\n0.72\n\nThe university MDO predicted an optimum lift coefficient of 0.616. Based on the load data\nsummarized earlier in this section, the wing weight was predicted to be higher than the weight\npredicted by the MDO environment. If the wing weight is a more significant fraction of OEW the\noptimum configuration will tend to fly at a higher lift coefficient than predicted by the\noptimization. It was estimated that the TOGW of the airplane will increase from 136,000 pounds\npredicted by the MDO to approximately 150,000 pounds. This increase will be accounted for by\nchanging the design cruise lift coefficient to 0.7, a percentage change roughly equal to the change\nin gross weights.\n2.1.5\n\nOther Phase II Configuration Changes\n\n2.1.5.1\nEngine Integration\nThe baseline engine integration for 765-095-RA is illustrated in Figure 2.60. The installation is a\nconventional nacelle-pylon arrangement with placement constrained by the exhaust plume and\nwing strut interaction. Alternative arrangements are possible though do not appear attractive.\n\nFigure 2.60 \xe2\x80\x93 Baseline Engine Integration\n\nTypically, engines are located in front of the wing because this offers the best integrated solution\nbetween weight and interference drag. While there may be benefits in wetted area and pylon\ninterference drag to moving the engine aft and closer to the wing, it is not clear that there would\nbe a vehicle-level improvement (heritage experience points to the opposite). Moving the engine\naft and closer to the wing would increase interference drag from the nacelle. Additionally, some\nengine placement options would interrupt the load paths, which would unnecessarily increase\nweight. Loading the engines fan case may reduce SFC and increase engine wear. To prevent this,\n\n69\n\nload must be ring-framed around the fan case and the engine attachments must be designed for\nstiffness rather than stress, as was done on the DC-10/MD-11 aircraft centerline engine.\nExperience has shown that it is best to avoid the situation if possible.\nAnother consideration is thrust reversing. Many of the integration alternatives would preclude\nthe use of a cascade style reverser and would have to use heavier alternatives. Turbine and fan\ndisk failures are also a concern, as primary structure would be impacted by disk debris.\nEngine maintenance makes up a significant portion of direct operating cost. Airframe integration\ndecisions that reduce serviceability, thus increasing maintenance costs, are highly undesirable.\nThis becomes a greater concern if fuel burn decreases, as the percentage of engine maintenance\non direct operating cost would increase.\nFigure 2.61 shows the result of a brainstorming activity on engine and strut integration. None of\nthe options considered appeared to have any advantage over the baseline installation though\nnone were traded analytically. While there may be some benefits to some of the alternative\nengine integration concepts, the potential negative aspects make it hard to justify many of the\noptions.\n\n70\n\nFigure 2.61 \xe2\x80\x93 Alternative Engine Integration Concepts\n\n2.1.5.2\nNose Refinement\nThe nose shape of an aircraft is influenced by many factors such as aerodynamics, pilot vision,\nstructures, internal arrangement, manufacturing, and visual appeal. The nose of 765-095 (Figure\n2.62-A) was 350 inches long yielding a fineness ratio of 2.22. This fineness ratio should\naccommodate a divergence Mach number of about 0.87, significantly higher than what is\nrequired for a 0.70 cruise speed. The reduced nose length is traded equally for constant section\n\n71\n\nyielding no net fuselage length change. The constant section is easier and less expensive to\nmanufacture. The nose length for 765-095-RA (Figure 2.62-B) is 250 inches and its fineness ratio\nis 1.59 which is still sufficient for a 0.82 cruise Mach number. The nose length was not reduced\nfurther due to interior arrangement and flight deck integration reasons. The nose camber was\nalso reduced.\nA)\n\n350\xe2\x80\x9d\nL/D = 2.22\nB)\n\n250\xe2\x80\x9d\nL/D = 1.59\nFigure 2.62 \xe2\x80\x93 A) 765-095 Nose Profile View; B) 765-095-RA Nose Profile View\n\nTo verify the fuselage aerodynamic performance in cruise, the fuselage OML was analyzed with\nthe CFD++ N-S solver on a 3.5 million hybrid cell grid, using the K-Epsilon turbulence model. Figure\n2.63 shows a centerline cut of local Mach number and surface pressure contours for the solution,\nand shows nothing adverse for the Mach 0.7, Angle of Attack 1.5\xc2\xb0, 42,000 ft altitude condition.\n\n72\n\nFigure 2.63 \xe2\x80\x93 Forward Fuselage Mach Number and Pressure Contours\n\n2.1.5.3\nLanding Gear Integration\nThe landing gear configuration from SUGAR Phase I (765-095), illustrated in Figure 2.64, is a body\nmounted installation similar to the BAE-146 which uses a collapsible link that reduces its folded\nlength. This provides clearance for the airplane keel beam while minimizing the gear trunnion\xe2\x80\x99s\ndistance from the fuselage. The gear is a trailing arm geometry which typically would be heavier\nthan conventional arrangements but provides vehicle level advantages for some configurations\nbecause the oleo geometry and kinematics are independent from the strut geometry enabling\nfeatures such as the collapsible link previously mentioned. Other advantages may include more\nbenign loads transmitted to the rigid structure and more tolerance for poorly surfaced airfields.\nThis integration was chosen based on experience with internal studies which focused on high\nwing transports and was not fully refined for the Phase I configuration as attention was diverted\nto understanding the species as a whole rather than detailed component integration.\n\n73\n\nSTRUT / CENTERLINE INTERSECTION\n\nCOLLAPSIBLE LINK\n\nFigure 2.64 \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I Gear Installation (765-095)\n\nThe global understanding of truss braced wings obtained in Phase I provided many possible\nintegration strategies that should be studied. For landing gear, in an effort to combine highly\nloaded structural members to increase structural efficiency, an untraded decision was made to\nintegrate the strut carry thru with the landing gear. This integration scheme will restrict the\nlocation of the strut to fuselage junction to occur at the same location as the landing gear. The\ngear location falls out from the vehicle configuration and airplane CG limits, thus the fuselage\nstrut integration location is fixed. This decision was not traded for this study and based on the\nFEM results, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to impact the TBW system adversely for this Mach number. If higher\nspeeds are studied, this integration decision should be traded.\nIn addition to shared heavy structure, it is perceived that the configuration would benefit from a\nstrut integration as low on the fuselage as possible. The original gear arrangement\xe2\x80\x99s trunnion\n(the structural element aligned with the gear rotation axis which carries substantial gear loads to\nits attachment) integrates high on the fuselage near the passenger floor. Lowering the trunnion\nlocation would benefit the aircraft by allowing a shorter landing gear strut and an increased\nmechanical advantage for the wing strut thus decreasing its load or increasing the optimum\nstrutted span.\nThe evolution of the landing gear arrangement through three cycles constrained by the thinking\ndescribed in the previous paragraphs is illustrated in Figure 2.65 A thru D. Figure 2.65-A shows\nthe Phase I installation. Figure 2.65-B shows a simple strut (non-trailing arm) landing gear\n\n74\n\ninstalled at a very low point on the fuselage facilitating the need for a stub pylon for gear\nattachment. This arrangement significantly shortened the landing gear strut and lowered the\nwing strut attachment location but left two constraints that could not be satisfied. The landing\ngear strut length was not sufficient for the integration of the oleo (shock absorber) and the\nlanding gear couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be installed at a location that would provide adequate main gear ground\ntrack. These constraints could be met by lengthening the gear strut and moving the attachment\nfurther from the fuselage thus growing the size of the pylon.\nRather than grow the strut length, the oleo was decoupled from the gear strut allowing it to lean\ntoward the fuselage. This cant angle enables the gear to meet the minimum gear track required\nfor this size aircraft without growing the length of the strut (Illustrated in Figure 2.65-C). The gear\narrangement was integrated with additional rigor and slowly evolved into Figure 2.65-D which\ntakes into account the structure, kinematics and gear stowage. This evolution solves the landing\ngear integration within scope of the study. No detailed trades were performed during the\nevolution and if further vehicle refinement were to be performed it is suggested that integrations\nB thru D (and possibly additional to landing gear integration concepts) be explored at a higher\nfidelity. An unexplored possibility is that the evolution from C to D changed the geometry\nsignificantly enough that a simple strut could be optimum.\nA)\n\nB)\n\nC)\n\nD)\n\nFigure 2.65 \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear Installation Progression\n\nAs previously mentioned, the goal of the landing gear and wing strut integration is to maximize\nthe mechanical advantage the wing strut has at carrying wing loads. The evolution of the gear,\nassuming a consistent strut angle, would provide an additional 47.5 inches of additional strutted\nwing span and efficiently reuses highly loaded structure. This integration scheme does assume\nthat reducing wing bending moment at the strut junction in favor of increasing gear pylon loads\nis a net benefit to the airplane. Figure 2.66 shows the final gear configuration in both front and\nside view. It also shows graphically the increase in strutted span (labeled \xe2\x80\x9cHorizontal Offset\xe2\x80\x9d that\nwas achieved by the installation.\n\n75\n\nVERTICAL\nOFFSET\n\nHORIZONTAL\nOFFSET\n\nFigure 2.66 \xe2\x80\x93 Final Installation (765-095-RA)\n\nThe structural arrangement of the gear pylon contributes significantly to the gear arrangement\nselected for this study. From an external view, the pylon looks similar to a wing. This may lead to\nan expectation that the structure would work in a similar fashion; this is not the case. Unlike a\nwing, the gear pylon cannot have a lower cover panel because the gear is required to retract\nthrough the lower surface of the pylon. Figure 2.67 shows the pylon structural arrangement with\neach primary component labeled. There is an upper cover panel, but it cannot be extended to\nthe centerline because the retracted gear protrudes above where the upper skin would be. The\npylon structure has a forward and aft member that act as fuselage frame, pressure panel, and\npylon spar. The aft member breaks forward in plan view which necessitates a longitudinal\nstabilization element. It also has a pylon upper skin that extends from outboard of the landing\ngear to the fuselage side of body. Finally, a closure panel on the tip of the pylon resists the\nforward and aft members from pulling apart. The following sections will illustrate the loads\nintroduced by the wing strut and landing gear and show how those loads are intended to be\nhandled by the pylon structure. These figures are based on design intent and do not reflect the\nactual load paths that the sized structure will produce.\n\n76\n\nFuselage Skin\n(Removed)\n\nPassenger\nFloor\n\nReinforced Longeron\n\nCargo Floor\n\nReinforced\nLongeron\n\nAft Spar / Pressure Bulkhead\n\nCargo\nFloor\nUpper\nCover\nPanel\n\nWing Strut\n\nKeel Beam\n\nGear Trunnion\n\nForward Spar /\nPressure Bulkhead\n\nStrut Attachment\n\nPylon Cap\nTires\n\nGear Sway Brace\n\nGear Strut\n\nOleo\n\nTrailing Arm\n\nFigure 2.67 \xe2\x80\x93 Gear Structural Arrangement\n\nLanding gear loads can be broken into three\ndirections, Longitudinal, Lateral, and Vertical,\neach of which is handled differently by the\nstructure. Figure 2.68 shows the intended load\npath for the landing gear vertical load. The load\nis distributed to the forward and aft spars of the\ngear pylon by the landing gear assembly\n(illustrated in blue). The majority of the landing\ngear load is transmitted to the rear spar due to\nthe position of the tire relative to the trunnion\nattachment. The rear spar caps handle the\nvertical load imparted by the rear attachment of\nthe trunnion, however the rear spar is canted\nforward (in plan view) and turns to align with\nthe fuselage frames at the pylon side of body.\nThis creates kick loads for both the upper and\nFigure 2.68 \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear Load Paths: Vertical Load\nlower caps which are handled by the fuselage\nskin and longerons and a longitudinal shear\nmember (illustrated in green) respectively. In the forward spar, the load is intended to run along\nthe spar caps to centerline. The load in the upper cap is turned laterally toward the centerline at\n\n77\n\nthe side of body attachment which creates a kick load handled by the fuselage skin. The lower\ncap is turned gradually and will require stabilization members that extend upward to the fuselage\nframe. The current length of the trunnion is arbitrary and could be lengthened to balance the\nfront and aft spar loads and reduce the kick loads in the aft spar through decreased turning angle.\nLongitudinal loads (Figure 2.69) imparted on the landing gear are transmitted to the pylon with\na torsional load that is a function of the primary loads offset from the trunnion attachment. The\ntorsional load is handled by the same structure and in the same manner as the vertical load. The\nlongitudinal load is reacted by the pylon upper panel (illustrated in purple) which transmits the\nload into the fuselage skin and longeron (not shown) via shear. This panel also stiffens the pylon\nin bending (vertical loads) and torsion (gear drag loads). A panel at the end of the pylon (shown\nin yellow) prevents the forward and aft spars from spreading apart when under load.\n\nFigure 2.69 \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear Load Paths: Longitudinal Load\n\n78\n\nThe load paths for lateral loads imparted on the\ngear are rather simple (depicted in Figure 2.70)\nand rely on the gear sway brace (brown) which\ntransmits loads directly into the forward\npressure bulkhead / pylon front spar (blue).\nAs previously mentioned, these illustrations\nrepresent the design intent only. The load will\nfollow the path of highest stiffness which would\nbe determined during a higher fidelity design\nprocess. This is a starting point layout that will\nbe analyzed for the Phase II effort; no iteration\nis planned.\nAn empirical method (sensitive only to\npassenger cabin length) was used to estimate\nthe longitudinal location of the landing gear.\nFigure 2.70 \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear Load Paths: Lateral Load\nThe landing gear location will be refined as\nmore is learned about the center of gravity\nlimits of the aircraft. As the landing gear shifts the aft fuselage loft will be revised to maintain\nproper tail strike clearance.\n2.1.5.4\nAft Fuselage\nThe aft fuselage closes out the constant section with minimum drag. It must accommodate\nattachments for the empennage and provide adequate ground rotation for takeoff. The 765-095\nconfiguration has higher span and lower sweep than conventional configurations which results\nin a higher lift curve slope. For a given wing area and gross weight, lower ground rotation angles\nare required to make the same lift as conventional airplanes. The tail strike angle for the 765-095\nwas reduced from ~12.5\xc2\xb0 to ~10.5\xc2\xb0 to account for this and the aft fuselage was re-lofted to reduce\nupsweep drag. The ground rotation limit change was calculated by the ratio of lift curve slopes\nfor the 765-094 and 765-095 configurations from Phase I. The change in ground rotation limit\nand its cascading effect on the shape of the aft fuselage is illustrated in Figure 2.71.\n\n79\n\nA)\n\n12.5\xc2\xb0\n\nB)\n\n10.5\xc2\xb0\nFigure 2.71 \xe2\x80\x93 Aft Fuselage Changes A) 765-095, B) 765-095-RC\n\nTo verify the fuselage aerodynamic performance in cruise, the fuselage OML was analyzed with\nthe CFD++ N-S solver on a 3.5 million hybrid cell grid, using the K-Epsilon turbulence model.

The vertical\ntail sweep was changed to increase the tail arm of the horizontal stabilizer. The horizontal\nstabilizer is attached to the rear spar of the vertical tail by a pin hinge at its rear spar. The\nhorizontal forward spar is attached to a jack screw which, in turn, is attached to a diagonal\nstructural element in the vertical tail. This accommodates movement of the entire horizontal\nstabilizer for trim. The vertical tail is assumed to have a single hinged rudder and both horizontal\nand vertical are assumed to have two spanwise segments for redundancy in the flight controls.\nThe bullet faring shown in the initial release was replaced with a wiping surface configuration.\nThree degrees of anhedral is included on the horizontal tail to alleviate flutter loads which\ntypically size portions of the vertical tail structure. The revised empennage is shown in Figure\n2.73-B.\n\n81\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\nFigure 2.73 \xe2\x80\x93 Horizontal and Vertical Tail\n\n2.1.6\nHigh Speed Wing Design\nAt the beginning of the MDO exercise documented in Section 2.1.4.3, planform data was allowed\nto optimize using all variables applicable (shown in Table 2.6) resulting in configuration\nC210b2.17. This planform was changed as appropriate for integration and based on discipline\nexpert review. The inboard sweep of the wing was set to align the front and rear spars with the\nmost appropriate structure while maintaining the wing MAC at a fixed location (an empirical\npercentage of the passenger cabin length). The inboard taper ratio was adjusted to prevent\nexcessive washout followed by wash in which would result from a constant chord inboard wing.\nThe outboard wing sweep was traded in the MDO environment and the results showed the\nimpact on fuel burn to be negligible. This allowed the outboard wing sweep to be adjusted to\nprovide a linear rear spar at a constant percentage of chord. The rear spar and front spar are\nassumed to break at the side of body joint for this study. The resulting planform is depicted in\nFigure 2.74. It should be noted that it is assumed the strut will integrate at the planform break.\n0.0000\n0.0000\n\nSOB\n50.0000\n\n126.4780\n444.5722\n\n123.6460\n587.9305\n\n253.5161\n1019.6505\n\n130.3127\n0.0000\n238.0022\n587.9305\n\n298.6507\n1019.6505\nFigure 2.74 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Reference Planform\n\n82\n\nIn order to maintain the best possible performance after wing integration all applicable variables\nshown in Table 2.6 were re-optimized with exception to those shown in Table 2.10 which were\ndriven by the wing integration, span sensitivity, and previous optimizations. The wing integration\nimpact on fuel burn was minimal as previously shown in Figure 2.35.

The following data were used as design constraints:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAirplane Drag Rise Slope at 0.7 Mach: 0.021 (rounded to 0.025)\nWing Planform\nWing Spanwise Loading\n\nBoeing used Flo22 to analyze the resulting wing planform and set the wing thickness distribution\nand twist while accounting for body effects. It should be noted that the drag rise Mach number\nprediction in the method is more reliable than the level of compressibility drag it computes\n(based on flight tests and wind tunnel data). For this reason, the drag axis is intentionally omitted\nfrom the charts that use this method, Overflow analysis, discussed in Section 2.1.6.2, will be used\nfor drag computation and comparison. Flo22 is computationally less expensive allowing for much\niteration prior to the use of higher fidelity methods.\nIn order to understand what levels of compressibility could be attained, a first pass analysis was\ncompleted using a constant 10.6% thickness-to-chord ratio and the L1 airfoil documented in\nSection 2.1.4.2. The wing was twisted to provide an elliptic distribution, a convenient distribution\nfor wing design comparisons. As illustrated in Figure 2.75, the constant thickness-to-chord wing\nprovided drag divergence margin of approximately 0.02 Mach at the targeted 0.025 divergence\ncriteria.\n\n84\n\ntc1060\n0.50 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.63 0.64 0.65 0.66 0.67 0.68 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 2.75 \xe2\x80\x93 Constant 10.6% t/c Drag Rise\n\nBecause the drag divergence requirement was exceeded, three different wing thickness\ndistributions were generated. Discussions with Mass Properties, Structures, and Aerodynamic\ndesigners resulted in a strategy of holding wing thickness constant from the wing root to the strut\nattachment, holding maximum thickness-to-chord ratio constant between the strut attachment\nand the wing fold, and providing conventional wing thickness-to-chord distributions outboard.\nThe tip thickness-to-chord ratio was held 1.4% lower than the max based on historical wing\ndesigns. The three wing thickness distributions generated with this strategy (tmod1 thru tmod3)\nstart with a maximum thickness of 12% and increase by 0.5% each intending to bracket the drag\ndivergence criteria. Table 2.13 and Figure 2.76 show each of these three wing thickness\ndistributions as well as the University and constant 10.6% distributions.\nTable 2.13 \xe2\x80\x93 Thickness Distributions of Various SUGAR Wing Options\n\neta\n0.05\n0.15\n0.3\n0.45\n0.58*\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n\nUniv\n0.08229\n0.08666\n0.09333\n0.09999\n0.10562\n0.10242\n0.09983\n0.09724\n0.09464\n\ntc1060\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n0.10600\n\ntmod1\n0.10674\n0.10877\n0.11247\n0.11643\n0.12000\n0.12000\n0.11729\n0.11314\n0.10600\n\n85\n\ntmod2\n0.11091\n0.11330\n0.11716\n0.12128\n0.12500\n0.12500\n0.12229\n0.11814\n0.11100\n\ntmod3\n0.11535\n0.11784\n0.12185\n0.12614\n0.13000\n0.13000\n0.12729\n0.12314\n0.11600\n\n0.14\n\n0.13\n\nThickness to Chord\n\n0.12\n\n0.11\n\n0.1\n\n0.09\n\n0.08\nUniv\n0.07\n0.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\ntc1060 (10.6%)\n0.30\n\ntmod1 (12.0%)\n0.40\n\n0.50\nSpan (\xce\xb7)\n\ntmod2 (12.5%)\n0.60\n\n0.70\n\ntmod3 (13.0%)\n0.80\n\n0.90\n\n1.00\n\nFigure 2.76 \xe2\x80\x93 Thickness-to-Chord of Various Airfoils\n\nDrag divergence curves were computed for wing thicknesses tmod1 thru tmod3. These results,\ncompared in Figure 2.77, indeed bracket the required cruise Mach Number with a drag\ndivergence slope of 0.25 with both tmod1 and tmod2 meeting the criteria. It is expected that\nthere will be small drag divergence knockdowns encountered for washout (to attain a more\nstructurally favorable lift distribution) and trim. Table 2.14 shows characteristics including\naverage exposed thickness-to-chord ratio, design lift coefficient, drag divergence Mach number,\nand Korn factor for each of the airfoils analyzed.\nThe airfoil design used in the design was originally generated for a lift coefficient of 0.9 and had\na shock location at 57% chord. Since the wing design process was performed for a lift coefficient\nof 0.7, the shock moved forward to 55% chord for a 12% thickness-to-chord ratio. An additional\nairfoil exploration was performed updating design parameters to the actual wing design\nconditions. Airfoil L2 was generated which pushed the shock back to 62% at 12% thickness-tochord ratio. This airfoil was designed for a lift coefficient of 0.725, the maximum sectional lift\ncoefficient for the wing planform at a cruise lift coefficient of 0.7. A thicker section (L3) was also\ndesigned but was determined to have lower performance than L2 for this configuration.\n\n86\n\ntmod1\n\ntmod2\n\ntmod3\n\n0.50 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.63 0.64 0.65 0.66 0.67 0.68 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 2.77 \xe2\x80\x93 Drag Rise for tmod1 thru tmod3\nTable 2.14 \xe2\x80\x93 Properties for Wings tmod1 thru tmod3\n\nAvg.

It is shown\nthat the new wings drag divergence Mach number decreased to 0.699 which is deemed not\nenough after the expected twist and trim knockdowns. A hybrid airfoil (created by averaging\ncross sections L1 and L2) was also run (tmod h), its drag divergence was not significantly better\nthan tmod2 x.

Drag levels were\nnot significantly different between all the designs because increased laminar run benefits were\noffset by increased compressibility drag.\nTable 2.15 \xe2\x80\x93 Properties for Wings with Modified Airfoils\n\nAvg.

A comparison between the elliptic, university,\nand final wing twist is shown in Figure 2.79. The wing twist schedule (airfoil twist vs. span) is\nillustrated in Figure 2.80. Figure 2.81 shows the effect of twist on drag divergence. The university\nlift distribution could not be matched in the region of the body due to the body\xe2\x80\x99s influence on\nthe wing.

Consistent with the Flo22 analysis, both the wing and body were included in the\nanalysis. A low fidelity wing-to-body fairing was generated; the results of the CFD solution in the\nimmediate regions around the fairing may not be representative of the finalized geometry\nhowever, the results appeared to be within reason. The overflow grid included 13 zones and\ncontained 14.4 million points. The solution was generated with QCR enabled, the SA-RC\nturbulence model, and upwind differencing.\nDrag rise was calculated from Mach 0.5 to 0.76, CL sweeps were generated at various Mach\nNumbers to calculate lift curve slope for the FEM and to determine viscous e (an input to CASES\naerodynamic methods), and a drag polar was developed to determine the optimum cruise lift\ncoefficient. These high speed solutions were calculated at a cruise altitude of 42,000 feet, 11.2\nmillion Reynolds Number, at Mach 0.7.\n\n90\n\nThe boundary conditions for the model assumed that the body was fully turbulent and that the\nwing was laminar on the upper surface from 8.3% span to 93.8% span. The laminar region starts\nat the stagnation point and propagates aft until transition. The transition location was\ndetermined by first solving a fully turbulent solution and manually inspecting the solution for\npressure gradients favorable for laminar flow. These regions were updated with laminar\nboundary conditions and the solution was restarted. The wing tip was not included due to poor\ngradients and turbulent interference from the tip. The wing root region was not included because\nof the turbulence generated by the body. The wing lower surface transitioned to turbulent after\nonly a few gridlines. Figure 2.82 shows examples of the laminar flow regions of the SUGAR wing\nfor various flight conditions. Table 2.17 shows the calculated laminar flow regions for various\nconditions run.\n\n91\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 2.82 \xe2\x80\x93 CF Plot Depicts Regions of Laminar Flow a) Mach 0.70, CL 0.70, b) Mach 0.65, CL 0.70\n\n92\n\nTable 2.17 \xe2\x80\x93 Flight Conditions and Laminar Flow Extent\n\nMach\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.60\n\n0.20\n0.40\n0.70\n0.70\n\n0.65\n\n0.70\n\n0.69\n\n0.70\n\n0.70\n0.70\n0.71\n0.74\n0.76\n0.76\n\nChordwise Extent of\nLaminar Flow\n\nCL\n\n0.40\n0.70\n0.70\n0.70\n0.40\n0.70\n\n49.40%\n49.40%\n0.60%\n1.00%\n1.5% Inboard\n49.4% Outboard\n1.5% Inboard\n49.4% Outboard\n49.40%\n49.40%\n51.80%\n54.20%\n65.70%\n65.70%\n\nThe wing drag rise was calculated via the Overflow analysis. The results are plotted in Figure 2.83\nalong with the final twisted wing drag rise calculated from Flo22. The turbulent curve\ncorresponds to the Overflow results with a fully turbulent boundary condition. The fully laminar\ncurve is calculated using input regions of laminar flow based on the turbulent results. The laminar\ncurve with pressure drag credit only is the same solution as the full laminar curve ignoring the\nreduction in drag due to skin friction. The Overflow results might predict a slightly faster drag\ndivergence Mach number than Flo22. The drag levels of the Flo22 results should be ignored.\nAerodynamic buildups calculated in CASES start with a fully turbulent assumption anchored at\nMach 0.50 and book keep all Mach number induced changes in drag from the anchor point as\ncompressibility effects. The internally calculated compressibility drag (which would follow a curve\nsimilar to the turbulent line) can be adjusted by a compressibility correction table (a function of\nMach and CL). The CASES compressibility correction was calculated using the offset between\nturbulent and fully laminar curves such as those below. The drag increment from the cruise\ncondition (Mach 0.7; Cl 0.7) is shown in Table 2.18. This includes the increment for the pressure\nand laminar skin friction coefficient (summing the turbulent, pressure, and skin friction\ncomponents totals to the laminar flow compressibility drag increment).\n\n93\n\nLaminar Pressure Drag Credit Only\n\nFully Laminar\n\nIncremental Drag Coefficient from M = 0.50\n\nTurbulent\n\n0.50 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.63 0.64 0.65 0.66 0.67 0.68 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 2.83 \xe2\x80\x93 Overflow Drag Rise CL 0.70\nTable 2.18 \xe2\x80\x93 Drag Buildup from Turbulent Overflow Solution\n\nTurbulent Delta from\nM=0.5\nLaminar Pressure Delta\nLaminar Cf Delta\nTotal Drag Delta from\nM=0.5\n\n0.00063\n-0.00092\n-0.00166\n-0.00185\n\nInitial passes at aerodynamic buildups indicated that the wing may want to operate at higher lift\ncoefficients than the initial estimate of 0.70. To verify this, the Overflow analysis was used to\ninvestigate the aircraft drag polar to higher lift coefficients. Figure 2.84 shows that even up to a\nlift coefficient of 0.8 the polar remains fairly linear. Lift-to-drag ratio at a lift coefficient of 0.7 is\n33.05 and increases to 33.27 at a lift coefficient of 0.8. For further verification, the drag rise curve\nwas recalculated at a lift coefficient of 0.8.

CASES empirical\nmethods can estimate these values but the database that supports the estimation does not\ninclude aircraft in the vicinity of aspect ratio 20. To verify the calculation performed by CASES, a\ndrag polar was generated at Mach 0.50 and includes both viscous and laminar curves. The viscous\ncurve corresponded very closely with the CASES prediction (shown in Section 2.3.1). The CASES\ncalculated value was not calibrated. A comparison of the laminar wing span loads and sectional\nlift coefficients are shown in Figure 2.86.\n\nFigure 2.86 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of Span Load and Sectional Lift Coefficient Distributions for SUGAR Wing \xe2\x80\x93 Body\n\nIn addition to calibrating the aerodynamic buildup, the Overflow analysis was used to generate\ndata for the aeroelastic FEM. The flight envelope of the airplane was swept from lift coefficients\nranging from -0.2 to 0.8 across Mach numbers ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. The resulting lift curve\nslopes are shown in Figure 2.87.

The surfaced Krueger\ngeometry was defined in two spanwise components separated by the leading edge planform\nbreak location. The single element trailing edge flap was defined in two spanwise segments albeit\nwith continuous surfaces; this arrangement would be consistent with the flaperons located aft\nof each engine.\nThe rigged (i.e., deployed) position of the Krueger and flaps were specified in terms of their\nstreamwise deflection and corresponding gap and overhang relative to the wing box. For the\nflaps a generic rigging schedule was used which was representative of a typical fowler-motion\nflap as a function of the deflection. Deployed flap positions were defined for streamwise\ndeflections of 10\xc2\xb0, 20\xc2\xb0, and 30\xc2\xb0. No optimization was performed on the maximum landing flap\ndeflection or on the rigging positions (in terms of gap and overhang).\nLeading edge Krueger deflections were defined for 35\xc2\xb0, 40\xc2\xb0, 45\xc2\xb0, 50\xc2\xb0, and 55\xc2\xb0 positions. For\nsimplicity each Krueger deflection used the same gap and overhang position which was defined\n\n97\n\nusing the results of previous Boeing proprietary Krueger design studies. The Krueger deployed\nposition was then established using Boeing low speed max lift coefficient methodology. The max\nlift coefficient method uses solutions from the Boeing proprietary panel method code DACVINE\n(Douglas Aircraft Company Viscous Neumann) (11) coupled with an empirical \xe2\x80\x9cdelta pressure\ncoefficient peak\xe2\x80\x9d criteria (12). The DACVINE code is a fast, flexible, and robust panel method flow\nsolver capable of handling complex geometries such as a complete aircraft configuration with the\nhigh lift system deployed. The code employs relatively simple surface paneling along with nonlinear Kutta condition and mathematically consistent higher-order formulation. The delta\npressure coefficient peak criteria was developed from a large database of 2-D high lift system\nwind tunnel test results coupled with an empirical flap reduction schedule which accounts for\nthree-dimensional viscous effects on the high lift system. A flap reduction schedule was\ndeveloped through correlation with proprietary 3-D full-span high lift wind tunnel test data; the\ncorrelation includes a variation to account for Reynolds Number effects. Thus, for this study the\n10\xc2\xb0, 20\xc2\xb0, and 30\xc2\xb0 geometric flap deflections were simulated using equivalent effective flap\ndeflections (i.e., lower) using the flap reduction schedule. Note that the flap reduction schedule\nonly applies to the trailing edge elements; leading edge devices such as slats and Krueger flaps\nare analyzed using their actual geometric deflection.\nLift curves and max lift coefficient values were determined for each of the five Krueger deflections\n(35\xc2\xb0 to 55\xc2\xb0) with the trailing edge flap position set at the equivalent 30\xc2\xb0 landing position. Based\non these results the 50\xc2\xb0 Krueger deflection was selected as the optimum; this Krueger deflection\nwas used for all subsequent configurations during the TBW high lift system development. Sample\nresults from the study showing the DACVINE predicted Krueger delta pressure coefficient peak\nvalues along with the delta pressure coefficient peak criteria are given in Figure 2.88 for the 50\xc2\xb0\nKrueger / 30\xc2\xb0 flap configuration.\n\n98\n\n-16\n\nCLmax = 4.48 @ 22.32\xc2\xb0\n-14\n\n-12\n\n\xce\x94Cp\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nPercent Span, \xce\xb7\nKrueger 50\xc2\xb0 @ Alpha=22\xc2\xb0\n\nKrueger 50\xc2\xb0 @ Alpha=22.5\xc2\xb0\n\ndCp Crit\n\nFigure 2.88 \xe2\x80\x93 Predicted \xce\x94Cp-peak Levels on the 50\xc2\xb0 Leading Edge Krueger.\n\nIn addition to evaluating the effects of the Krueger and flap deflections DACVINE was also used\nto evaluate the effects of the engine nacelles, pylon, wing strut, and gear pods on the low speed\nconfiguration. A table showing all of the configurations evaluated during the high lift design\nprocess is shown in Figure 2.89.

Prior to the start of the high lift design process\nit was recognized that the CASES low speed database does not include data for wings with aspect\nratios as high as those of the SUGAR configuration and thus the low speed aero characteristics\nbuildup for the TBW configuration would rely heavily on the results from the DACVINE solutions.\nThe components used for estimating the final lift curves and drag polars are shown below:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLift curves\no CL\xce\xb1 \xe2\x80\x93 DACVINE predictions\no CL\xce\xb1=0 \xe2\x80\x93 DACVINE predictions\no CLmax \xe2\x80\x93 DACVINE predictions with \xce\x94CPpeak criteria\no \xce\x94CL trim = 5% (conceptual estimate)\nDrag polars\no CDo \xe2\x80\x93CASES High Speed Buildup\no CDi \xe2\x80\x93 DACVINE\no CDp \xe2\x80\x93 Empirical Database\no \xce\x94CDtrim \xe2\x80\x93 3%CDtotal\no \xce\x94CDgear \xe2\x80\x93 CASES Support Tables\n\n100\n\nThe single element Fowler motion flap is shown in Figure 2.90 at 30\xc2\xb0 of equivalent deflection.\nNote that the flap span was assumed to be continuous across its entire extent which is consistent\nwith the use of a flaperon behind the engine for high speed control.

The configuration\ndefinition was determined by the MDO and design activities described above. To determine the\nflutter weight penalty, the wing, strut, jury strut, and landing gear pylon were optimized with and\nwithout flutter constraints. Two distinct strut configurations were sized, one with the strut\nattached at the front spar and one with a V-strut attached to both the front and rear spars. The\nsized detailed FEM is the basis for the aeroelastic wind tunnel test described in Section 2.4.9.\n2.1.8.1\nCenter Body FEM Description\nThe finite element model of the SUGAR aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s center fuselage consists of a detailed mesh of\nthe fuselage center section, the landing gear pylon, and the landing gear structure; geometric\nand material properties for each structural element are also included.\nBoeing provided the original geometry layout to Virginia Tech, who then modified it, ensuring\nmeshable surfaces and mesh continuity. Major modifications to the original geometry include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFuselage longerons: The original geometry lacked the definition of fuselage stiffening\nmembers. Upon discussion, geometry defining the position, orientation and shape of the\nfuselage longerons and of the landing gear pylon stiffeners was added to the model.\n\n103\n\nMesh \xe2\x80\x93 Fuselage Center Section\n\nFigure 2.95 shows various views of the fuselage center section mesh. The mesh consists of\nquadrilateral shell elements (QUAD4) of approximately 2 by 2 inches. At the fore and aft ends\nelement size varies to allow mesh transition at the interface with the front and rear fuselage\nsections.\n\nFigure 2.95 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Aircraft Fuselage Center Section Mesh\n\nMesh \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear, Longerons, and Stiffeners\n\nThe landing gear, longerons, and stiffeners are modeled using beam elements (CBEAM) with\nappropriate cross-sections and dimensions. Figure 2.96 presents a view of the landing gear,\nfuselage longerons, and gear pylon stiffeners. Beam cross-sectional shapes and dimensions are\ndescribed below.\n\n104\n\nFigure 2.96 \xe2\x80\x93 Structure, Fuselage Longerons and Gear Pylon Stiffeners Mesh\n\nProperties \xe2\x80\x93 Fuselage Skin\n\nFuselage skin panels are modeled using quadrilateral shell elements (QUAD4) with 10 properties\nassociated with each element. Reference (13) shows 0.04 inches as a typical skin thickness for\nsimilar aircraft, so, initially, that constant thickness was applied to all skin elements. All skin\nelements located in any section \xe2\x80\x93 between any two consecutive frames \xe2\x80\x93 have the identical set\nof properties associated with them, which allows the whole section\xe2\x80\x99s thickness to change during\nthe sizing phase.\nProperties \xe2\x80\x93 Fuselage Frames\n\nThe frames are also modeled using quadrilateral shell elements (QUAD4), again associating 10\nproperties to each element. Each frame has a unique properties set, allowing their thicknesses\nto change independently during the sizing phase (as with the skins, the initial thicknesses were\nset uniformly at 0.04 inches).\n\n105\n\nProperties \xe2\x80\x93 Passenger Deck and Cargo Deck\n\nThe passenger deck is also modeled using quadrilateral shell elements (QUAD4), but here only\ntwo properties are defined, one in the center fuselage section, the second in the front and rear\nfuselage sections.\nProperties \xe2\x80\x93 Longerons\n\nThe fuselage longerons are modeled using beam\nelements (CBEAM), with the cross-section shown in\nFigure 2.97.

The diameter of the beams varies depending on the structural element as listed in Table\n2.19. The beam numbering refers to the structural layout presented in Figure 2.98.\nTable 2.19 \xe2\x80\x93 Diameter of the beams forming the landing gear structure\n\nDiameter\n(in)\n6\n4.4\n4\n3.2\n2\n\nStructural Part\n(See Figure 2.98)\nBeam 1, Beam 2\nBeam 3\nBeam 4, Beam 5, Beam 6\nBeam 7\nBeam 8\n\n106\n\nThe landing gear structure is connected to the landing gear pylon structure by three spherical\njoints (blue dots in Figure 2.98); this avoids stress concentrations due to the transfer of moments\nbetween the two.\nThe wheels are connected to the main gear leg by a hinge that allows rotation in the XZ plane\n(fore-aft and up-down).

The properties of these materials\nare listed in Table 2.20 and Table 2.21,\nrespectively.\n\nFigure 2.98 \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Gear Structure\n\nTable 2.20 \xe2\x80\x93 Titanium Alloy Mechanical Properties\n\nMaterial\nElastic Modulus\nPoisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio\nDensity\n\nTitanium Alloy\n16 Msi\n0.33\n0.17 lb/in3\n\nTable 2.21 \xe2\x80\x93 Aluminum Alloy Mechanical Properties\n\nMaterial\nElastic Modulus\nPoisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio\nDensity\n\nAluminum Alloy\n10.6 Msi\n0.33\n0.1 lb/in3\n\nCenter Body FEM Checkout\n\nWe performed a (qualitative) preliminary static analysis on the fuselage structure to visualize the\nload paths for each of four distinct load cases. This ensured consistency between the results of\n\n107\n\nthe applied loads and the real system of forces acting on the structure. The von Mises stress\ndistributions for the four load cases are presented in Figure 2.99 to Figure 2.106.\nThe four load cases were:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVertical load introduced in the landing gear structure\nLateral load introduced in the landing gear structure\nDrag load introduced in the landing gear structure\nTension load introduced at the wing strut attachment\n\nFigure 2.99 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Center Fuselage Caused By a Landing Gear Vertical Load\n\n108\n\nFigure 2.100 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Gear Pylon Caused By a Landing Gear Vertical Load\n\nFigure 2.101 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Center Fuselage Caused By a Landing Gear Lateral Load\n\n109\n\nFigure 2.102 \xe2\x80\x93 Von Stress Distribution in the Gear Pylon Caused By a Landing Gear Lateral Load\n\nFigure 2.103 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Center Fuselage Caused By a Landing Gear Drag Load\n\n110\n\nFigure 2.104 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Gear Pylon Caused By a Landing Gear Drag Load\n\nFigure 2.105 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Center Fuselage Caused By a Wing Strut Load\n\n111\n\nFigure 2.106 \xe2\x80\x93 Stress Distribution in the Gear Pylon Caused By a Wing Strut Load\n\n2.1.8.2\nWing FEM Description\nThe wing FEM was generated to match the OML using Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary RapidFem process\nwhich generated skins, spar webs, rib webs, spar caps, rib caps, and control surfaces. Streamwise\nrib spacing was set to 25 inches.\nEngine/nacelle/pylon weight and air-load application grids attach to the wing using RBE3\nelements. The RBE3 element attaches to the wing at the intersection of the front spar and a rib,\nand to the rib half way between the front and rear spars.\nControl surfaces are supported at inboard and outboard hinges that react shear loads. Control\nsurface hinge moments are reacted at the inboard hinge.\nThe strut and jury are modeled as box beams where the box width, depth, and skin thickness can\nbe varied. Strut attachment to the wing and gear pylon is a pin joint reacting all 3 shear loads and\ntorsion about the local strut beam axis. Clamped joints connect the jury to the wing and strut.\nAll 2D wing box elements are of composite material with the following layup used for the cover\npanels: Layers 1 and 7, 45 degrees; Layers 2 and 6, -45 degrees; Layers 3 and 5, 90 degrees; and\nLayer 4, 0 degrees. Thickness of all +/-45 degree layers and the two 90 degree layers are the\nsame. In addition, a smeared T shaped stringer is added as layer 8 and 9 as shown in Figure 2.107.\nThe stinger spacing is 5 inches and the stringer size scales up with the skin so the stringer is a\nconstant 33% of the stringer plus skin area.\n\n112\n\nThe 2D element lamina stiffness for all wing skins and webs, the 1D element laminate stiffness\nused for wing caps, strut, and jury strut, and the 3D stiffness used for the control surfaces are\nshown in Table 2.22.\n\nFigure 2.107 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM skin and stringer geometry\nTable 2.22 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Stiffness Properties\n\n2D Element Lamina\nStiffness\nE1\n2.35x107 lb/in2\nE2\n1.06x106 lb/in2\n0.34\n\xce\xbd\nG12 8.00x105 lb/in2\n\n1D Cap Laminate Stiffness\nE\n\n\xce\xbd\n\nG12\n\n1.05x107\n0.30\n4.04x106\n\nlb/in2\n2\n\nlb/in\n\n3D Stiffness\nE\n\n\xce\xbd\n\nG12\n\n5.00x106\n0.25\n2.00x106\n\nlb/in2\nlb/in2\n\n2.1.8.3\nFinite Element Model Integration\nIntegration of the FEM involved adding fuselage and tail beam elements and joining the Virginia\nTech generated center body FEM to the Boeing generated wing FEM. Using rigid beam elements\nfor the forward fuselage, aft fuselage, and tail instead of building a 3D FEM simplified the model\ngeneration and analysis. (The goal of the finite element analysis was to size the wing, and we\nmade the assumption that the dynamics of the forward and aft fuselage and tail would not\nsignificantly impact the wing dynamics.) Body and tail aerodynamics were applied to the model\nthrough the beam elements. The forward fuselage and aft fuselage/tail attach to the 3D\ncenterbody FEM using an RBE3 element, which adds no stiffness to the centerbody.\nThe wing is attached to the centerbody in three manners. The first is the primary vertical\nconnection between the wing and fuselage, and occurs at the wing front and rear spars. Here, a\nframe-mounted post extends up from the fuselage and attaches to a trap panel. The trap panel\nextends from the post to the front and rear spars of the wing at the side-of-body rib. This\narrangement is shown in Figure 2.108.\n\n113\n\nThe second is the primary fore and aft connection between the wing and fuselage. Here, the grids\nalong the fuselage wing cutout are connected, in the x direction only, to the closest grids on the\nwing\xe2\x80\x99s lower skin. This is shown in Figure 2.109.\nThe third is the primary lateral connection between the wing and fuselage, where the end grids\nof three fuselage frames are connected, in the y direction only, to grids on the wing lower skin.\nThis is shown in Figure 2.110.\nThe integrated FEM with 396,240 degrees of freedom is shown in Figure 2.111.

The density of the composite material was increased by 17% to\nrepresent cutouts, fasteners, and other unmodeled features. All remaining weight is provided to\nmatch the vehicle group weight statement shown in Section 2.3.2, and is spread on the model as\nconcentrated mass items. Spread weight representing Operating Weight includes the stuffed\nfuselage and tails, stuffed engine/nacelle/pylon, wing control surfaces, and wing systems. Spread\nweights representing estimated joint weights at the interfaces of the wing/strut, strut/jury,\nstrut/landing gear pylon, strut/wing, and of the wing fold joint were included in the model.\nTable 2.23 lists the fuel and payload combinations that were analyzed. Concentrated mass items\nwere spread to represent the five distinct cases.\nTable 2.23 \xe2\x80\x93 Payload and Fuel Combinations\n\nFuel\nFuel to reach MTOW from MZFW\nFull\nFull\nReserve\nReserve\n\nPayload\nMax to Reach MZFW\nMax to reach MTOW with Full Fuel\nNone\nMax to Reach MZFW\nNone\n\n2.1.8.5\nAerodynamic Model and Corrections\nThe doublet lattice aerodynamic model of the SUGAR TBW configuration is shown in Figure 2.113,\nwith panels representing the wing, body, tails, nacelles, and struts. The Overflow aerodynamic\nmodel\xe2\x80\x99s grid of 14.4 million points only represented the wing and body. The Overflow results\n\n116\n\nwere linearized between two conditions as listed in Table 2.24. The linear doublet lattice\naerodynamics were modified, or corrected, to match the slope and intercept of the wing\nsectional aerodynamics from the Overflow CFD analyses. Mach numbers above the dive Mach of\n0.82 are used for flutter analyses up to the 1.15 speed pad required by FAA regulations.\nOverflow results showed a significant aft shift in aerodynamic center for Mach numbers above\n0.82, and at Mach 0.86 exhibited non-linear behavior in the angle of attack range investigated,\nso in running flutter we incorporated corrections using the Overflow results. We input these\ncorrections to Nastran as DMI WKK and FA2J matrices for static aeroelasticity runs, and as DMI\nWTFACT matrices for flutter and dynamic gust runs.\nSince the Overflow model was wing/body only, we calculated sectional lift curve slope and AC\ncorrections using a wing/body doublet lattice model. Figure 2.114 and Figure 2.115 show the\nwing sectional doublet lattice lift curve slope and aerodynamic center corrected to exactly match\nthe Overflow results.\nThe wing corrections calculated using the wing/body doublet lattice model are used with the full\ndoublet lattice model, while employing the uncorrected doublet lattice on all non-wing panels.\nIn addition to the lift curve slope correction a lift at zero alpha was input for quasistatic\naeroelastic runs at Mach 0.7, 0.76, and 0.82. The correction for lift at zero alpha was found by\nmatching the Overflow sectional data for the Cl = 0.7 condition with an elastic doublet lattice run.\nThis was done for the original unsized model, which was stiffer than the sized model.\nAs discussed in Section 2.1.8.8, the loads generated for the unsized model were conservatively\nused for all sizing. Finally, drag data were generated by interpolating the Overflow sectional data\nto the angle of attack for critical 2.5G and -1G conditions, and forces were generated at all wing\nleading edge grids to match the Overflow results.\n\n117\n\nFigure 2.113 \xe2\x80\x93 Doublet Lattice Aerodynamic Model\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nCL\xce\xb1\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\nCL\xce\xb1\n\n0.3\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nM=.70 Overflow\nM=.70 Corrected DL\nM=.76 Overflow\nM=.76 Corrected DL\nM=.82 Overflow\nM=.82 Corrected DL\n\n0.05\n\nM=.86 High Overflow\nM=.86 High Corrected DL\nM=.86 Low Overflow\nM=.86 Low Corrected DL\nM=.90 Overflow\nM=.90 Corrected DL\nM=.94 Overflow\nM=.94 Corrected DL\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n% Wing Span\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n% Wing Span\n\nFigure 2.114 \xe2\x80\x93 Section Lift Curve Slope Comparison\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nAC\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\nAC %C\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nM=.86 High Overflow\nM=.86 High Corrected DL\nM=.86 Low Overflow\nM=.86 Low Corrrected DL\nM=.90 Overflow\nM=.90 Corrected DL\nM=.94 Overflow\nM=.94 Corrected DL\n\n0.2\n\nM=.70 Overflow\nM=.70 Corrected DL\nM=.76 Overflow\nM=.76 Corrected DL\nM=.82 Overflow\nM=.82 Corrected DL\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n-0.1\n\n% Wing Span\n\n% Wing Span\n\nFigure 2.115 \xe2\x80\x93 Sectional Aerodynamic Center Comparison\n\n118\n\nTable 2.24 \xe2\x80\x93 Overflow Correction Conditions\n\nMach\n0.70\n0.76\n0.82\n0.86 Low\n0.86 High\n0.90\n0.94\n\nAlpha 1\n-0.21\n-0.38\n1.39\n0.00\n2.20\n1.40\n1.40\n\nCL 1\n0.400\n0.400\n0.400\n-0.164\n0.118\n0.104\n0.010\n\nAlpha 2\n1.67\n1.38\n3.96\n2.20\n4.00\n4.00\n4.00\n\nCL 2\n0.700\n0.700\n0.700\n0.118\n0.526\n0.255\n0.304\n\n2.1.8.6\nLoad Conditions\nLoad conditions investigated include 2.5G and -1G balance maneuvers, 2G flaps down balance\nmaneuvers, takeoff roll, 0.5G turn, braked roll, and 1-cos dynamic gust. Flight loads were\ncalculated in Nastran Sol 144 with the horizontal tail being used to trim the vehicle. Doublet\nlattice aerodynamics were corrected to match Overflow CFD results as described in the previous\nsection. Ground conditions were calculated by finding the inertial loads required to balance input\nlanding gear loads. Gust loads were calculated using Nastran Sol 146.\nAn extensive survey of 2.5G and -1G balance maneuvers was done to determine critical load\nconditions. Results from the survey showing 2.5G and -1G wing critical limit external and internal\nshear, moments, and torque loads are show in Figure 2.116.\nThe internal loads plots in Figure 2.116 show the large decrease in loads inboard of where the\nstrut removes load from the wing. The bending moment drops significantly inboard of the strut\nattachment, nearly reaching zero at the jury, then growing slightly to the fuselage side-of-body.\nTorsion increases at the strut but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t increase much going inboard, resulting in a significant\nbenefit at the side-of-body. Wing fore/aft bending increases inboard of the strut.\nCritical 2.5G and -1G conditions are at M = 0.76, 230 KEAS with maximum payload and fuel to\nreach maximum takeoff weight.\nA sea level 200 KEAS flaps down 2G balance maneuver was run. All trailing edge surfaces were\ndeflected to 30 degrees except the outboard aileron.\nAll landing gear loads were calculated using a conservative aircraft weight of 149,294 lb. The\ntakeoff roll ground condition load had main and nose gear loads calculated to produce 2G\nvertical. The turn condition had main and nose gear loads calculated to produce 0.5G lateral and\n1G vertical. The braked roll condition had main gear loads calculated to produce a 0.93G\ndeceleration and 1.17G vertical.\n\n119\n\nA survey of 1-cos discrete dynamic gust loads was completed using the criteria in Federal\nAirworthiness Regulations Part 25. The flight profile alleviation factor was conservatively\ncalculated as 0.85 at sea level, increasing to 1.0 at 50,000 ft. The gust design velocities are plotted\nin Figure 2.117. A number of gust gradients were run to determine critical loads for each\ncondition.\nAs shown in Figure 2.118, results from the gust survey showed loads less than the 2.5G and -1G\nsteady pitch maneuvers. Since the gust loads were significantly below the steady pitch\nmaneuvers loads, no gust conditions were included in the sizing runs.\nThe loads used for the sizing runs were calculated using the initial unsized model and not updated\nfor the sized model. The wing for the sized model washes out more and provides more aeroelastic\nrelief to the wing loads. This can be seen in Figure 2.118, which shows wing vertical bending\nmoments of the sized wing lower than the initial unsized loads.\n\n120\n\nWing Limit Lateral Shear\n\nWing Limit Axial Shear\n1.5E+05\n\n2.0E+04\n\nM=.7 External\n\nM=.7 External\nM=.7 Internal\n\nM=.7 Internal\n\n1.0E+05\n\nM=.76 External\n\nM=.76 External\n\nM=.76 Internal\n\nM=.76 Internal\n\n1.0E+04\n\n5.0E+04\n\nM=.82 External\n\nM=.82 External\nM=.82 Int\n\nM=.82 Int\n\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\nVx (lb)\n\nVy (lb)\n\n-5.0E+04\n\n-1.0E+05\n\n-1.0E+04\n\n-1.5E+05\n\n-2.0E+04\n\n-2.0E+05\n\n-2.5E+05\n\n-3.0E+04\n-3.0E+05\n\n-3.5E+05\n\n-4.0E+04\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nWing Limit Vertical Bending Moment\n\nWing Limit Vertical Shear\n6.0E+07\n\n1.4E+05\n\nM=.7 External\n\nM=.7 External\n\nM=.7 Internal\n\nM=.7 Internal\n\n1.2E+05\n\n5.0E+07\n\nM=.76 External\n\nM=.76 External\nM=.76 Internal\n\nM=.76 Internal\n\n1.0E+05\n\nM=.82 External\n\nM=.82 External\n\n4.0E+07\n\nM=.82 Int\n\nM=.82 Int\n\n8.0E+04\n\n3.0E+07\n\nMx (In-lb)\n\nVz (lb)\n\n6.0E+04\n\n4.0E+04\n\n2.0E+07\n\n1.0E+07\n\n2.0E+04\n\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n-1.0E+07\n-2.0E+04\n\n-2.0E+07\n\n-4.0E+04\n\n-3.0E+07\n\n-6.0E+04\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nWing Limit Fwd/AFT Bending\n\nWing Limit Torsion\n1.5E+07\n\n4.0E+06\n\n2.0E+06\n\n1.0E+07\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n5.0E+06\n-2.0E+06\n\nT (In-lb)\n\nM=.7 External\n\n-6.0E+06\n\nM=.7 Internal\n\nMz (In-lb)\n\n0.0E+00\n\n-4.0E+06\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nM=.76 External\n\nM=.76 Internal\nM=.82 External\n\nM=.76 Internal\nM=.82 External\n\n-1.0E+07\n\nM=.82 Int\n\nM=.82 Int\n\n-1.0E+07\n\n-1.5E+07\n-1.2E+07\n\n-1.4E+07\n\n800\n\nM=.7 Internal\n\nM=.76 External\n\n-8.0E+06\n\n700\n\nM=.7 External\n\n-5.0E+06\n\n-2.0E+07\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nWing Sta (in)\n\nFigure 2.116 \xe2\x80\x93 Limit Loads 2.5 and -1G Balance Maneuvers\n\n121\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n50\n\n45\n\nDesign Gust Velocity (ft/sec)\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\nSL\n15000 ft\n19075 ft\n22706 ft\n50000 ft\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nGust Gradient Distance (ft)\n\nFigure 2.117 \xe2\x80\x93 Design Gust Velocities\n6.0E+07\nInitial 2.5G Q=1.25\nSized 2.5G Q=1.25\nGust Total Q=2.41\n\n5.0E+07\n\nGust Incrementa Q=2.41\nGust 1G Q=2.41\n\nMx (In-lb)\n\n4.0E+07\n\n3.0E+07\n\n2.0E+07\n\n1.0E+07\n\n0.0E+00\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nWing Sta (in)\nFigure 2.118 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Limit Vertical Bending Moment Comparison\n\n2.1.8.7\nStructural Sizing and Optimization\nStructural sizing and optimization was run using Nastran Sol 200. Sized structure includes strut,\njury, landing gear pylon, wing skins, spars, ribs, and spar and rib caps. All 2D elements had the\n\n122\n\nthicknesses of 0, +/-45, and 90 degree plies as separate design variables. The strut and jury were\nmodeled as box beam elements with design variables of the box chord, depth, and skin and spar\nthickness. The box depth was 0.3 times the box chord.\nThe strength constraint for 2D elements was lamina principal strain less than 0.0045 at ultimate\nload. The strength constraint for cap elements was laminate stress less than 90,000 PSI at\nultimate load. The strength constraint for the strut and jury elements was laminate principal\nstrain less than 0.0045 at ultimate load. No buckling was allowed at ultimate load. The flutter\nconstraint was damping factor G less than 0.02. Minimum skin gage was 0.1 inch.\nStructural sizing was performed on two different strut/jury configurations, Configurations 1 and\n3 (so named because of how the study was set up). Configuration 1 had the strut running from\nthe landing gear pylon attachment point to the wing front spar at 57.6% semi-span. Configuration\n3 is the V strut, with one strut running from the landing gear pylon attachment point to the wing\nfront spar at 57.6% semi-span and another strut running from the gear pylon attachment point\nto the rear spar at 57.6% semi-span.\nSizing on the first strut configuration was done without flutter constraints, with 1.09Vd flutter\nconstrains, and with 1.15Vd flutter constraints to determine the flutter weight penalty. The Vstrut configuration was only sized with 1.15Vd flutter constraints. An equation relating weight\nand strut/jury wetted area to fuel burn was minimized as the objective in the optimization runs.\nUsing this equation Sol 200 minimized weight and strut/jury chord.\n2.1.8.8\nInitial Linear Results\nNASTRAN Sol 200 converged on solutions for the front spar strut model with the 3 different\nconstraints and for the V-strut model with 1.15 flutter constraints. A weight summary of these\nsolutions is shown in Table 2.25. The results show only a 324 lb penalty for meeting 1.09Vd flutter\nconstraints and 346 lb penalty for meeting 1.15Vd on the front spar strut model. The V-strut\nmodel shows a 381 lb weight reduction over the front spar model with the 1.15 flutter\nconstraints.\nSized thicknesses for the wing skins and wing rib and spar webs are shown in Figure 2.119 and\nFigure 2.120 for strut Configuration 1 with 1.09Vd flutter constraints. The skin thickness peaks at\njust over 0.4 inch on the upper skin at the strut attachment location. A good bit of the lower\nsurface is minimum gage while a smaller area of the upper skin is minimum gage. The skins also\nshow increased thicknesses locally at the engine attachment and side of body.\nPeak thickness for the wing spar webs is 1.62 inch for the rear spar at the side of body and 0.9\ninch for the front spar at the strut attachment. Much of the spar webs are minimum gage except\nfor increases at the side of body, strut attachment, control surface attachment locations, and at\nthe tip of the wing.\n\n123\n\nAlmost all of the ribs are minimum gage except for at the tip of the wing. Sized wing rib and spar\ncap areas are shown in Figure 2.121. Most of the caps have a minimum area of 0.1 in^2 except\nat the strut attachment and wing tip. The front spar caps at strut attachment peak at 4.4 in^2.\nSized 2D and 1D element thickness and areas for the sized landing gear pylon are shown in Figure\n2.122 and Figure 2.123. The landing gear pylon front spar and rear spar have local peaks at the\ncorners of the bulkhead at the side-of-body, the max being 5.4 inch on the rear spar web. There\nare also increased gages at the front and rear spars where the gear loads are introduced to the\ngear pylon. The gear pylon 1D elements are almost all minimum gage except upper caps on the\nrear spar, which peaked out at 10 in^2.\nSized strut and jury box chords are shown in Figure 2.124. The strut and jury chords shown for\nConfiguration 1 were close to optimal for the strength-only sizing, 1.09Vd flutter constraint, and\n1.15 Vd flutter constraint sizing. The strut has minimum chord at the endpoints and jury\nattachment, and maximum chord between the endpoints and jury attachment to resist buckling.\nA curve showing the configuration 3 forward and aft strut chords added together is shown for\ncomparison. The jury chord increases linearly from the strut to a maximum value at the wing.\nFigure 2.125 shows the sized strut box skin and spar thickness distributions. The skin and spar\nboth have minimum thickness between the endpoints and the jury attachment, where the chord\nis maximum. The configuration 3 forward strut has larger skin thickness than the configuration 1\nstruts, while the configuration 3 aft strut skin thicknesses are smaller. The configuration 3\nforward strut spar thickness is in line with configuration 1; the configuration 3 aft strut spar\nthickness is smaller.\nFigure 2.126 shows the sized jury box skin and spar thickness distributions. The configuration 1\njury box skins are near constant for most of the jury but have a larger thickness at the wing. The\nconfiguration 3 front and aft jury skin thickness curves are relatively flat. The configuration 1 jury\nbox spars increase from the strut to a maximum value at the wing, and the configuration 3 aft\nspar thickness is lowest of all. Maximum stress and strain results for configuration 1 with 1.09Vd\nflutter constraints have been included to compare with strength allowables.\nFigure 2.127 shows wing upper and lower skin ultimate principal strain for the 2.5G balance\nmaneuver for skin ply 1. The figure shows the upper surface peak minimum strain of 0.00306,\nand the lower surface peak maximum strain of 0.00382, both less than the allowable of 0.0045.\nThis means the non-minimum gage wing skins are not designed by strength cases but by buckling\nor flutter constraints.\nFigure 2.128 shows ultimate maximum principal strain for ply one of the spar and rib webs, and\nshows maximum combined stresses for the spar and rib caps in the 2.5G balance maneuver. The\nweb strains and cap stresses are both significantly below the design allowable.\n\n124\n\nFigure 2.129 shows strut and jury max ultimate combined strains for the 2.5G balance maneuver.\nThe figure shows a relatively constant strut strain, with higher values at the jury and at the wing\nend. Peak strain at the wing end is 0.00408, which is below the allowable of 0.0045. The jury\nshows low strains, peaking at a value of 0.00246.\nGround conditions produced peak loads on the landing gear pylon. Figure 2.130 shows maximum\nultimate principal strain, for layer 9, on the gear pylon for the braked roll ground condition. Rear\nspar web regions showing peak strains at the strength allowable include near the gear load\nintroduction location, the bottom section, and at the side-of-body corner. Also, the top of the\npanel supporting the gear side brace is at the allowable. Figure 2.131 shows the gear pylon caps\npeak ultimate combined stress for the critical braked roll condition is well below the allowable.\nFlutter surveys including all modes up to 20 Hz have been completed on all mass cases at Mach\nnumbers of 0.7, 0.76, 0.82, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.94. The surveys show critical instabilities to occur at\nMach = 0.82 for two mass cases, one with full fuel and payload to reach maximum takeoff weight,\nthe second with residual fuel and maximum payload.\nThe Mach trend for the 1.09Vd sized model is shown in Figure 2.132. No speeds are shown at\nMach = 0.90 because no flutter was found at the maximum speed investigated. (The effect of the\naft aerodynamic center shift above M = 0.82 can be seen.) Figure 2.133 and Figure 2.134 show\nthe damping and frequency curves for the critical Mach = 0.82 using the sized 1.09Vd model.\nResults are shown for the full fuel and for residual fuel mass cases. The frequency plots include\nonly the modes that contribute the most to the aeroelastic instability.\nThe results show the optimizer successfully met the flutter constraints of keeping the damping\nless than 0.02 for speeds below 1.09Vd. The full fuel mass case has a positive crossing for a\nsymmetric mode at 2.75Hz. This flutter mode, shown in Figure 2.135, is primarily a coupling of\nbending mode 11 and torsion mode 16, shown in Figure 2.136 and Figure 2.137. The frequencies\nplot shows these modes converging when the damping turns positive. Much of the torsion of\nmode 16 occurs at the engine attachment section of the wing, where the wing is less stiff than a\ntypical cantilevered wing. The flutter mode has significant fore/aft motion but this mode doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\ncontribute to the instability as much as modes 11 and 16.\nThe full fuel mass case also has a positive crossing for an antisymmetric mode at 3.51Hz. This\nflutter mode, shown in Figure 2.138, is primarily a coupling of bending mode 15 and torsion mode\n17. Like the symmetric torsion mode the antisymmetric torsion mode 17 has a lot of torsion\noccurring at the engine attachment section of the wing. Modes 15 and 17 are shown in Figure\n2.139 and Figure 2.140.\nThe residual fuel mass case has two positive symmetric crossings at 2.69Hz and at 2.78Hz. These\nflutter modes, which are shown in Figure 2.141 and Figure 2.142, are primarily a different\n\n125\n\ncombination of bending mode 12, fore/aft mode 14, and torsion mode 16. Modes 12, 14, and 16\nare shown in Figure 2.143, Figure 2.144, and Figure 2.145.\nTable 2.25 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Structure Weight Summary\n\nA\nConfig 1\nNo Flutter\n\nSkins\nSpars\nRibs\nSpar Caps\nRib Caps\nStrut\nJury\nGear Pylon\n2D\nGear Pylon\n3D\nTotal\n\nB\nConfig 1\n1.09 VD\n\nC\nDelta\n(B-A)\n\nD\nConfig 1\n1.15 VD\n\nE\nDelta\n(D-A)\n\nF\nConfig 3\n1.15 VD\n\nG\nDelta\n(F-D)\n\n5,558\n766\n705\n230\n161\n787\n21\n\n5,700\n822\n719\n249\n173\n866\n23\n\n142\n56\n14\n20\n12\n78\n1\n\n5,689\n828\n718\n250\n174\n890\n24\n\n131\n63\n13\n20\n13\n103\n3\n\n5,581\n710\n683\n182\n138\n881\n19\n\n-108\n-118\n-35\n-70\n-37\n-9\n-5\n\n3,415\n\n3,415\n\n0\n\n3,415\n\n0\n\n3,415\n\n0\n\n125\n\n125\n\n0\n\n125\n\n0\n\n125\n\n0\n\n11,768\n\n12,092\n\n323\n\n12,113\n\n346\n\n11,734\n\n-382\n\nUpper\n\nLower\nFigure 2.119 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Upper and Lower Skin Thickness \xe2\x80\x93 Config. 1 1.09Vd\n\n126\n\nFigure 2.120 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Rib and Spar Web Thickness \xe2\x80\x93 Config 1 1.09Vd\n\nFigure 2.121 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Rib and Spar Cap Area \xe2\x80\x93 Config. 1 1.09Vd\n\n127\n\nFigure 2.122 \xe2\x80\x93 Gear Pylon 2D Element Thickness \xe2\x80\x93 Config 1 1.09Vd\n\nFigure 2.123 \xe2\x80\x93 Gear Pylon 1D Element Area \xe2\x80\x93 Config. 1 1.09Vd\n\n128\n\n30\n\n9\nConfig 1\n\nConfig 1\n\nConfig 3 Forward Strut\n\n8\n\nConfig 3 Forward Strut\n\nConfig 3 Aft Strut\n\n25\n\nConfig 3 Aft Strut\n\nConfig 3 Forward + Aft Strut\n\n7\n\n6\n\nJury Box Chord (in)\n\nStrut Box Chord (in)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nWing Station (in)\n\n500\n\n0\n\n600\n\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\n270\n\nWing Z Station (in)\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\nFigure 2.124 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Strut and Jury Chord\n\nSPARS\n\nSKINS\n0.6000\n\n0.6000\n\nConfig 1 Strength Only\nConfig 1 1.09Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 1 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Forward Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Aft Strut,1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\n\n0.5000\n\n0.5000\n\n0.4000\n\nThickness (in)\n\n0.4000\n\nThickness (in)\n\nConfig 1 Strength Only\nConfig 1 1.09Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 1 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Forward Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Aft Strut,1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\n\n0.3000\n\n0.3000\n\n0.2000\n\n0.2000\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1000\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0000\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nWing Station (in)\n\n500\n\n0\n\n600\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n500\n\n400\n\nWing Station (in)\n\n600\n\nFigure 2.125 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Strut Box Skin and Spar Thickness\n\nSPARS\n\nSKINS\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nConfig 1 Strength Only\nConfig 1 1.09Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 1 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Forward Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Aft Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\n\n0.45\n\n0.4\n\nConfig 1 Strength Only\nConfig 1 1.09Vd Flutter Constraints\n\n0.45\n\nConfig 1 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\nConfig 3 Forward Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\n\n0.4\n\nConfig 3 Aft Strut, 1.15Vd Flutter Constraints\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\nThickness (in)\n\nThickness (in)\n\n0.35\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n0\n\n300\n\n200\n\nWing Z Station (in)\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\nWing Z Station (in)\n\nFigure 2.126 \xe2\x80\x93 Sized Jury Box Skin and Spar Thickness\n\n129\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\nUpper\n\nLower\n\nFigure 2.127 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing Upper and Lower Skin Ply 1 Ultimate Principal Strain \xe2\x80\x93 2.5G Balance Maneuver\n\nCap Max Combined\n\nWeb Max Principal Strain Layer 1\n\nFigure 2.128 \xe2\x80\x93 Rib and Spar Maximum Ultimate Stress and Strain 2.5G Balance Maneuver\n\n130\n\nFigure 2.129 \xe2\x80\x93 Strut and Jury Max Ultimate Combined Strain \xe2\x80\x93 2.5G Balance Maneuver\n\n131\n\nMax Principal Strain Layer 9\n\nMin Principal Strain Layer 9\n\nFigure 2.130 \xe2\x80\x93 Gear Pylon Ultimate Layer 9 Principal Strain \xe2\x80\x93 Braked Roll Condition\n\nFigure 2.131 \xe2\x80\x93 Gear Pylon Ultimate Combined Stress \xe2\x80\x93 Braked Roll Condition\n\n132\n\n700\n\n600\n\nSpeed (KEAS)\n\n500\n\n1.09*Vd\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\nCritcal Flutter Speed -

The loads and sized structure inboard\nof the strut both show the benefit of the truss bracing. The CFD-predicted aft shift in aerodynamic\ncenter improved flutter speeds for Mach numbers above 0.82. The loads for the 2.5G and -1G\nbalance maneuvers were larger than those for 1-cos dynamic gusts. Buckling constraints, and\nwhere needed, flutter constraints, sized the wing, strut, and jury. The landing gear pylon was\ncritical for strength requirements for the gear cases. The configuration 1 model sized to pass\n1.09Vd flutter constraints will be the basis for the upcoming aeroelastic wind tunnel test, which\nwill verify the conclusions of this analysis.\n2.1.8.10 Full Scale Resizing Using Wind Tunnel Results\nThe full scale FEMs have been resized using the results from the aeroelastic test summarized in\nSection 3.0. The test showed that the flutter speed varied as loads on the model varied. This nonlinear result has been modeled by including preload and large displacement non-linear effects in\nthe flutter solution. Vehicle design criteria for loads to apply to the flutter analysis aren\xe2\x80\x99t well\ndefined. Negative limit maneuver loads were used to resize the FEM. Transport category negative\nlimit maneuver loads are calculated at -1G up to Vc with a linear variation to 0G at Vd. Loads\ncalculated at Vd were used to check stability up to 1.15Vd.\nThe non-linear flutter method used is described in Section 3.0. To run solution 106 with large\ndisplacements on the full scale FEM, linear elements such as CBARs needed to be removed from\nthe model. Even with most of the linear elements removed solution 106 convergence was slow.\n\n138\n\nNo unsteady aerodynamic weighting factors were used in the resizing because the uncorrected\ndoublet lattice analysis was fairly accurate at predicting test minimum flutter speeds at each\nangle of attack. The critical Mach for minimum flutter speed varied for each angle of attack. The\nflutter analysis used uncorrected doublet lattice aerodynamics at Mach = 0.75 for Vc and below\nand Mach = 0.8 for Vd and above.\nThe flutter solution in Nastran solution 200 uses a linear structures model. The sizing exercise\ninvolved constraining the linear flutter results in solution 200 such that flutter requirements were\nmet when the non-linear preload and large displacement flutter speeds were checked for the\noptimized FEM.\nOptimization was successful in producing a FEM which met all strength, buckling, and non-linear\nflutter constraints. This was done for baseline configuration 1 (Strut attached to front spar) and\nconfiguration 3 (Struts attached to both front and rear spar). Non-linear flutter results for the full\nfuel mass case configuration 1 active constraint antisymmetric mode is shown in Figure 2.146.\nThis flutter mode is at the required 0 g damping at Vc and -1G. The flutter mode becomes more\ndamped in a non-linear way as the load factor is increased from -1G to 0G and +1G. Figure 2.147\nshows the non-linear results for the residual fuel mass case configuration 1 active symmetric\nmode. The mode meets the 0 g requirement at Vd and is less than 0.02 at 1.15Vd. This flutter\nmode shows little variation in damping at Vd for different load factors. Non-linear flutter results\nfor the residual fuel mass case configuration 3 active constraint symmetric mode is shown in\nFigure 2.148. Again, this mode meets the 0 g requirement at Vd and is less than 0.02 at 1.15Vd.\nWeight summaries for the resized FEMs are shown in Table 2.26. The flutter penalty for the\nbaseline configuration has gone from 346 lb pretest to 809 lb including all post-test non-linear\nflutter analysis updates.

In phase II, Boeing provided GE with aircraft thrust requirements and\nfuel burn sensitivities to engine specific fuel consumption, weight and drag for the SUGAR High\naircraft. These thrust requirements and sensitivities were used to generate the updated gFan+,\nand are summarized in Table 2.27.\n\n141\n\nTable 2.27 \xe2\x80\x93 Representative Thrust Requirements and Aircraft Sensitivities\n\nFlight Condition\nTop Of Climb\nTakeoff Boeing Equivalent Thrust\nEngine Parameter =\n1% SFC =\n1,000 lb =\n2.4 lbf Nacelle Drag =\n\nThrust Requirements\n3,200\n14,500\nFuel Burn Sensitivity\n1.1 %\n2.81%\n0.09%\n\nBased on these sensitivities, GE conducted a fan pressure ratio parametric study to gain insight\ninto the aircraft level trades between engine design parameters and center the phase II gFan+\ncycle design. The SFC, weight and drag effects on fuel burn are shown in Figure 2.149 for fan\npressure ratios ranging from 1.35 to 1.55. The data is representative of unique LP spool designs\ncoupled to a rubber core having common thermodynamic characteristics across the spectrum of\npressure ratios.\n\n142\n\nFigure 2.149 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ Fan Pressure Ratio Parametric Study\n\nA fan pressure ratio of 1.46 was selected from the study for the gFan+, sacrificing SFC to realize\na lighter weight, lower drag engine based on Figure 2.150 below. The expected fuel burn benefit\nresulting from the fan pressure ratio parametric, along with a refinement of component\nefficiencies is summarized in Figure 2.151.\nThe resulting gFan+ engine is described in Section 2.2.8.\n\n143\n\nFigure 2.150 \xe2\x80\x93 Fan Pressure Ratio, Fuel Burn Trade\n\nFigure 2.151 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ Fuel Burn Improvement Estimate\n\n2.2\n\nConfiguration Description\n\nThe configuration covered in this description was generated in response to NASA Subsonic Fixed\nWing N+3 design requirements (14) which initiated under a Phase I contract (1). The \xe2\x80\x9cSUGAR\nHigh\xe2\x80\x9d configuration (Model 765-095) represents a single member of a 737 class airplane family,\nthe evolution of which is outlined in Table 2.28. It is a tube and wing configuration with a high\nmounted truss braced wing, twin wing mounted engines, a T-tail empennage, and pylon mounted\nmain landing gear. The 154 passenger dual class fuselage is a 6-abreast seating arrangement, the\nlower lobe is bulk loaded.\nThe configuration description details an uncycled configuration. The final sizing is detailed in\nSection 2.3.3.\n\n144\n\nTable 2.28 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 Revision History\n\nRev.\nNew\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\nDescription of Major Changes\nSUGAR Phase I Exit\nFuselage Refinement, Landing Gear Integration\nWing Planform MDO\nHigh Speed Wing Design\nStrut Planform, Low Speed Wing Design, Engine Pylon Integration\n\nDate\n6/4/2009\n5/2/2011\n11/7/2011\n1/5/2012\n10/8/2012\n\n2.2.1\nIntegration\nThe aircraft general arrangement drawing, configuration walk-around, and principal\ncharacteristics are shown in Figure 2.152, Figure 2.153, and Table 2.29 respectively.

The front spar accommodates a leading edge device chord ratio ranging\nfrom ten percent at the root to fifteen percent at the tip. The trailing edge of the wing is fitted\nwith single slotted flaps extending from the side of body to the wing fold. A small flap segment\nacts as an aileron at high speed. Outboard of the wing fold there is a low speed aileron. Spoilers\nare assumed to cover the entire flapped span with exception of the portion reserved for the high\nspeed aileron. These spoilers are assumed to be drooped for takeoff. The control surface and\nhigh lift system layout is the result of negotiations between low speed aerodynamics and stability\nand control. A drawing of this completed planform is illustrated in Figure 2.155 and the projected\nreference quantities are shown in Table 2.31. It should be noted that the reference quantities are\ndisplayed for a planform with no leading or trailing edge breaks at the side-of-body.

The strut is 18.1 percent thick\nfull span and uses a symmetric airfoil. The strut cross section and support fairings have not been\noptimized and should be considered notional. The strut box is designed to keep the bending axis\nstraight between the three attachment points. The front spar and rear spars are at 14.8 percent\nchord and 70 percent chord respectively. The strut dihedral is 15.09 degrees. The strut corner\npoints are shown in Figure 2.157. The joints for the strut are pinned (axis normal to the bending\naxis) while the jury strut are clamped. A future revision will transition the jury strut to a pinned\nconnection.\n\nFigure 2.157 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR High (765-095 RD) Strut Corner Points\n\nThe jury strut is composed of the same airfoil as the main strut and is installed with 87.44 degrees\nof dihedral (the strut leans outboard in a front view). The strut tie in-chord and wing tie-in chords\nare 11.47 and 14.22 inches respectively. The strut has a linear chord distribution.\n2.2.4\nVertical Fin\nThe vertical tail is arranged similarly to an MD series twin-jet. It is a two spar layout with no taper\nand a two surface simple hinged rudder. The front spar breaks and converges on the rear spar at\nthe vertical tip where the horizontal stabilizer pivot is mounted. The horizontal jack screw\nmechanism is above the front spar. The vertical planform is illustrated in Figure 2.158 and the\nreference planform parameters are shown in Table 2.32.\n\n152\n\n179.9797\n207.0430\n\n387.0226\n207.0430\n\n141.7506\n103.5215\n\n0.0000\n0.0000\n\n207.0430\n0.000\nFigure 2.158 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR High (765-095 RD) Vertical Planform\nTable 2.32 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR High (765-095 RD) Vertical Planform Parameters\n\nParameter\nArea\nAspect Ratio\nSpan\nTaper Ratio\nRoot Chord\nTip Chord\nSweep LE\nSweep 25%\nSweep TE\nMAC\nYbar\nXc/4\n\nUnits\nft\n\n2\n\nin\nin\nin\ndeg\ndeg\ndeg\nin\nin\nin\n\nTotal (Projected)\n297.69\n1.000\n207.0430\n1.000\n207.0430\n207.0430\n41.00\n41.00\n41.00\n207.0430\n103.5215\n141.7506\n\n2.2.5\nHorizontal Stabilizer\nThe horizontal stabilizer has a planform typical of T-tail empennage arrangements and is depicted\nin Figure 2.159.

A summary of\nthe propulsion system key characteristics is provided in Table 2.34\n\n157\n\nFigure 2.164 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ Concept Layout\nTable 2.34 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ Key Characteristics\n\nJP+2035GT+DF\nFan Diameter\nLength\nPropulsion System Weight\nPerformance\nSLS\nTakeoff\nTop of Climb\nCruise\n\n70.6 In\n129 In\n6335 lbm\n\nThrust (lbf)\n21943\n16592\n3931\n3145\n\nSFC\n(lbm/lbf/hr)\n0.220\n0.295\n0.467\n0.455\n\nIn 2012, GE was tasked with designing an Unducted Fan (UDF) architecture for the Truss Braced\nWing airframe. The thrust requirements and corresponding aircraft remain unchanged and can\nbe found in Table 2.27. The additional room under the wing due to the engine\xe2\x80\x99s high mount\nlocation on the fuselage makes it well suited to unducted fan propulsor concepts. The ultra-low\npressure ratio of UDF propulsors enables substantial improvements to propulsive efficiency\nrelative to its ducted counterpart. The counter rotating fans on the UDF run at a nearly constant\nspeed over the course of the mission and necessitate a change to the gFan+ power plant\narchitecture. A second spool was introduced to achieve gFan+ overall pressure ratio levels and\n\n158\n\nto maintain operability at lower power settings. The UDF architecture shares core technologies\nand materials with the gFan+ advanced turbofan. Furthermore, the UDF propulsor diameter of\n144 inches was derived from the LNG+2045GT+SOFC+UDF architecture designed for N+4 studies.\nA conceptual layout of the gFan+ UDF was produced to achieve optimal overall efficiency and is\nshown in Figure 2.165. A summary of the propulsion system key characteristics is provided in\nTable 2.35.\n\nFigure 2.165 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ UDF Concept Layout\nTable 2.35 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan+ UDF Key Characteristics\n\ngFan+ UDF\nFan Diameter\nLength\nPropulsion System Weight\nPerformance\nSLS\nTakeoff\nTop of Climb\nCruise\n\n144 In\n189 In\n8011 lbm\n\nThrust (lbf)\n24809\n16079\n3981\n3181\n\n159\n\nSFC\n(lbm/lbf/hr)\n0.152\n0.239\n0.415\n0.416\n\n2.3\n\nConfiguration Analysis and Final Performance\n\nThis section includes the discipline analyses of the configuration documented in Section 2.2. The\nresults of the analysis are not used in the synthesis of the SUGAR High configuration but would\nbe incorporated in a next configuration cycle.\n2.3.1\n\nAerodynamics\n\nHigh Speed:\nComputer Aided Sizing and\nEvaluation System (CASES) cruise\ndrag bookkeeping is shown in\nFigure 2.166. Parasite drag\nrepresents the incompressible\nzero-lift drag. Induced drag\naccounts for the drag due to lift\nbased on airplane efficiency\nfactor at M=0.50. Compressibility\ndrag is a function of both Mach\nand lift coefficient while trim drag\naccounts for pitching moment on\nthe configuration.\nUsing CASES accounting and\nincorporating the wing-body CFD\nsolutions,\nhigh\nspeed\naerodynamic buildup for the 765095 Rev D is shown in Table 2.36\nand is summarized in Figure 2.167.\n\nFigure 2.166 \xe2\x80\x93 CASES Standard Buildup: CD = CDp + CDi + CDc + CDtrim\n\nIt should be noted that NLF/Riblets does not include the wing NLF benefit. Wing upper surface\nNLF was included in the higher order wing design and bookkept under airplane compressibility\ndrag. Negative Compressibility in the bookkeeping is due to the effect of laminar flow above\nMach 0.50 as illustrated by Figure 2.83.\nThe aerodynamic characteristics reflect the design Mach number of 0.71 for current air traffic\nmanagement integration. The resulting high speed data is shown in Figure 2.168. The figure\nillustrates the maximum aerodynamic efficiency (M*L/D) occurring at the design cruise Mach\n(0.71) and CL (0.75).\n\n160\n\nTable 2.36 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 Rev D High Speed Buildup\n\n-1.5656\n0.3675\n29.5873\n\n0.3675\n28.0194\n\n0.931\n\n0.931\n\n0.71\n0.75\n42000\n0.02003\n0.00981\n-0.00063\n0.00060\n0.02981\n25.159\n17.863\n\n0.71\n0.75\n42000\n\n0.03\n\n-1.39000\n\n0.025\n\n8.6959\n10.1543\n2.8963\n0.2519\n1.8904\n1.7194\n0.0000\n\n0.0405\n3.0872\n-2.4115\n-0.9300\n2.5521\n0.5900\n0.3414\n0.1640\n\n0.01897\n0.00981\n-0.00062\n0.00057\n0.02873\n26.107\n18.536\n\n161\n\nCDtrim\n\nCDc\n\nCDi\n\nCRUISE CD BUILD-UP\nM-CRUISE\nCL-CRUISE\nCRUISE ALTITUDE\nCD0\nCDI\nCDC\nCDTRIM\nCDTOT\nL/D\nM L/D\n\nCDo\n\n0\n\nE-VISC\n\n8.6959\n10.1543\n2.8963\n0.2519\n1.8904\n1.7194\n1.9020\n0.0405\n3.0872\n-2.4115\n-1.1814\n2.6450\n0.5900\n0.3414\n0.1640\n\n0.02\n\nF BUILD-UP (FT2)\nFUSELAGE\nWING\nSTRUT / JURY\nFLAP SUPPORT\nHORIZONTAL\nVERTICAL\nN&P\nCANOPY\nGEAR PODS\nNLF\nRIBLETS\nEXCRESCENCE\nSTRUTS CDC\nUPSWEEP\nWING TWIST\nTURBULENT CDC\nINCREMENT\nFUSELAGE BUMP\nF-TOTAL (FT2)\n\n1477\n12.58\n0.154\nSUPERCRIT.

It can\nanalyze missions of varying complexity and has been validated to actual airplane performance. It\nhas the capability to model complex tracks with enroute and alternate waypoints and complex\nprofiles with multiple cruise segments including step and cruise climbs. It will calculate airplane\nperformance including redispatch, through-stop, radius, and extended-range twin-engine\noperations (ETOPS) capability.\nUse of the Low Speed Performance System (LSPS) provides field length analysis. LSPS can\ncalculate takeoff performance at any specified atmospheric condition (altitude and temperature\nwithin its atmospheric model) and includes One Engine Inoperative (OEI) in its calculations. Like\nBMAP, it is calibrated to existing commercial airplanes.\n\n165\n\nVehicle performance and sizing is performed with Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s Aircraft Design Navigator (ADNav)\nwhich encapsulates both mission performance (BMAP) and airfield performance calculations\n(LSPS). It provides the capability to scale engine thrust and wing area and provides the ability to\nsize airplanes to their optimum sizes given a set of constraints (such as TOFL, ICAC, time and\ndistance to climb, etc.). It also provides some data visualization tools.

These top level requirements were turned into specific\npayload-range requirements which are illustrated in Figure 2.173. The figure has several points\nof interest called out.\n1. The airplane is required to fly the average range at max payload (also maximum zero fuel\nweight). Max payload is required to be 15,200 pounds heavier than the payload from\npoint 2. The range required is 900 nm.\n2. The airplane is required to fly the maximum range at the average number of seats using\n200 pounds per passenger and no revenue payload. This point must be achieved using\nless than 90% of the useable fuel. The range required is 3,500 nm.\n3. This point will be used to calculate vehicle fuel burn performance and TOFL performance\nfor the SUGAR program. This represents the point that represents how an operator would\nmost commonly operate the vehicle class. This point is evaluated at a range of 900nm.\n\n166\n\nMax Zero Fuel Weight\n1\n\nLow Density Payload\n2\n\nAverage Range\n\nMaximum Range\n\nPayload\n\n3\n\nRange\n\nFigure 2.173 \xe2\x80\x93 Payload-Range Requirements\n\nBoth point 1 and 2 are required for sizing because airplane characteristics may change which\npoint is critical. The mission profile for SUGAR 2035 concepts is shown in Figure 2.174. SUGAR\nHigh and Refined SUGAR are evaluated to the illustrated mission while SUGAR Free is flown with\na non-advanced air traffic management system. These missions are further documented in Phase\nI (1).\n\n200 nm\n\nFlight Time & Fuel\nBlock Time & Fuel\n\nFigure 2.174 \xe2\x80\x93 2030 Mission Profile with NextGen Air Traffic Management\n\n167\n\n10 Minute Hold @ 1,500 ft\n\nApproach & Land (4 Minutes)\n\nDescend to 1,500 ft\n\nCruise at LRC Mach\n\nEconomy Climb\n\nMissed Approach\n\n3% Flight Fuel Allowance\n\nApproach and Land (4 Minutes)\n\nStill Air Range\n\nTaxi In (4 Minutes \xe2\x80\x93 From Reserves)\n\nReserves\n\nDescend to 1,500 ft at Optimum\n\nClimbing Cruise\n\nOptimized Climb to Cruse\n\nClimbout and Accelerate to 1,500 ft at Optimum Speed\n\nTakeoff to 35 ft\n\nTaxi Out (4 Minutes)\n\nMission\n\n2.3.3.2\nSizing Results\nThe performance of the SUGAR High configuration is shown in Table 2.38. There are several\ndifferent sizing cases shown; working from left to right, the first two columns (ducted and\nunducted configurations) are referred to as As-Drawn meaning the performance was run at the\nreference wing area, thrust, and MTOW used to generate the underlying vehicle data. In this\ncase, the thrust, wing area, and MTOW are higher than the mission requires. The next set of\ncolumns, which show a 5 and 10 percent fuel burn reduction for the Ducted and Unducted\nconfigurations respectively, is sized data for minimum fuel burn constrained by takeoff field\nlength. The remaining two columns are sized with takeoff field length (inactive) and initial cruise\naltitude capability (ICAC) (active) constraints. The ICAC constraint requires the aircraft be able to\nclimb to the altitude yielding best specific range (its optimum altitude). This constrained\nconfiguration shows a 0.7 and 1 percent increase in fuel burn relative to the ICAC unconstrained\nconfigurations. The ICAC constrained configurations are shown for all additional performance\nanalysis.\nThe performance of the airplane is shown relative to the SUGAR Free baseline (configuration 765093) in Table 2.39. This shows a 53.6 and 56 percent reduction for the SUGAR High and SUGAR\nHigh UDF respectively.\nBMAP was exercised at various combinations of fuel and payload weights to generate a payloadrange curve shown in Figure 2.175. This curve shows that the unducted fan variant does not meet\nthe stated range requirements at the maximum payload condition with only 783 nautical miles\nof range. The airplane was not resized in an effort to maintain sizing criteria for consistency with\nthe ducted fan airplane. The flat upper portion of the curve (at 46,000 lb. payload) represents\nthe maximum zero fuel weight constraint of the airplane. The shallow sloped portion of the curve\nis set by Breguet range and the Maximum Takeoff Weight. The final region of the chart is set by\nthe airplanes fuel volume limit.\n\n168\n\nTable 2.38 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 Rev D Mission Performance\n\n154 / DUAL\n137,400\n136,800\n128,800\n82,800\n3,917 / 4,427\ngFan+2 UDF\n123\n17,600\n1,248 / 156\n19.56\n0.783\n25.135\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n37,600\n\n765-095-RD\nDucted Fan\nICAC\nConstraint\n154 / DUAL\n138,300\n135,700\n135,700\n81,700\n4,213 / 4,212\ngFan+2\n66\n19,400\n1,195 / 153\n19.56\n0.759\n23.995\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n37,700\n\n765-095-RD\nUDF\nICAC\nConstraint\n154 / DUAL\n130,000\n137,000\n137,000\n83,000\n3,968 / 4,145\ngFan+2 UDF\n126\n18,500\n1,178 / 152\n19.56\n0.785\n24.741\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n38,200\n\n27 / 170\n\n33 / 206\n\n23 / 147\n\n29 / 181\n\n37,400\n43,500\n8,200\n108\n42.16\n\n39,500\n44,100\n8,190\n107\n39.93\n\n37,700\n43,000\n7,680\n109\n42.46\n\n38,200\n42,800\n8,180\n111\n40.30\n\nModel\nSizing Level\n\n765-095-RD\nDucted Fan\nAs-Drawn\n\n765-095-RD\nUDF\nAs-Drawn\n\n765-095-RD\nDucted Fan\nMin Fuel\n\n765-095-RD\nUDF\nMin Fuel\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ / AVIL\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVALENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nTHRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\n\n154 / DUAL\n150,000\n141,300\n133,300\n87,300\n5,154 / 5,416\ngFan+2\n71\n23,000\n1,478 / 170\n19.56\n0.766\n25.249\n4,260\n0.70\n0.70\n40,400\n\n154 / DUAL\n150,000\n144,900\n136,900\n90,900\n4,604 / 5,416\ngFan+2 UDF\n144\n24,000\n1,478 / 170\n19.56\n0.797\n25.936\n3,850\n0.70\n0.70\n42,300\n\n154 / DUAL\n137,200\n134,900\n126,900\n80,900\n4,172 / 4,272\ngFan+2\n64\n18,200\n1,210 / 154\n19.56\n0.729\n24.117\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n36,500\n\n19 / 119\n\n20 / 122\n\n40,800\n45,800\n5,990\n100\n44.44\n\n41,500\n45,700\n5,530\n101\n43.86\n\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\nIN\nLB\n2\nFT / FT\n\nNMI\n\nFT\nMIN /\nNMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\nLB\n\n169\n\nTable 2.39 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 Rev D Mission Performance Comparison\n\n154 / DUAL\n182,600\n149,400\n140,400\n94,400\n9,633 / 9,633\nCFM56-7B27\n62\n27,900\n1,406 / 121\n10.41\n0.584\n17.997\n3,680\n0.79\n0.79\n36,200\n\n765-095-RD\nDucted Fan\nICAC\nConstraint\n154 / DUAL\n138,300\n135,700\n135,700\n81,700\n4,213 / 4,212\ngFan+2\n66\n19,400\n1,195 / 153\n19.56\n0.759\n23.995\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n37,700\n\n765-095-RD\nUDF\nICAC\nConstraint\n154 / DUAL\n130,000\n137,000\n137,000\n83,000\n3,968 / 4,145\ngFan+2 UDF\n126\n18,500\n1,178 / 152\n19.56\n0.785\n24.741\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n38,200\n\n23 / 148\n\n23 / 147\n\n29 / 181\n\n34,900\n36,200\n8,190\n126\n91.51\n(Base)\n\n37,700\n43,000\n7,680\n109\n42.46\n(-53.6%)\n\n38,200\n42,800\n8,180\n111\n40.30\n(-56.0%)\n\nModel\nSizing Level\n\n765-093\nSUGAR Free\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ / AVIL\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVALENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nTHRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\nIN\nLB\n2\nFT / FT\n\nNMI\n\nFT\nMIN /\nNMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\nLB\n\n170\n\n50\n45\n40\n\nPayload ~ 1,000 lb\n\n35\nFull Passenger Payload\n\n30\n25\n\n765-095-RD UDF\n\n20\n15\n\n765-095-RD\n\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nStill Air Range ~ 1,000 nmi\nFigure 2.175 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 Sized Payload-Range Curve\n\nBlock Fuel for each configuration is compared to the SUGAR Free.

It is recognized that longitudinal analysis is also required to\nevaluate horizontal tail size and balance the airplane. A wing shift to balance the airplane is most\nlikely necessary, but lateral/directional analysis was deemed to be higher priority. The airplane\ncan be balanced in the next program phase, if additional low speed (slats and flaps extended)\naerodynamic data become available.\nDirectional control analysis focused on engine out minimum control speed (VMC). Both a VMCG onground analysis and a one degree of freedom analysis of VMC in air were performed. Engine data\nused were from the GE gFan+ ducted fan. Airplane geometry was for the baseline as-drawn 765095-RD ducted fan configuration. Vertical tail aerodynamic data were based on the MD-80\naerodynamics model adjusted to 765-095 geometry (tail arm, tail area, wing span, and wing\narea). Conditions analyzed were for the 25 deg takeoff flap setting and angles-of-attack of 0.75\ndeg for VMCG and 8.4 deg for VMC. Table 2.42 summarizes the results of the analysis against FAR\nPart 25 airspeed requirements.\n\n174\n\nTable 2.42 \xe2\x80\x93 Engine Out Minimum Control Speed Results\n\nFAR Part\n\nRequirement\n\nSpeed\n(KEAS)\n25.149(e)\nEngine Out Minimum Control Speed Ground (VMCG)\n94.6\n25.149(b)\nEngine Out Minimum Control Speed (VMC)\n99.9\n25.149(f)\nEngine Out Minimum Control Speed Landing (VMCL)\nNot\nEvaluated\n25.107(a)(1)\nEngine Failure Speed (VEF) may not be less than VMCG\n120\n25.107(b)(3)\nEngine Out Climb Speed (V2) may not be less than 1.10 126\ntimes VMC\n25.107(e)(1)(ii)\nRotation Speed (VR) may not be less than 105 percent of 122\nVMC\n25.149(c)\nVMC may not exceed 1.13 VSR (Reference Stall Speed)\n81.5\n25.125(b)(2)(i)(B) VREF (Reference Landing Speed) may not be less than VMCL 100\nMost airspeed requirements are met, as indicated by the green color coding in the table.\nUnfortunately, the FAR part 25.149(c) requirement that VMC not exceed 1.13 VSR is not met. The\nstall speed used for takeoff analysis was 81.5 KEAS and 1.13 VSR is 92.1 KEAS. The VMC of 99.9\nKEAS exceeds this value. There are two potential ways to solve this problem. Either the takeoff\nspeeds need to be recalculated using a VSR of 88.5 KEAS (VMC/1.13), with resulting increases in\ntakeoff distance, or directional control authority needs to be increased. Increasing directional\ncontrol authority can be achieved by increasing the vertical tail area or by changing to a double\nhinged rudder design. Increasing vertical tail area may have a negative impact on crosswind\nlanding capability and will increase the weight of the airplane. A double hinged rudder design is\nmore complex and heavier than the current single hinged rudder. It is recommended that during\nthe next phase of the program, takeoff field length be re-evaluated using higher takeoff speeds\nto see if field length requirements can still be met.\nVMCL with landing flap setting was not evaluated, but is not expected to be very much different\nfrom VMC with takeoff flap setting. Assuming VMCL is the same as VMC, the FAR Part\n25.125(b)(2)(i)(B) requirement that landing speed (VREF) not be less than VMCL is barely met. This\nrequirement should be re-evaluated in the next program phase when better aerodynamic data\nare available.\nLateral control analysis focused on maximum steady state roll rate and time-to-bank 30 degrees.\nThese analyses were performed with slats and flaps retracted because required low speed\naerodynamic data was not available for the configuration. The effects of wing bending\naeroelastics were investigated as part of this evaluation and were generated from the NASTRAN\n\n175\n\nFEM model. Roll moment of inertia also came from the FEM model for a full wing fuel state (high\ninertia).\nAerodynamic predictions were made using the Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) code (15). 20 degrees\nwas chosen as the maximum inboard and outboard aileron control surface deflections. Due to\nactuator hinge moment limiting at high speeds, data for similar airplanes show that available\ncontrol surface deflection would be about \xc2\xbd the full range of deflection. The full aileron\ndeflection for 765-095-RD was assumed to be 40 degrees. Because vortex lattice over-predicts\ncontrol surface effectiveness, equivalent deflections were run based on aerodynamic data and\nAVL analysis from X-48C. For the inboard aileron, 14.2 deg of equivalent AVL deflection was\ncalculated to produce the same rolling moment as 20 deg real world deflection. For the outboard\naileron, 15.2 deg of equivalent AVL deflection produced the same rolling moment as 20 deg of\nphysical deflection.\nBecause vortex lattice is not capable of predicting spoiler control effectiveness, MD-80 spoiler\ndata were used. It was assumed that spoilers could deflect to their maximum angle of 60 degrees.\nNo adjustments were made for spoiler area or span extent. This is partly due to the spoiler\narrangement of 765-095-RD being considered notional. Inspection of 3-view drawings showed\nthat the MD-80 spoiler arrangement has much less span extent and area than the currently drawn\nspoilers on 765-095-RD. Using the MD-80 spoiler effectiveness data should, therefore, be\nconservative and represent a lower bound on roll performance.\nRequirements for steady state roll rate are documented in previous NASA studies (16). The steady\nstate roll rate of 765-095-RD was evaluated for the inboard ailerons, outboard ailerons, and\nspoilers individually. Groupings of inboard ailerons and spoilers; and inboard ailerons, outboard\nailerons, and spoilers were also investigated. Results are plotted in percentage (100% satisfies)\nof requirement in Figure 2.179.\nThe outboard ailerons, inboard ailerons, or spoilers, by themselves, cannot meet the steady state\nroll rate requirements. The low speed aileron reverses at some high Mach high dynamic pressure\ncases; the presumption is that outboard aileron would be locked out in those cases. Spoilers, by\nthemselves, provide almost enough roll rate, but fail to meet the requirements at low dynamic\npressures. Spoilers combined with either inboard ailerons, or both inboard and outboard ailerons\nmeet all roll rate requirements.\nRequirements for time-to-bank 30 degrees are documented (16) in previous NASA studies. The\ntime-to-bank 30 deg of 765-095-RD was evaluated using a one degree of freedom roll simulation.\nEvaluations were performed for the inboard ailerons, outboard ailerons, and spoilers individually.\nGroupings of inboard ailerons and spoilers; and inboard ailerons, outboard ailerons, and spoilers\nwere also investigated. The results are also illustrated in Figure 2.179.\n\n176\n\nMach 0.82\n\n200%\n\n0.76\n\nInboard Aileron and Spoiler Only Unless Noted\n\nMargin from Requirement\n\n0.70\n\nRoll Rate\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\nTime to Bank\n\n50%\n\n0.82\n0.76\n0.70\n\n0%\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\n300\nDynamic Pressure (lb/ft2)\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFigure 2.179 \xe2\x80\x93 Maximum Steady State Roll Rate and Time to Bank vs. Requirements\n\nLike the roll rate requirement, outboard ailerons, inboard ailerons, or spoilers, by themselves,\ncannot meet the time-to-bank requirements. The cases for outboard ailerons at high dynamic\npressure have aileron reversal. Spoilers, by themselves, provide almost enough control power,\nbut fail to meet the requirements at low dynamic pressures. Spoilers combined with inboard\nailerons, almost meet the requirements, but fail at the lowest Mach and dynamic pressure. Only\nspoilers combined with both inboard and outboard ailerons meet all time-to-bank 30 degree\nrequirements. This justifies the inclusion of all of these control surfaces on the airplane.\nAeroelastics on the high aspect ratio wing do not seem to limit the ability to meet the roll\nrequirements.\n\n2.4\n\nTechnology Plans and Roadmaps\n\nThe team has updated some of the technology plans that were developed in Phase I.

For the\npurposes of this roadmap the technology is limited to the on-aircraft components only. Overall\nthese new concepts will impact every phase of flight in some way. For example, increased\nsituational awareness of other aircraft will allow for reduced taxi times. Better aircraft positioning\ndata and route planning will allow for a more fuel optimized climb and reduced separation\nrequirements. Improved collision avoidance will enable optimal climb and cruise climb\ntrajectories. Better weather detection means that pilots can optimize their route in flight to find\nthe compromise in avoiding the weather while still retaining a fuel efficient trajectory.

Details of the\ntest are documented in Volume III of this report. The basis for this test was the detailed FEM\nsizing/optimization performed in Task 2.1 (Section 2.0). This task produced a detailed FEM which\nmet all strength, buckling, and flutter constraints. The results showed significant structural\nweight benefits of a truss-braced wing with minimal weight penalty to pass flutter.\nThe primary goal of the aeroelastic wind tunnel task was to validate the flutter results. The\nsecondary goal was to investigate benefits of closed loop flutter suppression control laws. For\nassessing flutter suppression, the objective was to quantify the flutter speed increases and\ninvestigate control law effect on gust loads.\nThe Task 2.1 model chosen for the wind tunnel test is the configuration which has the strut\nattached at the front spar and sized with 1.09 Vd flutter constraints. The 1.09 Vd model is slightly\nsofter than the full flutter margin 1.15 Vd model and therefore would facilitate the\ndemonstration of aeroelastic instabilities in the tunnel. The V strut configuration which has a\nstrut attached to the wing front spar and another strut attached to the rear spar showed the\nmost structural weight benefit. This configuration wasn\xe2\x80\x99t chosen for the test due to concerns\nabout drag and aerodynamic interference of the extra strut. Validating the flutter results for the\nfront spar configuration should validate the flutter results on the V strut configuration since both\nanalyses use the same methods.\nThe test was performed on a dynamically scaled half model in R134 heavy gas. Dynamically scaled\ncomponents include the wing, strut, and jury strut. Nearly rigid components include the fuselage,\nflow through nacelle, and engine pylon. The model was fixed on the electronic turn table which\nallowed angle of attack to vary. The model was tested open loop and closed loop using a\nhydraulically actuated inboard and outboard control surface. The model was instrumented with\n22 accelerometers, 10 strain gages and 2 RVDT\xe2\x80\x99s to measure control surface deflection. Testing\nwas carried out between Mach =.6 to M=.94 for angles of attack from -3 to 5 degrees.\n\n3.1\n\nDynamic Scale Factors and Requirements\n\nThe test was a dynamically scaled aeroelastic side mounted half span model tested in R134 heavy\ngas at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) 16-by-16 foot transonic wind tunnel located at the\nLangley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.\nWhen building a dynamic scaled wind tunnel model (WTM), several pieces of full scale aircraft\ninformation must be generated and transmitted to the model vendor. Those items are aircraft\ngeometry, mass, stiffness and the scaling factors.\n\n214\n\nThe model basic scale factors (length, density, and velocity) were selected to balance several\nconsiderations including TDT operating envelope, TDT test section size, and model\nmanufacturability. All other scale factors are derived from the three basic scale factors. Scale\nfactors for the test are shown in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Scale Factors\n\nBasic Scale Factors\n\nDerived Scale Factors\n\nLength\n\nDensity\n\nMass\n\nAccel\n\nForce\n\nStiffness\n\n0.150\n\n1.1000\n\n0.003713\n\n1.8103\n\n0.006721\n\n1.5122E4\n\nVelocit\ny\n\nLinear\n\nRotation\nal\n\n0.5211\n\n0.04481\n\n0.001008\n\nMoment\nof Inertia\n8.3531e5\n\nFull Scale Half Span\nModel Scale Half\nSpan\n\nWeight\n(lb)\n29,530\n109.6\n\nSpan\n(ft)\n85\n\nFrequenc\ny\n3.4740\n\nTime\n\nDyn.\nPress.\n\n0.2879\n\n0.2987\n\nDyn.

The FEM was developed for calculating structural loads and performing\nstructural design, and is based on the Outer Mold Lines (OMLs) defined by the aerodynamics\ngroup. The target (baseline) equivalent beam stiffnesses were calculated to match the stiffness\ndistributions of the detailed FEM model. Equivalent beam full scale wing, strut and jury stiffness\nfor scaling are shown in Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.3. The figures also show the elastic axis\nlocation of the equivalent beams.\nThe mass of the wing is broken up into 19 sections as shown in Figure 3.4. The inboard control\nsurface was broken up into 4 sections and the outboard control surface has 6 sections. The\nweight, C.G. and inertia for each section matching the full fuel mass case are listed in Table 3.2.\nIn order to meet the stiffness requirements for the strut & jury strut, the target scaled weight\ncould not be met. So, an estimate of the model beam\xe2\x80\x99s weights (strut & jury strut) was scaled to\nfull size thus requiring about 1,490 pounds to be added to the detailed FEM. The additional strut\nand jury strut mass was shown to have negligible impact on flutter results.\nThe goal of the analysis was to make a beam-rod FEM to become the \xe2\x80\x9cas built\xe2\x80\x9d analytical model\nof the WTM. This analytical model would be used in all aspects of aeroelastic analyses to verify\n\n215\n\nthat the model was safe to operate in the wind tunnel. The first step in achieving this goal was to\ncreate a full scale beam-rod FEM using the mass and stiffness that was presented in the previous\nsection. A comparison of the full scale Detailed FEM and the Beam-Rod FEM is shown Figure 3.5.\nFlutter results of these two full scale FEMs are shown in Figure 3.6; the Beam-Rod results match\nthe Detailed FEM very well.\nThe second step toward achieving an \xe2\x80\x9cas built\xe2\x80\x9d analytical model, was accomplished by applying\nthe scaling factors to the full scale model thus \xe2\x80\x9cshrinking it\xe2\x80\x9d to the same size as the WTM.\nCoordinating with the model vendor to determine what changes were achievable and match\nwhat was manufactured was critical. The \xe2\x80\x9cas built\xe2\x80\x9d FEM was updated as the design matured.\nAnalysis was conducted throughout the model construction time period and updates to the \xe2\x80\x9cas\nbuilt\xe2\x80\x9d FEM were being made.\nThe SUGAR WTM was attached to the Oscillating Turntable (OTT) mount residing on the east wall\nof the TDT test section. A beam-rod FEM of the OTT was provided by NASA so it could be\nincorporated into the analysis. Wind tunnel boundary conditions have been studied to try and\nkeep similitude with the free flying vehicle symmetric flutter mechanism. A comparison of flutter\nresults for the free-free detailed FEM and half model of the detailed FEM with the wind tunnel\nboundary conditions are shown in Figure 3.7. Flutter speeds have changed but the flutter\nmechanism is still a combination of the same primary modes. Also, as shown in Figure 3.8, the\nwind tunnel boundary conditions cause a small change in primary mode shapes but the modes\nare similar to the free-free modes. The z deflection for the plots is the average front and rear spar\ndeflection. The torsional slope is the difference between the z defection at the front spar and\nrear spar divided by the x distance between the spars. Since we have good similitude with the\nfixed boundary conditions we were able to simplify the test versus a free flying model or a pitch\nand plunge free arrangement.\n\n216\n\nFigure 3.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Full Scale Wing Stiffness\nSUGAR -

First, as shown in Figure 3.9 tunnel integration concerns required a fuselage length\nreduction from 18.7 ft to 13.4 ft. This change had no appreciable effect on the flutter results. The\nengine/nacelle position was moved 12.5 inches aft and 5 inches down during the full scale vehicle\ndevelopment. The tested position is a more realistic position for the engine/pylon. This difference\ndid change the flutter solution but didn\xe2\x80\x99t change the primary flutter mechanism. Finally, as the\ntest analysis model was updated to the as built mass distribution the unstable flutter damping\ndecreased to the point where it might not be larger than the inherent structural damping.\nTherefore, as shown in Figure 3.10, six ballast weights of just under 3 pounds were added to aft\nsection of the main spar. The ballast weights brought the flutter damping back to an acceptable\nlevel. The ballast weight for each station is tabulated in Table 3.3.\nTable 3.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Model Ballast Weights\n\n221\n\nFigure 3.9 \xe2\x80\x93 Fuselage Length Reduction\n\nFigure 3.10 \xe2\x80\x93 Flutter Ballast Weights\n\n3.2\n\nModel Design and Analysis\n\nThe main features of the model are shown in Figure 3.11. The model features the cruciform wing\nand strut beam, H section jury beam, rigid fuselage, flow through nacelle, and 2 actively\n\n222\n\ncontrolled trailing edge surfaces. The model uses a classical flutter model construction approach,\nwhere a single internal beam represents the entire stiffness composition of a wing or strut\nmember, and segmented skins are used for an aerodynamic fairing that does not contribute\nadditional stiffness. The process used to develop equivalent beam cross sections to meet the\nstiffness requirements is shown in Figure 3.12. The large span wing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be machined as a\nsingle piece, so there are two wing beams with a joint in the middle. Stiffness requirements were\nmet for the wing, strut, and jury. Mass requirements were met for the wing. Based on classic\nflutter model construction, model strut and jury mass estimates exceed scaled requirements.\nHowever, the extra mass was shown to be inconsequential to flutter results and acceptable for\ntest.\nSide-wall\nMounted\nRigid Fuselage\n\n2 Active\nSurfaces\nCruciform Wing\nBeam\nCruciform\nStrut\n\nFlow-Thru\nNacelle\n\nH-Section Jury\nBeam\n\nFigure 3.11 \xe2\x80\x93 Wind Tunnel Model Overview\n\nScaled Stiffness Targets \xef\x83\xa0\n\n\xef\x83\xa0\n\nSection Solver\n\nInitial CAD Layout\n\nBoeing SUGAR - Cruciform Cross-Section Solver\nCenter Block\nSide Blocks\nVariables\n2A\n2B\n2a\n2b\n[in]\n0.817\n0.382\n0.214\n0.101\n\nCurrent\nSection\nProperties\n\nout-plane\n\nin-plane\n\ntorque\n\n[in]\n\nEI11\n\nEI22\n\n2.86E+06\n\n1.55E+08\n\n3.40E+06\n\n3.15E+06\n\n1.35E+08\n\n3.40E+06\n\n3.51E+06\n\n6.83E+07\n\n3.40E+06\n\n3.38E+06\n\n6.76E+07\n\n3.40E+06\n\nIipz\n[in^4]\n0.029\n\nJ\n[in^4]\n0.0114\n\nYna\n[in]\nNA\n\nIopx\n[in^4]\n\nIipz\n[in^4]\n\nJ\n[in^4]\n\n0.0039\n\n0.0293\n\n0.0115\n\nSection\nProperty\nError\nError %\n\nTotal\n[in]\n-9.7619E-08\n-3.0\n\nIopx\n[in^4]\n-0.00004\n-1.00\n\nIipz\n[in^4]\n-0.00029\n-1.00\n\nJ\n[in^4]\n-0.000115\n-1.00\n\nSolver Constraints\nDescription\nVariable\nV > Than\nTotal Height [in]\nHtot\n0.375\nTotal Width [in]\nWtot\n0.500\nSide Block Width [in]\nWsb\n0.125\nTsb\n0.100\nSide Block Thickness [in]\n\nV < Than\n0.825\n9.000\n6.000\n0.101\n\nGJ\n\n1.875\n5.636\n11.134\n18.344\n25.541\n32.823\n\nIopx\n[in^4]\n0.0038\n\nTarget\nSection\nProperties\n\nY-location\n\nYna\n[in]\nNA\n\n3.28E+06\n\n5.75E+07\n\n3.40E+06\n\n3.16E+06\n\n5.30E+07\n\n3.40E+06\n\nOut-plane error [%]\nIn-plane error [%]\nTorsional error [%]\n\nIopx\nIipz\nJ\n\n0.99\n0.99\n0.99\n\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\n\nFigure 3.12 \xe2\x80\x93 Equivalent Beam Design\n\nActuator system design (Figure 3.13) was based on a successful system used for a number of\nactively controlled flutter models, including the Boeing joined-wing sensorcraft free-flying model,\n\n223\n\nand consisted of a high flow Moog servovalve, a custom designed hydraulic actuator, a coupler,\nand a RDVT sensor. Large hinge moment and high bandwidth requirements for flutter\nsuppression were challenges for the control system design. The coupler wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to fit within\nthe OML so a small cutout in the skin was made for its accommodation.\n\nFigure 3.13 \xe2\x80\x93 Control System Design\n\nThe mounting structure attaches to the electronic turn table and wing spar and strut as shown in\nFigure 3.14. A summary of the model instrumentation which included 22 accelerometers, 10\nstrain gages, and 2 RVDT\xe2\x80\x99s is shown in Figure 3.15. The model was designed to have the NASA\nmodel systems criteria required safety margin for the five design conditions shown in Figure 3.16.\nSide view from east wall\nWing\nSpar\nETT\nFlange\n\nStrut\nSpar\n\nFigure 3.14 \xe2\x80\x93 Wind Tunnel Model Mounting Structure\n\n224\n\nFigure 3.15 \xe2\x80\x93 Instrumentation Summary\n\nFigure 3.16 \xe2\x80\x93 Critical Load Cases\n\n225\n\nValidation testing included actuator characterization, coupling strength strain gage calibration,\nmass properties verification, and GVTs. Actuator characterization involved recording the control\nsurface position as it was commanded to sweep through a range of frequencies. Results showed\nactuator performance was adequate for flutter suppression control laws. A test was completed\nto determine hinge moment capability of the coupler, as spatial constraints forced the selection\nof an undersized component. The coupler hinge moment capability is lower than the actuator\nand close to some conservatively derived maximum hinge moment requirements. Strain gages\nwere calibrated by recording values with a known applied load, and correlation with the finite\nelement analysis result of each test case. The same loads were applied at a few times during\ntesting to make sure individual strains remained consistent. The model was weighed to make\nsure it matched the analysis model. GVTs were conducted in the model prep area, and in the\ntunnel with and without skin tape. There were also multiple GVTs over the course of the test to\nverify that the model behavior was consistent. A comparison of the GVT results to the analysis\nmodel is documented in Section 3.6.\n\n3.3\n\nDynamic Aeroelastic State Space Model\n\nThe current process for state space model construction takes the analysis modes and unsteady\ndoublet lattice aerodynamics and generates a dynamic aeroelastic which is used to develop\ncontrol laws. Unsteady aerodynamics is represented by a P-transform method in the time domain\nrequiring no additional aero states. Multiple models were generated as the analysis FEM\nmatured. Final models were based on FEM19 which was used to generate the tested control laws.\nModels included 40 states for 20 flexible modes up to 100 Hz. Models contain outputs at all\naccelerometer locations consisting of displacement, rate, and acceleration in all three coordinate\ndirections and rotational displacement and rate about all three coordinate directions. Models\ncontain inputs consisting of the inboard and outboard wing trailing edge control surface\ndeflection, rate, and acceleration to accommodate coupling actuator dynamics. Final FEM19\nmodels include 13 dynamic pressures at Mach = 0.75 and two dynamic pressures at Mach = 0.6,\n0.65, and 0.7\n\n3.4\n\nControl Law Design\n\nThe following sections document the development of the control laws for the TBW TDT wind\ntunnel test.\n3.4.1\nOverview\nTwo separate control law designs were developed and tested closed-loop at the TDT. The first\ndesign was developed for a pair of System Identification (SysID) models of the TBW model. The\nSysID models were derived from control surface sweeps performed in open-loop testing. The\nsecond control law was designed for the FEM19 State Space Model (SSM) dynamics. Both control\nlaw designs were based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) design techniques with a Kalman\n\n226\n\nFilter state estimator. Both sets of control laws are actually comprised of several point designs (2\nSysID models and 18 SSMs) and employ a \xe2\x80\x9cnearest neighbor\xe2\x80\x9d algorithm based on Mach and\ndynamic pressure (Q) to perform \xe2\x80\x9cgain scheduling\xe2\x80\x9d. Figure 3.17 shows where the various models\n(SysID and SSMs) were defined in relation to the pre-holiday flutter boundaries. Both designs\nproved to be robust to variations in Mach, Q, and angle of attack (AOA).\n\nFigure 3.17 \xe2\x80\x93 Model Definition Points\n\n3.4.2\nSystem Identification Model Development\nThe SysID methods employed to derive the two models were based on methods developed\npreviously for the Aerodynamic Efficiency Improvement program. The SysID method uses an\noptimizer to tune the simulation model to match the test data collected in the control surface\nsweeps. The derived models were based on open-loop control surface sweeps at Mach 0.65, Q\n53.9 psf (TDT Run 10, Tab Points 529 and 530) and Mach 0.7, Q 61.6 psf (Run 10, Tab Points 551\nand 552). All of the sweeps were performed at an AOA of -3\xc2\xb0. The FEM19 SSMs were used as a\n\n227\n\nstarting point in the process. The up side to the SysID modeling is that if the process converges\nto a solution, you have a high degree of confidence in the model. The down sides to this approach\nto model generation are the necessity for open-loop control surface sweeps and the large\namount of memory and processor capacity required. Each of these models took over a day to\ngenerate, even given the fairly accurate starting point. The original plan for the TDT tests was to\nforgo the SysID step in order to save time and just use the FEM models for designing the\ncontroller. The variation in the TBW model\xe2\x80\x99s GVT data from pre-holiday to post-holiday provided\nboth more time to develop the SysID models and the desire to make sure more wind tunnel time\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost tuning the controller once testing began.\nA comparison of the SysID model\xe2\x80\x99s mode frequencies and damping is shown in Table 3.4. Figure\n3.18 shows a comparison of the Mach 0.65 SysID model to its FEM19 SSM counterpart for the\ninboard control surface to the outboard wing tip (forward) accelerometer (Z axis). In general, the\nSysID and FEM19 models agree fairly well, but the FEM19 models tend to be more attenuated in\nthe 5 to 10 Hz range.\n\n228\n\nTable 3.4 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID to FEM19 Model Comparison - Frequency & Damping\n\nMach 0.65\n\nMach 0.70\n\nSysID\nFreq (Hz)\n\nFEM19\nFreq (Hz)\n\nSysID\nDamping\n\nFEM19\nDamping\n\nSysID\nFreq (Hz)\n\nFEM19\nFreq (Hz)\n\nSysID\nDamping\n\nFEM19\nDamping\n\n5.67\n\n6.03\n\n0.0082\n\n0.0081\n\n5.70\n\n6.03\n\n0.0063\n\n0.0066\n\n6.24\n\n6.02\n\n0.0724\n\n0.0773\n\n6.35\n\n6.14\n\n0.0717\n\n0.0806\n\n9.78\n\n9.98\n\n0.0189\n\n0.0207\n\n9.99\n\n10.20\n\n0.0122\n\n0.0106\n\n11.03\n\n10.91\n\n0.0219\n\n0.0277\n\n10.93\n\n10.78\n\n0.0392\n\n0.0397\n\n19.56\n\n18.74\n\n0.0252\n\n0.0205\n\n19.59\n\n18.78\n\n0.0238\n\n0.0214\n\n25.79\n\n25.67\n\n0.0682\n\n0.0105\n\n26.73\n\n25.63\n\n0.0124\n\n0.0119\n\n28.04\n\n27.77\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0117\n\n28.22\n\n27.78\n\n0.0011\n\n0.0121\n\n28.33\n\n28.37\n\n0.0102\n\n0.0267\n\n28.60\n\n28.39\n\n0.0227\n\n0.0286\n\n29.36\n\n28.87\n\n0.0023\n\n0.0122\n\n29.38\n\n28.84\n\n0.0017\n\n0.0134\n\n38.62\n\n38.62\n\n0.0090\n\n0.0090\n\n38.64\n\n38.64\n\n0.0092\n\n0.0092\n\n40.21\n\n40.21\n\n0.0231\n\n0.0231\n\n40.21\n\n40.21\n\n0.0257\n\n0.0257\n\n46.92\n\n46.92\n\n0.0106\n\n0.0106\n\n46.94\n\n46.94\n\n0.0109\n\n0.0109\n\n48.09\n\n48.09\n\n0.0231\n\n0.0231\n\n48.05\n\n48.05\n\n0.0263\n\n0.0263\n\n61.52\n\n61.52\n\n0.0064\n\n0.0064\n\n61.52\n\n61.52\n\n0.0066\n\n0.0066\n\n68.32\n\n68.32\n\n0.0082\n\n0.0082\n\n68.32\n\n68.32\n\n0.0085\n\n0.0085\n\n76.34\n\n76.34\n\n0.0088\n\n0.0088\n\n76.35\n\n76.35\n\n0.0094\n\n0.0094\n\n82.76\n\n82.76\n\n0.0158\n\n0.0158\n\n82.80\n\n82.80\n\n0.0174\n\n0.0174\n\n87.47\n\n87.47\n\n0.0083\n\n0.0083\n\n87.48\n\n87.48\n\n0.0086\n\n0.0086\n\n93.16\n\n93.16\n\n0.0068\n\n0.0068\n\n93.16\n\n93.16\n\n0.0071\n\n0.0071\n\n95.11\n\n95.11\n\n0.0079\n\n0.0079\n\n95.12\n\n95.12\n\n0.0082\n\n0.0082\n\n229\n\nFigure 3.18 \xe2\x80\x93 Bode Plot Comparison of SysID Model to FEM19 SSM\n\n3.4.3\nSysID Simulation\nThe SysID version of the Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 3.19. From the beginning, the\nsimulation architecture designed so that inserting the controller in the TDT\xe2\x80\x99s dSpace control\nsystem would be as easy as possible. For the sake of clarity, the controller interfaces depicted in\nthe figures have been simplified to just their core components. The actuator block (shown in\norange) contains the model of the actuators. The outputs of the actuator are the inputs to the\nplant (control surface positions, velocities, and accelerations) and the sensed position of the\ncontrol surfaces (the RVDT signals). The actuator model is followed by the plant (in state space\nform), the outputs of which (Y) are the accelerometer readings. The primary inputs to the SysID\ncontroller are the accelerometer readings (filtered through the dSpace system) and the RVDT\nsignals. The current tunnel Mach and Q are input for nearest neighbor gain scheduling.\n\n230\n\nFigure 3.19 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Simulation\n\n3.4.4\nSysID Control Law Design\nFigure 3.20 shows the controller design for the SysID system, again slightly simplified. A nearest\nneighbor algorithm is used to determine which set of gains / state space model to use this pass\nthrough the controller. There is some hysteresis built into the algorithm to prevent bouncing\nbetween the point designs when the tunnel is near a boundary condition. All of the gains, etc.,\nare predetermined to minimize computational overhead and make the controller block as fast as\npossible. Tests showed the controller needed to be run at 500 Hz minimum, but the dSpace\nsystem was able to run at 1,000 Hz for the tests.\n\nFigure 3.20 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Controller\n\nThe sensed control surface positions and filtered accelerometer outputs are combined and fed\n\xef\xbf\xbd\nthrough a Kalman filter state space estimator to calculate the estimator outputs \xef\xbf\xbdX\xef\xbf\xbd. The\n231\n\n\xef\xbf\xbd\nresulting outputs from the estimator (X) are multiplied by the LQR gains. A \xe2\x80\x9cCmd Filter\xe2\x80\x9d is then\napplied to obtain the two control surface commands for output to the actuators.\nThe estimator coefficients are derived by first designing the full order estimator gains. The gains\nare then applied to the SysID model to form a state space model. The state space model is\nreduced to 10 states (\xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d reduction) and discretized at the dSpace frequency, 1000 Hz,\nwith \xe2\x80\x9ctustin\xe2\x80\x9d pre-warping.\nThe LQR gains are derived using a full order LQR design process primarily weighting the first 5\nmodes (10 states) with heaviest weighting on the 10 and 20 Hz modes.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cCmd filter\xe2\x80\x9d is second order, 15 Hz, 0.65 damping, \xe2\x80\x9ctustin\xe2\x80\x9d pre-warping, that has been\ndiscretized to 1000 Hz.\nThe weightings for the LQR gains were tuned to achieve our primary goal of actively damping the\n10 Hz flutter mode while maintaining good stability margins. Figure 3.21 and Figure 3.22 show\nthe resulting Bode plots for both the inboard and outboard control surfaces at the Mach 0.65\ncondition. The plots show the 10 Hz mode has been attenuated approximately 9 db in the inboard\nloop and approximately 15 db in the outboard loop. In Figure 3.23, the Nichols plots for the both\nof the control surface loops, show the robust margins of 9 db gain and 45\xc2\xb0 phase (depicted as\nblack diamond shapes in the plot) have been maintained. Figures 3.24, 3.25, and 3.26 show\nsimilar plots for the Mach 0.7 condition. This condition is closer to the flutter condition and as\nsuch was harder to control resulting in slightly lower, but still acceptable, margins. The final\ndesigns were simulated in the time domain and proved to be stable.\n\n232\n\nFigure 3.21 \xe2\x80\x93 Inboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.65)\n\n233\n\nFigure 3.22 \xe2\x80\x93 Outboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.65)\n\n234\n\nFigure 3.23 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Mach 0.65 Nichols Plot\n\n235\n\nFigure 3.24 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Inboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.7)\n\n236\n\nFigure 3.25 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Outboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.7)\n\n237\n\nFigure 3.26 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Mach 0.7 Nichols Plot\n\n238\n\n3.4.5\nSysID Wind Tunnel Testing\nCode was inserted in the controller to gather data that could be used to validate the stability\nmargins derived from the simulation against actual test data. Unfortunately, the data gathered\nwas too noisy to quantifiably validate the simulation. Figure 3.27 shows one of the better plots\nof this data. The plot compares the stability margins derived from one of the early TDT runs (Run\n48, Tab Point 2354, Mach 0.7, Q 61.2 psf) to the expected simulation results.\n\nFigure 3.27 \xe2\x80\x93 Sample Tunnel Data Stability Margin Comparison\n\nAn example of the controller actually controlling flutter is shown in Figure 3.28. The TDT\noperators have the ability to turn the controller on and off in real time and the plot shows one of\nthese occasions where the TBW is in a flutter condition. The data in red shows the wing beginning\nto flutter, while the data in blue shows flutter being controlled. The SysID controller supported\nTDT runs 48 through 54 where Mach varied from 0.23 up to 0.81, Q varied between 10 and 97\npsf, and AOA varied from -3\xc2\xb0 to 1\xc2\xb0. Almost all of testing with the SysID controller was based on\nthe one design point at Mach 0.65, Q 53.9 psf, and entailed no gain scheduling. In all these cases\nwhere the controller was engaged, flutter was controlled.\n\n239\n\nFigure 3.28 \xe2\x80\x93 SysID Controller \xe2\x80\x93 Open-loop/Closed-loop Demonstration\n\n3.4.6\nFEM19 Simulation and Control Law Design\nSince a functioning controller was in place, there was time to attempt to design a new controller\nbased on the FEM19 SSMs. Based on experience with the SysID gain design process, some\nchanges were incorporated for the FEM19 controller. The FEM19 simulation architecture is\nessentially the same as the SysID version. The main difference is that the actuator commands are\nfed back within the controller, so the RVDT outputs are no longer required to be input to the\ncontroller. Figure 3.29 shows the FEM19 simulation.\n\n240\n\nFigure 3.29 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Simulation\n\nThe FEM19 controller architecture (Figure 3.30) is \xe2\x80\x9cessentially\xe2\x80\x9d the same as the SysID controller.\nThe major difference is the actuator commands are fed back instead of using the RVDT signals.\nThe other obvious change is the lack of LQR gains in the diagram. The gains are there, they\xe2\x80\x99ve\njust been embedded in the estimator\xe2\x80\x99s realization prior to calculating the estimator coefficients.\nAlso, a 15\xc2\xb0 limit is imposed on the actuator commands and the hysteresis in the nearest neighbor\nalgorithm was modified such that the states and actuator commands could be zeroed out briefly\nwhen transitioning between design points. The \xe2\x80\x9cCmd filter\xe2\x80\x9d frequency was increased to 40 Hz\n(second order, 40 Hz, 0.65 damping, \xe2\x80\x9ctustin\xe2\x80\x9d pre-warping, that has been discretized to 1000 Hz).\n\nFigure 3.30 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Controller\n\nThe process for deriving the LQR and estimator gains is fundamentally different from the SysID\nversion. In order to increase stability margins, the FEM19 SSM was augmented with a pair of\n\n241\n\nsecond order filters (40 Hz, 0.98 damping) to model the two actuator\xe2\x80\x99s states and allow the LQR\nprocess to put gains on them. In order to keep the LQR gains on the actuator\xe2\x80\x99s states in check,\nthe system was augmented with a pair of third order filters effectively penalizing very high gains\nto prevent driving the actuator bandwidth too high because of its inherent non-linearities. The\nthird order filter is a second order filter (10 Hz, 0.6 damping) over a second order filter (100 Hz,\n0.7 damping) multiplied by a first order filter (101 Hz). The LQR gains are derived using a full order\nLQR design process on the augmented model primarily weighting the first 5 modes with heaviest\nweighting on the 10 Hz flutter mode. It was found that heavily weighting the third state of the\nthird order filter kept the actuator gains within the desired range.\nThe estimator gains are calculated and the LQR gains are embedded into estimator to form a new\nstate space model. This model is reduced (balanced reduction) to 20 states (10 modes) and\ndiscretized at 1000 Hz.\nThe weightings for the LQR gains were tuned to actively damp the 10 Hz flutter mode while\nmaintaining good stability margins. Figures 3.31, 3.32, and 3.33 show the resulting Bode and\nNichols plots at the Mach 0.7 condition. The plots show that the 10 Hz mode has been attenuated\nabout 7 db in the inboard loop and about 6 db in the outboard loop, but the robust margins (9\ndb and 45\xc2\xb0) were maintained. In fact, the robust margins were maintained for all but the two\nmost unstable cases (Mach 0.75, Q 137.7 psf and Mach 0.75, Q 160.6 psf) and the nominal\nmargins (6 db and 30\xc2\xb0) were maintained in those cases.\n\n242\n\nFigure 3.31 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Inboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.7)\n\n243\n\nFigure 3.32 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Outboard Control Surface Open-Loop/Closed-Loop Bode Plot Comparison (Mach 0.7)\n\n244\n\nFigure 3.33 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Mach 0.7 Nichols Plot\n\n245\n\nThe final designs were tested in the time domain. Figure 3.34 shows a comparison of the\nsimulated time responses, with the control loops open and closed, for one of the unstable cases\n(Mach 0.75, Q 68.9 psf). As expected, the open loop accelerations grow unbounded.\n\nFigure 3.34 \xe2\x80\x93 FEM19 Simulated Time Response\n\n3.4.7\nFEM19 Wind Tunnel Testing\nFigure 3.35 shows an example of the controller controlling flutter at an unstable condition. Again,\nthe data in red shows the wing beginning to flutter when the controller is turned off and the data\nin blue shows controller damping out the flutter. The FEM19 controller supported TDT runs 55\nthrough 63 where Mach varied from 0.35 up to 0.83, Q varied between 21 and 115 psf, and AOA\nvaried from -3\xc2\xb0 to 5\xc2\xb0.\n\n246\n\nFigure 3.35 \xe2\x80\x93 Fem19 Controller \xe2\x80\x93 Open-loop/Closed-loop Demonstration\n\n3.4.8\nSystem Identification Model Development \xe2\x80\x93 Version 2\nWith two functioning controllers in hand, a decision was made to try and develop a controller\nbased on control surface sweeps at an unstable point. In order to do this, of course, a controller\nwould have to be functioning at the time to keep flutter attenuated. Data was acquired, but\nseveral issues prevented the models from converging to a solution. Large amplitude, high\nfrequency sweeps were required to overcome the inherent noise in the system. However, the\ncombination of amplitudes and frequencies required were too high for the actuators which\nbecame flow rate limited. Also, some unexpected non-linearities became apparent in the data\nthat could not be accounted for in the SysID process. Between the actuator limitations, the\ninherent noise in the system, and the non-linearities, the SysID process failed to converge on a\nsolution.\n\n247\n\n3.4.9\nConclusions\nThe main conclusion that can be drawn from this control law effort is that the LQR design process\nworked very well in this instance, allowing the 10 Hz flutter mode to be targeted directly in the\ngain design process. The cycle time for iterations was reduced and the ability to switch from the\nSysID models over to the FEM models was very smooth. The FEM19 SSMs based on the preholiday model proved to be sufficient for designing a robust control system, potentially reducing\nthe need for open-loop testing in the future. Flutter suppression was demonstrated with two\ndifferent control systems that proved to be very robust over a wide range of Mach, Q, and AOA.\n\n3.5\n\nTest Procedures\n\nTest points investigated include flutter points, control surface sweeps, gust vane oscillation\npoints, and control surface dwells.\nFlutter points involve slowly increasing Mach and dynamic pressure along constant pressure H\nlines while visually monitoring model vibration as well as PSDs and time histories for signs of\ninstability. A bypass valve is opened at any signs of instability and the tunnel winds down. An\nexample of an unstable open loop flutter point is shown in Figure 3.36. The plot is a time history\nof the nacelle pylon accelerometer.\n\nFigure 3.36 \xe2\x80\x93 Unstable Open Loop Flutter Point\n\nFlutter points were run both open and closed looped. Once the control laws allowed the Mach\nand dynamic pressure to increase past the open loop flutter boundary a technique was used to\nopen the loop and quickly close the loop and see if the open loop system looked stable. This\ntechnique allowed for determining the back side of the Mach dip open loop flutter boundary.\nControl surface sweeps involve running a fixed amplitude sweep from 0 to 30 Hz to generate the\ndata required for the system ID control laws. The sweeps were run inboard alone, outboard\n\n248\n\nalone, and both inboard and outboard. The sweeps were run both open loop and closed loop.\nThe response due to the control sweeps for the closed loop point in the open loop unstable region\nwas lost in the overall noise and insufficient for system ID.\nThe gust vanes were oscillated both open and closed loop to investigate the control laws effect\non gust loads.\nControl surface dwells involve oscillating the control surface at the 10 Hz flutter frequency and\nthen stopping the oscillation and recording the response. This technique allows for a good\nestimate of system damping in the open loop stable region.\n\n3.6\n\nTest Results\n\nTesting was broken up into pre-holiday open loop testing and post-holiday closed loop testing.\n3.6.1 GVT and FEM Correlation\nGVTs were run to correlate our analysis model to the test frequencies and mode shapes. The final\npreholiday in tunnel GVT results were compared to the pretest FEM18 analysis model results. A\ncomparison of the analysis and test frequencies and modal assurance criteria is shown in Figure\n3.37. The two primary flutter modes are second bending mode 3 and first torsion mode 4. The\nGVT vs. FEM18 frequencies are significantly different and the mode 3 MAC was 0.9. FEM19 was\ncreated to better match the preholiday GVT result. This was mostly accomplished by removing\nthe electronic turn table model we had attached to the FEM. In addition, small changes to the\nwing stiffness were required. A comparison preholiday GVT and FEM 19 is shown in Figure 3.38.\nThis shows a very good comparison between test and analysis. After the preholiday testing a\ncutout was made in a fairing at the root of the strut. It was suspected that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough\nclearance between the strut root joint and the fairing and some fouling was occurring. This was\ntested by looking at GVT results with and without a wedge added which contacted the fairing.\nThe cut out and wedge are shown in Figure 3.39. A summary of GVT frequencies showing which\nGVTs the FEMS are based on is shown in Table 3.5. The table shows significant difference in Mode\n3 frequencies pre and post holidays. Part of the difference is due to the post-holiday cutout in\nthe strut root fairing. The GVT results with the wedge included don\xe2\x80\x99t get all the way back to the\npreholiday values. FEM20 was created by updating stiffnesses again to match the post-holiday\nGVT results. The post-holiday GVT is compared to FEM20 in Figure 3.40. Again, there is good\ncorrelation between test and analysis.\n\n249\n\nFigure 3.37 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Holiday GVT vs. FEM18\n\nFigure 3.38 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Holiday GVT vs. FEM19\n\n250\n\nFigure 3.39 \xe2\x80\x93 Strut Root Fairing Cutout and Wedge\nTable 3.5 \xe2\x80\x93 GVT Frequency Summary\n\nFigure 3.40 \xe2\x80\x93 Post-Holiday GVT vs. FEM20\n\n251\n\n3.6.2 Doublet Lattice Aerodynamic Correction Factors Update\nTo improve the test vs. analysis comparisons, the doublet lattice static aerodynamic correction\nfactors, described in Section 2.1.8.5, were updated to better match all the test mean wing strain\ngage results. This was done for Mach numbers 0.7, 0.75, and 0.82.

Blue Xs are stable and red\nXs are unstable. The pre-holiday unstable points for four angles of attack are shown in Figure\n3.43. The results show a significant variation with angle of attack. This is in contrast to traditional\nlinear flutter results which don\xe2\x80\x99t change for different angles of attack or loads. This angle of attack\nvariation is unique to the truss braced wing due to its large in-plane loads and reduced stiffness\nof the inboard wing.\n\n252\n\n8 MW\n300\n\n100\n6 MW\n\n90\n\nDynamic Pressure, Q, PSF\n\n80\n\n200\n\n70\n60\n\n150\n\n50\n40\n1\n\n4 MW\n100\n\n30\n75\n\n20\nH=50 PSF\n\nStable\nUnstable\n\n10\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nMotor Speed = 235 RPM\nVane Angle = 18 Degrees\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\nMach Number, M\nFigure 3.42 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Holiday Flutter Test Results Alpha=-3\n120\n\nFlutter Dynamic Pressure (PSF)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nTest Data -3 AOA\nTest Data -1 AOA\nTest Data 1 AOA\nTest Data 3 AOA\n\n0\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\nMach\nFigure 3.43 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Holiday Unstable Points\n\n253\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n3.6.4 Non-linear Flutter Method\nA method to include preload and large displacement effects in the flutter analysis is shown in\nFigure 3.44. The process starts by generating loads in Nastran solution 144. Next the loads are\napplied to the model in a Nastran solution 106 nonlinear run including the large displacement\nparameter. Finally the linear solution 145 is run from a restart of the stiffness and mass matrix\noutput from the 106 run.\n\nFigure 3.44 \xe2\x80\x93 Preload and Large Displacement Flutter\n\n3.6.5 Pre-Holiday Flutter Test vs. Analysis\nPre-holiday flutter comparison between test and analysis is shown in Figure 3.45. The comparison\nis with the static corrections from Section 3.6.2 used in the solution 144 analysis, and no\ncorrections to the doublet lattice unsteady aerodynamics for the flutter solution 145 analysis.\nThe black line shows the traditional linear 145 solution. The analysis including the preload and\nlarge displacements predicts an angle of attack tend which matches the test data. The analysis\nalso is accurate in predicting the minimum flutter speed at each angle of attack for this\nconfiguration. The Mach trend using the theoretical doublet lattice does not match the test data.\n\n254\n\n120\n\nNo Unsteady Aero Corrections\n\nFlutter Dynamic Pressure (PSF)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\nTest Data -3 AOA\nTest Data -1 AOA\nTest Data 1 AOA\nTest Data 3 AOA\n\n40\n\nv19 FEM No Preload No Large Disp\nv19 FEM Preload + Large Disp -3 AOA\nv19 FEM Preload + Large Disp -1 AOA\nv19 FEM Preload + Large Disp -3 AOA Updated Steady Aero Corrections\n\n20\n\nv19 FEM Preload + Large Disp -1 AOA Updated Steady Aero Corrections\nv19 FEM Preload + Large Disp +1 AOA Updated Steady Aero Correction\nV19 FEM Preload + Large Disp +3 AOA Updated Steady Aero Corrections\n0\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\nMach\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\nFigure 3.45 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Holiday Test vs. Analysis\n\n3.6.6 Post-Holiday Flutter Points\nPost-holiday alpha -3 flutter points are shown in Figure 3.46.

The plots show a sharp rise in RMS as the flutter boundary is approached except\nthe strut gage. The strut gage peaks at lower Mach numbers than the flutter boundary. The strut\ngage peaks between M = 0.72 to M = 0.74. The alpha = -3 results show peak RMS values in the\nhigh Q region above the unstable region.\n3.6.8 Post-Holiday Dwell Points Damping Estimates\nDwell time history decays were recorded at some 102 points, varying in Angle Of Attack (AOA),\nMach, and/or dynamic pressure. A technique, scripted in Matlab, of fitting a set of damped sine\nwaves to the decay response was employed to access modal damping. The analysis technique\nand results are documented in Volume III of this report. The results show the damping values\ngetting smaller as the flutter boundary is approached. There is also a section of low damping\nthat occurs at lower Mach numbers and Q than the flutter boundary. Damping then increases\nas the Mach and Q increases before reducing again before the flutter boundary. Some of the\nestimated values show small positive damping. It should be noted that all dwell points were\nstable and the positive damping means there was a limit cycle oscillation or the model was\napproaching flutter onset. These positive damping results illustrate the difficulty in estimating\n\n257\n\ndamping using the test data. The values were positive in the time slice analyzed but the results\nwould\xe2\x80\x99ve been negative if a different time slice was chosen.\n3.6.9 Closed Loop Flutter\nControl laws for both system ID and FEM19 SSM were successful in suppressing flutter. The\ncontrol laws were robust and suppressed flutter for a variety of Mach, dynamic pressures, and\nangle of attacks investigated.

The gust responses were recorded as the airvane\noscillation system (AOS) was swept from 0.5 to 13.5 Hz in 100 seconds, then a dwell at 13.5 Hz\nfor 10 seconds, followed by a sweep from 13.5 Hz to 0.5 Hz in 60 seconds. The control laws used\nfor the plotted results were based on the FEM19 SSM. The results show a peak response at the\nfirst bending mode and a smaller peak at the second bending mode. The second bending mode\nis a primary flutter mode and its gust response grows as the Mach and dynamics pressure\napproach the unstable region. The flutter suppression designed control laws show a large amount\nof gust load alleviation (GLA) at the second bending peak and a small amount of load alleviation\n\n258\n\neverywhere else. A PSD type gust analysis would show some amount of GLA since the resulting\nload is a result of input gusts at all frequencies. A tuned discrete gust critical at the flutter\nfrequency would show significant GLA while a tuned gust critical at other frequencies would show\na small amount of GLA.\n\nFigure 3.50 \xe2\x80\x93 Gust Response RMS Mach = .75, Q = 64, Alpha = +1\n\n3.7\n\nConclusions\n\nAnalysis accurately predicted the flutter mechanism would be a coalescence of Mode 3 and Mode\n4 at around 10 Hz. Flutter results showed significant variation with different angles of attack.\nAngle of attack variations are modeled fairly accurately using a method which accounts for\npreload and large displacement effects. The analysis using theoretical doublet lattice\naerodynamics does not produce the sharp decrease in flutter speed with Mach but is fairly\naccurate in predicting minimum flutter speed. These predictions may not be accurate for\ndifferent TBW vehicle geometries and/or aerodynamic configurations. No evidence was found of\nstrut buffet causing vibration problems. Flutter suppression was successfully demonstrated using\ncontrol laws derived from test system ID data and analysis models. Even though the control laws\nwere designed for flutter suppression, the control laws do provide some gust load alleviation as\nwell.\n\n259\n\n4.0\n\nAdvanced Aero Technologies Experiment\n\nA wind tunnel test with a turbulent and a laminar airfoil was conducted in the NASA Langley 0.3m\nTCT facility. The test was two dimensional. The turbulent airfoil was for reference. The laminar\nairfoil was from the mid span region of the SUGAR strut braced wing configuration. The intent\nwas to measure the airfoil characteristics of the laminar flow airfoil and use the information to\ncreate a data base that could be used to estimate performance of configurations that use laminar\nflow airfoils.\nPressure, force, and moment data from the test did not compare well to expectations. Testing in\nsuch a small tunnel relied on adaptive tunnel walls to conform to the streamlines around the\nmodel. This Wall Adaptation System (WAS) appeared to have difficulty converging to the\nstreamlines when airflow became transonic.\nAnother goal was to demonstrate laminar flow drag benefit and verify a laminar flow design.\nSome laminar flow was shown to be present using Temperature Sensitive Paint, however wakes\nfrom the small regions of laminar flow mixed with the wakes from turbulent regions before\narriving at the wake rake probes aft of the model. This made measuring the drag reduction for\nthe laminar region difficult.\n4.1.1 Test Preparation\nIn addition to the two face-to-face meetings between Boeing and the tunnel facility personnel in\n2012, all test preparation was handled by scheduled telephone conversations and emails\nthroughout the year. Planning for tunnel conditions, rake positions, and run rates was based on\npast experiences of the tunnel facility personnel. Alpha schedules, Mach and Reynolds Number\nrequirements were based on airplane requirements. Temperature sensitive paint and data\nreduction requirements were handled by the tunnel facility.\n4.1.2 Model Design and Fabrication\nThe wind tunnel models were designed and fabricated by Micro Craft in Tullahoma, TN. Inputs\nfrom Boeing and the tunnel facility personnel were solicited for the design. The 7 inch chord was\nslightly larger in size compared to past models that had been tested in the tunnel facility. The\nslightly larger scale allowed for the correct dimensioning of the trailing edge thicknesses of both\nairfoils and allowed the installation of a trailing edge pressure tap. The model was machined from\n13-8 stainless steel. A non-removable lower surface cover plate was employed to allow the\nrouting of the surface pressure orifices used to calculate aerodynamic characteristics. An orifice\ndiameter of 0.020 was chosen to minimize aerodynamic interference. Additionally, all cover plate\nfasteners were inserted from the lower surface of the model to also minimize interference on\nthe upper surface.\n\n260\n\n4.1.3 Testing\nThe test plan was set up for three airfoil configurations based on two airfoil geometries. The first\nconfiguration was a reference airfoil designed with pressure gradients that are typical of airfoils\nwith a turbulent boundary layer flow over nearly the entire chord. This airfoil was designated as\nT1. The T1 airfoil was only tested with transition fixed using glass beads. Transition would likely\ntake place on the forward portion of the airfoil even without the glass beads but the transition\nposition could vary with Mach or angle-of-attack. The beads were added to ensure that transition\nalways occurred at the same location. The second and third configurations were based on an\nairfoil specifically designed for laminar flow. This airfoil was designated as L1. At the cruise lift\ncoefficient the boundary layer flow on the L1 airfoil was expected to remain laminar from the\nleading edge aft to the shock due to a favorable pressure gradient. The L1 airfoil without\nboundary layer transition trips was the second planned configuration. The L1 airfoil with fixed\ntransition trips was the third planned configuration. The T1 and L1 airfoils are similar. The L1\nairfoil was based on the T1 airfoil. The three dimensional SUGAR truss braced wing uses the L1\nairfoil for a significant percentage of its span.\nThe wind tunnel test took place in the 0.3 Meter wind tunnel at NASA Langley. The test section\nof the 0.3 Meter wind tunnel is 13 inches square. The airfoil models create a two dimensional\nshape by spanning the test section wall to wall with the same airfoil. The T1 and L1 airfoil chords\nare 7 inches long. The decision to use such a large model in a small test section was based on the\nwind tunnels ability to adapt the shape of the ceiling and floor of the wind tunnel to the shape of\nthe streamlines that exist around the airfoil. The ceiling and floor are supported by 21 jacks that\ncan be moved by the Wall Adaptation System (WAS) in an iterative manner until the shape of the\nceiling and floor converge to the theoretical shape of streamlines in free air. The jacks have a\nmaximum displacement of plus or minus three inches. In the NASA 0.3 Meter bookkeeping\nsystem this test was Test Number 559. Installation of one of the airfoil models in the tunnel is\nshown in Figure 4.1.\nThe airfoil models are not mounted on a balance. Lift, drag, and pitching moment data are\nobtained from pressure data. Airfoil lift and pitching moment were integrated from a chordwise\ndistribution of static pressure taps. The pressure taps were spaced so close to each other in the\nchordwise direction that they were split into three rows to allow more for room between the\ntaps. One of the pressure rows is in the center of the airfoil model, 6.5 inches from each of the\ntunnel walls. The other two rows are 1 inch away on either side of the center row.\nDrag data is obtained from a wake rake, illustrated in Figure 4.2. The wake rake consists of an\narm with 9 total pressure probes that span half of the tunnel. Probe 1 is in the center of the\ntunnel and the other 8 probes are equally spaced from the center of the tunnel to the wall where\nthe arm is mounted. The wake arm can be moved up and down in very small increments to map\n\n261\n\nthe wake at 9 different locations. The total pressure wake rake is located 1.5 chord lengths\ndownstream of the airfoil model trailing edge.\n\nFigure 4.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Installation of 2D Airfoil Model in 0.3 meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel\n\nc = 7\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nData from\nprobe #1 is\nnormally\nused for drag\n\n1.5c = 10.5\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWind Tunnel\nSide Walls\n13\xe2\x80\x9d\nProbe # 1\n\nRake with 9\nTotal Pressure\nProbes\nProbe # 9\n\nWind Tunnel Model\nAirfoil Leading Edge\n\nWind Tunnel Model\nAirfoil Trailing Edge\nFigure 4.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Wake Rake Arrangement\n\nThe wind tunnel test was unintentionally divided into two entries. The first entry took place in\nlate August of 2012. The model was installed and three data runs were completed on August 22nd\nand 23rd before testing was halted due to tunnel anomalies involving the wall adaptation system.\nIt was determined that jack 7, a ceiling unit near the leading edge of the model, had seized.\nAnother problem found during inspection was that the ceiling was not flat when all the jacks\nwere commanded to be at their zero location. The test was stopped while NASA determined a\nsolution.\nThe test resumed in mid-October after NASA completed a \xe2\x80\x9ctune-up\xe2\x80\x9d of the tunnel by servicing\nand re-aligning many of the ceiling jacks. The second entry went much smoother. The Wall\n\n262\n\nAdaptation System worked much better, but still caused problems on occasion. Forty two more\ndata runs were completed during the second entry from October 10th through November 8th. The\ntotal number of runs during the test was 81, but many of these were not data runs.\n4.1.4 Test Results and Analysis\n0.3 Meter Lift and Drag Measurements\nCFD data was compared to the wind tunnel data to check for data quality. The CFD data was\nobtained from a 2D Bauer-Garabedian full potential code with a Cohen-Reshotko laminar\nboundary layer and a Nash-Macdonald turbulent boundary layer. This Garabedian code (Program\nH) has compared well with wind tunnel data from past 2D airfoil tests. The CFD and wind tunnel\ndata were expected to be close. At subsonic conditions the airfoil pressure distributions predicted\nby CFD and measured in the wind tunnel compare well, however the comparison is not as close\nat transonic conditions (due to Mach number or lift coefficient). Figure 4.3 shows the difference\nin shock strength and location between CFD and the wind tunnel at two lift coefficients at Mach\n0.70. At the low lift coefficient the pressures compare reasonably well. At the high lift coefficient\nthe shock in the wind tunnel is significantly stronger and further aft. A likely source of the\nproblem with the pressure distribution comparisons is the position of the wind tunnel walls;\napparently the walls adapt well at subsonic conditions but seemingly not as well at transonic\nconditions.\nA comparison of lift curves between CFD and the wind tunnel raises additional questions about\nthe wall adaptation system. Figure 4.3 contains a comparison of lift curves from the 0.3 Meter\nwind tunnel and CFD at three different Mach numbers. At a given angle-of-attack the lift in the\n0.3 Meter wind tunnel is always greater than CFD. Some of this is caused by the shock strength\nproblem, but at Mach 0.5 the airflow is subsonic and the wind tunnel lift curve is still shifted. The\nreason for the mismatch has not been found but the problem could be related to upwash\nimposed by the Wall Adaptation System. Figure 4.4 shows how the walls adapted for the T1 airfoil\nat a Mach number of 0.72 and a CL of 0.822. The average slope of the upper and lower wall in\nfront of the model could be regarded as an upwash angle. For this condition the average slope\nor upwash was about 6 degrees. This imposed upwash angle is high compared to typical values\nand may be the reason for the upward shift of the lift curves.\n\n263\n\nT1 Upper Surface Pressure Distributions\nProgram H\n\nThe slope of the sonic\nrooftop is different\n\nThe shock position is different\n\nPresuure Coefficient\n\nPressure Coefficient\n\nMach 0.70\nTest 559, Run 35\n\nCL = 1.16\n\nCL = 0.70\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nChordwise Fraction\n\n0.4\n\nChordwise Fraction\n\nFigure 4.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil T1 CFD and Wind Tunnel Upper Surface Pressure Distributions\n\nFigure 4.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Lift Curve Comparison, T1 Airfoil\n\n264\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 4.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Tunnel Ceiling and Floor Displacement\n\nThe shock strength problem is also evident in the drag polars at high lift coefficients. A\ncomparison of drag polars for Mach 0.5, 0.7, and 0.74 is shown in Figure 4.6. The drag from the\n0.3 Meter wind tunnel and CFD compare well at low Mach numbers and low lift coefficients, but\nat conditions where a strong shock exists the drag in the wind tunnel is too large.\nThe excessive shock strength in the wind tunnel also affects the drag divergence Mach number\nof the airfoil at constant lift coefficient. The performance of the airfoil in the 0.3 Meter wind\ntunnel was clearly inferior to the CFD prediction, as shown in Figure 4.7.\nThe lift coefficient where shock induced flow separation becomes significant is referred to as the\nbuffet onset lift coefficient. The trend of buffet onset lift coefficient with Mach number is called\nthe buffet onset boundary, which may limit the maximum cruise altitude of an aircraft. Two\ncommon methods to predict buffet onset lift coefficient involve the chordwise location of the\nshock and the divergence of the airfoil trailing edge pressure with increasing lift coefficient. Using\nthese methods with data from the 0.3 Meter wind tunnel and from CFD produced the buffet\nonset boundaries for the L1 airfoil shown in Figure 4.8. It can be seen that the buffet onset\nboundary from the 0.3 Meter wind tunnel data is significantly lower than the CFD prediction.\n\n265\n\nFigure 4.6 \xe2\x80\x93 Drag Polar Comparison, T1 Airfoil\n\nDrag Divergence Mach Number\n0.82\n\nAirfoil T1 Drag\nDivergence Compared\nto Program H\n\nLift Coefficient\n\n0.8\n0.78\n0.76\n0.74\n0.72\n0.7\n\nT1 0.3 Meter\nProg H, Garabedian\n\n0.68\n0.71\n\n200\nProg H, Garabedian\n\n160\n\nCL = 0.75\n\n140\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.7\nMach Number\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.76\n\n80\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.7\nMach Number\n\nT1 0.3 Meter\n\n180\n\nProg H, Garabedian\n\n160\n\nCL = 0.70\n\n140\n\n0.73\n0.74\nMach Number\n\n200\nT1 0.3 Meter\n\n180\n\nDrag Coefficient\n\nT1 0.3 Meter\n\n180\n\nDrag Coefficient\n\nDrag Coefficient\n\n200\n\n0.72\n\n0.8\n\nProg H, Garabedian\n\n160\n140\n\nCL = 0.80\n\n120\n100\n80\n0.5\n\nFigure 4.7 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil T1 Drag Divergence Compared to CFD\n\n266\n\n0.6\n0.7\nMach Number\n\n0.8\n\nEstimated Buffet Onset Boundary, L1 Airfoil\n1.5\n1.4\n\nLift Coefficient\n\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\nProg H, Fixed Transition\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.66\n\nProg H, Free Transition\n0.3 Meter Tunnel, Unpolished\n\n0.67\n\n0.68\n\n0.69\n\n0.7\n0.71\nMach Number\n\n0.72\n\n0.73\n\n0.74\n\n0.75\n\nFigure 4.8 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil L1 Estimated Buffet Onset Boundary\n\nDrag data from all 9 of the wake rake probes were compared to evaluate the consistency of the\ndrag measured across the span.

The high drag\nfrom Probe 9 may indicate that the airflow on the tunnel side walls has separated.

One of the main reasons for testing is to find the limits of airfoil performance.\nThis performance cannot be properly measured if the shock strength is incorrect. Even\nincrements between airfoils cannot be used because the wall adaptation system may alter shock\nstrength on one airfoil more than on another airfoil.\nLaminar Flow\nSome laminar boundary layer flow was achieved on the L1 airfoil and confirmed using\nTemperature Sensitive Paint (TSP). Laminar flow is indicated by the dark regions in Figure 4.11.\nLaminar flow made it back to the shock for a small portion of the airfoil in the middle of the\npicture. The results shown in Figure 4.11 were only achieved after the leading edge was polished;\ninitial runs with TSP did not indicate any laminar flow. The TSP paint felt smooth after application\nbut apparently it was not smooth enough to support laminar flow until it was polished.\nResults from the wind tunnel did not indicate any drag reduction due to laminar flow on the L1\nairfoil. Laminar flow should have resulted in a large drag reduction. The drag for the T1 and L1\nairfoils is shown in Figure 4.12, Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14. CFD predictions are shown in the left\nhand plots. Drag measured in the wind tunnel is shown in the right hand plots. The CFD data\npredicts no drag reduction for L1 if both T1 and L1 are fully turbulent, but a large drag reduction\nfor L1 if it is laminar. The wind tunnel results do not shown any drag reduction for L1 before and\nafter the leading edge was polished.\nThe absence of drag reduction due to laminar flow is likely due to the small area were laminar\nflow was achieved and the mixing that occurred before the airflow reached the wake rake probes.\n\n269\n\nReferring back to Figure 4.11 it can be seen that the boundary layer at the leading edge is laminar,\nbut as the airflow moves aft most of this begins to transition to a turbulent boundary layer\nindicated by the disappearing dark wedges of laminar flow. Fully laminar flow back to the shock\nlocation only extends over about 20% of the span in the middle of the picture where the dark\nregion stops in more of a straight line. By the time the airflow got to the wake rake station the\nboundary layer wakes from the laminar and turbulent regions were fully mixed. As shown in\nFigure 4.2, the wake rakes were 1.5 chords downstream of the airfoil trailing edge, and the dark\nwedges of laminar flow shown in Figure 4.11 faded away before even reaching the trailing edge\nof the airfoil.\nNote that only about half of the model span is shown in Figure 4.11. The half span is 6.5 inches\nso the extent of fully laminar flow is only about 1.3 inches wide. It is possible that laminar flow\nwas not achieved near the sides of the tunnel due to interference from the tunnel walls, and that\nlaminar flow was not achieved in the center of the tunnel due to interference from the pressure\ntaps on the model.\nLaminar flow did affect the wakes measured in the wind tunnel. The drag levels calculated from\nall the wake rakes are shown in Figure 4.15 for one condition with and without laminar flow.\nThere is a variation in the drag that is a function of the where the probes are located along the\ntrailing edge, and the variation in drag is different with and without laminar flow. The largest\nregion of laminar flow was in front of Probes 4 and 5 which measured an increase in drag,\nhowever Probes 7 and 8 measured a drag reduction.

The tunnel is small enough that a strong\nshock likely chokes the airflow in half of the tunnel, and the wall adaptation system does not\nhave the sufficient capability to compensate.\nAnother reason to recommend against a second entry is the difficulty in achieving fully laminar\nflow over a large enough spanwise region to be able to measure the drag benefit of laminar flow.\nAn airfoil model without any pressure taps may achieve fully laminar flow over a sufficiently large\nenough region in the mid span of the model, but lift and pitching moment data would not be\nobtained.\nOne proposal is to perform a \xe2\x80\x9ctune-up\xe2\x80\x9d for the floor jacks similar what was done to the ceiling\njacks last September. It is felt that a \xe2\x80\x9ctune-up\xe2\x80\x9d might make the tunnel work more efficiently; the\nwall adaptation system may work faster. However, the problem with shock strength will still be\npresent.\n\n273\n\n5.0\n\nSummary\n\nThe team has made significant accomplishments in all areas of truss braced wing technology\ndevelopment.\nWorking with the Georgia Tech/Virginia Tech multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) environment\nhas led to a successful wing planform optimization. This helped define the geometry of the 765095-RD SUGAR High truss braced configuration that was then detailed by Boeing. This\nconfiguration was used for a variety of analyses including low speed and high speed\naerodynamics, and a detailed FEM. The geometry was also used as the starting point for work on\nthe update to the hybrid electric configuration and acoustic analysis in Task 2.2.\nThis geometry was also used to provide airfoil shapes for the testing in the NASA TCT facility (Task\n3.2) that was eventually completed in November 2012 after some test difficulties. The geometry\nand the completed FEM analysis were used by NextGen to design the aeroelastic model that was\ntested in 2013 and 2014 in the NASA TDT facility (Task 3.1).\nAll analysis tasks were completed, performance and sizing was updated, technology\ndevelopment roadmaps were updated, the aeroelastic wind tunnel test was completed, and all\nresults were documented in this final report and the aeroelastic test report (Volume III \xe2\x80\x93 Truss\nBraced Wing Aeroelastic Test Report).\n\n5.1\n\nTechnical Results\n\nFuel burn and energy use is reduced by 54% compared to the SUGAR Free current technology\nBaseline (Goal 60%). The Phase II SUGAR High aircraft is better than Phase I (39% reduction in\nPhase I), mostly due to lighter wing structure. Use of the unducted fan version of the engine\nreduces fuel burn and energy by 56% (Goal 60%).\nAirport compatibility analysis establishes feasibility of a folding wing aircraft without strong\nadverse impact on airport usage.\nAeroelastic impacts on TBW design are manageable and updated wing weight is less than\nassumed in Phase I. Analysis accurately predicted the flutter mechanism. Flutter results showed\nsignificant variation with different angles of attack. Angle of attack variations are modeled fairly\naccurately using a method which accounts for preload and large displacement effects. The\nanalysis using theoretical doublet lattice aerodynamics does not produce the sharp decrease in\nflutter speed with Mach but is fairly accurate in predicting minimum flutter speed. These\npredictions may not be accurate for different TBW vehicle geometries and/or aerodynamic\nconfigurations. Flutter suppression was successfully demonstrated using control laws derived\nfrom test system ID data and analysis models.\n\n274\n\n5.2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5.3\n\nConclusions\nSUGAR High has made good progress and is coming close to NASA emissions and fuel burn\ngoals.\nThe unducted fan version of the engine, when integrated on the TBW airframe, provides\nadditional improvements over the turbofan configuration.\nHigh span folding wings are likely to be compatible with most airports of interest. They\npose surmountable operational and limited infrastructure challenges.\nAlthough Mach 0.7 minimizes fuel burn, higher cruise speed should be considered for its\nincrease in productivity and thus higher economic value.\nFlutter analysis of TBW designs need to include pre-load and large displacement nonlinear effects.\nFlutter suppression was successfully demonstrated on a TBW configuration.\n\nRecommendations\n\nImplement the next steps in TBW technology development plan, including:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConduct a wing design update. Analyze and design features of strut, jury, and attachment\njoints to meet structural criteria and aerodynamic drag targets. Consider both M=0.7 and\n0.8 designs.\nAfter the design update, conduct high speed and low speed aerodynamic wind tunnel\ntests.\nInvestigate higher fidelity unsteady aeroelastic tools to better predict the flutter\nboundary of TBW design.\nConduct initial planning for a possible TBW demonstrator aircraft.\n\n275\n\nReferences\n1.

Though traditional NLF airfoils,\nincluding NACA 6-digit airfoils, have been used successfully for general aviation, their benefit is limited\nto a narrow usable lift range. Moreover, uncertainty in performance caused by surface roughness due to\ncontamination or change in flow conditions has become one of the major issues. A computational\nframework has been developed to design optimized robust airfoils and improve the current generation of\nNLF.\nTraditionally, aerodynamic shape optimization of an airfoil starts from a knowledge of the boundary layer\nproperties and understanding the relationship between the pressure distribution and the airfoil geometry.\nIn the inverse design approach, a desired flow property is specified along some boundary, e.g., a surface\npressure distribution or velocity distribution, and an optimizer is then employed to modify the shape of\nthe airfoil to attain the target flow property. The problem is well posed if the target distribution is\nformulated in terms of design variables while satisfying the constraints. One of the major disadvantages\nof this method is that the designer needs to have enough experience to specify the desired flow profile\nalong the surface. In other words, the designer needs to represent his or her design needs via the surface\nflow properties. In another approach, called the direct design method, some objective is quantified as a\nfunction of design variables, e.g., lift to drag ratio. One of the major advantages of this method is that the\ndesigner does not have to rely on experience and knowledge of the surface pressure distribution in order\nto formulate the desired flow profile. In the direct design method an analysis code is linked with an\noptimizer that varies the design variables, which modifies the shape, to attain the target performance\nwhile maintaining constraint feasibility.\nOptimization algorithms can be broadly categorized into gradient based and non-gradient based methods.\nThough gradient based methods are generally faster, for multi-modal problems like airfoil optimization,\nthe optimizer may lead to a local optimum based on the initial starting point. One way to solve this\nproblem is to start the optimizer with different initial conditions and then select the best airfoil. Among\nnon-gradient based methods, some of the commonly used population based stochastic methods are\nGenetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarming Optimization (PSO) methods. These methods start with\nan initial population which spans the entire design space and tries to reach globally optimized designs by\ndifferent mechanisms. Although these methods are expensive, they are theoretically guaranteed to achieve\n\n279\n\nglobally optimized solutions if enough population members and generations are used. The efficiency of\npopulation based stochastic methods varies from problem to problem, but in general a GA is preferred for\ndiscrete design variables and PSO for continuous design variables.\nKeeping in mind the pros and cons of the various methods discussed above, a direct design method has\nbeen used with particle swarming optimization in the airfoil design framework. The three major\ncomponents in the framework are an airfoil parameterization module, airfoil analysis module, and an\noptimizer. The framework is completely modular and is parametric in nature. This enables the user to\nmodify or replace any method of parameterization, airfoil analysis, or optimizer very easily. During the\ndevelopment process two versions of the framework were developed; one for single-objective design\n(SOD) optimization and a second for multi-objective design (MOD) optimization using the Pareto\nOptimality Principle. Although SOD can be used for multi-objective design with weighted cost functions\nand Overall Evaluation Criteria (OEC), MOD generates a series of optimized airfoils, thus allowing the\ndesigner to select multiple airfoils depending on their preferences.\n\n3\n\nParameterization\n\nThere are numerous methods available for shape parameterization of an airfoil shape. Some of the well\nknown methods are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Discrete Points\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bezier or B-Spline\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cFree-Form\xe2\x80\x9d Representation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Numerically derived orthogonal basis function\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Polynomial Surface Representation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cubic Spline Control Point Representation\n\nFigure 1 Methods of Airfoil Parameterization\n\nEach of these methods has their own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the problems are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High number of design variables\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Discontinuous / irregular geometry\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Inaccurate representation of the leading edge and trailing edge\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Limited design space\nFor aerodynamic design problems with high geometric sensitivity, like natural laminar flow airfoil design,\nthere is a need for a parameterization method which can generate smooth airfoils. The parameterization\nmethod also needs to be physically intuitive so the user can specify physical parameters like leading edge\nradius, boat tail angle, etc. From the optimization point of view, the parameterization method needs to\nrepresent the design space with as few design variables as possible. Kulfan\'s class/shape transformation\n(CST) parameterization method, being one of the ideal methods fulfilling all of these requirements, has\n\n280\n\nbeen used for airfoil parameterization. The CST parameterization method defines a b asic shape with a\nclass function and modifies it to the desired shape with a shape function. The CST method can efficiently\nmodel any airfoil in the entire design space.\n\n3.1 Class/shape transformation (CST) parameterization method for airfoil\nThe general form of the mathematical expression for an airfoil shape is given as:\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xce\x94\xf0\x9d\x91\xa7 \xf0\x9d\x91\x87\xf0\x9d\x90\xb8\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa7\n= \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xef\xbf\xbd \xce\xa3 \xef\xbf\xbd\xf0\x9d\x90\xb4 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd +\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90 \xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\nDefining \xe2\x80\x9cclass function\xe2\x80\x9d, C(x/c) as\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x812\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x811\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd = \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xef\xbf\xbd\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\nand \xe2\x80\x9cshape function\xe2\x80\x9d as\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x86 \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd = \xce\xa3 \xef\xbf\xbd\xf0\x9d\x90\xb4 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\nAn airfoil can be represented by\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xce\x94\xf0\x9d\x91\xa7\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa7 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd = \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd \xf0\x9d\x91\x86\xef\xbf\xbd \xef\xbf\xbd+\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90 \xf0\x9d\x91\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90 \xf0\x9d\x91\x90\nwith N1 = 0.5 and N2 = 1.0 for the class function.\n\nOne way to represent the shape function for an airfoil is with Bernstein polynomials.

Details of the method\nare given in [1].\nThe higher the order of Bernstein polynomial used to define the airfoil, the better the representation of the\nairfoil surface. However, this is accompanied by the cost of a larger number of design variables.\n\n281\n\nFigure 2 Effect of BP order on airfoil shape\n\nAlthough in the current work the CST method has been used to parameterize airfoil, any other\nparameterization method can be easily incorporated in the design framework due to the modular nature of\nthe tool.\n\n4\n\nAirfoil Analysis\n\nIn the framework MSES has been used to carry out aerodynamic analysis of airfoils as well as calculation\nof the transition location. MSES is a coupled viscous/inviscid Euler method for airfoil design and\nanalysis. It employs a streamline based Euler discretization. It uses a two-equation boundary layer\nformulation which is coupled through the displacement thickness and solves simultaneously with a full\nNewton method. A full laminar bubble model in the boundary layer formulation is used for low Reynolds\nnumber flow representation. The turbulent transition prediction is carried out using spatial-amplification\ntheory based on the Orr-Sommerfield equation. Some of the capabilities of MSES are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Subsonic, Transonic and Supersonic Single and Multi-Element Airfoil Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Automatic grid generation using a streamline coordinate solution, allowing the grid to adapt to\nthe evolving flow field\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Forced or free boundary layer transition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transitional separation bubble modeling\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lift and drag predictions to just beyond max Cl\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Blunt trailing-edge treatment\n\n5\n\nParticle Swarming Optimization\n\nThe optimizer starts with randomly distributed particles in the design space known as a swarm. Each\nparticle is modeled by a vector of design parameters representing a particular design. Every individual of\nthe swarm in a multidimensional space has a position and a velocity vector. These particles fly through\nhyperspace and remember the best position that they have seen. Members of a swarm communicate good\npositions to each other and adjust their own position and velocity vector based on these good positions.\nThere are two main ways this communication is accomplished: (i) \xe2\x80\x9cswarm best\xe2\x80\x9d that is known to all (ii)\n\n282\n\n\xe2\x80\x9clocal bests\xe2\x80\x9d are known in neighborhoods of particles. Updating of the position and velocity vector are\ndone at each iteration as follows:\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96+1 = \xf0\x9d\x9c\x94\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 + \xf0\x9d\x91\x901 \xf0\x9d\x91\x9f\xf0\x9d\x91\x96 (\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xe2\x88\x92 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 ) + \xf0\x9d\x91\x902 \xf0\x9d\x91\x9f2 (\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x94\xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xe2\x88\x92 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 )\n\xef\xbf\xbd\n\xef\xbf\xbd\nWhere\n\xe2\x80\xa2 x is the position and v is the velocity vector of the individual particle. The subscripts i and i+1\nstand for the recent and the next (future) iterations, respectively.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xcf\x89 is the inertial constant. Good values are usually slightly less than 1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 c1 and c2 are constants that control how much the particle is directed towards good positions.\nGood values are usually right around 1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 r1 and r2 are random values in the range [0,1].\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xef\xbf\xbd is the best design that the particle has seen.\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xef\xbf\xbd \xf0\x9d\x91\x94 is the global best seen by the swarm.\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\nThe current work used a variant of PSO called Repulsive Particle Swarm method for single objective\noptimization (RPSO). In RPSO, there is an additional chaotic term added to the velocity of each particle\nwhich is effective in finding the global optimum in very complex search spaces, particularly when the\nprocess is caught in a local optimum.\nThe PSO algorithm has also been extended to handle multi-design point optimization. To handle multiple\nobjectives, a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm has been used which\nintegrates Pareto dominance principles into a PSO algorithm for generating Pareto-optimal solutions. A\nCrowding distance mechanism with a mutation operator has been used to maintain the diversity of nondominated solutions in the external archive [2].\n\nFigure 3 MOPSO Process\n\n5.1 Quasi-Random Number Sequence\nThe random number generator is generally used to create an initial swarm population for the optimizer.\nSometimes the random generation does not evenly distribute the particles in the design space, thus biasing\nthe optimizer to regions of the space where particles are clustered together. In the framework the\nHammersley quasi-random sequence has been used to generate the initial population. Since this is a\nquasi-random sequence, it generates a well distributed population which covers the design space evenly.\n\n283\n\nTesting has shown that the quasi-random sequence generator produces similar solutions with different\ntrials.\n\nFigure 4 Comparison of Random number generator\n\n6\n\nAerodynamic Airfoil Design Framework\n\n6.1 Input Required\nThe input parameters required by the framework can be broadly classified into three categories: optimizer\ninput, constraints and objective function, and flight conditions, as listed below.\n6.1.1 Optimizer Inputs:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Number of design variables: In the current framework, BP coefficients are the design variables.\nFitting different categories of airfoils with the CST method, it has been found that Bernstein\npolynomials of order 6 t o 12 fit most of the surfaces with residuals on the order of 10-4 and R2 of\nabove 0.99. In general, surfaces with high modal shapes like the lower surface of supercritical airfoils\nrequire BPs on the order of 10 or above. Although using a larger number of coefficients can reduce\nthe residual, they increase the sensitivity drastically. This is because small changes in coefficients\ncause large changes in shape. Using a higher number of design variables can also drive the optimizer\ntowards unacceptable higher modal (wavy) shapes.\n\nFigure 5 NACA0012 fit CST method and residue plot (BP order= 8)\n\n284\n\nFigure 6 NASA SC(2)-0714 fit CST method and residue plot (BP order= 12)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSwarm Population size: Small population sizes require more iterations (generations) to converge\nwhereas larger populations take a longer time to compute each generation. Based on the user\xe2\x80\x99s\nexperience a population size of 100 to 200 is recommended.\nSize of randomly chosen neighbor (for SO optimizer only): 10 to 30% of the initial population\nsize is recommended.\nNumber of steps for local search by tunneling (for SO optimizer only): Steps of 3 to 5 is\nrecommended.\nMaximum number of generations with same Global Best (for convergence): 50 to 100 a re\nrecommended.\nMaximum number of overall generations: As high as 500 is recommended.\nPercentage perturbation of design variables (BP coefficients) about the baseline airfoil to\ncreate the design space: This defines the initial design space for the optimization process. The\ninitial swarm of particles is generated by perturbing the baseline airfoil with user-defined\npercentage perturbation of the BP coefficients. Analytically, change in BP coefficients by x%\nleads to change in thickness by x%. Since each BP coefficient represents different modes of\ngeometry, perturbing each coefficient with different values leads to different shapes and\nthickness. An initial population of airfoils generated from a baseline airfoil with 13.25c%\nthickness and \xc2\xb110% BP perturbation is shown below. As seen in the histogram plot, the design\nspace ranges from 12.25% c to 14% c which corresponds to change in thickness of -7.5% c to\n+5.6% c.\n\nFigure 7 Design space with BP perturbation of 10%\n\n285\n\nAlthough the optimizer should theoretically be able to reach the global optimum solution for a\ngiven unconstrained problem, a well defined design space is recommended for two reasons. First,\nan optimized airfoil that is close in shape to the baseline airfoil should be generated to maintain\nthe characteristics of the baseline airfoil. Second, it is desirable to avoid airfoils with wavy shapes\nand shapes with upper-lower surface crossover. Unacceptable airfoil shapes in the initial\npopulation lead to failure of cases, thus causing inefficiency in the optimization process. In\ngeneral a higher percentage of BP perturbation also leads to upper-lower surface crossover for\nairfoils with a thin trailing edge. To avoid this, a BP perturbation of 10 to 20% is recommended.\n6.1.2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConstraints and Target Function:\nMaximum thickness\nMinimum thickness\nMinimum Cl required\nMaximum trailing edge thickness\nTarget Performance ( Currently Cl/Cd or Cl3/2/Cd)\n\n6.1.3\n\nFlight Condition(s):\nNumber of flight conditions (only one for SO optimizer)\nAngle of attack at each flight condition\nAltitude at each flight condition\nMach number at each flight condition\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n6.2 Process Flow\nThe process flow of the framework is shown in the flow chart below. The framework reads in a baseline\nairfoil, design parameters, and constraints. It generates the BP coefficients of the baseline airfoil, which\nact as design variables. The baseline BP coefficients are then randomly perturbed to a maximum of user\nspecified percentage perturbation to generate the initial swarm of particles. At each generation, airfoil\nanalysis is carried out to calculate the cost function of each particle. A local tunneling search is also\ncarried out, where the performance of each particle is calculated along its velocity direction to get the best\nposition. After the performance is calculated at each generation, the global best and the local best is\ncalculated. If the global best does not change for N generations, the optimizer terminates. Else, the\nparticles communicate with each other, modify their velocity vectors, and move to the new position. The\nwhole process is then repeated.\n\n286\n\nFigure 8 Process Flow of framework\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned process, the multi-objective optimizer, MOPSO, performs a few more\nsteps. Depending upon t he number of design conditions, multiple analyses are carried out for a given\nparticle in the MOPSO method. After the fitness calculation in each generation, MOPSO archives the\nparticles which have Pareto dominance, and these particles form the Pareto Frontier. In addition to global\nbest and local best positions, the velocity vector of all particles is also influenced by the particles at the\nPareto frontier. Finally, the user is provided choices based on the number of airfoils that lie on the Pareto\nFrontier.\n\n7\n\nResults\n\nCase 1: Single Design Point Optimization: Optimization has been carried out with the H213\n\nairfoil as the baseline at a design angle of attack of 2o, Mach number = 0.7, and altitude = 30,000 ft. A\nthickness constraint of \xc2\xb15% of baseline and minimum lift coefficient of Clbaseline has been used.\nMaximization of Cl3/2/Cd has been used as the cost function. To attain at least 50% laminar flow, a\ntransition trip of Xtrup = 0.5c for upper surface and Xtrlo = 0.3 c for the lower surface has been used.\nThree trials have been carried out with a particle population size of 100. As seen in the plot below, shapes\nof the optimized airfoils from each trial are very close to each other. Similarity in trends has also been\nfound in the pressure distribution. All of the optimized airfoils have lift coefficients higher than the\nbaseline, and the performance (Cl3/2/Cd) has improved by almost 100%.\n\n287\n\nFigure 9 Airfoils optimized from H213\n\nFigure 10 Performance of optimized airfoils with respect to baseline (H213) airfoil\n\nOff-design-condition performance:\nAnalysis of an optimized airfoil (trial-1) has been carried out at off-design Mach numbers of 0.6 and 0.8\nand at various angles of attack. It has been found that performance of the optimized airfoil is better than\nthe baseline airfoil around the design angle of attack for Mach numbers of 0.7 and higher. The baseline\nperforms relatively better than the optimized airfoil for lower Mach numbers. Nevertheless, the optimized\nairfoil has been found to be robust close to the design condition.\n\nFigure 11 Off-design performance of optimized airfoil\n\n288\n\nCase 2: Family of optimized thick airfoils: Optimization has been carried out to generate\nthick/thin airfoils from a given baseline airfoil. One option is to scale up/down the baseline airfoil to a\ndesired thickness and then optimize the scaled airfoil. The second option is to scale up/down the baseline\nairfoil in steps, optimize the intermediate airfoil, and then use the optimized airfoil as the baseline for the\nnext step. The second method generates a family of optimized thick airfoils from a given baseline.\n\nFigure 12 Design strategy for thick/thin airfoils\n\nThe second option has been used to generate optimized airfoils for thicknesses from 12 to 17%. The H213\nairfoil (13.25%c thick) has been used as a baseline. Design angle of attack of 2o with Mach number of 0.7\nand altitude of 30,000 ft has been used. A turbulent transition point of 0.5c for the upper surface and 0.3c\nfor the lower surface has been used to attain at least 50% laminar flow for the upper surface. The\noptimized airfoil and performance improvement is shown in the plot below. The performance of the\noptimized airfoil has been found to be improved by more than 100% in some of the cases. The\npercentage improvement was higher for thicker airfoils.\n\nFigure 13 Family of optimized thick airfoils\n\nThe optimized airfoils were then analyzed at off-design angles of attack at a Mach number of 0.7 and\naltitude of 30,000 ft. The optimized airfoil improves performance at the design angle of attack, but at offdesign angle of attack, performance degrades significantly, as seen in the plot below. It has been found\n\n289\n\nthat the optimized airfoils were highly sensitive at off-design angles of attack causing flow instability and\nearly transition.\n\nFigure 14 Degradation of performance of optimized airfoils at off design condition\n\nTo analyze the worst-case scenario, analyses have been carried out using optimized airfoils with turbulent\ntransition location at 0.2c for the upper surface. As seen in the plot below, the performance of the\noptimized airfoils was sharply degraded for this lower turbulent transition location.\n\nFigure 15 Degradation of performance of optimized airfoil at early transition\n\nBased on the above results, the design strategy has been revised to optimize airfoils for lower transition\nlocation (0.2c or lower) and then select the airfoil with maximum laminar flow in free transition among\nthe best candidate airfoils in the final population. The new design strategy has been carried out to\noptimize airfoils for 14% thickness with cost function of maximizing Cl/Cd at a design angle of attack of\n2o, Mach number = 0.7, and altitude of 30,000 ft. The five best airfoils have been selected from the final\npopulation. Analysis of all selected airfoils has been carried out for a number of angles of attack while\nkeeping the transition location for the upper surface at 0.2c. As seen in the plots below, the selected\nairfoils are similar in shape, and all of them perform better than the baseline airfoil at and around design\nangles of attack.\n\n290\n\nFigure 16 Optimized airfoil and performance with revised design guideline\n\nOptimized airfoils have also been analyzed at free transition to calculate the performance and natural\nturbulent transition location. As seen in the plots below, the airfoils have been found to be robust at and\naround the design angle of attack with free transition location close to the baseline at around 0.5c.\n\nFigure 17 Performance of optimized airfoils at free transition\n\nThe results found above support the revised design strategy of designing airfoils for a lower transition\npoint. Thus, this design guideline has been used for all studies mentioned below.\n\nCase 3: Optimization with new design guideline: Optimization of a 14% thick airfoil has been\ncarried out with the H213 airfoil as the baseline at Mach number = 0.7 and altitude = 30,000 ft with\ndesign angles of attack of 1.0o, 1.5o and 2.0o to verify the new design guideline. The optimized airfoils at\neach design angle of attack and performance of the airfoils at various angles of attacks is plotted below. It\nhas been found that the leading edge radius of the optimum decreases as the design angle of attack\nincreases. Each airfoil has been optimized at its respective design angle of attack while performing better\nor close to the baseline at off-design angles of attack. Comparison of pressure distributions and moment\ncoefficients with the baseline is also shown below. All of the optimized airfoils have lower pressures at\nthe leading edge, suggesting flow acceleration at the leading edge. The pitching moment of the optimized\nairfoil at 1.5 o has been found to be close to the baseline, whereas the other airfoils have slightly higher\npitching moments. Free transition performance also demonstrated robustness of the optimized airfoils; all\nof the airfoils have free transition location at 0.5c or higher. The airfoil optimized at 1.0 o has a slightly\nearlier transition location compared to the others. This is due to early shock formation on that particular\n\n291\n\nairfoil. The robustness of the airfoils designed at different angles of attack supports the new design\nguidelines.\n\nFigure 18 Optimized airfoils at angle of attack of 1.0o, 1.5o and 2.0o respectively\n\nFigure 19 Pressure distribution and pitching moment of optimized airfoils\n\nFigure 20 Free transition performance of optimized airfoils\n\n292\n\nCase 4: Multi-design-point optimization: Multi-design-point optimization has been carried out\nto generate 14% thick airfoils at design angles of attack of 1.0o and 2.0o, with the H213 airfoil as the\nbaseline airfoil, at Mach number = 0.7 a nd altitude = 30,000 f t. For this optimization problem MultiObjective Particle Swarming Optimization (MOPSO) has been used. The target function of maximizing\nCl/Cd has been used for optimization. The evolution of the Pareto Front with generations is shown below.\nThree airfoils from the Pareto Front have been selected for further analysis. The three airfoils have been\nreferred to as Optz-AA (best airfoil at 1.0o), Optz-BB (best airfoil at 2.0o) and Optz-AB (compromised\nsolution).\n\nFigure 21 Evolution of Pareto Front with generation and selection of optimized airfoils\n\nAs seen in the Cl/Cd vs angle of attack plot below, Optz-AA performs best at 1.0o while Optz-BB\nperforms best at 2.0o. Optz-AB, being the compromised solution, obtains the best at both 1.0o and 2.0o.\nAll of the three airfoils have been found to have free transition location at around 0.5c.\n\nFigure 22 Performance and transition location of optimized airfoils\n\nComparison of pressure distributions shows improvement in pressures at the leading edge while\nmaintaining a pressure profile similar to the baseline. The shock location was found to move forward for\nall of the optimized airfoils at an angle of attack of 2.0o, which is also evident in an earlier transition\nlocation compared to the baseline.\n\n293\n\nFigure 23 Pressure distribution of optimized airfoils\n\nPitching moments of all of the optimized airfoils has been found to be close to baseline airfoil.\n\nFigure 24 Pitching moment variation with angle of attack of optimized airfoils\n\nCase 5: Comparison of Multi-design-point optimization: Two additional multi-design-point\n\noptimizations of the 14% thick airfoil have been carried out and compared with the case 4 airfoil. The\nfirst one has been carried out with design points at 1.5o and 2.0o and the second one at 1.0o, 1.5o, and 2.0o.\nAll of the other parameters were set to the same values as in case 4. To select an airfoil from the Pareto\nfrontier, the closest Euclidean distance from the target optimum airfoil has been used. For the current\ncase, target optimum performance is equal to 20% improvement in the baseline performance at a given\nangle of attack.\n\n294\n\nFigure 25 Selection procedure of optimized airfoils and selected optimized airfoils\n\nAs seen in the plot below, the performance of each of the optimized airfoils is very close to each other.\nEach of the airfoils has been driven towards obtaining the best compromised solution at their multidesign-point angles of attack. All of the airfoils have almost the same pitching moment at various angles\nof attack while Optz-1.0/1.5/2.0 have the lowest of all.\n\nFigure 26 Performance of selected optimized airfoils and pitching moment variation\n\nFigure 27 Pressure variation of optimized airfoils\n\n295\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nA framework for the direct design of airfoils has been developed to generate globally optimized airfoils.\nThe significance of the method is that it\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n9\n\ncombines the direct airfoil design method with a global optimization method\ndoes not require any prior expertise to predict target pressure distributions on airfoils\nis fully automated and can be modified for any target performance objective and constraints\nhas the capability to generate families of optimized airfoils with a range of thickness from a given\nbaseline airfoil\nhas also been extended to multi-design-point optimization\n\nReference:\n1) Brenda M.

Introduction\nDuring the aircraft conceptual design stage, the lifting-surface planforms must be sized\nfor particular mission capabilities and performance objectives. Lifting-surface performance\npredictions may be obtained by employing historical data analyses, analytic methods, or lowfidelity analyses. The use of historical data could be unreliable for the design of novel aircraft\nconfigurations, whereas analytic methods and low-fidelity analyses may only provide crude\napproximations. High-fidelity tools, such as Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) methods have developed to the point where full aircraft configurations can\nbe analyzed routinely. But due to the level of geometric detail, time, and resources required for\nuseful CFD solutions, it is still restrictive in the early design phases. The current work attempts\nto bridge the gap by applying a modern lifting-line method, developed by Phillips and Snyder,1\nto multiple-lifting-surface configurations and by extending it to transonic speeds.\nThe modern lifting-line method is based on vortex potential flow, thus, applications have\nbeen limited to inviscid and incompressible flow conditions. The accuracy of the method has\nbeen shown for swept wings at low speeds in Ref. 1, but it has not demonstrated numerical\npredictions for multiple-lifting-surface cases or attempted an extension to transonic speeds. In\nthis work, it is assumed that incorporation of viscous, compressible airfoil data will enable\napplication of the modern lifting-line method to flight conditions in the compressibility\ndominated transonic regime. The key concept behind this assumption is that the induced velocity\nproduced by a vortex may not be greatly influenced by compressibility. This concept is partially\nbased on t he work by Aboelkassem and Vatistas,2 where it was shown that compressibility\naffects the radial and axial velocity components of a strong vortex but not the tangential velocity.\nThe first part of this paper provides a brief summary of the modern-lifting line method.\nThis method is capable of analyzing individual or multiple-lifting-surface systems with arbitrary\nsweep, dihedral, twist, and chord length distribution. Results are then presented for validation\ncases, and discrepancies between lifting-line predictions and experimental data are identified.\nPossible sources for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, the methodology for the planform\ndesign tool is presented.\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\xcc\x85\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xf0\x9d\x90\xb7\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xf0\x9d\x91\x91\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\xf0\x9d\x91\x99\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x91\xf0\x9d\x90\xb4\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x91\xf0\x9d\x90\xb9\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x9d\xf0\x9d\x90\xa5\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xab\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xae\xf0\x9d\x91\x8e\n\nNomenclature\nLocal aerodynamic mean chord length\nDrag coefficient of lifting-surface(s) based on wing reference area\nLift coefficient of lifting-surface(s) based on wing reference area\nAirfoil drag coefficient\nAirfoil lift coefficient\nLocal differential planform area\nDifferential aerodynamic force vector\nDirected differential vortex filament length vector\nRadius vector from a vortex filament to an arbitrary point in space\nUnit vector normal to local chord line\n\n300\n\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xae\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xae\xe2\x88\x9e\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xe2\x88\x9e\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xaf\n\xce\xb1\n\xce\x93\n\xce\x9b\n\xcf\x81\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x96, \xf0\x9d\x91\x97\n\nUnit vector parallel to local chord line\nDimensionless freestream velocity vector\nFreestream velocity vector\nDimensionless induced velocity\nAngle of attack\nVortex strength\nLeading edge sweep angle\nDensity of freestream flow\n\nSubscript\n1,2\n\nHorseshoe vortex indices\nHorseshoe vortex nodal points\n\nII. Modern Lifting-Line Model\nThe fundamental physical model of the modern lifting-line method involves the synthesis\nof a finite lifting-surface by discrete horseshoe vortex filaments, as shown in Figure 1. Adjacent\nhorseshoe vortex corners are illustrated as being spaced apart, but this is simply for the purpose\nof visualization. With the exception of the wing tips, the inboard corner of one horseshoe vortex\nis coincident with the outboard corner of the adjacent horseshoe vortex. The bound portion of\neach horseshoe vortex is aligned with a constant-chord position, typically chosen to be quarterchord, and the trailing segments of each horseshoe vortex are aligned with the freestream flow\ndirection.\nFigure 2a illustrates the geometry of a segment of an arbitrarily curved, infinite vortex\nfilament. In the figure, r is a radius vector from the directed segment of the filament dl to point\nP. The Biot-Savart law, Eq. (1),3 is employed to calculate the velocity induced at a point P by\nthe vortex filament with circulation strength \xce\x93.\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x9d\xf0\x9d\x90\x95 =\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\xa4 \xf0\x9d\x90\x9d\xf0\x9d\x90\xa5 \xc3\x97 \xf0\x9d\x90\xab\n4\xf0\x9d\x9c\x8b |\xf0\x9d\x90\xab|3\n\n(1)\n\nFigure 1.

Lifting-line results\n\n303\n\nThe modern lifting-line method has been employed for analysis of two configurations with\nmultiple lifting-surfaces, two transonic transport aircraft models, and a swept wing model in\ntransonic flow.

Each lifting-surface was composed of multiple 2D sections, and\nairfoil polars were generated by one of the airfoil design and analysis codes XFOIL4 and\nMSES.5 Both codes are capable of modeling compressible, viscous flows, but XFOIL is\nunreliable at transonic speeds.\nDuring the validation process, it was discovered that the lifting-line method accurately\naccounts for lift reduction due to sweep but not the reduction in drag. Thus, as an approximation,\nall the MSES airfoil pressure drag data was modified for sweep using a rule of cosine method\npresented in Ref. 6. The effective airfoil drag was computed using Eq. (10), below.\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x91\x91 \xf0\x9d\x91\x92\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x92\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\xf0\x9d\x91\xa1\xf0\x9d\x91\x96\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3\xf0\x9d\x91\x92 = \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x91\x91 \xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x9f\xf0\x9d\x91\x96\xf0\x9d\x91\x90\xf0\x9d\x91\xa1\xf0\x9d\x91\x96\xf0\x9d\x91\x9c\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b + \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x91\x91 \xf0\x9d\x91\x9d\xf0\x9d\x91\x9f\xf0\x9d\x91\x92\xf0\x9d\x91\xa0\xf0\x9d\x91\xa0\xf0\x9d\x91\xa2\xf0\x9d\x91\x9f\xf0\x9d\x91\x92 cos3 \xf0\x9d\x9b\xac\n\n(10)\n\nA. Wing-Canard Configuration\n\nThe first multiple-lifting-surface test case is a rectangular wing and canard configuration,\nas shown in Figure 3 This model was tested in the NASA Ames 7 \xc3\x97 10 foot wind tunnel by\nFeistel, Corsiglia, and Levin,7 to study wing-canard positioning. Two canard longitudinal stagger\npositions were tested along with three vertical wing positions. Both lifting-surfaces were\nconstructed from the NASA/LANGLEY LS(1)-0413 (GA(W)-2) airfoil section, and the canard\nwas mounted with an incidence of 2\xc2\xb0 relative to the wing. Neither surface had sweep or dihedral.\nThe wind tunnel Reynolds number based on wing chord was 1.4 \xc3\x97 106 and the dynamic pressure\nwas 60 lb/ft2.\n\nFigure 3. Wing-canard model top view (a) and side view (b) (from Ref. 7).\n\nThe short-stagger, high-wing setup was chosen as the most challenging validation case\nbecause significant interference effects between the wing and canard were exhibited in the wind\ntunnel. The less difficult configurations were also analyzed and results showed good agreement,\n\n304\n\nbut they are not reported here. Figure 4 shows the results of the experiment and the lifting-line\ncode for this case. All airfoil polars used to analyze the wing-canard model were generated by\nXFOIL. The lifting-line prediction in Figure 4a agrees well with the wind tunnel data over the\nmajority of positive angles of attack up to stall. However, the code predicted stall at an angle of\nattack beyond the experimental result. Individual measurements for the wing and canard are also\nshown, and although the lifting-line method did not accurately predict the lift on each surface,\nthe sum of the two is acceptable. The drag polar lifting-line data in Figure 4b demonstrate decent\nconcurrence with the experiment for moderate lift values. Wind tunnel wall corrections were not\napplied to the data, and this may have been a large factor in the discrepancy at higher lift values.\n\nFigure 4. Wing-canard lift-curve comparison (a) and drag polar comparison (b) for the short-stagger, high-wing\nconfiguration.\n\nB. Three-Lifting-Surface Business Jet\n\nThe second multiple-surface case is a typical business jet geometry with the addition of a\ncanard, as can be seen in Figure 5. The model was tested in the Texas A&M University 2.13 \xc3\x97\n3.05 meter low-speed wind tunnel by Ostowari and Naik8 using a 0.15 scale model. The test\nReynolds number based on w ing mean aerodynamic chord was 1.3 \xc3\x97 106 and the dynamic\npressure was 45 lb/ft2. The aspect ratios of the wing, horizontal tail, and canard were 7.2, 4, and\n5.3, respectively. The wing was constructed from a modified NACA 64A109 airfoil and had a\ndihedral of 2.5\xc2\xb0 and no twist. The quarter-chord wing sweep was 12.7\xc2\xb0. The horizontal tail and\ncanard were constructed from the NACA 64A008 airfoil and neither had dihedral or twist.\nQuarter-chord sweep angles for the horizontal tail and canard were 25\xc2\xb0 and 30\xc2\xb0, respectively.\nThe incidence of the horizontal tail and canard were variable. Two canards were used for the\ntest; one with a span equivalent to the horizontal tail span, and another with a span of 75% of the\nhorizontal tail span. The horizontal tail was tested at two vertical gap positions, as illustrated in\nFigure 5. Also, the fuselage was built with a removable extension for testing two stagger lengths\nbetween the wing and canard.\nA lifting-line analysis was performed on t he business jet model with short fuselage\nstagger, high horizontal tail at -2\xc2\xb0 incidence, and the large canard at 0\xc2\xb0 incidence. The precise\nmodifications applied to the wind tunnel model wing airfoil were not known, thus, a standard\n\n305\n\nNACA 64A109 airfoil geometry was used in the analysis. All airfoil polars were generated using\nMSES, which had difficulty converging at post-stall angles of attack. A comparison of the wind\ntunnel data and lifting-line analysis is in Figure 6. It is evident that the lifting-line method\naccurately predicted the lift values in the linear region of the curve, but the solution did not\nprovide correct stall behavior. The lifting-line code was known to be sensitive near stall for one\nlifting-surface, so the erratic behavior in the plot was not unexpected considering that this is a\nsystem of three surfaces with complex interactions. Additionally, it is suspected that the lack of\nairfoil data at post-stall angles of attack played a strong role in this behavior. When airfoil data\nwas not available at a particular angle of attack, the lifting-line code extrapolated airfoil lift\nvalues based on t he nearest lift-curve slope. An appropriate comparison of drag data was not\npossible for this case since the fuselage was present in the wind tunnel tests.\n\nFigure 5. Business jet geometry (from Ref. 8).\n\nFigure 6. Business jet lift-curve comparison for the short fuselage, high horizontal tail, and large canard model.\n\nC. High Aspect Ratio Supercritical Wing with Fuselage\nThe first transonic case that the lifting-line code was validated against is a supercritical wing and\nfuselage model, designated as SCW-1a in a wind tunnel investigation by Bartlett.9 All wind\n\n306\n\ntunnel tests were performed in the NASA Langley 8 foot transonic pressure tunnel. The SCW-1a\nmodel had an aspect ratio of 11.954, and the aircraft model geometry is illustrated in Figure 7.\nThe tests were run at various Mach numbers and a unit Reynolds number of 5 \xc3\x97 106 per foot.\nBoundary-layer transition was fixed on all of the model components.\nFor the lifting-line analysis, the SCW-1a wing geometry was modeled with three\nsupercritical airfoils using the coordinates provided in Ref. 9. All airfoil polars were generated\nby MSES using the prescribed transition locations also found in the report. The inboard airfoil\nsection defined at the wing-body intersection was used to model the wing at the aircraft model\ncenterline. Lifting-line analyses were executed for Mach numbers of 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, and 0.8, and\nthe lift-curve results are shown in Figure 8. Although the lifting-line prediction did not capture\nall of the minor non-linearity present in the wind tunnel data, the agreement at Mach 0.6 and 0.7\nis excellent. The portion of the Mach 0.75 l ift curve below approximately 2.5\xc2\xb0 angle of attack\nalso shows a favorable match but premature stall was predicted. At Mach 0.8, t he lifting-line\nmethod did not predict a lift-slope match as well as at lower Mach numbers. Drag polars were\nnot compared because of the presence of the fuselage in the wind tunnel model.\n\nFigure 7. SCW-1a geometry front and side views (a) and top view (b) (from Ref. 9).\n\n307\n\nFigure 8. SCW-1a lift-curve comparisons.\n\nD. Wing-body Configuration from the 1st AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop\nThe wing-body model used for analysis in the 1st AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop\nwas selected as a transonic test case for the lifting-line method. The German Aerospace Research\nCenter DLR-F4 geometry, seen in Figure 9, and wind tunnel results from three sources were\ndocumented by Redeker10 for use as a C FD validation test case. The wind tunnel tests were\ncarried out at a range of transonic Mach numbers and at a Reynolds number based on wing mean\ngeometric chord of 3 \xc3\x97 106. Boundary-layer transition was fixed on the fuselage as well as the\nupper and lower wing surfaces.\n\n308\n\nFigure 9. DLR-F4 wing-body geometry (from Ref. 10).\n\nThe DLR-F4 wing was modeled for the lifting-line analysis using four airfoils, and the\ncoordinates for each airfoil were supplied as part of the workshop. All airfoil polars were\ncomputed with MSES using the fixed transition locations documented in Ref. 10. The inboard\nairfoil section defined at the wing-body intersection was used at the aircraft model centerline in\nthe absence of a fuselage. A lifting-line analysis was completed for Mach numbers 0.6, 0.75, and\n0.8, and the lift curves and drag polars are in Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12. All\nexperimental data in Figure 10 and Figure 12 are from the NLR-HST tests documented in Ref.\n10. The drag polars shown include the lifting-line results for the wing-alone as well as with the\naddition of body-alone experimental drag of 90 counts for all Mach numbers. Adding the body\ndrag in this manner is a conservative estimate considering that the drag of the wing that would be\nhidden by the fuselage was included in the lifting-line analyses.\nFor the Mach 0.6 case, the lift values in Figure 10a were slightly over-predicted over the\nentire curve. However, the lift-curve slope for a linear curve fit between -2\xc2\xb0 and 3\xc2\xb0 angle of\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\nattack was \xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x9b\xbc\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf = 0.0912 per degree for the lifting-line result and \xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x9b\xbc\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf = 0.0929 per degree for the\nwind tunnel data. The Mach 0.6 drag predictions in Figure 10b follow the wind tunnel trend very\nwell. The Mach 0.75 lifting-line results were compared with all of the workshop CFD data as\nwell as the wind tunnel data, as can be seen in Figure 11. Similar to the previous test case results,\nthe lifting-line method predicted an early stall in Figure 11a. A linear curve fit of the wind tunnel\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\ndata from -2\xc2\xb0 to 1\xc2\xb0 angle of attack resulted in a lift-curve slope of \xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x9b\xbc\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf = 0.1216 per degree while\nthe lifting-line slope was \xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x9b\xbc\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf = 0.1019 per degree. A linear curve fit of the lifting-line results\nfrom -3\xc2\xb0 to -1\xc2\xb0 angle of attack was also computed and the result matched the wind tunnel value\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\nof \xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x9b\xbc\xf0\x9d\x90\xbf = 0.1216 per degree. The drag predictions in Figure 11b deviated at higher lift values but\nare still acceptable for design purposes. A trend similar to that seen in the previous case was\nfound for the Mach 0.8 lift-curve results in Figure 12a as well. A majority of the lift values were\nunder-predicted, and the shape of the curve was not well-matched. The drag predictions in Figure\n12b were high even before the body drag was added. This trend was caused by the under\nprediction of lift compared with the wind tunnel results.\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6\n\n309\n\nFigure 10.

DLR-F4 lift curves (a) and drag polars (b) for M = 0.8.\n\nE. Transonic Swept Wing\nThe final validation case is a swept, tapered wing wind tunnel model. The model is from\nan experimental investigation by Polhamus and King12 in which the aerodynamic characteristics\nof three wings with different aspect ratios were evaluated. The wings were constructed from\nNACA 631012 airfoils and swept back 45\xc2\xb0. The wing model selected for validation had an aspect\n\n311\n\nratio of 8 and a taper ratio of 0.45. Tests were performed in the NASA Langley 7- by 10-foot\ntunnel at Mach numbers ranging from 0.7 to 1.15 and a Reynolds number of 570,000.\nRef. 12 did not report fixed boundary-layer transition points. A transition location of 15%\nchord was assumed for the MSES airfoil analysis. Lifting-line analyses were completed for Mach\nnumbers 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. The results comparisons are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, and Figure\n15. The Mach 0.7 lifting-line lift curve and drag polar demonstrated excellent agreement with the\ntrends seen in the experimental data. Although the lift values were slightly over-predicted at\npositive angles of attack, the shape of the stall curve was followed very well. The Mach 0.8\npredictions are promising because the lift-curve slope predicted by the lifting-line method is not\nsignificantly different from the experimental data. The drag polar at Mach 0.8 was predicted\naccurately up t o a lift coefficient of approximately 0.12, but beyond this point, the drag was\nover-predicted. At Mach 0.9, the lift curve was predicted with more accuracy than shown for the\nprevious transonic cases. However, the drag polar demonstrated a large over-prediction at all lift\nvalues.\n\nFigure 13. Transonic swept wing lift curves (a) and drag polars (b) for M = 0.7.\n\n312\n\nFigure 14. Transonic swept wing lift curves (a) and drag polars (b) for M = 0.8.\n\nFigure 15. Transonic swept wing lift curves (a) and drag polars (b) for M = 0.9.\n\nIV. Discussion of Lifting-Line Test Case Results\nThe largest discrepancies observed in the multiple-lifting-surface cases were present in\nthe stall region of the lift curves. For the wing-canard model, the late stall prediction was\napparent in the individual wing and canard contributions. This was most likely caused by late\nstall predictions from XFOIL. The drag polar prediction may have also been affected by the\nairfoil data. As previously mentioned, the three-lifting surface business jet case exhibited an\nerratic stall curve, but this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely unanticipated. However, predictions for both cases\nwere excellent in the linear regions of the lift curves. The wing-canard model also exhibited\ndiscrepancies in the individual component lift curves. Further work should include additional\nverification of the method\xe2\x80\x99s capability to capture interference effects.\nThe transport-type aircraft model predictions were satisfactory at lower transonic speeds,\nbut they diverged from experimental data as the Mach number increased above 0.75. It is\nsuspected that a combination of problems created the degradation of the results at higher Mach\nnumbers. One major consideration is that the fuselage was not and could not be included in the\nlifting-line analyses. With increasing Mach number, the fuselage interference effects may have\nbecome quite significant. In a commercial transport design study by Jameson,13 he notes that the\nfuselage can contribute approximately 15% of the total aircraft lift. The design speed range in the\nstudy was between Mach numbers 0.8 a nd 0.9. In an experimental study by Danforth and\nO\xe2\x80\x99Bryan,14 static pressure was measured with a wing-tip boom installed on a fighter aircraft wind\ntunnel model. The freestream Mach number was set at various transonic speeds. The results\nshowed a deviation in the pressure coefficient measured at the boom, due to fuselage effects,\nbeginning at approximately Mach 0.75. A similar trend could have affected the results for the\ntransonic transport-type aircraft comparisons. Future work should compare CFD predictions for\nthe transport-type aircraft models with and without the fuselage present. A method for modeling\na fuselage must also be addressed. Although discrepancies were present in the lifting-line results,\nit is encouraging that the method predicted lift and drag values at Mach 0.75 within the range of\n\n313\n\nCFD computations from the 1st AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop (see Figures 11a and\n11b). The last validation case provided evidence that the lift-curve slope can be predicted at\ntransonic speeds with more accuracy when a fuselage is not present. However, the drag polar\ndiscrepancies were larger as the Mach number increased for the final two cases. It is suspected\nthat this was due to the MSES airfoil drag predictions.\nEach test case presented in this work took no more than a few hours to set up t he\ngeometry inputs, run the airfoil analyses, and execute the lifting-line code. As a comparison,\nmultiple days would be required for CFD geometry creation, meshing, and solution convergence.\nWith further validation and verification and incorporation of a fuselage modeling method, this\ntool will serve as a powerful conceptual design tool.\n\nV. Planform Design Tool\nThe modern lifting-line code serves as the foundation for the planform design capability.\nIn fact, the planform design code simply generates a s eed geometry and executes an optimizer\nwhich receives objective function values from the modern lifting-line code. This portion of the\nreport explains how the design tool is set up.\nA. Optimization Routine\nThe optimization routine, developed by Vanderplaats,15 employs sequential quadratic\nprogramming with the modified method of feasible directions for solving the direction-finding\nsubproblem. For one-dimensional search, the optimizer uses polynomial interpolation with\nbounds. Gradients are obtained by a forward difference formula using a step size of 0.1% of the\ndesign variable, with 0.001 being the lower bound on t he step size. The objective function\noptions available include maximization of either \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf /\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xb7 or \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf 3/2 /\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xb7 .\nB. Fixed Inputs\n\nMany inputs to the modern lifting-line code have been fixed in the planform design tool.\nThe following is a complete list of these inputs:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAirfoil data\nFlight Mach number and altitude (incorporated in airfoil data)\nNumber of lifting surfaces\nSpans and reference areas of all lifting surfaces\nRelative locations of all lifting surfaces\nConfiguration angle of attack\nNumber of spanwise breaks for each lifting surface\nSpanwise distribution of the input airfoils (the order they follow as a function of span)\nNumber of horseshoe vortex elements used to synthesize each lifting surface\nAngle between trailing edge and aircraft centerline out to a set break location for Yehudi\n(optional)\n\n314\n\nC. Design Variables\nThe available design variables offer full flexibility of the planform geometry. Note that\nthe optimizer normalizes each of these variables for use in the optimization routine. Chord\nlengths are normalized by an average chord, which is calculated as reference area divided by\nspan. Additionally, the tip chord length is calculated during the optimization to ensure that a\nfixed reference area is maintained. Design variables include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBreak span positions (normalized by half of the span)\nChord length at each break other than the tip (normalized by average chord)\nSweep angle at each break (normalized by half of the span)\nDihedral angle at each break, out of the page in Figure 16 (normalized by half of the\nspan)\nTwist angle at each break (normalized by a reference value of 10\xc2\xb0)\n\nFigure 16. Illustration of design variable definitions.\n\nIf a Yehudi is present in the design, the code will not change the span location of breaks\nthat are part of the Yehudi portion of the wing. Also, the chords, sweeps, and dihedrals of breaks\nthat are part of the Yehudi will be calculated to maintain straight leading and trailing edges.\nOutboard of the Yehudi, the design variables are treated normally.\nD. Constraints\nThe flexibility offered by the design variables can often lead to undesirable solutions.\nHus, constraint options have been implemented in the planform design code to enable more\ncontrol. The available constraints include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum leading edge sweep angle\nMinimum dihedral angle\nMaximum and minimum configuration \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf\nMinimum taper ratio\nMaximum and minimum twist angle\nRequire each chord length to be smaller than the adjacent inboard chord length (optional)\n\n315\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor a Yehudi geometry, require the root chord length to be at least as long as the baseline\ngeometry\n\nIn addition to the above list, four options are available for controlling the leading and trailing\nedge sweeps. The options are listed below from most to least flexible.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVariable sweep at each break location\nMaintain straight leading edge\nMaintain straight leading edge and trailing edge\nFixed leading edge sweep angle\n\nE. Initialization\nTwo planform options are offered for initialization of the wing geometry; with Yehudi or\nstraight and tapered. In both cases, all leading edge sweeps and dihedrals are set at the input\nminimum constraints. The initialized root chord length is set to the baseline, and the tip chord is\ncalculated using the input starting taper ratio. All intermediate chords are computed based on\nlinear interpolation. Then, all chord lengths are scaled to satisfy the input reference area.\n\nVI. Planform Design Tool Sample Results\nA sample case has been optimized with various settings to test the design tool. The\nbaseline model used is the DLR-F4 geometry from Ref. 10. The minimum allowable leading\nedge sweep was set at the baseline value of 27.1\xc2\xb0, and the dihedral angle was set to be fixed for\nall optimization runs at the baseline value of 4.8\xc2\xb0. Bounds were set on the twist angles just\noutside of the maximum and minimum present in the baseline geometry of 5.3\xc2\xb0 and 0.3\xc2\xb0. Flight\nconditions were fixed at a Reynold\xe2\x80\x99s number of 3 \xc3\x97 106, Mach number of 0.75, a nd\nconfiguration angle of attack of -2\xc2\xb0. The objective function maximized for all cases is \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf /\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xb7 ,\nwith the baseline value being 24.01. All airfoil data used in the optimizations is identical to that\nused in the validation study from section III-D of this report.\nA. Straight and Tapered Wing Initialization\nThe following optimization test cases were initialized with a straight and tapered wing\nplanform. Cases are presented for each of the sweep options: variable sweep at each break,\nmaintaining straight leading edge, fixed leading edge sweep, and maintaining straight leading\nedge and trailing edge.\nThe first test case was set up for variable sweep at each break with \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constrained to lie\nbetween the baseline value of 0.356 and 0.365. The initialized planform had a taper ratio of 0.4.\nThe results of the optimization are shown in Figure 17. As anticipated, the flexibility in sweeps\nand the fact that structural considerations were ignored allowed the optimizer to produce a\ngeometry that is probably not practical. However, the gain in the objective for this case was\n5.9%.\n\n316\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n317\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nThe next test case was set up to maintain a straight leading edge with \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constrained to\nlie between the baseline value of 0.356 and 0.365. The initialized planform had a taper ratio of\n0.4. The results of the optimization are shown in Figure 18. It is apparent that requiring a straight\nleading edge produced a geometry that looks more reasonable. A flaw in this design is he high\ntwist angle at approximately 70% span which results in high outboard loading. The gain in the\nobjective for this case was modest at 0.3%.\nFigure 17. Optimization results for straight and tapered initialization with variable sweep at each break.\n\n318\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n319\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nThe following test case was set up to maintain a fixed leading edge with \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constrained to\nlie between the baseline value of 0.356 a nd 0.37. T he initialized planform had a taper ratio of\n0.4. The results of the optimization are shown in Figure 19. This optimized planform\ndemonstrates that the optimizer exploited sensitivities of the chord length variables in the\nabsence of sweep variables. The gain in the objective for this case was the most impressive at\n16.4%.\nFigure 18.

The initialized planform had a\ntaper ratio of 0.4. T he results of the optimization are shown in Figure 20. This optimized\nplanform did not change significantly from the initialized planform. This is attributed to the seed\ngeometry, as will be shown in the next case. The change in the objective for this case was -1.6%.\nFigure 19.

The results of the\noptimization are shown in Figure 21. This optimized planform changed much more significantly\nfrom the initialized planform. Initializing the geometry with a taper ratio of 0.2 and increasing\nthe maximum \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constraint facilitated improvement of the objective. The gain in the objective\nfor this case was 0.8%.\n\n324\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n325\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\nFigure 21.

Wing with Yehudi Initialization\nThe following optimization test cases have been initialized with a Yehudi and straight\nand tapered outboard section planform. As in the previous section, cases are presented for each\nof the sweep options: variable sweep at each break, maintaining straight leading edge, fixed\nleading edge sweep, and maintaining straight leading edge and trailing edge.\nThe first Yehudi test case was set up for variable sweep at each break, not including the\nbreak between the root and Yehudi break, with \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constrained to lie between the baseline value\nof 0.356 a nd 0.37. T he initialized planform had a taper ratio of 0.4. The results of the\n\n326\n\noptimization are shown in Figure 22. The constraint of maintaining the Yehudi layout facilitated\na more realistic optimized planform. The gain in the objective for this case was 1.1%.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n327\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nThe next Yehudi test case was set up to maintain a straight leading edge with \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf\nconstrained to lie between the baseline value of 0.356 and 0.37. The initialized planform had a\ntaper ratio of 0.4. The results of the optimization are shown in Figure 23. As expected based on\nthe previous case, the optimizer very slightly swept the leading edge. The gain in the objective\nfor this case was 0.5%.\nFigure 22.

The initialized planform\nhad a taper ratio of 0.4. The results of the optimization are shown in Figure 24.

T he initialized\nplanform had a taper ratio of 0.2. The results of the optimization are shown in Figure 25. Once\nagain a much improved solution is found by choosing a different initial taper ratio and\nbroadening the \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbf constraint range.

Although using NASTRAN for validation was\nrather straightforward, the use of ZAERO for the SUGAR input files was complex because there\nwere NASTRAN WTFACT files that incorporate the Lift and Moment corrections for\ncompressible flow (including for Mach number 0.82). These corrections were obtained from\nsteady CFD results performed by the Boeing Company. The correct method to incorporate\nthese corrections in NASTRAN unsteady aerodynamics module was utilized for transonic flutter\nanalysis of the SUGAR TBW WTM.\nHowever, ZAERO was used to validate the NASTRAN results \xe2\x80\x93 without applying the correction\nfactors \xe2\x80\x93 and shows good agreement. The flutter analyses were done for the full fuel and the\nresidual fuel cases. The V-g plots for both the cases have been shown in Figure 2.147.\n\n341\n\nFigure 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 V-g Plot for Full Fuel Case with Correction Factors\n\nFigure 2.148 and Figure 2.149 show mode 17 and mode 10, respectively the anti-symmetric\ntorsion and bending modes.\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Primary Flutter Modes for Full Fuel Case a) Mode 10: 1.554 Hz, b) Mode 17: 3.198 Hz.\n\n342\n\nFigure 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 V-g Plot for Residual Fuel Case with Correction Factors\nTable 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Results for Full Fuel Case\n\nFull Fuel case (Boeing results reproduced in col. 2) : Mach = 0.82 at 2% damping\nWith correction factors\nWithout correction factors\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\n3.409\n3.404\n3 .420\n\xcf\x89f, (Hz.)\n(Mode 17)\n(Mode 17 )\n(Mode 17)\nVf , (ft./sec)\n865 fps @ 15687 ft.\n822 fps @ 29084 ft. 825 fps @ 27167 ft.\nTable 2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Results for Full Fuel Case\n\n\xcf\x89f, (Hz.)\nVf , (ft./sec)\n\n1.2\n\nReserve Fuel case: Mach = 0.82 at 2% damping\nWith correction factors\nWithout correction factors\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\n2.747\n2.697\n2.797\n(Mode 14)\n(Mode 13 )\n(Mode 10)\n841 fps @ 22813 ft.\n830 fps @ 25882 ft. 822 fps @ 28158 ft.\n\nThe effects of In-Plane Stresses Obtained from Linear Static Analysis on\nthe Flutter Results of the SUGAR Full Model\n\nFlexible wing structures, like the truss-braced wing configurations, develop in-plane stresses,\ndue to applied lift and inertia relief loads, which can change the geometric stiffness of the\nstructure, thereby changing its natural frequencies. Two load cases were considered, 2.5 g and 1 g (with a factor of safety of 1.5), to investigate the effects of the in-plane stresses on the\nstructural natural modes and on aircraft flutter speed. Results were obtained primarily with\n\n343\n\nNASTRAN; ZAERO was used for this analysis only for cases where no CFD correction factors for\nlift and moment were applied, with these results subsequently validated by running NASTRAN\nfor the same cases. The results obtained for the full fuel case and the reserve fuel case with the\ncorrection factors applied are shown in Figure 2.150 and Figure 2.151. Table 2.27 and Table\n2.28 show the values of the results for the full fuel and the residual fuel cases, respectively,\nwith the correction factors applied to both of them. Table 2.29 shows the effect of in-plane\nstresses on flutter speed obtained without any correction factors by using ZAERO and\nNASTRAN.\n\nFigure 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 V-g Plot for Full Fuel Case with Correction Factors\n\n344\n\nFigure 2.5 \xe2\x80\x93 V-g Plot for Reserve Fuel Case with Correction Factors\nTable 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Results for Full Fuel Case\n\nDamping\n2%\n\nDamping\n2%\n\nFull Fuel case with Correction factors\nNo load\n2.5 g\nMode\n17\n17\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n3.409\n2.933\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n865\n875\nFull Fuel case with Correction factors\nNo load\n2.5 g\nMode\n17\n17\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n3.409\n2.933\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n865\n875\n\n-1 g\n17\n3.263\n835\n-1 g\n17\n3.263\n835\n\nTable 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Results for Residual Fuel Case\n\nDamping\n0%\n2%\n\nReserve Fuel case with Correction factors\nNo load\n2.5 g\nMode\n14\n16\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n2.665\n2.696\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n821\n817\nMode\n14\n15\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n2.747\n2.779\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n841\n852\n\n345\n\n-1 g\n15\n2.653\n824\n19\n5.247\n891\n\nTable 2.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Results for Flutter without Correction Factors\n\nDamping\n0%\n\n2%\n\n1.3\n\nMode\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\nMode\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n\nResults obtained without Correction factors\nNo load\n2.5 g\n-1 g\nFull Fuel Case\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\n17\n17\n14\n10\n17\n3.404\n3.420\n2.792\n2.762\n3.216\n822\n826\n839\n824\n798\nReserve Fuel case\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\n13\n10\n15\n9\n19\n2.697\n2.798\n2.68\n2.775\n5.10\n830\n822\n822\n814\n856\n\nZAERO\n18\n3.245\n810\nZAERO\n20\n5.073\n852\n\nThe Effects of In-Plane Stresses Obtained From Nonlinear Static Analysis\non the Flutter Results of In-house Strut-Braced Wing\n\nHigh aspect ratio truss-braced wings are slender flexible structures that undergo large\ndeformation due to applied loads (like the lift and pitching moment distribution), which linear\nstatic analysis may not portray accurately. The approach discussed in this section was to\nperform nonlinear static analysis of the TBW aircraft and then to investigate the effects of the\nresultant in-plane stresses on the flutter results. The procedure is similar to that discussed in\nsection 2.1.8.10.2; however, the initial static analysis is performed by including geometric\nnonlinearities.\nInitially, several in-house strut braced wing designs were used as test cases to observe the\neffects of large structural deformations on the flutter analysis; these results showed\nconsiderable effect on the flutter speed. Such analysis is still to be performed for the SUGAR\nFEM and will comprise the future work to be performed at Virginia Tech.\n\nFigure 2.6 \xe2\x80\x93 Finite Element Model for SBW Test Case\n\n346\n\nFigure 2.7 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of Flutter with Distributed Pressure on the Wing Planform for Linear and Nonlinear Analysis\nTable 2.6 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of Linear and Nonlinear Flutter Speeds for In House SBW Design\n\nMode\n\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a\xf0\x9d\x9b\x9a \xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (Hz.)\n\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x95\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f\xf0\x9d\x90\x9f (ft./s)\n\n1.4\n\nPressure Distribution Applied 1.325 lbs/Sq.in\nLinear\nNonlinear\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\nNASTRAN\nZAERO\n2\n2\n2\n2\n14.61\n14.64\n12.5\n12.65\n1333\n1366\n1280\n1292\n\nThe Effect of in-plane loads on modal and flutter results of SUGAR TBW\nWind Tunnel Model\n\nAs part of the NASA SUGAR research program, a wind tunnel model has been designed,\nfabricated and tested in the NASA TDT during late 2013 and early 2014. One of the test goals\nwas to evaluate the performance of a scaled model up to the point of flutter instabilities and to\nimplement active flutter control. The flutter analysis presented here was developed to predict\nthe aeroelastic behavior of the WTM under a variety of flight conditions planned for the wind\ntunnel test. The specific beam-rod finite element model utilized for the present study was\ndeveloped by the Boeing Company with the purpose of simulating the TBW wind tunnel model,\nas shown in Figure 2.153. The structural characteristics of the FEM were updated to reflect the\nWTM stiffness distribution as constructed. There are six ballasts with each mass 2.92 lbs.\nlocated at the wing spar to improve the modal similitude with the full-scale FEM. In-plane loads\nwere obtained by performing static structural analysis under flight loads and self-weight.\nGeometrically nonlinearities should be considered in the static analysis due to the large aspect\nratio, 9.52, of the WTM. So, nonlinear static analysis was implemented for in-plane loads. It is\nalso interesting to examine the linear static analysis for in-plane loads for its potential to\nprovide useful estimate of flutter dynamic pressure at reduced computational expense. So,\n\n347\n\nboth linear and nonlinear static analyses were performed for in-plane loads of the WTM under\ndifferent Mach numbers and AoAs.\n\nFigure 2.8 \xe2\x80\x93 The beam-rod FEM, developed by The Boeing Company, used for the present aeroelastic analysis\n\nThe flight conditions utilized for the SUGAR TBW WTM flutter analysis are based on previous\nMDO studies of the full-scale aircraft model when subjected to the flutter speed constraint of\n1.09Vd (Refer to Phase I final report). Results for the full-scale aircraft indicated that the critical\nMach number for flutter was 0.82, when weight factors are applied for both steady and\nunsteady aerodynamic pressure. The aerodynamic weighting factors, also called correction\nfactors, are obtained from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses which can capture\ncompressibility and shock behavior lacking in the doublet-lattice method (DLM) in NASTRAN.\nThe weight factors constitute \xe2\x80\x9cpanel by panel\xe2\x80\x9d corrections to the pressure magnitude and also\nto the lift curve slope. The key behavior captured through addition of the weight factors is the\naft shift in center of pressure (Cp) due to transonic effects. This aft shift in Cp, especially beyond\nMach 0.82, alleviates the flutter instability at higher Mach numbers. The flutter analysis utilized\na non-looping matched-point method, also known as the PKNL method in NASTRAN. The flutter\nsearch included density ratios and velocities spanning the flight envelope. Reduced frequencies\nwere chosen from 0.001 to 10.0 in order to cover the frequency range of interest.\nThe flow chart shown in Figure 2.153 with several analysis steps was developed to conduct prestressed flutter analysis of the SUGAR TBW WTM. Axial forces in the wing components, the\nmain wing, the jury and the strut have considerable effect to the modal information and flutter\nboundary. These axial forces were caused by the flight loads and self-weight of the WTM. The\nobtained axial forces were considered as in-plane loads in the subsequent modal analysis and\nflutter analysis. Flight loads were obtained by performing static aeroelastic analysis (Step\n\n348\n\n\xe2\x91\xa0\xe2\x91\xa1\xe2\x91\xa2\xe2\x91\xa3), and then using linear/nonlinear static analysis to compute the axial forces under\nsuch flight loads (Step \xe2\x91\xa4). Incremental stiffness due to the pre-stress was then incorporated to\nthe structural stiffness to conduct modal analysis and flutter analysis (Step \xe2\x91\xa5and \xe2\x91\xa6). Once\nthe pre-stressed flutter solution is obtained, the dynamic pressure at this new flutter velocity is\nused as an improved estimate for input to the calculation of flight loads in Step \xe2\x91\xa3. Iteration is\nperformed on Steps \xe2\x91\xa3\xe2\x91\xa4\xe2\x91\xa5and \xe2\x91\xa6 until the flutter dynamic pressure converges. The\nallowed convergence criterion in this problem for flutter dynamic pressure is 0.1 psf.\n\nFigure 2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 The flow chart of the NASTRAN based nonlinear aeroelastic solution sequence used for the present work\n\nIt takes time to manually input all the data required to obtain the theoretical predictions of the\nflutter boundaries for all the tests conducted in the wind tunnel for a large set of Mach\nnumbers and angles of attack (AoAs). So, it is necessary to automate the process of analysis,\nincluding generating the flight loads, stresses, incremental stiffness matrix, modal information\nand flutter results, including the determination of the flutter velocity or the flutter dynamic\npressure. The flow chart shown in Figure 2.153 was programmed in MATLAB to perform\naeroelastic analysis of the SUGAR WTM to find the flutter boundary of a pre-stressed WTM. The\npre-stressed flutter dynamic pressure is defined as the dynamic pressure obtained from Step\n\xe2\x91\xa6 which should be exactly the same or very little less than the input dynamic pressure in Step\n\xe2\x91\xa3. This method is called as the Iterative Method.\n\n349\n\nFigure 2.10 \xe2\x80\x93 Iteration framework used to find the flutter boundary in MATLAB environment using NASTRAN based solution\nsequences for flutter analysis\n\nOne alternative method is the Discrete Method as seen in Figure 2.153. In this method, a series\nof separate calculations are performed to obtain the flutter damping corresponding to the\ninput velocity/dynamic pressure in the static aeroelastic analysis, followed by linearly\ninterpolating the data in the V-g plot to find the flutter velocity or flutter dynamic pressure.\nThis method was mainly developed to validate the results obtained from the iterative method\nand to cope with the cases with no convergence obtained when using the iterative method. To\nimplement the discrete method, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to point out the flutter mode in advance to\nobtain the structural damping at that mode, and then plot the V-g graph using the structural\ndamping and input velocity/dynamic pressure. However, the flutter mode could be different at\ndifferent Mach numbers and AoAs. It\xe2\x80\x99s because that incremental stiffness generated could have\ndifferent influence on the modal information and flutter boundary under different dynamic\npressures and AoAs that cause the shift of normal modes. So, it is not easy to recognize the\ncritical mode in advance when using the discrete method for all the cases. However, the flutter\nspeed could be more efficiently obtained once the critical mode is fixed by using parallel\ncomputing for the discrete method for all cases. But when compared with the work using the\niterative method, more computations needed to interpolate an accurate flutter speed from V-g\nplot. In this work, the iterative method was used as primary method to find out the open-loop\nflutter boundaries of the WTM under in-plane loads, and the discrete method was used for\n\n350\n\nvalidation and as an alternative method for cases where convergence could not be obtained\nwhen using the iterative method.\n\nFigure 2.11 \xe2\x80\x93 Flow chart of the discrete method utilized for computing flutter dynamic pressure\n\nThe above SUGAR WTM FEM and analysis procedures were utilized to generate results across a\nrange of AoAs. Parametric studies were performed to examine the influence of aerodynamic\nweighting factors and ballast mass on flutter boundary at Mach No. 0.82. As a preliminary step,\nanalysis of the unloaded model was performed to provide a baseline for comparison to prestressed analyses results. The weight factors are always applied to the steady aerodynamic\npressures in the static aeroelastic analysis in the following work to generate the flight loads in\ntransonic flow regardless of the analysis types. The steady aerodynamic weighting factors could\nalso be used as weight factors for the unsteady aerodynamic pressure. Flutter dynamic\npressure of the cases with weight factors used for the unsteady aerodynamic pressure was\nexamined to validate the use of the steady aerodynamic weighting factors for unsteady\naerodynamic pressure. The case w/WF and w/o WF in the subsequent work means that there\nare weight factors and no weight factors employed for DLM based unsteady aerodynamic\npressure in the flutter analysis, respectively. Flutter boundaries of new WTM FEM versions,\nFEM V19 and V20, were calculated at Mach No. 0.7, 0.76 and 0.82 at AoA ranging from -3\ndegrees AoA to 3 degrees AoA. Comparisons of flutter predictions with test results were\nconducted and some conclusions were made in the summary part.\n\n1.5\n\nTraditional flutter analysis of the unloaded SUGAR WTM\n\nTo investigate the influence of in-plane loads on the modal information and flutter boundaries,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to perform modal analysis and flutter analysis of the unloaded SUGAR WTM. This\nanalysis is considered as a baseline for comparisons to the subsequent pre-stressed modal\nanalysis and flutter analysis. Modal analysis and flutter analysis of the unloaded SUGAR WTM is\na single step in MSC NASTRAN Solution Sequence 103 and 145, since no flight loads and gravity\nloads are considered. The first 4 mode shapes and corresponding natural frequencies were\nshown in Figure 2.153. The first 4 modes are 1st outboard wing bending mode, 1st inboard wing\n\n351\n\nbending mode, 2nd bending mode and 1st torsion mode, respectively. V-g plot and V-f plot of the\nflutter analysis were shown in Figure 2.153 and Figure 2.153. From these two graphs, it was\nfound that the 2nd bending mode (mode 3) and 1st torsion model (mode 4) contribute to the\nflutter instability. 2% modal damping was included in the flutter analysis. From the V-g plot, we\ncan find the curve of mode 3 in the V-g plot crosses zero damping line and produces flutter\ninstability at approximately 120 KEAS.\n\nOutboard wing bending mode, f1=4.91 Hz\n\nInboard wing bending mode, f2=5.60 Hz\n\n2nd bending mode, f3=7.98 Hz\n\n1st torsion mode, f4=10.83 Hz\n\nFigure 2.12 \xe2\x80\x93 The first 4 mode shapes, spline from beam-rod FEM, of the unloaded model FEM V18 with ballast masses 2.92\nlbs.\n\n352\n\nFigure 2.13 \xe2\x80\x93 The velocity vs. structural damping (V-g) plot for the unloaded model indicating that the curve of mode 3\ncrosses zero damping line (flutter instability) at approximate 120 KEAS\n\nFigure 2.14 \xe2\x80\x93 The velocity vs. frequency (V-f) plot for the unloaded model indicating that modes 3 and 4 are coupling to cause\nthe flutter instability\n\n353\n\n1.6 Wing deflection and axial forces\ninvestigation of the SUGAR WTM\nVariations of the deflections of the beam model of the SUGAR WTM with AoA were\ninvestigated using both linear and nonlinear analysis as shown in Figure 2.153. It was seen that\nbeam deflections of the WTM are close to each other using both linear and nonlinear analysis\nfor each AoA. For positive AoAs, the magnitudes of beam deflections as obtained from a linear\nanalysis are a bit larger than those as obtained from a nonlinear analysis. However, for negative\nAoAs, the magnitude of beam deflection as obtained from a nonlinear analysis is a bit larger\nthan that obtained from a linear analysis.\n\nFigure 2.15 \xe2\x80\x93 Wing deflections of the beam model of the SUGAR TBW WTM at AoA = -3, -1, 1 and 3 degrees, Mach No. 0.82\nand ballast mass 2.92 lbs. using both linear and nonlinear analysis (Scale Factor:20)\n\nThe axial forces in the three different components, the jury, the strut and the inboard wing, of\nthe TBW WTM were also investigated as seen in Figure 2.153. The variation of the axial forces\nwith AoA in these three components is shown in Figure 2.153. The axial forces in these\nrepresentative elements are normalized with respect to the weight of the WTM without\nmounting system, about 529 lbs. It was shown that the in-plane load in each component varies\nlinearly with AoA regardless of the analysis types. The axial forces, obtained from the nonlinear\nanalysis, in the jury and the inboard wing are larger than those obtained from the linear\nanalysis, but opposite of that in the strut. It was also found that the value of the axial force in\nthe jury for this TBW WTM design is much less than the axial forces in the strut and the inboard\nwing. The jury and the inboard wing come under compression as the AoA increases, whereas,\nthe strut remains in tension as the AoA increases. Different axial forces were generated at some\ndifferent AoAs when using linear and nonlinear static analysis. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to examine the\n\n354\n\ninfluence of in-plane loads obtained from linear and nonlinear static analysis to the flutter\nboundaries.\n\nFigure 2.16 \xe2\x80\x93 The selected three wing components of the SUGAR TBW WTM, the inboard wing, the jury and the strut with\nequivalent rectangle cross sections\n\nFigure 2.17 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of axial force with AoA for the jury, the inboard wing and the strut at Mach No. 0.82 and ballast mass\n2.92 lbs using both linear and nonlinear analysis\n\n355\n\n1.7\n\nFlutter analysis of the SUGAR WTM under in-plane loads using both\nlinear and nonlinear analysis\n\nTo examine the accuracy of employing the iterative method for pre-stressed flutter analysis, a\ncomparison of flutter speed of the case under Mach 0.82 and 1 degree AoA at 4 different\nanalysis types using the iterative method and the discrete method was conducted. The 4\ndifferent analysis types mean that using linear and nonlinear analysis, w/ and w/o weight\nfactors applied to the unsteady aerodynamic pressure. The output data from the iterative\nmethod and the discrete method are plotted in Figure 2.153 and Figure 2.153, respectively. The\nflutter dynamic pressures from the two plots are tabulated in Table 2.31. The table shows that\nthe values of the flutter dynamic pressure calculated by the two methods are almost same.\nAnother case, the same flight conditions but under -1 degree AoA, was also chosen to validate\nthe flutter dynamic pressure obtained from the iterative method. The results were shown in\nTable 2.32. We can see that the two sets of results obtained from the discrete method and the\niterative method are also similar. Good agreement was achieved when using the iterative\nmethod and the discrete method for both of the cases. Parallel computing was utilized for the\ndiscrete method provided that the critical mode remains unchanged. For instance, mode 3 (2nd\nbending mode) was the critical mode for the SUGAR WTM. However, the normal modes were\nshift as the compressive stress and tensile stress in wing components generated at higher AoAs\nand dynamic pressures. We can not point out which two mode numbers would couple to cause\nthe flutter in advance when using the discrete method for higher AoA. It takes time when postprocessing structural damping from all modes involved in flutter analysis. It was also found that\nmore computations needed to give an accurate estimate of flutter boundary when using the\ndiscrete method although parallel computing was utilized in the discrete method. By comparing\nthe computation numbers in the Figure 2.153 and Figure 2.153, it\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper when using the\niterative method for the cases of linear analysis and the case of w/o WF applied to the unsteady\naerodynamic pressure in the flutter analysis. So, the iterative method was used as the primary\nmethod in the subsequent work of the other two WTM FEM versions to calculate the flutter\nspeed under in-plane loads.\n\n356\n\n(a) w/ WF\n\n(b) w/o WF\n\nFigure 2.18 \xe2\x80\x93 Iteration history of flutter dynamic pressure using linear and nonlinear analysis, Mach=0.82, ballast mass 2.92\nlbs., AoA=1deg.

The variation of\nthe flutter speed with AoA at different analysis types w/ and w/o WF applied to the unsteady\naerodynamic pressure was examined as shown in Figure 2.153. It was found that for the case of\nnonlinear analysis w/ WF, no flutter instability was observed at any AoA so that is not shown in\nthe plot. The flutter speed for the unloaded WTM is shown by a horizontal line, since the prestress is not included and flutter speed is not a function of AoA. It can be seen that the\nvariation of the predicted flutter speed increase with AoA regardless of the analysis type (linear\nor nonlinear, w/ or w/o WF). It can also be seen that analysis w/ WF results in a higher\npredicted flutter velocity than those obtained at the cases w/o WF.\n\n358\n\nFigure 2.20 \xe2\x80\x93 Flutter Speed vs. AoA for analyses w/ and w/o WF applied to the unsteady aerodynamic pressure. Both linear\nand nonlinear results are provided for the case of Mach number 0.82 and ballast mass 2.92 lbs.\n\n1.8\n\nInfluence of ballast mass on flutter speed\n\nThere are six ballasts located in the wing spar, which were developed for the WTM in order to\nimprove modal similitude with the full-scale FEM. The locations of these six ballasts are shown\nin Figure 2.153. Each mass is nominally 2.92 lbs. As we known, both mass distribution and\nmagnitude have significant influence on modal frequencies, mode shapes and, therefore,\nflutter behaviors. The flutter results shown in Figure 2.153 indicated that the highest fidelity\nanalysis (nonlinear w/ WF on unsteady aerodynamic pressure) did not predict flutter instability\nwithin the intended flight envelope. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the ballast\nmass to the flutter boundary. We examined the flutter response as the ballast mass (6 locations\nat 2.92 lbs. each) was firstly increased by 50% (6 locations at 4.38 lbs. each) and then by 100%\n(6 locations at 5.84 lbs. each). The mass moments of inertia of the ballasts remain unchanged.\nThe results in this section were generated at Mach 0.82 and included weight factors applied to\nthe unsteady aerodynamic pressure.\nFirstly, the flutter results of the unloaded model with three different ballast masses at Mach\nNo. 0.82 were examined, shown in Figure 2.153. It can be seen that flutter speed is reduced by\nnearly 20% by doubling the ballast mass from 2.92 to 5.84 lbs. Although this is a significant\nchange in the ballast mass, it only represents a 1.4% change to the overall structural weight\nincluding mounting system, and 3.36% change to the WTM weight without mounting system, as\n\n359\n\nindicated in the legend of Figure 2.153. This result illustrates that the flutter speed of the WTM\ncan be very sensitive to even small changes in the ballast mass.\n\nFigure 2.21 \xe2\x80\x93 Ballast mass added to the WTM to improve modal similitude with the full-scale aircraft\n\nFigure 2.22 \xe2\x80\x93 Flutter speed of the unloaded model at different ballast masses for Mach No. 0.82\n\nSecondly, the flutter results of the pre-stressed models with three different ballast masses\nusing both linear and nonlinear analysis were computed as shown in Figure 2.153. All cases\ninclude unsteady aerodynamic weighting factors in flutter analysis. The flutter results obtained\nfrom linear analysis indicated the similar variation trend of the flutter speed with ballast mass\n\n360\n\nwith that as shown in Figure 2.153, flutter speed is reduced by approximate 20% by doubling\nthe ballast mass. For the flutter results obtained from nonlinear analysis, as noted previously\nfor ballast mass of 2.92 lbs. in Figure 2.153, nonlinear analysis w/ WF\xe2\x80\x99s does not predict a flutter\ninstability within the flight envelope. Therefore, the results in Figure 2.153(b) only include the\nballast mass cases of 4.38/lbs. and 5.84/lbs., which did bring the flutter instability back within\nthe planned test envelope. The response of these two mass cases indicates the previously seen\nbehavior for flutter speed to increase with increasing AoA. The magnitude of the flutter speed\nreduction due to the increased ballast mass is similar to the previous cases for the unloaded\nmodel and the linear analyses. From this plot, it was concluded that the flutter boundary is very\nsensitive to the ballast mass.\n\n(a) Linear analysis\n\n(b) Nonlinear analysis\n\nFigure 2.23 \xe2\x80\x93 Flutter speed of the pre-stressed model using (a) linear analysis, (b) Nonlinear analysis w/WF applied to the\nunsteady aerodynamic pressure in flutter analysis for the case of three different ballast masses for Mach No. 0.82\n\n1.9\n\nModal information of the SUGAR WTM under in-plane loads using both\nlinear and nonlinear analysis\n\nAs we known, the modal information was the base for flutter analysis. The change in modal\nfrequencies and mode shapes could cause significant change to the flutter boundaries for the\nsame model. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to study the modal frequencies and corresponding mode shapes\ncross the range of AoA and for various analysis types. The fundamental mechanism influencing\nflutter speed prediction involves the change in the modal frequency of the 2nd bending mode\n(mode 3) and 1st torsion mode (mode 4). The variations of the natural frequencies of these 2\nmodes with AoA are shown in Figure 2.153. Modal frequencies of the unloaded model are\nindependent of AoAs, so a horizontal black line was plotted for the modal frequency of the\nmode 3 and mode 4 in the following two plots. The blue line and red line represent the\nvariation of modal frequencies with AoA when using linear analysis and nonlinear analysis,\nrespectively. The natural frequencies of mode 3 and mode 4 are approximately linearly varying\nwith AoAs between -1 to 5 degrees, and they increases with AoA regardless of analysis types.\n\n361\n\n(a) Mode 3\n\n(b) Mode 4\n\nFigure 2.24 \xe2\x80\x93 Natural frequencies of (a) the third mode and (b) the fourth mode using both linear and nonlinear analysis w/o\nWF using on unsteady aerodynamic pressure at Mach number 0.82 with ballast mass 2.92 lbs.\n\nVariations of the normalized modal frequencies with AoA using both linear and nonlinear\nanalysis were investigated, and the results are shown in Figure 2.153. The frequency here was\nnormalized with respect to the corresponding mode frequency of the unloaded model. The\nnatural frequency of the 2nd bending mode (mode 3) increased by about 2.5% compared to that\nof the unloaded model up to 5 degrees AoA, whereas, the natural frequency of the 1st torsion\nmode (mode 4) increased by approximately 1% up to 5 degrees AoA. An increase in the modal\nfrequency of mode 3 results in an increase in the flutter velocity.\n\n362\n\nMode 1\n\nMode 2\n\nMode 3\n\nMode 4\n\nFigure 2.25 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of the normalized modal frequencies of the first 4 modes (normalized with respect to the\ncorresponding unloaded mode frequencies) with AoA using both linear and nonlinear analysis w/o WF used on the unsteady\naerodynamic pressure under Mach number 0.82; with ballast mass 2.92 lbs.\n\nThe unsteady aerodynamic model, DLM based unsteady aerodynamic pressure, in NASTRAN\ndepends on the structural mode shapes. The change of mode shapes could also influence the\nflutter boundary. Figure 2.153 shows comparisons of mode shapes of the first 4 modes of the\nunloaded and the pre-stressed models when using both linear and nonlinear analysis of one\ncase with the flight condition at -1 degree AoA and Mach number 0.82. It was found that the\nfirst four mode shapes of the unloaded model and the linearly pre-stressed model are similar to\neach other. The mode shapes of the nonlinearly pre-stressed model are largely different from\nthose of the unloaded model and the linearly pre-stressed model. It is the change of mode\nshapes and natural frequencies of the nonlinearly pre-stressed model that cause the change in\nflutter boundary of the WTM when using nonlinear analysis for different AoAs.\n\n363\n\nMode 1-unloaded model\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 4.91 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 1- Linear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 4.89 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 1- Nonlinear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 4.45 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 2-unloaded model\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 5.60 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 2- Linear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 5.61 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 2- Nonlinear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 5.46 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 3-unloaded model\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 7.98 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 3- Linear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 7.97 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 3- Nonlinear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 7.48 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 4-unloaded model\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 10.83\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 4- Linear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 10.76 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nMode 4- Nonlinear analysis\n(\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x93 = 10.55 \xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb\xf0\x9d\x90\xbb)\n\nFigure 2.26 \xe2\x80\x93 The first 4 mode shapes of the unloaded model, the linear pre-stressed model and the nonlinear pre-stressed\nmodel at -1 degree AoA and Mach number 0.82\n\n1.10 Flutter boundaries of FEM V19 and V20\nThe finite element model of the SUGAR wind tunnel model was updated to FEM V19 and FEM\nV20 based on GVT results by the Boeing Company. The steady aerodynamic weighting factors\nwere also updated based on the wind tunnel tests. The Flutter boundaries for the latest FEMs\nwith updated steady aerodynamic weighting factors were computed. It was validated that it is\n\n364\n\nnot appropriate to employ steady aerodynamic weighting factors as the weight factors for\nunsteady aerodynamic pressure while performing a flutter analysis by comparing flutter\npredictions of FEM V18 with test results. So, no weight factors were included in the flutter\nanalysis while performing aeroelastic analysis of the SUGAR wind tunnel model for FEM V19\nand V20. This section mainly discusses how the flutter dynamic pressure varies with AoA\nranging from -3 degrees to 3 degrees for FEM V19 and FEM V20 using both linear and nonlinear\nanalysis w/o WF applied to the unsteady aerodynamic pressure.\nFigure 2.153 shows the predicted flutter dynamic pressure for FEM V19 increases\napproximately linearly with AoA using both linear and nonlinear analysis with original weight\nfactors only applied to the steady aerodynamic pressure, except for the results of the cases\nabove -1 degree AoA using nonlinear analysis at Mach number 0.7 and 0.76. No flutter is\npredicted above 1 degree AoA using nonlinear analysis at Mach number 0.7 and 0.76. It was\nfound that the flutter dynamic pressure decreases as the Mach number increases, which agrees\nwith the phenomena of the transonic \xe2\x80\x9cdip\xe2\x80\x9d often seen in the relationship of flutter dynamic\npressure with Mach number, caused by the transonic effects in a transonic flow.\n\nFigure 2.27 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of the flutter dynamic pressure with the AoA for FEM V19 using both linear and nonlinear analysis,\nthe original weight factors are only used to modify the steady aerodynamic pressure\n\nFlutter dynamic pressure for FEM V19 was also calculated with updated weight factors applied\nto the steady aerodynamic pressure, as shown in Figure 2.153, which has the similar variation\n\n365\n\nwith the AoA as seen in Figure 2.153. Flutter speed still decreases as the Mach number\nincreases for different AoA. It was found that the flutter dynamic pressure is very close at Mach\nnumber 0.7 and 0.76 and AoA=3 degrees using nonlinear analysis. Results from the discrete\nmethod also show that these two results are very close to each other. By comparing the data in\nthese two plots, Figure 2.153 and Figure 2.153, it was found that the flutter dynamic pressure\ndecreases about 4% for the cases with updated steady aerodynamic weighting factors using\nboth linear and nonlinear analysis for different AoAs compared with results obtained using the\noriginal weight factors of the same analysis type.\n\nFigure 2.28 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of the flutter dynamic pressure with AoA for FEM V19 using both linear and nonlinear analysis, the\nupdated weight factors are only used to modify the steady aerodynamic pressure\n\nFigure 2.153 shows that the flutter dynamic pressure increases linearly with AoA using both\nlinear and nonlinear analysis, when using FEM V20, with updated weighting factors only applied\nto the steady aerodynamic pressure. With the change in the structural model from FEM V19 to\nV20, the flutter dynamic pressure increased by about 10 psf using the same analysis type. We\nalso find again that the flutter dynamic pressure decreases as Mach number increases for\ndifferent AoA, using both linear and nonlinear analysis.\n\n366\n\nFigure 2.29 \xe2\x80\x93 Variation of the flutter dynamic pressure with AoA for FEM V20 using both linear and nonlinear analysis, the\nupdated weight factors are only used to modify the steady aerodynamic pressure\n\n1.11 Comparison of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions\nWind tunnel tests of the scaled SUGAR wind tunnel model were finished. Both Pre-holiday and\npost-holiday test results are presented here. Some open-loop flutter test results were obtained\nfor -3, -1, 1 and 3 degrees AoA at Mach numbers ranging from 0.65 to 0.79. Comparisons\nbetween the experimental results (pre-holiday and post-holiday) and theoretical predictions\nare shown for three different versions of finite element model (FEM V18, FEM V19 and FEM\nV20).\n1.11.1 Flutter results comparison of FEM v18\nFigure 2.153 shows the flutter dynamic pressure of the pre-holiday experimental results and\nthe theoretical predictions with the original weight factors without unsteady aerodynamic\nweighting factors in flutter analysis using both linear and nonlinear analysis. Results from\nnonlinear analysis are higher than the experimental results with difference around 20~35psf in\nabsolute magnitude and around 30% in relative magnitude. Results from linear analysis were\nfound to be closer to the experimental results. The variation of the flutter dynamic pressure\nwith Mach number didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree well with the test results.\nThe flutter predictions obtained by including unsteady aerodynamic weighting factors, same\nwith steady aerodynamic weighting factors, in flutter analysis, comparisons between\ntheoretical predictions and pre-holiday experimental results were tabulated in Table 2.30.

The predictions were found\nnot to agree with the experimental results, where there was flutter for -3, -1, 1 and 3 degrees\nAoA at Mach number ranging from 0.65 to 0.79 in the wind tunnel test. It appears that the\nsteady aerodynamic weighting factors were not appropriate to be used as weight factors for\nthe unsteady aerodynamic pressure.\nTable 2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 Flutter dynamic pressure (psi) for FEM V18 calculated with the original weight factors employed to both steady\nand unsteady aerodynamic pressure using both linear and nonlinear analysis\n\nMach=0.7\nLinear Nonlinear\n-3\n83.48\n103.15\n-1\n94.18\nN/F\n1\n105.94\nN/F\n3\n119.40\nN/F\n* N/F means No Flutter\nAoA (deg)\n\nMach=0.76\nLinear Nonlinear\n85.46\nN/F\n99.21\nN/F\n116.64\nN/F\n151.28\nN/F\n\nMach=0.82\nLinear Nonlinear\n89.69\n110.13\n99.94\n173.25\n110.71\nN/F\n121.64\nN/F\n\nFigure 2.30 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of the pre-holiday experimental results with the theoretical predictions for FEM V18 using both\nlinear and nonlinear analysis with the original weight factors applied to the unsteady aerodynamic pressure only\n\n368\n\n1.11.2 Flutter results comparison of FEM v19\nFigure 2.153 shows the comparison between the pre-holiday experimental results and the\ntheoretical predictions for FEM V19 using linear analysis with updated weight factors employed\nto correct the steady aerodynamic pressure only. It was found that the calculation of the flutter\ndynamic pressure was increased for FEM V19 with the updated weighting factors applied to the\nsteady aerodynamic pressure. The differences between the theoretical predictions and the\nexperimental results were reduced by about 3 psf for different AoA when compared with the\nresults obtained using the original weighting factors applied to the steady aerodynamic\npressure. However, there still exists large differences 4~20 psf (7%~20%) between the\nexperimental results and the theoretical predictions. The variation of flutter dynamic pressure\nwith Mach number didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree well with the experimental results after Mach number about\n0.73.\nFigure 2.153 illustrates the comparisons between the pre-holiday experimental results and the\ntheoretical predictions for updated FEM V19 using nonlinear analysis with the updated weight\nfactors applied to the steady aerodynamic pressure only. No flutter was predicted at 3 degrees\nAoA at Mach number 0.7 and 0.76. Comparing the results with flutter dynamic pressure\nobtained using the original weight factors, the flutter dynamic pressure using updated weight\nfactors decreased by 3 to 23 psf for different AoA. The flutter dynamic pressures calculated\nusing the original weight factors are higher than the experimental results by around 4~15 psf\n(4%~21%), whereas the flutter dynamic pressure calculated using the updated weight factors in\nthis analysis type are less than the experimental results by around 4~15 psf (4%~16%). Both of\nthe two theoretical variations of the flutter dynamic pressure with Mach number didn\xe2\x80\x99t match\nwell with the experimental results after Mach number about 0.73.\n\n369\n\nFigure 2.31 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions for FEM V19 using linear analysis with\nthe updated weight factors applied to the steady aerodynamic pressure only\n\nFigure 2.32 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions for FEM V19 using nonlinear analysis\nwith the updated weight factors applied to the steady aerodynamic pressure only\n\n370\n\n1.11.3 Flutter results comparison of FEM v20\nThe finite element model of the SUGAR TBW WTM was updated based on the latest GVT results\nto FEM version 20. Figure 2.153 shows the comparison between the theoretical predictions and\nthe post-holiday experimental results for the latest finite element model, V20. The flutter\ndynamic pressure was calculated with the updated weight factors applied only to the steady\naerodynamic pressure and using a nonlinear analysis. No weight factors were applied to the\nunsteady aerodynamic pressure. Flutter dynamic pressure calculated with the updated weight\nfactors are less than those obtained using the original weight factors by 2~10 psf (3%~13%) for\nthe same analysis type.\nIt is seen that there exists a flutter \xe2\x80\x9cdip\xe2\x80\x9d in the experimental results of flutter dynamic pressure\nwith Mach No. for each AoA. However, no flutter \xe2\x80\x9cdip\xe2\x80\x9d was observed in the theoretical\npredictions regardless of the analysis type in the flight envelope. Theoretical predictions for\nFEM v20 using nonlinear analysis with both the original WF and the updated WF applied to the\nsteady aerodynamic pressure did not match well with the experimental results. Once again, it is\nfelt that the unsteady aerodynamic weighting factors, including the time lag factors, to correct\nthe DLM in NASTRAN should be investigated to capture the transonic effects in transonic flow.\n\nFigure 2.33 \xe2\x80\x93 Comparison of the updated experimental results with the theoretical predictions for FEM V20 using nonlinear\nanalysis with both the original weight factors (Not label them in the legend) and the updated weight factors applied to the\nsteady aerodynamic pressure only\n\n371\n\n1.12 Summary\nWe have described an iterative solution sequence using NASTRAN Flightloads to perform\nnonlinear aeroelastic analysis including structural nonlinearities and vehicle pre-stress due to\nflight loads and self-weight. The solution sequence was utilized to study the impact of transonic\naerodynamic weighting factors, ballast mass, and AoA on flutter speed predictions. After that,\nnonlinear aeroelastic analyses of the SUGAR wind tunnel model with the latest finite element\nmodels with updated steady aerodynamic weighting factors were performed. We have also\ndeveloped a discrete method for this problem. The discrete method was mainly used as an\nalternative method for cases without convergence when using the iterative method and as a\nvalidation tool for results obtained by using the iterative method.\nUnlike the modal information and flutter boundaries slightly influenced by the in-plane loads\nfor cantilevered wings, the modal frequencies and flutter boundaries of the TBW are sensitive\nto the in-plane loads. It was seen that flutter speed calculated under in-plane loads with the\ninclusion of aerodynamic weighting factors for unsteady aerodynamic pressure can increase the\nflutter margin prediction by 20% - 30% depending on AoA. The analysis has shown the\nimportance of including structural geometric nonlinearities and in-plane loads when predicting\nthe flutter boundary of nontraditional truss-braced wing aircraft. In the case of the SUGAR TBW\nWTM studied here, for high AoA the nonlinear analysis predicts an increased flutter margin of\n20% - 30%, or in some cases, does not predict any flutter instability at all. The linear analysis, in\ngeneral, did not provide the same prediction as the nonlinear analysis, and the variation of the\nflutter dynamic pressure with Mach number doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the experimental results, and\ntherefore may not be an adequate prediction for this particular TBW example. The values for\nlinear analysis typically fell in between the unloaded results and the nonlinear ones.\nThe extreme sensitivity to ballast mass was demonstrated by evaluating several mass cases. It\nwas shown that even small changes of 1.4% to the total vehicle weight or 3.36% change to the\nWTM weight can result in large changes to the flutter speed around 20%.\nThe physical mechanisms influencing the flutter boundary were investigated. It was shown that\nthe inclusion of pre-stress can result in changes to the critical mode frequencies when using\nlinear analysis, and both natural frequencies and mode shapes in the nonlinear analysis, and\nthat in turn changes the flutter boundary.\nWe also examined that the in-plane loads linearly vary with AoA for each component of the\nwing. The in-plane loads in the jury are much less than axial forces in the strut and the inboard\nwing. The jury and the inboard wing come under compression as the AoA increases, whereas,\nthe strut remains in tension as the AoA increases. The axial forces obtained from linear and\nnonlinear analysis contribute differently to the geometry stiffness in the subsequent prestressed modes and flutter analysis.\n\n372\n\nSteady aerodynamic weighting factors were found not to be appropriate to be used as weight\nfactors for the unsteady aerodynamic pressure in the flutter analysis. Flutter boundaries were\nalso calculated for two new FEM versions, FEM V19 and FEM V20, of the SUGAR wind tunnel\nmodel. The latest FEM version 19 combined with the updated steady aerodynamic weighting\nfactors helped to reduce the differences between the theoretical predictions and the\nexperimental results. However, the variations of flutter dynamic pressure with Mach number\nstill does not agree well with the experimental results after Mach number about Mach 0.73.\nComparisons between the theoretical predictions for FEM V20 and the updated experimental\nresults of flutter dynamic pressure show that there was no flutter \xe2\x80\x9cdip\xe2\x80\x9d predicted in the\ncalculated results. The flutter predictions for FEM V20 didn\xe2\x80\x99t match quite well with the updated\nexperimental results. So, it is necessary to study the weight factors and the associated time lag\nfactors for unsteady aerodynamic pressure in a transonic flow. The aeroelastic studies with\nhigh-fidelity aerodynamic pressure considering both geometrical nonlinearities and\naerodynamic nonlinearities of the TBW configurations are on investigation at Virginia Tech.\n\n373\n\nForm Approved\nOMB No. 0704-0188\n\nREPORT DOCUMENTATION PAGE\n\nThe public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,\ngathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

ABSTRACT\nThis report summarizes the Truss Braced Wing (TBW) work accomplished by the Boeing Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) team, consisting\nof Boeing Research and Technology, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, General Electric, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, NextGen Aeronautics, and Microcraft. A\nmulti-disciplinary optimization (MDO) environment defined the geometry that was further refined for the updated SUGAR High TBW configuration. Airfoil\nshapes were tested in the NASA TCT facility, and an aeroelastic model was tested in the NASA TDT facility. Flutter suppression was successfully\ndemonstrated using control laws derived from test system ID data and analysis models. Aeroelastic impacts for the TBW design are manageable and smaller\nthan assumed in Phase I. Flutter analysis of TBW designs need to include pre-load and large displacement non-linear effects to obtain a reasonable match to\ntest data. With the updated performance and sizing, fuel burn and energy use is reduced by 54% compared to the SUGAR Free current technology Baseline\n(Goal 60%). Use of the unducted fan version of the engine reduces fuel burn and energy by 56% compared to the Baseline. Technology development roadmaps\nwere updated, and an airport compatibility analysis established feasibility of a folding wing aircraft at existing airports.\n\n15.
