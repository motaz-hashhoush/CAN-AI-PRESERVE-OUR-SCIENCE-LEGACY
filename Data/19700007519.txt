Most of the\ninformation presented deals with modules constructed from discrete\ncomponents by melding or soldering techniques. Such modules are\ntypically three-dimensional with components stacked like cordwood,\nor they are planar like printed circuits. The encapsulation of integrated\nand film-type circuits is mentioned only briefly. Solid resin, foam, and\nconformal encapsulants are discussed, but only passing references are\nmade to liquid, dry powder, and ceramic encapsulants, because they\nare seldom used for modules containing active solid-state electronic\ncomponents.\nFrom the beginnings of the electrical industry, critical circuit components have been coated, buried, or otherwise encased in dielectric\nmaterials to isolate them from adverse environmental and operational\neffects of oxygen, moisture, temperature, electrical flashover and current leakage, mechanical shock, and vibration. The first materials\nused for this purpose were waxes and asphaltic compounds. Although\nthese substances are still used to some extent, synthetic polymers are\nnow the most widely used electrical encapsulants.\n\nSeveral terms relating to the technology of encapsulation are loosely\nused throughout the electrical and electronic industries. Authorities do\nnot agree among themselves in defining some of these terms. The definitions listed below are generally in accord with industrial usage and\nshould be helpful to the reader in understanding the subsequent discussions in this report.\n1. Encapsulation-This word is used by some authorities (ref. 1) as\nthe broad, generic term to include any process that totally encloses a\ncircuit or component, except for leads, in a monolithic dielectric.\nOther authorities use the term in a more restricted sense to refer to\nthe casting or molding of dielectric around a circuit, with the resulting\n1\n\n2\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nblock having a definite shape, usually a simple polyhedron. Another\nuse of the word \xe2\x80\x9cencapsulation\xe2\x80\x9d not related to electronic packaging,\nbut which is certain to cause increasing confusion in the literature,\nrefers to the enclosure of a liquid or solid chemical in microspheres of\ngelatin or similar material that can be ruptured at will by heat or\npressure.\n2. Potting-Potting differs from the restricted definition of encapsulation in that the mold becomes part of the final assembly. It is\nused particularly with reference to sealing of cable connectors, but\nalso is used when a component, such as a transformer or a resistor, is\ncast into a preformed metal or plastic case by using a hardening\ndielectric.\n3. Embedment-This term connotes the complete burial of a circuit\nin a surrounding material. It is also commonly used when the dielectric consists of a granular or powdered dielectric, a foam, or a ceramic.\n4. Conformal Coating-This term is used frequently to include any\ndielectric coating of more or less constant thickness that follows the\ncontour of the circuit assembly, regardless of whether it is applied by\ndipping, spraying, or brushing. One authority (ref. 2) prefers to call\nsuch a coating applied by dipping \xe2\x80\x9cencapsulation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n5. Surface Coating-Some authorities use this term to mean a coating that is brushed or sprayed onto a circuit. Others refer to brushed\nor sprayed coatings simply as conformal coatings.\n6. Impregnation-This term has long been used in the electrical\napparatus industry to mean the process by which all externally connected air spaces in a component, such as a coil or a motor stator, are\nfilled with a resin. This is most often accomplished by immersing the\ncomponent in the liquid resin and applying vacuum and/or pressure.\n\nS\nO\n\neo\n\nThe reader who is unfamiliar with electronic module embedment\nwill find that available literature (refs. 1 through 3) gives an excellent\nintroduction to the subject as well as helpful discussions of polymer\nchemistry and typical properties of the different classes of embedment\nmaterials. The Modern Plastics Encyclopedia (ref. 4), issued annually,\ncontains similar information on properties as well as practical instructions for production molding processes. An extensive summary of\nmanufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 data on potting and encapsulating compounds was\nprepared by American Machine and Foundry, Inc. (ref. 5) in 1961\nand serves as an excellent reference to the chemistry and characteristics of such materials up to that year. The entire subject of electronic\npackaging has been covered in a recent four-volume handbook prepared by the Hughes Aircraft Company (ref. 6).\nI n addition to the books and handbooks, a number of bibliographies\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ncovering various B spects o\xe2\x82\xac electronic packaging and embedment\n(refs. 7 through 15) have appeared since 1960. These bibliographies,\nmost of which are annotated, provide an introduction to the report,\njournal, and trade literature.\n\n369-147 0\n\n- 70 - 2\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nof\n\nene\n\nIn addition to waxes and asphalts, some electronic components and\ncircuits are embedded in various types of ceramics, including airdrying and heat-curing cements (refs. 16 through 19); in liquids\n(refs. 20 and 21) ; and in unbonded granular or powdered solids (refs.\n22 and 23). Circuits and apparatus usually embedded in such materials\nare transformers, high-temperature motors, coils, and passive networks. They seldom include active semiconductor circuits, since the\nservice capabilities of organic resins are adequate for the relatively\nlow upper-operating temperature limit of semiconductors, which is\nabout 8.5\xe2\x80\x99 C. Only organic resin-type embedment materials, many of\nwhich are filled with inorganic materials, will be considered further\nin this report. The reader interested in ceramic, liquid, or powder\nencapsulating materials is referred to the literature cited above.\nMost of the embedment of electronic modules is done today with\none of three classes of polymers-epoxy resins, urethanes, or silicones,\nof which the epoxies are used most frequently. All these materials can\nbe prepared as either continuous solids or foams. They are thermosetting materials; that is, their curing reactions include the crosslinking of molecules. Consequently they are infusible when cured.\nThey will soften somewhat with the application of heat but will\ndegrade by charring before they will melt. In this respect they differ\nfrom the general class of thermoplastic polymers.\nThe particular epoxies, urethanes, and silicones used for electronic\nmodule embedment also share two other characteristics that are\nimportant to that application. First, these polymers, with the exception of polyurethane foams, are addition-curing rather than condensation-curing. Thus while curing they do not liberate water or an\nacid that would be harmful to the electronic components. Second, they\ndo not generally contain volatile solvents; they are, therefore, essentially \xe2\x80\x98 I 100-percen t solids.\xe2\x80\x9d Solvent-con taining encapsulants shrink\nexcessively during curing, and the solvents may cause swelling or\nsolution of organic materials in the circuitry of the module.\nIn industry, much of the embedment of electronic components is\ndone with polyesters, diallyl phthalate resins, phenolics, elastomers\nsuch as polysulfide rubber, and thermoplastics such as polyethylene.\n5\n\n6\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nPolystyrene is also used for applications where a low dielectric loss is\nrequired. For a variety of reasons, however, these materials are less\nsuitable than epoxies, urethanes, and silicones for encapsulating highperformance aerospace modules. Several brief summaries of embedment materials, which enumerate the advantages and disadvantages\nof each class, are available (refs. 24 through 26).\n\ns\nEpoxy resins, most of which are made by combining such materials\nas bisphenol A with epichlorohydrin, are available from numerous\nmanufacturers in a wide range of polymeric chain lengths and with a\nvariety of substituted groups in the chains. The length of the chains\ndetermines the viscosity of the resin and its molecular weight. When\nthe viscosity becomes too high, the resin is no longer pourable and is\nno longer suitable for casting.\nSeveral classes of curing agents for epoxy materials are available.\nThe anhydrides are effective in producing cured resins having the best\nhigh-temperature properties, but they are difficult to use because most\nof the anhydrides are solid at room temperature. Amine curing agents\nare most commonly used with epoxies intended for module embedment because they are liquids that can be conveniently mixed with\nresin and because extremely high heat resistance is not required in\nsolid-state circuits. The particular curing agent employed not only\naffects the properties of the cured resin, but also influences the rate\nof curing and the amount of heat liberated during curing. Curing\nagents must therefore be chosen with careful consideration of the\ndesired pot life and the volume of resin being cured. High exothermic\ncharacteristics coupled with large volumes of resin may result in\nrunaway cures.\nProperties of the epoxy resins that have led to their wide use include\ntheir resistance to chemicals and moisture, good mechanical and\nelectrical properties, low curing shrinkage, dimensional stability,\nreasonable cost, and ease of use in production. The present state of\nthe epoxy molding technology has recently been reviewed by Delmonte\n(ref. 27).\nPolyurethanes are produced by causing di-isocyanates or polyisocyanates to react with chemicals containing two or more active\nhydrogen sites in their molecules. Examples are polyesters, polyethers, glycols and other polyhydroxy alcohols (polyols), and water.\nAlthough most of the polyurethanes are either flexible or rigid foams\nand fibers, they can be prepared as solid, pore-free materials. Both\nsolid and foamed polyurethanes are used in the embedment of modules.\nPolyurethanes tend to be rubbery, or elastomeric, and have excellent\n\nCLASSES OF EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\n7\n\ntear strength and resistance to abrasion. The loss of mechanical\nstrength of these materials is quite rapid as service temperature is\nincreased above room temperature. The isocyanates have strong\nunpleasant odors and may liberate poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas\nduring curing. Consequently they should be used only with adequate\nventilation. Manufacturers have largely overcome these disadvantages\nby packaging the materials in a partially processed form that is\nconvenient to use for the embedment of electronic modules (refs.\n28 and 29).\n\nS\nSilicones consist of chains of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms\nwith a variety of carbon-based side groups. I n this respect they differ\nfrom conventional polymers in which the chains consist almost entirely of carbon atoms. Because of their structure, the silicones are\nresistant to oxidation, have excellent electrical resistance, and retain\ntheir mechanical properties over a wider temperature range than other\nclasses of polymers. I n addition to the rigid and elastomeric silicones\navailable for the embedment of modules, there is a silicone gel that\ncan be penetrated by a probe for circuit testing and will then heal\nitself. The use of silicones for embedment applications has been somewhat limited by their relatively low mechanical strengths, poor\nadhesion to the underlying circuitry, comparatively high cost, and\nthe unavailability until recently of an addition-curing system. Considerable progress, however, has-been made in solving these problems\n(ref. 30).\n\nID\n\nPO\n\ns\n\nThe development of new and improved poIymers is an active field.\nEpoxies, urethanes, and silicones can be made to copolymerize with\nthe object of imparting the beneficial properties of each class of resin\nto the resulting polymers (ref. 31). For high-temperature service,\neffortsare being made to develop compact, three-dimensional polymers\nthat are either aromatic or heterocyclic and contain at least some\nsilicone (ref. 32). Such compounds as carboranes and polybenzimidazoles are under investigation.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nA system for embedding electronic modules consists of the basic\npolymer and its curing agent, and various added materials. The\nadditives may include fillers, flexile materials, coloring agents, flowcontrol agents, antioxidants, and other materials that will modify the\ncharacteristics of the resin/hardener system and bring about desirable\nresults. Most of the additives are compounded by the manufacturer\nof the embedment system and need not concern the module manufacturer directly. Many of the additives, however, have significant\n. effects on the end properties of the material and, in choosing among\npossible embedment systems, care must be taken to distinguish\nbetween the properties of polymer systems developed by pure or\nsimplified research and those of commercial embedment materials.\n\ns\nFrom the standpoint of the module manufacturer, fillers are probably the most important additives. Fillers generally modify the basic\nresin/hardener properties more extensively than the other types of\nadditive and are sometimes added by the user since the principles\ngoverning their use require no significant specialized knowledge of\npolymer chemistry. I n module embedment, fillers will nearly always\nbe used, particularly with the more rigid epoxy and silicone resins.\nThe purpose is to obtain a better match between the thermal expansion\ncharacteristics of the resin and the circuit components, and to increase\nthe thermal conductivity of the resin.\nBergey, Shanta, and Dalphone (ref. 33) have collected and tabulated\nthermal and electrical conductivities, expansion coefficients, densities,\ndielectric properties, and thermal shock resistances of some 78 possible\nfillers. They have also evaluated the effects of the most promising\nfillers in various applications. Among the mineral fillers that they and\nother investigators have evaluated in detail are silica sand, boron\nnitride, magnesia, mica, zirconium silicate, alumina, and beryllia\n(refs. 33 through 37). The detailed effects of fillers as well as their\nspecific properties are discussed in Chapter 4.\nThere are definite limits to the amount of any particular filler that\na given resin system will accept without becoming excessively viscous.\n9\n\n10\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nI n general, it is possible to achieve higher concentrations with granular\nfillers having controlled particle size than with fillers in the form of\nfine powders. Fine powdery fillers also tend to make the system\nthixotropic. (Thixotropic materials are viscous if allowed to stand\nundisturbed, but decrease in viscosity temporarily following stirring\nor other agitation. On standing, they revert to their original gelled\nstate.) One method of achieving higher filler concentrations is to\nplace the filler around the module and then infiltrate it with the resin.\nThis approach was used by Baker (ref. 36) with beneficial effects on\nthermal conductivity.\n\ns\nThe addition of min\nresin systems increased\ndensity, which is undesirable for applications in which minimum\nweight is essential. Fillers of hollow glass, ceramic, plastic spheres, or\nmicroballoons give embedment systems reduced densities and are\nbecoming increasingly popular for module embedment. A system in\nwhich glass microspheres are used is designated as Type IV in NASA\nspecifkation MSFC-SPEC-222A. Experimental studies of such systems have been reported by several investigators (refs. 38 through 41).\n\ns\nEmbedment materials of minimum density are obtained when the\nmaterial is in the form of a foam (ref. 42). The urethanes are the most\ncommonly used foams, since their curing reaction can be made t o\nliberate carbon dioxide. Foaming can also be caused to occur in\nepoxies, silicones, and other resins by adding a blowing (gas evolving)\nagent. The foaming is done in situ in the mold cavity containing the\ncircuit being embedded. Control of the foam\xe2\x80\x99s density and rigidity\nover wide ranges is possible by varying the percentage of the blowing\nagent and the composition of the resin. The low densities of foams are\nobtained a t the expense of mechanical strengths and moisture\nresistance.\n\nu\nTo protect circuit components, particularly those encased in glass,\nfrom stresses caused by curing of the embedment resin and from\nmechanical shock in service, a thin, flexible conformal undercoat is\nsometimes applied to the module circuitry prior to embedment.\nSilicone rubber or solid polyurethane is usually used as the undercoat\nmaterial. Recent work hae confirmed that the value of undercoating\nincreases in proportion to the rigidity of the outer embedment resin\n(ref. 431, and that it has little or no beneficial effect when used with\nflexible epoxy or foamed embedment materials.\n\nEMBEDMENT SYSTEMS\n\n11\n\nAn unusual duplex system has been reported that combines repairability, moisture resistance, and light weight (ref. 44). The module\nis embedded in glass microspheres cemented together with a polyvinyl\nbutyral binder. A thin (0.015 mil) epoxy exterior coating provides the\nenvironmental barrier. To repair the module, the epoxy is first cut\naway. The microspheres can then be flushed clear of the defective\ncomponent with acetone, which readily dissolves polyvinyl butyral.\nAfter the component has been replaced, fresh microspheres can be\ncemented in place and an outer epoxy patch applied. A limitation of\nthe system would seem to be the relatively low mechanical shock\nresistance of the closely packed microspheres.\nDunaetz and Tuckerman (ref. 45) have developed a duplex embedment system that they refer to as \xe2\x80\x9cegg shell\xe2\x80\x9d embedment. It is\nsimilar to the system described above except that polyurethane\nfoam, instead of microspheres, is the interior material. The epoxy\nshell is effective in blocking outgassing of the polyurethane in vacuum.\n\n369-147 0\n\n- IO - 3\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nric\n\nent\n\nThis chapter deals with the mechanical, physical, and electrical\nproperties of encapsulants that are related to their use with electronic\nmodules. The many different formulations and variations that are\npossible among batches make it impossible to predict the exact\nproperties of any particular batch of a specific manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s product.\nNevertheless, the different classes of encapsulants do have properties\nthat fall into certain characteristic ranges.\nDrinkard and Snyder (ref. 5) summarized in graphical and tabular\nform a large quantity of manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 data that became available\nin June 1961. Their graphs representing those properties for which\ndata were available will be presented later in this chapter. They have\nbeen modified to include the maximum and/or minimum property\nvalues established by NASA specifications, where appropriate. Where\na specification includes different types of materials, these materials\nare indicated by their identifying Roman numerals that are used in\nthe specifications. I n several cases the specification limits fall outside\nthe ranges found by Drinkard and Snyder. Presumably these limits\napply to materials developed since 1961, since existing materials are\nqualified for use under all of the NASA specifications.\n\nS\nIt is necessary to understand something of the structure of the\nchemical industry to appreciate fully the need for continual testing\nof organic materials purchased for production use. With the exception\nof silicones, which are manufactured by firms that also compound\nfinished casting and molding materials, the basic resins are usually\nproduced by large, general chemical manufacturers. The embedment\nmaterial supplier then blends relatively small quantities of these\nresins with a wide variety of chemicals that serve ae fillers, extenders,\nelastic or flexible agents, moderators, flow-control agents, coloring\nagents, and the like into proprietary formulations. Since this compounding is usually a batch process, lot-to-lot variations are liable\nto be significant and, considering the great variety of different chemi13\n\n14\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\ncals available for use in compounding, no two manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 compounds are likely to be identical in all respects. Stefanski (ref. 46)\nhas discussed the testing requirements involved in the production of\nplastics from the point of view of manufacturing quality control.\nRegardless of the care exercised by the manufacturer, however, the\nuser of plastics must maintain his own continual quality check on\nmaterials, because they may age and deteriorate in storage.\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has\nestablished standard test methods for determining many of the\nproperties of encapsulants. These standard tests provide a common\nbasis for comparison, and the properties measured by ASTM procedures should always be included in published articles when they\nare pertinent. Federal test specifications and military specifications\ninclude testing methods for some properties not covered by ASTM.\nA listing of the more common ASTM, federal, and military specification test methods applicable to encapsulation and embedment\nsystems is given in table I.\nBecause these tests are often unnecessarily elaborate for screening\npurposes, the users of plastics have developed a variety of simple, rapid\ntests, by which those compounds that are clearly unsatisfactory for a\ngiven application can be eliminated from consideration. For example,\none company evaluates selected embedment resins by potting a castellated nut in a small, but constant quantity of each compound in throwaway aluminum foil pans, and making a visual examination of the\ncured blocks of plastics to determine their relative cracking sensitivities. Only compounds that pass this test are then subjected to the\nASTM tests. There is a danger in using nonstandardized tests, however.\nIt is possible to devise tests that no available material can pass consistently, and judgment is therefore necessary, together with advice\nfrom material suppliers, in establishing such in-house tests. In the last\nanalysis, the performance of an encapsulant in the intended application is more meaningful than any of the material tests. For this reason,\nfinished modules should be subjected to appropriate environmental\ntests that stimulate service conditions as closely as can be economically\njustified.\n\nS\nA number of mechanical properties affect the selection of an embedment material for a given application. The more important ones discussed in this report include elastic modulus, tensile strength, tear\nstrength, compressive strength, compression set, flexural strength,\nimpact strength, and hardness.\nThe elastic modulus is the ratio of stress to strain below the propor-\n\nSpecification\n\nMethod\n\nTABLE\nI.-Some\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nSpecification title\n\nProperty\n\nstandard testing spec$cations applicable to polymeric embedment materials\n\nProperty\n\nCompound, Potting and Molding, Elastomeric-\n\nInsulation resistance, high potential, low temperature flexibility, electrical resistance at; 100\' C , moisture resistance,\nshrinkage, ozone resistance, nonvolatile content, storage\nlife, application life, viscosity, adhesion.*\nResin Compounds, Electrical and Environmental Insulation resistance, high potential moisture resistance,\nthermal conductivity, nonvolatile content, application life,\nInsulation, Epoxy.\nshrinkage, viscosity.*\nCompounds, Potting and Encapsulating, Silicone- Ozone resistance, water absorption, low-temperature flexibility, shrinkage, humid electrical resistance, storage life,\napplication life.*\nCompound, Printed Circuit Board, Conformal Sprayability, volume, and surface resistivity, insulation reCoating, Elastomeric.\nsistance, high potential resistance at 121\' C, humid electrical resistance, shrinkage, storage life, application life,\nnonvolatile content, adhesion.*\nPolyurethane Foams for Electronic Equipment-- Aging stability, volume change, storage life.*\n\n-\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nSpecification title\n\nstandard testing spec$cations applicable to polymeric embedment materials-Continued\n\n*Tests described in addition to standard tests referenced to MIL, FED, or ASTM specifications.\n\nMSFC-SPEC-418\n\nMSFC-SPEC-393A\n\nMSFGSPEC-379A\n\nMSFGSPEG222B\n\nMSFC-SPEC-ZO2A\n\nSpecification\n\nTABLE-Some\nI.\n\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\n150\n256\n257\n395\n495\n570\n696\n746\n792\n1621\n1622\n1692\n2127\n\nD 149\n\nSpecification\nAmerican Society for Testing and Materials\n\nSpecification title and property\n\nstandard testing spec&ations applicable to polymeric embedmen!$ materials-Continued\n\nTest for Dielectric Breakdown Voltage and Dielectric Strength of Electrical Insulating Materials at Commercial Power\nFrequencies.\nTest for a-c Capacitance, Dielectric Constant, and Loss Characteristics of Electrical Insulating Materials.\nTest for Impact Resistance of Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials.\nTest for Electrical Resistance of Insulating Materials.\nCompression Set of Vulcanized Rubber.\nTest for High-Voltage, Low-Current Arc Resistance of Solid Electrical Insulating Materials.\nTest for Water Absorption of Plastics.\nTest for Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion of Plastics.\nMethod of Test for Brittleness Temperature of Plastics and Elastomers by Impact.\nTest for Specific Gravity and Density of Plastics.\nMethod of Test for Compressive Strength of Rigid Cellular Plastics.\nMethod of Test for Apparant Density of Rigid Cellular Plastics.\nMethod of Test for Flammability of Plastic Foams and Sheeting.\nWater Absorption of Rigid Cellular Plastics.\n\nTABLE\nI.-Some\n\nm\n\n2\n\n+d\n0\n\n18\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\ntional or elastic limit of the material. The elastic modulus may also be\nknown as the modulus of elasticity, tensile modulus, or Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus. Used in combination with the thermal expansion coefficient, the\nelastic modulus makes possible the calculation of stress in the encapsulant and of the force that may be imposed on electrical components\nunder thermal cycling.\nWhen pulled in tension, the rigid embedment materials will initially\nshow a nearly linear relation between stress and strain. When the\nlinear portion of the stress-strain curve is exceeded, the material may\nfall into a zone of plastic flow; that is, the material will continue to\ndeform without appreciable increase in stress until a rupture occurs.\nBrittle materials, however, may rupture before any substantial plastic\nflow occurs.\nThe elastomers, such as the silicone rubbers and elastomeric polyurethanes, have stress-strain curves with a very low initial slope, indicating a very low elastic modulus. The slope of the curves increases\ncontinuously with increasing load all the way to rupture. The stressstrain curve shows no noticeable break under increasing load. Because\nof this low initial elastic modulus, the elastomers do not have the\nrigidity required for use in \xe2\x80\x9chigh g\xe2\x80\x9d applications (ref. 39).\nCare should be taken in selecting resins for applications at low temperatures because of the increase in the modulus of elasticity that\ntakes place below the glass-transition temperature in polymers. Published data on this subject are scant, but Nikolaychik (ref. 47) has\nshown the variations in the elastic modulus as a function of temperature for a number of epoxies. Graphs from this work are shown in\nfigures 1 through 4.l These graphs show significantly higher elastic\nmoduli as temperatures decrease. This phenomenon could lead to\nincreased internal stresses in the embedment materials, and increased\nforces acting on the enclosed components during expansion and contraction of the materials at low temperatures.\nThe tensile strength of a material is the greatest longitudinal stress\n(as pounds per square inch) it can bear without rupture or break.\nThe tensile strength is of little direct importance in embedment\napplications if the strength of the material is sufficient to support the\nload applied in service. It is, however, an important indicator of the\ncharacteristics of a material when it is considered in conjunction with\nother properties of the material.\nFigure 5 shows ranges of typical tensile-strength values for the\n\nStycast and Hysol are trade names of commercial embedment materials.\n\n19\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\nI\n\n1\n-100\n\n-54\n\n0\n\n50\n\nTEMP\n\n1w\n\nl!\n\nI\n\n("0\n\nFIGURE\n1.-Elastic\nmodulus versus temperature for Hysol 4215.\n(Used by permission of the Society of Automotive Engineers.)\n\nTEMP\n\n(\'0\n\nI\n\nFIGURE\n2.-Elastic\nmodulus versus temperature for Stycast 1090.\n(Used by permission of the Society of Automotive Engineers.)\n\ncommon embedment materials (ref. 5).

The polyurethane foams also lost strength with temperature increases from 70\' to 165\' F. The tensile strength of Eccofoam FP dropped from 144 to less than 1 psi, and that of the hightemperature foam, Eccofoam FPH, dropped from 166 to 157 psi.\nTensile strengths of Stycast 1090 at room-temperature and 300\' F\nalso dropped slightly during exposure to vacuum. The tensile strengths\nof Eccofoam FP and FPH polyurethane foams, however, increased\nsignificantly during vacuum exposure. The data developed by Harper\n(ref. 2) indicate that the tensile strengths of epoxy materials are\nreduced when low-density fillers are added.\nar Strength\n\nThe tear strength or tear resistance is a measure of the resistance\nof such elastomeric materials as the urethanes to the propagation of\na crack. The maximum load a block of material can bear without\ntearing divided by the average thickness of the block is the tear\nresistance of the material; it is expressed in pounds per inch of\nthickness.\n\n22\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nThe tear strength, like the tensile strength, is not of direct use in\nthe selection of an embedment material for a given application. It is\na guideline, however, for predicting the behavior of a material in\ncases where sharp notches may exist in the module. The tear resistance\nmust be sufEcient during mechanical loading to prevent damage to\nthe embedment material. Tear strengths of solid polyurethane materials have been reported to vary from 82 to 302 lb/in. (ref. 47).\n~ompressivs\n%w@th\n\n/\n\nThe compressive strength of a material is the maximum compressive\nstress (the maximum compressive load divided by the minimum area\nexposed to the load) that can be carried by a test specimen during a\ncompression test. It may or may not be the compressive stress carried\nby the specimen at the instant of rupture. The measure of compressive strength is of little importance in the process of encapsulation,\nbut it is a useful indicator of material characteristics when viewed\nin conjunction with other properties. Compressive strength is commonly measured for the rigid embedment materials. The compressive\nproperties of the flexible materials are generally characterized by the\ncompression set, which will be discussed below. The compressive\nstrength, like the tensile strength, of Stycast 1090 is reduced by\nincreased temperatures (ref. 48). It is, however, consistently much\nhigher than the tensile strength of the material.\nThe compressive strengths of Eccofoam FP and FPH polyurethane\nfoams tend to be lower than the tensile strength under corresponding\ntest conditions. The strength values of the FPH foam are consistently\nhigher than those of the FP foam. Holzbauer and Holbrook (ref. 50)\nshowed the variation of compressive strength with density for two\nfoam-in-place materials. These data, in table 11, show an increase in\ncompressive strength with increased density, and also indicate the\nrelative insensitivity of these foam materials to the test direction.\nVery little differences in strength and no consistent trends are evident\nin the compressive strengths of the materials when they were tested\nparallel or perpendicular to the direction of foaming.\nThe effects of granular fillers on the compressive strengths of\nepoxies hardened by three different hardening systems have been\nestablished (ref. 35). The investigators used the maximum amount\nof each filler they could add to each resin/hardener system and still\nretain pourability. The mica-filled systems had approximately the\nsame compressive stlengths as the unfilled systems, and silica,\nzirconium silicate, and hydrated alumina had consistently higher\ncompressive strengths than the unfilled systems.

He also demonstrated that the compressive yield strength\nof Stycast 1090 increased when the activator content was decreased.\nThe compressive yield strength increased with decreasing amounts\nof activator until it mixture containing as little as 8 parts (by weight) of\nactivator per 100 parts of resin was attained. The optimum amount\nof activator that could be used was not established.\nCompression Set\n\nCompression set, a characteristic value of the flexible embedment\nmaterials, is the residual decrease in thickness of a material measured\n30 minutes after its removal from a loading device in which it had\nbeen compressively deformed for a definite time and under specified\nconditions of load and temperature. Compression set is usually\nexpressed as a percentage of the original thickness. Typical ranges\nof compression set for silicone and polyurethane materials are from\n15 to 60 percent, and from 21 to 41 percent iespectively (ref. 3).\nexural SIrength\n\nThe fiexural strength is the ixltimate or breaking strength of a\nmaterial calculated its if the stress in tension or compression increased\nlinearly from zero a t the neutral axis to it maximum in the extreme\noutside fibers (ref. 1). I n plastics, this variation is far from linear,\nand such properties are of int>erestmainly in structural uses. This\ntest is generally applied to rigid and semirigid materials. The flexural\n\n24\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nstrength cannot be determined for those materials that do not break\nor that do not fail in the outer fibels. The flexural strength, like the\ntensile and compressive strengths, is used only as a compositive indicator of material properties for encapsulation applications.\n(ref. 3) has recorded flexural strength ranges for mine1al-filled\nof from 7000 to 8000 psi. A glass-fiber filled silicone system showed\na flexural strength range of from 10 000 to 14 000 psi. This indicates\nthat the type of filler employed affects the flexural strength.\nThe impact strength, generally measured by the Izod impact test,\nis expressed in terms of the energy required to break a notched\nspecimen by a standard impact blow. The impact strength of plastic\nmaterials is generally expressed as foot-pounds per inch of specimen\nwidth. The Izod value is useful in comparing various types or grades\nof plastics. Low-impact test results may indicate the need for avoiding\nsharp internal 01 external corners in dynamically loaded parts prepared\nfrom materials which show notch sensitivity.\nThe ranges of typical impact-strength values for the common\nencapsulating materials are shown in figure 6. Also indicated on the\nfigure are the NASA specification requirements for the epoxy materials.\nThe applicable NASA specifications for silicone and polyurethane\nmaterials do not require an impact test. The analogous test for the\nelastomeric materials is the tear test described previously.\n\nEPOX I ES\nPOLYESTERS\nSIL ICONES\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPOLYSTYRENES\nPOLY URETHA N E S\n\nFIGURE\n6.-Ranges of typical impact strengths of cured embedment materials.\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\n25\n\nsrdness\n\nHardness is a complex property related very closely in practice\nto the modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and the other structural\nproperties, though the theoretical relationships among them are not\nclear. Tests of many of the mechanical properties discussed previously\nmay require special specimens or specialized equipment, and thus\ndo not lend themselves to production checks on finished encapsulations.\nThere are simple and widely accepted methods for determining hardness, however. These can be used on finished products without\nsignificant daniage to either their function or appearance. Such tests\ncan be done on a routine basis ta indicake quickly those products\nthat are substandard in formulation or cure and to establish limits\nof acceptability.\nThe Rockwell tester, widely used for metals, is effective for testing\nrigid or relatively hard plastic parts, working with a scale suited to\ntheir lower level of hardness. For flexible or soft materials, the Shore\nDurometer is a recognized standard. These instruments measure the\nrelation between depth of penetration and load for specific conditions,\nwith larger numbers indicating harder materials.\nshows typical Shore A hardness ranges for silicone a\nmaterials respectively of from 20 to 90 (NASA specification limits\nare from 10 to 60) and 55 to 100 (NASA specification limits are from\n45 to 99). The manufacturers\' data presented by Drinkard and\nSnyder (ref. 5) suggest that most of the silicone materials fall in the\nlower portion of this range, that is, Shore A 30 to 60. Typical hardnesses for epoxy resins range from 80 to 120 Rockwell M (refs. 2 and\n5). The addition of low-density fillers did not affect the hardness of\nEpon 828 epoxy resin after curing (ref. 2).\nChristensen (ref. 51) found that a room-temperature-curing silicone\nmaterial increased in hardness after approximately 1000 hours exposure\nat 250" C. The material retained good electrical properties, however.\nThe same author reported that a silicone gel became hard and friable\nafter 2000 to 3000 hours exposure at 200" C. McDonnell Aircraft\n(ref. 52) reported some hardening and shrinkage of EC 1663, a commercial silicone embedment material, after 1000 hours at 500" F\n(260" C). Another commercial material, RTV 60, suffered a slight\nloss of hardness after the same exposure.\n\nYSICA\n\nS\n\nThe heat generated in encapsulated electronic units, even at modest\npower levels, may raise operating temperatures considerably because\nof the close packing of the heat sources and the limited thermal\nconductivity of the encapsulating material.

Embedding materials generally have somewhat higher\ncoefficients of thermal expansion than those of glasses or metals. This\nis shown in figure 7, in which the thermal coefficients of expansion of\na filled and an unfilled epoxy resin are compared with those of several\nother materials (ref. 53). These data are within the ranges shown by\nDrinkard and Snyder in figure 8, upon which the requirements of the\napplicable NASA specifications for epoxy and silicone materials\nhave been super-imposed.

The coefficients of thermal expansion of epoxy resin systems can be greatly reduced by the addition\nof inorganic fillers (ref. 35). In general, the coefficient of expansion\nwill depend on the original coefficient of the unfilled resin, the filler\nmaterial used, and the concentration of the filler. This is true for\nresins other than epoxies (ref. 53). The silicones usually have much\nhigher coefficients of expansion than the urethanes or epoxies.\nThe variation in coefficient of thermal expansion with temperature\nwas studied by Nikolaychik (ref. 47) for four commercial epoxy\nencapsulants. The variations between -100 and 150" F were nearly\nlinear. The equations derived from this study are shown in table 1 1\n1.\nThe coefficient of thermal expansion of Stycast 1090 cured at room\ntemperature was generally reduced by exposure to vacuum at temperatures in the range of -40 to +70" F (ref. 49). I n the range of 70 to\n300" F, slightly increased expansion coefficients were noted during\nand after exposure t o vacuum.\nThe coefficient of thermal expansion of urethane foams increases with\nincreasing foam density.

Figure 9 shows the ranges of\ntypical values of thermal conductivity found in the common encapsulating materials by Drinkard and Snyder (ref. 5). Harper (ref. 2)\nreports that the thermal conductivities of silica-filled epoxy resins\nvaried from 10 to 20 Cal/sec/cm2/0C/cm.\nUnfilled epoxy casting resins usually have only minor variations in\nthermal conductivity. Compounds of high thermal conductivity may\nbe formulated by combining fillers of various types with the resins.\nFactors other than the thermal conductivity of the filler material are\nalso important in determining the conductivity of a filled encapsulating system. The type, size, and distribution by size of the particles\nare important variables. The volume concentration of a filler, for\nexample, is more meaningful than its weight concentration in determining the extent to which thermal conductivity can be increased (ref.\n34). Typical conductivities obtained by filling epoxy systems are as\nfollows: 72 percent by weight of alumina in Epon 828 yields 31.8 x\nCal/sec/cm2/\xe2\x80\x9dC/cm,and 60 percent Be0 by weight in Dow 2673.6\nresin yields 33.1 x\nCal/sec/cm2/OC/cm (ref. 54).

Two curing cycles\nwere evaluated. One anomaly was noted in material cured a t 212" F.\nAlthough the thermal conductivity of the material did not change\nappreciably between 70 and 300" F in vacuum, it dropped from 4.27 x\nlo-* Cal/sec/cm2/"C/cm to 0.6 x\nCal/sec/cm2/0C/cm after exposure to the vacuun for 24 hours at 70" F.

Little change was noted in the thermal\nconductivities of Eccofoam F P and FPH urethane foams during or\nafter their exposure to vacuum (ref. 49).\nThe heat-deflection temperature, which is of great importance in\nstructural applications, is the temperature at which a specified deflection of a, material under specified load and time conditions occurs.\n\n30\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nStandard tests, such as the Vicat indentation test, are available to\nmeasure the softening temperature. Heat-deflection temperatures of\nmost thermosetting plastics are above the maximum temperature\nlimits of embedment materials that can be tolerated by the semiconductor circuit components.\nAnother useful criterion for determining the serviceability of an\nembedment material at elevated temperatures is its maximum operats\ning, or safe-use, temperature. This is frequently expressed a the\ntemperature which a material will withstand without obvious degradation, such as gross distoition, gassing, or charring. The silicones are\nparticularly noted for their capacity to withstand higher temperatures\nthan other classes of polymers. The RTV silicones have typical\noperating-temperature ranges of from -65 to 600\' F (ref. 55); however, their tolerance of 600\' F is limited in time. Typical operating\ntemperature ranges for the epoxy materials are from -65 to 400" F.\nThe maximum operating temperature of polyurethane materials is\nabout 300\' F.\n\ns\nThe electrical characteristics or the physical properties\nelectrical characteristics of an encapsulating material are\nimportance in its selection.

Expressed in volts per mil, the dielectric strength is a measure\nof the electrical strength of the material as an insulator. High dielectric\nstrengths are desirable in encapsulating materials.\nFigure 10 shows dielectric strengths of common encapsulating\nmaterials which were compiled by Drinkard and Snyder (ref. 5), and\nthe minimum dielectric strengths required by applicable NASA\nspecifications. Significant improvements in the dielectric stiecgths of\nsilicone and polyuiethane materials have been achieved in reccnt\nyears.\nThe dielectric strength of Stycast, 1090 was changed by the curing\ncycle (ref. 49). When it was cured 2 hours at 212\' F, this material had\nsignificantly higher dielectric strength than the same material cured\nat room t\'emperitture; in a vacuum, however, the material cured a t\nroom temperature increased slightly in dielectric strength.

In general, the dielectric strength of epoxy, silicone,\nand urethane encapsulating materials drops as temperature increases.\nelectric Constant\n\nThe dielectric constant of a material is the ratio of the capacitance\nof a capacitor containing the material to the capacitance of the same\ncomponent with air replacing the material under test as the dielectric.\nI n general, low values of dielectric constant are best for high frequency\nor power applications in which low power losses are desirable.\nFigure 11 shows the ranges of typical dielectric constants of various\nencapsulating materials available about 1960 (ref. 5). The maximum\nvalues allowable under applicable NASA specifications are indicated\nby the limiting marks. The range shown for the polyurethanes is also\ntypical for solid materials. Foamed polyurethanes have lower dielectric constants, in the range of 1 to 2 (refs. 5 and 39).\nIn most insulating materials, the dielectric, constant increases with\ntemperature, especially at temperatures above a ciitical temperature\nof each material. This was observed in filled and unfilled epoxy systems as the heat-deflection temperatures were approached or exceeded\nand distortion of the material occurred (ref. 35). The dielectric\nstrengths of the epoxy systems at temperatures below the heat-deflection point, however, were affected in various ways by the addition of\nfillers. Mica and zirconium silicate tended to increase substantially\nthe dielectric constant of the systems in which they were employed.\n\n3\n\nPOTTING.ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nDIELECTRIC CONSTANT AT I\nI\n3\n5\n\nPOLYESTERS\n\nI\n\nPOLYURETHA\nFIGURE\n11.-Ranges\n\nof typical values of dielectric constants of cured embedment materials.\n\nThe effect was more pronounced in the more highly filled systems.\nSilicone embedment materials had little change in their dielectric\nconstants after 6000-hour exposures to their maximum operating\ntemperatures (ref. 51).\nThe dielectric constant is also a strong function of frequency, and it\nvaries for each material. I n general, the dielectric constant of both\nfilled and unfilled epoxy systems decreases at the higher frequencies\n(refs. 3 and 35).\nThe power factor is the ratio of the power dissipated (watts) in\nan insulating material to the product of the effective voltage and\ncurrent (volt-ampere) input. It is a measure of the relative dielectric\nloss in the insulation when the system acts as a capacitor. The power\nfactor is dimensionless and is commonly used in measuring the\nquality of insulation. The dissipation factor is the tangent of the\ndielectric-loss angle. Because of the low-loss values ordinarily encountered in insulation, the dissipation factor is practically the\nequivalent of the power factor, and the terms are used interchangeably\n(ref. 5 6 ) . Low values of dissipation factor are favorable, indicating\nan efficient system with low power losses.\nThe silicone materials generally have lower dissipation factors than\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\n33\n\nthe epoxies and solid polyurethanes under similar conditions. Typical\ndissipation factors for silicone materials are from 0.001 to 0.01 (ref. 5).\nRanges of these values for the epoxies and solid polyurethanes are\nfrom 0.01 t o 0.1 (ref. 3) and from 0.03 to 0.08 (ref. 56), respectively.\nPolyurethane foams have values similar to those of the Filicones.\nSlight temperature increases and short-time exposures to vacuum\nhave little effect on the dissipation factors of epoxies and polyurethane\nfoams (ref. 49). The dissipation factors of filled epoxy systems,\nhowever, tend to increase greatly at temperatures near or above the\nheat-distortion point (heat-deflection temperatures) (ref. 35). Silicone\nrubber cured at room temperature retains its low dissipation factor\nduring long-time exposures at 250" C,but it becomes hard after\napproximately 1000 hours at this temperature (ref. 51).\nThe arc resistance is a measure of an electrical breakdown along an\ninsulating surface, caused by the formation of a conductive path on\nthe surface. The extent to which a surface breakdown occurs varies\nwidely among different plastics. Arc resistance is measured in the\ntime (seconds) required for breakdown along the surface of the\nmaterial being measured under standard conditions. Once arcing has\ntaken place along the surface of many plastics, a carbonized track\nhaving relatively low resistance is left behind; consequently, resistance to subsequent arcing is lowered. Surface breakdown is also\naffected by surface cleanliness and dryness. High values of arc resistance indicate greater resistance t o breakdown along the surface and\nare desirable.\nThe arc resistance of epoxy resins has been improved by incorporating silica, mica, zirconium-silicate, or hydrated-aluminum fillers\n(ref. 35). Typical arc-resistance values for filled epoxy systems are\nin the range of 120 to 300 sec (ref. 3). Typical ranges reported for\nglass- and mineral-filled silicone systems are 150 to 250 sec and\n250 to 420 sec, respectively (ref. 56).\nOne of the measures of electrical resistivity is the volume resistivity, which is the electrical resistance between opposite faces\nof a cube of a given material at a given temperature (ref. 57). The\nvolume resistivity is expressed in ohm-cm; it is not the resistance\nper unit volume (ohm/cm3), although this term is sometimes erroneously used. A second measure of the electrical resistance is surface\nresistivity. The surface resistivity is the resistance between two\nopposite edges of a surface film 1 cm square. Since such a film is\nessentially two-dimensional, the units of surface resistivity are\n\n34\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nactually ohms. To avoid confusion with usual resistance values,\nhowever, surface resistivity is sometimes expressed as ohms/cm2.\nThe effects of increasing temperature on the volume-resistivity\nproperties of common encapsulating materials are shown in table IV.\nIn contrast to the behavior of metals, the volume resistivity of all of\nthese materials decreases as the temperatures increase. The silicones,\nhowever, retain their properties much better than the epoxies and\npolyurethanes. ShortItime exposures to vacuum do not significantly\naffect either the volume- or surface-resistivity properties of epoxy,\nsilicone, and polyurethane materials (ref. 49).\n\nTABLE\nIV.-Temperature\neffects on volume resistivity properties of\nelectrical encapsulation materials (resistivity in ohm-em)\nTest temperature,\n\nMaterial\n70\n\nStycast 1090 2\n(EPOXY)\n(ref. 49)\nEC 1663 3\n(Silicone)\n(ref. 57)\nP R 1525 3\n(Polyurethane)\n(ref. 57)\nEccofoam FPH 2 .\n(Polyurethane foam)\n(ref. 49)\n1\n\n3\n\n200\n\nO\n\nF\n\n300\n\n600\n\n3 . 8 1013\n~\n5 . 1 1013\n~\n6 X 1012\n7 x 1012\n\n6 X 10\'2\n8 X 10\'2\n\n3 x 1012\n5 X 1012\n\n5 x 10"\n5 x 1012\n\n2 x 10\'0\n8 X 1011\n\n1x 1012\n2 X 1012\n\n3 x 108\n4 x 1010\n\nAll tests conducted in accordance with ASTM Specification D257.\nRange covers properties of two cure cycles.\nRange covers properties of three cure cycles.\n\nThe effect of increasing temperature on the surface resistivity of\nrepresentative encapsulating materials is shown in table V.

The silicones retain their surface\nresistance much better than the epoxies and the polyurethanes.\nHumidity adversely affects the electrical resistance of the common\nencapsulating materials. This is exemplified in figure 12 by the drop\nin surface resistivity of filled and unfilled epoxy resins as the humidity\nincreases (ref. 56). When tests are being made on a specimen that has\nbeen subjected to moist or humid conditions, it is important that\nmeasurements are made at controlled time intervals during and after\n\n35\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\nTABLE\nV.-Temperature\negects on surface resistivity properties of\nelectrical encapsulation materials (resistivity in ohmlcm)\nTest temperature,\nMaterial\n70\n\nStycast 1090\n(EPOXY)\n(ref. 49)\nE C 1663 3\n(Silicone)\n(ref. 57)\nPR 1525\n(Polyurethane)\n(ref. 57)\nEccofoam F P H\nPolyurethane Foam)\n(ref. 49)\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n200\n\nO\n\nF\n\n300\n\n600\n\n5 X 10\'\'\n8 X 10\'\'\n\n1x 10\'2\n2 x 10\'2\n\n1x 10\'2\n2 x 10\'2\n\n9 X 10"\n2 x 10\'2\n\n8 X 10"\n2 x 10\'2\n\n3 x 10"\n1x 10\'2\n\n2 x 10\'0\n3 x 10"\n\nAll tests conducted in accordance with ASTM Specification D257.\nRanges cover properties of two different cure cycles.\nRanges cover properties of three different cure cycles.\n\nthe test condition has been applied, since dry-out and resistance of\nthe material can increase rapidly. Other conditions that affect the\nresistance properties of the materials are moisture content of the\nspecimen, the amount of the applied voltage, and the time during\nwhich the voltage is applied.\nMeasurements of resistivity have been used in studies t o determine\nreaction rates and the extent of cure in polymers, and to detect\npolymer decomposition (ref. 58). A simple correlation usually exists\nbetween resistivity and reaction time. I n most circumstances, when\nsuch variables as moisture content are controlled, the change in\nresistivity of a thermosetting material during cure is a useful index of\nthe degree of polymerization. A given value of resistivity cannot be\nassociated with a particular degree of curing, however, except a t a\nspecified cure temperature. Plots of resistivity during the process of\ncuring a t two different temperatures may cross as shown schematically\nin figure 13. The resistivity of the "cured" polymer cured at the lower\ntemperature may thus be lower than that of the material cured a t\nthe higher temperature. Resistivity measurements are also effective\nin detecting decomposition resulting from oxidation and heat aging.\nThus resistivity measurements can be useful in the study of polymer\nstability.\n\n3\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nFIGURE\n12.-Effect of humidity on surface resistivity of filled and unfilled epoxy\nresins at 3 5 O C. (Used by permission of Machine Design.)\n\nS\nI n the previous sections, the intrinsic properties of embedment\nmaterials that make t,hem applicable and serviceable have been discussed. To be useful, however, both the embedment materials and\nthe module circuitry must withstand the embedding process. The\nproperties of these materials that are essential to successful fabrication\nof embedded electronic modules are pot life, flow and viscosity,\nexotherm, and curing shrinkage.\nResins themselves are usually stable in storage indefinitely. I n\ntwo-part casting systems, hardeners are mixed with the resin just\nbefore use. Transfer molding compounds, on the other hand, are\nquasi-solid mixtures of resins and hardeners that react very slowly a t\nroom temperature; consequently, they have limited storage life. The\npolymerization reaction ordinarily begins a t a slow rate immediately\nwhen the ingredients are mixed. As the reaction proceeds, the viscosity\nincreases and the mix finally solidifies. The elapsed time between the\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\n37\n\nFIGURE\n13.-Dependence of the volume resistivity during cure on the cure time\nand temperature.\n\nmixing and attainment of a viscosity of the mixture that precludes\nits placement is called the pot life.\nThe pot life of epoxy resins a t room temperature may vary from a\nfew minutes to 6 months (ref. 55). No consistent trend in the effect of\nfillers on the pot life of epoxy resins has been found (ref. 35). The\npot life of some resin-hardener systems was materially lengthened by\nthe addition of fillers. In other systems, however, the addition of\ncertain fillers caused shorter pot lives. Data presented by Volk (ref. 1)\nindicate that increasing the content of a filler which nornially increases\nthe pot life of an epoxy will further extend the pot life.\nThe urethane foam-in-place materials have very short pot lives.\nBecause of their very rapid rates of reaction, frequently less than a\nminute is available for mixing and pouring the materials (ref. 3).\n\n38\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\now and Viscosity\n\nFlow and viscosity are related terms that are applied to two different encapsulation techniques. Flow is an empirical quantity, applicable to transfer molding by using the Hull spiral-mold test, which\nwill indicate the molding properties of a material under a given set\nof test conditions. Viscosity is a fundamental property that is of importance in the casting of embedment materials.\nI n the Hull spiral-mold test, a mold consisting of a continuous,\nuniform spiral groove is employed. The material is fed under pre..\nwwe\ninto the center of the spiral, through which it flows as far as the\ngiven test conditions will force it. The total length of the spiral is\n100 inches. The test is sensitive to pressure, temperature, and to the\ncharacteristics of the material. Spiral flows of a typical low-pressure,\nhigh-flow epoxy molding compound at 300" F after a 10-second preheat are: 28 inches at 125 psi, 38 inches at 250 psi, 53 inches at 500\npsi, 80 inches at 1000 psi, and 100 inches at 2000 psi (ref. 27). The\nspiral flow of a typical heat-resistant epoxy under 250 psi at 300" F\nis 20 inches. The design of the spiral flow mold and the flow test\nprocedure for its use are explained in Epoxy Molding Material\nInstitute Specification EMMI-1.\nLow viscosity is desirable in most casting applications since the\nmore fluid materials handle and pour easily, and will penetrate and\nfill intricate cavities. Optimum viscosities of such materials range from\nless than 100 centipoises (cp) in some formulations to well over\n20 000 cp in more viscous resins. The normal range for casting is\n1000 t o 5000 cp (ref. 1). The applicable NASA specifications have\nthe following viscosity limitations : for epoxies, 500 poises maximum\n(50 000 cp); for silicones, 150 to 320 poises maximum, depending on\ntype; polyurethanes, not less than 100 nor more than 300 poises for\nfreshly mixed ingredients from a two-part kit.\notherm\n\nThe curing reaction of thermosetting resins is always accompanied\nby the evolution of heat, which causes the temperature of the material\nto rise above the ambient temperature. The peak temperature above\nthe ambient temperature is called the exotherm (ref. 1). This temperature can be high, and its value and the time to reach it are important.\nIn large masses of encapsulating compounds, the increases in temperature can be large, and cause excessive curing shrinkage, cracks,\nand even chemical decomposition indicated by charring. The incorporation of a filler into the compound increases its heat capacity\nand tends to reduce its exothermic temperature during cure (ref. 35).\nVolk\'s explanation (ref. 1) of the effect of filler additions on exotherm\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\n39\n\nis slightly different. Volk reasons that since the heat generated is\ndirectly related to the amount of resin polymerized, the addition of\nchemically inert fillers serves to dilute the resin, thus reducing the\nvolume of resin in a given volume of the filled encapsulating material.\nVore (ref. 59) found that the exothermic temperature rise during the\ncure of Stycast 1090 is 29" F with an oven temperature of 122" F, and\n27" F with an oven temperature of 221" F, and is therefore, essentially\nindependent of cure temperature.\nCuring Shrinkage\n\nThe shrinkage of an embedding material during curing is important\nin the encapsulation of electronic devices. A material having a large\namount of shrinkage during cure may develop high stresses within\nthe embedment and may impose large forces on electrical components\nand joints.\nShrinkage values are reported in the literature in two different\n,ways. Drinkard and Snyder (ref. 5) report the linear shrinkage in\ninches/inch; Sperry (ref. 48) and Fischbein and Dichiaro (ref. 60)\nreport volume shrinkage in percent. The shrinkage data compiled\nby Drinkaxd and Snyder are shown in figure 14 (ref. 5 ) . I n this illustration the NASA specification limits are converted from volume\nshrinkage to linear shrinkage. Sperxy (ref. 48) reports volume shrinkage of solid polyurethane materials as from 2 to 5 percent (linear\n\nLl\n\nH\n\n0.\n\nPOXES\n\nPOLYs ULF I&\xe2\x82\xac\n\ns\n\n*Under certain conditions, the ranges of these materials may extend as shown\n\nFIGURE\nl4.-Ranges\n\nof typical values of linear shrinkage during cure of embedment materials.\n\n40\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nshrinkage of from 0.0067 to 0.017 inch/inch). Fischbein and Dichiaro\n(ref. 60) report the shrinkage of several commercial adhesives to be\nin the range of from 2 to 6 pelcent. The addition of fillers to epoxy\nencapsulating materials will significantly reduce the curing shrinkage.\n\n0\nIn addition to the commonly measured mechanical, thermal, and\nelectrical characteristics of embedment materials, which are discussed\nabove, there are some data on how extreme or unusual environments\ncan affect these materials. This section deals with problems arising\nfrom the effects of such phenomena.\nWater Absorption\n\nWater absorption of polymers used foi electronic module embedment is usually less than 1 percent by weight when it is measured by\nthe standard 24-hour exposure to boiling water. Figure 15 shows\nranges of values for the several classes of polymers (ref. 5). Absorptions may be considerably higher in tests of longer duration. Seven-day\nexposure to water at 25\' C of different epoxyhardener systems containing different mineral fillers (ref. 35) showed that while some\nfillers decreased water absorption in all cases other fillers increased\nwater absorption with some epoxy curing agents and not with others.\nSerious loss of adhesive strength has been reported (ref. 61) for a\nvariety of polymers when they were exposed simultaneously to\nmoisture and mechanical stress. This effect has been confirmed by\nother investigators for adhesive-bonded aluminum joints exposed to\nweathering, both stressed and unstressed (refs. 62 and 63). I n humid\nenvironments adhesion failures at the leads, together with internal\nstresses present in the embedment material, can create paths by\nwhich moisture may reach the embedded circuitry. Particular attention should be given to sealing the module\'s leads when long-term\nservice in humid environments is anticipated.\n\nThe environments encountered in space include high vacuum, high\nand low extremes of temperature, and electromagnetic radiation.\nThe effects of space environments on polymers used for module embedment have been extensively studied (refs. 49 and 64 through 69),\nand it has been generally concluded t,hat these materials are serviceable\nunder space conditions fox the time periods presently visualized for\nspace missions.\nSpecial attention must be given to conditioning polymers that will\nbe used inside spacecraft or in specialized unmanned satellites, in order\n\n41\n\nPOLYMERIC EMBEDMENT MATERIALS\n\nWATER ABSORPTION,\nPERCENT/ 2 4 HRS\n0\n\nI\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nE POX IES\n\nPOLYESTERS\n\nI and I I\nC\nI\nSILICONES\nPOLY STYRENES\nPOLY UR E T H A N ES\n*Foams\nFIGURE\n15.-Range\n\nof typical values o water absorption.\nf\n\nto eliminate outgassing of unreacted volatile elements of low molecular\nweight (refs. 46, 70, 71, and 72).\n\nSf erihzation\nEmbedment materials that are resistant to thermal sterilization\ncycles are becoming increasingly important, particularly for modules\nintended for use in lunar and interplanetary space probes and surgical\nimplants. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), under NASA sponsorship, has had an extensive program underway since 1963 to investigate ways of sterilizing materials and components of spacecraft,\nincluding electronic circuitry (refs. 73 through 75). Additional information has been reported by the US. Army (ref. 76) and by North\nAmerican Rockwell Corporation (ref. 77). These investigations indicate\nthat some polymers, including the polyurethanes, degraded and lost\ntheir adhesive properties during sterilization, while others, such as\nthe silicones, improved slightly in their strength and electrical properties. Research to develop superior sterilizable silicon-type polymers\nis being sponsored by NASA (ref. 78).\n\n42\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nechanical Shock and Vibration\n\nA prime reason for embedding electronic circuit modules is to protect delicate electronic components from mechanical forces. Motorola,\nin simple tests of such transmissible vibrations as bouncing and shaking (refs. 79 and SO), has determined the effect of temperature on the\ndamping properties of some silicones and polyurethanes, and has also\nshown that the vibration-transmission spectra of various silicones\nproduced by different manufacturers were markedly different. For\nembedding telemetry circuits that would be subjected to extremely\nhigh shock forces (500 000 g), epoxies were found to be superior to\npolyesters, silicones, phenolics, and urethanes (ref. 39).\nGarland (ref. 81) has reported corrosion of a number of metals by\nthe products of decomposition in various types of insulating materials.\nVapors and extracted materials from polyvinyl chloride were the most\ncorrosive agents that would most readily attack such metals as cadmium, lead, magnesium, and zinc. Polyester, ABS, and diallyl phthalate resins also caused some metal corrosion. Epoxy and polysulfide\npotting compounds were corrosive to copper. Only slight corrosion of\neither anodized or unanodized aluminum was caused by any of the\npolymers studied.\nWeigand and Hanna (ref. 82) showed that gaseous products from\ndecomposing styrene-polyester systems, epoxies, and polyimides can\ncombine with oxygen-containing atmospheres to form explosive mixtures in confined places.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nctionin\nIt is well known that embedment\' causes changes in the electrical\nvalues of some circuit components, particularly coils and capacitors\n(refs. 43, 53, and 83 through 87). These changes are due principally\nto the mechanical stressing of the components caused by curing\nshrinkage, and thermal expansion and contraction of the embedment\nmaterial. The magnitude of the change in electrical properties of\ncomponents can be used as a measure of the stresses in some cases.\nThe presence of these stresses in embedded circuits is of major concern,\nnot so much because of changes in component values, for which\nallowances can be made in the component\'s design, but because the\nstresses can cause damage to the components and fracture of the\ncircuit interconnections. The latest edition of NASA SP-5002 contains an appendix describing problems presently being encountered\nwith failures of solder joints on conformally coated printed-circuit\nboards (ref. 88). Although a number of factors apparently contribute\nto these failures, one of them is the stressing of the solder joints during\nthermal cycling. This is caused by the conformal coating, which has\na coefficient of thermal expansion different from those of the board\nor the components and, in addition, usually undergoes its glass\ntransition within the range of the thermal cycles. (The glass transition is a phenomenon peculiar to polymers that involves a change\nin their character from viscous, rubbery materials at temperatures\nabove their glass transition temperatures to hard, brittle materials\nbelow their transition temperatures.)\n\nST\n\nco\n\ns\n\nWallhausser (ref. 89) makes a distinction between processing\nshrinkage and post-shrinkage of thermosetting plastics. He defines\nprocessing shrinkage somewhat arbitrarily as the difference in dimensions between the molded part and the cool mold that is observed\nafter the part has stood for from 24 to 168 hours at 20\' C and 65\npercent relative humidity. Any dimensional changes that occur\n43\n\n44\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nbeyond this time or as a result of cooling under nonstandard conditions, he calls post-shrinkage.\nWallhausser enumerates five causes for processing shrinkage : Release of moisture from the molding compound, volume reduction by\nreactions to curing, escape of reaction products with low molecular\nweight, differences in thermal contraction between the part and the\nmold during cooling to room temperature, and elastic recoil of the\nmolded material. The causes of post-shrinkage are different, although\nthey may occur simultaneously with those of processing shrinkage.\nThey are largely irreversible and include : Post-curing, release of\noccluded gases, structural changes in resin and filler, and reorientation of filler particles.\nSteele (ref. go), working with a filled epoxy resin and strain-gage\ntransducers, observed increases in internal compressive stress as high\nas 11250 psi over a 16-month period following embedment. This\nwas caused by post-curing. Steele also noted that the stresses could\nnot be relieved by thermal treatments (fig. 16). Johnson and Ryan\n(ref. 85) have also observed an effect in electronic modules that was\nnoted by Wallhausser, that processing shrinkages and the related\ninternal stresses are not isotropic, but are strongly influenced by\n\n1\n3 DAYS\n\nn\n\nI\n\nI MONTH 2 MONTHS 4MONTHS 6 MONTHS IO MONTHS 12 MONTHS 1 MONTHS\n6\n\nFIGURE\n16.-Compressive stress a t -54\' C of a filled epoxy embedment compound during temperature cycling, measured after various intervals of storage\ntime.\n\nEFFECTS O N MODULE FUNCTIONING\n\n45\n\nsuch factors as the shape and position of the mold, processing conditions, and the geometry of the circuitry being embedded.\nStucki, Fuller, and Carpenter (ref. 43), using 0.050-inch diameter\ntoroidal ferrite-core transducers embedded in modules fabricated\nwith epoxy, silicone, and foamed polyurethane embedment materials,\nhave shown that the maximum stresses developed during thermal\ncycling increase as the embedment material becomes more rigid. As\nthe temperature is decreased, approaching the glass transition, internal stresses begin to rise, reaching a plateau at a temperature\nsomewhat below the glass transition. I n figure 17, A and B represent\nrigid epoxies; C and D are semiflexible epoxies; E is a foamed silicone\nrubber; and F is a duplex coating. Low temperature stresses as high\nas 33000 psi were observed in rigid epoxies. One semiflexible resin\ninvestigated had a lower glass transition and a plateau stress of\n23000 psi. Another semiflexible resin showed a maximum stress of\nonly 8000 psi, while a polyurethane foam developed essentially no\nstress over the entire temperature range from 100\' C down to -35" C.\nIt was also found that the addition of a silicone rubber undercoat\nwith the 8000-psi resin had very little effect on the stress detected by\nthe transducer.\nBy using the microtransducers, the investigators were able to measure stresses at different locations in operable circuit modules. They\nfound that for the diode-transistor logic module they examined the\nstresses were usually lower at any given ambient temperature when\nthe module was operating (fig. 18). Generally lower stresses would\nbe expected when the module is operating, because then the embedment material sees a temperature higher than ambient. The important\nresult of their investigation was recognition that stress in the more\nrigid resins is significantly dependent on the temperature.\nLundberg (ref. 86), using a ferrite E-core transformer as his transducer, noted much the same dependence of internal stress on temperature and its relation to the rigidity of materials as Stucki and his\nassociates observed. The most significant finding of Lundberg was\nthat the internal stresses caused by silica fillers assisted in achieving\nthermal expansion-matching &th the embedded circuitry. He found\nthat, although more nearly equal coefficients of thermal\' expansion\nwere obtained, internal stresses in rigid and semirigid embedment\nresins, which were measured by changes in transformer inductance,\nwere actually greater in the filled resins than in the unfilled resins\n(figs. 19 and 20). This effect was attributed to the increase in elastic\nmodulus caused by the filler. Fillers had no effect on transformer\ninductance when used with the very flexible urethane embedment\ncompounds.\nJohnson and Ryan (ref. 85) observed that internal stresses were\n\n46\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n103\n\nPSI\n\n34\n\nX-0\n-3\nx\n\nEMBEDDED\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE, OC\n\n80\n\n10\n0\n\nFIGURE\n17.-Variation of internal stress in electronic modules with temperature.\n(Used by permission of Electronic Production and Packaging.)\n\nlower than expected (considering rigidity) when they used microsphere-filled embedment compounds.

The largest number of weld failures occurred when an unfilled\nepoxy resin was used, which may not be consistent with Lundberg\xe2\x80\x99s\nfindings. No failures were observed with polyurethane foams, but\nsome failures occurred with filled epoxies even when the filler was\nmicrospheres. Dorfman also noted that there was a greater tendency\nfor weld failure when the interconnected welds were widely spaced\nin the modules. He suggested that reducing the lengths of nickelribbon runs in cordwood modules by minimizing the distances between the points they connect will decrease the likelihood of weld\nfailure .\nNikolaychik (ref. 47), apparently following up the investigation\nby Smith, has presented a detailed analysis of the stress to which a\ncross-wire weld terminating an axial-lead component is subjected by\n\n49\n\nEFFECTS ON MODULE FUNCTIONING\n-60\n-50\n\n-r\n\nA\n\nFILLED\nA\n\n-30 -40\n\n-20\n\n- 10\n\n01\n80\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-\n\nUNFILLED\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n60\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n40\n20\n0\nTEMPERATURE ( O F 1\n\nI\n\n-20\n\nI\n-d\n\nI\n\nFIGURE\n20.-Transducer inductance change as a function of\nambient temperature for semirigid epoxies.

Before being embedded,\nlengths of ribbon were cross-wire welded to the leads. Outputs of the\nstrain gages were converted to loads and plotted. The hysteresis\ncurves in figures 21 and 22 show the variations in load during temperature cycling on the welds of two transducers which were embedded\nin different commercial epoxies. Curing stresses and their changes\nwith time were also observed. Compressiveloads as large as 50 pounds\nand tensile loads of up to 45 pounds on the axial leads were reported\non different transducers.

Failure rates of solid-state components\nare strong functions of operating temperature, doubling with every\n18\' C rise (ref. 99). Consequently, reductions of only a few degrees\nare worthwhile.\nUse of internal heat sinks is sometimes sufEcient to prevent local\nhot spots that, in addition to degrading components, can cause local\novercuring of the embedment compound. Thermally conductive\n(metal-filled) cements can be used to assure good thermal contact\nof the component with the sink. Silicone grease, special grades of\nwhich are fairly good thermal conductors without being electrical\nconductors, should be substitlutedfor the metal-filled cements if there\nis any danger of shorting the component\'s leads.

Silicon surfaces must be specially protected with passive\nfilms prior to embedment. The method of production used in these\nhigh-volume applications is transfer molding. The small size of microcircuits does not eliminate the problems, previously discussed, pertaining to older, larger types of circuits. Power densities in microcircuits are often very high, and heat dissipation is a continuing\nproblem. The fragility of leads and interconnection bonds imposes\nlimits on allowable stresses in handling and embedment. References\n101 through 106 contain further information on these and other\napplications of modular embedment, which are now evolving. The\nremainder of this report will deal with the embedment of cordwood\nand planar circuit-board modules.\n\nE\nUp to about 1964, the established method of module embedment\nwas by casting a pourable resin around the circuitry. Small volumes\nof production, and the unavailability of small-scale transfer-molding\nequipment and soft-flow resins appeared to rule out the transfermolding process, except for a few high-production modules of rugged\nconstruction. This situation is now rapidly changing, and transfer\nmolding is replacing casting as the preferred method of embedment.\nProcedures for transfer molding, however, have not yet been formally documented. Table V I itemizes the pertinent NASA procedures for the embedment of modules, which contain much detailed\ninformation on the step-by-step techniques of the embedment process.\nBecause these and other similar documents are readily available,\nthe following discussions will deal principally with recent developments.\n\nThe casting of liquid resin into an open mold cavity containing the\nmodular circuit is a familiar process in many plants. This process\nrequires large numbers of individual molds and considerable physical\nspace to accommodate the resin-mixing, degassing, mold-assembly,\n53\n\n54\n\nPOTTING ELECTRONIC MODULES\n\nTABLEI.-National Aeronautics and Space Rdministration procedures\nV\nrelated to embedment of electronic modules and connectors\nSpecification\nMSFC-PROC-186C\nMSFC-PROC-196B\nMSFC-PROC-257A\nMSFC-PROC-293A\nMSFC-PROC-310\nMSFC-PROC-380\nMSFC-PROC-412\nMSFC-PROC-442\nNASA-TM X50354\n\nSpecification title\nPotting and Molding Cable Assemblies, Using Elastomeric Compounds, Procedure for.\nPotting Cable Assemblies, Using\nEpoxy Resin Compounds, Procedure for.\nConformal Coating (Epoxy), Application of, Procedure for.\nCoating, Conformal, (Polyurethane),\nPrinted Circuit Assemblies,\nProcedure for.\nPotting of Electrical Distributors,\nProcedure for.\nPotting, Encapsulating and Molding, Using Silicone Rubber, Procedure for.\nModules, Electronic, Encapsulating,\nProcedure for.\nUse of Formed-in-Place, Polyurethane for Electronic Equipment.\nInstruction No. 7, Technical Information.

The casting process is well\nestablished, however, and is capable of giving excellent results.\nI t is possible to cast bodies having tolerances as small as f O . O O 1\ninch if proper attention is given to the resin formulation and to\nminimizing the exotherm (ref. 107). Satisfactory production-casting\ntolerances have been achieved using silicone rubber. molds (ref. 108),\nsilicone rubber mold faces backed with metal (ref. 103), and plastisol\nmolds (ref. 109). Any of these mold materials offers savings in moldpreparation costs and greater convenience in production than the\nmore common metal molds (fig. 23).\nAthough some work has been done with the centrifuging of filled\nmolds as a means of obtaining sound embedments (ref. 110), degassing\nof the liquid resin by vacuum prior to its use appears to be a much more\n\nPRODUCTION M E T H O D S FOR E M B E D M E N T\n\n55\n\nPOLISHED INSIDE SURFACE\n\nFIGURE\n23.-Exploded\n\nview of mold for casting embedment materials around\nelectronic circuits.\n\npractical method of eliminating porosity. When casting microspherefilled resin systems, special care must be taken to ensure that the\nmicrospheres are uniformly distributed just prior to pouring, because\nthey tend to separate from the resin. Stirring must be done gently t o\navoid rupturing the relatively fragile spheres.\n\nTransfer molding is done with gelled, or B-stage resin systems that\nare in the form. either of granular solids or compact preforms. The\nresin charge is first heated in a cylindrical chamber for a predetermined\ntime, after which it is forced through a suitable channel into a closed\nmold containing the electronic circuit. Final curing takes place in the\nmold, but transfer-molding resins are compounded to have very\nrapid curing times, of the order of seconds to several minutes. Multiple\ndie cavities can be used to produce large numbers of embedded items\nper shot. The transfer-molding process is described in detail in\nreferences 4, 27, 111, and 112. The advantages of transfer molding\nover casting, as they pertain to production rates and cleanliness of\nthe production area, are at once apparent. There is also evidence\n(ref. 113) that transfer molding, when used to embed identical modules,\ncan give a better quality embedment than casting.\nTIansfer-molding embedments of electronic modules were done on a.\nh g e scale for the Pershing weapon system by the Martin Company\n(ref. 114). Since that program, Martin has continued t o use the technique in research and in production. A recent report (ref. 115) listed\nmeasurements of the properties of several commercially available\ntransfer molding compounds (table VII).

Weight losses given\ntorr, but the duration of the\nare all under 0.003 percent at\noutgassing tests was inadvertently omitted from the report.\nI a module is to be embedded by transfer molding, care should be\nf\ntaken to ensure uniform and complete filling of the die cavity with\na minimum of turbulence. Dead spaces that result in voids should be\neliminated. Transfer-molding resins are designed to flow at low\npressures during molding, but some forces will inevitably be exerted\non the circuitry, which must be able to resist them.\nTypical transfer-molding compounds will contain powdered fillers.\nCompounds with fibrous fillers do not generally flow well. Some work\nhas been done with microsphere-filled transfer-molding compounds\nwith apparent success, despite their fragility (ref. 112).\nMolds required for transfer molding are two- or three-piece steel\nmolds, which are often chromium plated for resistance to wear. Some\nmolds are designed so they can be evacuated prior to entry of the\nresin, but most of them are merely vented. Molds for embedment of\nelectronic modules and components are small and light enough to be\ninserted into and removed from the molding machine by a single\noperator, and are usually equipped with insulated handles for this\npurpose. The problem of mold inventory, which is a serious one in\nan electronics development laboratory, has largely been overcome by\nspecial mold designs that incorporate removable metal inserts to\nadjust the size and shape of the cavity to one of a number of standard\nsizes.\nThe wider availability of laboratory-scale transfer-molding presses,\nsoft-flow embedment resins, and imaginative mold designs, together\nwith the current interest in transfer molding for embedding transistors,\nintegrated circuits, and hybrid microcircuits, will stimulate the use of\ntransfer molding as a routine method of embedding many discrete\ncomponents in the near future.\n\ns\n1.
