It is found that, if the light-crossing time of the whole BELR is significantly larger than the separation between observations, then an apparent asymmetry in line profiles and time development of both line fluxes and profiles would be expected. The lack of such confirmed developments suggests that a major part of the BELR in these QSOs is not considerably larger than one light-month. In one case, the net change is found to be narrower than the static part of H-beta. This may imply that the inner parts of the BELR have a smaller velocity dispersion. A redshift of about 700 km/s relative to the narrow forbidden O III is found in the QSO 0026+129. This sets an upper limit to the central mass as 6 x 10 to the 9th solar if the size of the BELR is not larger than five light-months.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "333", "submissionId": 19890023046, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "a8843dcf4d9d42beab53ef2ecfd4ae38", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1988-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
