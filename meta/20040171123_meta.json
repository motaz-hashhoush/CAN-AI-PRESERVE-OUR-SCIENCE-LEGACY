A first step in developing and demonstrating the necessary technologies to support solar-powered exploration could be a 100-kWe-class solar-powered platform in Earth orbit. This platform would utilize advanced technologies in solar power collection and generation, power management and distribution, thermal management, and electric propulsion. It would also provide a power-rich free-flying platform to demonstrate in space a portfolio of technology flight experiments. This paper presents a preliminary design concept for a 100-kWe solar-powered satellite with the capability to use high-powered electric propulsion, and to flight-demonstrate a variety of payload experiments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20040171123, "endDate": "2004-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "55th International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Vancouver", "id": "cfdaf006dc1b4936b41470e5df425a21", "startDate": "2004-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040171123, "id": "5e8d1d34a8894cea9a3f7fdae22bca49", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040171123.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040171123/downloads/20040171123.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040171123/downloads/20040171123.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040171123/downloads/20040171123.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
