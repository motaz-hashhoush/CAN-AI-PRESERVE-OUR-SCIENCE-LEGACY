DTIT - PAST .- PRESENT AND FUTURE.\nBy A. E. Dunstan and F. B. Thole.\n\nThe volatile fuel of the high-speed internal combustion engine\nhas, in the past, consisted almost exclusively of the lighter distillates from crude petroleum. In earlier days, when the value of\nkerosene far exceeded that of gasoline, the latter being practically a waste by-product, motor fuel had a final boiling point averaging 1200 C. With increasing demand for motor spirit the upper\nlimit of boiling point of this fraction steadily rose till today\nit frequently reaches 2200C. This increase in average boiling\npoint of the fuel has both advantages and disadvantages. It means\nthat a much larger proportion of crude petroleum can be utilized\nas motor fuel, while the higher specific gravity of modern gasoline\nmeans that a larger quantity of energy, measured in British thermal\nunits, is contained in a gallon of the spirit than was formerly the\ncase. On the other hand, the higher proportion of less volatile\nhydrocarbons renders starting less easy and effective vaporization\nmore difficult, with the consequent troubles of uneven carburetjon\nand possibly even dilution of the lubricating oil. These lastmentioned drawbacks are more or less overcome in modern engines by\nheating the inlet manifold, a somewhat unsatisfaetory compromise\nsince for fullest efficiency the explosive mixture should be as\ncold as is permissible.\n* Read before International Air Congress, London, 1923.\n\nFAW\n\n-2-A more serious difficulty lies in the fact that the heavier\n"paraffinoid" hydrocarbons in gasoline, when vaporized and mixed\nwith air, give a mixture somewhat susceptible to "detonation," i.e.,\npropagation of the explosion with a velocity far greater than that\nof the normal explosive wave. This excessively rapid explosion,\ninstead of being converted into effective propulsive power, gives\na hammer-like blow to the cylinder and piston resulting in the\nwell-known "pinking- 11 This tendency to detonationincreaes rapidly as the compression ratio is raised, and. as higher efficiency\nresults from increased compressicn ratio the trend of modern aircraft engineering is to produce engines with s high a compression\nthat normal straight-run petroleum distillates consisting of paraffin hydrocarbons can hardly be USCd.D\nThe limitation of final boiling point to 1500 C laiddown in the\nAir Ministry specification for engine spirit has the twofold object\nof obtaining a readily vaporizable fuel and of excluding these higher boiling paraffirr hydrocarbons which are prone to detonation in\naircraft engines. It has the serious result, however, of limiting\nthe amount of gasoline available both for aircraft and for transport\npurposes, for an increase in the demand for the aviation "cream"\ninvolves a disproportionately greater limitation in the volume of\ntransport "milk" available, since the latter cannot be skimmed be"\nyond a certain degree. Modern fuel research is directed to the\ndouble problem of increasing the supplies of gasoline ancl of discovering ingredients - which may or may not be fuels - which will overcome the detonation difficulty . and so enable heavier grades of pe-\n\n- 3 troleum to be used.\nMuch of our knowledg8 regarding the effects of compression\nratio on the efficiency of engines and on the suitability of the\nvarious-fuels employed is due to Ricardo. He proved by using a\nvariable compression engine that, while paaffinoid hydrocaibo:i,\nand to a somewhat less degree naphthenic hydrocarbons, are rather\nprone to detonation, benzole, toluol and xylol will withstand very\nhigh compression ratios without detonation occurring. The presence\nof these aromatic hydrocarbons is t herefore of considerable value\nin a motor spirit, and especially in an aviation spirit. In oTder\nto obtain a spirit which can be used without marked tendency , to\ndetonation in high-compression engines, the Air Ministry specifications, besides exclu.ing hydrocarbons boiling above 150 0 C, insist\non the presence of a certain rninirnunr proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Some spirits from Borneo,\n\nSumatra, Burmah\n\nand Persia al-\n\nready contain these aromatic hydrocarbons, but most other spirits\nhave to be blended with the \'oenzole and tol\xc3\xbcol derived from coal\nto fulfill the requirements.\nThe question at once arises as to the\n\npossibility\n\nof procuring\n\nsufficient material to fulfill these requirements In the event of\nwar or of widely increased development of aircraft. Obviously, in\nthe former case the demands on aromatic hydrocarbons for exDlosives\'\nsupply , will be enormous, and will create a serious strain, not oii1.v\nonthe coal tar, coal gas and coke oven industries, but also on\nthose petroleums which contain notable amounts of benzene-and\n\ntcI-\n\nuene. Benzole is, however, by no means the only substance which\n\npossesses "anti-detonating" qualities. A considerable range of alternative fuels capable of incorporation with gasoline are available\nto serve the double function of increasing the volume of spirit at\nour disposal and improving its qualities for aircraft use.\nAlternative and Supplementary Engine Fuels.\nTetralin, Dekalin and Tetralin-Extra.\nCoal tar contains a large amount of naphthalene, the potential\nproduction in this country being of the order of 50,000 tons per\nyear, although the present demand is small. The quantity could be\ngreatly increased in all coal-producing countries. Although an admirable fuel, it is a solid melting at 8000 and not readily soluble\nin petrol, so that its utilization as such hs obvious disadvantages.\nBy union with hydrogen, the solid naphthalene is converted into\na mobile liquid, and two distinct compounds are obtained according\nto whether one or both of the benzine rings are hydrogenated.These are tetrahydronaphthalene or tetralin, cH 12 (b.p. 2060C),\nand decahydronaphthalene or dekalin, Q H\t\n\n(b.p 175 0 c). As in\n\nthe case of the hydrogenation products of benzine, there is acom-.\nplete change in the characteristic odor on hydrogenation and alteration in the physical properties, there being a steady lowering-of\nthe boiling point and the specific gravity as the substance is hydrogenated. The hydrogenation seems to take place in two stages\nonly, either one or both of the benzine rings being saturated, no\nintermediate partially-saturated rings being formed. There is, however, an intermediate product between tetralin and dekalin, knovTn\n\n-5as \'tetralin extra, a mixture of about 20 per cent tetralin and\n80 per cent dekalin. Dekalin is a, completely saturated body and\ntherefore practically chemically inert, but tetralin is partially\nunsaturated, and is therefore capable of reaction In many ways.\nTetralin acts as a benzole homologue, except as regards its\nreaction with oxygen. An alkaline solution of tetralin, unlike\nbenzine and hexahydrobenzine, decolorizes potassium permanganate.\nTetralin is also capable of autoxidation in the same way as unsaturated hydrocarbons such as turpentine. If exposed to the air for\na long time or evaporated over a water bath at a low temperature,\nit resinifies.\nTetralin has been suggested as an engine fuel when mixed with\nbenzole, alcohol or petrol. Its high boiling point would preclude\nits use undiluted.\nCyclo-hexene.\nWhen phenol is reduced by hydrogen in the presence of nickel,\nthe alcohol cyclohexanol is produced. Catalytic dehydration of\nthis yields cyclo-hexene, which, boiling at 82 - 84 0 C, is a colorless liquid resembling petroleum. In a similar way the homologues\nof phenol yield t etrahydro-aromat 1c hydrocarbons.\nAlcohol Fuel Derived from Coke Oven Gases.\nIt is very well known that coke oven gas, coal gas and the gases from cracking heavy oil, and from general distillation plant,\ncontain unsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene and propylene. These reactive bodies are. soluble in sulphuric acid yielding\nalkyl hydrogen sulphates, which after hydrolysis give alcohols.\n\n-6 The alkyl sulphates are lydrolyzed by means of superheated\nsteam and the alcohol distilled off. The residual diluted acid is\nreconcentrated. The experiments at Skinningrove where coke oven\ngas was purified from hydrogen sulphide, carbon bisuiphide and carbon dioxide, and then passed through 95 per cent sulphuric acid at\n600 C - 800 C, showed that 70 to 80 per cent of the ethylene was absorbed quite rapidly. The concentration of the acid was reduced to\n77 per cent during the absorption and after hydrolysis to 74 per cent.\nIn the case of gases from cracking processes, the problem\n\nIS\n\ncomplicated because in addition to ethylene there are present propylenes, butylenes, and also diolefines such as butadiene, all of.\nwhich are soluble in and combine with sulphuric acid. Selective\ntreatment of the purified gases with different strengths of acid\nand at different temperatures will yield the desired alkyl compounds\nfrom which the alcohols may be obtained in the usual way. A further line of attack is to convert the olefines into chiorhyclrins by\nthe action of aqueous hypochiorous acid. The chlorhydrins are reactive compounds, and by regulated treatment with alkalis they yield\ninner ethers. These ethers are combustible and potential fuels.\nThe first member of the series,\xc3\xa9thylene oxide, boils at 12 0 C and\nhas specific gravity 0.898. Propylene oxide boils at 35\xc2\xb0C and isobutylene at 51\xc2\xb0C.\nThe great potentialities in \'the production of alcohol from the\nfermentation of sugar waste and from the hydrolysis of va-rious naturally occurring bodies (wood, starch, etc.) has been so widely described and discussed that the matter need not be elaborated here.\n\n-7Alcohol per se will probably not be used as a motor fuel at\nany Tate in the near future. Its immediate advantage appears to\nlie in the fact that it withstands high compressions and is exceedingly reluctant to detonate. It would therefore find its ideal use\nin a gasoline blend or for subsidiary use in cases where detonation\nhas already set in. A serious difficulty lies in the fact that owing to its inevitable water content, commercial alcohol will n3t\nreadily blend in small proportions with gasoline. Mich research is\nyet needed on this subject.\nVarious mixtures of alcohol with liquids of high vapor tensions\nhave been proposed. The obvious liquid, ether, is used in natalite,\nand can very readily be obtained by passing alcohol vapor over heated alumina.\nAcetone also is of service in this connection, and is obtained\nby the destructive distillation of calcium acetate.\nImportant work on the production of acetone by ferrnentatiorr\nhas been carried out by Fernbach, who, by means of a special bacillus,\nhas been able to ferment starch into butyl alcohol and acetone\nAcetone boils at 56 0 C, and is therefore sufficiently volatile to ensure easy starting.\nA fuel blend containing acetone is described by Ricardo (E.P.\n183577) as containing 60 per cent alcohol, 20 per cent acetone, 10\npercent water.\nA new field of supplies is opened out by the work of Perg:i:,\nwho claims to have successfully hydrogenated not only heavy\num residues, but also coal, and to have produced considerable arounts\n\n-8-of light hydrocarbons therefrom. The operation consists in h.at)ng\nheavy oil or coal to its incipient cracking tem p eratur, and\n\nt1e11\n\nhydrogenating at the moment when the molecules arc at .the point of\nscission. The pressure needed for this procedure is relatively im-mense and of the order of 100 atmospheres. Consequently, the plant\nmust be constructed to withstand very great stresses and must be\nisolated when working. The work of Be:gi.us may be of the g:atss;\nimportance, seeing\' that every coal f:iid becomes a potential oil\nfield. It hasyet to be proved that the light fractions are equivalent to straight-run gasoline in operation, but it is clear that\nif or when large amounts of spirit are produced. Oy this process,\nthe motor industry would be able to utilize it.\nSomewhat analogous to. the research of Bergius is the investigation of Fischer, who has shown that coal, heated with sodium formate\nor with carbon monoxide and steam, yielded very considerable amounts\nof oil, and within the same category comes the production of coal oil\nby the various low temperature carbonization processes which are\nslowly advancing towards the goal of commercial success.\nAlthough the time is not ripe for the production and utiliza\xe2\x80\xa2\ntion of oil derived from coal, the period approaches when shale\nproducts will prove an inevitable adjunct to petroleum, ultimately\nperhaps to supplant it.. The venerable Scottish oil industry is\nstill with us, and will remain for all time a monument to the persistence, skill, foresight and courage of its founders and operators.\nThe present yield of shale oil is, however, a very small part indeed\nof that needed to supply the country\'s demand, and it is to the great\n\n-9-.\ndeposits of Utah, Colorado, Australia, etc., that industry must look\nfor sup plies. Just as we are now living in the petroleum age, so\nwithout any doubt will the immediately following generations have\ntheir being in the oils derived from coal and shale.\nEngineering progress will be fully tested in developing aircraft and road motors for the utilization of heavier fuels than\ngasoline; already, in fact, have interesting experiments been carried out in the direction of employing both road and aero-engines\nof the Diesel type. . There is a huge reservoir of intermediate oil\nyet to be made use of, since for every ton of gasoline the average\ncrude petroleum yields from five to twenty tons of kerosene and\nheavier oils. Much attention is at p resent directed to cracking\nthese heavy oils in order to convert them partly into gasoline, but\nit would clearly be.more logical to devise engines to suit the fuel\navailable rather than to convert the latter into gasoline at the expense of costly plant and considerable losses in material.\nThe work of Ricardo on the resisting powers of various fuels\nand fuel blends to detonation at high compression has been continued\nby Midgeley and Boyd, and results of the highest potential value\nhave been obtained.\nRicardo has demonstrated that certain fuels such as benzoie,\nand more particularly alcohol, when mixed with kerosene or heavy\ngrade petrol, diminish its tendency to detonate, but the quantity\nof \'anti-detonating fuel" necessary is considerable, little improvement resulting until 10 per cent or more of the new component is\n\n- 10 added. Considerable interest attaches to the value of hydrogen in\nthis connection, since as the fuel of an airshi p is consumed the\nlifting power necessary diminishes and hydrogen becomes available\nand may have to be blown to waste. Since hydrogen is not prone to\ndetonation, the ingenious and effective scheme has been suggested\nof supplying the engines of an airship with a mixture of heavy grade\npetrol, or even kerosene, with hydrogen in appropriate quantity to\nbalance fuel load against lifting capacity.\nMidgeley and Boyds researches have been directed: not only to\nthe moderate anti-detonating qualities of fuels such as benzole,\nbut also the extraordinarily effective anti-detonating influence of\nvery small quantities of "dopes-" Thus, 1 pr cent of xylidine is\nas effective as an anti-detonator as 15 per cent of benzole. Certain organic compounds of tin, selenium, tellurium and lead have a\nstill greater value, the relative efficiencies for this purpose of\nbenzole, xylidi.ne, diethyl selenide and lead tetraethyl being represented by the figures 1, 15, 1,200 and 22,000. It would indeed\nseem not improbable that in the near future heavy grades of gasoline or gasoline-kerosene blends containing an infinitesimal quantity of "anti-detonator" will be available for use in ultra high efficiency engines provided with auxiliary vaporizing and supercharging devices. Cooperation in such research between chemists and engineers should give us a power unit as far ahead of the present\naircraft engine as that is from the steam engine of the earliest\nflying machines.\n\n'
