b'Environment\n\nWater Purification\n\n0\n\nver the past two decades, NASA and\nits contractors have conducted extensive research on how to assure pure\nwater for manned spacecraft crews\nand how to recycle wastewater for reuse on\nfuture long duration spacecraft. This work\nhas given rise to a large number of spinoff\nproducts and products for cleansing and\ndetoxifying water (see also\npages 55 and 110-113) and\nin some cases inspired the\nformation of new companies to commercialize the\ntechnology.\nAmong the latter is\nSensible Technologies, Inc.\n(STI), Irmo, South\nCarolina, a company\nformed in 1989 to exploit a\nparticular NASAdeveloped\nwater purification technology known as silver ionization. In this method, developed in the mid-1960s by\nJohnson Space Center, a\n\' small lightweight generator\ndispensed silver ions in the\npotable water supply of the\nApollo spacecraft to kill\nbacteria in the water.\nST1 originally\nfocused on using the\n,cchnology for cleansing swimming pools,\nbut its effectiveness in purifying water and\neliminating corrosive chemicals led company president Tommy Wood to seek other\napplications, such as industrial cooling\ntowers and industrial process coolers.\nWood recognized that, although\ncopper/silver ionization could successfully\neliminate algae and bacteria, something\nmore was needed to fulfill all the water man-\n\nagement needs\nof recirculating\nand evaporative\ncooling water\nsystems; the\n~urification\nsvstem must also\nbe capable of\neliminating corrosion, debris\nand scale, the\nplaque-like mineral precipitate that builds up in a water\nsystem\'s plumbing, reduces the system\'s\nefficiency and elevates maintenance costs.\nST1 therefore developed a system\nthat employs three distinct technologies.\nThe NASA copper/silver ionization process\nis the core technology, to which ST1 added\ncapabilities for centrifugal separation of\nsolids from liquids and magnetic field water\nmodification. Says STI\'s Tommy Wood:\n"Our systems do an excellent job of\neliminating scale, corrosion, algae, bacteria\nand debris from process water, but there is\nan additional benefit; because of the NASA\ntechnology we employ, our systems destroy\nwaterborne bacteria and viruses, including\nLegzonella pneumophila, the bacterium\nresponsible for Legionnaire\'s Disease."\nThe ST1 Cooling Water Management System integrates a pump, the centrifugal solids separator, the copper/silver\nbiocide generator and magnetic field generators into a simply installed, easily operable\nequipment package that takes up only six\nsquare feet of space in most applications\nand totally eliminates the need for water\ntreatment chemicals and water bleeding.\nST1 manufactures the system in\nthree capacities: the STI400, STI-1100 and\nSTI-2200 for evaporative cooling systems of\nI\n\nup to 400, 1,100 and 2,200\ntons respectively. Larger\nsystems are custom built\non request.\nAt far left is the STI1100 unit and in the top left\nphoto a closeup of the biocide generator (the ST1400\nhas two pairs of electrodes,\nthe STI-1100 three pairs and\nthe STI-2200 four pairs).\nThe copper and silver ions\nproduced by the generator\nkill the algae, bacteria and\nviruses in the water. The\ncentrifugal separator\nremoves all waterborne\ndebris. The magnetic field\ngenerators remove existing\nscale, bar further scale\nbuildup and prevent corrosion. At bottom left is a control panel with a gloved hand\ndisplaying a sample of scale\nremoved from an industrial\ncool in^ water svstem.\n,\nST1 systems have\nfound a wide range of applications. For example, a system is operating on a cooling tower at General Motors Truck and Bus\nEngineering Center, Troy, Michigan; above\nright, STI\'s Jeff Jones is cleaning the pump\nstrainer basket of a unit installed at the center. The GM cooling system was completely\ndescaled within the first month, corrosion\nwas eliminated and the water, once rust colored and opaque, is now clear. Other examples of industrial cooling water installations\nare a system in a process cooling tower at\nAVX Corporation, Myrtle Beach, South\nCarolina, and another in a closed-loop\n0\n\n-\n\nprocess cooling system at Canbraco\nIndustries, also at Myrtle Beach.\nOther systems are operating in\namusement parks, to prevent corrosion and\ncleanse the water of such facilities as bumper\nboat pools and miniature golf ponds; in ice\nmanufacture, protecting pure water in\natmospheric tanks from bacterial infestation;\nand in commercial/residential pools and\nspas, where the systems offer chemical\nsavings and labor savings in addition to\nsanitary water. \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n'
