Catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon feedstock with the aid of supported transition metal catalysts - also known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) - has become popular to produce single-walled and multi-walled nanotubes (SWNTs, MWNTs) and multiwalled nanofibers (MWNFs). The ability to grow CNTs on patterned substrates and in vertically aligned arrays, and the simplicity of the process, has made CVD growth of CNTs an attractive approach.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 20030063130, "name": "Girvan Venture Advisory Board Meeting", "id": "9678317a68474544ad21e770effbf19e", "startDate": "2003-05-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030063130, "id": "47c6ac7db35d438a98589e2c9a2a14ed", "publicationDate": "2003-05-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
