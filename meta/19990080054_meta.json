Representative chemical vapor-deposited (CVD), sintered, and composite materials were evaluated by furnace and high-pressure burner rig exposures. Although protective SiO2 scales formed in all cases, the evidence presented supports a model based on paralinear growth kinetics (i.e., parabolic growth moderated simultaneously by linear volatilization). The volatility rate is dependent on temperature, moisture content, system pressure, and gas velocity. The burner tests were thus used to map SiO2 volatility (and SiC recession) over a range of temperatures, pressures, and velocities. The functional dependency of material recession (volatility) that emerged followed the form A[exp(-Q / RT)](P(sup x)v(sup y). These empirical relations were compared with rates predicted from the thermodynamics of volatile SiO and SiOxHy reaction products and a kinetic model of diffusion through a moving boundary layer. For typical combustion conditions, recession of 0.2 to 2 micrometers/hr is predicted at 1200 to 1400 C, far in excess of acceptable long-term limits.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990080054, "id": "c7a1eb7d90864d3095920e86247230c4", "publicationDate": "1999-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990080054.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990080054/downloads/19990080054.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990080054/downloads/19990080054.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990080054/downloads/19990080054.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
