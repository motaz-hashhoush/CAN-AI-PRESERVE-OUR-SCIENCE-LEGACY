b'National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA Case Study\nBy Kathryn Crowe and Michael Williams\n\nMSFC-CS1003-1\nRev. 09/10/15\n\nSLS Test Stand Site Selection\n\nFinding a Field for Green Running\nTest site selection is a critical element of the\ndesign, development and production of a new system.\nWith the advent of the new Space Launch System\n(SLS), the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) had a number of test site\nselection decisions that needed to be made early\nenough in the Program to support the planned Launch\nReadiness Date (LRD).\nThis case study focuses on decisions that needed\nto be made in 2011 and 2012 in preparation for the\nApril 2013 DPMC decision about where to execute\nthe Main Propulsion Test that is commonly referred to\nas \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Run.\xe2\x80\x9d Those decisions relied upon\ncooperative analysis between the Program, the Test\nLab and Center Operations.\nThe SLS is a human spaceflight vehicle\nFigure 1 SLS Vehicle (Block 1) by Elements (NASA)\ndesigned to carry a crew farther into space than\nhumans have previously flown. The vehicle consists of four parts: the crew capsule, the upper\nstage, the core stage, and the first stage solid rocket boosters. The crew capsule carries the\nastronauts, while the upper stage, the core stage, and solid rocket boosters provide thrust for the\nvehicle. In other words, the stages provide the \xe2\x80\x9clift\xe2\x80\x9d part of the lift vehicle. In conjunction with\nthe solid rocket boosters, the core stage provides the initial \xe2\x80\x9cget-off-the-ground\xe2\x80\x9d thrust to the\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nDisclaimer: Copyright \xc2\xa92016 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The ignition of the four core stage engines and two solid rocket boosters is the first step\nin the launch portion of the mission. The solid rocket boosters burn out after about 2 minutes of\nflight, and are then jettisoned. The core stage provides thrust until the vehicle reaches a specific\naltitude and speed, at which point the core stage is shut off and jettisoned, and the upper stage\nprovides vehicle thrust for subsequent mission trajectories.\nThe integrated core stage primarily consists of a liquid oxygen tank, a liquid hydrogen tank,\nand the four core stage engines. For the SLS program, four RS-25 engines were selected as the\nfour core stage engines. The RS-25 engine is the same engine that was used for Space Shuttle.\nThe test plan for the integrated core stage was broken down into several segments:\nComponent testing, system level testing, and element level testing. In this context, components\nare items such as valves, controllers, sensors, etc. Systems are items such as an entire engine, a\ntank, or the outer stage body. The core stage itself is considered to be an element. The rocket\nengines are also considered an element. At the program level, it was decided to perform a single\ngreen run test on the integrated core stage prior to shipment of it to Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC) for use in the EM-1 test flight of the SLS vehicle. A green run test is the first live fire of\nthe new integrated core stage and engine elements \xe2\x80\x93 without boosters of course.\nThe SLS Program had to decide where to perform SLS green run testing.\n\nPropulsion Testing at NASA\nHistorically, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s larger rocket and motor program infrastructure support has been\ngenerational. For example, the Apollo program spanned from the 1950s to the 1970s, with\ninfrastructure development at Marshall mainly in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure was\nmodified to also support the Shuttle program. Infrastructure work at Stennis Space Center (SSC)\nbegan in 1961 when it was known as the Mississippi Test Facility. The site was also named the\nMississippi Test Operations and the National Space Technology Laboratories until 1988 when it\nwas renamed for Mississippi senator and space program supporter John C. Stennis.\nThe test stands at SSC supported the Apollo/Saturn, and Shuttle programs. Much of the\ninfrastructure needed to test Shuttle propulsion was designed and developed in the early years of\nthe Shuttle program in the 1970s. During the early Shuttle period, the Agency had very limited\ndata processing capabilities and learned much about applied physics relating to large rockets\nfrom the first Shuttle launch. Shuttle testing and development continued from the 1970s to the\nearly 2000s, first at Marshall and then at Stennis. Shuttle propulsion testing was moved to\nStennis around 1996. The Agency started to significantly reduce the quantity and expense of test\nsupport facilities to control costs as the Shuttle program drew to a close.\nIn interim years, between programs, maintenance of test facilities fell mostly upon Center\nMaintenance and Operations (CM&O) funding since program testing was complete. Starting\naround 2004, the Agency began to make a number of strategic decisions to help reduce the\nCM&O infrastructure cost after Shuttle. These decisions impacted the Solid Rocket Booster\n\nMSFC Chief Knowledge Officer\n\n2 of 7\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa92016 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.

The initial baseline for SLS was that the same tests\nenvisioned for Constellation would be needed, since the rocket and missions were similar. SLS\nconsidered using the MSFC stand for main propulsion testing.\n\nRunning the Options\nOnce the number of hot-fires for the integrated core stage had been selected, the next step in\nthe process was to select a test site. The decision process involved examination of several\nfactors:\n1. The enveloping characteristics of the integrated core stage, which encompasses core\nstage characteristics such as length, diameter, weight, static loads, and dynamic load\ninterface locations, etc.\n2. Loads: The overall loading applied by the integrated core stage to the test facility by\nweight, thrust generated, and thermal interactions\n3. Resource capabilities: Evaluation of the test facilities ability to supply propellants,\npurges, water, and power to the core stage during the hot-fire testing\n4. Personal and group access plus coordinated use by various people from program and\nsupport areas\n5. Environmental impacts related to conducting the core stage test fire\n6. Center Missions\n7. Political impacts\n8. Costs\n9. Schedule availability\n10. Risk\n11. Transportation and ground support requirements\n12. Infrastructure impacts\nVery early in the decision process, the decision team discovered that there were only three\nfacilities in the U.S. that had the potential to meet the needs of the core stage testing program:\nThe Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Test Facility L 1-125 1C located at Edwards AFB (not\nshown), the Saturn V Test Stand located at MSFC, and the B-Complex Test Stands located at\nSSC shown in Figures 2 and 3. The next step taken by the decision team was to determine what\nmodifications would have to be made at each location in order to bring the specific facility\ncapabilities into alignment with the core stage testing program needs. In this arena, each site was\nfacing a different set of obstacles.\n\nMSFC Chief Knowledge Officer\n\n3 of 7\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa92016 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.

Initially, AFRL could not support the SLS\nschedule. But with additional discussion, it was concluded that schedule requirements could be\nsupported. Parties agreed that, following standard AACE (Association for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering, now AACE International) practices for the initial Rough Order of Magnitude\n(ROM) that was prepared to bring the facility up to par with program expectations, an adjustment\nrange of 35 percent to 70 percent uncertainty was within the realm of possibility.\nIt was also felt that the SLS design was in a fairly young stage and reliance on previous\npositions of Constellation and Ares would be beneficial. There were significant transportation\nchallenges to move the core to AFRL for testing. Initial estimates included 5 days of ground\ntransportation from the port to AFRL, but a transportation risk assessment was not completed.\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nAt MSFC, it had been more than a decade since the MSFC propulsion test team had\nperformed a full scale engine test, and several decades since the last full scale stage test, which\nwas the Saturn V first stage, as shown in Figure 1. The MSFC stand was listed as \xe2\x80\x9cmothballed\xe2\x80\x9d\nand needed more than just mechanical modifications. Many years of minimized maintenance and\nupkeep meant that restoration of the facilities to baseline operable conditions was required. In\nfact, at the end of the Ares project, the entire West Test Area at MSFC had been mothballed,\neliminating even preventative maintenance on it. Adding to the cost uncertainty, MSFC staff\nceilings and attrition threatened the Center\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide full-time equivalent (FTE) civil\nservice labor support.\nIn addition, performing the test at MSFC created logistical obstacles as the SLS program had\ncreated a Concept of Operations that required the RS25 engines as individual units to be\nassembled and tested at SSC in Mississippi, near Slidell, Louisiana; and the fabrication,\nassembly, stage-to-engine integration to be performed at Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in\nNew Orleans, Louisiana. The core stage test tests the entire assembly of engines and propellant\ntanks in one test. This would mean that the operational portion of the cost estimate for the SLS\ncore stage hotfire test would have to include the cost to transport the core stage by barge from\nMAF to the MSFC dock located on the Tennessee River.\nAcoustical noise would impact new housing areas and schools closer to MSFC. The program\nanalyzed the acoustical impacts, which indicated that the sound of rocket testing off the test site\nwould affect nearby residents, rattling of windows and possibly other impacts. This would\nincrease the number of damage claims due to population increase and urban encroachment.\n\nMSFC Chief Knowledge Officer\n\n4 of 7\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa92016 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.

Fifteen S-IC static firings were conducted\nfor a duration of about 1875 seconds. Testing at the B-2 for the Delta Common Booster Core\nProgram was completed in FY2001.\nTo meet current program requirements, there were upgrades and repairs expected with the\nBooster Support Frame itself, various platform designated numbered levels (11, 8, and 7)\ncharacterized as both static and dynamic, the Aspirator and Flame Deflector. Test stand changes\nwere anticipated for structural considerations relating to physically handling and maneuvering\nthe core, structural support, and expected thrust. The Rocket Propulsion Test Program Office\nresides at SSC, and SSC is a short distance by barge from Michoud Assembly Facility where the\nSLS Core stage is assembled.\nThe independent cost estimate noted that 6 months of schedule margin for this magnitude of\na project was tough and needed to be managed closely. The cost estimate grew through assessing\nvarious risk scenarios. Despite the unique challenges faced by each center, according to the\nExploration Systems Development (ESD) B-2 Assessment, the cost estimates for performing the\nSLS core stage hotfire test at SSC was based upon a 2-year period of study. This was far longer\nthan the time spent developing the other potential site cost estimates.\nEarly in the evaluation, the estimates were considered approximately the same at both MFSC\nand SSC. Additional project definition and refinement separated the cost estimates by about $100\nmillion, with SSC being higher.\n\nMSFC Chief Knowledge Officer\n\n5 of 7\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa92016 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.

For propulsion purposes, this task fell under the\npurview of the Rocket Propulsion Test Management Board (RPTMB), which managed the\npropulsion testing capabilities for the entire Agency. The RPTMB directed the use of the\navailable facilities. The Agency made a strategic decision that SSC would be the NASA center\nfor technical excellence in hot-fire propulsion testing.\nThe SLS program\xe2\x80\x99s assessment is based on cost, schedule, and risk impacts to the program as\nwell as the maturity of the data provided. Another aspect of the decision assessment considered\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic decisions to align capabilities across the Centers and not duplicate costly\nfacilities. Chart 1 shows the cost comparison for the three options as of April 2012. Since the\ntest stand estimate costs where not known due the immaturity of the design, all the lower factors\nare shown as the same for each program. The uncertainty in the given estimates was very high,\ndue to maturity of the SLS Program producing many unknowns.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAre there other evaluation factors that should be considered?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat factors are most important to you as the Program representative?\nThe Test Lab representative?
