It will be accomplished using traditional control theory and advanced coordination algorithms developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). This capability will be demonstrated in the discrete event control test-bed located at JHU/APL. This project will be modeled for the Leonardo constellation mission, but is intended to be adaptable to any constellation mission. To develop a common software architecture. the controllers will only model very high-level responses. For instance, after determining that a maneuver must be made. the MADECC system will output B (Delta)V (velocity change) value. Lower level systems must then decide which thrusters to fire and for how long to achieve that (Delta)V.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030025332, "endDate": "2003-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "efb0644470d941c48fb547b23151468a", "id": "0d3976df9fef4f9abf5bc7a93fc0a853"}], "name": "2003 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "efb0644470d941c48fb547b23151468a", "startDate": "2003-03-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030025332, "id": "21ae2da13dbb4f90b7dcbf5dc64a2971", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030025332.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030025332/downloads/20030025332.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030025332/downloads/20030025332.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030025332/downloads/20030025332.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
