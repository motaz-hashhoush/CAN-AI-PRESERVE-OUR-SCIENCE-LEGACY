Synthetic Biology or SynBio is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Four NASA field centers, along with experts from industry and academia, have been partnering on the Space Synthetic Biology Project and are working on new breakthroughs in this increasingly useful pursuit, which is part a science discipline and part engineering. Led by researchers at NASA s Ames Research Center, the team is studying how this powerful new tool can help NASA now and in the future. The project was created to harness biology in reliable, robust, engineered systems to support the agency s exploration and science missions, to improve life on Earth and to help shape NASA's future. The program also is intended to contribute foundational tools to the synthetic biology research community.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011371, "endDate": "2013-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2nd Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop Presentation", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "817953450b324d0e9ff315498cc0e245", "startDate": "2013-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011371, "id": "4cdc6c6a09c143ba8eebea77b7d00d94", "publicationDate": "2013-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011371.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011371/downloads/20130011371.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011371/downloads/20130011371.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011371/downloads/20130011371.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
