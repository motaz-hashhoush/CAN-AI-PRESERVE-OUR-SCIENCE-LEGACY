b'Consumer, Home and Recreation\n\nWater Sensors\n\nichael J. Morris, president of pHish\nDoctor, Inc. and Ocean Optics, Inc.,\nDunedin, Florida is an inventor formerly employed by the Southern\nTechnology Application Center (STAC) at\nthe University of South Florida in Tampa.\nSTAC is a NASA-sponsored industry\nassistance center operating a special\nServices for Inventors Network that provides\ntechnical and marketing help for product\ninnovators.\nIn 1986, Morris had an idea for a\nnovel product - a pH monitor for home\naquariums. The pH factor is an indication of the acidity or alkalinity level of a\nsolution. Morris developed immobilized\ndyes that offer a way of measuring the pH\nlevel, a technique somewhat analogous to\nthe familiar litmus test, in which a treated\npaper changes color when exposed to\nacidity or alkalinity.\nMorris, then associate director of\nSTAC, became his own client and asked\nSTAC for assistance in measuring the market\npotential of the invention, which he called\nthe pHish Doctor. STAC conducted the necessary market\nresearch and\nreported that\nthe outlook was\npositive. Morris\nthen formed\npHish Doctor,\nInc. to develop\na product for\nfreshwater\naquariums. He\nsubsequently\nused STAC\'s\nservice for technological guidance, business\n\nplanning, funding opportunities, and manufacturing/distribution information.\nThe pHish Doctor consists of an arcshaped sensor strip and a seashell-shaped\ncolor chart. Mounted in an aquarium with a\nsuction cup (below), the sensor continually\nmeasures pH levels in the water and changes\ncolor as the pH factor changes; by comparing\nthe color of the sensor strip with the color\nchart, the aquarium owner gets an instant pH\nreading. The photo at left shows the different color swatches of a sensor that has been\nexposed to three distinct levels of pH.\nThe reading is important. A changing pH level is an indication of trouble.\nWhen the level gets too high, the ammonia\nthat fish excrete becomes highly toxic; at low\npH, there is a danger that the bacteria that\nnormally break down waste products in water\nwill stop functioning. The continually monitoring pHish Doctor eliminates the need for\nperiodic sample testing.\nA designer-aquarium sales company,\nGM Aquatics, Fort Worth, Texas now handles\nmanufacturing and marketing of the pHish\nDoctor, whose sales have run into the tens of\n\nI\n\n.\n\n-\n\n7\n\nthousands and are still expanding. Morris\nstill supplies the sensor strips himself and\nkeeps secret how they are made.\nThe success of the pHish Doctor\nprompted Mike Morris to shift his focus\ntoward pH detection in seawater. Salt water\naquariums have a different pH range than\nfreshwater tanks, so a different dye was needed. NASA technology provided a clue.\nIn NASA Tech Briefs, a monthly publication that describes new NASA technology\navailable for transfer, Morris read of\nresearch on an immobilized enzyme used in\na colorimeter test for alcohol. A follow-up\ninformation package supplied by NASA led\nhim to try alternative strategies that resulted\nin a salt water version of the pH Doctor and\ndevelopment of several viable immobilization techniques that could be used with dyes.\nThis shift of focus was instrumental\nin the formation of Ocean Optics, Inc. to\npursue technology for sensing pH in seawater. Ocean Optics won Phase I (feasibility\ndetermination) and Phase I1 (application)\nSmall Business Innovation Research grants\nfrom the Department of Energy (DOE)for\ndevelopment of a pH sensor that will operate unattended on sea buoys for long periods and collect continuous data on how\nmuch carbon dioxide the ocean is absorbing\nfrom burning of fossil fuels.\nKnowing the rate of oceanic carbon\ndioxide flux is critical to researchers studying the "greenhouse effect" of carbon dioxide buildup. Satellite ocean color measurements provide basic data; DOEwants the pH\ndata to provide corroborating "sea truth"\ninformation. Ocean Optics is developing a\nfiber optic sensor employing the company\'!\nproprietary process that produces tough,\nthin, transparent coatings of pH indicator\ndyes. Optical transmission provides highly\n\naccurate pH readings, independent of\npathlength, dye concentration and\nsensor-to-sensorvariation\nThere are a number of commercial\napplications for the fiber optic sensor, such\nas pH meters for process control, general\nlaboratory work, or implantable sensors for\nblood gas monitoring.\nAt left, Mike Morris is preparing to\ndeploy a sea buoy for testing in the Gulf of\nMexico. Ocean Optics\' fiberoptic sensor is\nhoused in the small white tube at the bottom\nof the buoy. The sensor itself is shown\nbelow; a laboratory technician is testing it\nwith a color dye.\nThe newest evolution of Ocean\nOptics\' technology is shown in the bottom\nphoto. It is a miniature spectrometer to be\nused in conjunction with the fiber optic sensor. Measured in inches and weighing less\nthan a pound, it is designed for use in many\nsituations inaccessible to a normal spectrometer, typically an instrument weighing\n60-150 pounds.\n\n'
