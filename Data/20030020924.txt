Hillard and D.C. Ferguson\nNASA Glenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio USA\ngrover.b.hillard@grc.nasa.gov\n\nABSTRACT\n\npower systems now being deployed for\nspace applications operate at higher voltages\nin order to reduce power loss and system\nmass. The emergence of such systems is\nmotivated primarily by a desire to save\nweight. Since the resistance of the necessary\ncabling is a strongly decreasing function of\nmass per unit length and cable losses are\nproportional to current squared, it is\ndesirable to m s h power at higher voltages\nand lower currents. A further consideration\nis the reduced effect of magnetic interactions\n(torque and drag) that will follow from low\ncurrent operation.\n\nOver the past decade, Low Earth\nOrbiting (LEO) spacecraft have gradually\nrequired ever-increasing power levels. As a\nrule, this has been accomplished through the\nuse of high voltage systems. Recent failures\nand anomalies on such spacecraft have been\ntraced to various design practices and\nmaterials choices related to the high voltage\nsolar arrays. NASA Glenn has studied these\nanomalies including plasma chamber testing\non arrays similar to those that experienced\ndifficulties on orbit. Many others in the\ncommunity have been involved in a\ncomprehensive effort to understand the\nproblems and to develop practices to avoid\nthem. The NASA Space Environments and\nEffects program, recognizing the timeliness\nof this effort, has commissioned and funded\na design guidelines document intended to\ncapture the current state of understanding.\nWe present here an overview of this\n\nWhile high voltage systems are clearly\ndesirable to the power system designer, they\nsuffer the drawback of interacting with the\nionospheric plasma in several different\nways. First, conducting surfaces whose electrical potential is highly negative with\nrespect to the plasma undergo arcing. Such\narcing not only damages the material but\n\ndocument,\n\nresults in current disruptions, significant\n\nwhich\n\nis\n\nnow\n\nnearing\n\ncompletion.\n\nEMI, and large discontinuous changes in the\narray potential.\nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the difficulties in predicting the\nonset of arcing has been the realization that\nthe threshold potential for arcing depends\ncritically not only on the design of the solar\ncells, but also in the manner cells are laid\ndown and connected. In the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s\ntraditional wisdom focused on the\nobservation that silicon cells using traditional silver-coated interconnects exhibited a\nthreshold potential for arcing of about -230\nvolts relative to the plasma. Yet, since that\ntime, catastrophic failures have occurred on\n\nHistorically, power systems on US\nspace vehicles have operated at the nominal\n28 V dc inherited from the aircraft industry.\nAt such low voltages, plasma interactions in\nLEO are negligible and have not been a\nconsideration in spacecraft design.

The worst\nsituations occur when the spacecraft power\nsystem uses a negative ground. In such a\nconfiguration, large surfaces are negative\nand must collect slow moving ions to\nbdmce the c ~ ~ ef z ~ m\ni t e!eztrm collection\nthat now occurs only Erom relatively small\nareas of positive surface. In the worst case,\nparts of the spacecraft will be biased with\nrespect to the ionosphere to a level very near\nthe maximum voltage used on the solar\narrays.\n\nAn additional effect that plagues\nsurfaces at high negative potential lies in the\nfact that inbound inns, acce!erated by the\nhigh fields, cause sputtering from surfaces\nwith which they impact.\nFor solar arrays or other surfaces that\nare biased positively with respect to the\nplasma, a second effect occurs. Such\nsurfaces collect electrons from the plasma,\nresulting in a parasitic loss to the power\nsystem. Since the mass of an electron is\nmuch less than an ion, the magnitude of\ncurrent density is much greater for surfaces\nwith positive bias. At bias potentials greater\nthan about 200 volts, sheath formation and\nsecondary electron emission fiom the\nsurface causes the entire surrounding\nsurface, normally an insulator, to behave as\nif it were a conductor. This effect, often\nreferred to as "snapover", results in large\ncurrent collection from even a very small\nexposed area.\n\nAs experience has accumulated within\nindustry and government, the need to\ncapture the state of understanding has\nbecome pressing. Recognizing this, the\nSpace Environments and Effects (SEE)\nprogram, managed by the Marshall\nSpaceflight Center, has commissioned and\nfunded a series of s o h a r e design tools and\nguidelines documents to aid the spacecraft\ncommunity. The latest of these efforts is the\ndocument reported here, which focuses of\nhigh voltage interactions in Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO).\n\nBesides producing a power loss,\ncurrents collected by biased surfaces will\nsignificantly affect the potentials at which\ndifferent parts of the spacecraft will "float."\nBecause of their large mass and low\nmobility, ions collected by negatively biased\nsurfaces result in a relatively small plasma\ncurrent density. The lightweight electrons,\non the other hand, are readily collected by\npositively biased surfaces. Ram and wake\neffects further complicate the picture. Ram\nenergy is considerably higher than ambient\nthermal energy so ram flow enhances ion\ncollection relative to surfaces that are\noblique to plasma flow.\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe final document is divided into two\nparts. The first is the design guidelines\n\nproper, which will be briefly outlined below.\nAdditionally, it was felt by the authors as\nwell as by the SEE program that it was\nadvantageous at this time to provide a\ncomprehensive citation of all relevant\npublications. To this end, the NASA CASI\ndatabase was extensively searched and a\ncompilation assembled of over 300 relevant\npublications. These citations, which are\nprovided in the complete CASI format,\nappear in a separate appendix to the report.\nEach citation is given a separate page so that\nheader information appears at the top,\nallowing a quick scan for relevant topics.\nAdditionally, the appendix, like the master\n\nThe spacecraft, reacting to these various\ncurrent sources, must necessarily reach\nequilibrium at whatever potential results in a\n\n2\n\nguidelines document, was assembled with\nMicrosoft Word as its native format.\nConversion to PDF leaves the citations fully\nsearchable.\n\nthat deal with current collection and with\narcing respectively. The part on current\ncollection begins with an overview of the\nbasic physics with particular attention to the\ncurrent balance condition and to sheath\neffects. With this backgrmnd, we Eext\npresent the current state of knowledge\nconcerning current collection by structures\nand the resulting spacecraft charging\nproblem. The next topic treats both ion and\nelectron collection by solar arrays and\nintroduced the engineering challenges posed\nby snapover and by parasitic power drain.\nThe current collection subtopic ends with\nbrief discussions of collection at high\nfrequencies and of wake effects.\n\nThe -guidelines document itself is\ndivided into seven sections, which begin\nwith a brief preface. The remaining six\nsections are summarized below.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction is divided into three\nsubsections. The first introduces the reasons\nfor the current widespread move to high\nvoltage systems, in particular the weight\nsavings to be achieved. A subsection that\ndefines LEO in terms of altitude and latitude\nfollows. While such definitions are\nsomewhat arbitrary, we have made the\ndistinction based of the interactions to be\nexpected. The final subsection introduces\nthe various plasma interactions that are\nrelevant to high voltage systems in LEO.\n\nThe second major subsection, which\ncovers arcing, opens with an overview of the\ncurrent state of knowledge of arcing on solar\narrays. Lower level subsections deal with\ninitiation mechanisms, arcing thresholds,\ntypical waveforms, system responses to an\narc, and damage potential. The arcing\nsection concludes with subtopics on EMI\nand on structure arcing, which introduces\nthe highly destructive continuous arc.\n\nEnvironments\n\nThe environments section introduces\nboth the ambient and induced environments\nthat spacecraft will experience in LEO. The\nambient is further subdivided into the\nneutral atmosphere and the plasma\nenvironment. Basic properties of each are\nsummarized with references to models that\nmay be used to predict environmental\nproperties. The contamination-induced\nenvironment is treated with several\nexamples of the changes made to the natural\nenvironment by a spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s operations or\neven by its mere presence.\n\nMitigation Techniques\n\nPlasma Interactions\n\nThe fifth section, on mitigation\ntechniques, is also divided into current\ncollection and arcing. The emphasis is on\ncontrolling spacecraft potential. Techniques\nfor preventing the problem in the first place\nfocus on grounding schemes that are more\ncompatible with the plasma environment.\nWhen this is not possible, mitigation\ntechniques such as plasma contactors are\ndescribed. The subsection ends with topics\non the encapsulation of solar arrays and on\nthe use of vented enclosures.\n\nThe fourth section, which reviews the\nrelevant plasma interactions, is the longest\nin the work. There are two large subsections\n\nThe arcing subsection opens with a\nsubtopic dealing with on-orbit detection of\narcs. It is followed with an overview of\n\n3\n\nmitigation techniques and lessons learned\nthat are specific to solar arrays.\nModeling\nThe sixth section, on modeling, is\nalmost entirely concerned with current\ncollection and resulting shifts in spacecraft\npotential. A wide range of modeling tools\nare available and are briefly surveyed.\nGuidelines are presented for their selection\nand use and an example is provided. The\nsection ends with a discussion of arcing, a\nstochastic process whose onset is very\ndifficult to predict.\nTesting\nThe final section of the document\nconcerns requirements and guidelines for\ntesting. The discussion covers current\ncollection and arcing and concerns solar\narrays as well as material samples.\nSTATUS\nThe guidelines have been delivered to\nthe SEE program office, which has\nsubmitted them to a number of reviewers.\nFollowing receipt of these comments and\nsuggestions, the work will be revised\n\naccordingly. The document is expected to be\nin final form by the end of calendar year\n2002. Inquiries concerning access and\ndistribution should be submitted to the SEE\nprogram office at the MSFC.\n\n4\n\n'
