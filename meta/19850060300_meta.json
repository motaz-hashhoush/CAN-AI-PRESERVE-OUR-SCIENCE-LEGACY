Attention is given to the major experiments in the field of space-based geodynamics research including early satellite laser ranging (SLR) measurements, the GEOS-3 satellite observations, and the installation of corner cube reflectors on the moon. The contribution of VLBI techniques to terrestriral positioning measurements is also discussed. Prospects for future advances with the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and observations from on board the Space Station are also assessed.", "title": "Satellite geodynamics", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T11:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850060300, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Walter, L.
