The agreement\nwas signed on December 27, 1985 in Beijing, China.\nThe call for proposals from vast population\nstudents, estimated at 150 millions strong,\n1986.

Those regional\nsymposia, actively participated\nby six experts from the States and many\nof their Chinese counterparts,\nproduced a total of 264 regional proposals\nfor further consideration\nin the national symposium\nto be held during the\nChristmas\n\nseason\n\nof 1986, in Beijing,\n\n* Current\n\non assignment\n\nto Microgravity\n\nDivision,\n\nNASA Headquarters,\n\nChina.\n\nThe national\n\nScience\n\nWashington,\n\nproposal\n\nand Applications\n\nD.C. 20546\n\nevaluation committee consisted of seven American and twenty-five\nChinese experts whose specialties covered a broad range of space science\nand technology disciplines.\nThe criteria that they had applied uniformly throughout the entire\nselection process were based on the proposal creativity, scientific merits,\nexperiment feasibility and organization. The committee certainly went\nthrough quite a difficult time in deciding what to accept or decline.\nNevertheless, twenty proposals were selected as the national finalists\xe2\x80\xa2\nThose proposals, as well as those not chosen, were generally of\nsurprisingly good quality considering the severe handicap that the Chinese\nstudents must cope in search for information needed for the research\ntopic\xe2\x80\xa2 The titles for those twenty proposals are:\nControl of debris in the cabin of space shuttle, by Wang Nian-qing\n2.

In\naddition, the particulates rely on the residual gravity to initiate the\nmovement. The mathmatical modelling of the experiment could be related\nto the pseudo-random walk problem. It is highly probable that the residual\nmagnitude of the gravitational field on the shuttle can be backed out from\nthe statistical measurement of those particulate movements.\nExperiment 2: "The solidification\nspace"\n\nof two immiscible\n\nliquids\n\nin\n\nby Tian Chun-Liang\n\nTwo immiscible\nlow melt-point materials (Wood\'s metal and paraffin)\nwill be premixed in various ratios and manners in the solid form on earth\nand remelted\nparaffin\n\nin space,\n\nand Wood\'s\n\ncrystalline\nresidual\n\nmetal be phase separated\n\nstructures,\ngravitational\n\nuniformly\n\nmixed\n\nor droplets\n\nExperiment\n\nExperiment\n\nand assume\n\nDepending\n\namorphous\n\non the magnitude\n\nthe two phases\n\nthat\nand\n\nof the\n\nmay be\n\nmay coalesce\n\nto form\n\ndue to the nature tendency\n\nfor a physical\n\nsystem\n\nfree energy.\n\nThe samples\n\nto\n\nare to be post-flight\n\nApparatus\n\nSize and weight\n\n3.2\n\nIt is predicted\n\nof the same species\n\nits total internal\n\n3.0 Experimental\n3.1\n\nrespectively.\n\nfield in the shuttle,\n\nlarge conglomerates\nminimize\nanalyzed.\n\nthen left to cool and resolidify.\n\nof the payload:\n\n2.5 cubic feet, 60 pounds.\n\ndescription:\n\n1: In this experiment\n\n25 small lumps of different\n\nmaterials\n\nto\n\nbe used as "space debris" or "particulates"\nwill be stored in a container.\nside wall will be coated with adhesive cloth.
