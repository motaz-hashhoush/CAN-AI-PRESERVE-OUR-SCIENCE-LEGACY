Expected future increases in air traffic will put additional pressures on the National Airspace System (NAS) and will further compound the high costs associated with airport delays. To address this problem, NASA has embarked on a program to address Terminal Area Productivity (TAP). The goals of the TAP program are to provide increased efficiencies in air traffic during the approach, landing, and surface operations in low-visibility conditions. The ultimate goal is to achieve efficiencies of terminal area flight operations commensurate with Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) at current or improved levels of safety.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960054022, "id": "b32fbd517d3a4b96bb24b980c9c49693", "publicationDate": "1996-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960054022.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960054022/downloads/19960054022.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960054022/downloads/19960054022.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960054022/downloads/19960054022.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
