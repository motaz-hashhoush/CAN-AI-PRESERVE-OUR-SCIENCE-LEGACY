This paper questioned the sustainability indicator in Moroccan cities using a novel methodology based on Earth observations and census data. We estimated the indicator for the 25 largest urban areas between 2003 and 2013.  A stratification based on urbanization fractions allowed for the definition and comparison of hierarchically ordered zones consistent across urban areas and scales. We found no systematic pattern of growth between cities.  However, three categories of development were identified:  a group of large cities with an indicator less than unity and land consumption commensurate to population growth, a group of medium-sized cities trending moderately towards unsustainability with an indicator between one and two, and a group including small cities with significant departure from sustainability. The disparate  sustainability levels between urban areas appear to be related to the rapid economic growth, typical of an emerging economy. Our results indicate a continuous population growth pushing outwards the perimeters of existing urban areas. Unless regulated, land consumption is increasing faster than the population in most parts of Morocco, in line with global trends.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205010335, "name": "", "location": "", "id": "6c0e6240346f480e887e1faf36926c3b"}], "publications": [{"volume": "4", "submissionId": 20205010335, "issue": "2", "publisher": "MDPI", "eissn": "2413-8851", "id": "4cc9e285d9864e89824caa8fd767f7ea", "publicationName": "Urban Science", "publicationDate": "2020-04-14T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "2020-04-14T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "doi": "10.3390/urbansci4020018"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Bounoua_et_al_2020-urban_science Final.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205010335/downloads/Bounoua_et_al_2020-urban_science%20Final.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205010335/downloads/Bounoua_et_al_2020-urban_science%20Final.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205010335/downloads/Bounoua_et_al_2020-urban_science%20Final.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
