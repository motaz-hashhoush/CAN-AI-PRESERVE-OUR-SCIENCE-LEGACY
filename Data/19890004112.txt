The primary structure\nis an erectable truss beam, 110 meters long, with a five-meter-square\ncross section.\nThe current\nbaseline proposal for on-orbit construction\nmakes use of a Mobile Transporter\n(MT) attached to the top\nof an Assembly\nWork Platform (AWP) and two astronauts\nin extravehicular\nactivity (EVA) as\ndiscussed\nin reference\n1. The construction\nmethod uses the EVA astronauts\nto assemble\nthe station\nfrom Astronaut\nPositioning\nDevices (APD\'s) on the AWP. The AWP, which is a partially deployable,\npartially erectable truss structure approaching\n10 meters in length, remains attached directly to the\nOrbiter sills for all construction\nactivities associated\nwith the first two SSF buildup flights.\nThe\nconstruction\ntasks include integrated\ninstallation\nof SSF system components\nas well as assembly\nof the\nprimary truss structure.\nCurrently,\nhalf of the truss beam with associated\nessential\nsubsystems\nis to be\ncompleted\nduring Flight 1 and the other half during Flight 2. However,\nthis scenario is undergoing\nclose scrutiny due to the complexity\nof the tasks involved and manifesting\nconsiderations.\nThe NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) has an ongoing in-house research program to study a\nmobile transporter\nconcept that could be used not only, as generally\naccepted, for maintenance,\nrepair,\nand growth activities after SSF is operational,\nbut also for construction\nduring the first two SSF build\nup flights. This alternate construction\nscenario eliminates\nthe AWP and the structural complexity\nand\nrisk of moving the SSF truss system after each bay is completed.\nInstead, the SSF truss would be\nattached to the Orbiter sills through a transition truss, and the MT equipped\nwith APD\'s (as originally\nconceived\nin references\n2 and 3), would "walk" along the completed\ntruss segment carrying the\nastronauts\nand building material as additional\nstructure is being assembled.\nAlthough\nuse of the MT in\nthis manner requires the EVA crew and MT to move away from the cargo bay during the first two\nStation buildup flights, this is a requirement\nthat is accepted for later flights.\nThis paper presents the results of a ground test program designed to study EVA assembly\nof near full\nscale SSF u\'uss structure with integration\nof utility trays using the NASA LaRC alternate construction\nscenario.\nTest hardware,\nassembly\nprocedures,\nand assembly\ntimes are presented\nfor 1-g and neutral\nbuoyancy\n\ntests.\nMOBILE\n\nTRANSPORTER\n\nASSEMBLY\n\nSCENARIO\n\nFOR SPACE\n\nSTATION\n\nA schematic of the Mobile Transporter\n(MT) as envisioned\nfor the assembly of Space Station is shown\nin Figure 2. The MT would be folded in the Shuttle cargo bay and remotely\ndeployed to an upright\nposition when orbit is achieved.\nThe Space Station truss consists of a series of segments\ncalled bays.\nEach bay is a five meter cube, and all bays are identical.\nGuide pins, attached to the truss nodal joints,\nform the interface between the MT guide mils and the truss structure.\nThe truss is assembled\none bay\nat a time above the MT platform by two EVA astronauts.\nThe astronauts\nare secured in foot restraints\nattached to APD\'s.\nThe APD\'s are not complex robotic arms, but relatively\nsimple devices used to\nmove the astronauts\nto various positions on their respective\nsides of the MT so that the required\nconstruction\ntasks can be accomplished.\nAfter the crew has assembled\na bay, the MT drawbar extends\n(as shown in Fig. 2) pushing the MT one bay-length\naway from the completed\nstructure along the truss\nlongitudinal\naxis. The next contiguous\nbay is then assembled,\nafter which the drawbar is retracted to\ngrasp new nodal joint guide pins and extended\nto move the transporter\ninto position for assembly\nof\n\nthe next bay. In this way the MT steps along the truss as the truss is being assembled.\nThe platforn_ is\nused to transport Space Station operational\nequipment\nwhich requires integrated installation\nduring the\nprimary truss assembly.\nA Shuttle type remote manipulator\nam1 attached to the MT is cnvisioncd\nto\nsupport these tasks.\nSCENARIO\n\nFOR INTEGRATED\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nOF UTILITY\n\nTRAYS\n\nA major concern associated\nwith SSF construction\nis installation\nof the utility system that is vital to the\nSSF operation.\nIt is generally\naccepted that the electrical and fluid utility lines will be housed in\nprotective\ntrays that are attached to the inside of the primary truss structure.\nAlthough\nelectrical and\nfluid line connections\nare beyond the scope of this investigation,\na scenario for integrated\ninstallation\nof\nthe utility trays during truss assembly\nwas addressed.\nThis scenario permits folded bay-length\npackages of tray segments to automatically\ndeploy to their proper positions prior to assembly of the\nsupporting\nbay of the truss. The deployed\ntray segments can then be attached directly to the truss\nnodes during truss assembly.\nThis procedure,\nby minimizing\nastronaut handling,\nis designed\nto have a\nminimal impact on truss assembly.\nA series of sketches representing\nthe general procedure\nis shown in Figure 3. Sketch 1 represents\na\ncross section of the Shuttle cargo bay with the MT deployed and ready for assembly\nto begin.\nTemporary\nutility tray supports are shown deployed on either side of the cargo bay. The utility trays\nare fan-folded\ninto 5 m long packages.\nCritically damped springs are used at the hinge lines. The\nShuttle Remote Manipulator\nSystem is used to unstow the packages and attach them to the supports\nbefore truss assembly\nis begun (sketch 2). The EVA astronauts\nrelease latches that allow the packages\nto unfold two bay lengths (sketches\n3 and 4). The EVA crew then assembles\nthe first bay of truss and\nattaches the utility trays (sketch 5). The MT then translates one bay-length,\nafter which the EVA crew\nunlatches the utility tray package (allowing\nit to unfold another bay length) and assembles\nthe next\ntruss bay. The procedure\nis repeated\nuntil the desired truss configuration\nis achieved.\nTEST\nMock-up\n\nHARDWARE\n\nand Operation\n\nof Mobile\n\nTransporter\n\nFigure 4 is a schematic\nof the MT mock-up used in the Space Station truss EVA construction\nsimulations\nconducted\nin 1-g at LaRC and in neutral buoyancy at the Marshall Space Flight Center\'s\nNeutral Buoyancy\nSimulator (NBS).\nThe MT mock-up was supported\non a tower and remained\nstationary\nduring the tests. The truss structure was assembled\none bay at a time under the transporter.\nWhen a bay was completed,\nit was moved out of the work area by the drawbar thus producing\nthe\nrelative motion between the truss and MT to simulate the MT "walking"\nalong the completed\ntruss\nstructure.\nA remote manipulator\narm was not required nor used for these tests. As indicated in the\ninset, the preferred position for the EVA astronauts\nis with their heads pointing away from the MT.\nThis orientation\nprovides\nthe best visibility and least obstructed\nwork area. However,\nfor comfort and\nsafety reasons, the test subjects were positioned\nwith their heads pointing toward the MT during the 1g and neutral buoyancy\ntests. To accomplish\nthis, the lower segment of each astronaut positioning\ndevice (APD) was slaved to the motion of the rotating upper segment to remain vertical at all times.\nFor the flight article the lower segment is envisioned\nto be independently\nrotated about and elbow joint.\nThe APD\'s could also be moved one bay-length\nforward or aft as indicated by the arrows in the\nsketch. The two rectangular\ncanisters shown attached to the top of the MT are for stowage of truss\nstruts and nodes.\nStrut and Node\nAll struts and nodes were stowed in two\nFigure 5. Although\nthe size of the NBS\nonly three bays, the canisters\nwere sized\ntruss (approximately\nhalf the size of the\n\nStowage\n\nstowage canisters.\nThe stowage arrangement\ntest facility limited the size of truss that could\nto hold enough struts and nodes for assembly\nSpace Station Revised Baseline Configuration)\n2\n\nis shown in\nbe assembled\nto\nof I0 bays of\nplus several\n\nsparecomponents. he strutsweresupported eachendin the canisters cupswith internalspringT\nat\nby\nloadedpistons.

In this waythe trussneutralbuoyancywasmaintained.\nUtility Trays\nThe integrated\nutility trayinstallations\nweredoneonly in neutralbuoyancytests.As\n\nshown in Figure\n11, two neutrally buoyed tray systems were provided,\none for each side of the three-bay\ntruss. An\nindividual\ntray was nominally\na 3 X 15 X 0.5-foot aluminum\nbox with a dry weight of approximately\n150 lb. Three trays were linked together with simple hinges to form the utility tray system for one side\nof the truss. Four tubular members were attached to an edge of the unfolded tray system at intervals\ncorresponding\nto truss node locations.\nThese tubular members,\nwhich had end fittings identical to the\nstrut end fittings, were used to attach the trays to the truss nodes during assembly.\nFigure 12 is a schematic\nshowing the method used to install the trays during assembly\nof the truss.\nThe view is looking downward\non the mobile transporter\n(represented\nby the dashed lines). Since the\nMT support tower (also represented\nby dashed lines) would interfere with the initial, inward,\nunfolding\nof the utility tray packages,\nthe packages were predeployed\none bay-length.\nThe two\npartially unfolded\ntray packages were then supported\nin place on the support tower. (This method\nsimulated\nthe temporary\nsupport system shown in Figure 13, envisioned\nfor the Shuttle cargo bay, that\nholds the packages\nin place during assembly\nof the transition truss and first bay of SSF truss). The\nneutral buoyancy tests began with assembly of the initial truss bay and attachment\nof the first tray to\ntwo of the nodes. The pins used to secure the second and third trays in the folded configuration\nwere\nthen pulled and the trays unfolded with the aid of scuba divers (simulating\nsprings) as the drawbar was\nextended\nto move the completed\nbay out of the work area.\nTEST PROGRAM\nAssembly\ntests were conducted\nboth in 1-g and in neutral buoyancy.\nThe 1-g tests were performed\nwith the test subjects in street clothes.\nThe neutral buoyancy tests were performed\nwith the test\nsubjects in scuba, and also with the test subjects in pressure suits (Extravehicular\nMobility Units\n(EMU\'s)).\nThese tests were conducted\nin an attempt to isolate the effects of water drag and pressure\n\nsuitencumbrance n assembly\no\ntimes.Dueto theeffectsof gravitythe assembly\nprocedures eveloped\nd\nfor the 1-gtestswerenecessarily\nsomewhat\ndifferentfrom thoseusedfor the0-g tests. However,the\n1-gassembly\nprocedure,houghnot asefficient astheneutralbuoyancyprocedure, asduplicated\nt\nw\nin\nsomeof the .scuba neutral buoyancy tests for comparison of assembly times. The size of the NBS test\nfacility (75 feet in diameter and 40 feet deep) limited the size of truss that could be continuously\nassembled\nto only three bays. Complete\nor partial disassembly\nwas accomplished\nby scuba divers\nbetween assemblies\nduring a given test.\nThe assembly procedures\nused for the pressure suited neutral buoyancy\ntests were also duplicated\nin\nscuba tests. The difference\nin assembly times were assumed to be attributable\nto pressure suit\nencumbrance.\nThe following\nthree scenarios were used for the pressure suited assembly\ntests: (1)\nconsecutive\nthree-bay truss assemblies\nwithout integrated installation\nof utility trays (with associated\nscuba disassemblies\nof approximately\n17 minute average durations),\n(2) consecutive\nthree-bay truss\nassemblies\nwith integrated\ninstallation\nof utility trays (with associated\nscuba disassemblies\nof\napproximately\n26 minute average durations),\nand (3) an initial three-bay truss assembly\nwith integrated\nutility trays followed by consecutive\ntwo-bay assemblies\n(with associated\nscuba disassemblies\nof two\nbays of approximately\n10 minute average durations).\nDuring the scuba disassemblies,\nthe test subjects\nwere idle. The duration of a test was limited to approximately\ntwo hours by NBS safety rules which\npermitted\nonly one decompression\nstop for the test subjects when being brought to the surface.\nThe\ntest scenarios were developed\nin order to build as much truss structure\nas possible in the limited time\navailable\nfor a given test. Tethering\nof the hardware\nwas not addressed\nin these tests.\nl-g Tests\nFigure 14 shows a 1-g test in progress.\nFigure 14(a) shows the first bay being assembled.\nThe truss\nsupport frame, shown at the lower right; was used in the 1-g tests to carry the weight of the truss after\nassembly.\nFigure 14(b) shows the entire three-bay\ntruss. To facilitate handling\nby the test subjects,it\nwas necessary\nto develop unique assembly procedures\nfor the 1-g tests because of gravity effects.\nThe\nshort bracket shown attached to the tower in Figure 14(a) was used as a prop to help support the upper\ntruss struts as they were being passed from the test subject on the far side of the truss to the test subject\non the near side. When a lower truss member was being passed across the truss, an engineer on the\nfloor assisted by manually\nsupporting\nthe free end of the strut.\nNumerous\ntruss assemblies\nwere performed\nNASA astronauts\nin order to check out the\nsubjects and console operators.\nFollowing\nwhich well trained engineers\nwere used as\nthree-bay truss was assembled\nfor each of\n\nin 1-g by a number of different subjects including\ntwo\nhardware, develop efficient procedures,and\ntrain test\nthese preliminary\ntests, four timed tests were performed\nin\ntest subjects and expert console operators,\nexclusively.\nA\nthese tests.\n\nNeutral\n\nBuoyancy\n\nTests\n\nFigure 15 is a schematic\nshowing the assembly\nsequence used for the neutral buoyancy\ntests. After the\nfirst batten frame is assembled,\nall remaining\nbays are assembled\nidentically\nfollowing\na very simple\nand easily memorized\nroutine.\nTest subject 1 always moves in a counterclockwise\ndirection,\nwhile the\ntest subject 2 always moves in a clockwise\ndirection.\nStruts and nodes are removed\nfrom the stowage\ncanister and temporarily\nstowed on the APD foot restraint handrails when the test subjects pass the\ncanisters\nso that no long distance translations\nare required for material resupply.\nFigure 16, 17, and 18 show neutral buoyancy\ntests in progress.\nFigure 16 shows a scuba assembly,\nand Figures. 17 and 18 show pressure suit assemblies\nboth with and without integrated\ninstallation\nof\nutility trays. As with the 1-g tests, numerous\nassemblies\nfor hardware\ncheckout,\nprocedural\ndevelopment,\nand personnel\nfamiliarity\nwere performed\nin scuba. Several additional\npressure suit tests\nwere also performed\nto verify the test setup. Two different pairs of test subjects were used in these\ntests as well as two pairs of console operators.\nEight timed assembly\ntests were performed\nduring\nwhich a total of 49 bays of truss were assembled\nby a single pair each of trained, engineer\ntest subjects\n\nandexpertconsoleoperators,\n\nrespectively.\nIn the last five of these tests 34 bays of truss were\nassembled\nwith integrated installation\nof utility trays. Two additional\ntests were performed\nby a pair of\nNASA astronauts\nto provide them with some hands-on experience\nwith the assembly procedures\nand\nhardware,\nand to solicit their comments\nfor consideration.\nTEST\nPressure\n\nSuited\n\nRESUI_TS\nNeutral\n\nBuoyancy\n\nTests\n\nThe assembly\ntimes using trained engineers\nas test subjects for the first batten frame and succeeding\ngeneral bays of the truss are presented\nin Figure 19 as a function of build number.\nThe build number\napplies to a three-bay\nassembly,\nwith the exception\nof builds 16 and 17 which were two-bay\nassemblies\nperformed\nduring Test 8. As can be seen, the assembly\ntimes generally\ndecreased\nas the\ntest subjects and the console operators\nbecame more experienced.\nThe few spikes in the data reflect\nminor difficulties\nencountered\nwhile making some of the strut-to-node\nconnections\n(attributed\nto strut\ncrookedness).\nHowever,\nall connections\nwere accomplished\nby the test subjects without scuba diver\nassistance.\nIt is interesting\nto note that as the test subjects became more experienced,\nand developed\ntheir techniques,\nthe assembly\ntimes which included integrated installation\nof utility trays became faster\nthan the assembly\ntimes without utility trays. These assembly times are considerably\nfaster than the\n13.5-14 minutes per bay (with no utility trays) reported in reference\n6 for neutral buoyancy\nassembly\ntests of competing\nSpace Station truss concepts.\nThe tests reported in reference\n6, however,\nused\nseveral different AWP hardware configurations,\nas well as different assembly\nprocedures\nthan those\nused in the tests reported\nherein. The fidelity of the test fixtures used in the ref. 6 tests and the\nassembly\nprocedures\nwere compromised\nsignificantly\nby the small size of the Weightless\nEnvironment\nTraining Facility (WETF) in which they were performed,\nand by the use of many pairs of astronaut\ntest subjects performing\nonly one or two tests each, so that they could not become thoroughly\ntrained\nor highly experienced\nwith the various AWP hardware\ndesigns and assembly concepts.\nSuch "quicklook" tests should not be considered\nverifications\nof a concept.\nThe assembly\ntimes by a pair of astronaut test subjects for the first batten frame and succeeding\ngeneral\nbays of the truss in the present tests are presented\nin Figure 20 as a function of build number.\nOne of\nthese astronauts\nhad no previous experience\nwith the Mobile Transporter\nor the truss hardware,\nand\nrelatively few hours of neutral buoyancy\nexperience\nin the pressure suit. The other astronaut had\nperformed\nseveral 1-g assemblies\nwith the MT using the same truss hardware,\nbut different assembly\nprocedures.\nHowever,\nthis astronaut\nhad many hours of neutral buoyancy\npressure suit experience\nplus approximately\n12 hours of actual on-orbit EVA structural assembly experience\nwith the ACCESS\nShuttle flight experiment\n(ref. 5). A comparison\nof Figs. 19 and 20 shows that the astronaut assembly\ntimes were somewhat\ngreater than those from the first few tests of the experienced\ntest subjects, and\nsignificantly\ngreater than the times realized in the latter builds. Except for the two spikes that are\nindicative\nof additional\ntime taken to install crooked struts, the astronaut times also show a generally\ndownward\ntrend as experience\nis gained.\nThese results demonstrate\nthe importance\nof using only well\ntrained test subjects to verify assembly\ntimes and evaluate hardware or concepts.\nComparison\n\nof l-g, Scuba,\n\nand Pressure\n\nSuit Three-bay\n\nAssemblies\n\nIn order to provide data that may be useful for more accurate estimations\nof on-orbit assembly\ntimes from data obtained in 1-g and neutral buoyancy\nassembly tests, an attempt was made to\nisolate the effects of water drag and pressure suit encumbrance.\nFigure 21 shows a comparison\nof\nthree-bay truss assemblies\nperformed\nin 1-g with the test subjects in street clothes, and in neutral\nbuoyancy\nwith the test subjects in either scuba or pressure suits. All of these results were obtained\nwith the same pair of trained, engineer test subjects and the same pair of trained console operators.\nThe neutral buoyancy\ntests included integrated installation\nof utility trays, whereas utility tray\ninstallation\nwas not possible with the 1-g test setup. The average assembly\ntime for the three-bay\ntruss without utility trays was approximately\n14.82 minutes in 1-g and 15.73 minutes in scuba.\nBecause these assembly\ntimes are so close and the effects of gravity were significant\ndeviations\n6\n\nfrom thescubatests,it is unlikelythatanyrealisticconclusions\nonthe effectsof waterdragcanbe\ndrawn.\nHowever,the resultsfromthe scubaandpressure neutralbuoyancytestscanbeusedto estimate\nsuit\ntheeffectsof pressure encumbranceecause\nsuit\nb\nthesetestswereessentially\nidenticalexceptfor the test\nsubjects\' ttire. Theaverage\na\nassembly\ntime for a three-bay\ntrusswasapproximately\nfour minutes\nlongerin pressure\nsuitsthanin scuba.Theseresultssuggesthat,with theparticularassembly\nt\nconcept\nstudied,a five to six seconds\nperstrutpenaltyin assembly\ntimeis directly attributable thecurrent\nto\npressure (Extravehicular obility Unit (EMU)) design,andprimarily theglovedesign.
