Galus\nABSTRACT\n\nEmbodiments of the invention permit flight paths (currentand\nplanned) to be viewed from various orientations to provide\nimproved path and terrain awareness via graphical two-dimensional or three-dimensional perspective display formats.\nBy coupling the flight path information with a terrain database, uncompromising terrain awareness relative to the path\nand ownship is provided. In addition, missed approaches,\npath deviations, and any navigational path can be reviewed\nand rehearsed before performing the actual task. By rehearsing a particular mission, check list items can be reviewed,\nterrain awareness can be highlighted, and missed approach\nprocedures can be discussed by the flight crew. Further, the\nuse of Controller Pilot Datalink Communications enables\ndata-linked path, flight plan changes, and Air Traffic Control\nrequests to be integrated into the flight display of the present\ninvention.\n30 Claims, 3 Drawing Sheets\n\n12\nProcessing Element\n\n14\nInterface\t\n\ndisplay\nAircraft state/\nnav/mode data\n\nATC\nclearance\n\nReal-time Traffic\ninformation\n(e.g., ADS-B)\nAlerts(\nAnnunciations\n\n18\nMemory Element\n\nDaniel Previl\nAndrea Z.
