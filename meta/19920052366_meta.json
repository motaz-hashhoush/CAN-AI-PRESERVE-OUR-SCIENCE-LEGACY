This observation is based on a semi-empirical analysis of the data collected from sets of Landsat/TM (Thematic Mapper) imagery as the top of the atmosphere images have been converted into maps of surface radiation budget. A preliminary analysis shows that in spite of the land surface's temporal and spatial variability, the transfer of latent and sensible heat into the atmosphere would appear to be governed by the land surface albedo.", "title": "Surface radiation budget imagery", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T15:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920052366, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kim, Hongsuk H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "3f962e22529d466cb284a21a0fd7b37a"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "Finland", "submissionId": 19920052366, "endDate": "1991-06-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IGARSS ''91:  Annual International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "location": "Espoo", "id": "ae246f4837354682a1bf12d3a9af07b2", "startDate": "1991-06-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19920052366, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920052366, "id": "933defdcd05c47eb81743a6b3e4cd839", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
