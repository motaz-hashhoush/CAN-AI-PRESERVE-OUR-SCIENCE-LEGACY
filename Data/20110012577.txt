The angular distribution\ngives the direction of the total velocity\nof the air entering the spectrometer,\nand the energy distribution gives the\nmagnitude of the total velocity. The\nwind velocity vector is uniquely determined since the measured total velocity depends on the wind vector and the\norbiting velocity vector.\nThe orbiting spectrometer moves supersonically, Mach 8 or greater, through\nthe air and must point within a few de-\n\ngrees of its orbital velocity vector (the\nram direction). Pointing knowledge is\ncritical; for example, pointing errors\n0.1\xc2\xb0 lead to errors of about 10 m/s in the\nwind. The WATS method may also be applied without modification to measure\nthe ion-drift vector, ion temperature,\nand relative ion densities of major ionic\nspecies in the ionosphere. In such an application it may be called IDTS: Ion-Drift\nTemperature Spectrometry.\nA spectrometer-based coordinate system with one axis instantaneously pointing along the ram direction makes it\npossible to transform the Maxwellian velocity distribution of the air molecules to\na Maxwellian energy-angle distribution\nfor the molecular flux entering the spectrometer. This implementation of WATS\nis called the gas kinetic method (GKM)\nbecause it is applied to the case of the\nMaxwellian distribution.\n\nThe WATS method follows from the\nrecognition that in a supersonic platform moving at 8,000 m/s, the measurement of small wind velocities in the air\non the order of a few 100 m/s and less\nrequires precise knowledge of the angle\nof incidence of the neutral atoms and\nmolecules. The same is true for the case\nof ion-drift measurements. WATS also\nprovides a general approach that can obtain non-equilibrium distributions as\nmay exist in the upper regions of the\nthermosphere, above 500 km and into\nthe exosphere. Finally, WATS serves as a\nmass spectrometer, with very low mass\nresolution of roughly 1 part in 3, but easily separating atomic oxygen from molecular nitrogen.\nThis work was done by Federico Herrero of\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nHealth Manager can detect \xe2\x80\x9cBad\nHealth\xe2\x80\x9d prior to a failure occurring by\nperiodically monitoring the application\nsoftware by looking for code corruption\nerrors, and sanity-checking each critical\ndata value prior to use. A processor\xe2\x80\x99s\nmemory can fail and corrupt the software, or the software can accidentally\nwrite to the wrong address and overwrite\nthe executing software. This innovation\nwill continuously calculate a checksum\nof the software load to detect corrupted\ncode. This will allow a system to detect a\nfailure before it happens.\nThis innovation monitors each software task (thread) so that if any task reports \xe2\x80\x9cbad health,\xe2\x80\x9d or does not report to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nthe Health Manager, the system is declared bad. The Health Manager reports\noverall system health to the outside\nworld by outputting a square wave signal. If the square wave stops, this indicates that system health is bad or hung\nand cannot report. Either way, \xe2\x80\x9cbad\nhealth\xe2\x80\x9d can be detected, whether caused\nby an error, corrupted data, or a hung\nprocessor.\nA separate Health Monitor Task is\nstarted and run periodically in a loop\nthat starts and stops pending on a semaphore. Each monitored task registers\nwith the Health Manager, which maintains a count for the task. The registering task must indicate if it will run more\n\nor less often than the Health Manager. If\nthe task runs more often than the\nHealth Manager, the monitored task\ncalls a health function that increments\nthe count and verifies it did not go over\nmax-count. When the periodic Health\nManager runs, it verifies that the count\ndid not go over the max-count and zeroes it. If the task runs less often than\nthe Health Manager, the periodic\nHealth Manager will increment the\ncount. The monitored task zeroes the\ncount, and both the Health Manager\nand monitored task verify that the count\ndid not go over the max-count.\nThe Health Manager reports its system\nhealth status to the outside world by tog-\n\n5\n\ngling an output pin creating a square\nwave signal. If the system hangs completely prior to reporting its health status,\nthe square wave is no longer generated.\nThis absence of the square wave, whether\nintentional or because the Health Manager is hung, indicates bad health, analogous to a deadman switch. This is done by\n\ncreating a Health Manager Reporting\nTask, which loops and pends on a semaphore. A timer Interrupt Service Routine\ngives the semaphore that allows the\nHealth Manager to run. When the Health\nManager Reporting Task receives the\nsemaphore, it reads the system health status. If the status is good, an output pin is\n\ntoggled. If the status is bad health, it\nlatches the system\xe2\x80\x99s bad health variable so\nit can never switch back to good health\nand stops the square wave.\nThis work was done by Roger Zoerner of\nKennedy Space Center.

KSC12809\n\nStereo Imaging Miniature Endoscope\nThis endoscope can be used in minimally invasive surgery, in geological resource exploration,\nand in miniature analytical tools.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nStereo imaging requires two different\nperspectives of the same object and, traditionally, a pair of side-by-side cameras\nwould be used but are not feasible for\nsomething as tiny as a less than 4-mm-diameter endoscope that could be used for\nminimally invasive surgeries or geoexploration through tiny fissures or bores. The\nproposed solution here is to employ a\nsingle lens, and a pair of conjugated,\nmultiple-bandpass filters (CMBFs) to\nseparate stereo images. When a CMBF is\nplaced in front of each of the stereo\nchannels, only one wavelength of the visible spectrum that falls within the passbands of the CMBF is transmitted\nthrough at a time when illuminated. Because the passbands are conjugated, only\none of the two channels will see a particular wavelength. These time-multiplexed\nimages are then mixed and reconstructed to display as stereo images.\nThe basic principle of stereo imaging\ninvolves an object that is illuminated at\nspecific wavelengths, and a range of illumination wavelengths is time multiplexed. The light reflected from the object selectively passes through one of the\ntwo CMBFs integrated with two pupils\nseparated by a baseline distance, and is\nfocused onto the imaging plane through\nan objective lens. The passband range of\nCMBFs and the illumination wavelengths are synchronized such that each\nof the CMBFs allows transmission of only\nthe alternate illumination wavelength\nbands. And the transmission bandwidths\nof CMBFs are complementary to each\nother, so that when one transmits, the\nother one blocks.\nThis can be clearly understood if the\nwavelength bands are divided broadly\ninto red, green, and blue, then the illumination wavelengths contain two bands\nin red (R1, R2), two bands in green (G1,\nG2), and two bands in blue (B1, B2).\n\n6\n\nTherefore, when the objective is illuminated by R1, the reflected light enters\nthrough only the left-CMBF as the R1\nband corresponds to the transmission\nwindow of the left CMBF at the left\npupil. This is blocked by the right CMBF.\n\nThe transmitted band is focused on the\nfocal plane array (FPA). Here, the FPA\ndoes not include color filter array (black\nand white); hence, the image sensors\nonly measure light intensities. Similarly,\nwhen the object is illuminated by R2, it is\n\nFiltered Illumination\nCMBFs\n\n(a)\n\nObject\n\nFocal Plane Array\nLens System\nSplit Pupils\n\nFiltered Illumination\nCMBFs\n(b)\n\nObject\n\nFocal Plane Array\nLens System\nSplit Pupils\n\nSchematic showing the principle of the Stereo Imaging Endoscope using CMBFs. (a) The first illumination band passes through the left CMBF to cast an image at the focal plane, but is blocked by the right\nCMBF. (b) The second illumination band passes through the right CMBF to cast an image at the focal\nplane, but is blocked by the left CMBF.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\ntransmitted only through the rightCMBF and is blocked by the left-CMBF.\nThis continues over other wavelength\nbands as well.\nSo, it can be seen that the image sensors at the focal plane are measuring\nlight intensities of alternately transmitted light from the two CMBFs. At the\nend of one complete illumination cycle,\nsix images will have been collected.\nThen the images from R1, G1, and B1\nbecome the primary colors for the left\nside of the stereo image, and R2, G2,\nand B2 become that of the right side of\n\nthe stereo image. Two stereo images\nhave been time-multiplexed on the same\nimaging chip. This intensity data is\nstored as an array from which the 3D\nstereoscopic color image is constructed\nby applying processing and reconstruction algorithms.\nThis work was done by Youngsam Bae,\nHarish Manohara, Victor E. White, and\nKirill V. Shcheglov of Caltech and Hrayr\nShahinian of Skull Base Institute for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A real-time electronics measurement technique was developed to detect catastrophic oscillations\nat early stages for hybrid DC/DC converters. It is capable of identifying lowlevel oscillation and determining the degree of the oscillation at a unique\nfrequency for every individual model of\nthe converters without disturbing their\nnormal operations. This technique is\nspecially developed for space-used hybrid DC/DC converters, but it is also\nsuitable for most of commercial and military switching-mode power supplies.\nThis is a weak-electronic-signal detection technique to detect hybrid DC/DC\nconverter oscillation presented as a specific noise signal at power input pins. It is\nbased on principles of feedback control\nloop oscillation and RF signal modula-\n\ntions, and is realized by using signal\npower spectral analysis. On the power\nspectrum, a channel power amplitude at\ncharacteristic frequency (CPcf) and a\nchannel power amplitude at switching frequency (CPsw) are chosen as oscillation\nlevel indicators. If the converter is stable,\nthe CPcf is a very small pulse and the CPsw\nis a larger, clear, single pulse. At early\nstage of oscillation, the CPcf increases to a\ncertain level and the CPsw shows a small\npair of sideband pulses around it. If the\nconverter oscillates, the CPcf reaches to a\nhigher level and the CPsw shows more\nhigh-level sideband pulses. A comprehensive stability index (CSI) is adopted as a\nquantitative measure to accurately assign\na degree of stability to a specific DC/DC\nconverter. The CSI is a ratio of normal\nand abnormal power spectral density, and\ncan be calculated using specified and\nmeasured CPcf and CPsw data.\n\nThe novel and unique feature of this\ntechnique is the use of power channel\namplitudes at characteristic frequency\nand switching frequency to evaluate stability and identify oscillations at an early\nstage without interfering with a DC/DC\nconverter\xe2\x80\x99s normal operation. This technique eliminates the probing problem\nof a gain/phase margin method by connecting the power input to a spectral analyzer. Therefore, it is able to evaluate\nstability for all kinds of hybrid DC/DC\nconverters with or without remote sense\npins, and is suitable for real-time and incircuit testing. This frequency-domain\ntechnique is more sensitive to detect oscillation at early stage than the time-domain method using an oscilloscope.\nThis work was done by Bright L.

Each\nconnects to a single server (the controller) and waits for instructions. The\ncontroller directs the interferometer to\nseveral images, then assigns each image\nto a different computer for processing.\nWhen the image processing is finished,\nthe server directs one of the computers\n\nto collate and combine the processed\nimages, saving the resulting measurement in a file on a disk.\nThe available software captures approximately 100 images and analyzes\nthem immediately. This software separates the capture and analysis\nprocesses, so that analysis can be done\n\n7\n\nat a different time and faster by running the algorithm in parallel across\nseveral processors.\nThe PhaseCam family of interferometers can measure an optical system in\nmilliseconds, but it takes many seconds\nto process the data so that it is usable. In\ncharacterizing an adaptive optics system,\nlike the next generation of astronomical\nobservatories, thousands of measure-\n\n8\n\nments are required, and the processing\ntime quickly becomes excessive.\nA programming interface distributes\ndata processing for a PhaseCam interferometer across a Windows computing\ncluster. A scriptable controller program\ncoordinates data acquisition from the interferometer, storage on networked\nhard disks, and parallel processing. Idle\ntime of the interferometer is minimized.\n\nThis architecture is implemented in\nPython and JavaScript, and may be altered to fit a customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs.\nThis work was done by Shanti R. Rao of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For\nmore information, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

These receivers meet\nthe requirements for high-resolution\nspectroscopic studies of planetary atmospheres (including the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s) from\nspacecraft, as well as airborne and balloon platforms. The ongoing research is\nsignificant not only for the development\nof Schottky mixers, but also for the creation of a receiver system, including the\nLO chain.\n\nThe new receivers meet the goals of\nhigh sensitivity, compact size, low total\npower requirement, and operation\nacross complete waveguide bands. The\nexceptional performance makes these\nreceivers ideal for the broader range of\nscientific and commercial applications.\nThese include the extension of sophisticated test and measurement equipment\nto 1 THz and the development of lowcost imaging systems for security applications and industrial process monitoring.\nAs a particular example, a WR-1.9SHM\n\n4000\n\n(400\xe2\x80\x93600 GHz) has been developed (see\nFigure 1), with state-of-the-art noise temperature ranging from 1,000\xe2\x80\x931,800 K\n(DSB) over the full waveguide band.\nAlso, a Vector Network Analyzer extender has been developed (see Figure 2)\nfor the WR1.5 waveguide band (500\xe2\x80\x93750\nGHz) with 100-dB dynamic range.\nThis work was done by Jeffrey Hesler and\nThomas Crowe of Virginia Diodes, Inc. for Goddard Space Flight Center.

In\nelectronic resonators based on Si integrated circuits, resistive losses increase as\na result of the continued reduction in device dimensions, which decreases their Q\nvalues. On the other hand, due to the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nmechanical construct of bulk acoustic\nwave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave\n(SAW) resonators, such loss mechanisms\nare absent, enabling higher Q-values for\nboth BAW and SAW resonators compared to their electronic counterparts.\nThe other advantages of mechanical resonators are their inherently higher radiation tolerance, a factor that makes them\n\nattractive for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s extreme environment planetary missions, for example to\nthe Jovian environments where the radiation doses are at hostile levels. Despite\nthese advantages, both BAW and SAW\nresonators suffer from low resonant frequencies and they are also physically\nlarge, which precludes their integration\ninto miniaturized electronic systems.\n\n9\n\nBecause there is a need to move the\nresonant frequency of oscillators to the\norder of gigahertz, new technologies\nand materials are being investigated that\nwill make performance at those frequencies attainable. By moving to nanoscale\nstructures, in this case vertically oriented, cantilevered carbon nanotubes\n(CNTs), that have larger aspect ratios\n(length/thickness) and extremely high\nelastic moduli, it is possible to overcome\nthe two disadvantages of both bulk\nacoustic wave (BAW) and surface\nacoustic wave (SAW) resonators.\nNano-electro-mechanical\nsystems\n(NEMS) that utilize high aspect ratio\nnanomaterials exhibiting high elastic\nmoduli (e.g., carbon-based nanomaterials) benefit from high Qs, operate at\nhigh frequency, and have small force\nconstants that translate to high responsivity that results in improved sensitivity,\nlower power consumption, and improved tunablity. NEMS resonators have\nrecently been demonstrated using topdown, lithographically fabricated approaches to form cantilever or bridgetype structures. Top-down approaches,\nhowever, rely on complicated and expensive e-beam lithography, and often\nrequire a release mechanism. Resonance effects in structures synthesized\nusing bottom-up approaches have also\nrecently been reported based on carbon\nnanotubes, but such approaches have relied on a planar two-dimensional (2D)\ngeometry. In this innovation, vertically\naligned tubes synthesized using a bot-\n\ntom-up approach have been considered,\nwhere the vertical orientation of the\ntubes has the potential to increase integration density even further.\nThe simulation of a vertically oriented, cantilevered carbon nanotube\nwas performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, a finite element simulation\npackage. All simulations were performed in a 2D geometry that provided\nconsistent results and minimized computational complexity. The simulations\nassumed a vertically oriented, cantilevered nanotube of uniform density\n(1.5 g/cm3). An elastic modulus was assumed to be 600 GPa, relative permittivity of the nanotube was assumed to be\n5.0, and Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio was assumed to\nbe 0.2. It should be noted that the relative permittivity and Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio for\nthe nanotubes of interest are not known\naccurately. However, as in previous simulations, the relative permittivity and Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratios were treated as weak variables in the simulation, and no\nsignificant changes were recognized\nwhen these variables were varied.\nOf interest in the simulations of a\nCNT resonator were the structural strain\nand deflection of the nanotube, and the\nelectrostatic interactions between the\nnanotube and nanomanipulator probe.\nStructural boundary conditions were\narranged such that the exposed lengths\nand tip of the nanotube were allowed to\nmove freely while all other surfaces were\nheld fixed (including the nanotube\nbase). These conditions simulated a\n\nfixed, cantilevered beam in a domain adjacent to a nanomanipulator probe of\ninfinite elastic modulus. Electrostatic\nboundary conditions were chosen such\nthat the nanotube was grounded, an AC\nvoltage with DC bias was applied to the\nsurface of the nanoprobe adjacent to\nthe nanotube, and all other boundaries\nin the system were selected such that no\nelectrical charge exists on, or outside of,\nthose surfaces. The solution domain was\nsimulated as a vacuum. Preliminary experiments have suggested that electromechanical coupling can occur between\na scanning electron microscope (SEM)\nbeam and a vertically oriented, cantilever carbon nanofiber (CNF) causing\nthe CNF to mechanically resonate with\ndisplacements two or three times larger\nthan the tube diameters.\nThis work was done by Anupama B.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe ultracapacitor-based uninterrupted power supply (UPS) system enhances system reliability; reduces life-ofsystem, maintenance, and downtime\ncosts; and greatly reduces environmental\nimpact when compared to conventional\nUPS energy storage systems. This design\nprovides power when required and absorbs power when required to smooth\nthe system load and also has excellent\nlow-temperature performance. The UPS\nused during hardware tests at Glenn is\nan efficient, compact, maintenance-free,\nrack-mount, pure sine-wave inverter\nunit.\n\n10\n\nThe UPS provides a continuous output power up to 1,700 W with a surge rating of 1,870 W for up to one minute at a\nnominal output voltage of 115 VAC. The\nultracapacitor energy storage system\ntested in conjunction with the UPS is\nrated at 5.8 F. This is a bank of ten symmetric ultracapacitor modules.\nEach module is actively balanced\nusing a linear voltage balancing technique in which the cell-to-cell leakage is\ndependent upon the imbalance of the\nindividual cells. The ultracapacitors are\ncharged by a DC power supply, which\ncan provide up to 300 VDC at 4 A. A\n\nconstant-voltage,\nconstant-current\npower supply was selected for this application. The long life of ultracapacitors\ngreatly enhances system reliability,\nwhich is significant in critical applications such as medical power systems and\nspace power systems. The energy storage system can usually last longer than\nthe application, given its 20-year life\nspan. This means that the ultracapacitors will probably never need to be replaced and disposed of, whereas batteries require frequent replacement and\ndisposal. The charge-discharge efficiency of rechargeable batteries is ap-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nproximately 50 percent, and after some\nhundreds of charges and discharges,\nthey must be replaced. The charge-discharge efficiency of ultracapacitors exceeds 90 percent, and can accept more\nthan a million charges and discharges.\nThus, there is a significant energy savings through the efficiency improvement, and there is far less downtime for\napplications and labor involved in replacing an ultracapacitor versus batter-\n\nies. Also, the lengthy lifespan of this design would greatly reduce the disposal\nproblems posed by lead acid, nickel cadmium, lithium, and nickel metal hydride batteries.\nThis innovation is recyclable by nature, which further reduces system costs.\nThe disposal of ultracapacitors is simple,\nas they are constructed of non-hazardous\ncomponents. They are also safer than\nbatteries in that they can be easily dis-\n\ncharged, and left indefinitely in a safe,\ndischarged state where batteries cannot.\nThis work was done by Dennis J.

The antennas must survive all\nground operations plus the nominal\n670-Martian-day mission that includes\nsummer and winter seasons of the Mars\nenvironment.\nSuccessful development of processes\nestablished coaxial cable hardware fatigue limits, which were well beyond the\nexpected in-flight exposures. In keeping\nwith traditional qualification philoso-\n\nphy, this was accomplished by subjecting\nflight-representative coaxial cables to\ntemperature cycling of the same depth\nas expected in-flight, but for three times\nthe expected number of in-flight thermal cycles.\nInsertion loss and return loss tests\nwere performed on the coaxial cables\nduring the thermal chamber breaks. A\nvector network analyzer was calibrated\nand operated over the operational frequency range 7.145 to 8.450 GHz. Even\nthough some of the exposed cables\nfunction only at UHF frequencies (approximately 400 MHz), the testing was\n\nmore sensitive, and extending the test\nrange down to 400 MHz would have cost\nfrequency resolution.\nThe Gore flexible coaxial cables,\nwhich were the subject of these tests,\nproved to be robust and displayed no\nsign of degradation due to the 3X exposure to the punishing Mars surface operations cycles.\nThis work was done by Rajeshuni Ramesham, Wayne L.

A register is programmed with a command, which is\nused to select the signals that are sent\noff-chip and out of the housing for monitoring by test engineers and external\ntest equipment.\nThe register can be commanded by\nany suitable means: for example, it\n\ncould be commanded through a command port that would normally be used\nin the operation of the system. In the\noriginal application of the technique,\ncommanding of the register is performed via a MIL-STD-1553B communication subsystem.\nThis work was done by Richard Katz and\nIgor Kleyner of Goddard Space Flight Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).

Previous work\nhas been done in re-tasking a single\nEarth orbiter or a Mars rover in response to that craft detecting a science\nevent. This work enables multiple spacecraft to communicate (over a network\ndesigned for deep-space communications) and autonomously coordinate the\ncharacterization of such a science event.\nThis work investigates a new paradigm\nof space science campaigns where opportunistic science observations are autonomously coordinated among multiple\nspacecraft. In this paradigm, opportunistic science detections can be cued by multiple assets where a second asset is requested to take additional observations\ncharacterizing the identified surface feature or event. To support this new paradigm, an autonomous science system for\nmultiple spacecraft assets was integrated\nwith the Interplanetary Network DTN\n(Delay Tolerant Network) to provide communication between spacecraft assets.\nThis technology enables new mission\nconcepts that are not feasible with current technology. The ability to rapidly\ncoordinate activities across spacecraft\nwithout requiring ground in the loop\nenables rapid reaction to dynamic\nevents across platforms, such as a survey\ninstrument followed by a targeted highresolution instrument, as well as regular\nsimultaneous observations.\nThis work was done by Tara A.

However, the underlying internal\nstatic error is unknown and uncorrected by this process. The dedicated\nwavefront sensor device necessarily lies\nalong a different path than the science\ncamera, and, therefore, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t measure the true errors along the path leading to the final detected imagery. This\nis a standard problem in adaptive optics\n(AO) called \xe2\x80\x9cnon-common path error.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe previous method of calibrating\nthis error consisted of manually applying different polynomial shapes (via actuator voltages) at different magnitudes onto the deformable mirror and\nnoting if the final image quality had\nimproved or deteriorated, before moving onto the next polynomial mode.\nThis is a limited, time-consuming, and\nsubjective process, and structural and\nenvironmental changes over time necessitate a new calibration over a period of months.\nThe Autonomous Phase Retrieval Calibration (APRC) software suite performs\nautomated sensing and correction iterations to calibrate the Palomar AO system\nto levels that were previously unreachable. APRC controls several movable\ncomponents inside the AO system to collect the required data, automatically\nprocesses data using an adaptive phase\nretrieval algorithm, and automatically\ncalculates new sets of actuator voltage\ncommands for the deformable mirror.\nAPRC manages and preserves all essential data during this process.\nThe APRC software calculates the true\nwavefront error of the full optical system,\nthen uses the existing AO system deformable mirror (DM) to correct the detected error. This provides a significant\nleap in performance by precisely correcting what were once \xe2\x80\x9cun-calibratable\xe2\x80\x9d errors. Furthermore, the corrective pattern\nfound by this process serves as the underlying nominal shape of the DM, upon\nwhich the adaptive corrections for atmospheric turbulence are based.\nThis work was done by Siddarayappa A.\nBikkannavar, Catherine M.

It accepts the EOS\nMLS Level 0 science/engineering data,\nand the EOS Aura spacecraft\nephemeris/attitude data, and produces\ncalibrated instrument radiances and associated engineering and diagnostic\ndata. This version makes the code more\nrobust, improves calibration, provides\nmore diagnostics outputs, defines the\nGalactic core more finely, and fixes the\nequator crossing.\nThe Level 1 processing software manages several different tasks. It qualifies each\ndata quantity using instrument configuration and checksum data, as well as data\ntransmission quality flags. Statistical tests\nare applied for data quality and reasonableness. The instrument engineering data\n(e.g., voltages, currents, temperatures, and\nencoder angles) is calibrated by the software, and the filter channel space reference measurements are interpolated onto\nthe times of each limb measurement with\nthe interpolates being differenced from\nthe measurements. Filter channel calibration target measurements are interpolated\nonto the times of each limb measurement,\nand are used to compute radiometric gain.\nThe total signal power is determined and\nanalyzed by each digital autocorrelator\nspectrometer (DACS) during each data integration. The software converts each\nDACS data integration from an autocorrelation measurement in the time domain\ninto a spectral measurement in the frequency domain, and estimates separately\nthe spectrally, smoothly varying and spectrally averaged components of the limb\nport signal arising from antenna emission\nand scattering effects. Limb radiances are\nalso calibrated.\nThe radiance at the limb port of the\nradiometer module is computed, including non-atmospheric radiance contributions from antenna emission and scattering. It is the task of the retrieval/forward\nmodel software (Level 2) to compute\nthe atmospheric component of the limb\nradiation reaching this interface. It is necessitated by the greatly increased bandwidth of EOS MLS radiometers, and the\n\n13\n\ndouble-sideband nature of most measurements. Estimates of the random component of uncertainty (noise) on each\nlimb radiance are also determined.\nSpacecraft inertial pointing and star\ntracker data are combined with spacecraft and GHz antenna structural/thermal data and scan mechanism encoder\ndata to estimate the boresight angles for\neach radiometer. The software collects\nand generates ancillary data (e.g., tangent point location, local solar time,\nlocal solar zenith angle, flags for bright\nobjects in the field of view) that are\nneeded in Level 2 processing.

The Tour Atlas\nconsisted of several hundreds of\nmegabytes of EVENTS mission planning\nsoftware outputs, tables, plots, and images used by mission scientists for observation planning. Each time the nominal\n\n14\n\nmission trajectory was altered or\ntweaked, a new Tour Atlas had to be regenerated manually.\nIn the early phases of Cassini\xe2\x80\x99s Equinox Mission planning, an a priori estimate suggested that mission tour designers would develop approximately 30\ncandidate tours within a short period of\ntime. So that Cassini scientists could\nproperly analyze the science opportunities in each candidate tour quickly and\nthoroughly so that the optimal series of\norbits for science return could be selected, a separate Tour Atlas was required for each trajectory.\nThe task of manually generating the\nnumber of trajectory analyses in the allotted time would have been impossible,\nso the entire task was automated using\ncode written in five different programming languages. This software automates the generation of the Cassini Tour\nAtlas database. It performs with one\nUNIX command what previously took a\nday or two of human labor.\nThis work was done by Kevin R.

The main advantage is the light weight and high\nstiffness-to-mass ratio relative to aluminum.\nMeter-class optics require support\nduring the grinding/polishing process\nwith large tools. The use of aluminum\nas a polishing fixture is standard, with\npitch providing a compliant layer to\nallow support without deformation.\nUnfortunately, with meter-scale optics,\na meter-scale fixture weighs over 120 lb\n(\xe2\x89\x8855 kg) and may distort the optics\nbeing fabricated by loading the mirror\nand/or tool used in fabrication. The\nuse of composite structures that are\nlightweight yet stiff allows standard\ntechniques to be used while providing\nfor a decrease in fixture weight by almost 70 percent.\n\nMounts classically used to support\nlarge mirrors during fabrication are especially heavy and difficult to handle. The\nmount must be especially stiff to avoid deformation during the optical fabrication\nprocess, where a very large and heavy lap\noften can distort the mount and optic\nbeing fabricated. If the optic is placed on\ntop of the lapping tool, the weight of the\noptic and the fixture can distort the lap.\nFixtures to support the mirror during\nfabrication are often very large plates of\naluminum, often 2 in. (\xe2\x89\x885 cm) or more in\nthickness and weight upwards of 150 lb\n(\xe2\x89\x8868 kg). With the addition of a backing\nmaterial such as pitch and the mirror itself, the assembly can often weigh over\n250 lb (\xe2\x89\x88113 kg) for a meter-class optic.\nThis innovation is the use of a lightweight graphite panel with an aluminum\nhoneycomb core for use as the polishing\nfixture. These materials have been used\n\nin the aerospace industry as structural\nmembers due to their light weight and\nhigh stiffness. The grinding polishing fixture consists of the graphite composite\npanel, fittings, and fixtures to allow interface to the polishing machine, and introduction of pitch buttons to support the\noptic under fabrication. In its operation,\nthe grinding polishing fixture acts as a\nreaction structure to the polishing tool.\nIt must be stiff enough to avoid imparting a distorted shape to the optic under\nfabrication and light enough to avoid\nself-deflection. The fixture must also\nwithstand significant tangential loads\nfrom the polishing machine during operations.\nThis work was done by John Hagopian,\nCarl Strojny, and Jason Budinoff of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nOxygen system components fabricated by Laser Engineered Net Shaping\xe2\x84\xa2 (LENS\xe2\x84\xa2) could result in improved safety and performance. LENS\xe2\x84\xa2\nis a near-net shape manufacturing\nprocess fusing powdered materials injected into a laser beam.

Hence, surfaces exposed to oxygen could be constructed of an oxygencompatible\nmaterial\nwhile\nthe\nremainder of the part could be one chosen for strength or reduced weight. Unlike conventional coating applications, a\ncompositional gradient would exist between the two materials, so no abrupt\n\nmaterial boundary exists.

The key innovation\nin this effort is to combine recently available large, high-photorefractive-damage-\n\nthreshold, z-cut 5% MgO:LN with novel\nridge fabrication techniques to achieve\nhigh-optical power, low-cost, high-volume manufacturing of frequency conversion structures. The proposed ridge\n\n15\n\nwaveguide structure should maintain the\ncharacteristics of the periodically poled\nbulk substrate, allowing for the efficient\nfrequency conversion typical of waveguides and the high optical damage\nthreshold and long lifetimes typical of\nthe 5% doped bulk substrate. The low\ncost and large area of 5% MgO:LN\nwafers, and the improved performance\nof the proposed ridge waveguide structure, will enhance existing measurement\ncapabilities as well as reduce the resources required to achieve high-performance specifications.\nThe purpose of the ridge waveguides\nin MgO:LN is to provide platform tech-\n\nnology that will improve optical power\nhandling and conversion efficiency\ncompared to existing waveguide technology. The proposed ridge waveguide\nis produced using standard microfabrication techniques. The approach is enabled by recent advances in inductively\ncoupled plasma etchers and chemical\nmechanical planarization techniques.\nIn conjunction with wafer bonding,\nthis fabrication methodology can be\nused to create arbitrarily shaped waveguides allowing complex optical circuits to be engineered in nonlinear optical materials such as magnesium\ndoped lithium niobate. Researchers\n\nhere have identified NLO (nonlinear\noptical) ridge waveguide structures as\nhaving suitable value to be the leading\nfrequency conversion structures. Its\nvalue is based on having the low-cost\nfabrication necessary to satisfy the challenging pricing requirements as well as\nachieve the power handling and other\nspecifications in a suitably compact\npackage.\nThis work was done by Phillip Himmer of\nMontana State University and Philip Battle,\nWilliam Suckow, and Greg Switzer of AdvR\nInc. for Goddard Space Flight Center.

Heretofore, it has\nbeen common practice to modify the\nfibers rather than the matrices: The\nfibers are modified by chemical\nand/or physical surface treatments\nprior to combining the fibers with matrix resins \xe2\x80\x94 an approach that entails\nconsiderable expense and usually results in degradation (typically, weakening) of fibers.\nThe alternative approach of modifying the matrix resins does not entail\ndegradation of fibers, and affords opportunities for improving the mechanical properties of the fiber composites.\n\n16\n\nThe alternative approach is more costeffective, not only because it eliminates expensive fiber-surface treatments but also because it does not\nentail changes in procedures for manufacturing conventional compositematerial structures.\nThe alternative approach is best described by citing an example of its application to a composite of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)\nfibers in an epoxy matrix. The epoxy matrix was modified to a chemically reactive, polarized epoxy nano-matrix to increase the degrees of wetting and\nadhesion between the fibers and the matrix. The modification was effected by incorporating a small proportion (0.3\nweight percent) of reactive graphitic\nnanofibers produced from functional-\n\nized nanofibers into the epoxy matrix\nresin prior to combining the resin with\nthe UHMWPE fibers. The resulting increase in fiber/matrix adhesion manifested itself in several test results, notably\nincluding an increase of 25 percent in\nthe maximum fiber pullout force and an\nincrease of 60\xe2\x80\x9365 percent in fiber pullout energy. In addition, it was conjectured that the functionalized nanofibers\nbecame involved in the cross linking reaction of the epoxy resin, with resultant\nenhancement of the mechanical properties and lower viscosity of the matrix.\nThis work was done by Katie Zhong of North\nDakota State University for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

This concept was developed as a response to the break-off and\nretention requirements.\nThe wedges wrap around the estimated average diameter of the core to\n\nget as many contact locations as possible, and are then pushed inward, radially, through the core towards one another. This starts a crack and begins to\napply opposing forces inside the core\nto propagate the crack across the plane\nof contact.\nThe advantage is in the simplicity.\nOnly two teeth are needed to break five\nvarieties of Mars-like rock cores with\nlimited penetration and reasonable\nforces. Its major advantage is that it does\nnot require any length of rock to be attached to the parent in order to break\nthe core at the desired location. Test\ndata shows that some rocks break off on\n\ntheir own into segments or break off\ninto discs. This idea would grab and retain a disc, push some discs upward and\nothers out, or grab a segment, break it\nat the contact plane, and retain the portion inside of the device. It also does\nthis with few moving parts in a simple,\nspace-efficient design.\nThis discovery could be implemented\ninto a coring drill bit to precisely break\noff and retain any size rock core.\nThis work was done by Megan Richardson\nand Justin Lin of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Additionally, a sample tube\ncan be housed inside the inner tube for\nstoring the sample. The inner tube fits inside the outer tube, which fits inside the\ndrill tube. The inner and outer tubes can\nmove axially relative to each other. The\ninner tube presents two lamellae with two\nopposing grabbing teeth and one pushing tooth. The pushing tooth is offset axially from the grabbing teeth. The teeth\ncan move radially and their motion is\ncontrolled by the outer tube. The outer\ntube presents two lamellae with radial extrusions to control the inner tube lamel-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nNut\n\nPin\n\nRock\n\nSupport\n\nPush\n\nCore\n\nDrill Tube\n\nInner Tube\nOuter Tube\n\nGrab\n\nThe Praying Mantis Core Breakoff Mechanism design assembly (left), and (right) the outer (green) and\ninner tubes (blue).\n\nlae motion. In breaking the core, the\nmechanism creates two support points\n(the grabbing teeth and the bit tip) and\none push point. The core is broken in\nbending. The grabbing teeth can also act\nas a core retention mechanism.\n\nThe praying mantis that is disclosed\nherein is an active core breaking/retention mechanism that requires only one\nadditional actuator other than the\ndrilling actuator.

NPO-47356\n\nScoring Dawg Core Breakoff and Retention Mechanism\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThis novel core break-off and retention mechanism consists of a scoring\ndawg controlled by a set of two tubes (a\ndrill tube and an inner tube). The drill\ntube and the inner tube have longitudinal concentric holes. The solution can\nbe implemented in an eccentric tube\nconfiguration as well where the tubes\nhave eccentric longitudinal holes. The\ninner tube presents at the bottom two\ncontrol surfaces for controlling the orientation of the scoring dawg. The drill\ntube presents a sunk-in profile on the\ninside of the wall for housing the scoring dawg. The inner tube rotation relative to the drill tube actively controls the\norientation of the scoring dawg and\nhence its penetration and retrieval from\nthe core. The scoring dawg presents a\nshaft, two axially spaced arms, and a\n\ntooth. The two arms slide on the control\nsurfaces of the inner tube. The tooth,\nwhen rotated, can penetrate or be extracted from the core.\nDuring drilling, the two tubes move together maintaining the scoring dawg\ncompletely outside the core. After the desired drilling depth has been reached the\ninner tube is rotated relative to the drill\ntube such that the tooth of the scoring\ndawg moves toward the central axis. By\nrotating the drill tube, the scoring dawg\ncan score the core and so reduce its cross\nsectional area. The scoring dawg can also\nact as a stress concentrator for breaking\nthe core in torsion or tension. After\nbreaking the core, the scoring dawg can\nact as a core retention mechanism.\nFor scoring, it requires the core to be\nattached to the rock. If the core is bro-\n\nken, the dawg can be used as a retention mechanism. The scoring dawg requires a hard-tip insert like tungsten\ncarbide for scoring hard rocks. The relative rotation of the two tubes can be\ncontrolled manually or by an additional\nactuator. In the implemented design solution the bit rotation for scoring was in\nthe same direction as the drilling. The\ndevice was tested for limestone cores\nand basalt cores. The torque required\nfor breaking the 10-mm diameter limestone cores was 5 to 5.8 lb-in. (0.56 to\n0.66 N-m).\nThis work was done by Mircea Badescu,\nStewart Sherrit, Yoseph Bar-Cohen, Xiaoqi Bao,\nand Paul G. Backes of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

An additional problem is designing a mechanism\nthat can be implemented at a small scale that is robust\nand versatile enough to be used for a variety of core\nsamples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill\ntube and an inner tube) and a rolling element (rolling\ntooth). An additional tube can be used as a sample\ntube. The drill tube and the inner tube have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each\ntube. The two eccentricities are equal. The inner tube\nfits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside\nthe inner tube.\nWhile drilling, the two tubes are positioned relative\nto each other such that the sample tube is aligned with\nthe drill tube axis and core. The drill tube includes\nteeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The inner tube\nincludes, at the base, the rolling element implemented\nas a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot.

When the drilling depth\nhas been reached, the drill bit assembly\nis rotated in the opposite direction, and\nthe rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core. Depending on the\nstrength of the created core, the rolling\ntooth can score, lock the inner tube rela-\n\ntive to the core, start the eccentric motion of the inner tube, and break the\ncore. The tooth and the relative position\nof the two tubes can act as a core catcher\nor core-retention mechanism as well.\nThe design was made to fit the core and\nhole parameters produced by an existing\nbit; the parts were fabricated and a series\nof demonstration tests were performed.\nThis invention is potentially applicable to sample return and in situ missions\n\nto planets such as Mars and Venus, to\nmoons such as Titan and Europa, and to\ncomets.

In order to realize this potential, a number of hurdles\nmust be overcome. Most importantly,\nthe signaling mechanisms necessary to\ncontrol the differentiation of stem cells\ninto tissues of interest remain to be elucidated, and much of the present research on stem cells is focused on this\ngoal. Nevertheless, it will also be essential to achieve large-scale expansion and,\nin many cases, assemble cells in 3D as\ntransplantable tissues. To this end, microgravity analog bioreactors can play a\nsignificant role.\nMicrogravity bioreactors were originally conceived as a tool to study the cellular responses to microgravity. However, the technology can address some of\nthe shortcomings of conventional cell\nculture systems; namely, the deficiency\nof mass transport in static culture and\nhigh mechanical shear forces in stirred\nsystems. Unexpectedly, the conditions\ncreated in the vessel were ideal for 3D\ncell culture. Recently, investigators have\ndemonstrated the capability of the microgravity bioreactors to expand\nhematopoietic stem cells compared to\n\nstatic culture, and facilitate the differentiation of umbilical cord stem cells into\n3D liver aggregates.\nStem cells are capable of differentiating into functional cells. However, there\nare no reliable methods to induce the\nstem cells to form specific cells or to gain\nenough cells for transplantation, which\nlimits their application in clinical therapy. The aim of this study is to select the\nbest experimental setup to reach high\nproliferation levels by culturing these\ncells in a microgravity-based bioreactor.\nIn typical cell culture, the cells sediment\nto the bottom surface of their container\nand propagate as a one-cell-layer sheet.\nPrevention of such sedimentation affords the freedom for self-assembly and\nthe propagation of 3D tissue arrays.\nSuspension of cells is easily achievable\nusing stirred technologies. Unfortunately, in conventional bioreactors, stirring\ninvokes deleterious forces that disrupt\ncell aggregation and results in cell death.\nFirst-generation rotating bioreactors provided rotation on the horizontal axis,\nwhich resulted in the suspension of cells\nwithout stirring, thus providing a suitable\nenvironment to propagate cells without\nsedimentation to a surface. The rotating-\n\nwall bioreactors did not provide a way to\nremove air bubbles that were causing\nshear and disrupting 3D cultures. Johnson Space Center successfully engineered\nthe hydrofocusing bioreactor (HFB) that\nresolved the problem of removing the air\nbubbles from the fluid medium of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s rotating-wall space bioreactors.\nThe HFB uses the principle of hydrodynamic focusing that simultaneously\nproduces a low-shear fluid culture environment and a variable hydrofocusing\nforce that can control the movement, location, and removal of suspended cells,\ntissues, and air bubbles from the bioreactor. The HFB is a rotating, domeshaped cell culture vessel with a centrally\nlocated sampling port and an internal\nviscous spinner. The vessel and spinner\ncan rotate at different speeds either in\nthe same or opposite directions. Rotation of the vessel and viscous interaction\nat the spinner generate a hydrofocusing\nforce. Adjusting the differential rotation\nrate between vessel and spinner controls\nthe magnitude of the force.\nThis work was done by Pier Paolo Claudio\nand Jagan Valluri of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

GSC-15807-1\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment of Neurological Disorders by\nMillimeter-Wave Stimulation\nThese techniques enable new treatments for neurological disorders and dysfunction.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nIncreasingly, millimeter waves are\nbeing employed for telecomm, radar,\nand imaging applications. To date in the\nU.S, however, very few investigations on\nthe impact of this radiation on biological systems at the cellular level have\nbeen undertaken. In the beginning, to\nexamine the impact of millimeter waves\non cellular processes, researchers discovered that cell membrane depolarization may be triggered by low levels of in-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\ntegrated power at these high frequencies. Such a situation could be used to\nadvantage in the direct stimulation of\nneuronal cells for applications in neuroprosthetics and diagnosing or treating\nneurological disorders.\nAn experimental system was set up to\ndirectly monitor cell response on exposure to continuous-wave, fixed-frequency, millimeter-wave radiation at\nlow and modest power levels (0.1 to\n\n100 safe exposure standards) between\n50 and 100 GHz. Two immortalized cell\nlines derived from lung and neuronal\ntissue were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) that locates on\nthe inside of the cell membrane lipid\nbi-layer. Oxonol dye was added to the\ncell medium. When membrane depolarization occurs, the oxonal bound to\nthe outer wall of the lipid bi-layer can\npenetrate close to the inner wall where\n\n23\n\nthe GFP resides. Under fluorescent excitation (488 nm), the normally green\nGFP (520 nm) optical signal quenches\nand gives rise to a red output when the\noxonol comes close enough to the GFP\nto excite a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with an output at\n620 nm.\nThe presence of a strong FRET signature upon exposures of 30 seconds to 2\nminutes at 5\xe2\x80\x9310 mW/cm2 RF power at 50\nGHz, followed by a return to the normal\n520-nm GFP signal after a few minutes\nindicating repolarization of the membrane, indicates that low levels of RF energy may be able to trigger non-destructive membrane depolarization without\ndirect cell contact. Such a mechanism\ncould be used to stimulate neuronal cells\nin the cortex without the need for invasive electrodes as millimeter waves penetrate skin and bone on the order of 1\xe2\x80\x935\n\n24\n\nmm in depth. Although 50 GHz could\nnot readily penetrate from the outer\nskull to the center of the cortex, implants\non the outer skull or even on the scalp\ncould reach the outer layer of the cerebral cortex where substantial benefit\ncould be realized from such non-contact\ntype excitation.\nThe stimulation system described\nhere for cerebral cortex, brainstem,\nspinal cord, or peripheral nerves includes an implantable housing, a control unit carried by the implantable\nhousing, a millimeter-wave delivery device (including at least one emission\nsite), and at least one millimeter-wave\nsource operatively coupled to the control unit, and coupled to at least one millimeter-wave emission site. Optional\ncomponents for monitoring of neuronal\nfunction can be included, such as an\nelectroencephalographic system, an\n\nelectromyographic system, a system for\noptical or infrared imaging of intrinsic\nneuronal signals, and/or magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy systems.\nThis work was done by Peter H.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA passive vaporizing heat sink has been\ndeveloped as a relatively lightweight,\ncompact alternative to related prior heat\nsinks based, variously, on evaporation of\nsprayed liquids or on sublimation of\nsolids. This heat sink is designed for\nshort-term dissipation of a large amount\nof heat and was originally intended for\nuse in regulating the temperature of\nspacecraft equipment during launch or\nre-entry. It could also be useful in a terrestrial setting in which there is a require-\n\nment for a lightweight, compact means of\nshort-term cooling. This heat sink includes a hermetic package closed with a\npressure-relief valve and containing an\nexpendable and rechargeable coolant\nliquid (e.g., water) and a conductive carbon-fiber wick. The vapor of the liquid escapes when the temperature exceeds the\nboiling point corresponding to the vapor\npressure determined by the setting of the\npressure-relief valve. The great advantage\nof this heat sink over a melting-paraffin\n\nor similar phase-change heat sink of\nequal capacity is that by virtue of the\n\xe2\x89\x8810\xc3\x97 greater latent heat of vaporization,\na coolant-liquid volume equal to \xe2\x89\x881/10 of\nthe paraffin volume can suffice.\nThis work was done by Timothy R.\nKnowles, Victor A.

MSC-23414-1\n\nRemote Sensing and Quantization of Analog Sensors\nThis technique has applications in automotive ride and steering sensors, and in industrial\nvibration and process monitors.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThis method enables sensing and\nquantization of analog strain gauges. By\nmanufacturing a piezoelectric sensor\nstack in parallel (physical) with a piezoelectric actuator stack, the capacitance\nof the sensor stack varies in exact proportion to the exertion applied by the\nactuator stack. This, in turn, varies the\noutput frequency of the local sensor oscillator. The output, Fout, is fed to a\nphase detector, which is driven by a stable reference, Fref.\nThe output of the phase detector is a\nsquare waveform, Dout, whose duty cycle,\ntW, varies in exact proportion according\nto whether Fout is higher or lower than\nFref. In this design, should Fout be precisely equal to Fref, then the waveform\nhas an exact 50/50 duty cycle.\n\nThe waveform, Dout, is of generally\nvery low frequency suitable for safe\ntransmission over long distances without\ncorruption. The active portion of the\nwaveform, tW, gates a remotely located\ncounter, which is driven by a stable oscillator (source) of such frequency as to\ngive sufficient digitization of tW to the\nresolution required by the application.\nThe advantage to this scheme is that it\nnegates the most-common, present\nmethod of sending either very low level\nsignals (viz. direct output from the sensors) across great distances (anything over\none-half meter) or the need to transmit\nwidely varying higher frequencies over\nsignificant distances thereby eliminating\ninterference [both in terms of beat frequency generation and in-situ EMI (elec-\n\ntromagnetic interference)] caused by ineffective shielding. It also results in a significant reduction in shielding mass.\nThis work was done by Karl F.

GSC15977-1\n\nHelium-Cooled Black Shroud for Subscale Cryogenic Testing\nA sheet metal and honeycomb design allows a space-like thermal environment to be maintained\naround a test item.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThis shroud provides a deep-space\nsimulating environment for testing\nscaled-down models of passively cooling\nsystems for spaceflight optics and instruments. It is used inside a liquid-nitrogen-cooled vacuum chamber, and it\nis cooled by liquid helium to 5 K. It has\nan inside geometry of approximately\n1.6 m diameter by 0.45 m tall. The inside surfaces of its top and sidewalls\nhave a thermal absorptivity greater than\n0.96. The bottom wall has a large central opening that is easily customized to\nallow a specific test item to extend\nthrough it. This enables testing of scale\nmodels of realistic passive cooling configurations that feature a very large\ntemperature drop between the deepspace-facing cooled side and the\nSun/Earth-facing warm side.\nThis shroud has an innovative thermal closeout of the bottom wall, so that\na test sample can have a hot (room\ntemperature) side outside of the\nshroud, and a cold side inside the\nshroud. The combination of this closeout and the very black walls keeps radiated heat from the sample\xe2\x80\x99s warm end\nfrom entering the shroud, reflecting\n\n26\n\noff the walls and heating the sample\xe2\x80\x99s\ncold end.\nThe shroud includes 12 vertical rectangular sheet-copper side panels that\nare oriented in a circular pattern. Using\ntabs bent off from their edges, these side\npanels are bolted to each other and to a\nsteel support ring on which they rest.\nThe removable shroud top is a large copper sheet that rests on, and is bolted to,\nthe support ring when the shroud is\nclosed. The support ring stands on four\nfiberglass tube legs, which isolate it thermally from the vacuum chamber bottom.\nThe insides of the cooper top and side\npanels are completely covered with 25mm-thick aluminum honeycomb panels.\nThis honeycomb is painted black before\nit is epoxied to the copper surfaces. A\nspiral-shaped copper tube, clamped at\nmany different locations to the outside\nof the top copper plate, serves as part of\nthe liquid helium cooling loop.\nAnother copper tube, plumbed in a\nseries to the top plate\xe2\x80\x99s tube, is clamped\nto the sidewall tabs where they are\nbolted to the support ring. Flowing liquid helium through these tubes cools\nthe entire shroud to 5 K. The entire\n\nshroud is wrapped loosely in a layer of\ndouble-aluminized Kapton. The support\nring\xe2\x80\x99s inner diameter is the largest possible hole through which the test item can\nextend into the shroud.\nTwelve custom-sized trapezoidal copper sheets extend inward from the support ring to within a few millimeters of\nthe test item. Attached to the inner edge\nof each of these sheets is a customshaped strip of Kapton, which is aluminum-coated on the warm-facing\n(outer) side, and has thin Dacron netting attached to its cold-facing side. This\nKapton rests against the test item, but\nthe Dacron keeps it from making significant thermal contact. The result is a\nnon-contact, radiatively reflective thermal closeout with essentially no gap\nthrough which radiation can pass. In\nthis way, the part of the test item outside\nthe shroud can be heated to relatively\nhigh temperatures without any radiative\nheat leaking to the inside.\nThis work was done by James Tuttle,\nMichael Jackson, Michael DiPirro, and John\nFrancis for Goddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-15968-1\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nInformation Sciences\nReceive Mode Analysis and Design of Microstrip Reflectarrays\nA new method developed for the design of microstrip reflectarrays is extremely efficient.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nTraditionally microstrip or printed reflectarrays are designed using the \xe2\x80\x9ctransmit mode\xe2\x80\x9d technique. In this method,\nthe size of each printed element is chosen so as to provide the required value of\nthe reflection phase such that a collimated beam results along a given direction. The reflection phase of each\nprinted element is approximated using\nan infinite array model. The infinite\narray model is an excellent engineering\napproximation for a large microstrip\narray since the size or orientation of elements exhibits a slow spatial variation.\nIn this model, the reflection phase\nfrom a given printed element is approximated by that of an infinite array of elements of the same size and orientation\nwhen illuminated by a local plane wave.\nThus the reflection phase is a function of\nthe size (or orientation) of the element,\nthe elevation and azimuth angles of incidence of a local plane wave, and polarization. Typically, one computes the reflection phase of the infinite array as a\nfunction of several parameters such as\nsize/orientation, elevation and azimuth\nangles of incidence, and in some cases\nfor vertical and horizontal polarization.\nThe design requires the selection of the\nsize/orientation of the printed element\nto realize the required phase by interpolating or curve fitting all the computed\ndata. This is a substantially complicated\nproblem, especially in applications re-\n\nquiring a computationally intensive commercial code to determine the reflection\nphase. In dual polarization applications\nrequiring rectangular patches, one\nneeds to determine the reflection phase\nas a function of five parameters (dimensions of the rectangular patch, elevation\nand azimuth angles of incidence, and polarization). This is an extremely complex\nproblem.\nThe new method employs the reciprocity principle and reaction concept,\ntwo well-known concepts in electromagnetics to derive the receive mode analysis and design techniques. In the \xe2\x80\x9creceive mode design\xe2\x80\x9d technique, the\nreflection phase is computed for a\nplane wave incident on the reflectarray\nfrom the direction of the beam peak. In\nantenna applications with a single collimated beam, this method is extremely\nsimple since all printed elements see\nthe same angles of incidence. Thus the\nnumber of parameters is reduced by\ntwo when compared to the transmit\nmode design. The reflection phase\ncomputation as a function of five parameters in the rectangular patch array\ndiscussed previously is reduced to a\ncomputational problem with three parameters in the receive mode. Furthermore, if the beam peak is in the broadside direction, the receive mode design\nis polarization independent and the reflection phase computation is a func-\n\ntion of two parameters only. For a\nsquare patch array, it is a function of\nthe size, one parameter only, thus making it extremely simple.\nThe present method is substantially\nless intensive computationally. Since\nmost practical antenna arrays require\nthe design of a broadside beam or a single collimated beam, the receive mode\ndesign is expected to be substantially\nsimpler than the traditional transmit\nmode design. In addition, when a designer needs to generate the reflection\nphase data using a computer intensive\ncommercial software such as Ansoft\nHFSS, the reduction of computational\neffort in the receive mode will result in a\nsubstantial saving in design turnaround\ntime. Similarly the receive mode analysis\ntechnique has potential to save computer time for large reflectarrays.\nMicrostrip reflectarrays have desirable\nfeatures such as ease of design, manufacture, and deployment for application in\nmany space-based radar and remote\nsensing systems. They are being investigated for many JPL systems such as\nSWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography). The receive mode design and\nanalysis technique is expected to find\nmany future applications in NASA.\nThis work was done by Sembiam Rengarajan of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

NPO-47408\n\nChance-Constrained Guidance With Non-Convex Constraints\nThis solution can be used for non-convex guidance problems in small-body rendezvous,\nformation flight, and uninhabited aerial vehicle applications.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nMissions to small bodies, such as\ncomets or asteroids, require autonomous\nguidance for descent to these small bodies. Such guidance is made challenging\nby uncertainty in the position and velocity of the spacecraft, as well as the uncertainty in the gravitational field around\nthe small body. In addition, the require-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2011\n\nment to avoid collision with the asteroid\nrepresents a non-convex constraint that\nmeans finding the optimal guidance trajectory, in general, is intractable.\nIn this innovation, a new approach is\nproposed for chance-constrained optimal guidance with non-convex constraints. Chance-constrained guidance\n\ntakes into account uncertainty so that the\nprobability of collision is below a specified threshold. In this approach, a new\nbounding method has been developed\nto obtain a set of decomposed chance\nconstraints that is a sufficient condition\nof the original chance constraint. The\ndecomposition of the chance constraint\n\n27\n\nenables its efficient evaluation, as well as\nthe application of the branch and bound\nmethod. Branch and bound enables\nnon-convex problems to be solved efficiently to global optimality.\nConsidering the problem of finitehorizon robust optimal control of dynamic systems under Gaussian-distributed stochastic uncertainty, with state\nand control constraints, a discrete-time,\ncontinuous-state linear dynamics model\nis assumed. Gaussian-distributed stochastic uncertainty is a more natural model\nfor exogenous disturbances such as wind\n\n28\n\ngusts and turbulence than the previously\nstudied set-bounded models. However,\nwith stochastic uncertainty, it is often impossible to guarantee that state constraints are satisfied, because there is typically a non-zero probability of having a\ndisturbance that is large enough to push\nthe state out of the feasible region.\nAn effective framework to address robustness with stochastic uncertainty is\noptimization with chance constraints.\nThese require that the probability of violating the state constraints (i.e., the\nprobability of failure) is below a user-\n\nspecified bound known as the risk\nbound. An example problem is to drive\na car to a destination as fast as possible\nwhile limiting the probability of an accident to 10\xe2\x80\x937. This framework allows\nusers to trade conservatism against performance by choosing the risk bound.\nThe more risk the user accepts, the better performance they can expect.\nThis work was done by Lars James Blackmore of Caltech and Masahiro Ono and\nBrian Williams of MIT for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.
