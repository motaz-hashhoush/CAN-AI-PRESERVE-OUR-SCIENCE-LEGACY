The Data Relay System block diagram shows the interfaces.\n\nFIFO-Oriented,\nScheduled Bus Interface\nAdapter\n\n16 Bits\n156 MHz\n\n16 Bits\n156 MHz\n\nmain hardware elements of the data\nrelay system are the new data relay\nboard developed by Rockwell Scientific, a COTS Gigabit Ethernet board\nfor user interface, and a COTS Fibre\nChannel board that connects to local\nstorage. The boards reside in a cPCI\nback plane, and can be housed in a\nVME-type enclosure.\nA block diagram of the data relay system is shown in Figure 1. The data relay\nboard, shown in Figure 2, controls the\n\n8-Bit/10-Bit\nEncoder\n\nnel. The hardware implementation is\nbuilt on a network-processor-based architecture. This technology combines\nthe power of a hardware switch capable\nof data switching and packet routing at\nGbps rates, with the flexibility of a software-driven processor that can host\nhighly adaptive and reconfigurable protocols used, for example, in wireless\nlocal-area networks (LANs).\nThe system will be implemented in a\nmodular multi-board fashion. The\n\nNetwork\nProcessor\n\n5 Gbps\n\nGigabit Ethernet\n\nFiber Channel\nInterface Board (COTS)\n\n4 Gbps\n\n2 Gbps\nPCI Bus\n\nFree-Space Optical\n\nGigabit Ethernet\nInterface Board (COTS)\n\ncPCI Backplane\n\nData Relay Board\n\nParallel-toSerial\nConverter\n\n2.5 Gbps\n\n8-Bit/10-Bit\nDecoder\n\ncPCI Bus Backplane\n\nIn a free-space optical communication system, the mitigation of transient\noutages through the incorporation of\nerror-control methods is of particular\nconcern, the outages being caused by\nscintillation fades and obscurants. The\nfocus of this innovative technology is\nthe development of a data relay system\nfor a reliable high-data-rate free-spacebased optical-transport network. The\ndata relay boards will establish the link,\nmaintain synchronous connection,\ngroup the data into frames, and provide\nfor automatic retransmission (ARQ) of\nlost or erred frames. A certain Quality of\nService (QoS) can then be ensured,\ncompatible with the required data rate.\nThe protocol to be used by the data\nrelay system is based on the draft\nCCSDS standard data-link protocol\n\xe2\x80\x9cProximity-1,\xe2\x80\x9d selected by orbiters to\nmultiple lander assets in the Mars network, for example. In addition to providing data-link protocol capabilities for\nthe free-space optical link and buffering\nthe data, the data relay system will interface directly with user applications over\nGigabit Ethernet and/or with highspeed storage resources via Fibre Chan-\n\nSerial-to\nParallel\nConverter\n\n2.5 Gbps\n\nTransmitter\n(Laser)\n\nReceiver\n\nSDRAM\n256 MBytes\n\nData Relay Board\nFigure 2. A Data Relay Board would be installed in a free-space optical communication terminal to ensure a reliable high-speed data link. The board would\nregulate the flow of data between the user application and the optical transceiver.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\n5\n\ndata flow between the cPCI bus on the\none hand and the transmitter and receiver on the other hand once the freespace optical link has been established.\nThe data rates in transmission and reception need not be equal and could\neven differ by as much as several orders\nof magnitude. The data relay board\nwould contain a commercially available\nnetwork processor programmed to perform the primitive data handling function required by the protocol. Using a\nmemory buffer, the network processor\nwould accept, from the user application\nor storage through the cPCI bus, a\nstream of data to be transmitted to the\nlaser. The network processor would form\nthe data into appropriately sized frames\nwith headers and frame sequence information to identify frames for the ARQ\nprocess. The frames would then be sent\nto an interface adaptor for frame acqui-\n\nsition and synchronization. The interface adaptor would then format the data\ninto 16-bit words, add error check bits,\nand send the data to the serializer and\nencoder for transmission to the laser.\nAs successful receipt of frames is acknowledged using the free-space optical\nlink in the reverse direction, the corresponding data are cleared from the local\nmemory so that capacity for new streaming data is made available. In the event\nof missed or corrupted data frames, the\nnetwork processor will reconstruct and\nretransmit the data frames over the freespace optical link.\nOn the receiving side, the interface\nadapter will check for errors, while the\nnetwork processor will check for frames\nout of sequence. For each received\nframe, the network processor will generate the appropriate ARQ control\nframe and pass it to the reverse channel\n\nfree-space optical-link interface for\ntransmission.\nThis work was done by Malcolm Wright\nand Loren Clare of Caltech and Gary Gould\nand Maxim Pedyash of Rockwell Scientific\nCenter for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The software, called PlaqTrak, has been specifically used for analy-\n\nsis of plaque on teeth of patients. New algorithms have been developed and implemented to segment teeth of interest\nfrom surrounding gum, and a real-time\nimage-based morphing procedure is\nused to automatically overlay a grid onto\neach segmented tooth. Pattern recogni-\n\ntion methods are used to classify plaque\nfrom surrounding gum and enamel,\nwhile ignoring glare effects due to the reflection of camera light and ambient\nlight from enamel regions. The PlaqTrak\nsystem integrates these components into\na single software suite with an easy-to-use\n\nFigure 1. PlaqTrak System Utilities are showing some of the GUI tools.\n\n6\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 2.

These features offer distinct advantages over other\ncompeting systems that analyze groups of\nteeth or synthetic teeth. PlaqTrak divides\neach segmented tooth into eight regions\n\nusing an advanced graphics morphing\nprocedure [see results on a chipped\ntooth in Figure 2(b)], and a pattern\nrecognition classifier is then used to locate plaque [red regions in Figure 2(d)]\nand enamel regions. The morphing allows analysis within regions of teeth,\nthereby facilitating detailed statistical\nanalysis such as the amount of plaque\npresent on the biting surfaces on teeth.\nThis software system is applicable to a\nhost of biomedical applications, such as\ncell analysis and life detection, or robotic\napplications, such as product inspection\nor assembly of parts in space and industry.\nThis work was done by Ashit Talukder,\nJames Lambert, and Raymond Lam of Cal-\n\ntech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

By \xe2\x80\x9cprogrammable\xe2\x80\x9d is meant that a variety of\nspectral analyses can readily be performed and modified in software,\nfirmware, and/or electronic hardware,\nwithout need to change optical filters or\nother optical hardware of the associated\nspectrometers. The method is intended\nto enable real-time identification of single or multiple target chemical species\nin applications that involve highthroughput screening of multiple samples. Examples of such applications include (but are not limited to)\ncombinatorial chemistry, flow cytometry,\nbead assays, testing drugs, remote sensing, and identification of targets.\nThe basic concept of the proposed\nmethod is to perform real-time cross-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\ncorrelations of a measured spectrum\nwith one or more analytical function(s)\nof wavelength that could be, for example, the known spectra of target\nspecies. Assuming that measured spectral intensities are proportional to concentrations of target species plus background spectral intensities, then after\nsubtraction of background levels, it\nshould be possible to determine targetspecies concentrations from cross-correlation values. Of course, the problem\nof determining the concentrations is\nmore complex when spectra of different species overlap, but the problem\ncan be solved by use of multiple analytical functions in combination with\ncomputational techniques that have\nbeen developed previously for analyses\nof this type.\nThe method is applicable to the design and operation of a spectrometer in\nwhich spectrally dispersed light is mea-\n\nsured by means of an active-pixel sensor\n(APS) array. The row or column dimension of such an array is generally chosen to be aligned along the spectral-dispersion dimension, so that each pixel\nintercepts light in a narrow spectral\nband centered on a wavelength that is a\nknown function of the pixel position.\nThe proposed method admits of two\nhardware implementations for computing cross-correlations in real time.\nOne hardware implementation would\nexploit programmable circuitry within\neach pixel of an APS array. The analog\nspectral-intensity reading of the photodetector in each pixel would be multiplied by a gain proportional to value of\nthe analytical function for the wavelength that corresponds to the pixel position. As a result, the output from each\npixel would be proportional to contribution of the pixel to the cross-correlation (plus background). The outputs of\n\n7\n\nall the pixels along the spectral-dispersion dimension would be summed to\nobtain the value of the cross-correlation\n(plus background).\nSuch on-chip cross-correlation could\nbe performed rapidly because the analytical function could be statically programmed into the APS array and the\nmultiplications could be done simultaneously or nearly so. All of the additions could be done simultaneously by\nmeans of a single binning instruction.\nThe charge wells of all the pixels could\nbe connected simultaneously, collecting all the charge outputs from multiplication operations into one \xe2\x80\x9csuperpixel,\xe2\x80\x9d the single readout value of\nwhich would constitute the cross-correlation value for the given analytical\nfunction. For an instrument in which\nthe APS rows were aligned along the\nspectral-dispersion dimension and in\nwhich the image of a spectrograph slit\nwas aligned along the pixel columns\nand spanned multiple pixel rows, it\n\nwould be possible to perform simultaneous cross-correlations for multiple\ntarget species by applying, to each pixel\nrow, the analytical function corresponding to one of the target species. A separate readout would be needed for each\ntarget species.\nIn the other hardware implementation, cross-correlations would be computed externally to the APS array. The\nmultiplications and additions would be\nperformed in pipeline fashion. If the\nAPS-array outputs were analog, then\nprogrammable analog signals representing the analytical functions would\nbe synthesized in phase with the corresponding stream of analog APS-array\noutputs and the multiplications and additions would be performed by relatively inexpensive, commercially available analog mixing and filtering\ncircuits, respectively. If the APS-array\noutputs were digital, the cross-correlations could be computed by a digital\nsignal processor. Ordinarily, the analog\n\napproach would be preferable because\nthe analog operations can be performed much more rapidly than can\nthe corresponding digital multiplications and additions.\nThis work was done by Gregory Bearman,\nMichael Pelletier, and Suresh Seshadri of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The\nsystem has been designed to enable efficient use of limited communication resources by transmitting the data likely to\nhave the most scientific value. This software operates onboard a rover by analyzing collected data, identifying potential scientific targets, and then using\nthat information to prioritize data for\ntransmission to Earth. Currently, the system is focused on the analysis of acquired images, although the general\ntechniques are applicable to a wide\nrange of data modalities. Image prioritization is performed using two main\n\nsteps. In the first step, the software detects features of interest from each\nimage. In its current application, the\nsystem is focused on visual properties of\nrocks. Thus, rocks are located in each\nimage and rock properties, such as\nshape, texture, and albedo, are extracted from the identified rocks. In the\nsecond step, the features extracted from\na group of images are used to prioritize\nthe images using three different methods: (1) identification of key target signature (finding specific rock features\nthe scientist has identified as important), (2) novelty detection (finding\nrocks we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen before), and (3)\nrepresentative rock sampling (finding\n\nthe most average sample of each rock\ntype). These methods use techniques\nsuch as K-means unsupervised clustering and a discrimination-based kernel\nclassifier to rank images based on their\ninterest level.\nThis program was written by Rebecca Castano, Robert Anderson, Tara Estlin, Dennis DeCoste, Daniel Gaines, Dominic Mazzoni, Forest\nFisher, and Michele Judd of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

Refer to NPO-40265.\n\nDetermining Sizes of Particles in a Flow From DPIV Data\nThe same equipment would be used to measure sizes as well as velocities.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA proposed method of measuring the\nsize of particles entrained in a flow of a\nliquid or gas would involve utilization of\ndata from digital particle-image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow. That is to\nsay, with proper design and operation of\n\n8\n\na DPIV system, the DPIV data could be\nprocessed according to the proposed\nmethod to obtain particle sizes in addition to particle velocities. As an additional benefit, one could then compute\nthe mass flux of the entrained particles\n\nfrom the particle sizes and velocities.\nAs in DPIV as practiced heretofore, a\npulsed laser beam would be formed into\na thin sheet to illuminate a plane of interest in a flow field and the illuminated\nplane would be observed by means of a\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\nRead in 12-bit image file.\n\nApply global threshold\nto eliminate image noise.\n\nScan image for nonzero\npixels and group nonzero\nneighbors into images of\nparticles.\n\nDetermine glare-spot\npositions and calculate\nparticle diameters.\n\nCalculate positions of\nparticles, the distribution of\nparticle sizes, and the\nmean and standard\ndeviation of particle sizes.\n\nThe Algorithm of the Proposed Method would\nprocess DPIV data to extract information on particle sizes. The size information would be in addition to the velocity information extracted\nfrom the data by use of previously developed\nDPIV software.\n\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) camera\naimed along a line perpendicular to the\nilluminated plane. Unlike in DPIV as\npracticed heretofore, care would be\ntaken to polarize the laser beam so that\nits electric field would lie in the illuminated plane, for the reason explained in\nthe next paragraph.\n\nThe proposed method applies, more\nspecifically, to transparent or semitransparent spherical particles that have an\nindex of refraction different from that of\nthe fluid in which they are entrained.\nThe method is based on the established\nMie theory, which describes the scattering of light by diffraction, refraction, and\nspecular reflection of light by such particles. In the case of a particle illuminated\nby polarized light and observed in the\narrangement described in the preceding\nparagraph, the Mie theory shows that the\nimage of the particle on the focal plane\nof the CCD camera includes two glare\nspots: one attributable to light reflected\ntoward the camera and one attributable\nto light refracted toward the camera.\nThe distance between the glare spots is a\nknown function of the size of the particle, the indices of refraction of the particle material, and design parameters of\nthe camera optics. Hence, the size of a\nparticle can be determined from the distance between the glare spots.\nThe proposed method would be implemented in an algorithm that would\nautomatically identify, and measure the\ndistance between, the glare spots for\neach particle for which a suitable image\nhas been captured in a DPIV image\nframe. The algorithm (see figure)\nwould begin with thresholding of data\nfrom the entire image frame to reduce\nnoise, thereby facilitating discrimination of particle images from the background and aiding in the separation of\noverlapping particles. It is important\nnot to pick a threshold level so high\nthat the light intensity between a given\npair of glare spots does not fall below\nthe threshold value, leaving the glare\nspots disconnected.\nThe image would then be scanned in a\nsequence of rows and columns of pixels\nto identify groups of adjacent pixels that\ncontain nonzero brightnesses and that\n\nare surrounded by pixels of zero brightness. Each such group would be assumed\nto constitute the image of one particle.\nEach such group would be further analyzed to determine whether the image\nwas saturated; saturated particle images\nmust be rejected because the locations of\nglare spots in saturated images cannot\naccurately be determined. Within each\nunsaturated particle image, the centroids (deemed to be the locations) of\nthe glare spots would be determined by\nmeans of gradients of brightness distributions and three-point horizontal and\nthree-point vertical Gaussian estimates\nbased on the brightness values of the\nbrightest pixels and the pixels adjacent\nto them. If the brightness of a given particle image contained only one peak,\nthen it would be assumed that a second\nglare spot did not exist and that image\nwould be rejected.\nOnce the centroids had been estimated for all particle images for which\nit was possible to do so, the positions of\nthe particles and the distances between\ntheir centroids would be computed. As\ndescribed above, the size of each particle would then be computed from the\ndistance between its centroids. Finally,\nthe distribution, mean, and standard\ndeviation of sizes would be computed\nfor the collection of particle images\nthat survived to the final stage of the\ncentroid-estimation process.\nThis work was done by M.

The present method involves\nan angular-spectrum-based phase-ex-\n\ntrapolation approximation in which\neach data point is associated with a\nplane-wave component that propagates in a unique direction from the\norbit of the receiving satellite to intersect a straight line tangent to the orbit\nat a nearby point. This approximation\nenables the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which apply only to data\n\n9\n\ncollected along a straight-line trajectory.

[An SEU is a spurious bit\nflip (also called a soft error) caused by a\nsingle impact of ionizing radiation.] The\narchitecture would also enable recovery\nfrom some soft errors caused by electrical transients and, to some extent, from\nintermittent and permanent (hard) errors caused by aging of electronic components.\nA typical FPGA of the current generation contains one or more complete\nprocessor cores, memories, and highspeed serial input/output (I/O) channels, making it possible to shrink a\nboard-level processor node to a single\nintegrated-circuit chip. Custom, highly\nefficient microcontrollers, general-purpose computers, custom I/O processors,\nand signal processors can be rapidly and\nefficiently implemented by use of\nFPGAs. Unfortunately, FPGAs are susceptible to SEUs. Prior efforts to mitigate the effects of SEUs have yielded solutions that degrade performance of the\nsystem and require support from external hardware and software.\nIn comparison with other fault-tolerant-computing architectures (e.g., triple\nmodular redundancy), the proposed architecture could be implemented with\nless circuitry and lower power demand.\nMoreover, the fault-tolerant computing\nfunctions would require only minimal\nsupport from circuitry outside the central processing units (CPUs) of computers, would not require any software support, and would be largely transparent\nto software and to other computer hardware.\nThere would be two types of modules:\na self-checking processor module and a\nmemory system (see figure). The selfchecking processor module would be\nimplemented on a single FPGA and\nwould be capable of detecting its own\ninternal errors. It would contain two\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\nMemory System\nSave/Restore\nSelf-Checking\nProcessor Module\n\nMain Memory\n\nCPS\n\nRecovery\nCache\n\nRegisters, Etc.\nError Detected\n\nThe Memory System would store the states of computations at checkpoint intervals. Upon detection\nof an error in the self-checking processor module, the memory system would provide the information\nneeded to roll back the computations to the immediately preceding checkpoint.\n\nCPUs executing identical programs in\nlock step, with comparison of their outputs to detect errors. It would also contain various cache local memory circuits, communication circuits, and\nconfigurable special-purpose processors\nthat would use self-checking checkers.\n(The basic principle of the self-checking\nchecker method is to utilize logic circuitry that generates error signals whenever there is an error in either the\nchecker or the circuit being checked.)\nThe memory system would comprise a\nmain memory and a hardware-controlled check-pointing system (CPS)\nbased on a buffer memory denoted the\nrecovery cache. The main memory\nwould contain random-access memory\n(RAM) chips and FPGAs that would, in\naddition to everything else, implement\ndouble-error-detecting and single-errorcorrecting memory functions to enable\nrecovery from single-bit errors.\nThe main purpose served by the\nmemory system as a whole would be to\nenable the computer to return to a valid\nstate \xe2\x80\x94 a known good point reached in\nthe computations before the occurrence of a detected error. In operation,\nthe checkers in the self-checking\nprocessor module would signal errors to\nthe memory system. Recovery would involve halting the operation of the selfchecking processor module, correcting\nits configuration bits if necessary, reloading its registers, and returning control to a previous, known good point in\nthe program. The CPUs could then resume correct computations.\n\nThe known good point in the computations would be provided by the CPS in\na procedure denoted, variously, as checkpointing and checkpoint recovery or\ncheckpoint rollback. The CPS would periodically command each CPU to store\nthe contents of its registers in the recovery cache and clear its caches. This action would establish a checkpoint. Then\nthe original value and the address of any\nclean RAM block that was subsequently\noverwritten by the CPU would be stored\nin a special RAM within the recovery\ncache. Subsequent writes to that block\nwould be carried out normally (that is,\nwithout intervention by the recovery\ncache). If an error in the CPU were detected, the data in the special recoverycache RAM could be used to restore the\ncorresponding data in the main memory\nto their prior correct values, the processor configuration would be reloaded, the\ncaches in the processor module would be\ncleared, and the processor registers restored to their prior values.\nA new checkpoint could be ordered\nwhen the recovery cache became filled to\ncapacity. Alternately, checkpoints could\nbe forced at strategic points in the software. Another alternative would be to\nforce checkpoints periodically, at intervals short enough to ensure that rollback\ntime did not exceed a value that could be\nspecified by design.\nThis work was done by Raphael Some and\nDavid Rennels of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

This circuit computes the autocorrelations of, and the cross-correlations\namong, data in four digital input streams\nrepresenting samples of in-phase (I) and\nquadrature (Q) components of two intermediate-frequency (IF) signals, denoted A\nand B, that are generated in heterodyne reception of two microwave signals.\nThe IF signals arriving at the correlator\ninput terminals have been digitized to\nthree levels (-1,0,1) at a sampling rate up to\n500 MHz. Two bits (representing sign and\nmagnitude) are needed to represent the\ninstantaneous datum in each input channel; hence, eight bits are needed to represent the four input signals during any given\ncycle of the sampling clock. The accumulation (integration) time for the correlation is programmable in increments of 28\ncycles of the sampling clock, up to a maximum of 224 cycles.\nThe basic functionality of the correlator is embodied in 16 correlation slices,\neach of which contains identical logic circuits and counters (see figure). The first\nstage of each correlation slice is a logic\ngate that computes one of the desired correlations (for example, the autocorrelation of the I component of A or the negative of the cross-correlation of the I\ncomponent of A and the Q component of\nB). The sampling of the output of the\nlogic gate output is controlled by the sampling-clock signal, and an 8-bit counter increments in every clock cycle when the\n\nA\n8-Bit Counter\n\n16-Bit Counter\n\n16-Bit Buffer\n\nData Out\n16\n\nB\nClock \xc3\xb7 28\nClock\n\nA Correlation Slice is one of 16 identical units that embody the basic functionality of the high-speed,\nultralow-power digital correlator.\n\nlogic gate generates output. The most significant bit of the 8-bit counter is sampled\nby a 16-bit counter with a clock signal at 2 8\nthe frequency of the sampling clock.\nThe 16-bit counter is incremented every\ntime the 8-bit counter rolls over.\nThe correlator is designed for use with\na microprocessor. The microprocessor\ncontrols the function of the correlator,\nsets the desired integration time by writing appropriate values to registers in the\ncorrelator, and reads the correlation outputs as described next. At the end of the\nintegration period, the contents of the\n16-bit counter are copied to a 16-bit\nbuffer, and the 16-bit counter is cleared\nto begin a new accumulation cycle. At\nthe same time, the correlator generates a\nsignal to indicate, to the microprocessor,\nthat new correlation data are available.\nThe correlator and the microprocessor\ncommunicate via a simple 3.3-V bus-oriented interface, such that from the perspective of the microprocessor, the correlator acts much like a small\nrandom-access memory containing 32\n\n16-bit words. Hence, the microprocessor\nreads the correlation-slice buffers by supplying five-bit addresses to select the\nbuffers as a group of memory locations.\nThe correlator has been implemented as a complementary metal\noxide/semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit, following 0.35-\xc2\xb5m radiation tolerant design rules. The main advantage of this high-speed digital\ncorrelator over prior ones is ultralowpower dissipation: whereas a previous\nhigh-speed digital correlator dissipates a\npower of about 10 W (and processes only\ntwo input data streams), this correlator\ndissipates a power of 2 mW or less, the\nexact value depending on the sampling\nrate. To achieve such ultralow-power\noperation a logic level of only 0.5 V is\nused, necessitating the use of special\nsignal-conditioning circuits.\nThis work was done by Jeffrey R. Piepmeier of\nGoddard Space Flight Center and K. Joseph\nHass of the University of Idaho.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA simple alternative technique has\nbeen devised protecting delicate equipment against electrostatic discharge\n(ESD) in settings in which workers wear\ncommunication headsets. In the original\nsetting in which the technique was devised, the workers who wear the headsets\nalso wear anti-ESD grounding straps on\ntheir wrists. The alternative technique\neliminates the need for the wrist grounding straps by providing for grounding\nthrough the headsets. In place of the\nelectrically insulating foam pads on the\n\n12\n\nheadsets, one installs pads made of electrically conductive foam like that commonly used to protect electronic components. Grounding wires are attached to\nthe conductive foam pads, then possibly\nto the shielding cable which may be\ngrounded to the backshell on the connector. The efficacy of this technique in\nprotecting against ESD has been verified\nin experiments. The electrical resistance\nof the pads is a few megohms \xe2\x80\x94 about\nthe same as that of a human body between the fingers of opposite hands and,\n\nhence, low enough for grounding. The\nonly drawback of the technique is that\ncare must be taken to place the foam\npads in contact with the user\xe2\x80\x99s skin: any\nhair that comes between the foam pads\nand the skin must be pushed aside because hair is electrically insulating and\nthus prevents adequate grounding.\nThis work was done by John Peters and\nRobert C. Youngquist of Kennedy Space\nCenter. For further information, contact the\nKennedy Commercial Technology Office at\n321-867-1463.

The structural-support\ncomponents of the improved cells and\nstacks can be made of relatively inexpensive plastics. Moreover, in comparison with conventional bipolar fuel-cell\nstacks, the improved fuel-cell stacks can\nbe assembled, disassembled, and diagnosed for malfunctions more easily.\nThese improvements are expected to\nbring portable direct methanol fuel\ncells and stacks closer to commercialization.\nIn a conventional bipolar fuel-cell\nstack, the cells are interspersed with\nbipolar plates (also called biplates),\nwhich are structural components that\nserve to interconnect the cells and distribute the reactants (methanol and\nair). The cells and biplates are sandwiched between metal end plates. Usually, the stack is held together under\npressure by tie rods that clamp the end\nplates. The bipolar stack configuration\noffers the advantage of very low internal\nelectrical resistance. However, when the\npower output of a stack is only a few\nwatts, the very low internal resistance of\na bipolar stack is not absolutely necessary for keeping the internal power loss\nacceptably low.\nTypically, about 80 percent of the\nmass of a conventional bipolar fuel-cell\nstack resides in the biplates, end plates,\nand tie rods. The biplates are usually\nmade of graphite composites and must\nbe molded or machined to contain\nflow channels, at a cost that is usually a\nmajor part of the total cost of the stack.\nIn the event of a malfunction in one\ncell, it is necessary to disassemble the\nentire stack in order to be able to diagnose that cell. What is needed is a design that reduces the mass of the stack,\ndoes not require high pressure to ensure sealing, is more amenable to troubleshooting, and reduces the cost of\nmanufacture.\nThe present improved design satisfies these needs and is especially suitable for applications in which the\npower demand is \xe2\x89\xa420 W. This design\neliminates the biplates, end plates, and\ntie rods. In this design, the basic build-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\ning block of a stack is a sealed unit that\ncontains an anode plate, two cathode\nplates, and two back-to-back cells (see\nfigure).

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nWhile exploring ways of producing\nbetter fuels for propulsion of a spacecraft on the Mars sample return mission,\na researcher at Johnson Space Center\n(JSC) devised a way of blending fuel by\ncombining methane or natural gas with\na second fuel to produce a fuel that can\nbe maintained in liquid form at ambient\ntemperature and under moderate pressure. The use of such a blended fuel\nwould be a departure for both spacecraft\nengines and terrestrial internal combustion engines. For spacecraft, it would enable reduction of weights on long\nflights. For the automotive industry on\nEarth, such a fuel could be easily distributed and could be a less expensive, more\nefficient, and cleaner-burning alternative to conventional fossil fuels.\nThe concept of blending fuels is not\nnew: for example, the production of\ngasoline includes the addition of liquid\noctane enhancers. For the future, it has\nbeen commonly suggested to substitute\nmethane or compressed natural gas for\noctane-enhanced gasoline as a fuel for\ninternal-combustion engines. Unfortunately, methane or natural gas must be\nstored either as a compressed gas (if kept\nat ambient temperature) or as a cryogenic liquid. The ranges of automobiles\nwould be reduced from their present val-\n\nues because of limitations on the capacities for storage of these fuels. Moreover,\ntechnical challenges are posed by the\nneed to develop equipment to handle\nthese fuels and, especially, to fill tanks acceptably rapidly. The JSC alternative \xe2\x80\x94\nto provide a blended fuel that can be\nmaintained in liquid form at moderate\npressure at ambient temperature \xe2\x80\x94 has\nnot been previously tried.\nA blended automotive fuel according\nto this approach would be made by dissolving natural gas in gasoline. The autogenous pressure of this fuel would eliminate the need for a vehicle fuel pump,\nbut a pressure and/or flow regulator\nwould be needed to moderate the effects\nof temperature and to respond to changing engine power demands. Because the\nfuel would flash as it entered engine\ncylinders, relative to gasoline, it would\ndisperse more readily and therefore\nwould mix with air more nearly completely. As a consequence, this fuel would\nburn more nearly completely (and,\nhence, more cleanly) than gasoline does.\nThe storage density of this fuel would\nbe similar to that of gasoline, but its energy density would be such that the\nmileage (more precisely, the distance\ntraveled per unit volume of fuel) would\nbe greater than that of either gasoline or\n\ncompressed natural gas. Because the\npressure needed to maintain the fuel in\nliquid form would be more nearly constant and generally lower than that\nneeded to maintain compressed natural\ngas in liquid form, the pressure rating of\na tank used to hold this fuel could be\nlower than that of a tank used to hold\ncompressed natural gas.\nA mixture of natural gas and gasoline\ncould be distributed more easily than\ncould some alternative fuels. A massive\ninvestment in new equipment would not\nbe necessary: One could utilize the present fuel-distribution infrastructure and\ncould blend the gasoline and natural gas\nat almost any place in the production or\ndistribution process \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps even at\nthe retail fuel pump. Yet another advantage afforded by use of a blend of gasoline and natural gas would be a reduction in the amount of gasoline consumed.\nBecause natural gas costs less than gasoline does and is in abundant supply in\nthe United States, the cost of automotive\nfuel and the demand for imported oil\ncould be reduced.\nThis work was done by Thomas A.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe fluid bubble eliminator (FBE) is a\ndevice that removes gas bubbles from a\nflowing liquid. The FBE contains no\nmoving parts and does not require any\npower input beyond that needed to\npump the liquid. In the FBE, the buoyant force for separating the gas from the\nliquid is provided by a radial pressure\ngradient associated with a centrifugal\nflow of the liquid and any entrained\nbubbles. A device based on a similar\nprinciple is described in \xe2\x80\x9cCentrifugal\nAdsorption Cartridge System\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC22863), which appears on page 48 of this\nissue. The FBE was originally intended\nfor use in filtering bubbles out of a liquid flowing relatively slowly in a bioreactor system in microgravity. Versions that\noperate in normal Earth gravitation at\ngreater flow speeds may also be feasible.\nThe FBE (see figure) is constructed as a\ncartridge that includes two concentric\ncylinders with flanges at the ends. The\nouter cylinder is an impermeable housing;\nthe inner cylinder comprises a gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane covering a perforated inner tube. Multiple\nspiral disks that collectively constitute a\nspiral ramp are mounted in the space between the inner and outer cylinders.\nThe liquid enters the FBE through an\nend flange, flows in the annular space between the cylinders, and leaves through\nthe opposite end flange. The spiral disks\nchannel the liquid into a spiral flow, the\ncircumferential component of which\ngives rise to the desired centrifugal effect.\nThe resulting radial pressure gradient\nforces the bubbles radially inward; that is,\n\nOuter Cylinder\nSpiral Disks\nFlange\n\nFlange\n\nLiquid Out\n\nVented Gas\n\nLiquid In\n\nInner Cylinder: Membrane on Perforated Inner Tube\n\nThe Spiral Disks Channel the Liquid into a spiral flow, which gives rise to a pressure gradient that\ndrives bubbles toward the inner cylinder.\n\ntoward the inner cylinder. At the inner\ncylinder, the gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane allows the bubbles to\nenter the perforated inner tube while\nkeeping the liquid in the space between\nthe inner and outer cylinders. The gas\nthus collected can be vented via an endflange connection to the inner tube.\nThe centripetal acceleration (and thus\nthe radial pressure gradient) is approximately proportional to the square of the\nflow speed and approximately inversely\nproportional to an effective radius of the\nannular space. For a given FBE geometry,\none could increase the maximum rate at\nwhich gas could be removed by increasing\nthe rate of flow to obtain more centripetal\nacceleration. In experiments and calculations oriented toward the original micro-\n\ngravitational application, centripetal accelerations between 0.001 and 0.012 g [where\ng \xe2\x89\xa1 normal Earth gravitation (\xe2\x89\x889.8 m/s2)]\nwere considered. For operation in normal\nEarth gravitation, it would likely be necessary to choose the FBE geometry and the\nrate of flow to obtain centripetal acceleration comparable to or greater than g.\nThis work was done by Steve R.

Such a vehicle\nwould act as an atmospheric decelerator\nat supersonic speed in the upper atmosphere, and a smaller, central astronaut\n\npod could then separate at lower altitudes\nand parachute separately to Earth.\nAstronaut-rescue systems that have\nbeen considered previously have been\nmassive, and the cost of designing them\nhas exceeded the cost of fabrication of a\n\n19\n\nPBO Fabric Ballutes\nDiameter 40 m\n\nCapsule\n\nZipper Entrances\n\nFlexible Insulation\n\n30 m\nCapsule\nAft Cover (PBO)\nRadiation Shield\n\nTorus Inflated to >1 Bar\nTo Maintain Shape\n\nForward Cover (PBO)\n(Note: To simplify illustration, the shapes are not to scale.)\n\nA Spherical Ballute (upper) and a Lens-Shaped Ballute (lower) have been considered for inflatable\nemergency atmospheric-entry vehicles.\n\nspace shuttle. In contrast, an inflatable\nemergency-landing vehicle according to\nthe proposal would have a mass between\n100 and 200 kg, could be stored in a volume of approximately 0.2 to 0.4 m3, and\ncould likely be designed and built much\nless expensively.\nWhen fully inflated, the escape vehicle behaves as a large balloon parachute, or ballute. Due to very low massper-surface area, a large radius, and a\nlarge coefficient of drag, ballutes decelerate at much higher altitudes and with\n\nmuch lower heating rates than the space\nshuttle. Although the space shuttle atmospheric reentry results in surface\ntemperatures of about 1,600 oC, ballutes\ncan be designed for maximum temperatures below 600 oC. This allows ballutes\nto be fabricated with lightweight\nZYLON\xc2\xae, or polybenzoxazole (PBO), or\nequivalent.\nTwo preliminary cocoon ballute\n\xe2\x80\x9clifeboat\xe2\x80\x9d concepts are shown in the figures. The cocoon portion of the vehicle\nwould be, more specifically, a capsule\n\npressurized to 1 bar (0.1 MPa \xe2\x80\x94 approximately 1 standard atmosphere).\nCrewmembers would enter the cocoon\npod and then zip it shut. The spacecraft\nwould be placed on a reentry trajectory,\nand the inflated cocoon with deflated\nballute would be ejected.\nOnce the vehicle was safely away from\nthe spacecraft, the entire ballute would\nbe inflated. For this inflation at high altitude, the ballute would be pressurized to\nabout 0.01 bar (1 kPa). As low as this pressure is, it is at least ten times the expected\ndynamic pressure on the vehicle during\nthe heating portion of very high atmospheric reentry, and hence it is sufficient\nto enable the ballute to retain its shape.\nFrom thermal reentry heating analyses\nperformed at JPL, the diameter of the inflated ballute would be made large\nenough (30 to 40 m) to limit the maximum temperature to about 500 oC \xe2\x80\x94\nsafely below the 600 oC limit for PBO, or\nequivalent.\nThe spherical ballute shown in the upper\nfigure would have a mass of about 200 kg\nfor a seven-astronaut rescue mission, while\nthe lens-shaped ballute in the lower figure\nhas been further improved by reducing the\noverall mass required and increasing the\ncoefficient of drag. To maintain stability,\nthe center of mass of both concepts must\nbe kept low, and spin stabilization may be\nnecessary.\nThis work was done by Jack Jones, Jeffrey\nHall, and Jiunn Jeng Wu of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In this case, the panel is\nhexagonal and supports disks that represent segments of a primary mirror of a\nlarge telescope. The lower part of Figure\n1 shows a complete conceptual structure\ncontaining multiple hexagonal panels\nthat hold mirror segments.\nThe structures of this class are of the\ntensegrity type, which was invented five\ndecades ago by artist Kenneth Snelson. A\n\n20\n\ntensegrity structure consists of momentfree compression members (struts) and\ntension members (cables). The structures\nof this particular developmental class are\nintended primarily as means to erect large\nsegmented primary mirrors of astronomical telescopes or large radio antennas in\nouter space. Other classes of tensegrity\nstructures could also be designed for terrestrial use as towers, masts, and supports\nfor general structural panels.\nAn important product of the present\ndevelopment effort is the engineering\npractice of building a lightweight, de-\n\nployable structure as an assembly of\ntensegrity modules like the one shown\nin Figure 2. This module comprises two\noctahedral tensegrity subunits that are\nmirror images of each other joined at\ntheir plane of mirror symmetry. In this\ncase, the plane of mirror symmetry is\nboth the upper plane of the lower subunit and the lower plane of the upper\nsubunit, and is delineated by the midheight triangle in Figure 2.

Force and moment loadings other than simple axial compression produce only second-order deformations through strains in the struts and\ncables.\nSimple algebraic expressions have been\nderived to describe the deformations,\nunder load, of multimodule platelike and\nmast structures, thereby making it possible\n\nto design such structures without need for\ncomputers. Perhaps the most important\nrules for designing a tensegrity structure\nare that (1) the lengths of the struts and cables are critical and they determine the unloaded shape of the structure, but that (2)\nthe preloads (discussed in the next paragraph) in the cables and struts determine\nthe degree of rigidity under external load.\nTo make a module stowable, it is necessary to provide for disconnection of\nthe ends of many of the struts and/or\nmake the struts collapsible (e.g., telescoping). To make a module deployable,\none must provide means to reconnect\nthe struts if disconnected and re-extend\nthem if collapsed. The means of deployment must include means to apply the\nrequired preloads to the cables and\nstruts. In cases of manual stowage and\ndeployment, such means can include\ntoggles and turnbuckles. For automated\ndeployment, more sophisticated means\nare needed. In the structure of Figure 2,\nthe struts are telescoping piston/cylinder units that are extended pneumatically and locked at full extension by\nspring-loaded mechanisms.\nThis work was done by Glenn W.

The technique uses bucky\npaper as a support material for retinal\npigment epithelial (RPE) cells, iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cells, and/or stem\ncells. This technology is envisioned as a\ntreatment for age-related macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of\nblindness in persons over age 65 in Western nations. Additionally, patients with\nother retinal degenerative disorders,\nsuch as retinitis pigmentosa, may be\ntreated by this strategy.\nBucky paper is a mesh of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as shown in Figure 1,\nthat can be made from any of the commercial sources of CNTs. Bucky paper is\nbiocompatible and capable of supporting the growth of biological cells. Because bucky paper is highly porous, nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and\nwaste can readily diffuse through it.\nThe thickness, density, and porosity of\nbucky paper can be tailored in manufacturing. For transplantation of cells\ninto the retina, bucky paper serves simultaneously as a substrate for cell\ngrowth and as a barrier for new blood\nvessel formation, which can be a problem in the exudative type of macular\ndegeneration.\nBucky paper is easily handled during surgical implantation into the eye.\nThrough appropriate choice of manufacturing processes, bucky paper can\n\nbe made relatively rigid yet able to\nconform to the retina when the bucky\npaper is implanted.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn an ongoing development project,\nmicroscopic bubbles in extravascular tissue in a human body will be detected by\nuse of an enhanced version of the apparatus described in \xe2\x80\x9cUltrasonic BubbleSizing Instrument\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC-22980), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 24, No. 10 (October\n2000), page 62. To recapitulate: The\nphysical basis of the instrument is the\nuse of ultrasound to excite and measure\nthe resonant behavior (oscillatory expansion and contraction) of bubbles.\nThe resonant behavior is a function of\nthe bubble diameter; the instrument exploits the diameter dependence of the\nresonance frequency and the general\nnonlinearity of the ultrasonic response\nof bubbles to detect bubbles and potentially measure their diameters.\nIn the cited prior article, the application given most prominent mention was\nthe measurement of gaseous emboli (es-\n\n26\n\nsentially, gas bubbles in blood vessels)\nthat cause decompression sickness and\ncomplications associated with cardiopulmonary surgery. According to the\npresent proposal, the instrument capabilities would be extended to measure\nextravascular bubbles with diameters in\nthe approximate range of 1 to 30 \xc2\xb5m.\nThe proposed use of the instrument\ncould contribute further to the understanding and prevention of decompression sickness: There is evidence that suggests that prebreathing oxygen greatly\nreduces the risk of decompression sickness by reducing the number of microscopic extravascular bubbles. By using\nthe ultrasonic bubble-sizing instrument\nto detect and/or measure the sizes of\nsuch bubbles, it might be possible to predict the risk of decompression sickness.\nThe instrument also has potential as a\ntool to guide the oxygen-prebreathing\n\nschedules of astronauts; high-altitude\naviators; individuals who undertake\nhigh-altitude, low-opening (HALO)\nparachute jumps; and others at risk of\ndecompression sickness.

Coronagraphic notch filters could offer alternatives to both (1) the large and expensive\ndouble or triple monochromators in older\nRaman spectrometers and (2) holographic notch filters, which are less expensive but are subject to environmental\ndegradation as well as to limitations of\ngeometry and spectral range.\nMeasurement of a Raman spectrum is an\nexercise in measuring and resolving faint\nspectral lines close to a bright peak: In\nRaman spectroscopy, a monochromatic\nbeam of light (the pump beam) excites a\nsample of material that one seeks to analyze. The pump beam generates a small\nflux of scattered light at wavelengths slightly\ngreater than that of the pump beam. The\nshift in wavelength of the scattered light\nfrom the pump wavelength is known in the\nart as the Stokes shift. Typically, the flux of\nscattered light is of the order of 10\xe2\x80\x937\xc3\x97 that\nof the pump beam and the Stokes shift lies\nin the wave-number range of 100 to 3,000\ncm\xe2\x80\x931. A notch filter can be used to suppress\nthe pump-beam spectral peak while passing\nthe nearby faint Raman spectral lines.\n\nThe basic principles of design and operation of a coronagraph offer an opportunity for engineering the spectral transmittance of the optics in a Raman\nspectrometer. A classical coronagraph\nmay be understood as two imaging systems placed end to end, such that the first\nsystem forms an intermediate real image\nof a nominally infinitely distant object and\nthe second system forms a final real image\nof the intermediate real image. If the light\nincident on the first telescope is collimated, then the intermediate image is a\npoint-spread function (PSF). If an appropriately tailored occulting spot (e.g., a\nGaussian-apodized spot with maximum\nabsorption on axis) is placed on the intermediate image plane, then the instrument inhibits transmission of light from\nan on-axis source. However, the PSFs of\noff-axis light sources are formed off axis\n\xe2\x80\x94 that is, away from the occulting spot \xe2\x80\x94\nso that they become refocused onto the\nfinal image plane.\nA properly designed coronagraph utilizes the diffraction from the intermediate\nocculting spot. In the exit-pupil plane, this\ndiffraction forms a well-defined ring\nimage in the vicinity of the geometric\n\nimage of the exit pupil. By placing an\naperture stop sized to block the passage of\nthe diffracted light (such an aperture is\nknown in the art as a Lyot stop) in the exitpupil plane, it is possible, in principle, to\nobtain an extremely high rejection ratio.\nWhile coronagraphs are not new, recent developments make it possible to enhance performance. One such development is that of the ability to write arbitrary\nabsorption patterns on occulting spots at\nsubmicron resolution by use of electronbeam lithography. Another such development is that of superpolished optics.\nOne characteristic of a classical coronagraph essential to the proposed notch filter is that within the narrow typical\nRaman spectral range associated with a\ngiven pump laser line, the size of the PSF\nchanges little with wavelength. However,\nthe position of the PSF (in particular, its\ndisplacement from the occulting spot)\ncan be made to vary considerably with\nwavelength by introducing a diffraction\ngrating or other dispersive element into\nthe optical train. Hence, one could obtain\nan extraordinarily sharp notch in the\nspectral transmittance of a coronagraphic\nfilter by designing the dispersive element\n\nIncoming Light\n\nOcculter\nPlane\nAperture\n\nAir-Spaced\nDoublet Lens\n\nSpherical-Surface\nDoublet Lens\n\nFlat\nSteering\nMirror\nDiffraction\nGrating\nLyot Stop\n\nFinal Image Plane\n(Detector Plane)\n\nA Coronagraphic Filter would include a modified coronagraph equipped with a diffraction grating and other components. The modification would be such\nas to optimize the functioning of the resulting instrument as a narrowband rejection (notch) filter.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\n27\n\nand the other coronagraphic optics so\nthat at the pump wavelength, the PSF is\ncentered on the occulting spot.\nThe figure shows the optical layout according to one possible design of the proposed coronagraphic filter for a pump\nwavelength of 550 nm. The dispersive element would be a 500-line-per-millimeter\ndiffraction grating, of which the firstorder diffraction would be utilized. After\npassing through an aperture, the incoming light would strike the grating, followed by a flat steering mirror. An air-\n\nspaced doublet lens incorporating an aspherical element would generate a PSF at\nthe occulter (intermediate-image) plane.\nA spherical-surface doublet lens would\nreimage the light onto a detector plane.\nOn its way to the detector plane, the light\nwould pass though a Lyot stop. In principle, a linear array of photodetectors\ncould be placed in the final image plane\nto measure the Raman spectrum. The\ndepth of the notch at the pump wavelength, as well as other parameters of the\nperformance of the coronagraphic filter,\n\ncould be tailored through the choice of\nthe parameters of the optical components, including especially the dispersion\nof the grating; the aperture diameter,\nfocal length, and aberrations of the first\ndoublet lens; the length of the occulting\nspot along the axis of dispersion; and the\ndiameter of the Lyot stop.\nThis work was done by David Cohen and\nRobert Stirbl of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This\nmethod involves a raster-scanning-andmeasurement technique denoted on-thefly (OTF) mapping, applied in consideration of the results of a systematic analysis\nof the entire measurement procedure.\nPhenomena to which particular attention\nwas paid in the analysis include (1) the\nnoise characteristics of a total-power radiometer (TPR) that is used in the measurements and (2) tropospherically in-\n\nduced radiometer fluctuations. The\nmethod also involves the use of recently\ndeveloped techniques for acquisition and\nreduction of data. In comparison with\nprior methods used to calibrate such antennas, this method yields an order-ofmagnitude improvement in the precision\nof determinations of antenna aperture efficiency, and improvement by a factor of\nfive or more in the precision of determination of pointing error and beam width.\nPrerequisite to a meaningful description\nof the present method is some background\ninformation concerning three aspects of\n\nVenus Observed by DSS-13 at 58\xc2\xb0 Elevation\n13.8 - GHz, 33 x 33 Array\n\nNoise Temperature, Kelvins\n\n6\n\n15\n\n8\n\n14\n\n0\n\n14\n\n2\n\n13\n\n0.125\xc2\xb0\nCross-Elevation\nAngle\n\n0.125\xc2\xb0\nCross-Elevation\nAngle\n\nThe TPR Readout Data plotted here were acquired in a test raster scan of a portion of the sky, near an\nelevation angle of 58\xc2\xb0, that contained the planet Venus when it was relatively close to Earth. The horizontal axes on this plot correspond to elevation and cross-elevation angles. The vertical axis represents noise temperature in Kelvins.\n\n28\n\nthe problem of calibrating an antenna of\nthe type in question:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In OTF mapping measurements in\nwhich a TPR is used, the desired data are\nthe peak temperature corresponding to a\nradio source, the pointing offset when\nthe antenna is commanded to point toward the source, and the shape of the\nmain lobe of the antenna beam, all as\nfunctions of the antenna beam elevation\nand azimuth angles. These data enable\none to calculate the (1) antenna aperture efficiency by comparing the measured peak temperature with that expected for a 100-percent-efficient\nantenna, (2) the mechanical pointing\nerror resulting from small misalignments\nof various parts of the antenna structure,\nand (3) misalignments of the antenna\nsubreflector and other mirrors.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For practical reasons having to do with obtaining adequate angular resolution and\nall-sky coverage, it is necessary to perform\nazimuth and elevation scans fairly rapidly.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Many natural radio sources used in calibrating antennas are only approximately\npointlike: some sources subtend angles\ngreater than the beam width of a given\nantenna. In such a case, the antenna partially resolves the source structure and\ndoes not collect all of the radiation emitted by the source. This makes it necessary to estimate how much of the total\nknown radiation from the source would\nactually be collected by the antenna if it\nwere 100-percent efficient. The resulting\nestimate, leading to a source-size correction factor, introduces another degree of\nuncertainty to the measurements. OTF\nmapping can remove this uncertainty.\nThe key to using OTF mapping to solve\nall three aspects of the calibration problem\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\nis to maintain a constant, known angular\nvelocity when scanning the antenna along\na given direction. To ensure alignment of\nthe individual subscans within the full\nraster, the angular position of the first data\npoint of each subscan is determined from\nreadings of azimuth- and elevation-angle\nencoders, while the angular positions of\nthe rest of the subscan data points are determined by timing at the constant angular\nvelocity. Hence, if the TPR reading is sampled at a constant known rate, then the relative angular position at which each datum\nis taken is known with high accuracy, and\nantenna-settling time is no longer an issue.\nThe data-acquisition algorithms used in\n\nOTF mapping provide for computation of\nthe angular positions of radio sources,\nsuch that at any given time, the position of\nthe antenna relative to a source is known.\nThe acquisition of data in the OTF\nmode necessarily entails attenuation of\nhigh-frequency information as a consequence of the integration that occurs during the sampling intervals. The high-frequency information can be recovered in\nan inverse-filtering computation.\nEven though the antenna beam does not\nsample all of the radiation from an extended radio source at a given instant, the\ncompleted raster scan does cover the entire\nsolid angle subtended by the source and,\n\nhence contains a sampling of all the radiation from that source. Consequently, no\nsource-size correction is necessary in OTF\nmapping. The resulting set of data registered on a two-dimensional field of sampling points (see figure) can be used to determine a least-squares-best-fit main beam\npattern. The calibration parameters can\nthen be determined from the main beam\npattern.\nThis work was done by David Rochblatt, Paul\nRichter, and Philip Withington of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA theoretical and experimental investigation has shown that the capacities of\nheat pipes can be increased through suitable reformulation of their working fluids. The surface tensions of all of the\nworking fluids heretofore used in heat\npipes decrease with temperature. As explained in more detail below, the limits\non the performance of a heat pipe are associated with the decrease in the surface\ntension of the working fluid with temperature, and so one can enhance performance by reformulating the working\nfluid so that its surface tension increases\nwith temperature. This improvement is\napplicable to almost any kind of heat pipe\nin almost any environment.\nThe heat-transfer capacity of a heat\npipe in its normal operating-temperature\nrange is subject to a capillary limit and a\nboiling limit. Both of these limits are associated with the temperature dependence of surface tension of the working\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\nfluid. In the case of a traditional working\nfluid, the decrease in surface tension with\ntemperature causes a body of the liquid\nphase of the working fluid to move toward a region of lower temperature, thus\npreventing the desired spreading of the\nliquid in the heated portion of the heat\npipe. As a result, the available capillarypressure pumping head decreases as the\ntemperature of the evaporator end of the\nheat pipe increases, and operation becomes unstable.\nWater has widely been used as a working\nfluid in heat pipes. Because the surface\ntension of water decreases with increasing\ntemperature, the heat loads and other aspects of performance of heat pipes that\ncontain water are limited. Dilute aqueous\nsolutions of long-chain alcohols have\nshown promise as substitutes for water that\ncan offer improved performance, because\nthese solutions exhibit unusual surfacetension characteristics: Experiments have\n\nshown that in the cases of an aqueous solution of an alcohol, the molecules of\nwhich contain chains of more than four\ncarbon atoms, the surface tension increases with temperature when the temperature exceeds a certain value.\nThere are also other liquids that have\nsurface tensions that increase with temperature and could be used as working fluids\nin heat pipes. For example, as a substitute\nfor ammonia, which is the working fluid in\nsome heat pipes, one could use a solution\nof ammonia and an ionic surfactant.\nThis work was done by David F. Chao of\nGlenn Research Center and Nengli Zhang\nof Ohio Aerospace Institute.

The algorithm, referred to as Neighboring Optimal\nWind Routing (NOWR), is based upon\nneighboring-optimal-control (NOC)\nconcepts and achieves minimum-time\npaths by adjusting aircraft heading according to wind conditions at an arbitrary number of wind measurement\npoints along the flight route. The\nNOWR algorithm may either be used\nin a fast-time mode to compute minimum-time routes prior to flight, or\nmay be used in a feedback mode to adjust aircraft heading in real-time. By\ntraveling minimum-time routes instead\nof direct great-circle (direct) routes,\nflights across the United States can\nsave an average of about 7 minutes,\nand as much as one hour of flight time\nduring periods of strong jet-stream\nwinds. The neighboring optimal\nroutes computed via the NOWR technique have been shown to be within\n1.5 percent of the absolute minimumtime routes for flights across the continental United States. On a typical 450MHz Sun Ultra workstation, the\nNOWR algorithm produces complete\nminimum-time routes in less than 40\nmilliseconds. This corresponds to a\nrate of 25 optimal routes per second.\nThe closest comparable optimization\ntechnique runs approximately 10\ntimes slower.\nAirlines currently use various trialand-error search techniques to determine which of a set of commonly traveled routes will minimize flight time.\nThese algorithms are too computationally expensive for use in real-time systems, or in systems where many optimal\nroutes need to be computed in a short\namount of time. Instead of operating in\nreal-time, airlines will typically plan a\ntrajectory several hours in advance\nusing wind forecasts. If winds change\nsignificantly from forecasts, the resulting flights will no longer be minimumtime. The need for a computationally\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2004\n\nefficient wind-optimal routing algorithm is even greater in the case of new\nair-traffic-control automation concepts.\nFor air-traffic-control automation, thousands of wind-optimal routes may need\nto be computed and checked for conflicts in just a few minutes. These factors motivated the need for a more efficient wind-optimal routing algorithm.\nThe NOWR algorithm is a special type\nof perturbation feedback control as\nshown in the figure. The nominal winds\nare modeled as system states, and are\nconsidered to be zero magnitude so that\nthe nominal trajectory solution is simply\na great-circle route between origin and\ndestination. The actual winds are input\nas perturbations to the nominal winds,\nmultiplied by time-varying NOWR gains,\nand then fed back as heading command\nperturbations to achieve a minimum-\n\ntime trajectory solution. The NOWR\ngains are computed using techniques\nfrom the calculus of variations. Because\nthe nominal route is a great circle, and\nbecause the nominal winds are zero\nmagnitude, the NOWR feedback gains\nmay be normalized and applied to\nflights at any airspeed between any origin and destination using coordinate rotations and simple time and distance\nscaling. This one-solution-fits-all aspect\nof NOWR makes it a very powerful and\npractical technique.\nThe implementation procedure for\nNOWR is to either run a fast-time simulation to compute an optimal wind\nroute, which can then be used as the\nbasis for a filed flight plan, or one may\nuse NOWR in real-time to achieve windoptimal routes in a future free flight environment.\n\nunom\nNominal\nSolution\n\n\xe2\x88\x86x\n\nxnom\n+\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nNOC Gain\nMatrix\n\n\xe2\x88\x86u\n\n+\n+\n\n\xe2\x88\x91\n\nu\n\nDynamics\nModule\n\nx\n\nSum Module\n\nFeedforward and Feedback quantities are computed in an NOC approach to adjustment of control\nvariables for optimization of the route taken by an aircraft.\n\n31\n\nThe optimization process begins by\nfirst rotating coordinates so that the\norigin and destination points appear to\nbe located along the equator of the rotated coordinate system. The distance\nunit is then scaled such that the distance from origin to destination is\nunity. The time unit is similarly scaled\nsuch that the airspeed of the aircraft is\nalso unity. Because of this scaling, any\nflight between any two points appears\nto be mathematically similar. The\nwinds along the flight route are then\nobtained from the Rapid Update Cycle\n(RUC), a national gridded wind system\ndeveloped at the National Oceanic and\n\n32\n\nAtmospheric Administration. The\nNOWR algorithm may be adapted to\nuse as many wind measurement points\nalong the route as are desired, but in\npractice, about 10 or 15 points are sufficient. At each of these points, the predicted winds are multiplied by the\nNOWR gains to determine the optimal\nheading angles the aircraft should use\nto fly a minimum-time route. Once the\noptimal heading and the coordinates\nof the minimum-time route have been\ncomputed in the normalized coordinate system, the solution may be transformed back to real Earth coordinates\nthrough the inverse rotation equations.\n\nThe reason why this perturbation\nscheme is so efficient is that it is a simple linear feedback algorithm involving just a few algebraic steps. The excellent performance of NOWR in\npractice is achieved because winds typically vary in a smooth manner and do\nnot contain many sharp nonlinearities\nor discontinuities.\nThis work was done by Matthew R.

The propellant liquid for such a\nthruster would be a low-melting-temperature metal that would be stored molten in\nan unpressurized, heated reservoir and\nwould be pumped to the thruster by a magnetohydrodynamic coupler. The liquid\nwould enter the thruster via a metal tube\ninside an electrically insulating ceramic\ntube. A capacitor would be connected between the outlet of the metal tube and the\nouter electrode of the thruster. The pumping would cause a drop of liquid to form at\nthe outlet, eventually growing large\nenough to make contact with the outer\nelectrode. Contact would close the circuit\nthrough the capacitor, causing the capacitor to discharge through the drop. The capacitor would have been charged with\nenough energy that the discharge would\nvaporize, ionize, and electromagnetically\naccelerate the contents of the metal drop.\nThe resulting plasma would be ejected at a\nspeed of about 50 km/s. The vaporization\nof the drop would reopen the circuit\nthrough the capacitor, enabling recharging of the capacitor.
