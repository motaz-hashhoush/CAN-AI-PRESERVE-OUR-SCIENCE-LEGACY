The earlier\nrect.\n\nthis work is to establish the constant of stepin a large discharge tube by way of its dependence\ndensity of electrons and properties of different\nratio of such constants is established for two such\ncalculations by Bates et al are proved to be incor-\n\n*\n*\n\n1.\n\n*\n\nA step-by-step ionization in a discharge tube takes place in the case\n\nwhen the departure time of an excited atom on the tube walls is much greater\nthan its destruction time under the effect of electron impact, i. e., the stepby-step-ionization is realized at sufficiently large transverse dimensions of\nthe discharge tube and high electron densities.\n\nIn the process of step-by-step\n\nionization the excited atom undergoes awhole sequence of excited states, whereupon the transitions between these states are conditioned by atom\'s collisions\nwith electrons.\n\nUnder the considered conditions, that is, for large dimensions\n\nof the discharge tube, the ionization constant is independent of tube\'s dimensions, and since the distribution function of free electrons by velocities is Maxwellian\n\n(high electron density), this quantity depends only on temperature of\n\nelectrons, on their density and on the properties of ionized atoms.\n\nThe object,\n\nof the present work is the finding of such a dependence.\n\n2. We shall establish the relationship between the constants of step-bystep ionization in two different atomic gases. At the same time, we shall consider that the temperature of electrons is much smaller than the excitation\nenergy of atoms. The density of free electrons , formed as a result of step bystep ionization per unit of time is:\n\ndNe / dt -\n\nwhere Ne is the density of electrons; Nn is the density of atoms in the state n_;\nkn is the constant of these atoms\' direct ionization.\n\nThe constant of step-by-\n\nstep ionization k^on is introduced on the basis of the relation\ndNe / dt =\n\nwhere Na is the density of atoms in the ground state.\n\nHence,\n\nu>\nWhen obtaining the relations between constants of step-by-step ionization\nin different gases, we shall make use of the fact that the properties of strongly\nexcited atoms do not depend on the kind of atom, for they are determined by the\nCoulomb interaction of the electron with the charge of atom\'s residue.\n\nThis is\n\nwhy the constants of direct ionization k^ of the excited atom are identical for\natoms of arbitrary kind.\n\nBesides, the ratio of densities of atoms N\n\n/N\n,\nn\nn\nwhich are in identical strongly excited states in two different gases for identical densities and temperatures of electrons, is independent of the number of\nthis state.\n\nDenoting N\n\n/N\n\n= s and taking into account that at low tempera-\n\ntures of electrons the quantity k^on is determined by the destruction of strongly\nexcited atoms, we shall obtain for the ratio of constants of step-by-step ionization of different kinds of atoms with identical density and temperature of electrons :\nk\'1\' / k < ? ) = s N ( 2 ) / N ( l ) .\nion\nion\na\na\nHere, indices 1 and 2 are related to atoms of the respective kind.\nFor the determination of the proportionality factor s_, which is independent\nof the density of electrons, we shall consider the case of high electron density,\nwhen the collision frequencies of electron with excited atoms substantially exceed\nthe emission frequencies of the excited atom.\n\nIn this case the density of excited\n\natoms is determined by the Boltzmann law:\n\nwhere T is the temperature of electrons, gn = g.:8en2; g., is the statistical weight\nof the ion; g = 2; g\n\nis the statistical weight of the atom in ground state;\n\nI, I\n\nare respectively .the ionization potentials in ground and excited atate.\n\nMaking use of this, we find the proportionality factor, which leads to the following relation between the constants of step-by-step ionization for atoms of\ndifferent kind at identical temperature and density of electrons:\nk(\xc2\xbbii\xc2\xa3\n\nion g,j[\n\n(M\n\n_ k(a)^a\n\n\\ T \'\n\nion\n\n(M\n\n(2)\n\nT\n\n8,-i\n\nHere g la , g2 , I , I2 are respectively the statistical weight and the ionizatior\npotential of the corresponding atom in ground state; g^,\n\ng2i is the statistical\n\nweight of the ion.\n3.\n\nLet us consider with more detail the case of high density of electrons,\n\nwhen the radiation of excited atoms does not play any part and the density of\nexcited atoms responds to the Boltzmann law:\nN\n\nn ~ NaSn / 8a exP (~en / T>.\n\nwhere e\n\nis the energy of excitation of the corresponding level, gn = geg^n2 is\n\nits statistical weight.\n\nThen the ionization constant is\n\nk\n\nion = 77; f A-\'"V\xc2\xab = 77 i \xc2\xab\' ^ *\xc2\xabt>xP (- T\n\nInasmuch as at inelastic collisions with an excited atom the transferred\nenergies are of the order of the temperature of electrons, the basic contribution to this integral is made by excited states with ionization energy of the\norder of the temperature of electrons me2/ h2n2 ^ T.\n\nTaking this into account,\n\n,we obtain\n\nwhere the characteristic velocity of collision of electrons with the atom, i. e.\nv ^ /T / m, the ionization cross-section\na % e1* / T2 for an excited atom with\nbinding energy me"* / h2n2 ^ T coincides by order of magnitude with the exchange\ncross section of two free electrons with kinetic energies of the order of the\ntemperature of electrons with energy of the order of the temperature T. Thus,\nin the given case we shall obtain for the constant of step-by-step ionization\n* \xc2\xbb / \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nof the atom by electron impact:\n01\n\n\xe2\x80\x94~1"\n\n()\n3\nocl u J^p J\n\nwhere the coefficient A is independent of the temperature of electrons and of\nthe kind of atoms.\nT A B L E\nPLASMA\nTemperature of\nelectrons\n1000\xc2\xb0K\n\nHydrogen\n\nAlkalin metal\n\n1\n\nHydrogen-like\n\n^\n\'\n\n\'.\n\n.5\n\n10\n\n32\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n4\n\n3\n\nif, ~ ~\n2 *\n\n0,\'V5 0,011 0,nr,.) 0,025 0,051 O.W6 0,022 0,03! 0,10 0,045 0,0/1 .1,06;}\n\nA\n\nPlotted in the above Table 1 are the values of the coefficient A obtained\nby way of processing the calculations by Bates, Kingston and McWhirter [1] for\nthe constant of step-by-step ionization.\n\nAt the same time, the ionization cons-\n\ntant, computed in this work for high densities of electrons, was substituted in\nthe right-hand part of formula (3) and from the relation thus obtained we found\nthe coefficient A.\n\nAccording to the obtained result, the coefficient A must be\n\nidentical in all cases.\n\nAt the same time the obtained dependence is valid within\n\nthe limits of low temperature T / I \xc2\xab\n\n1, when free electrons are forming as a\n\nresult of ionization of strongly excited atoms.\n\nThe fact that the processing of\n\ncalculations does not lead to identical values of A should be ascribed to the\nshortcomings\nhave been\n\nthe calculations by Bates, Kingston and McWhirter [1].\n\nIndeed, what\n\nutilized in that work for cross sections of inelastic transitions\n\nbetween the state of atoms under the action of the electron impact is in fact the\nempirical formulas of Grizinskiy, whose precision is quite limited.\n\nThe error\n\nin the cross-section accrues during the computation of the ionization constant,\nso that the error in this constant\n\nmay be greater than the error in the cross-\n\nsection of inelastic transition, and, roughly speaking, by as many factors as\nthere are transitions performed by a valence electron prior to ionization.\n4.\n\nWe shall make use of the information that can be extracted from the pro--\n\ncess of triple recombination of electrons and ions within the limits, when the\ndensity of electrons is high, so that the radiation plays no part.\nprocess\n\nproceeds according to the scheme\n\nThe considered\n\n2e + X \xe2\x80\xa2*\xe2\x80\xa2 e + X, and it is opposite\n\nin detail to the process of interest to us, thats is, the step-by-step ionization.\n\nAccording to investigations of the three-piece recombination mechanism [2-6],\nthe recombining electron spents the basic recombination time at levels with ionization energy of the order of the temperature.\n\nThis agrees well with our own\n\nassertion, whereby the step-by-step ionization is determined mainly by the disintegration of excited atoms with an ionization potential of the order of the\ntemperature.\nIn case of equilibrium between the processes of triple recombination and\nstep-by-step ionization, the relationship between the constants (k. ) of stepby-step ionization and those (a\n\n) of triple recombination has the form\n\nk.

In the Gurevich and\nPitayevskiy\'s work [5] the triple recombination of the electron with a multicharge ion with great charge Z \xc2\xbb 1 was investigated.

Finally, in the D\'Angelo work [6], formula (4) was ob-\n\ntained on the basis of Thomson theory for a triple capture.

This questions the reliability of the indicated calculations,\nwhich is linked with the utilization in them of Grizinskiy\'s formulas for the\ntransition cross-sections.,\n! i\n\'\n\\\n\\ i\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n5. In conclusion let us compare the constant of ste -by-step and direct\nionization in case of low temperatures and high densities of electrons. The\natom\'s ionization cross-section by electron impact near threshold is pract.ically\ndetermined by the linear dependence on the difference of electron energy\nand the ionization potential :\n\nwhere 00 is of the order of atomic magnitude. Hence we find for the constant of\ndirect ionization, averaged by the Maxwellian distribution of electrons:\nk\n\ndir ~ "V8T \'Trmao\n\nexp (-I / T)>\n\nComparing this with the step-by-step ionization constant (5), we find\nk\n\ndir \'kstep % <h*T /me*>72 \xc2\xab 1-\n\nTherefore, at high densities of electrons and low temperatures, there materializes a step-by-step mechanism o.f free electron formation.\n\nNote that the\n\ndistibution function of electrons at the tail usually decreases more sharply\nthan the Maxwellian, i.e. the direct ionization constant is still less than\nwhat we obtained.\n*** E N\n\nD ***\n\nReferences follow...\n\nR E F E R E N C E S\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nD.R.
