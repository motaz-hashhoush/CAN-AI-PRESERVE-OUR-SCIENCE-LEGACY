Mg II emission is probably present in all stars. High-resolution spectra of three of the brightest giants show asymmetric Mg II profiles which indicate a differentially expanding atmosphere, signaling the presence of outward mass motions. Surprisingly, the stellar surface fluxes in the Mg II lines are commensurate with the values found for disk giant stars (population I) of similar color. In spite of substantially depleted Mg abundances in the target stars (by factors of 10-100 relative to the solar abundance), the radiative losses implied by the Mg II fluxes, and possibly the chromospheric heating mechanism, appear to be reasonably independent of metallicity and age.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "353", "submissionId": 19900044378, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "e11d3668fd834aa4a37fdcd45917331a", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1990-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
