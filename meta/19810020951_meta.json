From experiments which would measure the drag, lift, and torque acting on the tethered satellite, important information could be obtained which would have application to satellite lifetime prediction, determination of properties of the upper atmosphere, and scientific information on the interaction of high speed molecules with surfaces (the gas surface interaction). These experiments using the tethered satellite concept are described and would measure the following variables: angle of attack, surface roughness, and flow properties.", "title": "Aerodynamic effects", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T03:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810020951, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Karr, G.
