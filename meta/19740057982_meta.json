Lunar geophysics is discussed  in sections dealing with the figure of the moon, mascons, and the lunar thermal regime; recent seismic studies and magnetic results are reported. The chemical data on materials taken from lunar orbit are analyzed, and the lunar geology is discussed. Special attention is accorded the subject of minerology, reflecting the information obtained from lunar samples of both mare and nonmare origin. A tentative timetable of lunar events is proposed, and the problem of the moon's origin  is briefly treated.", "title": "Lunar science", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T17:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740057982, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brett, R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, Tex., United States"}}, "id": "fbf4b97c83664405a7d5868f5f99adb5"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Collected Works", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19740057982, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740057982, "id": "6fea33b3c1e6441f902f7078f3440d9d", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
