The topographic profiles of the selected Martian volcanoes that are currently being acquired will be compared with tabulated data for terrestrial and lunar volcanoes. Variation in volcanic style with age will also be examined.", "title": "Small Martian valcanoes", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880020284, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davis, Philip A."}, "organization": {"name": "Geological Survey", "location": "Flagstaff, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "7e32d0521c844572be0f676634a3d60b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880020284, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tanaka, Kenneth L."}, "organization": {"name": "Geological Survey", "location": "Flagstaff, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "cb154f36b56d45b2a86243ff76bb472d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880020284, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880020284, "id": "6ecc208b21234b1d9ac447f86ea6b58c", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst., MEVTV Workshop on Nature and Composition of Surface Units on Mars", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
