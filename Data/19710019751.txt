In recent literature,\nTitov and Fadayenko (References 1 and 2) have reported achieving\nvelocities of up to 14 km/sec with steel, ceramic, and glass\nspheres 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter. Using an apparently similar\ndevice, Rusakov (References 3 and 4) has attained 25 km/sec with\na 0.2-gram cluster of tungsten microparticles.\nThe capability of reproducing the Russian results is desirable for two reasons: first, the Russian drag accelerator is a\nproven technique for launching spheres to velocities of 14 km/sec\nand would be immediately useful as a ground test facility for the\nstudy of hypervelocity meteorite impact on spacecraft structures;\nsecond, the device is lightweight and simple to operate. It can\nbe launched to high altitudes by a booster rocket and fired into\nthe atmosphere to generate an artificial meteorite of known mass\nand velocity. Optical data obtained from the artificial meteorite\ncan then be used to interpret meteorite observation records in\norder to determine mass, velocity, and impact frequency statistics.\nThe goal of this program was to investigate the basic operating\nparameters of the explosive drag accelerator and to try to duplicate the Russian achievement of a 14 km/sec projectile.\n\n1\n\ni\n\nPIFR-269\n\nSection 2 presents a theoretical analysis of the explosive\ndrag accelerator. A discussion of the experimental results of\nthis program is presented in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 gives\nthe conclusions and recommEndations of this program.\n\n2\n\n\t\n\nPIFR-269\n\nSECTION 2\nTHEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nOF THE EXPLOSIVE DRAG ACCELERATOR\n\nThe explosive drag accelerator is based on the concept of\nthe "cumulative charge" developed by Soviet Academician M. A.\nLavrentyev (References S and 6). A cumulative charge is a thickwalled cylinder of explosive. When a detonation wave propagates\naxially down the charge, the high pressures behind the detonation\ncause gaseous explosive products to be imploded radially toward\nthe charge axis (see Figure 1). Under the proper conditions,\nwhich for a hollow cylinder of explosive implies having a sufficiently large outer-diameter-to-inner-diameter ratio, a jet of\nexplosive products will shoot forward from the point of convergence. An exact analysis of the compressible jetting flow is\nextremely complex, involving expansion behind the detonation\nwave, turning of the flow, and reexpansion to fill the inner\ndiameter of the charge while driving a shock into the ambient gas\nwithin the charge. An analytical solution for the axially\nsymmetric, compressible jet has not been found; therefore, an\napproximate, one-dimensional theory based on the integral conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum will be described in\nSection 2.1.\n2.1 PERFECTLY CONFINED CUMULATIVE CHARGE\n\nf\t\n\nThe case of a perfectly confined cumulative charge is the\nsimplest to consider, because all flow is in the axial direction.\nThe more realistic case of imperfect confinement requires a con-\n\n;\t\n\nsiderabD7 more sophisticated treatment. The basic concepts are\n\n3\n\nPIFR-269\n\n^- Izz-\n\nDetonation\t\nfront\t\n\n^.`.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^\t\n\n^^\n\nCylinder of\nhigh explosive\n\n\\\\ \\C \\\t\n\n\\ \\\n\nT\'.

In addition,\nperfect confinement is the most efficient explosive configuration\nand represents an upper bound on accelerator performance.\nConsider the case of a steady-state detonation in a perfectly\nconfined cumulative charge (see Figure 2). At sufficiently larqe\ndistances from the detonation and jet formation region, the jet\nand exhaust gases have uniform properties at an axial cross\nsection. The integral conservation laws may be applied to a\ncontrol surface across the flow at these points.\n\nCylinder of\nconfining material\n\nDetonation\n\nCylinder of\n\nfront\n\nhigh explosive\n\ni\n\n1\nL\nExhaust gases\t\n\nJetting gases\n\nFigure 2 Perfectly confined cumulative charge.\n\n5\n\nPIFR-269\n\nLet the explosive charge mass per unit length be C, the\ndetonation velocity D, the cross-sectional area of the jet stream\nA j , the area of the exhaust stream Ae , density p, pressure p,\nenthalpy h, and velocity u. Then in the steady-state frame of\nreference we have:\nConservation of Mass:\nCD = p j uj A j + pe ue Ae\t(\n\n1)\n\nConservation of Axial Momentum:\nCD \t\n\n+ p jAj - p\n\nA\n\n=\n\nP\n\nue2 A\n\n- pj uj2 A \t\n\n(2)\n\nFor any stream tube in steady-state flow, the first law\nof thermodynamics implies that\nh\n\n+ 2 u2\n\n3\n\nis a constant. Choosing a stream tube in the jet and a stream\ntube in the exhaust:\nhj\n\nj\n+2u\n\n2 = E\n\n+ 2 r; 2\t\n\n(3)\n\nhe\n\ne\n+2u\n\n2 = E\n\n)\n+ 2 D 2\t(4\n\nwhere E is the internal energy per unit mass of the explosive.\nFinally an arbitrary equation of state may be assumed:\nh =\t\n\nf (p, p)\t\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n\t\nI\n\nPIFR-269\n\nEquations (1) through (5) reduce to four equations in the\nsix unknowns p j , u j , Pj,\n\nPet\n\nu e , Pe .\n\nFor a unique solution, it is\n\nnecessary to obtain two more equations, which can be shown to be\nequivalent to identifying the entropy of the exhaust and jet\ngases. Thus the flow variables can be calculated if the entropy\ngenerated in the gas expansion and jetting can be estimated,\nbecause the detonation entropy of the explosive is known.\nF`}jE\n\ni\n\nRather than attempt to estimate the entropy, it will be\nfurther assumed that the jet and exhaust gases are highly expanded,\ni.e., Pe ^ p j 25 0.

Titov and\nFadeyenko (Reference 2) have reported a jet-driven air shock\nvelocity in 1-torr air of 18.1 km/sec, corresponding to a particle velocity of 16.6 km/sec. The Russian explosive had a\ndetonation velocity of 7.6 km/sec. Assuming that 22 d 0.15,\nD\nthen the predicted jet velocity is\nu^ = 2.08 D = 15.8 km/sec\nThe small difference between 15.8 and 16.6 can be explained by\nthe unsteady expansion necessary to match the steady-state jet\nconditions to the low-pressure air shock Hugoniot.\n2.2 CONSTANT DRAG ACCELERATION\nThe trajectory of a drag-accelerated spherical projectile\ncan be readily calculated if the drag coefficient and free-stream\njet properties are assumed to be constant.

Then\n\n8\t\n\ni\n\nPIFR-269\n\ndw\ndt = k (uJ - w) 2\t(3)\nIntearating this equation,\nktu .\nJ\t\nktu. + 1\nJ\n\n(4)\n\nkx = ktu j - kn (ktu j + 1)\t\n\n(5)\n\nW\t\nu.\t\nJ\t\nand\n\nGiven a terminal projectile velocity and an acceleration\ndistance x, the above equations may be used to calculate the\naverage jet density p j . Assume the jet velocity is twice the\ndetonation velocity; then the value of ktu j can be calculated\nfrom Equation (4), and kx and k are known from Equation (5).\nThe drag coefficient of a sphere in hypersonic flow is 0.91 \t\n(see Reference 2), and Equation (2) may be solved for p. , using\nJ\nthe initial diameter and density of the projectile. Typical\ndensities calculated in this fashion were approximately 0.06\ngrams/cc, which compares well to the Russian average density\nof 0.0605 grams/cc.\n\n9\n\n_\n\nPIFR-269\n\nSECTION 3\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nExtensive experiments with an explosive drag accelerator were\nconducted by Physics International Company under NASA sponsorship.\nParameters and variables studied were the distance from the projectile to the detonation end of the explosive charge (run-in\ndistance), distance from the projectile location to the charge\nmuzzle (acceleration path), projectile material, projectile suspension system, boundary layer growth, uniformity of the jet,\nambient gas in the charge bore, explosive geometry, and type of\nexplosive. Typically, experiments were instrumented with flash\nradiographs, shorting range switches, and a high-speed framing\ncamera on the range. Shorting ionization pins monitored the\nperformance of the explosive. The explosive used for the majority of the tests was Detatube, Type 1, manufactured by E. I.\nduPont de Nemours and Company. Detatube is an extruded charge,\nmade from an explosive material designated EL506-C, with nominal\ndimensions of 5/8-inch inner diameter and 1 -3/4 -inch outer diameter and a detonation velocity of 7.1 km/sec.\nPrior to this program, a preliminary drag accelerator test\nshot was fired with in-house funding. The design parameters for\nthis shot were given to Dr. S. P. Gill of Physics International\nby the Russian scientists investigating the drag accelerator\nwhile Dr. Gill was visiting Novosibirsk, USSR. The shot successfully launched a 1.6-mm steel sphere to 6.7 km/sec.\n\n10\n\nPIFR-269\n\nA table summarizing the results of this program is presented\nin subsection 3.6. Appendix A contains a table listing the shots\nfired, their purpose, and the specific instrumentation on each\nshot.\n3.1 EXPERIMENTS 1.1 AND 1.2\n\nThe first experiments investigated two basic approaches that \t\n\nI\n\ncould be used during the program. The first approach was to change\nfroia a cylindrical to a rectangular explosive geometry (shot 1.1)\nwhile the second method was to fire the charges in a vacuum to\nimprove performance (shot 1-. 2) .\nThe rectangular driver appeared to have several advantages\nover the cylindrical charge. The jet of a rectangular charge\ntheoretically has\n\nhigher\n\nperformance than the jet of a cylindrical\n\ncharge because the convergence effect at the cylinder\'s axis will\nproduce a more violent, i.e., a more irreversible, turning of the\nflow. Therefore, the planar geometry should generate less entropy in turning the flow and have less degradation of the jet \t\n\n-\n\nthan the cylindrical case. In addition, rectangular drivers with\na wide variation of C/A j (charge mass per unit length to jet\narea ratio) can easily be built with Detasheet (slabs of EL506-C\nexplosive). Detatube,\n\nwhich was\n\nthe explosive charge used for\n\nthe majority of the shots, is available in only two sizes.\nThe results of shot 1.1 indicated that the rectangular charge\ndid not launch any projectiles. A study of the high--speed framing camera record demonstrated that the explosive charge did not\njet. Post-shot analysis of the gasdynamics of the jetting process\nindicated that using a thicker explosive layer would solve this\nproblem.\n\n11\n\ni\n\nPIFR-269\n\nShot 1.2 was a close repetition of the preliminary experiment, the major difference being that, on the second shot, the\nambient gas in the charge bore was air at 12-mm pressure. It\nwas thought that the low-pressure atmosphere might improve performance by reducing the counter-pressure on the projectile.\nAlso, the results of the Russian investigations (see Reference 2)\nshowed that low pressures were effective in eliminating boundary\nlayer effects from typical charge lengths used during the program.\t\nSince boundary layer degradation reduces the velocity of the jetting gases, projectile velocity might be increased if these\neffects were absent.\nNo projectile was detected on the instrumentation for shot\n1.2, which consisted of flash radiographs, range switches, and a\ntarget. The most probable cause of failure was a large angular\ndivergence of the projectile, with either the projectile impacting on the Lucite walls of the vacuum system and destroying itself or diverging from the main jet stream and not accelerating\nquickly enough to avoid being overtaken by the detonation wave.\nThe possibility of the latter occurring is supported by calculations which demonstrate that a projectile launched in a vacuum\naccelerates slower than a projectile launched in atmospheric\nair. In the preliminary experiment (fired in atmospheric air)\nthe sphere emerged just ahead of the detonation front.\nAt this point in the program, it was decided to return to\nexperimenting with the basic, drag accelerator design of a\ncylindrical charge fired in ambient air. It was felt that further\ndevelopment of the rectangular geometry or the use of a lowpressure atmosphere could be most effectively investigated later\nin the program.\n\n12\n\nt\n\nPIFR-269\n\n3.2 EXPERIMENTS 1.3 THROUGH 1.10 - VARIATION OF PROJECTILE\nMATERITL AND POSITION\nExperiments 1.3 through 1.10 focused on finding an acceptable\nprojectile material and on the effect of varying the run-in distance and the acceleration path length. All experiments used\nDetatube and all projectiles were 1.6-mm- (1/16 inch-) diameter\nspheres placed on the charge axis. Material for projectiles\nduring the program was annealed 52100 steel, hardened 52100 steel,\nand hardened 410 stainless steel. The 410 stainless steel sphere\nbroke up when tested in an accelerator. Both forms of 52100\nsteel were acceptable for projectiles, but the annealed spheres\nwere used because of their betterualit Y\t\ncontrol and availability..\n4\t\nY\nVariation of the run-in distance and acceleration path length\nLF\n\ndemonstrated that the projectile velocity depended on both these\nparameters and also on the angular divergence. Run-in distances\nwere 32 cm and 40 cm while acceleration paths of 4, 8, and 12 cm\nwere used. A typical experiment in this series is shot 1.7,\nwhich had a run-in of 32 cm and an acceleration path of 8 cm.\n]Figure 3 shows the experimental set-up with the explosive charge\nin place. Two range switches and one of the two X-ray film\ncassettes can be seen in the picture. The mirror above the near\nportion of the range allows this region of the shot to be photographed by the high-speed framing camera. A distance-time plot\nof this shot is shown in Figure 4. The projectile velocity\nbetween the position on t.iie first flash radiograph and the first\nrange switch is 6.95 km/sec. From this flash radiograph (Figure 5) it may be seen that the soft annealed 52100 steel sphere\nhas been flattened during the launch cycle. For comparison, a\nset-up projectile may be seen just above the saw blade at the\nbottom of the picture. Finally, the projectile drilled through\nthe 1/4-inch-thick aluminum target at the end of the range (Figure 6 ) .\n13\n\nt\n\nPIFR-269\n\nj\n\nWk\n\na-\n\nt\n\nFigure 3 Pre-shot experimental set-up for shot 1.7.\n14\n\nPIFR-269\n\nf\n\n200\n\nProjectile\nvelocity =\n6.95\nkm/sec\n\nU\nQ)\nN\n\n.z\nv\nE, LOO\n\nO Ion pins in explosive\nFlash radiographs\n[] Range switches\n\n\t\n\n/\n\nDetonation\nvelocity = 7.04 km/sec\n\n100\n\n\t\n\n200\n\nDistance (cm)\n\nFigure 4 Distance - time plot for shot 1.7.\n\n15\n\ne\n\nPIFR-269\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\n0\n\nEC\n\nAl\n\nihi\n\nAil\n\nFigure 5 Flash r adicgraph t\nfirst ca ssette, shot 1.7.\n16\n\nPIFR-269\n\ni\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nFigure 6 Crater produced by projectile in shot 1.7.\n\n17\n\nPIFR-269\n\nThe results of the variation of the projectile position\nwithin the charge can be summarized in terms of the parameter k\n(see subsection 2.2) for constant drag acceleration. Figure 7\nshows the variation of k with angular divergence and run-in distance. The trend of the two curves indicates that higher velocities can be expected with longer run-in distances; therefore,\nboundary layer growth was unimportant for these tests. Also,\nthe angular divergence of the experiments was rather varied, one\nexperiment (not shown on Figure 7) having a divergence of about\n10 degrees.\nAttempts were made to reduce the dispersion by variations\nin the charge initiation system and projectile suspension system.\nCharges were originally initiated uniformly around their circumference by an explosive train which was activated by a single\ndetonator. This was changed to four detonators, simultaneously\nenergized, directly initiating the Detatube charge. Projectiles\nwere suspended by Mylar tape and magic mending tape. Later in\nthe program, the projectile was taped to a very thin styrofoam\ndisk which was inserted down the bore of the c aarge. None of\nthese techniques reduced the dispersion.\nP\n\nIn addition to dispersion, another nonideal effect observed\nduring the program was tae ablation of projectiles moving down\nthe shot range. The framing camera record of a shot sometimes\nshowed that a projectile "split" into two parts after emerging\nfrom the opaque accelerator gases. Each part followed the trajectory of the original projectile. This severe ablation can be\nseen very clearly in Figure 8, which shows three frames from the\ncamera record of shot 1.10. The increased ablation rate is\napparently due to a jump in the drag force on the projectile when\nit emerges from the accelerator gases. The drag force, which is\na function of the relative velocity between projectile and surrounding gas, increases because the accelerator gases are moving\n\ni\n\n0\n\nPIFR-269\n\n0.04\n\nri\ni\nU\n0.03\n\na cA\n^ b\nM\n\n0.02\n\nu\n\n0\n\n40 cm run-in\n\nO\n\n32 cm run-in\n\n0.01\n\ni\n0L\n\n0\n\n1\t\n\n2\t\n\n3\t\n\n4\t\n\n5\n\nAngular divergence of projectile\nat target (degrees)\n\nFigure 7\t\n\nVariation of the constant drag acceleration parameter k with projectile diver g ence and run-in\ndistance.\n19\n\nPIFR-269\n\nDownrange\nJetti nq\nit\n\n1\t\n\nShock\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\na.\n\nExplosive\nProducts\n\nProjectile\nJetting\n\nAir Shock\n\nP\nb.\n\nExplU .)PVC\nProducts ..\n\nProjectile\nJr Shock\n\nc.\n\nExplosive\'\t\nProducts\n\n\' Projectile\n\nFigure 8 Sequence from framing camera record of shot 1.10\nshowing severe projectile ablation.\n20\n\nPIFR-269\n\ndown range at several kilometers per second, while the ambiE!nt\nair is at rest.

The\nobjective of the next experiments was to investigate boundary\nlayer growth in very long charges of Detatube and to obtain information on the gasdynamics of the jetting gases. A representative\nshot is 1.12, which was 150 cm long (or 100 charge diameters)\nand was fired in ambient air. Shorting ionization pins within\nthe explosive monitored the arrival of the detonation wave, while\nionization pins, pushed through the explosive into the jet,\nrecorded the passage of the jet-driven air shock. The location\nof the contact surface between the cool, jetting explosive products and the hot, shocked air can be photographically recorded\nwith a high-speed framing camera. To do this, a 15-cm-long Lucite\nextension was placed at the muzzle end of the charge to contain\nthe emerging jet for photography. Finally, four projectiles were\nplaced at the muzzle of the charge, with one on axis and three\noff axis. The three off-axis spheres were halfway between the\naxis and the charge inner wall, 120 degrees apart. The shot range\nwas instrumented with range switches, a high-speed framing camera,\nand flash radiographs.\nA distance-time plot of the data from 1.12 (see Figure 9)\ndemonstrated that boundary layer effects wc.re unimportant until\n50 charge diameters in ambient air.

A high-quality cast and machined explosive charge\nwould probably improve the uniformity because the high dimensional\ntolerances and extremely constant planar detonation wave would\nproduce very little perturbation to the jet formation process.\nDetatube, being extruded and coarse-grained, lacks dimensional\ncontrol and has an inconstant detonation wave compared to an\nexplosive such as HMX.\nA similar experiment in helium at 14.7 psia produced higher\nshock velocities (12.1 km/sec as compared to 10.7 km/sec in air)\nand longer ideal operating lengths, with boundary layer effects\nabsent until at least 75 charge diameters. The uncertainty is\ndue to the weak ionization behind the helium shock adversely\n1^.\n\naffecting ion pin response. Two of the projectiles emerged at\n4.3 and 4.8 km/sec, corresponding to the velocities in air of\n4.7 and 4.9 km/sec. This indicates that most of the projectile\nacceleration is performed by the jetting explosive gases and not\nthe shocked air or helium. In other words, the projectile velocity appears to be independent of the ambient gas in the charge\nbore. On the basis of this conclusion, further work with a lowpressure air system does not appear likely to increase projectile\nvelocities appreciably.\n\n23\n\nPIFR-269\n\nt\n\n9\n\n10\n\nO 1\t\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1\t\n\n2 3\n\nIt\n\nFigure 10 Target of shot 1.12 showing the differing velocities\nand dispersion of the four projectiles.\n\n24\n\nPIFR-269\n\nThe responsibility of jetting explosive products for the\nprojectile acceleration is supported theoretically by calculating\nthe dynamic pressure, pu 2 , in the different re g ions of the jet.\nThe dynamic pressure is the important variable because it is\nproportional to the drag force. The dynamic pressure of the\nexplosive products is on the order of 10 11 dyne/cm 2 , while the\ndynamic pressure behind the air and helium shocks is approximately 10 10 and 10\n\ndyne/cm 2 respectively. Therefore, the drag\n\nforces differ by at least an order of magnitude between the \t\nexplosive products and the shocked driver gas.\nThe air and helium shock velocities can be applied in various\nsimplified one-dimensional theories to analyze the state of the\njetting gases. The result of this effort is not consistent with\nthe average jet density calculated by the method of subsection\n2.2. The simplest explanation for this discrepancy is that the\njet has a strong two-dimensional character. In particular, jet\ndensity must vary fairly sharply in the axial direction.\n3.4 EXPERIMENTS 1.14 THROUGH 1.16 - VARIATION OF EXPLOSIVE\nMATERIAL\nIn order to vary the explosive material, charges of Composition C-4 were used. Composition C-4 has a detonation velocity\nof 8.0 km/sec and should produce higher velocity projectiles\nthan Detatube for a comparable acceleration path. In addition,\nthe angular dispersion might be reduced by careful preparation\nand packing of the charge. The instrumentation for this series\nof experiments was identical to that used for shots 1.3 to 1.10.\nThe first experiment (shot 1.14), with a 40-cm run-in and an\n8-cm acceleration path, produced a projectile traveling at 10.0\nkm/sec, measured by the high-speed framing camera record. The\nprojectile, initially a 1.6-mm-d\'-ameter sphere of annealed 52100\nsteel, was ablated to approximately 50 percent of the original\n\nE-\n\n25\n\n!-\n\nPIFR-269\n\ndiameter and had an angular divergence of 4 degrees. A view of\nthe projectile moving down the range as photographed by the\nframing camera is shown in Figure 11. A careful analysis of the\nframing camera record demonstrated that the projectile broke up\nduring the launch cycle. This is shown by several. very faint\nstreaks which move down the range on different tx-ajectories than\nthe main projectile. These other particles hav ,.: an extremely\nsmall mass since they do not appear on the flash radiographs and\nslow down very quickly. This form of projectile break-up is,\nhowever, a minor problem.\n\n4\nAir\nSOfiuck\n\nJetting\t\nGases\t\n\na\n\nIV\n\ni\n\n1\nI\n\n`a\n\nExplosive\nProducts\n\nDownrange\n-\xe2\x96\xba\n\nFigure 11 Framing camera record from shot 1.14.\n\n26\n\nProjectile\n\nPIFR-269\n\nThe second test with C-4 had a longer acceleration path\n(12 cm) and significant projectile integrity problems. Multiple\ncraters were produced by this shot, and the various projectile\nparts can be seen very clearly in the framing camera record\n(see Figure 12).

Projectile\nhas broken up during the launch cycle.\n\nAs the environment of the C-4 accelerator appeared to be\ntoo severe for the annealed 52100 steel, a two-stage launcher\nwas designed. The first stage used Detatube with a 40-cm run-in\nand an 8-cm acceleration path, joined to a 20-cm extension of\npacked C-4. No projectile emerged and it is thought t,.at\nangular divergence caused the projectile to leave the main jetting\ngases, to slow down, and to be overtaken by the detonation wave.\n\n27\n\ni\n\nPIFR-269\n\n3.5 EXPERIMENTS 1.17 THROUGH 1.19 - VARIATION; OF C/AjAND\nPROJECTILE DIAMETER\nRather than continue investigating a twe-stage driver, a\nsimple alternative method for reducing the initial loading on\nthe projectile was to reduce the jet density. This can be\nf\n\naccomplished by lowering the charge wall thickness, i.e., the\nparameter C/A j , the ratio of the charge mass per unit length\n\n15\n\nto jet area ratio. The elementary theory of subsection 2.1\nindicates that the jet density is directly proportional to C/Aj\nfor the fully expanded jet.\nShots 1.17 and 1.18 used C--4 explosive and had a C/A j of\n12.7 and 8.4, respectively. These values may be compared to\nexperiment 1.14 with a C/A j of 16.1. The configuration of these\nshots with respect to instrumentation, total charge length, and\nprojectile position was identical to shot 1.14. The projectiles\nof neither shot maintained physical integrity. Each experiment\nhad two craters in the target and two trails in the framing\n\nI.\nif\n\ncamera record.\nDetails of the projectile velocities and dispersions may be\nfound in subsection 3.6. The predicted proportionality between\nC/Aj and the jet density vas maintained between shots 1.14 and\n1.17 but not for shot 1.18.\nThe final experiment in the program varied the projectile\ndiameter with a 1-mm-diameter annealed 52100 steel sphere in a\nDetatube accelerator. The run-in and acceleration path were\n40 cm and 8 cm, respectively, while instrumentation was identical\nwith that of shots 1.3 through 1.10. Again the projectile broke\nup, producing two craters and a double trail on the framing\n\n28\n\nPIFR-269\n\ncamera record. This was the only time Detatube caused a projectile to break up in this way. This may have been caused by the\nprojectile being accelerated through more projectile diameters\nwithin the explosive charge. This should produce more heating\nand a weaker projectile and could cause break up.\n3.6 SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe following table presents the results of all experiments\nperformed during this program. The purpose and instrumentation\nof each shot may be found in Appendix A. Unless otherwise noted,\nall projectiles were 1.6-mm diameter spher ,;s, and :il experiments\nwere fired in a.nbient air.\nThe parameter k and jet density wf.re calculated by the method\noutlined in subsection 2.2, where a j ,et velocity equal to twice \t\nthe detonation velocity has been asssmee.. Thus, jet velocities\nwere 14.2 km/sec and 16.1 km/sec fcr Detatube and C-4, respectively.\nThe average jet density for shots rsing Detatube is 0.06 gram/cc,\nq uite close to the published Rus:A an result of 0.0605 gram/cc.\nExperiments with C-4 yielded hagher jet densities due to the\nsevere projectile ablation and break up, requiring an effective\nprojectile diameter to be used in the calculations. No attempt\nwas made to take this into account.\n\n29\n\n3\n\nPIFR-269\nd\nN\nN\nW\t\n\nN\ny N\n\t\n\nw E\nq\n\na P\nY q\t\n\nr.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 3\n\n, gy p\n\nw\n\n.y\n\n3\ny\n\nq4\n\nyYy,\nE \'O\n\n^\n\nY -.^\t\n\n3 U\n\n^` C\n\nL^\t\n\nL^\n\nWd\n\n01 4\t\n\n>\n\ncv\n\nq.,\n\nm\xc2\xb0\n\n^\t \'^\t\n\n^ w\n\nL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2O 4\n4 ^\'\nO\n\nv\n\nW\n\nun\n\ncu\n^ O\n\n3\nV \'O\n^..r\n\n7\n\nAN\n\nN .,y\n\nP u\n^ ^\n\nW\n3\n\n3\n\nd\n\n3\n\nO\n\nw\n\nO 01\n\n3\n\nO^\n\nN 3\n\nu a\n\nJ q\t\n\nq\n\nc\n\nOHO\n\n^\n\nU u\t\n\nv\n7\n\n^. c\n\nw W\t\n\nw 0\n\nO.\n\nW\n\n4\n\na\n\nu O\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.1 4\n3q\n\nq\t 3\n9 v\t\n\nr0 3\nVW\n\nO\nzo\n\n0!\n^\n\n0\n\nO 7\ny y\n^.

The average jet density calculated from experiments\n1.3 through 1.10 was within several percent of the value\ndetermined by the Russian investigators.\nd.\n\nBoundary layer effects are unimportant for accelerators\nup to 50 charge diameters in length. Standard accelerators during the program were less than 40 diameters in\nlength.\n\ne.\n\nThe jet of a Detatube charge was found to be highly\nunsymmetric across a given cross section\n\nf.\n\n\t analysis of the gasdynamics\nSimnlifi pd one-di\nof the jet failed to give results compatible with a\njet density calculated as outlinad in subsection 2.2.\n\ng.\n\nThe angular divergence of the projectiles was not reduced\nby a variety of projectile suspension techniques and\nexplosive initiation methods.\n\nh.\n\nThe maximum velocity achieved was 10 km/sec.\n\nl\n32\n\nPIFR-269\n\nThe drag accelerator appears capable of higher velocities\nthan 10 km/sec with further development. Additional work is\nnecessary to find an improved projectile material and to reduce\nangular dispersion. The Russians claim to have successfully\nsolved these two problems, and it seems probably that the material properties difficulties can be overcome by testing a wide\nvariety of steels. A cast and machined, high-quality explosive\nshould be tested to attempt to improve the uniformity of the jet\nand to reduce th\xe2\x80\xa2: angular dispersion.\n\n33\n\nPIFR-269\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nV.
