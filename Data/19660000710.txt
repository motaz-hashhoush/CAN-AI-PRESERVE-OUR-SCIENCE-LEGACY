In the particular situation there\nwas limited space for mounting any mechanism on the\ndoorjamb or wall. Also the drive system had to be\nsuch that (I) it could be manually operated and (2) if\nthe door were jammed the drive system would not be\ndamaged.\nThe solution:\nA standard motor reducer unit is mounted on the\ndoor. This reducer drives a sprocket which is linked by\nchain to a fixed sprocket of the same size on the door\njamb.\nHow it's done:\nThe drive consists of a standard motor reducer unit\nmounted on the door, using a suitable supporting\n\nbracket. A sprocket is mounted on a torque limiter\nattached to the output of the reducer. Another\nsprocket of the same size is mounted on a bracket\nfixed to the door jamb and is locked in the bracket\nto prevent it from rotating. A roller chain is fitted\naround the sprockets, using a turnbuckle to take up\nthe slack. Limit switches are arranged to function at\nthe open and closed positions of the door so as to\nstop the motor drive at the extreme of the door\nmotion. In operation, the door will swing in a direction opposite to that of the reducer output shaft. If a\nsizable object obstructs the door when it is moving,\nthe torque limiter will slip and the door can stop,\neven though the motor continues to operate. The same\nprotection functions when the door does not stop on\nreaching one of the limit switch trip points, in the\nevent a limit switch should fail.\n(continued Ovetleji)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the Atomic liability resulting from the use of the information contained in this\nEnergy Commission and/or the National Aeronautics and Space document, or warrants that the use of any information, apparatus,\nAdministration.

The door may then be\nopened or closed manually. The locking bolt on the\nwall-mounted sprocket can be removed, permitting\nthis sprocket to rotate and permit the same result. In\nthis case the torque setting is not disturbed.\nNotes:\n1. The major components of this type of motor drive\nconsist' entirely of standard commercially available\nitems.\n*\t\n\nBrief 66-10712\t\n\n2.
