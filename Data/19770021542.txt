A pressure plate\nis disposed relatively opposite each of the working\nfaces of the housing and is spaced from the corresponding working face such that a gap is defined between\neach associated working face and pressure plate when\nthe housing is centered with respect to the pressure\nplates. Means are also provided for introducing fluid\nunder pressure into @e gaps to form supporting hydrostatic films between Qe working faces and the pressure\nplates such that the housing may be suspended between\nthe pressure plates in spaced relationship thereto.\nAdvantageously, at least one of the pressure plates is\nmovable to provide adjustment of the thickness of the\ngaps and thereby to vary the damping characteristic of\nthe supporting film. Additionally, or alternatively, the\nmeans for introducing fluid under pressure is controllable to adjust the pressure of the supporting film and\nthereby vary its stiffness. In addition, the gap-facing\nsurface of each pressure plate preferably includes at\nleast two recessed pockets may comprise rows of orifice restrictors.\nIn accordance with the invention, a hydrostatic bearing system is thus provided which enables one to\nreadily adjust the thickness of the supporting hydrostatic films and hence to adjust the dynamic damping\ncharacteristics of the supporting fdms. In addition, the\nbearing system enables one selectively to vary the pressure and thus the stiffness of the film in a particular\narea of the bearing support. Further, the dynamic characteristics of the supporting film may be \xe2\x80\x9ctuned\xe2\x80\x9d without interrupting the operation of the rotating equipment, allowing adjustment of the bearing support system to varying operating conditions. As a result, both\nthe threshold and amplitude of non-synchronous, selfexcited, rotor precession and synchronous, externally\nexited rotor precession can be controlled. Further, the\npolygonal geometry eliminates the need for additional\nrotation-controlling structure.\nOther features and advantages of the invention will\nbe set forth in, or apparent from, the detailed description of a preferred embodiment found hereinbelow.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nIt is common, particularly in the small, lightweight,\nhigh speed turbomachines which are increasingly being\nused in a variety of applications, to encounter one or\nmore system resonances in accelerating the rotating 20\ncomponents to design speed. If conventional rigid bearing supports are used, the rotating components must be\ncarefully balanced in order for the machinery to pass\nthrough the critical speeds with minimum excursion of\nthe rotating members. However, with high operating 25\nspeeds of many turbomachines, which speeds may be in\nthe range of 36,000 rpm, even relatively small imbalances in rotating components will produce excessive\nvibration.\nMuch attention has been devoted to developing so- 30\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cflexible\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d bearing supports, .Le., supports which have a stiffness much less than that of the\nbearings. Further, since an undamped flexible support\nsystem is highly sensitive to external shocks, various\ndamping mechanisms have also been developed.\n35\nIn order to overcome the disadvantage associated\nwith conventional flexible supports such as rubber 0rings, springs, diaphragms, and the like, and with conventional damping methods such as the use of lubricating oils and elastomers (see, e.g., the U.S. Pat. No. 40\n3,097,167,to Beyerle), hydrostatic bearing systems\nhave been developed. Although this listing is not, nor is\nit intended to be, exhaustive, such hydrostatic bearings\nare illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,049,383 (Loch);\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n3,442,560(de Gast); and 3,499,691(Baier).

The support system,\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n60 generally denoted 10, basically comprises a bearing\nThese and other disadvantages of the prior art are\nhousing 20 and a plurality of pressure plates 40.\novercome by a hydrostatic support system constructed\nHousing 20 is adapted to receive a rotor 50 and a\nconventional bearing assembly 60. A journal bearing is\naccording to the present invention. The system of the\npresent invention comprises a bearing housing in which\ndepicted, but a roller-element bearing, or any other\nthe bearings are disposed, and a plurality of associated 65 type of fluid film bearing, may also be used. The outer\npressure plates. The bearing housing has a substantially\nsurface configuration of housing 20, as viewed in transverse cross-section perpencicular to the axis of rotation\npolygonal outer surface configuration as viewed in\ntransverse cross-section perpendicular to the axis of\nof rotor 50 is non-circular and preferably polygonal, In\n\n3\n\n4,035,03 7\n\nthe embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the outer surface of\nhousing 20 is shaped such that there are three planar,\noutwardly facing, working faces 22 symmetrically disposed with respect to the longitudinal axis of housing\n20. The outer surface of housing 20 may also be pro- 5\nvided with connecting faces 24, as shown. It is to be\nnoted that the number of working faces 22 is not limited to three, nor are connecting faces 24 required. An\nembodiment of support system 10 having a square\nhousing 20 without connecting faces is illustrated in 10\nFIG. 2. Other polygonal geometries may be used as\nwell.\nReferring again to FIG. 1, pressure plates 40 are\ndisposed relatively opposite the corresponding working\nfaces 22 and are spaced therefrom such that gaps 42 15\nare defined therebetween when housing 20 is centered\nwith respect to pressure plates 40. At least one pressure\nplate 40 is movable, as indicated by the doubleheaded\narrow A, to adjust the thickness of gaps 42 during operation of support system 10, as will be explained in more 20\ndetail hereinbelow. An embodiment of support system\n10 wherein a plurality of pressure plates 40 are movable is illustrated in FIG. 2.\nWith further reference to FIG. 1, the gap defining\nfaces of pressure plates 40 are provided with at least 25\ntwo recessed pockets. 44 communicating through orifice 46 with a supply chamber 48 of high pressure fluid,\nindicated by P. Orifices 46 act as flow restrictors and\n,\nprovide each pocket 44 with a pressure above the ambient, indicated by Po. A hydrostatic film is thus formed 30\nbetween the working faces 22 and pressure plates 40\nwhich serves to support or suspend housing 20 in\nspaced relationship between pressure plates 40. In an\nalternative embodiment, pocket 44 may comprise rows\n35\nof orifice restrictors (not shown).\nConventional feedback control means (not shown),\nincorporating sensing elements such as non-contacting\ndisplacement probes, force transducers, accelerometers, and the like, may be provided to adjust pressure Po\nand the thickness of gaps 42.\n40\nIn operation, when eccentricities in rotor 50 cause\nrotor 50 to orbit about the center of bearing 60, housing 20 will tend to follow. The motion of housing 90 is\nresisted by the forces of the hydrostatic supporting\nfilms resulting from the non-circular geometry of hous- 45\ning 50 and the multiple pressure plates 40. Further\nstabilization of housing 50 is provided by pockets 44.\nThe slight oscillatory motion produced in housing 20 as\nrotor 50 begins to rotate produces a squeeze film\ndamping force which tends to damp out rotor oscilla- 50\ntions. By adjusting the pressure plate(s) 40 which is\n(are) movable, the thickness of gaps 42, and thus of the\nhydrostatic supporting films, may be varied. The feature of providing an adjustable film thickness allows the\ndamping coefficient of the supporting film to be con- 55\ntrolled. Further, by adjusting film pressure Po, stiffthe\nness of the supporting film may also be varied. As a\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\nconsequence, the dynamic characteristics of System 10\nmay be \xe2\x80\x9ctuned\xe2\x80\x9d to minimize the amplitudes of either\nsynchronous or non-synchronous rotor vibrations without stopping rotation of rotor 50.\nIt will also be appreciated that the hydrostatic bearing support system of the present invention may be\nused with appropriate conventional instrumentation to\ndetermine the dynamic stiffness and damping properties of particular gas films. To do this, the dynamic\ndisplacement of housing 20 relative to each of the pressure plates 40 is measured for predetermined speeds of\nrotor 50, along with the phase angle between the forces\nproduced by rotor unbalance and the associated displacement of housing 20.\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that\nalthough the invention has been described relative to\nexemplary embodiments thereof, modifications and\nvariations can be effected in these embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.\nI claim:\n1.
