Barrows\nAmes Research Center\nABSTRACT\n\nA PCM telemetry command system is presented having a capacity of 256\nunique commands, an end-to-end actuation time of less than 250 milliseconds,\nand an address plus complementary command code to provide security against\nthe acceptance of anything but intended commands. The system consists of a\nground-based ENCODER and a balloon-borne DECODER, both built using lowcurrent drain, high reliability CMOS logic elements. Commands are\nnormally issued by a simple switch closure to +5VDC on the appropriate input line, however as a backup mode, the 8-bit command may be entered\nmanually on 8 toggle switches and executed via a SEND button. In any case,\nthe command is then serialized into a B10-L PCM bit stream and sent via a\nP-Band radio link to the DECODER aloft. All 256 outputs from the DECODER\nare buffered through drivers and thus may be used to drive CMOS, TTL, or\nDTL logic.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt the inception of the AIROscope redesign effort an attempt was made,\nprimarily through the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), to\ndetermine what command subsystems had been used in the past on balloon\nsystems. It was found that, in general, the systems in use suffered from\nexcessive operational complexity, restricted capability in terms of the\ntotal number of discrete commands which could be delivered, and they were\nnot sufficiently generalized to permit the flexibility required by a\nconstantly changing mission science program.\nConsequently, it was determined that a Command Encoder-Decoder system\nwould be built in-house using the latest mil-spec temperature range, low\ncurrent CMOS logic elements. The 256 commands provided by a system based\non an 8-bit command word were considered more than adequate for all\ncurrently planned AIROscope missions and sufficient to permit a reasonable\ndegree of expansion on foreseeable future missions. Beyond that, two or\nmore such systems operated in parallel could clearly provide nearly unlimited expansion capability, if desired. The parts cost for this system\nwas less than $2500 and the required delivery schedule for all hardware was\nmet.\nENCODER DESCRIPTION\n\nThe various functions performed by the Command Encoder may be understood by referring to the Functional Diagram in Figure 1. In addition, a\ndetailed Schematic Diagram is provided in Figure 2 for the convenience of\nthe reader who would actually like to construct a similar system for his\nown use.\nReferring to the functional diagram, the first function within the\ndashed outline enclosing the Command Encoder itself is the Diode Matrix.\n5.3-1\n309\n\nEXPERIMENTER\'S CONSOLE\n(256 LIGHTED PUSHBUTTONS)\nCOMMAND\nVERIFICATIONS\n\nr\n\n~i\nDIODE\nMATRIX\nPCM DATA\nDECOMMUTATOR\nBACK-UP TOGGLE SWITCHES\n\nI\n\n-\\\nV\n\n"SENT"\nDISPLAY\n\nCOMPARATOR\n\nADDRESS\nGENERATOR\n\nCLOCK\n\n1\n\n"RCVD"\nDISPLAY\n\n8-BIT\n.

The Backup Toggle Switches permit the operator to bypass the\nExperimenter\'s Console and the Diode Matrix and to generate a command\ndirectly by switching in the desired 8 command bits and by pressing the\nSEND button. Regardless of how these 8 bits are generated, they are then\nentered into the Storage Flip-Flops, the outputs of which are routed to the\nSENT Display, to the Digital Comparator for comparison with the latest\ncommand received by the gondola (RCVD), and to the Parallel-to-Serial Converter. The 8 command bits, along with their complements and an 8-bit\nrecognition address word are simultaneously loaded into the Parallel-toSerial Converter and clocked out at a rate of 256 bits per second. Every\n1/8 second the Clock also updates the Storage Flip-Flops and loads the\nParallel-to-Serial Converter. The now serialized NRZ-L bit stream is\nconverted into a Bi0-L PCM code to improve the reliability of transmission\nand to permit direct tape recording. Finally it goes through a buffer stage\nwhere it is made compatible with the input of the Command Transmitter. This\nup-link UHF transmitter operates in the P-band and develops 10 watts of r.f.\npower.\nTwo different levels of command verification are provided by the AIROscope system. One results from the comparison of the SENT command with\nthe RCVD command in the Command Encoder itself where any disagreement\nbetween the two results in the lighting of the ERROR lamp. A second type\nof command verification is provided for the AIROscope via the PCM Data Subsystem wherein up to 110 discrete "on-off" digital data channels may be\nemployed to monitor the status of various commandable subsystems on the\ngondola. These status indications are used to light the appropriate pushbuttons on the Experimenter\'s Console to immediately feed back to the\noperator the information that the command sent was properly received and\nthat the system to which the command was issued did, in fact, respond.\nIt is important to note that the Encoder is continually encoding some\ncommand, i.e., when no command button is being pressed, the command 000 is\nsent. This command is processed like any other command on the gondola and\nits output may be used as a "reset" or a "ready" indication. Even more\nimportant is the fact that such an arrangement permits one to check at any\ntime on the continuity of all major links in both the Command Subsystem and\nthe PCM Data Subsystem by simply observing the status of the ERROR lamp.\nDECODER DESCRIPTION\n\nThe functions performed by the Command Decoder are depicted in Figures\n3 and 4. On the gondola the P-Band signal is received by the Command\nReceiver, buffered to re-create a signal with 0 and 5 volt levels, and reconverted from Bi0-L to NRZ-L plus a clock line. The NRZ-L bit stream is\nthen clocked into the Serial-to-Parallel Converter, the contents of which\nare constantly being examined by the Valid Command Recognition circuitry.\nThis circuitry verifies that each command bit is immediately preceded by\nits complement and that these 16 bits are followed by the correct 8-bit\nrecognition address code. If, and only if, all these criteria are met, a\n"Load" pulse is generated which loads this 8-bit command into a set of 8\n\n5.3-4\n312\n\nP-BAND\nCOMMAND\nRECEIVER\n\nBUFFER\n\nBi 0-L/NRZ-L\nCONVERTER\nCLOCK\n\nSERIAL-TO-PARALLEL CONVERTER\n\nVALfD\nCOMMAND\nRECOGNITION\n\n"LOAD"\nPCM\nDATA\nCOMMUTATOR\n\n8 BIT BINARY-TO-256 LINE\nDECODER\nCOMMAND\nVERIFICATIONS\n\n256 DRIVERS\n\nCOMMANDED\nGONDOLA SUBSYSTEMS\nFigure 3.\n\nCommand Decoder Functional Diagram\n\n5.3-5\n313\n\n5.3-6\n314\n\nSC7>\n(O\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-\n\no\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\xa2)->\n(O\n\nO\n\noo\nsOJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa7\no\n\nI\nen\n\nlatches which are examined 8 times per second by the PCM Data Commutator\nfor transmission to the ground as the RCVD command. The "Load" pulse\nalso enters the 8-bit command into the 8 Bit Binary-to-256 Line Decoder\nwhich routes the command to the proper one of the 256 possible lines as\ndictated by the 8-bit binary command number. Each output line is buffered\nthrough a CMOS driver so that it is capable of interfacing with CMOS, TTL,\nor DTL 5 volt logic systems.\nPERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhenever a command is issued by the operator, the time required for it\nto be encoded, placed on the serial bit stream, and transmitted to the\ngondola is between 125 and 250 milliseconds. This is due to the fact that,\nif the command button is pressed sometime during the clocking out of the\nParallel-to-Serial Converter, one must wait up to 125 milliseconds for the\ndesired command to be loaded into the Converter. Then, another 125 milliseconds is required for the clocking out of one complete \'command plus\naddress1 sequence. Essentially simultaneously with the generation of this\nfirst complete \'command plus address1 sequence, the decoder in the gondola\nis clocking it into its Serial-to-Parallel Converter. Thus, by the time\nthe command is fully serialized on the ground, it has also been entered\ninto the Decoder aloft, verified as a valid command, and directed as a +5\nvolt logic level to the appropriate gondola subsystem. At most an additional\n125 milliseconds is required for either of the two previously mentioned\nlevels of command verification to be telemetered via the PCM Data Subsystem\nback to the ground station. Thus, the maximum total time required for the\nissuance and final verification of a typical command is 375 milliseconds.\nWhen the operator presses a command button and holds it in, the\nappropriate output line on the gondola will rise to a +5 volt level and,\nin the absence of telemetry drop-outs, will stay at +5 volts until the\ncommand button is released (at which time command 000 is decoded). The\nshortest command which can be given lasts 125 milliseconds. The longest\ncommand is indefinite, however, it must be noted that the characteristics\nof this design dictate that ONLY ONE command may be given at a time. If two\ndifferent commands were given simultaneously, a third command, most likely\nunrelated to either, would probably be generated. This caveat turns out not\nto be too restrictive but it does present some operational constraints which\nmust be reflected in the design of the overall Control and Data system. If\nit is desired that a gondola subsystem be activated for more than a few\nseconds, a latch may be built into that subsystem and two commands may be\nassigned, one to set the latch and another to reset it.\nThe availability of only 8 command bits at a time also has system\ndesign implications. For example, one cannot simply command a motor\nto position a shaft to one of several thousand possible orientations. What\nmust be done is to have one command which rotates the shaft, another command\nto stop its rotation, and a 10-bit telemetry word which reports back to the\nground station operator the exact orientation of the shaft. This method\nof achieving precise control over subsystems on the gondola has proved to be\ntotally acceptable for the implementation of all investigations proposed\nthus far for the AIROscope.\nAn additional and particularly useful feature of this design is that\nthe Command Encoder and the Command Decoder may be connected directly\n5.3-7\n315\n\ntogether with a single BNC coaxial cable (bypassing the r.f. link) for use\nduring pre-flight ground testing. The Encoder can thus function independently of the rest of the ground station, as a piece of ground support\nequipment with which any of the 256 commands can be generated and the\ndesired gondola subsystems exercised.\n\n5.3-8\n316\n\n5.3-9\n317\n\nDISCUSSION SUWARY - PAPER 5.3\nNo discussion.\n\n5.3-10\n318\n\n'
