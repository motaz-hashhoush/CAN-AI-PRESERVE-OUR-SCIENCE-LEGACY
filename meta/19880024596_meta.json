This study considers the use of the Schwarz resonant converter for use as the basic building block to accomplish this low-to-high voltage conversion for either a dc or an ac spacecraft bus. The Schwarz converter has the important assets of both inherent fault tolerance and resonant operation; parallel operation in modular form is possible. A regulated dc spacecraft bus requires only a single stage converter while a constant frequency ac bus requires a cascaded Schwarz converter configuration. If the power system requires constant output power from the dc generator, then a second converter is required to route unneeded power to a ballast load.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880024596, "endDate": "1987-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IECEC ''87", "location": "Philadelphia, PA", "id": "6aee052c33ca46e9adc5aa98890fc82e", "startDate": "1987-08-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880024596, "id": "2ec9b76949fe48c8879ea8de78cf0780", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
