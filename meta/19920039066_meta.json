These techniques allow HONNs to be used with the larger input scenes required for practical pattern-recognition applications. The number of interconnections that must be stored has been reduced by a factor of approximately 200,000 in a T/C case and about 2000 in a Space Shuttle/F-18 case by using regional connectivity. Third-order networks have been simulated using several connection strategies. The method found to work best is regional connectivity. The main advantages of this strategy are the following: (1) it considers features of various scales within the image and thus gets a better sample of what the image looks like; (2) it is invariant to shape-preserving geometric transformations, such as translation and rotation; (3) the connections are predetermined so that no extra computations are necessary during run time; and (4) it does not require any extra storage for recording which connections were formed.", "title": "Connectivity strategies for higher-order neural networks applied to pattern recognition", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920039066, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spirkovska, Lilly"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "33665e134da04a3daed80f875f0b2979"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920039066, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reid, Max B."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d3758082eefc44f79eeb7863077c0518"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920039066, "endDate": "1990-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "IEEE"}}, "meetingId": "6eb999fb41f649ac9cd8ca9402a8e405", "id": "235776674d6c417d8d175285d99cbb32"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Nueral Network Society"}}, "meetingId": "6eb999fb41f649ac9cd8ca9402a8e405", "id": "b6442d27c3d7434ebe0adc5db9c4fe90"}], "name": "IJCNN - International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "6eb999fb41f649ac9cd8ca9402a8e405", "startDate": "1990-06-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19920039066, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920039066, "id": "f0ab63cc5c3747d4ab2c1d57de8214d8", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
