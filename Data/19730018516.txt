This has\nbeen reported in correspondence and in a meeting at GSFC on March 1, 1973.\nIn an effort to minimize all expenditures we have held up analysis\nof the I2 S aircraft imagery and the ERTS-1 imagery until we accomplished\na reliable print out of the precision tapes of the one scene of St. Thomas,\n#1086-14162. The objective is to locate and record those anomalies appearing on ERTS-1 data for the harbor area, and then correlate aircraft I2 S\nand ground in-situ data with these specific ERTS-1 boundaries. This\nprocedure will minimize the amount of I2 S and in-situ data used for correlation. Our computer engineers have been in direct contact with their\nopposite members at GSFC in an effort to resolve problems of geometric\naccuracy of the precision tape print out. Resolution by telephone is not\npromising and we have scheduled a conference at GSFC for 24 April 1973.\nPresent status of the program may be briefly stated as follows:\n- Computer processing of water quality data except Precision\nTapes has been completed.\n-\n\nPrecision tapes were received by Grumman Ecosystems Corporation\ns\non 19 March 1973. After several attempts to proc\n.\na meeting at GSFC has been scheduled for April\nC-\n\nC\n\nSubsidiaries:\n\n* PURITECH\n\nINDUSTRIES.

Plots of\nvelocity vectors for desired times remain to be accomplished.\n\n-\n\nDr. D. Olsen, MRDF, has completed approximately 80%0 of the task\nof organizing and evaluating the computer print outs of water\nquality data.\n\n-\n\n2\n\nThe I2S projector was received on February 22nd on a two month\nlease. A-cursory examination of all the I2 S imagery was made,\nthose scenes of the St. Thomas harbor, optical targets, and\nsample stations were catalogued and the outstanding anomalies\nlisted for later more detailed densitometric measurements.\nColor 35 mm photographs of these scenes were made for future\nreference. The projector Was returned on March 30, 1973.\n(Costs were prorated for five weeks rather than two months.)\n\nTasks remaining to completion:\nPrecision tape print outs. The first tape print out showed\nvariances of 13 counts in a total range of 128. These small\ndifferences in radiance values are difficult to detect in the\nimagery and constitute justification for using precision tapes,\nassuming geometric problems can be resolved.\n-\n\nWater current plots for those specific time periods selected\nfor correlation, in order to understand the mass movement of\nthe harbor waters.\n\n-\n\nMRDF, Dr. David Olsen, analysis of the data print outs to develop\nwater quality and biological trends. (Analysis of variables was\naccomplished, but factor analysis of some of the data, although\ndesirable, might be omitted for lack of funds.)\n\n-\n\nDensitometric measurement of a small portion of the ERTS 1 scene\n#1087-14162) as a check on geometric accuracy of the precision\ntape print outs.\n\n-\n\nEstablish the degree of correlation existing in the foregoing.\nIn general this would be accomplished by following the Flow\nDiagram, Figure 1 of the Six Month Report.\n\n-\n\nWrite Final Report.\n\n,1\n\n-\n\nGEC73L-295\n23 April 1973\n\nGRUMMAN\n\nPAGE\n\n3\n\nWe intend to submit a revised estimate to completion after we obtain\na valid precision tape print out. We feel that such a print out will\nenable us to pinpoint the exact geographic locations for correlation and\nthereby minimize the costs and still result in a final report with substantiated conclusions.\nYours very truly,\nGRUMMAN ECOSYSTEMS CORPORATION\n\nW.
