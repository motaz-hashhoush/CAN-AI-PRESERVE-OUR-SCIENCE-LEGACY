These values are conventionally measured using hot film nickel sensors deposited on a polyimide substrate. The substrate electrically insulates the sensor and underlying airfoil but is prevented from thermally isolating the sensor by thickness constraints necessary to avoid flow contamination. Proposed heating of the model surface is difficult to control, requires significant energy expenditures, and may alter the basic flow state of the airfoil. A temperature responsive sensor is located in the airflow over the specified surface of a body and is maintained at a constant temperature. An active thermal isolator is located between this temperature responsive sensor and the specific surface of the body. The total thickness of the isolator and sensor avoid any contamination of the flow. The temperature of this isolator is controlled to reduce conductive heat flow from the temperature responsive sensor to the body. This temperature control includes (1) operating the isolator at the same temperature as the constant temperature of the sensor; and (2) establishing a fixed boundary temperature which is either less than or equal to, or slightly greater than the sensor constant temperature. The present invention accordingly thermally isolates a temperature responsive sensor in an energy efficient, controllable manner while avoiding any contamination of the flow.", "title": "Active thermal isolation for temperature responsive sensors", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T12:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940030568, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Martinson, Scott D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "a06deab58202427e86a20b67186a84e2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940030568, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gray, David L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "daad7906ac504b4ea7cd267bfc962fa0"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940030568, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carraway, Debra L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "3ab577f4a23746aeb1f7f2059f2aa4a5"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940030568, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reda, Daniel C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "d25c273a707a40b7bad5ecf1bd2872ea"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940030568, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940030568, "id": "7bf4de982ddf463f91179793dc38c308", "publicationDate": "1994-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"type": "SUPERSEDED_BY", "accessionNumber": "N92-29954"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940030568.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940030568/downloads/19940030568.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940030568/downloads/19940030568.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940030568/downloads/19940030568.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
