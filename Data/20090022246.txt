b'Space-Based Range\nSpace-Based Range (SBR), previously known as Space-Based Telemetry and Range Safety\n(STARS), is a multicenter NASA proof-of-concept project to determine if space-based\ncommunications using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) can\nsupport the Range Safety functions of acquiring tracking data and generating flight\ntermination signals, while also providing broadband Range User data such as voice, video, and\nvehicle/payload data.\n\nGlobal Positioning\nSystem (GPS)\nMetric Tracking\n\nThere was a successful test of the Range Safety system at Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) on\nDecember\xc2\xa020,\xc2\xa02005, on a two-stage Terrier-Orion spin-stabilized sounding rocket. SBR transmitted\nGPS tracking data and maintained links with two TDRSS satellites simultaneously during the\n10\xe2\x80\x91min flight. The payload section deployed a parachute, landed in the Atlantic Ocean about\n90 miles downrange from the launch site, and was successfully recovered.\nDuring the Terrier-Orion tests flights, more than 99\xc2\xa0percent of all forward commands and more than\n95\xc2\xa0percent of all return frames were successfully received and processed. The time latency necessary\nfor a command to travel from WFF over landlines to White Sands Complex and then to the vehicle\nvia TDRSS, be processed onboard, and then be sent back to WFF was between 1.0\xc2\xa0s and 1.1\xc2\xa0s.\nThe forward-link margins for TDRS\xe2\x80\x9110 (TDRS East [TDE]) were 11\xc2\xa0dB to 12\xc2\xa0dB \xc2\xb12\xc2\xa0dB, and for\nTDRS\xe2\x80\x914 (TDRS Spare [TDS]) were 9\xc2\xa0dB to 10\xc2\xa0dB \xc2\xb11.5\xc2\xa0dB. The return-link margins for both TDE\nand TDS were 6 dB to 8 dB \xc2\xb13 dB.\nThere were 11 flights on an F-15B at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) between November\n2006 and February 2007. The Range User system tested a 184\xe2\x80\x91element TDRSS Ku-band (15\xc2\xa0GHz)\nphased-array antenna with data rates of 5 Mbps and 10 Mbps. This data was a combination of\nblack-and-white cockpit video, Range Safety tracking and transceiver data, and aircraft and antenna\ncontroller data streams. IP data formatting was used. The Range Safety system used the previously\nflown S-band transceiver to validate the forward and return links. Several \xe2\x80\x9cflyaway\xe2\x80\x9d maneuvers tested\nthe transition from launch-head to satellite for the forward\nlinks.\nFigures 1 through 3 show the phased-array antenna mounted\non the F-15 and architecture of the sounding rocket.\nFigure 4 shows the Range User return link margins as\nfunctions of antenna elevation for 5\xe2\x80\x91Mbps and 10\xe2\x80\x91Mbps\nflights. Link margins greater than 9\xc2\xa0dB could not be\nmeasured, so it can only be said that the link margins were\ngreater than 9\xc2\xa0dB for elevations above 30\xc2\xb0.\nDuring the F-15 test flights, custom algorithms used the\nvehicle position and attitude to steer the phased-array\nantenna toward TDRSS West (TDW) at 174\xc2\xb0 W longitude\nwith a pointing error typically much less than 1\xc2\xb0. The\nmeasured data and video latency for the Range User system\nwas about 0.4\xc2\xa0s. More than 99 percent of the Range User\nframes were locked for both 5\xc2\xa0Mbps and 10\xc2\xa0Mbps when the\nantenna azimuth performance was within nominal operating\nparameters and more than 98 percent when these parameters\nwere intentionally exceeded. There was a reasonably smooth\ntransition between the Range Safety launch-head and satellite\nFigure 1. Sounding rocket launch.\n\n68\n\nRange Technologies\n\nFigure 2.

The antenna\npattern of the four S-band telemetry Range Safety\nantennas on the F-15 (two forward and two return, with\none set of each on the top and bottom of the F-15) was\nmeasured at the Benefield Anechoic Facility at DFRC.\nContact: Dr. James C.
