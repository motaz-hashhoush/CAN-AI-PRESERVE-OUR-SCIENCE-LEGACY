b'Software\nMotion-Capture-Enabled\nSoftware for Gestural\nControl of 3D Models\n\nCoNNeCT Baseband\nProcessor Module Boot\nCode SoftWare (BCSW)\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art systems use\ngeneral-purpose input devices such as a\nkeyboard, mouse, or joystick that map to\ntasks in unintuitive ways. This software\nenables a person to control intuitively\nthe position, size, and orientation of synthetic objects in a 3D virtual environment. It makes possible the simultaneous control of the 3D position, scale,\nand orientation of 3D objects using natural gestures.\nEnabling the control of 3D objects\nusing a commercial motion-capture system allows for natural mapping of the\nmany degrees of freedom of the human\nbody to the manipulation of the 3D objects. It reduces training time for this\nkind of task, and eliminates the need to\ncreate an expensive, special-purpose\ncontroller.\nThis work was done by Jeffrey S. Norris, Victor Luo, Thomas M.

A\ncommand and data handling (C&DH)\ninterface is provided via 1553 and diagnostic serial interfaces to invoke operational, reconfiguration, and test commands within the code.\nThe BCSW has features unique to the\nhardware it is responsible for managing.\nIn this case, the CoNNeCT BPM is configured with an updated CPU (Atmel\nAT697 SPARC processor) and a unique\nset of memory and I/O peripherals that\nrequire customized software to operate.\nThese features include configuration of\nnew AT697 registers, interfacing to a\nnew HouseKeeper with a flash controller\ninterface, a new dual Xilinx configuration/scrub interface, and an updated\n1553 remote terminal (RT) core.\nThe BCSW is intended to provide a\n\xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d mode for the BPM when initially\npowered on or when an unexpected trap\noccurs, causing the processor to reset.\nThe BCSW allows the 1553 bus controller\nin the spacecraft or payload controller to\noperate the BPM over 1553 to upload\ncode; upload Xilinx bit files; perform\nrudimentary tests; read, write, and copy\nthe non-volatile flash memory; and configure the Xilinx interface. Commands\nalso exist over 1553 to cause the CPU to\njump or call a specified address to begin\nexecution of user-supplied code. This\nmay be in the form of a real-time operating system, test routine, or specific application code to run on the BPM.\nThis work was done by Clifford K. Yamamoto, David S. Orozco, D. J.

A list of\ntools in Orbit Software Suite represents\ntool versions established during/after\nthe Equipment Rehost-3 Project.\nThis work was done by Cathy Osgood,\nKevin Williams, Philip Gentry, Dana Brownfield, John Hallstrom, and Tim Stuit of\nUnited Space Alliance for Johnson Space Center.

MSC-24956-1\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2012\n\nTrajectory Software With\nUpper Atmosphere Model\nThe Trajectory Software Applications\n6.0 for the Dec Alpha platform has an im-\n\nplementation of the Jacchia-Lineberry\nUpper Atmosphere Density Model used\nin the Mission Control Center for International Space Station support. Previous\ntrajectory software required an upper atmosphere to support atmosphere drag\ncalculations in the Mission Control Center. The Functional operation will differ\ndepending on the end-use of the module.\nIn general, the calling routine will use\nfunction-calling arguments to specify\ninput to the processor. The atmosphere\nmodel will then compute and return atmospheric density at the time of interest.\nThis program was written by Charles Barrett of United Space Alliance, Flight Design\nand Dynamics, for Johnson Space Center For\nfurther information, contact the JSC Innovation Partnerships Office at (281) 483-3809.\nMSC-24250-1\n\nALSSAT Version 6.0\nAdvanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) at the time of this\nreporting has been updated to version\n6.0. A previous version was described in\n\xe2\x80\x9cTool for Sizing Analysis of the Advanced Life Support System\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC23506), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No.\n12 (December 2005), page 43. To recapitulate: ALSSAT is a computer program for sizing and analyzing designs\nof environmental-control and life-support systems for spacecraft and surface\nhabitats to be involved in exploration\nof Mars and the Moon. Of particular\ninterest for analysis by ALSSAT are conceptual designs of advanced life-support (ALS) subsystems that utilize\nphysicochemical\nand\nbiological\nprocesses to recycle air and water and\nprocess human wastes to reduce the\nneed of resource resupply.\nALSSAT is a means of investigating\ncombinations of such subsystems\xe2\x80\x99 technologies featuring various alternative\nconceptual designs and thereby assisting\nin determining which combination is\nmost cost-effective. ALSSAT version 6.0\nhas been improved over previous versions in several respects, including the\nfollowing additions: an interface for\nreading sizing data from an ALS database, computational models of a redundant regenerative CO2 and Moisture Removal Amine Swing Beds (CAMRAS) for\nCO2 removal, upgrade of the Temperature & Humidity Control\xe2\x80\x99s Common\n\n11\n\n'
