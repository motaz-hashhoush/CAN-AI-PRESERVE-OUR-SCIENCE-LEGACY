Since satellite observations are frequent in high-latitude regions, they can be used to detect polar lows and track their propagation and evolution. The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) providing estimates of surface wind speed, integrated cloud liquid water content, water vapor content, and precipitation size ice-scattering signal over the ocean; the Geosat radar altimeter measuring surface wind speed and significant wave height; and the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) allowing the determination of temperature and humidity profiles in the atmosphere have been used in synergy for a specific case which occurred in the Norwegian Sea on January, 23-24 1988. All three instruments show sharp atmospheric gradients associated with the propagation of this low across the ocean, which permit the detection of the polar low at a very early stage and tracking it during its development, propagation, and decay. The wind speed gradients are measured with good qualitative agreement between the altimeter and SSM/I. TOVS retrieved fields prior to the formation of the low confirm the presence of an upper level trough, while during the mature phase baroclinicity can be observed in the 1000-500 hPa geopotential thicknesses.", "title": "Satellite observations of a polar low over the Norwegian Sea by Special Sensor Microwave Imager, Geosat, and TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T02:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930071514, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Claud, Chantal"}, "organization": {"name": "Ecole Polytechnique", "location": "Palaiseau, France"}}, "id": "c02548b1f25c4f6f9c38c71eeee25bb6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930071514, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mognard, Nelly M."}, "organization": {"name": "CNES", "location": "Toulouse, France"}}, "id": "0c41ef39be96484aabd72e8945abdd27"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930071514, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Katsaros, Kristina B."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington Univ.", "location": "Seattle, United States"}}, "id": "d566cc2480684b2ab6133c5ebf412d5a"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19930071514, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chedin, Alain"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "a66b2e903d5049bc9d3cd4448daf3618"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19930071514, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scott, Noelle A."}, "organization": {"name": "Ecole Polytechnique", "location": "Palaiseau, France"}}, "id": "1edfbd33d69b474caca5c99f19144110"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930071514, "publications": [{"volume": "98", "submissionId": 19930071514, "issue": "C8", "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "07c3987577e04a0eb6ddb2b5f9540322", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1993-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
