This study was performed to determine the lowest cost at which chromium and iron chlorides could be obtained for a complex of redox energy storage systems. In addition, since the solutions gradually become intermixed during the course of operation of Redox units, it was an objective to evaluate schemes for regeneration of the operating solutions. Three processes were evaluated for the production of chromium and iron chlorides. As a basis for the preliminary plant design and economic evaluation, it was assumed that the plant would produce about 25,000 tons of contained chromium as CrCl3 and an equivalent molar quantity of FeCl2. Preliminary plant designs, including materials and energy balances and sizing of major equipment, were prepared, and capital and operating costs were estimated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830012088, "id": "08c885631386447f9c0c62d5b5f10884", "publicationDate": "1982-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830012088.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830012088/downloads/19830012088.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830012088/downloads/19830012088.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830012088/downloads/19830012088.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
