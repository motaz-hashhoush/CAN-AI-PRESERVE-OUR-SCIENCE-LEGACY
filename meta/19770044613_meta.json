Relatively low magnitude combined loading of axial compression and torsion resulted in designs using ultrathin faceskins, lightweight honeycomb cores, and thin faceskin/core adhesive bond layers. Two of the designs with metal faceskins (aluminum and titanium) and four with fibrous composite faceskins (using combinations of fiberglass, boron, and graphite) were evaluated through the fabrication and structural test of a series of small development panels. The two most promising concepts with aluminum and graphite/epoxy faceskins, were further evaluated through the fabrication and structural test of larger compression and shear panels. All panels tested exceeded design ultimate load levels, thereby, verifying the structural integrity of the selected designs. Projected skirt structural weights for the graphite/epoxy and aluminum concepts fall within original weight guidelines established for the Space Tug vehicle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19770044613, "endDate": "1976-04-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "National Symposium and Exhibition on Bicentennial of materials progress", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "7375efbd37ee453397d3203ff94cfaa4", "startDate": "1976-04-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770044613, "id": "ed70bb03378e4dfebfe58d58cb4ff3f1", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
