b'in regression rate observed in these fuels,\nand to demonstrate the effect of increased regression rate on hybrid rocket\nmotor performance. At the time of this\nreporting, more than 400 motor tests\nwere conducted with a variety of oxidizers (N2O, GOx, LOx) at ever increasing\nscales with thrust levels from 5 to over\n15,000 pounds (22 N to over 66 kN) in\norder to move this technology from the\nlaboratory to practical applications.\nThe Peregrine program is the natural\nnext step in this development. A number of small sounding rockets with diam-\n\neters of 3, 4, and 6 in. (7.6, 10.2, and\n15.2 cm) have been flown, but Peregrine\nat a diameter of 15 in. (38.1 cm) and\n14,000-lb (62.3-kN) thrust is by far the\nlargest system ever attempted and will be\none of the largest hybrids ever flown.\nSuccessful Peregrine flights will set the\nstage for a wide range of applications of\nthis technology. The metrics of the program are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demonstrate satisfactory motor performance in ground test.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demonstrate motor throttling in\nground test.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fabricate the sounding rocket system, transport it to the NASA\nWallops facility, and launch a payload\nto 100 km using paraffin and N2O as\nthe propellants.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demonstrate operational efficiency at\nthe Wallops launch site.\nThis work was done by Gregory Zilliac of\nAmes Research Center.
