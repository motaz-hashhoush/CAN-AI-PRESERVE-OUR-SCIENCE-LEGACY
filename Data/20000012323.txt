Keith Barker, Walter W. Hankins III, and Richard M. Hueschen\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\n\nAbstract\nTwo NASA goals are to enhance airport safety and to improve capacity in\nall weather conditions.\nThis paper contributes\nto these goals by examining\nspeed guidance profiles to aid a pilot in decelerating\nalong the runway to an\nexit. A speed profile essentially tells the pilot what the airplane\'s speed should\nbe as a function of where the airplane is on the runway. While it is important to\nget off the runway as soon as possible (when striving to minimize runway\noccupancy time), the deceleration along a speed profile should be constrained\nby passenger comfort. Several speed profiles are examined with respect to their\nmaximum decelerations\nand times to reach exit speed. One profile varies speed\nlinearly with distance;\nanother has constant deceleration;\nand two related\nnonlinear profiles delay maximum deceleration\n(braking) to reduce time spent\non the runway.\n\nIntroduction\nAirport\ncongestion\nis a familiar\nsight to\nalmost everyone, especially during holidays and\nin low-visibility\nweather. Without changes, this\nproblem\nwill only get worse. Consequently,\nNASA is currently looking at ways to expedite\nairport traffic by deploying new technology that\nwill allow airplanes to takeoff and land in fog\nand other poor weather conditions.\nAmong the\nmany influential factors, the one of interest here\nis the time a landing airplane spends on the\nrunway.\nToday, there are no rules or procedures\nto\nreduce runway occupancy\ntime (ROT), nor is\nthere any specific on-board system to give pilots\nguidance in decelerating an airplane to an exit or\nfor steering\nthe airplane\noff the runway.\nIn\nparticular, in low-visibility\nweather, the lack of\nout-the-window\nspeed and location cues and\nother information\nreadily increases\nthe time\nrequired for this rollout and turnoff (ROTO)\nphase of landing.\nOne goal of NASA\'s Low\nVisibility\nLanding\nand Surface\nOperations\n\n(LVLASO) program is to address these concerns\nand enhance safety by creating procedures\nand\nguidance\nsystems to maintain\na clear-weather\nrunway capacity even in low-visibility weather.\nThis paper analyzes different speed profiles\nthat could be used in a system to provide the\npilot with guidance for decelerating\nthe airplane\nto the desired turnoff speed (exit speed). The\nanalysis focuses on two fundamental\nquestions\nfor each speed profile:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat is the maximum\n\ndeceleration?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHow much time is spent on the runway\n\nSymbols\na\n\ndeceleration\n\nalong speed profile, ft/sec 2\n\nCl, c 2\n\nconstants\n\nin appendix,\n\neqs.

Perfect tracking of\neach profile is assumed in the analysis.\n\nSubscripts:\ne\n\nexit condition\n\n0\n\ninitial condition\n\nSpeed\n\nProfile\n\nExit Time\n\nnonlinear speed profile\nwhich has a specified\nmaximum deceleration\n(by parameter\n\nStandard\n\nNonlinear\n\nConstant Deceleration\n\nDescription\n\nThe time an airplane spends on the runway\n(i.e., runway occupancy\ntime (ROT)) usually\nmeans the time from when an airplane crosses\nthe runway threshold\nto when it completely\nclears the runway at an exit. In this analysis,\nhowever,\nonly the major portion of ROT is\nconsidered---basically\nthe time spent on a speed\nprofile, which ends when the aircraft reaches the\nexit rather than when it clears the runway.\n\nTerminology:\n\nMax Nonlinear\n\nand Exit Distance\n\nchoice)\n\nnonlinear speed profile\nwith parameter chosen\nby equation (16)\n\nThroughout\nthis paper, exit distance is the\ndistance\nbetween\nthe exit location\nand the\n\nspeed profile with\nconstant deceleration\n\nMaximum\n\nlocation of the start of a speed profile.\nDeceleration\n\nFor passenger\ncomfort\nand safety,\nthe\nmaximum deceleration on a speed profile should\nnot exceed a certain value. In the subsequent\nanalysis, this value is chosen conservatively\nas 8\nft/sec 2 (approximately\n1/4 "g", refs. 2 & 3).\n\nof Speed Profiles\n\nOne way to provide a pilot with guidance to\nan exit is to reference the airplane\'s motion to a\nspeed profile (speed versus distance). The speed\nprofile begins at some distance on the runway\nprior to an exit with the current ground speed of\nthe airplane and ends at the exit with the desired\nexit speed. The airplane\'s\ncurrent speed and\nposition on the runway are known. Ideally, the\nairplane will reach the exit quickly along the\nprofile,\nand the deceleration\nwill not be\nuncomfortable\nfor the passengers. In reference 1,\nthe pilot applies reverse thrust and modulates the\n\nSpeed\n\nProfile\n\nEquations\n\nThis section\ncontains\nequations\nfor the\ndifferent speed profiles to an exit. Distance is\nzero at the start of a profile and reaches x_ at the\nexit. (To express\nthe equations\nin runway\ncoordinates,\nsimply replace x with (x - x0) and\nxe with (x_ - x0), where x0 and x_ become the\nstart of the speed profile and the exit location,\nrespectively, in the runway axis system.)\n\n2\n\nLinear Speed with Distance\nThe equation\ndistance is\n\n(refs. 2 & 3)\n\na -\n\nfor speed as a linear function\n\nv=v o -kx\nwhere the constant\ndistance is\n\nin speed with\n\nk - v\xc2\xb0 - ve\n\n(2)\n\nX e\n\nV e2\n\n(8)\n\n2x_\n\nof\n\n(1)\n\nrate of change\n\nV0 -\n\nThe approach here differs from that in\nreference 4, which tracks the instantaneous\nconstant deceleration needed to reach the desired\nexit conditions (continues to compute the\ndeceleration using current speed and distance to\nthe exit---whereas,\nthe approach here is to track\nthe speed profile computed one time at x0).\nInitially, there is a tendency to "over control" a\ndistant error, whereas this is not the case when\ntracking a local speed profile.\n\nThe deceleration\n\nalong the profile is\ndv\n\na ....\n\ndt\n\ndx\nk-= kv\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nTime to reach the exit on this profile is\nsimply the initial distance to the exit at the start\nof the profile divided by the average speed.\nThus,\n\nand the time to reach the exit is\nt_ (4)\n\nIn the time domain, speed and distance\n\nare\n\nv = Voe-k\'\n\n(5)\n\nx_\n\nk 2\n\n(9)\n\n)\n\nIn the time domain, the variation of speed\nand\ndistance\nis linear\nand\nquadratic,\nrespectively, as\nv =v 0 - at\n\nx - v0-v\nk\n\n- v0(1-e\nk\n\n-h\')\n\n(6)\n\nand deceleration\nvaries with time by equations\n(3) and (5).

But, on the nonlinear\nspeed\nprofile, the speed in-between the two end values\nalways remains\ngreater for the larger of two\nvalues of k---which\nalso means a faster trip to\nthe exit. (This is not difficult to see, because in\nequation (12), for 0 < _ < 1, the initial speed\ndecays more slowly for larger\nk.). Then, a\nnatural question is why not use a very large\nvalue of k to reduce the time on the runway?\nThe reason\nfor not doing this is that the\ndeceleration\nmay\nbecome\nexcessive.\nConsequently,\nthe approach here is to choose the\nlargest k for which the maximum deceleration\nis acceptable.\n\nspeed\n\nv(14)\n\nt,+\n\nThe method for computing\nk is much more\ncomplex than simply using equation (16).

ABSTRACT\n\n(Maximum\n\nStandard\n\n200 words)\n\nTwo NASA goals are to enhance airport safety and to improve capacity in all weather conditions. This paper\ncontributes to these goals by examining speed guidance profiles to aid a pilot in decelerating along the runway to\nan exit. A speed profile essentially tells the pilot what the airplane\'s speed should be as a function of where the\nairplane is on the runway. While it is important to get off the runway as soon as possible (when striving to\nminimize runway occupancy time), the deceleration along a speed profile should be constrained by passenger\ncomfort. Several speed profiles are examined with respect to their maximum decelerations\nand times to reach\nexit speed. One profile varies speed linearly with distance; another has constant deceleration; and two related\nnonlinear profiles delay maximum deceleration (braking) to reduce time spent on the runway.\n\n14.
