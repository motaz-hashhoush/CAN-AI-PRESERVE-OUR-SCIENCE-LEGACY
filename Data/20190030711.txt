It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow,\n\n11\n\nice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water. Terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes\n\n12\n\nhave been observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission since 2002.\n\n13\n\nGRACE has provided an unprecedented view of the terrestrial water storage variations at large\n\n14\n\nscales. Extremes in water storage often are associated with droughts and flooding events because\n\n15\n\nthey are driven by the surplus or deficit of water. Few hydrologic observing networks yield\n\n16\n\nsufficient data for comprehensive monitoring of changes in the total amount of water stored in a\n\n17\n\nregion. GRACE observations have helped to fill this gap. This book chapter is divided into 4 sections.\n\n18\n\nSection 1 provides an overview of the GRACE mission.

TWS is defined as the\n\n35\n\nsummation of all water stored above and below the land surface. This includes surface waters, soil\n\n36\n\nmoisture, groundwater, snow and ice and water stored in vegetation. The variability of TWS tends\n\n37\n\nto be dominated by surface waters in wet, tropical regions such as the Amazon, by soil moisture and\n\n38\n\ngroundwater in mid-latitudes, and by snow and ice in polar and alpine regions (Rodell and\n\n39\n\nFamiglietti, 2001). The variations in water stored in vegetation are small compared to those of the\n\n40\n\nother TWS components, therefore they are typically assumed to be negligible in TWS budget\n\n41\n\nanalyses (Rodell et al., 2005).\n\n42\n\nSurface waters include rivers, inland water bodies, wetlands and inundated floodplains.\n\n43\n\nSurface waters supply agricultural and energy production for most regions in the tropics, and\n\n44\n\nbecause they exist at the land-atmosphere interface they affect hydrometeorological and\n\n45\n\nbiogeochemical processes. Getirana et al. (2017) found that changes in surface water storage are a\n\n46\n\nsubstantial component of TWS variability in the wet tropics (e.g., the Amazon), where major rivers\n\n47\n\nflow over arid regions (e.g., the Nile River in Egypt) and in sub-polar regions. Conversely, changes in\n\n48\n\nsurface water storage are negligible in the Western U.S., Northern Africa, Middle East, and central\n\n49\n\nAsia.\n\n50\n\nSoil moisture is defined as the water stored in the unsaturated zone of the soil. It controls\n\n51\n\nthe partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration, constrains evapotranspiration, and influences\n\n52\n\nthe occurrence of flood water extremes, because when the soil is saturated it cannot infiltrate\n\n53\n\nanymore water (Milly and Dunne, 1994; Crow et al., 2005; Zehe et al., 2005). Soil moisture governs\n\n54\n\nthe partitioning of the turbulent fluxes (latent and sensible heat) hence it affects global and regional\n\n55\n\nhydrometeorological processes (Entekhabi et al., 1996; Seneviratne et al., 2010). In parts of the\n\n56\n\ntropics and in the midlatitudes, soil moisture variations are generally the largest component of\n\n57\n\nseasonal terrestrial water storage changes.\n\n58\n\nGroundwater is the other major component of TWS in the midlatitudes, where provides\n\n59\n\ndomestic water to a billion people and plays a central role in agriculture and energy production\n\n60\n\n(Gleeson et al., 2012; Famiglietti, 2014). This resource has received increased attention in recent\n\n61\n\nyears because of the accelerated rate of depletion of major global aquifers (E.g., Rodell et al., 2009;\n\n62\n\nWada et al., 2010; Famiglietti et al., 2011; Richey et al., 2015; Girotto et al., 2017). Groundwater\n\n63\n\nstorage changes are rarely the dominant component of TWS variations on a seasonal basis, but they\n\n64\n\nare often the dominant component on interannual to decadal timescales (Rodell and Famiglietti,\n\n65\n\n2001; Li et al., 2015).\n\n66\n\nFinally, the water stored in form of snow or ice is the primary component of TWS in high\n\n67\n\nlatitude regions and mountainous regions of the mid-latitudes (Rodell and Famiglietti, 2001;\n\n68\n\nSeneviratne et al., 2003; Getirana et al., 2017). This is because snow water storage induces\n\n69\n\nsignificant variations in TWS due to the mass that accumulates during winter and the mass that\n\n70\n\nmelts during springtime. These fluctuations also affect the surface energy balance because of the\n\n71\n\nchanges in surface albedo (Hall 1988). Accurate global estimates of snow across space and time are\n\n72\n\ncurrently lacking due to complexity of the terrain or inaccessibility of the regions where snow/ice is\n\n73\n\nstored. For this reason, large-scale efforts for estimating snow properties must heavily rely on\n\n74\n\nremote sensing (Schmugge et al., 2002; Girotto et al., 2014). Existing efforts to estimate snow water\n\n75\n\nequivalent (SWE) from remote sensing include using microwave, visible and near infrared, radar\n\n76\n\nand gravimetric measurements. A dedicated snow-measuring satellite mission has not yet been\n\n77\n\nlaunched, but efforts have begun (e.g., NASA SnowEx, https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex)\n\n78\n\nin which international teams of experts are working to devise satellite instruments capable of\n\n79\n\nmeasuring SWE and/or snow depth from space.\n\n80\n81\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n82\n\n1. Overview\tof\tthe\tGRACE\tmission\n\n83\n\nThe Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) maps the gravity potential of the\n\n84\n\nEarth. From these gravity maps scientists can infer global and regional changes of the terrestrial\n\n85\n\nwater storage, ice loss, and sea level change caused by the addition of water to the ocean providing\n\n86\n\na unique view of Earth's climate and have far-reaching benefits to society and the world's\n\n87\n\npopulation. GRACE is jointly operated by NASA and the German Aerospace Center. It was launched\n\n88\n\non March 17 2002, and it continued to perform past its nominal mission lifetime of 5 years until\n\n89\n\nbattery failure caused the end of the science mission in 2017. It consisted of two satellites in a\n\n90\n\ntandem orbit about 200 km apart at 450\xe2\x80\x93500 km altitude. Figure\t1 shows in a simplistic way the\n\n91\n\nprinciple behind the gravity measurements. The two GRACE satellites flew in a tandem orbit over\n\n92\n\nthe Earth. In the case shown in Figure\t1, a mountain represents a positive mass anomaly. As the\n\n93\n\nlead satellite approached the mountain it was pulled toward it because of the gravitational force\n\n94\n\nexerted by the mass anomaly. Thus, the distance between the two satellites increased. As the\n\n95\n\ntrailing satellite approached the mountain, it was pulled toward the anomalous mass while the lead\n\n96\n\nsatellite was held back by the same mass anomaly, and the distance between the satellites\n\n97\n\ndecreased. Finally, as the trailing satellite moved away from the mountain, it was held back, and\n\n98\n\ntheir distance increased again. In a nutshell, measurement of the distance (range) and changes in\n\n99\n\ndistance (range-rate) between the two satellites are related to the gravitational potential of earth\n\n100\n\nmasses. A K-band microwave tracking system continuously measures changes in the distance\n\n101\n\nbetween the satellites with a precision better than 1 \xce\xbcm (Tapley et al., 2004). The measurements\n\n102\n\nare so precise that mass changes associated with ocean circulation, atmospheric circulation, and\n\n103\n\nterrestrial water storage redistribution can be detected by GRACE. Nongravitational accelerations\n\n104\n\nare monitored by onboard accelerometers, and the precise positions of the satellites are measured\n\n105\n\nvia global positioning system (GPS). The monthly analysis of the range and range-rate\n\n106\n\nmeasurements between the two satellites provides the temporal variations (i.e., anomalies) of the\n\n107\n\ngravity field.\n\n108\n\nThe successor of GRACE is the GRACE follow-on (GRACE-FO) mission. GRACE-FO, launched\n\n109\n\non May 22 2018, carries on the work of its predecessor while testing a new laser ranging system\n\n110\n\ndesigned to improve the precision of the intersatellite distance measurement.\n\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n\nFigure\t1.\tSimplified\texample\tof\thow\tthe\tGRACE\tmission\tobserved\tthe\ttime\tvariable\tgravity\tfield.\tThe\t\ntwo\tGRACE\tsatellites\tflew\tin\ttandem\tover\tthe\tEarth\t(first\tpanel).\tIn\tthis\tgraphic\tthe\tmountain\t\nrepresents\ta\tpositive\tmass\tanomaly.\tAs\tthe\tlead\tsatellite\tapproached\tthe\tmountain\tit\twas\tpulled\t\ntoward\tit\tbecause\tof\tthe\tgravitational\tforce\texerted\tby\tthe\tmass\tanomaly.\tThus,\tthe\tdistance\tbetween\t\nthe\ttwo\tsatellites\tincreased\t(second\tpanel).\tAs\tthe\ttrailing\tsatellite\tapproached\tthe\tmountain,\tit\twas\t\npulled\ttoward\tthe\tanomalous\tmass\twhile\tthe\tlead\tsatellite\twas\theld\tback\tby\tthe\tsame\tmass\tanomaly,\t\nand\tthe\tdistance\tbetween\tthe\tsatellites\tdecreased\t(third\tpanel).\tFinally,\tas\tthe\ttrailing\tsatellite\tmoved\t\naway\tfrom\tthe\tmountain,\tit\twas\theld\tback,\tand\ttheir\tdistance\tincreased\tagain\t(fourth\tpanel).\t\t\n\n120\n121\n\n2. Terrestrial\tWater\tStorage\tSolutions\t\nA monthly analysis of the range and range-rate measurements results in a map of temporal\n\n122\n\nvariations (i.e., anomalies) of the gravity fields caused by redistribution of earth masses. Masses can\n\n123\n\nbe static or time variable. Static masses include the total mass of the earth and mass heterogeneities\n\n124\n\nthat only vary on geologic time scales. This includes location of the continents, mountains, and\n\n125\n\ndepression in the crust. The static masses are \xe2\x80\x9cremoved\xe2\x80\x9d when the long term mean gravity field is\n\n126\n\nsaturated from a month solution to produce an anomaly map. The main drivers of temporal\n\n127\n\nvariations in the gravity field are oceanic and atmospheric circulations and redistribution of\n\n128\n\nterrestrial water via the hydrological cycle. Atmosphere mass changes are removed during pre-\n\n129\n\nprocessing using model based atmospheric pressure fields. An ocean model is used to remove high\n\n130\n\nfrequency (6-hourly to sub-monthly) wind and pressure-driven ocean motions that might\n\n131\n\notherwise alias into the monthly gravity solutions. What remains are anomalies in terrestrial water\n\n132\n\nstorage (TWS). Glacial isostatic adjustment must also be considered in certain regions such as\n\n133\n\nHudson\xe2\x80\x99s Bay in Canada, and a major earthquake can produce a significant gravitational anomaly,\n\n134\n\nbut the timescales of most solid earth processes are too long to be an issue.\n\n135\n\nCurrently, the range-rate observations are processed using either spherical harmonics\n\n136\n\n(Wahr et al., 1998) or the mass concentration (mascon, Rowlands et al., 2005) approach to produce\n\n137\n\nthe monthly gravity solutions.\n\n138\n\nThe spherical harmonics solutions represent the gravity field via a set of coefficients\n\n139\n\n(degree and order \xe2\x89\xa4 120) of a given spherical harmonic expansion that describes the shape of the\n\n140\n\ngeoid (the surface of constant gravitational potential best matching the mean sea surface). The\n\n141\n\nexpansion coefficients can be manipulated using numerical devices such as Gaussian averaging\n\n142\n\nfunctions in order to isolate mass anomalies (deviations from the baseline temporal mean) over\n\n143\n\nregions of interest (e.g., Wahr et al., 1998). The spherical harmonic solutions have typically suffered\n\n144\n\nfrom poor observability of east-west gradients, resulting in the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cstripes\xe2\x80\x9d that are\n\n145\n\nconventionally removed via empirical smoothing and/or \xe2\x80\x9cdestriping\xe2\x80\x9d algorithms (Swensen and\n\n146\n\nWahr 2006). Although quite effective, especially for larger spatial scales, the destriping also\n\n147\n\nremoves some real geophysical signal along with the stripes, and the size, shape, and orientation of\n\n148\n\nthe signals strongly affects the effectiveness of destriping (Watkins et al., 2015). For this reason,\n\n149\n\nerrors in such estimates are inversely related to the size of the region, being as small as 1\xe2\x80\x932 cm\n\n150\n\nequivalent height of water over continental-scale river basins, and being large enough to\n\n151\n\noverwhelm the hydrology signal as the area drops below \xe2\x88\xbc150,000 km2 (Rodell and Famiglietti,\n\n152\n\n1999, Wahr et al., 2006). Three centers are currently generating spherical harmonic fields: the\n\n153\n\nCenter for Space Research at the University of Texas; the GeoForschungsZentrum. Potsdam,\n\n154\n\nGermany; and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California.\n\n155\n\nAs an alternative to the spherical harmonic technique, the inter-satellite ranging data can\n\n156\n\nalso be used directly to estimate regional \xe2\x80\x9cmass concentrations\xe2\x80\x9d (mascons) without the need to first\n\n157\n\nderive a global gravity field (Rowlands et al., 2005). The primary advantage of using mascons as a\n\n158\n\nbasis function is that each mascon has a specific known geophysical location (unlike spherical\n\n159\n\nharmonic coefficients which individually have no particular localization information). Mascons take\n\n160\n\nadvantage of this convenient property to specify a-priori information (constraints) during the data\n\n161\n\ninversion to internally remove the correlated error in the gravity solution. So, unlike the spherical\n\n162\n\nharmonic solutions, the constrained mascon solutions typically do not need to be destriped or\n\n163\n\nsmoothed. The mascon approach also allows a better separation of land and ocean signals. Mascons\n\n164\n\nsolutions are currently freely available from different centers such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\n\n165\n\nCalifornia (Watkins et al., 2015); the Goddard Space and Flight Center, Maryland (Luthcke et al.,\n\n166\n\n2013); and the Center for Space Research, Texas (Save et al., 2012).\n\n167\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n168\n169\n\n3. Extremes\tin\tWater\tStorage\t\t\nExtremes in water storage often are manifested as droughts and flooding events, driven by\n\n170\n\nthe surplus or deficit of water stored in a river basin or an aquifer. Understanding the spatial and\n\n171\n\ntemporal extend of these hydrologic extremes is critical for water resources management, hazard\n\n172\n\npreparedness, and food security (Diffenbaugh and Scheree 2011; D\xe2\x80\x99Odorico et al., 2010). Few\n\n173\n\nhydrologic observing networks yield sufficient data for comprehensive monitoring of changes in\n\n174\n\nthe total amount of water stored in a region (Rodell and Famiglietti, 2001). GRACE observations\n\n175\n\nhave helped to fill this gap. They have been used to characterize regional flood potential (e.g.,\n\n176\n\nReager and Famiglietti 2009) and to assess wetness and drought for the U.S. Drought Monitor (e.g.,\n\n177\n\nHouburg et al., 2012). Further, as an integrated measure of all surface and groundwater storage\n\n178\n\nchanges, GRACE data implicitly contains a record of seasonal to interannual water storage\n\n179\n\nvariations that can likely be exploited to lengthen early warning periods for regional flood and\n\n180\n\ndrought prediction (Thomas et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2017). The next two subsections will provide a\n\n181\n\nreview of the extreme water storage events identified by the GRACE mission along with the\n\n182\n\npotential for predictability.\n\n183\n184\n185\n\n3.1 Droughts\nMeteorological drought is defined as an extended period of low precipitation, whereas\n\n186\n\nhydrological droughts are generally de\xef\xac\x81ned as extended periods of water storage de\xef\xac\x81cits leading to\n\n187\n\nlow streamflow. Satellite gravimetry is the only remote sensing technique able to monitor the water\n\n188\n\nstorage in a holistic manner. For this reason, GRACE data have been investigated alone, or in\n\n189\n\ncombination with land surface models, to analyze worldwide hydrological drought conditions and\n\n190\n\nprovide new methods to monitor droughts (Li et al., submitted, Zhao et al., 2017). Further, GRACE\n\n191\n\ncan contribute to regional drought characterization by measuring water storage deficits in\n\n192\n\npreviously identified, drought-stricken areas. The duration and magnitude of the deficits can serve\n\n193\n\nas metrics to help quantify hydrological drought severity (Thomas et al., 2014). This subsection\n\n194\n\nprovides a review of previous studies that used GRACE to quantify, analyze, and monitor droughts.\n\n195\n\nRecent studies have investigated the potential for using GRACE information to monitor\n\n196\n\ndroughts. In addition to Thomas et al. (2014) and Houburg et al. (2012), Cao et al. (2015)\n\n197\n\nintroduced the total storage deficit index, derived from the GRACE-recovered terrestrial water\n\n198\n\nstorage changes, to analyze drought characteristics in arid Northwestern China. Yirdaw et al.\n\n199\n\n(2008) employed the total storage deficit index, to characterize the 2002/2003 drought episode\n\n200\n\nand generate a pictorial representation of the long-term dryness and wetness within the\n\n201\n\nSaskatchewan River Basin in Canada. Yi and Wen (2016) established a GRACE-based hydrological\n\n202\n\ndrought index for drought monitoring in the continental United States from 2003 to 2012. Kusche\n\n203\n\net al. (2016) mapped the probabilities of extreme continental water storage changes form space\n\n204\n\ngravimetry. They derived hot spot regions of high probability of peak anomalous water storage.\n\n205\n\nUsing the GRACE-derived TWS anomaly index, Wang et al. (2014) compared the precipitation\n\n206\n\nanomaly index and the vegetation anomaly index to analyze the drought events in the Haihe River\n\n207\n\nBasin, China, from January 2003 to January 2013. Thomas et al. (2014) described a quantitative\n\n208\n\napproach (based on water storage deficits) to measure the occurrence, severity, frequency,\n\n209\n\nmagnitude, and duration of hydrological droughts based on the GRACE-derived TWS (Sun et al.,\n\n210\n\n2018).\n\n211\n\nCombined satellite/model drought monitoring tools are also becoming more common. Data\n\n212\n\nassimilation systems merge observations with physically based models, using the model to provide\n\n213\n\nspatially and temporally complete estimates of all drought-relevant hydrologic variables and the\n\n214\n\nobservation record to correct for model errors (Anderson et al., 2012). In particular, the application\n\n215\n\nof the GRACE data assimilation approach for drought monitoring has recently been explored by\n\n216\n\nNASA-funded investigations (Houburg et al., 2012, Rodell 2012). These result in surface and root-\n\n217\n\nzone soil moisture and groundwater drought indicators based on GRACE data assimilation results,\n\n218\n\nand to evaluation of those indicators as inputs to the USDM products. Houborg et al. (2012) and Li\n\n219\n\net al. (2012) use GRACE data assimilation to evaluate its potential for developing new drought\n\n220\n\nindicator products to serve as baselines for the Drought Monitor maps. The assimilation\n\n221\n\ndownscaled (in space and time) and disaggregated GRACE data into finer scale components of TWS,\n\n222\n\nwhich exhibited significant changes in their dryness rankings relative to those without data\n\n223\n\nassimilation, suggesting that GRACE data assimilation could have a substantial impact on drought\n\n224\n\nmonitoring (Li et al., 2012, Huborg et al., 2012). The weekly indicators are available on the National\n\n225\n\nDrought Mitigation Center\xe2\x80\x99s website (http://drought.unl.edu).\n\n226\n227\n\n\t\n3.1.1\tMajor\tWorld\tDroughts\t\n\n228\n\nThomas et al. (2014) present gravity-based measurements of water storage anomalies\n\n229\n\nduring recent droughts. They use GRACE to explore how hydrological droughts may be better\n\n230\n\ncharacterized while estimating the associated regional water storage de\xef\xac\x81cit. The average storage\n\n231\n\ndeficit during drought events can be identified using the 1) storage deficit as a negative departure\n\n232\n\nfrom the seasonal cycle and 2) the drought duration as the number of months with continuous\n\n233\n\ndeficits (Thomas et al., 2014). In essence, the average storage deficit is an arithmetic mean of the\n\n234\n\nstorage deficit observed during a given drought event and it is used as a measure of drought\n\n235\n\nintensity. Based on these definitions of storage deficit and drought duration, Humphrey et al.\n\n236\n\n(2016) provide a review of all drought events identified in the GRACE period from 2002-2015.\n\n237\n\nFigure\t2\tshows the maximum average storage deficit ever observed for all drought events\n\n238\n\nidentified in the April 2002-January 2017 by the GRACE record as derived by Humphrey et al.\n\n239\n\n(2016). The year corresponding to this maximum is depicted in Figure\t2b. Here, we group these\n\n240\n\nmajor drought events by continents. Further, we discuss on potential for using GRACE data and\n\n241\n\nmodels (via data assimilation) to improve predictability of these droughts events (Section 3.1.2).\n\n242\n\n243\n\n244\n\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n\nFigure\t2.\ta)\tMaximum\tvalue\tof\tthe\taverage\tstorage\tdeficit\tobserved\tin\tthe\tperiod\tApril\t2002\xe2\x80\x93August\t\n2015,\texpressed\tin\tmm\tof\tequivalent\twater\theight.\tb)\tYear\tcorresponding\tto\tthe\tmaximum\tvalue\tof\t\nthe\taverage\tstorage\tdeficit,\tshowing\tonly\tregions\twith\ta\tdeficit\tlarger\tthan\t30\tmm\t(adapted\tfrom\t\nHumphrey\tet\tal.,\t2016).\t\n\n251\n\nSouth\tAmerica\t\n\n\t\n\n252\n\nThe Amazon River water storage during year 2016 was one of the lowest during the GRACE\n\n253\n\nrecord (Figure\t2). Other droughts, not shown, are identified for this region, such as the 2004-2008,\n\n254\n\nand 2010 dry-period reported in the work by Humphrey et al., (2016), Frappart et al. (2012) and\n\n255\n\nThomas et al. (2014). Getirana (2016) uses GRACE to identify a water loss rate of 26.1 cm/year for\n\n256\n\nsoutheastern Brazil over the period from 2012 to 2015. Drought events in the Amazon River basin\n\n257\n\nwere shown to be related to precipitation deficits and to the El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO,\n\n258\n\nDavidson et al. 2012; Frappart et al. 2012). The Amazon basin extreme droughts cause ineffective\n\n259\n\nhydropower production. In fact, water storage droughts in this region cause massive agricultural\n\n260\n\nlosses, water supply restrictions, and energy rationing.\n\n261\n\nThe 2008-2012 La Plata basin (Argentina) drought is also seen in Figure\t2. Chen et al.,\n\n262\n\n(2010) identify the onset of this drought using GRACE. In their work, GRACE revealed details of the\n\n263\n\ntemporal and spatial evolution of this drought, with onset around austral spring 2008 in the lower\n\n264\n\nLa Plata basin, which spread to the entire La Plata basin. Wetness and drought in this region is\n\n265\n\ncorrelated with ENSO, with dry and wet seasons corresponding to ENSO events, respectively (Chen\n\n266\n\net al., 2010, Abelen et al. 2015; Sordo-Ward et al., 2017).\n\n267\n268\n269\n\nNorth\tAmerica\t\nThe 2012-2015 drought in the Central Valley of California is also seen in Figure\t2. This\n\n270\n\ndrought reduced natural recharge to the aquifers and caused low annual snow accumulations in the\n\n271\n\nSierra Nevada Mountains (Margulis et al., 2016). Further, groundwater acts as the key strategic\n\n272\n\nreserve in times of drought and the Central Valley is the most productive agricultural region for\n\n273\n\nfresh produce in the USA (Faunt 2009). Excessive groundwater pumping during a period of\n\n274\n\nmeteorological drought can cause unrecoverable losses at aquifer storage capacity (Faunt 2009;\n\n275\n\nFamiglietti et al., 2011; Famiglietti 2014; Scanlon et al. 2012a,b). For example, Famiglietti et al.\n\n276\n\n(2011) estimate a depletion in groundwater that totaled of 20 km3 of water during 2012-2015.\n\n277\n\nContinued groundwater depletion at this rate may well be unsustainable, with potentially dire\n\n278\n\nconsequences for the economic and food security of the United States (Famiglietti et al., 2011).\n\n279\n\nGroundwater depletion can cause significant land subsidence (Galloway et al. 1999). The analysis of\n\n280\n\nTWS for the entire GRACE record also indicates dry episodes for previous years over the\n\n281\n\nsouthwestern United States. For example, Scanlon et al (2012a) and Famiglietti et al., (2011) report\n\n282\n\nthat groundwater depletion was observed in the Central Valley during the drought period from\n\n283\n\nApril 2006 through September 2009.\n\n284\n\nNotably, most of the United States, experienced droughts in 2012 (Figure\t2). The U.S.\n\n285\n\nDrought Monitor (Svuboda et al., 2002) estimated that over three-quarters of the contiguous United\n\n286\n\nStates experienced at least abnormally dry conditions by the summer\xe2\x80\x99s end with nearly half of the\n\n287\n\nregion, especially the Great Plains, experiencing severe drought (Hoerling et al., 2013). This period\n\n288\n\nlacked the usual abundance of slow-soaking precipitation-bearing systems and evening\n\n289\n\nthunderstorms along the Great Plains, and as a result, surface moisture conditions greatly\n\n290\n\ndeteriorated. GRACE data was used to identify this massive event (Humphrey et al., 2016). Most\n\n291\n\nimportantly, GRACE TWS data helped identify the recovery time. In March 2013, heavy winter rains\n\n292\n\nbroke a three-year pattern of meteorological drought in much of the southeastern United States,\n\n293\n\nwhile drought conditions still plagued the Great Plains and other parts of the United States. Chew\n\n294\n\nand Small (2014) found that standard drought indices misrepresent the recovery time from the\n\n295\n\ndrought, putting it much earlier than the one obtained with the auxiliary information of GRACE\n\n296\n\nTWS. Accurate understanding of drought onset and recovery time is critical because drought\n\n297\n\nimpacts grain and wheat prices (Boyer et al., 2013). A large disruption to production of these crops\n\n298\n\ncan have a substantial impact on international grain markets. Also visible in Figure\t2 are the\n\n299\n\ndroughts during the year 2007\xe2\x80\x932009 over east United States. Houborg et al. (2012) demonstrated\n\n300\n\nthe capabilities of using GRACE data assimilation for characterizing the hydrological drought (more\n\n301\n\ndiscussion in Section 3.1.2). Further, the 2010\xe2\x80\x932013 drought in Texas is shown in Figure\t2 and was\n\n302\n\ndescribed by Long et al. (2013).\n\n303\n304\n\n305\n306\n\nAfrica\t\nFigure\t2 identifies the 2006\xe2\x80\x932007 dry conditions over an extended area around the Lake\n\n307\n\nVictoria (Swenson and Wahr 2009). The 2006\xe2\x80\x932008 Zambezi basin (Thomas et al. 2014) and Lake\n\n308\n\nVictoria droughts are captured as one large-scale and spatially contiguous event. Droughts in East\n\n309\n\nAfrica are recurring phenomena with significant humanitarian impacts. GRACE total water storage\n\n310\n\nestimates reveal that water storage declined in much of East Africa by up to 60 mm/year (Swenson\n\n311\n\nand Wahr 2009) during the 2006-2007 drought. The complex and highly variant nature of many\n\n312\n\nhydrometeorological drivers such as ENSO, sea surface temperature (SST) and land\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere\n\n313\n\nfeedback adds to the daunting challenge of drought monitoring and forecasting in Africa. The 2010-\n\n314\n\n2011 drought of the Horn of Africa is not shown in Figure\t2 but it was identified using GRACE in\n\n315\n\nprevious studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2012) to characterize its temporal and spatial evolution.\n\n316\n317\n\nEurasia\t\n\n318\n\nHydrological droughts are common in Europe, and several episodes of severe droughts,\n\n319\n\nincluding the 2003 drought (spreading across western and central Europe) and the 2007-2008\n\n320\n\ndroughts (affecting southern and southwestern Europe) were detected by GRACE TWS (Li et al.,\n\n321\n\n2012). In particular, the 2003 event was associated with the 2003 European heat wave (Rebetez et\n\n322\n\nal., 2006). For most of Europe, TWS values were relatively high at the beginning of 2003 due to\n\n323\n\nheavy precipitation in summer and autumn of 2002, but they decreased very rapidly in the period\n\n324\n\nFebruary\xe2\x80\x93August, resulting in very dry conditions during the entire summer of 2003. The soil\n\n325\n\ndrying in 2003 exceeded the long-term average by far (Herrera et al., 2010). Following the 2003\n\n326\n\ndrought and heat wave, forest fires burned a large area of Siberia (Herrera et al., 2010). Drought\n\n327\n\nconditions can also be found in northern India for the period 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 (Figure\t2). The year 2009\n\n328\n\nwas the driest year of the decade for this region in terms of precipitation (Chen et al., 2014) and\n\n329\n\nresulted in higher groundwater abstraction rates (Rodell et al., 2009).\n\n330\n\nFigure\t2 identifies the 2004 drought in southeast China, around the Yangtze River basin.\n\n331\n\nThe Yangtze River is experiencing an increasing trend in terms of the frequency of extreme events\n\n332\n\n(Dai et al., 2008), which often leads to severe reductions in crop outputs, along with other related\n\n333\n\nsocial and economic losses (Chao et al., 2016). Other severe drought events were identified in 2006\n\n334\n\nand 2011 (Sun et al., 2018). Previous works based on the analysis of GRACE data quantify a\n\n335\n\nterrestrial water storage deficit of -621; -617, -192 mm for the 2004, 2006, and 2011 droughts\n\n336\n\nrespectively (Chao et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018).\n\n337\n\nThe Sumatra region exhibits a minimum in 2004 (Figure\t2). However, this is an artifact\n\n338\n\ncaused by the 2004 earthquake, with GRACE observing changes in the gravity field due to crustal\n\n339\n\ndilatation and vertical displacement of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s layered density structure (Han et al., 2006).\n\n340\n\n\t\n\n341\n\nAustralia\t\n\n342\n\nIn Australia, multiyear droughts have been related to precipitation deficits (Garc\xc4\xb1\xcc\x81a-Garc\xc4\xb1\xcc\x81a et\n\n343\n\nal. 2011). Van Dijk et al. (2013) explain drivers of the drought and its impacts. These were analyzed\n\n344\n\nusing climate, water, economic, and remote sensing data combined with biophysical modeling.\n\n345\n\nENSO explained two third of the rainfall deficit, and a contribution of global climate change remains\n\n346\n\nplausible. The millennium drought (2001-2009) was the worst drought on record for southeast\n\n347\n\nAustralia (Van Dijk et al., 2013). It has led to the almost complete drying of surface water resources,\n\n348\n\nwhich account for most of the water used for irrigation and domestic purposes. Using GRACE data,\n\n349\n\nLebalnc et al. (2009) show the propagation of the water deficit through the hydrological cycle and\n\n350\n\nthe rise of different types of drought.\n\n351\n352\n353\n354\n\n3.1.2.\tThe\tPotential\tfor\tusing\tGRACE\tin\tMonitoring\tand\tPredicting\tDroughts\t\t\nCurrently, standard drought quantitation methods and products including the U.S. Drought\nMonitor (USDM) rely heavily on in situ observations of precipitation, streamflow, snowpack data,\n\n355\n\nand subjective human based judgments (Rodell, 2012). USDM drought maps are published on a\n\n356\n\nweekly basis by a team of authors and widely considered to be the premier US drought products\n\n357\n\navailable for use by governments, farmers and other stakeholders, and the public, despite limited\n\n358\n\ngroundwater and soil moisture data as direct inputs. Although meteorological drought is defined as\n\n359\n\nan extended period with deficient precipitation, hydrological and agricultural droughts are also\n\n360\n\ninfluenced by precursor conditions of groundwater and soil moisture. Surface moisture conditions\n\n361\n\ncan fluctuate quickly with the weather, while the deeper components of TWS (e.g., groundwater)\n\n362\n\nare well suited to drought quantification, particularly hydrologic droughts, because they integrate\n\n363\n\nmeteorological conditions over timescales of weeks to years (Rodell, 2012). Prior to USDM use of\n\n364\n\nGRACE data assimilation based drought indices (Houburg et al., 2012), drought products did not\n\n365\n\nincorporate systematic observations of soil moisture, groundwater, or total TWS. Groundwater\n\n366\n\nstorage and shallow and deep soil moisture are still major gaps in current drought monitoring\n\n367\n\ncapabilities and monitoring of droughts has suffered from lack of reliable information on the water\n\n368\n\nstored below the uppermost soil layer. Remote sensing\xe2\x80\x93based drought indices have opened a new\n\n369\n\npath forward in drought monitoring and detection (Niemeyer, 2008), allowing accurate spatial\n\n370\n\ninformation to be obtained with global or regional coverage with high reliability and a high\n\n371\n\nrepetition rate (Sun et al., 2018). In particular, since GRACE measures the water storage changes in\n\n372\n\nthe entire profile, it provides valuable information on drought conditions beyond what can be seen\n\n373\n\nat the surface (Li et al., 2012). Further, given that GRACE offers information on the total water\n\n374\n\nstorage deficit it can be used to estimate the amount of water (precipitation) needed to recover\n\n375\n\nfrom drought events (Thomas et al., 2014; Aghakouchak et al., 2014).\n\n376\n377\n378\n379\n\n3.2 Floods\nFlood events are projected to become more frequent as global warming amplifies the\natmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s water holding capacity, increasing the occurrence of extreme precipitation events\n\n380\n\n(Slater and Villarini 2016; Groisman, 2012; Wang et al., 2017). Many countries have developed\n\n381\n\nflood alert systems (Molodtsova et al., 2016), such as the European Flood Alert System (Bartholmes\n\n382\n\net al., 2009) and the US National Weather Service Automated Flood Warning System (Scawthorn,\n\n383\n\n1999). While most of these warning systems rely on a dense network of gauging stations, a\n\n384\n\nsignificant portion of the economic losses caused by floods occur in developing countries where\n\n385\n\nground flood monitoring and management programs are still inefficient (Molodtsova et al., 2016).\n\n386\n\nTo augment ground-based observations, flood monitoring has increasingly relied on products\n\n387\n\nbased on space-borne sensor observations (i.e., remote sensing). Among the remote sensing\n\n388\n\nproducts that have been used for flood monitoring, data from the GRACE mission are unique\n\n389\n\nbecause the total amount of terrestrial water can be directly measured (Molodtsova et al., 2016).\n\n390\n\nThe terrestrial water storage signal relates to the ability of the land surface to absorb and process\n\n391\n\nwater and accounts for the water in plants, groundwater, soil moisture and snow (Reager and\n\n392\n\nFamiglietti 2009). Over the course of a year, a region can transition between its minimum and\n\n393\n\nmaximum TWS due to the annual cycle of precipitation. When the region is near the maximum, it\n\n394\n\ncan store and process only a finite amount of water before the saturated ground will force\n\n395\n\nadditional precipitation to runoff (Reager and Famiglietti 2009). Generally, the land surface\n\n396\n\nmodulates the connection between precipitation and runoff generation through two basic\n\n397\n\nmechanisms: infiltration limitation and saturation excess. During floods, one of these two\n\n398\n\nmechanisms is typically identified as a driver based on the pre-flood conditions and the nature of\n\n399\n\nthe precipitation event (Reager et al., 2015). That is, the pre-rainfall event wetness of a watershed\n\n400\n\ncan determine its response to rainfall (Sayama et al., 2011; Kirchner 2009; Brutsaert 2008), leading\n\n401\n\nto variability in flood generation (Li et al., 2002). Salter and Villarini (2016) show that flood\n\n402\n\npatterns are dependent on the overall wetness and potential water storage, with fundamental\n\n403\n\nimplications for water resources management, agriculture, insurance, navigation, ecology, and\n\n404\n\npopulations living in flood-affected areas.\n\n405\n406\n\n3.2.1.\tFlood\tPotential\tfrom\tGRACE\t\n\n407\n\n\t\n\n408\n\ninformation relevant for regional flooding contained in the GRACE extreme (wet) TWS values. TWS\n\n409\n\nthat is near its maximum can be a harbinger of future flood events at several months lead-time\n\n410\n\n(Reager and Famiglietti 2009).\tThe concept of flood potential has been used in several studies\n\n411\n\n(Section 3.2.2) to analyze flood risk in different watersheds around the world.\n\n412\n\nReager and Famiglietti (2009) introduced the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cflood potential\xe2\x80\x9d to highlight the\n\nReager and Famiglietti (2009) assume that the regional storage capacity can be\n\n413\n\napproximated by the historic record maximum in the GRACE TWS storage anomaly time series to\n\n414\n\ngive a quantitative estimate (in cm) of the saturation point of the regional land surface. In a\n\n415\n\nnutshell, GRACE time series can be used to calculate an effective maximum storage capacity in each\n\n416\n\nregion. Reager and Famiglietti (2009) isolate, temporally and spatially, those months in which a\n\n417\n\nhigh percentage of the storage capacity is achieved and high precipitation continues. Finally, they\n\n418\n\nnormalized this new dataset to remove regional heterogeneity and create a global flood potential\n\n419\n\nindex. The resulting flood potential amount is the quantity of incoming water that exceeds the\n\n420\n\nstorage capacity for the current month based on the regionally observed storage anomaly maxima.\n\n421\n\nSimilar to a traditional \xe2\x80\x98bucket model\xe2\x80\x99, when this quantity exceeds zero, flooding is likely to occur.\n\n422\n\nFigure\t3a shows a global map of the flood index for the year 2007 as derived by Reager and\n\n423\n\nFamiglietti (2009). This is compared to the Dartmouth Flood Observatory map of reported floods\n\n424\n\n(Figure\t3b). The Dartmouth Flood Observatory catalogues historic floods based on satellite\n\n425\n\nobservations, weather service and news reports (https://www.dartmouth.edu/~floods/). The red\n\n426\n\nareas in Figure\t3b indicate observed floods during 2007. While the GRACE derived flood index\n\n427\n\n(Figure\t3a) misses some flooded regions in Africa and Asia, it is generally successful at predicting\n\n428\n\nlarge-scale flood-affected areas. The index captures the general patterns of flooding on most\n\n429\n\ncontinents, and captures some rather high spatial resolution structure, including events on the\n\n430\n\nsouthernmost tip of Africa and the unique \xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99 shape of Mississippi river flooding (Reager and\n\n431\n\nFamiglietti, 2009). Further, Reager et al. (2014) demonstrate the ability of the flood potential\n\n432\n\nconcept to derive longer lead times (as much as 5\xe2\x80\x9311 months in advance) in flood warnings at a\n\n433\n\nregional scale (e.g. for the Missuri 2011, the Columbia River 2011 and Indus River 2010 flood\n\n434\n\nevents).\n\n435\n\nHowever, several limitations still exist for using satellite gravimetry in an operational flood\n\n436\n\nprediction mode (Reager et al., 2015). The prevailing limitations are: (1) coarse spatial resolution\n\n437\n\n(~150,000 km2, Rowlands et al., 2005; Swenson et al., 2006); (2) the aggregated observation of\n\n438\n\nmultiple water storage components (i.e., snow, soil moisture, and groundwater) as a single\n\n439\n\nintegrated value for each grid cell; and (3) latency in data product processing and release (2\xe2\x80\x934\n\n440\n\nmonths lag for GRACE and at least ten days for GRACE-FO). These obstacles make many\n\n441\n\napplications difficult, as water resource management tends to occur at small watershed scales and\n\n442\n\non daily to weekly timescales. For this reason, similarly to the drought monitoring work by\n\n443\n\nHouburg et al. (2012), data assimilation can be used as a tool to partially overcome these\n\n444\n\nlimitations. In their work, Reager et al. (2015) assimilate GRACE data within the catchment land\n\n445\n\nsurface model and evaluate the assimilation scheme performance under flood conditions. The\n\n446\n\nassimilation results made the model wetter in the months preceding flood, thus increasing the\n\n447\n\nmodel capability to predict floods.\n\n448\n449\n450\n451\n\nFigure\t3.\tA\tcomparison\tof\tthe\t(top)\t2007\tflood\tindex\tmaxima\tand\t(bottom)\t2007\tDartmouth\tFlood\t\nObservatory\treported\tfloods.\t(source\tReager\tand\tFamiglietti\t2009)\t\n\n452\n453\n454\n\n3.2.2.\tHistorical\tFlood\tEvents\tCharacterized\tby\tGRACE\t\nThe investigation of GRACE data to characterize flooding events has not been exploited as\n\n455\n\nmuch as the characterization of drought events. This section lists historical flooding events that\n\n456\n\nhave been investigated with the use of GRACE data.\n\n457\n\ndutt Vishwakarma et al. (2013) discussed two major flooding events in India, one being the\n\n458\n\n2005 monsoon flooding in Mumbai and nearby states and other being the flood experienced by\n\n459\n\nBihar in 2008. GRACE detected these two flooding events at large spatial scale. Long et al. (2014)\n\n460\n\nused the flood potential index derived by Reager and Famiglietti (2009) to characterize the 2008\n\n461\n\nsevere flood in southwest China. Chinnasamy (2017) develop a regression model between GRACE\n\n462\n\ndata and observed discharge flow. Their model was tested to predict the 2008 Koshi floods, India.\n\n463\n\nTheir results indicate that the saturation of water storage units in the basin play a vital role in the\n\n464\n\nprediction of peak floods and their lead times. Chen et al. (2010) used GRACE to identify the\n\n465\n\nAmazon River 2009 flood event, which caused many casualties, and its connection to ENSO. Sun et\n\n466\n\nal. (2017) use GRACE data to evaluate the flood potential index (Reager and Famiglietti 2009) in the\n\n467\n\nYangtze River Basin of China. Zhou et al., (2017) also investigated the potentials for using GRACE\n\n468\n\ndata for identifying and predicting floods in the Yangtze River Basin. In particular, the 2010 flood\n\n469\n\nwas identified as the most serious disaster during the study period, with discharge and\n\n470\n\nprecipitation values 37.95% and 19.44% higher, respectively, than multi-year average values for\n\n471\n\nthe same period. Zhou et al. (2017) highlight that while the GRACE derived flood potential index can\n\n472\n\nidentify extremes for large floods, it is currently not suitable for smaller and/or short-term flood\n\n473\n\nevents (Sun et al., 2017). Tangdamrongsub et al. (2016) used GRACE data to quantify flooding of the\n\n474\n\nTonl\xc3\xa9 ap basin, Cambodia between 2002 and 2014. For this region, the 2011 and 2013 flood events\n\n475\n\nwere clearly identified by GRACE. The basin-averaged TWS values for these two events were 42 cm\n\n476\n\n(40% higher than the long-term mean peak value) and 36 cm (34% higher) equivalent water\n\n477\n\nheight, respectively. In May and June of 2011, a large flood crest moved down the Mississippi from a\n\n478\n\ncombination of snowmelt and heavy spring rains in the Missouri river basin. Flows in the Missouri\n\n479\n\nwere characterized as a 500-year event. Red River Landing, near the mouth of the Mississippi, went\n\n480\n\nabove flood stage on 19 March and did not fall below flood stage until 25 June. Reager et al. (2014)\n\n481\n\nand Wang et al. (2014) investigate this flood event using GRACE data and they indicate that analysis\n\n482\n\nof TWS observations has the potential for providing spatially distributed warning information.\n\n483\n\nSimilar conclusions were derived for the Columbia River flood event in May-June 2011, and the\n\n484\n\nIndus River flood in 2010.\n\n485\n\n4. Conclusions\t\t\n\n486\n487\n\nExtremes in water storage are often manifested as drought and flooding events, driven by\n\n488\n\nthe surplus or deficit of water stored in a river basin or an aquifer. These events are projected to\n\n489\n\nbecome more frequent as a result of global warming (Pachauri et al., 2014). The existing in situ\n\n490\n\nobserving networks are not sufficient to detect and monitor these extremes in the total amount of\n\n491\n\nwater stored in a region. GRACE observations have helped to fill this information gap because it has\n\n492\n\nprovided an unprecedented, holistic view of terrestrial water storage variations. GRACE Follow On,\n\n493\n\nlaunched in May 2018, will extend that important data record.\n\n494\n\nGRACE contributed to regional drought characterization by measuring water storage\n\n495\n\ndeficits drought-stricken areas. It also provided information useful for predicting regional flood\n\n496\n\npotential. The concepts of flood potential and water storage deficit have been used in several\n\n497\n\nstudies to characterize the extremes observed by GRACE. This book chapter reviewed many of the\n\n498\n\nmost significant studies.\n\n499\n\nLimitations still exist for using GRACE and GRACE Follow On data in an operational drought\n\n500\n\nor flood prediction mode. The major limitations are related to the relatively coarse spatial and\n\n501\n\ntemporal resolutions of the GRACE observations and the fact that TWS is an aggregated observation\n\n502\n\nof multiple water storage components (i.e., snow, soil moisture, and groundwater). Latency in the\n\n503\n\ndelivery of GRACE data is also a serious issue, but that is expected to be mitigated by the availability\n\n504\n\nof low latency data products derived from GRACE Follow On (e.g., Sakumura et al., 2016). These\n\n505\n\nlimitations can be addressed through the combined used of observed TWS and models, i.e., via data\n\n506\n\nassimilation (e.g., Zaitchik et al., 2008; Girotto et al., 2016).\n\n507\n508\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n509\n\nReferences\t\t\n\n510\n511\n512\n513\n514\n515\n516\n517\n518\n519\n520\n521\n522\n523\n524\n525\n526\n527\n528\n529\n530\n531\n532\n533\n534\n535\n536\n537\n538\n539\n540\n541\n542\n543\n544\n545\n546\n547\n548\n549\n550\n551\n552\n553\n554\n555\n\nAbelen, S., Seitz, F., Abarca-del-Rio, R., & G\xc3\xbcntner, A.
