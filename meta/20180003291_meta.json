One category of DBS are complex organic molecules and/or structures whose formation and abundances relative to other compounds are virtually unachievable in the absence of life. A potential biosignature (PBS) is an object, substance and/or pattern that might have a biological origin and thus compels investigators to gather more data before reaching a conclusion as to the presence or absence of life. The usefulness of a PBS is determined not only by the probability that life created it but also by the improbability that nonbiological processes produced it. Because habitable planetary environments create nonbiological features that can mimic biosignatures, these environments must be characterized to the extent necessary to provide a context that is essential for confirming the presence of DBS. Environmental conditions also must have allowed biosignatures to be preserved and amenable to detection. Categories of biosignatures and their measurement requirements are indicated below.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20180003291, "endDate": "2018-04-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Paris, France"}}, "meetingId": "cc334ca092e242958790e19cd29d33bf", "id": "5c63ccdaa2d44fc4bbd107321fe16fe7"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)", "location": "Toulouse, France"}}, "meetingId": "cc334ca092e242958790e19cd29d33bf", "id": "dc70629881b4428b8eda10544fb053e6"}], "name": "International Mars Sample Return Conference", "location": "Berlin", "id": "cc334ca092e242958790e19cd29d33bf", "startDate": "2018-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180003291, "id": "e37938dd1ea2439eadd620b67ff33d18", "publicationDate": "2018-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180003291.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180003291/downloads/20180003291.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180003291/downloads/20180003291.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180003291/downloads/20180003291.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
