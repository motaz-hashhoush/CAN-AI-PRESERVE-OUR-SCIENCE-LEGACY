The Mars Observer was launched on September 25, 1992. The spacecraft was lost in the vicinity of Mars on August 21, 1993 when the spacecraft began its maneuvering sequence for Martian orbital insertion. This videotape shows a lecture by Suzanne R. Dodd, the Mission Planning Team Chief for the Mars Observer Project. Ms Dodd begins with a brief overview of the mission and the timeline from the launch to orbital insertion. Ms Dodd then reviews slides showing the trajectory of the spacecraft on its trip to Mars. Slides of the spacecraft being constructed are also shown. She then discusses the Mars orbit insertion and the events that will occur to move the spacecraft from the capture orbit into a mapping orbit. During the trip to Mars, scientists at JPL had devised a new strategy, called Power In that would allow for an earlier insertion into the mapping orbit. The talk summarizes this strategy, showing on a slide the planned transition orbits. There are shots of the Martian moon, Phobos, taken from the Viking spacecraft, as Ms Dodd explains that the trajectory will allow the orbiter to make new observations of that moon. She also explains the required steps to prepare for mapping after the spacecraft has achieved the mapping orbit around Mars. The lecture ends with a picture of Mars from the Observer on its approach to the planet.", "title": "Mars Observer Lecture: Mars Orbit Insertion", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000063385, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dodd, Suzanne R."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "404dd5908de14905a505ae922291bd79"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000063385, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000063385, "id": "dfd1ea5b350f4b53a5f1f580e42d2436", "publicationDate": "1993-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
