Measurements with circularly polarized waves, however, conducted in 1976 suggest that the types of surface irregularities found on the Galilean satellites must be very different from those on the moon and the inner planets. A description is presented of an investigation in which geometrical optics and the Stokes-vector formalism are employed to examine several possible configurations which could cause the circular polarization transmitted to exceed unity. On the basis of the obtained results it appears that a model which postulates that significant parts of the surfaces of the three satellites are covered with an icy layer at least several kilometers thick and saturated with hemispherical craters can explain nearly all the observed radar behavior.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "34", "submissionId": 19780054420, "id": "f1596a135d0b41ada5e4b5bc7e856877", "publicationName": "Icarus", "publicationDate": "1978-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
