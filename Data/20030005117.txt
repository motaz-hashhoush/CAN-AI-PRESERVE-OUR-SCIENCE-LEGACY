b'Heat\n\nLoss\n\nImagery\n\nSince the oil embargo of 1973, NASA has been\nincreasingly\nactive in the national energy program, not\nonly in technology\ndevelopment\nfor new energy sources\nbut also in promoting\nmore efficient use of traditional\nfossil fuels. It is estimated\nthat almost 30 percent of the\nfuel burned for heating residences\nand larger buildings\nescapes through inadequately\ninsulated\nwalls and roofs.\nTo help focus public awareness\nof this heat loss problem,\nLewis Research Center has used the remote sensing\ntechnique\nof infrared thermography\nto record roof\ntemperatures\nfrom aircraft. Generally,\ninfrared scanning\ndevices produce images that show--by\ncolor or\nblack-and-white\nshading differences--which\nbuildings\nare losing heat to the outdoors\nand to what extent.\nAn example of Lewis\' community\nservice work in\n\nVAN\n\nSCAN\n\nThermogram,\n\nDaedalus\n\nEnterprises,\n\nInc.\n\nenergy conservation\nis an "outreach"\nproject-undertaken\nin cooperation\nwith the City of Cleveland\nand\nthe East Ohio Gas Company--wherein\nLewis used aerial\nthermography\nto produce heat loss images of sections of\nCleveland.\nThe cooperating\nagencies then followed up\nwith public displays, neighborhood\nmeetings and wide\ndistribution\nof informational\npackages.\nThe program,\nwhich has met with considerable\nsuccess,\nwas aimed at\neducating the public to the mechanisms\nof heat loss and\nmotivating\nhomeowners\nto install more effective\ninsulation.\nAs a by-product,\nit stimulated\ninterest in\nthermographic\nservices provided by commercial\nfirms,\nexamples of which are shown above and left.\nTexas Instruments\nIncorporated,\nDallas, Texas\nmanufactures\nthe RS-300 series scanners and conducts\nairbome heat loss surveys,\nsuch as Operation\nSky Scan,\nin which some 900 communities\nin Iowa, South Dakota\nand Illinois were surveyed.\nThe upper illustration\nis an\nexample of the black-and-white\nimagery produced\nin Sky\nScan. The shades of gray represent the amount of\nthermal energy radiating from the residential area\npictured; houses with the lightest roof tones are losing\nthe most heat. Large-area\nsurveys like Sky Scan provide\na method of evaluating\nheat loss in residential,\ncommercial\nand industrial areas at relatively low\nsingle-building\ncost.\nDaedalus Enterprises,\nInc., Ann Arbor, Michigan\nproduces\nseveral types of airborne infrared and\nmultispectral\nscanners.\nThe company has developed\na\npatented ground-mobile\ntechnique to use this technology\nfor scanning building sidewalls for heat loss. At left is a\nVANSCAN\n\xc2\xae thermograph\nshowing varying degrees of\nheat loss through walls and windows of a residential\nbuilding; white, red and yellow indicate greatest heat\nloss, blue and blue-green\nshow losses of lesser degree.\nTexas Instruments,\nDaedalus\nand other companies\nconducting\nheat loss surveys are experiencing\ngrowing\nacceptance\nof their services among industrial firms,\nutilities, local governments,\nstate and federal agencies\ninterested in promoting\nheat loss awareness\nand inspiring\ncorrective\nactions.\n_"VANSCAN\n\n112\n\nis a registered\n\ntrademark\n\nof Daedalus\n\nEnterprises,\n\nInc.\n\n'
