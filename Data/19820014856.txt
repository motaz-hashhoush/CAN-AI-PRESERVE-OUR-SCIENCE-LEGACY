b'SPS CONSTRUCTION PERSPECTI VE/SUMMARY\nH. E. Benson\nNASA/JSC-\n\nHouston,\n\nTexas\n\n_\n\nI_\n\n82\'\n\n22730\n\nStudies have been conducted on the construction of Solar Power Satellites and\nthe following paragraphs discuss the perspective which can be drawn from the\nstudies.\nThe SPS size requires space construction.\nA 5 GW Satellite may be as large as\n54 square KM. The overall density of this constructed Satellite is in the order\nof .0002 KG/M _. Launching an assembled Satellite of this density would be impractical for two reasons:\nI. The assembled structure would not be able to\nwithstand the launch loads, and 2. The number of launches required to launch\nassembled structure of this density would require an extensive number of launches thus causing the transportation\ncost of an SPS system to be prohibitive.\n\n:.:..\n\n,.\n\nSpace construction will consist of simple and repetitive, construction operations.\nThese operations will impact the design of the Satellite.\nAs an example,\nalthough studies indicate the mass of a photovoltaic and thermal-cycle Satellite configurations\nare similar, the construction of the two are different.\nThe photovoltaic configuration\nis favored since it is a simple geometry which\nallows repetitive operations.\nThe thermal-cycle\nsystem has many different\noperations such as fluid connections, radiators and a complex geometry.\n\n!i\n\n.\'.,\n,\n\n, ,\n:\n\n"\n\n.".\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 -:2..i.\n\nStudies have indicated that large assembly factories located in geosynchronous\norbit (GEO) could build an SPS in space in a period of six months.\nThe power\nF,,\'.\n:\'",; "\ni\n\neneration system (solar array and structure) and the power transmission system\nmcrowave\nantenna) would be built at the same time with a crew size in the\n_order\nof 400.\nFigure l depicts the antenna in red and the solar array in blue.\nA logistics base in low earth orbit manned with approximately\n200 personnel\nwould be required to support the assembly base in GEO.\nConstruction\nof an SPS can be accomplished\nin either LEO or GEO.\nIf LEO is\nused it will be necessary for the construction operation to build the SPS in\npieces in LEO and final assemble the pieces in GEO. This is necessary since\nthe principal loads are aerodynamic and graviety gradient and these loads would\nbe prohibitive on a final assembled SPS in LEO. The debris collision hazard\nand the earth shadow thermal cycling is also greater in LEO.\nFor maintenance\nconsiderations,\nit will be necessary to provide maintenance\nfacilities in GEO\neither on the Satellite or facility additions to a construction base located in\nGEO.\nThe main crew considerations\nare the stay time on orbit.\nNinety days appears\nto be a reasonable duty period considering:\nRemote confinement,\nzero-G effects\non the body and nominal radiation exposure.\nFor GEO, EVA activities will be\nlimited due to increased radiation exposure and storm cellars will be required\nfor major solar events.\nThe primary construction functions will be to maintain\nand operate equipment, and final assembly and checkout.\n\n-\n\nIn conclusion,\nit is recognized that the ability to construct an SPS must be\ndeveloped through an evolutionary process.\nThis process would begin with\nShuttle operations and when construction\ntimelines exceed the Shuttle capability small manned bases in LEO will be used.\nThis technology evolution would\ngather the experience and knowledge to build large bases in LEO and GEO to\nsupport an SPS construction capability.\n\n301\n\nF-:]\n\n;L-.:i;i>\n\n[-\n\ni".\n\n- ,.\n\nN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n...... :i\'i\n\nL. \'_ : I:.\n\ni"\n\n,)\n\nORIG!."!AL PAGE\n\n:-_\n".2:\n\n...i \xc2\xb8\n\nL \xe2\x80\xa2,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n.\n\ni\n\n.\n\n.,\n\no.\'\n\n,\n\n;.:.-\n\n"\n\n.\n\n2" !\xe2\x80\xa2\'; "\' "\n\n;..2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\', :\n\nFigures I.\n\nGEO Assembly Base\n\n302\n\n-,\n\n"_\n\n:-\',/,\n\nL\n\n./\n\n-..\n\n'
