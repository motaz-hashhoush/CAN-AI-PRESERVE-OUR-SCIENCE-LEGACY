b'NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS\n\nJ\n\nTECHNICAL MEMORANDUM 1410\n\nTHEORY AND EXPERD1ENTS ON SUPERSONIC\nAIR-TO-AIR EJECTORS*\nBy J. Fabri and J. Paulon\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEjectors have been employed in industry for a very long time; most\nfrequently, however, their use has been restricted to rather special\ncases of operation. The extrapolation of recorded performance under\nthese conditions did not permit achieving with certainty the design of\na configuration of large power which was supposed to have satisfactory\nextraction capacity over a wide range of mass flows and compression\nratios. Systematic testing and the theory of high-compression ejectors\n(that is, ejectors whose primary flow is supersonic) have been taken up\nmore recently in various countries (refs. I, 2, and 3). The elementary\ntheory, which we have proposed (ref. 4) for interpretation of the test\nperformance in the case of cylindrical mixers, is essentially aerodynamical. It determines the suction characteristics of a supersonic\nejector by the conditions of aerodynamic compatibility between the\nexisting flows, written in simplified geometrical representations of\nthe configuration and independent of any consideration of the viscosity\nand diffusion phenomena which establish and maintain the regime. Due\nto this fact, it does not permit representing the influence of certain\nimportant parameters like the relative length of the mixer or the reciprocal positions of the primary and secondary jets. The actual agreement\nof the results of this theory with the measured results, when it is\napplied to predicting the operation of installations for the optimum\nempirical values of the above parameters, justifies fully the viewpoint\nwe adopted; beSides, a reduced number of diagrams permits, with sufficient accuracy, the achievement of a preliminary design for an ejector\ncorresponding to a given set of requirements, or the discussion of the\nextraction possibilities by a given source of primary flow (ref. 5).\nWe thought it of interest to present here an experimental verification of this entire theory, taking into consideration (as we did previously in the special case of the regime of zero induced mass flow in\nref. 6) the load losses due to the friction at the wall in the subsonic\npart of the motion.\n*"Theorie et experimentation des ejecteurs supersoniques air-air."\nO.N.E.R.A. Note Technique No. 36, 1956.\n\nNACA \'lM 1410\n\n2\n\nII. TEST APPARATVS\n\nThe experimental results presented below have been obtained with\nthe aid of a device of very small dimensions whose input supply may be\nobtained from the compressed air of the city distribution system or,\nfor high generating pressures, from commercial high-pressure bottles.\nThe mounting is done by means of metal bodies of revolution, screwed\nend to end. They are easy to interchange, thus permitting various\ngeometrical configurations. In each of them (fig. 1), a primary settling chamber supplies a supersonic nozzle after the primary flow has\npassed through a convergent tube and a cylindrical inlet channel. The\nsecondary circuit which drains in the surrounding atmosphere includes\na mass-flow meter (convergent entry or calibrated diaphgragm), a regulating valve for the mass flOW, and a settling chamber. The two coaxial\nflows make contact (plane 1) in the cylindrical mixing tube, of the\nlength L which is followed (plane 2) by a divergent portion with halfangle a, the end of which (plane 3), opens into the atmosphere at the\npressure p. Two mixers of different diameters can be used in the\napparatus.\nAmong the supersonic nozzles used, whose main dimensions are reproduced in figure 2, the majority, such as B, C, D, E are geometrically\nconstituted (for ease of manufacture) of two truncated cones which have\na common base at the throat. They produce in their exit section a flow\nof conical character; in the case of the nozzle El, the d.ivergent part\nof whi.ch is doubly curved, the exit flow is, on the contrary, reasonably\nuniform.\nThe generating pressures of the two flows, knowledge of which is\nnecessary for the calculation of the primary mass flow and of the compreSSion ratio of the ejector, respectively, are obtained wit h the aid\nof pressure taps at the wall of the settling chambers of the two flows.\nThis measurement does not present any particular difficulty; nevertheless, due to the load losses in the inlet flOW, which are practically\nindependent of the configuration conSidered, the generating pressure of\nthe primary supersonic flows represents only 96 percent of the inlet\npressure, measured in the settling chamber upstream. This last pressure\nwhich we consider below, for convenience of reading, as characteristic\nfor the primary flow, must therefore be corrected in the numerical\napplications.\n\nNACA TM 1410\n\n3\n\nIII. OPERATIONAL SCHEME OF AN EJECTOR\nThe one-dimensional description of the aerodynamic operation of\nthe ejectors used is greatly simplified due to the care we have taken\nin placing, as much as possible, the exit section of the primary flow\nin the cylindrical part of the mixer. However, the scheme of calculation differs from the one previously described (ref. 4) as a result of\nthe need - so that the calculation should follow the measured results\nwith more precision - on the one hand, to take into account the load\nlosses due to the wall friction in the subsonic part of the flow, and on\nthe other hand, in view of the very small scale of the apparatus, not to\nneglect the wall thickness of the primary nozzle at its end in the different aerodynamic balances. Finally, for operations at low generating\npressures, we assumed that the primary flow did not completely fill its\nnozzle, and the corresponding calculations were performed by generalization of a method described elsewhere (ref. 6) for vacuum pumps without\nsecondary mass flow .\nWe take as unity the outlet section S of the primary nozzle\n(figs. 1 and 4) and denote by A the cylindrical section of the mixer\nand by A\' - 1 (slightly smaller than A - 1) the outlet section of the\nsecondary flow; 1 we utilize, furthermore, the geometrical parameters A*,\nthe ratio of the mixer cross section to the cross section at the throat\nof the primary nozzle,2 and cr, the ratio of the end sections of the\noutlet-divergent tube. The aerodynamic description of the motion is\ngiven for every flow by means of the critical Mach number ~, the ratio\nof the local mean velocity to the critical sonic velocity a* of the\nflow conSidered. The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the three\nplanes of reference already indicated; we reserve the subscript 0 for\ndenoting the contingent separation cross section of the primary flow in\nthe driving nozzle and the subscript i for the quantities of the generating conditions. A prime deSignates the primary flow and a double\nprime the secondary flow when these two flows are distinct; the absence\nof a prime corresponds to the hypothesis of a homogeneous mixing of the\ntwo flows. We assume, furthermore, the specific heats of the two gases\nbefore and after the mixing to be constant (designating the fundamental\ngrouping connected with the ratio of the specific heats by\nm2 = (r + l) /(r - 1)), and we assume that, in the entire series of tests\nperformed, the primary and secondary generating t emperatures are constant and equal.\nlThe calculation of A\' is easily performed, starting from the\nterminal dimensions given in figure 2 .\n2Since the primary nozzles have very similar throat surfaces, the\nparaneter A* assumes, in practice, in all our configurations only two\ndifferent values, according to the mixer used.\n\nNACA ~ 1410\n\n4\n\n3.1. Supersonic Regimes\nWhen the generating pressure of the primary flow is sufficiently\nlarge, with respect to the back pressure of the medium into which the\nejector discharges, the supersonic flow, started in the primary tube,\nsubsists in the mixer and the induced fluid itself is entrained at high\nspeed (fig. 3(a)).3 It is then clear that the pressure conditions downstream do not impose any limitation of mass flow on the mixer, and the\ninduced mass flow is equal to the maximum admissible in the coexistence\nof the two streams . The latter holds beyond section 1 for a certain\nlength. If the development of the secondary flow, generally subsonic,\ncan be described, with good approximation, within the classical hypothesis of motions in sections, that of the supersonic primary flow\ndepends on the method of the characteristics. But when the pressure\npi of the secondary flow is lower than the pressure pi of the primary flow at the nozzle exit, the latter spreads in the mixing tube and\nattains in the section of maximum expansion (subscript e) a quasiuniform structure. This occurs in such a manner that it is possible to\nconsider between the planes 1 and e a universal one-dimensional and\nisentropic behavior of the two fluids, since the local continuity of\nthe pressures on the surface of the two jets evidently does not entail\nthe equality of the mean pressures p~ and p~.\nThe finite thickness of the walls of the primary nozzle in its end\nsection entails the existence of a wake, very obvious in the shadowgraphs. One can assume that, over the small length which separates the\nplanes 1 and e in the mixer, the section A - A\' of this wake is\nin practice not supplied by either flow whose mixing is still negligible.\nIf v (fig. 4) designates the expansion section of the primary jet, we\ncan write the equat ions of continuity for each flow in the form\n1\n\nA\' -\n\nv\n\nA\' - 1\n\n(1)\n\n=\n\n3In the configurations represented in shadowgraphs in figure 3, the\nprimary flow issues, at the mean Mach number M*\' = 1.78, from a plane\n1\n\ndivergent nozzle (dihedral of 10 0 ) into a plane cylindrical mixing tube\nwith a ratio of sections A = 2.61. The four views correspond to an equal\nopening of the secondary valve.\n\n5\n\nNACA TM 1410\nwhere the pressures are those of the isentropic expansion\n\n.-L\nP,\ne\n\nm\n(2 -\n\n-r =\n\nPl\n\n~ \'2)7-1\n\n~\n\nm2\n\nP"\ne\n\ne\n\'2\'\n\n---u =\n\nPl\n\n1\n\n( m2 -\n\n~\n\n2\nm - M\n\n"2)7~1\n\ne\n"2\n\n*e\n\nIf we then apply to each of the two flows the moment.um theorem\nbetween the planes 1 and e, we note that the integrals of the pressures on the primary and secondary faces of the wake are opposite\naccording to the condition of local continuity of the pressures, and\nwe obtain, by addition, the universal relationship\n\ntt2\n1 + M*\n1 + ~\'2\n1\n1\np\'\n+ (A\' - l)p"\n1 m2 _\n1 m _\nu2\n\'2\n2\nM*l\n~l\n"2\n1 + M*\n1 + M* \'2\ne\ne\nvp\'\n+ (A\' _ \'v )p"\ne\ne m _\n"2\n\'2\n2\nm2 - M*\n~e\ne\n\n=\n\n(3)\n\nIntroducing then the condition of optimum operation indicated at\nthe beginning of this section, for instance, M*" = 1, we can - for\ne\n.\nt\nglven va1 ues 0 f Pl\' M\'\n*1\' " , - so1 ve th e five equations (1), (2), and\nf\\\n(3) with respect to the variables\n\nv,\n\np~,\n\nM* " and M*", and\ne\ne\ndeduce from them the suction capacity of the apparatus. The fundamental\nnondimensional characteristic of an ejector is then obtained by representing the ratio ~ of the secondary to primary mass flows as a function of the ratio ru of the extraction pressure p\': to the back pres1sure downstream P\n1\n\n"2fl\n"f4\'r\n2 tl\n"(\n\n- M*\np.\n1\n1\n(A\' - l)~ , ,\n\'2\nPi M*l m2 - M*\n1\n\n~\n\n7\n\nrv\n\nill\n\nPelt,\n\n=\n\nPl\n\nP m2\n\nm\n\n"2\n~l\n\n(4)\n\nNACA TM 1410\n\n6\n\n3.1.1.- When\n\np"\n\n1\n\nis greater than\n\np\', the primary jet is initially\n1\n\nconvergent (fig. 3(b)), and the secondary mass flow is limited only by\nthe aerodynamic blocking of the section (~\' - 1) of the supply conduit.\nThe condition for optimum operation, therefore, becomes M*" = 1, and\n1\n\nwe then have in the (~,m) diagram the linear characteristic of the saturated supersonic regime\n1\n\n_1 ))\'_1\n~\'2\n1\n\nwhich is . joined continuously to the representative branch of the pure\nsupersonic regimes, represented parametrically by equation (4). The\nslope of the straight lines (eq. (5)) is inversely proportional to the\nprimary generating pressure; nevertheless, it is quite clear that the\nmass flow entrained by an ejector operating in a saturated regime is,\nfor a given value of\ncompletely independent of the pressure p~.\n\nm,\n\nl\n\nWe shall finally note that, when the conditions of existence for\nthese supersonic regimes are satisfied, the operation of the ejector is\ndetermined by the laws of the aerodynamics of perfect fluids; the viscosity phenomena have only the effect of delaying more or less the\nappearance of these regimes and govern only the start of the phenomenon.\n3.2. Mixed Regime\nIf we reduce the primary generating pressure, the supersonic mixer\ndeenergizes itself partially by progressive increase of shock waves\n(fig. 3(c)); thus the entrainment takes place between two subsonic\nstreams, and the induced mass flow is limited by the possibility of exit\nof the total flow which is supposed to be made uniform in velocity and\npressure in the end section of the mixer. The configuration of the\nmotion depends, thus, closely on the characteristics of the conduits,\nalready defined from the geometrical viewpoint; the determination from\nthe mechanical viewpoint will be achieved by the supplementary parameter of the mean turbulent - friction coefficient f of the gas at the\nwall. The uniformity of the subsonic stream issuing from the two flows\nis then supposed to be aChieved, owing to a sufficient settling length\n1 in the entrance section of the diffuser. The mean load loss of the\nflow between the planes 1 and 2 may be represented, within the frame\nwork of the one-dimensional theory of the turbulent flows in the conduits, by the approximate formula\n\n7\n\nNACA \'IM l4l0\n\n( 6)\n\nwhere p denotes the specific mass of the fluid and ~ the ratio of\nthe lateral surface of the stream to its transverse section AS) here)\nfor instance) 4l/D; D is the diameter of the mixing tube.\n\'The continuity and the momentum equations are then written) between\nsections 1 and 2 of the mixing tube (ref. 7)\n\npi (l +\nm2 _\n\nM*~2~\n~r2\n\npi\n\n+\n\n1\n\nP\nA\n\n[1\n2\n\n+\n\n(1\n\nt"\n\n1)\n\nf~ m2 +\n\n+ 2\n\nm2 _\n\nm2\n\nl + M*\n\n"2\n\n1\n\n2\n,,2\nm - ~l\n\n+ (, m2\n\n"~\n\n( 7)\n\n11M.2~\n\n2\n\n~\n\n2\n\nThey permit deduction of the secondary operational conditions (pi)\n\n\'t{\n\nfrom the parameters (Pl)\ndriving nozzle when\ncalculated from (P3)\n\n(P2)\n\nM*i)\n\nof the primary flow at the exit of the\nare disposed of.\n\nThese quantities are\n\nM*3) by means of equations which represent) on the\n\none hand) the continuity of the mass flow between the planes\n\n2\n\nand\n\n3\n\n( 8)\n\nand) on the other hand) the expansion of the pressures in the diffuser\nbetween these same sections.

The reduced variables (~, ill) are\nalways calculated according to their definition (eq. (4)) which does\nnot present any particular difficulty. Neverthless, it is important to\nselect a convenient value for f. The turbulent friction of the air at\nthe smooth walls of the mixer corresponds to a coefficient f, which\nthe universal relationship (ref. 9)\n\\\n\nf -1/2 = 4 log Rf 1/2 - 0.4\nor its approximate representations permit calculating from the transverse\nReynolds number R of the stream. According to this formula, the values\nof f relative to the flow in plane 2 change only slightly in our tests.\nFor sim\nplification, we performed the numerical calculations with the\nsingle mean value f = 0.0053.\n3 . 3. Mixed Regime With Primary Separation\nFor still lower primary generating pressures, the aerodynamic char acter of the primary flow and, consequently, the suction characteristic\nof the pump are influenced by the geometrical form of the nozzle . I n\nfact, the one - dimensional theory of nozzle would lead us normall y to\npredict, as a mixed- operation limit for low generating pressures, the\nconfiguration in which equality would be attained between the secondary\npressure\nand the pressure of the subsonic flow resulting from the\n\nPl\n\nprimary flow through a straight shock under the condit i ons\nfor instance\n\n(Pl\' M*l)\'\n\n\'J\n\nNACA\n\n\'IM\n\n1410\n\n9\n\nm2M*1\'2\n\n-\n\n1\n\np\'\n\n1\n\nThe operation would t hen be come like that of a class i cal subsoni c eje ctor. It is possib le that thi s s cheme could have s ome valu e when the\ndriving nozzle i s eff e ctive l y sub ject to deener gizat ion by i ncre a se of\nstraight or mor e compl ex shock wave s in the diver gent tube . This possibility seems to be fa cilit a t e d by t he pre s ence of an infl e ct ion p oint\nin the meridi an of the latter . However, in the very frequent case of\nnozzles with conical diver gent tube s, no straight-wave configurat ion\nappears, in general, to cause the deenergization of the primary f l ow .\nRather, we observe (f ig . 3(d)) the persiste nce of a supersoni c jet\nissuing no l onger f r om t he e dges of the nozzle but from a parallel i nterior of the divergent t ube (plane 0). If we assume that the se condary\npressure pi prevails i n the whole unfilled part of the nozzle b etween\nthe planes 0 and 1, we may , without changing at all the first of equations (7), modi fy the s e cond i n the following manner:\n\n+\n\nf\n\nPl (,,\' -\n\n1 + ~"2\n1)\n\nm2 _\n\n1\n\nM 112\n\n+\n\n1) -\n\nA~\n\n"\n\n*1\n\nwhere evi dently\n1\n\nAo =\n\np\'\no\np!\n\n(11)\n\n1\n\nAccor d i ng t o a commonly assumed rule (ref. 10), the reversible pre s sure of the s uper s onic flow in the plane where separation occurs represents pract ically always the same fraction of the back pressure wh ich\nacts downstream on t he fre e surface of the jet. This amounts to saying\nthat the obli que shock waves, across the flow is deflected toward the\naxiS, and separates from the wall, have a reasonably constant compression\n\nNACA\'I\'M 1410\n\n10\n\nratio. The mean experimental value of this ratio, near 2.5, according\nto the measurements made for the conical nozzles usually employed in\nrocket motors,4 agrees rather well with the theoretical values of the\ncompression ratios of the oblique waves which, within the range of Mach\nnumbers considered) must cause the separation of the stream, due to\ntheir interaction with the boundary layer of the flow (ref. 11).\nIf we therefore adopt, for want of a more accurate rule, in our\ncalculations the supplementary condition\n\nthe number of unknowns contained in equations (7) to (7\') remains at two\n(taking eq. (11) into account), and the solution may be sought in the\nmanner indicated for the ordinary mixed regime, and abandoned as soon\nas\n(12)\n\n3.4. Operational Characteristics\nThe group of theoretical mass-flow-pressure characteristics corresponding to the various supersonic and mixed regimes determines gener ally, for a given primary generating pressure and a given extraction\npressure p\',\', different possible values for the entrained mass flow\nl\n(fig. 5) from which the one that has been effectively realized must be\nchosen. It is evident that the possibilities of ejection into the surrounding atmosphere generally determine this choice. The supersonic\nregime is produced only if the mixed regime is very large; this simply\namounts to chOOSing, between a supersonic or mixed characteristic, the\none which, for a given extraction pressure, involves the lesser secondary mass flow. Conversely, the mixed regime with separation which prevails over the ordinary mixed regime - at least in certain nozzles with\nconical divergent tubes - under the conditions (eq. (12)), which involve\nonly basic aerodynamics, is generally accompanied by an improvement in\nthe eje ctor performance . (Cf. Rep. No. 44.)\n\n4Nozzles which are generally adapted at expansion ratios\n\n"\n\nPi/Pi.\n\nfrom 15 to 30 (1.6 ~ ~4~ ~ 1. 9 ); beSides, it is evident that the rule\ncould not be applied to slightly supersonic flows (for\n\n~\'\n1\n\n= 1.37,\n\nthe\n\nshock which gives a compression ratio of 2.5 is straight).\n\n________________1\n\n11\n\nNACA \'IM 1410\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISONS\nThe experimental study of the ejectors with supersonic primary flow\nhas been conducted so as to compare the experimental mass flows and\npressures with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, in the group\nof experimental findings which we present in this section, the curves\nplotted have always been obtained a priori from the equations of Report\nNo.3. Under the conditions we have specified, the points correspond\nto the measured results.\n.\nFigures 6 and 7 give, in all their apparent complexity, the family\nof suction characteristics of two similar ejectors for different values\nof the primary generating pressure. The second configuration is distinguished from the first by the addition of a diffuser. We observe, for\npi = 5.5p in the two cases, and with the same performance, which is\ncompletely independent of the geometry downstream, first a pure, then\na saturated supersonic regime. For p! = 4.5p, we observe both superl\n\nsonic regimes when the mixer is provided with a diffuser and the mixed\nregime is followed by the saturated supersonic regime in the configuration without diffuser. For p! = 3.5p, we find the mixed regime going\nl\nover into the saturated supersonic regime in the configuration containing\nthe diffuser, and only the mixed regime in the other case. For\npi = 2.5p, we observe the mixed regime with separation in both\nconfigurations.\nOn the whole, the agreement between calculation and tests is good,\nand the interpretation of the practical operational characteristics of\nan ejector is greatly facilitated by the theoretical discussion of the\nvarious regimes. Concerning the seemingly abnormal behavior of the\nexperimental supersonic characteristic in the neighborhood of zero\ninduced mass flow, we recall that the suction pressure pI.\' in the secl\n\nondary settling chamber may be identified, under these conditions, with\nthe base pressure of the abrupt enlargement of the primaryrflow in the\nplane 1. In the case of the supersonic regime, this last pressure does\nnot derive from an elementary aerodynamic calculation like the one presented here (ref. 6) . Instead of an isentropic expanSion, which by a\ntangential contact causes it to fill the entire cross section of the\nmixing tube, the primary free jet in its expansion has an impact on the\ncylindrical Wall. There, according to a condition which is inversely\nanalogous to that encountered in the study of separation of a boundary\nlayer due to shock-wave action, the stability of the return in a guided\njet is insured only when the compression ratio of the oblique waves\nstemming from the impact has a definite value. Feeding of the secondary\njet, even at a very small mass flow, brings this phenome,non to a stop J\n\nNACA TM 1410\n\n12\n\nand the test points then agree again with the theoretical supersonic\ncharacteristics.\n\n4.1.\n\nInfluence of the Length of the Mixer\n\nThe length of the mixing tube is an important parameter of the\napparatus; it is convenient, for judging its influence on the extraction capacity of a given ejector, to study the variation of the extraction pressure obtained as a function of S, in mixed regime, for a given\nprimary generating pressure and secondary mass flow (fig. 8). Between\nthe very small values of S, at which the supersonic jet passes out into\nthe surrounding atmosphere practically without action, and the very large\nvalues of s where the load losses of the flow, reorganized in the mixing\ntube, become important, the secondary generating pressure passes through\na minimum for a value of sm representing the lengthening of the cylindrical mixer. This cause s, under the operational conditions considered\n(pi/ p , M*i, A,\nthe suction ratio ill which is optimum for the\n\ncr),\n\nadopted value of ~. We see that the theory represents the variation\nof m very satisfactorily when S > sm\'\nThis limiting value depends, in fact, on the primary generating\npressure. We see, for instance, that in mixed regime the more the supersonic phase of the driving jet is extended (figs. 3(c) and 3(d)), the\nhigher its generating pressure, so that an increase of pi/p causes,\nin this case, a reduction of the length of the mixer which is active in\nthe subsonic mixing of the jets and, consequently, an increase of the\nminimum length sm \' One can also predict, for values of pi!p high\nenough \xc2\xb7to make the supersonic regime prevail, that the value of sm\ndecreases again, to remain afterwards independent of pi/Po In a general manner , we may assume that the theory always represents correctly\nthe effect of lengthening the mixing tube for s-values higher than 50.\nFigures 9(a), (b), and (c) which represent, for three increasing primary\ngenerating pressures, the theoretical and experimental suction characteristics of ejectors which differ only in the length of their mixers,\nconfirm this result. In figure 9(c), in particular, we see that, as\npredicted, the performance in the supersonic regime is not influenced\nby the length of the mixer as long as the latter is sufficient to make\nthe establishment of the regime possible.\n4.2. Influence of the Terminating Diffuser\nAs in the preceding consideration regarding the relative length of\nthe mixer (parameter s), the terminating diffuser actually influences\n\n13\n\nNACA TM 1410\n\nthe performance uf the ejector only during operation in mixed regime;\nas a result, it governs the limit where the supersonic regimes appear.\nFigure 10 compares the mass flow-pressure characteristics of a given\nejector for three different terminating configurations under identical\nprimary conditions. We see how much an efficient diffuser facilitates\nestablishment of the supersonic regime and thereby improves the suction\ncharacteristics of the ejector.\n4.3. Influence of the Cross Section of the Mixer\nThe ratio A* of the cross section of the mixer to that of the\nthroat of the primary nozzle is a fundamental operational parameter. In\nfigures 11 and 12, which correspond to figures 6 and 7, respectively,\nwe represent the theoretical characteristics \' and the test points pertaining to the nozzle D operating in the mixer of large cross section.\nThe definite improvement of the extraction conditions obtained when the\nmixer is provided with a diffuser is also correctly represented by the\ntheory. Likewise, we note that, as a result of the large ratio of the\nsections, the supersonic regime appears now only for rather high generating pressures.\n4.4. Influence of the Primary Mach Number\nIn order to make evident the influence of the Mach number at the\nexit of the primary nozzle, we represent in figures 13(a), (b), (c),\nand (d) the theoretical and experimental performances of the nozzles B,\nC, D, and E for different primary generating pressures and the same\nmixer. We see that the less rapid nOZZles, B and C, maintain mixed\nbehavior at low generating pressures, whereas the separated regime prevails in the nozzles D and E. If, in this last case, the test points\nfollow the theoretical curves rather irregularly, we must not forget\nthat the corresponding regimes easily become more unstable than those\nin which the nozzles are completely energized. On the other hand, the\nempirical rule (eq. (12)) adopted for fixing the cross section of separation certainly does not have the universal character which we assume\nit to have in order to simplify the calculations.\nFigure 14 compares the characteristics of the nozzles E and El.\nThese nozzles, which differ only by the geometrical form of their divergent tube and, consequently, by their tendency to show separations at\nthe instant of their deenergization, have, in the supersonic regime and\nat the beginning of the mixed regime, the same suction capacities in a\ngiven mixer. However, it becomes quite clear that, at low primary generating pressures, the performance of the conical nozzle E is representative of the regimes with separation, whereas the performance of the\n\n14\n\nNACA 1M 1410\n\ndoubly curved nozzle El is representative of the pure mixed regimes\nwhich are clearly less favorable than the preceding ones.\n\n4.5. Influence of the Position of the Primary Nozzle\nThe theoretical representation, the experimental verification of\nwhich we study here, assumes baSically that the primary nozzle discharges\ninto a cylindrical mixer. This is not the only geometriGal shape amenable to calculation, because the momentum theorem, on whose application\nthe numerical description of the mixed regime is essentially based, finds\na universal simple expreSSion also if it is written between the extreme\ncross sections of the mixer, in the case where the cross section of the\nlatter develops, so that the pressure along the wall can be considered\nconstant over the entire length separating the planes of reference.\nThis mixing at constant pressure presents perhaps mixed performance\nsuperior to that permitted by mixing in a cylindrical stream (ref. 2),\nbut its control is difficult and the construction of the various geometrical configurations is complicated. For this reason we have limited\nourselves, in this report, to the study of the simple case of the\ncylindrical mixer.\n\nl\n\nNevertheless, our configurations permitted convenient axial displacement of the primary and secondary duc.ts with respect to one another\nand even the eventual withdrawal of the ejection cross section of the\nprimary flow into the secondary settling chamber (fig. 1). Although the\ngeometrical configuration of the arrangement under these conditions no\nlonger conforms to the theoretical repre sentation described, the measured performance does not appreciably differ from that which we are to\ncal culate, at least if the ratio A is suffiCiently large (driving\nnozzles with small external dimensions). These are the findings indicated in figure 15, which shows the experimental characteristics corresponding to three particular pOSitions of the primary-exit cross section. 5 In contrast, we see in figure 16, obtained under analogous\n\n5The parameter X, indicated in figures 15 and 16, marks the position of the plane of the terminal section of the primary nozzle along\nthe axis of the ejector, starting from the abscissa X = 0 indicated in\nfigur e 1. As in the calculation of the apparent length ~ of the mixing\ntube, the distances are referred to one-fourth of the diameter of the\nmixing tube. For the mixing tube of small cross section, the primary\nflow discharges into the secondary convergent tube in the configurations\no ~ X < 3.4. For X > 3.4, the contact between the two flows takes place\nin-the cylindrical tube. The experimental results recorded in the various figures of this study correspond, unless noted otherwise, to the\nposition X = 4.8 for the nozzles B, C, D, and, for E and El, to\nX = 2.7 and X = 3.7, respectively, with the small and the large mixing\ntube.\n\n15\n\nNACA \'IM 1410\n\nconditions with a nozzle of greater external dimensions, that the modifications in the geometric configuration of the secondary stream caused\nby the displacement of the nozzle may considerably transform the suction\ncharacteristics of the ejector, primarily in the saturated supersonic\nregimes. In fact, the existence of these mixed regimes does not belong\nin the scheme of mixing tubes with parallel flows and is encountered in\ncurrent installations every time when the secondary mass flow is subject\nto limitation by a geometrically well-defined throat. We perceive here\nthat the displacement of the driving nozzle causes, according to the\ndirection in which it occurs, a change in the cross section of the secondary geometrical throat, favorable or unfavorable to the performance\nof the configuration.\n\n4.6. Longitudinal Pressure Distributions\nThe one-dimensional theoretical representation of the supersonic\nregime assumes that the secondary flow is accelerated along the primary\nflow and that the appearance of a sonic section limits the secondary\nmass flow. The pressure condition which we have achieved at the wall\nof the mixing tube confirms this hypothesis.\nFigure 17 represents several longitudinal distributions of the\npressure 6 corresponding to different induced mass flows and to the same\nprimary generating pressure sufficiently high to make the supersonic\nregime prevail for the overall combination of suction characteristics.\nIn the operation at zero induced mass flow, the quasi-periodic distribution of the pressure in the neighborhood of the exit cross section of\nthe primary flow and before the final deenergization of the stream\narises from the jet structure itself. It lasts as long as the secondary\nmass flow is sufficiently weak to make the flow retain the character of\na boundary layer. For larger values of the mass flow, the pressure in,\nthe secondary flow remains constant and equal to the value\n= 0.53\n\np"/pi\n\nof the sonic flows.\n\n6Since the pressure taps at the wall of the\nsufficiently numerous to\nation, we placed side by\npoints which correspond,\nent neighboring relative\nto the mixing tube.\n\ngive an accurate\nSide, in figures\nfor each type of\npositions of the\n\nIIllXJ..ng tube are not\npicture of the pressure vari17 and 18, the series of test\noperation studied, to differprimary nozzle with respect\n\nl\n\n16\n\n~ACA\n\nTM 1410\n\nFigure 18 shows, for a lower primary generating pressure, the continue d rise of the pressure which characterizes the mixing of the two\nflow s in the mixed regime.\nTranslated by Mary L.
