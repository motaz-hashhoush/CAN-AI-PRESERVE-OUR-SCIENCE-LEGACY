The primary mission objective is to deliever an ultra-sensitive seismometer to the Martian surface for scientific investigations. The preliminary InSight PF acoustic requirement (the heritage Phoenix environment, 139.8 dB overall SPL maximum expected environment) was reduced significantly when the Launch vehicle was selected as the InSight launch vehicle (134.5 dB overall SPL maximum expected environment). This reduction would have resulted in a very low Lander Deck random vibration at SEIS, and other instruments inside the aeroshell, during the system Protoflight (PF) acoustic test with questionable workmanship value. To mitigate this concern JPL and Launch vehicle contractor agreed to increase the InSight PF acoustic test requirement to enhance workmanship testing for science instruments and assemblies inside the aeroshell. The actual InSight system acoustic test vibration responses at the SEIS instrument are compared to the predicted responses.", "title": "InSight System Acoustic Requirement Evolution", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007666, "meta": {"author": {"name": "O'Connell, Michael"}}, "id": "7dccd6ca22824b2da352904914172b9c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:13:55.7461590+00:00", "id": 20210007666, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/47508", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210007666, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017", "id": "5bdc69f5f652480ca948258617ccd1db", "publicationDate": "2017-03-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
