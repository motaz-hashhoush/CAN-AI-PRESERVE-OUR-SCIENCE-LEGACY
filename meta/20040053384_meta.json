Due to the large distances involved and the significant delay time in sending a command and receiving verification, the lander needed to operate autonomously after it separated from the orbiter. It had to sense conditions, make decisions, and act accordingly. We were flying into a relatively unknown set of conditions-a Martian atmosphere of unknown pressure, density, and consistency to land on a surface of unknown altitude, and one which had an unknown bearing strength.", "title": "End-to-End Commitment", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T17:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040053384, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Newcomb, John"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "bb38a7c12f474e4e89c3024a6e43981c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040053384, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040053384, "id": "7f2926905b4440d8a9bea47a8d83c93a", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine, No. 16", "publicationDate": "2004-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20040053380, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ASK Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040053384.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040053384/downloads/20040053384.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040053384/downloads/20040053384.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040053384/downloads/20040053384.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
