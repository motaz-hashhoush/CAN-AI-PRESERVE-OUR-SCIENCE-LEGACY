Most of the high-temperature heaters for\nthese processes use water-cooled or insulated vacuum\nchambers with radiant heating elements suspended\nin them. The heating elements are typically formed\ninto cylinders from sheets of refractory metals and\ngenerally operate at high currents and low voltages,\nuse three-phase a-c power, and require water-cooled\n\nelectrodes. In some instances the heating elements\nare arranged to provide rectangular-section heating\nzones. Wire-wound ceramic tubes are used for heating\nat lower temperatures. Problems associated with the\nhigh-temperature heaters include heat losses through\nthe electrodes and insulation, movement and buckling\nof the heating elements, inadequate water cooling,\nundesirable thermal gradients in the water-cooled\nelectrodes, and difficulties in supporting the heating\nelements and the material to be heated.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nAn\nqW\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Assumes any liabilities with respect to the use of, or for\ndamages resulting from the use of, any information, apparatus, method,\nor process disclosed in this document.\n\nThe solution: A high-temperature heater having\nspecially formed filaments, and several other features\ndescribed below, all of which reduce the severity of the\nproblems arising with conventional heaters.\nHow it's done: As shown in the illustration, the\nheater consists of an even number of shaped filaments of refractory metal, such as tantalum, tungsten,\nor molybdenum, which are supported in a cylindrical\narray by spacing members of a ceramic material at\neach end. The filaments are thin strips of the refractory metal bent to a dihedral angle for structural\nrigidity. To eliminate the need for stepdown transformers and large bus bars, the filaments are designed\nto operate with high-voltage, low-current a-c or d-c\npower. Other advantages of the heater are as follows:\n1) The filaments are supported on ceramic spacers\noutside the hot zone of the heater to minimize\nthe formation of volatile products. 2) Water cooling\nof the electrodes is not required. 3) Electrical\ninsulation is required only in the cool zones of the\nheater. 4) The filaments are electrically connected so\nthat the current in adjacent filaments flows in oppo-\n\nBrief 63-10342\n\nsite directions to cancel the magnetic flux. 5) The\nheater structure is free to expand longitudinally as a\nunit, thus avoiding the development of mechanical\nstresses during operation.\nNote:\nFor further information about this innovation\ninquiries may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nLewis Research Center\n21000 Brookpark Road\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\nReference: B63-10342\nPatent status: NASA encourages the immediate\ncommercial use of this invention.
