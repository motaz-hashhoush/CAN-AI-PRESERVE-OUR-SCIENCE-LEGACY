The rim rotates in the plane of its orbit such that the lower portion of the rim is travelling at suborbital velocity, while the upper portion is travelling at greater than orbital velocity. Ascending spacecraft or payloads arrive at the lowest portion of the rim at suborbital velocities, attach to the perimeter, and remain until they reach the highest point, where the payloads are released on a trajectory for higher orbits; descending payloads employ the reverse procedure. Electric thrusters placed on the rim maintain rim rotational speed and altitude. From the standpoint of currently known materials, the capture-ejector concept may be useful for relatively small velocity increments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820059730, "endDate": "1982-05-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Allied Weight Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "f45ed3ff4a164b11b5efd944ed15e1da", "id": "c8a2a2e229634adf81a9b435234183e4"}], "name": "Annual Conference", "location": "San Jose, CA", "id": "f45ed3ff4a164b11b5efd944ed15e1da", "startDate": "1982-05-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820059730, "id": "ae7b2e76fb6e40fbae3c7809c47f20e1", "publicationDate": "1982-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
