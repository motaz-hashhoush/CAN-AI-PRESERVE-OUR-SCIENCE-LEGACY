Coincidence\nof the sodium D 2 line (5890A) and the characteristic emission of the fluorescent dye Rhodamine\nB or Rhodamine WT are used.\nA narrowband optical filter located on the center\nof this 0.7A wide line at 5890A and thus closely\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nmatching the bandwidth and wavelength of a strong\nFraunhofer line makes the airborne measurement\nsystem practical. The use of a Fabry-Perot filter with,\na bandwidth of only 0.7A, a peak transmittance greater\nthan 60 percent, and a quartz spacer with sides\npolished flat to within 0.01 X achieves the required\nspectral resolution. A variable temperature housing\naround the filter allows it to be tuned over a small\nspectral range. This filter is immune to any temporal\nor vibration-induced spectral changes.\nThe optical unit looks down at the ground and also\nat a small solar-illuminated target located just outside the aircraft fuselage. Four separate signals,\nwhich correspond to the energy received from the\nsun and earth in two narrowband spectral intervals,\nare continuously monitored, sent to an analogue computer, and converted into a recorded signal proportional to the amount of fluorescence.\nEnergy from both sources is modulated at two\ndifferent frequencies by chopper wheels to provide\nsignal source identification for the signal processing.\nA beamsplitter combines the two modulated energy\nbeams and directs them through two solid Fabry-Perot\nfilters centered at different wavelengths (one on the\n0.7A wide D 7 line of sodium and the other at 5892A),\nthen through two condensers, and finally, to two\nphotomultiplier tubes. The outputs from the photomultipliers are demodulated and applied to a real\ntime analogue computer, which solves the appropriate equation and indicates a normalized fluorescence\nvalue directly. A normalized value is desirable since\nit is characteristic of the target only and does not\ndepend upon solar zenith angle or atmospheric conditions. Vibration induced photomultiplier noise is\navoided by use of a very rugged phototube constructed\nto operate in a missile launch environment.\n\nWith the Fraunhofer line method, the detection of\nflourescence depends upon the c5mparison of two\nratios. Since the ratios are obtained simultaneously\nand with the same photomultipliers, any change in\nphotomultiplier gain affects both ratios and leaves\nthe comparison unchanged. A small calibration lamp\nmeasures and compares the gains in each of the two\nfilter channels.\n\nis\n\nNotes:\nI.
