A brief description is given of observational problems. The basic properties of the Algol variables are satisfactorily explained by means of evolutionary models that assume considerable mass transfer between the components. It is pointed out that ultraviolet spectra obtained with the IUE satellite corroborate the view that the present subgiant secondary component was initially the more massive star and that it has been stripped of a large fraction of its mass so that the deep layers affected by CNO processing are now denuded. It is believed that the present-day 'classical' Algols must have undergone a phase of rapid mass transfer in the  past and that Beta Lyrae and the W Serpentis stars are probably closer to that stage than ordinary Algols. Around the accreting star a complex structure is formed, and an induced stellar wind may blow a large part of the transferred matter out of the system.", "title": "Interacting binary stars - Freaks or rosetta stones", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840036412, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Plavec, M.
