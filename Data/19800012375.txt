b'AEROSPACE ELECTRODE LINE\nL. Miller\nEagle Picher\n\nof\nLet me justgive you a little bit history before I go directly into my paper.\n\nour\nFor more than20 years the Eagle Picher space-battery operations have been located in\nJoplin, Missouri plant, and we have been procuring finished electrodes from our Colorado Springs\nfacility. We consider this facility to be our commercial operation or high volume operation.\nAs of now, and at least starting about the last months, we now have a new electrode facility\n6\nin operation in our Joplin plant.We believe that this facility may be the first electrode-processing\nnickel cadmium and nickel hydrogen designed, developed, and dedicated solely to the production of\nelectrodes for space-battery systems.\nThe facility offers production capacity for not only the chemical electrodes which we have\nbeen using for a great deal of time now, but also the newer electrochemical designs.\n(Figures 6- 1 5 and 6- 16)\nThese are justa couple of vugraphs.I have a couple of more to\ngive you an overview of the\nsystem. I might just comment on the production capability of the operation.\nRight now, we are not really running at full capacity. We can produce about 150 square feet\nof plaque material in an eight-hour production shift. However, the design of the equipment such\nis\nthat it is capable of handling three times this volume.\nThere are a numberof unique design features that are specifically incorporated to produce a\nhigh-quality electrode. We have made these changes based upon our experience as part of the\noperation. Also, we are indebted to the recommendations and suggestions of Jerry Halpert and\nFloyd Ford.\nLet me go through a couple of these items here.\n1 . A batch rather than a continuous operation mode was selected for better process control.\n\n2. An independent equipment module design approach was taken to assure process solution\nisolation. In other words, electrode materials are themselves transferred from process tank to\nof\nprocess tank, rather than the much easier and lower cost method pumping in different process\nsolutions into the same tank.\nThe benefits achieved here are elimination of the slow, but inevitable buildup of tank, plumbing, and solution reservoir contamination associated with partial solution mixing.\n\n487\n\n3. All equipment, even including the exhaust duct work, is constructedof stainless steel and\nall current carrying components such as buss bar and electrode process racks are constructed of p\nnickel to prevent contamination.\n\n4. Equipment design was easy and was designed for easy access to facilitate both internal and\nexternal cleaning.\n\n5. Continuous in-line process monitoring and an analytical chemical laboratory dedicated to\nthis operation assures achievement of the desired high degree of process control.\n(Figures 6- 17 and 6- 1 8)\n\n6. Each piece of 1 2 X 1 2 electrode material blank, and there is three per process rack, is\nconnected to the process rack by four redundant, fusion welded nickel tab connections to ensure\nuniform current distribution within the parallel rack assembly.\n7. In addition, each rack assembly offers an adjustable connection to the process tank buss\nbar, allowing fine tuning of current\nflow t o achieve uniform current distribution through each\nparallel rack assembly.\n\n8. During actual operation, process tank to reservoir solution recirculation provisions\npermitted the introduction of filtration and sedimentation steps to maintain ultra high solution\npurity levels.\n9. The very important, final electrode material formation step, a uniquehigh-voltage system\nwas devised featuring multiple, series-connected small formation cells,\nagain assuring uniform\ncurrent distribution.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you could see on your right over there if it were a better vugraph.\n\nI O . Each of the above formation cells is fixtured so as to permit frequent replacement of the\nelectrolyte solution which, of course, always is heavily contaminated i n this operation.\n1 1 . A special multistep cascade, deionized water washing technique followed by a vacuum dryin\nstep, produces finished electrode materials exhibiting the desired physical stability and cleanliness\ncharacteristics.\n\n12. A series step deionizing system which means we have two deionizers connected in series\nso we have pretreatment as well as final treatment to ensure a very high quality deionized water\nsource for all operations of the system.\nIn addition to the formation there, we have what we call our final electrode carbonate\ntreatment equipment. Basically, there are two systems in operation depending on the customer\xe2\x80\x99s\npreference.\n\n488\n\nOne involves a multiflushing of the finished welded cell, and the other involves a hot caustic\nto\ndip - it can be boiling caustic -just prior final cell assembly for carbonate reduction purposes.\nWith respect to the results, as I say, we have only been in operation for six months. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave long-term data, but some of the initial observations based upon our previous source of\nelectrodes - we used to only use about one-half of the electrodes that procured. The attrition\nwe\nwas either as a result of out-of-weight range plaques, o r physical defects associated with the\nelectrode materials. We now use more than 90 percent of the electrodes produced.\nOne thing that was somewhat of a surpriseto us is that generally when we built some fresh\ncells, we needed, through a series of bum-in cycles, t o develop their capacity, or at least stabilize\ntheir capacity.\nWe find now that cells built with electrodes on this new line exhibit a long-term capacity\nfrom the very first cycle.\nOne of our observationsis that the activity in the electrode appears tohave been improved t o\nthe point that we can operate a cell design to 15 t o 20 percent more electrolyte and still measure\nlower internal pressures on cycling.\nDISCUSSION\nFORD: Lee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember you commenting on making the plaques themselves. Are you\nmaking those in Joplin?\nMILLER: At this time the raw sinter is still made in our Colorado Springs facility. There are\nplans to set LIP a new operation at Joplin for that, also.\nFORD: Will you be automated with that, or are y o u going to use the old magnet technique?\nMILLER: It is rather a tough decision right now. The dry sinter\no r the individual sintering\nprocess has certain advantages; the continuous or automated slurry hasits own advantages. I would\nsay right now the preference would be to probably go to the continuous slurry process.\n\nGROSS: Lee, you indicated that it was determined that the batched process would be better\nthan the continuous process.\nOffhand, I would have guessed the other way around. Can you explain that a little bit\nfurther, please?\nMILLER: Well, the batch process just lets you step into the middle of the process and make\nmeasurements more easily than a continuous process because itwill be better control.\nGROSS: The other point was,\nI have always felt that the electrochemical impregnation\nmethod had the potential to be a completely\nclosed system, to beclosed off from the atmosphere,\nand solved once and for all the problem of carbonates getting on the plates.\n489\n\nApparently, you elected not to do that, or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, andwondered if you would explain\nI\nwhy that happened.\nMILLER: I am not sure what you mean by that, Sid. There a great deal of gas evolution\nis\nassociated with the electrochemical process, more so than the chemical process.\nGROSS: Yes, evolution. Would that mean gas would go out and you could have gas evolve\nwithout allowing atmospheric gases to get in?\nMILLER: Maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your question. What do you mean by a closed system?\nGROSS: Closed from the atmosphere, from the contamination of carbon dioxide and gas,\nwhich produces carbonates on the plates during manufacture.\nMILLER: One thing you can do with the electrochemical process though is to finish the\nimpregnation step in the acid state, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be as careful as in the chemical process\nwith respect to storage of plaques between operations.\n\n490\n\nFigure 6- 15\n\nFigure 6- 17\n\nFigure 6- 16\n\nFigure 6-18\n\n'
