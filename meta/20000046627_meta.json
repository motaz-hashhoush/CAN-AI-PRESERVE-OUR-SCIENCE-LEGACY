There is increasing competition among the main Western European airports, and smaller, regional airports are fighting for market share. New modes of transport, such as high speed rail, arc also coming into the picture and affect the mode split for medium distance transport within Europe. Developments such as these are demanding the attention of policy makers and a tool is required for their analysis. For DGCA, Hague Consulting Group has developed a model system to provide answers to the policy questions posed by these expected trends, and to identify areas where policy makers can influence the traveller choices. The development of this model system, the Integrated Airport Competition Model/Integral Luchthaven Competitive Model (ILCM), began in 1992. Since that time the sub-models, input data and user interface have been expanded, updated and improved. HCG and DGCA have transformed the ILCM from a prototype into an operational forecasting tool.", "title": "The Integrated Airport Competition Model, 1998", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T14:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000046627, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Veldhuis, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "b1ee2ebdccd0415b9b120a7f70a74289"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000046627, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Essers, I."}, "organization": {"name": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "44ec0dda26834b07b5b90a9255c3f511"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20000046627, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bakker, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Hague Consulting Group", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "a3dc91f019f3416fa4709a10302545db"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20000046627, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cohn, N."}, "organization": {"name": "Hague Consulting Group", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "6c0f511e42314712b3f9d9648959be23"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20000046627, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kroes, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Hague Consulting Group", "location": "The Hague,  Netherlands"}}, "id": "f08a5b251cd54a1e929a8662faa334a9"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000046627, "publications": [{"volume": "4", "submissionId": 20000046627, "issue": "2", "issn": "1093-8826", "publisher": "Aviation Inst., Univ. of Nebraska", "id": "7354423136694ed0af4517fad2ea2b31", "publicationName": "Journal of Air Transportation World Wide", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
