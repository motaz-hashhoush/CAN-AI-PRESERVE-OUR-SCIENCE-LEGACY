Occasionally, the license applicant or interested party may be asked to sign a non-disclosure\nagreement before NASA shares detailed technical information about an invention if that information has not been made\navailable to the public. All of these activities can be discussed\nwith the requisite license manager at the appropriate time in\nthe process.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is one of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions to ensure that the technologies it\ncreates for aeronautics and space exploration are turned into\nnew products and services that benefit the lives of ordinary\nAmericans and the U.S. economy. Through the congressionally mandated process of technology transfer, NASA maximizes the nation\xe2\x80\x99s investment in the agency\xe2\x80\x99s cutting-edge\nresearch and development. [1]\n\nVarious types of license agreements are available. Nonexclusive agreements are the most commonly sought commercial\nlicenses. Nonexclusive licenses can be granted to more than\none company. An exclusive or partially exclusive commercial license gives a company exclusive or a limited exclusive\naccess to NASA inventions. Exclusivity may be limited to a\nspecific market application, field of use, or geographic region,\nor to a fixed period of time (e.g., five years), after which the\nagreement converts to a nonexclusive license. An evaluation\nlicense allows a company to internally evaluate inventions for\na short period.\n\n2. Patent Licensing\nPatent licensing is a primary component of technology transfer at NASA. NASA-developed technologies can serve as the\nfoundations of new commercial products, fuel the growth of an\nentire product line, or even be used to launch a new company.\n\nNASA has recently streamlined its licensing process and\nbroadened the scope of the program. Because of these changes\nand others, executed license agreements have increased dramatically. Some of these improvements are described below.\n\nThe agency\xe2\x80\x99s patent portfolio, which can be found at technology.nasa.gov, includes more than 1,400 active patents. The\n\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright\n\n1\n\nIn interview style, ATLAS gathers all required information\nfrom perspective licensees on their company, their goals, and\ntheir projected target market(s). It eliminates any guessing.\nEmail notifications keep all parties apprised of application\nstatus and any required actions.\n\nAeronautics\n\nEnvironment\n\nCommunications\n\nElectrical/\nElectronics\n\nATLAS standardizes the patent license application procedure\nacross all 10 NASA centers and eliminates most manual processing. Potential license agreements are routed electronically\nand automatically for the appropriate approvals and signatures.\n\nHealth, Medicine,\nCalling and Software\nAll IT\nand Biotechnology\n\nHigh Tech\nEntrepreneurs!\n\nStartup NASA Put\n\nInstrumentation\n\nManufacturing\n\nNASA technologies\nto work for you with\nBy offering a license with no up-front costs, the Startup NASA\ninitiative helpsStartup NASA!biggest challenges faced by\naddress two of the\n\nMaterials and\nCoatings\n\nnew companies: raising capital and security intellectual property rights. NASA innovators and facilities can be available to\nlend additional support.\n\nMechanical and\nFluid Systems\n\nOptics\n\nPower Generation\nand Storage\n\nPropulsion\n\nRobotics, Automation\nand Control\n\nCertain rules do apply:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t This offer is open only to companies formed with the express intent of commercializing a licensed NASA technology.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t NASA waives the initial licensing fees, and there are no\nminimum fees for the first three years.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Once the company starts selling a product, NASA will collect a standard net royalty fee. This money goes first to the\ninventor and then to maintaining the agency\xe2\x80\x99s technology\ntransfer activities and technology advancement.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t This initiative applies only to non-exclusive licenses, which\nmeans other companies may apply for similar rights to use\nthe technology for commercial purposes. However, NASA\nwill consider further exclusivity if the startup wishes to negotiate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Companies entering into these licenses are bound by all requirements in federal licensing statutes and NASA policies,\nincluding development of a commercialization plan and reporting on efforts to achieve practical application.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t While NASA does license to foreign entities, this startup\nagreement is only available to companies in the United\nStates.\n\nSensors\n\nNASA patent offerings cover a wide variety\nof technical applications.\nAutomated Technology Licensing Application System (ATLAS)\nLicensing NASA patents is not new, but the license application process for a NASA patent is. Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s new and\nbetter. ATLAS provides perspective licensees a centralized\nonline tool for applying for any available NASA innovation,\nagency-wide.\n\nPatent Gift\nTo stimulate the innovation economy, NASA has put a portion\nof its patent portfolio in the public domain. These technologies\ndo not require a license agreement, and anyone may freely\npursue independent product development immediately without the need to contact NASA in any way.\n\nAutomated Technology Licensing Application System\n\n2\n\nThe High-Strength, Wear-Resistant Aluminum Alloy:\nA Patent License Success Story\nThe High-Strength, Wear-Resistant Aluminum Alloy is an\nexcellent example of a NASA patent success story. The agency began work on the innovation (also known as MSFC-398)\nas a result of the Partnership for Next-Generation Vehicles\n(PNGV), a collaborative effort through which 20 federal laboratories and more than 350 universities, small businesses, and\nsuppliers worked together to develop technologies to improve\nfuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\nWhen PNGV funding ended, NASA continued to fine-tune\nthe alloy. Today\xe2\x80\x99s MSFC-398 offers the higher strength at high\ntemperatures that has led to it being an integral component of\nvery successful commercial products that are having a positive impact on the environment and helping to save lives.\nDelivering higher wear resistance, higher surface hardness,\nand greater stability at elevated temperatures compared to\nother aluminum alloys, the technology can be produced at less\nthan a $1 per pound. It is enabling manufacturers to make optimized, lighter weight engines that produce more horsepower\nand emit fewer pollutants.\nUtilizing the NASA innovation for outboard marine engine\napplications, Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) first\nintroduced pistons fabricated with MSFC-398 in 2003 in its\nEvinrude E-TEC\xe2\x84\xa2 engines. The E-TEC\xe2\x84\xa2 line offers a novel design that combines features that have never been offered\ntogether in a single engine: it meets three-star emissions requirements for the California Air Resources Board, operates\nwith no scheduled dealer maintenance for three years, and\nuses approximately 20% less oil than conventional direct-injection engines. The E-TEC\xe2\x84\xa2 has been given the highest\npossible customer satisfaction rating in a study by J.D. Power\nand Associates and has also won a first-place Environmental\nExcellence in Transportation Award by the Society of Automotive Engineering. So impressed with MSFC-398\xe2\x80\x99s performance, BRP now uses the technology in every line of its\nEvinrude engines.\n\nLicensing agreements for the MSFC-398 aluminum alloy\nexemplify the impact of successful technology transfer.\n\nAnother license of MSFC-398 executed with Twin City Fan is\nallowing the innovation to be utilized to develop much needed\nroad/rail tunnel safety fans. New standards dictate that these\nfans be able to operate at 752 \xcb\x9aF for two hours in order to be\ncertified for use. The reason for the high temperature requirement is because the fans must be able to operate successfully\nduring a fire or other emergency situation.\n\nThe other option was to make the fan blades out of steel, but\nthis would have required a specialized motor to turn the fan\nblades since steel weighs three times more than aluminum.\nThe NASA technology continues to amass a variety of accolades. It has been honored with both Southeast and National Excellence in Technology Transfer Awards by the Federal\nLaboratory Consortium.\n\nBefore selecting the NASA alloy, Twin City had only two ways\nto meet the new regulations that have been set. Option one\nwas to use another aluminum alloy; the resulting fan would\nhave been much larger. The drawback here is that a bigger fan\nwould require more space, and even taking a single foot out\nof the construction of a tunnel means a dramatic cost savings.\n\n3\n\n3. Software Release\nThe release of NASA software to the public is another key\nmechanism of technology transfer at NASA. These are the actual codes NASA engineers have developed to do their work.\nEach code is available at no cost.\n\nBusiness Systems and Project\nManagement\n\nSoftware has always been at the core of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission successes, and NASA makes a concerted effort to always track and\nutilize its software tools to their full potential. A code developed\nfor a specific need may have application to a variety of other\nNASA projects or programs, or it might be of interest to the Department of Defense, other government agencies, commercial\nspace companies, private industry, or the general public.\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\nEarth \xe2\x80\xa2 Air \xe2\x80\xa2 Space \xe2\x80\xa2 Exoplanet\n\nData Servers Processing\nand Handling\n\nAll software developed at NASA that is made available to others goes through an official software release process, which is\nled by the Software Release Authority (SRA) at each center.\nBefore it can be released, all software undergoes an export\ncontrol review, an intellectual property review, and a commercialization assessment to determine if it meets NASA\xe2\x80\x99s policies and guidelines.\n\nDesign and Integration\nTools\n\nMaterials and Processes\n\nCrew and Life Support\n\nThe NASA Software Catalog and Other Recent Developments\n\nSystem Testing\n\nIn the last 6 years, NASA has re-energized its efforts in the\narea of software release. The collection and compilation of\nhundreds of software codes from all ten NASA centers to\nbuild a comprehensive software catalog and repository can be\nconsidered an excellent example of this.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nPropulsion\n\nVehicle Management\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nSpace \xe2\x80\xa2 Air \xe2\x80\xa2 Ground\n\nNASA\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nElectronics and Electrical Power\n\nData and Image\nProcessing\nOperations\n\n2017\xe2\x80\x932018\nCATALOG\n\nAeronautics\nStructures and Mechanisms\nNASA software offerings cover a wide variety\nof technical applications.\n\nThe NASA Software Catalog includes many of the tools\nthe agency uses to explore space and broaden humankind\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the universe.\n\n4\n\n4. Spinoffs\n\nThe NASA Software Catalog consolidates the agency\xe2\x80\x99s best\nsolutions to a wide array of complex problems. When it was\ninitially released in 2014, it became the first tool of its kind\nfrom a federal agency. At the time, more than 50 media outlets highlighted it and its importance, including NPR, Gizmodo, and Newsweek. The White House Office of Science\nand Technology Policy hailed the publication as a very worthy\naccomplishment. The fourth edition of the catalog is currently\nin the works.\n\nThere is probably more \xe2\x80\x9cspace\xe2\x80\x9d in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s life than he\nimagines. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Spinoff magazine is an annual publication\nthat has been written and released for each of the last 40 years.\nIts pages have showcased more than 2,000 products, tools,\nprocesses, and improvements with their origins in America\xe2\x80\x99s\nspace program that have found new life outside of NASA. Examples of technologies featured in the 2017 edition of Spinoff\nare profiled below.\n\nFor the 2017 version of the catalog, NASA launched an extensive social media campaign, utilizing the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter,\nFacebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and other\naccounts to reach millions of potential users. As a result, the\nnumber of Software Usage Agreements has increased dramatically, almost doubling between FY16 and FY17. The campaign resulted in the creation of 22,551 new user accounts,\n207,628 catalog downloads, and 161,202 YouTube views.\nIn October of 2016, NASA introduced a new online Software\nRelease System (SRS). The SRS provides developers with a\nsingle platform to ready their software for release to the users\nwho need it; employs a simple online questionnaire to replace\nmultiple forms used previously; and allows software packages\nto be reviewed concurrently by all necessary reviewers.\n\nCrash Test Cameras\nUnder a NASA contract, Integrated Design Technologies developed a rugged, compact, high-speed video camera with\nultra-fast solid-state memory to record parachute deployment\nduring a test flight of the Orion spacecraft. The camera captured 1,000 frames per second, backing up 12 gigabits of data\nper second as it filmed. Today, a commercialized version of\nthe technology is being used in automobile crash-testing and\nin filming slow-motion sequences for television.

John Deere\nacquired the technology and used it to develop the world\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst widely used self-driving farm equipment. Currently, as\nmuch as 70 percent of farmland in North America, 50 percent\nin Europe and South America, and 90 percent in Australia is\ncultivated by self-driving tractors, many of which still rely on\ntechnology originally developed at NASA. [3]\n\nSensor correction technology lets tractors\ndrive themselves.\n\nRocket technology counteracts vibrations.\n\nFluid Damper Technology\n\nPhase-Change Materials (PCMs)\n\nDuring its test launch, the Ares-1X test rocket experienced\nunexpected resonant vibrations that could have harmed future\nastronaut crews. To solve the problem, NASA engineers invented a new kind of dampening device that uses the weight\nof a liquid mass (e.g., rocket fuel) to counteract resonance. The\ninnovation has significant potential for broad application in\nany skyscraper, bridge, stadium, or other structure prone to\nvibration. Its first commercial use came in the B2 Building,\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s largest modular building, which is situated next to\nBarclay\xe2\x80\x99s Center in Brooklyn, New York. [4]\n\nOne method Johnson Space Center investigated for managing\nheat inside a spacesuit was the use of phase-change materials.\nLike ice cubes in a drink, PCMs absorb heat as they change\nfrom solid to liquid, and, if exposed to colder temperatures,\nthey release that heat as they refreeze. An SBIR contract led\nto the creation of fabrics incorporating PCMs, most recently\ncommercialized by San Francisco-based Embrace Innovations in wraps and blankets that help keep babies at an optimal\ntemperature. [6]\n\nMini Heat Pipes\nOver the course of more that 40 Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) contracts since the 1980s, many with Glenn\nResearch Center, NASA has helped Pennsylvania-based\nThermacore advance the technology of heat pipes, a tool used\nto move heat so it can dissipate safely. In the last decade, the\nNASA-improved heat pipes have been adapted to medical\nuses, including bipolar forceps utilized in brain surgery. [5]\n\nTemperature-regulating fabrics help keep babies\ncomfortable.\n6\n\n5. Summary\n\nPhone Camera Sensors\nIn the 1990s, Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer Eric Fossum invented what would become NASA\xe2\x80\x99s most ubiquitous\nspinoff\xe2\x80\x94digital image sensors based on complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS). These were significantly\nsmaller and more efficient than the charge-coupled-device imagers of the day and enabled tiny, battery-friendly cell phone\ncameras and high-definition video cameras, such as those offered by GoPro, a San Mateo, California-based company. [7]\n\nInnovation is NASA\xe2\x80\x99s specialty, and through the patent licensing program and software release, an average American can\nbenefit directly from the creativity and expertise of thousands\nof civil service and contractor scientists and engineers. Advances with their origins in the space program save and improve lives, create jobs, and maximize taxpayer investment in\nthe agency.\n\nReferences\n[1] Partial listing of external and internal regulations governing\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s technology transfer responsibilities:\nStevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980,\n15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3710 et seq., as amended\nBayh-Dole Act (P.L. 96-517), 35 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 200 et seq., as\namended\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act 51 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 20113(a).\nCommercial Technology Transfer Program 51 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 50116.\nRights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations\nand Small Business Firms Under Government Grants,\nContracts, and Cooperative Agreements, 37 CFR Part 401.\n\nNASA-based semiconductor sensors enable phone\ncameras.\nHearing Aid batteries\n\nLicensing of Government-Owned Inventions, 37 CFR Part 404.\n\nIn its early days, NASA spent much effort developing rechargeable silver-zinc batteries, as the pairing of silver and\nzinc offers a higher power-to-weight ratio than any other coupling.
