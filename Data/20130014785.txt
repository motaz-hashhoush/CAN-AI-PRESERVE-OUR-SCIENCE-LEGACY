Introduction\nNASA\xca\xbcs acquisition of the two complete 2.4m aperture telescopes from the National\nReconnaissance Organization (NRO) of the US Department of Defense is a\nsignificant and unexpected opportunity for the US scientific community. These are\nHubble-sized telescopes that are judged suitable for astronomical science,\ntelescopes which are in particular capable of delivering a field much larger than\nHubble\'s, with optical systems that appear to be compatible with a large-area nearinfrared camera. Some basic questions arise from this opportunity. Is an NRO\ntelescope well suited to accomplish the science of the WFIRST, the top priority\nspace initiative in the 2010 Astrophysics Decadal Survey New Worlds, New\nHorizons (NWNH \xe2\x80\x94 http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BPA/BPA_048094)? How\ndoes the larger aperture of an NRO telescope improve or limit the science program\ndeveloped by the WFIRST Science Definition Team (SDT) or their Design\nReference Mission 1 (DRM1), which is the descendant of the notional WFIRST\ntelescope. Would the larger aperture allow for, and enable, additional science not\nincluded in the WFIRST program but high priority in NWNH, thus extending the key\nidea of WFIRST to cover the broadest possible program of high-priority science?\nFinally, would the availability of a nearly-completed 2.4m telescope improve or\nharm the chance of accomplishing the WFIRST mission in terms of cost and\nschedule?\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide preliminary answers to these and derivative\nquestions. In particular, we attempt to evaluate the answers in the context of an\nNRO telescope without any significant alternations \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cas is.\xe2\x80\x9d With very limited\nresources and time, the answers will range from simple matters that can be easily\nassessed to complicated issues that will require months of study by teams of\nscientists and engineers. Our work here is to make a start to this process that will\nprovide some justification for a much more detailed study. The goal of this white\npaper has been to provide information and talking points for the September, 2012\nPrinceton NEW Telescope Meeting and also as input to the new Science Definition\nTeam assembled by NASA to \xe2\x80\x9cassess the possible scientific use of one set of the\nex-NRO telescope assets for advancing the science priorities of the 2010\nAstrophysics Decadal Survey.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xca\xbbNEW\xca\xbc acronym stands for \xe2\x80\x9cNew Worlds New\nHorizons Enabling Wide Field,\xe2\x80\x9d so for the purposes of this paper we will call an\nNRO telescope configured to carry out the WFIRST program NEW WFIRST.\n\n1.1 Context\nNWNH was a multi-year effort involving many hundreds of astronomers and\nastrophysicists who prioritized the most compelling scientific opportunities in the\n2011-2020 decade. The Survey considered a long and diverse list of potential\nprograms and faced the usual challenge of matching a few of the best to the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n2\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nfunding levels anticipated over this decade. Arguably, this Survey had both more\ncompelling science programs and fewer potential resources than any previous\nastronomy survey.\nIn the field of space astronomy, this dilemma was exacerbated by the significant\nchallenge of bringing the James Webb Space Telescope, the top priority of the\nprevious survey, to a successful launch and operational phase; it was known from\nearly in the Survey that most of the funding NASA would have applied to new\nmissions in the 2011-2020 decade was already committed to finishing the Webb\ntelescope. This meant that few of many excellent missions \xe2\x80\x94 and none of the\nmost exciting \xe2\x80\x9cflagships\'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 could be accommodated within the projected budget.\nNWNH responded to this dilemma with a financially modest, but scientifically\ncompelling, program for space: increase the frequency of the less-costly Explorer\nmissions, and build a \xe2\x80\x9cjunior flagship\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a 1.5m telescope capable of wide-fieldimaging and spectroscopy, named WFIRST, that was an amalgamation of several\ndiverse projects that shared common hardware. By combining two core programs\n\xe2\x80\x94 (1) dark energy surveys, and (2) microlensing planet finding \xe2\x80\x94 with other broadpurpose astrophysics surveys and a program of guest-investigator science,\nWFIRST was intended to accomplish as much of the high priority science as\npossible within the tightly constrained projected budget.\nNWNH envisioned WFIRST as a flagship mission with broad scientific reach, and\ncertainly very different than a dedicated \xe2\x80\x9cDark Energy Probe.\xe2\x80\x9d Like LSST, the top\nlarge ground-based NWNH priority, WFIRST is capable of producing outstanding\nscience across a wide swath of astronomy. However, WFIRST is not a flagship\nmission in the JWST sense. WFIRST is a much smaller scale mission that does not\nrequire the development of novel technologies \xe2\x80\x94 as JWST has. WFIRST should be\nin comparison to JWST simple to manage and not susceptible to a large\npercentage cost growth.\nSoon after the release of the NWNH Survey Report, the cost of completing JWST\nconstruction was determined to be even larger than in the projected numbers. In\naddition, the Administration made less money available to Astrophysics (by\napproximately $1.3B over five years) than had been assumed in formulating the\nNWNH plan. The accomplishment of any of the NWNH goals for space science has\nbeen put in doubt. However, there are positive developments since the Survey that\nraise hope. (1) The planned cadence of the Explorer program has been increased.\n(2) Participation by US astronomers in European Space Agency\xca\xbcs Euclid mission\nhas been secured, in this way providing some participation in the dark energy\nresearch that ranked very highly in the Survey. (3) NASA constituted a WFIRST\nScience Definition Team to study, to evolve, and to validate the cost of, the\nproposed program. The SDT refined and improved the WFIRST design and\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n3\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nconfirmed the cost of the improved version within that derived in the NWNH \xe2\x80\x9dCATE\xe2\x80\x9d\n(cost-and-technology-estimate).\n\n1.2 Why WFIRST?\nThe unexpected availability of an essentially complete telescope is a new wrinkle in\nthe process NASA has employed to underwrite decadal reviews of astronomy and\nastrophysics. These reviews inform the process of formulating and carrying out\nmissions that pursue the scientific priorities of the scientific community. There are,\nof course, many channels by which the community communicates its scientific\naspirations to NASA, including other advisory committees and responses to\nNASA\'s own process of selection through competitive proposals, but the National\nResearch Council\'s Decadal Survey activity is the only one that involves the entire\nastronomy/astrophysics community. This essential feature, combined with the\ntime, depth, and rigor applied in Decadal Surveys, is why they have a unique\nweight, and why NASA treats them as a roadmap of scientific aspirations to be\nfolded in with other budgetary and programmatic considerations. For this reason, it\nwould indeed be fortunate if an NRO telescope were to be well suited to carry out\nthe WFIRST mission \xe2\x80\x94 the top priority of the most recent Survey.\nConversely, an implementation path other than using an NRO telescope to\naccomplish the NWNH\xca\xbcs top priority, whether judged by the CAA, a mid-decadal\nreview, the next Decadal survey, or other deliberative process, would face complex\nquestions and Hobson\'s choices that are likely to divide the community and\npotentially derail the Decadal process altogether. Another issue is essentially the\n\xe2\x80\x9cshelf life\xe2\x80\x9d of the NRO telescopes, a time beyond which components, systems, and\ntechnical expertise cannot be supported. For these reasons, we believe that the\napplication of an NRO telescope to the WFIRST mission is the only attractive\noption at this time. However, because a forced fit is worse than any other option,\nthe suitability of an NRO telescope for WFIRST science is the key issue that must\nbe settled before any decision about the next step for NASA astrophysics after the\nlaunch of JWST can be taken.\n\n1.3 The Landscape of Astronomical Research in 2020\nLooking across the future landscape of current and future major facilities for\nastrophysics now anticipated in a post NWNH world, it is instructive to see how a\nNEW WFIRST would fit into the program (see Figure 1).\nFor general astrophysics, NEW WFIRST can play an essential role in\ncomplementing future ground-based 20m \xe2\x80\x94 40m telescopes. For example, as\nTable 1 shows, based on the performance of HST + WFC3, a 2.4m space\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n4\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\ntelescope equipped with forefront IR detectors can achieve broad-band pointsource sensitivity of ground-based \xca\xbbExtremely Large Telescopes\xca\xbc (ELTs), thus\nallowing these 20m \xe2\x80\x93 40m telescopes to devote more of their valuable resources to\ntheir unique capabilities in multi-object spectroscopy in the optical and nearinfrared.\nAs was articulated in NWNH, WFIRST was to be much more than a Dark Energy\nmission or an exoplanet mission. Indeed, these exciting core programs were only a\n\xe2\x80\x9cnose cone\xe2\x80\x9d of the WFIRST mission, leading the way for a diverse and powerful\nprogram of astrophysical research. With an unprecedentedly large field and high\nsensitivity for near-IR observations, a WFIRST mission enables forefront\nastrophysics, in the context of current, future ground and space missions. For this\nprimary goal, NEW WFIRST could do even more. Furthermore, NEW WFIRST\ncould also serve as a bridge to ambitious future exoplanet missions, such as the\npotentially \xe2\x80\x9clife-finding\xe2\x80\x9d TPF-C \xe2\x80\x94 a fantastic opportunity all by itself, one very highly\nregarded in NWNH.\n\nFigure 1: Mission timelines for facilities especially relevant to NEW WFIRST.\n\nIf launched soon after JWST, NEW WFIRST would significantly enhance the\nscience return from JWST. With an imaging field of view at least 100 times the\narea of JWST\xca\xbcs NIRCam, NEW WFIRST will discover numerous gravitationallylensed galaxies, high redshift quasars, and other rare objects that will be superb\ntargets for JWST follow-up. If operating concurrently with JWST, WFIRST will\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n5\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nrelieve JWST from some very expensive survey work that will be required its\nmaturing mission to discover and study the first stars and galaxies, by performing\nsurveys over far wider areas than JWST could ever accomplish. NEW WFIRST\nsurveys could provide any number of valuable source catalogs, not only for JWST,\nbut also for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and future ELTs. In\naddition, such a space-based survey capability would provide a highly stable,\ninfrared complement to NWNH\xca\xbcs top priority ground-based initiative, the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).\nTable 1: Point-source Sensitivity\n\nThe burgeoning field of exoplanets, a high priority of NWNH for which no major\nprogram could be afforded, could be invigorated by NEW WFIRST. The increased\nlight grasp and angular resolution of a 2.4m mirror would considerably strengthen\nthe microlensing planet search compared to the original WFIRST mission (see\nFigure 2), as we detail in Section 5.3. More intriguingly, the combination of\nexcellent on-axis performance and the large collecting area of the 2.4m NRO\ntelescope would enable a coronagraphic imager that could answer crucial\nquestions about proto-planetary disks and explore for the first time the habitable\nzones of about 30 nearby GFK stars. As described below, this would directly\naddress one of the key exoplanet goals of NWHH not possible with the original\nWFIRST concept \xe2\x80\x94 direct imaging of exoplanets. This would as well complement\nnew ground-based planet-imaging systems being readied for deployment on\nexisting 8m \xe2\x80\x93 10m telescopes to search for young planets several AU from the\nparent star. A coronagraphic imager on NEW WFIRST would importantly provide\nan essential technology pathfinder for future large space telescopes that can\nsearch for and characterize Earth-like worlds, including the search for life.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n6\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 2: The improved micro-lensing performance of a 2.4m NRO telescope\n(right) compared to SDT WFIRST (DRM1, left). The images compare an\n\xe2\x80\x9cequal-duration, equal-area\xe2\x80\x9d survey of a Galactic Bulge field.\n\n2. The NRO Telescopes \xe2\x80\x93 a Basic Description\nNRO transferred ownership of two telescopes to NASA. The delivery includes 2\ntelescopes, each with the primary and secondary mirrors of a 3-mirror anastigmat\ndesign, associated support structures, outer thermal baffles, and various spares. A\nschematic of a telescope system that is similar to the delivered telescopes is shown\nin Figure 3. The outer thermal baffle (not shown) mounts to a separate interface\nand encloses the telescope assembly. The open volume \xe2\x80\x94 behind the primary\nmirror support structure to the base the spacecraft struts \xe2\x80\x94 can be used for\ninstruments and supporting electronics.\nThe two-mirror telescope system has a 2.4m aperture and is F/8. The system\xca\xbcs\ntotal wavefront error is less than 60 nm for a near-axis field point, supporting\ndiffraction-limited imaging above about 840 nm. The telescope is designed to\noperate at room temperature, and the telescope structures use composites with low\ncoefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) and invar materials.\nThe primary is made of ULE and has been lightweighted using an Exelis\ntechnology. The system mass is approximately 1200 kg, including the Outer Baffle\nAssembly (OBA); this is much less massive than the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). The secondary mirror (without any baffle) obscures less than 20% of the\nprimary aperture. The secondary mirror is actuated.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n7\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 3: A schematic of one of the delivered telescope assemblies.\n\nMore information about the telescope, for example, the wavelength range and\nmirror coating material, and the operating temperature, will be shared as it\nbecomes available.\n\n2.1 Using the NRO telescope \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn this white paper we investigate the application of an NRO telescope \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d to the\nWFIRST mission. Here \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d means no refiguring of the primary or secondary\nmirror, no mechanical modifications to the telescope structure, including mirror\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n8\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\ncells, actuators, thermal heaters and sensors, etc. At the Princeton Workshop we\nheard about the probable need to extend the OBA in order to provide a better light\nbaffle for the telescope, and of course, there is no spacecraft supplied, so some\nmodifications of structure might be necessary to accommodate its design. We\nimagine such modifications to have a very low-risk and, hence, they would not\nviolate the \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d principle.\nThe question of operating temperature, which will impact the scientific programs to\nbe undertaken with NEW WFIRST, is more complicated, because the \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d\noperating temperature is unknown. An upper bound is the demonstrated\ntemperature of 293K where, assuming detectors cooled to 100K, the performance\nof NEW WFIRST in photometric bands Y, J, H is essentially uncompromised at a\ndepth of \xe2\x89\x8826 AB (5\xcf\x83 point source detection) in an exposure of \xe2\x89\x88 800 s. This is\nabout 2.5 times faster to the same depth as the Design Reference Mission 1\n(DRM1) concept developed by the WFIRST SDT, discussed in Section 3. In\ncontrast, Ks (long-wavelength cutoff TBD) observations to equivalent depth would\nbe prohibitively long, due to the higher thermal background of a \xe2\x80\x9croom temperature\xe2\x80\x9d\ntelescope. However, even in this case, with a limiting magnitude of Ks \xe2\x89\x88 24.6 AB in\nan 800 s exposure, the high image quality and wide field would make NEW\nWFIRST uniquely capable for an enormous range of science programs requiring Ks\nobservations.\t\r \xc2\xa0\nPerformance in Ks would improve rapidly as the operating temperature is reduced\nfrom 293K: if lowered to the designed \xca\xbbsurvival temperature\xca\xbc of the NRO telescope\nof 250K, the performance of NEW WFIRST would match the high sensitivity of the\nSDT DRM1, Ks \xe2\x89\x88 26 AB in an exposure of \xe2\x89\x88 2400 s, a time comparable to the\nDRM1 concept. However, it is not clear whether an NRO telescope could be\noperated at 250K without substantial compromise in optical performance or\neven increased risk to the overall system. For example, the degradation of the\nwavefront from stresses induced in the ULE primary mirror at colder temperatures\nis unknown. Further modeling could be done to determine the temperature at which\nsuch degradation would become unacceptable.1 An example of increasing risk\ncould be the integrity of adhesive bonds. Such factors will set a lower limit \xe2\x80\x94 as\nyet undetermined \xe2\x80\x94 for the \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d operating temperature.\nIn summary, at this time we know only that the \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d operating temperature of\nNEW WFIRST begins at 293K and extends to some undetermined lower\ntemperature. If the science case for reaching DRM1-or-better sensitivity in Ks is\njudged to be compelling, it will become important, during this next year, to take the\nsimplest, first steps to learn whether the NRO telescope could be operated colder\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\n1We\n\nnote that such degradation in image quality could be negligible at a wavelength \xce\xbb \xe2\x89\x88\n2\xc2\xb5m, where the NEW WFIRST PSF would be sampled, even if the NRO specification for\ndiffraction-limited performance in the visible had been seriously compromised.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n9\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nthan 293K \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cas is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n3. The WFIRST Mission: Decadal Concept and SDT Evolution\n3.1 The New Worlds, New Horizons concept for WFIRST\nThe Electromagnetic Observations from Space (EOS) panel of NWNH recognized\nthat several of the more-than-fifty proposed \xca\xbbactivities\xca\xbc employed similar hardware,\nbasically a space telescope of approximately 1.5m aperture with a field covering a\ngood-fraction-of-a-degree, sampled by hundreds of millions of detector pixels\nsensitive to near-IR wavelengths. The EOS proposed, and the Decadal Survey\nCommittee accepted, the idea of combining these activities to take advantage of\nthis commonality, that is, to conduct a broad program of survey and targeted\nscience with such a telescope. The result was WFIRST.\nIt is important to emphasize that it is the wide-field camera + detectors, and not the\naperture size, that defines the WFIRST hardware. In particular, for the proposed\nactivities of dark energy surveys, microlensing planet finding, and other nearinfrared-sky surveys, the choice of a 1.5m aperture reflected the fact that these\nscience goals could be achieved with a Kepler-sized telescope, a highly desirable\nfeature in a constrained budget environment. However, all of these programs, and\nespecially guest-investigator programs of targeted science, judged by NWNH as\nthe essential component of the WFIRST mission, would benefit from a largeraperture telescope. The defining feature of the WFIRST mission is a wide-field,\nnear-IR camera, sampled at near the diffraction limit, as the scientific as well as\nliteral focus of the optical system. The choice of 1.5m \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required for\nthese science programs \xe2\x80\x94 made sense in the context of NWNH because the\nconstruction of a more-capable, larger-aperture telescope would undoubtedly carry\na much greater cost \xe2\x80\x94 a non-starter in the present budget climate. However, the\navailability \xe2\x80\x94 without cost to NASA \xe2\x80\x94 of a nearly-completed 2.4m telescope to\ncarry out the same science programs (and likely more) could conceivably balance\nthe augmented cost of other systems \xe2\x80\x94 for example, the larger spacecraft and the\nbigger camera \xe2\x80\x93 required for the larger telescope. If properly managed, this could\nresult in a total investment in NEW WFIRST no larger than the $1.6B planned for\nthe WFIRST in NWNH.\n\n3.2 Evolution of the WFIRST concept\nThe WFIRST Science Definition Team (SDT) assembled by NASA, working with\nthe Project team at GSFC and JPL, has submitted a report of its two-year-long\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n10\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nstudy to better define the WFIRST mission and its hardware, and in particular to\nlook for improvements, simplifications, and cost-and-schedule savings. The SDT\nmembership and reports can be found at http://arXiv.org/pdf/1208.4012.pdf . This\nstudy was required to put to the test the notion in the EOS Panel Report that\nseveral science missions could be combined and carried out successfully. The\nJDEM-Omega space telescope was chosen as representative hardware to obtain a\nfirst-cut, reliable costing for WFIRST, a NWNH requirement for all of its\nrecommended programs. However, this left an important opportunity for the SDT\nand WFIRST Project (GSFC) to explore the parameters of the hardware to see if, in\ngreater detail and with greater certainty, these diverse scientific missions could all\nbe supported with the common hardware, and how that hardware could be\noptimized for the task.\n\n3.3 Comparing the SDT\xca\xbcs DRM1 and DRM2\nTwo mission concepts, so-called Design Reference Missions (DRM), were\nconsidered by the SDT and Project. DRM1 is close in scale to JDEM-Omega, but\nincluded several innovations to improve performance. The intent was to meet all\nWFIRST objectives of the Decadal Survey. These include: (1) measurements of\nthe acceleration of the expansion of the universe using the techniques of\nsupernova Ia standard candles, weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations; (2)\na census of exoplanets using the microlensing technique; and (3) near-IR surveys\nand targeted observations for the astronomical community. DRM2 is a smaller\nobservatory designed to be less expensive, fitting approximately into the NASA\n$1B Probe class of missions. It has the capability to perform all observations\nrequired of WFIRST, but only in an extended mission lifetime.\nDRM1 incorporates a 205K, 1.3m, unobstructed, three-mirror anastigmat\ntelescope. It utilizes current-technology infrared H2RG sensors operating in the \xce\xbb =\n0.7\xe2\x80\x932.4\xc2\xb5m range, and fits within the fairing of a medium-lift-class launch vehicle. It\nhas a single instrument with 36 H2RG detectors and has a field of view of 0.375\ndeg2. There are two filter wheels in the beam with 6 filters, an R=75 grism for\nsupernova spectroscopy, and an R = 600 prism for the galaxy redshift survey.\nDRM1 assumes that WFIRST will be deployed in an Earth-Sun L2 libration point\norbit and have a minimum operational lifetime of 5 years. However, DRM1 will have\nno design elements (e.g., propellant supply) that intrinsically limit the lifetime to\nfewer than 10 years.\nDRM1 changes relative to JDEM-Omega are as follows:\n1) The telescope has an unobstructed design with the secondary mirror off-axis\nwith respect to the primary mirror. This provides greater effective area for an\nequal-sized telescope, stiffer support of the secondary, and a cleaner point spread\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n11\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nfunction due to the unobscured beam. The 1.3m DRM1 has nearly the same\ncollecting area as the 1.5m obstructed JDEM-Omega, which had an unusually\nlarge central obscuration. Unobstructed telescopes of size similar to WFIRST have\nbeen flown in space and now have adequate technological heritage to be\nincorporated in the design.\n2) The red wavelength cutoff of the observatory was increased from 2.0 to 2.4\xc2\xb5m.\nThis gives unique wavelength coverage compared to Euclid\xca\xbcs stated redwavelength cutoff of 2.0\xc2\xb5m. Extending the operating wavelength increases the\nredshift limit of galaxy surveys to z \xe2\x89\x88 2.7 (using the H\xce\xb1 656nm line), enabling in\nparticular a better sampling of the history of the acceleration of the expansion of the\nuniverse and more complete coverage of the history of star formation in galaxies.\n3) The detectors comprise a single instrument channel in the focal plane, compared\nwith the three instrument channels in JDEM-Omega. For JDEM-Omega, two\nseparate spectroscopy channels were incorporated for simultaneous imaging and\nspectroscopy surveys. For DRM1, all detectors are used in a single imaging\nchannel, but with removable grisms on dedicated grism wheels for spectroscopy.\nThis gives more flexibility in tailoring the observing program.\nDRM2 was requested by NASA in response to the ESA\xca\xbcs selection of the Euclid\ndark energy mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. DRM2 was designed\nto be non-duplicative with the capabilities of the Euclid mission and/or planned\nground-based facilities such as LSST, and also to represent a lower cost\nalternative to DRM1, though likely with a reduced science return compared to\nDRM1. A recent committee of the National Research Council examined the\npotential overlap in the WFIRST and Euclid missions and found that there was\nlimited duplication in their science capabilities (\xe2\x80\x9cAssessment of a Plan for U.S.\nParticipation in Euclid\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13357 ).\nHowever, to reduce mission costs, DRM2 employs a 1.1m telescope (also a threemirror anastigmat), utilizes a smaller number (14) of higher performance H4RG-10\ninfrared sensors operating from 0.7\xe2\x80\x932.4\xce\xbcm, uses an observatory design with only\nselective redundancy, and fits within a lower-cost, lower-throw-weight launch\nvehicle.\nThe field of view is 0.56 deg2, larger than DRM1 due to the larger number of pixels\nwith the H4RGs (240 megapixels for DRM2 compared to 144 megapixels for\nDRM1). The H4RG-10 detectors require further development to become spacequalified, but have a substantial advantage of 4 times as many pixels in a similar\nsized package. The orbit of DRM2 is the Earth-Sun L2 libration point, and the\noperational lifetime is 3 years. With the improved sensors, DRM2 has similar\nsensitivity to DRM1 for a fixed observation time, and can achieve many \xe2\x80\x94 but not\nall \xe2\x80\x94 of the Decadal Survey science objectives within its 3-year design lifetime. It\nis assumed that the actual observing plan for a WFIRST utilizing the DRM2 mission\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n12\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nconcept will be optimized based on the data available at that time. All Decadal\nSurvey objectives could be covered in an extended mission, although the time for\nguest investigator science would likely be significantly reduced compared to DRM1.\nBoth DRM1 and DRM2 represent viable mission concepts that address the\nfundamental goals of the Decadal Survey recommendations. DRM1 is more\ncapable; DRM2 is less expensive. The cost for DRM1 is estimated to be $1.6B,\nconsistent with the Decadal Survey cost estimate for JDEM-Omega. The cost for\nDRM2 is estimated to be ~1.0B. The SDT report has a strong recommendation for\nnear-term NASA investment to further develop H4RG detectors as a cost-effective\nway to improve the science return of any WFIRST design.\n\n4. Feasibility study of an optic design imaging 0.375 deg2\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nAn attractive alternative to the SDT\xca\xbcs DRM1 and DRM2 designs are the application\nof an NRO telescope to the science goals of WFIRST. The design of these\ntelescopes provides a native wide-angle field-of-view, and in its current\nconfiguration could support a wide field imaging camera of at least 0.375 deg2, the\nplanned field-of-view (FOV) of DRM1. As a proof-of-concept to using an NRO\ntelescope \xe2\x80\x9cas is,\xe2\x80\x9d we offer a wide-field instrument that provides a FOV of 0.375\ndeg2, sketched in Figures 4 and 5. The optical parameters of the unaltered twomirror telescope were used, but the mirror surfaces were assumed to have zero\nwavefront error.\nThe instrument is designed to fit in the space behind the primary mirror and\nconsists of two fold mirrors followed by tertiary and quaternary mirrors. The tertiary\nand quaternary mirrors are both conic with an aspheric term that corrects coma.\nThe respective sizes of the two mirrors are 0.58 x 0.38 meters and 0.4 x 0.26\nmeters.\nAn aspheric plate that corrects spherical is located near the pupil of the system.\n(Because it is thin and unpowered, it does not cause significant chromatic\naberrations.) The pupil is real and accessible to allow a good position for filters;\ntwo filter wheels can be accommodated. This design uses filters that are 5.4 inches\nin diameter. A grism for R \xe2\x89\x88 600 spectroscopy, the dispersion chosen in DRM1 for\nthe BAO redshift survey, is carried in the filter wheel. A spectrum covering a\nwavelength range of 1.3\xe2\x80\x932.0\xc2\xb5m (for an H\xce\xb1 redshift survey 1 < z < 2, see Section\n5.2) extends about 3.3 mm at the detector, or ~300 pixels of the 4k array; each\npixel covers about 0.0023\xc2\xb5m in wavelength, or about 430 km s-1.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n13\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nFigure 4: An example of a possible wide-field instrument that can be added to\nthe unaltered NRO telescope. The system has a total field of view of more than\n0.375 deg2, and fits into the accessible space behind the primary mirror. (Each\nray bundle originates from a different field point in the system.)\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nA sketch of the system\xca\xbcs RMS wavefront error as a function of angle on the sky is\nshown in Figure 6. The RMS wavefront error is less than 50 nm over most of the\nFOV, allowing for diffraction-limited imaging (and thus a stable PSF) for\nwavelengths above approximately 0.7\xc2\xb5m. The regions toward the bottom of the\nplot with very low wavefront error (toward the center field) are inaccessible due to\nthe off-axis nature of this design; reflected beams need room to pass by the other\noptics in the system as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n14\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nFigure 5: Additional views of the wide-field instrument. The beam path order is\nfold 1, fold 2, tertiary, pupil, quaternary, and image plane. The field angles\nwere chosen so that beams have adequate clearance from the edges of the\nother optics in the system.\n\nThe image plane layout is designed in three squares, as shown on the sky in\nFigure 6 (superposed on the map of wavefront error). The configuration allows for\neasy tiling on the sky for observations that require large-scale surveys. Each of the\nthree squares contains a 3x3 array of detectors; each detector is 4k x 4k pixels,\nwith each pixel covering 0.11 arcsec on the sky and 10\xc2\xb5m on the image plane.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nThis is a proof-of-concept system only, and as such, issues with the design remain.\nThe issues are engineering challenges, though, not fundamental limitations.\nAmong the issues:\nRMS wavefront error could be improved, to make room for alignment and surface\nfigure errors.\nThe instrument has uncorrected distortion.\nAdditional clearance is needed between the beam and fold mirror 2.\nThere is inadequate clearance between the back of the detector plane, where\nelectronics must be located, and the pupil, where the filter wheel will be located.\n15\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe filters must currently be 5.4 inches in diameter, which results in a large pupil\nwheel or sliding stage.\nThe image plane configuration must be slightly reconfigured to allow for small gaps\nbetween the detectors.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nFigure 6: A plot of the as-designed RMS wavefront error of the wide-field\ninstrument as a function of angle on the sky. The range of the wavefront error\ncontours is from 0 to 0.1\xc2\xb5m. The line of 0.05\xc2\xb5m wavefront error is shown in\nred, and indicates \xce\xbb/20 performance for a wavelength of 1\xc2\xb5m. The image plane\noutlines are shown in green and encompass a total of 0.375 deg2 on the sky.\nPossible detector array locations are indicated by the gray dashed lines; 27 4k\nx 4k detectors with a pixel size of 0.11 arcsec would be required to cover the\nfull field of 0.375 deg2\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n4.1 Alternate preliminary designs\nThe above design by E. Elliott at STScI was presented at the Princeton NEW\nTelescopes workshop by John MacKenty:\nhttp://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/NRO_Meeting/mackenty.pptx\nAnother, more detailed proof-of-concept design, from the WFIRST Project office at\nGSFC, to use one of the NRO telescopes for WFIRST, was presented by Jeffrey\nKruk:\nhttp://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/NRO_Meeting/Kruk_NRO_TelWkshp_final.pdf\nThis design has instrumentation similar to that of the payload concepts described in\nthe WFIRST SDT Final Report. Based on a thorough analysis, the study concludes\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n16\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nthat the performance of the NRO telescopes in conducting the WFIRST mission is\nsignificantly better in most respects than those contemplated in the SDT report for\nDRM1 and DRM2. The impacts of these performance differences on each WFIRST\nobserving program is discussed, and key trade studies needing investigation by the\nnext Science Definition Team are listed.\nThe payload design assumes that the telescope is used \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d and that\ninstruments must be modular and serviceable in-flight. The instrument volume is\ndivided into three independent modules. A preliminary optical design for a threemirror camera that fits within one such module provides diffraction-limited imaging\nover 0.28 deg2. Filter and prism specifications are as given in the SDT Final Report.\nA duplicate instrument placed in a second instrument bay would double the FOV.\nThe remaining bay can accommodate an auxiliary fine guidance sensor (needed\nduring prism observations), a coronagraph, and perhaps additional small FOV\ninstruments.\nThe NRO telescopes provide a narrower PSF and larger collecting area than the\n1.1m and 1.3m telescopes studied by the SDT, but supports a somewhat smaller\nFOV in a single instrument. For each program, the optimization of area surveyed\nversus depth needs to be reassessed. In many cases, the increased read noise\nand observing overheads associated with short exposures tend to favor narrower\nand deeper surveys. The GSFC\xca\xbcs design team presentation concluded that the\nimproved spatial sampling and increased depth for a given exposure time are so\ngreat as to enable qualitative advances in the science program.\nRodger Thompson described a distinctively different conceptual design, called\nWNEW, for an NRO implementation of WFIRST:\nhttp://www.princeton.edu/astro/news-events/public-events/new-telescopemeeting/program/NEW-Telescope-Meeting-Sept-2012-Program.pdf\nThe novel feature of WNEW is the use of dichroics to produce four 0.25 deg2 focal\nplanes all viewing the same position on the sky. In dichroic mode WNEW views\nthe sky in four filters simultaneously and then switches to a second set of dichroics\nto view in four different filters. Only two observations are required to view in 8\ndifferent filters. In principle, the combination of the dichroic mode and the larger\naperture of the 2.4m NRO telescope allows WNEW to complete all of the WFIRST\nDRM observations in roughly 25% of the time required by WFIRST. In addition,\nWNEW carries out the its imaging surveys in 8 filters rather than 4 with DRM1 or\nthe GSFC design. By using WNEW in single focal plane or partial dichroic mode,\nobservations with specialized filters, for example, narrow or very broad band would\nbe possible. An example of an additional deep imaging science program is\ndescribed that would image four 1 deg2 fields in all 8 dichroic mode filters. It\nachieves 5\xcf\x83 AB mag per pixel ranging from 32 to 31 for all but the longest\nphotometric band, where telescope thermal emission limits the AB mag to 30.54.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n17\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nAlthough a detailed design for implementing the WFIRST program on an NRO\n2.4m is much needed, these preliminary exercises demonstrate that there is a\nfeasible design for a wide-field camera with a FOV sufficient to carry out the\nWFIRST program\n\n5. How well can an NRO telescope carry out the WFIRST mission?\n5.1 Overview\nWFIRST as defined by NWNH has several scientific programs:\ni. Dark Energy Program (cf. GR modification), including general purpose highGalactic-latitude \xe2\x80\x9cfractions of the sky\xe2\x80\x9d photometric and spectroscopic survey\nfor weak lensing (WL) and BAO tests of cosmic expansion, respectively.\nii. Microlensing Planet Finding, a demographic survey of Mars-sized and\nlarger planets that will complement and complete the Kepler survey by finding\nplanets more than ~1AU from the parent star. Planet frequencies, orbits, and\nmasses beyond the \xe2\x80\x9csnow-line\xe2\x80\x9d is essential information for developing a\ntheory of planet formation.\niii. General Astrophysics program, including data from the dark energy nearIR surveys, other Guest Observer (GO) surveys, synoptic surveys, and\ntargeted (single field) imaging proposed and carried out through the GO\nprogram.\nIn the following sections, we compare the performance of a NEW WFIRST with the\nscience programs studied in the SDT report. We can most easily attempt to\nquantify the gain for dark energy science and microlensing science. For dark\nenergy, the larger aperture enables a three times larger supernova survey, a\nsignificantly deeper and wider weak lensing survey, and a wider (but shallower)\nredshift survey. The larger aperture also enables strong lensing measurements of\n~104 clusters in its 10,000 deg2 weak lensing survey. This provides a fourth\napproach for astronomical measurements of the effects of dark energy. For the\nmicrolensing science program, the improved sensitivity should nearly double the\nnumber of detected Earth mass planets, for example.\nHowever, the greatest scientific gain of NEW WFIRST will be in the general\nastrophysics program, where the improved spatial resolution provides Hubble-class\nGO programs. We describe sample programs in the Milky Way Galaxy and its\nneighbors that focus on stellar populations, extragalactic programs that involve\nclusters of galaxies, the co-evolution of AGN and galaxies, and finally a series of\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n18\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nprograms, from QSOs to lensed galaxies to Ly\xce\xb1 emitters, that probe the epoch of\ncosmic dawn. Much of the science described here will use data that come directly\nfrom the wide-field dark energy surveys or from surveys of similar depth in other\nparts of the sky. In this discussion we call out specifically a number of programs\nthat require smaller-area, deeper surveys, or very deep single-field imaging. We\nexpect that, over the lifetime of NEW WFIRST, a balanced program of all kinds will\nproduce a science program of richness and depth approaching the unrivaled\nscience bounty of HST.\nThe following science discussions all assume a \xe2\x80\x9croom temperature\xe2\x80\x9d telescope with\ndetectors cooled to 100 K. In a few cases the advantages of a cooler operating\ntemperature are noted, but the performance of NEW WFIRST discussed here is not\ndependent on this possibility.\n\n5.2 The Dark Energy Program: NEW WFIRST Performance\nThe dark energy program of the WFIRST SDT DRM1 implementation has three\ndistinct components: a synoptic survey to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae\nat redshifts 0.2 < z < 1.7, a wide area 4-band (YJHK) imaging survey for weak\nlensing measurements, and a slitless spectroscopic survey to obtain redshifts of\nemission line galaxies in the redshift range 1.3 < z < 2.7 for measuring galaxy\nclustering \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, to constrain the expansion history using baryon acoustic\noscillations (BAO) and the rate of structure growth using redshift-space distortions\n(RSD). These techniques are described in the SDT report and in more detail in\nWeinberg et al. (2012). In the 5-year primary mission of SDT DRM1, the SNe\nprogram would occupy 0.45 years of observation spread over a 1.8-year interval,\nreturning to a set of fields for 33 hours out of every five days. The high-latitude\nsurvey (HLS) would occupy 2.4 years of observation, covering a total of 3,400 deg2\nwith 4-band imaging and resolution R \xe2\x89\x88 600 spectroscopy. More area could of\ncourse be covered in an extended mission after the 5-year primary mission.\nWe will assess the power of an NRO-based implementation of WFIRST by scaling\nto the capabilities of SDT DRM1. For purposes of this scaling analysis, we make\nthe following assumptions:\n1) the ratio of aperture areas is 0.85\xc3\x97(2.4/1.3)2 ~ 3, where the factor of 0.85\naccounts for secondary obstruction in the NRO 2.4m telescopes.\n2) the effective long wavelength cutoff is 2.0\xc2\xb5m (vs. 2.4\xc2\xb5m for SDT DRM1),\nenabling Y, J, H, and Ks-band imaging, and enabling H-alpha galaxy redshift\nmeasurements to z = 2.0 (as compared to z = 2.7).\n3) the pixel scale is fine enough to fully sample (with a dithering strategy similar to\nthat of SDT DRM1) the images at J and H band, but not at Y band; roughly\nspeaking, this implies pixels scaled by the aperture ratio 1.3/2.4.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n19\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n4) the active area of the focal plane would be the same in the two implementations,\n0.375 deg2.\n5) the observing time devoted to dark energy would be the same as that in DRM1.\nWe further assume that the telescope and detectors will be cool enough that the\nsensitivity out to 2.0\xc2\xb5m scales with the aperture ratio and is not degraded in the\nNRO implementation by higher thermal noise. A final design might or might not\nsatisfy this condition, depending on details of the cooling mechanisms and the\norbit. Conversely, imaging and spectroscopy beyond 2.0\xc2\xb5m may be feasible if the\ndetectors and optics can be kept cold enough. Achieving both conditions 3 and 4\nwould require a number of pixels on NEW WFIRST three times larger than that on\nSDT DRM1, which we assume would be possible with H4RG detectors. Of course,\nan SDT design with more pixels would also be more powerful than DRM1, but we\ndo not consider this in our scaling. When measurements are limited by statistical\nerrors rather than by systematic errors, their information content (in the sense of an\ninverse variance) should scale linearly with the number of pixels (at fixed pixel size)\nand with the amount of observing time.\nWe address each of the three dark energy programs in turn.\n5.2.1 Supernovae (SNe)\nSDT DRM1 would monitor 6.5 deg2 with the depth needed to discover and measure\nType Ia SNe to z = 0.8, and 1.8 deg2 with the depth needed to measure Type Ia\nSNe to z = 1.7. This survey is expected to yield about 1900 confirmed Type Ia SNe\ndetections, yielding measurements of the luminosity distance DL (z) in 16 redshift\nbins of width \xce\x94z = 0.1. The photometry and redshift measurements are accurate\nenough to yield statistical errors in distance modulus \xcf\x83\xce\xbc \xe2\x89\xa4 0.02 per redshift bin (1%\nin luminosity distance), after averaging over all supernovae in the bin. The SDT\nreport considers two scenarios for systematic errors, a "conservative" one in which\nthe systematic error per \xce\x94z = 0.1 redshift bin is 0.02 \xc3\x97 (1+z)/1.8 mag, and an\n\xe2\x80\x9coptimistic" one in which it is 0.01 \xc3\x97 (1+z)/1.8 mag. These systematic errors are\nassumed to be uncorrelated from one redshift bin to another, so the overall\ndemand on systematics is tighter by a factor of ~ (Nbin)-1/2= 4. The aggregate\nprecision of the luminosity distance measurement, including the contribution of\nsystematic errors, is (\xce\xa3i [\xce\x94ln DL(zi)]-2)-1/2 = 0.32% for the conservative case and\n0.23% for the optimistic case. The DRM1 SN survey incorporates JHK imaging,\nwhich we assume would become YJH in the case of NEW WFIRST.\nTo a first approximation, we expect that the survey speed for NEW WFIRST would\nbe faster than that of SDT DRM1 by a factor of three because of the aperture ratio,\nneglecting increased overheads associated with more frequent repositioning of the\ntelescope. For the conservative systematics case, the DRM1 SN survey is limited\nby systematic errors in most bins. In this scenario, therefore, an NRO\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n20\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nimplementation of WFIRST could do the SN program faster, but it might not do\nmuch better in the end, because increasing the number of supernovae would have\nonly moderate impact on the total error. Indeed, a NEW WFIRST supernova\nsurvey might perform worse, because it would be limited (at each redshift) to bluer\nrest-frame wavelengths, where the intrinsic scatter of SNe peak luminosities is\n(slightly) larger, and where the systematics associated with dust extinction are\nlarger.\nFor the optimistic systematics case, the DRM1 SN survey is limited by statistical\nerrors. In this scenario, a NEW WFIRST survey could perform substantially better\nin the same amount of observing time simply by measuring more supernovae. If\nwe assume that the rms statistical error in each redshift bin drops by \xe2\x88\x9a3, then the\naggregate precision of the luminosity distance measurement improves from 0.23%\nto 0.17%. We expect the SN program contribution to performance measures like\nthe Dark Energy Task Force (Albrecht et al. 2006) Figure-of-Merit (FoM) to scale\napproximately as (\xcf\x83SN)-2. Of course, the different characteristics of the NEW\nWFIRST telescope might lead to a different optimization strategy, allowing greater\nimprovement than simply implementing the SDT DRM1 strategy over a 3\xc3\x97 larger\narea. For example, a SN survey with NEW WFIRST might take advantage of the\nlarger aperture by increasing the survey area for high-redshift (z > 0.8) supernovae.\nThe above analysis highlights the enormous importance of controlling systematics\nin a SN survey using NEW WFIRST. Because of the greater statistical power\nafforded by the larger aperture, the demands on systematics are tighter, but the\nloss of the longer wavelengths makes them more challenging to achieve. For\nexample, evolution of the SN population over the redshift range of the survey could\nresult in systematic errors that would ultimately limit the accuracy of this method.\nAnother is the requirement for highly accurate relative photometry over a wide span\nof flux and redshift, with proper accounting for the redshifting of the complex SN\nspectral energy distribution. A reevaluation of how to control these potential\nsources of systematic error is needed because of the specific characteristics of a\nNEW WFIRST SN survey. Issues to be studied would likely include the resolution\nand wavelength cut-off of a prism or grism, the possibility of observing bright SNe\nin Ks band (even with a warm telescope), one or more spectrograph slits, and an\nIFU (providing separate clean spectra of host and SN, see Appendix B of the SDT\nReport). Spectroscopic observations of discovered SNe are one approach to\nreducing systematics \xe2\x80\x94\t\r \xc2\xa0 by measuring SN brightness over fixed rest-frame\nwavelength bands, thereby eliminating the need for k-corrections, and by\naddressing evolution systematics by matching SNe spectra. Another approach to\ntaming systematics could be extending the red end of SN photometric\nmeasurements to reduce extinction and intrinsic variance.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n21\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n5.2.2 Weak Lensing (WL)\nThe WFIRST SDT DRM1 survey would obtain galaxy shape measurements in\nthree bands (JHK). The fourth band (Y) provides valuable leverage for photometric\nredshifts, but the pixel scale is too coarse to fully sample the Y-band images,\nprecluding shape measurements with the accuracy required for WL. The DRM1\nHLS would achieve an effective source surface density (i.e., a surface density\nweighted by the S/N of the shape measurements) of about 40 galaxies arcmin-2,\nyielding 480 million shape measurements over its 3400 deg2 area. These would\nallow precise measurements of the cosmic shear power spectrum in multiple\n"tomographic" bins of photometric redshift. The aggregate precision predicted for\nthe shear power spectrum measurement (i.e., the precision on a constant factor\nmultiplying the power spectrum at all redshifts) is 0.29%. This statistical precision\nimposes stringent demands on control of systematics, in particular the systematics\non galaxy shape measurement.\nThe SDT report sets the requirement on WL systematics at a level that would allow\nthe WL survey to remain statistics-dominated even if it were increased in area to\n104 deg2, and detailed analysis indicates that the determination of the PSF from\nobservations of stars should be accurate enough to control shape systematics at\nthis extraordinarily stringent level, given the number of degrees of freedom in the\noptical system. Most WL galaxies would have shape measurements in all three\nbands, so the survey can independently measure three shear auto-correlation\nfunctions and three band-to-band cross-correlation functions. Since the true WL\nsignal should be achromatic, this redundancy allows powerful internal tests for\nsystematic errors, and informative diagnostics for any systematics that are\ndetected.\nFrom the point of view of weak lensing, an NRO implementation of WFIRST has\ntwo key advantages relative to SDT DRM1: faster survey speed because of its\nlarger collecting area, and higher angular resolution because of its smaller\ndiffraction limit. It also has two key disadvantages: the loss of K-band because of\nits higher operating temperature, and a more complex PSF of an obstructed as\ncompared to an unobstructed optical system. One consequence of the latter is that\nthe gain in angular resolution is smaller than the naive expectation from the ratio of\nmirror diameters; a second is that determination of the PSF at the required level of\naccuracy is more challenging.\nScaling with the assumptions above suggests that NEW WFIRST would be able to\ncover about three times the area of SDT DRM1 in the same amount of observing\ntime, surveying 104 deg2 instead of 3400 deg2. This would enable NEW WFIRST to\ncover a large fraction of the sky available at high Galactic and ecliptic latitudes.\n(Observations become less efficient at low Galactic latitude because of extinction\nand at low ecliptic latitude because of greater zodiacal background.) Furthermore,\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n22\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nfor the same limiting magnitude, the higher angular resolution would increase the\neffective source density. For plausible assumptions about the optical design, the\nhalf-light radius of the PSF would be about 1.3 times smaller for NEW FIRST,\nwhich should increase the effective source density by 30-50% if we assume that\nshape measurements can be made down to the same ratio of reff/rPSF. We would\nthus expect the number of galaxies with shape measurements to increase by a\nfactor of ~ 4, reducing rms statistical errors on the WL power spectrum by about a\nfactor of two. Contributions to the DETF FoM should again scale roughly as the\ninverse variance of the power spectrum error, so this would represent a dramatic\n(approximately a factor of 4) increase in the power of the WL survey.\nThe greater statistical power of NEW WFIRST imposes stricter demands on the\ncontrol of systematics relative to SDT DRM1, but the characteristics of the\ntelescope impose greater challenges. We assume that the pixel scale on NEW\nWFIRST would not be fine enough for shape measurements in Y-band, but would\nbe fine enough to allow J- and H-band shape measurements. This is a significant\nloss of redundancy relative to SDT DRM1, but it still allows measurement of two\nauto-correlations and one band-to-band cross-correlation (the same level of\nredundancy as in the WFIRST Interim Design Reference Mission). We regard this\nas a minimum requirement \xe2\x80\x94 there is little point in measuring WL with\nunprecedented statistical precision if one cannot check the measurement accuracy.\nThe PSF for NEW WFIRST would be more complex than for the unobstructed SDT\ndesign, and a five-mirror optical path has more degrees-of-freedom to constrain\nthan a three-mirror design. On the positive side, the NRO telescopes have active\nsecondary mirrors that can be adjusted in response to wavefront sensors.\nAn NRO-based implementation would require careful simulations of survey\nstrategies and calibration methods to ensure that the PSF can be determined with\nthe necessary degree of accuracy. However, while we view keeping shapemeasurement systematics below the statistical errors as a significant challenge, we\ndo not see any show-stoppers. Another systematics challenge for WFIRST weak\nlensing is calibrating the distribution of photometric redshifts, for which one wants\nhighly complete spectroscopic samples of ~105 galaxies that sample the full\nmagnitude and color range of the photometric sample. Compiling these calibration\nsamples will require a combination of ground- and space-based observations, but\nthe larger aperture of NEW WFIRST would be a significant asset for this purpose\nrelative to SDT DRM1.\n5.2.3 Galaxy Redshift Survey (BAO and RSD)\nThe spectroscopic component of the SDT DRM1 HLS would cover 3400 deg2 to a\nline flux sensitivity of 1.0 \xc3\x97 10-16 erg/cm2/sec, sufficient to measure the H\xce\xb1\nemission-line redshift of a 1.1 L* star forming galaxy at z=1.5 and a 1.7 L* starforming galaxy at z = 2.6. Forecasts based on recent observational estimates of\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n23\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nthe H\xce\xb1 luminosity function and the clustering bias of high-redshift emission-line\ngalaxies indicate that the survey would measure redshifts of about 17 million\ngalaxies over 3400 deg2 in the redshift range 1.3 < z < 2.7, yielding BAO\ndeterminations of the angular diameter distance DA(z) and Hubble parameter H(z)\nin 14 \xce\x94z = 0.1 redshift bins. The forecast aggregate precision from BAO is (\xce\xa3i [\xce\x94ln\nDA(zi)]-2)-1/2 \xe2\x89\x88 0.5% for DA and (\xce\xa3i [\xce\x94ln H(zi)]-2)-1/2 \xe2\x89\x88 0.7% for H, and analyses using\nthe full galaxy power spectrum could improve the precision by a factor ~1.5-2,\ndepending on the accuracy that can be achieved in modeling of non-linear\nevolution and non-linear galaxy bias. The precision of RSD measurements\ndepends on how small a scale one can reach before systematic uncertainties in\nmodeling non-linear effects exceed statistical errors: for assumptions that are\nprobably conservative, the SDT report forecasts an aggregate error of 1.4% on the\nproduct \xcf\x838m(z)f(z) of the fluctuation amplitude and logarithmic growth rate.\nFrom the point of view of BAO measurements, the critical properties of a redshift\nsurvey are its comoving volume and its sampling density, specifically the product\nnP of the mean galaxy space density n, and the amplitude of the galaxy power\nspectrum P(k) at the wavenumber characteristic of BAO, approximately k = 0.2 h\nMpc-1. Relative to a survey with perfect sampling (i.e., very large n), the BAO\nmeasurement from a sparsely sampled survey is degraded in variance by a factor\nof ~ (1+1/nP), equivalent to reducing the volume of a perfectly sampled survey by\nthe same factor. Given recent estimates of emission line galaxy bias, the SDT\nDRM1 redshift survey is forecast to have nP > 1.2 from z = 1.3 - 2.3, so in this\nrange it would be limited mainly by finite volume rather than galaxy shot noise. The\npredicted sampling density falls to nP = 0.5 by z = 2.65. With the same\nassumptions, the Euclid redshift survey has nP > 1 only for 0.7 < z < 1, falling to nP\n\xe2\x89\x88 0.3 by z = 1.3 and nP \xe2\x89\x88 0.15 at the outer redshift limit z = 2.0.\nWith a 2.0\xc2\xb5m cutoff, a NEW WFIRST redshift survey would be limited to z < 2.0;\nthe lower redshift cutoff would probably be dropped below z = 1.3, depending on\nthe degree to which ground-based surveys had fully sampled this redshift range.\nHowever, NEW WFIRST should be able to map to the same flux limit about three\ntimes faster than SDT DRM1, so in the same observing time it could cover ~104\ndeg2 instead of 3400 deg2, with nP > 1 over the full redshift range of the survey. In\ncontrast to SN and WL, the systematic errors for BAO are expected to be easily\nsub-dominant to statistical errors, so the likely gain (in the sense of inverse\nvariance or contribution to DETF FoM) is a factor ~ 3 or more. RSD measures of\nstructure growth should gain by a similar factor, as should other approaches using\nthe galaxy power spectrum, up to the point that they become limited by systematic\nuncertainties in theoretical modeling.\nRelative to SDT DRM1, a NEW WFIRST redshift survey would be less\ncomplementary to Euclid\'s because it would cover essentially the same redshift\nrange. However, even if it mapped the same sky area as Euclid, it would not be\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n24\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nredundant, because Euclid\'s BAO measurements at z > 1 will be severely\ndegraded (relative to a perfect survey) by shot noise, while NEW WFIRST would\nnot. The aggregate statistical precision of the NEW WFIRST measurements of\nBAO and RSD would be substantially higher than Euclid\'s (because of greater\ndepth) or SDT DRM1\'s (because of greater area), yielding greater leverage on dark\nenergy.\n5.2.4 Dark Energy Performance: Summary\nWith the assumptions outlined above, an NRO-based implementation of WFIRST\nwould have roughly three times the survey speed of SDT DRM1 to the same depth.\nIt would have higher angular resolution, but it would likely have a shorter red\nwavelength cutoff or reduced sensitivity at its reddest wavelengths.\nIn the same amount of observing time, NEW WFIRST could carry out a\nsubstantially larger SN survey than SDT DRM1. However, the relative performance\nwould depend critically on the ability of NEW WFIRST to achieve comparable or\nbetter control of systematics. The absence of K-band imaging is a significant loss\nin this regard. Using an IFU for SN spectroscopy and spectrophotometry becomes\nan especially attractive option for NEW WFIRST, perhaps enabling a SN program\nthat is substantially better than that of DRM1 in both statistics and systematics.\nFor WL, NEW WFIRST could achieve a factor ~3 increase in survey area in the\nsame observing time, covering much of the sky that is available at high Galactic\nand ecliptic latitudes. It should also achieve a higher effective source density\nbecause of higher angular resolution, and the combined effect could be a factor ~ 4\nin the number of galaxies with good shape measurements. Achieving the required\ncontrol of shape measurement systematics will be more difficult because of the\ngreater PSF complexity, but it should be possible if sufficient attention is paid to\nthese systematics when designing the hardware, survey strategy, and analysis\nsoftware. The loss of K-band imaging reduces redundancy and the ability to carry\nout internal consistency checks, but making shape measurements in two bands (J,\nH) rather than three is acceptable. An additional band between H-band and K-band\nwith a red cutoff of 2.0\xc2\xb5m could be considered to mitigate the loss of K-band.\nFor BAO, RSD, and other applications of galaxy clustering, NEW WFIRST could\nagain achieve a factor ~3 increase in survey area relative to SDT DRM1. The\nredshift range of the emission line galaxy survey would shift because of the\nwavelength cutoff, perhaps covering 1.0 < z < 2.0 instead of 1.3 < z < 2.7. While\nthe resulting measurements would be less complementary to Euclid\'s, their\nstatistical precision would be much better than either Euclid\'s or SDT DRM1\'s, with\na clear net gain for dark energy constraints.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n25\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nNote that our assumption of fixed focal plane area is crucial to these conclusions.\nIf we instead assumed fixed pixel count, then the smaller area associated with finer\npixels would give up most of the gains described above. An SDT-like WFIRST with\nH4RG detectors and a larger total pixel count could also outperform the SDT DRM1\ndesign. The maximum focal plane area with good image quality in an SDT-like\ndesign is probably ~0.6 deg2, so the maximum gain in survey speed relative to\nDRM1 would be a factor ~1.6. However, an extended mission (10 years rather than\n5 years) could make up much of the remaining ground, relative to 5 years with\nNEW WFIRST.\n\n5.3 The Exoplanet Microlensing Program: NEW WFIRST Performance\nIn broad-brush strokes, it is fairly straightforward to demonstrate that a suitable\nNRO implementation of WFIRST is likely to be more capable than any of the\nWFIRST SDT DRM designs, in the sense of allowing a higher planet yield per unit\nobserving time for the same assumptions. Furthermore, the NRO implementation\nof the WFIRST design may allow one to substantially increase the sensitivity, and\nmay provide dramatically more information about the properties of the individual\nplanet detections. However, demonstrating these two ideas conclusively requires\nadditional study.\nWe first provide the basic argument that suggests a more capable mission for the\nNEW WFIRST, and then provide a somewhat more detailed estimate of the\nimproved yields.\n5.3.1 General considerations\nThe qualitative science requirements for a space-based microlensing survey are (1)\nsensitivity to a large number of planets over a broad region of mass and semimajor axis, (2) sensitivity to planets with mass down to that of Mars, (3) sensitivity\nto free-floating planets down to the mass of the Earth, and (4) ability to obtain mass\nmeasurements for a significant fraction of the primary lens stars.\nPlanetary companions to stars are detected via short-duration (hour to day),\nrelatively low-amplitude (one to tens of percent), planetary deviations from the\nlonger timescale (weeks to years) microlensing events caused by their host stars.\nThe planetary perturbations become briefer and more rare as the planet mass\ndecreases, with Earth-mass planets having detection probabilities of <1% and\ndurations of order an hour. Free-floating planets are detected as isolated\nmicrolensing events; the durations and probabilities of these events also decrease\nas the planet mass decreases. For both bound and free-floating planets, the\nminimum detectable mass is set of by the angular size of the source star: planets\nwith the mass of Mars or less give rise to relatively low-amplitude perturbations\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n26\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n(<~10%) due to suppression and smoothing by the finite size of the typical mainsequence stars. Finally, measuring the mass of luminous primary stars requires\nmeasuring the relative proper motion between the lens and source, which are 2-10\nmilliarcseconds (mas) per year.\nFor a typical microlensing event, the detection probability for an Earth-mass planet\nat 2 AU is ~1.5%; therefore, in order to detect of order 200 such planets, a total of\n~200/0.015 ~104 microlensing events must be found and monitored for planetary\nperturbations. The microlensing event rate toward the Galactic bulge is\n5x105/star/year, and thus ~104/5x10-5/stars/year \xe2\x89\x88 200 million star-years must be\nmonitored. The stars must be monitored with the cadence needed to detect and\nresolve the perturbations of the lowest-mass planets of interest, which translates\ninto a cadence of ~15 minutes. The photometric precision must be sufficient to\ndetect the 5\xe2\x80\x9310% perturbations at high signal-to-noise ratio, so photometry with a\nprecision of a few percent is required for the faintest monitored stars. The typical\nstellar density in the Galactic bulge is ~108 stars per square degree down to J=23.\nThus, areas of more than 2 square degrees must be monitored with cadences of\n~15 minutes, and the total photon rate must be sufficient that photometric\nprecisions of a few percent are obtained for the faintest sources. This latter\nrequirement can be met by mirror apertures of more than 1 meter, wide-band nearIR observations, and high angular resolution \xe2\x80\x94 needed in order to resolve the\ndense background of blended stars. Given the areal density of ~108 stars per\nsquare degree, this implies angular resolutions of <0.4", commensurate with an\naperture of 1m or larger and observations at \xce\xbb ~ 1.5\xc2\xb5m.\nThus the primary requirements for planet detection are (1) a relatively large\n(substantial fraction of a degree), near-IR focal plane, (2) effective aperture of more\nthan 1m with a wide near-IR bandpass, (3) angular resolution of <0.4". Once the\nthird requirement is met, the total yield of planet detections scales primarily with the\ntotal amount of observing time (nearly linearly), the area of the detector, and the\ntotal photon collection rate for typical source. In addition, these three factors can\nalso be traded off of one another. Therefore, given that the NEW WFIRST has a\nlarger total photon collection rate, and provided that the detector will have a similar\neffective area as in the SDT DRM designs, then NEW WFIRST will be more\nintrinsically capable, i.e., will yield more planet detections per unit observing time.\nThere are additional, secondary requirements that may bear on the NEW WFIRST\ndesign and its ability to carry out a microlensing mission. First, the spacecraft must\nbe able to point continuously or nearly continuously at the Galactic bulge for at\nleast the duration of the typical primary microlensing events, or more than 40 days.\nSecond, the storage capacity and downlink rate must be sufficient to store and\ntransmit the ~700 full-frame images per day during the bulge observations. Third,\nthere are requirements on the pointing accuracy and slew-and-settle times. Finally,\na broad near-IR filter and a narrower bluer filter are required, the first for the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n27\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nprimary science data, with observations in the second filter acquired every ~12\nhours for characterization of the source stars. This, in turn, leads to a requirement\non the total number of filter changes during the microlensing experiment of >1000.\nIn addition to a large yield of planets over a broad region of parameter space, the\nother dramatic improvement of a space-based microlensing mission over groundbased surveys is the ability to automatically estimate the masses of the majority of\nthe planetary host stars and thus planetary companions. This qualitatively new\ncapability is enabled by the small and stable PSFs afforded in space. PSFs of\nangular size <0.4" essentially resolve out most of the background stars, and thus\nallow one to isolate the time-variable flux of the microlensed source from any flux\nfrom the lens, or companions to the lens or source. Light from companions to the\nlens and source can be further distinguished from light from the lens based on\nobservations taken over a very wide time baseline from the event, which will allow\none to infer the relative lens-source proper motion as the source and lens move\napart. The number of events for which this measurement can be made depends\nquite sensitively on the PSF size and stability (Bennett et al. 2007). For this\napplication, therefore, NEW WFIRST may prove substantially more capable than\nany of the SDT DRM1 designs.\nA quantitative assessment of the potential of NEW WFIRST to measure host star\nmasses requires detailed simulations, which have been done using only one of our\nsimulation codes for only one of several suggested NEW WFIRST optical layouts.\nHowever, we can make some general statements. First, at the angular resolution\nof the NRO telescope of 0.16 arcsec for a typical wavelength of 1.5\xc2\xb5m, we expect\nnearly all unrelated background stars to be resolved. Furthermore, NEW WFIRST\nwill be able to resolve sufficiently luminous companions to the lens or source with\nprojected separations of >1300 AU, although these will constitute a relatively small\nfraction of binaries.\nFinally, NEW WFIRST will likely also be able to measure the relative lens-source\nproper motion for a majority of the luminous lenses. Figure 7 shows the distribution\nof lens-source proper motions for a sample of microlensing from a WFIRST\nsimulation. The peak of the distribution occurs near 5 mas/yr, and thus over the\ncourse of a ~5 year mission, the separation between the lens and source will have\nchanged by ~0.025 arcsec. For typical lens fluxes relative to the source, images\ntaken well before or after the microlensing event will exhibit a detectable\nelongation, and thus yield a measurement of the lens-source proper motion\n(Bennett et al. 2007). Figure 7 shows that DRM1 will be able to measure proper\nmotions for a little over half of the microlensing events with luminous lenses. NEW\nWFIRST will perform better, allowing measurements of the proper motion of most\nevents. One potential complication with these measurements is the more\ncomplicated PSF shape of the NRO telescope due to the obstruction of the\nsecondary mirror. This is an important topic for future study, although, it seems\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n28\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nlikely that the weak lensing requirements on the PSF shape will be more stringent\nthan are required for the mircolensing planet search.\n\nFigure 7: The solid black curve shows the distribution of relative lens-source\nproper motions from a Galactic simulation based on a model by Han & Gould\n(2003). The shaded red region shows a rough estimate for the range of proper\nmotions that will be detectable with the SDT DRM1 telescope (with resolution of\n0.29 arcsec), whereas the blue shaded region shows the added range for NEW\nWFIRST telescope (with resolution 0.16 arcsec).\n\n5.3.2 Comparison Between WFIRST SDT DRM1 and NEW WFIRST\nThe baseline WFIRST SDT DRM1 microlensing survey consisted of 6 uninterrupted\n72-day seasons for a total of 432 days. A total of 7 fields were monitored, for a\ntotal of 2.625 deg2. The exposure time per field was 85 s, with a cadence of 15\nminutes. The majority of the observations were taken in a wide filter "W" with 0.922.40\xc2\xb5m, with observations every 12 hours taken in a "Y" filter with 0.92-1.21\xc2\xb5m.\nThe estimated yields for SDT DRM1 are shown in Table 2. The simulation\nmethodology and assumptions are described in Section 2.2.4 and Appendix A of\nGreen et al. (2012). The "best estimate" yields are given in Table 3 of that report,\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n29\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nwhich ultimately adopts a planet distribution function for cold exoplanets as\nmeasured from ground-based microlensing surveys by Cassan et al. (2012), as\nwell as microlensing event rates extrapolated from observed rates for bright clump\ngiant sources. Very briefly, DRM1 is expected to detect ~2200 bound exoplanets\nwith masses in the range of 0.1-10,000 MEarth and semi-major axes in the range of\n0.03-30 AU. Of these, ~240 will have mass similar that of the Earth, and ~30 will\nhave mass similar to that of Mars. In addition, if there is one free-floating Earthmass planet per star in the Galaxy, SDT DRM1 will detect ~30.\nWhile we have not performed detailed simulations of a NEW WFIRST microlensing\nsurvey, we can very roughly scale the results from the SDT DRM1 to obtain a\nrough idea of the expected planet yield. To do so, we make the same set of\nassumptions adopted in Section 5.2 for evaluating the expected results of the dark\nenergy experiments. Specifically, we assume:\n1. A factor of 0.85x(2.4/1.3)2 = 2.9 larger photon rate from the larger aperture,\nwhere the factor of 0.85 accounts for the obstructed aperture.\n2. An effective wavelength cutoff of 2.0\xc2\xb5m, corresponding to a 1.27 smaller\nphoton rate relative to the SDT DRM1. The factor of 1.27 is appropriate for\na flat-spectrum source, but we adopt it uniformly for simplicity.\n3. An active field-of-view for the detector of 0.375 deg2, identical to that for the\nSDT DRM1.\n4. The same total observing time for the microlensing observations as DRM1,\n432 days.\nWe also make the following additional assumptions:\n5. We assume the same exposure time, cadence, number of fields, and field\nlocations as for SDT DRM1.\n6. We assume the contribution to the background flux due to all sources is the\nsame for both NEW WFIRST and SDT DRM1 designs.\nWe discuss the appropriateness of the last two assumptions below.\nWith these assumptions, the only effect on the yields is due to the change in the\ntotal number of photons per exposure. The net increase in the photon collection\nrate is ~0.85x(2.4/1.3)2/1.27 ~ 2.28. The effect of the increased photon rate on the\nyields depends primarily on the form of the cumulative number of detections as a\nfunction of the minimum threshold for detection, which roughly follows a power law\nof the form N(>\xce\x94\xcf\x872) \xe2\x88\x9d (\xce\x94\xcf\x872)\xce\xb1, with the exponent \xce\xb1 depending on the mass and\nseparation of the planets of interest. Averaged over separations between 0.03-30\nAU, the exponent varies from \xce\xb1 = -1.2 for low-mass planets of ~0.1MEarth, to \xce\xb1 =-0.3\nfor high-mass planets of mass >100 MEarth. Since \xce\x94\xcf\x872 \xe2\x88\x9d Nphot, this number of\ndetections scales with the photon rate in the same way. We have calibrated this\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n30\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nscaling explicitly using simulations that adopted different photon rates, but were\notherwise identical.\nThe yields estimated in this way are compared to the yields from DRM1 in Table 2.\nOverall, we estimate that NEW WFIRST will detect ~1.6 times more planets, with\nyields that are a factor of 30-40% larger for the high-mass planets increasing up to\na factor of ~3 times larger for Mars-mass planets. The dramatic increase in the\nyields of the lowest-mass planets simply reflects the fact that these planets are\nnear the edge of the mission sensitivity for DRM1. This further suggests that NEW\nWFIRST may have significant sensitivity to other classes of planets that were just\nbeyond the region of primary sensitivity for DRM1, e.g., very small separation\nplanets and habitable planets.\n\nTable 2: Comparison of planet yield with SDT DRM1 and NEW WFIRST\nM/MEarth\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10,000\nTotal\n\nSDT DRM1\n30\n239\n794\n630\n367\n160\n2221\n\nNEW WFIRST\n82\n379\n1322\n1067\n509\n205\n3564\n\nTable 2: Predicted yields for bound planets for the NEW WFIRST\nimplementation, compared to the predicted yields for the SDT DRM1 mission\n(from Green et al. 2012). Both assume the same number of fields, same area\nof the detector, and the same total observing time of 432 days. For these yields,\nwe have assumed the planet distribution function for cold exoplanets as\nmeasured from ground-based microlensing surveys by Cassan et al. (2012).\nThe effects of the changes in the background flux for the NEW WFIRST design\nrelative to the SDT DRM1 design have not been considered.\n\n5.3.3 New Microlensing Event Rate Measurement\nSince 2004, the main focus of gravitational microlensing surveys of Local Group\ngalaxies has been the study of extrasolar planets, and as a result, there have been\nno papers on the microlensing rate or optical depth toward the Galactic bulge using\nevents observed more recently than 2002. However, the more recent OGLE-III,\nMOA-II, and OGLE-IV surveys have discovered more than 10 times as many\nmicrolensing events as were known in 2002. As a result, these analyses did not\nmeasure the microlensing event rate in the central Galactic bulge, and so the event\nrate estimates used for Table 2 are based upon an extrapolation from published\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n31\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nmeasurements in fields several degrees away. However, a new microlensing rate\nmeasurement from the MOA-II survey (Sumi et al., in preparation) does overlap the\nwith the WFIRST fields and is based on a much larger sample of events. This new\nmicrolensing rate measurement implies an event rate that is a factor of 1.77 larger\nthan the results listed in Table 2, so these estimates should be regarded as\nconservative.\n5.3.4 A Preliminary NEW WFIRST Microlensing Simulation\nWe have done a preliminary investigation of the GSFC NEW WFIRST proof-ofconcept design, which has a 25% smaller FOV than the SDT DRM1 and the\nbaseline STScI NEW WFIRST proof-of-concept design presented in section 4. The\nimprovement over the DRM1 exoplanet yield with this telescope design is\nsomewhat smaller than the improvement given in Table 2, due to the smaller area\nof the focal plane. When the observing strategy is optimized for this FOV, the NEW\nWFIRST survey will detect Earth-mass planets at a 35% higher rate than the DRM1\ndesign, instead of the 59% improvement listed in Table 2. However, both of these\nnumbers assume a higher data rate than was possible with the SDT DRM1 design.\nThis is not a problem for the GEO and HEO orbits being considered for NEW\nWFIRST, but it could be a problem for NEW WFIRST if it flew in an L2 orbit. In fact,\nif NEW WFIRST flies in a L2 orbit with the same data rate assumed for the SDT\nDRM1 design, the NEW WFIRST Earth-mass planet detection rate would be 24%\nlower than the SDT DRM1 discovery rate. The reason for this is that the better\nimage sampling of NEW WFIRST means that there are more pixels per star, so\nfewer stellar photometry measurements can be made with a fixed pixel download\nrate. However, there are likely to be data compression and/or data system\nhardware solutions to this problem.\n5.3.5 Caveats\nOf course, the rough estimates for the yields presented here should be considered\nonly illustrative of the improved capability of NEW WFIRST, a much more careful\nassessment using a full simulation is needed to provide robust estimates.\nSuch a simulation must in particular include a detailed accounting of the various\nbackground noise sources, whose magnitudes are likely to be significantly different\nfor NEW WFIRST relative to SDT DRM1. In particular, the ~1.8 times better\nresolution of an NRO telescope at fixed wavelength means that a larger fraction of\nthe unrelated bulge stars will be resolved, thereby lowering the background.\nFurthermore, although a shorter wavelength cutoff would result in a smaller photon\nflux, this is partially compensated by the smaller effective wavelength for the broad\nmicrolensing filter and the resulting better resolution. Of course, the improved\nresolution also means that the noise contribution due to the truly smooth\nbackgrounds (i.e., zodiacal light) will be smaller. When comparing the yields of the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n32\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n1.3m DRM1 to the 1.1m DRM2 missions, the SDT found that the net effect of these\nvarious factors was relatively small (~10%). However, the angular resolution of\nNEW WFIRST is substantially better than SDT DRM1, and therefore these effects\nare likely to be more important. In addition, one must consider the larger thermal\nbackground due to the assumed higher operating temperature of the NEW WFIRST\ntelescope.\nAnother effect we have not considered, but which is unlikely to be important for the\noverall yields, is the effect of systematics on the photometry. Due to the larger\nphoton rates, a larger number of stars in the NRO design will have photometry\nlimited by systematics, rather than photon noise statistics. However, the planetary\nperturbations of interest are a few to tens of percent, substantially larger than the\nexpected systematics limit of a few millimagnitudes. Indeed, the overwhelming\nmajority of stars are expected to be photon-noise dominated, for all conceivable\ndesigns. This is qualitatively different and in stark contrast to the dark energy\nexperiments, many of which operate near the systematics limit. In such cases, a\nmore sophisticated analysis is required to see if the larger aperture of NEW\nWFIRST translates into a net improvement in the science metrics.\n5.3.6 Future Work\nThe primary future work that is needed is a full simulation of a NEW WFIRST\nmission, in order to validate the rough scaling relations we have provided, and to\ndetermine the effects of the different backgrounds on the yields. Furthermore,\noptimization of a microlensing survey with NEW WFIRST should be carefully\nconsidered; it may well be that the optimal location, number of fields, and field\ncadence will be very different than that assumed here. Most importantly, the\nsensitivity of NEW WFIRST to planets near the edge of the sensitivity for the SDT\nDRM1 design should be carefully considered \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, for habitable planets.\nFinally, a quantitative and detailed estimate of fraction of events for which primary\nmass measurements are possible should be performed.\n\n5.4 The Stellar Populations and Properties of Local Galaxies\n5.4.1 Local Stellar Populations\nSince the first studies by Hertzsprung and Russell over 100 years ago, the Milky\nWay\'s stellar populations have represented a unique and fundamental data set for\nastronomy. Exploration of these nearby stars and star clusters provides exquisite\ndetails on many astrophysical topics, including star formation, stellar evolution, and\nthe initial mass function. These studies directly enable detailed tests of stellar\nmodels, and thereby provide the crucial calibration to link the color and luminosity\nof a distant and unresolved stellar population to its age and metallicity (Bruzual and\nCharlot 2003). More generally, the distribution of nearby stellar populations within\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n33\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nthe Milky Way provides unique insights on the formation and assembly of large\ngalaxies.\nOver the past few years, large wide-field surveys such as SDSS, 2MASS, WISE,\nRAVE, and UKIDSS have provided a wealth of new data to investigate local stellar\npopulations. Despite the many scientific rewards from these surveys (e.g., SDSS\'s\ndiscovery of those galaxies most-dominated by dark matter), astronomy still suffers\nfrom the lack of a wide-field, high-resolution IR map of the Galaxy. The NRO 2.4m\ntelescope can provide such a survey, and transform several general scientific\nareas:\n1) Stretch the color-magnitude relation of stars\nStellar populations such as globular clusters have been imaged with high-resolution\nUV and optical cameras. The sensitivity achieved with a 2.4m IR telescope will\ntransform these data sets into a panchromatic nature, thereby establishing the\nluminosity functions of post main-sequence phases of stellar evolution in the IR\nbandpasses (e.g., the RGB and AGB), and stretching age-sensitive features (e.g.,\nthe turnoff) over a wider color baseline. These data will lead to an unprecedented\ncalibration of IR stellar models and improved ages of star clusters that represent\nimportant calibrators to many astrophysical relations. As an example, Figure 8\nillustrates the morphology of the predicted color-magnitude diagram for an old\nstellar population in the optical and IR baselines (models from Dotter et al. 2007),\nas well as the associated uncertainties in the distance and reddening at fixed age\nand metallicity. The panel on the right shows a recent 3-orbit observation of 47 Tuc\nwith WFC3/IR on HST, and demonstrates the potential of future high-resolution IR\nprobes of crowded fields (Kalirai et al. 2012).\n2) Towards a complete stellar and substellar census\nLow mass stars dominate the stellar luminosity function. At an age of 1 Gyr, a 0.08\nM\xef\x82\x9d star has MV = 19, but a color of V-H = 8. The resolution and sensitivity of NEW\nWFIRST in IR bandpasses will enable the most complete stellar luminosity function\nto date, providing characterization from the brightest giants to the faintest dwarfs in\nstellar systems out to several kiloparsecs. This survey will directly inform the\nGalactic mass budget, drastically improve the color-magnitude relation of cool\nstars, and provide resolved estimates of the initial mass function and its variation\nwith environment. These quantities in turn relate to the physics governing the\ninternal and atmospheric structure of stars, and have widespread consequences for\nmany astrophysical applications, including the measurement of star formation\nmechanisms and masses of galaxies. This survey will also provide a global\nmapping of objects cooler than T dwarfs (TEFF < 700 K) \xe2\x80\x94 so called "Y dwarfs\xe2\x80\x9d.\nSuch objects must exist: objects with inferred masses down to 5 MJUP have been\nidentified in pencil beam star-forming regions. These observations can provide a\ncrucial test for the structure and evolution of both low-mass hydrogen burning stars\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n34\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nand brown dwarfs, and inform the threshold mass signifying hydrogen versus\ndeuterium burning evolution.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 8: Using the same stellar evolution models at a fixed age and metallicity\n(Dotter et al. 2007), we fit newly obtained WFC3/IR observations of 47 Tuc\n(right panel) and compare the resulting constraints on distance and reddening\nto a fit of the visual CMD of the star cluster from the ACS Survey of GCs (left\npanel) and the constraints derived from WFC3/IR data (center panel). The\ncontours represent 1, 2, and 3\xcf\x83 best-fit values. As expected, with all other\nconstraints fixed, degeneracies in the fundamental parameters of the GC are\nlargely lifted in the WFC3/IR bandpasses given the "kink" on the lower main\nsequence caused by H2 (see Kalirai et al. 2012). By combining the constraints\nfrom the visible and (more accurate) IR data in quadrature, the \xe2\x80\x9cfitting\xe2\x80\x9d error in\nthe age of 47 Tuc is improved by a factor of \xe2\x88\xbc2.\n\n3) Map substructure in the Milky Way halo\nDeep, wide-field IR imaging with NEW WFIRST will enable a new breakthrough in\nthe characterization of the Milky Way\'s stellar halo. The stellar halo is old, and\ntherefore the brightest sources in both substructure and dwarf satellites are red\ngiants. The survey will be sensitive to the complete red giant branch in systems\nout to the edge of the Milky Way halo. This will lead to a new generation of highresolution star-count maps from which the Galactic stellar density, surface\nbrightness profile, chemical abundance gradients \xe2\x80\x94 through optical-near IR\nphotometry and follow up spectroscopy \xe2\x80\x94 and level of substructure will be\nmeasured. These observed properties of the stellar halo are intimately linked to\nthe accretion processes that built up the Milky Way. A NEW WFIRST IR survey will\nalso enable the detection of a large population of low-luminosity dwarf satellites\nthat are known to exist (Tollerud et al. 2008). The luminosity function of these\ndwarf spheroidals will provide the best test to date of the missing satellite problem\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n35\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nIn addition to these general science themes, a NEW WFIRST IR survey of the Milky\nWay can enable a host of other transformational studies. For example, lower\nlatitude investigations in the Galactic plane can provide the highest resolution\nmapping of the Milky Way disk and bulge to date. The IR imaging and\nspectroscopic sensitivity will penetrate dust-obscured regions and characterize the\ntemperature and surface gravity of star-forming complexes out to the edge of the\nMilky Way. These surveys will also yield new insights on the structure of the\nGalactic disk, including the spiral structure. Surveys of the Milky Way can also\nextend SDSS studies of the remnant white dwarf luminosity function from the\nGalactic disk to the halo (e.g., Harris et al. 2006). The truncation of the remnant\nluminosity function is shaped by the formation time of the stars, and therefore such\nstudies yield independent age constraints for the halo.\n5.4.2 Extragalactic Stellar Populations\nThe scientific potential of extragalactic stellar population studies is large.\nExtragalactic stars have proven to be one of the most secure ways to probe the\nstar formation history of a galaxy, and thus anchor the "ground truth" for\nconstraining the astrophysical processes that drive galaxy formation, and for\ncalibrating widely used techniques to derive star formation rates and histories over\ncosmic distances. Although main sequence stars remain the gold standard for\nsuch work, truly ancient main sequence stars are only routinely detectable within\nthe Local Group. In contrast, luminous evolving stars are detectable to much larger\ndistances, and probe stellar populations of all ages.\nThe main factor limiting stellar population studies is angular resolution. With\nground-based telescopes, light from individual stars is blended together, prohibiting\nthe study of stars beyond the local group. In contrast, the superb resolution\navailable with a 2.4m space-based telescope allows resolution of individual red\ngiant stars out to distances of ~5 Mpc in the main body of galaxies, or out to much\nlarger distances in low surface brightness regions (halos, intracluster light, dwarf\ngalaxies, etc). High luminosity stars, which more easily rise above the crowding\nlimit, can also be detected out to distances greater than ~10 Mpc, allowing the\ndetection of massive main sequence stars, blue and red supergiants, and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (see Figure 9).\nOver the last two decades, HST has transformed the study of extragalactic stellar\npopulations, particularly in the optical. However, exploiting NIR stellar populations\nhas largely been untapped, beyond an initial HST "snapshot" survey (Dalcanton et\nal 2012a, Melbourne et al 2012), the MCT survey of M31 (Dalcanton et al 2012b),\n2MASS observations of the Magellanic Clouds (Nikolaev & Weinberg 2000) and\nsmall fields observed with adaptive optics from the ground (e.g., Melbourne et al\n2010, Olsen et al 2006, Davidge et al 2005). Optical studies as well have been\nlimited by the area accessible in a single ACS or WFC3/UVIS field of view. We\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n36\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nnow highlight just three of the many ways in which red optical and NIR wide-field\nimaging with WFIRST could prove transformative.\nTracing the History of Galaxy Accretion\nAs Kathryn Johnston recently noted in her AAS keynote address, \xe2\x80\x9cStars remember\nwhat gas forgets.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, once a star forms, it can retain an imprint of its\ninitial kinematics for many dynamical times. Moreover, a star\xca\xbcs color and luminosity\nallows it to be associated with a mass, metallicity, and evolutionary state, which in\nturn reveal the star\'s age and chemical enrichment.\nThe power of this approach has been realized most fully in photometric (and\nspectroscopic) studies of the extended halo of M31 (e.g., Guhathakurta et al. 2005;\nIbata et al. 2007; McConnachie et al. 2009). Most recently, the PAndAS survey\n(McConnachie et al. 2009), has mapped red giant and AGB stars in a region\nspanning 300 kpc across M31. The colors of the individual stars allows them to be\ngrouped in metallicity, thereby revealing rich substructure that traces the history of\npast accretion events. Unfortunately, this rich information is currently available for\nonly three galaxies \xe2\x80\x94 M31, M33, and the Milky Way, the latter of which is\ncomplicated by our unique view from within the galaxy \xe2\x80\x94 making is difficult to\nderive generic constraints on the galaxy assembly process. Preliminary data is\navailable within the halos of a larger number of nearby galaxies (Mouhcine, Ibata,\nand Rejkuba 2011; Radburn-Smith et al. 2011), but due to the limited field of view\nof HST, even a dozen sparse pointings sample only a small fraction of a typical\nhalo. Comparable studies cannot be undertaken from the ground, because steeply\nrising galaxy number counts rapidly swamp the population of halo stars, requiring\neffective star-galaxy separation to faint magnitudes.\nThe wide field capabilities of DRM1 or NEW WFIRST have the potential to\nrevolutionize this field. A series of 6 pointings with moderate exposure times\n(equivalent to 2-10 HST orbits) should reveal more than 1 magnitude of the red\ngiant branch out to the virial radius for typical nearby galaxies, of which 100\'s are\nclose enough to employ this technique (see Figure 10). This strategy would allow\nstudies comparable to that in M31 to be carried out for galaxies spanning a nearly\ncomplete range in stellar mass, in a wide range of environments.\nWith a larger investment of time, comparable to typical Treasury programs on\nflagship missions, one could fully map the core of the Virgo cluster (D=16 Mpc),\nmapping the stellar populations in the intracluster light (ICL) across the central 2x2\ndeg2 field (0.5 x 0.5 Mpc2). Detection of individual stars in the ICL has already\nbeen demonstrated for individual pointings with HST (e.g., Williams et al. 2009), but\nscaling to a meaningful area is far beyond the capabilities of current capabilities.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n37\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFully Characterizing the Local Volume\nThere are ~450 galaxies cataloged within 12 Mpc (Karachentsev et al. 2004 \xe2\x80\x93\nCatalog of Neighboring Galaxies), but the majority of them have no observations\nwith HST resolution. They therefore lack secure distance measurements, in spite of\nthe fact that many of these galaxies have been targeted by major flagship\nprograms (SINGS, LVL, GALEX, S4G). Moreover, among the massive galaxies that\ndo have HST observations, most lack sufficient areal coverage to fully characterize\ntheir stellar populations. A targeted key program by the NEW WFIRST could easily\ngenerate the definitive legacy data set on luminous evolving stars within this\nvolume. These constraints on stellar populations would significantly augment the\nastrophysical processes that can be probed with existing multi-wavelength data.\nThe same program could simultaneously measure tip-of-the-red-giant-branch\ndistances, allowing a complete mapping of the flow field across a ~25 Mpc\ndiameter volume.\nCalibrating Models of Luminous Evolving Stars\nThe interpretation of the integrated light of distant galaxies relies on\nspectrophotometric population synthesis models (e.g., Bruzual and Charlot 2003),\nand in turn, on the quality of the stellar models on which these are based. Among\nthe major weaknesses in these models (e.g., binary star evolution, uncertain helium\nand metal-enrichment laws, etc.), the most obvious deficiency is in the description\nof the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. At z = 0, the impact of AGB stars is\nmost pronounced in the near-infrared (NIR), due to their red colors. However, at\nhigher redshifts (z \xe2\x89\xa5 1), where galaxies are younger, AGB stars are more luminous\nand can potentially make up nearly half the luminosity at all restframe optical-toNIR wavelengths (see Maraston et al. 2006; van der Wel et al. 2006). More\nrecently, Dalcanton et al. 2012a and Melbourne et al. 2012 have pointed out the\nequally important role of massive red core Helium burning (RHeB) stars, which can\ncontribute as much light as AGB stars in the NIR. These stars are sufficiently\nmassive that they produce light on even shorter timescales than AGB stars, and\ncan therefore produce rapidly varying NIR mass-to-light ratios.\nDespite this important role, the present-day modeling of AGB and HeB stars is\nembarrassingly primitive and uncertain. The most basic aspects \xe2\x80\x93 the lifetimes and\nluminosities, the colors, the transition from O-rich to C-rich atmospheres for AGB\nstars \xe2\x80\x93 depend directly on processes like rotation, convective overshooting, mass\nloss, and convective \xe2\x80\x9cthird dredge-up\xe2\x80\x9d episodes. These processes are far from\nbeing described by a theory based on first-principles (see e.g., Woitke 2006a,b;\nHerwig 2005), so currently, the best that one can do is assume simple parametric\nlaws, and then calibrate them by means of synthetic models.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n38\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 9: Luminous NIR stellar populations as function of color and magnitude,\ncolor-coded by age for a continuous star formation history. Stars of all ages are\ndetectable with modest exposure times for galaxies within 10-15 Mpc.\nMetallicity variations (not shown) affect the color of the red giant branch (1-13\nGyr), and the structure of the blue and red Helium burning sequences (25-500\nMyr). AGB stars are found brighter than MF160W \xe2\x89\x88 -6.\n\nUnfortunately, there are surprisingly few opportunities to actually calibrate these\nfirst-order models, in spite of their ability to make testable predictions. Because\nthey are rapidly evolving, AGB and HeB stars are intrinsically rare, making them\nchallenging to calibrate in individual clusters. Plenty of constraints can be derived\nfrom the stars in the Magellanic Clouds (extensively sampled by objective prism\nsurveys, 2MASS, OGLE, MACHO, and Spitzer\'s SAGE and S3MC surveys), but\nother observational constraints at both lower and higher metallicities are\ninadequate; indeed, models of AGB stars have been tuned to work for the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n39\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nMagellanic Clouds only. Some progress should be made in the near future with the\nHST survey of M31, but this is only one system, and given the complexity of cool\nstar atmospheres, the effects of chemical composition are expected to be\nsignificant. The limited calibration of these stellar models is therefore likely to be\nthe dominant uncertainty in critical observational studies of galaxy evolution, which\nrely almost entirely on interpreting colors and luminosities of galaxies at high\nredshift. This problem increases in severity as NIR becomes the dominant mode of\nextragalactic imaging (e.g., WFC3/IR, JWST, MCAO).\nWith its wide field of view, NEW WFIRST has the potential to generate orders-of\nmagnitude-increases in existing samples of NIR-bright AGB and HeB stars, thus\nproviding essential calibration data for the rapidly evolving massive stars that\ndominate the light in the NIR. Moreover, a small pilot survey with WFC3/IR\n(Dalcanton et al. 2012) has shown that NIR stellar populations are far richer than\npreviously believed, and thus should be as effective for deriving star formation\nhistories as the better studied optical populations, once models on NIR-bright stars\nare properly calibrated.\n\nFigure 10: Example mapping the extended structure of M101 with a 3-position\npointing of the DRM2 FOV (left). The largest extent of the DRM2 FOV would\ncover a linear extent comparable to that of the PANDAS survey of M31\xca\xbcs halo\nfor galaxies at distances D \xe2\x89\xa5 10 Mpc.\n\n5.5 Extragalactic Programs\n5.5.1 Studying Galaxy Evolution with the Dark Energy Surveys of NEW WFIRST\nGalaxies show remarkable diversity, yet at the same time they exhibit certain\nstrong correlations and obey mysteriously tight scaling relations. Developing a\ndetailed understanding of the physics that shapes observable galaxy properties\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n40\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nwithin the framework of the dark-matter and dark-energy dominated universe\nremains one of the major challenges for astrophysics in the next decades. Large\nsurveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have allowed us to\nexquisitely quantify these correlations for nearby galaxies, and by enabling us to\n"slice and dice" our sample into many bins in galaxy properties and environment,\nthese surveys have provided insight into the physics by teasing out the \xca\xbbmain\ncontrolling variables\xca\xbc from those that are just along for the ride.\nOne of the most profound correlations seen in nearby galaxy populations is that\nbetween galaxies\' spectrophotometric properties (probing their star formation\nhistory) and their structural and morphological} properties. For example, it is well\nknown that early type galaxies locally tend to have more compact light profiles and\nalso have red colors and little recent star formation, while late type, disk dominated\ngalaxies have more extended light profiles and blue colors indicative of their\nongoing star formation. A correlation with galaxy mass and environment is also\nseen, with red early types dominating at high masses and in rich environments, and\nblue late types dominating for lower mass systems and in less dense\nenvironments. SDSS revealed that galaxy mass (or internal density, or velocity\ndispersion) may actually be the more fundamental parameter, with much of the\ntrend between galaxy type and environment coming indirectly from the correlation\nbetween mass and environment (massive galaxies are found preferentially in rich\nenvironments).\nAt high redshift, sub-arcsecond resolution is needed to study the internal structure\nof galaxies, which \xe2\x80\x94 for large samples over large fields \xe2\x80\x94 is only possible from\nspace. In addition, studying galaxies in the rest-optical beyond z ~ 1 requires deep\nnear-IR imaging over large fields, again, only feasible with a space telescope. Early\nresults from Hubble\xca\xbcs WFC3 have revealed that the galaxy population at z > 1.5\nlooks very different from today\'s \xe2\x80\x94 we commonly see extremely clumpy disks,\nultra-compact and massive "red nuggets", and small blue \'tadpole\' galaxies.\nIntriguingly, some of the correlations that are prevalent at z = 0 appear to be\nalready in place at z > 2, namely there is still a strong correlation between specific\nstar formation rate (sSFR) and galaxy structure (with compact galaxies in general\nhaving the lowest sSFRs). However, other correlations have disappeared or even\nreversed \xe2\x80\x94 for example, massive galaxies at z > 2 tend to be actively star-forming\nand disk-dominated. On the flip side, disks with prominent spiral or bar features,\ncommon locally, are extremely rare. There have been claims that the relationship\nbetween star formation rate and large scale environment also reverses at z > 1 (so\nthat objects in denser environments have higher SFR than in the field), but these\nclaims remain controversial, and it is impossible to tease out the \'driving\nparameters\' with current samples.\nThe very large near-IR imaging surveys with NEW WFIRST that are planned for the\nDark Energy program will make it possible to quantify \xe2\x80\x94 over most of the history of\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n41\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\ngalaxies \xe2\x80\x94 correlations between integrated galaxy properties (stellar mass, velocity\ndispersion), galaxy internal structure (size, light profile shape, morphology), and\nlarge scale environment, and to subdivide the samples into many bins in redshift,\nmass, and other quantities, in order to isolate the \xca\xbbdriving parameters.\xca\xbc In order to\nisolate the physical processes responsible for these correlations and to well\npopulate these subdivisions at multiple redshifts, very large galaxy samples (>107)\nare required. In addition, wide fields are needed to collect large enough samples\nover the full range of environment, including even the rare, densest regions and the\nmost under-dense voids. Moreover, the mass-distribution maps via weak lensing\nthat will also be obtained with the survey will provide a unique and presumably\nmore direct probe of the underlying distribution of dark matter, making it possible to\nmap the relationship between the dark matter \xca\xbbscaffolding\xca\xbc and luminous galaxies,\nup to the largest scales. In addition to providing invaluable constraints for galaxy\nformation models and simulations, this is a crucial for cosmological tests, such as\nthe BAO (described Section 5.2.3), which rely on certain assumptions about \xca\xbbbias\xca\xbc\n\xe2\x80\x94 how galaxies trace the underlying density field.\nIn summary, the contribution that the NEW WFIRST wide-field galaxy surveys will\nmake to the study of galaxy evolution is enormous, comparable to the impact the\nSDSS has had on understanding the properties of today\xca\xbcs galaxies.\n5.5.2 Evolution of clusters of Galaxies\nBy imaging over 10,000 galaxy clusters with 0.11 arcsec resolution, including some\nof the most massive clusters in the early (1.5 < z < 3) universe, a NEW WFIRST\nsurvey would greatly enhance our knowledge of the evolution of cosmic structure\nand test competing cosmological models. Studies of high-redshift rich clusters\nhave already begun with HST+WFC3 (see Figure 11); the wide field surveys that\nwould come from NEW WFIRST would vastly expand the power of this approach.\nIn our standard cosmological model, structure formation proceeds from the\nsmallest to the largest units. We believe that stars formed when the universe was\nless than 100 million years old but that another ~100 million years passed before\nthey began to assemble into the first proto-galaxies. Clusters of galaxies, the\nlargest gravitationally bound objects to have formed so far, started to emerge only\n1 Gyr later, and continued to assemble over a broad range in redshifts.\nObservationally, clusters and proto-clusters in formation have now been identified at\n1.5 < z < 4.1 (Miley et al. 2004, 2006; Stanford et al. 2006; Gobat et al. 2010).\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n42\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 11: One of the most distant massive clusters discovered to date at z =\n1.4 with mass Mvir \xe2\x89\x88 8\xef\x82\x961014 M\xef\x82\x80 determined from both lensing and X-ray data.\nThe galaxy population is dominated by old, red spheroids, similar to low redshift\nclusters. The image is a color composite from HST/ACS (i+z), WFC3 (J), and\nVLT Ks, covering 2 arcmin (corresponding to ~1 Mpc) across.\n\nWith evolutionary histories that are highly sensitive to the cosmological parameters\nand the physical processes responsible for structure formation, galaxy clusters are\na sensitive probe for dark energy (DE) evolution and non-canonical cosmologies.\nThe latter point is of great interest: distinguishing a time-varying DE component\nfrom the cosmological constant is one of the most pressing questions in modern\ntheoretical and observational astronomy, with profound implications for\nfundamental physics.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n43\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 12: (top) Cluster Mass Function for the standard \xce\x9bCDM (blue) and a\nproposed Early Dark Energy model (red line). (lower left and right) The\npredicted differential and cumulative number of clusters, respectively, in the two\nscenarios for the NEW WFIRST high latitude survey. CMFs are normalized to\nthe observed cluster abundance at z < 1, and then extrapolated according to\nthe respective cosmological models. A 3,400 deg2 survey area, and a cluster\nmass selection function that scales as the evolution of the characteristic L* (Hband) magnitude, are assumed.\n\nIn this context, massive (M > 1014 M\xef\x82\x80) high-redshift (z > 1) clusters are particularly\nimportant (Jee et al. 2009; Rosati et al. 2009; Brodwin et al. 2010; Mortonson et al.\n2010; Holz & Perlmutter 2012). The reasons are conceptually simple: for instance,\nin Early Dark Energy (EDE) models (Grossi and Springel 2009; Basilakos, Plionis,\nand Lima 2010) the contribution of DE to the total energy density of the universe\ndoes not vanish at high redshift, unlike in standard \xce\x9bCDM models or other simple\nscenarios (such as \xe2\x80\x9cquintessence\xe2\x80\x9d). The presence of a non-negligible DE at z > 2\nwould require accelerated structure formation in order to match the cluster\nabundance observed at z ~ 0. EDE models thus predict that massive clusters form\nsignificantly earlier than they would in a \xce\x9bCDM cosmology (see Figure 12).\nSimilarly, deviations from gaussianity of the primordial density fluctuations would\nlead to an enhanced probability of forming massive collapsed structures at high\nredshifts (Sartoris et al. 2010). As Figure 12 shows, the cluster densities predicted\nby these cosmological models differ most dramatically for massive (> 1014 M\xef\x82\x80)\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n44\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nclusters at z > 1.5. This is precisely the regime NEW WFIRST will have the unique\ncapability of exploring.\nDetecting the intrinsically rare, massive clusters at z > 1.5 is a formidable challenge,\nrequiring large areas of the sky to be surveyed in the NIR at depths sufficient to detect\na significant number of cluster members. A 3,400 deg2 survey to a limiting H-band\nmagnitude of 27 will meet the challenge: by extrapolating the evolution of L* (the\nluminosity of a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d galaxy (De Propris et al. 2010), the NEW WFIRST high-latitude\nsurvey will probe galaxies at least 3 magnitudes fainter than L* in clusters as distant as\nz ~ 2.5, making the clusters \xe2\x80\x9cstand out\xe2\x80\x9d against the sea of more nearby galaxies. (For\ncomparison, even the brightest cluster members in such distant clusters will not be\ndetected by VIKING, the deepest of VISTA\xca\xbcs wide survey.)\nThe NEW WFIRST cluster sample will be a great resource that can be mined for\nfollow-up observations. Lensing, dynamical, and/or Sunyaev\xe2\x80\x93Zel\xca\xbcdovich cluster\nmasses will be measured with JWST, GSMT, and/or future sub-millimeter and Xray facilities; the redshift evolution of the resulting cluster mass function (CMF) will\nprovide sound statistical constraints on cosmological models. In a \xce\x9bCDM scenario,\nof the 10,000 clusters that we expect to detect, only one or two, if any, will be z > 2,\nwhereas 1000 times as many are expected if a non-negligible DE is present at high\nredshifts (Figure 12). For clusters more massive than 5 x 1014 M\xef\x82\x9d, no clusters are\nexpected at z > 2 in the \xce\x9bCDM scenario, but ~130 are expected in the EDE\nscenario (Sartoris et al. 2010).\nWe conclude by pointing out that although NEW WFIRST is unique in its ability to\nidentify massive, distant clusters, it will also detect a multitude of more common,\nless massive clusters, down to 5 x 1013 M\xef\x82\x9d, in the critical range of 1 < z < 3 (i.e., at\na time when the star formation rate peaks). NEW WFIRST will therefore play a\nfundamental role in advancing our understanding, not only of the formation and\nevolution of galaxy clusters (by witnessing cluster assembly and the emergence of\nwell-known scaling properties in clusters), but also of massive early-type galaxies,\nwhich are a fundamental tracer of the mass assembly history of the baryonic matter\nin the universe.\n5.5.3 Co-Evolution of Galaxies and AGN.\nNEW WFIRST will map the co-evolution of galaxies and AGN out to high redshifts,\ncovering the peak epoch of star formation and AGN activity in the universe at 1 < z\n< 2. Bright, unobscured sources will allow for redshift and black hole mass\nmeasurements from their (slitless) grism spectra, while obscured quasars will have\nspectroscopic redshifts (for bright sources) and improved photometric redshifts (for\nfainter sources). NEW WFIRST will enable unprecedented studies of AGN host\ngalaxy properties, including measuring their morphologies as well as their dark\nmatter halo properties from clustering and weak lensing studies. Such analyses will\nbe split by AGN type (e.g., obscured vs. unobscured; luminosity class) as well as\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n45\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nAGN selection method. For instance, recent work, based on samples of\napproximately 300-500 AGN, has shown that while radio-selected AGN tend to\nreside in massive, early-type galaxies, optical and mid-infrared selected quasars\ntend to reside in \xe2\x80\x9cblue cloud\xe2\x80\x9d galaxies, e.g., lower mass, late-type galaxies (Coil et\nal. 2007; Hickox et al. 2009; Griffith and Stern 2010). X-ray selected AGN samples\ntend to straddle these distributions. NEW WFIRST will extend such studies with\nsamples many orders of magnitude larger, allowing evolutionary studies split by\nAGN luminosity.\nClustering and weak-lensing analyses of matched obscured and unobscured\npopulations will allow the study of AGN halo properties and thus test unification\nschemes. The standard torus model (e.g., Urry and Padovani 1995) posits that\norientation is the only parameter that differentiates obscured and unobscured AGN,\nthereby implying identical halo properties. In contrast, dynamical models (e.g.,\nHopkins et al. 2005) posit that the obscuration comes from a post-merger\nevolutionary phase, implying that halo properties could depend on obscuration.\nLarge samples will also allow studies of how obscuration depends on luminosity.\nFor example, the physically motivated \xe2\x80\x9creceding torus model\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., Simpson 2005)\nimplies that higher luminosity quasars impact their obscuring torus, providing more\nsightlines to the central engine, such that the fraction of unobscured quasars\nincreases with increasing AGN luminosity (e.g., Treister et al. 2008; Assef et al.\n2012). NEW WFIRST will provide data sufficient to test these models.\n\n5.6 Studying Cosmic Dawn\nThe three top-level science goals given by the NWNH decadal survey report are\n\xe2\x80\x9cCosmic Dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNew Worlds,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cPhysics of the Universe.\xe2\x80\x9d WFIRST\nalready addresses the Physics of the Universe through its dark energy surveys,\nand New Worlds through its microlensing survey. A NEW WFIRST mission could\ncapably address the central question of Cosmic Dawn, by characterizing the epoch,\nspeed, and inhomogeneity of cosmological reionization, and also characterizing the\nsources responsible for reionization. All of this can be done with the\ninstrumentation planned for the dark energy experiments, and much of it via the\ndark energy surveys and deep field observations that can be incorporated into\nregular calibration efforts.\n5.6.1 Quasars in the Epoch of Reionization\nThe high latitude extragalactic survey will identify unprecedented numbers of\nquasars at very high redshift, probing the epoch(s) of reionization, mapping the first\nstructures to form in the universe, and providing unique probes of the intergalactic\nmedium. Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe,\nobservable to the earliest cosmic epochs. The discovery of a Gunn-Peterson\n(1965) trough in the spectra of several quasars at redshift z > 6 implies that the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n46\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nuniverse completed reionization near that redshift (e.g., Fan et al. 2001), though\npoor sample statistics, the lack of higher redshift quasars, and the coarseness of\nthe Gunn-Peterson test make that inference somewhat uncertain. Currently, the\nmost distant confirmed quasar is at z = 7.1 (Mortlock et al. 2011), and only a dozen\nquasars have been confirmed at z > 6. Ambitious surveys will push this number to\naround 100 in the next few years, likely identifying one or two quasars at z \xe2\x88\xbc 8.\nNEW WFIRST will fundamentally change the landscape of early universe\ninvestigations. Willott et al. (2010) provide the best measurement to date of the\nhigh-redshift quasar luminosity function. Their measurement includes a robust\nsample of quasars at z \xe2\x88\xbc 6 and reasonably extrapolates the decrease in quasar\nspace densities seen at z > 3 to higher redshifts. Using this luminosity function, the\nbaseline wide-area NEW WFIRST survey (10,000 deg2 to AB \xe2\x88\xbc 26) should contain\n3400 quasars at z > 7, 900 at z > 8, 240 at z > 9, 65 at z > 10, and 5 at z > 12\n(albeit with increasing uncertainty at the highest redshifts). If the increased\ncapabilities of the NEW hardware were spent on depth rather than area, instead\nreaching AB \xe2\x88\xbc 26.6 over 3400 deg2, these numbers would drop by a factor of \xe2\x88\xbc 2 at\nall redshifts. For comparison, Euclid is expected to identify 1370 quasars at z > 7\nand 20 quasars at z > 10 using the same luminosity function (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3: The First QSO\xca\xbcs with NEW WFIRST\nArea\n(deg2)\n\nDepth\n(5-sigma, AB)\n\nz>7 QSO\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nz>10 QSO\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nUKIDSS-LAS\n\n4000\n\nKs=20.3\n\n8\n\n-\n\nVISTA-VHS\n\n20,000\n\nH=20.6\n\n40\n\n-\n\nVISTA-VIKING\n\n1500\n\nH=21.5\n\n11\n\n-\n\nVISTA-VIDEO\n\n12\n\nH=24.0\n\n1\n\n-\n\n15,000\n\nH=24.0\n\n1359\n\n22\n\n3400\n\nK=26.0\n\n1304\n\n25\n\n10,000\n\nH=26.0\n\n3440\n\n65\n\nSurvey\n\nEuclid\nWFIRST SDT DRM1\nNEW WFIRST\n\nTable 3: Number of very high-redshift quasars predicted for various groundand space-based near-infrared surveys, based on the quasar luminosity\nfunction of Willott et al. (2010). Note: 6.6% of the Euclid wide survey will have\ntwo or fewer dithered exposures per sky position. Such data will lack the\nredundancy required to robustly identify rare objects, and thus have been\nomitted in the above calculations.\n\nSuch discoveries will directly measure the first epoch of supermassive black hole\nformation in the universe, probe the earliest phases of structure formation, and\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n47\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nprovide unique probes of the intergalactic medium along our line of sight to these\ndistant, luminous sources. The large numbers of quasars identified in the first Gyr\nafter the Big Bang will enable clustering analyses of their spatial distribution (e.g.,\nCoil et al. 2007; Myers et al. 2007), thereby probing the mass of the dark matter\nhalos in which these early sources reside. Spectroscopic follow-up of such a\nsample would yield another probe of reionization by studying the sizes of their\nsurrounding ionized bubbles, or Str\xc3\xb6mgren spheres. Studies of a large sample of\nvery high redshift quasars, rather than the single object studies done to date (e.g.,\nBolton et al. 2011; Mortlock et al. 2011), would allow us to study the \xe2\x80\x9ctopology of\nreionization\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., Furlanetto et al. 2004). Optical surveys are not capable of\nidentifying quasars above z \xe2\x88\xbc 6.5 since their optical light is completely suppressed\nby the redshifted Lyman break and Lyman-\xce\xb1 forests. Though JWST will be\nextremely sensitive at near-infrared wavelengths, it will not survey nearly enough\nsky to find the rarest, most distant, luminous quasars, which have a surface density\nof just a few per 10,000 deg2.\n\nFigure 13: (left, from Glikman et al. 2007) QSO luminosity function (QLF) at z ~\n4, combining data from SDSS (triangles), COSMOS (blue squares; Ikeda et al.\n2011) and the Bootes field (filled red circles; Glikman et al. 2011). Note the\nsimilar faint end slopes but differing normalizations for the latter two. The solid\nline shows the best-fit double power law; parameters listed in lower right. (right,\nfrom Glikman et al. 2011) Keck-LRIS spectra of two faint QSOs at z ~ 4 with\nunusually strong N IV] 1486 emission. This emission line is very rare in bright\nQSO samples such as in the SDSS, but appears in ~9% of faint quasars at z ~\n4 in the study of Glikman et al. (2007).\n\nNEW WFIRST will also uniquely probe the faint end of the quasar luminosity\nfunction (QLF) at high redshift. Such studies are important for understanding the\nsources responsible for reionization, the role of AGN feedback in early galaxy\nformation, as well as the accretion history of black holes in the universe. Recent\nstudies of the faint end of the QLF at z \xe2\x88\xbc 4 have found similar faint end slopes, \xce\xb2 \xe2\x88\xbc\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n48\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x88\x921.6 (e.g., Glikman et al. 2011, Masters et al. 2012), albeit it with different\nnormalizations (Figure 13, left). This work implies that quasars could account for\nabout half the radiation needed to ionize the intergalactic medium at this redshift.\nWork to date also suggests that new AGN populations appear at the faint end of\nthe QLF. Specifically, Glikman et al. (2007) found unusually strong NIV] 1486\nemission in \xe2\x88\xbc9% of their faint z \xe2\x88\xbc 4 quasars (Figure 13, right). Though not\nunprecedented, NIV] 1486 emission is extremely rare in the SDSS quasar sample\n(e.g., Bentz et al. 2004). The Lynx arc, at z = 3.357, has this same emission line,\ninterpreted by Fosbury et al. (2003) as being powered by photoionization by very\nmassive young stars and a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF; e.g., dominated by\nmassive stars). This suggests an early co-evolution of galaxies and their\nsupermassive black holes.\nFinding both the brightest quasars at the highest redshifts as well as lower\nluminosity quasars over a wide range of redshifts, NEW WFIRST will be the\ndefinitive probe of the early phase of supermassive black hole growth in the\nuniverse.\n5.6.2 Finding Gravitationally Lensed Galaxies to Probe the Early Universe\nBy imaging ~3,400 deg2 to depth of 27.5 AB mag in 4 NIR passbands, the NEW\nWFIRST high-latitude survey will potentially contain more than 300,000 z > 9\ngalaxies in the field and more than 5,000 highly magnified z > 9 galaxies behind\nstrongly lensing clusters. A complementary IR survey to 26 AB mag at wavelengths\nlonger than 2\xc2\xb5m will be required to unambiguously measure the photometric\nredshifts of these very young galaxies. The large number of such objects identified\nby the NEW WFIRST telescope will provide stringent constraints on the early star\nformation rate density and on the nature of the sources responsible for re-ionization\nof the universe.\nMapping the formation of cosmic structure in the first 1 billion years after the Big\nBang is essential for achieving a comprehensive understanding of star and galaxy\nformation. Little is known about this critical epoch when the first galaxies formed.\nDetermining the abundance and properties of such early objects is critical in order\nto understand (1) how the first galaxies were formed through a hierarchical merging\nprocess; (2) how the chemical elements were generated and redistributed through\nthe galaxies; (3) how the central black holes exerted influence over the galaxy\nformation; and (4) how these objects contributed to the end of the \xe2\x80\x9cdark ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n49\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 14: A candidate for a galaxy at z = 9.6, magnified by a factor of ~15 by\nthe foreground cluster MACS J1149+2223 (z = 0.54). The object was found in\nan HST survey using the WFC3IR camera (Zheng et al. 2012). This young\nobject is seen when the universe is only ~500 million years old.\n\nFinding candidate z > 7 galaxies has been pursued in two ways \xe2\x80\x94 from moderate\narea but very deep imaging surveys (e.g., UDF, Subaru Deep Field, CANDELS)\nand from images of strongly lensing clusters of galaxies (e.g., Bradley et al. 2008;\nPostman et al. 2012). Recent observations have identified at least 3 candidate\nobjects at z > 9 (Bouwens et al. 2011a; Zheng et al. 2012; Coe et al. 2012). Two of\nthese candidates were found in a survey of massive galaxy clusters. One of the\nlensed candidates is shown in Figure 14. While unlensed sources at these redshifts\nare expected to be extremely faint, with total AB magnitudes greater than 28,\nlensed sources can be 10 \xe2\x80\x93 30 times brighter. This is particularly important\nbecause it puts some of these sources within the reach of the spectrographs on the\nJames Webb Space Telescope and from very large ground-based telescopes.\nLuminous z > 7 galaxies are extremely valuable as their spectra can be used to\ndetermine the epoch of the IGM reionization. This is because only a tiny fraction of\nneutral hydrogen is needed to produce the high opacity of Ly\xce\xb1 observed at z \xe2\x88\xbc 6.\nThe damped Ly\xce\xb1 absorption profile that results from a completely neutral IGM\n(Miralda-Escude 1998) can be measured even at low-spectral resolution.\nFurthermore, direct measurements of the early star formation rate (via Ly\xce\xb1 and H\xce\xb1\nemission, Iye et al. 2006) can be derived from the spectra of bright high-z galaxies.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n50\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 15: The cumulative number of lensed and unlensed z = 8, 10, and 11\ngalaxies predicted in the NEW WFIRST HLS. Darker curves correspond to the\nlensed number counts. Lensing is advantageous primarily for finding bright (H <\n25.5 AB mag) z > 9 sources. The unlensed field will produce an overall higher\nnumber of z > 8 sources, however.\n\nThe high-latitude survey (HLS) performed by the NEW WFIRST telescope as part\nof its weak lensing program will also be superb for finding and studying objects in\nthe early universe. A key advantage that a 2.4 meter aperture provides is that, in\nthe same amount of time, the NEW WFIRST HLS will reach 1.5 magnitudes fainter\nthan the corresponding DRM2 HLS. The final 5-sigma limiting depth of the NEW\nWFIRST HLS is estimated to be H = 27.5 AB mag. Figure 15 shows the predicted\nnumber of z = 8, 10, and 11 objects that would be found as a function of limiting Hband magnitude for both gravitationally-lensed and unlensed regions in a 3,440\ndeg2 survey. The predicted number at z = 8 is constrained by the BoRG survey z ~\n8 luminosity function results (Bradley et al. 2012). The predicted counts for z = 10\nand z = 11 sources are based on extrapolations of the z = 8 results, assuming that\nthe characteristic magnitude of galaxies evolves as dM*/dz = +0.46. The lensed\nsource count predictions assume ~1 strongly lensing cluster per square degree.\nThe mass models were adopted from the CLASH Multi-cycle treasury program\n(Postman et al. 2012). Figure 16 shows the observed SED of the z = 9.6 candidate\nfrom Zheng et al. (2012). Reaching a limiting magnitude of H = 27.5 makes a\nsignificant improvement in the ability to detect such sources.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n51\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nA sample of upwards of 5,000 luminous lensed galaxies will place very stringent\nlimits on the star-formation-rate density, on the amount of ionizing radiation per unit\nvolume, and on the physical properties of early galactic structures. An NRO\ntelescope\xca\xbcs 0.1 \xe2\x80\x93 0.2 arcsecond resolution, combined with lens magnifications in\nthe 10 \xe2\x80\x93 30 range, will allow the mapping of structures on scales of 20 to 50\nparsecs, thanks to the boost in spatial resolution provided by the cluster lenses.\nSuch a survey will certainly herald a remarkable era in probing the first 1 billion\nyears of cosmic history.\n\nFigure 16: The observed (blue points, open triangles) and best-fit (black curve)\nSEDs for the z = 9.6 galaxy in MACS J1149+2223.\n\n5.6.3 Ly\xce\xb1 emitters as probes of reionization\nLy\xce\xb1 lines from high redshift galaxies should be suppressed when these galaxies\nare surrounded by neutral inter-galactic medium (IGM), due to resonant scattering\nof the Ly\xce\xb1 photons by neutral hydrogen. After accounting for galactic winds, ionized\nbubbles around galaxies, and other mitigating factors, it is still expected that Ly\xce\xb1\nline emission is suppressed by a factor of three or more (e.g., Santos 2004) for an\nIGM that is ~50% neutral. The simplest test involving Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies is to compare\nthe luminosity functions of Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies before and after the redshift of reionization\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n52\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n(e.g., Malhotra & Rhoads 2004; Stern et al. 2005). Recent data indicate a less than\n10% neutral fraction at z = 6.5 (Ouchi et al. 2010). This is a local test of whether\nthe IGM is neutral at the 10-50% level. It thus complements the more global CMB\npolarization tests, and the Gunn-Peterson test, which probes lower neutral fractions\n(~1%).\nHigher order tests of reionization measure clustering of Ly\xce\xb1 sources (e.g.,\nFurlanetto et al. 2006; McQuinn et al. 2007). In the intermediate phases of\nreionization, when the ionized bubbles have not yet overlapped, Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies\nshould show enhanced angular clustering. This test has the advantage of being\ninsensitive to number or luminosity evolution of the Ly\xce\xb1 galaxy population. It also\ngives extra information about the preferred scale of ionized bubbles. NEW\nWFIRST, with its NIR coverage and wide-field spectroscopy, can measure the\nluminosity function of Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies between redshifts z = 6 \xe2\x80\x93 12. It has a\ntremendous advantage in NIR sensitivity over ground-based instruments, which are\nhampered by the earth\'s atmosphere. It wins over JWST by its FOV, which is 150\nand 268 times the area covered by NIRSPEC and NIRISS. It wins over Euclid by\nhaving 4 times the aperture.\n\nFigure 17: Number of Ly\xce\xb1 emitting galaxies that would be expected in an NEW\nWFIRST \xe2\x80\x9cCosmic Dawn\xe2\x80\x9d field. The numbers are based on the z = 6.5 Ly\xce\xb1\nluminosity function from Ouchi et al. (2010), together with an assumed grism\nsensitivity limit of 5x10-18 erg cm-2 s-1. Reionization would be manifested as a\nbreak in the number-redshift curve near the redshift where the neutral fraction\nexceeds 50%. Also shown, for comparison, is an approximation of the current\nobservational situation in 2012, where we have a sample of about 5 known Ly\xce\xb1\nemitting galaxies at 7 < z < 8, and no robust detections beyond that.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n53\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nWe now consider a strawman reionization test using Ly-\xce\xb1 emitters. To get the best\nstatistics, one needs to get deep enough to reach L* in the Ly\xce\xb1 luminosity function.\nAt redshift z = 8.5, that implies a sensitivity to 5x10-18 ergs cm-2 s-1. A 106 s\nexposure with the slitless spectrograph should be sufficient to reach that level\n(scaling from Euclid sensitivities). With that we should be able to observe 900 Ly\xce\xb1\nemitters per square degree per unit redshift at z ~ 8.5 (see Figure 17), and about\n3000 from z = 7 \xe2\x80\x93 12. Three NEW WFIRST fields distributed over the sky would\nsuffice. These could, for example, be fields that are visited for short exposures\nperiodically in order to keep track of absolute calibration drift over time. These\nstatistics and areal coverage should be sufficient to apply the clustering test.\n\nFigure 18: Excerpt from a cosmological simulation of Ly\xce\xb1 galaxy formation and\ngrowth (Tilvi et al. 2009). The field plotted corresponds approximately to 38\xca\xbc x\n18\xca\xbc of sky coverage for the simulated redshift (z = 6.5) and cosmology (h=0.72).\nRed dots show the location of collapsed dark matter halos, and blue dots those\nthat currently host a Ly\xce\xb1 emitting galaxy. Field sizes of deep near-IR survey\ninstruments are overplotted: WFC3-IR on HST (2.3\xca\xbcx2.3\xca\xbc); NIRCAM on JWST\n(4.6\xca\xbc x 2.3\xca\xbc); and FourStar on the 6.5m Magellan telescopes (11\xca\xbc x 11\xca\xbc. Two\nadjacent NIRCAM fields are shown to illustrate the potential impact of field-tofield variations: One contains no Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies, the other, about 15. The larger\nFourStar field of view provides some robustness to local density variations, but\nlacks the depth offered by space-based near-IR imaging. The field of the\nnominal NEW WFIRST instrument is not marked, being about 1.5 times larger\nthan the entire plotted area.\n\nSlitless spectroscopy enables a uniform and unbiased search for both Ly\xce\xb1 emitters\nand Lyman break galaxies at the redshifts where the Ly\xce\xb1 line or break (1216 \xc3\x85) lies\nin the wavelength coverage, with no pre-selection on color, etc. Also, the area\ncovered by even three deep NEW WFIRST fields gives a robust statistical sample\nof high-redshift galaxies, on scales sufficient to avoid strong cosmic variance\neffects. Figure 18 shows Ly\xce\xb1 galaxies in a cosmological simulation by Tilvi et al.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n54\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n(2009). The area of WFIRST (0.375 deg2 = 119 cMpc at z=8 on the side) samples\na range of regimes at that redshift. The smallest ionized bubble that will allow Ly\xce\xb1\nto escape is about 1 pMpc (Malhotra and Rhoads 2006), and the bubble size\ndistribution should peak at about 1.5 pMpc (Furlanetto et al. 2004). Thus, a single\nfield of view of WFIRST will contain several hundred bubbles between z = 7.5 \xe2\x80\x93\n8.5, assuming an ionized fraction around 50%.\n\nFigure 19: Reionization history\xe2\x80\x94 the IGM neutral fraction as a function of\nredshift, as constrained by several present and future methods.\nThe\nmeasurements at z < 6 and lower limit at z = 6.0 come from quasar GunnPeterson test results (Becker et al. 2004, Fan et al. 2006). Ly\xce\xb1 emission\nstudies provide complementary upper limits at 5.7 < z < 7 (RM01: Rhoads and\nMalhotra 2001, MR04: Malhotra and Rhoads 2004; St05: Stern et al. 2005;\nOu10: Ouchi et al 2010; Ka11: Kashikawa et al. 2011). Ly\xce\xb1 equivalent width\nstudies (Sch11: Schenker et al. 2011; Ono11: Ono et al. 2011; P11: Pentericci\net al. 2011) and the near zone studies of the z=7.08 quasar (Mo11: Mortlock et\nal. 2011; B11: Bolton et al 2011) provide recent evidence for neutral gas at z=7,\nas do some Ly\xce\xb1 searches (Iye et al. 2006). At higher redshift, microwave\nbackground polarization (Komatsu et al. 2010) gives an integral constraint on\nthe free electron column density and tells us that the neutral fraction was about\n50% somewhere between z = 9 and 11.5. Ly\xce\xb1 studies using NEW WFIRST will\nprobe this range of neutral fractions and redshifts, enabling us to pin down the\nhistory of reionization at the crucial epoch and in great detail. They will provide\na crucial second method to compare with future 21cm radio studies, which are\na very promising method but whose application depends on successful\nmitigation of extremely bright foreground signals.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n55\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nThe role of WFIRST in Ly\xce\xb1 based reionization tests is summarized in the context of\nour present knowledge in Figure 19. Such tests could be accomplished within the\nNEW WFIRST wide area survey, provided that 1-2% of the total survey time is\nspent revisiting about 1 deg2 of calibration fields. The benefit of such fields to the\nwide area survey would be long term monitoring of slitless spectroscopy\nperformance, which would help with the calibration and data uniformity required for\nprecision cosmology. If such repeated fields are not ultimately included in the dark\nenergy surveys, the reionization science could be done through a dedicated\nprogram on the scale of 1 or 2 x 106 s. In other words, we could determine the\nhistory of reionization for an investment of telescope time comparable to the\nHubble Ultra Deep Field or a similar treasury-scale HST GO program.\n5.6.4 Lyman break galaxy samples from WFIRST\nNEW WFIRST can offer an essentially complete census of Lyman break galaxies\nat redshift z = 8. Consider the combined data from the full supernova survey, as\ndescribed above. Six square degrees, three filters, and an aggregate 0.45 years of\ntelescope time translates to just under 300 ksec of integration time per field per\nfilter. Scaling from z = 8 Lyman break studies by Bouwens et al. (2011), based on\nWFC3-IR data, this should achieve 5\xcf\x83 sensitivities of 30.3 AB magnitude, while L*\nis between 27 and 28 mag. Presuming clean selection of LBGs down to a 10\xcf\x83 flux\nlevel, the Bouwens et al. LF suggests that 6 deg2 should include about 105 Lyman\nbreak galaxies per unit redshift around z = 8 \xe2\x80\x93 9. With such large numbers,\nestimates of the ionizing photon production enter the \xe2\x80\x9csystematic dominated\xe2\x80\x9d\nregime, where uncertainties in the ionizing photon production (due to incomplete\nknowledge of stellar populations), the extrapolation of the luminosity function to\nfainter levels, and the ionizing photon escape fraction become dominant. While\nprogress on some of these issues may require JWST follow-up spectroscopy,\nsome may be partially addressed using NEW WFIRST itself, if deep spectroscopy\naccompanies the supernova imaging program. The inclusion of a filter wheel with\nfilters beyond the basic Y-J-H trio could also provide for more flexible Lyman break\nsurveys. In particular, inclusion of a deep Ks imaging capability would allow the Jdrop Lyman break galaxies to be confidently selected.\nIf NEW WFIRST were to search for supernovae through spectroscopic monitoring,\nusing an R ~ 75 slitless grism, the aggregate deep field data would yield\nspectroscopic Lyman break confirmations for about 3000 galaxies down to AB = 27\nover 6 deg2. For reasonable assumptions, the most distant confirmations from\nsuch a spectroscopic survey might be as distant as z = 12 (conservatively) to 14\n(optimistically).\nThe above Lyman break sample numbers come for free with the dark energy\nsupernova survey. If considered as a GO program, a more modest survey area (1\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n56\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\ndeg2) and depth (29 mag AB) would be achievable in 250 ksec of telescope time,\ncorresponding to a medium-sized HST GO program, and would yield a sample of\norder 2000 Lyman break galaxies at z ~ 8.\n5.6.5 Gamma Ray Burst Afterglows\nFinally, NEW WFIRST could address reionization science through Target-ofOpportunity follow-up of high redshift gamma ray burst afterglows. Spectra of GRB\nafterglows prior to reionization will show the damping wing of Ly\xce\xb1 absorption from\nthe surrounding neutral IGM (e.g., Totani et al. 2006; Mesinger and Furlanetto\n2008). Sensitive IR spectroscopy at R ~ 600, unimpeded by Earth\xca\xbcs atmosphere,\nshould detect this signature. The main issues to consider will be (a) response time,\n(b) field of regard, and (c) availability of events.\n\n5.7 Summary: How does NEW WFIRST stack up compared to SDT DRM1?\nWFIRST as envisioned in NWNH was anchored by two core programs. However,\nthe NWNH stressed that the wealth of data for general astrophysics programs\nfrom the dark energy surveys and GO-led surveys, and from GO targeted\nobservations, were the most important components of the WFIRST scientific\nprogram. The above discussion has made clear that, at this early stage of\nanalysis, NEW WFIRST will perform the dark energy surveys and the microlensing\nplanet search planned for SDT DRM1 at an equivalent and in most cases superior\nlevel. Particularly in the case of the dark energy program, \xe2\x80\x9cknown-unknown\xe2\x80\x9d\nissues, most notably the stability and degree-of-knowledge of the PSF, are crucial\nto the success of the weak-lensing program, and these matters will require\nconsiderable development and understanding of the NEW WFIRST system. This,\nand the photometric stability issue discussed above for the supernova program,\nare the only potential barriers that would challenge the ability of NEW WFIRST to\nmeet or exceed the performance of the SDT DRM1 in the two core programs.\nWe have many few examples of the kinds of GO science, including surveys and\npointed observations, that demonstrate the breadth of exciting, science that either\nthe SDT DRM1 or NEW WFIRST could achieve, greatly beyond the capability of\nany existing or planned facility. These examples are but a taste of the contribution\nNEW WFIRST could make, over and above the DRM1 design. This is because\nthe increased aperture and sharper PSF take this version of WFIRST into the\nHubble regime, that is, the power of a 2.4m diffraction-limited space telescope.\nHST is arguably the most successful science tool in history. When one considers\nhow much imaging alone contributed to the wealth of Hubble science, and how a\nfactor of 100 increase in field size \xe2\x80\x94 such as NRO realization of WFIRST provides\n\xe2\x80\x94 can open the door to programs even Hubble couldn\xca\xbct accomplish, it is clear that\nNEW WFIRST has the potential to be a facility that can be placed in the same\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n57\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nclass as the Hubble Space Telescope, something that would be unprecedented for\nan investment of this size.\n\n6.0 Value Added: Direct-imaging Exoplanet Science with NEW WFIRST\n6.1 Overview\nIn addition to dark energy, NWNH placed a high priority on Exoplanet discovery\nand characterization. The growth in interest and the rate of discoveries in the\nexoplanet field has been explosive over the last decade. Although gravitational\nmicrolensing with the NRO telescope offers the potential for a significant statistical\ncharacterization of exoplanet populations, that technique measures only planet\nmasses and orbital parameters, not their composition. However, unlike the\nbaseline WFIRST, the NEW WFIRST could also be equipped to directly detect\nnearby exoplanets, resolving them from their parent star, allowing for spectroscopic\ncharacterization that can provide unique insights into planetary properties, history,\nand formation. The power of this technique has recently been shown by extensive\nstudies of the young giant planets in the HR8799 system (see Figure 20).\n\nFigure 20: Near-infrared image of four giant planets orbiting the young star\nHR8799, taken with the Keck adaptive optics system (Marois et al. 2010).\n\nAlthough a NEW WFIRST coronagraph would be less capable than one on an\noptimized mission with a 2.4m aperture, advances in technology would give it\norders of magnitude more sensitivity than any instruments on HST, and it would be\nan important complement to ground-based facilities. This would have significant\nscientific value, particularly if the instrument meets at least one of the following\nrequirements \xe2\x80\x94 sensitivity to planet-to-star contrast ratios of 10-9, a near-infrared\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n58\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nchannel for studying self-luminous planets, and/or a moderate resolution combined\ncoronagraph/spectrometer. It would also serve to demonstrate the technology for\nfuture missions that would one day detect and characterize Earthlike planets.\n\n6.2 High-Contrast Imaging Technology\nWhile the NRO telescopes were originally designed for wide-field applications, and\nthe WFIRST science is enabled by that capability, and NRO telescope also make\nan excellent platform for including a narrow-field camera (and potentially a\nspectrometer). The telescope\'s reported performance of 60 nm RMS wavefront\nerror suggests that an instrument could be diffraction-limited for wavelengths longer\nthan 840 nm (using the rule of thumb that diffraction-limited imaging requires \xce\xbb/14\nRMS wavefront error). The performance at the on-axis field point is likely to be\nbetter than 60 nm, allowing for diffraction-limited imaging at shorter wavelengths\nwith a narrow-field on-axis instrument. In addition, correction of the static\nwavefront error at the on-axis field point could be carried out using one or more\ndeformable mirrors if necessary, further improving the performance of an on-axis\nimager.\nFurthermore, any wide-field instruments designed for the system are likely to be\noff-axis in field angle (such as the designs presented in Section 4). These designs\nleave room for a pickoff mirror at the on-axis field point, in the image plane of the\ntwo-mirror telescope. Three reflections (the primary, secondary, and the pickoff)\nwould be needed to direct the beam into a narrow-field imager. The volume\navailable for instruments is large enough to accommodate multiple instruments.\nThis opens up the possibility of including a coronagraph with wavefront control, or\nunder certain restrictions, flying an accompanying occulter, to perform high-contrast\nimaging. While cost and volume may dictate only a single narrow-band channel,\nsignificant science results and technological development could be achieved. In\nthis section we summarize the state of technology and the feasibility of using the\ntelescope for high-contrast imaging.\n6.2.1 Coronagraph Technology\nGreat advances have been made over the last decade in coronagraph design and\nwavefront control for high-contrast imaging. There are numerous designs proposed\neach with different advantages and disadvantages and performance spaces.\nThere are also at least three active laboratories studying wavefront control for highcontrast space-based applications (the high-contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the high-contrast imaging laboratory (HCIL) at\nPrinceton, and the NASA Ames Testbed). Contrasts as high as a few times 10-10\nhave been achieved at JPL in 10% broadband light. Numerous concepts were\nsubmitted to the last decadal survey using telescopes of similar apertures to the\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n59\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nNRO telescope that utilized coronagraphs to image and characterize earth-sized\nexoplanets around the nearest stars. NEW WFIRST provides a unique opportunity\nto advance the technology for coronagraphic imaging and achieve unique science\nby including a narrow field coronagraph. Not only could interesting science be\naccomplished, but testing components and algorithms is a crucial step toward a\nfuture large flagship exoplanet mission.\nThe NRO telescope does present some unique challenges to implementing a\ncoronagraph. In particular, because of the central obscuration and the six\nsupporting struts, it possesses a complicated pupil geometry that rules out many of\nthe standard coronagraphs. Fortunately, much progress has been made in the last\nfew years on developing coronagraphs for on-axis telescopes. These include new\nshaped pupil designs that incorporate central obstructions and spiders, new Lyot\napproaches with phase varying pupil stops for masking out the secondary, the new\nPIAA-CMC that uses an achromatic focal plane mask, and the Visible Nulling\nCoronagraph (VNC) that can mask out the central obstruction and segments by\ncareful control of the pupil shear.\n\nFigure 21: A shaped pupil (left) designed for a pupil similar to the NRO\ntelescope with central obstruction and (right) the corresponding high-contrast\npoint spread function. Dark holes are 10-8 contrast with an inner working angle\nof 3 \xce\xbb/D (0.2 arcsec at 800 nm) and an outer working angle of 21 \xce\xbb/D.\n\nFor illustration, Figure 21 shows a shaped pupil designed for a pupil similar to the\nNRO telescope pupil that generates two dark holes with an inner working angle of 3\n\xce\xbb/D, an outer working angle of 21 \xce\xbb/D, 23% throughput, and a contrast of 10-8.\nOther designs are also possible with higher (or lower) contrast and smaller inner\nworking angles that trade with the size of the discovery space and the system\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n60\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nthroughput. Similar masks to these have been manufactured and verified in the\nlaboratory, demonstrating the maturity of the technology for on-axis telescopes.\nFigure 22 shows a dark hole formed using a shaped pupil mask at HCIT,\ndemonstrating the maturity of wavefront control.\nThe mask was used in\nconjunction with a wavefront control system to reduce scatter in the dark hole to a\ncontrast of 2.4x10-9 in a 10% optical bandwidth (Belikov et al. 2007).\nIt is also possible to modify the shaped pupil mask to directly account for measured\nphase errors in the telescope. For instance, Carolotti et al. (2012) show how a\nmask was designed for JWST that created a single-sided dark hole in the presence\nof the nominal phase error without any wavefront correction. This sort of unified\ndesign approach ensures that it is possible to combine wavefront control with\nexisting deformable mirror technology with the wavefront quality of the NRO\ntelescope \xe2\x80\x9cas is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFigure 22: The dark trapezoidal region on the right side of the image is a dark\nhole formed in a laboratory testbed.\n\nThe largest unknown affecting the achievable contrast is the expected stability of\nthe telescope. Because of the long integration times needed to perform correction,\nthe telescope needs to be stable during the several hours that might be necessary\nto take an image. For very high-contrast (10-9 or better) this can place extremely\ntaxing requirements on telescope stability. Fortunately, the NRO telescope is\nequipped for active thermal control and active control of the secondary which may\nmake contrasts up to 10-8 or better possible, though 10-10 is likely impossible. This\nneeds to be studied carefully. However, it is important to note that placing a\ncoronagraph on NEW WFIRST provides an unparalleled opportunity to study\ncoronagraph performance in space and gain direct knowledge regarding the\ninteraction of the telescope short- and long-term stability with achievable contrast.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n61\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n6.2.2 Occulters\nAn occulter mission employs a large free-flying starshade to block the light of the\nparent star from the telescope. This is an attractive alternative to coronagraphs for\nhigh-contrast science in space. Their biggest advantage is that they provide the\nhigh-contrast starlight rejection so that a conventional telescope \xe2\x80\x94 without\nespecially challenging stability or optical quality requirements \xe2\x80\x94 can image\nexoplanets. Further, occulters decouple the angular resolution from telescope size:\neven with a 2.4m telescope, very small inner working angles can be achieved and\na sizeable number of Earthlike planets could be discovered. The telescope\ninstrumentation consists only of a simple camera (and possibly a spectrograph).\nSince no starlight enters the telescope, no sophisticated wavefront control system\nis needed. Figure 23 shows the precision petal that was recently completed at JPL.\nThis petal is consistent with star to planet contrast of 10-10 (Kasdin et al. 2012).\n\nFigure 23: Full scale precision starshade. The overall shape is consistent with\n10-10 imaging. The petal includes the precision optical edge but is missing the\nnon-structural opaque blanket.\n\nOf course, these advantages come at a cost. A separate spacecraft for the\nstarshade is needed that would likely cost many hundreds of millions of dollars.\nMore importantly, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to architect an occulter\nmission in Earth orbit. Avoiding interference from the Sun, Earth and Moon make\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n62\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nfinding geometrically favorable viewing angles challenging and the large gravity\ngradient makes \xca\xbbstationkeeping\xca\xbc difficult and costly with existing thrusters. One\ncould consider a NEW WFIRST mission as an opportunity to do technology\nverification of the deployment and stationkeeping of an occulter, but the more\nchallenging environment in Earth orbit may make this less representative of a real\nmission and the cost may be too high for a mission with little or no science. For a\nreasonable science return, an occulter mission should be in deep space, either\nEarth-trailing or an L2 orbit, possibly too costly for the first NRO telescope. Of\ncourse, if the telescope is flown at L2 for other scientific reasons, then a follow-on\nmission in which an occulter flies into formation with the telescope should be\nseriously considered, as it would be capable of achieving the very high contrast\nand small inner working angle needed to image exo-earths.\n\n6.3 Potential Science with an NRO Coronagraph\n6.3.1 Extrasolar planets\nWe estimate that a NEW WFIRST coronagraph could conservatively achieve a\ndetectable planet:star contrast of 10-8 with an optimistic bound of 10-9 at an inner\nworking angle of ~0.2 arcsec. For comparison, the contrast between Earth and the\nsun is ~10-10; terrestrial planets would be beyond the reach of any plausible NRO\ntelescope capability. However, a NEW WFIRST coronagraph would have\nsignificant capability to detect and characterize giant planets \xe2\x80\x94 photometrically or\nspectroscopically. These techniques will be most powerful for planets 1-10 AU from\ntheir parent star, a region of phase space almost inaccessible to transits.\nCharacterization is especially valuable. The massive statistical harvest from Kepler\nand Doppler techniques provides a robust census of planets within 1 AU of their\nparent star, but very little information about their nature \xe2\x80\x94 for example, are rocky\nplanets common, or are most planets ice and hydrogen? Different models of planet\nformation make different predictions about the nature of other solar systems.\nStudying the distribution of giant planets across the \xe2\x80\x9csnow line\xe2\x80\x9d at 3 AU, and their\ncomposition, will provide a unique window into the planet formation process.\nGround-based, high-contrast facilities such as the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI,\nMacintosh et al. 2012) and its ESO counterpart Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast\nExoplanet Research instrument (SPHERE. Beuzit et al. 2010) will of course also\nhelp with this puzzle, but NEW WFIRST would be highly competitive, particularly if\nit can reach a contrast of 10-9 \xe2\x80\x94 GPI and SPHERE achieve contrasts of only 10-7 to\n10-6 on typical targets. To detect giant planets, these instruments observe at nearIR wavelengths, where young (< 500 Myr) giant planets remain detectable from\nthermal radiation of their initial energy of formation. GPI and SPHERE have very\nlimited sensitivity at shorter wavelengths and are essentially blind to mature solar\nsystems such as our own. A coronagraph on NEW WFIRST could see exoplanets\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n63\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nof any age, allowing us to study their evolution over periods similar to the age of our\nsolar system. For systems detected by both NRO and GPI, the availability of\nphotometry at visible wavelengths and at near-infrared wavelengths inaccessible\nfrom the ground (e.g., water absorption lines) will help strongly constrain the\nplanet\xca\xbcs properties, such as radius and atmospheric composition, placing it on\nevolutionary tracks that in turn allow determination of its formation process (e.g.,\nFortney et al. 2008). Self-luminous planet detection such as by GPI also strongly\nbiases the sample to higher mass; NEW WFIRST would be capable in some\ncircumstances of directly imaging Neptune-mass planets.\nNRO 2.4m 3 /D 1e-9\n\nGPI 600-star survey\n\n1\n0.1\n\n1.0\n10.0\nSemi-major axis (AU)\n\n100\n\n200\n100\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n10\n5\n\n2\n1\n\nHZ\n\n1\n\n100.0\n\n0.1\n\nSnow line\n\nHZ\n\n1000\n\n1000\n500\n\nMass ME\n\n20\n10\n5\nSnow line\n\n100\n\n200\n100\n50\n\n10\n\nMass ME\n\n1000\n\n1000\n500\n\n1.0\n10.0\nSemi-major axis (AU)\n\n2\n1\n\n100.0\n\nFigure 24: Sensitivity comparison between a 2.4m space coronagraph and the\nGemini Planet Imager for a notional survey of nearby stars with mass 0.5-1.5\nsolar masses. The quantity plotted is the ExoPTF \xe2\x80\x9cdepth of search\xe2\x80\x9d (Lunine et\nal. 2008). This is the sum of the completeness of a survey for all targets \xe2\x80\x94 it\ncan be thought of as the number of planets of a given mass and semi-major\naxis that would be discovered if all targets had such a companion. GPI has a\nmuch larger potential target sample, but since it detects self-luminous planets,\nwhose brightness declines steeply with mass and age and it is only sensitive to\nhigh-mass planets.\n\nFigure 24 shows the science reach of an NRO coronagraph capable of achieving\n10-9 contrast \xe2\x80\x93 roughly sufficient to detect a Jupiter analog. Poorer performance\n(such as a contrast of only 10-8) would significantly restrict the ability to detect\nmature planets. However, this could be mitigated by including a near-infrared\ncoronagraph channel that could detect younger self-luminous planets. Finally, since\nspectroscopic characterization of even a small number of planets is very valuable,\na coronagraphic moderate-resolution spectroscopic capability would provide unique\ninsights into planetary composition and formation history.\nJWST will also incorporate coronagraphic capabilities, but the design of these, and\nthe uncorrected aberrations on JWST\xca\xbcs mirror segments, limits their performance.\nJWST, however, can observe at longer IR wavelengths where thermal emission\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n64\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nfrom giant planets is strong. High-performance visible-light coronagraphy with the\nNEW WFIRST telescope, when combined with near-IR on the ground and mid-IR\non JWST, would be an extremely powerful combination for completely\ncharacterizing nearby giant planets.\n6.3.2 Circumstellar dust\n\xe2\x80\x93 20 \xe2\x80\x93\n\nPlanets are of course not the only component of other solar systems; seen from\noutside, the brightest thing in our solar system (after the Sun) is not Jupiter but the\ndisk of zodiacal dust, remnants of comets and asteroids in the inner solar system.\n\n10\xe2\x88\x923\nWISE\n\nLdust/Lstar\n\n10\xe2\x88\x924\n\n10\xe2\x88\x925\n\nSpitzer / IRS\nKIN\n\nJWST / MIRI\nSpitzer / MIPS\nLBTI\n\nHerschel / PACS\n\n10\xe2\x88\x926\n\n10\xe2\x88\x927\n10\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nALMA\n\nKuiper belt dust\n\n100\nTdust (K)\n\nZodiacal dust\n\n1000\n\nFig. 3.\xe2\x80\x94 Sensitivity limits for detection of debris dust around nearby Sun-like stars, for various\n\nFigure (Spitzer, WISE), current (KIN, of Roberge near-term facilities (LBTI, JWST, ALMA). for\nSensitivity limits\nrecent 25: Taken from Fig. 3 Herschel) and et al.

If the dust disk is massive, however, the starlight it scatters may obscure\notherwise-detectable planets. Simulations show that a disk 5-10 times the\nbrightness of our own would significantly decrease the ability of a future flagship\nmission to detect and characterize habitable planets. This is a major source of\nplanning uncertainty for such missions \xe2\x80\x93 the actual amount of zodiacal dust around\nnearby Sun-like stars is almost completely unknown: if our system is atypical, and\nmost systems are dustier, only a very large (8-m class) mission could be capable to\ndetecting other Earths.\nThe best current limits are at the level of ~100 times the luminosity of our solar\nsystem (see Figure 25); the LBTI may improve this limit by a factor of ten but that is\nunproven and will not be able to map structure in the disks. An optimized\ncoronagraph on NEW WFIRST could significantly advance this field. Precision PSF\nsubtraction or polarimetry could allow the NRO telescope to be sensitive to zodiacal\ndust at the level of ~5 times the solar zodiacal cloud at separations of ~2AU \xe2\x80\x94 a\nfactor of twenty better than current limits and significantly better than any other\nnear-term facility.\n\n6.4 Other Exoplanet Observation Capabilities -- Astrometry\nThere may be other applications of a NEW WFIRST telescope to high priority\nNWNH goals for exoplanet discovery and characterization. One is to search for\nplanetary systems around nearby stars through sub-micro-arcsecond (\xc2\xb5as)\nastrometry. Such precision was the basis of the Space Interferometry Mission\n(SIMLite), which was ranked scientifically as high priority in the NWNH Decadal\nSurvey, but judged to be too expensive in the proposed implementation. The basic\nconcept is to equip an NRO telescope with a diffractive pupil to calibrate nonsystematic distortions: this would enable astrometry at the sub-micro-arcsecond\nlevel. As with SIMLite, an NRO telescope with this feature would be capable of\ndetecting and characterizing earth-like planet detection and estimating their\nmasses around nearby stars (~10pc). The ability to track telescope distortions\nmight also enhance other types of observation, such as by improving the accuracy\nof galaxy weak-lensing measurements.\nA specific implementation would be to imprint a 2-D grid of regularly spaced small\ndark spots on the coating of the primary mirror that will generate faint stellar\ndiffraction spikes (see Figure 26). This concept is simple and robust, with no\nmoving parts or complexity, requiring only a different coating. Once the coating is\napplied on the ground, performance can be fully tested and characterized prior to\nlaunch, minimizing the risk and cost. Furthermore, the implementation is flexible\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n66\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nwith regard to the pattern of diffraction spikes; spacing between the spikes and total\nlight in the spikes can be realized by choice of the diffractive pupil geometry. As a\nresult, the technique can be designed to avoid compromising other observations.\nFor example, in a baseline design for a 1.4m telescope, the additional light\nintroduced by the dots on the primary mirror is less than 1% of the zodiacal\nbackground level over 95% of the field (Guyon et al. 2012a). A trade study is\nneeded to consider different science cases in order to find the best compromise\nbetween astrometric accuracy and diffracted light.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nFigure 26. Dots on the telescope primary mirror (left) and corresponding on-axis\nPSF in the wide field astrometric camera (right). The primary mirror area shown\nis 3% of the pupil diameter across and is located at the edge of the pupil. The\nspacing between the diffraction spikes, their extent in the focal plane, and their\noverall luminosity can be chosen by an appropriate design of the dot pattern on\nthe pupil. The surface brightness of the spikes shown is a factor of 109 (22.5\nmagnitudes) dimmer than the central star.\n\nIn this approach, the astrometric motion of the host star is measured by comparing\nthe position of its diffraction spikes to the background field stars (Guyon et al.\n2012b). This concept can work at visible and IR wavelengths, does not require a\nnew camera or instrument, and can be implemented with the telescope \xe2\x80\x9cas is,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsince it only requires recoating the primary mirror. Simulations show that the NRO\ntelescope, with an aperture of 2.4m, a 0.3 deg2 FOV, and a hexagonal dot pattern\ncovering 1% of the pupil, could in principle achieve 0.1\xce\xbcas (1\xcf\x83) astrometric\naccuracy in a single visit, assuming a 2-day integration observing at the galactic\npole. Guyon et al. (2012a) estimate that such data would be capable of measuring\nthe masses of Earth-like planets to a precision of 10% around nearby stars. This\nresult applies for visible or NIR imaging without relying on the accurate pointing,\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n67\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nexternal metrology technique, or high stability hardware required with previous high\nprecision astrometry concepts (Guyon et al. 2012b).\nCompatibility of a diffractive pupil telescope and a high-performance coronagraph\nhas been tested, showing that the diffracted light does not contaminate the inner\nworking angle of the coronagraph (Bendek et al. 2012). These two capabilities\ntogether offer tremendous synergy to solve for orbital parameters and masses of\nplanetary systems.\n\n7. Programmatic Issues\n7.0 Overview\nDesigns of a WFIRST mission using an NRO 2.4m telescope are based on\nprevious work done for other WFIRST configurations studied by the WFIRST\nProject office and community Science Definition Team (SDT Final report:\nhttp://arXiv.org/pdf/1208.4012.pdf\t\r \xc2\xa0) They involved telescopes of aperture size 1.1 1.3m and focal planes of tens of HgCdTe detectors. The concepts were found to\nbe technically feasible using hardware that is current available with a level of high\ntechnical readiness. Costs have been estimated in the $1.0 - 1.6B range.\n\n7.1 Needed elements for using the NRO telescope\nThe NEW WFIRST designs can leverage off this previous work, but several\nmissing pieces need to be filled in.\n1) The first need is to obtain the detailed optical, mechanical and thermal design\ndocuments for the NRO telescopes. Some information has been released, allowing\nthe above studies to be done. However, the detailed design of the mission will\nrequire full information to be available.\n2) The second need is to form a project and community team with a short-term\nobjective of producing a report on the scientific and technical aspects of the\nmission.\n3) The third need is to have adequate investment in 4k x 4k H4RG detector\ndevelopment. Compared to previous designs with smaller mirrors, the finer pixel\nscale enabled by the larger 2.4m telescope brings a need for more pixels to\nmaintain a wide-field capability. For example, a large 0.5 deg2 field of view\nsampled at 0.11 arcsec/pixel requires 32 H4RG detectors. Development is\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n68\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nunderway on H4RGs, and some detectors are already available, but more work is\nneeded to improve yields and performance.\n\n7.2 Cost comparison with comparable and incomparable missions\nMissions that have technologies ready to go and funded for rapid development can\nbe done at a relatively low cost. An excellent example is Kepler \xe2\x80\x94a 1.4m\ntelescope with a focal plane of 32 CCDs built with a full cost in 2009 of\napproximately $0.6B. Explorer missions such as WMAP, Swift and WISE provide\nexamples of space science missions executed for costs in the range of $100M \xe2\x80\x93\n$200M. HST, Chandra and JWST with their multi-billion-dollar costs are not good\nmodels as they were technologically challenging and built with stringent\nrequirements of long life. The technical envelopes were pushed to the maximum\nfor optical precision and (in JWST\xca\xbcs case) cryogenic operations. The use of an\nexisting space qualified 2.4m optical telescope, used \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d to the greatest extent\npossible, combined with using low risk technical and engineering approaches for\nthe instrumentation and spacecraft, opens up new opportunities to make NEW\nWFIRST an cost-effective option.\n\n7.3 Streamlining integration and testing\nAn advantage of the NRO telescopes is that they were designed to specifications\nthat are a good match to WFIRST. They have active control of the mirror\norientations and metrology that will provide the needed stability of the point spread\nfunction for the WFIRST weak lensing and microlensing science.\nAnother advantage of these telescopes is that they have already undergone\nextensive testing at the component and subsystem level. A full thermo-vacuum\ntest of the full system was planned, but not completed. This test could be done in\nthe early phases of a NEW WFIRST mission to retire risk early. A well-phased and\nstreamlined integration and test plan for NEW WFIRST, combined with a highly\nmodular approach to the spacecraft systems and instrument, has the potential to\ngreatly simply the overall integration-and-testing process and hence reduce\nmission cost.\n\n7.4 Launch vehicles and orbits\nThere are several orbit options for NEW WFIRST. These include (1) L2, (2)\ngeosynchronous and (3) elliptical high orbits. Each has particular advantages. L2\nis highly stable and constantly far from earth. Geosynchronous has launch-sharing\noptions and a good orbit for possible robotic servicing. It also provides continuous,\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n69\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\ninexpensive data down-link. Elliptical orbits can be synchronized for continuous\ndown-link and have lower trapped-electron levels than geosynchronous.\nThere are two currently-operating launch vehicles capable of delivering NEW\nWFIRST to any of the above orbits, the Delta-IV and Atlas V. Both are well\nmatched to the NEW WFIRST-NRO requirements and both have excellent\nreliability records. Other attractive options may become available in time for NEW\nWFIRST. The NASA SLS launcher currently in development has more than\nenough lift capability for NEW WFIRST. A ride on an early launch might be\npossible, or a shared launch to synchronous orbit. A suitable Falcon rocket could\nbe available by 2020 with low cost.\n\n7.5 Operations\nRestricting the number of instruments, and especially the number of operating\nmodes (a feature of spending the majority of observing time on survey science as\ncompared to GO pointed observations) could significantly lower the operations cost\nfor the NEW WFIRST mission. In addition, use of a geosynchronous or elliptical\nhigh orbit, and a single ground-station, could further simplify the ground-operations.\nFurther savings could be made in the science and data operations by leveraging off\nthe infrastructure of existing science operations centers.\n\n7.6 A new approach enabled by NEW WFIRST\nThe cost of astrophysics missions has been rising in the last two decades.\nCertainly one reason for this is greater scientific aspiration \xe2\x80\x94 technical complexity\nand sophistication is a natural result of tackling ever-more-challenging scientific\nquestions. In addition, because of their increased scale and complexity, large\nastrophysics missions programs have become progressively more risk-averse:\nachieving a very high level of confidence drives cost and schedule. There is\nconcern within the science community that increasing costs for the most\nchallenging missions combined with a decreasing budget (in real terms) for space\nastrophysics could have serious consequences for our ability to realize some of the\nhigh-priority-science programs that were described in NWNH.\nNEW WFIRST could be a unique opportunity to break free of this dilemma. NEW\nWFIRST would be a large and powerful space telescope, but it would require\nessentially no technical innovation or development. One of the longest-lead-time\ncomponents \xe2\x80\x94 the telescope itself \xe2\x80\x94 arrives in an advanced state of nearcompletion, having successfully passed testing at the component and subsystem\nlevel, and basically ready for a system thermo-vacuum test. Not only does this\nmean that a significant part of the design, development, and construction cost of\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n70\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nNEW WFIRST has already been invested, but that the risk associated with this\nphase is nearly retired. Also, quire crucially, the designs for other components \xe2\x80\x94\nmainly instruments and spacecraft \xe2\x80\x94 are tightly constrained by the pre-determined,\nwell documented properties of the existing NRO telescope. The risk is further\nreduced for this particular project because the core instrument, a multi-detector\nnear-IR camera, can leverage off the considerable experience gained building\ncameras for HST, Kepler and JWST. In addition, it is very likely the spacecraft can\nbe based on previous, mature designs. Finally, the very existence of two NRO\ntelescopes at a similar level of completion means that a carefully constructed\nprogram could generate most of a backup mission should the worst happen.\nThese are all aspects of a potential NEW WFIRST that offer a lower risk profile\nthan is usually attached to such a large mission.\nWe believe there is an opportunity with NEW WFIRST to change the existing\nscience mission paradigm, by challenging the project team and science community\nto explore ways to keep the costs in the $1B range. This will require \xe2\x80\x94 at a\nminimum \xe2\x80\x94 investments to be made up front on IR detectors and for preliminary\ndesigns, and the scientific requirements to be defined early. Crucial steps are\nbuilding on the capabilities of the existing hardware, and then having the discipline\nto hold to these requirements rigidly. Keeping NEW WFIRST at moderate cost is\npredicated on using the existing NRO hardware with no or few modifications, and\nhaving a rapid development schedule with a suitable funding profile.\n\n8. Summary and Conclusions\nThe present decade is a time of unprecedented opportunity in astrophysics\nresearch, but also a time when funding for new space initiatives is the lowest in\ndecades. The NWNH Decadal Survey proposed a mission, WFIRST, to be an\neffective response to this situation. WFIRST would achieve a genuinely new and\npowerful capability and support a wide range of science goals from stellar\npopulations and galaxy evolution to exoplanets and cosmology. By keeping\nlifecycle cost well below $2B, WFIRST would achieve a \xe2\x80\x9cscience-per-dollar\xe2\x80\x9d ratio\namong the best of previous space astrophysics missions. Even so, the increased\ncost for JWST and the reduced overall funding envelope for NASA Astrophysics\nsince the release of the NWNH Decadal Survey has made it problematical to\ndevelop WFIRST for a launch in the early 2020s \xe2\x80\x94 when its contributions to dark\nenergy and exoplanet research, and synergies with European missions such as\nEuclid, and mainline new facilities such as JWST, ALMA, LSST, and planned ELTs\nare vitally needed. The unanticipated availability of two Hubble-sized telescopes\nfrom the NRO has the potential to be a game changer at this critical point in time.\nThe present discussion is only a preliminary assessment of how well an NRO\ntelescope could perform the WFIRST mission. At this level of investigation, we find\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n71\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nsome examples where the better PSF and larger collecting area does not offer a\ngreat advantage compared to the SDT DRM1 version of WFIRST, because in these\ncases deeper and sharper images may not improve the execution of the program.\nIn most cases, however, we find that a NEW WFIRST would either do a better job,\nor do the same job more quickly, than DRM1. This is especially true for much of\nthe GO program, where surveying large fractions of the sky is not the Figure-ofMerit for accomplishing the science program. While DRM1 may be well matched to\nthe dark energy and exoplanet microlensing goals of WFIRST as proposed in\nNWNH, the possibility of a near-IR Hubble with 100 times larger entendue enables\na vastly larger range of astrophysics programs, as exemplified by the Hubble itself.\nAn increase in capability comes with a cost. Although the imaging capability is\nsubstantially better, it is more difficult to achieve the same FOV as with a smaller\ntelescope like DRM1, and the number of detector pixels required to cover that field\n\xe2\x80\x94 while taking advantage of the better image quality \xe2\x80\x94 increases significantly.\nThe spacecraft that is required must handle a larger, more massive telescope with\ngreater power requirement, and the launch vehicle needs to be substantially larger\nas well. The latter may lead to constraints on orbits and operations that will lead to\nfurther science tradeoffs.\nThere is healthy and justifiable skepticism that the use of a larger, more capable\ntelescope for the WFIRST mission can be done without increasing a cost that\nalready exceeds identifiable resources. However, the possibility of better execution\nof the WFIRST program, as outlined in the Decadal Survey and developed by the\nSDT, and perhaps adding capability for high-priority science, such as the\ncoronagraph for the direct imaging of exoplanets discussed here, is a strong\nmotivation to find an approach that can build NEW WFIRST within the $1.6B cost\nestimated for DRM1. Accomplishing this will require changes in approach to\nmission definition \xe2\x80\x94for example, adapting our science to existing hardware, as we\nhave discussed here. We believe there can be changes in the execution of the\nprogram, and in particular the management of risks, that will lower cost by\ndeparting from traditional practices for large astrophysics missions. Moreover, we\nbelieve the starting point of near-complete 2.4m telescopes with no further\ntechnical innovation required for other components is exactly the kind of program\nwhere such a paradigm shift can be made. In addition, although it is hard to\nevaluate the magnitude of the effect, the re-use of an existing 2.4m \xe2\x80\x9cHubble-like\xe2\x80\x9d\ntelescope for astronomy could put some extra wind behind the sails of the WFIRST\nmission, with respect to governmental --- and perhaps also public \xe2\x80\x94 support and\ninterest.\nHowever, there is no way to demonstrate the feasibility of using NEW WFIRST \xe2\x80\x94\nan NRO telescope used to accomplish the NWNH goals for WFIRST, and more \xe2\x80\x94\nwithout far more detailed studies than those described here. Now is an ideal time to\nengage in that process, as vigorously as possible.\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n72\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nReferences\nAlbrecht, A., et al. 2006, arXiv:astro-ph/0609591\nAssef, R.J., et al. 2012, ApJ, submitted (arXiv:1209.6055)\nBasilakos, S., Plionis, M., and Lima, J.
