An amplifier with these characteristics was required to detect currents in the Pioneer\nplasma probe experiment, with low power consumption, small offset error, and good frequency response.\n\nThe solution:\nA special purpose electrometer amplifier which\ncovers five orders of magnitude dynamic range, which\nconverts positive (ion) currents in the range of 10-14\nto 10- 9 ampere to a corresponding voltage in the\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The\nstabilization network included in the feedback loop\nemploys a capacitive network for accumulating and\nstoring the error caused by drift between periods of\nstabilization. On command, this error signal is referred\nback to the input to effectively cancel out the drift\nerror signal of the amplifier.\n\nNotes:\n1.\t Listed below are the final specifications for the\nnonlinear dc periodically stabilized electrometer\namplifier as developed:\nA.
