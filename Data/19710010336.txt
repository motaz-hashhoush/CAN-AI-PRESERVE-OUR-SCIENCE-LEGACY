F. Carter, G. P. Wood, W. R. Weaver, D. R. McFarland, and S. K. Park\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe Langley Research Center has designed and is constructing a 20\xc2\xad\n\nmegawatt linear plasma accelerator facility as the next step\nto develop a high-speed steady-flow facility for aerodynamic\nreentry velocities. This accelerator is designed to provide\nof 13,000 m/sec at a density corresponding to an altitude of\n\nin a program\n\ntesting at\n\na velocity\n\n53 km.\n\n\nThe basic accelerator design philosophy that was used includes the\n\nfollowing points: (1)the effect on the velocity of the Lorentz force\n\nshould be much greater than the effect of Joule heating; (2)the Lorenitz\n\nforce should derive from a reasonably small current density j and a\n\nreasonably large magnetic flux density B; (3) the product j x B should\n\nbe reasonably large in order to achieve a specified velocity with a short\n\nchannel length; -(4") the quantity j should be approximately constant and\n\nwithin the limit set by an allowable erosion rate of the insulators between\n\nthe anodes; (5) the axial or Hall potential gradient Bx should have a\n\nconstant value over the channel crost section at any given axial location.\n\nIf there is no current jx in the axial direction, then j B =n eB and,\n\nif ne is constant across the channel, a constant gradient across The\n\nchannel then should give uniform acceleration of the plasma over the channel\n\ncross section. Constant Ex can be obtained only with the same voltage\n\ndifference applied across the plasma at all locations along the channel;\n\n(6)the axial potential gradient should not exceed approximately 50 volts/cm,\n\nwhich is an approximate limit above which breakdown along the walls may occur\n\nOne of the first steps in the design of the accelerator is selection of\n\na satisfactory channel geometry. This task was complicated somewhat by the\n\nfact that it\n\nwas necessary to utilize an already existing 10-megawatt power\n\nsupply to power the accelerator. This power supply consists of eight\n\nseparate modules, each rated at 500 volts and 2500 amperes. An accelerator\n\ndesigned with more than eight electrode pairs would be unable to have a\n\nseparate power supply foi each pair. \nThe present 1-inch accelerator has a\n\nseparate supply for each of 24 electrode pairs and operates equally well if\n\nthe plasma generates the proper value of Ex or if it is applied. Since\n\nthe former method is much simpler, it would be preferable to let the plasma\n\nsupply its own Ex. With th larger accelerator, however, a resistor bank\n\nis required not only to supply the proper voltage gradient across the\n\nchannel at each electrode but also the proper axial gradient. The available\n\npower-supply voltage thus limits the channel height as well as the Hall\n\npotential difference that can be applied.\n\nA divergent geometry for the accelerator channel was considered, but\n\ndifficulty in achieving a constant \n Bx over the channel cross section as\n\n\n6\nwell as the-limitations imposed by the power supply made this geometry\n\nunacceptable. A constant-area channel appeared to be the best compromise,\n\nand a detailed design of such a channel was made.\n\nWe believe that the\n\n\nfinal design is a good compromise among the several conflicting criteria.\n\nThe resulting accelerator is shown in figure 1. The channel is 2.5 inches\n\nsquare, the length is 18 inches, and the number of electrode pairs is 36.\n\nThe accelerator has water-cooled copper electrodes. The sidewalls are\n\nboron-nitride plates, backed by water-cooled copper coated with beryllium\n\noxide to prevent electrical breakdown. The expected variation along the\n\nchannel of velocity, current density, and magnetic flux density is shown\n\n\nin figure 2.\n\nWhen this accelerator performs as we hope it will, it should provide\n\nI\na means of investigating such things as heat transfer (4R /2 in a stag\xc2\xad\nnation region will be 3 or 4 times as large as in any other NASA steady\xc2\xad\nflow facility), aerodynamic forces, lifting bodies, and wakes, at a\n\nvelocity corresponding approximately to Venus entry or to minimum-velocity\n\nEarth reentry from Mars.\n\n\nA schematic of the 20-megawatt plasma accelerator facility is shown\n\nin figure 3. The arc heater that generates the plasma for the accelerator\n\nhas been installed and is presently undergoing acceptance tests. The mag\xc2\xad\nnet has been designed and constructed. The resistor network to supply the\n\nproper voltages to the accelerator electrodes consists of inconel strips\n\nsubmerged in tanksof deionized water. This system has been designed and\n\nis presently being installed. The accelerator is to be cooled by a 1500 psi,\n\n2000 gipm water system, which has been installed. The accelerator exhausts\n\ninto a large duct 5 feet in diameter cooled by water sprayed over the outside\n\nsurface. The duct pressure can be maintained at any value from atmospheric\n\nto 0.5 mm Hg, with mass flows as high as 0.2 lb/sec, by a four-stage\n\nsteam-ejector pump. The duct and pumping systems have been completed and\n\nare in use.\n\n\nL\n\n66-91\n\n19\n\n\nPIP\n\n\'\n\n:r\n\n1.4\n\n14x0\n\n1.2-\n\n12\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\nt:105 .8\n\n8\ns eM\nsee\n\nB,\ntesla\n3\n.6\n2\nA/rn\n2\n\n1 \'\n\n3\n\n6\n\n.4-\n\n4\n\n.2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n.10\n\n.30\n\n.20\n\n.40\n\n.50\n\nLength, meter\nCarter et al-2\n\n20 - MEGAWATT PLASMA ACCELERATOR FACILITY\n\ni0\nUMW DC\nSupply\nN2\n6 .\'se- \xc2\xad-\xc2\xad\n\n-w-\n\n4 MWq to\n\n_\n\n[\n\'\n\n"5\'Magne\n\nk\n\nAcceleratorN\n\n2% Cs -\n\n\'Dc\nDuct\n\nI\n\n7\nAccelerator\n\nTo Four-Stage\nSteam Ejectgr\n\nZNto Arc\nHeater\n\nlo MW DC\n\nSupply\nAt Accelerator Exit\np = 0,03 atm\nu = 13.,000 m/sec\nhs = 12.5 X IO J/kg\n8,000 OK\nT\n2\nA = 6.35 x 6.35 cm\nM = 5.0\n53 km Altitude\np\n-\n\nCarter et al-S\n\n\'C\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nii\n\nTHE THERMODYIQIIC PROPERTIES OF SEEDED NITROGEN\nS. K. Park\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nCertain high temperature plasma devices such as MD generators\nand plasma accelerators use as a working fluid nitrogen seeded with an\nalkali metal vapor. It is usually assumed that since the degree of\nseeding is small the thermodynamic properties of this mixture are\nessentially those of nitrogen. To determine the validity of this\nassumption a study has been made of the equilibrium thermodynamic\nproperties of high temperature (1000 to 20,000 0 K), moderate pressure\n(.003 to 3 atm.), seeded (0 to 5%) nitrogen. Calculations were based\non a partition function analysis similar to those used in several\nstudies of unseeded nitrogen, oxygen, and argon (ref. 1 and 2).\n\nIt was found that, because of the low ionization potentials and\n\nsmall partial pressures of the seed materials, their ionization could\nrepresent a significant energy sink in regions where nitrogen is\n\nessentially chemically inactive.\nIn addition the increased number\ndensity of electrons resulting from ionization of the seed material\n\ncauses a delay, until a higher temperature, in the ionization of\n\nnitrogen. These two effects tend to produce for a given seed material,\nrather well defined temperature - pressure regions in which even small\ndegrees of seeding (1 to 2%, based on number density) produce large\nvariation in a thermodynanie property, 10 to 40% in cp/R, for example\n(fig. 1). In other regions the effect of seeding is found to be quite\nsmall even for as much as 5% seeding. It should be emphasized that\nthe preceding statement is true only if proper allowances are made\nfor the change in the average atomic weight of the mixture (and\nconsequently a change in the mixture gas constant) caused by the mass\nfraction of seed material.\n\nIn general it was found that the effect of seeding on the thermody\xc2\xad\nnamic properties ofthe mixture tends to become more pronounced at\nlower pressures. Also as might be expected the effect usually, but\nnot always, becomes more pronounced as the seeding percentage is\nincreased. In addition certain properties (the specific heats and,\nto a lesser degree, enthalpy and internal energy) are significantly\nmore sensitive to seeding than others (entropy, speed-of-sound, departure\ncoefficient Z, etc.). It is pointed out in reference 3 that essentially\nall the real gas effects inherent in the generator and accelerator\nequilibrium flow equations can be incorporated in the term\n\ncp\n\n12\nIt is \t found that P is a strongly varying function of temperature,\npressure (fig. 2), and degree of seeding.\n\n\n1.\n\nDrellishakI K.

The drag due to the increased\n\neffective cross section for ion impact, the drag due to ion scattering, and\n\nthe induction drag due to the Lorentz force were calculated and shown to\n\ntotal only about 3 percent of the aerodynamic drag of the (uncharged) sphere.\n\nWith regard to Echo II, the Goddard Research Center had observed that\n\nit had a very nearly constant rate of spin for 280 days after launch. In\n\norder to attempt to explain how the spin rate could remain nearly constant\n\nfor a long period, we calculated the various torques that might act on the\n\nsatellite. These include the aerodynamic torque, the surface-charge torque\n\ndue to relative rotation between the satellite and the portion of the surface\n\ncharge that is due to induction, the Coulomb torque due to asymmetric impinge\xc2\xad\nment of ions on the polarized satellite, the eddy-current torque due to\n\nrotation of the conductive satellite in a magnetic field, and the induction\n\ntorque due to asymmetry of the j x B force, where the j is due to non\xc2\xad\nuniform acquisition of ions and electrons over the surface. The results are\n\nsummarized in the following table, which shows the average for a complete\n\norbit of the calculated value of each torque about the axis of spin, in\n\nnewton-meters:\n\nSurface-charge \n\n\n21\n\n-6 x 10-\n\n\nAerodynamic \n\n\n-1 x l0- 7\n\n\nCoulomb \n\n\nEddy-current \n\nInduction \n\n\n7 x 10\n7\n\n\n-5\n\n-8 x lo\n\n\n4 x 10-5\n\n\nIt is seen that three of the torques that might affect the rate of spin of\n\nEcho II are small in comparison with the eddy-current (decelerating) torque\n\nand the induction (accelerating) torque. A balance (to better than an order\n\nof magnitude) between these two opposing torques has been obtained and is\n\ntherefore the likely cause of the constancy of the rate of spin of the\n\nsatellite.\n\n\n16\n\n\nReferences:\n\nHohl, F.,,and Wood, G.

Williams\nNASA Langley Research Center\nHampton, Virginia\nA large theta pinch magnetic compression experiment has been built\n\nat Langley for the simulation of ultraviolet and soft x-ray spectra as\n\nobserved by rockes aM satellites from the solar corona.\nIt is the\n\nprimary goal of the experiment to generate the coronal ultraviolet\nspectra and record them with high spectral resolution in order to obtain\nthe information for a detailed analysis of the spectra of highly ionized\n\nelements of solar interest. Since the excitation and ionization\n\nequations for this laboratory plasma are still\nof the coronal type,\nalthough the density is much \'higher than in the corona, and since the\nionization equation is density independent, the spectrum should look\n\ncharacteristically much like the coronal spectrum, even as far as\n\nintensities of different lines are concerned, as long as the temperature\n\nis reproduced. Typical pinch experiments, including the present one,\n\ncan easily achieve this end. \nBarring possible effects of nonuniformities\n\nin the temperature distribution, it may therefore be possible to draw\ncertain conclusions regarding -ionization and recombination rate coeffi\xc2\xad\ncients and transition probabilities.\n\nThe need for extensive spectroscopic work of this type was emphasized\n\nby the 1965 Woods Hole Summer Study by the Space Science Board of the\n\nNAS-NRC;\n"The XUV spectrum of the sun has shown the existence of a\n\ngreat gap in our knowledge of the spectra of highly ionized atoms. For\nexample, the observed solar lines from 171 to 500 Angstroms have defied\n\nidentification. . . . It is important to assure the vigorous contin\xc2\xad\nuation of this work, persuading more spectroscopists to enter the field,\nand using computer methods of analysis, until the energy level systems\nof the common solar elements are completely ,known in all stages of\n\nionization encountered in the corona."\n\nTable I lists the parameters of the three capacitor banks which\n\nare connected in parallel to a common collector plate and coil. The\n\npresent coil is 137 cm. long with 10 cm. inner diameter and constitutes\napproximately 65 percent of the total inductance of the main discharge\nsystem. An ultrahigh vacuum system (base pressure below 10- Torr) "\nserves to insure clean operating conditions in the quartz shock tube.\nObservations may be made side-on down to the transmission cut-off of\nair; and end-on in the vacuum ultraviolet. The tube is filled with\nhighly purified hydrogen (Palladium leak) and traces of the impurities\nthe spectra of which are to be studied. The operation of the theta\npinch need not be described here; it is quite analogous to that of\nPharos at the NRL.\n\n18\nThe spectra obtained from the magnetic compression experiment are\nbeing evaluated in association with the University of Florida under\n\ngrant NRO 10-005-049, including the development of a computer program\n\nfor the detailed analysis of energy level systems.\n\nAt the present time, the spectroscopic investigations in the XUV\n\nhave been carried out vith a normal incidence monochromator converted\nfor film recording of spectra in a limited wavelength range. All\n\nspectra recorded so far are time integrated, i.e., over all half-cycles\n\nof the discharge. The spectrum from the hottest phase is masked by the\'\n\nmore intense spectra emitted during cooler but more contaminated later\n\nphases. They are, nevertheless, being carefully evaluated at this time\n\nbecause they can serve as a convenient reference spectrum for later\n\ntime-resolved spectra.\n\nA unique shutter is under procurement which will permit the attain\xc2\xad\nment of exposure times of the order of 1 microsecond at predetermined\ntimes, and possibly the recording of several spectra at different times\nfrom a single event on the same plate. A normal-incidence 2 meter\nEagle spectrograph for high spectral resolution and wide spectral\ncoverage is likewise under procurement.\nIts effective use with the\nshutter will require a collector plate extension which is being procured.\nSupporting experiments in house include a spectroscopic preheater\n\nstudyv with time and space resolution which is described in a separate\n\nabstract. A mock-up experiment on half-scale for precision magnetic\n\nfield measurements is now being completed.\nIt will serve to investigate\n\nthe effects of flux concentrators and other techniques on the uniformity\nof the magnetic field in the coil. Experiments with preliminary field\nshapers on the magnetic compression experiment have demonstrated an\nimprovement in the containment times under typical operating conditions.\nMore work is, however, needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.\nA special coil with a non-zero minimom magnetic field (magnetic ell)\nhas been constructed and is being tested. Both of these efforts towards\ngreater plasma stability and. longer containment times are described in\nmore detail in separate abstracts. They are important for this effort,\nbecause relaxation times for the establishment of ionization equilibrium\ntend to be of the order of 10 microseconds (or the quarter period of\nthe discharge) for the highest stages of ionization.\nIn a proposed out-ct-house experiment, the Zeeman splitting of\nsome. spectrum lines could be observed in a much smaller device with the\naid of a Uniqlue technique for the observation of extremely weak spectrum\nlines developed by R. T. Schneider under contract NAS-922.\nThis would\ngreatly aid in the identification of the spectra, providing direct\nchecks on the level assignment made on the basis of the spectra obtained\n\nfrom the magnetic compression experiment.\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nPREHEATER\n\nCAPACITOR BANK PARAMETERS\n\nBIAS FIELD\n\nMAIN\n\nUNITS\n\n5 x 103\n\nMicroFarads\n\nCapacitance\n\n9\n\n103\n\nEnergy Storage\n\n2\n\n70\n\n1000\n\n20\n\n12\n\n20\n\nKVolts\n\n6\n\n3\n\n16\n\nKvolts\n\nFrequency\n\n300\n\n10\n\n20\n\nKcycles/sec\n\nPeak Current\n\n350\n\n700\n\nOperating Voltage\nCoil Voltage\n\nCoil Inductance:\n\n1.2 x 104\n10-8 Henries\n\nWoules\n\n1\n\nAmps\n\npUWaDU4G PAGE BLANKW NOT FILM\n\n21\n\nA PRELI1,6INARY STUDY OF FIELD NONUNIFOI1ITY IN A\nLONG THETA-PfICR COIL\nJoseph Norwood, Jr.\n\nNASA.Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nAs a \'device for producing and containing a high temperature plasma,\nthe theta-pinch has enjoyed considerable success. It has tte advantages\n\nthat the plasma is not contaminated by contact vith metal electrodes\n\nand high densities and temperatures can be attained. The instabilities,\n-while numerous and varied, are not felt to be incurable.\nThe most "dangerous" of these instabilities are the drift of the\nplasma column into the tube wal and the break-u; of the column into\nRayleigh - Taylor flutes due to plasma rotation. For experimental\ngeometries common to most of the large theta pinches these instabilities\nlimit the confinement time to typically ren microseconds, often less\nthan the half period of coil current oscillation.\nThe drift instability is caused\'by a gradient in the magnetic\nfield of the coil in the plane of the current feed slot. The plasma\ncolumn possesses a certain magnetic moment per unit length due to its\nazimuthal current, hence a force is exerted antiparallel to the field\ngradient; i.e. toward the feed slot. For a hydrogen plasma with a\xc2\xad\nkinetic temperature of one keV in an average axial field of 105 gauss\nthe drift time to the wall is 5 microseconds if the gradient across the\ncoil diameter of 10 centimeters is 100 gauss.\nThe cause of the rotation of the plasma column is being debated,\nhowever, the mechanism proposed by Haines and analyzed by Thronemann\nand Kolb seems best to fit the situation in 16 ng theta-pinches. In\nthis model an axial Hall current is assumed to be generated by the\ninteraction of the azimuthal current with the radial component of\nmagnetic field. The Hall current and the radial component of field\nthen produce a Lorentz force on the plasma column in the azimuthal\ndirection. For stability, the finite cyclottlon radius theory requires\nthat transverse fields be held to less than a few per mil of the axial\nfield.\n\nThe requirement for a collector plate in a large theta-pinch\nexperiment dictates the geometry to a large extent. A large number of\ncoaxial cables must be connected to the plate which must transfer the\ncurrent with low inductance to a coil one or two meters in length. This\nrequirement suggests a long narrow set of plates with close spacing. The\n\n22\ncables are connected to one of the long sides and the coil is\n\nsymnetrically attached to the other. The current must then funnel into\n\nthe coil giving rise to a field curvature in the coil. It is this field\n\ncurvature and the consequent gradient of the field in the coil which\n\ncontributes most to drift instability in large theta-pinches.\n\nDue to the finite length of the coil the field lines diverge\nproducing an azimuthally symmetric radial gradient which increases as\none approaches the end of the coil from the center plane. The field\napproaches uniformity within one per nil at a distance of two radii\nfrom the end, hence stabilization against drift due to the "minimum B" well\nis confined to the very ends and cannot be expected to stabilize the\n\ndrift in large experiments where the ratio of length to radius is near 20.\n\nPlasma shape may also influence the magnetic field shape. In the\n\nevent the plasma contracts axially such as to concentrate itself near the\n\nmedian plane of the coil, that portion of the coil will have lower induct\xc2\xad\nance and the driving currents will,concentrate more heavily there.\n\nFor the case where the skin depth is much less than the thickness\n\nthe plates, the partition of te current in a parallel plate trans\xc2\xad\nof\nmission line between the inside and outside surfaces of the conductor\n\nplates is a function of the gap spacing, h, and the plate width, b.\n\nIf h/b varies along the transmission line the current must spill\n\naround the end to get from the inside to the outside or vice versa.\n\n3 to\n\nFrom the feed slot to the center of the coil h/b changes from 1010-1. The effect on the field gradient in the coil is opposite to that\n\ninduced by the current geometry, i.e., the gradient points toward the slot.\n\nThe axial distribution of current in a high frequency coil is not,\nuniform as in the D.C. case. The limiting value of field at the end of\nthe coil is 5.4 x l05 gauss for the beryllium - copper alloy in the\nLangley Magnetic Compression Experiment. Typically, 7. percent of the\ncurrent is concentrated within one radial length of the coil ends. The\n\neffect on the current is that upon entering the coil, axial current com\xc2\xad\nponents are set up both on the inside and outside surfaces of the coil.\n\nThe effect on the field is a gradient pointing toward the feed slot.\n\nA half-scale model of the coil and collector plate of the Langley\n\nMagnetic Compression Experiment has been built in order to measure the\n\nnon-uniformity of the field and to serve as a test facility for different\n\ncoil configurations designed to improve the uniformity of the field. The\n\nmodel is powered by a 13.5 KJ capacitor bank. The discharge is tuned by\n\nvariable inductors such that the skin depth scales also as 1:2. A system\n\nof probe coils is being constructed which will measure Bz(rQz) and\n\nBr(0,0,z) with an anticipated accuracy of a few per mil.\n\nSolutions to the problem of field gradients which have been\n\nemployed by other theta-pinch groups have involved modifications to\n\nthe current collector plates. The solution which is being pursued\n\nat Langley involves the use of flux concentrators. Any good conductor\n\n\n23\nwhich is introduced into a high frequency magnetic field develops skin\ncurrents which exclude the field from its interior. The axial current\ncomponents in the coil above and below the feed slot are antiparallel.\n\nThus closed current loops will be formed on the outer surface of the\nflux concentrator and the axial component of current will be shielded\n\nfrom the coil interior. The contribution of axial current components\nto the field gradient in the coil can thus be eliminated except for\nnon-synmetric axial currents which cross the median plane. These are\n\nexpected to be small.\n\nFLUX CONCENTRATOR FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF FIELD GRADIENTS\n\n\nCLOSED CURRENT LOOPS\n\nFLUX CONCENTRATOR\n\nCOIL\n\nNorwood-1\n\n25\n\nA MINIMUM-B TYPE COI\n+\n\nBy W. A. Cilliers\n\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nIn the search for ways of stable confinement of 9-pinch plasmas,\nmany configurations have been tried out.\nSo far all\nof these suffer\nfrom instabilities that turned out to be intolerable. Ways have,\n\nhowever, been found to eliminate the more serious of these instabilities\nin some cases - or to reduce their growth rates.\nTheory gives some criteria that have to be satisfied for achieving\n\nhydromagnetic stability. One such criterion is that the magnetic field\n\nlines must be convex towards the plasma. This is achieved in the cusp\n\ngeometries. Here, however, the loss \'rate is high since it is impossible\n\nto satisfy the condition everywhere over a closed surface.\n\nIn the theta-pinchend losses can be reduced by means of mirror\n\nfields. Particles having kinetic energy parallel to the coil axis will\nbe reflected provided that the angle between the velocity vector of the\nparticle and the coil axis at the end plane is greater than a certain\nangle determined by the mirror ratio. FIrthermore, a condition that a\ncharged particle be reflected is .that its magnetic moment,\ng, be an\nadiabatic invariant. This implies that the magnetic field varies little\n\n(as seen by the particle) during one gyration. The drift energy of the\n\nparticle is slowly changed -intogyration energy.\n\nIn the mirror machine the magnetic field in the central portion of\n\nthe pinch is decreasing in the radial direction. Hence, instabilities\n\nthat tend to carry plasma in the radial direction, at the midplane, e.g.,\n\ncan extract energy from the plasma to support their own growth since\n\n\nj=(1\n\n2)\n\n\nis constant.\n\nThe obvious remedy for this is to make the field increase in all\n\ndirections from the center of the container. This has led to the idea\n\nof the so-called minimum JBI field configuration or magnetic well.\n\nIt has been shown by various people (e.g. Taylor (2) and Schmidt (1))\n\nthat min IBI\nfields offer hydromagnetic stability for low density\n\nplasmas.\n\nIn practice the so-called Joffe experiment has shown that a min\nBI\nfield results in some improvement of containment for a low density plasma\nin the mirror machine.\n\n+NAS-NRC Senior Post-Doctoral Resident Research Associate.\n\n\n26\nWe are investfgating a coil that gives such a magnetic well at its\ncenter. This type of coil was first proposed by Andreoletti and could\nbe described as a tetrahedral spire (see fig. 1). Calculations of the\nmagnetic field everywhere inside the coil for uniform (DO) current\ndistribution in the coil were carried out with the slopes of the sides\nIt was found that slopes of 0.75\nand the aspect ratio as parameters.\naid -0.375-respectively for the two sides and an aspect ratio of 0.5\ngive the best well. Even so the \'region over which the contours of\nJBj are cotpletely closed is quite \'small in the x-z plane as\nconstant\nshown in figure 2. In figure 3, the contours are shown in a plane at\n450 to the x-z plane. -it seems that most particles moving away from\nthe center of the coil will encounter an increasing magnetic field.\nPreliminary measurements of the field .when a current of frequency\n25 kc/s is sent through the coil indicates that the vell region is\nbigger than at DC. Measurements at 400 kc/s are at present under way.\nIt is realized that when a plasma is introduced into the coil, the\ncontours of lB} could be changed considerably for anything but a very\nlow P plasma. Theoretically, the depth of the well is not important-.\nThere should, however5 not exist high field gradients that can destroy\n\nthe -\'adiabatic" movement of the, particles.\nIf the present field measurements should give, promising results,\nan attempt will be made to study the behavior of a plasma inside the\n\ncoil.\n\n\n1 Sehmidt,\n\nG., Phys.

D. Willihm\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\nThe capacitor bank is a popular source of enercr for plasma\nexperiments and its switches play an important role in determining\nhow well it performs. A better understanding of the factors that\ngovern the performance of switches is therefore desirable.\nThe perfect switch will switch unlimited energy in zero time.\nThe practical switch is limited in both respects. In today\'s typical\n\nbank the energy limitation is met by using more and/or larger switches.\nThis approach puts greater demands on switch synchronization, however,\nad provides a stimulus to improve switch synchronization.\n\nIt is well known that spark gap switches, although triggered\nsimultaneously, nevertheless conduct at different times. This phenomenon\ngives rise to the term "switch Jitter."\n\nperformance several ways:\n\nSwitch jitter affects system\n\n\n(1) it determines the magnitude of circulating\n\n\ncurrents; (2) it determines the voltage rate of rise at the load;\n(3) it determines the magnitude of voltages reflected from the load;\n\nand (4) low switch jitter is desirable any time synchronization of other\nassociated systems is involved. The purpose of this project is to\n\ndetermine what factors affect switch jitter and how they affect it in\n\norder to be able to minimize switch jitter, or, perhaps, to reveal\n\ncompelling reasons for an improved switch. Because of its wide-spread\n\nuse, the trigatron switch (two hemispherical electrodes with a trigger\n\n\npin inserted in one of them) will be used in the project.\n\nDuring tests of the apparatus for the Magnetic Compression Experiment\nat NASA Langley, it was necessary to measure jitter of the switches. A\nsystem using a novel optical technique was devised (ref. 1). A number of\nlight pipes were positioned near and pointed at a sample number of the\n205 switches of the system. The other ends of these light pipes were\npositioned to form a horizontal slit in the field of am image converter\n\ncamera. By triggering the camera streak shortly before ignition of the\n\nswitches, a time history of switching was obtained on photographs. A\ntypical result is shown in figure 1. This same general method will be\n\nused in the investigation of the parameters that affect switch Jitter.\n\nWith the arrangement used in reference 1, the intensity of the light\ntransmitted to the camera was limited by the solid angle of acceptance\n\nof the light pipes, the different attenuations of the l1ht pipes, and\n\nthe suspected movement of the switch discharge. These factors resulted\n\n\nin errors in the recorded initiation times of the discharges.\n\nFor\n\n\nillustration, let figure 2 represent the light intensities at the cmera\n\n\n32\nof switches A, B, C versus time (not to scale).\nIt is evident that\nalthough A and B actually switched at the same time, their streak\nrepresentations would begin at different times, t I and t 2\n . Also,\nany irregularities in later portions of the light pulse would produce\n\nsimilar effects, as illustrated by C.\n\nThe illustrated errors will be minimized by the present apparatus\n\nwhich is Just becoming operational. In it six ellipsoidal cavity\n\nreflectors are mounted in a compact hexagonal configuration. A spark\ngap is located at one focus of each reflector so that practically all\nthe light from it will converge to the other focus where it will be\ncollected by a short light pipe and fed directly to the photocathode\nof the electronic streak camera. Light intensity is expected to be\nincreased by several orders of magnitude.\n(The effect could be repre\xc2\xad\nsented on figure 2 by increasing the respective slopes thereby yielding\na truer streak representation of the actual firing times.) The system\nalso includes other features that will facilitate investigation of the\neffect of such parameters as trigger voltage risetime, electric field,\n\nand pressure.\nThe switching times to be observed are expected to consist of two\ncuponents, (i) a constant component due to the parameters, and (2)\na random component due to the availability of a particle to start the\n\ndischarge. Figure 3 shows results obtained from tests on the Mgnetic\nCompression Experiment apparatus. The two components are evident from\nthe plot of the number of switches fired,\nn.\nNo switch fired earlier\nthan 4o ns. Part of the 4o ns is the formative time of discharge re\xc2\xad\nquired by each switch and determined by the various parameters.\n(The\nother part is due to the time difference of streak and switch triggers.)\nThe various additional times are random cqpontnts that can be predicted\nfrom a probability curve represented by Ct" (It is interesting to note\nthat the curve is not Gaussian as is usually assumed.)\nSimilar data\nwill be taken with the new apparatus. It will be treated statistically\nby a computer technique to recover these components.\n\n1. \t K. Oertel, M. D. Williams, Hev.

Among the many\n\ncauses of deviations of the actual ionization equilibrium from the ideal\n\nITE one of the most prominent occurs in optically thin low density\nplasmas. The assumption of small optical thickness implies that most\nof the emitted radiation leaves the plasma without reabsorption;\ntherefore the principle of detailed balapng is violated and deviations\nfrom the Saha equation may be expected. -\' The extreme case occurs in\nthe solar corona, where collisional excitation and ionization rates are\nbalanced exclusively by radiative rates; it is referred to as corona\nequilibrium. O5 In the more general case of competing radiative and\ncollisional rates one speaks of semi-corona equilibrium.\n\nThe more comprehensive approach to finding the6 ionization equation\n\nin this general case was taken by D. R. Bates et al who solved the\ncomplete set of rate equations for all atomic states, neutral and\nionized, in hydrogen, as well as in a pseudo-alcali atom consisting of\na hydrogen atom with omission of the ground state n = 1. This had to\nbe carried out numerically on an ylectronic computer; and the results\nare given in tabular form. Griemn has proposed a functional form which,\nin the case of hydrogen, agrees rather well with Bates\' et al results,\n\nbut which is so complicated as to make practical calculations extremely\n\ndifficult, and which must itself be programmed for a computer if results\n\nof any extent are desired. A correction factor for the Saha equation\n\nwas derived previously on the basis of a simple model and has been\n\ncompared here to correction factors computed from the tables of Bates\'\n\net al. It became apparent that with a minor empirical modification\n\nthe simple correction factor agrees well within the precision of the\n\n\n38\n\ncross sections used by Bates et al with their results for all electron\n\ndensities and temperatures. It should be used as a factor on the right\n\nside of the Saha -equation (1) in the form\n\n\na\n\nE\n\n~K~(E \t\n\nfor\n\n1\n\nwhere the collision limit\n\nT\'\n\nE\n\n=\n(-!) 2.9 x 10\n\n18\n\n)J\n\n-3\n\n\nCm\n\n(2),\n\n\n>1\n\nis given by\n\n\ns0\n\n[~3Ne(2J\n\n=EH \n\n\nz71(3\n\nis the number of equivalent electrons in the ground, state.

P. Shomo and G. K. Oertel\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nA spectroscopic determination of the electron density and temperature\nof the plasma generated by the preheater discharge in the Magnetic\n\nCompression Experiment (MCE) is in progress. Tne purpose is to establish\nspace and time resolved information about the thermodynamic state of the\npreheater plasma at the time the main pinch event is initiated; it can\nbe used to define initial conditions in MHD calculations. There is\nevidence that the initial conditions are extremely important for the\ntheta-pinch process; i.e.,\nduring the first\nhatf-cycle there is no\ntheta-pinch at all if preionization is absent.\nThe temperature is determined from the ratio of the intensities of\nthe H beta line of hydrogen and the underlying continuum, while the\nelectron density results both from absolute continuum intensity measure\xc2\xad\nments and from the width of the H beta line of hydrogen. Time resolution\nis achieved by photomultiplier recording, while space resolution results\nfrom an Abel inversion assuming cylindrical symmetry.\nWith a gas filling of pure hydrogen of 100 microns of mercury, and\nusing the preheater bank of the Magnetic Compression Experiment (for\n\nparameters see G. K. 0ertel, J. Norwood and M. D. Williams,\nCompression Experiment,"\n\nin this volum)\n\ntemperatures are several times lO 1 5 cm-\n\n"Magnetic\n\ntypical electron densities and\n\nand 1 to 1.5 electron volts,\n\nrespectively, with a typical decay time of 40 microseconds in the,electron\n\ndensity near the coil axis.\nThe plasma appears to be nearly uniform\nduring the time from 10 to 25 microseconds after the initiation of the\npreheater discharge; it begins to peak more and more strongly near the\n\naxis at later times (see table 1).\nSimilar results are obtained for the\nelectron temperature; nonequilibrium effects become noticeable in the\nwall regions after about 30 microseconds.\nThere is some evidence that magnetic fields remain trapped in the\nplasma after the preheater discharge damps out (it does so after about\n15 microseconds).\nIn apparent agreement with computed decay times\n(assuming field diffusion by Ohmic losses) it seems to disappear after\ntypically 20 to, 25 microseconds.\nThe assumption of a uniform preheater plasma seems to be justified\nduring the period from 10 to 25 microseconds after the initiation of\nthe preheater discharge; and trapped magnetic fields have disappeared\nnear the end of this period. A delay of 25 microseconds between the\ninitiation of the preheater and theta-pinch (main) banks is judged to\nbe the optimum operating condition in this experiment. More detailed\nmeasurements including the effect of the third (Bz bias field) discharge\nare in progress.\n\n\nTABLE I.-\n\nse tR\n0\n\n15\n2.68\n\nPREHEATER ELECTRON DENSITY, 1l\n\n- :)\nIcm\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2.03\n\n2.09\n\n1.87\n\n1.59\n\n1.48\n\n.\n\n45\n\n50\n\n.5\n\n1.17\n\n0.5\n\n2.67\n\n2.21\n\n2.07\n\n1.88\n\n1.63\n\n1.36\n\n1.30\n\n1.09\n\n1.0\n\n2.48\n\n2.11\n\n2.11\n\n1.85\n\n1.62\n\n1.31\n\n1.26\n\n1.11\n\n1.5\n\n2.53\n\n2.22\n\n2.01\n\n1.82\n\n1.57\n\n1.31\n\n1.29:\n\n1.u!\n\n2.0\n\n2.51\n\n2.13\n\n1.96\n\n.\n\ni71 1.54\n\n1.29\n\n1.37\n\n1.08\n\n2.5\n\n2.42\n\n2.09\n\n1.90\n\n1.36\n\n1.38\n\n1.32\n\n1.15\n\n6,95\n\n3.0.\n\n2.52\n\n2.21\n\n1.85\n\n1.62\n\n1.33\n\n1.31\n\n1.04\n\n.82\n\n3.5\n\n2.53\n\n2.23\n\n1.85\n\n1.55\n\n1.30\n\n1.09\n\n0.82\n\n.61\n\n4.0\n\n2.52\n\n2.23\n\n1.78\n\n1.35\n\n1.15\n\n0.73\n\n.62\n\n4.5\n\n2.38\n\n2.21\n\n1.62\n\n1.35\n\n0.96\n\n.73\n\n.48\n\n1\n\n.5\n\n.34\n\n45\nMEASUREMENTS OF STARK WIDTHS OF ARGON ION LIES IN A T-TUBE PLASMA\nN.

Oertel\nNASA \t Langley Research Center\nHampton, Virginia\nStark \tbroadened profils\n\nof the singly ionized &rgonline6 at\n\n48o6 (4s\'p - 4p4%O), 4736\n1(4s"! and 4426 A(hst - 4p4D\xc2\xb0 )\n4ro)\nhave been measured in a dense (Ne 1.03 x 1017/cm5 ) plasma behind\nthe reflected shock wave in an electromagnetic T-tube.\nThe energy storage capacitor used to power the discharge stores 600\nJoules at 40 kV. The circuit rings at 300 kc and is critically damped\nto prevent the formation of multiple shock waves. The position of the\nreflector is adjustable and all measurements are made 1 nm in front of\nthe reflector through 2 mm diameter holes. Measurements are made at\nthe center of the tube and at the wall (i.e-., in the boundary layer) in\norder to test the plasma uniformity in the line of sight.\nThe optical arrangement is shown ii figure 1. A 2 meter monochromator,\nwith an apparatus function (full) half-width of 0.2 k is used to scan\nthe line profile shot to shot. Khe other two monochromat rs monitor\nthe total intensity of the 4806 A argon II line add a 33 A wide continuum\nband centered at 5100 R. Monitoring of the 4806 A line insured repro\xc2\xad\nducibility of the temperature while monitoring of the continuum band\ninsured the same for the electron density. All runs for which the\nintensities vary by more than 10 percent from a predetermined level are\nrejected.\n\nThe vacuum system is initially evacuated to 1 x 10- 6 Torr and\nthen filled with a mixture of 97%helium and 3% argon to a pressare of\n1 Torr.\n\nThe half-width of the 5876 A Hel line indicates an electron density\n\nD\n\nof 1.03 X 1017 /cm (\xc2\xb1 10%A at both positions. The ratio of its integrated\nintensity to that of a 100 A band of the underlying continuum indicates a\ntemperature of 18,0000 K (+ 20%) uniformly throughout the plasma.\nThe 4806 a ArII line is also measured at both Positions in the tube\nand the two profiles agree well within experimental error. The profiles\nare corrected for underlying continuum and Voigt profiles fitted to\nthe (corrected) experimental profiles (fig. 2). As the apparatus profile\nof the measuring instrument is nearly Gaussian this procedure allows the\nexperimental profiles to be unfolded and the spectral line profile to be\nobtained.1 The resulting profile has a (ful half-width of 0.39 R (\xc2\xb1 10%).\nIt is \t wider than the value predicted by Griem by a factor r\n2.6. The\n\n46\n\n4736 X ArII line in the same multiplet (6)\nconditions, is in agreement with the 4806\na factor\n\nmeasured under the same\nline (i.e. too wide by\n\n\nr - 2.6).\n\n\nThe 4426 R ArIT line in multiplet 7 as measured unde these same\nconditions has a (full)\'half-vidth between 0.3 F and 0.4 X. LComparison\nwith the theoretical half-widths gives r = 2.5 to 3.3. The limits\non r\' are large for this line due\'to a weak ArII line close by which\ndistorts the continuum measuremen , and which is only listed in the\nThe results of this experiment\ncomprehensive tables of Minnhagen.\nPreliminary measurements gt higher electron\nsumnarized in table I.\nare\n=\ndensity (Ne \n 6 x 1017/cm 3 ) indicate that the 3729 A ArlT line in\n10 is also wider than predicted by a factor r - 2.5.\nmultiplet\nThe Lines measured in this experiment all have the same lower\nt\nlevel (4s P) and exhibit more broadening than predicted. These results.\nare consistent with the suggestion that the broadening of the lower\nstate cannot be neglected. This is supported by recent calculations\nof Roberts 4 which also indicate that more perturbing states must be\ntaken intd account and that the effects of "strong collisions" may\nbe larger than,expected.\n\n\n1.\n\nJ.

In order to isolate this effect for study the following simplifying\nassumptions are made: The plasma is assumed to be fully ionized. Only\nthe slug mode of operation is considered. Electron emission is assumed\nto take place by ion impact, i.e., thermionic and field emission\nmechanisms are ignored. The Townsend secondary ionization coefficient,\ny is assumed to be less than unity. The incoming ion will, for cathode\nwork functions and plasma ionization potentials encountered in coaxial\nguns, be reflected as a neutral. The reflection angle will, most\n\nlikely, be independent of the angle of incidence so that the kinetic\n\nenergy corresponding to the axial component of velocity is lost to\n\nthe cathode.\n\nThe viscous drag caused by ion impact on the cathode is just.the\nx - component of ion momentum times the ion impact frequency which is\njust al lie. where I is the total current, e is the electronic\ncharge (single ionization assumed) and a is the portion of the current\ncarried by the ions. It can be shown that in a strongly radiating\nplasma (T > I eV), e.g., one composed of high z material, the photo\xc2\xad\nelectric eff-ect is sufficient to supply photoelectron emission to carry\nall the current. Hence for y << 1 and a low radiation flux, G\nwould approach unity, whereas either large radiation losses or a large\nvalue of y would cause the current to consist mostly of electrons..\n\nFor this case m would be quite small.\n\nAnother means by which particles may reach the electrodes and\nproduce a drag force is by thermal diffusion. In this case the impact\n\nfrequency will be given by the product of efflux velocity, )WT22zmi,\n\nthe ion density, ni, and the electrode area A. At the high ion\nthe\ndensities encountered in coaxial guns (n 1 = 1016 - lO 1 7 c)\nmean free path for ions (or neutrals) is less than one millimeter,\n\nhence for temperature gradients which may be typteal in coaxial guns,\n\nthe impacting particles will have thermal energies corresponding to\n\nonly a few tenths of an eV. Thus the large majority of the impacting\nparticles may be neutrals for which the assumption of diffuse reflection\n\nat the electrode surface is not likely to hold. Taking A = 30 cm2\n\n,\nn i = 1016/cm\', and T = 0.5 eV one calculates an impact frequency for\n\n52\nhydrogen of 102 3 /isec which must be\'reduced due to the fact that\n\nspecular reflection of neutrals will yield no momentum transfer to thes\n\nelectrode. The impact frequency due to ion current,\nI/e for a \n current\n\nof 5 X 105 amps will be 5 X 1O24/sec, hence the effect of thermal\n\ndiffusion is ignored.\n\nThe equations which are programed on a digital computer are shown\nin figure 1. The calculations have been made for a = 0 and a = 1/2.\nThe gradient of gun inductance being logarithmic is relatively insensitive\nand so r2ir1 was chosen as 2.718 for convenience.\nThe ohmic resistance\nwas chosen as typical of such systems, 10- 3 ohm.\nA sample of the results is shown in figure 2 where gun efficiency\ndefined as the plasma kinetic energy at x = 40 cm divided by the\n\nstored energy of the capacitor bank is plotted versus the plasma mass.\n\nIt is seen that the drag effect maximizes for low mass loading as\n\none would expect since the velocities are large. Optimum mass loading\n\nfrom the point of view of maximu efficiency is from one to ten micro\xc2\xad\ngrams. This agrees within a factor of about 10 with the experimental\n\nresults of a paper by Michels, Heighway, and Johansen which are replotted\n\nin figure 3.\n\nA comparison of gun performance with, and without viscous drag made\nat the point of maximum efficiency of the curves for m = 1/2 shows\nthat the effect can amount to as much as 27 percent for the range of\n\nparameters considered.\nThe effect of energy losses due to plasma heating and radiation\nhave been ignored in this simplified treatment even though, as Oertel\nhas pointed out, the radiation loss from a gun paEsma may be quite\nsevere. Thus the results do not pretend to accurately predict\nefficiencies to be expected in the operation of a laboratory device,\nbut rather serve to point out that problems concerning the interaction\nof plasmas with electrodes are in need of further investigation.\n\n\n53\n\nEQUATIONS FOR THE COAXIAL PLASMA GUN\n\n\n2\nd2x +, II\ndt2\n\ni dx 10L 12\ne t -2 x\n\nI\nbL -d +LI X+\nOJ +-L-x\nL bL4L d21 +2L dxdi+L dx R-dl-l+-L\n+\xc2\xb0\n2\nd2\nlobaxi2t x dt dt 6x dt\ndt2\ndt C\n\nO0\n\nINITIAL CONDITIONS\n\nI (0)=--O\n1d =\n(0)\n\nd0\n-\n\n=\n\n0x\n\nx (0) =0\n0\n\no0\nVdt 00\n\nNorwood-1\n\n\n54\nGUN EFFICIENCY AS A FUNCTION OF ACCELERATED MASS\n2\ni0o\n\n\n10 2 -\xc2\xad\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n00\n\n/\n\n//\n\nC =bILfd\nvo=10 kV\nLo 4OnH\n\npercent\n\n4\n\n100\n\ni0\n\n200 nH/m\n\n-1\n\nI\n\n10\n10- 1 3\n\n10 - 1 2\n\n10-11\n\nio-0\nM, kg\n\nI\n10- 9\n\nI\n10-7\n\'10-8\nNorwood-2\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EFFICIENCIES AS A FUNCTION OF INECTED PROPELLANT MASS\n\n28-\n\n0\n0\n\n24-\n\n20"\xc2\xad\n\n16\n\npercent\n,n\',\n12\n\n\' 8\n\nG\n\n4\n\n0\n10-9\n\nI\n10- 8\nM\n\n0\n\n, kg\n\n10-7\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n5T-\n\nTHE PRODUCTION AND PROPAGATION OF PLASMOIDS IN A\nNON-LINEAR ALFVEN WAVE\nDaniel R. Wells\nUniversity of Miami\n\nCoral Gables, Florida\n\nand\n\nJoseph Norwood, Jr.\n\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe most general solution of the linearized hydromagnetic\n\nequations is the hydromagnetic wave since any other solution can be\n\nexpressed as a linear combination of these wavesi In a compressible\n\nmagneto-plasma the hydromagnetic waves consist of an Alfvn wave and\nan ordinary sound wave propagating along the magnetic field and a\nmagneto-acoustic wave propagating across the field. This paper will\n\nconfine itself to a discussion of the Alfvdn waves, hence an incompress\xc2\xad\nible fluid will be assumed for the most part.\n\nIn addition to being incompressible the fluid is assumed to be\ninviscid and of infinite electrical conductivity. The magnetic field\nis divided into a zero order uniform field and a first order perturbation\nfield. The velocity is considered to be a first order quantity. All\ngradients of quantities perpendicular to the zero order field, %o,\nare ignored. With these assumptions one finds dispersionless, undamped\nwave equations for the perturbation field, b, and velocity, y, where\nthe direction of propagation is along 10 and the velocity of\npropagation is the Alfven velocity.\nIt can be shown by taking the curl of the linearized-equations\nthat the d\'Alembertian commutes with the curl, hence the wave equations\nare also satisfied by the current density, J, and the vorticity, $.\nThus, for vanishingly small perturbation velocities, v, the current\ndensity and vorticity are propagated along the magnetic lines of force\nat Alfven speed. From this point of view an Alfv4n wave can be considered\nas a suitably arranged group of vortex filaments of vanishing strength\naligned perpendicular to the magnetic field and moving parallel (or\nantiparallel) to the field.\nThe superposition of a vortex singularity on a parallel flow field\ngives rise to a lifting (Magnus) force p($ X v).\nThus the Helmholtz\n\n58\ntheorem actually describes a force-free singularity.\nIn hydromagnetics\n\nthe most general force-free combination of v and t\nfeatures\n"\n\nparallel to b with the vortex allowed to move parallel to Ao. There\n\nare two possibilities according to whether magnetic and-mass flow\n\ncirculation ar6 parallel or antiparallel. The two types of magneto\xc2\xad\nvortices do not interact destructively with others of their own kind,\n\nhowever, if a mixture of types were present in the Alfvn wave, then\n\nthe wave would break up.\n\n4\n\nWhat now if\nv is not small and leads to a magnetic field which\n\nis comparable to or larger than the magnetic guide field\' %?\nSpecial\n\nsolutions can be obtained from the full non-linear equations. In a\n\nsteady-state the left hand side of the equation of motion is zero. By\n\ntaking the curl of this equation and assuming the magnetic and flow\n\nfields to be colinear (v= p)\nwhere P is a scalar quantity,\n\nsolutions are generated which describe a disturbance which moves with\n\nAlfv~n speed and/or has its vorticity frozen into the plasma. The\n\nsecond solution corresponds, by virtue of the generalized Helmholtz\n\ntheorem, to the condition for transport of fluid mass by the vortices.\n\nEither\'or both solutions, may apply. The assumption of colinear flow\n\nis justified quajitativealy by consideration of the dynamo action which\n\nseeks to align v and B. A more powerful justification appears as\n\na result of minimizing the total energy of the system subject to\ncertain constraints. This analysis yields the result that the stable\n\nplasmoid propagated as a non-linear Alfv6 n wave has colinear fields\n\n(in. support of our assumption) with flows having Alfvn velocity and\n\nis force-free-o\n\nAssuming that the fields are axisymmetric solutions are easily\n\nfoulad in cylindrical coordinates. The boundary conditions exclude\n\nnormal co-3ponehts~of the fields at the boundary and require that the\n\njump in\nv and B at the boundary be accompanied by a vorticity\n\nand current layer respectively.\nThis layer must be of finite thickness\n\nsince in a real fluid, finite viscosity precludes infinitely small\n\nvortices. The guide field and external flow (translation of the\n\nplasmoid) are assumed to be current- and vortex-free.\nIn order that\n\nthe Magnus and Lorentz forces balance at the boundary, the translation\n\nvelocities must be Alfvnic.\nContrardtating plasmoids can only\npropagate stably .parallel to the guide field; corotating ones can\nonly propagate stably antiparallel.\nPlasmoid structures which appear stable have been observed not only\nin the laboratory but possibly also in ionospheric research. Recent\n\nwork by Krtskhava\'s group at Sukhumi has shown structures in theta\npincha and z-pinchs which are aligned parallel and perpendicular to the\nmagn9tic lines.\nThe group at Stevens, under Bostick have found both types\nof structures in a coaxial plasma gun.

The structures will be expelled from the large end of\nthe coil and projected into the mirror field. Measurements have shown\n\nthat every other vortex structure is destabilized and destroyed upon\n\nentering the mirror field as one would expect since the contrarotating\nplasoids can only move dowstream and the corotating ones only upstream.\n\nLINEARIZED ALFVEN WAVE\n\n2\n\n2\n\n_\n\n2\na\n\n2\na\n\n0\'\'\nVj\n\nJ\xc2\xad\n\nee\neV\n\n.B\n\nB\n\nCOROTATING VORTEX LAYER\n\nV\n\n0-_\np\nPlo\nNorwood-,l\n\n\nTHE NONLINEAR ALFVEN WAVE\n\n\nBo\n\n0\n\n\nNorwoocd-2\n\n63\n\nPARAMETRIC STUDY OF MPD ARC AT LOW EXHAUST PRESSURES\n\n(ip to i/lOvHg)\n\n\nP.

For both theories if the mass flow is\n\nabove the effective mass flow the discharge will use only the effective mass\n\n\n64\n\n\nflow and the rest of the mass flow will not be accelerate&. If the mass\n\nflow is below the effective mass flow and if entrainment or electrode\n\nerosion can be avoided the actual mass flow will be less than the effective\n\nmass flow, the arc voltage will be increased and higher specific impulse\n\n-can be obtained. The condition for the 7ass flow to be less than the effect\xc2\xad\nive mass flow is in reference 3 for J/e /m > 1 and in reference 4 for\nJ/elf/rn> 2Vl1V where V1 = ionization potential.\n\nThe above theories will be discussed further in reference 5, however, as\n\nmentioned above, the measurements in references 1 and 2 were made at\n\nJ/ejt/m > 4 and that is at mass flows below the effective mass flow for both\n\nreference 3 and 4.\n\nSchematics of 2 accelerators are shown in figure 1. Measurements reported\n\nin \'references 1 and 2 were performed with the configuration on the left which\n\nhas an expanding anode. Results reported in reference I showed that perform\xc2\xad\nance depends on pressure in the electrode region and the configuration shown\n\non the right was developed to increase pressure in the electrode region at\n\nlow mass flow. The increased pressure at low mass flow will help to avoid\n\nelectrode erosion and gas entrainment.\n\nA study of various plasma parameters versus mass flow and tank pressure\n\nrange was presented in reference 1 for the open anode configuration. Four2\n\n.conditions of arc2current and magnetic 2 field were used; 300 amp , 0.15 W/\n\nand 500 amps, 0.3 W/m . At each\n\n300 amps, 0.3 W/m ; 500 amps, O.15 W/m\nJB conditions the vacuum system was operated at three\n\nof these four constant\ndifferent pumping speeds: 26,000, 1,200 and 340 liters per second, and at each\n\npumping speed the mass flow was varied from 0.03-0 g/sec of argon. This yielded\n\n3 pressure ranges of: 0.001-0.0001 tor, 0.01-0.006 torr, and 0.1-0.11 torr.\n\nAt each condition voltage and thrust were measured and the velocity calculated\n\nfrom the measured thrust and mass flow. For each of the 12 operating conditions,\n\n2 currents, 2 magnetic fields, and 3 pressure ranges the variation of thrust,\n\narc voltage and 1/2 mv2 /eV with mass flow were plotted. As the maximum mass\n\nflow was 0.03 g/sec of argon, and the maximum current was 300 amperes, the\n\nratio J/e/g/m ) 4 for all operating conditions.\n\nmv2\n\neIm1\nFigure 2 shows f V, thrust, arc voltage, and pressure, versus mass flow\n\nfor-one of the operating conditions, i.e., 300 amperes, 0.3 W/m and the low\xc2\xad\npressure range. The pressure variation is due only to the mass flow and\n\npumping speed and is the same for all currents and magnetic fields. In this\n\nfigure it can be seen that thrust decreases and voltage increases with de\xc2\xad\ncreasing mass flow, for J and B constant. Thus, the thrust cannot be\n\npurely electromagnetic and the voltage is not set solely by the gas used and\n\nthe magnetic field. It should be pointed out that if the thrust was purely\n\nelectromagnetic and remained constant with decreasing mass flow that the kinetic\n\nenergy would increase as the reciprocal of the mass flow and that for constant\n\ncurrent the voltage would have to increase with decreasing mass flow to keep\n\nthe efficiency less than 100 percent.\n\n\n65\n\n\nThe measurements in reference 1 showed that electrode erosion and gas\n\nentrainment could effect thrust measurements at certain operating conditions.\n\nIt appears the discharge operation is controlled by-pressure in the electiode\n\nregion and that this pressure is set by gas entrainment at low mass flow and\n\nhigh tank pressure and by electrode erosion at very low mass flow and low to\n\n\nmedium tank pressure. This is also a region at moderate mass flow about\n\n0.008 g/sec argon and at low tank pressure where the thrust measurements may\n\ngive accurate velocities. These regions were checked with Langmuir probe\n\nvelocity measurements and the results were presented in reference 2. The\n\n\nratio of directed to thermal ion saturation currents and the electron tem\xc2\xad\nperature were measured. The equation v = 0.6f\'r\n1i where Ill and IL\n\nare the directed and thermal ion saturation curents\nT\nis the ,electron\n\ncurrents and 0.6 is an empirical factor that was used toecaliulate the velocity.\n\nmv\n\n-\n 2\n\n\n111\n\nTypical results are shown in figure 3 where\nversus distance from axis.\n\n-\n\nand\n\nAlthough values above one for\n\neV\n1/2 eV\n\nare plotted\nare found,\n\naefud\n\nthis \t ay be due to errors in measurement of T e and improved techniques of\n\nm\nmeasuring Te are currently in use and are being reported in reference 6.\n\n\nCurrently, measurements are being performed on the accelerator shown on\n\nthe right in figure 1. The constricted anode helps keep the pressure high in\n\nthe electrode region at low mass flow and thus entrainment and erosion can be\n\nreduced at low mass flow.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

M. Hoell, Jr., D. R. Brooks, and R. H. Weinstein\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\nDetailed surveys are being conducted in a hollow cathode Hall\n\ncurrent accelerator to determine radial and axial potential distributions\nin the exhaust plasma at various operating conditions. A knowledge of\nthe potential distribution is necessary for analyzing the accelerating\nmechanism. The hollow cathode accelerator shown in figure 1, utilizes a\nhollow tungsten cathode and a concentric carbon ring anode to produce\nan argon are discharge in a diverging magnetic field. Separate controls\nallow argon to be injected through each electrode to assess the affect\nof the mode of gas injection on the potential distribution. Operating\n(1) total mass flows from\nconditions of the present accelerator are:\n.0157 g/sec to .0018 g/sec.; (2) arc currents ranging from 50 amps up\nto 300 amps; (3) magnetic fields ranging from 00 gauss to 3000 gauss;\n(4) tank pressures from 9 X 10 - 4 to 5 X 1 0Torr.\nRadial and axial surveys are being made using cylindrical Iangmuir\nprobes with parallel and perpendicular alignment to plasma flow. The\nprobes are mounted on a probe driving mechanism which allows accurate\nposition correlated data to be obtained. Langnuir probe characteristics\nare recorded and analyzed utilizing the data acquisition system described\nin reference 1. The local floating potential with respect to the refer\xc2\xad\nence electrode and the electron temperature can be obtained from the\n(axwellian distributions have been found for\nprobe characteristics.\nall operating conditions studied so far.) The local plasma potential\ncan be determined by calculating the difference between floating and\nplasma potential (this will in general be different from the measured\nfloating potential which is with respect to the reference electrode)\nand algebraically adding this difference to the measured floating\npotential. The floating potential, found by equating the ion current\nand electron current, is given by\n\nVf 2e !eexp\n\nm\ni.. e\n\nj\n\ni\n\n(where k is Boltnnann\'s constant, e is the electronic charge,\nTe is electron temperature, me/m i is the ratio of electron to ion mass,\nLaframboise 2 has\nand mp is a normalized non-dimensional ion-current).\ncalculated the value of ap for cylindrical probes as a function of\npotential, ratio of probe radius to Debye length, and of ratio of ion\nand electron temperature.\nIn general the correct value of ap for given\nplasma parameters must be obtained through an iterative process.\n\n72\n\n.At this writing preliminary surveys have been made only for equal\nmass flows through each electrode. Figure 2 shows only floating potential\ndistribution with respect to cathode potential for two equal mass flow\nconditions corresponding to total mass flows of .0157 grams/see and\n.ooi8 grams/sec. The correction of the floating potential to plasma\npotential (discussed above) has not been obtained for all data points.\nConversion of floating potential to plasma potential for several data\npoints on the low total mass flow curves indicate that a radial gradient\nof approximately 8 volts/cm exists at an axial distance of 4.cm from\nthe accelerator exit, while at an axial distance of 12 em from the exit\nno radial gradient exists. The correction to plasma potential for the\nIt should be\nhigh total mass flow curves have not been obtained.\npointed out that while the high mass flow curves do not show a radial\ngradient in floating potential, this dbes not mean that one does not\nexist in the plasma potential, since variation in\' Te across the jet\nwould produce a radial gradient in the computed plasma potential.\nAt present, work on the potential surveys is continuing. Experiments\nbeing conducted in a hollow cathode are et which has a slightly\nare\ndifferent configuration than the one shown in figure 1. In the new\nconfiguration, the cathode tip has been extended to a position midway of\nthe anode and 1.6 cm in front of the forward edge of-the magnetic coil.\nThe anode has also been extended so that the forward edge is now flush\n\nwith the accelerator exit. In the new configuration the arc attaches\n\nitself consistently inside the hollow cathode.\n\nPlasma potential distributions will be obtained for various modes\nof propellant injection (i.e. equal mass flow through each electrode,\n\nanode mass flow > cathode mass flow and anode mass flow < cathode mass\nflow) with arc current and magnetic field as parameters. Emitting\nprobes will also be used to measure the plasma potential. The results\nof these measurements will be presented at the Fifth Intracenter and\nContractor Conference on Plasma Physics if available, or in a future\npublication.\n\n\n1 Brooks,\n\nD.

Sidney, R. V. Hess and P. Brockman\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe purpose of the analysis is to obtain a better understanding of the\n\nexperimental results given in reference I and to evaluate possible mechanisms\n\n\nfor achieving efficiencies in excess of SO percent. The experiments have\n\nbeen designed to check the possible existence of kinetic energies in excess\n\nof the,applied or available voltage. The plasma stream produced by the MPD\n\narc in argon at low mass flow is fully ionized when operating at high powers\n\n(ref. 2). The experiments further show some variation of thrust and voltage\n\nwith mass flow for constant values of J and B indicating that the thrust\n\nis not purely electromagnetic. The experiments and the analysis thus pertain\n\nto an operating regime where some of the key problems of the MPD arc make\n\ntheir appearance. A possibility of reaching efficiencies in excess of 50\n\npercent is also related to that regime as discussed in references 3 and 4.\n\nThe approach taken for analysis of the experiments is to start with\n\ncareful evaluation of each term of the total energy equation in its complete\n\nform (ref. 5) for monatomic gases\n\neV\n\nwhere\n\n+ ev k/+\n5\n\na = 1 for full ionization and\n\nV0~2 +V2+V2+\n\n+\n\nZ = 1\n\n+y\n\ni\n\n)\n\n\nfor the singly ionized atoms.\n\nIn order to understand the meaning of the individual kinetic energy terms\n\nthe case is discussed first of a special MPD arc configuration where the plasma\n\nwould be put into rotation which can subsequently be converted into directed\n\nmotion. It has not been realized in some papers where this mechanism is\n\npostulated that for E/B drift motion 1/2 m(E/B)2 would be stored for large\n\nion slip in rotational Larmor motion in addition to the same amount in average\n\ndrift motion. Thus the upper limit of the total stored energy would be\n\nm(E/B) 2 . The random energy stored in the Larmor motion can be alternately\n\naccounted for as ion thermal motion. The inclusion of the energy stored in\n\nrandom ion Larmor motion and also in electron random energy could result in\n\nefficiencies in excess of 50 percent if these energies can be converted into\n\naxial kinetic energy. The heat losses, ionization energy and unrecovered\n\nrandom energy must, of course, be included in the considerations. In order to\n\nprove the existence of such mechanism ion temperature-would have to be measured.\n\nElectron temperatures of the order of SeV have been found two inches outside of\n\nthe electrode region for the configuration used in the experiments of reference 1.\n\nIf it is assumed that the energies in the g. and r directions are small\n\nbecause they have been recovered or were initially small, the term vz2/2 can\n\nbe-conveniently expressed through the thrust T = tv.,_ which after regrouping\n\n\nof equation (1) is of the form\n\n\n(6\n\nk1/2\n)\n\n[2~~~~\n~ ULI\nT\n\nm\n\n"\n\n" --\n\n]JV\n](2)\n\nThe possible contributions of the individual terms under the square\nroot to the deviation from- purely electromagnetic thrust\nwill be discussed. The influence of large electron currents will\nbe enluated for the experiments of reference 1 by expressing equatioh (2)\nin terms of the ratio (J)/U!e/p) which fs eqgal to (Jir+Jer)/Jiz for\nfully ionized plasmas. The specific conditions of the experiment where\n>4 will be discussed.\n-\n\nThe i nfluence of electron currenes on attainment of kinetic -energies\n\nin excess of the applied or available voltage has also been analyzed by\n\nsolving the differential equations for motion of ions and electrons in\n\ncrossed E and B including the collision terms. This problem has been\n\nalso approached in reference 6, however, the radial component of ion motion\n\nwas neglected and thus the important effects of the relative magnitudes of\n\nion Larmor radius and electrode gap were not evaluated.\n\nFinally, the influence of ionization and transport properties (charge\n\nexchange cross-sections, etc.) on ion slip and the acceleration process has\n\nbeen analyzed in some detail.- This is especially important in view of the\n\nfrequently used assumption that when the MPD arc operates with partially\n\nionized plasmas, ions and neutrals will not interact and the thrust is\n\npurely dueto the ions. Thevalidity of this assumption is being investi\xc2\xad\ngated for various mass flows \'and acceleration mechanisms using various\n\ngases and pressures in the acceleration region.\n\n1 Brockman,\n\nP., Hess, R.

Lithium injection\nwas achieved by varporizing lithium in a resistance .heated feed tube\nand by feeding the vapor to a distribution manifold in the tungsten\nanode (fig. 1). Visual inspection of the lithium flow simulated ith\nsmoke or water showed that good distribution through the eight feed\nholes was obtained (fig. 2). Stable operation was achieved and electrode\nand insulator erosion was negligible.\nLithium flow was selected in the\nrange of .02 to .05 gram per second for preliminary operation of the\nsystem.\n\nRefinement of the lithium mass flow measurement system to obtain\naccurate metering in range of .01 grams per second is progressing.\nLiquid lithium is metered into the vaporizing tube from a reservoir by\na manually controlled valve t(fig. 3). The lithium is displaced in the\nreservoir by argon at several atmospheres pressure.

Morse\nhas attempted to solve the problem exactly, determining the coMplex\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions and has arrived at the conclusion that\nan instability is also possible for the density gradient against the\ndirection of the electric field.\nIt is noted that in all the treatments of this instability the\ninertial term has been ignored and quasi-neutrality has been used instead.\nThis does not seem to affect the conclusions of Simon and Roh within the\nThis, however, leads to\nframework of their approximate procedure.\nequations in Morse\'s treatment, so that the con\xc2\xad\nincorrect eigenvalue\nclusions of the latter are unreliable, in particular that an instability\nis possible for the density gradient against the direction of the electric\nfield.\nTwo observations are significant in connection with the observed\n(1) the instability is found to exist all along the length\ninstability:\naccelerator; (2) the instability appears even at as low a\nof the\nmagnetic field as 10 G, and kinetic pressure -2 - 30g.

R. Brooks and J. M. Hoell, Jr.\n\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe objective of present Langmuir probe studies is to measure spatial\n\ndistributions of ion flow velocities and plasma potential for a large range\n\nof operating conditions. Since both of these measurements depend critically\n\non electron temperature distributions, suitable techniques have been de\xc2\xad\nveloped for measurement of electron temperature in an environment which can\n\n3\nbe summarized as follows: (1) electro density of I011 \n 1013 /cm ,\n\n(2)magnetic fields on the order of 10 gauss, (3) supersonic flow velocities\n\nseveral times larger than the ionic sound velocity based on electron tem\xc2\xad\nperature. Preliminary results of potential measurements and the application\n\nof the detailed electron temperature surveys described here to potential\n\nmeasurements in a hollow cathode Hall current plasma accelerator are discussed\n\n1\n\nin a companion abstract.\nBecause of the high heat load on the probes, and the necessity for good\n\nspatial resolution, an accurate driving mechanism has been developed that is\n\ncapable of moving probe assemblies with three degrees of freedom at speeds\n\ngreater than 1 inch/sec. This device not only provides a simple way of ob\xc2\xad\ntaining large quantities of position-correlated data, but also keeps to a\n\nminimum the time spent by the probe in the discharge region.\n\nThe circuit of figure I has been used at a frequency of 60 cps for ob\xc2\xad\ntaining probe curves at the rate of about 100 per inch in the radial direction.\n\nData are recorded at several axial positions for each operating condition.\n\nNet probe current is circuit-limited to about 100 mA in the case of the hollow\n\ncathode accelerator. For the small wire probes used, this value is large\n\nenough to achieve ion current saturation but keeps excessive electron current\n\nfrom heating the probes to emission temperature. It is generally recognized\n\nthat in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the portion of the Langmuir\n\nprobe curve due to low energy electrons cannot be used for temperature\n\nmeasurement. For this reason, restricting the net probe current (thereby\n\nlosing the low energy end of the electron curve) causes no loss of information.\n\nHowever, in this case the ion current must be subtracted from the net current,\n\nsince the determination of the electron temperature involves only the elec\xc2\xad\ntron current. This procedure is not so important in cases where no magnetic\n\n\nfield is present, since in that case a portion of the probe curve can be used\n\nin which the ion current is negligible with respect to the electron current.\n\n\nThe standard method of extrapolating the saturation ion current into the\n\nregion of the probe curve where the electron current becomes large and sub\xc2\xad\ntracting this extrapolated value from the net current has been put o a\n\nrelatively sound theoretical basis. The summarizing article of Chen and the\n\nrecent work of Laframboise 3 have shown how the ion saturation cdirrent can be\n\npredicted under various conditions. Laframboise has shown that as long as\n\n\n86\nof\n\nthe probe voltage is-much less than the plasma potential, the variation\nThis variation has been obtained from\n\nion current with voltage is small. \n\nthe ion saturation part of the curve.\n\n\'Figure 2 shows a flow diagram for computer analysis of recorded probe\n\n100 points\n\ndata. \nDigitization of the tape yields a resolution-of more than\nout high frequency noise in the\n\nper curve, which is sufficient for averagingr\naccelerator. \n The original data are plotted along with a computer-generated\n\nstraight \'linefit to the ion saturation current. The- extrapolation of this\n\nline is the ion current which is subtracted from the net current to yield\n\nelectron current. The log of the electron current versus voltage and the\n\nthe\n\nbest straight line fit to this log curve is plotted. This slope gives in\xc2\xad\nOf course, visual\nelectron temperature for Maxwellian distributions.\nspection of both of these curves is necessary. In the case of the ion satura\xc2\xad\nc\ntion \t urrent fit, a distortion of the slbpe-can result from noisy data or\n\nusing too many or too few points for the fit. In the case of the electron\n\ncurrent, it is mandatory to assure that the log of the electron current versus\n\n\'the voltage is,, in fact, a straight line because the computing scheme forces\n\nnot\n\nupon the data an analysis based on Maxweltian distributions which is of\n\nplots\nvalid for other distribution functions. Excellent straight line\nlog \t Ie versus voltage have been obtained so far.\n\n-\n\nThe manner of data recording and reduction described-here has been de\xc2\xad\nveloped for the-purpose of handling large quantities of data in an objective\n\nfashion. The ideas utilized have been combined in a system ,which is capable\n\nof providing the detailed surveys which are required in the analysis-of the\n\nhigh energy plasma streams under study. The computer program is flexible\n\nenough to include refinements to theory as needed. Future plans call for a\n\nmore exact application of the ion current theory of Laframboise. This will\n\ninclude effects due to the ratios of ion to electron,energy and probe radius\n\nto Debye length although these effects require modification in the presence\n\nof a magnetic field. It should be emphasized that inclusion of such refine\xc2\xad\nments is impractical in a project of this magnitude unless tape recording\n\nand computing techniques are used for the accumulation and analysis of data.\n\nFuture work will also include an examination of time fluctuations in the\n\nto\n\nquantities being measured, as these can be helpful in understanding how\nare made on the assumption\n\naverage the results of probe measurements which\nthat average variations correspond to spatial nonuniformities and not to\n\nchanges with time in arc conditions.\n\ntReferences:\n\nHoell, Jr., J.

Hess, N. Jalufka\n\nand J. Burlock\n\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nOptical methods of measurement are being employed in the co-axial Hall\ncurrent plasma accelerator. These include spectroscopic measurements of\n\ndegree of ionization, electron temperature, and ion velocity by the Doppler\n\nshift method. Techniques using laser radiation are being developed for\n\ntime of flight and Doppler shift velocity measurements. The accelerator\n\nis operated with an argon mass flow rate ot 0.01 gram per second and a\nvacuum chamber pressure about 2 x 10-2 Torr. The arc current is kept\nconstant at 300 amperes, the arc voltage at 40 volts; and the magnetic\n\nfield at 3000 gauss.\n\nDegree of Ionization.- Spectroscopic observations for determining the\n\ndegree of ionization of the plasma have been made both end-on and side-on\n\nwith respect to the plasma stream (fig. 1).\nFrom the resulting spectrograms,\n\nspectral lines of singly ionized argon (AII) and doubly ionized argon (AIII)\n\nhave been identified. Contamination lines exist in the end-on views and in\n\nside-on views close to the anode, but the lines disappear at distances S\ncentimeters or greater downstream from the anode. The AIII lines appear to\n\nexist with approximately the same intensity as the AII lines. Identification\n\nof spectral lines from side-on views 25 centimeters downstream from the front\n\nface of the anode shows that the AIII lines remain strong. Absence of AI\n\nlines from spectrograms obtained by both end and side observations indicates\nthat the plasma may be fully ionized.\nElectron Temperature Measurements.- Electron temperature determinations\nare made on the basis that the appearance of a characteristic spectral line\nin a steady-state plasma provides an indication of the corresponding electron\ntemperature. However, calculations have shown that the plasma is not in\nequilibrium, since the time required for ionization is greater than the\nresidence time of the plasma in the accelerator. Hence, if the electron\ntemperature is increasing in the anode region, then the temperature obtained\nby the spectral line idefitification method\' is a lower limit to the equilib\xc2\xad\nrium temperature, that is, the equilibrium temperature has not been reached\nand excitation has not stabliized.\' Since thermal non-uniformities exist\nboth axially at some distance downstream and- radially, the measured temperature\nwill instead be a range of temperatures corresponding to a hot inner region\n\nin addition to cooler outer layers.\nThe decaying end of the plasma stream\nas well as the accelerator region is observed in the end-on view, while the\nexpanding outer plasma as well as the inner core is seen in the side-on view.\nThese thermal non-uniformities prevent the line intensity ratio method of\ntemperature measurement from being made axially, while a lower limit temp\xc2\xad\nerature may be obtained radially by the ratio method with the aid of an\nAbel inversion.\n\n\n9o\n\n\nCalculations of spectral line intensities \tof excited states of A1, All,\n\nAt, and AIV give the relation of the line intensities to the electron\ntemperatures and allows interpretation of the data over the temperature range\nof interest. The attenuation of the spectral line intensity by optical com\xc2\xad\n2\nponents in\'the system is such, that if the emitted line intensity is a factor\ni/100 lesthan the maximum value it can attain as a function of temperature,\nthen it wil in all probability not be seen on the spectrographic plate.\nConversely, line intensities greater than \t1/100 of their maximun intensities\nmay be seen. Therefore, in interpreting the data using figure 2, the low\nend of the temperature range is obtained by using the increasing part of\nthe All intensity curve at 1/100 of the maximum intensity, or 1.5 eV\n(17,000 OK). \n The upper end of the range is the temperature corresponding to\nthe increasing part of the AIV curve which is 1/100 of the maximum intensity,\n\nintense AIII\n\nor 3.4 eV (I0,000 oK). It is important to note, however, that\nhence a temperature\nlines indicate that AIV levels are becoming populated, and\nhigher than 3.4 eV is suggested. Higher estimates may not be made, though,\nuntil positive identification of the AIV lines is made. Since the AIV lines\naccessible with the optical path in the atmosphere exist in regions where\ncontamination lines interfrte, vacuum spectroscopy is required to find lines\nfarther down into the ultraviolet region.\n\nIon Velocity by fopper Shift Method.- Axial ion velocities are being\ndetermined from the Doppiler shifts of the emitted spectral lines. A low\npressure argon lamp is used to produce Al \t reference lines for measuring the\nshift of All lines in the plasma. Since the end-on observation penetrates\nthe entire plasma, velocity measurements determined from these Doppler shifts\nare not spatially resolved. The velocities thus measured then are at best\naverage velocities. Only the Doppler shifts of AII lines near the Al refer\xc2\xad\nence lines have been measured. The measurements so far yield velocities on\n\nthe order of 10,000 meters per second. Some experiments for measuring the\n\noppiler shifts of AIII lines were made with the use of an iron are as a\n\nreference source. AIM lines originate in the accelerator region, so it\nwas believed that measurements of AiI \n line shifts would provide a reasonable\ndegree of spatial resolution for the velocities. As mentioned previously,\n\nhowever, side-on observations of the plasma revealed AII lines 25 centimeters\nHence, velocity measurements\n-downstream from the front face of the anode.\nfrom AiT \n lines would not provide spatially resolved velocities much better\nthan those from AII lines.\n\nUse of Lasers for Velocity Measurements.-\t Lasers will be used to excite\nions with frequencies near the laser frequency for local spectroscopic\nvelocity measurements. \n Velocities have been measured at higher.pressures by\nionizing a gas with a pulsed laser and measuring the velocity of the ionized\n\n.region using photographic techniques and probes.1 The laser ionizing pro\xc2\xad\ncess is not effective at low pressures. However, excitation of particles\n\nwith the same frequency as that of the laser photons is possible. Spectra\xc2\xad\nscopic techniques may then be used to isolate the excited line so that it\nmay be used to detect motion. The experimental arrangement is shown in\nfigure 1. A giant (125 1W) Q-switched ruby laser wit a frequency multiplier\nis used to obtain a laser out-put -avelength of 3472 A. The laser beam is\nfocused to a point inside the plasma stream to excite ions emitting the\n\n91\n\n\n3472 R All line. A monochromator fixed on 3472 A will observe the laser\npulse, and with the aid of a half-silvered mirror, vill observe the\nradiating ion as it passes a given point dovnstream. The time between\nthe phototube observations of the spectral line at the two positions will,\nbe recorded on an oscilloscope and the velocity determined directly.\nDoppler shift measurements of the excited particles will also be made.\n\n1 Chen,\n\nChe Jen, "Experimental Study of Breakdown Phenomena in Argon Gas\nby a laser Beam at Low Pressure."

Burlock and T. M. Collier\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe linear Hall accelerator, because of its uniform geometry and fi6ld\n\ndistribution, is being used for study of processes that affect the efficiency\n\nof the closely related coaxial accelerator now under development at the\n\nLangley Research Center. The processes of most interest are the anomalous\n\nconductivity, associated with plasma fluctuations. Previous work at Langley\n\n(ref. 1) and other laboratories (ref. 2, 3) has shown the presence of both\n\ncoherent and random potential and density fluctuations, and a probable\n\nmechanism for the coherent part has been discussed (ref. 4). Anomalous con\xc2\xad\nduction, referred to on occasion as "electron back-streaming" or "electron\n\nback-flow" limits the efficiency of plasma devices that depend on current\n\ncontrolled by magnetic fields. The effectiveness of the magnetic field in\n\ncontrolling current is measureable in these experiments by the ratio of\n\ntransverse to Hall current, neglecting ion slip\n\nJ.1 \t ee\n\nH\nwhere\n\nw\n\nis electron cyclotron frequency,\n\nmomentum transfer,\n\nVe\n\nTe\n\nis eledtroi mobility and\n\nis collision time for\n\nB\n\nis magnetic field.\n\n\nThe fact that the ratio is not necessarily as predicted has been related\n\nto instabilities that produce correlated density and velocity fluctuations\n\n(ref. 5). Measurements of these quantities has generally been done with\n\nelectrostatic probes and Langmuir probes operating in the ion saturation\n\nregion. However, saturation ion flux to the probe is controlled by both the\n\nplasma density, and a velocity depending on probe sheath conditions. For\n\nthe present experiments these result in a probe current\n\n\nkT /2\n\nJ.\n\n=\n cne\n\n\nwhere T is electron temperature, k is Boltzmann\'s constant, m. is ion\n\nmass, ana the value of c depends on the sheath condition. The large fluc\xc2\xad\ntuating potentials present in the plasma, produce associated electric field\n\nthat could increase the ion velocity and add to the ion saturation current.\n\nA plasma density measuring technique sensitive to plasma density only, would\n\nallow separation of the density and velocity components of ion flux.\n\nA microwave system using a short antenna and coaxial construction\n\nsimilar to reference 6 has been developed for obtaining both average and fluctu\xc2\xad\nat&ng components of plasma density (fig. 1). Simultaneous measurements of\n\n\n96\nflux, using the same probe, allow determination of ion velocity. To\n\navoid complications resulting from resonance at electron plasma fre\xc2\xad\nqencyr, and the effect of magnetic field on the plasma conductivity,\n\na frequency higher than the maximum electron plasma resonance frequency\n\nand much higher than the maximum electron cyclotron frequency have been\n\nchosen. The microwave detector system is arranged as a reflectometer.\n\nPlasma density changes produce impedance variations at the antenna, (fig. 2)\n\nchanging the amount of reflected wave power. The antenna\'is in the form\n\nof a short stub, 1/16 wavelength long.- This presents a,capacitive im\xc2\xad\npedance (ref. 7) to the system\nneh\nin-. I\nwhere h and a are probe length ak.radius, respectively,\nand -e is the plasma dielectric constant:\n\n\n=\n\no\n\n.\n\nThe small size of the antenna produces an electric field configuration which\n\nmakes the system sensitive only in the immediate vicinity of the exposed stub.\n\nExploratory sweeps, with perturbing conductors of different shapes, indicate\n\na sensitive region of about the diameter of the outer conductor of the coaxial\n\nstructure of the probe, one-eighth inch. To minimize power loss, aproblem\n\nbecause of the small coaxial-cross section, small suppor~t beads, are used\n\nrather than a dielectric filling. The microwave antenna also serves simul\xc2\xad\ntaneously either as a biased Langmuir probe, or potential probe, for ob\xc2\xad\ntaining correlated measurements of density, ion flux, and potential. Electro\xc2\xad\nstatic coupling to the microwave system was reduced by introducing a thin\n\ninsulating plate between waveguide secti6ns. In addition to fluctuation\n\namplitudes, average values of the ion saturation current from the Langmuir\n\nprobe and microwave system are recorded for information on depth of modulation.\n\nA sensor coil surrounds the accelerator for determining the value of Hall\n\ncurrent. This gives information on weTe of the plasma in the magnetic field\n\nand-can be interpreted to give plasma density.\n\nA limited number of runs covering a restricted range of parameters has\n\nbeen made with the complete .system, so far. The frequency response has been\n\nlimited to 100 kilocycles, to allow visual estimate of phase correlation.\n\nThe runs have been taken in sets with constant current of 3 amperes and\n\nvariable magnetic field,, 100 - 700 gauss, and also constant magnetic field\n\nof about 100 gauss and variable current of 3 to 22 amperes, at 0.1 and 0.03 Tortr.\n\nThe following preliminary observations may be made on the basis of this\n\ndata: In the range of parameters used, the value of Hall current tends to\n\nremain cohstant with increase in magnetic field. This is accompanied by an\n\n\n97\n\n\nincrease of both coherent and random noise. The random noise covers the\n\nwhole frequency spectrum to the 100 kc limit of the filtering which has\n\nbeen introduced. At constant magnetic field and variable current, the\n\nratio of Hall current to axial current remains fairly constant. The co\xc2\xad\nherent oscillation amplitude increases, but the random noise is quite small.\n\n\nThe comparative effects on the conduction of coherent low pressures oscillations\n\nand.high frequency noise mtist be evaluated. On the result will also de\xc2\xad\npend the applicability of the approach in reference5 which emtphasizes the\n\ninfluence of the higher frequency noise on the conduction process. The parameter\n\nrange covered has not as yet been extended to higher currents, over a variation\n\nof magnetic field strengths which give the full range of effects on me Te\n(ref. 8).\nReferences:\n\n1.

In\naddition to the collective nature of the plasma described by the Debye\n\npole for m < C p, the "streaming nature" of the Vlasov operator manifests\nitself in a branch-line integral vihere the branch-line lies along the\ncontinuum of eigenvalues in the k-plane.

These calculations are viewed as an "experiment"\n\nagainst which the predictions of theory can be checked; both equilibrium,\n\nfluctuations and nonequilibrium relaxation effects are studied. Times are\nscaled to the plasma frequency and velocities are scaled to <v2>. The\npresent method is approximate and differs from a previous study of the\nsame problem1 in that a fixed-incremental time step At in the equations\nof motion permits an average of several crossings per particle per cycle.\nIn this way it was hoped to speed up the calculations for plasmas with\nlarge nD\' (number of particles per Debye distance).\nSince the electric field E seen by a particle depends on the excess\ncharge it sees around it, particle crossings change the field during the\nmotion and make it inexact. The total energy is, therefore, no/recisly\nconserved and the deviation shows up as an increase in the kinetic energy.\nIf, however, the equations of motion are completed to second order in At\nby adding an A term to the velocity equation, the total energy growth is\ndrastically reduced and is typically 0.036%/wp - 1 for nD=20 and\n\np\n\n-l\n\nAT =,At wP - = 0.1.

C. Grant and M. R. Feix\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nIntroduction\n\nVarious transformations of the Vlasov equations have been used. Among\n\nthese are the Fourier-Laplace transform of the coordinate-time space; Hermite\n\ntransform of the velocity space alone; and Fourier-Fourier transform of the\n\ncoordinate-velocity space. All of the transformations avoid a difficulty of\n\nthe coordinatevelocity space, namely, an oscillatory and secular growth of\n\nthe solutions in the velocity space. However\', new difficulties arise in the\n\ntransforme spaces which are associated with cutoff of the representation in\n\nthe transformed space.\n\nThe Fourier-Hermite transformation of the coordinate-velocity space has\n\nan advantage in that it leads to ordinary differential equations, but again\n\nthere are difficulties associated-with the necessity to limit the transformed\n\nspace. A limitation on the time of good representation arises which is a\n\nfunction of the size of the subspace used after transformation and on the\n\namplitude of the disturbance of the plasma which is considered. There is a\n\nlimitation of the wave lehgth which favors the longer waves. \n In the linear\xc2\xad\nized limit of the F-H transform just the wave length limitation and the\n\ncutoff of the transformed velocity space are operative. The analysis has\n\nbeen limited to the one-dimensional nonlinear Vlasov equation for the motion\n\nof electrons against a uniform positive neutralizing background.\n\nFourier-Hermite Transformation\n\nThe F-H transformation of the Vlasov equations corresponds to a double\n\nseries expansion of the distribution function followed by substitution into\n\nthe Vlasov equation which yields a doubly infinite set of ordinary first\xc2\xad\norder differential equations in the time for the histories of the expansion\n\ncoefficients. These coefficients may be regarded as the elements of a matrix\n\n\n\nand truncation of the matrix to a finite size corresponds to keeping a finite\n\nnumber of Fourier components, or wavelengths, as well as a finite number of\n\nHermite functions, or velocity moments. Since macroscopic quantities of\n\ninterest depend on moments of low order in velocity space the expectation was\n\nthat truncation at low order in the Hermite space would be unimportant for\n\nreasonable time intervals.\n\nLinearized Lifit\n\nThe ordinary linearized theory of the Vlasov equation corresponds, in\n\nthe F-H transformation, to retention of two rows ,of the matrix: \n one corres\xc2\xad\nponding to the uniform base velocity distribution which does not change; the\n\nNAS-NRC Senior Post-Doctoral Resident Research Associate\n\n\n116\n\nother corresponding to an"inhomogeneous perturbation, of the plasma. The\ngeneral dispersion relation of the linearized F-H analysis may be written\n\ndown in terms of a-certain set of polynomials. Two interesting.special\n\ncases have been analyzed in some detail: Maxwell\'s distribution, and a\n\ndouble streaming distribution. For Maxwell\'s distribution it turns out\n\nthat all the eigenfrequencies are real which makes contact with the work\n\n-of Van Kampen. the set of eigenfrequencies is finite, h6wever, which\n\nraises the question: How is Landau\'s damping to be recovered? Calculations\n\nfor the case of one hundred eigenvalues have shbwn the tendendy of the\n\nanalysis to converge toward the result obtained in VanKampen\'s limit of\n\na continuum of eigenvalues. For the double streaming case, imaginary eigen\xc2\xad\nfrequencies appear. Comparison with the results in an unlimited velocity\n\n.space show convergence .toward the.-limiting growth rate curve except in the\n\nregion -of the short wave length cutoff where anomalous behavior appears.\n\nThe correct wavelength of \'evanescence:of the instability is always provided\n\neven at low \'levels of approximation, but the slopes of the approximate and\n\nlimiting curves-always differ at the wave length of evanescence.\n\nNonlinear Case\n\n.In the linearized cases studied it was found that the longer wave\nlengths received better treatment, and that time limits existed for a given\nwave length beyond which the representation became inaccurate\'. In.the non\xc2\xad\nlinear-case "it has been found that, in addition, relatively weak disturbances\nmust be usled or the representation rapidly deteriorates. By means of\nnumerical,calculations the boundaries of the parameter regions in which the\ntruncated-.nonlinear F-H analysis is accurate are being explored.\\ In particular,\nthe times of good representation corresponding to -retention of different \xc2\xad\norders of Hermite function are being calculated.\n\nNOimOMOGEIIEOUS PLASMA IMflETIC THEORY\nBy Leo D. Staten and Marc R. Feix+\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe problem of oscillations in nonhomogeneous, collisionless, one\xc2\xad\ndimensional plasmas is being studied by means of a linear integral\n\nequation derived from the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The integral equation\nis the counterpart for nonhomogeneous plasmas of the usual dispersion\nequation for homogeneous plasmas, but because of its greater complexity\nsignificant progress can be made only by treating spcific cases.\nA specific case of much theoretical interest is that stationary\nsolution of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations whose distribution function is\nconstant for energies less than some prescribed value and zero elsewhere.\nThe integral equation for oscillations in such a plasma, just as for a\n\ncold plasma, is rigorously reducible to a differential equation analogous\n\nto that obtained in fluid theory discriptions of plasmas.\n\nUsual linearized theory treatments of perturbations about stationary\nplasma states are not concerned with the initial accessibility of the\nstationary state from more general nonstationary states. Interesting\nresults in this regard have been obtained for the specific case at hand.\n\nThe distribution function in x-v space for such a case is constant-(for\na finite system) within some closed curve in the x-v plane and zero\nelsewhere. The time dependent Vlasov equation requires, for a constant\ntotal number of particles, that the area of this curve be constant even\nthough its boundary changes shape in the nonstationary situation. By means\nof a variational principle it has been shown that the stationary state\nbounding curve corresponds to a minimum total energy for the given number\nof particles. Since energy must be conserved, this suggests that, in the\nabsence of the formation of highly singular spikes in the distribution\nfunction, such a stationary state is inaccessible, in general, from a\ngiven initial state. Results from computer experiments at Langley seem\nto lend support to this conclusion. Work is currently underway to find\nwhat conclusion can be drawn about the accessibility of a stationary\'\nstate for more gneral distribution functions.\n\nThe linearized theory of perturbations about the stationary bounding\ncurves has been developed and by a suitable transformation of variables\nan overly stringent requirement on the allowed perturbations, which has\nbeen enforced by previous authors (e.g. ref. 1), has been removed.\nDetailed results are not available at this time, but the expected result\nis that no decay of initial perturbations toward the stationary state will\nbe found.\n+AS-MC\n\nSenior Post-Doctoral Resident Researah Associate.\n\ni18\n\nAll of the above work is based upon collisionless kinetic theory.\nIt is well known that to first order in the reciprocal :of the number of\nparticles in a Debye length collisions have no effect upon the distribution\nfunction of a 6ne-dimensional plasma. Work is now underway to ascertain\nthe effect of collisions in higher order, taking into account some of\nthe aspects of three body correlations in the plasma.\n\nIn.

Feix*\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\n\nand\n\nCollege of William and Mary\n\n\nWe have used a one-dimensional sheet model to investigate the time\n\nbehavior of a gas of stars. The characteristic time in t y consideration\n\nof collective effects in stellar systems is r = (4rGp)\nwhere p\n\nis the mass density and G is the gravitational constant. Irregular\n\nforces due to stellar encounters are negligible for times of the order\n\nof rT. However, through collective effects the system will attempt to\n\nreach a metaequilibrium state in this time interval.\n\nThe stars are representedby identical mass sheets constrained to\n\nmove along the x-axis. We use an electronic computer to follow the\n\nmotion of large numbers of sheets. If the graininess structure of our\n\nsheets is siall enough, our model will in "fact solve the one-dimensional\n\nself-consistent Vlasov equation for a gas of stars. Also the collective\n\nbehavior of the bulk of matter in the one-dimensional system should then\n\nbe equivalent to the three-dimensional case. The fact that the graininess\n\nplays no role has been checked by doubling the number of sheets of a\n\nsystem while keeping its total mass constant. This does not change the\n\nbehavior of the system. Similarly, whether or not the particles have equal\n\nmasses plays no role since the Vlasov equation describes a set of particles\n\nwith different masses as well as with equal masses.\n\nThe collective effects of stellar systems are described-by the\n\nVlasov equation\n\n\nf\nwhere\n\nV r\ny\n\nf\n\n\n4 is obtained from the Poisson equation\n\na\xc2\xa2=\n\nx2\n\n*\n\nax\n\n4 G\n\nf dv. \n\n\n1\nNAS-NRC Senior Post-Doctoral Resident Research Associate\n\n(2)\n\n\n120\n\n\n,From eq. (1)we,obtain the result that the metaequilibrium state of\n\nthe system will be described by a distribution function f(x,v,t -* )\n= F(U) where U =(1!2)mv2 + mo is the total energy ofa star. The\n\nform of F(U) depends on the initial distribution function and must\n\nin general be obtained by following the time development of the nonlinear\n\nVfasov equation., However, there is one type of initial distribution where\n\nF U) is known without actually solvinj the-time dependent Vlasov equation.\n\n-For this distribution the initial f is constant over a certain region\n\nof phase space and is zero outside this region. According to the Liouville\n\ntheorem f will remain constant over a region of phase space so that the\n\nregion-can only change its shape with time while keeping its area constant.\n\nThe ,above initial distribution is of interest .primarily because it allows\n\nlius to calculate exactly the equilibrium configuration of the one-dimensional\n\nstar gas for comparison with the computer results. The results presented\n\nhere are all for such an initial distribution; however, other initial\n\ndistributions give results which are very similar to those pgesented here.\n\nTaking the initial shape of the area in phase space to be a rectangle\n\ndefined by \xc2\xb1x0 and\' - \xc2\xb1v , the steady-state solution is easily obtained.\n\n0\nF(U) has a constant value for 0--.U- < me and is zero for U > Em.

To\'obtain eq. (4)we have only made use of conser\xc2\xad\nvation of entropy or area in phase space. If this state is to be reached\n\nthen the energy of the initial and-final state must also be equal. By\n\nusing a variational method we found that the stationary state described by\n\neq. (4) is a minimum energy state. Thus, starting from. any initial state\n\nother than the equilibrium state the system can never completely reach the\n\nequilibrium state. Nevertheless, the .system does \'its best to approach,the\n\nstationary-state whenever the initial energy is not too far from\'the energy\n\nof the stationary state given by eq. (4)..\n\n\nFig. 1 shows how a system of 2000 "stars" with a ratio of initial\n\nto equilibrium energy of 1.9 approaches its equilibrium configuration\n\nin phase space. While approaching equilibrium the system rotates in\n\nphase space with a frequency near 1/- . After only a few periods,\n\norbital (or phase) mixing has brought he system very\'near the equili\n\nbrium value indicated by the oval in figure l(d). Also the ratio of\n\nkinetic to potential energy isvery nearly equal to 0.5.as required by\n\nthe virial theorem. The behavior indicated in fig. 1 is characteristic\n\nof the time behavior of systems where the initial energy is near the\n\nequilibrium value.

Huber\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nEfforts to understand and alleviate the loss of RF tracking and\n\ncommunications which occurs with reentering space vehicles, due to the\n\nreentry flow field plasmas, are directed in two principal areas of research.\n\nThese are, (1)determination of the flow field plasma properties in terms\n\nof the vehicle shape, attitude, and reentry flight conditions, and (2)\n\neffects of these flow field plasmas on the antenna RF properties and the\n\nem wave propagation in or near the plasmas. Since reentry communications\n\ntypically involves low RF power levels in the plasma, the two parts of\n\nthe problem are uncoupled and hence observations of signal loss under\n\nconditions where one of the two parts can be considered reasonably well\n\nunderstood can lead to a "diagnosis" of the other part. Such data have\n\nbeen obtained from the manned orbital reentries of the Mercury and Gemini\n\nspacecraft and, when evaluated in the light of existing theoretical know\xc2\xad\nledge supplemented also by experimental data from ground facilities, lead\n\nto a greatly improved understanding of the reentry flow field plasmas.\n\nThree types of reentry plasma are pertinent to this blunt body problem,\n\ndepending on the location of antenna on the spacecraft. These are (1) the\n\ninviscid plasma between the bow shock and viscous layers near the vehicle,\n\n(2)the boundary-layer plasma generated at the body surface, and (3) the\n\nnear wake plasmas, including the free shear layer and separated zone. The\n\ninviscid plasma problem for earth reentry is one dominated by air ,chemical\n\nkinetics. At very high altitudes the species production kinetics are\n\ndominant in the problem, while at medium and low altitudes the species re\xc2\xad\ncombination kinetics are dominant when considering the usual aft antenna\n\nlocations. Figure 1 illustrates the importance of recombination kinetics\n\nfor a hypothetical Apollo reentry in which deceleration occurs at medium\n\naltitude. These results were computed using best available rate knowledge\n\nfor each of 46 reactions in the flow. The curves labelled "frozen" and\n\n"equilibrium" are those idealized models generally used to illustrate con\xc2\xad\nceptual limits to the influence of chemical kinetics. However, it is seen\n\nthat such simplified approaches are grossly inadequate from a numerical\n\nstandpoint. The undershoot of complete equilibrium at velocities below\n\n30 k ft/sec is due to the relatively fast ionic recombinations which occur\n\nin the expanded flow which is relatively cold due to frozen neutral chem\xc2\xad\nistry. It would furthermore be seen to be a serious misinterpretation to\n\ndeem the plasma in equilibrium at the points where the finite rate results\n\ncross those for equilibrium. The very striking drop in electron concen\xc2\xad\ntration which occurs at velocities around 31 k ft/sec at this altitude is\n\ndue to the two-body ionic recombinations which can occur at these and lower\n\n\n126\n\n\nvelocities. Such can occur due to the trace of undissociated molecules\n\nand diatomic ions left over from the nose region production processes\n\nwhich, considering also the relatively fast charge transfer, allow for\n\ntwo-body recombination paths for electrons and ions. These recombinations\n\nare ver fast at levels of electron concentration of the order or greater\n\nthan 12 cm 3\n When the concentrations are \'lowerthan this value the rate\n\n.\nslows considerably and becomes "frozen" at values of the order lOll cm-\n.\n\nThe second type (boundary layer) plasma is one in which chemical\n\nkinetics is also an important factor, but the problem is much more complex\n\ndue to a chemistry "contaminated" by ablation products - in addition to the\n\neffects of viscosity, diffusion, etc. Fortunately, the boundary-layer\n\nproblem only becomes first order for blunt body reentries at high altitudes\n\nwheze the thickness is large enough to engulf the nose region flow. It is,\n\nhowever, the dominant plasma in slender body problems at all altitudes, since\n\nthe inviscid layer is not so intensly shock-heated.\n\nThe shear layer and separated tone plasmas can be shown, on the basis\n\nof flight results, to be plasmas of prime importance for blunt bodies\n\nduring certainportions of reentry, depending on Reynolds number, look angle,\n\nand the amount of inviscid two-body recombination. Consider first the\n\n"observations" of electron concentration shown in .figure 2 for Mercury and\n\nGemini reentries. These values are deduced from signal data at times in\n\ntheflights at which attenuation was first detectable and at which "blackout"\n\noccurred foi both signal frequencies shown, as well as for the corresponding\n\nsignal recovery points. The values are derived using an idealized em wave\n\npropagation model which is believed appropriate for these configurations and\n\nsignal conditions. The position along the propagation path (the plasma layer\n\nresponsible for the degradation of signal) is not determined from this data.\n\nTo help establish the pertinent plasmas in the problem, consider next the\n\nNe\'s in the\n\ntheoretical curves shown. The solid lines represent the peak\ninviscid flow at the appropriate antenna locations using finite-rate flow\n\nfield calculations for these bodies. The dashed lines represent the Ne\'s\n\nin the separated zone, which is assumed to be homogeneous pure air in\n\nequilibrium, due to the low velocity and long dwell time of the recirculating\n\nflow. The enthalpy and pressure appropriate to the fluid is taken from\n\nhypersonic tunnel data for these bodies at flight Reynolds numbers. It is\n\nseen that neither the inviscid air nor the separated air theoretical models\n\nwill account for the observations in the c-band attenuation region by a large\n\nNe factor, although in the VHF region the agreement with inviscid air theory\n\nappears good. Now consider the remaining theoretical curve which represents\n\na separated flow model similar to the pure air model, but with an easily\n\nionized species impurity level appropriate to the attached nose flow bound\xc2\xad\n\'ary layer. The species Na and K were assumed present in the boundary\n\nlayer to-an extent determined from the heat shield ablation loss rate, the\n\nalkali impurity level in the heat shield, and the estimated boundary-layer\n\nmass flow. It can be seen that the agreement with the c-band data is very\n\ngood using this model, but that in the high altitude and low velocit- portions\n\n\n127\n\nof reentry the model is not consistent with\nfactor. However, in this model there is no\nand diffusion of impurities in the attached\nmight occur in the-detached shear layer and\nviscous spreading effects would be expected\n\nthe VHF data by a large N\n\nallowance made for mixing\n\nboundary layer flow which\n\nseparated flow region. Such\n\nto be a minimum at high laminar\n\n\nReynolds numbers, and be\'more pronounced at both very low laminar or very\n\n\nhigh turbulent Reynolds numbers.\nXalkBL\nCF = xa\n\n-,BL\n\nIn figure 3, a spreading factor,\n\n\nis introduced which is, in reality, a correlation factor to\n\n\nalkobs\n\n\naccount for spreading of the boundary layer ablation impurities to levels in\n\nthe separated zone which will give agreement.with the observed data through\xc2\xad\nout the reentry. It is seen that this factor does indeed exhibit a strong\n\nReynolds number dependency which is, furthermore, similar to that of other\n\nviscous parameters in which transition occurs. As noted on the figure,\nvalues of a in the VHF portions of reentry may be higher than shown, b~t\n\ncannot be lower, since such a condition would be incompatible with the ob\xc2\xad\nserved signal data. It is interesting to note that these indicated\n\ntransition altitudes are in good agreement with thermocouple data obtained\n\nfor these reentries by the Manned Spacecraft Center, for sensors located\n\nnear the point of boundary layer separation on the leeward flow body side,\n\nwhich is the side appropriate to the signal propagation path for the\n\nattenuation data.\n\n\nAPOLLO,\n\nTYPICAL STREAMLINE\n\nALTITUDE = 175 kft\n\n1015\xc2\xad\n\ntz\n\nFr~ozen\n\n1013 -\n\nNe\n\ncm-\n\nZ\n\n-- X\n-C\n\nFinite-Rate Non-equilibrium\n\n1011-\n\n\'S I\n/\n\nForward Antenna\n\n/\n\nk-Aft Antenna\n\n-\n\n/\xc2\xad\n\n.VHF\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40x1i0 3\n\nFlight Velocity, ft/sec\nHuber 1\n\nG-T, M-A REENTRY PLASMAS\n\n\nVel\n\n1012\nObserved Iet s\nMA\nGT\n\no\n\nAlt\n\n....\n\nC-band\n[10l\nVHF\n\ndo\n\nMA\n\nTheoretical Ne\'s\nNF\nR Inviscid\n- --- Sep.

S. Evans and C. J. Schexnayder, Jr.\n\nNASA Langley Research Center\nHampton, Virginia\n\nMicrowave reflectometer probes developed for the RAM project were\n\nsuccessfully used on the RAM B-3 \nflight to measure shock layer electron\nconcentrations over a wide range of reentry velocities and altitudes.\nThe availability of this data offers a unique opportunity to verify\nthe results of flow field calculations involving non-equilibrium chemical\n\nkinetics and also to determine values for some of the reaction rates to\ncloser limits than heretofore available.\nThe wide range of flight conditions from 140,000 feet to 245,000\nfeet in altitude and from 1,600 ft/sec to 18,150 ft/sec in velocity\nand the great differences in the nature of chemical kinetic processes\n\nas they occur in the hot and relatively dense gas covering the blunt\nnose of the vehicle as compared with the much cooler, expanded gas\nover the afterbody made it possible to analyze the combined theoretical\nand experimental data in considerable depth and, as a result of this,\nthe production and recombination of electrons in the RAM B-5 reentry\nflow field can be discussed in general terms. For example, electrons\nare always produced in the nose cap region and usually approach local\nionic equilibrium values (chemical equilibrium was not reached at any\npoints in the flow fields in any of the calculations made).\nFor the\nlower velocities or for the higher altitudes, even local ionic equili\xc2\xad\nbrium was not approached, and this phenomenon (see fig. 1); which\nresults in greatly lowered electron concentration values, is referred\nto as "production droop." Two versions of the high altitude "production\ndroop" are shown in figure 1. Values of ambient air density from\nstandard atmosphere tables were used for the solid lines. For the\ndotted lines the standard densities were revised to somewhat lower\nvalues to obtain better agreement with experimental data. Electron\nproduction in the "production droop" region is evidently sensitive to\nthe ambient air density.\n\nAnother effect which was always present (see fig. 1)(and which,\n\nincidentally, can be present only when diatomic species are not\n\ncompletely removed by dissociation) is the "self-limiting" effect\nwhich causes electron concentration levels in the expanded afterbody\nregion to decrease very rapidly from any.initial value greater than a\ncertain roughly-defined lower limit until they approach the lower limit\nand after that the decrease in degree of ionization is slow and usually\nnegligible.\n(Decrease in gas density will cause electron concentration\nto decrease further, however.)\n\n(9.\n\n134\nAn important aspect of the theoretical analysis\n\nwas the fact that\n\nit was often possible to determine that, under\ngiven conditions, only\na few reactions (sometimes only one) Vere principally\nresponsible for\n\nthe \nchanges in air composition taking place\n(see fig. 1). \n This ability\n\nto isolate the effects of certain reactions\nproved, in some cases, to\n\nbe a sensitive means for determining values\nfor the reaction rates\ninvolved.\n(The rates were varied to obtain agreement between\ncalculated\nand measured values of electron concentration.)\n\nIt should be emphasized that occasional good\nnumerical agreement\nbetween calculated and measured electron concentration\nduring the\nflight\' could not be considered to be verification\nof the calculated\nresults by experiment.\nIndeed, such occasional good agreement can be,\nand has been in the past, obtained by comparing\nequilibrium or frozen\n\nflow field calculations vith experimental \n measurements.\nInstead, it\nis necessary to reproduce observed trends in\nthe measured electron\nconcentration over a wide range of conditions,\nand it is just the fact\nthat the RAM B-3 flight obtained the necessary\nmeasurements over a\nwide range of conditions that makes it uniquely\nvaluable for testing\nthe correctness of the chemical kinetic model.\n\nA comparison between the experimentally measured\nvalues of electron\nconcentration and the theoretical values will\nbe given in a technical\n\nmemorandum now being prepared.\n(The experimental data has already been\npublished in NASA TMX-1035.)\nSince the comparison is satisfactory in\nthe sense described in the preceding paragraph,\nthe flow fheld calculation\ncomputer program developed at langley is considered\nto be useftul for\npredicting electron concentrations and other\nflow field properties needed\n\nin designing radio communication systems for\nreentry vehicles.\n\nCALCULATED ELECTRON CONCENTRATION FOR RAM B-3 FLIGHT;\nkf REFERS TO N +0\n(Calculations for symbols were done with standard ambient air\ndensity)\nx/d N\n\n10\n\nNo + + e\xc2\xad\n\nk\n\n_00 \n\n0.155\n\n\nn\nA4\n\nN\n1012\n\nElectron\n\nConcentration,\n\ne-\n\n"3\n\n/ ]3.40\n\nDO.60\nA\n\n4.50\n\n".,\n\n3\n\nCM\n\n50\n\n1011 \n\ndnJEEEx\n0\'\n\nhalf angle\n\nCone; dn\n\n--\n\nStandard ambient air density, kj/kj = 1.0\nRevised ambient air density, kf/k = 1.0\n\n\n---\n\nI\n19\n\n140\n\n8"\n\n\n160\n\n180\n\nI\n\n200\n\nAltitude, ft \n\n\n, \n\n\n220 \n\n\nW\n240\n\n260 x103\n\n\nEvans et al-I\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n137\n\nIMPEDANCE AND RF PROPAGATION FROM DIELECTRIC AND\n\nPLASMA COVERED APERTURES\n\nC. T. Swift\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nWhen an aperture antenna, such as the one shown in figure 1, is\n\ncoated with a dielectric slab or a plasma,significant changes may occur\n\nin the input admittance. This,will lead to a change in the absolute\n\nsignal level of the radiated power, and will also alter the amount of\n\npower reflected back into the antenna. In addition, a certain percentage\n\nof energy will be coupled into the dielectric coating and remain trapped\n\nas a surface wave.\n\nThe input admittance is related to the reflection coefficient,\nin the following way:\n1I-F\n\n-=\nY = (gr\n\n+\n\ng\n\nr,\n\n- jb\n\nI+r\n\n\nwhere\n\ng\n\nis the conductance, and\n\nb\n\nthe susceptance.\n\nThe radiation con\xc2\xad\n\nductance, g and the surface wave conductance, g5 are independently\n\ncomputed. Pysically, gr is the amount of power supplied to the antenna,\n\nwhich radiates into free space, and g is that which remains trapped as\n\n1\n\na surface wave within the dielectric. \n\nThe input admittance properties of the antenna, shown in figure 1, are\n\ncurrently being investigated. It consists of a large coaxial transmission\n\nline, opening onto an infinite conducting ground plane, coated with a\n\nplasma, or other dielectric material.\n\nFor computational purposes, the dielectric constant of the slab was\n\ntaken to be 2.57 (polystyrene); the ratio of the radius of the outer t6\n\ninner conductor was fixed at2.00, and the line was assumed to be filled\n\nwith material of dielectric constant equal to 2.00 (teflon). The admittance\n\nwas then computed as a function of the slab thickness in wavelengths, and\n\nthe circumference-to-wavelength ratio of the inner conductor.\n\nThe radiation condtuctance is shown in figure 2, Generally, the\n\nconductance increases with increasing circumference-to-wavelength ratio,\n\nand a maximum or a minimum in the conductance occurs approximately at\n\nevery quarter wavelength as the thickness in wavelengths increases.\n\nThe surface wave conductance is plotted in figures 3 and 4. In\n\ngeneral, g5 rises sharply for the initial values of thickness and then\n\noscillates, much in the same manner as the radiation conductance.\n\n\n138\n\nIt is of interest to note That, in some cases, nearly all the energy\n\nis dumped into surface waves. It is also interesting that some combinations\n\nof parameters give practically no energy appearing as surface waves.\n\nThe susceptance has been computed-; however, more work is needed to\n\nimprove the accuracy of the computations.\n\nThe sensitivity of the input admittance to changes in the thickness\n\nof dielectric cover suggests that measurements\' of the admittance may be\n\nused to infer ablation rates during reentry. It is also expected that the\n\nadmittance should be equally sensitive to changes in the electron density\n\nof a reentry plasma. Therefore, the input admittance method may possibly\n\nbe a powerful method for plasma diagnostics. These applications are\n\ncurrently being investigated experimentally.\n\n\nTRANSMISSION LINE ANTENNA\n\n\nb a\ny\n\nINFINITE METAL\nGROUND PLANE\nDIELECTRIC COVER\n\nSwift-1\n\nRADIATION CONDUCTANCE\n\n\n.87\ngr\n\nkoE\n\n2.1\n1.4\n2.0\n\n.6 -1.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.3\n.2.,\n\n1.0\n\n-\n\n.2 __\n\n.8\n\n0\n\n0\n.1\n\nI.6\n.2\n\n.3\n\n.4\n\n.5\n\n.6\n\n.7\n\n.8\n\n.9\n\n1.0\n\nZo/Xe\ne\n4=\n\nSwift- 2\n\nSURFACE WAVE CONDUCTANCE\n\n\n1.2\xc2\xad\nkoa\n1.01.0\n\n.8\n\n.6\n\n.2.\n\n0\n\n.1\n\n.\n\n3\n\n.4\n\n.5\n\n.6\n\n.7\n\n.8\n\n.9\n\n1.0\n\nZo/Xe\n\nSwift-3a\n\nSURFACE WAVE CONDUCTANCE\n\n1.4\xc2\xad\n\n1.2\xc2\xad\nkoa\n.0 -1.2\n\n1.4\ngs\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n.2\n\n0\n\n.1\n\n.2\n\n.3\n\n.4\n\n.5\nz /ke\n\n.6\n\n.7\n\n.8\n\n.9\n\n1.0\nSwift-3b\n\n143\n\nBARIUM RELEASE EXPERIMENT\n\nDavid Adamson\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Virginia\n\nThe space physics group has a continuing interest in the earth\'s\n\nmagnetic field and convective motions and transient fluctuations within\n\nit. Much useful data has been obtained using satellites and space probes\n\nand the picture depicted in figure 1 has emerged. There is a continuous\n\noutpouring of plasma from the sun, the so-called solar wind. This plasma\n\nby virtue of its high conductivity cannot penetrate the earth\'s magnetic\n\nfield but flows around it forming the so-called magnetospheric cavity.\n\nThere are many questions pertaining to this cavity which remain unresolved,\n\ni.e., is the cavity open or closed; what is the nature of the convective\nmotions that\'are taking place within it; and, what are the nature of the\nchanges that take place within it during geomagnetic storms? Magnetometer\ndata is subject to certain inherent limitations, thus one cannot distinguish\nbetween spatial inhomogeneities and time-wise fluctuations. Moreover, it is\na matter of considerable difficulty to monitor the electric field itfengths\nand hence we have no direct observational data pertaining-to the - 2 drift\nas motions \xe2\x80\xa2of magnetic B\nmotions (which we somewhat loosely refer to\nfield lines). Also, when one bears in mind that extensiveness of the magneto\xc2\xad\nspheric cavity it is clearly an overwhelming task to chart in detail such\nan extensive field by point measurements.\nUse of an ionized cloud,on the otherhand, provides a ready means of\n\ndiscerning on a large scale the topology of the earth\'s field and motions\n\nwithin it. The principle is simple. If a charged particle is projected\n\ninto a magnetic field it spirals along a field line until it is dislodged\n\nfrom same by colliding with another particle. If one pictures then a\n\ncloud of such charged particles, sufficiently dispersed to ensure virtual\n\nabsence of collisions, the cloud will be frozen to the field lines to the\n\nextent that motion perpendicular to the field lines is entirely inhibited.\n\nOf course, the cloud will diffuse along the field lines and as it does\n\nso will serve to define their shape. Furthermore, motion of the field lines\n\nwill be imparted to the cloud.\n\nAssuming the cloud is released as a neutral cloud, two requirements\n\nmust be imposed. In the first place it must be readily ionized by the\n\nsun\'s ultra violet and secondly, it must have strong resonance lines in\n\nthe visible portion of the spectrum in order that the ionized cloud can\n\nbe seen against the night sky background. One of the substances most\n\nadequately filling these requirements is barium and in the calculations\n\nthat have been made to date, bearing on the feasibility of the techniques\n\nin achieving the objectives outlined above we have limited consideration\n\nup to the present to barium.\n\n\nIn the calculations made to date, it has been assumed that the cloud\n\nis released in the magnetic equatorial plane and viewed from a vantage\n\npoint lying directly beneath the point of release. Plots have been made\n\nof the number of particles per unit area along line of sight (which is\n\nproportional to cloud luminosity) as a function of angular coordinates\n\ndefined in inset of figure 2.

E. Meador\n\n\nNASA, Langley Research Center\n\nHampton, Va.\n\n\nUnlik6 thermodynamic properties, therbehavior of.a partially -ionized\n\ngas slightly displaced from equilibrium is not well understood.\nSuch non\xc2\xad\nequilibrium aspects as electrical and thermal conductivities, viscosity,\n\nand diffusion are essential to the solution of many practical problems,\n\ne.g.,\' heat transfer to reentering space vehicles, drag, radar attenuation,\n\nthermonuclear machines, and areas of astrophysics. Two phases of this\n\ngeneral domain have been considered: kinetic theory and -tatistical\n\nmechanics, molecular quantum theory.\n\nThe first prerequisite of any treatment of transport processes is the\n\n.adoption of\'a reasonable kinetic equation for the time evolution of the\n\noe-particle distribution function,; accordingly, the Boltzmann equation\n\nwas chosen as the one most completely analyzbd in the literature. Aithough\n\nsuch a theory was not designed originally for plasmas,, there are several\n\n.arguments to indicate that it suffices for these purposes. Not the least\n\nof the arguments, although,the solutions were accomplished in aiashion so\n\nas to essentially force the conclusions, is the quantitative agreement\n\nbetween Boltzmann theory and Spitzer\'s Fokker-Planck results at full ioni\xc2\xad\nzation. Grad also has contributed to the general understanding.\n\nChapman and Enskog\'s first-order perturbation solution to the Boltz\xc2\xad\nmann equation was applied (reference 1) to a ternary mixture of\' electrons,\n\nions, and neutrals, and general formulae for the electrical and thermal\n\nconductivities and other transport coefficients were derived. When the\n\neffects of induced electric fields Cambipolar diffusion) were included, it\n\nwas found that the field-reduced thermal conductivity was the sum of four\n\nterms: translational, internal, reactive, and thermal diffusion, the last\n\nof which is always less than 6% of the total. There were two surprising\n\nfeatures: the field reduced reaction conductivity, by reason of extensive\n\ncancellations, is nearly identical with that of Butler and Brokaw; secondly,\n\nthermal diffusion is not important except in its role as the justification\n\nbehind Muckenfuss and Curtiss\' translational contribution. Several dis\xc2\xad\ncrepancies in the literature were explained in terms of the proper hoices of\n\ngeneralized fluxes and forces in irreversible thermodynamics.\n\nAn additional paper (submitted for publication) concerns the electrical\n\nresistivity and thermal diffusion tensors defined according to the generalL\n\nized Ohm\'s Law, i.e., with specific reference to Joule heating. Onsager\'s\n\nreciprocal relations were used in conjunction with complete first-order\n\nChapman-Enskog theory to establish a firm kinetic basis for Spitzer\'s\n\nassumptions for a fully ionized gas. These results were extended to ternary\n\nmixtures .in order to illustrate the full impact of first-order simplifications\n\n\n148\n\n\no0was \t\n\na) \t\n\nto the formulation of SchlAlter and others, i.e., to\'show the scalar\n\ncharacteristics even in the presence of a magnetic field. All of this\n\naccomplished through the introduction of tensors (neighborhood versus\n\npoint analyses)\' for the customary scalar drag coefficients, thereby pro\xc2\xad\nviding a broader framework for the treatment of first-order limitations\n\n(aged systems).\n\nFormulae for transport coefficients only provide the statistical\n\nstructure; it is necessary also to have estimates of the collision cross\n\nsections before numerical work can be accomplished\'. New treatments, both\n\ntheoretical and semi-empirical and differing from those in the literature by\n\nan increased use of correlation analyses, have been ,applied (submitted for\n\npublication) to several atmospheric species. Only the results for oxygen\n\nshow a significant -departure from the work of Mason, Venderslice, et al,\n\nwhereas\'no sudcess has yet been obtained\'by -thismethod for heteronuclear\n\nmolecules. Nitrogen is well established, for example (ef, reference 2).\n\nAs a final problem, C. Fricke of the Space Physics Group is calculating\n\nthermal conductivity from the Balescu kinetic equation. This equation also\n\nfeatures binary encounters, but with the partners changing at an infinite\n\nrate; accordingly, the Debye shielding\' (with cloud distortions) is auto\xc2\xad\nmatically included. Previous calculations (Sundaresen and Wu, et al) of\n\nsimilar nature have, indeed, supported the Boltzmann and FoRker-Planck\n\napplications, but convergence of the series solutions was in no way evident.\n\nResults of this research are not presently available.\n\n\nReferences\n\nI.\' IV.E.
