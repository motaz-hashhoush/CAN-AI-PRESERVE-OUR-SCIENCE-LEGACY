The high cost-to-orbit for leaving the Earth's gravitational field continues to be the limiting factor in carrying sufficient hardware to maintain extended life support in microgravity or on other planets. Additive manufacturing techniques, or 'chipless' fabrication, like RP are being considered as the most promising technologies for achieving in situ or remote processing of hardware components, as well as for the repair of existing hardware. At least three RP technologies are currently being explored for use in microgravity and extraterrestrial fabrication.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030001000, "endDate": "2002-09-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AMPET", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "e42beeb1aaef4c398902ade240d54ae2", "startDate": "2002-09-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030001000, "id": "09ea9638b9744920a9769950f574e1eb", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
