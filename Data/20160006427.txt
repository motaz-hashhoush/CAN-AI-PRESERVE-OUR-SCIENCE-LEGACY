Hyten\nNational Space Symposium - The Broadmoor Hotel\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 I was not happy because they came in with another satellite\nprogram that was going to come out of Schriever Air Force Base with\nanother standalone ground system. I'll tell you today everybody in this\nroom, especially blue-suitors here today, we're not gonna put a new\nground system on Schriever Air Force Base. That's not gonna\nhappen. We have too many. The only ground system we're gonna put\non Schriever Air Force Base next is gonna be a common ground\nsystem . . . We have spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of\ndollars in standalone ground systems; we're gonna have one squadron\nout there with--if we keep going down the path, we'll have five separate\nground systems to operate five separate satellites. It's the dumbest\nthing in the world and it doesn't enable us to get into the future. We\nhave to get to a common ground system and we're gonna get to a\nground system and we're gonna get to it one way or the other. We\ncannot fail in this endeavor. So if you're an industry partner and you\ncome to me and you decide that you're [not] gonna recommend a\ncommon ground system to me, it is not gonna go well--if you don't have\na common ground system, it's not gonna go well. . .

and\nRecommendations\n\n23 June 2015\n\n12\n\nKey Findings\nPrinciples\n\nThemes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Approach the architecture as a system: There\nare many, many factors that together should affect\nour final mission operations and system design\ndecisions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lower cost and ubiquitous access: Innovative\nMCC concepts and low ops costs can become\nmission-enabling criteria, especially combined\nwith small satellite and hosted payloads.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use the best of the old and the new while\nreducing costs: We cannot simply discard our\ncurrent infrastructure and capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 we must\nplan to leverage our heritage and move deliberately\ntowards our new goals taking advantage of new\ncapabilities.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Internet of Things: Data from new internetconnected sources (space and ground-based\nsensors / equipment / facilities) will help inform\nmission ops planning and execution.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The only constant is change: Work with changing\ntechnical capabilities to respond to the high rate of\nchange in both space data systems requirements\nand operations concepts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The architecture must be flexible across many\ndomains: New systems will combine aspects of\nmultiple existing approaches used in a more\nversatile open-system approach that leverage\nappropriate new technologies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Incentivize for new solutions: Encourage the\ncreation of new flexible systems to meet the\ngrowing breadth of common needs across our new\nmissions.\n\n23 June 2015\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use of Standards: In-depth analysis and\nprototyping is necessary to influence and take\nfull advantage of new standards in order to\nachieve low cost consistency across system\ndevelopment and operations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Accounting for the Rate of Change:\nRequirements, cost-points, technology, business\nmodels, and operations concepts are all\nchanging rapidly\xe2\x80\xa6plan for continuing change.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Development of Use Cases: Mission ops\nconcepts captured in use case scenarios are\neffective in understanding needs and evaluating\nnew MCC architecture requirements and\ntechnology investments.\n\n13\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The team identified three Key Recommendations to\nhelp evolve NASA Earth science mission control\nsystems towards the MCC Enterprise

technologies to benefit Earth science missions\nthrough improved mission operations concepts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Devise a capability for experimenting and validating\nadvanced mission operations technologies and concepts\n\nwhere the Enterprise Architecture includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a common, robust baseline capability across mission\noperations, comprised of common services and tools to\nenable reuse and customization, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 an interoperable infrastructure enabling process\nvirtualization, automation, and cyber security\n23 June 2015\n\n14\n\nMission Operations Community of\nInterest Participation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The key benefit of a Community of Interest is to support\ncollaboration, and share knowledge and strategies to\naddress common mission operations

evaluate and evolve new technologies that would\nuniquely benefit ESD\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond to mission and\ntechnology trends.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Suggested technology topics include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advancing near real-time mission planning and sensor tasking\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Developing expert tools for virtual operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Leveraging the Internet of Things into space and ground systems,\ndemonstrating strategies to manage security challenges and\ninvestigating technology to find specific data to detect events and\nenable on orbit sensor tasking\n\n23 June 2015\n\n16\n\nExperiment and Validate Advanced\nMission Operations Concepts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Collaborate across SMD and NASA to consider feasibility\nof test environment(s) to exercise new operations\nconcepts and supporting technology.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Testbeds may include ground-based prototypes and on orbit\nresources (e.g., an ISS test payload, an end-of-life mission, or a\ndedicated cubesat).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Testbed would enable designers to upload and test new flight\nsoftware or exercise new protocols.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mission planning teams could propose new capabilities, allowing a\nuser to interact with a live spacecraft without impacting basic\nspacecraft health.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Suggested challenges to test and mature mission\noperations concepts include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDemonstrate integrated Cloud services\nExplore and validate cyber security strategies\nRapidly configure modular MCC
