For example, common random access memories  are solid-state, but are volatile and typically offer modest density.  Alternatively, mainstream magnetic disk and magnetic tape systems offer high storage density and nonvolatility,  but are fundamentally not solid-state.  A number of applications exist which would be suited well with high performance solid- state technology.  NASA, for example, is beginning  baseline solid-state recorders for upcoming space missions, such as the Cassini mission to Saturn.", "title": "A Magnetic Solid-State Storage Technology:  Vertical Bloch Line Storage", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060038752, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Katti, R.
