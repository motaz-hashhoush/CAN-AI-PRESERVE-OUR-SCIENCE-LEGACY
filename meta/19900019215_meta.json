A series of powered models were tested in the Vortex Research Facility under conditions with rate of descent and in the 14 x 22 Foot Subsonic Tunnel under identical conditions but without rate of descent. These results indicate that the rate of descent can have a significant impact on ground effects particularly if vectored or reversed thrust is used.", "title": "Dynamic ground effects", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T09:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900019215, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Paulson, John W., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "810499a7807c46cf97b1bef7df280ec5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900019215, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kemmerly, Guy T."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "1a7ed84ef1894a52aa6bec9f7c9944da"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900019215, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gilbert, William P."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "8be593b87ce448eb90f883f69197eba2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-10-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900019215, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900019215, "id": "d29f7fd3756f4c75848093c866e85acb", "publicationName": "AGARD, Aerodynamics of Combat Aircraft Controls and of Ground Effects", "publicationDate": "1990-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
