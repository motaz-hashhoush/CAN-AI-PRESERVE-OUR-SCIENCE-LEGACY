A fundamental aspect of the survey was the development of data reduction techniques for the scanning data from the OSSE detectors. A direct algebraic approach for spatially deconvolving the data was developed. For the survey work, no background observations isolated from the survey region were acquired, unlike normal discrete source observations. The survey, reduction method covers the mapped region with a grid of pixels, and estimates the flux from each pixel by least-squares agreement with the data, assuming positivity constraints. This technique has led to the detection of compact sources at hard X-ray energies within the Virgo region, and the OSSE survey studies have been extended to the south galactic pole and north Ecliptic pole, with similar analysis techniques.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000021002, "id": "3603dfc3d18849d8b06f745458e244d7", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
