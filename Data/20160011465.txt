b'Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF)\nInfusion\nThe Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) started as a Small Business Innovative Research\n(SBIR) project proposed by the company Made in Space, Inc. (MIS) and was infused into the\nInternational Space Stations (ISS) Program. The AMF was installed in the ISS EXPRESS Rack\nin April, 2016, and will offer on-demand manufacturing capability to NASA, and be accessible to\nindustry, academia, and other government agencies through the ISS National Laboratory and the\nCenter for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS).\nThe AMF uses an extrusion-based additive manufacturing process,\nmore commonly known as "3D printing", to manufacture parts up to\n14cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, with three different types of polymers to choose\nfrom. In addition to multiple parabolic flights through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Flight\nOpportunity Program, the additive manufacturing process was tested in\nmicrogravity for the first time in 2014 on the ISS 3D Printing in Zero-G\nTechnology Demonstration, which was also made possible by a SBIR\nbetween NASA and Made in Space, Inc.\nThis technology The Made in Space, Inc. Additive\ndemonstration served as a critical pathfinder and risk mitigation for this Manufacturing Facility (AMF)\nprovided on-demand manufacturing\nnovel process to be tested in the space environment.\n\nBenefit\n\nof parts for NASA, as well as\ncommercial users.\n\nLong-term exploration missions to destinations such as Mars require a dramatic paradigm shift\nin logistics, maintenance, and repair. In space manufacturing offers the elegant solution for\nsustainability and affordability by developing the on-demand processes, such as additive\nmanufacturing, to address the in-space construction, repair, and maintenance of vehicles,\ncritical systems, habitats, and uncrewed spacecraft for long-duration missions. This \xe2\x80\x9cMake it,\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t Take It\xe2\x80\x9d approach allows for a variety of parts and systems to be manufactured ondemand, directly lowering cost and decreasing risk by making available a needed part or tool in\nthe time it takes to print. The AMF serves as an ideal \xe2\x80\x9cmachine shop in space\xe2\x80\x9d technology testbed for the evolution of this capability.\n\nDevelopment Team Leads\nMike Snyder was the lead designer from MIS, Inc. for the AMF.\nNiki Werkheiser was the project manager for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s In-space Manufacturing initiative.\n\nLead NASA Center: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)\nFunding Organization: Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate\n(HEOMD)/Advanced Exploration Systems\nFor more information: https://techport.nasa.gov/view/11874\n\n'
