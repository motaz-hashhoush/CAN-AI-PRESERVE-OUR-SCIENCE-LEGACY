Major design decisions were driven by the need to reduce the pump s mass, power, and volume compared to the existing PLSS pump. In addition, the pump must accommodate a much wider range of abnormal conditions than the existing pump, including vapor/gas bubbles and increased pressure drop when employed to cool two suits simultaneously. A positive displacement, external gear type pump was selected because it offers the most compact and highest efficiency solution over the required range of flow rates and pressure drops. An additional benefit of selecting a gear pump design is that it is self priming and capable of ingesting non-condensable gas without becoming air locked. The chosen pump design consists of a 28 V DC, brushless, seal-less, permanent magnet motor driven, external gear pump that utilizes a Honeywell development that eliminates the need for magnetic coupling. The pump design was based on existing Honeywell designs, but incorporated features specifically for the PLSS application, including all of the key features of the flight pump. Testing at TEES verified that the pump meets the design requirements for range of flow rates, pressure drop, power consumption, working fluid temperature, operating time, gas ingestion, and restart capability under both ambient and vacuum conditions. The pump operated at 40 to 240 lbm/hr flow rate, 35 to 100 oF pump temperature, and 5 to 10 psid pressure rise. Power consumption of the pump controller at the nominal operating point in both ambient and vacuum conditions was 9.5 W, which was less than the 12 W predicted. Gas ingestion capabilities were tested by injecting 100 cc of air into the fluid line; the pump operated normally throughout this test.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20100024235, "endDate": "2010-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5e48bd94de304ded98fa03f095abce0a", "id": "f979a19e056f46098581e0d66ed2aadb"}], "name": "40th International Conf on Environmental Systems", "location": "Barcelona", "id": "5e48bd94de304ded98fa03f095abce0a", "startDate": "2010-07-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100024235, "id": "e3b3c74da610461e805db0483900b9ae", "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100024235.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100024235/downloads/20100024235.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100024235/downloads/20100024235.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100024235/downloads/20100024235.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
