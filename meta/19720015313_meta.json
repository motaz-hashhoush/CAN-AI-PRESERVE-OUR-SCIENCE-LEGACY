Attacks on science and technology (specifically military uses and funding), and the disillusionment of the public with the lack of relevance of science to the public interest and with the infallible wisdom of scientists are described. The effects of the fear of environmental pollution are emphasized. It is concluded that the important issues of science, technology, and public policy will require a pluralistic definition of the public interest by open adversary proceedings. It is also felt that the danger is not that new technology will receive inadequate assessment for possible deleterious secondary effects, but that harassment by an overemotional political process may prevent its coming to fruition.", "title": "Technology assessment or technology harassment:  The attacks on science and technology", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T18:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720015313, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Green, L., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "George Washington Univ.", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "b12482d2228d402c9b629bc9b50904c4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19720015313, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720015313, "id": "89580b751ecf406cab14f23a741382cc", "publicationName": "Technol.
