It declines from a high point during the\nfirst seven to nine years then builds back up in the remaining years. The OSO-P measurements will be taken during\na period of near maximum solar activity.\nKnowledge gained from OSO data will be useful in\npredicting solar flares and provide advance warning of\nintense solar activity which could affect the scheduling of\nmanned space flights.\nThe Sun emits energetic pa\'rticles and electromagnetic\nradiations of various wavelengths.\n\nPart of this solar\n\nradiation is absorbed by the Earth\'s upper atmosphere.\n\nThe\n\nEarth\'s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet and X-rays\nbelow 3,000 angstroms (A) in the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe solar X-ray and ultraviolet radiation produces the\nregion of great electron concentration called the ionosphere.\nThe primary objective of OSO-F is to obtain high\nspectral resolution data (within the 1A - 125OA range) from\nonboard solar experiments pointed toward the Sun.\n-more-\n\n-3-.\nOSO-F continues the solar investigations begun by\nOSOs I, II, III and IV which were successfully orbited\nduring the past seven years.\nOSO-F carries eight experiments.\n\nThey are provided by\n\nUniversity College, London, and the University of Leicester,\njointly, University of Paris, University of Colorado, University of Minnesota, the Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, Md., and the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory.\nThe OSO-F spacecraft weighs 641 pounds.\n\nIts eight\n\nexperiments weigh 265 pounds.\nThe spacecraft is designed in two sections, an upper\nsail-like structure which carries the pointed experiments,\nand a nine-sided base section called the wheel.\nThe wheel carries experiments and support equipment\nsuch as batteries and telemetry system.\nAs with its predecessors, OSO-F has been designed for\na lifetime of six months and a pointing accuracy of one\nminute of arc.\nA sail control system keeps this portion of the spacecraft facing the Sun while an automatic pitch control system,\nusing gas Jets and a magnetic torque coll, maintains the\nspin axis of the entire spacecraft approximately perpendicular\nto the direction of the Sun.\n-more-\n\n-4-\n\nThe first two OSO spacecraft were launched successfully\nfrom Cape Kennedy on Mar. 7, 1962 (OSO-l) and Feb. 1965\n(OSO-II).\norbit.\n\nThe third OSO, launched Aug. 25, 1965, failed to\n\nA.fourth OSO (OSO-IIl) was successfully launched\n\nMar. 8, 1967.\n\nOSO-IV was launched successfully Oct. 18, 1967\n\nBoth OSO-I and II, surpassed their designed lifetimes\nof six months and, together, provided about 6,000 hours of\nscientific information.\nOSO-III recently passed its 22d month in orbit and\ncontinues to operate well.\n\nThe satellite provides seven and\n\none-half hours of real-time data daily.\nOSO-IV recently passed its 15th month of successful\noperation and also provides seven and one-half hours of\nreal-time data daily.\nOSO-G and OSO-H remain in the program.\n\nThey are\n\nscheduled for launching in 1969 and late 1970, respectively.\nThe OSO program is directed by Physics and Astronomy\nPrograms, Office of Space Science and Applications, NASA\nHeadquarters, Washington.\n\nProject management is under the\n\nGoddard Space ^Flight Center, which is also responsible for\ntracking and data acquisition and the Delta launch vehicle.\nLaunch of the Delta is supervised by Kennedy Space Center\'s\nUnmanned Launch Operations (ULO).\n-more-\n\n-5The OSO spacecraft are designed and built by Ball\nBrothers Research Corp., Boulder, Colo., and the Delta\nLaunch Vehicle by McDonnell-Douglas Corp., Santa Monica,\nCalif.\n\n(END OP GENERAL RELEASE; BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS)\n\n-more-\n\nPROGRAM SUMMARY\n\n9\no\n\xc2\xbb1\nCD\nI\n\nPROJECT ORBITING SOLAK\nOBSERVATORY (OSO-F)\nPROJECT DIRECTION\nMSA/&&C\nPRIME CONTRACTOR\nBALL BKOTHfKS RESEARCH CORP\nEXPERIMENT\nORGANIZATIONS\nI/.S.NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (Z)\nWDDAKD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (2)\nUNIVERSITY COLLE&E LONDON\nUNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA\nUNIVERSITY Of PARIS\nUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO\nMAJOR OBJECTIVES\nTHEOSOISA RESEARCH SPACECRAFT\nDESIGNED FOR MEASUREMENT OF\nSOLAR PHENOMENA AND SOLAR\nEFFECTS.

This pioneering observatory satellite has\nprovided valuable scientific data for over 1,000 of its\norbits. As the first of its kind, it clearly established\nthe capability to orbit successfully a complex scientific\nobservatory containing numerous independent but complex solar\nand astrophysical instruments. ,\n,\nThe contribution of OSO-I to the study of active regions\nis in demonstrating that Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) observations carried out over several solar rotations give direct\nevidence of changing conditions in the corona above an active\nregion.\nOn OSO-I, the average atmospheric temperature and approximate density of the upper atmosphere between 124 and 248\nstatute miles were determined at sunrise and sunset for a\nperiod of one week each of high and low levels of solar activity. The results obtained by observing the attenuation of\nsolar spectrum lines from 170 to 400 8 with the Goddard solar\nEUV spectrometer showed some disagreement with the older\nmodels of the atmosphere. For example, the difference in\ntemperature between sunrise and sunset was not as much as\nobtained from the satellite drag results.\nIn another study, daily values of atmospheric temperature have been compared with EUV radiation data and also with\nindices of geomagnetic activity. The analysis of both phases\nand amplitudes favors the EUV rather than the solar wind\neffect as being principally responsible for the 27-day variations in atmospheric temperature for the months of March and\nApril 1962.\nAlso on OSO-I a number of "warm" spots which lie below\nthe lower Van Allen belt were observed by the University of\nCalifornia Lawrence Radiation Laboratory proton-electron\nexperiment. These were observed at the satellite altitude\nof 357 statute miles between the latitudes of 33 degrees\nN and 33 degrees S.\n\n-more-\n\n-8OSO-II\nSome of the major results are:\n\n- There are no rapid changes in the brightness of the\nsky as seen from above the airglow layer. Changes\nin .days to weeks of as much as 30 per cent are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 definitely ruled out.\n-\n\nFrom the standpoint of space astronomy, OSO-II\nobservations show that the zodiacal light will be\nthe principal contaminant for orbiting observatories,\nand that it is comparable with the sky brightness\nfrom the ground, where both the airglow and zodiacal\nlight combine to form the background.\n\n- There is no appreciable contribution to the zodiacal\nlight from a local (geocentric) cloud of dust.\n- The majority (at least 80 per cent) of the airglow\nas seen in our optical bandwidth of about 4,000 to\n6,000 K arises in the 56-statute-mile layer.\nr\n\nThe airglow shows "meteorological" day-to-day variations\nin brightness and color of about one astronomical\nmagnitude, which seem to be uncorrelated with latitude,\nlongitude, or time of night.\n\n- The scale of the airglow pattern is very much like\nthe scale of a meteorological system, i.e.: of the\norder of 1,000 miles.\n\nOSQ-III:\nOSO-III, launched Mar. 8, 1967, has been an outstanding\nsuccess. Both tape recorders operated satisfactorily from\ntime of launch until they failed May 26, 1967, and June 28,\n1968; All nine of the experiments operated as designed.\nHowever, two of the experiments which had met their scientific\nobjectives have ceased operation.\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center pointed .experiment has..\nion chambers which monitor the 2 to 8 A and 10 to 20 A\nregions of the solar spectrum, two spectrometers which cover\nthe range of about 1 to 4 A and 8 to 25 A, and a grazing\nincidence spectrometer which covers the 20 to 400 A portion\nof the spectrum.\n-more-\n\n-9-*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb\n\nThe grating spectrometer can be stopped on any desired\nline and observations made on the changes of intensity in\nthe selected line to give "light curves." The comparison\nof light curves for spectral lines of various elements and\nof various levels of lonization will be very important in\nunderstanding the.mechanism of transport of energy through\nthe corona generated by solar activity. In addition to its\nscientific value, the X-ray data are forwarded to the Flare\nWarning Network of Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA). These instruments were still providing good\nscientific data as of June 12, 1968. Of particular interest\nto scientists have been the observations of the changes in\nthe ultraviolet spectrum during the solar flares. Two\nmoderately strong new emission lines have been observed during\nmoderately large flares.\nThe pointing section also has a scanning spectrometer\nused as a monochromator and provided by the Air Force\nCambridge Research Laboratories. This instrument operated\nsuccessfully for more than six months. It scanned the solar\nspectrum from about 250 to 1,300 A and provided solar spectra\nof the best reproducibility to date in this region, although\nthe instrument had no spatial resolution.\nIn addition to obtaining solar spectra, this experiment\nmeasured the atmospheric absorption of the solar ultraviolet\nas a function of latitude, season and heights in the atmosphere. These data are extremely significant for aeronomy\nsince from these absorption spectra the physical processes\noccurring in the upper atmosphere can be studied in detail.\nThe University of Michigan has, in the wheel section,\nan ion chamber that measures the integrated sqlar flux from\n8 to 12 A. Some interesting variations have been found;\nnot all large increases in the flux correlate well with\noptical and radio observations of solar activity. It has\nbeen observed :that all optical flares produce X-rays. On\nthe other hand , out of 42 X-ray events observed before midSeptember in the "quick look" data, only 36 were correlated\nwith optical flares. Also, there is a large range of X-ray\nenhancements for a flare of given importance. In addition\nto its research value, this information is also provided\nto the Space Disturbance Laboratory of the Environmental\nScience Services Administration.\nThe University of California at San Diego has, in the\nwheel section, a sodium Iodide scintillation counter to\ndetect solar and celestial X-rays from about 7 to 190 kilovolts. This experiment has produced some interesting and\nimportant results for solar physics.\n-more-\n\n-10-\n\nIn this energy range the Sun Is characterized by its\nvariability \xe2\x80\x94 there exists no "quiet" Sun. Studies have\nalso been made of the rise time of solar X-ray bursts and\nof the correlation of the spectrum with burst activity.\nThe latter shows that the more intense the burst, the harder the\nX-rays.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has, in the\nwheel section, a gamma-ray telescope for the detection of\ncelestial gamma-ray sources with energies above 50 MeV. This\nexperiment requires extremely long observation times as the\ntelescope detects on the average about 1 photon per day from\nthe sky and about 200 per day from the Earth. As a result,\nthe interpretation of data from this experiment is just\nbeginning. However, one extremely significant observation\nclearly has been made. The center of our galaxy is a source\nof gamma-rays of energy greater than 50 MeV. \'This is important\nfor models of galactic structure and evolution, and theories\non the energetics of cosmic radiation.\nThe University of Rochester has, in the wheel section,\na particle-counting telescope to study solar and galactic\nhigh energy cosmic rays. As this experiment also has a very\nlow counting rate, it too needs a long lifetime for good\nstatistics. An upper limit to the isotropic flux of hard\ngamma-rays (energies higher than 50 MeV) has been determined\nand is a factor of three lower than the limit determined from\nearlier observations. For very high energy particles the\nproton (hydrogen nuclei) spectrum seems to be flatter than\nthe alpha particle (helium nuclei) spectrum. .There is an\nindication that the ratio of hydrogen to helium increases with\nincreases with energy for these very energetic nuclei.\nOSO-IV\nOSO-IV, launched Oct. 18, 1967* carried instrumentation\nfor nine experiments. Both tape recorders operated satisfactorily from time of launch until they failed on March 15, 1968,\nand May 12, 1968. All nine of the experiments operated as\ndesigned. However, one of these experiments has ceased operation.\nThere are three experiments in the pointing section of\nOSO-IV. A crystal spectrometer provided by the Naval Research\nLaboratory is studying solar X-rays in the 1 to 8 A region.\nA scanning spectrometer provided by the Harvard College\nObservatory was able to scan the solar spectrum in the 300\nto 1 3 0 ft region and to scan spatially the Sun at fixed\n,0\nwavelengths with spatial resolution elements of about one\nminute of arc. The third pointed experiment is an X-ray\nspectroheliograph provided by American Science and Engineering,\nInc. This experiment provides "pictures" of the Sun In wavelengths from less than 8 to alx>ve 70Angstroms.\n-more-\n\n-11The Harvard College Observatory ultraviolet spectroheliometer failed and was turned off about Nov. 30* 1967.\nOver 4,000 spectroheliograms of the solar atmosphere between\n300 and 1,300 A had been obtained. These data will permit\nthe development and assessment of realistic models of the\nsolar atmosphere and will provide insight into the problem\nof energy transport through the chromosphere and corona.\nThe following experiments are operative and real time\ndata are being obtained:\nNaval Research Laboratory~ Pointing Bragg Crystal\nSpectrometer \xe2\x80\x94 This experiment is obtaining moderately high\nre solution "spectra from 1 Angstrom - 8 Angstrom. The data\nshow differences between emissions from a "hot" corona and a\nrelatively low temperature corona.\nAmerican.Soience^and Engineering - Pointing X-Ray\nSpectrohellograph\xe2\x80\x94 This experiment obtains spectroheliograms\nin the soft X-ray region from below 8 Angstrom to about 70\nAngstrom. It is providing significant Information on hot\nspots in the solar corona and valuable spectroheliograms on\nthe "quiet" Sun.\nAmerican Science and Engineering - Wheel X-Ray Flux Monitor\xe2\x80\x94\nData have been obtained which Is being used to construct\ncharts on the background counting rate around the world. This\nis necessary to establish both the general background sky\nflux and to ascertain point X-ray sources in the sky.\nNaval Re search Laboratory - Whee1 Lyman-AIpha Night Sky\nGlow "This experiment is providing important Information\non the density and scale height of the geocorona.\nUniversity College London - Wheel Total Solar X-Ray\nEmission Over a Wideband \xe2\x80\x94 T h i s experiment has obtained\nvaluable data on the soft solar X-ray flux in five bands\nranging from 1 Angstrom - 70 Angstrom. In particular, this\nexperiment has made valuable observations on the distribution\nof X-ray flux due to flares and shows the hardening of the\nflux caused by solar activity.\nLawrence Radiation Laboratory - Wheel Proton/Electron\nDetector -\'- This experiment is designed to ascertain the\nenergy distribution of charged particles in the South Atlantic\nanomaly. Considerable data have been obtained which must be\nreduced to obtain particle energy spectra for electrons and\nprotons separately.\n-more-\n\n-12-\n\nNaval Research Laboratory - Wheel X-Ray Ion Chambers \xe2\x80\x94\nThis experiment is providing important data on the soft solar\nX-ray flux in four bands from 0.1 Angstrom to 16 Angstrom.\nThis experiment also shows the hardening of flux produced by\nsolar activity.\nUniversity College London - Wheel Integrated Helium n\n304 Angstrom Pnotometer \xe2\x80\x94 T h i s experiment is designed to\nmonitor the Helium "11 Lyman-Alpha 304 Angstrom line. This\nemission line is primarily responsible for heating of the\nEarth\'s atmosphere in the neighborhood of 124 statute miles.\nStudy of the fluctuations in the solar emission of this Helium\nII line and a detailed study of the eclipse of the Sun by the\natmosphere as seen by OSO-IV is providing important information\nto aeronomy and ionospheric physics.\nHarvard College Observatory - Pointing Scanning Spectrometer "This experiment which is no longer operating,\nproduced spectroheliograms at numerous wavelengths from 300\nAngstrom - 1,300 Angstrom. The spectroheliograms have a\nspatial resolution of approximately one minute by one minute\nof arc. It is within the capability of the experiment to\nselect any wavelength desired by the experimenter on any given\nscan. To date, spectroheliograms have been made in the lines\nof various ionic species of oxygen, magnesium, hydrogen and\nin the continuum. These data represent a major step forward\nin solar physics. This experiment failed Nov. 30, 196?.\nPointing Device\nAn important feature of OSO-F is that the spacecraft will\nhave the ability to perform a scan across the solar disk\nsimilar to OSO-II and OSO-IV. OSO-I and OSO-III could only\npoint directly at the center of the Sun. The fully oriented\nexperiment section on the sail of the OSO-P spacecraft has\ntwo modes of operation. In the first, called the pointed or\noriented mode, the experiment section is kept accurately\npointed at the center of illumination of the Sun. In the\nsecond mode, called the raster mode, the oriented section is\nmade to perform a raster scan of the entire solar disc and\nportions of the corona, as illustrated on page 12a. The\noriented instruments scan the Sun in a square raster pattern\nto an azimuth angle of 40 minutes. The azimuth sweep which\nrequires 7 6 seconds will be synchronized with the telemetry\n.8\nclock. One step in the elevation sweep will occur at the end\nof each azimuth sweep and one complete raster of the Sun will\ntake 307.2 seconds. Scanning is Initiated by ground command\nand is terminated automatically by a night signal.\n-more-\n\n-12a-\n\nRASTER MODE\nI/)\n(Z)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nACTUATED BY GROUND COMMAND.\n40 iWfSi I ARC MINUTE APART.\nLINE SWfeP RATE: to ARC MINUTES PER 7.66 SECONDS\nTOTAL XASTEK TIME\' 307.2 SfCONDS.\nUSED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS\'\n(A) UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDONX-RAY SPECTROHELIO6KAPH\ntB) NAVAL KfSEARCH LABORATORYS8LAK XUV SKCTROHELIOGRAPH (S\xc2\xa3t6CTED WAV\xc2\xa3LfNGTH$).\n\nPOINT EV1OOE\n(1)\n\nNORMAL ORIENTATION TO THE CENTER Of THE APPARENT\nSOLAK BISK, WfTHW -\' / AKC MMLtr\xc2\xa3\n(2) USED BY THE G0DOARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTERSOiAR X-RAY SPECTROMETER (SELECTED WAVUENOTH SANDS)\n\ni\n\nSTART\n\nTIME\n"*\n\n7.68 S E C S :\n\n>^\ni\n\n;i\n^\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\ni^^\n\n^*~\n\n/\n//\n/\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^--.\n^^\n\njS~\n\nx\n\nf\n\n\\\n\n.\n\\\n\\\n^\nx\n\n\'\n\ny\n\\\n\n<D\n^r\n\n!\n\nTl VIE\n256 \'5ECS.\n\nLii\n\nj\n\nT\n1\nT\n\n3\n\ne\n\n\xc2\xabt\n\n\\\n\nV\\\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\\\n\n/\n\\\n\n\\\nj_\n\n/\n\n^\n\n\'S^\n\xe2\x80\xa2"^"w.\n\n"\n\n-^"^\'\n**\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xbb~\n\n)\xe2\x80\xa2"\n\n/\n\n/\nN.\n\nEND OF RAJ>TER\nPULSE TO S CAN\nEXPERIME NTv\n\n/\n\n/\n/\n\ni -- i\n\n-~~\n\nANULt 1U\n\n-more-\n\n. ^\n\nn\n\n"\n\n\'\n\n-13OSO-F EXPERIMENTS\n\nThree of OSO-P\'s eight experiments are located on\nthe sail portion of the spacecraft and will be pointing\nat the Sun.
