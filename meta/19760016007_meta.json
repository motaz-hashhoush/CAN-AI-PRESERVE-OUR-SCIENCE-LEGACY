The electrophoresis equipment was designed for the separation of four mixtures of biological cells with variable sample flow rates, buffer flow rates, and electric field gradients. Separation quality was assessed by measuring the light from a quartz lamp through the electrophoresis channel and on to a photodiode system. The preliminary results indicate that all monitored systems operated correctly during the experiment. The optical system produced a light that was too bright to discern true cell distributions, but data were received that show a distribution of separated cells.", "title": "Electrophoresis experiment, experiment MA-014", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T10:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760016007, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hannig, K."}, "organization": {"name": "Max-Planck-Inst. fuer Biochemie", "location": "Martinsried bei Muenchen, Germany"}}, "id": "6a16eb80eb67489b97d15ed2528fb315"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19760016007, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wirth, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Max-Planck-Inst. fuer Biochemie", "location": "Martinsried bei Muenchen, Germany"}}, "id": "ddf5a6eb57cf44a08015e284f919f69f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19760016007, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760016007, "id": "f6579b1749154fc8945aebef21465e7b", "publicationName": "NASA.
