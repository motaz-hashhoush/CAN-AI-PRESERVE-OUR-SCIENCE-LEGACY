About 15 percent\nof the GA accidents are attributed to weather. Two factors\nthat contribute to weather-related accidents are (1) the\ncognitive overload of interpreting the large amount of texdata, much Of which may be irrelevant\xe2\x80\x99 and (2) the 25\ninadequacy of in-flight updates of data related to weather.\nGraphical displays of many aspects of weather are now\navailab1eto\ntextual weather briefings. Data link\ntechnologies to provide weather data to GA pilots in flight\nare being developed.\n30\npercent Of non-militq aircraft are\nas commercial air carriers; the remaining 96\npercent are considered general aviation (GA) akraft.\naircraft are\nAPProximately 73 percent Of the\nsmall aircraft, with 2 to 6 seats and 1 O 2 Piston engines. 35\nr\nWithin this latter group, loss or lack of weather awareness\nhas been responsible for most of the fatalities (an estimated\n73 percent in 2001, for example) for at least two reasons: (1)\ndelays in obtaining in-flight briefings, when these are\nrequested; and (2) m c u l t y in interpreting in-flight Weather 40\nbriefings in the formats usually presented.\nWhere weather information is needed, the conventional\nmethod for in-flight briefings is for a pilot to request a verbal\nupdate of weather and wind Conditions, using an aircraft\nradio, from a ground-based weather specialist. The time 45\ninterval for interaction between pilot and weather specialist\nis very short and is limited to specific information explicitly\nrequested by the Pilot. The number of Pilots seeking Such\ninformation increases in a given region when the weather is\nworst and the P2ots may need, but may be unable to request, 50\nadditional information. This often produces 10% time delays\nin response by the weather specialist and may also produce\nartificially shortened interactions, as the specialist tries to\nrespond to each pilot i a long queue. Faced With this\nn\nsituation, the specialist is unlikely to provide other useful 55\ninfmnation that can be acted upon by the Pilot7or that may\nr\neven reverse a decision to ContiXlUe, alter O diSCOplbUe a\nflight by a given route.\nWhat is needed is a system, specific to a particular pilot,\nthat (1) senses and stores the types of weather information 60\nthat is often requested by the pilot in one or more identifiable\nsituations, (2) senses when an identifiable situation is\npresent, (3) provides the weather information in one or more\nof several optional formats (e.g., alphanumeric text, graphical and audible) according to the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s preferences, and (4) 65\nallows automatic as well as manual change of the parameters\nthat describe an identifiable situation.\n\nnon-miliw\n\nem\nThese needs are met by the inventjon, w\nand method t a provides easy-to-interpret graphical preht\nsentations of weather elements (including wind data) that are\nbecoming available as text though datalink. The system,\nsometimes referred to as the Aviation weather Environment\n(AWE), also provides a novel interaction environment that\ngreatly decreases a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s workload associated with developing, maintaining and interpreting an awareness of developing weather situations. The AWE system can anticipate\nthe Pilot\xe2\x80\x99s needs, monitor the data,\nWeather weds,\nand SWgest alternative Courses Of action, without res-%\npilot direct action but accommodating the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s preferences\nand habits. The AWE system also decreases the amount of\nhead-down t m required for the pilot to interpret the\nie\nreceived weather data.\nIn one embodiment, the approach: (1) provides presently\nmeasured or estimated values for each of a selected subset\nof a set of\npameters, where the situation pat.ameter set includes distance of present location to a selected\naircraft destination, predicted trip length, trip departure time,\ntrip phase, visibility, cloud cover or ceiling, estimated longitudinal wind speed (at present location\nat destination), estimated crosswind speed, estimated wind gust speed\nat destination,\ndew point and density altitude;\n(2) provides a database containing a collection of N reference aviation-situations, numbered n=l . . . ,N (NS2), with\neach aviation-situation\nbeing characterizedby an ordered set\nof value ranges of situation parameters drawn from the\nselected subset of parameters; and (3) when the measured or\nestimated value of each of the selected subset of parameters\nlies within the corresponding value range, the system displays a corresponding selected subset of weather data, in\nvisually perceptible andor audibly perceptible format a n d\nor as an\nalarm\nme correspon~mgsubset of\nweather data is drawn from a set of weather data that\nincludes one or more of estimated aircraft present altitude,\nestimated\nair\nat kcraft present altitude,\nestimated longitudinal wind speed (at present location a n d\nor a destination), estimated cross wind speed, estimated\nt\nwind gust speed, estimate of wind variability, estimated\nwind vector direction, temperature, dew point, tempemmedew point spread, density altitude, estimated sky condition\nfor at least one altitude range, estimated ground visibility at\naircraft present location, estimated ground visibility at aircraft&sation, estimated precipitation, estimated visibility\nobscurations along aircraft flight route, estimated ceiling,\nestimated fuel required to reach destination, estimated distance from destination, recommended runway at destination,\nand time of most recent measurement upon which the subset\nof weather h is based.\nThe system automatically checks for availability of\nweather data updates and provides the original\nand the\nupdated data in one or more formats that include an alphanumeric display, a graphical display and an audibly perceptible read-out. The displays provide present conditions and\npredicted changes in these conditions over a time interval\nthat corresponds to flight duration (from 30 min to several\nhours; depending upon the nature of the condition and the\nindividual changes). This includes a verbal interaction interface that allows the pilot to call up particular information\nverbally andor to obtain a verbal response. The system\nimplements an intelligent agent that (1) senses the presence\nof any of a plurality of identifiable (\xe2\x80\x9canticipated\xe2\x80\x9d) situations\nin which the pilot often requests particular weather data, (2)\nautomatically provides the specified weather data without\n\nUS 7,129,857\nThe situation database 24 communicates with a parameter\neditor 27A and a habit editor 27B (FIG. 2) that allow the\npilot to (1) specify a desired range for one or more situation\nparameters in a selected subset and (2) add or delete a\n5 situation parameter in a selected subset of such parameters\nthat define a \xe2\x80\x9csituation\xe2\x80\x9d in which a display would normally\nbe provided and (3) specify one or more display modes\n(visual, audible, alarm signal) in which a specified subset of\none or more weather parameter values is to be presented, as\n10 illustrated in FIG. 3.

If the answer to the query in step\nis \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d for parameter number m=m\xe2\x80\x99, the system, in step\ndisplays at least one of {WP(METAR;m\xe2\x80\x99)and WP(TAF;m\xe2\x80\x99)}\nand moves to step 96. In step 96, the system optionally\ncontinues with other processing or terminates.\nWhenever an updated weather report (METAR, TAF,\nWinds Aloft) is received, the system determines whether the\nupdated parameters fall witiin a range corresponding to a\nsituation. If the parameters do not fall within a range\ncorresponding to a situation but the information is relevent,\ngiven the present location of the aircraft, the system displays\nthe corresponding information.\nFor example, if visibility decreases below the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nminimum acceptable value at an airport the aircraft has\nalready flown past, information relating to that airport would\nbe irrelevant and would not be displayed. However, if\nvisibility decreases at the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s destination airport, the\npilot would be notified of this development, especially if the\noriginal forecast did not predict this condition.\nIn addition to automatically checking updated reports for\nrelevant anomalous situations, the system incorporates a\nmachine learning algorithm, EARL, to learn the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nhabits in requesting particular weather information during\nthe approach phase of a flight, and optionally during other\nphases of the flight. Using this functionality,the system can\nanticipate a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s habitual request for certain weather\ninformation and can provide this informationwithout requiring pilot action. A parameter range for each parameter\ninvolved in a situation may be a default value, may be\nchosen by the pilot and/or may be identified by EARL.\nEARL relies, in part, upon noting and memorizing the\nvalues of the identified situation parameters that are present\neach time the pilot verbally andor electronically requests\nflight information in visually perceptible and/or audibly\nperceptible form. EARL notes correspondences between\nranges of values of different situation parameters when a\nflight information request is made by the pilot. One method\nof accomplishing this is to fuse the values for each relevant\nsituation parameter, using a union, maximum, minimum or\nstatistical averaging operation, depending upon the parameter.\nFor example, distance from destination, As, is fused by\ncomputing average values of As when a request is made.\nVisibility, temperature and dew point spread are fused by\ncomputing a maximum value for each parameter, each time\na request is made; and longitudinal wind speed, cross wind\nspeed, gust wind speed, temperature and density altitude are\nfused by computing the minimum values of each when a\nrequest is made. EARL may learn to provide a particular\ntype of information when VIS520 nautical miles, v,,,(cr)\n215 knots andor T280\xe2\x80\x9d F. Optionally, EARL also accepts\na specification of a situation parameter subset and (optional)\nrelevant range of the situation parameter in that subset.\nC r a n subsets of coordinated parameters are naturally\neti\ngrouped together, excluding other parameters. For example,\nwhen a request for density altitude informationis made, only\nthe values of present altitude h, temperature T and density\naltitude h(dens) are relevant; and a request for information\non presence of fog or other obscurations at the destination\nwill rely primarily upon temperature-dew point spread\nAT(dew) and visibility VIS. Specification of these coordinated parameters subsets initially will prevent the system\nfrom learning from irrelevant combinations of (non-related)\nparameter values. Identification of what are believed to be\ncoordinated parameters, based on a small set of examples,\ncan lead to the undesired extraction of unforeseen habits that\nare preferably ignored. As noted in the preceding, the system\n\n21 provides a graphic-based habit editing module 26B, that\nallow the pilot to view, modify, edit and delete rules that\nhave been identified by EARL.\nOperation of the invention is best understood by first\n5 examining procedures followed by a pilot in the pre-flight,\nascent, cruise and descent stages of a flight. In the pre-flight\nphase, the pilot specifies a proposed flight route to a DUAT\nsource, as a sequence of airport or waypoint identifiers. The\nDUAT source returns relevant METAR, TAF and Winds\n10 Aloft reports for all airports within a pilot-specified transverse distance d(trans) (typically 50-200 nm) from the flight\nroute.\nA Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT) report, is a\ncollection of relevant weather information offered by one or\n15 more private companies under a contract with the F.A.A. and\nis available to all pilots and student pilots. A DUAT report\npresents data obtained from the National Weather Service\n( N W S ) through the F.A.A. A DUAT briefing provides\npresent weather information and forecasts on the position of\n20 fronts and pressure systems, present wind conditions and\nforecasts at airports at altitudes up to 39,000 feet, cloud layer\ncoverages and altitudes, weather variables, visibility conditions, widespread low visibility, freezing levels, icing levels,\nwarnings about meteorological conditions (thunderstorms,\n25 etc.). turbulence, mountain obscuration, unlighted obstructions, out-of-service equipment, and reports from other\npilots (PIREF\xe2\x80\x99S, etc.) concerning actual conditions encountered. This information may be part or all of reports from\nMETAR, TAF, Winds Aloft, PIREPS and NOTAMs, and\n30 other sources. Some, but not all, of a DUAT report may be\npresented visually, including weather charts, surface analysis, surface forecast charts, higMow pressure systems,\nw d c o l d fronts and precipitation areas. The charts provide\na nationwide overview of relevant weather conditions but do\n35 not focus on specific flight routes or flight time intervals. A\nDUAT report does not provide visually perceptible charts on\npresent values for meteorological conditions (METARs) or\nfor terminal area forecasts (TAFs).\nThe pilot analyzes the DUAT source reports and deter40 mines (1) whether the aircraft capabilities are within the\nrequirements imposed by the weather conditions and (2)\nhow many landings at intermediate airports may be required,\ngiven the distance to the destination and the predicted Winds\nAloft reports. If the proposed flight route is over mountain45 ous terrain, the pilot either (i) verifies that the aircraft has the\nrequired capabilities for the predicted winds or (ii) replans\nthe route to avoid flying over the highest terrain. The pilot\nthen estimates the flight time to the destination and determines the approximate location of fuel stops for the trip. The\n50 Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) reports, fuel availability, fuel consumption, and expected traflic density at each\nairport where a landing is required will provide some\nconstraints on choices of the fuel stop airports. The pilot\nexamines the TAF reports (issued four times per day, plus\n55 amendments for unexpected weather changes) to obtain\nforecasts for a specified airport region for weather conditions, wind, visibility on the ground, sky conditions and the\nprobability of precipitation or thunderstorms. Optionally,\nthis is done for each airport that the pilot will pass over or\n60 near along the proposed flight route.\nIf the TAF conditions are within the limits of the aircraft,\nthe pilot then examines the METAR reports for the source\nairport and destination airport and examines the airport\ncharacteristics (airport elevation, predominant wind direc65 tion,\nrunway orientation(s) and length(@ and\ncomposition(s)). The pilot determines temperature, dew\npoint, density altitude at the source, determines whether\n\ntakeoff is possible, and determines whether the aircraft can\nclimb directly to a cruise altitude or whether the aircraft\nmust circle as it ascends to the cruise altitude. The pilot\ndetermines whether enroute weather conditions are developing as predicted. For example, is any fog that is present\nclearing as quickly as predicted? If weather conditions are\nunsettled and are not developing as predicted, the pilot may\nneed to follow an alternate plan.\nThis preparation process is simplified using a system\nincorporating the invention. The system downloads DUAT\nsource reports for a large geographical region at start-up. For\nground operations, this may be done for all airports within\na 1000-nmradius. For in-flight use, download is constrained\nby bandwidth limitations of any data link technology used.\nThe system can work with text only, if desired, which\nlessens the effects of these limitations. The pilot is provided\nwith enroute weather conditions for a region and is not\nrequired to specify a flight route. To specify a flight route,\nairports can be selected directly on a chart. The system can\nbe activated hours before departure to obtain and present\nhistorical weather data. Access to actual weather conditions\nfor a few hours before departure improves a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s analysis\nof trends, which can be updated with DUAT source reports\nas the flight proceeds.\nBecause METAR, TAF and Winds Aloft reports are also\nprovided graphically, the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s analysis may be transformed from reading text and deciphering DUAT codes to\nvisually interpreting graphical representations of weather\nconditions. The pilot may, for example, use color coded\nthresholds to reflect the pilot or aircraft limits and look for\nMETAR and/or TAF rectangles that do not have yellow or\nred borders. Because each such report is displayed next to\nthe airport it represents, the pilot need not mentally map\nairport identifiers, normally shown in text format, to the\ncorresponding airports shown on the chart.\nWhen the pilot selects a flight route, the system automatically estimates arrival times and presents the relevant TAF\nreports for the appropriate time intervals. If the pilot alters\nthe proposed departure time(s) and/or the proposed crusing\naltitude(s) and/or cruising speed@),the corresponding TAF\nreports and Winds Aloft reports are automatically modified\naccordingly.\nInterpretations of METAR reports are also simplified.\nVisibility, ceiling and surface wind vectors that are outside\nthe pilot and aircraft capabilities are flagged by yellow or red\nborders, for purposes of takeoff and/or landing. Density\naltitude at takeoff, ascent, cruise, descent and/or landing is\nautomatically determined, or is provided in response to a\nverbal request to the system.\nA trend in conditions can also be evaluated by the pilot,\nusing a trend display and actual versus predicted weather\nconditions for a specified preceding time interval, such as\nthree hours. If, for example, a trend indicates that fog will\nlikely still obscure a destination airport, the system provides\nan alternate destination airport that meets the constraints of\nthe pilot and aircraft.\nWith reference to the cruise or enroute portion of a flight,\nthe system will observe and learn the particular ranges of\nconditions (referred to collectively herein as \xe2\x80\x9csituations,\xe2\x80\x9d\ndetermined by one or more parameter ranges) that will cause\na given pilot to request a textual, graphic and/or audible\ndisplay of a corresponding group of weather data. The most\nlikely situations will involve distance (or time) to a specified\ndestination, wind conditions at or near the destination,\naircraft fuel remaining, and substantial (adverse) changes in\nweather conditions along the proposed flight route. In\nresponse to occurrence of a specified situation, the system\n\n5\n\nIO\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nwill automatically textually, graphically and/or audibly display the Corresponding weather data, inc\ninformation, that would normally be reques\nin those circumstances. Optionally, the pilot may verbally\nrequest a change between textual, graphical and audible\npresentations.\nPotentially, the busiest time for a pilot is during preparations for descent and landing at a destination. The pilot must\nobtain, and understand the significance of, the relevant\nweather conditions at the destination, such as visibility,\nceiling, temperature, dew point, wind conditions, distance\nfrom destination,etc. The system automatically provides the\ncorresponding displays of relevant information, which may\ninclude density altitude, runway orientation, updated wind\nconditions.\nAnother phase of a flight involves diversion or flight route\nreplanning and is not present for many flights. Here, the\nsystem initially emphasizes prompt presentation of data\nrelevant to the route diversion or replanning process, in\nresponse to entry, by the pilot or otherwise, of certain\nconstraints, such as fuel remaining, maximum standard\naltitude or density altitude for an acceptable alternate destination, VFR or IFR landing, minimum ceiling required,\nminimum visibility preferred, and maximum cross wind or\nwind gusts that can be handled. In response to receipt of\nthese constraint statements from the pilot and determination\nthat the original destination doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet one or more of\nthese constraints, the system searches through the DUAT\nreport or other relevant weather reports, including updates,\nand provides one or more alternate destinations and corresponding weather conditions, ranked in terms of a metric\nthat takes account of how many of (and how well) the\nconstraints are satisfied. Optionally, the system displays\n(textually, graphically and/or audibly) other weather and\nrelated conditions, not explicitly covered by the constraints\nentered by the pilot, that may also be relevant to the choice\nof an alternate destination. These other conditions may\ninclude fuel availability at the alternate destination, sleepover accomodations,hours of operation, runway orientation\nrelative to present wind vector, etc.\nThe reflex learning algorithm EARL, in one embodiment,\nexamines measurements or estimates for as many as 12\nweather variables, which may be referred to as \xe2\x80\x9csituation\nparameters\xe2\x80\x9d and identifies one or more ranges of a subset of\nthese variables for which the pilot normally (or habitually)\nrequests a display of one or more weather parameters. A\nsubset of these weather variables need not include ranges for\nal of these variables; a proper subset of the 12variables may\nl\nbe identified and used by the system.\nEstimated trip length TL,expressed as a time interval or\nas a distance interval, is assigned a three-bit binary value\n(x3)(x2)(xI), where XI, x2 and x3 refer to a \xe2\x80\x9cshort length\xe2\x80\x9d\ntrip, to a \xe2\x80\x9cmedium length\xe2\x80\x9d trip and to a \xe2\x80\x9clong length\xe2\x80\x9d trip,\nrespectively. The range for (estimated) length of a trip is thus\nrepresented by the integers 0-7. For example, if the pilot\nrequests particular weather infomation for all long trips and\nal medium trips (x3=1 and x2=1), the range for this variable\nl\nbecomes (l,l,O), or an equivalent integer value of 6. If at\nmost one of the trip lengths is specified at any one time, a\ntwo-bit binary value (x2\xe2\x80\x99)(x1\xe2\x80\x99) can be used here and, for\nexample, (x2\xe2\x80\x99,xl\xe2\x80\x99)=(l,l), (l,O), (0,l) and (0,O) may correspond to a long trip, a medium trip, a short trip and NOP,\nrespectively.\nA trip phase parameter (pre-departure, takoff, ascent,\ncruise, descent, approach, landing, search for alternative\ndestination, etc.) may also be expressed as a three-bit or\nfour-bit binary value (y3)(y2)(yl),corresponding to each of\n\nthe different trip phases that are accounted for by this\nvariable. Preferably, at most one value of the trip phase\nparameter is present at any time. For example, the predeparture and takeoff phases may correspond to (y3,y2,yl)\n=(O,O,O) and (O,O,l), respectively.\nThe (estimated) distance from destination variable\nAs(dest) is assigned an arithmetic average of all the values\nfor occurrences of request of a selected display and is\nassociated with the particular combinatiuon of items\nincluded in the selected display. A range (lower limit,upper\nlinit) for this variable may also be assigned, where \xe2\x80\x9clower\nlimit\xe2\x80\x9d may have a value of 0 or have a positive value. Where\neach of two or more situation parameter subsets includes the\nquantity As(dest), each subset may have its own range for\nAs(dest).\nThe (estimated) visibility variable is assigned a maximum\nvalue (e.g., VIS(max)=2.4 nm) for all the visibility values at\nwhich the pilot has requested a selected display and is\nassociated with the particular combination of items included\nin the selected display. The range for the visibility variable\nbecomes O S VIS SVIS(max).\nWhere a new visibility value, denoted VIS(new), is\nreceived for which a weather parameter display is requested\nby the pilot, the present visibility value, denoted VIS(o1d;\nmax), is replaced by a new value that (re)defines the\nvisibility range, VIS(max)=max{VIS(new), VIS(o1d;max)).\nThis re-definition is applied by analogy to each of the\nparameters VIS(max), Ce(max) and AT(dew;max), for\nwhich a maximum value is used to define the applicable\nrange for that parameter.\nThe (estimated) ceiling or sky cover variable Ce is\nassigned a maximum value (e.g.. Ce(max)=1200 feet) for all\nthe ceiling values at which the pilot has requested a selected\ndisplay and is associated with the particular combination of\nitems included in the selected display. The range for the\nceiling variable becomes OSCeSCe(max).\nThe temperature-dew point spread variable AT(dew) is\nassigned a maximum value (e.g., AT(dew;max)=4\xe2\x80\x9d C.) for\nall the spread values at which the pilot has requested a\nselected display and is associated with the particular combination of items included in the selected display. The range\nfor the temperature-dew point spread variable becomes\nOSAT(dew)SAT(dew;max).\nThe (estimated) longitudinal wind speed variable is\nassigned aminimum value (e.g., v,(long;min)=lO knots) for\nall the wind speed values at which the pilot has requested a\nselected display and is associated with the particular combination of items included in the selected display. The range\nfor the longitudinal wind speed variable becomes v,,,(long)\nLv,(long;min).\nWhere a new longitudinal wind speed value, denoted\nv(long;new), is received for which a weather parameter\ndisplay is requested by the pilot, the present wind speed\nvalue, denoted v(long;old;min), is replaced by a new value\nthat (re)defines the longitudinal wind speed range, v(1ong;\nmin)=min{v(long;new), v(1ong;old;min)). This re-definition\nis applied by analogy to each ofthe variables, v(cr;rpin)) and\nh(dens;min), for which a minimum value is used to define\nthe applicable range for that variable.\nThe (estimated) cross wind speed variable is assigned a\nminimum value (e.g., v,,,(cr;min)=15 knots) for al the wind\nl\nt\nspeed values a which the pilot has requested a selected\ndisplay and is associated with the particular combination of\nitems included in the selected display. The range for the\ncross wind speed variable becomes v,(cr)Lv,(cr;min).\nThe (estimated) density altitude variable h(dens) is\nassigned a minimum value (e.g.. h(dens)=4,000 ft) for all the\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\ndensity altitude values at which the pilot has requested a\nselected display and is associated with the particular combinatiuon of items included in the selected di\nrange for the density altitude variable becomes\n(dens;min).\nOne or more of the weather variables trip length TL,trip\nphase TP, distance from destination As(dest), ceiling Ce,\ndew point-temperature spread AT(dew), temperature T, longitudinal wind speed v,(long), cross wind speed vw(cr), gust\nwind speed v,,,(gust), altitude h and density altitude h(dens)\nmay be assigned a default value.\nFIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate a procedure for determining\na range or ranges of the situation parameters in a particular\nsubset of these parameters, for which a given pilot will\nnormally (or habitually) request a display or one or more\nreference weather parameters. In step 111 (optional), the\nsystem is provided with a selected subset of the situation\nparameters that are to be used to define a \xe2\x80\x9csituation\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhereby a (specified) pilot normally (or habitually) requests\na display of one or more selected weather parameters. Step\n111 can be deleted or modified, if the system is configured\nto identify part or all of the subset of situation parameters to\nbe used to define a situation of interest. More than one\nsituation can be defined, each with its own subset of situation parameters, where two situations differ from each other\nby at least one of the situation parameters. A subset of\nsituation parameters may include: (1) a first component\nsubset of parameters in which the useful range of each\nparameter is updated using a maximum operation; (2) a\nsecond component subset of parameters in which the useful\nrange of each parameter is updated using a minimum\noperation; (3) a third component subset of parameters in\nwhich the useful range of each parameter is updated using a\nstatistical average operation; and (4) a fourth component\nsubset of parameters in which the range is decomposed into\nsemi-quantitativemeasures of the parameter (e.g.. decomposition of the trip length parameter into a \xe2\x80\x9cshort length\xe2\x80\x9d\ntrip, a \xe2\x80\x9cmediumlength\xe2\x80\x9d trip and/or a \xe2\x80\x9clong length\xe2\x80\x9d trip). The\nfirst, second, third and fourth component subsets are preferably mutually exclusive, and the union of these four\ncomponents subsets provides the selected subset of situation\nparameters. At least one of the three component subsets is\nnon-empty.\nin step 113, the system provides a selected first component subset of N1 parameters, denoted pal (nl=l, . . . ,Nl),\nfrom the selected subset of situation parameters, for which\nthe qualifyingrange of the parameter pal is defined as pal no\ngreater than a selected threshold value. In step 115, the\nsystem provides a present-maximum value p,,(max)=maximum of the accumulated measured or estimated values for\neach of the parameters pnl. In step 117, the system receives\na new measured or estimated value of the parameter pnl,\ndenoted pal(new), defines an updated present-maximum\nvalue of the parameter pal as pnl(max;updated)=max{pal\n(max), pnl(new)}, and replaces the value pal(max) by the\nvalue pnl(max;updated).\nIn step 119, the system provides a selected second component subset of N2 parameters, denoted a2\n(n2=1, . . . ,\nN2), from the selecetd subset of situationparameters. In step\n121 the system provides a present-minimum value ~ ( m i n )\n=minimum of the accumulated measured or estimated values for each of the parameters h In step 123, the system\n.\nreceives anew measured or estimated value of the parameter\nq,,denoted a2(new), defines an updated present-minimum\nvalue of the parameter azas ~z(min,updated)=min{qn2\n(min). az}, replaces the value qnz(min) by the value\nand\na,(min;updated).\n\nUS 7,129,857 \xe2\x82\xac31\nIn step 125, the system provides a selected third component subset of N2 parameters, denoted rn3(n3=1, . . . ,N3),\nfrom the selected subset of situation parameters. In step 127\nthe System Provides a statistical average Value r& >\n,T\nof\nthe accumulated measured or estimated values for each Of 5\nthe parameters rn3. In step 129, the system receives a new\nor estimated value of the Parameter rn39denoted\nrn3(new)3 defines\n@ated\naverage\nvalue Of the Parmeter rn3 as rn3(avg;updated)=avg(r,,(avg)i\n\xe2\x80\x98n313 and\nthe value rn3(avg) by the value rn3(avg; lo\nupdated).\nIn step 131, the system provides a selected fourth component subset of N4 parameters, denoted r\xe2\x80\x99,, (n4=1, . ..,N4;\nNl+N2+N3+N41 l), from the set of situation parameters.\nIn step 133, for a set of measured or estimated values of 15\nthe situation p m e t e r r\xe2\x80\x99,,, the system provides a value v j\nif r\xe2\x80\x99,,, lies in a range r\xe2\x80\x99n4JSr\xe2\x80\x99n4u-\xe2\x80\x99n4J+1, r\xe2\x80\x99n4,1u-\xe2\x80\x99n4,2 .\nwhere\n..\ne , ,u=1 . . . ,J; Jh2); the values Vj may be distinct, or\n\xe2\x80\x99,,\n,\ntwo or more of the values v j may be the same. 1n one\nversion, the values Vj (=0 or 1) for a particular parameter 20\nvalue rn3may be expressed as a sequence (v1,v2, . . . ,VJ),\nwhere at most one of the values Vj has a value of 1, all other\nvalues Vj in the sequence being 0. For example, with J=3,\nthe ranges r\xe2\x80\x99n4JSr\xe2\x80\x99n4<T(n4J+,, correspond to low values,\nmay\nmedium values and high values of the parameter r\xe2\x80\x99,& The 25\npilot may, for example, request display of the selected set of\nweather data when the parameter r\xe2\x80\x99,, has a low value or a\nmedium value; and only the parameter data corresponding to\na low or medium values of this parameter (r\xe2\x80\x99,,,, sr\xe2\x80\x99n4a1,4,3)\n30\nwill be of interest for this situation (Vl=l or V2=1).\nWhen an aircraft is enroute, the system checks to determine if each of a selected subset of weather parameters falls\nno\nin a situation range (specified by the pilot a d r determined\nby the EARL algorithm). If each of the selected subset of\nweather parameters falls within the corresponding range, the 35\nsystem displays the corresponding weather information\nwithout a request by the pilot.\nIn a more general setting, this logic may be characterized\nas follows: (1) if each of a selected subset of weather\nparameters falls within a predetermined parameter range, 40\nand (2) if a pqticular location (airport, intersection, transition point) is on or adjacent to the route filed in the\napplicable flight plan, and (3) if the aircraft has not yet\n\npassed this location, display the corresponding weather\nparameter set. The system thus provides context-awareness,\nwhich may be characterized as task awareness relevant to\nthe aircraft domain of operation. Domain awareness takes\naccount of which elements of a M E T m m / W i n d s mofi\nreport are relevant to the display. Optionally, this contextawareness can be modified by the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s explicitly stated\npreference for (1) what range should be used for a situation\nparameter in a selected parameter subset, (2) what weather\npxameter(s) should be displayed in this event, and (3) how\nn\nshould the weather paremeter(s) be displayed (visually a d\nor audibly).\nTable 1 sets forth a set of queries tracked by EARL that\nCan be Verbally entered by the Pilot in Order to receive a\nvisual or audible display of a particular weather parameter.\nThe verbal queries include the following: \xe2\x80\x9cNearest DFR,\xe2\x80\x9d\nNearest VFR,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMETAR,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdensity altitude,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwind,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrosswind,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvisibility,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cceiling,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9celevation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cweather\nfrequency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csWgest runway;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctra\xe2\x82\xacfiC Pattern,\xe2\x80\x9d\ninformation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chighlight destination.\xe2\x80\x9d When the pilot\nWishes 10 Provide an a~dible\ndisplay Or a Visual display of\nMETm information, the Pilot Will speak the respective\nphrase \xe2\x80\x9csay MEMR\xe2\x80\x9dI or \xe2\x80\x9cshow METm.\xe2\x80\x9d This distinction\nbetween audible and visual display of specified information\nalso applies to the Other enh-k in Table 1.

EARL then fuses the situation in\neffect when the pilot made the request, using the minimum,\nmaximum, statistical average andor union of semi-quantitative measures as described above. On subsequent flights,\nwhan a similar situation is encountered, the system will\nautomatically volunteer the visibility, in this example, without requiring any pilot action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98mm\n\nTABLE 1\nVerbal E t y Of Pilot Display Preferences\nnr\nVerbal Request\n\nTL\n\nAs\n\n\xe2\x80\x98METAR\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\x98WearestIFR\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearestVFR\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cDensity Altitude\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWid\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrossWind\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWind Gust\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cVisibility\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cCeiling\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cElevation\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeather\nFrequency\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuggest Runway\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cTratficPattem\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAirpOIt\nInformation\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHighlight\nDestination\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCe\n\nAT(dew)\n\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\n\nv\n,\n\nv,(cr)\n\nx\nx\nx\n\nVIS\n\nx\nx\nx\n\nh(dens)\n\nx\nx\n\nT\n\nX\n\nx\n\nX\n\nx\n\nx\n\nX\n\nUS 7,129,857 B 1\nWhat is claimed is:\n4 The method of claim\n.\n1.
