Vortex systems of\nlarge aircraft contain winds which can be hazardous to other\nThe greatest hazard\naircraft encountering them in flight.\npotentials exist in areas where aircraft of a wide range of\nclasses are operating (e.g., light utility/observation and\nheavy transport/bomber).\nResults of analytical studies and flight tests are used to\ndescribe the formation and severity of trailing vortices and the\nspatial extent of their influence. This information is then\nused to outline procedures for ready application by pilots,\ntower operators, and others concerned with the flow of traffic.\nThe procedures provide the necessary appreciation of the\nphysical attributes of trailing vortices, the potential hazards\ninvolved when encountering them, and how best to avoid the\ndangerous portions of the wake during flight operations.\nNASA has a comprehensive research effort underway to better\ndescribe aircraft trailing vortex behavior and concurrently,\nother studies are aimed at the development of a concept either\nto discourage initial formation of high intensity vortices or to\nencourage early dissipation of the dangerous wake, through aircraft design.\nINTRODUCTION Trailing vortex systems, or the wake turbulence, of large transport type aircraft are known to have winds\nof hazardous intensities if encountered in flight by other aircraft (1-7). An additional troublesome aspect of the problem is\nthat the vortices which are generally difficult to detect behind\nthe large aircraft persist for quite some time after generation.\nThe wake turbulence of most concern to pilots is caused by the\ntrailing vortex system generated by the wing lift of large,\nheavy aircraft.\nPast theoretical studies and flight tests were concerned\nwith the extent of vortex system movement and intensity to\nimprove our understanding and acquaint aircraft operators with\n\n2\n\nthe perils inherent in vortex encounters (5-7). Now, very\nlarge, heavy aircraft are being placed in service, and a substantial increase in the number of aircraft operations can be\nexpected in the future (8). One of the limiting factors being\nconsidered in the spacing of aircraft using either the same\nrunway or adjacent runways is the invisible trailing vortex\nsystem. There is, then, a real need to explore ways to reduce\nthe delays and spacing between aircraft:\n(1) through improved\nunderstanding of trailing vortex behavior for different aircraft classes, modes of operation, and meteorological conditions,\n(2) by development of ways to monitor trailing vortex position\nand intensity in the airport area, and (3) by development of a\nmethod to either discourage initial formation of high intensity\nvortices or encourage early break up when once formed, through\naircraft design.\nIn this paper, aircraft trailing vortices and the hazard\npotentials they present to other aircraft are discussed. Interpretations of some results from flight tests and analytical\nstudies are outlined for operational use.\nWAKE TURBULENCE CHARACTERISTICS The circulation about an\nairfoil, necessary for wing lift, gives rise to the two rotating\ncylindrical air masses trailing aft along the flight path.\nTangential velocities within a vortex system close behind a\nheavy aircraft, as the C-5A, can be on the order of + 3600 ft/\nmin (7) as noted in figure 1.\nFlight test data (9) indicate\nthat velocities in vortex wakes can be equal to or greater than\n3600 ft/min up to 1\xc2\xbd miles aft of the C-5A, or 30 seconds after\naircraft passage. Tangential velocities for a particular aircraft vary directly with the aircraft weight and inversely with\naircraft velocity as shown in the figure. The more intense\nvortices then are generated when the aircraft is flying slow, as\nin the airfield area and during some support missions. The term\nin the brackets of the tangential velocity equation in figure 1\naccounts for vortex velocity deterioration with time. Possibly\nthe major factors to note are that vertical velocities about the\nrotating air masses of a vortex system can vary as much as\n+ 3600 ft/min over a very short distance (a fraction of a wing\nspan), as shown in figure 1, and that these rotating air masses\ncan impose large rolling moments on other aircraft. In addition, mutual interaction of the vortices induces a downward\nmovement of the system which is discussed later..\nDuring some flight test experiments axial flow, that is,\nvelocities along the center of the vortex core, were observed.\nIn figure 1 the axial flow would be perpendicular to the plane\n\n3\n\nof the paper within the two smaller circles. This flow phenomenon is not well understood. An understanding of the cause and\neffect of this flow will be necessary for an adequate theoreti-\n\ncal description of vortex behavior. However, it appears at this\ntime that axial flow is of little, if any, operational concern\nand will not be considered further in this paper.\nElements influencing vortex system behavior are summarized\nin figure 2. The number of elements indicates the complexity of\ndeveloping a method for precise definition of vortex movement\nand intensity in the many situations that could exist. In a\nlater section the available knowledge of vortex behavior is used\nto develop avoidance procedures for the various flight regimes.\nJet engine wake velocities and temperatures are shown in\nfigure 3 for the C-5A at takeoff thrust (10). The jet-enginewake airstream is turbulent and not well organized, and velocities for even this high thrust condition dissipate to 35 mph in\nabout 1200 feet. The rapidly dissipating jet wake is believed\nto present no hazard to other aircraft from an unexpected\ninflight encounter standpoint and is of no further concern in\nthis paper.\nHAZARD POTENTIALS In figure 4 is shown an illustration of\na trailing vortex system with a velocity distribution perpendicular to a line through the vortex centers some distance behind\nthe generating airplane. Upwash and downwash velocities are\napparent. Different hazard potentials of aircraft encountering\nthese velocities are shown. An aircraft penetrating the core of\na vortex would experience imposed rolling moments. An aircraft\nsubject to the downwash would have to contend with a loss in\nrate of climb or an increase in rate of descent. If the penetrating aircraft approaches perpendicular to the vortex system,\nas along a line through the vortex centers, structural load\nfactors would be the principal concern and, in addition, a bumpy\nride would surely result.\nIn addition to the direct hazards just mentioned, there is\na more subtle hazard related to pilot startle effect, because\noften vortex encounters are most pronounced when the atmosphere\nis well behaved and the pilot is experiencing smooth flight.\nAvailable reaction time to recover from vortex induced upsets\nnear the ground can be brief enough and any unnerving effect\ndelaying counter maneuvers would not be welcome.\nHelicopters in forward flight spawn vortices with relatively intense velocities, compared to aircraft of equal weight,\n\n4\n\nand can be of operational concern to light plane pilots (6).\nThe vortex system of larger and heavier V/STOL aircraft planned\nfor future use should be continuously assessed in the early\nstages of development to achieve a full appreciation of the\noperational problems involved.\nThe hazard potential of trailing vortices is greatest in\nareas where a wide range of aircraft classes are operating (e.g.,\nlight utility/observation and heavy transport/bomber). Certainly airport areas are relatively hazardous because of the proximity of aircraft and the number of operations. Generally\nspeaking the magnitude of any problem imposed on aircraft\nencountering a vortex will depend on the magnitude of the velocities as well as the size, performance capabilities, and altitude of the penetrating aircraft.\nEXTENT OF THE HAZARD It was previously mentioned that\nvortices have an inherent characteristic to move downward when\nformed. Figure 5 illustrates the vortex system movement far\nfrom the ground in a constant atmospheric density environment.\nTwo principal factors are readily apparent: first, the vortices\nmove downward in equal increments with time and, second, the\nvortex system drifts with the wind while at the same time maintaining the tendency to move downward with time, as in the nowind case. The vortices form just inboard of the wing tips and\nremain so spaced, unless disturbed by turbulence or some other\nfactor, as mentioned before. The illustration of figure 5 is\nnot too unrealistic except that the influence of the denser air\nencountered by the downward moving vortices has not been taken\ninto account.\nConsider that the vortices entrain air at some altitude.\nThese cylinders of relatively light air are forced downward into\na denser atmosphere by the inherent action of the system. It is\nreasonable to expect then that the downward movement will slow\nwith time, assuming there is but a gradual diffusion of energy\noutward to maintain an essentially constant force, over the time\nperiod of interest.\nForces acting on the vortices in a calm atmosphere were\nestimated and are presented in figure 6.\nIn the estimates made,\nthe vortices are described as cylindrical air masses which wrap\nup aft of the airplane, in this example along a flight path at\n12,000 feet altitude. For computational purposes a 1 foot\nlength of a trailing vortex cylinder 100 feet in diameter is\nused. This volume of air weighs approximately 417 pounds at\n12,000 feet altitude. As this air mass is forced downward by\n\nthe vortex system interaction the upward force (bouyancy)\nincreases to about 15 pounds at a 11,000 foot altitude, at\nwhich point the upward force equals the downward force, the\nforce inherent in the vortex system. Equalization of forces\nwould be expected to occur following a downward movement of\napproximately 1000 feet as shown in the figure. Obviously at\nthis altitude the downward movement stops, if no other outside\nforces come into play, as illustrated in figure 7.\nThe small magnitude of the forces shown in figure 6 illustrates the belief that the trailing vortex system is delicately\nbalanced and subject to the many perturbations actually present\nin the atmosphere. One of these perturbations is undoubtedly\nthermal effects, which seem to be always present, while another\nmight be atmospheric wave action. Figure 8 illustrates thermal\neffects which can be present over changing terrain. These\neffects on vortex system vertical travel might not be operationally significant and are discussed later; however, it would\nappear to be premature to state that vortices will never descend\nmore than 1000 feet, as noted in the example of figure 6.\nThen,\ntoo, thermal and wave action of sufficient magnitude can lead to\nthe early disruption of the vortices. Gentle, moving currents\nwithout marked discontinuities are expected to cause little\nreduction in vortex persistence.\nThe wake locations behind the C-5A for several test runs\nare given in figure 9.\nThe vertical displacements are encompassed by a theoretical line derived from the information given\nin reference 7.\nThe vertical displacement of the wake does tend\nto level off about 1000 feet below the flight path of the C-5A\nfor the atmospheric conditions existing during these limited\ntests. The wake remained intact for distances exceeding 10\nnautical miles behind the C-SA.\nThe roll response of three aircraft (DC-9, Cessna 210,\nLear Jet) on encountering the C-5A wake at various distances\nastern (9) are shown in figure 10.\nThe weight spread of these\naircraft extended from about 70,000 pounds to-about 3,000\npounds. The roll response was achieved despite the best efforts\nof the pilot to counter the bank angles imposed. Obviously\nupsets of this type could be hazardous. A practical limit of300 bank angle was set and noted on the figure, assuming this\nbank angle would be about all a pilot would want to contend\nwith, especially in holding patterns, during approach to landing\nand shortly after takeoff. Other important items, related to\nthis 300 bank angle, are the separation distance of 8 miles and\ntime lapse of 2.7 minutes, after the C-5 passage. These items\n\n6\n\nare considered later in development of safe avoidance procedures.\nPrevious mention was made of the load factors which an\nairplane could experience when traversing the vortices, as along\na line through the vortex centers. Calculated normal load\nfactors (5) imposed on a light aircraft crossing the wake of a\nheavy transport aircraft (180,000 pounds), perpendicular to the\nflight path and along a line through the vortex centers, are\nshown in figure 11.\nTwo important facts should be pointed out:\nthe first is that relatively high load factors were reached\nduring the elevator fixed traverse and the second is that elevator motion, initiated by the pilot to counter initial upwash of\nthe vortex, compounded the hazard and in this instance ultimate\nload factors were reached.\nLoad factors measured during flight tests are shown by the\ncross hatched areas in figure 11. The load factors, measured\non a T-33 aircraft and a U-3A (Cessna 310) aircraft during\npenetration of wakes from large aircraft, are of a preliminary\nnature. The large aircraft were not at maximum weights and the\nexact locations of the penetrating aircraft relative to the\ncenter of the wake are not known. The point is that measured\nload factors are about what was expected. It appears that even\nhigher load factors could be experienced when light aircraft\nencounter the wake of heavier, large transport aircraft under\nmore adverse conditions. The penetrating aircraft in each of\nthese incidents was relatively close behind the heavier aircraft\ngenerating the wake--about 1.5 miles or about 30 seconds after\npassage. Large load factors could be imposed on light aircraft\nfor vortex ages up to 1\xc2\xbd minutes or approximately 5 miles behind\nlarge, heavy transports.\nAnother important feature of the situation wherein large\nload factors can be imposed on a light aircraft is that, at\nleast one of the vortex cores must be penetrated. There is a\nmarked reduction in the magnitude of imposed load factors when\nthe aircraft is but a short distance (-,25 feet) above or below\nthe line through the vortex centers (5). In other words, to\nexperience high load factors it is necessary to pass close to\nat least one of the vortex cores, possibly an explanation of why\ncatastrophic accidents related to structural failures (1) are\nfortunately rare.\nVortex system movement near the ground is illustrated in\nfigure 12. With no wind the settling rate continues until the\nvortices approach to within about a wing span of the ground.\n\n7\n\nAt this distance the settling rate slows and the lateral spread\ncommences, here again, at a rate equal to the settling rate (7).\nThe vortices spread out at a height above the ground equal to\nabout a wing semispan. The effects of a crosswind are illustrated in figure 12. For example, with a crosswind component\ncountering the lateral spread, one vortex remains stationary\nover the ground while the other vortex drifts laterally at an\nincreased velocity as shown in the figure. In addition, head\nwind and tail wind components would cause the vortices to drift\nalong the runway, in addition to the lateral movement. Factors\ninvolved in application of these characteristics for operational\nprocedures are discussed next.\nTo put some reasonable bound on the time vortices might be\nof concern to other aircraft the estimated duration obtained\nfrom reference 7 was modified to represent the more recent\nflight experience given in figure 10.\nIt was noted that 300\nbank angles could be imposed for separation times of 2.7 minutes\nafter C-5A passage. For these calculations a maximum vortex\nduration time of 3 minutes (see figure 13) was selected for use\nin the development of bounds beyond which safe flight would be\nassured.\nMaximum vortex travel near the ground was calculated, using\nthe information of reference 7 and figure 13, and is shown in\nfigure 14.\nIt can be seen that maximum wind drift occurs at\nwind speeds of between 10 and 20 knots. Also, the lateral movement of the vortex, due to inherent characteristics discussed\npreviously, is seen to reach about 1400 feet in 3 minutes, the\nmaximum age for which the vortex is expected to be a threat to\nother aircraft. The maximum lateral travel, realized when conditions are such that the wind drift and lateral movement compliment each other, is over 3000 feet. A value of 3500 feet was\nselected to represent the maximum lateral vortex travel from the\nrunway centerline, as shown in figure 15.\nOf course the wind can come from many angles. In figure\n16, the vortex movement near the ground with the wind from 300\nport is shown. The displacements of the right and left vortices\nare shown for winds up to 40 knots. The extent of movement is\nlimited by the vortex duration times of figure 13. An interesting point is the location of the left vortex position in a 10\nknot wind from 300 port. The vortex is located directly over\nthe runway at a time 2 minutes after generation. The vortex\nfrom the right wing tip has drifted off to the right of the\nrunway in the same period, as shown.\n\n8\n\nCalculations of vortex movement for wind directions of zero\ndegrees to 900 and from the port and from the starboard results\nin a family of curves.- An envelope about this family of curves\nis shown in the shaded area of figure 17 and sets the bounds of\nvortex travel, within which vortex velocities could be of\nconcern.\nThe vortex travel shown in figure 17 seems rather extensive.\nHowever, flight tests (7,11) made near the ground indicate that\nthe vortices move about as expected for the conditions investigated. An accident (4) caused by a vortex that drifted a distance possibly exceeding 600 feet also tends to substantiate the\ncalculations to a further degree. Observations of flight tests\nnear the ground suggest that vortices can drift for a considerable time without apparent disruption (on the order of 2 minutes)\nunder relatively calm wind conditions.\nThere is an uncertainty related to the minimum aircraft\naltitude at which the trailing vortex system has the time and\ninclination to roll up fully, as shortly after takeoff. In\nfigure 18 the vortex envelope and footprint are illustrated\nunder the flight path from rotation to an altitude of 1000 feet.\nThe vortex envelope is positioned for several locations along\nthe flight path for which full vortex roll-up is assumed; (1)\nat rotation, (2) at an altitude equivalent to a wing semispan,\nand (3) at an altitude equivalent to a wing span. The footprint aligned with the rotation point, as shown previously in\nfigure 17, was selected and used in the next section to make\nsure that pilots of following aircraft can avoid the vortex\nhazard.\nAVOIDANCE PROCEDURES The previous discussion dealt with\nresults of analytical studies and flight tests to describe the\nbehavior of trailing vortices generated by large transport aircraft. This information is now used to develop procedures for\navoiding the damaging manifestations of vortex systems.\nInformation from figures 9 and 10 was used to derive the\nenvelope of vortex vertical location aft of a large transport\naircraft as shown in figure 19. Pilots could possibly encounter\nlarge load factors, bank angles, and roll rates in the shaded\narea. Atmospheric turbulence as well as aircraft which generate\nvortices of less intensity can shrink these areas. The lateral\ndisplacement envelope shown in figure 19 accounts for wind drift\nof the vortices under crosswind conditions, as described in\nfigure 14. An aircraft penetrating the shaded areas would not\nnecessarily encounter a vortex because of their respective\n\n9\n\nlocations, but wise pilots should avoid this air space by\nstaying either above the flight path of the large aircraft or at\nleast 1000 feet below. Of course, time spacing and distance\nseparation of 3 minutes and up to 10 miles, respectively, of\naircraft behind the large aircraft would be adequate to avoid\ndangerous encounters.\nUsing information from figure 17 the suggested takeoff\nprofile for light aircraft following heavier aircraft is shown\nin figure 20.\nIn general, an aircraft can avoid a possible\nencounter with the wake by lifting off 3000 feet short of the\nrotation point of the preceding heavy aircraft. Following takeoff it would be to the light plane pilot\'s advantage to remain\non the upwind side and above the flight path of the larger aircraft. Adequate runway would be available if the smaller aircraft starts the takeoff roll at the same location on the runway\nas did the larger aircraft. Pilots should take special care if\nthe takeoff roll is started at other points along the runway, as\nat an intersecting runway or taxiway, where liftoff can occur\nnearer than 3000 feet to the rotation point of the larger\naircraft.\nIt was shown in figure 17 that the vortices might drift to\nrunways other than the one used by the larger aircraft. Therefore pilots planning to take off on parallel or intersecting\nrunways should consider the possibility of a vortex hazard and\nplan accordingly, using the information provided in figures 17\nand 20. An example of the application of this information to\nparticular airfield situations is shown later.\nThe envelope of figure 17 is also applicable to approach\nand touchdown procedures. The rotation point noted in the\nfigure can be considered the touchdown point for this application. Under some landing conditions, with a small tail wind\ncomponent, the vortices can drift 500 feet down the runway (7)\nfollowing touchdown of the large aircraft under the most adverse\ncondition. This drift and the suggested touchdown procedure for\nlight aircraft following heavy aircraft are sketched in figure\n21. In general, light aircraft pilots should plan to touch down\n2500 feet beyond the touchdown point of the larger aircraft. As\nan example, if a large aircraft touches down 1500 feet from the\nthreshold the light aircraft should land 2500 feet beyond or at\nabout the 4000 foot marker to avoid a possible vortex encounter.\nLight aircraft, using the instrument landing system (ILS)\nand visual approach slope indicator (VASI) (at airfields used by\nlarge heavy aircraft), should stay on the high side of the glide\n\n10\n\nslope and to the upwind side as shown in figure 22. Smaller,\nslower aircraft are sometimes routed in airport traffic at a\nlower altitude and in tighter patterns than the larger faster\naircraft. If the light plane pilot is faced with this situation\nwhile turning from the downwind leg to the base leg it is essential that he remain above the flight path of the larger aircraft\nif at all possible. A high percentage of vortex accidents seems\nto be caused when the light aircraft approaches the airport on\nfinal leg at a lower altitude than the preceding aircraft (2).\nIn addition, should the large aircraft execute a missed approach\nspecial precautions should be exercised by the following aircraft as can be surmised from previous discussions.\nThe envelope of figure 17 is shown plotted on an airport\nlayout in figure 23 to depict that vortices from a large aircraft using one runway might well influence the takeoff or\nlanding of aircraft using the same or another runway. Numbers\nin the runway indicate distances from the threshold in thousands\nof feet. The parallel runways 9L and 9R are 5000 feet apart.\nFour examples are used to illustrate use of the vortex system\nenvelope to permit pilots, following large aircraft, to avoid\nvortices that could impose a hazardous situation.\nIn the upper left of the figure a large aircraft is shown\nat touchdown 1500 feet from the threshold on runway 9L. A\nfollowing light plane, using the same runway, should touch down\n2500 feet further down the runway or 4000 feet from the threshold as shown for example A, keeping in mind previous procedures\nof remaining above the approach path of the heavy aircraft. In\nexample C, a light plane landing on runway 12 following the\nheavy aircraft that just landed on runway 9L at the 1500 foot\nmarker should touch down 3500 feet from the threshold to surely\navoid the vortices located somewhere in the plotted envelope,\npossibly along the first 1000 feet of runway 12.\nAnother example (B) of envelope application is given for\nthe large aircraft taking off from runway 9L, where liftoff or\nrotation occurred at the 9500 foot mark. A following light\naircraft should lift off no later than at the 7000 foot marker\nto avoid possible wake turbulence. After liftoff the light\nplane pilot should follow previously discussed procedures of\nremaining above and just to the upwind side of the flight path\nof the heavier aircraft.\nIn the fourth example (D), a large aircraft is shown lifting off from runway 9R at the 7500 foot mark. The envelope\ncovering possible vortex locations for a variety of wind\n\n11\n\nconditions that might exist is shown to cover parts of three\nrunways - 9R, 12, and 17. A light aircraft planning to use\nrunway 12 should plan the takeoff roll so as to lift off just\nbeyond the 3000 foot marker, to avoid possible wake turbulence\nfrom the heavy aircraft that took off previously from runway 9R.\nIt appears that pilot application of the vortex system\nenvelope at airfields could be done with readily available\ninformation during preflight planning exercises. Generally the\nrunway length and airfield layout as shown in the example of\nfigure 23 are available for pilot use, as for instance, in\nreference 12.\nThe pilot would require knowledge of the large\ntype aircraft operating at the airfield in order to estimate the\npoint of rotation and make the best use of the vortex system\nenvelope during preflight planning. This probably is a logical\nand necessary requirement for safe operational planning under\nany circumstances.\nPILOT POCKET AID It is recognized that the avoidance\nprocedures discussed and explained previously are not in the\nmost convenient forms for ready application by pilots and others.\nHence, any advantages that might be realized from the information accrued and flight experience gained on the trailing vortex\nhazard problem would probably not be put to optimum use.\nTo help with this problem, it is suggested that the essential information be made available on a pocket size card (6),\nas shown in figure 24, which the pilot could use in preflight\nplanning. One side lists the operational tips on how best to\navoid the vortex wake. On the other side is a sectional grid,\nmarked at 1000 foot intervals, allowing a pencil sketch to be\nmade of the runway layout for particular airfields being used\n(a plasticized surface is suggested to permit easy erasures and\nreuse). In the upper right corner is the scaled vortex envelope\nfor replotting by the pilot to the runway point where heavy aircraft land or take off, as it might affect his use of the airfield, in a manner similar to the example of figure 23.\nAIRCRAFT VORTEX RESEARCH The NASA is carrying out detailed\naerodynamic research with the aim of uncovering candidate\nschemes to promote either early break up of the vortex system or\nalteration of the flow to eliminate unfavorable characteristics\nof concern to following aircraft. Either of these solutions\nwould be an acceptable means to remove all of the elements of\nthe trailing vortex problem; the hazards, the economic penalties, and the passenger discomfort.\n\n12\n\nThose concerned with the research have considered several\ndifferent basic ideas that might warrant further study, such as\nwing tip shape, engine location, air jets, lift modulation, etc.\nThese ideas are discussed in more detail in reference 13.\nClosely related to any successes in the wind tunnel or water\nchannel will be the flight test phase both to verify the model\ntests and evaluate the scheme as a practical way to solve the\nproblem.\nOne question often raised is in regard to the possible\nvortex intensity of new type aircraft, as the STOL vehicles and\nthe supersonic transports. NASA scientists working with experimental aircraft are aware of the trailing vortex problem and\nhopefully will cope with this aspect of aircraft development to\nthe extent possible.\nCONCLUSIONS Aircraft wake turbulence, or trailing vortex\nsystems, of heavy transport aircraft extend aft along the flight\npath for considerable distances. The vortical winds in these\nsystems are of magnitudes hazardous to other aircraft. Aircraft\nencountering these winds can experience problems associated with\nlarge bank angles, changes in rate of climb or descent, and\nstructural load factors.\nIt is difficult to know precisely the location and severity\nof wake turbulence in operational situations, due in part to the\nlack of both fine-scale environmental information and knowledge\nof operating factors of the generating aircraft. For this\nreason, the whereabouts and intensity of the wake turbulence for\na particularly severe situation were determined for a wide range\nof circumstances. The travel and persistence of this wake turbulence were used to define bounds from which general avoidance\nprocedures were derived for ready use. In part, the bounds of\nturbulence intensity and movement were verified by flight test\ninformation.\nNASA has a comprehensive research effort underway to better\ndescribe aircraft trailing vortex formation, persistence, and\nwhereabouts and concurrently, other studies are aimed at the\ndevelopment of a concept either to discourage formation of\nintense trailing vortices or to induce early dissipation of the\ndangerous wake.\nThe short term goal of this work is to develop optimum\navoidance procedures. The final goal is to eliminate waketurbulence-related problems of general aviation pilots, commercial carriers, passengers, and the air traffic system.\n\n13\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n9.\n\n10.\n11.\n\n12.\n13.\n\nAnon: Aircraft Accident Report - Piper Model PA-22, N2945P,\nFile No. 2-0124,\nNear Dover, Delaware, Sept. 23, 1958.\nCAB, Oct. 10, 1959.\n(Navion-A accident)\nAnon:\nSafety Information release.\nSB68-23, NTSB, Mar. 21, 1968.\n(Twin Otter DHC-6 acciAnon: Safety Information release.\ndent) SB69-55 NTSB, Jul. 28, 1969.\n(Cessna 310H accident)\nAnon: Safety Information release.\nSB70-60 NTSB, Aug. 11, 1970.\nCalculated Normal Load Factors on\nMcGowan, William A.:\nLight Airplanes Traversing the Trailing Vortices of Heavy\nTransport Airplanes.
