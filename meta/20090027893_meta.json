Sharply increased food and energy prices in 2008 brought the role of markets in food access and availability around the world into the spotlight, particularly in urban areas. The period of high prices had the immediate consequence of sharply increasing the number of hungry people in the region without boosting farmer incomes significantly. In this article, the interaction between markets, food prices, agricultural technology and development is explored in the context of West Africa. To improve food security in West Africa, sustained commitment to investment in the agriculture sector will be needed to provide some protection against global swings in both production and world markets. Climate change mitigation programs are likely to force global energy and commodity price increases in the coming decades, putting pressure on regions like West Africa to produce more food locally to ensure stability in food security for the most vulnerable.", "title": "Markets, Climate Change and Food Security in West Africa", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T18:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090027893, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brown, Molly E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "5ef99919c6374af0ab9b2890bb10e732"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20090027893, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hintermann, Beat"}, "organization": {"name": "Swiss Federal Inst. of Technology", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland"}}, "id": "a50f9f986d69480399268fb59e848aaa"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20090027893, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Higgins, Nathaniel"}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park, MD, United States"}}, "id": "2672aea6cff9418cb98d730e3a111447"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090027893, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090027893, "id": "8b3ad8a7912646f19712af4784eb0096", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090027893.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090027893/downloads/20090027893.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090027893/downloads/20090027893.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090027893/downloads/20090027893.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
