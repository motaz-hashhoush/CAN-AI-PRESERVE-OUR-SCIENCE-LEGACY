In many embodiments, the communication systems use specific geometric constellations that are capacity optimized at a specific SNR. In addition, ranges within which the constellation points of a capacity optimized constellation can be perturbed and are still likely to achieve a given percentage of the optimal capacity increase compared to a constellation that maximizes d.sub.min, are also described. Capacity measures that are used in the selection of the location of constellation points include, but are not limited to, parallel decode (PD) capacity and joint capacity.", "title": "Methods and Apparatuses for Signaling with Geometric Constellations", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2018-04-24T08:52:27.1900000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20180002512, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barsoum, Maged F."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "1d1d3b5c53424245a8f991815403e5fc"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20180002512, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jones, Christopher R."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "889c47c36deb45aab21376ea6ec9a002"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20180002512, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180002512, "id": "48c8d218e1494bf7b23c0418b26a149c", "publicationDate": "2018-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180002512.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180002512/downloads/20180002512.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180002512/downloads/20180002512.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180002512/downloads/20180002512.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
