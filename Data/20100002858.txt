Refer to NPO-40268.\n\nUsing G4FETs as a Data Router for In-Plane Crossing of\nSignal Paths\nCross-talk is low enough that integrity of signals could be preserved.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nTheoretical analysis and some experiments have demonstrated that siliconon-insulator (SOI) 4-gate transistors of\nthe type known as G4FETs could be efficiently used for in-plane crossing of signal paths. Much of the effort of designing very-large-scale integrated (VLSI)\ncircuits is focused on area-efficient routing of signals. The main source of difficulty in VLSI signal routing is the requirement to prevent crossing, in the\nsame plane, of wires that are meant to be\nkept electrically insulated from each\nother. Consequently, it often becomes\nnecessary to design and build VLSI circuits in multiple layers with vias (connections between conductors in different\nlayers at selected locations). Suitable devices that would prevent, or at least sufficiently suppress, undesired electrical\ncoupling (cross-talk) between wires\ncrossing in the same plane would enable\ncompact, simpler implementation of\ncomplex interconnection networks with\nin-plane crossings that, heretofore, have\nnot been possible in VLSI circuitry. The\nuse of G4FETs as in-plane signal-crossing\ndevices or routers, in combination with\nthe use of G4FETs as universal programmable logic gates, would create opportunities for reducing complexity in VLSI\ndesign.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nn+\nD2\n\nPolycrystalline\nSilicon Top Gate\n\ny\nn Body\n\np+\nS1\n\nx\n\nn+\nS2\n\np+\nD1\n\nBuried Oxide Layer\nSubstrate\n\nFigure 1. The G4FET consists of a p-channel inversion-mode MOSFET (including source S1 and drain D1)\nfor current flowing in the x direction and an accumulation-mode n-channel MOSFET (including source\nS2 and drain D2) for current flowing in the y direction. The gate, body and substrate are common to\nboth transistors.\n\nA G4FET, depicted in simplified form\nin Figure 1, has the same basic structure\nas does a prior SOI cross-MOSFET\n(metal oxide/semiconductor field-effect\ntransistor), though the cross-MOSFET is\nsomewhat wider. The cross-MOSFET\nconsists essentially of an inversion-mode\nand an accumulation-mode MOSFET\nthat share gate and substrate terminals\n\nand are oriented perpendicularly to\neach other. The prior use of the crossMOSFET involved sequential operation\nof the inversion-mode and accumulation-mode MOSFETs. In contrast, the\nuse of the G4FET as an in-plane router\ninvolves the simultaneous operation of\nthe inversion-mode MOSFET in one inplane direction and the accumulation-\n\n5\n\nVD2\xe2\x89\xa50\n\nY\n\nID2\nD2\n\nX\n\nG1\n\nn\n\np+\nID1\n\nn+\n\np+\n\nS1\n\nD1\n\nID1\n\nVD1\xe2\x89\xa40\n\nn+\nS2\nID2\n\nFigure 2.

The drain (D1) of\nthe inversion-mode p-channel MOSFET is\nbiased to VD1, the drain (D2) of the accumulation-mode n-channel MOSFET is biased to VD2, and the source terminals (S1\nand S2) of both transistors are grounded.\n\nThe two drain currents, ID1 and ID2, are\nperpendicular to each other and can flow\nat the same time. ID1 depends on minority\ncharge carriers and flows at the surface in\nthe x direction, while ID2 depends on majority carriers and flows at the mid-depth\nof the silicon film in the y direction. Surface holes and bulk electrons do not recombine because front-gate-induced depletion region isolates them. The top gate\ncan modulate both drain currents \xe2\x80\x94 ID1\nthrough regular MOS action and ID2\nthrough vertical-depletion-width modulation. ID1 and ID2 can also weakly modulate\neach other \xe2\x80\x94 an undesirable effect in that\nit results in some cross-talk. In operation\nof the G4FET as a router, S1 and S2 would\nbe disconnected from ground and signals\nwould be applied to D1 and D2 for the\npurpose of coupling them to S1 and S2, respectively. In experiments on a G4FET that\nhad not been optimized for use as a\nrouter, square-wave signals of various frequencies from 1 kHz to 1 MHz were applied to D1 and D2 simultaneously and\nwere shown to be coupled to S1 and S2, respectively, as desired. Cross-talk was ob-\n\nserved, but was found to be within conventional noise margins. This result supports\nthe expectation that the integrity of digital\nsignals could be preserved when using\nG4FETs as routers.\nThis work was done by Amir Fijany, Farrokh Vatan, Mohammad Mojarradi,\nNikzad Toomarian, Travis Johnson, Elizabeth Kolawa, Benjamin Blalock, Sorin\nCristoloveanu, Suheng Chen, and Kerem\nAkarvardar of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nTwo algorithms for processing the digitized readings of electronic noses, and\ncomputer programs to implement the\nalgorithms, have been devised in a continuing effort to increase the utility of\nelectronic noses as means of identifying\nairborne compounds and measuring\ntheir concentrations. One algorithm\nidentifies the two vapors in a two-vapor\nmixture and estimates the concentration\nof each vapor (in principle, this algorithm could be extended to more than\ntwo vapors). The other algorithm identifies a single vapor and estimates its concentration.\nAn electronic nose consists of an array\nof sensors, all of which respond to a variety of chemicals. By design, each sensor\nis unique in its responses to these chemicals: some or all of the sensitivities of a\ngiven sensor to the various vapors differ\nfrom the corresponding sensitivities of\nanother sensor. The two algorithms exploit these sensitivities and the differences among them.\nThe validity of the two-vapor algorithm depends on the validity of the assumption that, of all the vapors of inter-\n\n6\n\nest, no more than two of them are present at the time of measurement. This algorithm utilizes the following mathematical model of the response of a given\nsensor to a given pair of vapors:\nz = A + (Bx C + Dy E ) F,\nwhere z is the sensor response, x and y\nare the concentrations of the two vapors,\nand parameters A through F are obtained by least-squares best fit of sensor\nresponses to known concentrations of\nthe individual vapors and to known concentrations of mixtures of the two vapors. The reason for choosing this\nmodel is that this research has shown it\nto be the best for mixtures of vapors.\nThe model equation defines a response\nsurface of the given sensor for the given\npair of vapors.\nGiven the responses of an electronic\nnose to an unknown single vapor or\ntwo-vapor mixture, the first step of this\nalgorithm is to calculate the difference\nbetween (1) the actual response of\neach sensor and (2) the model response of the sensor for an assumed\n\npair of vapors. This calculation yields\nan error surface for the given sensor\nfor the given two vapors. Next, the\nerror surfaces thus calculated for all\nthe sensors in the array are combined\nto obtain an error surface for the electronic nose with respect for the assumed two vapors. Next, the process as\ndescribed thus far is performed for a\ndifferent pair of vapors. The process is\nrepeated until error surfaces for all\npossible pairs of vapors have been\ncalculated.\nIt is necessary to find the minimum\npoint on the electronic-nose error surface for each pair of vapors. In the present version of the algorithm, this is done\nby sampling values on a grid and selecting the sample that has the minimum\nvalue. In a subsequent enhanced version\nof the algorithm, a more sophisticated\ntechnique (e.g., gradient descent) might\nbe used to find the minimum. The pair\nof vapors for which the electronic-nose\nerror surface has the lowest minimum\nvalue is deemed to be identified as the\nvapor pair sensed by the electronic nose.\nProvided that this identification is cor-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\neters A and B are obtained by leastsquares best fit of sensor responses at\nknown values of x. This model is appropriate because it gives both the expected zero response at zero concentration and saturation response at high\nconcentration.\nThe first step of the single-vapor algorithm is to identify the vapor by applying standard statistical pattern-recognition techniques to the responses of the\nelectronic nose. Assuming that the\nvapor has been correctly identified, one\ncould, in principle, estimate the concentration by applying the inverse of\nthe model to the responses of all sensors in the nose. The question is how\n\nrect, the concentrations of the two vapors are the coordinates of the location\nof the minimum on the error surface for\nthat pair.\nThe validity of the single-vapor algorithm depends on the validity of the assumption that, of all the vapors of interest, only one is present at the time of\nmeasurement. This algorithm utilizes\nthe following mathematical model of\nthe response of a given sensor to a single vapor:\nz = A(1 \xe2\x80\x93 e Bx ),\nwhere z is the sensor response, x is the\nconcentration of the vapor, and param-\n\nbest to utilize the readings of all the\nsensors in the nose to obtain the best\nestimate. Research has answered the\nquestion: the best estimate is obtained\nby inverting the reading of a single sensor known to be best for the vapor that\nhas been identified. Accordingly, the algorithm chooses the sensor found to be\nbest for the identified vapor and calculates the concentration from the reading of that sensor.\nThis work was done by Rebecca Young of\nKennedy Space Center and Bruce Linnell\nand Barbara Peterson of ASRC Aerospace.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nKSC-12725/20\n\nRadiation-Tolerant Dual Data Bus\nDedicated hardware and software would detect radiation-induced upsets on either of two buses.\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nAn architecture, and a method of utilizing the architecture, have been proposed to enable error-free operation of\na data bus that includes, and is connected to, commercial off-the-shelf\n(COTS) circuits and components that\nare inherently susceptible to singleevent upsets [SEUs (bit flips caused by\nimpinging high-energy particles and\nphotons)]. The architecture and\nmethod are applicable, more specifically, to data-bus circuitry based on the\nInstitute for Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers (IEEE) 1394b standard for a\nhigh-speed serial bus.\nThe architecture and method call for\nthe use of two IEEE 1394b buses that\nnominally carry identical data signals. It\n\nis assumed that at all times, at least one\nof the buses is \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that\nit carries complete and correct data signals. Electronic hardware and software\noperating at each receiving location\n(node) along the bus would select the\ndata arriving on the \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d bus while\nignoring possibly corrupted data arriving on the other bus, which could be\noperating under latchup or an SEU including, possibly, a single-event functional interrupt (SEFI, an SEU that\nchanges a control logic level, causing\nthe affected circuit to enter an erroneous operational mode or logic state,\nthe recovery from which must be effected through a power reset or other\nspecified procedure).\n\nIEEE 1394b Primary Bus\nIEEE 1394b Secondary Bus\nNode 1\n\nNode 2\n\nNode N\nPhysical-Layer Chip\nLink-Layer Chip\n\nRadiation-Hard\nMicrocontroller\n(Optional)\n\nNetworkInterface\nCards\n\nRadiation-Hard\nSBC (Optional)\n\nCompact Peripheral Component\nInterface Backplane\n\nTwo IEEE 1394b Buses would nominally carry identical data signals. The network interface circumvention circuits, with the help of the microcontrollers, would detect radiation-induced upsets on either\nbus.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nThe hardware at each node would include network-interface circuits plus\nspecial-purpose circuits denoted circumvention circuits. Among the circumvention circuits would be bus-management\ncircuits and watchdog timers that would\nmonitor the network interface chips.\nUse of software would examine the outputs of these circumvention monitoring\ncircuits to detect SEUs (including\nSEFIs). Latchups in radiation-sensitive\nIEEE 1394b bus components would be\ndetected by current-sensing circumvention circuits. Upon detection of an SEU\n(including an SEFI) or latchup, other\ncircumvention circuits would restore\ncorrect operation by turning off, then\nturning back on, then reinitializing the\naffected bus circuitry, all within a predetermined, acceptably short time.\nThe software would reside in a dedicated radiation-hard microcontroller or\nshared radiation-hard single-board computer (SBC).\nThis work was done by Gary A.

(In\ngeneral, photoelectrochemical cells convert incident light to electricity through\nelectrochemical reactions.) It is predicted\nthat in comparison with state-of-the-art\nphotoelectrochemical cells, these cells\nwill be found to operate with greater solarto-electric energy-conversion efficiencies.\nThe proposed cells could be fabricated by layering nanocomposites of active particles with organic binders on\nflexible polymer substrates. Each cell\nwould contain a dye-sensitized semiconductor electrode, a proton-conducting\nsolid electrolyte, and a solid-state pro-\n\nton-intercalation counter electrode. By\ndesigning the cells to rely on protons as\nthe charge carriers, it should be possible\nto enable the cells to sustain rates of\ntransport and concentrations of charge\ncarriers greater than those of state-ofthe-art photoelectrochemical cells designed to rely on hole conduction and\norganic semiconductors.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe figure depicts a portable, handheld power drill with its attached\npower-supply unit, in which ultracapacitors, rather than batteries, are used to\nstore energy. This ultracapacitor-powered drill is a product of continuing efforts to develop the technological discipline known as hybrid power\nmanagement (HPM), which is oriented\ntoward integration of diverse electric\nenergy-generating, energy-storing, and\nenergy-consuming devices in optimal\nconfigurations.\nInstances of HPM were reported in\nseveral prior NASA Tech Briefs articles,\nthough not explicitly labeled as HPM except in the most recent such article,\nwhich was \xe2\x80\x9cHybrid Power Management\xe2\x80\x9d\n(LEW-17520-1), Vol. 29, No. 12 (December 2005), page 35. To recapitulate from\nthat article: The use of ultracapacitors as\nenergy-storage devices lies at the heart\nof HPM. An ultracapacitor is an electrochemical energy-storage device, but unlike in a conventional rechargeable electrochemical cell or battery, chemical\nreactions do not take place during oper-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nation. Instead, energy is stored electrostatically at an electrode/electrolyte interface. The capacitance per unit volume of an ultracapacitor is much\ngreater than that of a conventional capacitor because its electrodes have much\ngreater surface area per unit volume\nand the separation between the electrodes is much smaller.\nHPM offers many advantages over the\nconventional power-management approach in which batteries are used to\nstore energy. To place the present development in context, it is necessary to reiterate these advantages from the cited\nprevious article:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Power-control circuits for ultracapacitors\ncan be simpler than those for batteries\nfor two reasons: (1) Because of the absence of chemical reactions, charge and\ndischarge currents can be greater than\nthose in batteries, limited only by the\nelectrical resistances of conductors; and\n(2) Whereas the charge level of a battery\ndepends on voltage, temperature, age,\nand load condition, the charge level of\nan ultracapacitor, like that of\n\na conventional capacitor, depends only\non voltage.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Whereas a typical battery can be\ncharged and discharged about 300\ntimes, an ultracapacitor can be charged\nand discharged more than a million\ntimes. The longer lifetimes of ultracapacitors contribute to reliability.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The longer lifetimes of ultracapacitors\ngreatly reduce life-of-system costs, including the indirect costs of maintenance and downtime.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The longer lifetimes of ultracapacitors reduce adverse environmental effects, inasmuch as it will probably\nnever be necessary to replace and dispose of ultracapacitors in most applications, whereas batteries must be replaced frequently.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Disposal problems and the associated\ncontributions to life-of-system costs\ncan be reduced because the chemical\nconstituents of ultracapacitors are less\ntoxic and less environmentally harmful than are those of batteries. Indeed, ultracapacitors are somewhat\nrecyclable.\n\n9\n\nThe Power Pack attached to the bottom of the\nhandle of the power drill utilizes ultracapacitors,\nrather than batteries, to store energy.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Excellent low-temperature performance makes ultracapacitors suitable for\nstoring energy in applications at temperatures too low for batteries.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The consistent performance of ultracapacitors over time enables reliable\noperation not possible with batteries.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unlike batteries, ultracapacitors can\nbe safely left completely discharged for\nindefinitely long times.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Whereas the charge-discharge efficiency in conventional power management using rechargeable batteries is\ntypically about 50 percent, the chargedischarge efficiency in HPM typically\nexceeds 90 percent.\nFor the cordless drill, a dedicated\ncharger is used to fully realize the advantages of the ultracapacitors as energy-storage devices. Because of the\nnon-critical nature of charging and dis-\n\ncharging of ultracapacitors, this\ncharger is less complex and less costly\nthan would be a battery charger for the\nsame power drill. More spectacularly,\ntaking advantage of the unique charging characteristics of ultracapacitors,\nthis charger can make the ultracapacitor-powered cordless drill ready for operation in seconds, in contradistinction\nto the several hours needed to recharge\nbatteries.\nThis work was done by Dennis J.

Heretofore, there has been\nno way to determine the amount of use to\nwhich a microprocessor (or a product containing a microprocessor) has been subjected. The proposed timers would count\nall microprocessor clock cycles and could\nonly be read by means of microprocessor\ninstructions but, like odometers and\nHobbs meters, could never be reset to\nzero without physically damaging the chip.\nA timer according to the proposal\ncould be either an external device connected to a microprocessor or embedded within the microprocessor.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nPhotocatalytic/magnetic composite\nparticles have been invented as improved means of exploiting established\nmethods of photocatalysis for removal\nof chemical and biological pollutants\nfrom air and water. The photocatalytic\ncomponents of the composite particles\n\nNanosized Photocatalyst Particle\n\nMagnetic\nSubstrate\n\nare formulated for high levels of photocatalytic activity, while the magnetic\ncomponents make it possible to control\nthe movements of the particles through\nthe application of magnetic fields. The\ncombination of photocatalytic and\nmagnetic properties can be exploited\nin designing improved air- and watertreatment reactors.\nA typical composite particle according\nto the invention (see Figure 1) includes\na magnetic substrate or core particle\nhaving a size of the order of 100 \xce\xbcm, a\nlayer to protect the core against chemical attack, and an outer coat of nanosized photocatalyst particles on the protective layer. In an application in which\nthe protective layer is not needed, it can\n\nbe omitted and the photocatalyst particles coated directly onto the core. Another option is to make the core of a\nnonmagnetic material and to coat it\nwith nano-sized photocatalyst and magnetic particles.\nAs used here, \xe2\x80\x9cnano-sized\xe2\x80\x9d refers to\nsizes in the range from a few nanometers\nto about 100 nanometers. The reason\nfor choosing this size range is simply that\nexperience has shown that nano-sized\nphotocatalyst particles are more photocatalytically active than are micron- and\nlarger-sized photocatalyst particles.\nThe magnetic core (or, optionally, the\nnano-sized magnetic particles) can be\nmade of any of a variety of suitable magnetic materials \xe2\x80\x94 for example, Fe3O4,\n\nExhaust (Purified Air/Water)\n\nNanosized Photocatalyst Particle\n\nUltraviolet\nLamp\n\nPhotocatalytic/Magnetic\nComposite Particles\n\nMagnetic\nSubstrate\n\nProtective Layer\n\nN S\n\nN S\n\nNanosized Photocatalyst Particle\n\nElectromagnet\nCoil\nNonmagnetic\nSubstrate\n\nPolluted\nAir/Water In\n\nNanosized Magnet\n\nFigure 1.

The photocatalyst can be\nTiO2, ZnO, or Fe2O3. Nano-sized photocatalyst particles can be coated onto the\nlarger core particles by various techniques, e.g., a dry coating machine,\nwherein a mixture of the two types of particles is forced to pass through a narrow\nclearance under high stress.\nA representative reactor for treatment\nof air by use of photocatalytic/magnetic\ncomposite particles (see Figure 2) includes a fluidized bed loaded with the\nparticles. An ultraviolet lamp provides\nthe excitatory photons needed for photocatalysis. An electromagnet coil generates\n\n14\n\na magnetic field to control the movement\nof the composite particles.\nIn operation, polluted air or water enters at the bottom and flows upward\nthrough the fluidized bed. The polluted\nfluid agitates, and mixes with, the composite particles in the bed. Additional agitation is provided by an alternating magnetic field generated by supplying\nalternating current to the electromagnet\ncoil. The agitation enhances the fluidization, and is almost entirely responsible for\nfluidization when the flow is not rapid\nenough to fluidize the particles sufficiently. The agitation promotes the exposure of the photocatalyst particles to ultraviolet light from the lamp and increases\nthe rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals, which react with the pollutants. The\n\nexhaust flowing from the top of the reactor consists of purified fluid.\nThis work was done by Chang-Yu Wu, Yogi\nGoswami, Charles Garretson, Jean Andino,\nand David Mazyck of the University of\nFlorida for Johnson Space Center.

The process is denoted \xe2\x80\x9cS3B\xe2\x80\x9d (separation, seaming, and\nsealing using brazing) because sealing of\nthe sample into the hermetic container,\nseparating the container from the dirty\nenvironment, and bringing the container with a clean outer surface into the\nclean environment are all accomplished\nsimultaneously with a brazing operation.\nThis container and process were conceived as a superior alternative to the\ndouble-wall container and process described in \xe2\x80\x9cExplosion Welding for Hermetic Containerization\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-20868),\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 8 (August\n2003), page 46. As in the previously reported case, the present container and\nprocess were originally intended to be\nused to return samples from Mars to\nEarth, but could also be used on Earth\nto store and transport material samples\nacquired in environments that contain\nbiological and/or chemical hazards.\nFigure 1 depicts the configuration,\nprior to the S3B process, of the doublewall container and an interface assembly\nthat includes a structure that holds the\nlid and serves as a barrier between the\nclean and dirty environments. The\nupper end of the container is sized and\nshaped to mate with the lid. For the S3B\nprocess, the outer wall of the double-wall\ncontainer includes, near its upper end,\nintegral portions in the form of three\nrings of a brazing material that melts at\na temperature well below the melting\ntemperature of the rest of the container.\nThere is also a similar ring of brazing\nmaterial on the upper surface of a\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nLid\nClean\nEnvironment\nInterface\nStructure\n\nInduction\nCoil\n\nThrough-the-Thickness\nRings of Brazing Material\nRings of\nBrazing Material\nin\nGrooves\n\nDirty\nEnvironment\n\nThermal-Insulation\nMaterial on Outer\nSurface of Inner Wall\nSample\n\nFigure 1.

Inside the lid and\non the structure that holds the lid are\nsimilar rings of brazing material positioned to mate with those on the doublewall container. The middle ring of brazing material on the cylindrical portion\nof the outer wall occupies the full thickness of the wall; similarly, the mating\nmiddle ring of brazing material in the\ncylindrical portion of the lid occupies\nthe full thickness of that part of the lid.\nOn the clean side, an induction-heating\ncoil surrounds the lid. At the bottom\nend of the double-wall container, between the inner and outer walls, are\nsprings poised to push the inner portion\nof the container lengthwise out of the\nouter portion.\nImmediately before starting the S3B\nprocess, a mechanism pushes the double-wall container into mating with the\n\n16\n\nlid. The S3B process is started by applying power to the induction-heating coil\nto melt the rings of brazing material,\nthereby causing the following events to\noccur simultaneously:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The outer wall of the double-wall container becomes brazed to the interface\nstructure, thereby ensuring maintenance\nof the separation between the clean and\ndirty environments.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The inner wall of the double-wall container becomes brazed to the lid, thereby\ncreating an inner container and hermetically sealing the sample into it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Once the through-the-thickness rings\nof brazing material melt, there is nothing left to hold the inner container to\nthe outer container or to hold the lid\nto the interface structure. Consequently, the springs push the newly\ncreated hermetic container away from\nthe outer container/interface struc-\n\nture, into the clean environment (see\nFigure 2).\nThe brazing material is chosen to have a\nsufficiently high melting temperature\n(typically >500 \xc2\xb0C) so that the brazing\nprocess sterilizes the outer surface of the\nlid/wall seam region of the newly created\nhermetic container. The outer surface of\nthe inner container is covered with a layer\nof thermal-insulation material to prevent\nheat damage of the sample during brazing. Alternatively, in an application in\nwhich there is no concern about biological\ncontamination, it could be feasible to substitute a lower-melting-temperature solder\nfor the brazing material.\nThis work was done by Yoseph Bar-Cohen,\nTommaso P.

NASA Dryden\nFlight Research Center, in cooperation\nwith the Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency (DARPA), the Naval Air\nSystems Command (NAVAIR), the Naval\nAir Force Pacific Fleet, and the Air Force\nResearch Laboratory, rapidly conceived\nand accomplished an AAR flight research project focused on collecting a\nunique, high-quality database on the dynamics of the hose and drogue of an aerial refueling system. This flight-derived\ndatabase would be used to validate mathematical models of the dynamics in support of design and analysis of AAR systems for future UAVs. The project\ninvolved the use of two Dryden F/A-18\nairplanes and an S-3 hose-drogue refueling store on loan from the Navy (see Figure 1). In this year-long project, which\nwas started on October 1, 2002, 583 research maneuvers were completed during 23 flights.\nIn the first phase of the project, the\naerial refueling store (ARS) was instrumented and fully integrated with one of\nthe F/A-18A airplanes \xe2\x80\x94 an integration\nthat had not previously been accomplished. After conducting envelope-expansion flights in December 2002 for\nthis F/A-18A airplane to carry and operate the ARS, the project team focused\non outfitting both F/A-18A airplanes\nwith a pair of video cameras to record\nthe movement of the hose-and-drogue\n\nStabilized Drogue Position\nBelow Tanker\n\nAltitude\n\n150\n\n7,500 ft\n10,000 ft\n25,000 ft\n30,000 ft\n\n170\n\n190\n\n210\n\n230\n\n250\n\n270\n\n290\n\n310\n\nIndicated Airspeed, Knots\n\nFigure 2.

Building on the heritage of technological developments of the Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF) program, the dynamics of the hose and\ndrogue were investigated at altitudes between 7,500 and 30,000 feet (between\n2.3 and 9.1 km), and indicated airspeeds ranging from 195 to 300 knots\n(100 to 154 m/s). The effects of flight\nconditions, the weight of the hose, the\nweight of the tanker (the airplane carrying the ARS), and the approach velocity\nof the receiver (the other airplane, playing the role of an airplane to be refueled) on the response of the hose and\ndrogue were explored in increments. A\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)-based\nrelative-positioning capability developed in the AFF program was used to\nguide the receiver into the proper position behind the tanker. Post-flight processing of the video images yielded data\non the position and velocity of the\nhose/drogue system.\nThe free-stream position of the drogue\n(see Figure 2), the drag upon the drogue,\nand the effects of turbulence upon the\ndrogue were investigated. Also investigated were the damping characteristics of\nthe hose and the area of influence \xe2\x80\x94 the\nregion around the drogue wherein there\nis a discernable effect on the drogue.\nSimilarly to the research of the AFF program, the research of the AAR program included exploration of many avenues, including video tracking and calibration\nmethods, and flight-test and piloting techniques. The unique configuration of the\nairplanes enabled the first-ever in-flight\nthrust measurement of drag on the hose\nand drogue. It also enabled synchronization of the measurement of the hose and\ndrogue position relative to the tanker and\nreceiver with both GPS measurements and\ndata acquired aboard both airplanes.

Like prior commercial noninvasive eye-tracking systems, this\nsystem is based on (1) illumination of an\neye by a low-power infrared light-emitting\ndiode (LED); (2) acquisition of video images of the pupil, iris, and cornea in the reflected infrared light; (3) digitization of the\nimages; and (4) processing the digital\nimage data to determine the direction of\ngaze from the centroids of the pupil and\ncornea in the images. Relative to the prior\ncommercial systems, the present system operates at much higher speed and thereby\noffers enhanced capability for applications\nthat involve human-computer interactions,\nincluding typing and computer command\nand control by handicapped individuals,\n\nPan, Tilt,\nAutomatic\nFocus\n\nControl\n\nCCD\n\nImage\nProcessing\n\nand eye-based diagnosis of physiological\ndisorders that affect gaze responses.\nMost of the prior commercial noninvasive eye-tracking systems rely on standard video cameras, which operate at\nframe rates of about 30 Hz. In a typical\nsystem, the video-data stream is\nprocessed either in the central processing unit of a host computer or in a digital signal processor on a frame-grabber\nboard. Such a system is limited to slow,\nfull-frame operation in which the burden of processing the full-frame image\ndata is placed on the host computer.\nIn the present system, most control\nfunctions and processing of image data\nare performed by firmware on an onboard field-programmable gate array\n(FPGA).

It is\nenvisioned that with further development, the architecture of this system\ncould progress to that of an affordable,\nportable, stand-alone computer-peripheral unit similar to an optical mouse.\nAnother important aspect of the design\nis an advanced control scheme for a\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) image detector. The scheme provides for readout\nfrom a small region of interest (ROI), or\nsubwindow, of the full image. Because the\nROI contains significantly far fewer pixels\nthan does the full image, one can achieve\na high frame rate by reading out the ROI\n(but not the rest of the image) repeatedly.\nInasmuch as the image features of interest\n(the cornea and pupil) typically occupy a\nsmall part of the camera frame, this ROI\ncapability enables determination of the\ndirection of gaze at a high rate. At present, commercial CCD cameras are not\nwell suited to implementation of this\nscheme, and a custom camera is used instead. This camera, which has an active\nimage area of 658 by 496 pixels, is capable\nof readout from an 8-by-8-pixel ROI at a\nrate of 6 kHz.\nThis work was done by Ashit Talukder,\nClayton La Baw, John Michael-Morookian,\nSteve Monacos, and Orin Serviss of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

When air temperature exceeds 600 \xc2\xb0F (316 \xc2\xb0C) or in\nthe presence of radiative heating from\nnearby sources at temperatures of 1,200\n\xc2\xb0F (649 \xc2\xb0C) or more, outer suits now\nused by firefighters afford protection for\nonly a few seconds. The proposed suits\nwould exploit the high latent heat of vaporization of water to satisfy a need to\nprotect against higher air temperatures\nand against radiant heating for significantly longer times. These suits would be\nfabricated and operated in conjunction\nwith breathing and cooling systems like\nthose with which firefighting suits are\nnow equipped.\nA protective suit according to the proposal would include a water-storage and distribution system that would cause the\nsuit to \xe2\x80\x9csweat\xe2\x80\x9d all over as needed. The\nquantity of water carried (typically a few\nliters) could be selected according to the\nexpected task. If the water were carried in\na slightly pressurized tank, there would\nbe no need for a pump. The water-distribution system would include bimetallicactuated valves that would regulate rates\nof flow according to the local temperatures in the suit. For example, it has been\nestimated that releasing water at a rate of\n1 milliliter per second would be sufficient\nto prevent the surface temperature of the\nsuit from exceeding 140 \xc2\xb0F (60 \xc2\xb0C) at an\nair temperature of 1,000 \xc2\xb0F (538 \xc2\xb0C), and\na 2-liter supply of water would be more\n\nLow-Mass-Density,\nFlexible, High-Temperature\nPermeable Insulator\n\nWater\nFeed\n\nOverlapping\nReflectors\n\nHotter\n(Outer)\nSide\n\nCooler\n(Inner)\nSide\n\nWater Drops\nOozing Into\nInsulator\nImpermeable\nBack Side of\nWater-Feed Layer\n\nLow-Mass-Density,\nFlexible,\nInternal Insulator\n\nShinglelike Outer Reflectors would protect\nagainst radiative heating. Evaporation of water\nfrom the inner surface of a permeable insulating\nlayer would keep the interior temperature much\nlower than the ambient air temperature.\n\nthan enough to provide this protection\nfor half an hour. The adjustability of flow\nrates would also make it possible to protect against radiative heating for times\nlonger than were previously possible.\nFor even better protection against\nboth conductive and radiative heating, a\nsuit according to the present proposal\ncould include both a highly reflective\nouter layer as well as an evaporative-cooling sublayer system. Whereas the outer\nlayers of some protective suits now in use\nhave reflectivities of about 0.90, the proposal calls for a reflectivity of about 0.97.\nIn one version, shown in the figure, the\nouter layer would consist of overlapping\nshinglelike reflectors (see figure), possibly made of thin copper plates coated\nwith gold. The shingles would be individually attached to the suit so that they\ncould slide over each other and motion\nwould not be restricted. The water\nwould be injected into, and would evaporate from the inner surface of a thick,\npermeable insulating layer, which is\nshielded by the reflective shingles. The\nshingles would be allowed to get very\nhot, but the wet sub-layer would remain\nmuch cooler, and water would be used\nup at a lower rate than would be the case\nif no reflective shingles were used and\nwater were allowed to evaporate directly\nfrom a hot outer surface.\nThis work was done by Leonard Murray Weinstein of Langley Research Center.

The interface between a dielectric and a metal can support a surface\nelectromagnetic wave if the permittivity\nof the metal, expressed as a complex\nnumber, has a negative real component.\nThe distribution of amplitude in a plasmon peaks at the metal/dielectric interface and decays exponentially with distance from the interface into the metal\nor the dielectric.\nIn cases relevant to the proposal, the\npolarization states of the electric field\nare elliptical, characterized by major\naxes parallel to the interface on the\nmetal side and perpendicular to the interface in the dielectric side. The contribution of the surface-plasmon effect to\nperpendicular polarization would be\n\naugmented by the contribution of\nstrong perpendicular-polarization components of the near field of the antenna.\nPresumably, designs could also be optimized to obtain resonant or broadband\nantenna structures to maximize coupling of light from free space into perpendicularly polarized plasmon modes.\nThis work was done by John Hong of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517, the\ncontractor has elected to retain title to this invention.

Potential uses for electronic\ntongues include monitoring the chemical quality of water in a variety of natural, industrial, and laboratory settings,\nand detecting micro-organisms indirectly by measuring microbially influenced corrosion.\nE-tongue 2 includes a heater, a temperature sensor, an oxidation/reduction\n(redox) sensor pair, an electrical sensor,\nan array of eight galvanic cells, and eight\nion-specific electrodes. These devices are\nformed in a substantially planar configuration on an alumina substrate 1 mm\nthick and 1.3 in. (3.3 cm) in diameter (see\nFigure 1). The fabrication process includes screen printing of the components\nof the aforementioned devices on the\nfront side of the substrate, laser drilling of\nvia holes for electrical contacts with wires\n\n22\n\nTemperature\nSensor\n\nArray of Ion-Specific Electrodes\n\nOxidation/Reduction\n(Redox) Sensor Pair\n\n3.3 cm\nHeater\n\nElectricalConductivity\nSensor\nArray of\nGalvanic\nCells\n\nFigure 1.

The use of this common conductor helps to minimize the number of\nwires and pins and facilitates miniaturization of the array. The common conductor also serves as a ground plane that\nsuppresses electric-field interference\namong the cells in the array.\nThe planarity of the array facilitates\ncleaning of the array by a number of\ntechniques, including wiping, exposure\nto ultraviolet light, and electrolytic generation of hydrogen and oxygen. The\nplanar configuration also facilitates the\nreservation of some cells and sensors as\nspares. The cleaning and sparing are intended to enable extension of the life of\nthe E-tongue. Yet other advantages of\nthe planar configuration are that it facilitates incorporation of the E-tongue into\na flow-through cell and is amenable to\nmicroscopic observations.\nThe progression from E-tongue 1 to\nE-tongue 2 has involved improvements\nin design, operation, interpretation of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nCounter\nElectrode\nWorking\nElectrode\n\nReference\nElectrode\nFigure 2.

There has been particular emphasis\non the redox sensors, which are based\non a traditional electrochemical cell\nused for making pH and other ioniccontent measurements. Such a cell includes a working electrode, a reference\nelectrode, and a counter electrode.\nHowever, whereas the electrodes in a\ntraditional cell have a pencillike configuration, the electrodes in each redox\nsensor of the E-tongue are planar and\nconcentric (see Figure 2) and their\ncounter electrodes are integral parts of\nthe ground plane.\n\nExcitation and readout circuitry has\nbeen designed and constructed specifically for use in operating the E-tongue.\nIn operation, the currents flowing to\nand from the electrodes of the electrochemical cells and an adjacent electricalconductivity sensor on the E-tongue are\nmeasured as the voltages applied to the\nelectrodes are scanned through appropriate ranges, called detection windows.\nThe measurement data are then\nprocessed and interpreted to detect and\nquantitate ions in solution. The detection windows are bounded by electrolytic generation of hydrogen at negative potentials and oxygen at positive\npotentials.

Heat stress, which is\nthe net heat load a worker may be exposed to, is officially measured using a\nthermal-environment monitoring system\nto calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). This instrument uses three\nindependent thermometers to measure\nwet-bulb, dry-bulb, and the black-globe\ntemperatures. Two reasons for this project\nwere limited access to the Dryden monitoring system and delays of the required\nmanual issuances for heat-stress warnings.\nExisting algorithms to estimate the\nWBGT are less applicable in dissimilar\nenvironments. The American College of\nSports Medicine (ACSM) was the algorithm selected after being used extensively and successfully during the 2000\nSummer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.\nThe ACSM algorithm only uses dry ambient temperature and vapor pressure to\nestimate the WBGT and it assumes moderate solar radiation and low wind\nspeeds. However, when applied to extreme environments such as the Southwest desert region, this algorithm produces less than acceptable WBGT values.\nThis situation increases the likelihood of\noverlooking unsafe conditions for employees working outdoors.\nDryden provided corrections to the environmental assumptions of moderate\nsolar radiation and low wind built into\nthe algorithm. Desert environments,\nsuch as the high Mojave in Southern California, have both high solar radiation\n(1,000 W/m2) and periods of significant\nwinds during the summer afternoons in\nexcess of 20 kn. When comparing the difference between the thermal environment monitor WBGT (actual) and the\nACSM approximated WBGT against wind\nspeed, it was found that a direct relationship existed with a positive slope (i.e., a\nlarge difference between the actual and\nestimated WBGT as the wind speed increases).

The daily\ndifference between actual and calculated\nWBGT was reduced from approximately\n2.0\xc2\xb0 to about 0.5\xc2\xb0 on the average.\nNext, the moderate solar radiation assumption had to be addressed and was\ncorrected by a similar process as that for\nthe wind. Since at noon the solar radiation\nwas the highest, the adjustments began\nthere. The approximation algorithm produced reasonable values during the hours\nwhen the Sun was at its peak, but there\nwere large overestimates in the morning\nand at night. To correct this, the differences between the actual and estimated\nWBGT were compared to solar radiation\nmeasurements. The results from this were\nagain used to create another correction\ncurve. The difference between actual and\ncalculated WBGT was reduced from approximately 2.0\xc2\xb0 to about 1.5\xc2\xb0 on the average. Combining the two curves improved\nthe estimation significantly better than\n0.5\xc2\xb0 on the average for the 40 days.\nBy using these improvements, a more\nrealistic WBGT estimation value can\nnow be produced. A variety of advan-\n\ntages come as a result of this. One of the\nmost useful advantages is that a Webbased system can now be developed to\nautomate and archive these calculations\nat a high update rate so that data are\navailable everywhere for everyone. This\nWeb automation system, in turn, will\nsave meteorologists and safety personnel\na considerable amount of time because\nthey will no longer have to periodically\nrecord and archive WBGT measurements throughout the workday. Not\nonly will the new algorithm help free up\npersonnel but it will also make the thermal environment monitoring systems\navailable to obtain site-specific WBGT\ndata. This is extremely useful for researchers and other employees who are\nworking on outdoor projects that are\ndistant from the areas that the Web system monitors. Most importantly, the improved WBGT estimations will make outdoor work sites safer by reducing the\nlikelihood of heat stress.\nThis work was done by Edward H Teets, Jr.,\nof Dryden Flight Research Center and Steven\nFrehn of Highland High School (Palmdale,\nCA).

DRC-05-01\n\n25\n\nA Method of Partly Automated Testing of Software\nPrinciples of symbolic execution and temporal monitoring are exploited.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nA method of automated testing of software has been developed that provides\nan alternative to the conventional mostly\nmanual approach for software testing.\nThe method combines (1) automated\ngeneration of test cases on the basis of\nsystematic exploration of the input domain of the software to be tested with\n(2) run-time analysis in which execution\ntraces are monitored, verified against\ntemporal-logic specifications, and analyzed by concurrency-error-detection algorithms. In this new method, the user\nonly needs to provide the temporal logic\nspecifications against which the software\nwill be tested and the abstract description of the input domain.\nFor testing a given computer program,\nthe method involves the software analog\nof a hardware test harness, consisting of\nfour software modules: a test-input-generator module, a property-generator module, a program-instrumentation module,\nand an observer module (see figure).\nThe test-input-generator module automatically generates inputs to the program under test, one at a time, on the\nbasis of a previously developed symbolicexecution approach. In this approach,\nsymbolic values (instead of data) are used\nto represent program values and the state\nof a symbolically executed program is\nrepresented by a combination of (1) the\nsymbolic values, (2) a program counter,\nand (3) a path condition in the form of a\nBoolean formula over the symbolic inputs that accumulate constraints that the\ninputs must satisfy in order to make execution follow a particular associated path.\n\n26\n\nProperty-Generator\nModule\n\nTest-InputGenerator\nModule\n\nProgram Under Test\n\nObserver\nModule\n\nInstrumentation\nModule\nFour Software Modules are used together to determine (1) what properties the program under test\nshould have and (2) whether it does, indeed, have those properties.\n\nAn input generated by the test-inputgenerator module is fed to the propertygenerator module, which automatically\ngenerates a set of properties that the\nprogram under test is required to exhibit when executed in response to the\ngiven input. The input is then fed to the\nprogram under test. The program is\nthen executed and generates an execution trace.\nThe instrumentation and observer\nmodules perform the aforementioned\nrun-time analysis. The instrumentation\nmodule must be constructed to report\nevents that are relevant for determining\nwhether the program exhibits the required properties during a particular execution. The observer accepts, as input,\nthe execution trace and the set of properties generated by the property-generator\nmodule to determine whether the program exhibits the required properties.\n\nThe test-input-generator and property-generator modules must be constructed specifically for the program\nunder test. It may be possible to automate the construction of the instrumentation module, depending on the nature\nof the program under test. The observer\nmodule is generic and can be re-used for\ntesting other programs.\nThis work was done by Mike Lowry,\nWillem Visser, and Rich Washington of Ames\nResearch Center; Cyrille Artho of Computer\nSystems Institute; Allen Goldberg, Klaus\nHavelund, and Corina Pasareanu of Kestrel\nTechnology; Sarfraz Khurshid of Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Grigore\nRo\xef\xac\x82u of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto the Ames Technology Partnerships Division\nat (650) 604-2954.

The robot\nin question, now undergoing conceptual\ndevelopment for use on the Moon, is the\nAll-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial\nExplorer (ATHLETE) rover, which is designed to roll over gentle terrain or walk\nover rough or steep terrain. Each leg of the\nrobot is a six-degree-of-freedom generalpurpose manipulator tipped by a wheel\nwith a motor drive. The tool interface includes a square cross-section peg, equivalent to a conventional socket-wrench drive,\nthat rotates with the wheel. The tool interface also includes a clamp that holds a tool\non the peg, and a pair of fold-out cameras\nthat provides close-up stereoscopic images\nof the tool and its vicinity. The field of view\nof the imagers is actuated by the clamp\nmechanism and is specific to each tool.\nThe motor drive can power any of a variety\nof tools, including rotating tools for helical\nfasteners, drills, and such clamping tools as\npliers. With the addition of a flexible coupling, it could also power another tool or\nremote manipulator at a short distance.\nThe socket drive can provide very high\ntorque and power because it is driven by\nthe wheel motor.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nThis work was done by Jaret Matthews,\nNorman Ahmad, and Brian Wilcox of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nNPO-43308\n\nSecond-Generation\nElectronic Nose\nA report discusses the second generation of the JPL Electronic Nose (ENose),\nan array of 32 semi-specific chemical sensors used as an event monitor to identify\nand quantify contaminants released into\nbreathing air by leaks or spills.

This system has improved reproducibility for making matched arrays, allowing use of data\nanalysis software with minimal recalibration on sensor set replacement. The Second Generation (SG) ENose is a follow-up\nto the first JPL Electronic Nose that was\ntested on an earlier space shuttle mission\n(STS-95). Improvements have been made\nto the hardware, sensor materials, and\ndata analysis software.\nThe SG ENose can be adapted to different applications and analyte sets by\n\nselection of sensor sets. A monolithic\nchassis eliminates most fittings, tubing,\nand dead space, improving the flow system. The SG ENose also includes humidity and temperature sensors in the\nsensing chamber for improved event\ndeconvolution.
