Images are stored as patterns of electron beam induced optical density in the cathodo-chromic material. The stored information is recovered by exciting the backing, fast phosphor layer with a constant current electron beam and detecting the emitted radiation which is modulated by absorption in the cathodochromic layer. The storage can be accomplished in one or more TV frames (1/30 sec each). More than 500 TV line resolution and close to 2:1 contrast ratio are possible. The information storage time in a dark environment is approximately 24 hours. A reconstituted (readout) electronic video signal can be generated continuously for times in excess of 10 minutes or periodically for several hours.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740009042, "id": "1d55486dcbad41a49b81f7a792369483", "publicationDate": "1969-04-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740009042.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740009042/downloads/19740009042.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740009042/downloads/19740009042.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740009042/downloads/19740009042.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
