b'COMMERCIAL\nEARTH OBSERVATION\n\nA\n\nclose relative of the\nNASA VIP program\n(see page 88) is the\ngovernmentfindustry cooperative program known as\nEOCAP (Earth Observation\nCommercial Applications\nProgram). Designed to help\nprivate industry develop and\ncommercialize applications\n\nii\n\nL\nB\n\nENVIRONMENT\nAND RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT\n\nof remote sensing, EOCAP is\nan effort to encourage\nprivate investment in, and\nbroader use of, NASA technology for gathering and\nanalyzing information about\nEarth\'s land and ocean\nresources.\nLike VIP, EOCm is managed by Stennis Space Center, but the programs differ.\nVIP generally involves shortterm projects of three to six\nwith NASA providing\nthe funding; EOCAP projects\ncan run three years Or more\nand funding is shared by\nNASA and the private sector\nparticipant.\nAn EOCAP example is the\ndevelopment of a new tool for\nanalyzing remotely sensed\ndata, a process that provides\na subpixel detection capability for increased accuracy and\nsignificantly enhanced discrimination among surface\nfeatures in imagery.\nKnown as the Applied\nAnalysis Spectral Analytical\nProcess, or AASAP, the program was developed by\n\nApplied Analysis, Inc. (AAI),\nBellerica, Massachusetts.\nAt left are AAI president\nDonald B. Damm, (seated)\nand the company\'s chief scientist, Dr. Robert L. Huguenin,\nwho developed M A P .\nAs the term implies, subpixel processing detects or\nclassifies objects that are\nthan the size of a\npixel. In most remote sensing\napplications, image pixels are\n"mixed pixels," meaning that\nthey contain not only the unit\nof interest but also "background7\'features that distort\nthe spectral properties of the\nunit of interest, resulting in a\nloss of discrimination and\npotential misclassification.\nAASAP enhances the classification process by removing\nthe background. To do so, the\nsoftware must identify the\nbackground matter in each\npixel, then remove exactly the\nright amount of it. The residual spectrum (what\'s left after\nbackground removal) is a relatively pure representation of\nthe unit of interest. At top\nright is a comparison\n\nbetween normal satellite\nimagery (at left) and a subpixel processed image; the yellowired area in the right\nimage represents the additional information obtained\nby subpixel processing.\nAccording to its develop\ners, AASAP is achieving accuracies of about 90 percent. It\nis now being offered as a\nmodular addition to the\nERDAS IMAGINE software\npackage marketed by ERDAS,\nInc., Atlanta, Georgia for\nremote sensing applications.\nAnother EOCAP example\ninvolves the development of\n\nthe SeaStation ocean information systems by Ocean\nand Coastal Environmental\nSensing (OCENS), Seattle,\nWashington. Through an\nEOCAP partnership, OCENS\ndeveloped SeaStation, a lowcost, portable, shipboard\nsatellite groundstation integrated with vessel catch and\nproduct monitoring software.\nSeaStation targets marine\nusers in the commercial and\nrecreational fishing markets,\nalong with recreational\nboaters. It provides a Windows-based graphical interface that permits the user to\n\nacquire and process environmental data originating with\nsatellitebased sensors. Acquisition and processing software is linked to the Global\nPositioning System data\nstream to provide real time\nrelationships between vessel\nposition and such data as sea\nsurface temperature, weather\nconditions and ice edge location. This allows the user to\nincrease fishing productivity\nand improve vessel safety.\nA left, OCENS president\nt\nMark H. Freeberg and a client,\nan officer (red clothes) of a\ncommercial fishing vessel,\ncheck the output of the SeaStation system.
