The dispersion analysis is based on the nominal trajectory for the OFT-1 reference flight profile and was performed to determine state vector and performance dispersions (or variations) which result from the indicated 3 sigma uncertainties. The dispersions are determined at major mission events and fixed times from liftoff (time slices). Principal error contributors to the covariance matrix are listed. The dispersion data indicates that the largest position error occurs in the down range component. At main engine cutoff and circularization, the vehicle performance uncertainties are the major contributors to down range error.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770019230, "id": "ead9dc8a028245529d5653184ef7427e", "publicationDate": "1977-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770019230.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770019230/downloads/19770019230.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770019230/downloads/19770019230.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770019230/downloads/19770019230.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
