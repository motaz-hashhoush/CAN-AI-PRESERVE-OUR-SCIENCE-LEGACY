b'Whole Module Offgas Test Report:\nSpace-X Dragon Module\nBetween 7 April and 11 April 2012 a chemist from the JSC Toxicology Group\nacquired samples of air in 500 ml evacuated canisters from the sealed Dragon Module at the Space-X\nfacility at KSC. Three samples were taken of facility air (two before the test and one after the test), and a\ntotal of 9 samples were taken from the sealed module in triplicate at the following times: 0 hours, 48\nhours, and 96 hours. The module contained 470 kg, which was 100% of the mass to be launched.\nAnalytical data contained in the Toxicology Group Report (attached) show that the ambient\nfacility air was clean except for almost 9 mg/m 3 of isopropanol (IPA) in the sample taken at the end of the\ntest. Space-X must ensure that IP A is not introduced into the module before it is sealed for launch. Other\nminor contaminants in the ambient air included the following: perfluoro(2-methyl)pentane and\nhexamethylcyclotrisiloxane. The first-acquired samples of each triplicate from the module were not\nanalyzed. Analyses of pairs of samples that were taken during the test show excellent agreement between\nthe pairs and a linear increase in the T-values during the 4 days of the test (figure below).\nT Values\n\nI\n\n-\n\nJ\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,.. ~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nFigure shows total T\nvalues\n\n~\n\nfor\n\nsecond\n\nsamples (diamonds)\nand\n\nthird\n\nsamples\n\n(squares) at 0, 48\nand 96 hours.

If the time from last purge of the module on\nthe ground to crew first entry on orbit is 10 days, then the T value at first entry should be less than 1.2\nunits, which is well below the criterion of 3.0 for consideration of additional protection of the crew from\noffgas products. The primary contributors were as follows: trimethylsilanol (0.057), fluorotrimethylsilane\n(0.047), acetaldehyde (0.004), hexamethylcyclopentasiloxane (0.003), and toluene (0.002).\n\n19 April 2012\nNASA Chief Toxicologist\n\n'
