These characteristics were then evaluated\nin conjunction with typical CTOL transport aircraft characteristics to determine\nthe economic impact of engines designed with high or low: speed fans and with varying\namounts of noise suppression in terms of the effect on direct operating cost.\nUsing the acoustic technology from the Quiet Engine Program in these\npreliminary flight engine,.designs and the acoustically treated nacelles defined\nin this study in a typical CTOL tri-jet transport resuits in projected noise\nlevels well below FAR 36 requirements.

Considering both noise and DOC effects, at\nfull power takeoff noise levels between FAR 36 and FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdB, with a\ntypical tri-jet transport, a high speed engine in a treated wall nacelle appears\nto be the most economically\' attractive. The high speed engine yields a greater\nnoise reduction for similar noise reduction features. For significant noise\nreductions below about FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdB, the cost increases for both low and\nhigh speed engines. For noise levels below approximately FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdB to\nFAR 36 minus 7 EPNdB, the lower source noise of the low speed engine begins to\ndominate, and on a DOC basis appears more economically attractive. Technology\ndeveloped since the conduct of the preliminary flight engine design study documented\nin this report indicates that the range of economic attractiveness of high speed\nfan engines may extend to lower noise levels.\n\n2\n\n2.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the phases of the Quiet Engine Program is the assessment of the\neconomic impact of utilizing the technology developed in the above effort in\na modern flight-type engine on CTOL-type aircraft. The elements of this study\ninclude:\n1.\n\nA preliminary flight engine design incorporating the basic\nfeatures of the QEP fans developed above with a modern core matched to the engine thrust requirement of 22,000 lb (97,900 N)\nSLS. The study is to include both a low tip speed (Fan A\nderivative) and high tip speed (Fan C derivative) engine.\n\n2.\n\nFor each engine, identify the basic characteristics including\nsize, weight, cost, noise, and performance in a reference\nuntreated (i.e. hardwall) nacelle.\n\n3.\n\nEstablish the installed characteristics in a nacelle with\nvarying degrees of noise suppression evaluating the effect\non performance, weight, cost, and noise.\n\n4.\n\nEvaluate the impact of the various suppressed engine comfigurations on the aircraft economics of new tri-jet aircraft.\n\n5.\n\nEvaluate the impact of the various suppressed engine configurations\non the economics of a DC-8-type aircraft (Appendix C).\n\n6.\n\nCompare the effect of noise suppression (AEPNdB) on high and low\nspeed fan engines on the aircraft operating costs (ADOC) for each\nengine.\n\nThis report describes the work performed in carrying out elements 1 to 5\nto obtain the DOC/EBNdB Trade Study.\nThe NASA/GE Experimental Quiet Engine Program which served as the basis\nfor the DOC Trade Study was directed toward the overall objective of achieving\na noise reduction equivalent to 15-20 EPNdB relative to the large jet aircraft\nthen in service (e.g. 707, DC-8 aircraft). The major elements incorporated in\nthe program to obtain this overall system reduction were:\n1.\n\nUse of a high bypass ratio engine to reduce jet noise.\n\n2.\n\nDevelopment of fan components which minimized the fan source\nnoise concurrent with good aero performance.\n\n3.\n\nInstallation of the basic engine in nacelles utilizing acoustic\nmaterials to reduce the amount of internal noise radiated to\nthe farfield.\n\n3\n\nThe desired jet\nnoise reduction is achieved.by use of engines with bypass\nratios\nof about 6. The associated fan pressure ratios of 1.5 to 1.6 and the\nresultant\njet\nvelocities then generate significantly less noise than other\nmajor engine noise sources such as the fan.\nTo address the problem of fan source noise reduction, the Quiet Engine\nProgram included the design and development of three full-size fan components.\nFeatures incorporated in these fans to reduce source noise included:\n1.\n\nTwo rotor chord spacing between the fan rotor trailing edge\nand the stator (or OGV) leading edge.\n\n2.\n\nA stator vane to rotor blade ratio of slightly over 2.\n\n3.\n\nAcoustically treated panels in the engine frame and casings.\n\nThe primary program elements are illustrated\nin Figure 1. Two low speed\nfans [UT = 1160 ft/sec (354 m/sec) at alt cruise] and one high speed fan\n[UT = 1550 ft/sec (473 m/sec) at alt cruise] were designed and fabricated.\nThese two configurations were chosen to evaluate the impact on an engine system\nof high (low tip speed) and low (high tip speed) aerodynamic loading fans when\nsignificant noise reduction is required.\nComplete aerodynamic and aeromechanical\nperformance including tolerance to inflow distortions was established by aero\ncomponent tests at the General Electric Full-Scale Fan Test Facility at\nLynn,\nMassachusetts. Acoustic performance was obtained by testing each fan component in the Fan Noise Test Facility at the NASA Lewis Research Center. For\neach fan, the acoustic performance included the baseline fan (i.e. with hardwall inlet and discharge ducts), with various combinations of acoustic treatment\nin the duct walls and with acoustically treated splitters\nboth in the fan inlet\nand fan exhaust ducts.\nThe aero performance of these fans are described in\nReference 1, 2, and 3.\nEngine tests were carried out using the 40-bladed, tip-shrouded Fan A\nfor the low speed fan (since its efficiency and acoustic characteristics were\nslightly better than the low speed 26-blade Fan B) and using the high speed\nfan (Fan C).\nThe proven CF6 core was used (operated at a derated rpm and\nturbine inlet temperature) with each fan. For the low speed fan engine, the\nfan was driven by a four-stage low pressure turbine derived directly from the\nCF6 fan turbine by removing the CF6 fifth\nstage.\nThe high speed Fan C engine\nused a new, more highly loaded two-stage, low pressure turbine. Both engines\nwere tested for performance and noise levels over the full\nthrust range from\napproach power settings to the takeoff power of 22,000 ib (97,900 N).\nEngine acoustic tests were carried out for the basic engine (i.e. hardwall\ninlet and exhaust ducts) as well as for a number of acoustically treated configurations using acoustic panels in the duct surfaces and treated splitters\nin the inlet and exhaust. Acoustic treatment in the core nozzle for turbine\nnoise suppression was also evaluated in each engine.\nThe overall objective of 15-20 EPNdB reduction was achieved if the\nobserved static noise characteristics of the suppressed engine are utilized in\na flyover noise prediction accounting for the aircraft position, altitude, and\n\n4\n\nACOUSTIC/PERFORMANCE TESTING\na INLET TYPES\n* FAN INLET/EXHAUST TREATMENT\n* CORE TREATMENT\n\nFAN A - TIP SHROUDED\n1160 ft/sec UT\n1.5 P/P\n.465 R/R\n\nFAN A ENGINE\n\nNASA ENGINE\nACOUSTIC TESTING\n\n.\nFAN B - UNSHROUDED\n\nLYNN COMPONENT TEST\nAERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\n\nNASA-LEWIS\nACOUSTIC TESTING\n\n1160 ft/sec UT\n1.5 P/P\n\n.465 R/R\n\nFAN C ENGINE\n\nFAN C - UNSHROUDED\n1550 ft/sec UT\n1.5 P/P\n.36 R/R\n\nFigure 1.\n\nNASA-GE Quiet Engine Program Elements.\n\nvelocity.\nThe technological feasibility of the Quiet Engine Program was\ndemonstrated. The noise levels of the Quiet Engines are representative of a\nnew engine design; however, these engines are not flight weight. The Quiet\nEngines are heavier than flight weight engines primarily because they used an\nexisting core engine to reduce program costs.\n(This same core in the CF6\nengine produces twice the thrust of the Quiet Engine.)\n\n6\n\n3.0\n3.1\n\nLOW SPEED ENGINE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nBASIC ENGINE\n\nThe low speed engine, representing current levels of technology, was\nderived from the Quiet Engine Program Fan:A, adapted to a modern core and sized\nfor a SLS takeoff thrust of 22,000 lb (97,900 N) with nominal installation losses.\nThe primary cycle characteristics are tabulated in Table III. An engine cycle\nrepresentative of CTOL applications, has been selected to provide for a mixed\ncore and fan stream ahead of the nozzle. The jet velocity shown in Table III\nrepresents the velocity after mixing. Inlet recoveries, duct losses, mixing\nlosses, and nozzle thrust coefficients used in the cycle are shown in Table IV.\nThe engine flowpath configuration is shown in Figure 2. A short tabulation of\nthe major component characteristics is contained in Table V.\nThe low speed engine fan applies the measured performance characteristics\nof Fan A in the bypass flow.\nThe cycle pressure ratio was set so as to assure\na clean stall margin of 17% which was considered appropriate to provide stallfree operation in the most severe operational environment anticipated for\nthis engine. The fan radius ratio was reduced from the Fan A value of 0.465\nto 0.4 in the low speed engine. Booster stages were used to provide the desired\ncore supercharging pressure ratio of 2.5. Five booster stages were selected\nto meet the requirement of boost pressure ratio plus an adequate stall margin,\nand this selection was based on aerodynamic loadings consistent with the CF6-50\nengine booster stages.\nThe five-stage, low pressure turbine was selected to provide a moderately\nhighly loaded turbine consistent with the design efficiency objective.\nThe overall nominal (hardwall) engine takeoff performance is shown in\nFigure 3 and altitude cruise performance is shown in Figure 4.\n3.2\n\nNACELLE CONFIGURATIONS\n\nOverall arrangement: The engine is installed in a long duct nacelle\nillustrated in Figure 5. The major features are:\n1.\n\nMixed core and fan flows.\nThis arrangement provides a\nthermodynamic advantage with an improved SFC and mixes\nout the higher velocity core jet to reduce the exhaust\njet noise.\n\n2.\n\nFan thrust reverser upstream of the mixing plane. Actuation\nof the fan thrust reverser (closing off the duct upstream\nof the mixing plane) effectively provides a large increase\nin the core nozzle area, resulting in a spoiling of core\nthrust and eliminating need for a separate core thrust\nreverser.\n\n7\n\nTable III.\n\nQEP Trade Study, Low Speed Fan Cycle.\n\nM = 0, SL\nT/O\n860 F (300 C) Day\nThrust - lb (N)\nWA/6 -\n\nb/sec (kg/sec)\n\nFan Pressure Ratio\nBypass Ratio\nTurbine Rotor (Cycle) Temperature, O F (0 C)\nCore Supercharging Pressure Ratio\n\n22,000 (97,900)\n830 (377)\n\nM = 0.85, 35K\nMax Cruise\nStd. + 100 C Day\n4950 (22,000)\n933 (424)\n\n1.43\n\n1.49\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\n2330 (1277)\n2.2\n\n2140 (1172)\n2.5\n\nCore Corrected Flow - lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n56 (25.4)\n\n58 (26.4)\n\nOverall Pressure Ratio\n\n24\n\n28\n\nJet Velocity - ft/sec (m/sec)\n\n900 (274)\n\n---\n\nTable IV.\n\nNominal Installation Allowances, Low Speed Engine.\n\nM = 0, SL\nT/O\n860 F (300 C) Day\n\nM = 0.85, 35K\nMax Cruise\nStd. + 100 C Day\n\nInlet Recovery, P/Po\n\n0.9982\n\n0.9974\n\nDuct Loss, AP/P % (includes mixer\nfriction loss)\n\n1.08\n\n1.34\n\nMixing Loss, AP/P %\n\n0.34\n\n0.96\n\nNozzle Thrust Coefficient, Cv\n\n0.996\n\n0.996\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY OF THE\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\n\nFigure 2.\n\nEngine with Low Speed Fan.\n\nTable V.\n\nQEP Trade Study,\n\nDesign Summary - Low Speed Fan.\n\nFan Aero (Cruise)\nDiameter, inches (meters)\n\n68.7 (1.74)\n\nCorrected Flow, lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n933 (424)\n\nPressure Ratio\n\n1.49\n\nCorrected Tip Speed, Cruise/Takeoff, ft/sec (N/sec)\nCorrected Flow/Annulus Area,\n\nIb/sec-ft 2\n\n(kg/sec-m2\n\n)\n\n1160/1060 (354/323)\n42.3 (207)\n\nFan Blade\nMaterial\n\nSolid.TI\n\nShroud Location\nTip Chord,\n\ninches\n\nTip\n(meters)\n\nBlade - Vane Spacing\n\n7.8 (0.20)\n2 Chords\n\nNB\n\n40\n\nBypass OGV\nNV\n\n90\n\nBooster\nCore Supercharging Pressure Ratio\nNumber of Booster Stages\nBooster Corrected Flow,\n\n2.5\n5\n\nlb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n124 (56.4)\n\nLow Pressure Turbine\nNumber of Stages\n\n5\n\nAverage Pitch Line Loading\nLast Stage Tip Diameter, inches (meters)\n\n1.20\n44 (1.12)\n\nCore Design\nCore Corrected Flow,\n\nlb/sec (kg/sec)\n\nNumber of Compressor Stages\nCore Compressor Ratio\nNumber of Turbine Stages\n\n58 (26.4)\n9\n12\n1\n\nii\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY OF THE\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\n\n21\n\n5 .0\n\n20\n\nFN, N\n0.78\n\n22,240\n\n18,670\n\n13,340\n\n19\n\n0.77\n80 .0\n\n18\n\n0.76\n\n17\n\n71.1\n\n1\n\n0.75\n\n0.74\n\n15\n\n14\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.73\n73\n2600\n\n3000\n\nFigure 3.\n\nHardwall Engine Takeoff Performance, Low Speed Engine.\n\n3400\n\n4200\n\n3800\n\n4600\n\n5000\n\nF,. lb\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 4.\n\nHardwall Engine Cruise Performance,\nLow Speed Engine.\n\n5400\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY OF THE\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\n\na.

Configuration 5(b)\n(with single aft splitter) was selected since the low speed engine with wall\ntreatment is dominated by aft fan noise, and the major impact on flyover EPNdB\nConfiguration 5(c)\nwill be realized by reducing the aft noise constituent.\nincorporates massive suppression in both fan inlet and exhaust ducts and also\nrequires turbine and core noise suppression. This arrangement represents the\nminimum noise level that could be reasonably achieved with this engine and\nentails significant compromise in the nacelle.\nThe only type of acoustic liner considered in this study is the singlelayer lining formed with a perforated plate bonded to a honeycomb cellular\nstructure which is, in turn, bonded to an impervious backing sheet. The\nperforated plate is the resistive impedance element, while reactive impedance\nis due to both the perforated plate and the air volume in the honeycomb cells.\nBy using combinations of different lining constructions, it is possible to\nbroaden the effective bandwidth of the single-layer type. The acoustic suppression realized by this treatment is discussed in Section 4.0.\nThe external aerodynamic characteristics and pertinent internal characteristics are summarized in Table VI. The nacelle weights and engineering\ncost estimates are tabulated in Table VII.\n3.3\n\nINSTALLED PERFORMANCE\n\nThe internal installation losses are summarized in Table VIII for the\ntakeoff thrust and in Table IX for altitude cruise SFC. The installed\ntakeoff thrusts and cruise SFC characteristics are compared in Figures 6\nand 7.\nThe effects of the various installed performance, weights, and costs on\naircraft operating costs (DOC) are evaluated in Section 7.0.\n\n14\n\nTable VI.\n\nNacelle Configuration\n\nLow Speed Engine Nacelle Description.\n\nHardwall\n\nTreated Walls\n\nTreated Walls\n+ 1 Aft Splitter\n\nTreated Walls\n+ 3 inlet Splitters\n+ 2 Aft Splitters\n\n226 (5.75\n\n262 (6.67)\n\nExternal Characteristics\nNacelle Length, in.

As a\nconsequence, the nacelle diameter had to be increased, the thrust reverser had\nto be moved aft, and the overall length of the nacelle had to be increased.\nThe specific changes required in the nacelle to accommodate the two aft\n\nsplitters are shown in Section 3.2 and the effects on inlet installed performance are described in Section 3.3.\nIn the case where maximum suppression of the fan is utilized (that is\nthe three-ring inlet splitter and the two-ring exhaust splitter), the fan noise\nwas suppressed enough such that the turbine and internal source noises also\ncontributed significantly to the overall noise. In this case, additional\nacoustic treatment was incorporated aft of the core to suppress both the high\nfrequency turbine tones and low frequency internal noise. The geometry\ncharacteristics of this treatment are shown in Figure 15. The insertion losses\nobtained from this treatment at the angle of maximum noise from the inlet\n(1100) is shown in Figure 16. The suppression effectiveness was slightly\ndifferent between the takeoff and approach cases (due to the change in the\nspeed of sound with the change in temperature).\n4.1.3\n\nSuppressed Engine Noise Characteristics\n\nThe unsuppressed engine noise characteristics described in Section 4.1.1\nwere modified by reducing the 1/3 octave band spectral distributions of the\nseparate components by the insertion losses described in Section 4.1.2. By\nsumming these modified sources at each angle along the 200-ft (60.96 m) sideline the overall directivity characteristics of the suppressed nacelles are\nobtained. Figure 17 shows the directivity characteristics of the low speed\nengine at approach and takeoff power for the four installation configurations\nconsidered. The use of wall treatment is seen to be effective in reducing\nthe overall noise levels 5 to 6 PNdB in both the forward and aft quadrants.\nThe use of the single exhaust splitter reduced the aft end noise about 3 PNdB\nat approach and takeoff. This splitter also reduced the front end noise\nslightly, particularly for the takeoff condition where the total noise level\nis clearly aft dominated. The fully suppressed case with three inlet and two\nexhaustsplitters produces an additional overall noise reduction but the\namount of reduction is not as much as would be anticipated when comparing the\ninsertion losses for the splitters as shown in Figure 14. In this case the\noverall noise levels are held up by contributions from jet noise at takeoff\npower and internal and turbine noise in both takeoff and approach.\n4.1.4\n\nComparisons with Quiet Engine "A"\n\nWhile directly analogous configurations of the low speed engine and\nEngine A are not available, Engine A was tested with acoustically treated\nduct walls with treatment areas as shown in Table XI.\n\n29\n\nApproach\n\n(2.5)\n92 2)\n\nMax.

The primary cycle characteristics are-tabulated in Table XII. An\nengine cycle representative of CTOL applications has been selected to provide\nfor a mixed core and fan stream ahead of the nozzle. The jet velocity shown in\nTable XII represents the velocity after mixing. Inlet recoveries, duct losses,\nmixing losses and nozzle thrust coefficients used in the cycle are shown in\nTable XIII. The engine flowpath configuration is shown in Figure 20. A short\ntabulation of the major component characteristics is contained in Table XIV.\nThe high speed engine fan applies the measured performance characteristics\nof Fan C in the bypass flow modified to a higher aspect ratio, tip-shrouded configuration with 46 blades. The fan pressure ratio of 1.55 was selected as a near\noptimum value for CTOL installations balancing the installed performance characteristics with a takeoff jet noise level of about FAR 36-20. A clean stall margin\nin excess of 17% should provide stall-free operation in the most severe operational\nenvironment anticipated for this engine. The Fan C radius ratio of 0.38 was\nretained, with booster stages added to provide the desired core supercharging\npressure ratio of 2.5. Three booster stages were selected to meet the requirement of boost pressure ratio plus an adequate stall margin, and this selection\nwas based on aerodynamic loadings consistent with the CF6-50 engine booster\nstages.\nA four-stage low pressure turbine was selected to provide a moderately\nhighly loaded turbine consistent with the design efficiency objective.\nThe overall nominal (hardwall) engine takeoff thrust is shown in\nFigure\n21 and attitude cruise SFC is shown in Figure 22.\n\n5.2\n\nNACELLE CONFIGURATIONS\n\nOverall arrangement:\nillustrated in Figure 23.\nare:\n\nThe engine is installed in a long duct nacelle,\nAs in the low speed engine, the major features\n\n1.\n\nMixed core and fan flows\n\n2.\n\nFan thrust reverser upstream of the mixing plane\n\nThe impact of incorporating various degrees of acoustical treatment\nwas investigated by comparing the following configurations:\ni.\n2.\n36\n\nBasic Nacelle without treatment\nWith wall treatment only\n\nTable XII.\n\nQEP Trade Study, High Speed Fan Cycle.\n\nM=0, SL\nT/O\n860 F (300 C) Day\n\nM=.85, 35K\nMax Cruise\nStd. + 100 C Day\n\nThrust - lb (N)\n\n22,000 (97,900)\n\n4950 (22,000 N)\n\nWyo/S - lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n814 (370)\n\n911 (414)\n\nFan Pressure Ratio\n\n1.47\n\n1.55\n\nBypass Ratio\n\n6.35\n\n6.4\n\n2330 (1277)\n\n2140 (1172)\n\nCore Supercharging Pressure Ratio\n\n1.6\n\n2.4\n\nCore Corrected Flow - lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n58 (26.4)\n\n59 (26.8)\n\nOverall Pressure Ratio\n\n24\n\n28\n\nJet Velocity - ft/sec (m/sec)\n\n920 (280)\n\nTurbine Rotor (Cycle) Temperature,\n\n0\n\nF (O C)\n\nTable XIII.\n\nNominal Installation Allowances, High Speed Engine.\n\nM=0, SL\nT/O\n860 F (30* C) Day\nInlet Recovery\n\nP/P\n\nM=.85, 35K\nMax Cruise\nStd. + 100 C Day\n\n0.9982\n\n0.9974\n\nDuct Loss\nAP/ %\n(includes mixer friction loss)\n\n0.97\n\n1.15\n\nMixing Loss\n\n0.26\n\n0.91\n\n0.996\n\n0.996\n\nAP/p%\n\nNozzle Thrust Coefficient, Cv\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY OF THE\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\n\nr4\n\n*r\n\n-4\n\n0,\n-4\n\nIo\n-4\nC4\nTZ\n*r3\n\nB3\n\nTable XIV.\n\nQEP Trade Study, Design Summary - High Speed Fan.\n\nFan Aero\nDiameter, inches (m)\n\n68.3 (1.74)\n\nCorrected Flow, lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n911\n\nPressure Ratio\n\n(414)\n\n1.55\n\nCorrected Tip Speed, Design Takeoff,\nft/sec (m/sec)\nCorrected Flow/Annulus Area,\n\nb/sec-ft 2\n\nFan Blade\nMaterial\n\n1550/1440 (472/439)\n\nSame\nT.O.\nas\nCF6-6\n\n41.8\n\nti\n\nShroud Location\n\nTip\n\nTip Chord, inches (m)\n\n6-6.5 (0.15-0.17)\n\nBlade-Vane Spacing\n\n2 chords\n\nNB\n\n45-50\n\nBypass OGV\nNv\n\n90\n\nBooster\nCore Supercharging Pressure Ratio\n\n2.4\n\nNumber of Booster Stages\n\n3\n\nBooster Corrected Flow, lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n122 (55.5)\n\nLow Pressure Turbine\nNumber of Stages\n\n4\n\nAverage Pitch Line Loading\n\n1.1\n\nLast Stage Tip Diameter, inches (m)\n\n39.1 (.99)\n\nCore Design\nCore Corrected Flow, lb/sec (kg/sec)\n\n59.1 (26.9)\n\nNumber of Compressor Stages\nCore Compressor Ratio\n\n11.5\n\nNumber of Turbine Stages\n\n40\n\n9\n\n1\n\n21\n\n20\n\n89.0\n\n--\n\nFN, N\n22,240\n\n18,670\n\n13,444\n0.78\n\n19\n\n80.0\n\n-\n\n18\n\n0.77\n\n0.76\n\n17\n\n-71.1\n\n16\n\n0.75\n\n0.74\n\n15\n\n0.73\n\n14\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n2600\n\n3000\n\nFigure 21.\n\nrU\n\nHardwall Engine Takeoff Performance, High Speed Engine.\n\n3400\n\n4200\n\n3800\n\n4600\n\n5000\n\nFN, lb,\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 22.\n\nHardwall Engine Cruise Performance, High Speed Engine.\n\n5400\n\na.

Configuration 23(b)\n(with single inlet and aft splitter) was selected since the high speed engine\nwith wall treatment is nearly balanced between inlet and aft noise at\ntakeoff and, in order to make full impact on flyover EPNdB, both fore and aft\nnoise constituent must be reduced. Configuration 23(c) incorporates massive\nsuppression in both fan inlet and exhaust ducts and requires turbine and core\nnoise suppression as well. This arrangement represents the minimum noise\nlevel that could be reasonably achieved with this engine and entails significant\ncompromise in the nacelle.\nAs with the low speed engine, the only type of acoustic liner is the singlelayer lining. Combinations of different lining constructions are used to\nbroaden the effective bandwidth of the single-layer type.\nThe external aerodynamic characteristics and pertinent internal characteristics are summarized in Table XV.

The parameters used in\nthe turbine noise estimates are listed in Table XIX. The turbine, mixed jet,\nand internal noise sources were estimated using the procedures described in\nAppendix A.\nFigure 26 shows the spectral distributions for the four noise\nsources at approach power for the angle corresponding to the maximum forward\nnoise (at 500) and for the maximum aft noise at 1200.\nFigure 27 shows the\ncorresponding 1/3 octave band spectral distribution at takeoff power. (The high\ntones at 1000 Hz in Figure 27 are the MPT\'s which are radiated from the fan\ninlet - but are also prominent in the aft angles.) Corresponding distributions\nare used at every 100 increment from 200 to 1600.\nThe noise sources expressed as PNdB at the 200-ft (60.96 m) sideline at\nthe approach power setting are shown in Figure 28 for sideline angles from 200\nto 1500.\n(Fan rpm at approach is 60% of aero design.) The total PNdB from\nthese sources and corresponding directivity plot for the takeoff condition are\nalso shown in Figure 28. The fan is clearly the dominant noise source at\ntakeoff with the front end noise being high because of strong multiple pure\ntones characteristic of high speed (supersonic) fans. The overall 200-ft\n(60.96 m) sideline perceived noise levels as a function of the acoustic angle\nare summarized in Figure 29 for the takeoff and approach power settings.\n\n6.2\n\nNOISE SUPPRESSION\n\nAgain, the initial step in suppressing engine noise is the use of acoustic\nmaterial in the fan duct. The treatments selected for the high speed fan duct\nwere tuned to the dominant frequencies which controlled the PNdB level at\ntakeoff. The predicted effectiveness of this treatment was based on both\nstatic duct tests as well as measurements obtained from Engine C. The suppression characteristics at the various 1/3 octave band frequencies are shown\nin Figure 30. Corresponding suppression was incorporated at other angles,\nagain based as a fraction of that obtained at the angle of maximum suppression\nas shown in Figure 31..\nThe suppression obtained from the treatment in the aft fan ducts is shown\nAgain, the suppression\nin Figure 32 for approach and takeoff power settings.\nat other angles was related to that at the maximum angle as shown in Figure 31.\nCorresponding insertion losses were estimated using a single splitter and\na three-ring splitter in addition to the wall treatment at the inlet, with the\noverall suppression also shown in Figure 30.

The two-ring splitter was designed to obtain\nmaximum suppression with the duct annulus area adjusted for optimum Mach number\ndistribution through the duct and splitter. As a consequence, the nacelle\ndiameter had to be increased, the thrust reverser had to be moved aft, and the\noverall length of the nacelle had to be increased. The specific changes\nrequired in the nacelle are listed in Section 5.2 and the effects on inlet\ninstalled performance are described in Section 5.3.\nIn the case where maximum suppression of the fan is utilized (that is the\nthree-ring inlet splitter and the two-ring exhaust splitter), the fan noise was\nsuppressed enough such that the turbine noise and internal source noises also\ncontributed significantly to the overall. In this case, additional acoustic\ntreatment was incorporated aft of the core to suppress both the high frequency\nturbine tones and low frequency internal noise. The insertion losses obtained\nfrom this treatment at the angle of maximum noise from the inlet (1100) is\nshown in Figure 33. The suppression effectiveness was slightly different\nbetween the takeoff and approach cases.\n6.3\n\nSUPPRESSED ENGINE NOISE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe initial engine noise characteristics described in Section 4.1.1 were\nmodified by reducing the 1/3 octave band spectral distributions of the separate\ncomponents by the insertion losses described in Section 4.1. By summing these\nmodified sources at each angle along the 200-ft (60.96 m) sideline the overall\ndirectivity characteristics of the suppressed nacelles are obtained. Figure 34\nshows the directivity characteristics of the High Speed Engine at approach and\ntakeoff power for the four installation configurations considered. The use of\nwall treatment is seen to be effective in reducing noise levels about 6 PNdB\nat the aft angles. The higher suppression at forward angles (up to 8 PNdB) is\nbased on observed results from Engine C, where the high MPT levels were concentrated near the duct wall and responded more effectively than the more\nnearly radially constant blade passing tones. The use of the single exhaust\nsplitter reduced the aft end noise about 3 to 4 PNdB at approach and takeoff.\nThe single inlet splitter reduced the front end noise by about 3 PNdB at approach\nand takeoff.\nThe fully suppressed case with three inlet and two exhaust splitters\nproduces an additional overall noise reduction but again the amount of reduction\nin the aft angle is not as much as would be anticipated when comparing the\ninsertion losses for the splitters as shown in Figure 32. The overall noise\nlevels are also held up by contributions from jet noise at takeoff power and\ninternal and turbine noise in both takeoff and approach.\n\n58\n\n60\n\nCore Exhaust Treatment\n\n\'\n\n1100 from Inlet\n\n50\n\nCc1\nc\n\n4\no\n\n20\n\nc\nCd Q)\n\n0\n10\n\n__"__\n\nTa\n\nApproach\n\n_\n\nf\n-\n\na\n\n100\n\n--\n\n---\n\n1000\n\n10,000\n\nFrequency, Hertz\n\nFigure 33.\n\nCore Exhaust Suppression, High Speed Engine.\n\n59\n\nAcoustic Angle, Radians\n\nApproach Power\n\n0\n\nO\nO\n\nO\n\n0\n\nOO\n\n0\nC\n\nO\n\n0\n\n1\n\n100\n\n2.62\n\n2.27\n\n1.92\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\n1.57\n\n1.2\n\n0.87\n\n0.52\n\n120\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\nI\n\n6\n990\n\nV\n\nOne Inlet and One Exhaust Splitter\n\n0 Untreated\n\n8\n\n0 Wall Treated\n\no\n\n9 Three Inlet and Two Exhaust Splitters\n\nC4\n\n130\nTakeoff Power\nOO\n0\n0\n\n120\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nO\n\nO\n\n0\n0\n\nI\n\n0\n\nO\n\no\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n[]99\n\n0\n\n0\n\n90\n\n100\n\n90\n\n40\n\n20\nInlet\n\nFigure 34.\n\n60\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAcoustic Angle, Degrees\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\nExhaust\n\nDirectivity Characteristics of the High Speed Engine at\nApproach and Takeoff Power.\n\n6.4\n\nCOMPARISONS WITH QUIET ENGINE "C"\n\nThe most directly analogous configurations of the high speed engine and\nQuiet Engine C are the fully suppressed configurations compared in Table XX.\nTable XX.\n\nTreatment Area Comparison.\nFan Exhaus\n\nFan Inlet\nft 2\n\n.

The ground boundary\nlayer or EGA factor is further modified by GE/Acoustic Engineering\nwith the assumption that it applies only in a layer below a 100-ft\n(30.48 m) altitude.

From this predicted spectrum PNL and PNLT values are calculated.\nThis information is then used to calculate an EPNL value for the flyover event\nas specified in FAR 36.

The constituent breakdown for the individual sources is shown in a corresponding plot\nin Figure 37. The fan noise dominates for the hardwall nacelle, the wall\ntreated nacelle and the single exhaust splitter configurations. Internal\n(combustion and core) noise is also above the jet noise level (when relative\nvelocity effects are considered). Turbine noise is not a major contributor.\nThe EPNL that would result from the individual sources is also shown on the\nright. For the bypass ratio and mixed-jet cycle selected, jet noise is more\nthan 10 PNLT below the fan noise when the relative velocity effect is included.\nThe configuration with three fan inlet and two fan exhaust splitters\nreduced the fan noise to a level such that core noise became a significant\ncontributor even on takeoff. Additional core suppression (as well as turbine\nsuppression) was incorporated in this configuration to produce the relative\nconstituent levels shown in Figure 38.\nApproach\nCorresponding overall flyover time histories are shown for the 40% FN\napproach condition in Figure 39 with the resultant EPNL indicated on the\nright for each configuration. These levels are reduced by 1.5 EPNdB to account\nfor a revised tri-jet approach power setting of 34% FN (rather than 40% F .\nN)\nThe relative constituent levels at approach are shown in Figure 40. At\napproach both turbine and core noise are contributing to the suppressed fan\nlevels leading to the need for the turbine suppression mentioned above. The\nflyover constituent levels for the fully suppressed configuration at approach\nare shown in Figure 41.\nThe above estimates are obtained using component data taken over a hard\nsurface without correction for ground nulls, etc. Experience has shown that\nuse of static data obtained with a hard surface for flyover predictions will\ngenerally overpredict the EPNL by about 2 EPNL when compared with actual\nmeasurements. A significant factor in this difference is considered to be a\nresult of the use of normal sod surfaces during certification rather than hard\nsurfaces. As a consequence the anticipated noise levels corresponding to a\nnormal certification measurement would be the above estimates (shown in the\npreceding figures) reduced by 2.0 EPNL. The final EPNL values, (reflecting\nthis 2 EPNL reduction) for the tri-jet aircraft at the FAR 36 takeoff\nand approach certification conditions are summarized in Table XXIV.\nThe results shown in Table XXIV are considered representative of "status"\nlevels, that is, expected levels based on demonstrated components, suppression\neffectiveness with current materials, etc.\n\n7.4.4\n\nHigh Speed Engine Flyover Noise\nTakeoff\n\nThe high speed engine acoustic characteristics described in Section 5\nwere incorporated in the Flyover Noise Prediction procedure on the flight paths\nshown in Table XXIII.

Both high and low\nspeed engines meet the FAR 36 requirements in a treated-wall nacelle configuration, and are significantly below the FAR 36 requirements in the fully suppressed\nnacelle. It has been determined that the economic penalty associated with the\nmaximum feasible noise reduction (fully suppressed nacelle) is significant.\nThe EPNL/DOC relationship determined in the preliminary flight engine\ndesign study is shown in Figure 56. Considering both noise and DOC effects,\nat full power takeoff noise levels between FAR 36 and FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdB,\nwith a typical tri-jet CTOL transport, a high speed engine in a treated wall\nnacelle appears to be the most economically attractive. As can be seen on\nFigure 56, the high speed engine yields a greater noise reduction for similar\nnoise reduction features. For significant noise reductions below about FAR 36\nminus 5 EPNdB, the cost increases for both low and high speed engines. For noise\nlevels below approximately FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdB to FAR 36 minus 7 EPNdB the lower\nsource noise of the low speed engine begins to dominate, and on a DOC basis,\nappears more economically attractive.\nTechnology developed since the conduct of the preliminary flight engine design\nstudy documented in this report indicates that the range of economic attractiveness of high speed fan engines may extend to lower noise levels.\n\n90\n\n8\nNote:\nSee Table I for Letter\nDesignations\n\nE\n\n6\n\nLow Speed\n\n24\n\nD\n0\nB\nC\nA\n\n-2\nHigh Speed\n\n0 High Speed Engine\nO\n\nA\n\nLow Speed Engine\n\n-4\n+5\n\nt\n\nFAR 36\n(100 EPNdB)\n\n-5\n\n.\n\n-10\n-10\n\n-15\n-5\n\nEPNdB\n\nFigure 56.\n\nEPNL/DOC Relationship (Takeoff, No\nCut-Back, Untraded).\n\n91\n\nAPPENDIX A\nNOISE PREDICTION PROCEDURES\n\nI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFor high bypass fans typical of the Quiet Engine System, fan noise is\nthe prominent component. Additional important engine noise sources include\njet noise, turbine noise, and internal noise radiated rearward through the\ncore exhaust duct. During an airplane flyover, noises from these engine\nsources peak at different instants and contribute to a complicated history of\nthe flyover noise event. Since all engine noise sources are also present\nduring static ground noise tests and information and verification of analytical\ntechniques is available on this basis, static noise levels were obtained as\nthe first step in providing airplane flyover noise levels.\n\nII.\n\nFAN NOISE SCALING METHOD\n\nThe basic measured full-scale fan sound pressure levels were applied to a\ngeneralized spectrum scaling program in which the data are corrected for\natmospheric absorption and for assumed scattering losses or EGA at the input\narc distance prior to scaling. This produces an "ideal" are spectrum. After\nfrequency shifts attributable to speed and blade number changes and application\nof a weight flow adder, projection to the desired sideline is accomplished\nusing square law distance effect, absorption , and standard EGA.\nIII.\n\nTURBINE NOISE PREDICTION METHOD\n\nThe noise spectra of the last two stages of the low pressure turbine for\nhigh speed and low speed engines were analytically predicted at both takeoff\nand approach power settings. GE computer program prediction routines were used\nin calculating these noise spectra. These computer programs require as inputs:\nbasic geometry, aerodynamic, and cyclic parameters for each engine prediction.\nSee Table X for some of the more important parameters used.\n\nIV.\n\nINTERNAL NOISE PREDICTION METHOD\n\nTwo low frequency noise sources, formally classified as "jet" noise, are\nassociated with the gas generator exhaust:\nExternal jet noise - caused by interactions outside the engine.\nInternal noise - similar in frequency to jet, but generated in the engine.\nThe similarity between this noise and jet noise makes them inseparable on\na farfield noise measurement basis and is usually pointed out as the reason\nfor jet noise not decaying with a V8 slope at low jet velocities [less than\n800 ft/sec (244 m/sec)].\n\n93\n\nRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMSED\n\nThe specific sources (or source) of engine generated rumble are unknown.\nIt most likely is caused by several sources in the combustor/turbine section.\nA prediction method is used which relates core noise to compressor discharge\nflow, temperature, and pressure and the combustor exit temperature. The method\nagrees well with noise data obtained on a TF34 engine with the fan highly\nsuppressed and with noise data from turboshaft engines which have negligible\njet noise.\n\nV.\n\nMIXED JET NOISE PREDICTION METHOD\n\nMixed-flow jet noise was predicted based on test data from the Acoustic\nAerodynamic Mixer Noise Tests performed by Fluidyne Engineering Corporation at\ntheir Medicine Lake Aerodynamic Laboratory (Reference 6).\nThe configuration\nwas an 18-lobe, area ratio 3.37, partial mixer with a bypass ratio (fan flow\nto core flow) of 6 to 1.\n\n94\n\nAPPENDIX B\nDOC CALCULATIONAL PROCEDURE\n\nAn outline of the DOC calculation procedure used in the current high speed\nand low speed engine study is compared to the corresponding economic elements\nused in previous NASA studies (Reference 5).\nThe economic factors are applied to variable-size airplanes on the basis\nof holding the payload and range constant as the two-fan engine in the various\nnacelles are installed on the aircraft.\n\n95\n\nDOC CALCULATION PROCEDURE\n\nQuiet Engine Trade Study\n(Consistent with ATT Studies)\n\n1967\n\n1967\n\nPrice Base\n\nAll Costs - $/Block Hour\n\nFlying Operations\nCrew Pay-Domestic\nSubsonic Jet\n\nNASA Report DAC-68255A\n(NAS3-11151) Tables XI, XII\n\n-5\n(2 man) 5x10 5\n-5\n\n(3 man) 5x10\n\n(Max.

Utilization of any of the quiet\nengine/nacelle combinations, both high speed and low speed fan engines, results\nin an approximately 40 to 50% DOC increase compared to the JT3D-powered\nDC-8-type aircraft. The primary reason for the sizable increase in DOC is the\ncost of the new engines and nacelles. A five year life (depreciation period)\nwas assumed for this study. In fact, the DOC increase would undoubtedly be\neven greater than this study indicates since the current study had to assume\nno major airframe changes. A detailed examination of aircraft aerodynamics,\nincluding stability and control aspects, could potentially reveal the need for\nairframe changes resulting in even greater retrofit associated costs.\nThe maximum EPNL reduction resulting from the application of the Quiet\nEngine/nacelle configurations to the DC-8-type aircraft is approximately 20 EPNdB\ncompared to the JT3D-powered version (takeoff).\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis study investigated the effects on DOC of replacing the JT3D on a DC-8type aircraft with both high and low speed quiet engines. The quiet engines\nand nacelle characteristics used in this study were those defined in Section\n3 (low speed engine) and Section 5 (high speed engine) of this report, and\nthe pertinent aircraft charateristics were obtained from Reference 7. Factors\nconsidered in the study included engine and nacelle weight and cost, engine\nspecific fuel consumption at cruise, and aircraft noise at the takeoff and\napproach noise rating points.\nBased on an evaluation of these parameters the changes in Direct Operating\nCost and in EPNL at the rating points were estimated for a DC-8-type aircraft\nwith either high or low speed quiet engines with varying degrees of nacelle\nacoustic treatment. Estimates of the changes in DOC were obtained using the\nprocedure applied in the ATT Studies (Reference 4) described in Appendix B.\n\nIII. DC-8-TYPE AIRCRAFT NOISE CHARACTERISTICS WITH QUIET ENGINES\nThe noise characteristics of the low speed and high speed quiet engines with\nvarying amounts of nacelle acoustic treatment are described in detail in Sections\n4 and 6, respectively, of this report. Using these engine and nacelle acoustic\ncharacteristics, the EPNL\'s were estimated for a DC-8-type aircraft equipped with\nthe various engine/nacelle configurations. The resultant EPNL values, summarized\nin Table XXVII, were derived using the method defined in Section 7.4 of this\nreport.\n103\n\nTable XXVII.\n\nDC-8-Type Aircraft EPNL.\n\nHigh Speed\nQuiet Engine\n\nLow Speed\nQuiet Engine\n\nT.O.\n\nApp.\n\nT.O.\n\nApp.\n\nT.O.\n\nApp.\n\nT.O.\n\nApp.\n\nHardwall Nacelle\n\n107.9\n\n109.2\n\n101.7\n\n101.5\n\n116\n\n118\n\n103\n\n106\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n\n102.3\n\n101.9\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n+1 Inlet Splitter\n+1 Aft Splitter\n\n100.7\n\n95.5\n\n93.3\n\n95.1\n\n92.6\n\n89.6\n\n98.3\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n+3 Inlet Splitters\n+2 Aft Splitters\n\nFAR36\n\n96.8\n\n96.1\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n+1 Aft Splitter\n\n97.4.\n\nJT3D\n\nAs can be seen from the tabulated EPNL values the application of low speed\nquiet engines with the basic nacelle without treatment results in a pronounced\nreduction from the JT3D-powered DC-8-type aircraft. Use of the high speed\nquiet engines in the basic nacelle without treatment configuration also results\nin a sizable noise reduction from the JT3D-powered version, although not as large\na reduction as the low speed quiet engine provides. However, this is partially\noffset by the fact that the additional treatment configurations provide somewhat\n\nmore reduction with the high speed quiet engine than they do with the low speed\nquiet engine. The addition of the maximum treatment considered, in both high\nand low speed quiet engines, results in approximately 3 EPNL more "baseline"\nto "maximum" suppression for the high speed quiet engine powered DC-8-type aircraft than for the low speed quiet engine powered version.\n\nIV.\n\nDIRECT OPERATING COST COMPARISONS\n\nThe DOC of a DC-8-type aircraft utilizing both high and low speed quiet\nengines with various nacelle treatment configurations were compared to the DOC\nof a JT3D-powered version. The DOC estimates were calculated using the method\ndescribed in Appendix B. The weight and performance characteristics of the\nhigh and low speed quiet engines with various nacelle acoustic treatment\nconfigurations were obtained from Sections 3 and 4, respectively, of this report\nand are summarized in Table XXVIII. The DC-8-type aircraft characteristics\npertinent to the DOC estimation were obtained from Reference 7, and are\nsummarized in Table XXIX.\nThe cost items included in the DOC calculation are shown in Table XXX, as\nwell as what each of the cost items is a function of.

As can be seen in Table XXX the other cost items (e.g., crew\npay and aircraft spares) are not a function of the engine/nacelle/aircraft\nconfiguration being studied.\nAs noted from Reference 7, a rigorous comparison of the DOC results of\nan engine substitution into an existing aircraft configuration would require a\nthorough and detailed design and analysis effort. Such an effort would need to\nconsider detailed nacelle and pylon design, aircraft takeoff and cruise performance, stability characteristics, range, payload, and stage length. Evaluation\nof these factors would involve a design effort of major proportions including\nstructural, stability and control, drag, and flutter investigations.\nHowever, it was possible to make a number of logical simplifying assumptions and arrive at a consistent set of differential DOC values. The aicraft\nwith quiet engines were assumed to continue to operate over the same stage\nlengths as the JT3D-powered version. Due to the improved SFC of the quiet\nengines and the assumption of the same stage length, the aircraft payload\nbecomes space limited and payload variations need not be a consideration,\neven though the quiet engines and acoustically treated nacelles result in a\nhigher operating weight empty than the JT3D-powered version. Table XXXI\nsummarizes the weight changes due to application at the various quiet engine/\nnacelle configurations.\nAn additional assumption is required at this point, i.e., the aircraft\nbasic structure need not be modified to accept the quiet engines and nacelles.\nThe high and low speed quiet engines in this study were sized at 22,000 lb\n(97,900 N) thrust at takeoff, essentially the same size as used for the studies\nreported in Reference 7. Therefore, the DC-8-type aircraft performance and\nengine/airframe physical integration aspects could be considered essentially\nthe same as reported in Reference 7. The specific high and low speed quiet\nengine and nacelle weights and costs were considered as described in this\nAppendix.\nWith these assumptions it becomes possible to calculate the differential\nDOC values for the quiet engines with various nacelle acoustic treatment configurations. The depreciation period used for the calculation of retrofit\nassociated costs, 5 years, was the same as used in Reference 7. The results\nof these DOC calculations are summarized in Table XXII.\nThe vast increase in DOC resulting from the application of either high or\nlow speed quiet engines to a DC-8-type aircraft completely overshadows the DOC\nvariations among the various high and low speed quiet engine and nacelle configurations. The single most significant factor causing the major increase in\nDOC when replacing the JT3D with quiet engines is the cost of the quiet engines\nand acoustically treated nacelles. The DOC is therefore, greatly affected by\nthe depreciation period assumed, i.e., the assumed useful life of the retrofitted\naircraft. Reference 7 assumed 5 years, as did the study reported in this\nAppendix. That depreciation period would need to be tripled to reduce the\nincrease in DOC to a level where the differences in DOC for the high speed\n\n108\n\nTable XXXI.\n\nWeight Change Summary, Four Engines and Nacelles.\n\nWeight\nWeight\nRemoved, lb (kg) Added, lb (kg)\n\nJT3D Installation\n\nA Weight\nlb (kg)\n\n36,858 (16,760)\n\nLow Speed QE\nHardwall Nacelle\n\n40,826 (18,560)\n\n+ 3968 (1805)\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n\n41,422 (18,820)\n\n+ 4564 (2075)\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle and One\n\n41,698 (18,980)\n\n+ 4840 (2200)\n\n45,018 (20,460)\n\n+ 8160 (3710)\n\nHardwall Nacelle\n\n38,830 (17,660)\n\n+ 1972 (897)\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle\n\n39,046 (17,760)\n\nTreated Wall Nacelle with Inlet\n\n39,970 (18,170)\n\n4+ 2188 (996)\n+ 3112 (1414)\n\n42,510 (19,320)\n\n+ 5652 (2570)\n\nAft Splitter\nTreated Wall Nacelle with 3 Inlet\nand 2 Aft Splitters\nHigh Speed QE\n\nSplitter and 1 Aft Splitter\nTreated Wall Nacelle with 3 Inlet\nand 2 Aft Splitters\n\nTable XXXII.\n\nDC-8-Type Aircraft, ADOC with Quiet Engines\n(JT3D Base).\n\nA DOC - %\n\nConfiguration\n\nLow .Speed\nQuiet Engine\n\nHigh Speed\nQuiet Engine\n\nBasic Nacelle with Treatment\n\n+41.6\n\nWall Treatment Only\n\n+48.5\n\n+41.9\n\nWall Treatment and Single Aft\nSplitter\n\n+48.8\n\n+42.5\n\nWall Treatment with 3 Inlet\nSplitters and 2 Aft Splitters\n\n110\n\n+48.2\n\n+52.5\n\n+45.4\n\nJT3D\n\nquiet engines and low speed quiet engine and nacelle acoustic treatment\nconfiguration variations would become significant.\nFigure 57 shows the change in DOC as a function of the noise reduction\nrelated to the JT3D-powered DC-8-type aircraft as a base. As can be seen, use\nof the high speed quiet engine results in the least increase in DOC required to\nattain a noise level equivalent to FAR36. However, for noise levels below\napproximately FAR36-10 the low speed quiet engine results in less DOC increase\nthan the high speed quiet engine. It should be noted that use of either the\nhigh or low speed quiet engine results.in a significant DOC increase, even in\nthe hardwall (minimum suppression) version due to the retrofit costs discussed\npreviously.\n\n111\n\n55I\n\nO\n\nHigh Speed Engine\n\nO\n\nLow Speed Engine\n\nLow Speed\n\n50\n\n40\n0\n\n-5\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\nSFAR\nJT3D\n\nPowered\n\nFigure 57.\n\n112\n\n-20\n\n36\n\nt\n\nEPNdB\n\nQuiet Engines in DC-8-Type Aircraft, Takeoff.\n\n-25\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nGiffin, R.G., Parker, D.E., and Dunbar, L.W., "Experimental\nQuiet Engine Program Aerodynamic Performance of Fan A,"\nNASA CR-120858, May 1971.\n\n2.\n\nGiffin, R.G., Parker, D.E., and Dunbar, L.W., "Experimental Quiet\nEngine Program Aerodynamic Performance of Fan B," NASA CR-72993,\nAugust, 1972.\n\n3.\n\nGiffin, R.G., Parker, D.E., and Dunbar, L.W., "Experimental Quiet\nEngine Program Aerodynamic Performance of Fan C," NASA CR-120981,\nAugust, 1972.\n\n4.\n\n"Propulsion System Studies for an Advanced High Subsonic, Long Range\nJet Commercial Transport Aircraft," NASA CR-121016, November, 1972.\n\n5.\n\nDouglas Report DAC-68255A (NASA Contract NAS3-11151).\n\n6.\n\nHolmberg, S.W., "Hot/Cold Flow Model Tests to Determine the Noise\n\nCharacteristics of Two High Bypass Ratio Aerodynamic Mixer Exhaust\nNozzles," Fluidyne Report 0787, May 1971.\n7.\n\nMcBride, J.F., "The Integration of Quiet Engines with Subsonic Tansport\n\nAircraft," NASA CR-72548, August 1969.\n\n113\n\nREPORT DISTRIBUTION LIST\n\nAddressee:\n1.\n\nNumber of Copies\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center\n21000 Brookpark Road\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\nAttention:\nReport Control Office\nTechnology Utilization Office\nLibrary\nDr. S.C.
