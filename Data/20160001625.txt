FEM design and analysis can be accommodated during\nconceptual design without adding onerous requirements for\nhigher levels of design detail\n- Serious structural design issues can be assessed, identified and\nresolved without slowing down the pace of design\n2. Design and analysis methods can be applied intelligently by\ndesigners who are not structural specialists\n- Tool specific details have been pushed into the background\n3. FEM model results correlate with actual mass property data\nthrough use of mass-correlated \xcf\x83CDN\n4. VSP SAM MSWing capability impeded by V2 grid quality\nincluding at connections and absence of V3 structures module\n5. Otherwise VSP SAM methods are ready to replace parametric\nmass estimates for primary load carrying wing structure\n\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AEROSPACE\n\nContract Number: NNL13AA08\nTask Number:

This system was designed by the Dynamic Systems and\nControls Branch. This was designed to be a high intensity and very in depth\ncontroller unit. The board had custom designed components just for this\nproject. The time that we were working on this custom unit, I spent time\nlearning COTS units that could achieve the same end goal of flying this\nvehicle concept through a transition.\nI started to focus my attention on multiple different paths for a COTS unit to\naccomplish this task. In all my years in UAV\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to start for\nanswers is RC forums online, and talking to people in the industry. I found\nthat there are multiple VTOL UAV controllers, but they only do hover and\nforward flight, not transition from one to the other.\xc2\xa0\nI then tried starting a few different VTOL control boards that could possibly\nbe a research tool for the ASROV engineers.\n\nASROV Control Unit\n\nAPM 2.5 / PIXHAWK Controller Board\nI started doing hover only flights with the APM 2.5 on the\nGLARF (25lb) model as shown in the picture. This model\nhovered great with it APM, but no capability for forward\nflight transition.\nThen proceeded to investigate using the APM for\ntransition work on a quick 2 day build foam airplane. I\nlearned very quickly the issues in the code for using it as\na transition control board.\nThe open source software gives you\nflexibility to program anything, but\nit takes too long to modify the code.\nThe pixhawk board was now being\ninstalled as a data acquisition board only,\nnot to control the model in any fashion.\nThe pixhawk has a much higher frequency\ndata acquisition rate, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we used it\nonly for data collecting.\n\nKK Flight Controller Board\nDuring the research stage of finding different control boards to use I came across\nthe KK VTOL Mixer Control Board. I found this board on a RC Forum a man that\nwas designing/building VTOL UAV\xe2\x80\x99s that transition from hover to forward flight.\nHe designed a model that is similar to GL-10 called the XC-142, and the full scale\nmodel of this was built and flown in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. I knew that this transitional\ncontrol board would work for our VTOL design, and proceeded ahead testing it.\nThe board started being tested on a 2lb foamie all the way up to the 55lb GL-10\nmodel, and have had success all the way through!!!\n\nKK Control Board\nSubscale XC142 with KK Board\nduring transition period\n\nCARD\n\nMANEUVER\n\n1\n\nHover Directional Stability\n\n2\n\nSFF Pitch Trim & Authority\n\n3\n\nFull Transition / Tail Rotation Schedule\n\n4\n\nFwd Flight Stalls\n\n5\n\nRoll/Yaw Oscillation Investigation\n\n6\n\nHigher Weights\n\n7\n\nPitch and Directional Stability w/ Reducing\nTail sizes\n\nNote: Flight test cards are written for specific vehicles, but follow these descriptions\n\n1\n\nFoamie\t\r \xc2\xa0Hover\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n2\n\nFoamie\t\r \xc2\xa0Transi.on\t\r \xc2\xa0\n4\n3\n\nGLARF\nTransition\n\nGLARF Hover\n\n6\n\n5\nIndicates\nTethered\nFlight\nIndicates\nFree Flight\n\nGreased\nLightning\nHover\n\nGreased\nLightning\nTransition\n\nAeronautics Systems Analysis\nBranch, SACD, LaRC\n\nAirspeed\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0Vs.\t\r \xc2\xa0Flight\t\r \xc2\xa0Mode\t\r \xc2\xa0\n(6\t\r \xc2\xa0Full\t\r \xc2\xa0Transi5on\t\r \xc2\xa0Flights)\t\r \xc2\xa0\t\r \xc2\xa0\nSept\t\r \xc2\xa016\t\r \xc2\xa02014\t\r \xc2\xa0\nHover\n25\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n20\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nAirspeed\t\r \xc2\xa0(m/s)\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n15\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nAirsp\n10\t\r \xc2\xa0\need\n5\n\n0\n\n50% Transition\n\nForward Flight\n\n50% Transition\n\nHover\n\nPitch Angle Vs.

1\n\nIntroduction\nFlight has always captured man\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. This is evidenced by the great variety of aerial\nvehicles that exist today. Everything from \xef\xac\x81xed-wing to rotorcraft; satellites to spaceships;\nmono-wing to quadrotor. However, despite the wide variety of \xef\xac\x82ying vehicles, not one of them\nhas attained eternal \xef\xac\x82ight. Accomplishing this feat is one of the great challenges still facing\nthe aviation community.\n\nMotivation\n\nOutline\n\nAchieving eternal \xef\xac\x82ight opens the doors to atmospheric satellites. Existing satellites have a great\nnumber of capabilities that enrich our lives; however,\ntheir distance from the surface of the earth precludes\ncertain types of transmission capabilities. Once eternal \xef\xac\x82ight is achieved, that vehicle can serve the same\nrole as ordinary satellites, but its close proximity\nwill allow for real time two way communications,\nlike wireless broadband internet. And with active\ncontrols, atmospheric satellites would not be constrained to geosynchronous orbits, like our existing\nsatellite technology.\n\nThis research introduces a revolutionary concept vehicle that shows great promise in achieving eternal\n\xef\xac\x82ight capabilities.

Low disk loading,\nlarge swept areas, and a stationary hub, make this\nattractive for several di\xef\xac\x80erent types of projects.\n\n1.1\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nSatellites have fundamentally changed our lives, providing dramatic improvements to our quality of life\nthat could have been accomplished in no other way.\nNew research e\xef\xac\x80orts are attempting to satiate demand for increased capabilities, but no existing platform has fully achieved eternal \xef\xac\x82ight. This research\npresents a novel alternative approach, which exceeds\nexisting capabilities, outpaces current research efforts, and may be the answer to attain eternal \xef\xac\x82ight.\n\n1.1.1\n\nExisting and Future Demand\n\nOver the past 50 years, satellites provided worldwide\ntelecommunications to connect the world, geopositional navigation to permit precise location determination, and imaging and sensor systems that have\nlet us develop a depth of understanding of our planet\nas well as the entire universe. While incredibly expensive, and by far the most expensive aerospace\nproducts on a dollar per pound basis, their unique\nability to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of the world\xe2\x80\x9d\nalso provides productivity that is di\xef\xac\x83cult to match.\nYet there is need for even greater capabilities,\nand at lower costs. Society has developed an increased appetite for omnipresent communications\nand surveillance capabilities, but with the added desire for these services to be achievable in real-time as\non-demand services. These new capabilities are not\nwell met by existing satellites, but instead require a\nnew solution that can achieve several orders of magnitude lower signal latency, with greater operational\n\xef\xac\x82exibility, while at dramatically lower cost.\n\n2\n\n1.1.2\n\nPresent Research E\xef\xac\x80orts\n\nThe question this study asks is whether a new form\nof satellites is possible, and proposes a unique advanced concept approach which has never been previously explored. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites\nare about 50x closer than Geosynchronous (GEO)\nsatellites; Atmospheric Satellites (AT-Sats) are another 50x closer than LEO satellites.\nAT-Sats are aerial platforms that operate at altitudes of around 60,000 feet where air density and\nwinds aloft o\xef\xac\x80er the operating conditions requiring\nthe lowest power without weather concerns. Several\nconcept approaches have been developed over the\npast decade through e\xef\xac\x80orts such as DARPA Vulture\nand ISIS. Each of these DARPA programs exceeded\n$150 million, and had the intent of achieving a largescale \xef\xac\x82ight demonstrator. Vulture researched High\nAltitude Long Endurance (HALE) \xef\xac\x81xed wing concepts that utilized ultra-lightweight structure techniques pioneered in Human Powered Aircraft (HPA).\nISIS researched HALE airships that use LighterThan-Air (LTA) structures and buoyant gases.\nBoth approaches applied advanced solar cells to\nprovide a renewable energy source with the objective of staying aloft for years at a time. Both of\nthese programs were cancelled due to lack of feasibility in closing the day-night energy balance required\nfor staying aloft without excessive altitude loss. Because of this, new concept approaches are desired\nthat can achieve lower cruise power requirements to\nremain airborne throughout the year, even at high\nlatitudes, while accommodating seasonal wind and\nsolar \xef\xac\x82ux variations.\n\n1.1.3\n\nAlternative Approach\n\nA novel vehicle concept approach was developed\nwith the objectives of achieving a 50% reduction\nin the structural mass while maintaining a robust\nstructural con\xef\xac\x81guration, as well as enabling a 33%\nincrease in the Lift to Drag ratio. The approach\nuses the tensegrity principle to attempt to put as\nmuch of the structural loads into tensile load paths,\nwhere advanced carbon composites provide incredible strength to weight, while minimizing compression load paths. The method to achieve this is to\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nrotate several wings around a stationary hub at very\nlarge diameters via a tether at quite low airspeeds,\nbut with a concentration of the large battery mass\nrequired for night energy storage at the outer extremities. The concept is called the Centrifugally\nSti\xef\xac\x80ened Rotor (CSR) because the resulting centrifugal forces applied to the tether and wing limit\nthe bending through in-plane sti\xef\xac\x80ening.\nThree rotor-wings rotating around the hub provide maximum concentration of centrifugal force,\nwith a minimum number of wings to form a stable\nplanar summation of forces and moments. Because\nof this structural sti\xef\xac\x80ening, wing aspect ratios (the\nratio of span to chord length) can be dramatically\nincreased while using thin airfoil sections to achieve\nextremely low levels of induced and parasite drag.\nTraditional rotors achieve poor aerodynamic e\xef\xac\x83ciency because of poor, triangular span loading due\nto a linearly decreasing velocity distribution across\nthe rotor that results in high induced drag. However with this concept, the large radius of rotation of\nthe rotor-wings with the tether comprising the inner\n80% enables the rotor-wings to achieve elliptic span\nloading. The tether takes advantage of advanced\naerospace grade compressed Spectra providing incredible strength to weight at small cross-sectional\ntether diameters that result in less than 10% of the\ndrag being associated with the tether.\nAerodynamic e\xef\xac\x83ciency is further increased by\ntaking advantage of a highly synergistic Outboard\nHorizontal Stabilizer (OHS) con\xef\xac\x81guration layout to\nachieve thrust instead of drag from the tail pitch\ntrim surface. Another favorable aerodynamic characteristic of the CSR concept is that since the outer\nrotor-wings are producing the lift and the inner hub\nis stationary, large payload volumes can be incorporated into the center hub without incurring drag\nfrom the \xe2\x80\x9ccruise speed\xe2\x80\x9d required for lift generation.\n\n1.1.4\n\nCSR Evaluation\n\nNew tools were required to analyze this concept since\nthis rotating multibody approach is far outside of existing aeronautic systems analysis tool capabilities.\nInitial performance and aerodynamic analysis results\nof the CSR concept indicate compelling advantages\nfor this approach in comparison to existing Vulture\n\n3\nHPA \xef\xac\x82ying wing solutions. LTA airships were not\ncompared because prior studies have shown those\napproaches are unable to provide station keeping capability for a large portion of the year due to winds\naloft, and the high parasite drag associated with the\nlarge volumes required at high altitude for buoyancy.\nWhile the CSR concept performance results are\ncompelling and indicate feasibility to achieve daynight energy balance, the key concept risk identi\xef\xac\x81ed early on is the ability to maintain control of the\nmultibody dynamics that are inherent in the design.\nTherefore, the majority of project scope focused on\nperforming detailed control modeling and simulation\nof the system with non-ideal, real world disturbances\nwhich introduce dynamic instabilities. The control\ne\xef\xac\x80orts are discussed in detail, as this is a very unique\nmultibody controls problem with methods developed\nthat can be applied to other problems of interest,\nsuch as asteroid capture with tethered systems.\nIn order to validate the developed control algorithms, a subscale prototype testing e\xef\xac\x80ort has been\ninitiated. The CSR subscale experiment will establish control feasibility, but was outside of the scope\nof this Phase I study and therefore is only outlined\nat the end of this report. The CSR controls e\xef\xac\x80ort\nhas led to a PhD topic by the lead control researcher,\nwhich will be completed in the following months as\npart of his \xef\xac\x81nal dissertation.\n\n1.2\n\nGoal of Eternal Flight\n\nA variety of existing satellites ful\xef\xac\x81ll di\xef\xac\x80erent technology roles. Corporations have shown a sincere desire\nto expand the realm of satellite capabilities, to meet\ntheir ever expanding needs.\n\n1.2.1\n\nTechnology Breakthroughs\n\nGoogle initiated a \xe2\x80\x9cSolve for X\xe2\x80\x9d conference in 2012\n(https://www.solveforx.com), to engage in radical\nmoonshot visions where Huge Problems intersect\nBreakthrough Technologies. Such ideas are already\nbeing developed in the little known Google-X Lab,\nand have started to achieve huge impacts in technology and mission areas that are critical to aerospace.\nThe Google \xe2\x80\x9cDriverless Car\xe2\x80\x9d is one of these\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nbreakthrough attempts to turn-on-it\xe2\x80\x99s-head the preconceived notions of what is not only possible, but\nwhat we will soon wonder how we ever lived without.\nGoogle has already achieved what critics said would\nbe a \xe2\x80\x98hard stop\xe2\x80\x99 to such idealistic visions by making\nrobotic cars legal in 4 states; with almost every auto\ncompany now mirroring their autonomy goals.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSolve for X\xe2\x80\x9d conference has many themes\ncongruent to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission; such as Cheaper Satellite Pictures, Low Power Broadband Wireless Everywhere, Inexpensive Renewable Energy, and Reversing\nClimate Change. What if an aerospace mission concept had the potential to achieve all these moonshot\ngoals? What if NASA could show the potential to\ndramatically impact many of the top national challenges with a single mission concept path and technology suite? How could this be possible...?\n\n1.2.2\n\nExpanding Needs\n\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst satellite was placed into orbit in 1957, and\nwithin 15 years satellites became highly capable platforms providing essential services through standardized satellite bus designs. Satellites have fundamentally changed our lives, providing dramatic improvements to our quality of life that could have been\naccomplished in no other way. Over the past 50\nyears, satellites provided worldwide telecommunications connecting the world, geopositional navigation\npermitting precise localization, and imaging and sensor systems that let us develop a depth of understanding of our planet as well as the entire universe.\nWhile incredibly expensive, and by far the most\nexpensive aerospace products on a dollar per pound\nbasis, their unique ability to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s eye\nview of the world\xe2\x80\x9d provides productivity that is dif\xef\xac\x81cult to match. Yet there is need for even greater capabilities, and at lower costs. Society has developed\nan increased appetite for omnipresent communications and surveillance capabilities, with the added\ndesire for these services to be achievable in real-time\nas on-demand services. These new capabilities are\nnot well met by existing satellites, but instead require a new solution that can achieve several orders\nof magnitude lower signal latency, with greater operational \xef\xac\x82exibility, while at dramatically lower cost.\n\n4\n\n1.2.3\n\nGeosynchronous Satellites\n\nGeosynchronous (GEO) satellites are able to remain\nover a \xef\xac\x81xed location above the Earth for continuous\nsurveillance or communication across a large coverage area because of their extreme distance. Because\nof their distance away from the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, a\nlong transmission delay (or signal latency) occurs.\nThis delay makes the use of GEO satellites for two\nway communications impractical; however, can provide a large, constant coverage area with one way\ncommunications with great e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness. Due to the\nlarge transmission distances, the power required is\nconsiderably increased due to power loss being inversely proportional to the transmission distance.\nWith such a broad coverage area, frequency reuse\nis extremely limited. Coverage at high latitude locations is challenging due to very low looking angles\nfrom the satellites, which increases signal obstruction and losses from building, trees and mountains.\n\n1.2.4\n\nLow Earth Orbit Satellites\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\ncloser proximity to Earth, with a decrease in coverage area, but lower signal latency. However, LEO\nsatellites are required to constantly orbit, and are\nunable to maintain a \xef\xac\x81xed reference location above\nthe Earth. This necessitates large \xef\xac\x82eets of LEO\nsatellites to maintain continuous coverage over any\nspeci\xef\xac\x81c location, with very high associated capital\ncosts for both the satellites and the cost to launch\nand insure the satellites. While the signal latency is\nreduced, it is still extremely challenging to use for\ntwo-way digital data transmission with an inability\nto achieve broadband speeds.\n\n1.2.5\n\nAtmospheric Satellites\n\nAtmospheric satellites (AT-Sats) are a new breed\nof aircraft that operate at altitudes around 60,000\nfeet, where air density and winds aloft o\xef\xac\x80er operating conditions that require the lowest power without\nweather concerns. AT-Sats operate over relatively\n\xef\xac\x81xed locations for continuous coverage with a single vehicle. Because of their proximity to Earth, the\nsignal latency is extremely low, along with the trans-\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nmission power required (enabling the entire payload\nto shrink in size). The coverage area is greatly reduced, essentially down to the size of a single urban\narea with the most direct lines of communication or\nthe size of several states for the full coverage area.\nSince the aircraft is able to takeo\xef\xac\x80 and land, the\ncost of deployment (and recovery) is very low, with\nthe added ability to upgrade and refurbish satellite\n\n5\npayloads as equipment ages. Likely the total system\ncosts of AT-Sats are several orders of magnitude less\nthan other satellite solutions, however current High\nAltitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft are only\nable to maintain \xef\xac\x82ight for several weeks at a time,\nand lack the ability to provide the highly reliable and\npersistent capabilities that satellites o\xef\xac\x80er.\n\nFigure 1.1: Existing GEO/LEO satellite orbit: height above Earth, period and speed.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

The orbits of existing satellites is depicted in Figure 1.1.\nGEO satellites o\xef\xac\x80er a continuous capability with\na single satellite, LEO o\xef\xac\x80ers 50x closer proximity for improved single latency, power requirements,\nand imaging resolution. AT-Sats o\xef\xac\x80er another 50x\ncloser proximity than LEO satellites for even better latency, power, and resolution; while also offering reusability and extremely low capital costs.\nThe summary in Table 1.1 provides a comparison\nbetween the di\xef\xac\x80erent varieties of satellites.\nReferring back to two of the highest priorities of\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSolve for X\xe2\x80\x9d challenges, Cheaper Satellite\nPictures and Low Power Broadband Wireless Everywhere; AT-Sats o\xef\xac\x80er an incredible match to these\ndesired goals. Just within the period of this Phase\nI study, both Google and Facebook have entered\ninto AT-Sat development, with each purchasing\naerospace companies focused on aircraft for this mission. Google purchased Titan Aerospace in April,\n2014 (http://techcrunch.com, 2014/04/14, Google\nAcquires Titan Aerospace, the Drone Company Pursued by Facebook ), with Facebook buying Ascenta\n(a spin-o\xef\xac\x80 of the QinetiQ Zephyr project) in March,\n\n2014 (http://www.theguardian.com, 2014/03/28,\nFacebook Buys UK Maker of Solar Powered Drones\nto Expand Internet).\nGoogle also initiated test \xef\xac\x82ights from their\nGoogle-X Lab Project Loon this year, which utilizes\na large network of balloons that drift with the winds\nwhile using limited directional control by changing\nthe buoyancy (and resulting altitude which have different wind speeds and directivity). The Project\nLoon approach is severely limited as it requires uncontrolled \xef\xac\x82ight over countries, and is therefore only\nbeing tested in the southern hemisphere. The balloons also only have a \xef\xac\x82ight duration of 50 to 100\ndays before requiring descent and payload pickup,\nwith the trajectories starting at the most southern\nlatitudes and spiraling their way eventually to the\nequator with the prevailing winds. Clearly these investments showcase the interest that exists in developing alternative platform solutions to satellites.\n\n1.3\n\nMission Objective\n\nSeveral research groups, both commercial and government sponsored, are attempting to design feasible\nAT-Sat solutions which achieve eternal \xef\xac\x82ight. The\nproblem reduces down to an energy balance relationship, where HPA techniques dominant the majority\nof current design paths.\n\n1.3.1\n\nProblem Decomposition\n\nThe basic problem of AT-Sats is decomposed into\nPower Required = Vehicle Drag x Flight Velocity.\nThus, to minimize the power required to remain\naloft, both the vehicle drag and \xef\xac\x82ight velocity need\nto be minimized.\nMinimizing drag means \xef\xac\x82ying at the highest\ncruise altitudes where the Lift to Drag (L/D) ratio is maximized. Altitudes where the air density\nis low, but not so low that there is insu\xef\xac\x83cient density to maintain \xef\xac\x82ight. High structural e\xef\xac\x83ciency is\nachieved with lightweight motors and system components, as well as with high e\xef\xac\x83ciency components\nthat experience the least energy losses.\nThe key determining factor for vehicle feasibility\nis based on achieving Energy Collected in Daylight >\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nEnergy Expended During Night Operation + Energy\nto Maintain Flight. Maintaining this energy balance\nis most di\xef\xac\x83cult during the winter months at high\nlatitudes, where there is low solar \xef\xac\x82ux and low incidence angles on the solar cells. Wind velocities\nare minimized by operating at altitudes between 60\nand 70 thousand feet. However, even operating at\nthese altitudes, when considering greater than 99%\nof days, the winds aloft can reach 120 miles per hour.\n\n1.3.2\n\nHuman Powered Aircraft Approach\n\nConventional Human Powered Aircraft (HPA) concepts are able to achieve L/D ratios of about 35 at\noptimal aspect ratios of around 25. The aspect ratio\nis a dimensionless parameter that tracks the span to\nchord ratio of the wing and is de\xef\xac\x81ned as span squared\ndivided by the wing area. L/D is an e\xef\xac\x80ective metric\nfor tracking the overall aerodynamic e\xef\xac\x83ciency that\nincludes the parasite drag (skin friction drag associated with wetted area) and induced drag (both 2D\nand 3D pressure and vorticity drag sources resulting\nfrom creating lift).\nThe resulting payload mass fractions of the HPA\ninspired aircraft is less than 5%, with about 45% of\nthe mass required for the structure and about another 45% allocated for the propulsion system, all\nwhile using the most advanced solar cell and battery technologies. The growth factor (a dimensionless weight sensitivity parameter that compares the\nresulting increase in vehicle weight that results from\nincreasing the payload weight by one pound) of such\nconcepts are quite high, which is an indicator that\nthe feasible design space is quite restricted.\n\n1.3.3\n\nBest In Show\n\nThe current world record holder for High Altitude\nLong Endurance (HALE) \xef\xac\x82ight was set four years\nago by the QinetiQ Zephyr 7 aircraft. Figure 1.2\nillustrates this vehicle, along with the other concept approaches currently pursued. The Zephyr is\na HPA inspired structure that maintained high altitude \xef\xac\x82ight for a two week period in midsummer\nin New Mexico. The aircraft was 110 pounds, with\n\n7\na wing span of 74 feet, and had a wing loading of\nless than 1 pound per square foot. The payload was\nless than 5 pounds, and while the Zephyr achieved\n70,741 feet during \xef\xac\x82ight, it was not able to maintain altitude during night operation. Essentially, the\naircraft used its altitude as potential energy during\nnight operation, when energy was being used from\nthe batteries which had been stored from the solar\ncells during day light operation.\nAT-Sat operational products cannot utilize such\naltitude energy storing. Lower altitudes limit communication line of sight and weather e\xef\xac\x80ects impede\nthe ability to station keep. The Zephyr is highly re\xef\xac\x82ective of all the other aircraft concept approaches\ncurrently pursued and provides many indicators relating to future concept feasibility.\nThe Zephyr was only able to maintain \xef\xac\x82ight for\ntwo weeks because they used the most advanced\nlithium-sulfur batteries. The batteries were capable\nof about 530 Watt hours per kilogram, which is more\nthan twice the speci\xef\xac\x81c energy of any other lithium\nrechargeable batteries at that time. Lithium-sulfur\nchemistry only permits up to approximately 20\nrecharge cycles before seriously degrading their speci\xef\xac\x81c energy. Also, they are only capable of providing\nvery low power discharges rates below a 1 C rating,\nwhere C is the battery rating that relates to how\nquickly a battery can discharged in comparison to its\ncharge time, and a 1 C rating means the discharge\nrate can only be as high as the charging rate.\nBy far, the two largest mass fractions for the\nZephyr were the batteries and wing spar. Since HPA\nstructures have done everything possible to achieve\nultra-lightweight structures for conventional \xef\xac\x82ying\nwing con\xef\xac\x81gurations, the major focus for research\nprograms such as DARPA Vulture has been to optimize the energy system. These e\xef\xac\x80orts currently focus on high speci\xef\xac\x81c energy regenerative fuel cells (energy storage) and high e\xef\xac\x83ciency/lightweight solar\ncells (energy capture). The Zephyr project has just\nrecently been purchased by Airbus (http://defenseupdate.com, 2014/04/25, Airbus Invites Partners\nto Test Mission Payloads with Zephyr 8 \xe2\x80\x98PseudoSatellite\xe2\x80\x99 ) and a new Zephyr 8 is under development\nas a follow-up next generation airframe.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n8\n\nFigure 1.2: Current HALE AT-Sat approaches under development.\n\n1.3.4\n\nDARPA Concepts\n\nSeveral concept approaches have been developed\nover the past decade through e\xef\xac\x80orts such as DARPA\nVulture and ISIS. Each of these DARPA programs\nexceeded $150 million, and intended to achieve a\nlarge-scale \xef\xac\x82ight demonstrator.\nVulture researched HALE \xef\xac\x81xed wing concepts\nthat utilized ultra-lightweight structure techniques\npioneered in HPA, where concepts follow design and\nconstruction techniques pioneered by Paul Macready\nwith the Gossamer Albatross 35 years ago. The aircraft have very low wing loading which provides substantial surface areas for solar cells, and minimizes\nthe cruise velocity and required power. The structures are extremely delicate with Mylar surfaces for\nmuch of the wing surface, but they still have huge\nroot bending moments absorbed through these thin\nwings. This approach results is a relatively small\npayload and has great sensitivity to winds.\nISIS researched HALE airships that use LighterThan-Air (LTA) structures. LTA concepts utilize\n\nenormous hydrogen/helium \xef\xac\x81lled vehicles to achieve\na di\xef\xac\x80erence in buoyancy between the internal volume, and the already very low density air at high\naltitudes. Such large volumes require equally large\nsurface areas. If winds aloft could be ignored, such\napproaches would be ideal. However during the majority of the yearly seasons, and at the majority of\nlatitudes, LTA approaches yield such high drag that\nthe power requirements at even modest winds exceed\na feasible solution.\nBoth approaches applied advanced solar cells to\nprovide a renewable energy source with the objective of staying aloft for years at a time. Both of\nthese programs were canceled due to lack of feasibility in closing the day-night energy balance required\nfor staying aloft without excessive altitude loss. Because of this, new concept approaches are desired\nthat can achieve lower \xe2\x80\x98cruise\xe2\x80\x99 power requirements to\nremain airborne throughout the year, even at high\nlatitudes, while accommodating seasonal wind and\nsolar \xef\xac\x82ux variations.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.3.5\n\nCommercial Concepts\n\nClearly a great deal of momentum and interest is\nbuilding in AT-Sat vehicle development, with a focus\nby all (except the Google Loon Project) on conventional HPA conventional wing con\xef\xac\x81gurations. Several variants of wing-tail con\xef\xac\x81gurations are shown in\nFigure ??, but each concept maintains a highly similar HPA structural approach while span-loading the\nvehicle weight across the span as much as possible\nto decrease the wing bending moments.\nLockheed utilizes a bottom strut across the fuselage element to achieve greater e\xef\xac\x80ective wing spar\ndepth; however, without trussing between the fuselage elements this approach does not provide signi\xef\xac\x81cant improvement. Furthermore, wire crisscross-\n\n9\ning trusses between each fuselage element at \xef\xac\x82ight\nspeeds would dramatically increase drag.\nAurora utilized a combinatory Z-wing arrangement. Each wing element would dock together in\n\xef\xac\x82ight with a hinge element that does not transmit\nbending moments. Also, each wing element would\n\xef\xac\x82y at inclination angles better suited to capture the\nsolar \xef\xac\x82ux for energy storage.\nBoeing utilized an Outboard Horizontal Surface\n(OHS) to minimize the induced drag and augment\nthe pitch trimming capability. Only Boeing was selected for the Phase II DARPA Vulture program.\nHowever, after detailed studies, this concept showed\nquestionable feasibility and was descoped into a focused e\xef\xac\x80ort to advance the energy storage and capture technologies.\n\nFigure 1.3: Pareto sensitivity frontier of energy required compared to energy available.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.4\n\nTechnical Challenge\n\nA number of improved technologies are required to\nachieve feasible AT-Sat operational capability. Key\nadvances are required to increase reliability, decrease\npayload weight, and expand current energy collection and capture e\xef\xac\x83ciency.\n\n1.4.1\n\nSystem Reliability\n\nOne such topic area includes achieving satellite-like\nreliability. Enabling continuous \xef\xac\x82ight for a year or\nmore requires con\xef\xac\x81dence across all aircraft components. This reliability must be accomplished in all\nsystems including: energy storage, control surface\nactuators, \xef\xac\x82ight control avionics, and sensors that\nprovide an autonomous \xef\xac\x82ight capability.\n\n1.4.2\n\nLight Weight Antennas\n\n10\nsystem and the solar cell e\xef\xac\x83ciency. The infeasibility\nof this mission concept at current technology levels\nis clearly seen with only about 34% energy available\nversus energy required for accomplishing a day/night\ncycle on the worst winter day.\nCurrently, lightweight thin-\xef\xac\x81lm solar cells are at\n32% e\xef\xac\x83ciency (Micro Link Devices) and the best\nlithium rechargeable batteries that are capable of at\nleast 365 cycles (one year of operation for an ATSat) are nearly 280 Whr/kg (Panasonic/NCR cells\nwith the 18650 form factor).\nIf energy storage and solar cell technology are the\nonly improvements provided for future AT-Sat vehicles, the required feasibility to achieve a 100% energy\nbalance requires battery speci\xef\xac\x81c energies greater\nthan 1000 Whr/kg and solar cells that exceed 75%\ne\xef\xac\x83ciency. Therefore, it is highly desirable to not\nonly focus technology development e\xef\xac\x80orts on improved energy, but also on a new concept approach\nthat could dramatically lessen the energy required\nfor sustained high altitude \xef\xac\x82ight.\n\nAnother technology area includes ultra-lightweight\nantenna systems.

INTRODUCTION\nenergy, along with the potential to transmit electricity through the tether to the props depending on\nwhether a more complex tether is warranted in case\nthe optimal wing-rotor sizing does not permit su\xef\xac\x83cient solar cell area for propulsion purposes. However, a conductive tether is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly larger diameter and results in higher tether drag and weight.\nThe hub has structural arms where each tether\nextends from the center section to provide rotation\nrate stability across each rotor-wing-body component. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally if one rotor-wing gets ahead of\nthe others, a restoring angular force will be induced\nthat slows that wing, while an angular force is induced on the other rotor-wings that accelerate the\nother rotor-wings that are lagging behind. These\nstructural arms hold the tether, and act as \xe2\x80\x99whips\xe2\x80\x99\nto induce these stabilizing rotational forces across\nthe entire wing/rotor system. While independent\nthrust at each rotor-wing permits di\xef\xac\x80erential spacing\nof the elements, the tether structural whips provide\na mechanism for incurring a stabilizing force across\nthe system of elements.\n\n1.5.3\n\nTethers\n\nThe tethers connect the rotor-wings to the center\nhub.

This is ideally suited for\nadvanced composite and braided materials designed\nspeci\xef\xac\x81cally for high tensile strength, like Spectra.\nThe tether can be reeled in to achieve a compact\ncon\xef\xac\x81guration for takeo\xef\xac\x80 and landing. But this con\xef\xac\x81guration requires signi\xef\xac\x81cantly more power due to\nthe higher velocities needed to maintain lift and from\nthe non-optimal triangular lift loading distribution\nacross each wing.\nIn \xef\xac\x82ight, the tether is reeled out to provide a\ndramatically larger radius, which results in a toroid\nlift area and an optimal elliptical lift loading distribution across each wing. The amount of area the\nrotor-wing traverses is the e\xef\xac\x80ective disc loading of\nthe vehicle and determines the power required. The\ntether comprises the inner 70 to 80% of the total diameter when in \xef\xac\x82ight, depending of the optimized\nwing sizing for di\xef\xac\x80erent mission needs. The tether is\nat a slower velocity than the rotor-wing, where the\naverage tether velocity is only 35-40% of the rotor-\n\n13\nwing speed. This means that only about 5 to 10% of\nthe total drag of the vehicle comes from the tether.\nFor example, a 0.03\xe2\x80\x9d diameter compressed aerospace\ngrade Spectra has a tensile strength of 200 pounds.\n\n1.6\n\nCSR Feasibility Analysis\n\nHaving described the general concept of the CSR vehicle, the next task describes the feasibility of this\nsystem achieving eternal \xef\xac\x82ight. This section describes the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of centrifugal sti\xef\xac\x80ening, and how\nthe CSR achieves high L/D ratios while minimizing\nparasitic drag. It compares this concept with the\nleading competitors, and illustrates the distinct advantages this concept o\xef\xac\x80ers.\n\n1.6.1\n\nBene\xef\xac\x81ts of Centrifugal Sti\xef\xac\x80ening\n\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst goal of the CSR concept is to achieve a\nlarge reduction in the wing spar mass fraction of the\ntotal vehicle mass, which increases the structural ef\xef\xac\x81ciency. Another objective is to increase the Lift\nto Drag ratio, which increases the aerodynamic e\xef\xac\x83ciency of the HALE aircraft. These goals are primarily required for station keeping missions. The CSR\nsystem achieves these goals through centrifugal sti\xef\xac\x80ening, just as a helicopter rotor uses CF which allows\nextremely high aspect ratio blades while using very\nlightweight rotors.\nMost rotorcraft blades have aspect ratios of 30\nto 50, but the majority aircraft rarely exceed an aspect ratio of 10, due to the high resulting weight of\nthe wing and aeroelastic constraints. Rotor blades,\nwhich develop all the lift of a helicopter, typically\nweigh only 2 to 3% of the gross helicopter weight.\nCompare that to aircraft wings which are typically\n10 to 20% of the gross aircraft weight. HALE aircraft experience a similar wing weight mass fraction\nof 40 to 50% of the total aircraft mass. Clearly centrifugal sti\xef\xac\x80ening of high aspect ratio rotors-wings\nis a highly e\xef\xac\x80ective method of taking lifting surfaces\nto signi\xef\xac\x81cantly greater aspect ratios, while achieving\nvery low lifting surface weight.\nWhile rotor blades use high tip speeds (600 to\n850 ft/sec) to achieve high radial accelerations, centrifugal forces can also be achieved at relatively low\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n14\n\nFigure 1.5: Lift load distribution on CSR concept versus conventional wing con\xef\xac\x81guration.\n\ntip speeds by having a large mass at the rotor outer\nmost tip location. Slowed rotor concepts such as\nthe CarterCopter use depleted uranium at the rotor\ntips to maintain rotor blade sti\xef\xac\x80ness at low rotational speeds. The centrifugal force in rotor blades\nresults in the wing spar material being very small\nto counteract the rotor lift root bending moment.\nHelicopter rotors experience 1000\xe2\x80\x99s of g\xe2\x80\x99s of acceleration, while the CSR rotor-wing needs only about 2\ng\xe2\x80\x99s in combination with the large tip mass to provide\nsu\xef\xac\x83cient sti\xef\xac\x80ening for minimal bending.\nThe CSR provides a tensegrity structure approach to achieve high aspect ratios instead of HPA\nstructures which depend on large wing chords to provide a thick structural spar depth. Spreadsheet and\nMatlab analysis methods were developed to provide\na summation of forces and determination of tensile\nforces across the wing and tether. This method was\n\xef\xac\x81rst applied to existing HALE conventional wing\nstructures to validate the ability of the method to\ncapture accurate mass trends, and then applied to\nthe CSR structure.\nFigure 1.5 shows the lift load distribution on the\nCSR concept versus a conventional wing con\xef\xac\x81guration showing the distribution of forces and the ability of the rotor-wing elements to pivot at the tether\nconnection to alleviate a root bending moment. The\n\nNASA/AeroVironment Helios is shown as an example of HALE aircraft experiencing very high bending\nmoments over large wing spans. The Helios failed\nduring a test \xef\xac\x82ight because the wing \xef\xac\x82uttered due\nto a lack of structural sti\xef\xac\x80ness.\n\n1.6.2\n\nAchieving High Lift To Drag Ratios\n\nAn objective of the CSR design uses the high aspect\nratio rotor-wing to achieve high L/D ratios. Helicopter rotors achieve poor lift e\xef\xac\x83ciency because their\nlift is developed over the entire diameter. This results in a triangular load distribution with almost\nthe entire lift generated by the outer 25% of the\nrotor blade. Achieving low induced drag depends\non achieving an elliptic load distribution across the\nlifting surface. Helicopter rotors have high induced\ndrag, because they do not achieve an elliptic loading.\nHelicopter rotors also experience high induced\ndrag because each rotor acts in close proximity to\nthe downwash of the blade rotating in front of it,\nwhich increases the angle of attack required for lift\ngeneration. Instead, the CSR concept has each satellite operating in a downwash \xef\xac\x81eld independent of the\nother rotor-wings due to the large spatial separation.\nAn e\xef\xac\x80ective way of visualizing the resulting reduction in downwash induced drag is to consider things\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nfrom a rotor disc loading perspective, as seen in Figure 1.6. The CSR concept achieves a downwash \xef\xac\x81eld\nin the shape of a toroid of the traversed rotational\nrotor-wings based on the extremely large tether diameters. A conventional rotor with 20 foot radius\nachieves a swept disc area of 1256 square feet, while\nthe same 20 foot radius with an 80 foot tether traverses a swept area of 11,304 square feet. This is\nfar greater than that of the span of the rotor-wing\nalone. The total rotor disc area relates directly to\nthe induced drag.\nIn addition, a conventional helicopter rotor has\na triangular lift distribution with poor aerodynamic\ne\xef\xac\x83ciency. However, the tethered rotor-wing achieves\nan ideal elliptical load distribution because the entire satellite has a relatively constant velocity \xef\xac\x81eld.\nThere is approximately 20% variation in air\xef\xac\x82ow velocity, which can be made elliptic through a modest\ntwist and taper distribution across the rotor-wing.\nThe \xef\xac\x81nal method for minimizing induced drag uses\nthe same Outboard Horizontal Stabilizer (OHS) layout used by the Boeing Vulture concept, which was\noriginally developed by the WW II Blohm and Voss\naircraft concept, and with application as recently as\nby Scaled Composites Spaceship One.\n\nFigure 1.6: Simpli\xef\xac\x81ed traversed rotor disc area.\n\n15\n\n1.6.3\n\nMinimizing Parasitic Drag\n\nWhile the resulting low induced drag of the CSR\nrotor-wing is critical, operation at the maximum\nL/D requires that equal portions of induced and parasite drag are achieved in balance. Therefore, it is\nalso important to provide a mechanism for lower\nparasite (skin friction) drag. This is accomplished\nin two ways with the CSR concept, which are illustrated in Figure 1.7.\nConventional HALE concepts require that payload volumes move at the same speed as the rest of\nthe vehicle. For bulky antenna or optic payloads this\ncan result in substantial parasite drag. The payload\nfor the CSR concept remains stationary at the hub,\nwhich is independent of the required lift generation.\nThe size of the satellite is minimal due to the high\ndensity of the enclosed components (electric motor\nand batteries).\nAnother mechanism of achieving lower parasite\ndrag comes from the rotor-wings having low thickness to chord (t/c) ratios, because of the low resulting bending moments of the centrifugally sti\xef\xac\x80ened\nstructure. The use of low t/c airfoils is important\nfor HALE aircraft operating at low Reynolds number. This condition maintains laminar \xef\xac\x82ow for much\nof the airfoil while insuring that laminar separation\ndoes not occur.\nAt \xef\xac\x81rst glance the tether drag may appear to\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cantly increase the parasite drag. The nondimensional cross-sectional Coe\xef\xac\x83cient of Drag (CD)\nof a cylindrical cable is extremely high (around 1.15\ncompared to a typical airfoil of .01). As the tether diameter increases with larger scale vehicles, the CD of\nthe tether improves through braided cross-sections.\nThese have improved separation characteristics that\nachieve CD\xe2\x80\x99s of about 0.75.\nThe tether cable diameter is able to be small because it is extremely structurally e\xef\xac\x83cient at carrying\ntensile loads. Combined with the fact that the average tether speed is only 40% of the rotor-wing tip\nspeed, the resulting tether drag is only 5 to 10% of\nthe total vehicle drag. Of course, these values depend on the amount of centrifugal tensile load that\nsizes the tether diameter and whether the tether is\ndesigned to conduct electricity for energy sharing\nacross the payload hub and the rotor-wing elements.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n16\n\nFigure 1.7: CSR aerodynamic loading versus conventional helicopter rotor.\nA factor of safety of 6 was applied to the tether\ntensile load to insure reasonable tether cable diameter. Spectra o\xef\xac\x80ers a good match to CSR requirements due to low stretching of about 1%. Spreadsheet and Matlab methods were assembled for calculating the parasite and induced drag of the CSR\nconcept using a blade element aerodynamic analysis.\n\n1.6.4\n\nCSR Comparisons\n\nThe prior mass, force balance, and drag methods\nwere combined along with methods to determine the\npower required for maintaining \xef\xac\x82ight. The results of\nthese analyses are presented within Table 1.2 across\nseveral payload sizes ranging from sUAS to full satellite equivalent payloads. The vehicle characteristics\nshown are not optimized, but merely a result of simple sizing sensitivities to yield reasonable con\xef\xac\x81gurations. A useful tracking metric to compare the CSR\nconcept results to other approaches is the power required per vehicle pound to maintain \xef\xac\x82ight.\nAn interesting comparison reference to the CSR\n\nconcept is the recent successful winner of the Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter prize (the Aerovelo\nAtlas), which lifted a total mass of 281 lbf (121 lbf vehicle plus 160 lbf pilot) for 64 seconds with a human\npower output of almost 750 watts (2.67 watts/lbf).\nThis was accomplished with a total rotor lift area of\n13,700 ft, that had 4 rotors comprising a total of 156\nft diameter, and an incredibly lightweight and \xef\xac\x82imsy\nstructure that provided no design to ultimate load\nor safety margins.\nA total safety margin over the design load of\n3 was utilized for sizing the CSR structure, with\nthe resulting speci\xef\xac\x81c power required being somewhat\nhigher across all vehicle sizes than that required by\nthe Atlas. At a similar vehicle weight the CSR concept is able to achieve around 3.5 watts/lbf. As another comparison, the Zephyr 7 is calculated to use\napproximately 550 watts at cruise for the 110 lbf\nvehicle, yielding a power required per pound of 5\nwatts/lbf, which is 45% more power than required\nfor a CSR concept at a similar mass.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

The improvement in drag and weight are\nthe critical concept performance ingredients for this\nmission concept to achieve feasibility.\nApplying these improvements potentially enabled by the CSR concept provide a basis for achieving a day/night energy balance while using near-\n\nterm rechargeable batteries with speci\xef\xac\x81c energy of\n400 Whr/kg, and thin \xef\xac\x81lm solar cells with thin\xef\xac\x81lm e\xef\xac\x83ciency of 35%.

INTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nFigure 1.9: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) and coastal ocean observatory platforms.\n\n1.7.1\n\nAirborne Wind Energy\n\nA number of companies are currently investigating\nAirborne Wind Energy (AWE) production through\naerial platforms. These systems harness the wind at\naltitudes where the winds are faster, the turbulence\nis lower, and the winds are more consistently available. Such systems require a tethered connection to\nthe ground to harness wind energy, otherwise they\nwould simply be blown downwind.\nCompanies such as Makani (purchased by Google\nthis past year) are developing concepts as shown in\nFigure 1.9. Small aircraft are \xef\xac\x82own in circles, acting\nas the tip of a ground-based horizontal wind turbine,\nsince the tips are performing >75% of the energy\ncapture. The FAA ground obstruction rules enable\nsuch tethered platforms to be operated at altitudes\nas high as 2000 feet. With the Makani approach, the\nentire tether length is moving at the aircraft velocity, which is typically 200 to 300 ft/sec, resulting in\nhigh tether drag. Energy is extracted by propellers\non the aircraft that act as turbines turning electric\n\nalternators, which then transmit the energy down\nthe tether to the ground.\nBecause the tether connects the aircraft to the\nground, the tether orientation to the aircraft is 90\ndegrees to each other so that the tether imparts a\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant bending load on the wing. If the CSR concept were used in place of the conventional Makani\naircraft concept, the ground tether would connect to\nthe stationary CSR center hub and not experience\na velocity or drag. The resulting drag of the system would be much less, and permit smaller land\nuse as decreased tether angles to the horizon are accomplished. In addition, the CSR approach would\nmaintain the ability to keep the rotating tether between the hub and rotor-wings along the span path\nto achieve a lighter weight solution.\nMakani has already accomplished testing at the\n10 to 50 kW scale in Hawaii, which has very high\ncosts of electricity due to this coming from oil based\nenergy production. In time, it may be proven that\nlower cost power can be achieved, but currently with\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nthese smaller early adopter systems, the cost of energy is quite high, especially when land use costs are\nconsidered. If these AWE platforms were able to be\npositioned in locations where the platforms could act\nas multi-functional surveillance/communications as\nwell as AWE energy harvesters, there would be the\nability to lower the e\xef\xac\x80ective costs.\nIf a CSR platform was operated at 2000 feet,\nthe communication transmission coverage diameter\nwould be nearly 50 miles. The CSR platform could\nact as a cell phone tower or WiFi provider with a\ncommunication payload in the center hub. The visibility of the CSR platform would be far less than the\nalternatives of a tower or ground-based wind turbine.\nThe CSR concept achieves a higher Lift/Drag ratio compared to other airborne wind concepts, which\nresults in higher tether angles and less land area\nunder the vehicle radius of operation that depends\non incoming wind direction. O\xef\xac\x80-shore application\nis particularly appealing since a CSR aerial vehicle\nwould eliminate large and expensive mooring platform, which is required for ground-based wind tur-\n\n20\nbines. Ground-based wind turbines experience huge\nbending moments in the tower structure and require\nmassive concrete pads, while an AWE transmits no\nbending moment down the tether.\nO\xef\xac\x80-shore also provides signi\xef\xac\x81cant dual-use market opportunities. The \xef\xac\x81rst long-term civil use of a\nUAV was recently approved in Australia to \xef\xac\x82y along\nthe coastline as a shark spotting platform. This\nwas performed previously by small aircraft operating with two people on board, the potential cost savings are considerable. A series of o\xef\xac\x80-shore CSR platforms could be performing a combination of energy\nharvesting, distressed swimmer surveillance and Wi\xef\xac\x81\nfrom each platform with very lightweight payloads.\nWhile such applications may be considered niche\nmarkets, hundreds of thousands of lifeguards in the\nworld monitor coastal waters. Potentially there are\neven larger markets for this mission concept as it is\napplied to distributed residential power production,\nwith a sUAS sized version likely capable of providing 2 to 5 kW of power at altitudes of 500 feet with\naverage wind speeds of less than 20 mph.\n\nFigure 1.10: Distributed aperture atmospheric satellite observatory mission concept.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nFigure 1.11: Ultra low power, compact VTOL Mars Explorer mission concept.\n\n1.7.2\n\nAT-Sat Observatory\n\nThe CSR concept provides a large rotating structure, as well as large volume at the center hub, with\nthe capability of operation above the majority of the\natmosphere. Integrating high resolution, compact,\nlinked optic sensors (such as the Low Mass Planar\nPhotonic Imaging Sensor currently being developed\nas Phase II NIAC research) at the tip and root of\neach rotor-wing will permit a rotating imaging array\nacross a full 600 diameter azimuth. Combining this\nwith a lower resolution conventional imaging system\nin the center hub for image \xef\xac\x81lling could provide a\nresolution never before possible. Such an observatory could be designed as a dual-purpose system that\nprovides imaging both upwards for space investigations, as well as for Earth imaging. A depiction of\nthe device is shown in Figure 1.10.\n\n1.7.3\n\nCompact VTOL Vehicle\n\nA version of the CSR concept has been identi\xef\xac\x81ed\nthat enables full retraction of the rotor-wing, shown\nin Figure 1.11 to achieve a highly compact VTOL\nvehicle that can operate at extremely low discloading (<0.03 lb/ft2) on atmospheres such as Mars\nthat have atmospheric densities similar to Earth at\n\n100,000 feet altitude. Because it was highly uncertain whether the centrifugal sti\xef\xac\x80ening loads would\nbe su\xef\xac\x83cient to maintain a rigid rotor-wing for this\nhighly faceted spanwise design, a sub-scale version\nof the fully retracting rotor-wing was fabricated and\ntested with success. The rotor-wing experiences\nan increase in weight and complexity with a decrement in performance to achieve compact packaging, however was shown to be a feasible approach\nthat could facilitate very low discloading renewable\nVTOL aerial vehicles which could be packaged e\xef\xac\x80ectively in an aeroshell.\n\n1.7.4\n\nNon-Commercial Applications\n\nA large number of other missions exists for the CSR\nconcept with most relating to HALE missions on\nEarth. A comprehensive list is provided in Figure\n1.12. While clearly Facebook and Google will become major investors in this technology area due to\nthe civil mission application potential, it is interesting to note how many Earth Science and Government Service mission are also of high importance to\nour societal needs. Because of this, it seems important that government research institutions such as\nNASA help to establish feasible HALE platforms,\nwhich can focus on non-commercial services.\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nFigure 1.12: HALE missions that relate to CSR concept use.\n\n22\n\nChapter 2\n\nPlant Development\nThis chapter expands the preliminary analysis performed on the CSR vehicle, and develops the\nplant model required for the controls development. It presents how the system is modeled and\nderives the equations of motion of the vehicle. These dynamics are implemented in a multibody dynamics structure which governs the CSR simulations. Finally, the nonlinear system is\ntrimmed and linearized which is the starting point for the controller development.\n\n\xef\xac\x81nding trimmed control inputs, and obtaining a linearized model of the system is a crucial step towards\nThe CSR concept vehicle is a radical departure beginning the controls analysis.\nfrom conventional \xef\xac\x81xed-wing and rotor craft design\nmethodology, but this concept o\xef\xac\x80ers greater \xef\xac\x82ight\nObjectives\ncapabilities by combining the best features of both\n\xef\xac\x81xed-wing and rotor craft designs.

Di\xef\xac\x80erMotivation\n\nProof of concept is demonstrated through scaled\nprototypes. Before developing the prototypes and\nfull scale vehicle, simulation and analysis are required to gain a better insight into how the system\nbehaves. Before starting the controls analysis the\nsystem needs to be linearized so that control theory\ncan be applied, and prior to linearizing the model,\na set of initial conditions must be identi\xef\xac\x81ed which\nput the system in a steady-state equilibrium condition. Developing the equations of motion (EOM),\n\nent vehicle geometries at various scales are evaluated, so the models must be general enough to accommodate alternate con\xef\xac\x81gurations. Parameter \xef\xac\x81les\nare used to store the vehicle geometry and physical\nattributes, so various designs can be evaluated by\nsimply changing the parameter \xef\xac\x81les.\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst objective de\xef\xac\x81nes the system, develops\nthe equations of motion (EOM), and implements\nthe simulation of the CSR system. The system is\nreduced to a collection individual subcomponents.\n\n23\n\nCHAPTER 2. PLANT DEVELOPMENT\nEach component has a description, some physical\nparameters, and a coordinate frame. As the vehicle\nmoves through space, various forces and moments\nact on these components. These external forces and\nmoments are calculated for each individual entity at\ntheir current state, and then summed together to\nprovide the total force and moment acting on that\nrigid body. All the relationships between components are compiled into a multibody dynamics structure, which implements the numerical routine responsible for the nonlinear simulation.\nThe next goal of this chapter takes the developed\nCSR dynamics, and expresses those relationships in\na form suitable for control analysis. Before applying\ncontrols, the system must operate in a steady-state\nequilibrium point, such as hover. Trimming is the\nprocess of \xef\xac\x81nding states and control inputs which\nattain a particular equilibrium point. The trimming\nroutine takes an educated guess value for the system\ninitial conditions, and then optimizes a force balance\nequality for the lift generated by the system. Once\nthe vehicle is trimmed, a linearization routine takes\nthe nonlinear equations of motion and determines\nthe state space matrices used for control analysis.\nOutline\nBefore undertaking any of the controls development\nfor the CSR system, a complete and accurate description of the vehicle is required. This chapter develops all aspects of the physical plant used during\nthe design and analysis process.\nSection 2.1 addresses Modeling, which illustrates\nthe main features of the CSR vehicle, then decomposes the system into individual components for the\nhub, tether, and satellite. It describes the physical\nproperties of all the components, and assigns coor-\n\n24\ndinate frames used during the modeling process.\nSection 2.2 derives the Dynamics of the CSR system. These are the mathematical relationships that\ndescribe the equations of motion of the vehicle. It\nidenti\xef\xac\x81es all the pertinent forces and moments acting on each component, and uses \xef\xac\x81rst principles to\nobtain those force and moment values. Finally, it\npresents a parallel CFD analysis which models the\naerodynamics of the satellite body.\nSection 2.3 implements the Simulation that models the vehicle within the Matlab environment. It\nformulates a multibody dynamics structure based on\na numerical routine, presents a generalized approach\nto implement the routine, and applies the theory to\nthe CSR models.\nSection 2.4 address Trimming the vehicle. This\nprocess seeks to obtain the set of states and control inputs that achieve hover. While the CSR is in\nhover, the system is in a steady-state static equilibrium condition, which is the starting point for linearization and controls development.\nSection 2.5 performs Linearization on the system. It takes the nonlinear system dynamics and\nyields linear relationships around the hover condition. The values of the partial derivatives populate\nthe state space matrices used for controls analysis.\n\n2.1\n\nModeling\n\nModeling the CSR system is the \xef\xac\x81rst step towards\nderiving the system dynamics, building the simulations, and developing the control analysis. This\nsection presents the overall vehicle structure, describes the individual components, introduces coordinate frames, and illustrates the forces present on\neach component.\n\nFigure 2.1: Complete Centrifugally Sti\xef\xac\x80ened Rotor (CSR) system.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Because the\nsystem is in a constant state of rotation, there is a\nnonuniform freestream velocity over the wing. The\ntapered twit geometry was designed to provide an\noptimized elliptical lift distribution over the lifting\nsurface.

The lift 2.2.6 CFD Aerodynamic Model\nand drag functions are depicted in Figure 2.10.\nSatellite aerodynamics account for the largest contribution towards the CSR equations of motion, so a\nhigh \xef\xac\x81delity aerodynamic model is desired to accurately simulate the vehicle dynamics. The \xef\xac\x81rst approach for modeling the satellite relied on \xef\xac\x81rst principles that govern rigid bodies and lifting surfaces. A\nparallel e\xef\xac\x80ort models the satellite vehicle using computational \xef\xac\x82uid dynamic (CFD) techniques. The following sections describe the software, how the satellite is modeled, the operation point, and the look-up\ntable used within the Matlab simulation.\nFigure 2.10: Lift and drag pro\xef\xac\x81le curves.\n\nAerodynamic Surfaces\nThe \xef\xac\x81ve surfaces on the satellite include the wing,\nhorizontal stabilizer with an elevator, and vertical\nstabilizer with a rudder. Each surface has its own lift\nand drag pro\xef\xac\x81le to accurately represent each component. The satellite moves through the inertial frame\nwith a known velocity. Accounting for wind within\nthe simulation, yields an airspeed expressed in the\ninertial frame. The attitude of the satellite forms\na rotation matrix that converts the airspeed vector\nto the local satellite frame. For each surface, the\nthe airspeed vector is projected onto a plane parallel\nwith the cross section of the surface. This projection\nyields the relative angle of attack and the magnitude\nof the air\xef\xac\x82ow over the surface. The relative angle of\nattack is fed into the lift and drag pro\xef\xac\x81le function,\nwhich returns the lift and drag coe\xef\xac\x83cients (cL , cD )\nfor that particular angle and surface. The magnitude of the airspeed v, together with cL or cD , are\npassed into (2.4) which yields the magnitudes of the\nlift force and drag force. These magnitudes are converted into vectors where the drag force acts parallel\nto the air\xef\xac\x82ow, and the lift force acts perpendicular\nto the air\xef\xac\x82ow. The force vectors act at the quarter chord of the wing surface, and at the geometric\ncenter for all other surfaces. Each surface has a position vector pointing from the CG of the satellite to\nthe point where the aerodynamic force acts. Then\nindividual moments are calculated with (2.1).\n\nAthena Vortex Lattice\nSatellite aerodynamics are obtained with Athena\nVortex Lattice (AVL) software. The AVL program\nperforms aerodynamic analysis on rigid aircraft with\narbitrary con\xef\xac\x81gurations. It employs an extended lattice vortex model for the lifting surfaces and a slender body model for the fuselage. The software starts\nwith the nonlinear system and generates a full linearization around any \xef\xac\x82ight condition. The satellite is parsed into surfaces and fuselage components,\nwhich are input into the AVL program. Surfaces are\nmodeled as a series of attached sections, where each\nsection is described by a chord, leading edge location, airfoil, and pitch angle. Control surfaces have\nadditional parameters which include a gain, hinge\nlocation, hinge vector, and sign of de\xef\xac\x82ection. Coordinates of the top and bottom edges de\xef\xac\x81ne the\nshape of the fuselage. Finally, all the user-de\xef\xac\x81ned\nsections are joined together through a linear interpolation process which generates the complete vehicle\nmodel. Figure 2.11 shows the AVL representation of\nthe CSR satellite.\n\nFigure 2.11: AVL representation of CSR satellite.\n\nCHAPTER 2. PLANT DEVELOPMENT\nModeling Elliptical Lift Distribution\nThe most important goal of any modeling e\xef\xac\x80ort is\nto generate a model that accurately represents the\nphysical system in the real world. The CSR satellite is designed to have an elliptical lift distribution\nacross the wing surface. This aerodynamic e\xef\xac\x80ect is\nan important contributing factor for eternal \xef\xac\x82ight,\nand should be re\xef\xac\x82ected in the aerodynamic models. Because the satellite rotates around the central hub, outboard wing sections have faster velocity\npro\xef\xac\x81les than inboard sections. The tapered wing\nis designed to account for this di\xef\xac\x80erential velocity\nwhile attaining the desired elliptical loading. Unfortunately, AVL does not permit di\xef\xac\x80erential velocities\nwithin the program. To work around this issue, the\ntwist in the main wing was removed. This adjusted\nmodel in a uniform \xef\xac\x82ow \xef\xac\x81eld, has a similar elliptical\nlift distribution as the CSR satellite operating in a\nstate of rotation.\nOperating Conditions\nDi\xef\xac\x80ering scales of the CSR vehicle will have di\xef\xac\x80erent operating points, which are dependent on the\nvehicle rotational velocity and the distance between\nthe satellite and the hub. Similarly, each system will\nhave two di\xef\xac\x80erent operating points for hover and for\ntakeo\xef\xac\x80s/landings. During start up, the tether is retracted so the satellite must spin more quickly to\ngenerate su\xef\xac\x83cient lift. With a retracted diameter of\n22 ft (6.71 m), the vehicle must rotate at 74 rpm\n(7.75 rad/sec) for takeo\xef\xac\x80s and landings. Once the\nvehicle is airborne, the tethers are let out and the\nsatellites generate the necessary lift at lower rotational velocities. When the tether is extended to\n100 ft (30.48 m), the hub must spin at 11 rpm (1.15\nrad/sec) to maintain the satellite cruise speed. During hover, the linear di\xef\xac\x80erential velocity across satellite wing, from inboard to outboard, is 29 mph (12.96\nm/s) to 34 mph (15.20 m/s), respectively.\nLook-up Table\nWhen the AVL software is run, a unique operating point must be selected, then the software produces a linearized model around that point. However, linearization is only accurate for a small region around the point. To increase the \xef\xac\x81delity of\nthe model, a lookup table is populated with trends\n\n31\nobtained by running the software at a variety of operating points. These operating conditions span the\nentire range of the \xef\xac\x82ight envelope and actuator limits, which provide a complete dynamic picture of the\nsatellite. Five parameters are adjusted\n\xe2\x80\xa2 angle of attack,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 side-slip angle,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 velocity magnitude,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 rudder de\xef\xac\x82ection, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 elevator de\xef\xac\x82ection\nand forces and moments are stored for each operating point. Then, a 5D linear interpolation process approximates the forces and moments between\npoints. The AVL program is automated to generate\nthe aerodynamic lookup table, where the boundaries\nof the variables are shown in Table 2.2.\nVariable\nAoA (\xce\xb1) [deg]\nSide-slip (\xce\xb2) [deg]\nRudder (\xce\xb4R ) [deg]\nElevator (\xce\xb4E ) [deg]\nVelocity [m/s]\n\nMin\n-12\n-12\n-25\n-25\n30\n\nMax\n12\n12\n25\n25\n15\n\nPoints\n7\n7\n7\n7\n8\n\nTable 2.2: Aerodynamic boundaries.\nTrends\nThis section presents a series of \xef\xac\x81gures that showcase the AVL generated results. For all plots, angles\nare in degrees, forces are in Newtons, and moments\nare in Newton-meters. Lift and drag are primarily\na function of angle of attack \xce\xb1 and vehicle airspeed\nV , so the \xef\xac\x81rst four plots demonstrate these relationships in Figure 2.12. The next six plots present the\nchange in force and moment with respect to a change\nin a single independent variable. The nominal airspeed is 22.5 m/s, and the angle of attack, side-slip\nangle, rudder de\xef\xac\x82ection, and elevator de\xef\xac\x82ection are\nall set to zero degrees. Each of the \xef\xac\x81ve subplots\nchanges a single variable, while all other variables\nare held at their nominal values. Figures 2.13, 2.14,\nand 2.15 showcase the forces, and Figures 2.16, 2.17\nand 2.18 present the moments. All the plots demonstrate well-behaved trends which are smooth functions with no discontinuities.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Several simplifying assumptions are\npresent which will be addressed in future work.\nCurrent derivations treat each satellite vehicle as\na rigid body. In reality, the long and slender wing\nsection may experience bend and/or twist during\n\xef\xac\x82ight. Subsequent developments can model these additional dynamics through a Finite Element Analysis\n(FEA) or a more re\xef\xac\x81ned multibody dynamics model.\nThe existing model only evaluates individual\nsatellite components, so it does not account for\naerodynamic interactions between the components.\nItems such as wing tip vortices, aerodynamics\naround the wing and fuselage connection, and interactions between the stabilizers and control surfaces,\nare not accounted for. Future work will continue\nto develop the CFD model of the satellite to popu-\n\nlate the Matlab look-up table. This data will return\nforces and moments acting on the satellite for given\nairspeeds and control inputs.\nFinally, a basic linear relationship models the\npropeller dynamics. More re\xef\xac\x81ned models should account for o\xef\xac\x80-axis forces and moments, side air\xef\xac\x82ow\ninto the propeller, blade \xef\xac\x82apping, and time constants\nwithin the motor system dynamics.\n\n2.3\n\nSimulation\n\nWith the CSR dynamics established, the \xef\xac\x81nal step\ntoward implementing the equations of motion, establishes the relationships between all the rigid body\nelements. This section formulates the multibody dynamics problem through an illustrative generic example, expands the theory to the Round the Pole\n(RTP) and CSR systems, and explains how the numerical routine is implemented in Matlab.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

PLANT DEVELOPMENT\n\n2.3.1\n\nMultibody Dynamics Motivation\n\nSimple elements, like springs and dampers, have an\nexact representation between forces and states, so a\nclosed form solution is available. With the CSR dynamics, air\xef\xac\x82ow over the tether generates drag forces\nwhich are dependent on the current state of the\ntether, so no closed form solution exists. Therefore,\na numerical approach is required to represent the\ntether in the CSR model.\nSeveral approaches are available to model a\nmultibody system. Hand derivations like Kane\xe2\x80\x99s and\nLagrange\xe2\x80\x99s methods, are laborious and changes to\nthe model or number of elements require new derivations. The following approach is similar to an Finite\nElement Analysis (FEA) model where each section\nis modeled as a smaller building block, but FEA linearizes early in the process, and is only suitable for\nsmall perturbations.\nThe CSR simulation implements a multibody dynamics formulation. This approach keeps the nonlinearity in the model, is appropriate for numerical integration, and can be assembled by inspection.\nThis approach o\xef\xac\x80ers the most accurate model, and\nis modular enough to accommodate design revisions\nand various prototypes during the design process.\n\n2.3.2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThe system is broken down into rigid body subcomponents connected together with spherical joints.\nThe simulation structure represents some states in\nthe inertial frame and other states in a local body\nframe. This section describes the dynamics of a\nrigid body, the rotation matrix between coordinate\nframes, how to express derivatives in di\xef\xac\x80erent coordinate frames, and a common notation used within\nthe multibody development.\nRigid Body Dynamics\n\n34\nrate vector, and m and J are the mass and moment\ninertia of the rigid body.\nRotation Matrix\nDuring the development of the equations of motion,\nsome elements need to be transformed between the\ninertial frame and its local body frame. When working with Euler angles, the rotation from body frame\nto inertial frame is given by the rotation matrix R,\ndescribed by\n\xef\xa3\xae\n\xef\xa3\xb9\nc\xce\xb8 c\xcf\x88 \xe2\x88\x92c\xcf\x86 s\xcf\x88 +s\xcf\x86 s\xce\xb8 c\xcf\x88 s\xcf\x86 s\xcf\x88 +c\xcf\x86 s\xce\xb8 c\xcf\x88\nR =\xef\xa3\xb0 c\xce\xb8 s\xcf\x88 c\xcf\x86 c\xcf\x88 +s\xcf\x86 s\xce\xb8 s\xcf\x88 \xe2\x88\x92s\xcf\x86 c\xcf\x88 +c\xcf\x86 s\xce\xb8 s\xcf\x88 \xef\xa3\xbb (2.18)\n\xe2\x88\x92s\xce\xb8\ns\xcf\x86 c\xce\xb8\nc\xcf\x86 c\xce\xb8\nwhere sine and cosine (s\xe2\x88\x97 , c\xe2\x88\x97 ) act on the attitude\n(\xcf\x86, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x88) of the element.

The priority was to develop the dynamics as\neasily as possible, so controls analysis could begin as\nsoon as possible. However, the current multibody\nstructure has some potential areas of improvement\nwhich may be addressed in future work.\nThe current structure completely models each\nrigid body and all constraints among them. Many\nrelationships can be expressed in terms of states of\nneighboring elements. Thus, the current structure\nmodels redundant states and does not o\xef\xac\x80er a minimal set. Because the simulation is based on a numerical routine, small numerical discrepancies between\nthese redundant states may accumulate over time.\nThe simulation runs in Matlab with an ordinary\ndi\xef\xac\x80erential equation (ODE) solver. Solving for the\nderivatives of the states requires the inverse of the\nsquare matrix given in (2.27). This is not a concern\nfor a smaller number of rigid bodies, but the size of\nthe matrix grows rapidly with higher \xef\xac\x81delity models (more elements are added). The structure of the\nmatrix is predominantly diagonal, so a more e\xef\xac\x83cient\ninverse procedure may be devised.\n\ni\ni\n\n2.4\n\nTrimming\n\ni\no\no\no\nTable 2.5: CSR connectivity table.\n\nDynamics establishes how the system moves, and\nthe multibody structure implements those equations\nof motion in the simulation. This section addresses\ntrimming, which seeks the set of states and control\ninputs that achieve an equilibrium point. In other\n\nCHAPTER 2. PLANT DEVELOPMENT\nwords, the set of values that keep the system states\nand control inputs constant.\nTrimming is an important milestone for several\nreasons. First, it obtains the values for speci\xef\xac\x81c \xef\xac\x82ight\nconditions, like hover and forward \xef\xac\x82ight. These\nsteady state values are also needed to perform linearization, which is required to begin the controls\nanalysis. Finally, trimmed states are used as system\ninitial conditions before running a simulation.\nThe CSR has a complicated nonlinear model\nwith intertwined states and control inputs, so an analytic approach to determining equilibrium points is\nnot possible. Matlab has built-in functions which\ncan trim certain classes of problems; however, the\nspecial structure of the CSR multibody problem precludes the use of these existing functions. This section presents the procedure for trimming the CSR\nsystem, addresses limitations with traditional trimming routines applied to multibody dynamics problems, and presents an alternative approach using\nnonlinear optimization techniques.\n\n38\n\nFigure 2.24: Multibody model to trim.\nMultibody Trimming Limitation\n\nMany types of modeling problems are formulated as\ndecoupled rigid bodies which are connected together\nthrough springs and dampers. Figure 2.23 illustrates\nthis common modeling form. For this arrangement,\nthe masses (and their states) are independent of one\nanother, so a single state can be perturbed while\nthe others remain static. In the multibody dynamics structure, the rigid bodies must maintain joint\nconstraints, so the states of the rigid bodies are not\n2.4.1 Problem Formulation\nindependent.

The inner loop\n\nCHAPTER 2. PLANT DEVELOPMENT\nstarts at a tether anchor point and works outwards\ntoward the satellite. Optimization runs on each rigid\nbody to achieve a force balance within that element.\nAfter the satellite has been optimized, the entire\ntether arm achieves a force balance condition. However, the lift generated by the satellite depends entirely on the initial values used at the hub, so there\nis no assurance that the generated lift equals the\nrequired lift. The outer optimization loop incrementally adjusts the hub rotation and anchor point\nforces, runs the inner loop again, and reevaluates the\namount of lift generated. The outer loop optimization continues until there is a force balance within\nthe central hub.\n\n2.4.2\n\nOptimization\n\nThe trimming routine uses several di\xef\xac\x80erent optimizations to to obtain a force balance within the\nelements. The \xef\xac\x81rst optimization balances a single\ntether element. Then a loop applies this routine\nto all the links in the tether. Another optimization\n\xef\xac\x81nds the satellite states and control inputs to achieve\na force balance within the outermost segment of the\ntether chain. This process completes the inner loop\nroutine. The \xef\xac\x81nal optimization seeks a force balance\nwithin the central hub. This outer loop optimization\nadjusts the hub angular velocity and tether anchor\nforce until the lift generated by the satellite equals\nthe weight it needs to support. The following sections describe each process in detail.\nTether Force Balance\n\n39\ntether until the force balance equality\nFi + Fc + Fd + Fg + Fo = 0\n\n(2.32)\n\nis satis\xef\xac\x81ed. A similar relationship balances the moments acting on the tether element.\nTether Projection\nThe previous section outlined a process that takes\nan inboard tether state, balances the forces within\nthe element, and returns the outboard tether state.\nTether projection describes a program loop that balances all the elements of the tether. The loop starts\nwith the hub anchor force and the angular rate of\nthe hub, and applies the optimization to the inner\nmost tether element. The outboard states of this\n\xef\xac\x81rst element become the inboard states for the next\nelement. The loop proceeds outward through each\nsection until it reaches the \xef\xac\x81nal tether element. The\noutboard states of the \xef\xac\x81nal tether are used as the\nanchor position, velocity and force for the satellite.\nSatellite Force Balance\nThe satellite optimization is very similar to the\ntether optimization. The tether end point states\nwere determined from the tether projection loop, but\nthe satellite attitude and control inputs are still unknown. As a starting point, the satellite is initialized with a zero attitude, zero control surface de\xef\xac\x82ection, and a reasonable guess value for throttle\ninput. The optimization takes the tether end point\nstates, and the current values for satellite attitude\nand control inputs. For this particular state, the\nprogram evaluates the centrifugal force and aerodynamic forces/moments, calculates the summation of\nforces and moments on the satellite, and compares\nthis value to zero. The optimization incrementally\nadjusts the satellite states and control inputs until\nthe net forces and moments are reduced to zero. This\ncompletes the inner loop.\n\nConsider a single tether element. The goal is to \xef\xac\x81nd\nthe state that achieves a force balance between all\nthe forces acting on the element. These forces include the inner and outer joint constraint forces, Fi\nand Fo , a centrifugal force Fc , aerodynamic drag Fd ,\nand gravity Fg . Assume that the hub angular rate\nand the tether\xe2\x80\x99s inboard position, velocity, and force\nare all known.

These states determine the\ndrag force, centrifugal force, and outboard endpoint The previous sections describe the inner loop which\nforce. The optimization adjusts the attitude of the balances the entire tether arm with a satellite. That\n\nCHAPTER 2. PLANT DEVELOPMENT\n\n40\n\nprocess began with an initial guess for the hub anchor force and system angular rate. Using these initial guess values, the lift generated from the satellite\nmay not equal the lift force needed for the system.\nTherefore, an outer loop optimization is needed to\nbalance the hub forces. The optimization compares\nthe current amount of lift to the force required to\nsupport the weight of the entire system. It also balances the moment generated by the tether force with\nthe rotational aerodynamic drag from the spinning\nhub. If the net forces and moments are non zero, the\noptimization routine adjusts the hub angular rate\nand the hub anchor force, and then runs another inner loop optimization. This iterative process continues until the hub and satellite achieve static equilibrium. Once the CSR system is completely balanced,\nthe states and control inputs are stored as initial conditions for the simulation and as operating points for\nlinearization.\n\n2.4.3\n\nwhere FS is the satellite lift force previously calculated, \xcf\x81 is the density of air, vS is the forward linear\nvelocity of the satellite, A is the planform area of the\nwing, and cSL is the lift coe\xef\xac\x83cient of the satellite\nwing. The only unknown value in this relationship\nis the satellite velocity. Rearranging the equation\nleads to the equality\nvS =\n\n2FS\n\xcf\x81AcSL\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhich yields the forward velocity vS required to\nachieve the desired lift force FS . This result assumes a level \xef\xac\x82ight condition. The true velocity will\nbe slightly greater to because the trimmed satellite\nattitude will not be perfectly level.\nSatellite Position\nDuring \xef\xac\x82ight the tether will curve from aerodynamic\ndrag and from the force of gravity. The amount of\ncurvature is unknown until after the optimization\nroutine. As a starting point, assume the tether has\nno curvature and projects straight out towards the\nsatellite. The hub anchor position, the length of the\ntether, and the satellite anchor position have known\ndimensions, which can be added together to obtain\nrS , an approximate starting position for the satellite.\n\nInitial Guess Values\n\nAll the minimization routines require initial conditions to begin the optimization process. Values\nfor the inner loop optimizations (tether and satellite) were initialized locally. However, the outer\nloop initial conditions (hub angular rate and anchor force) are still unaccounted for. This section\npresents derivations that yield approximate values\nsuitable for initializing the outer loop optimization.

The last step toward developing the CRS\nplant, takes the nonlinear system and creates a linear\nmodel around those trimmed operating points.\nLinearization is an important topic because the\nvast majority of the controls analysis is based on the\nlinear system model. Linearizing multibody dynamics problems have many of the same hurdles as with\ntrimming, so this research utilizes the alternative\ntrimming technique and adapts it to the linearization process for multibody dynamics problems.\nThis section presents the Taylor series expansion\nof a nonlinear model, and describes how the partial\nderivatives form state space matrices of the linear\nsystem.

However, the Matlab process is expecting a model that resembles Figure 2.23,\nwhich is not suitable for multibody problems.\nAn alternative approach is used. For each entry\nin the A matrix select a single state (xj ) at equilibrium.

Stabilizing and maneuvering the hub, as well as the rest of the system,\nis accomplished indirectly through the tension in the\ntethers, which is manipulated by the control inputs\napplied to each individual satellite vehicle. Investigating these interactions is the \xef\xac\x81rst step towards\ndeveloping the system controllers.\nUnderstanding the background theory used during the controller development is of utmost importance in understanding how the controller is implemented. The purpose of this chapter introduces concepts of state feedback and state estimation to a\ntechnical audience not well versed in control design.\nEntire text books address the underlying theory of\n\nis established for this system, the research on the\nCSR concept vehicle includes several di\xef\xac\x80erent controller methodologies. Prerequisite knowledge is required before applying these techniques, so the goal\nis to present fundamental concepts and then graduate to more advanced strategies.\nBefore introducing the controllers, it is important to understand the concept of a plant, which is\nthe system to be controlled. Describing how to express a system in state space form, how to determine\nthe eigenvalues, and understanding how those eigenvalues contribute to the overall response of the system, is required to understand the controller theory.\nOther topics are directly related to the controller\ndevelopment.

CONTROLS THEORY\nability, and canonical transformations are needed to\nunderstand the controller formulation.\nAfter developing a \xef\xac\x81rm foundation, the various\ncontrollers are presented. The analysis works from\nsimple techniques to more advanced concepts, so the\nstarting point for the controls analysis begins with\nfull state feedback applied to single-input singleoutput (SISO) subsystems, which provides a foundation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\ncontrol. Full state feedback assumes that all the\nsatellite states are available for measurement, which\nis not possible due to the limitations with GPS. State\nestimation addresses this issue, where a reduced\norder estimator is required to estimate unknown\nstates. Finally, parameter identi\xef\xac\x81cation and mitigating model uncertainty is only achieved through\nadaptive control techniques.\nOutline\nBefore assessing any eternal \xef\xac\x82ight capabilities, The\nCSR vehicle must demonstrate an ability to be controlled during \xef\xac\x82ight. This chapter focuses on the\ncontrols theory and analysis to address this issue.\nSection 3.1 presents the Controller Methodology which makes the CSR control problem more\ntractable. It describes the available control modes,\npresents an alternative perspective, and de\xef\xac\x81nes the\nroles of the inner and outer loop feedback systems.\nSection 3.2 outlines the System Analysis performed on the CSR model. It describes its state\nspace representation, transfer matrix, eigenvalues,\nand system poles and zeros. Topics pertaining to\ncontrollability, observability, and decentralized control are related back to the system model.\nSection 3.3 describes SISO State Feedback which\nis the \xef\xac\x81rst control implemented on the vehicle. A\ncustom designed system response is put into a canonical transformation, and implemented through the\nstate feedback controller.\nSection 3.4 expands to MIMO State Feedback\nwhich accommodates coupling between input and\noutput channels. The SISO structure is generalized to handle multiple inputs and multiple outputs,\nwhile still achieving a custom closed-loop response.\nSection 3.5 addresses State Estimation which is\nused when some of the CSR states are not directly\n\n46\nmeasured. Control inputs and measured outputs are\nused to estimate the states and reduce the error to\nzero over time. Then a reduced order estimator is\nimplemented to only estimate unknown states.\nSection 3.6 introduces Adaptive Control which\naccomplishes system identi\xef\xac\x81cation and mitigates\nmodeling uncertainties. It presents a parameter\nidenti\xef\xac\x81cation technique where the adaptive laws ensure stability and parameter convergence. Finally, it\ndiscusses model reference adaptive control (MRAC)\nand L1 adaptive control strategies.\n\n3.1\n\nController Methodology\n\nAt \xef\xac\x81rst glance, controlling the CSR vehicle appears\nvery complicated, which requires full cooperation\nfrom all entities involved. However, this research\nwill show that a slight shift in perspective makes the\ncontrol problem much more tractable.\nThis section outlines the di\xef\xac\x80erent control modes\navailable for the CSR system, which leads into an alternative perspective describing the big picture approach developing the system controller. It describes\nthe roles of the inner and outer loop controllers, and\ndraws a parallel between the controller development\nand the prototype hardware development.\n\n3.1.1\n\nControl Modes\n\nBefore embarking on the speci\xef\xac\x81cs of the CSR controller development; \xef\xac\x81rst recognize that the novel\nCSR design operates in a perpetual state of rotation. Thus, it is important to rede\xef\xac\x81ne some common\nconventions used within general aviation.\nRoll and pitch are synonymous, because there is\nno \xe2\x80\x9cnose\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cside\xe2\x80\x9d to di\xef\xac\x80erentiate between them.\nRoll and pitch describe the same \xef\xac\x82ight maneuver for\nany given direction in the inertial frame. Likewise,\nyaw is arbitrary, because the system rotates constantly. Yaw only has meaning referring to an instrument (like a camera system) that maintains a static\nheading. Accounting for the speci\xef\xac\x81cs of the CSR\ngeometry, only two inertial descriptions are needed:\nvertical translation and horizontal translation.\nBorrowing from rotorcraft terminology, vertical\ntranslation utilizes collective control inputs, and hor-\n\nCHAPTER 3. CONTROLS THEORY\nizontal translation uses cyclic control inputs. Horizontal and vertical translation both have two control\nmodes available to induce each type of motion.\nFor vertical translation, the \xef\xac\x81rst mode applies\ncollective throttle commands. This changes the\nsatellite velocity which alters the lift force. Changing the lift force in unison results in a climb or a\ndescent. The other mode applies collective elevator\ncommands. This changes the satellite pitch angle,\nwhich points the nose of the satellite up or down.\nWith all satellites pointing upward or downward, the\nsystem enters into a climb or descent.\nSimilarly, two cyclic control modes exist for horizontal translation. The \xef\xac\x81rst mode applies cyclic\nrudder commands. This changes the relative heading of the satellites, which adjusts the radial tension\nin the tethers acting on the hub. The command\nis cyclic, so one point in the rotation has maximum\noutward tension, and the opposite side has minimum\nradial tension. Because the forces are imbalanced,\nthe CSR system translates horizontally in the direction of maximum tension. Cyclic elevator commands\ncan also achieve horizontal translation. This command in\xef\xac\x82uences the relative vertical position of the\nsatellites, so each satellite \xef\xac\x82ies through a low point\non one side and a high point directly opposite. This\ncoordinated \xef\xac\x82ight has the e\xef\xac\x80ect of tilting the rotor\nplane, which tilts the overall force vector and induces\nhorizontal translation.\n\n3.1.2\n\nAlternative Perspective\n\nControlling the CSR vehicle appears to be a very\ncomplicated task. With many di\xef\xac\x80erent states, multiple tethers and satellites, and force interactions\npulling on the central hub, the problem appears to\nrequire full cooperation from all entities involved.\nIn many ways, the coordinated e\xef\xac\x80ort resembles\na highway tra\xef\xac\x83c system. When viewed from above,\nthe number of vehicles and potential routes make the\ntra\xef\xac\x83c system appear unmanageable. However, driving is a very simple task as as seen from the driver\xe2\x80\x99s\nseat. As long as each driver adheres to basic rules\n(stay centered within a lane, keep a safe following\ndistance, obey tra\xef\xac\x83c signals), the complex driving\nsystem becomes much more tractable.\nThe same approach can be applied to the CSR\n\n47\nvehicle. Imagine sitting on the hub while peering at\nan individual satellite, operating in a trimmed state\nwith no external disturbances. From this perspective\nthe satellite will maintain a static position relative\nto the hub. It will appear to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xef\xac\x81xed\xe2\x80\x9d in space.\nThe control task identi\xef\xac\x81es meaningful relative\npositions of the satellite with respect to the hub,\nthen applies control signals to manipulate the relative states of the satellite. Altering the relative\nstates changes the tether force vector anchored at\nthe hub. Manipulating the tether anchor forces controls the central hub and the entire CSR system.\n\n3.1.3\n\nInner and Outer Loop Control\n\nPrevious sections described the motion of the CSR\nsystem in the inertial frame, and how to control\nsatellites with respect to their local frame. These\ntwo tasks indicate that two control loops are required\nfor the control system. An inner loop controller is\nresponsible for stabilization, and an outer loop controller executes the waypoint navigation.\nInner loop control works locally on each satellite. The controller adjusts the throttle, elevator,\nand rudder of each satellite. These inputs maintain\nthe desired relative positions with respect to the central hub. This subsystem is mirrored as a Round the\nPole (RTP) \xef\xac\x82ight model.\nOuter loop control works globally on the central\nhub. This moves the CSR vertically and horizontally within the inertial frame. The controller accomplishes this task by manipulating tether forces\nacting on the hub anchor points. It achieves this\nbecause tether anchor forces are mirrored by the relative positions of the satellites.\n\n3.1.4\n\nParallel with Hardware Testing\n\nThe CSR project follows a spiral development life cycle. Because of the novel design, there is very little\nexisting research to assist the development process.\nTo minimize risk during early development, small incremental steps are taken to learn about the system,\ncollect data, and re\xef\xac\x81ne simulation models. More advanced techniques are introduced over time, building\nupon previous lessons learned.\n\nCHAPTER 3. CONTROLS THEORY\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst prototype system implements RTP\n\xef\xac\x82ight. For this model, a single satellite \xef\xac\x82ies around a\n\xef\xac\x81xed pole. The main task identi\xef\xac\x81es trimmed control\ninputs and performs system identi\xef\xac\x81cation on the vehicle. Collected data is compared to simulation data,\nand the computer model is revised to more closely\nmatch the physical system.\nThe next milestone is a \xef\xac\x81xed \xef\xac\x82ight. This model\nhas three satellites constrained to a pole. The primary objective maintains equal spacing between the\nsatellites, and tests coordinated \xef\xac\x82ight maneuvers.\nEqual spacing between satellites is a requirement before graduating to a free \xef\xac\x82ight test. Similarly, coordinated \xef\xac\x82ights demonstrate collective and cyclic commands executed by the satellites. These capabilities\nare accomplished within a controlled environment,\nbefore advancing to a free \xef\xac\x82ight.\nThe \xef\xac\x81nal stage implements the free \xef\xac\x82ight model.\nThis is the fully unconstrained CSR system. The\nobjective is to demonstrate hover abilities and to\nachieve waypoint navigation through coordinated\n\xef\xac\x82ight maneuvers. Once a \xef\xac\x82ying prototype is available, the research will evaluate disturbance rejection\nand the e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of various adaptive controllers.\n\n3.2\n\nSystem Analysis\n\n48\nwhere x(t) \xe2\x88\x88 Rn is the state vector, u(t) \xe2\x88\x88 Rm is\nthe control input, y(t) \xe2\x88\x88 Rq is the system output,\nA \xe2\x88\x88 Rn\xc3\x97n is the state matrix, B \xe2\x88\x88 Rn\xc3\x97m is the input matrix, and C \xe2\x88\x88 Rq\xc3\x97n is the output matrix.

GPS provides\nsu\xef\xac\x83cient accuracy for waypoint navigation, but does\nnot have enough \xef\xac\x81delity to provide the satellite location with respect to the central hub.\nState estimation is a powerful control technique\nthat can overcome these short comings. It is designed to make use of all the available measurements\nand then estimate states that are not measured. The\ntheory is a direct extension of state feedback, so it\nbuilds heavily upon the previous foundation. This\nsection introduces the general theory for full state estimation, shows the error reduction process, and expands the theory to a reduced order estimator which\nonly estimates the unknown states.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The tether\nis 30 feet (9.14 m) long, with a 3/64 inch (1.19 mm)\ndiameter, and is modeled with a density of 500 lb/ft3\n(8,000 kg/m3 ).

The wingspan is 38\ninches (96.5 cm) and the planform wing area is 356\nin2 (2297 cm2 ). The vehicle is 24 inches (61.0 cm)\nlong with a weight of 2.5 lbf (11.12 N).

Adjusting the relative horizontal position, changes the magnitude of the lateral force. A\nrelative position leading the hub increases the lateral\ntension, and a relative position behind the hub decreases the lateral tension. Throttle control is a very\nstable subsystem, because the satellite drag counteracts the throttle force from the motor.\nElevator\nThe elevator adjusts the de\xef\xac\x82ection of the control surface on the horizontal stabilizer, which in\xef\xac\x82uences the\nvertical position of the satellite relative to the central hub. During operation, a vertical tension pulls\nat the hub anchor point. Adjusting the relative vertical position, changes the magnitude of the vertical\nforce. A relative position above the hub increases\nvertical tension, and a relative position below the\nhub decreases the vertical tension. Elevator control\nis a marginally stable subsystem, because the satellite pivots around a point with no restoring forces.\nRudder\nThe rudder adjusts the de\xef\xac\x82ection of the control surface on the vertical stabilizer, which in\xef\xac\x82uences the\nheading of the satellite relative to the central hub.\nDuring operation, a radial tension pulls outward on\nthe hub anchor point. Adjusting the relative heading, changes the magnitude of the radial force. A\nrelative heading away from the hub increases the radial tension, and a relative heading toward the hub\ndecreases the radial tension. Rudder control is the\nmost stable subsystem, because the centrifugal force\nacting on the satellite wants to remain aligned with\nthe tether anchored on the satellite.\n\nInputs\nThere are three control inputs for each satellite,\nwhere each control input in\xef\xac\x82uences a state of the\nsatellite relative to the central hub. The throttle\ncommand \xce\xb3, is in Newtons. It adjusts the force generated by the motor system, and in\xef\xac\x82uences the relative horizontal position of the satellite. The elevator\ncommand \xce\xb1 is in radians. It is a measure of the\nelevator angle of de\xef\xac\x82ection, and it in\xef\xac\x82uences the relative vertical position of the satellite. The rudder\ncommand \xce\xb2 is also in radians. It describes the rudder angle of de\xef\xac\x82ection, and it in\xef\xac\x82uences the relative\nheading of the satellite. Together they form\nu(t) = [ \xce\xb3, \xce\xb1, \xce\xb2 ]T\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhich is the control input vector signal.\nStates\nThe RTP system has ten total states.

For illustrative purposes, the \xef\xac\x81rst analysis will implement identical response characteristics on each of the subsystems. In future developments, each system may have\na uniquely optimized dynamic response to accommodate other design considerations, such as power\nconsumption or disturbance rejection.\nAs a starting point, the desired settling time\nshould be around ts = 0.5 seconds, and the percent\novershoot should be close to Mp = 5%. The goal is\nto obtain the real and imaginary parts of the complex roots, \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x89, respectively. Obtain the real\npart (\xcf\x83 = Re[\xce\xbb]) of the complex root with\n\xcf\x83=\n\n4.6\n4.6\n=\n= 9.2\nts\n0.5\n\n64\n\ns + \xcf\x83 \xc2\xb1 \xcf\x89j = s + 10 \xc2\xb1 10j\n\n(4.15)\n\nso the desired characteristic polynomial becomes\n\xce\xb1(s) = (s + 10 + 10j)(s + 10 \xe2\x88\x92 10j)\n= s2 + 20s + 200\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhich yields polynomial coe\xef\xac\x83cients of \xce\xb10 = 200 and\n\xce\xb11 = 20. The rudder and throttle both have two\nstates, so this polynomial is used directly. The elevator has four total states, so a second set of complex\npoles are added at the same location, which leads to\n\xce\xb1(s) = (s2 + 20s + 200)(s2 + 20s + 200)\n= s4 +40s3 +800s2 +8000s +40000\n\n(4.17)\n\nwith polynomial coe\xef\xac\x83cients of \xce\xb10 = 40000, \xce\xb11 =\n8000, \xce\xb12 = 800, and \xce\xb13 = 40.\n\n4.2.2\n\nRudder Controller\n\nBegin with rudder control, because it is the most\nstraight forward to implement.

Because\nthe system is fully observable, state estimation and\nreduced order estimation controllers can be implemented. This result is necessary to move forward\nwhen GPS is not available to measure the relative\nstates of the satellites.\n\nSISO Simulations\n\nSeveral simulations were run to demonstrate the controller performance on the RTP control line model.\nThe SISO controllers are applied to the nonlinear\nmodel in the simulation to demonstrate the system\nresponse, disturbance rejection, and reference tracking capabilities. The simulations are shown in Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, and the trimmed RTP\nmodel is displayed in Figure 4.5.\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst three \xef\xac\x81gures present the system response when only the speci\xef\xac\x81ed controller is applied,\nand the other two control inputs are left at their\ntrimmed values. Figure 4.4 simulates the system\nwhen all control subsystems are applied and disturbances are applied to each input-output pair.\nFigure 4.1 shows the simulation when throttle\ncontrol is applied, and elevator and rudder inputs\nmaintain their trimmed values. At 0.5 seconds, the\nsystem has a 5 Newton impulse disturbance applied\nat the nose of the satellite. At 1.5 seconds, the reference signal changes so the system must track a new\nrelative horizontal position of -0.015 meters.\nFigure 4.2 shows the simulation when elevator\ncontrol is applied, and throttle and rudder inputs\nmaintain their trimmed values. At 0.5 seconds, the\nsystem has a 3 Newton impulse disturbance applied\ndownward at the CG of the satellite. At 1.5 seconds,\nthe reference signal changes so the relative vertical\nposition is -0.015 meters of the trimmed value.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND SIMULATIONS\nFigure 4.3 shows the simulation when rudder\ncontrol is applied, and throttle and elevator inputs\nmaintain their trimmed values. At 0.5 seconds, the\nsystem has a 5 Newton-meter torque impulse disturbance applied on the vertical axis at the CG of the\nsatellite. At 1.5 seconds, the reference signal changes\nand the system must track a new relative heading of\n-1.625 radians.\nFigure 4.4 shows the simulation when all control\nsignals are applied, and the system experiences disturbances on all three subsystems. At 0.5 seconds,\nthe system has the disturbance applied to the rudder\nsubsystem, at 1.5 seconds, the system has the disturbance applied to the throttle subsystem, and at\n2.5 seconds, the system has the disturbance applied\nto the elevator subsystem.\nEach simulation shows that the closed-loop response has a settling time around 0.5 seconds, with\napproximately 5% overshoot, as speci\xef\xac\x81ed during the\ncontroller design. Additionally, each individual system demonstrates that the overall system has significant decoupling between states, so that each control input mostly in\xef\xac\x82uences the desired system state.\nThe \xef\xac\x81nal simulation with all control signals applied,\nshows that each input-output pair does not con\xef\xac\x82ict\nwith the other input-out pairs, and the full system\nbehaves very similarly to the individual simulations.\n\n4.4.2\n\nMIMO RTP Simulation\n\nThe SISO controllers are easily implemented within\nthe simulation, and serve as a good tool for evaluating controller performance on a single input/output\nchannel. However, the full CSR satellite will require\nMIMO control because that is the form needed to\nperform state estimation when the relative position\nof the satellite is not known.\nTo provide an accurate comparison, the full\nMIMO controller was designed with the same response characteristics as the SISO subsystems. The\nsystem was evaluated, and the gain matrices were\nobtained in a previous section. The simulation of\nthe system was subjected to the same disturbances\nas the previous SISO simulations, but the MIMO\ncontroller was implemented to mitigate the track-\n\n68\n\ning errors. Because the Relative Gain Array (RGA)\nshowed very minimal coupling between the other input/output channels, the MIMO controller simulation should look very similar to the SISO controller\nsimulations. Figure 4.6 demonstrates that this is the\ncase, were the MIMO system response is nearly identical to the SISO subsystem controllers.\n\n4.4.3\n\nFuture Simulations\n\nThe current simulations show promise for the CSR\nvehicle. The RGA indicates that there are strong\none-to-one mappings between the inputs and outputs. This result is very favorable because implementing the control system is a much more straight\nforward process when the system is decentralized.\nThe simulations also show that SISO design techniques can be used to formulate the closed-loop system dynamics, and the MIMO controller will very\nclosely mirror the prescribed dynamics.\nThe next round of simulations will implement the\nstate estimator and reduced order state estimator.\nExisting control theory states that because the system is both controllable and observable, these controllers will work for the CSR system. However, simulations are still needed to demonstrate this type of\ncontrol. Additionally, the theory states that the error can be reduced to zero at an arbitrarily fast decay rate; however, faster dynamics require more aggressive control authority. Simulating the estimator\ncontrollers will indicate what decay rate is achievable\nwithin the actuator bandwidths.\nThe \xef\xac\x81nal set of simulations prior to hardware\ntesting will develop the parameter estimation adaptive controller. Similar to the reduced order controllers, theory states that a persistently exciting signal ensures that the adaptation will push the parameter estimates toward their true values. However, it\ndoes not give any indication of what signal frequencies are appropriate. Simulating the parameter estimation is the best way to make sure the multisine\nsignal injection is within the bandwidth of the system dynamics, and that the satellite vehicle has an\nacceptable transient response.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Instead of developing a single high \xef\xac\x81delity model, each cycle utilizes prototypes to obtain a greater understanding of\nthe conceptual system. Early models are very simple\nand only attempt to capture the most dominant system characteristics. Early prototypes are developed\nquickly and inexpensively, which serve as a proof of\nconcept. Simulation models are compared against\ndata collected from the prototypes. The validation\nprocess is the crucial step with spiral development,\nwhere one of two things will happen.\nIn the \xef\xac\x81rst outcome, the analysis may prove the\nproject is infeasible. Unanticipated issues may be\nuncovered, or seemingly small problems are now recognized as major concerns. Quite possibly, the concept design relies on a key component or feature,\nwhich did not work out favorably in the prototype.\nWhen this is the case, a considerable amount of time,\ne\xef\xac\x80ort, and money is spared rather than proceeding\nforward with a doomed project.\nFor the second outcome, the analysis may indicate the project is feasible and warrants additional\nconsideration. Under this scenario, the collected\ndata validates or improves the existing computer\nmodel. The analysis may show that certain simplifying assumptions need to be re\xef\xac\x81ned, or it might identify parameter values that were initially estimated.\nThis re\xef\xac\x81ned model initiates a new round of prototype development. It serves as a design tool for sizing\nfeatures, indicates where revisions are required, and\nreveals potential design improvements. The spiral\n\nDisadvantages\nSome projects are not well suited for spiral development. Projects that are su\xef\xac\x83ciently straight forward may not need a prototype because pure analysis will su\xef\xac\x83ce. Building a bridge is such an example,\nwhere analytic tools are available to calculate the\nloads, and there are minimal dynamics to take into\naccount. Other times, building a prototype is not\nfeasible. A nuclear power plant meets this criteria,\nbecause a prototype reactor is not practical or safe.\n\nAdvantages\nDespite notable limitations, spiral development offers some distinct advantages over a linear design\nprocess. Whether spiral development is appropriate\nreduces down to a simple cost-bene\xef\xac\x81t analysis. A\nlinear design requires upfront costs in the form of\nbuilding elaborate models, running monte carlo simulations, and processing data. Spiral development\ncuts many of these costs, but includes the time and\nexpense building a series of prototypes. To determine which design technique is appropriate, simply\nestimate the total design expense for each. For example, systems with complex dynamics, like large\nship building, may bene\xef\xac\x81t from spiral development.\nAn exorbitant amount of e\xef\xac\x80ort could go towards\nmodeling the hull hydrodynamics, and the resulting model may still include unaccounted errors. A\nsmall scale prototype, tested under appropriate circumstances, would yield the actual hull dynamics.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Because it is the \xef\xac\x81rst vehicle, no data is available to\ncontribute towards the design, so all preliminary design work is based on unveri\xef\xac\x81ed simulation models.\nHowever, the simulation cannot be validated until\nthe prototype is \xef\xac\x82own. Similarly, the avionics hardware and sensors have never been implemented on a\nreal \xef\xac\x82ight platform; only bench tested within a controlled environment. The \xef\xac\x81rst prototype vehicle falls\ninto a viscous circle, where it is risky to \xef\xac\x82y without\nsome validation, but the components are only validated through \xef\xac\x82ying the vehicle.\n\nScaled Prototype\n\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst prototype tested avionics and control algorithms on a stable platform. The second prototype\ntakes the next incremental step, and implements a\nsystem that more closely mirrors the CSR concept.\nDescription\n\nThe scaled prototype is a mono-wing design with a\nfuselage at the outboard tip, an elevator outboard of\nthe fuselage, and a vertical stabilizer under the fuselage. The tapered wing starts with zero incidence\nangle at the root and wingtip, and gradually moves\nto a 6.5 \xe2\x97\xa6 incidence angle about half way through the\nDescription\nwing.

PROTOTYPE TESTING PLAN\n\n77\n\nThe high aspect ratio wing has some degree of \xef\xac\x82exibility, which needs to be observed. Other aerodynamic features are unique to the CSR system, and\nnot completely known. The rotating system has differential velocity over the wing surface, which may\nimpact the relative heading.

This vehicle follows\nthe same testing procedure as the other prototypes\nwhich yields valuable information about the vehicle\ncharacteristics. As a worst case scenario, the collected data will shed insight into what revisions are\nneeded to improve the performance of the vehicle;\nand if all goes well, the CSR will be the \xef\xac\x81rst aircraft\nin history to achieve eternal \xef\xac\x82ight.\n\nThe following description is based entirely on preliminary analysis work, and is subject to change once\ndata is collected and evaluated from preliminary prototype models. The full scale CSR is expected to\nhave around a 350 foot diameter. The satellite wing\nhas a high aspect ratio greater than 50, with a 0.7\nfoot chord and a length of 35 feet. Control surface\npositions and sizes may change once new data is received, but are anticipated to be in nearly the same\npositions with the same relative sizes as the scaled\nprototype. Additional analysis is needed to specify\nthe motor, propeller, batteries, and solar cells.\n\nDescription\n\n5.3\n\nTesting Plan\n\nEach prototype is a natural progression that moves\nfrom simple vehicles to more complex systems.

This section describes the three general\nNo formal plans have been established for a full scale types of tests: (1) round the pole, (2) constrained\nprototype.

However, to complete the analysis and to fully assess the eternal \xef\xac\x82ight This test has the least amount of risk because it only\ninvolves a single satellite. These tests gather imporcapabilities, this prototype will need to be built.\ntant data that is used for system identi\xef\xac\x81cation and\ninner-loop controller design.\nDescription\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Round the Pole (RTP) \xef\xac\x82ight most closely resembles the control line aircraft. A \xef\xac\x81xed pole anchors the system to the ground, but the pole has a\nbearing that is free to swivel about the vertical axis.\nThe rotating hub has the data collection board, the\ntransceiver for the RC radio, wireless telemetry to\ncommunicate with the satellite, and a magnetometer\nand rate gyro to measure heading and angular rate\nof the hub. A tether is attached to the hub and a\nsingle satellite vehicle. The satellite has throttle, elevator, and rudder control inputs which are obtained\nfrom the central computer.\n\nThe most obvious purpose of the full scale proto- Objectives\ntype is to demonstrate eternal \xef\xac\x82ight capabilities.\nWhile, the \xef\xac\x81rst prototypes validated hardware and For each prototype, this test marks the maiden voycollected aerodynamic data, this vehicle is primarily age, so the emphasis is on reducing risk to the\n\nCHAPTER 5. PROTOTYPE TESTING PLAN\nuntested vehicle and gaining con\xef\xac\x81dence in the system capabilities. All work has been purely analytical\nand performed in simulations, so these \xef\xac\x82ights serve\nto validate and re\xef\xac\x81ne the computer models. The\nmain goals of these tests are to focus on the inner\nloop-control mode functionality by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ndemonstrating the new system in \xef\xac\x82ight,\nvalidating all hardware, sensors, and actuators,\n\xef\xac\x81nding inputs to achieve static equilibrium,\ncharacterizing system dynamics through system identi\xef\xac\x81cation,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 comparing \xef\xac\x82ight data to simulations, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 validating or re\xef\xac\x81ne existing model dynamics.\nApproach\nTesting a new prototype is done through incremental\nsteps to make sure more risky maneuvers are built\nupon a \xef\xac\x81rm foundation. The \xef\xac\x81rst step will bench\ntest all the prototype components. All control inputs will be tested to make sure they work properly.\nAll sensors will be evaluated to con\xef\xac\x81rm good measurement, and that the data logger works properly.\nTaxi Test: After the bench test, move on to the\ntaxi test. This has the system in a ready to \xef\xac\x82y con\xef\xac\x81guration, and throttles up the motor to around 9095% of the value needed to achieve lift. The vehicle\nwill spin around the hub at nearly \xef\xac\x82ight speeds, but\nwill not be enough to achieve lift. As the satellite\nruns around the pole, data logging is enabled, sensors acquire data, and the control surfaces are perturbed slightly to evaluate their e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness before\nthe vehicle ever leaves the safety of the ground. Post\nprocessing will ensure the sensor data looks good,\nand changes will be made to tune the controller values and RC radio settings.\nTrimming: The next series of tests will run the\nsystem open-loop controlled by a pilot. The vehicle\nwill throttle up until lift is attained and the pilot\nwill actuate the control inputs. The RC radio is\nequipped to trim the inputs onsite, so adjustments\nwill be made to \xef\xac\x81nd the trimmed RC input values.\nDoublets: With trimmed RC inputs, the pilot\nwill command a series of doublets on each control\nchannel. Doublets are a quick maneuver designed\nto perturb a single input and then quickly bring the\n\n78\nvehicle back to a steady-state. The doublets begin\nwith small magnitudes and gradually move up to\nlarger command inputs. At some point the doublet\nwill be deemed \xe2\x80\x9ctoo aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d and the test is complete. The data is post processed and the values\nof the most aggressive doublets are used to design\ncontrol gains that are appropriate for the system.\nFeedback Control: The open-loop \xef\xac\x82ight data\nsheds light on the system dynamics. This information is used to determine the gains needed for a feedback control algorithm. The system is now \xef\xac\x82own\nclosed-loop with the feedback controller applying input commands. Data is collected and the feedback\ncontrol gains are adjusted as needed.\nSignal Injection: Once the satellite has a solid\nfeedback control law, the \xef\xac\x81nal step is to evaluate the\nsystem through multisine signal injection. This process \xef\xac\x82ies the feedback controlled system and superimposes a summation of sinusoidal signals on top of\nthe existing control inputs. These signals excite the\nsystem dynamics which generate new measurements\nthat are used in the system identi\xef\xac\x81cation process.\nThe data is post processed and compared against\nthe the existing simulation model, and revisions are\nmade as needed, until the computer model matches\nthe collected data. This revised computer model is\nused to develop the controller for the next round of\ntesting: the constrained \xef\xac\x82ight.\n\n5.3.2\n\nConstrained Flight\n\nThe RTP tests investigated the behavior of a single\nsatellite vehicle. The constrained \xef\xac\x82ight tests increase\nthe level of di\xef\xac\x83culty by working with three satellites\nin unison. However, this series of tests still reduces\nthe amount of risk by constraining the central hub.\nDescription\nThe constrained \xef\xac\x82ight test setup is very similar to\nthe RTP setup, except three satellites are tethered to\nthe central hub. The satellite system is setup identically to the RTP system with all the same components and control inputs. The central hub has all\nthe same components but three satellites are tethered to the hub. The \xef\xac\x81rst series of test has the\nhub constrained identically as the RTP system with\n\nCHAPTER 5. PROTOTYPE TESTING PLAN\none single degree of freedom which rotates about the\nvertical axis. Subsequent tests relax the number of\nconstraints where \xef\xac\x81rst, the hub is free to translate\nvertically, and then the hub is bounded but unconstrained in all six degrees of freedom.\nObjectives\nThe RTP tests yielded insight into the dynamics of a\nsingle satellite which mirrors the inner-loop control.\nTo control the complete CSR system also requires\ncoordination between all the satellites to achieve the\nouter-loop control. The objective of these tests is\nto evaluate the e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of the controller to implement coordination between all entities. It begins\nwith the most basic task of maintaining equal spacing between satellites. Then it graduates to coordinated \xef\xac\x82ights, \xef\xac\x81rst with a single degree of freedom,\nthen with two degrees of freedom, and \xef\xac\x81nally with\nbounded six degree of freedom tests. The main goals\nof the constrained \xef\xac\x82ight tests are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 demonstrate equal spacing between satellites,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 single degree of freedom tests,\n\xe2\x80\x93 collective throttle and elevator\n\xe2\x80\x93 cyclic rudder and elevator\n\xe2\x80\xa2 two degree of freedom tests, and\n\xe2\x80\x93 collective throttle and elevator\n\xe2\x80\x93 cyclic rudder and elevator\n\xe2\x80\xa2 bounded unconstrained tests\n\xe2\x80\x93 collective throttle and elevator\n\xe2\x80\x93 cyclic rudder and elevator\nApproach\nThese tests follow a similar progression to the RTP\ntests. All satellites are tuned using previously collected data and bench tested to con\xef\xac\x81rm all hardware,\nsoftware, and sensors are working properly.\nTaxi Test: The \xef\xac\x81rst test is a taxi test. Just like\nbefore, all the satellites will throttle up to around\n90-95% of their cruising speed and will taxi around\nthe pole. The feedback control will be active on all\nthree satellites. While taxiing the satellites will have\nthe same elevation, so there will be minimal elevator\ncommands. There is no outer-loop command that\nadjusts the relative heading, so there will be minimal rudder commands. The main demonstration\n\n79\nwill focus on the feedback controlled throttle commands to determine if the control law can maintain\nequal spacing between satellites and track a given\nhub angular rate.\nEqual Spacing: Once the taxi test has been successfully completed, the next incremental step takes\nthe vehicles o\xef\xac\x80 the ground. The hub is still constrained in all DOF except for vertical rotation. The\nreference signal increases the angular rate of the central hub, and the controller will ramp up the throttle to track the increased angular rate. Once the\nsatellites attain cruising speed they will lift o\xef\xac\x80. The\nfeedback controller is responsible for all the innerloop commands for each satellite, so the operator\nis solely responsible for adjusting the hub angular\nrate. The collected data will be analyzed and evaluate how e\xef\xac\x80ective the system maintained equal spacing. Any de\xef\xac\x81ciencies or errors will be simulated to\nobserve how those errors would impact an unconstrained system. If the data re\xef\xac\x82ects positively, then\nthe next round of testing begins.\nCollective Commands: With equal spacing accomplished, the next tests perform more elaborate\ncoordinated \xef\xac\x82ight maneuvers that will be used for\nouter-loop control. The hub is still constrained to\na single degree of freedom while the four outer-loop\nmodes are evaluated. The tests begin with collective modes because they are easier to observe. The\n\xef\xac\x81rst test is collective throttle because it most closely\nresembles the previous set of tests. The system is\nramped up to hover equilibrium state, and a reference command increases the angular rate of the\ncentral hub. When the satellites exceed their cruise\nspeed, additional lift is generated and the vehicle will\nincrease altitude. The next test runs collective elevator commands. When the system is in equilibrium,\nthe operator increases the elevator reference signal,\nand the satellites begin to climb together. Collected\ndata will evaluate whether the satellites maintain the\nsame elevation and attitude during their ascent.\nCyclic Commands: After demonstrating collective commands, attention turns toward cyclic commands. Cyclic rudder is more stable that the elevator, so begin there. The system is brough to hover,\nand the operator commands a cyclic rudder command. Because the pole constrains the system, there\n\nCHAPTER 5. PROTOTYPE TESTING PLAN\nwill be very little to observe onsite. However, the\ncollected data should reveal whether the satellites\nchange their relative headings in a cyclic manner.\nThe \xef\xac\x81nal one DOF test is cyclic elevator which tilts\nthe entire plane of rotation. Once in hover, the operator applies the command and the satellites will alter their elevations cyclically. The data should show\nthat each satellite attains a low and high point at\nthe same locations. It should also show that each\nsatellite achieves the same elevation changes while\nnavigating around the hub.\nRelaxed Degree of Freedom: After successfully\ndemonstrating coordinated \xef\xac\x82ight with a single DOF\nhub, the next series of tests relax the number of constraints on the hub. The pole hardware is replaced\nso the hub is free to both rotate and translate about\nthe vertical axis. The testing process is repeated for\neach of the four outer-loop control modes to make\nsure the feedback control is working as expected.\nThe two DOF hub will shed more useful insight on\nthe collective commands because they both in\xef\xac\x82uence\nthe vertical translation of the system.\nBounded Free Flight: Demonstrating the horizontal translation is accomplished with the bounded\nfree \xef\xac\x82ight test. This test replaces the central hub\nconnection. Rather than a bearing mounted on\nthe pole, the central hub is fashioned as an annular ring. The ring is larger than the pole diameter\nso the hub is free to roll, pitch, and translate horizontally. This closely resembles unconstrained free\n\xef\xac\x82ight dynamics, but still has the added security of\nplacing a boundary on the central hub. Again, each\nof the four outer-loop control modes is tested under these new constraints, and data is reviewed to\nmake sure the system is well behaved. To further\nreduce the amount of risk, moving into a fully unconstrained free \xef\xac\x82ight, several rings of various diameters can be constructed to adjust the boundary\ndistance. Smaller rings o\xef\xac\x80er more security by limiting the range of motion. Once the system response\nbehaves as expected, larger rings can showcase the\nunconstrained system dynamics.\n\n80\nfree \xef\xac\x82ight of the CSR system. This series of test\nmarks the completion of each prototype, so the information gathered here is intended to aid in the\nnext prototype development.\nDescription\nThese tests are run on the complete CSR vehicle.\nThe training wheels have been removed, and it is\ntime to see the big picture at work. All the avionics, hardware and sensors are the same for the satellite vehicles. The annular ring for the central hub\nhas been replaced with the preferred embodiment of\na convex cylindrical housing. The hub components\nare identical to the previous testing. Early tests will\ntake o\xef\xac\x80 with the satellite arms fully extended, but\nmore sophisticated prototypes may include a tether\nretraction mechanism for take o\xef\xac\x80 and landing.\nObjectives\nUnlike previous tests which were focused on developing capabilities needed for the control system, the\nobjectives of the free \xef\xac\x82ight tests are more speci\xef\xac\x81c\nto the individual prototype being tested. The focus\nof this testing is to acquire enough insight to aid\nthe development of the next prototype, which will\nhave di\xef\xac\x80erent objectives from one prototype to the\nnext. However, there are many commonalities that\nare shared among all the prototypes. Testing robustness to disturbances, waypoint navigation, and\ncontroller optimality are all accomplished with the\nfree \xef\xac\x82ight tests. The major goals of the free \xef\xac\x82ight\ntests are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nevaluate system robustness to disturbances,\ndemonstrate waypoint navigation,\nimplement optimal control techniques,\nassess e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of adaptive control,\nmeasure dynamics of outer-loop control modes.\n\nApproach\n\nNow that the system is \xef\xac\x82ying on its own, this set of\ntesting focuses on pushing the boundaries of the ve5.3.3 Free Flight\nhicle capbilities. Determining what the current sysPrevious testing paved the way for the pinnacle of tem is capable of is necessary information to progress\nthe prototype tests: the completely unconstrained to the next prototype design.\n\nCHAPTER 5. PROTOTYPE TESTING PLAN\nDisturbance Rejection: After \xef\xac\x82ying with the\nproverbial safety net from the constrained tests, the\n\xef\xac\x81rst order of business will assess how robust the system is to disturbances. Wind gusts are the most\nnotable disturbances the system must reject. However, the size of the vehicle makes outdoor \xef\xac\x82ying a\nnecessity, which is impossible to create a completely\ncontrolled environment. Furthermore, generating a\nstatic wind disturbance that acts on the entire vehicle is infeasible. As an alternative, a series of controlled experiments is presented. Consider a wind\ngust acting on the nose of a satellite. This creates\na force that acts longitudinally. Force can also be\napplied longitudinally by adjusting the throttle command. To test this type of disturbance, code is added\nwhich scales up or down the motors outside the control loop. The control law is unaware of the motor\nscaling, and only acts on the measurements which\nindicate a tracking error. A similar test may evaluate the elevator channel by dropping a mass in the\nmiddle of a \xef\xac\x82ight. The decreased payload simulates a\nforce acting in the vertical direction, which the elevator must mitigate. These experiments can be easily\nmodeled in the simulation environment, so collected\ndata may further validate the computer model.\nWaypoint Navigation: Knowing how much disturbance can be rejected leads into the next round\nof testing: waypoint navigation. Thus far, everything has focused on maintaining a hover equilibrium state. This test will assess the system dynamics outside of the hover condition. The test is extremely straight forward; start the vehicle in one\nlocation and command it to go to another point.\nThe controller will be designed to have some prescribed response characteristics, like rise time, overshoot, damping ratio, etc. The goal is to compare\n\n81\nthe physical response to the prescribed dynamics and\ncon\xef\xac\x81rm that the controller is implementing the desired closed-loop dynamics.\nOptimal Control: Once the vehicle is able to navigate to a new position, the next most pertinent issue\nis how e\xef\xac\x83ciently it gets there. Early controllers use\npole placement which exactly speci\xef\xac\x81es the characteristic response. This strategy was used to reduce\nthe risk with early \xef\xac\x82ights by giving the controller\nenough authority to overcome any unexpected disturbances or modeling errors. However, this added\nsecurity comes at the price of increased control energy. For an eternal \xef\xac\x82ight vehicle, minimizing the\namount of control e\xef\xac\x80ort is a primary consideration.\nRather than using a pole placement feedback controller, the next test will implement an optimized\ncontrol law where the gains are obtained through a\nlinear quadratic regulator (LQR) design. The experiment runs the system with the same waypoint\nnavigation, but collects data on the control signals\nused to navigate to that point.\nAdaptive Control Assessment: Adaptive control\nis an important control technique to mitigate modeling uncertainty for both the prototype development\nand for the \xef\xac\x81nal full scale CSR vehicle. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of the adaptive\ncontroller is important to ensure stability and avoid\nunacceptable transient responses. Previous system\nidenti\xef\xac\x81cation tests yield the actual plant model dynamics. For this test, the controller gains are designed with slightly erroneous values. The controller\nshould recognize that there is modeling error and\nadapt to the correct characteristics. Because the correct vehicle dynamics are already known, the adaptation can be evaluated against the true parameters.\n\nChapter 6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Centrifugally Sti\xef\xac\x80ened Rotor (CSR) concept\nis a unique con\xef\xac\x81guration approach that has never\npreviously been attempted, which could fundamentally lead to a new approach for High Altitude Long\nEndurance (HALE) or ATmospheric Satellite (ATSat) missions. AT-Sats map into many missions that\nexisting GEO and LEO satellites simply can not perform, and in particular AT-Sats align with missions\nwere communication transmission time needs to be\nminimized for such capabilities as omni-present wireless broadband.\nThe CSR signi\xef\xac\x81cantly improved structural and\naerodynamic e\xef\xac\x83ciency open up the design space to\nbecome more feasible, with initial analysis indicating that feasibility may be possible through this concept approach in combination with energy storage of\nabout 400 Whr/kg and thin-\xef\xac\x81lm solar cells around\n35%. Feasibility relates to accomplishing year round\nmissions at high U.S. latitudes.\nThe Phase I research focused on developing analysis tools capable of capturing the unique attributes\nof this multibody approach, including aerodynamic,\nstructural, force balance, and power required. Performance comparisons were made with other HALE\ntool sets used in the analysis of DARPA Vulture concepts, as well as calibrations of the new tools to the\nmost similar concepts.\nThe initial performance analysis indicates a reduction in power required on the order of 35% compared to the prior QinetiQ Zephyr 7 HALE en-\n\ndurance record holder, with the Zephyr carrying less\nthan a 5% payload fraction compared to the CSR\nconcept with a 10% payload.\nA number of compelling missions have been identi\xef\xac\x81ed that map directly into the unique capabilities\nof this advanced concept. Missions include:\nMulti-Functional Airborne Wind and Surveillance Commercial Platforms at Lower Altitudes:\nAerial platforms that operate at altitudes up\nto 2000 ft altitude (without FAA impediment\nof operational feasibility) that can both capture\nwind energy more e\xef\xac\x80ectively than ground-based\nwind turbines, and provide close proximity surveillance/communications with a coverage diameter of\n50 miles. The CSR concept has the potential to\nachieve a higher Lift/Drag ratio compared to other\nairborne wind concepts, which results in higher\ntether angles and less land area underneath the vehicle radius of operation that depends on incoming\nwind direction. O\xef\xac\x80-shore application is particularly\nappealing since a CSR aerial vehicle would eliminate\nthe need for a large/expensive mooring platform,\nwhich is required for ground-based wind turbines.\nThe ability of this concept to have a non-moving\ntether from the ground to the center hub permits the\ninertial connection to be less complex than current\nairborne wind turbines. Potentially this mission concept could be applied all the way down to the level\nof distributed residential power production, with a\nsUAS sized version likely capable of providing 2 to\n\n82\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS\n5 kW of power at altitudes of 500 feet with average\nwind speeds of less than 20 mph.\nDistributed Aperture AT-Sat Observatory: The\nCSR concept provides a large rotating structure, as\nwell as large volume at the center hub, with the capability of operation above the majority of the atmosphere. Integrating high resolution, compact, linked\noptic sensors (such as the Low Mass Planar Photonic\nImaging Sensor currently being developed as Phase\nII NIAC research) at the tip and root of each rotorwing will permit a rotating imaging array across a\nfull 600 diameter azimuth. Combining this with a\nlower resolution conventional imaging system in the\ncenter hub for image \xef\xac\x81lling could provide a resolution\nnever before possible. Such an observatory could\nbe designed as a dual-purpose system that provides\nimaging both upwards for space investigations, as\nwell as for Earth imaging.\nExtra-Planetary Compact VTOL Exploration\nPlatforms: A version of the CSR concept has been\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed that enables full retraction of the rotorwing to achieve a highly compact VTOL vehicle\nthat can operate at extremely low discloading (<0.03\nlb/ft2) on atmospheres such as Mars that have atmospheric densities similar to Earth at 100,000 feet\naltitude. Because it was highly uncertain whether\nthe centrifugal sti\xef\xac\x80ening loads would be su\xef\xac\x83cient\nto maintain a rigid rotor-wing for this highly faceted\nspanwise design, a sub-scale version of the rotor-wing\nwas fabricated and tested with success. The rotorwing experiences an increase in weight and complexity with a decrement in performance to achieve compact packaging, however was shown to be a feasible approach that could facilitate very low discloading renewable VTOL aerial vehicles which could be\npackaged e\xef\xac\x80ectively in an aeroshell.\n\n83\nSince the performance analysis indicates a compelling advantage for this concept, the Phase I research focused on addressing the key risk area for\nthis concept, establishing that vehicle control is feasible for this multibody dynamics problem. A complete derivation was presented which outlined how\nthe CSR is modeled, the dynamics that dictate the\nequations of motion of the system, and a means of\ntrimming and linearizing the system. This transitioned into the theory needed to control this particular vehicle, and simulations demonstrated the controller response implemented on the nonlinear system. The key hurdle to overcome from the controls\npoint of view, is maintaining control when the exact\nrelative position of the satellite is unknown. Estimation and reduced order estimators were shown to be\nable to overcome this, because the CSR vehicle was\ndetermined to be both fully controllable and fully\nobservable. Furthermore, the system dynamics can\nbe arbitrarily selected to meet any desired response\nwithin the limits of the actuators. Finally, parameter estimation and adaptive control techniques can\nbe applied to this type of vehicle.\nA sub-scale \xef\xac\x82ight demonstrator at the 30 lbf\ngross weight size has been initiated to validate the\nability of the control system to accommodate real\nworld disturbances as well as winds and maintain\nstable \xef\xac\x82ight. Additionally, the sub-scale prototype\npermits other study assumptions to be addressed,\nsuch as the mechanical complexity of the tether reelin/out system which has not been analyzed. This\ndemonstrator e\xef\xac\x80ort will continue as part of the PhD\ndissertation for the lead control researcher, and be\ncompleted prior to a follow-on proposal for Phase II\nresearch.\n\nCentrifugally Stiffened Rotor (CSR):\nAvionics Board Development\nJustin M. Selfridge\nMonday, June 15th, 2015\n\nAbstract\xe2\x80\x94 A comprehensive report outlined the modeling and simulation work performed for the Centrifugally\nStiffened Rotor (CSR) concept vehicle. Since that time,\nthe majority of the research effort focused on developing\nthe avionics hardware that serves as a \xef\xac\x82ight controller for\nthe CSR prototype and full scale vehicles. This document\noutlines the work performed and the outcomes from that\nresearch effort.\n\nThis summary describes the progress with the avionics development. The hardware is run on a BeagleBone\nBlack single board computer, which runs the Linux\noperating system. It describes the Device Tree Overlays\n(DTO) that are available to con\xef\xac\x81gure the pinmux settings, the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins,\nthe UARTs which allow for wireless communication\nbetween the satellites and the Ground Control Station\n(GCS), the set of Programmable Realtime Units (PRU)\nwhich deliver realtime 5 nanosecond clock cycles, and\na Xenomai cokernel which executes timing commands\nin real time.\nI. P LATFORM\n\navionics controller, reliable timing is essential because\nthe radio inputs and motor outputs cannot be delayed.\nThis is accomplished through Xenomai; a type of cokernel which runs along-side the actual kernel, and\nproperly manages system interrupts to make the Linux\nOS adhere to hard realtime constraints. In the past few\nmonths, the embedded Linux community has come a\nlong way in making Xenomai accessible by integrating Xenomai into the general kernel building population. This eliminated a lot of compatibility issues,\nand greatly reduced the number of patches to enable\nXenomai. The BBB is running Xenomai, so a low level\nOS commands will not interfere with reading a sensor\nor setting a motor value.\nIII. D EVICE T REE OVERLAYS (DTO)\nEach pin on the BBB can be assigned different functionality which makes the board extremely modular.\nA Device Tree Overlay (DTO) is a type of code that\ndescribes how all the pins are con\xef\xac\x81gured on the board.\nThe overlay describes what the pin is sued for and\nassigns appropriate settings for the particular hardware\nit is associated with. The Device Tree Compiler (DTC)\nis a special type of compiler that convert the humanreadable source code into the binary object. For this\nproject, a DTO was created which enabled four UARTs,\ntwo I2C, two PRU, four LEDs, and several GPIOs.\n\nThe controller for the CSR vehicle runs on a single\nboard computer called the BeagleBone Black (BBB).\nThis board runs linux OS and has two header rails\nfor fast prototype development. The Linux kernel on\nthe BBB was updated to 3.14 which includes PWM,\nI2C, and SPI interfacing, and makes the device tree\noverlay (DTO) easier to implement. Each pin on the\nboard can serve different functions based on how the\nDTO is loaded at start up. The default setting uses many\npins for HDMI and eMMc chip allocations, which are\nneeded for the avionics development. Those pieces of\nhardware were disabled so their respective pins could\nbe used for other purposes, like serial communication\nand PWM input and output.\n\nA general purpose input/output (GPIO) pin does not\nperform any form of communication protocol, and it is\nnot associated with any particular piece of hardware.\nRather, it is a very simple pin that can be con\xef\xac\x81gured\nto either read a voltage as an input signal, or to set a\nvoltage as an output signal. The avionics board uses\nfour LEDs to communicate the status of the system,\nand it has a button input enabled to read user inputs.\n\nII. X ENOMAI C OKERNEL\n\nV. UART S ERIAL COMMUNICATION\n\nA crucial step for the avionics hardware is ensuring\nthe Linux OS runs in realtime. When running an\n\nThe CSR will need to communicate between each\nof the three satellites and a base station, so wireless\n\nIV. G ENERAL P URPOSE I NPUT /O UTPUT (GPIO)\n\ncommunication is required. The BBB has several communications protocols, but UART was selected for this\napplication because it is the protocol used by XBee RF\nradio systems, which have very reliable signals within\na small form factor. Four UARTS were enabled and\ncommunicating to each other on the BBB. Thus, there\nare enough serial ports con\xef\xac\x81gured to run the system\nand maintain communication with home base.\nVI. MPU9150 9DOF IMU S ENSOR\nTo implement the controls algorithm, the vehicle\nmust be aware of its state. This is accomplished with\na nine degree of freedom (DOF) inertial measurement\nunit (IMU), called the MPU9150 from InvenSense. It\nhas three axis output for magnetometer, rate gyro, and\naccelerometer readings. This board has the added bene\xef\xac\x81t of a 10th channel that can be used to read altitude\nreadings from an external sensor, and an additional\nI2C bus so a second IMU (for redundancy and data\nfusion) can communicate over the same channel. It\ncan output attitude in both Euler (nice for debugging)\nand quaternion (better for actual application to prevent\ngimbal lock) formats. The sensor has been connected to\nthe BBB where raw data values are processed through\na data fusion \xef\xac\x81lter algorithm to yield the vehicle state.\nVII. P ROCESSING R EALTIME U NITS (PRU)\nAnother major task requires reading inputs from a radio, and sending outputs to electronic speed controllers\n(ESC). Both signals use a form of pulse width modulation (PWM), which a type of square wave signal with a\n\xef\xac\x81xed period and a variable duty cycle. Accomplishing\nthis required accessing the two Processing Realtime\nUnits (PRU) which are dedicated chips that runs in\nrealtime (and not subject to delays from the Linux\nuserspace OS) with a 5 nanosecond clock cycle. This\nproject requires both subsystems to read radio PWM\ninputs and to send high \xef\xac\x81delity PWM outputs to the\nESCs. Working with the PRU requires the assembly\nprogramming language, which is a set of about 30\ncommands that manipulate individual bits directly on\nthe chip\xe2\x80\x99s register, hence the nickname \xe2\x80\x9dbit banging\xe2\x80\x9d.\nFollowing TI\xe2\x80\x99s instruction set, both PRU subsystems\nwere enabled, able to load the assemble code, able to\ncontrol both the input and output registers, and able\nto con\xef\xac\x81gure the register memory allocation to send\ncommands from user-space down into kernel-space.\nVIII. PRU BASED S ERVO O UTPUTS\nAssembly code has been developed to produce PWM\noutputs. One register is used to maintain the total\n\nnumber of steps for the duration of a PWM pulse. Eight\nmore registers are used as counters for the duration\nof a particular channel. At the start of a new loop,\nall the output pins are set to high, and the code runs\nthrough a loop which decreases the count each loop.\nWhen a counter decrements to zero, the output pin of\nthat channel is set to low. AT the pins are reset back\nto high at the start of a new loop.\nIX. PRU BASED R ADIO I NPUTS\nAssembly code has been developed to read PWM\ninputs. One register is used to maintain the bits that\ndescribe the previous state of a channel. Eight more\nregisters are used as counters for the duration of a particular channel. Assume an input channel is currently\nlow, and the counter is set to zero. When the signal goes\nhigh, the counter increments upwards. At some point\nthe signal will drop low. If the previous state was set to\nhigh, the code passes out the counter value, clears the\ncounter value, and resets the bit for the previous state.\nThe output value is used to determine the value of the\ninput coming in from the radio.\nX. C ODE D EVELOPMENT\nAll the individual pieces of hardware need to be\nconnected together under a single set of code. The\navionics code initializes the vehicle, runs a continuous\nloop during the \xef\xac\x82ight, and shuts down the system when\nprompted. The start up code sets all motor values to off,\ninitializes the sensors, and clears the buffer for data\nlogging. The code looks for several different user input\ncommands that specify different \xef\xac\x82ight scenarios (data\ncollection, system identi\xef\xac\x81cation, etc), and commands to\narm the motors. The main loop has several sub-loops\nthat run at different frequencies. The fastest frequency\nis for IMU data, controller commands, and ESC outputs\nto the motors and servos (this is the inner loop control\nfor the satellites). The next loop monitors the hub state\nand waypoint navigation (this is the outer control loop\nfor the vehicle). The slowest loop is setup to handle\ndata logging, performance monitoring, and any other\nnon-critical tasks. The code also has an exit command,\nwhich disables the motors, completes the data logging\nprocess, and signals the end of the cycle through an\nexternal LED. The entire project is developed in the\nC programming language to maintain fast execution\ntimes. The major functions are compartmentalized into\nstatic libraries so that features can be easily ported to\nother other prototype vehicles.\n\nXI. B ENCH T ESTING\nAll the individual capabilities have been transferred\nover onto a single development board. The data log and\nrealtime constraints were tested together, where running\nempty code (no controller, data logging only) was able\nto achieve 1000 Hz sample rate, and 30 minutes of\ndata logging used less than two percent of the available\ndisk space. The radio and speed controllers were tested\ntogether, where the PRU signals were passed through\nlogic level converters to convert between the 3.3V used\nby the BBB and the 5.0V used by the equipment. The\nIMU was tested with the data fusion algorithm, where\nraw data was compared to the fused data, and gain\nvalues were adjusted to optimal values to overcome\nsensor noise. Finally, a simple PID controller was\ndeveloped to evaluate a complete system which combines, inputs, outputs, states, and data logging into a\nsingle demonstration. The controller makes appropriate\nadjustments based on the state and control inputs, so\nthe avionics board development is complete.\n\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AEROSPACE\n\nContract Number:

INTRODUCTION\nThe D8 aircraft concept is one of several high-performance designs being considered for the next\ngeneration of transport aircraft. Several studies have been previously commissioned to investigate\nits flight performance in cruise configurations. The present effort is focused on the analysis of the\nD8.5 model in high-lift configurations using flaps. Since a design for the flap to be used on this\nmodel does not currently exist, this effort encapsulates the design and integration of a simple\nslotted flap to the main wing of the D8.5 design.\nHowever, considering the geometry of the flap relative to the wing under different deflection\nangles, a translation of the flap is required to match each deflection angle. This translation has a\ndirect effect on the aerodynamics of the flap-wing combination and is therefore not arbitrary. An\naero-mechanical trade study must be conducted to establish the near-optimum positioning of the\nflap. The focus of this report remains solely in the aerodynamic aspects of the gap size and ideal\nmechanical and motion constraints are established. A detailed discussion on this is presented\nfurther in the report.\nThe aerodynamics of the D8.5 flaps configuration is conducted using the FlightStream TM surface\nvorticity numerical solver in conjunction with the open-source NASA Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP)\nsoftware. FlightStreamTM is a proprietary software of the Research in Flight Company and uses the\nsurface meshing capabilities of VSP to provide a fast, accurate solution to subsonic flow problems.\nIt is capable of using structured and unstructured surface meshes and this capability allows\neffective integration with VSP.\n\n3\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nSurfaced-vorticity based potential-flow methods have not been used extensively for flapped wing\ngeometries. For this reason, the validity of FlightStreamTM in this genre of aerodynamic analysis\nmust be established. Research in Flight has identified some NACA, AIAA and NASA datasets\nbelieved to be appropriate for the requested validation portion of this study 1-4. These test cases are\nsummarized in Table-2.1. For each case, the test model is evaluated for an angle of attack sweep\nfor both lift and drag conditions. Compressibility models are used for all three cases. However,\nconsidering the low Mach number regimes involved, the contribution of compressibility is minor.\nThe validation process involved the creation of the geometry, surface meshing in either VSP or\nFlightStreamTM and the collection and comparison of aerodynamic lift and drag data for an angle\nof attack sweep. Three different geometries were used in the validation process and are shown in\nTable-1.\nTest case\nAdvanced General\nAviation Wing\nNASA Trap Wing\nDLR-F11\n\nTable-2.1: Test cases for the validation effort\nSource\nNASA TN D-8236\n1ST AIAA CFD High Lift Prediction Workshop (HLPW1)\n2ND AIAA CFD High Lift Prediction Workshop (HLPW2)\n\nFlap type\nSemi-span /\nFowler\nFull-span /\nFowler\n\nSlats?\nNo\n\nFull-span /\nFowler\n\nYes / Fullspan\n\nYes / Fullspan\n\n2.1 The Advanced General Aviation Wing (AGAW)\nThis geometry was obtained from the experimental work done for the NASA TN D-8236 report.\nThe geometry information as well as flight conditions and aerodynamic data are extracted from\nthis report and used for comparison with FlightStreamTM results. The AGAW wing as tested in\nNASA TN D-8236, consisted of an asymmetric high-lift configuration and included spoilers on\none side of the wing while employing flaps on both ends. The configuration was tested in the\nLangley V/STOL tunnel in support of the ATLIT aircraft program to determine the general\ncharacteristics of an ATLIT-type Fowler flap and spoiler lateral-control system and the\nexperimental setup is described in NASA TN D-8236.\nThe geometry is shown in Figure-2.1.1(a-c). The flap model used for this wing was a semi-span\nFowler design and the airfoil for both the wing and flap are extracted from the basic GA(W)-1\nairfoil. The wing had a span of 4.01 m (13.16 ft.), a chord of 0.45 m (1.46 ft.), and an area of 1.79\nm2 (19.31 ft2). When the flaps were fully deflected, the wing area was increased by 17 percent to\n2.10 m2 (22.59 ft2). The wing root was at an incidence of 20 and the wing was linearly twisted to\na tip incidence of 0\xc2\xb0. The experimental data was corrected for tunnel wall effects. No other\ncorrections were applied. Most of the data were obtained at a dynamic pressure of 1.44 kPa (30\nlbf/ft2). Additional data was obtained at a dynamic pressure of 0.48 kPa (10 lbf/ft2). The Reynolds\nnumbers corresponding to these dynamic pressures are 1.49\xc3\x97106 and 0.85\xc3\x97106, respectively.\n\n4\n\nFigure-2.1.1: The Advanced General Aviation Wing (AGAW) geometry and experimental layout\n\nThe geometry and surface mesh used for the flow solution in FlightStream TM has been simplified\nfrom the experimental setup on account of unavailable experimental data on the mount, walls and\nmechanical joints and testing appendages on the wing. However, this simplification was found not\nto affect the solution in any significant manner. The surface mesh was generated in FlightStreamTM\nusing the extruder tool, which generates an aligned mesh suited for extrusion surfaces such as\nwings. One major simplification from the setup standpoint was to ignore the stowed spoilers as\n\n5\n\nbeing a geometric entity. Since the data was collected and compared with the spoilers stowed, this\nwas not an egregious simplification and, as results show, did not significantly affect the\naerodynamic results. However, an advantage of this design choice resulted in the treatment of the\nentire wing as symmetric as the spoilers were the only geometric entities that were causing\nasymmetry as seen Figure-2.1.1. This symmetric geometry takes advantage of the FlightStreamTM\nsymmetric boundary condition to significantly speed up the solver run time. The FlightStreamTM\nsurface mesh is shown in Figure-2.1.2 about the symmetry plane. The resulting surface mesh had\n2,470 triangle faces and 1,238 quadrilateral faces after solver initialization using the\nFlightStreamTM quad mesher.\n\nFigure-2.1.2: The AGAW surface mesh as generated by the FlightStreamTM extruder tool (left) and after\nsolver initialization through the quad mesher (right) for a flap deflection of 10\xc2\xb0\n\nThe solver was run in parallel on 2 processors and required ~45 seconds for each angle-of-attack\nflow convergence. Aerodynamic data in the deployed flap configuration for 10\xc2\xb0, 20\xc2\xb0 and 30\xc2\xb0\ndeflections are compared with FlightStreamTM results in Figure-2.1.3. The aerodynamic lift and\ndrag coefficients for the angle of attack sweep from -4\xc2\xb0 to 10\xc2\xb0 are found to be in good agreement\nwith the experimental values for all three deflections.\n\nFigure-2.1.3: Lift and Drag coefficients for the AGAW geometry for various flap deflection settings\n\n2.2 NASA Trap Wing Geometry\nThe NASA Trap Wing geometry was obtained from the AIAA 1ST High Lift Prediction Workshop\n(HLPW-1), organized in 2010. The focus of this workshop is on the use of CFD to simulate the\n\n6\n\naerodynamics of high-lift configurations. As such, the geometry and surface mesh data are\nprovided. However, a surface mesh must be generated from the geometry which is available in\nCAD format. The NASA Trap-Wing as tested experimentally is shown in Figure-2.2.1.\n\nFigure-2.2.1: NASA Trap Wing Geometry in the wind tunnel (Image reference: AIAA HLPW-1)\n\nThere are three configurations of the flap for the HLPW-1 analysis, as shown in Figure-2.2.2. The\nConfiguration-8 setup is used for this effort and modeling is done to include both the slats and\nflaps. For this configuration, the flap deflection angle is 20\xc2\xb0 and the slat deflection angle is 30\xc2\xb0.\n\nFigure-2.2.2: Configurations for the NASA Trap Wing Geometry\n\nThe free-stream conditions are near incompressible with a very low Mach number (M=0.2). The\nexperimental angle-of-attack sweep used is from 0\xc2\xb0 to 37\xc2\xb0 at a Reynolds number of 4.3\xc3\x97106 using\nthe mean-aerodynamic-chord. The reference temperature is 520R. The experimental data is\ncorrected for free-air conditions. The reference area is 22.028 ft2 and the mean aerodynamic chord\nis 39.634 in.\n\n7\n\nSeveral simplification assumptions are made from this setup similar to the AGAW geometry\nanalysis from section-2.1 of this report. Namely, the symmetry plane condition can be enforced to\nmimic the tunnel configuration as seen in Figure-2.2.1. Additionally, the exposed mechanical\ncomponents of the flap (as seen in Figure-2.2.1) are not modeled in the FlightStreamTM geometry\nand certain deviations from the solution are expected as a result. Meshing in FlightStream resulted\nin the use of the extruder for aligned meshes on the slat, wing and flap. An unstructured surface\nmesh was generated on the body pod and the floor of the tunnel was simulated through the use of\nthe symmetry plane boundary. The resulting surface meshes are shown in Figure-2.2.3. The\nresulting surface mesh had 5,030 triangle faces and 3,062 quadrilateral faces after solver\ninitialization using the FlightStreamTM quad mesher (78.25% quad recovery).\n\nFigure-2.2.3: The NASA Trap-Wing surface mesh as generated by the FlightStreamTM extruder tool (left)\nand after solver initialization through the quad mesher (right) for Configuration-8\n\nThe solver was run in parallel on 2 processors and required ~150 seconds for each angle-of-attack\nflow convergence. The Surface vorticity solution for 5\xc2\xb0 angle-of-attack is shown in Figure-2.2.4\nwith the relaxed wake vorticity strands. Aerodynamic data for Configuration-8 are compared with\nFlightStreamTM results in Figure-2.2.5(a-b). The numerical results are found to be in good\nagreement with the experimental values for all three deflections.\n\nFigure-2.2.4: Surface vorticity and trailing strands for the Trap Wing Configuration-8 at 5\xc2\xb0 angle-of-attack\n\nFigure-2.2.5(a) compares the lift coefficient with the angle of attack sweep. It is noted straight\naway that FlightStreamTM captures the correct linear slope of the curve. FlightStreamTM has a\nsmall zero-offset with the experiment and over-predicts the lift slightly. These results are found to\n\n8\n\nbe within acceptable limits for a potential environment solution. Similarly, the drag results shown\nin Figure-2.2.5(b) compare favorably with experiment. The over-prediction in lift is carried\nforward into this figure as well and changes the shape of the lift-drag curve slightly. Even so, the\nresults are found to be well within accepted error limits for a potential flow solver. Note that the\nangle of attack sweep for the numerical results were maintained within limits of the potential flow\nregion of the geometry. Beyond 35\xc2\xb0 angle of attack, the flow is found to separate completely on\nthe wing and the results cannot be evaluated using a potential flow solver. The separation and\ncorresponding transition regions are clearly seen in Figure-2.2.5 beyond 30\xc2\xb0 angle of attack.\n\nFigure-2.2.5(a-b): Numerical and Experimental aerodynamic results for the NASA Trap-Wing geometry\n\n2.3 DLR-F11 Geometry\nThe DLR-F11 geometry was obtained from the AIAA 2ND High Lift Prediction Workshop\n(HLPW-2), organized in 2013. The focus of this workshop is on the use of CFD to simulate the\naerodynamics of typical commercial aviation aircraft in high-lift configurations. Similar to HLPW1, the basic geometry data is provided. However, a surface mesh must be generated from the\ngeometry which is available in CAD format. The DLR-F11 as tested experimentally is shown in\nFigure-2.3.1. The geometry includes both flaps and slats extended on a multi-section wing through\nthe span. The configuration provided includes the slat at 26.5\xc2\xb0 and the flap at 32\xc2\xb0 deflections in\ntheir deployed state.\nThe free-stream conditions are near incompressible with a very low Mach number (M=0.175). The\nexperimental angle-of-attack sweep used is from 0\xc2\xb0 to 25\xc2\xb0 at a Reynolds number of 15.1\xc3\x97106 using\nthe mean-aerodynamic-chord. The experimental data is corrected for free-air conditions. The\nreference area is 419.13 mm2 and the mean aerodynamic chord is 347.09 mm.\n\n9\n\nFigure-2.3.1: The DLR-F11 geometry as imported into the FlightStreamTM solver\n\nOnce again, similar to the NASA Trap-Wing model, several simplification assumptions are made\nto the DLR-F11 simulation model. Namely, the symmetry plane condition can be enforced to\nmimic the tunnel configuration as seen in Figure-2.3.2. Additionally, the exposed mechanical\ncomponents of the flap are not modeled in the FlightStreamTM geometry and certain deviations\nfrom the solution are expected.\n\nFigure-2.3.2: The DLR F11 in the wind tunnel\n\n10\n\nMeshing in FlightStream resulted in the use of the extruder for aligned meshes on the slat, wing\nand flap. An unstructured surface mesh was generated on the fuselage of the DLR-F11 and the\nfloor of the tunnel was simulated through the use of the symmetry plane boundary. The resulting\nquasi-valence surface mesh environment solved for in FlightStreamTM are shown in Figure-2.3.3.\nThe resulting surface mesh had 8,236 triangle faces and 5,355 quadrilateral faces after solver\ninitialization using the FlightStreamTM quad mesher (69.96% quad recovery).\n\nFigure-2.3.3: The quasi-valence surface mesh for the DLR-F11 as seen by the FlightStreamTM solver\n\nThe solver was run in parallel on 2 processors and required ~230 seconds for each angle-of-attack\nflow convergence. Aerodynamic loads for the DLR-F11 are compared with FlightStreamTM results\nin Figure-2.3.4(a-b). The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the\nexperimental values for all three deflections with two notable exceptions. The lift curve is found\nto become more accurate as the angle-of-attack increases, matching the zero-offset and slope of\nthe lift curve almost exactly after 5\xc2\xb0 angle-of-attack. However, lift values at lower angles are found\nto be close to the experimental data but do not match the correct slope of the curve. It is speculated\nthat the simplifications in the geometry lead to some variation in the results for the DLR-F11.\nAdditionally, it is also possible that some non-potential physics may be at play which contribute\nto the deviations noted in Figure-2.3.4(a).\n\n11\n\nFigure-2.3.5(a): Numerical and Experimental lift coefficient versus angle-of-attack for the DLR-F11 geometry\n\nFigure-2.3.5(b): Numerical and experiment lift versus drag results for the DLR-F11 geometry\n\n12\n\n3. BASELINE MODEL\n3.1 Geometry\nIn order to incorporate a single-slotted flap, the basic D8.5 geometry was modified. The D8.5 was\nprovided by NASA Langley to Research in Flight in the form of a VSP model (Figure-3.1.1).\nHowever, as the geometrical data required for modeling the details of the underside of the wing,\nthe stow area for the flap and the flap geometry was supplied by NASA separately, certain\nmodifications to the VSP D8.5 were made in FlightStreamTM.\n\nFigure-3.1.1: The initial D8.5 model without flaps\n\nGeometry changes in FlightStreamTM included the use of the extruder to create extrusion sections\nbetween the major sections of the wing and flap. The single-slotted flap was incorporated in the\nwing between 10.3% of the span (measured from the centerline of the fuselage) to 79.4% of the\nspan with a constant 28% of the local wing chord serving as the flap chord. The 79.4% span\nlocation also corresponded to the flap/aileron junction. The aileron was not modeled for this effort.\nThe resulting flap data is summarized in Table-3.1 and Appendix A.2 of this report.\nTable-3.1: The simple-slotted flap geometry parameters for the D8.5\n\nThe flap airfoil was evaluated for the nominal 28.0% local chord from the basic MIT NC-120\nairfoil used in the D8.5 wing. The chordwise refinement was based on the practices established for\nthe validation studies previously described in this report. The refinement was further driven by the\n\n13\n\nneed to have a suitable refinement in the opposing surfaces of the gap as shown in Figure-3.1.2 for\nthe stowed condition. This nominal refinement was used in the extrusion surfaces to generate\naligned meshes. The resulting surface meshes for the extruded flap and wing sections are shown\nin Figure-3.1.3. Note that FlightStreamTM was successful in generating solutions even with very\ncomplex geometric features including the cavity in front of the flap. Repaneling this section of\nthe lower surface of the wing to bridge the cavities was not required for the solver.\n\nFigure-3.1.2: Refinement nodes in the D8.5 flap mesh in stowed condition\n\nFigure-3.1.3(a): The D8.5 wing with flap in different positions during deployment\n\nFigure-3.1.3(b): Extrusion meshes generated for the D8.5 wing with flap\n\n14\n\n3.2 Flap Design\nThe flap design as implemented in this study differs from an operational flap in practice in certain\nways. The D8.5 main wing and flap are tapered. Hence rotation through compound angles are\ninvolved as the flap is simultaneously extended from a stowed position. Furthermore, rotation\nabout the leading edge is required for the trade study. To accomplish this the desired positioning\nfor each end profile was identified and a flap was extruded between the two end profiles.\nThe motion of the flap has been further simplified by locating a fixed rotation axis on the leading\nedge within the flap once the two ends of the flap has been translated to its position for a given\ndeflection angle. This rotation axis for the flap in the stowed condition is shown in Figure-3.2.1.\nSince the two ends of the flap translate independently, the flap encounters a negligible twist that\nwould not occur in practice.\n\nFigure-3.2.1: Translating rotation axis for the D8.5 flap\n\nFlightStreamTM allows users to create user defined coordinate frames and to associate them with\nmoving surfaces. This was utilized in this effort to mark the rotating axis of the flap in a local\nframe and to simply translate the frame as required. This decreases the simulation time for flap\ntrade study by eliminating significant user inputs.\n\n3.3 Experimental Validation\nThe baseline D8.5 with the stowed flaps was analyzed to ensure that no dramatic departures from\nthe clean wing configuration would emerge in the analysis. The geometry was evaluated for\naerodynamic loads for a range of angle of attack values as well as Mach numbers. The angle of\nattack sweep was from -3\xc2\xb0 to 4\xc2\xb0 and the corresponding Mach numbers were 0.2, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7,\n0.74, 0.77 and 0.8. Comparison was made with the Cart3D Euler CFD solver results for the same\ndataset and was provided by NASA Langley. A sample surface vorticity result for the D8.5\nbaseline model with stowed flaps at 2\xc2\xb0 angle of attack is shown in Figure-3.3.1. The reference\narea for the geometry tested was 1162 ft2. The reference length was 170 ft. and mean chord was\n8.12 ft.\n\n15\n\nFigure-3.3.1: Vorticity distribution on the D8.5 with stowed flaps at 2\xc2\xb0 angle of attack\n\nA quantitative representation of the baseline solutions using the stowed flapped geometry is shown\nin Figure-3.3.2(a-b). Generally good agreement with Cart 3D is seen to occur except at high Mach\nnumbers for the lift as a function of angle of attack and this disagreement is mostly an offset rather\nthan a slope issue. Because of this offset characteristic, the drag polar still agrees quite well with\nthe Cart 3D results, indicating that the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft has been captured.\n\nFigure-3.3.2(a): Lift versus angle of attack for the D8.5 baseline geometry\n\n16\n\nFigure-3.3.2(b): Lift versus drag for the D8.5 baseline geometry\n\n17\n\n4. FLAP MOTION DESIGN SPACE\nThe results for this effort focus on the calculation of lift and drag coefficients for three different\nflap settings: 15\xc2\xb0, 25\xc2\xb0, and 35\xc2\xb0. The trade study for the gap space is designed to take these three\ndeflection angles into account. As the flap rotates through these angles, the translation design space\nmust prevent the intersection of the flap with the lower surface of the wing. This criterion is critical\nin the selection of the design space.\nAs previously described in Section-3 of this report, the translation motions of the extrusion flap\nsurface was independent on the two ends of the flap. This allowed the creation of a unified,\nnormalized design space as shown in Figure-4.1. The shape of the design space in the X-Z plane\nis such that the flap does not intersect with the wing at any position within it. This condition also\ndetermines the minimum offset needed between the upper bounds of the design space and the\nlower surface of the wing.\n\nFigure-4.1: The normalized motion design space for the D8.5 flap\n\nSince the design space is unified for the two ends of the flap, it can be normalized using the local\nchord length to create the normalized design space shown in Figure-4.1. The translation space is\nrestricted to the X-Z planes on either end of the flap. During the trade study, the flap ends are\nmoved within this design space for each deflection angle to determine the optimum gap sizes. A\ncollection of the modeled flaps within this design space for the stowed flaps case is shown in\nFigure-4.2. Contour plots for the trade study based on these discrete solution locations are shown\nin the next section of this report.\n\nFigure-4.2: Cascaded flaps at different positions within the design space for the stowed case\n\n18\n\n5. RESULTS\nThe trade study involving looking at multiple flap locations within the established design space\nfor each deflection angle of the flap. Table-5.1 shows the various locations that were each tested\nfor the three flap deflection angles of 15\xc2\xb0, 25\xc2\xb0, and 35\xc2\xb0 and for each angle of attack sweep. Each\nflap is named on a two-digit number. The first digit specified its normalized location in the X\ndirection and the second digit specifies the normalized location in the -Z direction. For example,\nFlap-24 is located 2% of the local chord in the positive X direction compared to the baseline stowed\nposition and 4% of the local chord in the negative Z direction within the design space.\nTable 5.1: Trade study flap position data within the normalized design space\n\nThe sweep of locations shown in Table-5.1 required 52 FlightStreamTM solver runs for baseline\ncompressibility validation sweeps and 276 FlightStreamTM solver runs for the flaps trade study.\nEach run was conducted on parallel processors and required ~180 seconds for each angle of attack.\nThe overall trade study run time was therefore, ~15 hours.\nFigure-5.1 shows the lift-versus induced drag distribution for Flap-02 at different deflection\nangles. The results are typical for a flap configuration on a wing with each lift-drag curve offset to\nthe right as the deflection angle increases.\n\nFigure-5.1: Lift versus induced-drag for Flap-02 in the design space for different deflections\n\n19\n\nSimilar runs were completed for all of the flapped geometry cases and the results for nine flaps are\nshown summarily for an angle of attack sweep with a flap deflection angle of 15o in Figure-5.2(a).\nNotice that, as expected the slopes are essentially identical for all of the flaps but the offset changes\nwith flap position. The induced drag coefficient for the 15o angle setting is shown in Figure-5.2(b)\nfor the same set of flaps. Again the behavior is essentially identical for all of the flaps except for\nthe offset depending on flap location.\n\nFigure-5.2(a): Lift versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 15\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.2(b): Induced drag versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 15\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\n20\n\nA summary of the lift and induced drag coefficients for the 25\xc2\xb0 deflection for the nine flap cases\nis shown in Figure-5.3(a-b). As expected the lift and induced drag are higher than for the lower\nangle settings but the character of the solution is unchanged.\n\nFigure-5.3(a): Lift versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 25\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.3(b): Induced drag versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 25\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nA still further increase in the lift and induced drag is associated with the higher flap setting of 35o\nas shown in Figure-5.4(a-b). Again, we see linear aerodynamics at work for lift coefficient and a\nnonlinear induced drag with angle of attack as expected.\n\n21\n\nFigure-5.4(a): Lift versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 35\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.4(b): Induced drag versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 35\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nThe drag polars shown in Figure-5.5(a-c) for 15o, 25o and 35o offer some perspective on how lift\nclearly increases at increased deflection angles and increases to the highest values for the highest\ncombined flap deflection angles and angles of attack. This compound effect increases induced drag\nas expected and as represented by the fact that the curves move to the right as angle of attack is\n\n22\n\nincreased successively from (a) to (c), all as expected. This data is a quantification of how this\nexpected result is delivered by the D8.5 geometry.\n\nFigure-5.5(a): Lift versus induced drag for different flaps in the design space at 15\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.5(b): Lift versus induced drag for different flaps in the design space at 25\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\n23\n\nFigure-5.5(c): Lift versus induced drag for different flaps in the design space at 35\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.6(a-c) is another way to package the data from a pseudo aerodynamic efficiency\nperspective. In many cases, maximum lift to drag does not necessarily lead to the globally optimal\nsolution for a given design when other factors such as mass, takeoff distance, flutter or other\nperformance factors are considered. Nevertheless, this is an appropriate way to present the results\nof this purely aerodynamic performance based trade study. Since all cases in the trade study\ninvolve significant flap deflection angles, the lift is positive for all angles of attack and the peak\naerodynamic efficiency is near zero angle of attack.\n\nFigure-5.6(a): Lift-to-drag ratio versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 15\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\n24\n\nFigure-5.6(b): Lift-to-drag ratio versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 25\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nFigure-5.6(c): Lift-to-drag ratio versus angle of attack for different flaps in the design space at 35\xc2\xb0 deflection\n\nThe plots in Figure-7 are contour plots of the performance of lift (a), induced drag (b), and lift to\ninduced drag (c). The geometry is planar and represents the x-z location of the leading edge\nlocation of the flap. The upper left corner is cut out of this two-dimensional plot contour plot\nbecause this would represent interference between the wing and the flap. Interestingly, the\naerodynamic efficiency represented in Figure-7.1(c) is a maximum with the flap at the minimum\nseparation from the main wing. This is mainly due to the lower induced drag at these locations.\n\n25\n\nKeep in mind that this does not account for viscous affects. The lower flap deflection angles\ncorrespond to the higher efficiencies. Despite the obvious best values as represented in the contour\nplot, the variation in efficiency over a significant flap position range is not dramatic and it is\nentirely possible that the best design point will be driven by other factors in practice.\n\nFigure-5.7(a): Lift distribution in the normalized design space for different flap deflections\n\nFigure-5.7(b): Induced drag distribution in the normalized design space for different flap deflections\n\nFigure-5.7(c): Lift-to-induced drag distribution in the normalized design space for different flap deflections\n\n26\n\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nA fundamentally new solver, FlightStreamTM, based entirely on surface vorticity has been used to\ninvestigate the NASA D8.5 geometry in a high lift (flapped) configuration. This investigation\nincluded a solution for a baseline configuration with no flaps, a solution with a flapped\nconfiguration with the flaps stowed, a validation study to ensure that the flapped configuration\nsolutions would be reliable, and a series of solutions at flap angle settings of 15o, 25o, and 35o for\na range of flap positions and angles of attack. The validation cases included comparisons to a\nflapped general aviation configuration, the first high lift workshop configuration with flaps only\nand the second high lift workshop configuration with both slats and flaps. The fidelity of the\nFlightStreamTM solution with the available experimental data was quite striking for angles of attack\nup to a range at which flow separation is thought to be a likely component of the flow physics.\nFlightStreamTM is a potential flow solver based on the assumption that the flow is entirely attached\nand therefore is not expected to maintain high fidelity with wind tunnel or flight data in which\nseparated flow is present or anticipated.\nThe D8.5 flap study showed that a near doubling of lift coefficient is possible with the flaps that\nwere modeled. The trade study included a map of X-Z locations for the flap leading edge and this\nstudy showed that the best efficiency occurs for flaps that are in very close proximity to the wing.\nOn the other hand, this does not correspond to the highest lift configuration. The highest lift\nconfiguration corresponds to the most fully extended position for the flaps, which also corresponds\nto the highest induced drag position, as expected. Depending on the design goals for the entire\naircraft, different flaps, flap positions and possible flap settings might be of interest.\nThis study has been designed to create an aerodynamic map of the D8.5 geometry, specifically\nwith flapped wings for the purposes of both validating the method and generating an aerodynamic\nperformance map suitable for use by an aircraft design team. This analysis does not address the\nstructural requirements for the aerodynamic loading, flutter considerations, propulsion\nrequirements, or any of a number of other design constraints and focuses instead entirely on\nproviding a high fidelity characterization of the aerodynamic performance.\nIt is highly recommended that additional work on this and similar geometries include the\ndevelopment of methods suitable for accurately estimating the value of CLmax, which would\ninvolve the development of appropriate methods for analyzing separated flow over wings. The\nResearch in Flight Company is very interested in pursuing methodologies in this genre.\n\n27\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
