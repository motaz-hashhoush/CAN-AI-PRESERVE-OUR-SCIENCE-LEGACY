It is, however, inadequate from other\n\n)\nviewpoints: 1 The level of aggregation is quite high, making it impossible to\nobtain impacts on specific industries. 2) The use of annual data makes it\nimpossible to study intrayearly movements which may be of some interest.\n\n3)\n\nThe use of federal military purchases from private industry includes purchases\nof items which are not classified in the durable goods industry. Nevertheless,\nthe importance of this variable in the inventory equation is an indication of\n\n-9the gains t o be realized from an appropriate specification of the lead and l a g\ns t r u c t u r e of the process.\n\nB\n.\n\n-----\n\nDuesenberry-Eckstein-Fromm:Model of the United States Economy During\nRecession\n\nIn t h e i r very i n t e r e s t i n g paper,\n\nL21,Professors Duesenberry,\n\nEckstein,\n\nand F r o m recognize the importance of the order e f f e c t , p a r t i c u l a r l y i n t h e\nexplanation of inventory changes.\n\nIn constructing the order s e r i e s , however,\n\nthey assume t h a t the l a g between orders and purchases i n one-quarter.\nnevertheless a r e able t o s t a t e t h a t the "...stimulus\n\nThey\n\nof government actions\n\nworked through orders as much as through a c t u a l expenditures."\n\nIt would be\n\ni n t e r e s t i n g t o explore the consequences of a more r e a l i s t i c specification of\nthe l a g between obligations and purchases.\n\nC\n.\n\nFrom:\n\n-\n\n"Inventories, Business Cycles, and Stabilization"\n\nIn a paper preferred f o r the Joint Economic Committee, L - 6 7 , Gary F r o m\ns t a t e s , "...fluctuations\n\ni n government orders and expenditures coupled with\n\nt h e i r r e s u l t i n g impact on, and the independent variation of, private business\ninvestment appear t o bear the principal responsibility f o r recent s t a b i l i t y\nd i f f i c u l t i e s i n the U.

orders has discovered it\nt o be an important variable,\n\nI n t h i s section empirical work f o r two groups\n\nof budget categories w i l l be reported.\n\nSpecifically, expenditures and o b l i

and ordnance and accessories, respectively; and budget category\n"Ships" w i l l be associated with SIC 3731, shipbuilding and repairing.\n\nA more\n\nd e t a i l e d description of the data may be found i n the Appendix.\nTables 1, 2, and 3 contain the r e s u l t s f o r the aerospace industry of\nmultiple regression analyses f o r three dependent variables:\n\nt o t a l employment,\n\nproduction worker employment, and production workers times average weekly hours.\nEmployment figures are i n thousands of employees; man-hours are in thousands;\nand a l l d o l l a r numbers a r e i n millions.\n\nThe r e s u l t s are broadly s i m i l a r and\n\na r e discussed i n the following paragraphs.\n\n-\n\n-14\n1 Seasonal and time variables:\n.\n\nGenerally the seasonal variables a r e\n\nnot s i g n i f i c a n t individually, which lends support t o the hypothesis t h a t\nobserved seasonality i n the employnent s e r i e s i s b e t t e r explained by the\nseasonality i n the obligations s e r i e s than a constant seasonal pattern.\n\nAn\n\nF test performed on the group of seasonal dummy variables f o r the t o t a l worker\nregression proved t o be i n s i g n i f i c a n t a t the 576 level.\n\nBoth time and time\n\nsquared a r e highly s i g n i f i c a n t ; t h e coefficient of time i s negative and t h a t\nof time squared, positive.\n\nOver the range of i n t h i s study, however, the\n\nnegative e f f e c t predominates and t h e net e f f e c t of time i s negative, although\n\na t a decreasing rate.\n\nI n view of the e a r l i e r discussion of the l i k e l y e f f e c t s\n\nof price changes and subcontracting patterns, t h i s negative e f f e c t was ezrpected.\n2.\n\nExpenditures and Obligations:\n\nThe three s e t s of regression coefficients\n\nreveal t h a t current expenditures and obligations a r e not s i g n i f i c a n t explanatory\nvariables of employment, but that lagged obligations a r e a l l positive, a l l\ng r e a t e r than t h e i r standard e r r o r s , and 9 out of 12 coefficients i n each\nregression a r e s t a t i s t i c a l l y significant.\n\nThe f a c t t h a t expenditures were not\n\ns i g n i f i c a n t c a s t s some doubt on the hypothesis t h a t the industry i s dependent\nupon the governrent f o r i t s working c a p i t a l needs, but the importance of\nobligations i s strongly reinforced.\n\nContrary t o the findings of Ando and\n\nBrown, t h e e f f e c t s of obligations are f e l t almost immediately ( t h e f i r s t lagged\nvalue i s s i g n i f i c a n t ) and e f f e c t s are f a i r l y w e l l spread out over the year,\nwith a r a t h e r sharp drop between the eleventh and twelfth coefficient.\n\n3.\n\nAnnouncement effects:\n\nThe coefficients of the unobligated appropri-\n\na t i o n s and the budget variables a r e s t a n t i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t i n two of the\nthree regressions, and positive, though not s i g n i f i c a n t , i n t h e t h i r d .\n\nThese\n\nvariables appear t o exert more effect on t o t a l workers than on production\nworkers, both i n terms of the magnitude of regression coefficients and standardized regression coefficients ( 8 \' s )\n\n.\n\nSince t o t a l workers include\n\nmanagerial and research people whose employment may depend l e s s on\n\nTable

Further Research\n\nGiven the present data a v a i l a b i l i t y , I do not think t h a t the procedure\nfollowed i n t h i s paper can be applied t o other industries.\n\nIf appropriate\n\nd a t a should become available, such studies would be quite valuable.\n\nAnother\n\nd i r e c t i o n f o r research would be t o complete t h e description of the spending\nprocess by constructing models which r e l a t e expenditures and government purchases t o lagged obligations and other variables.\nAn important area f o r research, not touched upon i n t h i s paper, i s the\n\nquestion of economic impacts on p a r t i c u l a r regions.\n\nIt is hoped t h a t the\n\npresent study has contributed t o t h i s problem by pointing out the stage a t\nwhich impacts are l i k e l y t o occur.\n\nAgain i n the d i r e c t i o n of disaggregation,\n\nmore d e t a i l on the occupational mix of employment might be investigated.\n\nA6\n\nnoted above, there appears t o be differences i n the behavior of t o t a l employment and production worker employment.\n\nAs longer series on research and\n\ndevelopment obligations become available, these differences might be useful\nf o r studying the dynamics of the demand f o r engineers and s c i e n t i s t s .\n\n..\n\nREFERENCES\n\n-24.-\n\n-..\n\nAndo, Albert; Brown, E.
