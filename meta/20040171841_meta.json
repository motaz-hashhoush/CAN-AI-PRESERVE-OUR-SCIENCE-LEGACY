With these objectives establishing the major scientific capabilities of the observatory, the JWST Project has successfully completed major reviews of the telescope architecture and budget plan and has reached agreement on the contributions for all three international partners (NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency). Northrop Grumman Space Technologies (NGST) is the prime contractor responsible for the spacecraft, telescope, and integration. GSFC/NASA oversees the development and integration of the science instruments. The Space Telescope Science Institute is developing the JWST Science & Operations Center. The JWST will be launched to L2 2011 using an Ariane V. At this town hall, the mission's Project Scientists will present the technical and scientific status of the mission, concentrating on those areas that have changed over the last year. This will be an excellent opportunity to learn about JWST and catch up on the most recent developments. Questions from the audience will be welcomed. The town hall speakers will be John Mather, Peter Jakobsen, John Hutchings, and Peter Stockman.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040171841, "endDate": "2004-01-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "d5dc203ab790445899eb2a103de95170", "id": "87d52cb7b3e84384a6e3dd1a8f289b8a"}], "name": "American Astronomical Society Meeting", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "d5dc203ab790445899eb2a103de95170", "startDate": "2004-01-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040171841, "id": "ccad72befcec464eb02a9f8cdc503a76", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
