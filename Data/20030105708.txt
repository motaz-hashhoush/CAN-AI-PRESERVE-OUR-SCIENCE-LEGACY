Russell Carpenter\', Jesse A. Leitnert, David C. Folta\', Richard D. Burnst\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\nhave also sometimes had difficulties in making relevant comparisons between algorithms and technologies when they are applied in different circumstances.\nThis paper attempts to address these concerns by\nsuggesting some relevant benchmark problem descriptions that cover a range of the types of missions\nthat are of interest to NASA over the next couple of\ndecades. These problems are not specific to any current or proposed mission, but instead are intended to\ncapture high-level features that would be generic to\nmany similar missions. In particular, however, this\npaper focuses on the problem of formation flying\nspacecraft. This focus bounds into the fundamental\nfoundation for formation flying, which is the understanding, harnessing, and exploitation of the dynamics of relative motion.\n\nAbstract\nTo provide high-level focus to distributed space system flight dynamics and control research, several\nIjenchmark problems are suggested. These problems\nare not specific to any current or proposed mission,\nbut instead are intended to capture high-level features\nthat would be generic to many similar missions.\n\nIntroduction\nCollection of information through a cluster of individual sensors or through sensors distributed over\nmultiple formation flying vehicles can provide substantial benefits. Distributed space systems (DSS)\nenable higher resolution imagery and interferometry,\nrobust and redundant fault-tolerant spacecraft system\narchitectures, and complex networks dispersed over\nclusters of satellites in space\'. As DSS technologies\nhave matured in recent years, various groups and\nagencies are flying and proposing a large number of\nDSS missions\'. These missions and mission concepts cover a wide range of flight environments, from\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) to deep space, and requirements regimes from relative control precisions of\nnanometers to kilometers, over baselines of tens of\nmeters to millions of kilometers. The more challenging mission concepts envision launches in the\nmid- to late-20 1Os, but several ambitious missions\nare proposed and funded for launch in the 2007-20 15\ntimeframe, and are a primary focus of much of the\nrecent interest in spacecraft formation flying.\n\nBenchmark Problems\nThe subsections below present three benchmark\nproblems, which are labeled by their orbital flight\nregimes: low Earth orbit; highly elliptical Earth orbit;\nand libration point orbit. The problem descriptions\nintentionally avoid specifying design details such as\nmass and area, as well as specific capabilities such as\nthrust resolution, navigation accuracy, or control precision.\nIn addition to the requirements each problem contains, overall goals are the minimization of resource\nusage (e.g. fuel, power), launch mass, and control,\nguidance, or navigation e r o r depending on the type\nof investigation. Potential constraints on the system,\nwhich may govern the formation control design, include fuel budget, maneuver frequency, thrust magnitude, and navigation accuracy. We will focus on the\nformation problem, not on a cdllection of individual\n\nDue to the wide variety of ideas for DSS missions,\nresearchers working in this area have sometimes had\ndifficulty in identifying candidate problems to which\nthey should apply their innovations.

Where\nthe problems specify requirements of more than one\ntype, e.g. both relative position and pointing, or control and knowledge, researchers are encouraged to\nseek solutions that meet any or all of the problems\xe2\x80\x99\nspecifications. While system-level analysis is essential for looking at the broad problem of formation\nflying spacecraft, it is important that detailed research\nand development work on the component technology\nareas (relative navigation, formation control, formation design, etc.) does not become washed out in\nhigh-level architecture development. Thus we propose to form an integrated team across the community across all of the internal disciplines and integrated with the mission development teams and principle investigators.\n\nA nominal set of mean orbital elements are presented\nin Table 1, where a is the semi-major axis, e is the\neccentricity, i is the orbital inclination, SL is the right\nascension of the ascending node, w is the argument of\nperigee, and f is the true anomaly. The term mean\nelements indicates that short period effects have been\nremoved either analytically or through some numerical averaging process.\n\nTable 1: LEO reference traiectorv mean elements\nDescription\nValue\nUnits\nEpoch\n5 Oct 2001 O O Os\nh m\nUT0\na\n6778\nk m \xe2\x80\x98\ne\n1.

Other than\nthe constraints listed here, one may assume any kind\nof sensor, actuator, and plant properties and capabilities that should be available in the 2005-2015\ntimeframe.\n\nLow Earth Orbit\nFigure 1 illustrates a proposed NASA mission concept that shares some characteristics with the low\nEarth orbit (LEO) benchmark problem. The benchmark formation is defined with respect to a reference\ntrajectory, which follows a near-circular, sunsynchronous orbit with a nominal altitude of 400 km.\n\nNo spacecraft exists at the reference point. There are\nsix, 3-axis stabilized spacecraft. Three are equally\nspaced in each of two oppositely inclined \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\ncircular\xe2\x80\x9d formations 500 m in diameter. That is,\nwhen projected into the along-tracldcross-track plane\nof the reference orbit, the paths of relative motion\nabout the reference are circles in the linearized relative motion approximation (Hill\xe2\x80\x99s Equations). This\nrelative motion can be achieved through a combination of differences in the orbital elements from the\nreference trajectory. These orbital element differences are dependent on the diameter of the formation\nand the phase of the spacecraft within the formation.\nSabol et ai4 have provided relationships for initializing projected circular formations and notdd that the\nsemi-major axes should be matched exactly in order\nfor the formation to be stable under Keplenan motion.\nThe phase within the formation will determine the\nrequired inclination and ascending node offsets from\nthe reference. The inclusion of three satellites in\neach formation necessarily implies that at least one\nformation member will have an inclination offset\nfrom the other members, which establishes differential nodal and in-plane drifts caused by the 52 geopotential term. Schaub and Alfriend5 have provided\nrelationships to manipulate semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination offsets in order to null the differential nodal and in-plane drift, but this method\nencounters singularities at polar inclinations and circular orbits. Alfriend6 has proposed a relaxation of\nthese constraints near circular and polar orbits along\nwith a novel method for balancing fuel expenditure\n\norientation. A tetrahedral configuration need not be\nmaintained at any other point in the orbit. The desired relative motion can be achieved through a combination of differences in a subset of the orbital elements from the reference trajectory, excluding semimajor axis, which as in the LEO case, must be\nmatched exactly. These orbital element differences\ndetermine the phasing of the individual spacecraft in\nthe formation, which determines the orientation of\nthe tetrahedron, as well as the formation\xe2\x80\x99s relative\nmotion throughout the remainder of the orbit. With\nrespect to relative motion throughout the remainder\nof the orbit, it is desirable that variations in the volume of the tetrahedron, and in the ratio of the maximum to minimum interspacecraft ranges, be minimized while within 30 degrees of apogee, Also,\nclose approaches of 1 km or less should be strictly\navoided throughout the orbit. Mailhe, et a1.*, compare several approaches that address some of these\nrequirements.\n\nwithin a similar formation. The relative positions of\nthe spacecraft must be controlled with respect to their\ndesired relative trajectories to within 5 m or better.\nThe spacecraft should be capable of pointing to a\ncommon target on the surface of the earth to within\n0.1 degrees. The nominal mission duration is two\nyears.\n\nHiuhlv Elliptic Orbit\nFigure 2 depicts a proposed NASA mission\xe2\x80\x99 that\nshares come characteristics with the highly elliptical\norbit (HEO) benchmark problem. The average position of the HE0 benchmark fomation follows a 1.2\nby 18 Earth radii (ER) orbit, lying approximately\n5 degrees above the ecliptic plane, where the initial\nline of apsides is parallel to the direction to the sun,\nand apogee is opposite the sun. Table 2 lists a nominal set of mean elements, following the convention\ndescribed above.\n\nFigure 3: Concept for NASA libration point\nmission.\n\nFigure 2: Proposed NASA H E 0 mission.\nThis mission has four phases: an initial HE0\nof 1.2~12 approximately in the ecliptic\nER,\nplane; a 1 . 2 ~ 3 0 phasing orbit; a double\nER\nlunar swingby; and a final H E 0 of\n10x40 ER in a near polar orbit.\n\nEach spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s spin rate is 2W2 RPM, and the spin\naxis is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, to within 1\ndegree. The spacecrafts\xe2\x80\x99 relative positions should be\ncontrolled at apogee to within 10% of the separation,\nbut are not constrained throughout the remainder of\nthe orbit, except that they must maintain 1 km minimum separation constraint. The nominal mission\nduration is two years.\n\nTable 2: HE0 reference trajectory mean elements\nDescription\nValue\nUnits\nEpoch\n21 Jun 2009 O O O\nh m s\nUT0\nRef.

A single spacecraft is located 100 km away\nat the focus, along the line of sight to the science target, such that the whole configuration forms a distributed Fizeau interferometer. Figure 3 illustrates\nthe concept for a proposed NASA mission that share\nsome similarities with this problem\xe2\x80\x99.\nThere are two modes of operation:\nA science mode, in which the aperture must\n\xe2\x80\x9cstare\xe2\x80\x9d in an inertially fixed direction for up\nto a month, with relative positions controlled\nto within 1 cm. While staring, the formation\nmust rotate about the line of sight i o the target at least once per week, and the internal\nbaselines of the aperture must vary somewhat arbitrarily during the rotation. Pointing requirements, absolute and relative, in\nthis mode are 1 arcsec.\nA maneuver mode, in which the line of sight\nof the aperture must slew on the order of 20\ndegrees per day to acquire a new science\ntarget. In this mode, the only attitude determination requirement is the need to point\nsensors and actuators with enough accuracy\nto efficiently perform the maneuver.\nThe line-of-sight of the formation (the line\nalong the focal length) must be maintain\nrelative to an inertial source on the order of\nthe imaging resolution which is approximately 10 micro-arcseconds.\nThe nominal mission duration is 12 years.\n\nSummary\nThis paper has described, at a high level, three\nbenchmark problems covering a range of the types of\ndistributed spacecraft missions that NASA and other\nagencies hope to accomplish over the next couple of\ndecades. The requirements herein are characteristic\nof similar missions but in many cases are more or\nless stringent than those in the actual mission concepts that they represent. The purpose of these\nproblems is to foster better collaboration and comparison of results among the many researchers engaged in the study of guidance, navigation, and control issues for spacecraft formation flying.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThis paper benefited from conversations with Steven\nHughes.\n\nReferences\n1.
