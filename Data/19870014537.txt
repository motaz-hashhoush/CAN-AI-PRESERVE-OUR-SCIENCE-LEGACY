An\nactuator formed of a memory metal is used to pull the\nspring clutch to tighten it and rotate the shaft. The\nactuator is activated by heating it above its critical temperature and is returned to an elongated configuration\nby means of the force of the spring clutch.\n11 Claims, 5 Drawing Figures\n\nc\nm\n\n////I// L\n\nU.
