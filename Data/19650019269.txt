differences are found i n t h e i r basic c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s .\n\nSome of these\n\ndifferences are not merely ones of degree but a r e fundamental and pervasive.\nThey range from the nature of product development decisions t o price determination, p r o f i t r a t e s , provision of working c a p i t a l and research and development funds, source of plant and equipmnt, nature of t h e work force, and\nremuneration of top management.\nFinancial Characteristics\nThe defense/space contractors tend t o operate on f a r smaller p r o f i t\n\nmargins than the commercially-oriented companies.\n\nThese respective net pro-\n\nf i t s expressed as a percent of sales were 2.2 percent and 5.2 percent.\n\nNatu-\n\not\nr a l l y , this is the comparison m s frequently used by defense industry spokesmen i n their public statements.\n\nHowever, other aspects of the comparative\n\nf i n a n c i a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s a r e a l s o of i n t e r e s t .\n\nFor example, because of t h e\n\nlarge amounts of manufacturing and research plant and equipment which i s made\navailable t o them by the defense establishment, defense/space contractors\nreport a f a r higher rate of c a p i t a l turnover (i.e.,\nd o l l a r of company-owned a s s e t s ) :\n\nd o l l a r s of s a l e s per\n\n2.5 versus 1.2 f o r t h e two samples.\n\nTo\n\nsome extent, the lower p r o f i t margins and higher turnover r a t e s f o r defense\ncompanies tend t o o f f s e t each other.\n\nHowever, the return on net worth ( a f t e r -\n\nt a x net p r o f i t s a s percent of stockholders investment) i s higher on balance\nf o r the sample of government contractors (13.8 percent versus 9.2 percent i n\n\n1962)\n\nTbis l a t t e r comparison may be the most germane f i n a n c i a l one.\n\nL\n2\n\n-6Investor Evaluation\nThe stock market\'s evaluation of the defense companies appears t o be\nl e s s favorable than t h a t of the general i n d u s t r i a l corporations.\n\nThe inherent\n\ni n s t a b i l i t y of the governmental market and the h i s t o r i c a l v o l a t i l i t y of the\nfortunes of individual defense contractors a r e undoubtedly important influences.\nAlso, the lower payout r a t i o ( t h e proportion of net income which i s a c t u a l l y\ndisbursed t o stockholders i n the form of cash dividends) i s a related influence.\n\nI n 1962, t h i s r a t i o was only 38 percent f o r the aerospace companies and 66\npercent f o r the general i n d u s t r i a l firms.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the\n\nearnings of the m i l i t a r y firms tend t o be discounted as shown by the lower\nprice/earnings multiple (13 versus 16 1/4).\nBondholders a l s o tend t o t r e a t the s e c u r i t i e s of defense-oriented f i r m s\nd i f f e r e n t l y then those of the firms i n the non-defense sample.\n\nWhere bonds\n\na r e outstanding, Moody\'s, the standard f i n a n c i a l r a t i n g service, has categorized\na\nthose of the defense companies as B a (lower medium grade) or Ba (epeculative)\n\nand those of the other companies as A (higher medium grade) o r A a (higher\n\nCapital Structure\n\nThe r e l a t i v e l y small degree t o which aerospace companies r e l y on t h e i r\nown physical a s s e t s can be seen by t h e i r f a r lower r a t i o of company-owned\np l a n t and equipment t o s a l e s (7 percent vs 26 percent) ; i n d i r e c t l y , of course,\nt h i s indicates the importance of government-supplied c a p i t a l .\n\n-7\n\n-\n\nA somewhat similar relationship prevails when crude r a t i o s a r e prepared of\n\nc a p i t a l t o output (taken a s the ratio of depreciated plant and equipment as\ncarried on t h e company books t o "value added" o r in-house effort).\n\nFor the\n\ngeneral industry sample, the capital/output r a t i o was 1.4, indicating t h a t\n\n$1.40 of c a p i t a l was required, on the average, f o r each $1.00 of output.\n\nFor\n\nthe aerospace companies, the c a p i t a l output r a t i o was only 0.2.\n\nIn contrast t o recent discussions of the tendency f o r m i l i t a r y contractors\nt o make a p r o f i t "on a profit"--on work prlmarily performed by 6ubcontracLo~n\n\nwho themselves earn profits-their\n\nr a t i o of in-house effort\n\n( v a l w added\n\nto\n\ns a l e s ) i s s l i g h t l y higher than f o r the other companies (33 percent compared\nt o 28 percent).\n\nThat is, defense contractors tend t o subcontract less and\n\ndo more of the t o t a l work themselves than i s t h e case f o r the sample of\ngeneral i n d u s t r i a l corporations.\n\nThis may be another example of the value of\n\nobtaining some data i n order t o verify, o r contradict, previously untested\nassumptions concerning government-industry relationships.\n\n-\n\nResearch and Development\nScience and engineering perform a much l a r g e r role f o r defense/space\ncontractors than i n other branches of business a c t i v i t y .\n\nBased on data of\n\nthe National Science Foundation f o r the industries i n which the\n\n16 sampled\n\nfirms are located, it i s estimated that expenditures f o r research and development account f o r 22.5 percent of the s a l e s of the defense group and 4.3\npercent f o r the other.\n\nIn good measure, t h i s s i t u a t i o n r e s u l t s from the tremendous amount of\ngovernment research and development contracts which companies serving defense\n\n-8\nand space markets receive.\n\n-\n\nAbout 90 percent of t h e i r R&D i s so financed, and\n\nonly 40 percent f o r a l l other companies.\n\nHowever, the defense firms a l s o\n\ndevote a somewhat higher proportion of t h e i r own resources t o R&D than does\nprivate industry a s a whole (R&D was 2.6 percent of eales compared t o 1.8\npercent f o r other companies).\n\nA s a r e s u l t i n good measure of the heavy R&D\n\noutlays, a far g r e a t e r portion of the t y p i c a l defense/space company work\nforce consists of s c i e n t i s t s and engineers doing research and development work\nthan i s the case f o r the average company serving private markets.\nManpower\nThe high proportion of engineers and other professional employees which\ni s c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of defense and space work i s r e f l e c t e d i n the g r e a t e r\n\naverage payroll cost per employee ($7,457 versus $5,770).\n\nHowever, t h i s\n\nf a c t o r is a l s o seen i n t h e higher d o l l a r volume of eales per employee\n\n($18,040 t o $13,865).\n\nOf course, the l a t t e r s t i u a t i o n may r e f l e c t the "cost\n\nplus" nature of much of government procurement.\n\nI n s t r i k i n g contrast, the average chief executive of an aerospace company receives a s i g n i f i c e n t l y lower s a l a r y ($148,600) than h i s counterpart\ni n other industries ($222,600).\n\nThis too, may be a consequence of the close\n\nrelationships between t h e defense/space industry and governmental customer;\nhence, the tendency f o r the r e l a t i v e l y low pay structure of the Federal\nGovernment t o exert a dampening influence on the s a l a r i e s of the managements\ndoing buelmss primarily with governmental procurement agencies\n\n-9Stage i n the Growth Cycle\nCharacteristically, the defense-space market has been a major growth area\nof the American economy; the dominant firms i n the f i e l d have experienced\nf a r more rapid increases i n s a l e s , employment, p r o f i t s , and net worth than\nhas been the case f o r t h e other large i n d u s t r i a l corporations generally.\nFor example, t o t a l employment In the sample of aerospace companies\n1\nincreased 52 percent over the past decade and only 1 percent f o r the general\n\ni n d u s t r i a l firms.\n\nFor s a l e s , t h e respective growth was 170 percent and 61\n\npercent.\nPrimarily, t h e r e l a t i v e l y more rapid growth p a t t e r n of the large defensespace contractors may result from the equally rapid expansions i n the requirements of the governmental customers.\n\nIn pert, it may a l s o r e f l e c t the r e l a t i v e\n\nyouth of t h e firms i n the industry (39 years versus 62 years f o r the two\nsamples).\nThe tendency f o r the firms i n t h e defense industry t o c l u s t e r i n several\n\nareas i n the western p a r t of the United States has had an important e f f e c t\n\non the p a t t e r n of regional development i n t h e nation during the postwar period;\nmost studies of the subject tend t o conclude t h a t defense production work was\n\na major f a c t o r i n the r e l a t i v e growth r a t e s of various s t a t e s and metropolitan\nareas i n the postwar period.\n\nNot coincidently, the headquarters and major\n\nproduction and research f a c i l i t i e s of f i v e of the s i x companies i n the defense\nsample a r e located west of the Mississippi River.\n\nThe headquarter o f f i c e s ,\n\na t least, of all s i x nondefense companies are e a s t of the Mississippi.\n\n-10-\n\nThe Role of\n---- the Customer\nThe government represents, for the specialized defense/space suppliers,\n\ne s s e n t i a l l y a monopsonistic o r one-customer market.\n\nDifferent agencies of the\n\nDepartment of Defense procure varying items, but s a l e s are a l l made fundamentally t o t h e m i l i t a r y establishment under the Armed Services Procurement\nRegulation and similar establishment-wide l e g i s l a t i o n and regulations.\n\nThe\n\nA r m e d Services Procurement Regulation, u n i l a t e r a l l y , establishes numerous\n\naspects of the relationship.\nThe distinguishing role of the governmental customer a l s o extends t o the\ni n t e r n a l operations of defense/space companies.\n\nIt convers such aspects a s\n\nf i n a n c i a l reporting systems, i n d u s t r i a l engineering and planning (the com-\n\npulsory use of PERT/COST systems f o r example), l i m i t a t i o n s on the use of over-\n\nt i m e , purchases from abroad, r e s t r i c t i o n s on charitable contributions, patents,\nand pay rates.\n\nMost of these requirements on the companies supplying the\n\nDepartment of Defense and NASA result Prom entering i n t o contractual relationships with the government.\n\nThe bulk of these requirements a r i s e e i t h e r from\n\ncongressional l e g i s l a t i o n o r standard m i l i t a r y procurement regulations.\n\nIk\n\nA recent example of t h e close governmental relationship is afforded by\n\na report of the U.S. General Accounting Office, contending t h a t the leasing\nof computer systems by a defense contractor i s costing the Federal Government\n\nmore than i f the Government purchased the equipment and furnished it t o the\ncontractor.\n\nThe company, i n turn, contended t h a t the high r a t e of obsolescence\n\nof computer equipment made r e n t a l the more economical choice.\n\nAlthough neither\n\nargument is i n terms of management prerogative, the GAO r e b u t t a l , i s significant.\n\n-11-\n\nIt countered by saying t h a t because the Government, In effect, i s bearing most\n\nof the cost of r e n t a l s of computer systems used by defense contractors, it\n"should have the r i g h t t o manage. the equipment i n such a manner a s t o f u l f i l l\nthe Government\'s needs a t l e a s t cost.\n\n15\n\nQuite naturally, the relationship between t h e defense/space companies\nand the Federal Government has been the cause f o r considerable and extended\npublic concern and questioning.\n\nSome observers have even referred t o t h i s\n\nas "symbiotic" relationship, a s t a t u s described by Webster \'s as "living\ntogether.\n\n. . where the association i s advantageous,\n\no r often necessary,\n\nt o one o r both, and not harmful t o either."\nTo be sure, both the industry and the government each bring c e r t a i n\n\nstrengths t o the bargaining relationship, and each has some weaknesses.\n\nFor\n\nexample, the Federal Government, p a r t i c u l a r l y acting through the m i l i t a r y\nestablishment, i s responsible f o r national survival.\n\nThis awesome responsibility\n\ngives it a high degree of ultimate authority over the e n t i r e relationship.\nThe m i l i t a r y establishment i t s e l f possesses the inherent power of the\ns i n g l e buyer over the competititve seller.\na l t e r n a t i v e sellers.\ncompany\n\nThe buyer can choose amone\n\nIn practice, the s e l l e r\n\n-- has l i t t l e alternative,\n\n-- i.e.\n\nthe specialized defense\n\nas witnessed by the singular lack of success\n\nexperienced by defense companies i n attempting t o d i v e r s i f y i n t o nongovernmental\nmarkets.\n\nAs a r e s u l t of the locked-in o r captive nature of many of these\n\nsuppliers, government procurement l e g i s l a t i o n and regulations u n i l a t e r a l l y\ndetermine c r u c i a l aspects of governmental-indu\xe2\x82\xactry relationships.\n\n-12-\n\nAlso, the power t o u n i l a t e r a l l y mcdify a portion of the relationship,\nthrough contract cancellations o r other change, is one of the government\'s\nmajor inherent strengths and industry\'s inherent weaknesses.\n\nThe government\'s\n\nparer, through renegotiation, t o determine, a f t e r the f a c t , the amount of\np r o f i t t h a t the individual contractor may r e t a i n i s a very basic piece of\nauthority i n a private enterprise econoqy based on the p r o f i t motive.\nDefense/space contractors a r e not without strengths o r t h e i r own.\n\nIn the\n\nabsence of a well-developed arsenal system, they represent a t the present time\n\na t l e a s t the backbone of the nation\'s s c i e n t i f i c and engineering capability\nand especially the capability from which the government can draw f o r the\ndevelopment and production of weapon and space systems.\nAlso, the defense/space industry has considerable d i s c r e t i o n and a b i l i t y\n\nt o marshal1 r e l a t i v e l y large amounts and high quality of the resources devoted\nt o contracting and other matters c r i t i c a l t o i t s business objectives-scientists,\nengineers, accountants, attorneys, and contract negotiators and administrators.\nMoreover, the company which has performed a large portion of the work on\n\na given weapon or space system up t o a c e r t a i n point generally has more\nbargaining parer because the customer knows t h a t it is l i k e l y t o do a more\np r o f i c i e n t and economical job on the remainder of the work than a second\ncompany s t a r t i n g afresh.\n\nIn addition, the f a c t that a given company has devoted a considerable\namount of e f f o r t and hence gained some expertise on a given defense o r space\n\nproduct provides i t s representatives with a goodly amount of technical\n\n-13-\n\nauthoritativeness in negotiating contractual changes and in other contract\nadministration matters. On balance, of course, public and legislative\nattentAon is focused on those examples where the company representatives\nhave pushed (or inadvertently received) too good a bargain. The reverse\nsituation is hardly newsworthy.\n\n--\n\nOverall Impact of the Customer Relationshie\nViewed in a broad and relatively long-term perspective, the defense/space\nindustry is becoming a regulated industry and in such a unique fashion as\npossibly to Justify at times the term "semi-nationalized." The regulation\nis not accomplished through an independent commission before which the public\nand the industry can present their cases, as with utilities and other "public\nservice" industries. It is performed, rather, unilaterally through procure\n\n-\n\nment regulations and other provisions included in government contracts. These\nprovisions, which are not customarily found in private business arrangements,\nrange from those designed to protect the government as a customer to those\nattempting to encourage a large and growing variety of social and economic\nobjectives.\n\nThe ultimate impact of this form of regulation is yet to be determined.\n\nThe measurable differences in the characteristics of large, specialized\ndefense/space companies described above may be indicative of the subtle but\nfundamental changes which can take place within these companies. Moreover,\nthe essentially passive reaction of the major defense contractors to the\ncutbacks and other adverse developments in the military market during the\n\npast year a l s o may be indicative of t h e q u a l i t a t i v e changes which accompany\nthe close continuing relationship between a private e n t e r p r i s e and of govern-\n\nmental organization.\n\nThe defense/space companies attend numerous meetings and\n\nconferences on defense industry "conversion" and r e l a t e d topics and subscribe t o\nbackground staff studies.\n\nHowever, in general, they s t i l l await the govern-\n\nment\'s request f o r proposals before c o m i t t i n g any s i g n i f i c a n t amount of funds\nt o developing new, c i v i l i a n applications of t h e i r much-vaunted defense/space\ntechnology and systems management capability.\n\nThe maJor nonaerospace d i v e r s i -\n\nf i c a t i o n e f f o r t s a t the present time have centered on the government market,\nsuch a s coat-plus-fixed-fee contracts with the Office of Economic Opportunity\nt o operate Job Corps i n s t a l l a t i o n s or small exploratory research contracts\nwith t h e state of California.\n\n\'Phese have not been the results of company\n\nentrepreneurial e f f o r t s but of governmental requests for proposals.\n\nTo some degree, the i n i t i a t i v e , risk-bearing and similar manifestations\nof e n t e r p r i s e appear t o have become c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the buyer rather than\nthe seller i n the large and rather unique sector of the American economy\n\ndominated by m i l i t a r y and space requirements.\n\nThis r e l a t i v e l y unnoticed\n\ndevelopment may be reason f o r further study by those concerned with the prospects f o r future economic growth and technical innovation i n the United States.\n\nFoot notes\n\nIrAn e a r l i e r version\n\nof t h i s paper appeared i n the April 1965 issue of\n\n-\n\nChallengeA, The Magazine of Economic Affairs, published by\n\nplew\n\nYork Uni-\n\nv e r s i ty.\n\nkGeorge\n\nJ S t i g l e r i n h i s presidential address t o the American Economic\n.\n\nAssociation, Chicago, I l l i n o i s , December 29, 1964.\n\ni3\nFor\n\nadditional f i n a n c i a l comparisons, such a s return on t o t a l c a p i t a l , see\n\n-\n\nStanford Research I n s t i t u t e , The Industry-Government Aerospace Relationshie,\n\nMenlo Park, California, 1963.\n\n14 f u r t h e r d e t a i l ,\nFor\nUnited States\n\n, Chicago,\n\n15\nReported in the\n\n-\n\n--\n\nsee M L.
