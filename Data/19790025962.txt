The events were examined on many different\ntime scales ranging from days on either side of the boundary to high\nresolution measurements of 12.5 vectors per second. Two categories of\nm\nbounda\t ries were found, one group being relatively thin (averaging m 10 4 km) ,\nand the other being thick (averaging s 10 6 kn). In many cases the field\nvector rotated in a plane from one polarity to the other. Only two of the\ntransitions were null sheets. Using the minimum variance analysis to\ndetermine the normals to the plane of rotation, and assuming that this is\nthe same as the normal to the sector boundary surface, it was found that\nthe normals were close to (< 45\xc2\xb0) the ecliptic plane. The high inclination\nof the sector boundary surfaces during 1971-1973 may be related to the\npresence of large equatorial coronal holes at this time. An analysis of\ntangential discontinuities contained in 4-day periods about our events\nshowed that their orientations were generally not related to the orientations of the sector boundary surface, but rather their characteristics were\nabout the same as those for discontinuities outside the sector boundaries.\nMagnetic holes were found in thick sector boundaries, at a rate about three\ntimes that elsewhere. The holes were especially prevalent near stream\ninterfaces, suggesting that they might be related to the convergence and/or\nslip of adjacent solar wind streams.\n\n1. ,jntUAUPJion\nInterplanetary sectors are extended regions in which the interplanetary\nmagnetic field is directed primarily away from (or toward) the sun.\nSectors havd been studied extensively since their discovery by Wilcox and\nNess (1965). The boundaries between sectors are often relatively distinct\ns\nin plots of the magnetic field direction for intervals of s 27 days, and\nperhaps for this reason sector boundaries have been correlated with many\nsolar-terrestrial phenomena. For example, they have been correlated with\nsolar features and interplanetary streams (Ness and Wilcox, 1964; and see\nHundhausen, 1972, 1977), with geomagnetic activity (Wilcox, 1968), and even\nwith weather systems (Wilcox et al., 1974, Svalgaard, 1976). These studies\nhave shown that the sector toundaries and sector structure often provide a\nmeans of organizing solar-terrestrial data, even though the reason for this\nis not always clear. In order to understand the origin of sector\nboundaries and the relations between sector boundaries and other phenomena,\nit is important to learn more about the nature, morphology and internal\nstructure of sector boundaries. That is the aim of this work.\nThe morphology, especially the latitudinal extent, of sector boundaries\nhas been discussed in several papers, with a variety of results. Wilcox\nand Svalgaard (1974) suggested that the surfaces of sector boundaries might\nbe oriented perpendicular to the solar equatorial plane; Rosenberg and\nColeman (1969), Rosenberg (1970, 1975), Fairfield and Ness (1974), Behannon\nand Neubauer (1979), and Behannon L Al. (1979) presented evidence that\nsector boundary surfaces might lie close to the ecliptic plane; Svalgaard\n,get _4 .0 974) showed how intermediate inclinations might be obtained; and\nSchulz (1973), Levy (1976), and Alfven (1977) argued theoretically that the\nsector boundary surface might lie near the solar equatorial plane on\naverage. Recent indirect evidence for the shape of sector boundaries,\nbased on measurements of the sector structure and on coronal holes and open\nmagnetic field lines at the sun (Hundhausen, 1977; Burlaga _qt _g1., 1978),\ntends to support the Schulz-Levy-Alfven picture. Burlaga et Al. (1978)\npointed out that a variety of shapes and orientations is possible,\n\ndepending on the relative positions of coronal holes which produce the\nstreams that contain sectors. (Stationary interplanetary streams are\ngenerally unipolar, and sector boundaries always occur between streams.)\n\n1\n\n^.IM .,,^\\. .. i,r^I.Y\'jl.F^\xe2\x80\xa2i^ ^\t\n\nibY1..,.r Y^.+\xe2\x80\x94^ 3..^^^TI^:^y\t\n\n^: 1\' \\\t\n\n\'IY\t\n\n^\t\n\n\' ._\n\n\t\n\nit\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\t\n\n4\nThus, the morphology of the sector boundary surface might change with solar\nactivity. Measurements have recently been made of the latitudinal\nvariations of the sector boundary surface in 1976. Pioneer 11 observations\nobtained at 3.7-5 AU, showed that the sector structure disappeared at 160\nabove the ecliptic and positive sectors became increasingly dominant as the\nspacecraft moved to higher latitudes (Smith jej\t\n\n1978). Helios 1 and 2\n\nobservations obtained between 1 AU and 0.3 AU, determined the latitudes of\nrecurrent sector boundary crossings as a function of longitude for four\nsolar rotations, giving a direct measurement of the shape of a sector\nboundary surface (Villante eta ., 1979). Both the Pioneer 11 and Helios\nresults are consistent with a warped current sheet inclined s 100 to 150\nwith respect to the solar equator. In this paper (section 3) we\ninvestigate the orientation of sector boundaries in the period 1971-1973,\nusing data on the internal structure of sector boundaries obtained at 1 AU.\nWe find higher inclinations than observed in 1976, suggesting a possible\nsolar cycle variation.\nThe internal structure of sector boundaries has been found to be very\ncomplex (Behannon and Neubauer, 1979)\xe2\x80\xa2 We observed similar complexity and\nfound no uniform way to describe it. We consider only two of the phenomena\nwhich are found inside of sector boundaries directional discontinuities\nand magnetic holes. We investigated directional discontinuities (section\n4) in the hope that they might provide information on the orientation of\nsector boundary surfaces, but the results were negative for the set of\ndiscontinuities that we considered. Magnetic holes were considered\n(section 5) because they are a prominent feature in sector boundaries; the\nresults do not, however, support the widely-held view that sector\nboundaries are null sheets.\n\n2. Selection and Classification of Seetpr boundaries\n\nFor this study, we define a sector boundary (hereafter designated SB)\nas a transition between two sectors, each sector being a nearly unipolar\n{\n\n\t\n\nregion in which the magnetic field is close to the spiral direction and\nwhich passes the earth in 2 days or more. Sector boundaries were\nidentified in 27-day plots of hour averages of N, compiled by King (1977).\nThe only restriction on the thickness was that the transition should occur\n\n". .\t\n\n, : ice I.Ju\'.\'a.u",rduf5v\'Y4\n\n..." r r. aww^ r7i"-\t\n\n^. \xe2\x99\xa6 a\t\n\nAl\n\n5\nin significantly less than 2 days. We excluded intervals containing shock\nwaves, to avoid flare-associated flow configurations and any other such\ntransients. We also required that the data coverage in the 4-day interval\ncontaining the SB should be nearly complete.\nEighteen sector boundaries were selected in the 3-year interval that\nwas examined (January, 1971 to January, 1974). This is only a fraction\n(approximately 1/4 to 1/8) of all the SBs that were present but it is\nprobably a representative sample. The size of our sample is limited,\nprimarily because 1) we considered only periods for which we have IMP-6\nobservations (IMP-6 is in the solar wind only N 6 months/yr), 2) we\nrequired fairly continuous magnetic field coverage in the 4-day interval\ncontaining each sector boundary, and 3) we required that plasma data should\nbe available for the intervals selected.\nThroughout this paper,\n\n3 is measured in solar ecliptic coordinates.\n\nThe azimuthal direction (0) is measured in the ecliptic plane, increasing\ncounter-clockwise as seen by an observer north of the ecliptic; it is zero\nwhen\n\n9\n\npoints toward the sun. The inclination of p with respect to the\n\necliptic plane (9) is positive when\n\n9\n\npoints above the plane.\n\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of t angles before and after the SBs\nthat were selected for this study. This and Figure 7 (to be discussed\nlater) confirm that the magnetic field was predominantly along the spiral\ndirection and that the polarity of\n\n9 reversed across the chosen boundaries.\n\nAlso shown in Figure 1 are the distributions of the magnetic field\nintensity and the variance ( a ) in the Cartesian components of ^ over 1-hr\nintervals. The distributions of B and a are significantly broader after\n\nr\n\nthe SB than before. This is because SBs are usually followed by\ninteraction regions, where the intensity and fluctuations in p are\ngenerally higher than average.\nThe high resolution magnetic field data (up to 12.5 vectors/s) that\nwere used in our study of the structure of SBs were obtained by the\nNASA/GSFC magnetometer on IMP- 6. The principal investigator of that\nexperiment is N. F. Ness. A description of the instrument was presented by\ni\ni\n\n.\t\n\nFairfield (1974). The high sampling rates of the IMP-6 magnetometer\nresolved structures withscales smaller than the thermal ion gyroradius;\n\nr\n\nthus, all of the important magnetic field characteristics of SBs were\n\nA\n\n6\n\nLet us now consider specific examples of sector boundaries and show how\nthey can be classified. Figure 2 shows a SB on January 6,1973; the data\nare 12.5 averages of B. There are 4 significant characteristics of this\nSB. First, the transition occurs in less than 10 min. This is an example\nof one class of sector boundaries which we refer to as "thin" boundaries.\nSecond, the magnetic field intensity does not go to zero while the magnetic\nfield changes direction, i.e., the SB is not a null sheet. The magnetic\nfield direction changes by means of a Notation of\n\nB rather than by\n\nV\n\nshrinking to zero along a fixed direction. Third, the field moves out of\nthe ecliptic (high values of IDI) during the sector transition. Fourth,\nthe reversal of B occurs by means of a rotation in a plane, i.e., the\nstructure of the SB resembled that of a tangential discontinuity. The\nlarge values of 161 in the transition imply that the rotation plane was\nhighly inclined with respect to the ecliptic.\nWe used the standard minimum variance technique (Sonnerup and Cahill,\n1967) to analyze the change in\n\nB across a SB (see Lepping and Behannon,\n\n(1979), Burlaga a-t al., 1977, and the references therein for a discussion\nof this method). Basically, the technique determines a plane which best\nfits the vectors\n\nBi - < B >, where < B > is the average field in the ^\n\ntransition, and B\n\nare the measured values. The normal to this plane (z)\n\nis called the minimum variance direction, because the vectors vary the\nleast along z. (If B rotated exactly in a plane, the variance of\n\nBi - <\n\nB\n\n> along z would be zero.) The extent to which the vectors lie in\n\na plane is measured by the ratio of intermediate to minimum eigenvalues,\n21 2 A .,; values s 2 are usually taken to indicate rotation in a plane. The\nnormal to this plane (6 N , ^ N ) is determined by the minimum variance\nanalysis.\nApplying the minimum variance analysis to the high-resolution data for\nV"\n\nr\n\nthe event in Figure 2, and plotting the magnetic field in the minimum\nvariance coordinate system, we obtained the results shown on the right of\nFigure 2. There is little scatter in the z direction, consistent with the\ncomputed eigenvalue ratio A 2 1A 3 = 30. The magnetic field changes mainly by\nrotating in the x-y plane. The normal to the x--y plane is\n\n0\n\n-7\n\n^N = 239 0 in solar ecliptic coordinates.\nThe "thin" sector boundaries are not always isolated transitions, i.e.,\na SB may consist of several rapid reversals in the direction of B.\n\n_L^\n\n7\nFigure 3 shows a plot of 5 min averages of q , ^, and 6 for a 6-hr interval\non January\n\n18\n\nand\n\n19,\n\n1973. A SB can be seen in the \xc2\xa2-direction at\n\napproximately hour 4 on January 19. The abrupt rise in field magnitude at\nm hour 15 is at an interface "o a high speed stream. The transition\nappears to be an isolated thin SB at this resolution, but higher resolution\ndata (Figure 4) show that the transition actually consists of at least\nthree abrupt reversals in p--one at s 0418:40 UT, a second at \'P O422:15 UT\nand a third at 1P 0428:40 UT. In two of the crossings (0422 and 0428 UT)\nthe magnetic field intensity drops to near zero; i.e., these transitions\nare easentia7ly null-sheets, in which the field reverses direction by\nshrinking to zero along a line and then increasing in the opposite\ndirection on that line. This behavior is not discernible in the 5 min\naverages shown in Figure 4. This example illustrates the importance of\nusing high resolution measurements to study the structure of SBs; it shows\nthat even seemingly simple SBs can be relatively complex; it points out a\nlimitation of our classification scheme; and it indicates the difficulties\nin trying to find a descriptive classification scheme.\nFigure 5 shows an example of a second type of SB transition, which we\ncall a "thick" SB. Hourly averages of B and a are shown in the top panel,\ntogether,with hourly averages of the proton temperature (T), density (N),\nand bulk speed (V). In this case the SB lasts a 12 hr. Note that P\nrotates out of the ecliptic and back again during the SB transition; a is\nnearly 900 where ^ appears to change by 180 0 . Recall that we have defined\na SB as a transition of\n\nB\n\nfrom one spiral direction to the opposite\n\ndirection. Since e s 0 for a spiral direction, the sector boundary\ntransition is defined by the variations in\n\nQ\n\nas well as in ^. In Figure 5,\n\nit happens that the SB is defined mainly by 0. Three additional\ncharacteristics of the SB in Figure 5 should be noted. First, the magnetic\nfield intensity is higher inside than outside; the SB is not a null sheet.\nSecond, a minimum variance analysis shows that B in the sector boundary\nrotates through N 180\xc2\xb0 in a plane. This is illustrated in the bottom of\nFigure 5\xe2\x80\xa2 The component of B in one direction (the minimum variance\ndirection, here labeled z) is very small The vector P rotates from one\nsector to the other in a plane perpendicular to z, i.e., the transition has\nthe same structure as the current sheet associated with a tangential\n\nt.\n\ni\n\ndiscontinuity. Third, the SB occurs just ahead of a stream at a stream\n\ns\ninterface, where T increases abruptly and N decreases (see Belcher and\nDavis, 1971 and Burlaga, 1979).\nIn some cases the SB transition is very complex. It may be difficult\nto identify a beginning or end; the magnetic field direction may fluctuate\nirregularly; and no simple patterns may be found. It is difficult to speak\nof the orientation or "the" internal structure of such sector boundaries.\nWe found three "complex" SBs like this. They will be discussed separately.\nTable 1 lists the 18 sector boundaries examined in this study. Eight\nare classified as thin, seven as thick, and 3 as complex. There is some\nsubjectivity in this classification. Pbr example, the thick SB on March 5,\n1973 might have been classified as "complex"; and the "thin" SB on June 16,\n1971, actually consists of several thin SBs. Nevertheless, our\nclassification is useful, and it is physically meaningful.\n3. Large-Scale Configurations\nConsider an isolated thin or thick SB in which the magnetic field\ndirection reverses by rotating uniformly in a plane (e.g., as in Figures 2\nand 5). It is reasonable to ex pect that the normal to the plane of\nrotation is the sane as the normal to the sector boundary surface. This\ncan be verified using simultaneous observations from two suitably separated\nspacecraft (e.g., Helios-1, 2 or Voyager-1, 2), but in lieu of such results\nwe shall assume it is true. A measure of planarity, a 2 /\' 31 is given in\nTable 1. (This cannot be determined for null sheets, in which B varies\nalong a line rather than in a plane.) One sees that for most thick SBs and\nfor the isolated, thin SBs that are not null sheets, the B vectors do lie\nclose to a plane (A 2/^ 3 > 2). Our assumption that the normal to this\nminimun variance plane is parallel to the SB surface normal is true only if\nthe SB is a tangential discontinuity, i.e., only if B is perpendicular to\nthe surface normal. Thus, we shall. consider only isolated events for which\nthe angle (a) between the minimum variance normal and the average P is\n"close" to 90\xc2\xb0. Lepping and Behannon (1979) showed that "close" is ^ 750\nfor measurements of directional discontinuities by an instrunent like that\non IMP-G.

Using OSO-7 observations of the white-light\ncorona to determine the configuration of coronal streamers and therbby\ninfer the orientation of the sector boundary surfaces between 3-10 R e , he\nshowed that the SBs of May 12, May 27, and June 10, 1973, were highly\ninclined with respect to the solar equator near the sun (Figure 8a). Our\nresults (Table 1) show that the sa,a= SBs were highly inclined with respect\nto the ecliptic (6 N = 20 0 , 36\xc2\xb0, -150 , respectively) near 1 AU. Our results\nare also consistent with the general orientations of near-sun sector\nboundaries computed from photophere magnetic field measurements for the\nperiod November 3, 1973-Februar y 16, 1974 (Burlaga A gl., 1978).\nThe conclusion that the 95 surfaces were highly inclined to the\necliptic might appear to conflict with the result of Smith 11 Al. (1978)\nthat SBs are confined to <r 16\xc2\xb0 latitude and with the result of Villante gt\nal._ (1979) that the SB surface was approximately a sinusoid with an\n\namplitude in latitude of s 10\xc2\xb0. Note, however, that their results were\nobtainer in 1976 near solar minimum, whereas our results refer to the\nperiod 1971 through 1973, near solar maximum and during the decline in\nsolar activity. In the latter period, it is known that there were\nlarge equatorial coronal holes, and Burlaga _t al. (1978) have shown how\nclosely spaced equatorial coronal holes can lead to highly inclined SB\nourfaces. By contrast, in the former per3 ,)d (1976) there were presumably\nfew if any large equatorial holes (Nolte et al., 1977) and the flows may\nhave originated at higher latitudes, giving a near-equatorial SB with a\nsmall inclination to the ecliptic most of the time. Thus, there may be a\nsolar cycle variation in the inclination of SB surfaces, as suggested\nschematically in Figure 8. Our results suggest such a relation, but they\ndo not prove it. It is important to carry out an analysis similar to ours\nfor SBs observed near solar minimum.\n\n4. pirept onal piseontinuitiep in and re ar\nti\n\nIt is well known that the interplanetary magnetic field is\n"discontinuous", i.e., a stationary observer finds that appro.:xately once\n\nT^-\n\n11\n\nor twice per hout^ the direction of p changes by ^ 30 0 in $ 30 sec. (Ness gg\ns\'11.., ,966; Burlaga and Ness, 1968; Burlaga, 1969; Siscoe gj ai., 1968).\nMany of these directional discontinuities are tangential discontinuities\n(see Burlaga _qt\n\n-U., 1977 and the references therein). We have found that\n\ndirectional discontinuities are present inside thick SBs and outside near\nall types of SB. Since tangential discontinuities are current sheets one\nmight ask whether the orientations of current sheets in and near SBs are\nrelated to the orientations of SB surfaces. If this were so, one would\nhave an additional tool for studying the morphology of SBs.\nWe identified directional discontinuities by inspection of 1-hr plots\nof 15s averages of B, 0,\n\n0 for the 4 -day intervals containing the SBs\n\nlisted in Table 1. Approxlinately 700 discontinuities were selected from N\n900 hrs of data. Each of these was analyzed using the minimum variance\nanalysis described above. In order to select the tangential\ndiscontinuities, we considered only events for which 1) A2\n\n3 > 2.0, 2) the\n\nchange in magnetic field direction (w) was > 60\xc2\xb0 (Fitzenre?.ter, private\ncommunication, showed that the condition w > 30\xc2\xb0 used in most previous\nstudies can lead to mistakes in identifying rotational discontinuities,\nbecause of certain systematic errors), and 3) the angle ( p ) between the\nminimum Variance direction and the average field vector was > 75 0 (Lapping\nand Behannon, 1979).\nTable 2 shows statistics describing the tangential discontinuities that\nwe selected in and near SBs. The rate of directional discontinuities was s\n11hr, consistent with previous results. Only a fraction of these (15%)\nwere selected for studies of n. \xe2\x80\xa2 phology, because of our conservative\ndefinition of a tangential discontinuity. There are two significant new\nresulta in Table 2: 1) The rate of these tangential discontinuities inside\nthick SB is essentially the same as that outside, and 2) The rate of\ntangential discontinuities with w > 120 0 is significantly higher inside SBs\nthan outside; these are not themselves SBs, since they mark no clear change\nfrom one sector polarity to another.\nThe normals which were determined for the tangential discontinuities by\nthe minimum variance analysis should be accurate to within several degrees.\nand O N for these normals are shown in Figure 9. As\n0\nexpected, the distributions for tangential discontinuities outside the SBs\nThe distributions of\n\ni\n^\'` ^{.^ ^...\'y. \t\n\nclosely resemble those published previously (Burlaga, 1969; Siscoe g1; a3,.,\n\n\'.^ ..y.. >u \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n>.\'\t\n\n. \'\n\n; h iW\t\n\n1 v\n`:\n\n\'^\'i.,^rrAFA.$,^FFr..,,.-....... _ . -\'-----^\xe2\x80\x94..__\n.,"^\'i.i\'Yi.^G.n\n\n12\n\n1968); the normals tend to be perpendicular to the spiral direction and at\nlatitudes between t45 0 . The 0N, ON distributions for tangential\ndiscontinuities inside thick sector boundaries are found to closely resemble\nthose outside SBs. In particular, the average directions and the range oe\ndirections of normals inside SBs are similar to those of normals outside.:\nInspection of normals in individual SBs shows that the scatter of normal\ndirections is large in almost every case. Thus, the results in Figure\nare not due to a coincidence in the orientations of SBs, but rather to the\nfact that discontinuities inside SBs have the same statistical orientations\nas those outside. We conclude that tangential discontinuities among the\ndirectional discontinuities in thick SBs cannot generally be used to\ndetermine the orientations of SBs.\n\n5. Magnetic Hples in and near Sector Boundaries\n\nAlthough we have shown that most SBs are not null sheets, it is\nnevertheless true that null sheets may often be found in SBs. In the\nfollows.; ,1j,soussion, we shall include current sheets in which the magnetic\nfield drops to low but nc1-zero values. These are called magnetic holes\n(Turner at -a- ., 1977) . An example of a thick SB containing magnetic holes\n1\n\n\'I\n\nin shown in Figure 10.\nMagnetic holes pass Earth at the rate of\n\nss\n\n1 to 2 per day (Turner g1:\n\nAl., 1977). We found a similar rate (0.06/hr or 1.4/day) for 15 hour\nintervals adjacent to the thick SBs which we selected. Inside the thick\nSBs, however, the rate was significantly higher--0.15/hr or 3.6/day. The\nabsolute rates for holes inside and \'outside SBs depend. on our subjective\nselection. procedure, but the relative rate (inside to outside), which is\nthe most significant number, is not sensitive to the selection procedure.\nConsidering that SBs occur in low-speed flows, the ratio of the spatial\n"density" of magnetic holes inside SBs to that outside is N 0.15/0.06 =\n2.5. A pr r\n^ponderanca of magnetic dips in SBs was also noted by Behannon\nand Neubauer (1979).\nThe rate at which magnetic holes are observed in and near thick and\nthin SBs, depends on the distance from the sector boundary. This is shown\nin Figure 11 where the number of magnetic holes in successive 3-hr\nintervals is plotted as a function of the time before and after the passage\n\n;.\n\n;".\t\n\na ,^.l .AN. _.^:3:45ex4^^r\'. +,..\n`\n\n\t\n\ntf^.

Clearly, most magnetic holes\noccur between 0 to 12 hrs after the passage of the center of a SB.\nSector boundaries usually occur 0-12 hr ahead of stream interfaces when\ninterfaces are present. This is shown in Figure 11F, where the time of the\nstream interface relative to the time of the center of the sector boundary\nis shown by the vertical lines on the abcissa. We have plotted the rate of\nmagnetic holes with respect to the time of the stream interface (Figure\n11b) for 15 hrs before and after each interface. Here one sees a clear\npeak at the time of passage of the stream interface, suggesting that the\nholes are more closely related to the interfaces than to the center-s of\nSBs. An interface represents the transition between two flows. The\nmagnetic holes near interfaces could be due to material trapped between the\nadjacent converging flows near the sun, or they might be due to some\ninstability at the interface.\n\n6. Summar y\n\nWe have examined the orientations of sector boundaries (SBs) observed\nby IMP-6 between January 1971-January 1974, choosing only those cases with\nrelatively complete sets of plasma and magnetic field data within i2 days\nof the SB. It was found that the durations of the SBs were either\nrelatively short (N 10 min) or relatively long (s 3 hr); hence we\nclassified them as "thin" and "thick". We distinguished relatively simple\nboundaries (in which there was a well-defined minimum variance direction)\nfrom complex boundaries. It was assumed that if the magnetic field changed\ndirection by rotating in a plane with a negligible component of\n\n9 normal to\n\nthe plane, then that plane was ; p arallel to the surface of the SB. Using\nthe minimum variance technique, it was found that the sector boundary\nasurfaces were inclined appreciably with respect to the ecliptic at this\ni\n\nepoch of the solar cycle (1971-1973)\xe2\x80\xa2 However, it was suggested that this\nmight be due to the presence of near-equatorial coronal holes, and it was\nnoted that the inclinations of the sector boundary surfaces might be\ndifferent at another epoch, when there are no near-equatorial coronal\nholes.\nWe examined the orientations of tangential discontinuities among\ndirectional diacontinuities near all SBs, and inside thick SBs, considering\n\n1\t\n\n\'li\n\n\t\n\nr\n3 r"u^^:^a^"P.}\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^.n%La.S^ Z\'.\xe2\x80\xa2 rA\t\n\nL\t\n\n..\'....`,u!}is\'??:chvk^Jrvi+...:... .:....... ....\n\ni,\nx\n^t\n1\n9\n\n14\n\n{g\n\nf\n\nJ\n^d\n\nthe possibility that they might be related to the orientations of the SBs.\nHowever, the distributions of their normals were very similh. to the\ncorresponding distributions for tangential discontinuities located away\nfrom SBs.\nMagnetic holes were found in and near sector boundaries at a higher\nthan average rate. This appears to be related to the proximity of magnetic\nholes to stream interface and converging flows rather than simply to the\nSBs themselves.\n\nI\ni\t\n\nY\n\na\n\nK\n3\n\n.\n\nr\' ^\'\xe2\x80\x94 ^\n\n^^^: .
