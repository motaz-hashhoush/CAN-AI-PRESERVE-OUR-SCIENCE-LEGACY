More than 3,000\npeople attended, coming from all 50 states, the District of\nColumbia and over 15 foreign countries. The convention was\nmeant to allow the blind to speak to blind tole models, attend\ninformative meetings and learn about current technological\ndevelopments that are improving life for the blind.\nDiaz\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to be a keynote speaker was one step\namong many in the forging of a relationship between NASA\nand the NFB.

In late April, though, they made\nthe first attempt to collect dusr particles\nfrom a very specific target - comet\nGrigg-Skjellerup - when Earth passed\n.through the dust stream created by the\ncomet as i t flew around the sun.\nRecently, scientists had no way of\nknowing the cosmic origin of the dust\nparticles they collected. Using a coniputer model developed by Dr. Scott\nMessenger, a researcher in the Office of\nAstromaterials Research and Exploration\nScience at NASA Johnson Space Center,\nthey were able to determine exactly\nwhen to fly in order to catch a piece of\nthe comet they wanted to examine.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn effect, NASA is exploring the solar\nsystem with airplanes,\xe2\x80\x9d Messenger said.\n\nDLIS~\nstreams from comets are similar\nto those that produce meteor showers,\n\nbut they are different in several important\nways. The particles are much smaller\nthan meteor particles; the dust streams\nhit Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere at much lower\nspeeds, enabling the dust to survive entry\ninto the atmosphere without melting, and\nthese streams are very young.\nThis last aspect is what makes the\ncomet dust particles possible to identify\nin the dust collections, even among a\nvery abundant background of interplanetary dust. The fresher cometary dust\nparticles can be identified by their lack\nof solar flare damage tracks and implanted\ngas from the solar wind. Dust particles\nfrom comet Grigg-Sjkellerup will be\nidentified by a detailed examination of\nthe collected samples, a process that\ncould take years.\n\n'
