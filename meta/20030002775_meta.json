The Hand Held Ratioing Radiometer is an example of a ground use device. This device is being manufactured and sold by Barringer Research Limited under a patent license. The battery-powered unit, designed for field portable use, weighs 12 pounds. An added capability of the Ratioing Radiometer is that it simultaneously analyzes radiation intensities in two separate bands of the spectrum and calculates the ratio of one to the other which affords more positive identification of the material being analyzed.", "title": "Ground Use Sensor", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030002775, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030002775, "id": "b58fe435c099460bb1194d24334fbef3", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1982", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030002775.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030002775/downloads/20030002775.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030002775/downloads/20030002775.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030002775/downloads/20030002775.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
