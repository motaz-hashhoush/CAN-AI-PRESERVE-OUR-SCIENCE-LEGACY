Reda,\nAIAA-9 l-O169,29th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Jan.\n7-10, 1991.\n0\nThe active thermal isolation of the present invention 2\nis not limited to polyimide films/metal layers configurations. For example, a hot wire anemometer 40 is shown\nin FIG. 3 and comprises a sensing wire 42 soldered to\nand extending between two branching supports 47a and\n476. Sensing wire 42 is electrically connected to a con- 25\nstant temperature anemometer circuit, whereby a\nchange in the voltage supplied to the wire 42 to maintain a constant temperature is indicative of flow characteristics, as described above. Thermal insulation wires\n44a and 446 are respectively spiralled around opposite 30\nends of the sensing wire 42 and connected via respective lead wire pairs 46a and 466 to a controllable resistance developing circuit 48.\nThe anemometer 40 is conventionally affixed to the\nmodel such that the sensing wire 42 is located slightly 35\nabove the model surface and accordingly conduction to\nthe branching supports 47a and 476 occurs, increasing\nthe power necessary to maintain the specified temperature of the hot wire anemometer. To avoid this problem, wires 44a and 446 are heated and controlled as 40\ndescribed previously with respect to the lower sensor\n14. Thus, the spiralled wires control conduction from\nthe wire 42 to the supports 47a and 476, and not conduction to the model as in the previous embodiments. The\nthermal isolation of this embodiment is not as effective 45\nbecause it does not separate the wire 42 from the supports 47a, 476. A hot wire is not usually used to measure\nskin friction or shear stress because it is not in direct\ncontact with the surface of the model like a film.\nReferring now to FIG. 4, an embodiment is shown 50\nwherein a so-called \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d semiconductor sensor 50 is\nemployed. Such a smart sensor is described in detail in\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Use of Silicon Microsensors in Smart Skins for\nAerodynamic Research\xe2\x80\x9d by Debra A. Carraway, presented at the 14th International Conference on Instru- 55\nmentation in Aerospace Facilities, Oct. 27-31, 1991. In\na conventional configuration, the sensor 50 is affixed to\na silicon layer having an appropriately etched constant\ntemperature circuit, which in turn is affixed to the\nmodel. In this conventional configuration the semicon- 60\nductor sensor 50 would heat the model surface via the\nsilicon layer, creating a power demand to maintain the\nconstant temperature. As shown in FIG. 4, an active\nthermal isolation semiconductor 52 is placed between\nupper semiconductor sensor 50 and etched silicon layer 65\n54. Lower sensor 52 is operated in the same two modes\nas discussed previously to thermally isolate the upper\nsensor 50. As before, the total thickness of the upper\n\n6\n\nsensor 50, lower sensor 52 and silicon layer 54 sandwich\nis less than any thermal insulation necessary to thermally isolate a conventional smart sensor configuration\nfrom the model.\nThe present invention offers several advantages over\nthe prior art. Utilizing the first mode of operation, the\nconductive heat transfer to the model from the lower\nsensor or wires can be controlled with the same response time, and therefore the same temperature, as the\nupper hot film sensor or sensing wire in contact with the\nair flow. Utilizing the second mode, a fixed boundary\ntemperature is established for the upper sensor or hot\nwire to thermally isolate the upper sensor or hot wire.\nThis allows the response time of the upper sensor or hot\nwire, which is significantly better than the response\ntime of an internally heated model, to be employed.\nBoth modes have resulted in significant reductions in\nthe power requirements necessary to maintain a given\ntemperature of the upper sensor. Since heating requirements for conduction are reduced, the upper sensor and\nhot-wire can be operated at higher temperatures in\nconvective contact with the air flow within the operating limits of the particular system employed. These\nhigher operating temperatures correspond directly with\nthe ability to detect higher frequencies of boundary\nlayer turbulence. In addition, the thermal isolation of\nthe upper sensor and hot-wire results in the electronic\nfrequency response to a square wave input used in typical anemometer bridge tuning techniques being independent of any model thermal properties.\nThe foregoing results are achieved without any modification of the model interior or invasive degradation of\nthe model surface. The proposed stack arrangement of\nsensors can be bonded to most aerodynamic body surfaces including curved surfaces as known in the art and\ncan be removed after completion of the experiment.\nMany improvements, modifications and substitutions\nwill be apparent to the skilled artisan without departing\nfrom the spirit and scope of the present invention as\ndescribed in the present specification and defined in the\nfollowing claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
