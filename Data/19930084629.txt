On the other hand,. the commercial\nsources of these fuels do not seem to increase. There is even\ncause to fear that the supply will not keep up with the demand.\nThe result is a considerable increase in the price and an appreciable falling off in the quality, especially in comparison\nwith prewar fuels. The quality has become so. poor that automobilists, not without reason, often complain of the running of their\nvehicles. There is a tendency to attribute their difficulties to\nthe designing and construction of the vehicles, when it is really\ndue only to the fuels they are compelled to use. This situation\nhas often been made the object of investigation and various remedies have been proposed. It is well, therefore, to consider the\npresent functioning conditions of internal combustion engines.\n* From La TechniqU\xc3\xa8 Aeronautique, April 15, 1923, pp 576-579, and\nMay 15, 1923, pp. 607-618.\n\n- Fuels:Solid, Li quid and Gaseous.\nSolid fuels cannot be used in automobile and aviation engines.\nIt may be objected that satisfactory tests have been made with gas-ogens (ap-paratus for producing gases from solids), but no such device has been found very p ractical. It adds considerable to the\nweight of the vehicle and leaves too much to be desired in the matter of cleanliness, for its use to bebome general. As for aviation,\nits weight is absolutely prohibitive.\nGaseous fuels are of no more practical use, although they have\nbeen proposed by intelligent persons. Assuming a cubic meter of\nthe fuel to contain 15000 calories, the quantity that can be.-stored\nin any vehicle will still be small, unless we use very large containers capable of withstanding very high pressures. The use of.\nsuch containers would be very dangerous and, furthermore, the weight\nof a container holding 40 liters, for example, would have to be very\ngreat in order to withstand the high pressure.\nSuppose we wish to carry 30 kg. of fuel, hich is a minimum for\nany vehicle even of small dimensions. If this fuel should have\nabout the same density as the air (1.03 kg. per cu.m), its volume\nwould be about 29 cubic meters, which would have to be subjected to\na pressure of about 300 kg. in order not to require a container of\nover 100 liters capacity. Such a container would be much heavier\nthan its contents and its use would necessitate accessories which\nwould add still more weight. Even if its use should be possible on\nautomobile trucks, it would be extremely difficult on passenger ye-\n\n-3-.\nhides and absolutely impossible on airplanes.\nLi\xc3\xa7id_fuels offer real advantages. Like gases, they can be\nstored in containers of any shape, which may be very light, since\nthey only have to withstand the force of gravity. Liquid fuels\ncan be transmitted through light and inexpensive pipes... They are\nclean and easily handled. They contain a large amount of energy.\nin a small volume. These advantages amply justify the efforts made\nto procure liquid fuels. Automobiles and airplanes are destined\nto use liquid fuels for many years to come.\nNot all liquid fuels, however, are equally suited for use in\nexisting engines and it is well to call attention to a point of extremely great importance at the present time.\nFuel Delivery.\nDifferent fuels do not all behave the same and hence require\nspecial methods for their utilization. In large factories, liquidfuel engines usually function in a particular manner.\nFor example, let us take the Diesel engine. The fuel generally used in this type of engine is a petroleum product and is injected into the engine cylinder at the end of the compression\nstroke. The fuel is injected by means of compressed air. If the\nmechanism which regulates the quantity of fuel functions properly,\neach cylinder receives the right , amount of fuel for the weight of\nair admitted. If the fuel is also pToperiy atomized, the combustion will be sufficiently complete.\nIn automobile engines, the fuel is introduced in an entirely\n\n-4different manner, due to the fact that injection pumps which give\nexcellent results with engines under a constant or only slightly\nvarying load, are not adapted to automobile engines, which function\nunder greatly varying loads.\nAn automobile engine passes suddenly from a very small load\nat low speed to a full load at much higher speed; This occurs justin the period of time required for the machine to speed up, the\ndriver suddenly throwing the control mechanism to the position of\nfull speed and power and then throwing it back suddenly to the position of minimum power.\nThis manner of operation is not in conformity with the conditions for the successful utilization of the fuel-injection method.\nWe know of no case where it is giving complete satisfaction on high\nspeed engines. For this reason the fuel is introduced with the aid\nof a mechanism called "carburetor."\nHence, in speaking of fuels for automobile and airplane engines)\nwe must bear in mind this manner of introduction, which, as we shall\nsee, restricts the use of different fuels and requires of them certain qualifications.\nFiinctioning_pfAutomobile Carburetor.\nWhen\n\nthe engine revolves, it draws rir into the cylinders\n\nthrough a pipe connected with the carburetor. The latter consists\nin part of a tube formed by joining the smaller ends of two conical\ntubes,\n\nthus producing a constriction in which is placed the end of\n\nthe spraying nozzle. The velocity of the air in this constriction\n\n-5is quite high and causes a negative pressure or suction at the erd\nof the nozzle, thereby causing the fuel to be sprayed into the intake tube, the action being similar to that of a perfume atomizerIt is imp ortant for this spray to offer as large a surface as\npossible to the air and for the fuel particles to be as small as\npossible. The air, coming in contact with this spray, carries alOT\na portion of the fuel in the gaseous condition, the largeC portion,\nhowever, remaining in the form of a mist whose particles will vary\nin size according to the perfection of the apparatus and the natur\xe2\x82\xac\nof the fuel.\nIf this mist should enter the cylinders just as it is formed\nin the carburetor, the functioning of the engine would ordinarily\nbe perfect. Before reaching the cylinders, however, it is obliged\nto follow the bends of the pipes and to change direction according\nto which cylinder it is to enter.\nThe velocity of flow, on the other hand s is subject to quite\nlarge variations, especially in the intake manifold. Each cylinder only draws periodically. In a very short time, the flow of gas\nmust pass from a very high velocity to almost zero, producing\nchanges in direction, eddies, etc.\nThese various phenomena affect the com p osition of the mixture\nof air and fuel, the coarser drops tending to collect and form condensation nuclei. The condensed fuel is de p osited on the walls,\nwhence it follows the path of least resistance and of least change\nin direction.\nThe particles which have not been deposited (but which still\n\nhave considerable size and consequently a rather la-rgo. mass with relation to their surface) do not keep pace with the gases arid\nwise tend to follow the path of least resistance. This i\'esJts in\nsome cylinders receiving a richer mixture than others.\nHeating the Intake Pipes.\nIn order to remedy this defect, the intake pipes are heated,\neither by sinking them in the c ylinders or by surrounding them with\nhot-water jackets. The heating thus accom p lished diminishes the\ncondensation, though not perfectly. The mixture remains in the\npipes for too short a time and the particles of fuel are too large\nto absorb sufficient heat to vaporize them completely.\nSometimes this difficulty is obviated by heating the air before it enters the carburetor, for example, by causing it to circulate \'about the exhaust pipe. Thus, the air acquires a higher temperature and the proportion of fuel vaporized is increased. The\nunvaporized portion of fuel is also heated (or rendered less cold),\nits viscosity is diminished, it becomes better diffused and the\nsurface area of the particles increases with relation to their\nweight.\nThe mixture is improved in both cases but it is not expedient\nto heat the air very much before it enters the cylinders, on account of the resulting e:cparisin in volume and consequent diminution in the mass introduced per unit of time thereby causing a\ncorresponding decrease in engine power.\n\nV\xc3\xa0dium in the Pipes.\nFrom what has been g id above (that when the engine is running at a reduced speed, its functioning is improved) it may be\nremarked that the vacuum in the pipes has increased. If, by some\ndevice, the temperature can be kept from falling appreciably, the\nfuel will vaporize more readily under this reduced pressure, the\nfuel-charged air will be farher below the saturation point and the\nmixture will remain more homogeneous.\nWe see, therefore, that .in order to obtain a suitable mixture,\nit is necessary for the properties of the fuel to answer certain\'\nrequirements, especially for the vaporization to take place as\neasily as possible and for the viscosity to be as small as possible.\nPractical tests have enabled us to define, at least in part,\nthe qualities answering both requirements. Before proceeding farther, we wish to say, however, that it is not only necessary for\nthe proportions by weight to be correct in each cylinder but also\nfor the m i xture to be perfectly homogeneous, in order to secure\nperfect combustion.\nIt is readily understood that if the fuel is in the form of\nlarge particles in the air at the instant of ignition, the combustion will be slow, with the formation of deposits in the cylinder\nand the emission Of smoke through the exhaust pipe. When the particles are smaller and the diffusion is more conrlete, the combustion will be more rapid and will be completed in the first part of\nthe.\n\ntower stroke.\n\n-8The points just mentioned are all the more important when th\nengine under consideration is required to develop more power J\n\n.n\n\nportion to its dimensions\nOn high-powered engines ) it has been found necessary to have\nlarge cylinder orifices, pipes of large diameter and carburetors .of\nlarge capacity. In order to reduce the losses from the time the\nfuel enters the carburetor till it enters the cylinders, it is necessary to reduce naturally and simultaneously the suction in the\ncarburetor and intake pipe and consequently the intake velocity, so\nthat the fuel used for such an engine will, even more than for ordinary engines, develop its best qualities.\nIt is, moreover, in designing aviation engines that the necessity for fuels to ansv:er special requirements has made itself felt\nmost emphatically. Accidents kept occurring with disquieting frequency and without apparent cause, either as regards the materials\nused, the design or the const:ucrbiorr Constructors made many investigations gradually removing all causes considered capable of\ncausing such accidents, but were finally forced to admit that the\ninitial cause was the qualities of the fuel employed\nAcceptance Conditions of Aviation Fuels\nChief -oroerties of most common fuels.\nBenzene\nHeptare\nAlcohol\t\nChemical formula\n\n02HSOH\n\nC6 H,.\n\nQ,7 H16\n\nSpecific gravity at 15 0 d\n\n0.796\n\n0.704\n\nSpecific heat at 15 0 C\n\n0.540\n\n0.502\n\nCyclohexane\n\n1\t\n\n0.889\t\n0400\n\nI\n\n0.784\n0.500\n\n\t\n\n-9Chief prope\t\nSubstance\t\n\nes of most --ommo\nAlcohol I Re ptane\t\n7R.2\t\n\nBoiling point \t\nHeat of vaporization\nat normal boiling\npoint.\n\n206\n\nBI, eazene\t\n\nCyc1ofleXa1?\n\n98\t\n\n80:2\t\n\n8C9\n\n74\n\n94.4\n\n85\n\n9830\n\n10500\n\n7200\n\n11000\n\nCoef.\t of viscosity\nat 20 0\n\n0.01192\n\n0.00379\n\n0.00649\n\n0.62\n\nCoef.\t of0viscosity\nat .80\n\n--\n\n0.00232\n\n0.00327\n\n0.40\n\nHeat of combustion\n\n1\n\nCapillary constant\nat 20C\n\n30at12\n\n--\n\nThese fuels may be classified as follows:\nAlcohol family (methyl and ethyl alcohol);\nBenzene\t\n\nU\t\n\n(aromatic hydrocarbons);\n\nMarshgas hydrocarbons (American petroleum);\nHydro-arornatic hydrocarbons.\nWe might add to this list other hydrocarbons whose composition\nis intermediate between the ones just mentioned, but they would be\nof no importance here. The power obtainable from them would differ\naccording to the fuel employed.\nThe large heat content already mentioned would not determine\nthe power of an engine using either one of them, since this evidently depends on their chemical composition and consequently on the vieight of air required for their combustion. The quantity of\nheat carried away by the water vapor should also be deducted.\nFrom the viewpoint of the heat developed in the engine and the\n\n-10maximum attainable power, it is more important to determine the\nheat developed by a given quantity of gas.\nAlcohol.- It requires 5.921 liters of air to burn a cubic centimeter of alcohol, i.e. to liberate 4.979 calories; or, per liter\nof air 4.98/5.921\t\n\n0.84 calorie.\n\nBenzene.- It requires 9.531 liters of.air to burn one cubic\ncentimeter of benzene, thereby liberating 8.34 calories; or\n8.34/9.581 = 0.87 calorie per liter of air.\nGasoline.- It requires 9.101 liters of air to burnofle cubic\ncentimeter of gasoline, thereby liberating 7.1 calories; or\n7.1/9.101 = 0.785 calorie per liter of air.\nHence the benzene hydrocarbons apear to be the best from\nthis point of view, alcohol coming next. Nevertheless, in order\nto obtain the same power for the same period of time, so% more alcohol than gasoline would be required. In order to equalize the\ncost, the relative prices would have to be 2 for gasoline and about\n1.25 for alcohol. These figures are only indicative, since the\nheat equivalents of different samples vary greatly.\nWe have added cyclohexane, which is of some importance as will\nbe shown farther on.\nInfluence of Physical Characteristics.\nDensity.- Gasoline has th? lowest mean density. This is a\nvery important factor, especially as regards the functioning of\nthe spraying nozzles when the engine is pickin g up.\nCD\n\nIf the inertia of the liquid column delays the mixing at the\n\n- 11 moment of picking up, the first cylinder charges will be too poor\nand may burn so slowly that there will still be flames in the cylinder when the intake valve opens. This causes backfiring into\nthe carburetor, which is often the cause of fire.\nThis defect may be remedied, either by employing an additional air valve which oens easily, or by the previously mentioned\nimmersed nozzle, which facilitates the prompt emission of the fuel\nwhen the engine begins to nic-k up. From the point of view of the\ncomposition of the mixture in the pipe, the density of the gasoline thus indicated cannot be taken as an absolute value, since it\nis simply the result of the mean densities of the substances constituting the mixture.\nAlcohol and benzene have greater densities than gasoline. \t\nThis is quite a serious disadvantage, especially for benzene, first\nbecause of its chemical composition, and secondly, because too\ngreat a density increases the difficulty of obtaining a fine enough\nspray. If, however, the picking-up device is efficacious, the other characteristics may offset the disadvantages due to the density.\nSpecific heat.- This is lowest for benzene, but only partially\noffsets the disadvantages due to the greater density of benzene,\nbecause the difference between the specific heat of benzene and the\nother fuels is small. The specific heat of alcohol is higher and,\nconsequently, it would be necessary to heat more strongly the carburetor, designed to run with alcohol, in order to make it absorb\na quantity of heat sufficient to vaporize, at least partially, a\nportion of the liquid.\n\n-,\n\n- 12 -.\nBoiling point.- Alcohol has the advantage in this respect,\nbut, considering its spccific heat, it is nevertheless necessary\nto heat it more, in order to impart sufficient heat to the carbu ret or.\nGasoline has a boiling point y of 98\xc2\xb0C. In reality, this is\nthe boiling point of one of its constituents. We will see farther\nalong that gasoline is a mixture of substances which distil at\nwidely varying temperatures.\nBenzene and cyclohexane have practically the same boiling\npoint. The specific heat of benzene is lower than that of cyclo-hexane and yet, as regards its use in engines, the latter is decicedly better. This is due in part, as we have already stated,\nto their chemical composition and in part to their relative density\nHeat of vaporization and vapor tension.- The greater the\namount of heat required for vaporization, the greater the amount\nof heat to be supplied to the carburetor. The curve of the vapor\ntensions, in terms of pressure and temperature, is also important.\nPractically, the lightest constituents of gasoline, other things\nbeing equal, have the highest vapor tension. The greater this\ntension, the greater the percentage of vapor in the mixture.\nViscosit y and surface tension.- Viscosity necessitates an increase in the diameter of the conduits, but we must consider also\nthe surface tension opposed to the separation of the liquid into\nsmall particles. If the fuel is in an atmosphere whose pressure\nis quite low and whose temperature is high enough to convert a\nportion of it into vapor with a vapor tension sufficiently high\n\n- 13 with relation to the pressure of the medium, this change of condition greatly favors the obtention of a very fine mist by coriininution of the drops.\nIf the fuel is heated, for example, between the float chamber\nand the jet, the diffusion is greatly improved, the surface-tension diminishes quite rapidly as the temperature rises and the more\nvolatile portions evaporate. Moreover, the evaporated portions\nmechanically facilitate the dispersion of the drops and the mixture is rendered more homogeneous.\nDistillation curve.- The "heat of vaporization, "boiling\npoint," "specific heat" and "vapor tension" all come in for consideration and, in order to take account of them in a general way,\nthe official specifications for American gasolines stipulate certain limits in the curve of-fractional distillation.\nIt is important for a portion of the gasoline to evaporate\nat quite a low temperature, in order to form a sufficiently fine\nmist in the carburetor. in fact, the vaporization of.\xc3\xa1. portion\nof the liquid facilitates ignition in the engine and also helps the dissemination of the jet and, consequently, the formation of\na sufficiently fine mist.\nIt is especially important to prevent the furnishing of gasoline containin.9 substances which evaporate at too high a temperature. The most refractory substances in the gasoline s h ould ..distil below 1300 C, In order to give satisfaction in an autobj].e\nengine.\n\n-\n\n14 -\n\nU\n\nInfluence of Chcitii cal Cornooiit ion.\nOn examining the \xc2\xb1\'orilas of the various fuels (alcohol, gaoline arid benzeie), we find that benzciie has the largest proportic.\nof carbon with reference to the hydrogen. Ex p erience has.taught\nus that the richer a fuel is in carbon, the more difficult it is to\nobtain perfect combustion.\nThe composition of the mixture of air and benzene must be very\ncarefully controlled, in order to obtain correct combustion and\nprevent carbon deposits in the cylinders and, on the other hand,\nthe formation of carbon monoxideAlcohol and gasoline burn much easier, provided, of course,\nthey are mixed with air in the correct proportions.\nCyclohexane is pa:ticularly interesting in this connection.\nIt can be produced by causing benene to absorb hydrogen. Experiments with this substance, in comparison with an aviation gasoline\nof good quality, furnish interesting results We give a few figures below.\nThese experiments were made on an engine with 8 cylinders of\n120 mm bore and 170 mm stroke, the atrnosph3ric conditions being as\nfollows: temperature 23 0 C, barometric pressUre 759 mm.\nThere were tested on the same day; a gasoline (which we will\ncall "gasoline No.1011 ) with a distillation curve exceeding 145; another .gasoline ("gasoline No.20 11 ), whose distillation curve exceedi.e similar to the curve accompanying the present article;\na-3clohexafle.

In this connection, we will add the summary of a report made after the examination\nand testing of a fuel found on a German airplane during the war"This fuel has a distillation curve ending at about 135 0 0, or\nvery near that of the best French gasoline. It contains a number\nof cyclic hydrocarbons (of the aromatic series), its composition\nbeing:\nMarshgas hydrocarbons 10%\nCyclic\t\n\nit\n\n85\n\nBenzene\t\n\nIt\t\n\n5\n\nIn the few tests made with this fuel, the engines functioned especially well, due probably to the presence of the cyclic hydrbcarbons. These cyclic hydrocarbons must have been introduced into the\nfuel either by conversion of benzene hydrocarbons or in some other\nmanner, since it is improbable that fuel of this composition came\nfrom the distillation of any natural petroleum-\'t\nObservations made during Tests on Aviation Engines.\nAs already mentioned, a series of systematic investigations\nwere made which justify this conclusion and render it possible to\n\n-\t\n\n-\n\nspecify the essential characteristics of aviation fuels.\nFor gasoline from American petroleum (composed of marshgas\nhydrocarbons), these characteristics have been defined as follows:\nAppearance: colorless;\nOdor: only that peculiar to pure gasoline, hence no odor of\nbenzene, sulphur compounds, etc.;\nSpecific gravity: abou- 0.71 at 150C;\nAcidity: none; must be neutral.\nThe most important point, aside from purity, is the distillation curve. This point is, in fact, of relatively much greater\nimportance than the specific gravity, because it is always possible\nto increase the specific gravity of a gasoline that is too light,\nwhich may be done for the purpose of disguising very poor gasoline.\nObviously, however, the specific gravity must not vary too\nmuch, because it would necessitate new carburetor adjustments and\ndifferent sized nozzles\nA higher specific gravity does not help the engine, to pick\nup, but just the contrary. For a given distillation curve, however, the specific gravity does not vary greatly. It is essential\nfor fuels to contain some volatile substances evaporating below\n1000 C. These substances evaporate in the air forming a permanent\nvapor which will persist until the entrance into the cylinders and\nwill facilitate the priming for the start. On the other hand, the\ndistillation curve must not extend too far into the temperature\nscale. If it does, the mist formed is not nearly so fine, the\nparticles are coarser and the disadvantages already mentioned are\n\n- 17 accentuated.\nIt is also quite worthy of note that the heat equivalent of\nthe fuel passes to the second plane with reference to the curve of\ndistillation. Tests were made with two gasolines, for one of\nwhich the distillation curve went to about 135 0 0 and measured\n10750 gram-calories with the Maiher bomb. Another gasoline, whose\ndistillation curve went to 152, gave 11200 calories, or 450 calories more than the first. The second gasoline did not enable the\nengine to develop as much power as the first. The following are\nthe figures:\n1. An 9-cylinder engine, bore 120 mm, stroke 150 mm, developed\n171 HP at 1402 R.P.M., with gasoline at 10750 calories, and a fuel\nconsumption per HP/hr of 246 grams;\n2. With gasoline at 11200 calories, the same engine was not\nable to develop a power of more than 160 H? at 1373 R.P.M. and the\nfuel consumption had to be carried to 263g per HP/hrThis proves that a portion of the gasoline vTas poorly burned,\njust because some of the cylinders received too much gasoline and\nothers not enough, as a consequence of the lack of homogeneity of\nthe mixture of fuel and air.\nThe experiments relating to the properties of the gasoline\nlasted several months, but were all made in comparison with the\nsame standard gasoline. Parallel tests were made the same day on\nthis standard gasoline and the gasoline under investigation, so as\nJ_\n\neliminate any brrors which might otherwise arise from changes\n\nin weather conditions or even in the condition of the engine at the\n\n- 18 time of the test- In order to execute them, two gasoline tanks\nwere so arranged that, by the simple turn of a three--say cook,\nthe engine could be supplied with either one of the gasolines.\nAmong the many tests, we will describe one made with a very\npoor gasoline. An engine similar to the one already mentionedhad been compelled by the military authorities to undergo accept-ance tests several times. The constructors wished to find out\nwhether it would be possible, however, to make it function properly by increasing the quantity of gasoline burned. By a suitable\ndevice the consumption per horsepower had been raised to 350 grams.\nAt 1500 R.P.M. it was impossible to get over 100 HP and, notwithstanding the large quantity of gasoline consumed, the test had to\nbe stopped on account of the erratic functioning, which indicated\na bad condition of some of the parts. In fact, on inspecting the\nengine, it was found that some of the pistons had been injured\nby the excessively high temperature to which it had been subjected, while others indicated a considerable excess of fuel.\nAs already mentioned, an arrangement had been consummated\nwhich made it possible to supply an engine at will with either one\nof two fuels. With this arrangement, the engine was started on a\ngasoline of good quality. It functioned normall y , did not vibrate and its power corresponded to the calculations.\nThe poor gasoline was then turned on and in a few minutes\n(the time required for displacing the good gasoline already in the\ncarburetor) the engine began to vibrate, the color of the flames\nchanged (dark in some cylinders, short and bright in others) and\n\n- 19 the functioning kept growing worse, while the engine vibrated iriclently and lost power. When the good gasoline wa.s now turned on,\nthe vibrations gradually ceased and the engine resumed its normal\nfunctioning and power.\nIn some instances it was possible to improve the functioning\n(especially in winter) by heating the gasoline just before it entered the carburetor, thus raising its temperature 25 or 300.\nObviously the heating of the gasoline diminished its viscosity,\nsurface tension and also the cooling effect due to the evaporation\nof a portion of the gasoline, and thus enabled a more perfect\ndiffusion.\nIn order to remove the defects, the military authorities decided that aviation gasoline should fulfill the following conditions of distillation:\n5% below 600C,\n55%\t\n95\t\n\nU\t\n\n950\n1200\n\nThe last 30th of the distillate should not have a specific\ngravity of over 0.75 at 150C.\nThe above conditions are fulfilled bytlie American gasolines\nmost commonly used in France.\nAutomobile Gasoline.\nFor automobiles, excepting the first minutes of starting in\nthe morning (especially in winter), the conditions are less exacting. Here, in fact:\n\n- 20 1. The neighboring air is heated by radiation from the engine\nand especially from the exhaust plpes;\n2. Before entering the carburetor, the air is considerably\nheated by coming in contact- with the radiator;\n3. Warmer fuel is delivered to the sprayer nozzle.\nIt is well to remember that the heating is much more intense\nin summer and that, in order to improve the functioning of the engine, it is better to take the air directly from the outside atmosphere. Under the hood, the temperatureof the air at the level\nof the carburetor may easily reach 45 to 50 0 C on hot. . summer days.\nLastly, there is usually a greater negative pressure in the\ncylinders of. a running automobile engine than in the intake pipe.\nOther things being equal, we may therefore accept, for automobiles,\nfuels whose density curve runs a little higher, e.g. to 135 or\n1400 0. The latter temperature is a maximum, the mean specific\ngravity at 15 0 C being 0.725.\nPresent Status of the Problem.\nLet us examine, on the accompanying curves, the gasolines offered for automobiles. They may be classified in three categories:\n1. "Extra" gasoline.- Very dear and practically unobtainable;\n2. "Tourist gasoline.- Best now obtainable;\n3. Heavy gasoline.- The engines are well adapted for using\nsuch a fuel, though the efficiency is not especially high.\nOn examining the curve for the "extra" gasoline, we find that\n\n- 21 it approaches the conditions enumerated above for aviation gasoline. Though slightly less volatile, this gasoline is still very\ngood. The curve for u touristt gasoline is bad, though its mean\ndensity is not so high as the above.\n- We will now consider its distillation curve. At 100 0 C only\n26% distils. This is hardly half what distils with the first gasdine. It contains substances which distil only at about 1700C,\nthe temperature of the radiator water being about 80 0 C.. Obviously\ncarburetion becomes ver y difficult. Such a fuel is bound to give\ntrouble, especially with a cold engine. If we attempt to burn the\nlast portions of the distillate from this gasoline, we find that\nit will ignite only after considerable heating and that it burns\nwith difficulty.\nAs to the third fuel, it is almost petroleum. It frequently\ncontains benzene in appreciable proportions. We have found 8% of\nsubstances eliminatable by nitration. These were probably added\nto improve the curve of distillation.\nThese three gasolines, obtained from one of the best firms,\nwere all distilled recently and therefore fairly represent those\nnow on the market.\nConclusions.\nEvidently engines run with these fuels, but the complaints\nheard--are justified.\nBy intense heating, it is possible to burn a heavy fuel, but\nthe power is diminished, the engine carbonizes more rapidly and\n\n- 22 the consumption of fuel increases. There is also danger of accidents to the valves and spark plugs, if the en gine is designed for\na high efficiency relative to the charge.\nIt seems probable that gasolines will not improve. In fact,\nthe countries producing them employ gasolines perhaps even poorer\nthan we use in France. This is simply due to the fact that the\nconsumption of gasolines has become so great that the production\nof the oil wells is becoming insufficient. In order to increase\nthe production of the light oils, it has become necessary to raise\nthe final temperature of the fractional distillation.\nThe new industry therefore finds itself facing a difficult\nproblem. If the quality of the gasolines does not improve but\ngrows poorer, constructors, automobilists and all those interested\nmust unite their efforts. Constructors must evidently invent new\ndevices for the practical utilization of less volatile fuels. It\nis, in fact, possible to make a suitable mixture in the carburetor\nwith a heavy fuel, but this is only one phase of the problem. The\nmixture must pass from the carburetor into the intake pipes, where\nits equilibrium is maintained with difficulty. In the cylinder it-\n\nself, during the phases of intake and compression, homogeneity cannot always be maintained. This justifies the construction of the\nindustrial engine employing heavy oils, which are injected at the.\nend of the compression stroke. This difficulty in the cylinder\ncan be partially remedied, however, by various devices. The intake pipes present the greatest difficulties, the mixing being only\nbegun in the carburetor. The mixture must assume its final form\n\n- 23 during its pasage through the intake pipes. This problem is a\nvery difficult one.\nIt will be necesaiy to ineetigate with four or six cylinders (8 and 12 cylinders being only multiples) the essential conditions for producing a mixture containing the highest percentage of\nvaporized liquid, the rest being in the form of an invisible mist.\nFor intake pipes of different shapes, it is.irnportant to obtain the pressure curves for the characteristic points, in order\nto determine their influence on the state of the mixture. Thus\nwe can determine the best shapes and the ratios of the lengthsof\nthe straight parts to the diameters with relation to the speed and\nthe number of cylinders.\nThe different methods of heating must be compared: the separate heating of the fuel, air and walls and also simultaneous\nheating.\nThe requisite number of carburetors for relieving the successl ye suction stresses and for supplying widely separated points in\nthe intake pipes must be determined, as also any correction necessitated by the addition of special substances to the principal fuel\nfor failitating the formation of the mixture and for rendering it\nstable. The curves of the distribution mechanism should also be\nstudied.\t\n\n-\n\nAfter making this investigation (while taking account of the\nfuels likely to be used, which will also be the objects of investigations concerning their physical and chemical characteristics),\nthere will be occasion to examine substitutes for the carburetor-\n\n- 24 in its present form, without its being necessary, however, to adopt\nthe Deisel type.\nThe problem is to form in each eyllnder a homogeneous mixture\nof fuel and air sufficiently stable to maintain this condition until ignited. The mixture must r.emain correct as to mean proportions\nand homogeneity, whatever the density of the charge, i.e. whatever\npower Is required of the engine.\nThe task will be long and difficult, especially as the present\ntendency is to require engines to be light and economical. The dilficulties are just so many more reasons for discussing the subject\nfrankly.\nIt . is still more important to consider seriously the means for\nassuring France an economical supply of good fuel.\nFrench Fuel.\nThere has been much said about a national (French) fuel and\nmany persons see in this only the employment of alcohol. To us\nthis seems to beg the question.\nA national fuel should enable us to keep up and improve the\nconstruction of engines. The utilizable heat of mixture of fuel and\nair should be equal to that obtainable with the bet foreign fuel.\nThe quantity of fuel available on French continental soil should\nenable us to dispense with foreign fuel, since, in the event of war,\nthe sea may be more or less closed to traffic, thereby rendering\ncolonial supplies precarious.\nThere is danger that the production of alcohol by distillation\n\n- 25\'of vegetable products may he insufficieni, although doubtless\nlarge. It may be objected that it is possible to obtain alcohol\nby synthesis, but alcohol has on rather great dLsadvantage especially in aviation. For the same numbeT of caicries, alcohol\nrequires much larger tanks than gasoline; consequently more space\nand more weight\nAside from alcohol, France has a little benzene and quite a\nlarge quantity of shale oil. It is therefore advisable to utilize\nfirst and to the best advantage all these resources (se parately insufficient) in order to enable usto dispense with foreign fuels.\nThere are still other solutions, proposed by F rench chemists which\nmay be the reason we do not know about them.\nProfessor Sabathier has shown us how to convert heavy oils\ninto light oils (See catalysis in Sabathier.s organic chemistry),\na method which consists in modifying the process of cracking by\ncompleting it With the hydrogenation of the products. This transformation, however, is only partial. it suff1cs; in fact, to\ncause the distillation curve from a maximum of 180 to\' 135, for\nexample.\nIt is known how to convert acetylene into benzene and the\nabove-mentioned scientist of Toulouse shows us how benzene may be\nconverted into cy clohexane by a very good method, the latter substance being, as we have already seen, a fuel of the first order.\nThe oils of shale and coal and the naphthalines can also undergo\ncertain modifications, as indicated by the same Professor, and\nthus furnish a considerable quantity of light fuel.\n\n- 26 Another scientist, Mr. Maiihe, who has worked much with Prof.\nSabathier, has just shown us, in a report of the Academy of Sciences, that vegetable oils can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons, concluding as follows.\n"This catalytic process makes it possible to start with a\nvegetable oil in the preparation of gasoline and petroleum of a\nmixed nature, capable of being used as a fuel. They are soluble\nin alcohol in any proportion.\nIt seems that animal oils (fish oils, for example), are also\ncapable of being converted.\nLastly, coal itself can be much better utilized. By destructive distillation, coal yields combustible gases utilizable in\nstationary engines and a number of substances which (from benzene\nto tar) can either be used directly or can be converted into substances utilizable in an engine.\nAt a recent fuel convention, Prof. Sabathier made special mention of the conversion of naphthaline into a new substance "tetra\nline" capable of figuring in the list of utilizable fuels.\nThese results, which were obtained by the personal efforts of\na few scientists, can, with much greater facilities, be considerably enlarged and may open- up unsuspected vistas.\nMixed Fuels.\nIt is quite probable that we shall be obliged to adopt a mixture of different substances, in order to produce a French fuel in\nsufficient quantity to provide for the increasing use of internal\n\n-27combustion engines.\nThe adoption of such a mixture will demand a very thorough inv estigatjori, in order that Its composition and cha:cacterjstjcs may\nalways be the same. It is therefore desirable to defins the limits within which the proportions must come, \'out, if this is somewhat difficult in order to assure the uniformity Of composition,\nthe mixture may, on the other hand, offer certain advantages.\nIt is known that benzene, toluene and the alcohols enable a\nhigher degree of compression than the gasolines obtained from the\naromatic p etroleums. The mixture may therefore be made insuch\nr op\nP\nortions as to increase the compression, but it is, of course,\nZ.\n\ndesirable to adopt proportions in accord with the possibilities\nof production of each constituent and also, to a certain extent,\nin accord with the results of very carefully conducted tests on\naviation engines.\nFurthermore, fuels for internal combustion engines comprise\ntwo classes:\na)\n\nFuels for automobile engines or heavy loads;\n\nb)\n\nFuels for aviation engines.\n\nThe latter have a different composition and can be more expensive.\nIt does not come within the scope of this article to determine\nthe best m ixtures. This would, moreover, be decidedly premature,\nsince the study of fuel proddation has thus far hardly been attempted in the domain of scientific research. Only after having determined, from the conercjal point of view, the quantity of the pjn\n\n- 28 cipal substances capable of entering into the mixture, can we proceed to the above-mentioned, tests. Only after the completion of\nthese tests, whh will necessarily be many and consequently of\nlong duration, will it be possible to adopt definite mixtures. It\nseemed advisable, however, to call attention to the possibility of\naM disadvantages\nthese mixtures and to the advantages/involved in their use.\nSources of Energy.\nThere is one more point which should receive attention, namely\nthe quantity of energy required for the manufacture of fuels.\nWhether produced by distillation or catalyssis or by any other chemical or physical reaction, their conversion necessitates an outlay\nof energy, so that it is desirable, while seeking methods of conversion, to seek also to determine the quantity of energy required\nto accomplish the transformations and to utilize, in -so far as possible, the forces nature puts at our disposal, by employing preferably, of course, those which are not already utilized and are being\nwasted, such, for example, as the forces produced by waterfalls,\nrivers, winds and tides or the energy obtained from the atmosphere\nin the form of electricity.\nThe source of energy must, in fact, be very prolific, considering the large quantity of fuel required. There must be sufficient\nenergy to leave no cause for uneasiness as regards any possible increase in the use of internal combustion engines, an increase which\nmay be very rapid in the event of war.\nIf we assume, for instance, that the quantity of energy requjr_\n\n- 29 ed for the various transformations is equal to 20% of the energy\ncontained in the fuel In its final form, it amounts to 200 7 000 HP\non the basis of an annual production of 600,000,000 liters\n\n(158,500,000 gallons)\nIt is therefore advisable to coordinate the efforts in both\ndirections, for, however fine the chemical method of production\nmight be, it would become burdensome in proportion as the final\ncost of the product should exceed the cost of the imported article.\nIt would then be very difficult to carry out such a proposition,\nsince it would conflict with an economical law.\nWe must therefore escape from the present situation as soon as\npossible. Constructors of automobile or aviation engines must seek\nto adapt their engines to the use of heavy fuels, with a high boiling point. Scientists and engineers must seek sources of energy\nto put at the disposal of chemists. Chemists must study the reactions necessary for producing the required substances. Lastly, the\nGovernment and every one interested in the development of the manufacture and use of internal combustion engines in France must\nfurnish material and financial aid.\nTranslated by\nNational Advisory Committee\nfor Aeronautics.\n\nTest No. 404\n"Extra" gasolin8\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 C:0.722\n20/20 0.75\n\nE\n\nC)\n\nC\')\n\na)\n\n\'-4\n0\n\n0\t\n\n25\t\n\n50\t\n\n100\t\nTemperature, oc\n75\t\n\n125\t\n\n150\n\nTest No.. 406\n"Toui\'ist". gasoline\r\nSpecific gravity at 150C:00716\n20/20 0765\n\n1%\n\nrE3\n\nC)\n\nCo\n\na)\nr4\n\n0\n\n0\t\n\n25\t\n\n50\t\n\n100\t\n125\t\n75\t\nTemperature, \xc2\xb0C\n\n.150\t\n\n175\r\n\nTest\'No4 1106\nHeavy gasoline\ncty it .5ThUA5Q-..\nSpecific\t\n20/20 0.792\n% ,romatic hydrocarboiis\n\n0\n\n-r4\n\n\'a)\n\n0\n\no\t\n\n25\t\n\n50\t\n\n100\t\n75\t\nTemperature, oc\n\n125\t\n\n150\t\n\n16\n\n'
