Alternate small- and large-diameter spacer\n\nrings are slipped on the mandrel and held in place\nwith an end cap, which is then centered against the\ntailstock of the lathe. The difference in the outside\nradii of adjacent spacers is the desired depth of a\ncorrugation to be formed, and the width of a spacer\ndetermines the width of a corrugation.\nAfter the mandrel assembly is mounted on the lathe,\nthe sheet-metal tubing is slipped over the assembly\nand the lathe started. The bellows corrugations are\nthen formed one at a time by pressing the freely\nrotating forming wheel (mounted on the lathe compound) against the side of the tubing midway between\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The completed bellows\nis readily slipped off the mandrel assembly, since\nthe smallest inside diameter of the bellows is greater\nthan the outside diameter of the largest spacer.\nNotes:\nI. Spacers and mandrels of various sizes can be used\nto custom-fabricate bellows of any desired dimensions.\n\nBrief 65-10150\t\n\nInquiries concerning this innovation may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nLewis Research Center\n21000 Brookpark Road\nCleveland, Ohio, 44135\nReference: B65-101 50\nPatent status: NASA encourages commercial use\nof this innovation.
