This started with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), then the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and recently the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG). This 20+-year (and on-going) activity has yielded an important set of insights and lessons learned for making state-of-the-art precipitation data accessible to the diverse communities of users. Merged-data products critically depend on the input sensors and the retrieval algorithms providing accurate, reliable estimates, but it is also important to provide ancillary information that helps users determine suitability for their application. We typically provide fields of estimated random error, and recently reintroduced the quality index concept at user request. Also at user request we have added a (diagnostic) field of estimated precipitation phase. Over time, increasingly more ancillary fields have been introduced for intermediate products that give expert users insight into the detailed performance of the combination algorithm, such as individual merged microwave and microwave-calibrated infrared estimates, the contributing microwave sensor types, and the relative influence of the infrared estimate.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180000821, "endDate": "2018-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Meteorological Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "115d041665e64108aeff432433b549c0", "id": "4bb007bb61674b23bda6bc44afda198e"}], "name": "American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting", "location": "Austin, TX", "id": "115d041665e64108aeff432433b549c0", "startDate": "2018-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180000821, "id": "d8ed614dfc1444448aac588edfe7a702", "publicationDate": "2018-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180000821.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180000821/downloads/20180000821.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180000821/downloads/20180000821.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180000821/downloads/20180000821.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
