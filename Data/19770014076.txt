Howard\nAmes Research Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSimulation experiments to determine the feasibility of landing V /TOL\naircraft on ships at sea, require that the motion and attitude of the aircraft\nrelative to the landing platform be known at the instant of touchdown. The\nsuccess of these experiments depends on the ability of the experimenter\nto measure the pilot\'s performance during the landing maneuver. To facilitate\nthese measurements, the equations describing the motion of the aircraft and\nits attitude relative to the landing platform are presented in a form which\nis suitable for simulation purposes. It is assumed that the pilot has\nachieved a successful landing when the relative motion at each landing wheel,\nat the instant of touchdown, does not exceed design values for the landing\ngear. By using this criterion, the equations presented can be used to\ndetermine the success or failure of each landing maneuver and hence establish\nthe feasibility of such maneuvers.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLanding V/TOL aircraft on ships at sea is complicated by the motion\nof the landing platform which moves in response to the motions of the sea.\nIn order to achieve a successful landing, the pilot has to induce in his\naircraft a state which is compatible with the state of the ship, at the\ninstant of touchdown. In the present context, the state refers specifically\nto the components of linear and angular motion and the corresponding spatial\norientation. The relative states must be such that the rate at which the\naircraft approaches the landing platform does not exceed design limits for\nthe landing gear. Moreover, in the event that the aircraft attitude is not\ncompatible with the attitude of the ship, the total landing energy is\ninitially being absorbed by fewer than the total number of shock absorbers\navailable.\nIn order to determine if the relative motions and attitudes during the\nlanding maneuver are within prescribed limits, it is necessary to know the\nmotion of the aircraft relative to the landing platform. The equations\ndescribing the relative motions during touchdown require the formulation\nof a matrix that defines the attitude of the aircraft. A similar matrix\ndefining the attitude of the ship is also required. The elements of these\nmatrices are functions of the conventional Euler angles for the aircraft and\n\nthe ship. The elements of the aircraft attitude matrix are computed in the\nprocess of solving the mathematical model of the aircraft. In order to\ndetermine the elements of the attitude matrix for the ship, the components\nof the ship \' s angular velocity vector are measured and inserted into Euler\'s\ngeometrical equations, which are then solved to obtain the Euler angles for\nthe ship. Subsequent to formulation, the ship\'s attitude matrix is transposed\nand premultiplied by the aircraft attitude matrix to obtain the required\nmatrix defining the transformation from shin axes to aircraft body axes. The\nresult is then used to transfo\'l Lhin motion components of the landing platform from ship axes to aircra:t body axes.\nThe elements of the matrix de^ininf, the transformation from ship axes\nto aircraft body axes are diroct\'.on cosines. Although the direction cosines\nare useful for transformation rurposas, they are not convenient measures of\nattitude. To facilitate the determination of relative attitudes, the\nequations describing a conversion from direction cosines to the Euler angles\nrepresenting the attitude of the aircraft relative to the landing platform\nare formulated.\nThe feasibility of landing a V/TOL aircraft on a moving ship is\ndetermined by using the relative motion and attitude equations to measure\npilot performance during the landing maneuver. The performance measured will\nbe the pilot\'s ability to keep the relative motions and attitudes within\nprescribed limits. A pilot will be deemed to have achieved a successful\nlanding if the relative motions at all landing wheels do not exceed design\nvalues for the landing gear.\n\nVELOCITY OF AIRCRAFT RELATIVE TO THE SHIP\n\nFor simulation experiments of this kind, it is necessary to know the\nvelocity of each landing wheel relative to the landing platform at the\ninstant of touchdown. The point at which a given landing wheel makes\ncontact with the landing platform is assumed to have a position vector Rpi\nrelative to the origin of the ship\'s coordinate system. This system originates\nat a point on the water line, vertically above the center of gravity of the\nship. The XZ plane of the ship\'s coordinate system corresponds to the plane\nof symmetry of the vessel and the Y axis is normal to it. It is naval\npractice to have tha Y axis emanating from the port side of the ship and the\nZ axis pointing upward. However, in order to simplify the determination of\nrelative velocities, ship motion will be referred to a coordinate system that\noriginates on the water line but otherwise conforms to the aircraft axes\nconvention.\nassumes\nRelative to this system of coordinates the position vector\nRPi\nthe form\t\nR\n(1)\n7.piK\t\npi 6\t\nPi - (Xpil + Y\n\n2\n\n:i\n\n\t\nI\n\n.\t ,\nwhere Y,\ntions of\nat which\nsubscript\n\nJ, R are a triad of mutually orthogonal unit vectors in the directhe ship\'s axes, and X p , YP , 1 p are the coordinates of the point\nthe ith landing wheel me^Cea cc ac with the landing platform. The\n\' 1 0 is used to indicate which landing wheel is being considered.\n\nDue to the ship\'s motion, the velocity of the landing platform at the\npoint at which the ith landing wheel makes contact, is given by the equation\n\n(ref. 1)\n\tda\n\nii - ^VS + U x Rpi)\t\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nVS = (UI + VJ + WK)\t\n\n(3)\n\nS2 = (PI + QJ + RK)\t\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nThe components U, V, W are the surging, swaying, and heaving velocities\nof the ship. These are nautical terms which denote forward, ?ateral, and\nvertical components of the ship\'s motion. P, Q, and R are the rolling,\npitching, and yawing components of the ship\'s angular velocity vector R.\nEquation (2) gives the components of the ship\'s inertial velocity at\nthe point at which the ith landing wheel makes contact with the landing\nplatform. These are\nUI = (U + QZ Pi - RY.Pi)\n\nV I = (V + RX pi - PZ pi )\t\nWI = (W + PY\n\n(5)\n\nPi - QXPi)\n\nwhere the subscript I denotes inertial components.\nIt i g next necessary to determine the velocity of each landing wheel in\nthe fully extended position.

The equations describing\nthe relative motions and attitudes have been derived in a form that is\nsuitable for simulation purposes and the measurement of pilot performance\nduring the landing maneuver. The performance measures can be used to determine a pilot \' s ability to keep the relative motions and attitudes within\nlimits prescribed by the landing gear design. By using this criterion,\nthe equations presented can be used to determine the success or failure of\neach landing and hence establish the feasibility of such landings.\n\n\'I\n\n18\n\nj^\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nRamsey, A.\t S.., , Dynamics, Part II.\t\n\n2.\n\nMcRuer, Duane, et al.:\t Aircraft Dynamics and Automatic Control.\nPrinceton University Press, 1973.\n\n3.\n\nEtkin, Bernard:\t\n1972.\n\n4.\n\nMeyer, George,\t et al.:\t A Method for Expanding a Direct Cosine Matrix\ninto an Euler Sequence of Rotations.\t NASA TM X-1384, 1967.\n\nJ\n\nCambridge University Press,\t 1947,\n\nDynamics of Atmospheric Flight.\t\n\n19\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.,\n\n'
