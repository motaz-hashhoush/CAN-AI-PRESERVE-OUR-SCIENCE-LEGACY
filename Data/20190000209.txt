b'ISS Robotic Student Programming\nWhat are SPHERES, Zero Robotics and Astrobee?\nThe SPHERES facility is a set of three free-\xef\xac\x82ying satellites launched\nin 2006. In addition to scientists and engineers, middle- and highschool students program the SPHERES during the annual Zero\nRobotics programming competition.\n\nNew Game Elements\nAstrobee will allow Zero Robotics to go beyond virtual game elements\nand have students interact with real objects on board the ISS,\nincluding manipulation, viewing and sensing.\n\nReal world sensing\nZero Robotics conducts virtual competitions via simulator and on\nSPHERES aboard the ISS, with students doing the programming. A\nweb interface allows teams to submit code, receive results,\ncollaborate, and compete in simulator- based initial rounds and semi\xef\xac\x81nal rounds. The \xef\xac\x81nal round of each competition is conducted with\nSPHERES aboard the ISS.\nAt the end of 2017 a new robotic platform called Astrobee will\nlaunch, providing new game elements and new ground support for\neven more student interaction.\n\nJonathan Barlow, SGT, Inc.\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\njonathan.s.barlow@nasa.gov\n\nJose Cortez, METIS, Inc.\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\njose.cortez@nasa.gov\n\nDon Soloway\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\ndonald.i.soloway@nasa.gov\n\nKen Oyadomari, SGT, Inc\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\nken.y.oyadomari@nasa.gov\n\nDarryl Levasseur, METIS, Inc.\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\ndarryl.w.levasseur@nasa.gov\n\nThe Astrobee Team\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\n\nReal world manipulation\nAstrobee will also be uniquely capable of manipulating the world\naround it. A pan/tilt arm and gripper will allow Zero Robotics\ncompetitions to include grasping handrails, grappling other Astrobee\nunits, and gripping real-world objects created for each game.\nStudents will learn how to issue commands and how to coordinate\nmotion of the vehicle with motion of the arm and gripper.\n\nJose Benavides\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\njose.v.benavides@nasa.gov\n\nRobert Hanson, METIS, Inc.\nSPHERES Facility\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\nrobert.s.hanson@nasa.gov\n\nAstrobee will be uniquely capable of sensing the world around it.\nStudents will program the robots to identify objects and look for\nphysical games elements using cameras and an RFID sensor.\n\nNew Ground Elements\nHands-on hardware\nBecause Astrobee is based on inexpensive cellphone technology, we\nplan to provide teams with a hardware development kit to allow\nstudents hands-on learning. Students will be able to see the results\nof code with their own eyes and experiment with the hardware.\n\nSee a robot\nAn in-school robotic platform is planned to allow demonstration and\ntesting in a classroom or gym, allowing students to demonstrate their\ncode and robot behavior. These demonstrations will help to foster\ninterest in other students who are not directly involved in the\ncompetition, and may lead to smaller school-level competitions.\n\nGround testing\nAstrobee will offer the ability to run competitions in a terrestrial lab,\ngiving students the ability to test on the ground before testing in\nspace, and see how results can differ. The ground lab is being\nout\xef\xac\x81tted with visual representations of ISS lab walls, and lights and\nhandrails for the vehicle to use for navigation and as part of the\ncompetitions.\n\n'
