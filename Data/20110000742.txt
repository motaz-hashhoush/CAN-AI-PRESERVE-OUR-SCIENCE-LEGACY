The rocky, rust-colored expanses of\nMars. Among NASA\xe2\x80\x99s successes in space exploration\nhave been the indelible images the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s efforts have\nreturned to Earth. From the Hubble Space Telescope to\nthe Hasselblad cameras in the hands of Apollo astronauts,\nmany of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions involve technologies that\ndeliver unprecedented views of our universe, providing\nfuel for scientific inquiry and the imagination.\nLess known than Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s galactic vistas or the Mars\nrovers\xe2\x80\x99 panoramic landscapes is the impact NASA has had\non the era of digital photography on Earth. While the first\ndigital camera was built by Eastman Kodak in 1975, the\nfirst to actually develop the concept of the digital camera\nwas Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) engineer Eugene\nLally, who in the 1960s described the use of mosaic photosensors to digitize light signals and produce still images.\nDuring the following decades, NASA continued the work\nof developing small, light, and robust image sensors practical for use in the extreme environment of space.\nIn the 1990s, a JPL team led by Eric Fossum researched\nways of improving complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors in order to significantly\nminiaturize cameras on interplanetary spacecraft yet\nmaintain scientific image quality. An image sensor contains an array of photodetectors called pixels that collect\nsingle particles of light, or photons. (The word \xe2\x80\x9cpixel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\nshort for picture element\xe2\x80\x94was first published in 1965 by\nJPL engineer Frederic Billingsley.) The photons entering\nthe pixel are converted to electrons, forming an electrical\nsignal a processor then assembles into a picture. CMOS\nsensors represented a number of appealing qualities for\nNASA compared to the charge coupled device (CCD),\nthe prevalent image sensor at the time. Crafted by the\nsame process used to build microprocessors and other\nsemiconductor devices, the CMOS image sensors can be\n90\t\n\nConsumer Goods\t\n\nImages like these of (clockwise from top left) the Eagle Nebula, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, the Martian landscape,\nand an astronaut self-portrait taken during a spacewalk bring the wonders of space exploration down to Earth.\n\nmanufactured more easily than CCDs and at lower cost.\nThe CMOS sensor components are integrated onto a\nsingle chip, unlike CCDs, which have off-chip components. This integrated setup consumes as much as 100\ntimes less power than CCDs, allows for smaller camera\nsystems, and can be designed with radiation-hard pixel\narchitectures for space applications.\nAt JPL, Fossum invented the CMOS active-pixel\nsensor (CMOS-APS), which integrates active amplifiers\ninside each pixel that boost the electrical output generated by the collected photons. The CMOS-APS featured\nimproved image quality over passive-pixel sensors\n(without amplifiers) and included a number of on-chip\nfunctions, providing for complete miniature imaging sys-\n\ntems that operate quickly with low power demands. JPL\nvalidated the technology through a series of prototypes.\n\nPartnership\nFossum realized the CMOS-APS technology would be\nuseful not only for imaging in space but on Earth as well.\nIn 1995, he, his colleague and then-wife Sabrina Kemeny,\nand three other JPL engineers founded Photobit, based\nin Pasadena, California. Photobit exclusively licensed the\nCMOS-APS technology from JPL, becoming the first\ncompany to commercialize CMOS image sensors.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw an expanding number of applications for\nthese miniaturized cameras,\xe2\x80\x9d says Roger Panicacci, one\nof Photobit\xe2\x80\x99s founders. The company quickly positioned\nSpinoff 2010\n\nitself on the cutting edge of the field of CMOS imaging, and by June 2000, it had shipped 1 million sensors\nfor use in popular Web cameras, machine vision solutions, dental radiography, pill cameras, motion-capture,\nand automotive applications. The company was featured in Spinoff 1999 and founders Fossum, Panicacci,\nKemeny, and Robert Nixon were inducted into the\nSpace Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s Space Technology Hall of Fame that\nsame year.\nIn 2001, the company was acquired by semiconductor\nmemory producer Micron Technology, of Boise, Idaho,\nand became a division of Micron Imaging Group. With\nthe exploding popularity of the camera phone in the\nmid-2000s, the CMOS-APS proved ideal for crafting\ncameras that fit into slim cell phones and produce good\nphotos without draining batteries. Riding the wave\nof camera phone demand, in 2006 the group became\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s leading supplier of CMOS image sensors.\nIn 2008, Micron Imaging Group was spunoff from\nMicron to form Aptina Imaging Corporation, based\nin San Jose, California. That same year, it shipped its\n1 billionth sensor.\n\nProduct Outcome\nAptina has continued to improve on the original,\nNASA-developed CMOS-APS. The company has\ninvented increasingly small pixel architectures, as well as\na process for optimizing the amount of light that hits a\npixel, boosting sensitivity and image quality while allowing the company\xe2\x80\x99s customers to design more compact\ncamera systems.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur technology is taking advantage of semiconductor\ninnovation,\xe2\x80\x9d says Panicacci, now Aptina\xe2\x80\x99s vice president\nof product development. \xe2\x80\x9cAs transistors shrink, we can\nbuild smaller pixels, meaning that, in a given area of\nsilicon, we can provide higher and higher resolution for\nproducts like camera phones.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAptina\xe2\x80\x99s line of sensors allows for advanced camera\nfeatures like electronic pan, tilt, and zoom, as well as\nSpinoff 2010\t\n\nAptina Imaging Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s 10-megapixel complementary\nmetal-oxide semiconductor sensor is the first such device for\npoint-and-shoot cameras.\n\napplications requiring motion detection, target tracking,\nand image compression. The sensors are also incorporated into the company\xe2\x80\x99s line of system-on-a-chip (SOC)\ndevices\xe2\x80\x94synergistic packages that enhance imaging, are\neasier and cheaper to integrate into products, and provide\nbenefits like anti-shake compensation that corrects blurring from subject motion or an unsteady camera.\nAptina has grown from its NASA roots into a leader of\nthe CMOS image sensor industry. Its sensors are currently\nintegrated into one of every three cell phone cameras and\nare part of every major brand personal computer camera\nworldwide, as well as many embedded cameras for notebook computers. The company is also advancing CMOS\nsensors for digital still and video cameras\xe2\x80\x94products\nthat have traditionally featured CCD sensors, and has\nproduced the first 10-megapixel CMOS image sensor\nfor point-and-shoot cameras, a device that incorporates\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s High Speed Serial Pixel Interface (HiSPi)\ncapabilities, enabling a camera to create high-definition\n(HD) imagery.\n\nThe NASA-derived CMOS-APS can also be found\nin other, less obvious applications. Aptina produces tiny\nsensors for use in endoscopes for minimally invasive\nmedical diagnostic procedures. The sensors do not generate potentially painful heat during examinations and are\ncheap enough to allow for disposable scope tubes, eliminating potential complications from improperly sterilized\nscopes. The company also worked with a medical imaging\npartner to develop the PillCam, an ingestible camera for\nimaging a patient\xe2\x80\x99s gastrointestinal tract.\nThe automotive and surveillance industries represent\nother major markets for Aptina\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. Major international auto brands like Daihatsu and Volvo employ\nAptina designs for applications like backup cameras that\nhelp with parking and ensure safe reverse motion. Aptina\nestimates its customers will be building up to 25 million\nbackup camera systems annually by 2011, potentially\nreducing backover accidents by about 20,000 per year.\nThe company also has partnerships within the field of\nnetwork surveillance, designing imaging technology that\ncan spot cheating in casinos or intruders in unauthorized\nareas.\nLast year, Aptina became a stand-alone company, and\nwhile Photobit once saw 1 million sensors shipped as a\nmajor milestone, says Panicacci, Aptina often ships over\n1 million sensors a day. As demand rises for high-end capabilities like HD imaging and the market for camera products\nbooms, Aptina\xe2\x80\x99s NASA-developed technology should play\nan even greater role in products benefiting the public every\nday. Research by the International Data Corporation, an\nindependent market research company, predicts annual\nsales of more than 1 billion camera phones beginning in\n2010, all featuring one or more CMOS-APS cameras. \xe2\x9d\x96\nHiSPi\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Aptina Imaging Corporation.\nPillCam\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Given Imaging Ltd.\n\nConsumer Goods \t 91\n\n'
