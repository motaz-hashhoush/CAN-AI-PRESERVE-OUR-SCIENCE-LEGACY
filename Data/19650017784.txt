Small cracks i n t h e glass seal were\nobserved a t t h e corners of 2 of the packages t h a t leaked.\nLeak-testing was accomplished w i t h a \xe2\x80\x98bGYZC0 Role1 XS-9As mass spctrome t e r . After a vacuum had been Idram on the packages, helium was lirecteci\nthrough a hypodermic needle over the exposed surfaces and t h e s i t e s of\nm a x i m u m leak signal were observed. I n a l l cases maximum leaking occurred\na t the corners, e i t h e r through the glass seal or a t the boundary between\nthe g l a s s and the Kovar metal.\nFurther investigation i s required t o determine whether leakage was\ncaused by the grinding operation. Future samples w i l l be tested f o r\nhermeticity both before and immediately a f t e r grinding.\nRing-Welding Covers t o 3/8-Inch Square F l a t Packs\nGold-plated Kovar covers were ring-welded t o the precision f l a t packs\nt h a t leaked t o determine suitable welding machine s e t t i n g s for bonding.\nMachine s e t t i n g s were varied from 1900 t o 2500 watts e l e c t r i c a l input power\nt o t h e transducers, 275 t o 300 pounds clamping force, and 0.35 t o 0.6 second\nwelding time. Bonding occurred between t h e gold platings p r e f e r e n t i a l l y a t\nthe corners of the packages; bonding over the entire land surface did not\noccur.\nSubsequently, welding the precision f l a t packs (both hermetic and\nleaking) was investigated u t i l i z i n g each of these i n t e r l e a f s : a 0.0005inch thick gold i n t e r l e a f , a 0.00015-inch thick gold i n t e r l e a f , and a\n0.0003-inch thick 1100-Hl4 aluminum alloy i n t e r l e a f . The best bonding\nwas achieved w i t h the 0.0005-inch gold i n t e r l e a f . Bonding was s t i l l\nsomewhat better a t the corners.\n\nMeasurements of thickness variations, both on the lapped and ground\nf l a t packs and on the covers, showed a just-detectable variation ( l e s s than\n+ 0.0001 inch).\nIt seemed probable, therefore, t h a t p r e f e r e n t i a l bonding\nwas not caused by thickness variations, but r a t h e r by t h e geometry of the\nf l a t packs. Ultrasonic power delivered t o the corners of a square i s\ng r e a t e r than t h a t delivered t o the midpoints of the sides (see Appen;lix A\nt o Monthly ?rcri;\xe2\x80\x98ressReport No. h , dated March 1 2 , 1965).

Attanpts t o peel t h e covers from the packs\nresulted i n f r a c t u r e through t h e glass substrate.\n\nThe three remaining leak-tight f l a t packs were welded a t machine\ns e t t i n g s of 2000 watts, 275 pounds, and 1.5 seconds with a 0.0005-inch\ngold i n t e r l e a f . Clearly the 1.5-seconds weld i n t e r v a l i s excessive.\nHowever, one of the three specimens proved t o be hermetically sealed\nwithin the limits of the VliZCO Model M - A mass spectrometer ( 2 . 5 x 10-5 cc\nS9 B\nh e l i u m per second). One leaked s l i g h t l y and one leaked considerably.\nMetallographic Examination of F l a t Pack Closures\n\nA sample fran the g r m p of flat packs welded without an i n t e r l e a f\nto determine welding machine s e t t i n g s was selected f o r examination of t h e\nmicrostructure of the cover bond. The sample was bonded reasonably well\non only one corner. This area was sectioned for metallograMic evaluation.\n\nIn t h e bonded area, complete bonding was found between t h e go13-plateL?\nsurfaces of the window frame and cover: N voids were obsel-se1.\no\nThe photomicrographs i n Figure 1 show a section of the bond. The\nl o c a l e of the bond is the shadowy l i n e close t o the frame. I n the t o p\nphotomicrograph i t can be observed from the area adjacent t o t h e b o a i\nzone t h a t the gold plating on the cover i s much thicker t h a n on t h e replated picture frame. Measurement of the observed d i f f e r e n c e in yle+iLrL:\nthicknesses i n this section showed t h a t t h e plating on the cover i s\n0.0005-inch thick md the plating on t h e r"rame i s 0.0001-inch thick. The\naverage plating thicknesses on both p a r t s was reported t o be approxiiiately\n200 microinches (0.0002 inch) i n a private communication from Zell. The\ndifference measured i n t h i s section i s p r e m e d t o be consistent over the\ne n t i r e surfaces of the cover and picture frame, i n t h i s sample and i n o t h e r\n;t\nsamples. The t h i n layer on the picture frame, being restrained 5 - h e\nmore r i g i d Kovar substrate, cannot yield an3 p l a s t i c a l l y deform t o the sane\nextent as the thicker coating on the cover, which can display more bulk\nbehavior.\nClosures made with a 0.0005-inch gold f o i l i n t e r l e a f betveen the\npicture frame and cover uere not cm-pleted i n time f o r metal;ograpnic\nexamination during t h i s r e p o r t period.
