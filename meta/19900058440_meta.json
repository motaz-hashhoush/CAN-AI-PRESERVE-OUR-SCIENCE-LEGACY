NASA and the U.S. aircraft industry have aggressively studied induced-drag reduction methods. The state-of-the-art CTOL commercial aircraft wing is as a result of these efforts virtually optimal, with a total induced drag lying within a percent of the theoretical minimum. Many of the devices currently under study for induced drag reduction are added to wingtips, yielding benefits through their effects on the wake vortex as well as through forces generated in the flowfield.", "title": "Induced drag - Historical perspective", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T11:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900058440, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Henderson, William P."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "71f30a9574074132b6a546bcbff0ac7e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900058440, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Holmes, Bruce J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "36a9067bdd5941b9a2e0e377efa8d7ba"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900058440, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900058440, "id": "37e6e7003e5348ca90cb4173d3b712fe", "publicationDate": "1989-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
