b'BV\n\nINTA is currently developing a two-degree-of-freedom antenna pointing mechanis\n) as part of the ESA ENVISAT POLAR PLATFORM (PPF) program. This\nmechanism will drive a Ka-band antenna within the Data-Relay Satellite System\n(DRS) on board the Polar Platform satellite. The first mission using PPF is ENVISAT,\nwhich is expected to be flown in 1998.\nThis paper describes the main requirements, design, and test results of this pointing\nsystem, as well as the main technical problems from customer requirements and how\nthose have been faced to achieve a final design.\n\nThe performance of the PPF Ka-band antenna requires a fine pointing device to allow\nlinking with the DRS Ka band and ground.\nThe APM for PPF (APM-PPF) (Figures 1 and 2) is a two-motorgear azimuth (AZ) and\nelevation (EL) gimbal system, which drives the 1-m antenna with a large pointing\nrange. The mechanism is joined to a deployable boom, and the antenna is supported\nby a four-bar linkage to the platform during launch (Figure 3).\nThe (a) absence of an off-loading device, (b) the presence of external wave guides\nand rotary joints, (c) the large size of the antenna and its large motion range, and (d)\nthe large antenna-boom distance produced high loads on the mechanism and drove\nsome aspects of the mechanism to be designed according to strengthktress criteria for\na proper structure.\nA first EQM (Engineering-Qualification odel) has been already delivered to the\ncustomer after qualification tests. The unit passed all tests successfully.\n\nain design requirements are given belo . For each field, they are listed by the\ndegree of difficulty found by designers in meeting them (1 means top difficulty).\nlisted are any complications produced in meeting another requirement.\n\n* INTA, Spanish National Center for Aerospace Research, Madrid, Spain\n\n161\n\ngperatinwnd performance\n1.

Sinusoidal vibration levels: 15-g amplitude on 10- to 100-Hz frequency range\n7. Stiffness for launching configuration: 100 Hz\n\nMechanism Design\nThe mechanism consists of two motorgears (AZ and EL) joined by means of an Lshaped structure. The AZ actuator is joined to a deployable boom by means of a 1-m\n( 3 4 ) bracket, while the EL unit is joined to the antenna.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the complete unit with no Multilayer insulation (MLI).\nThe motorgear concept is shown in Figure 4.\n\n162\n\nThe design consists of the following bearings: one preloaded output ball bearing pair\nthat supports the encoder, the output shaft, and loads; one preloaded pair; and a deep\ngroove, single bearing that supports the stepper motor and the gear input shaft.\nAll ball bearings are commercial 440C stainless steel for space applications and have\nvacuum oil-preimpregnated phenolic cages.\n\nEncoder\nOne 16-bit absolute encoder, manufactured by CODECHAMP (France), is located on\nthe output shaft. The encoder was customized to the housing. .\n\nGea\n\nOne harmonic drive gear (type HDUC-20-BLR ratio loo), made of stainless steel, is\nmanufactured by Harmonic h i v e System (Germany). These gears.were used\nbecause of their optimal reductionlmass ratio and previous in-house experience with\nthese harmonic gears.\nDuring the development phase, accelerated life tests were performed to assess gear\nperformance with lubricants, as well as application procedures and controls. These\ntests included the application of gold coatings on contacting surfaces, but this process\nwas decided to be excluded.\nDue to the long-life requirements, the harmonic drive was customized to produce oil\n\nreservoirs (phenolic cages).\nA harmonic drive (size 20) was selected to meet the torsional stiffness requirement of\n7-Hz at the deployed configuration, since the 13-kg antenna COG has a considerable\noffset (350 mm) with respect to the AZ and EL motorgear axes.\n\ni Q\nMm\n\nThe motor is a 23PP stepper motor from SAGEM (France). It provides a holding torque\nof 0.27 N-m. The stator and rotor are bonded to the outer case and shaft.\nMotoraear Casinq\nThe motorgear casing is made of TiGAI4V, which provides a compromise between\nmass and thermal compatibility with standard elements made of stainless steel. The\nexternal case contains provisions for thermal hardware. The attachments and stop\ndevices (mechanical and electrical) are different for AZ and EL (different motion\nrange), so the unit was designed to contain all necessary provisions to be used as\neither an AZ or an EL drive.\nTo reduce loads on bearings due to different temperatures on motor shaft and outer\ncase during thermal analysis, a thin membrane was used on the motorgear bottom.\n\n163\n\nas one of the key requirements ecause of the Ion\nles). The first baseline considere\nA preliminary life st showed the inadequacy of sputtered\ne test unit failed after about 7000 cycles\nlife applications.\nThe backup solut , based on oil, was then considered. Th\nESA-qualified Fomblin 225 from ontedison (Italy).\n\nThe gear oil lubrication was performed during motorgear assembly by local oil\napplication on the contacting surfaces of the harmonic drive gears. Due to the\ncriticality of this operation, oil resewoirs were foreseen for teeth mesh oil feeding.\nThe lubrication process included antispread application to avoid oil migration.\nThermal Hardware\nThe design considers heaters, thermal switches, and thermistors for thermal control.\nHeaters and thermistors are located on the motorgears external case, on the\nencoders, and the stepper motors.\nRedundancv\nMotors windings, encoder electronics, thermal hardware, electrical switches, and the\nharness are redundant.\nStructures\nThe motorgears are joined by an L-shaped structure of 3-mm thickness. A support\nfitting (2-mm thickness) joins the AZ unit to the deployable boom. A bracket was\ndesigned to support one antenna rotary joint to the wave guides. All main structures\nare made of Ti6A14V. Secondary structures are made of aluminum alloy 7075.\nAs previously explained, the structure design was faced with three main problems from\nthe complex physical interfaces and reduced space available: (a) the large antennaboom distance, (b) the large antenna COG offset wrt the AZ and EL axes, and (c) the\npresence of wave guides, rotary joints, and antenna envelope for the motion range.\nThese design constraints produced quite a large main structure (L-shaped) to be as\nlight as possible, but stiff enough to comply with the stiffness requirements. On the\nother hand, the effect of transverse temperature gradients across the sections during\noperation led the design to include an MLI and to consider a 3-mm thickness to\nminimize the pointing perturbances. In spite of this, this remained as the main\ncontribution to the APM pointing errors.\n\n164\n\ne high number of c\n(b) the large motion range of th\n\ne antenna and EL motorgear and\nnding device was implemented to:\n\n- minimize the resistant torque of twisting 52 cables with thermal protection.\n- control the cable motion during launch and operation to avoid possible\ndamage to MLI or other equipment.\n\n- control temperature of the cables.\n\nThe cable drum is made of aluminum alloy (1.5-mm thickness) to reduce mass and\ncontains two slots for main and redundant bundles to be wound in opposite directions.\nThis made cable resistant torque compensation possible. To allow a controlled\nwinding, a flat cable was considered. The resistant torque was reduced to an almost\nconstant torque of 0.150 N-m along the complete rotation range. The mass increase\nfrom the drum and cables was 1.2 kg.\nFigure 5 shows the cable output from the cable drum.\nThermal Protectioq\nThe complete unit is coated with thermal protective coatings and an MLI on an Lshaped fitting to reduce extreme temperatures for hot and cold cases.\nStructural Analvsis\nAs mentioned before, due to the mechanism/structure duality of this equipment, a\ndetailed strength analysis task was carried out. Along with a large amount of hand\ncalculations, the final structural analysis of the mechanism was carried out by the\nFinite Element Model (FEM) technique. Figure 6 shows the APM FEM. The software\nused was MSC/NASTRAN, and the main analysis can be summarized:\n\n- modal analysis\n- vibration levels analysis (random, sinusoidal and pyroshocks), including a\ncomplete study of loads on the L-shaped fitting, support fitting, and motorgear\ncases, including bolts. Also, torques on harmonic drives and acceleTation\nlevels seen by electronic components were subjected to analysis\n- deployment phase study to determine effects of antenna inertias on EL axis\n- thermoelastic analysis to obtain pointing errors.\n\n165\n\nTest performed on EQ\n\nunit {qualification levels) are grouped belo\n\nFunctional\nMotorgears were successfully tested, including the following:\n\n- Pointing and backlash: mean values obtained were about 0.005" per\nmot0rgear\n- Overall performance: speed, acceleration, motion ranges, and limit devices\nactivation\nFunctional tests performed before and after the tests discussed below showed\nidentical performance.\nEnvironmental\nEQM was satisfactorily subjected to the following tests:\n\n- Sinusoidal vibration levels: 15-g amplitude on 10- to 100-Hz frequency range\n- Random vibration levels with a maximum PSD = 0.125 g2/Hz on 20- to 2000Hz range and global RMS level of 11.4 g\n- Shock: 60 g in 0.5 ms\nFigure 7 shows the mechanism and fixtures for environmental testing.\nFigure 8 compares predicted (FEM) and measured natural frequencies of the APM.\nThe average difference is about 4%.\nLife Test\nOne unit, including all the mechanical hardware (encoder and motors were excluded),\nwas submitted to fhe following accelerated life test to check the performance of liquidlubrication on bearings and gears:\n\n- accelerated life test, consisting of externally backdriving the unit with the\nfollowing motion parameters: 1Ox maximum speed (12Oo/s), 1OOx maximum\nacceleration (88.5"/~2), 5 ~\n1 . 2 pointing cycle (330",\n88,000 cycles). The gear\nwas inspected after the test and showed no signs of wear. The starting torque\nand torsional stiffness were also checked before and after testing and showed\nidentical performance. Figure 9 shows the test setup.\n\n166\n\nues to check the following:\n\n- motorgear axes variation along complete rotation range.\n\naximum orientation\nerrors detected were about 0.008\xc2\xb0for the worst axis.\n- orthogonality between AZ and EL motorgears (0.030" constant along motion).\nThis error can be accommodated by software during in-orbit performance.\n- angles between AZ and EL axes wrt a fixed mirror cube on support fitting to\nestablish the APM real pointing vector after mounting.\n\nThe test setup is shown in Figure 10.\n\nLessons learned\n(a) As already mentioned, the imposition of severe geometrical constraints made the\ndesign extremely complicated because of the interference with other requirements,\nsuch as stiffness, adequate harness routing, mass, etc.:\n(1) From the analysis, two local modes, at about 20 Hz, were predicted during\nlaunch due to the harmonic drive torsional stiffness, combined with the rotor\ninertia; the L shape (due to the presence of wave guides) of the interface fitting\nbetween both motorgears excited the AZ gear, thus producing theoretically high\ntorques (above the gear capacity) on gear mesh due to the inertia of the gear\ninput shaft (that tried to rotate at high speeds due to the reduction ratio).\nAlthough this phenomenon was detected during a development vibration test,\nand not during the formal sinusoidal test due to the existing damping, it was still\nan important concern.\n(2) The presence of this L-shaped, thin structure (3 mm) produced the highest\npointing distortions due to the temperature gradients along the cross-sections,\neven with an MLI as thermal protection (estimated by analysis).\n\nThe use of external wave guides and other geometrical constraints must be evaluated\ncarefully from the beginning of the project because of the important design impacts.\n(b) Interchangeability of both motorgears reduced cost and effort, but it required\nexternal location of all limit devices (electrical and mechanical) for easy mounting,\nsince motion ranges were different for AZ and EL motorgears. However, an additional\nmass was necessary to locate all external provisions.\n(c) The cable drum solution showed good behavior, which minimized the resistant\ntorque of the cables. Different options were considered, and some of them tested.\nInconveniences are a slightly more expensive solution and the additional mass.\n(d) The liquid lubricant concept worked well. Even though a complete thermal vacuum\n(TV) test is pending for qualification, results until now are sufficient to eliminate\nlubricant concerns.\n\n167\n\nion on gears (sputtered os2) was sho n to be inadequate for this\nreover, some key parameters, such as the layer thickness, are difficult\nto control.\n\n(f) The absence of an off-loading device has produced high loads on bearings, thus\nleading to an increase in the size of the preloaded bearings and subsequently of\nmotorgears, thus affecting the mass and operational performance (higher friction and\nnoise). Although implementing an off-loading device would not have been an easy\ntask, this option should have been considered in the first program stages.\n\n(9)\nThe presence of an external wave guide (delivered by the customer), made of\naluminum alloy and joined to the main APM structure, has doubled the pointing error\ndue to thermal distortions (estimated by analysis).\n\nConclusions\nThe results of the APM-PPF for the EQM show that the equipment satisfies the\ncontractual technical requirements. However, formal qualification tests, as well as a\nTV test and TV life test, are still pending and will include the same tests that have\nalready been completed for EQM.\n\n168\n\n169\n\n0\n\nc\n\nu\n\na\na\n\ni\na\na\n\n170\n\n171\n\n172\n\nl\ni\n\nn\n\n0;\n\nz\na\n\na\n..\nco\nut\n\n173\n\nFIGURE 7: APM-PPF (EQM).
