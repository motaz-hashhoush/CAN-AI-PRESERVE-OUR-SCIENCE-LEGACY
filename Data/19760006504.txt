To be able to judge which concept is most\n.prornising for a given application and thus deserving of further research and de\xc2\xad\nvelopment would appear to be a formidable task at present because a general\ntheoretical framework is generally lacking.\n\nThus, each concept needs to be in\xc2\xad\n\ndividually evaluated for any given application.\n\nGiven the number of concepts\n\ncurrently appearing, one apparently could be busily occupied indefinitely and\nstill not be sure one has chosen the best currently available concept for a given\napplication.\n\nThe preceding situation generally applies to the applications here of\ninterest - HC/TC at low and high temperatures with particular emphasis on\nlong term storage of cryogens in space and low temperature thermal control in\ngenera. Current technology in\n\nlong-term cryogen storage relies primarily on\n\ndewar-type containers in conjunction with superinsulation (Ref. 1).\n\nThe question\n\nof how to evaluate a multitude of old and new concepts for possible advantages\nover or in addition to insulated de.wars is\n\nbeing handled in this study, given the\n\ncurrent lack of a theoretical framework, by a three-fold approach. A number of\nconcepts chosen on the rather subjective basis of experience and judgement are\nanalyzed to elucidate the physical mechanisms and to identify thereby perform\xc2\xad\nance criterion.\n\nA search is then conducted of the literature for suitable\n\nI\'\nLOCKHEED- HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nsearch is then conducted of the literature for suitable candidates. Finally,\nsome consideration is given to a general theoretical framework for HS/TC.\nThese activities, of course, are very closely interrelated and are being con\xc2\xad\nducted simultaneously. Results to date of the indicated activities are pre\xc2\xad\nsented in the following sections. It might be well to emphasize that the work\nhere reported is incomplete.\n\nThus, the conclusions are tentative.\n\n2\nLOCKHEED- HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nSection 2\nPRINCIPLES OF POSSIBLE HS/TC MODES AND\nTHEIR OPERATION\nA distinction is made between storage that essentially is reversible,\n\ni.e., heat is taken out as readily as it is put in (A type storage) and storage\n\nthat involves some degree of irreversibility (B type storage). The following\n\nclassifications accordingly are designated as A or B type\n\nGenerally heat storage in the solid or liquid phases is practically\npreferable to storage in the gaseous phases for the obvious reasons of less\npacking volumes and avoidance of pressure problems. In some situations,\nhowever, gases can be easily removed from the system for storage and\nreadily added when needed. Water vapor is an excellent example. The\nfollowing discussions, therefore, have.not excluded systems involving gases.\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nA TYPE STORAGE\nSensible Heat\n\nSensible heat (or specific heat storage) is well known. In this storage\nmode input heat is stored as internal, molecular motions. It is fairly well\nknown that the range of heat storage capacities or specific heats runs from\nabout 0.4185 to 4.185 joules/gm- C.. Water is remarkable in having one of the\nhighest known heat capacities,\n\n- 4.185 joules/gm-\xc2\xb0C.\n\nAn important consideration in sensible heat storage is the rate at which\nthe system can store input heat as sensible heat. If the rate of heat input is\nfaster than can be accommodated as sensible heat another heat storage me\xc2\xad\nchanism, most often undesirable, comes into play. For example, consider\nthe following schematic.\n\n3\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nJJMSC-IIREC TR [)496600\n\n\nWater\nq\n-T\n0\n\nFig. I - Schematic of Transient Temperature Profile in Heat Storage\nby Sensible Heat\nObviously, if heat is input too fast, it cannot be transported fast enough within\nthe system to hold local temperatures within acceptable limits. In such a case\nanother, undesirable heat storage mechanism comes into play- boiling. It is\neven conceivable that boiling could occur at one end of the system while the\nother end was still at the initial temperature if the input heat rate were suf\xc2\xad\nficiently high. The equation that describes the build up of temperature in a\nregion is given by\ndT\n\nt\ndTwhere the term\n\nk\nCpP\n\nk\n-\n\n82T\n\np\nc p axx2\n\nis the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nIt is obvious,\n\ntherefore, that a desirable characteristic for a sensible heat storage system\nwould be a high thermal diffusivity. It can be seen, however, that high specific\nheats tend to make for low thermal diffusivity values. Thus for any given ap\xc2\xad\nplication care must be taken that the input heat flux does, not exceed the ability\nof the system to respond appropriately.\nAn answer to the question of whether a material exists that has a substan\xc2\xad\ntially higher specific heat than about 4.185 joules/gm- C requires some delving\ninto theory. It should be mentioned in this connection that second order phase\ntransitions discussed in a following subsection may also be viewed as a sensible\nheat phenomenon. The present study has not gone into this aspect of specific\nheats thus far because of the feeling that the time probably would be better\n\n4\nLOCKHEED\n\n-HUNTSVILLE\n\nRESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\nspent on some of the other concepts.\n\nAlso not pursued thus far is the question\n\nof whether magnetic or electric fields could substantially increase specific\nheat. One applicable reference found in this area (Ref. 2) indicates that mag\xc2\xad\nnetizing a material has little effect on specific heats for ordinary conditions.\n2.1.2 *Reversible Chemical/Physical Reactions\nIt is well known that a chemical reaction has associated with it a heat, i.e.,\n+q\n\n\nA\n\n--\n\nB + C\n\n-q\nDissociation of A absorbs q joules of heat, and recombination of the B and C\nliberates q joules of heat. For the moment we assume that the reaction in\xc2\xad\nvolves only one phase (solid, liquid, or gas).\n\nThe double arrows mean that the\n\nreaction occurs as readily in one direction as in the other, i.e., if a small\'\namount of heat is added to the system the reaction goes one way, if a small\namount of heat is subtracted, the reaction goes the other way. Such reactions\nhave the effect of increasing the heat capacity of a system. In order for a\nchemical reaction to be effective as a storer of reversible heat, however, the\nrates of the forward and backward reactions must be sufficiently rapid to ac\xc2\xad\ncommodate the input heat rate. Again, if the reaction rates are too slow, input\nheat will find another more accommodating, but probably undesirable, storage\nmode.\n\nObviously, chemical reactions occurring within a solid phase will be\ngenerally slower than those occurring in the liquid or gas phases. In the solid\nphase mass transport is limited to diffusion which in the solid is quite a bit\n0-10 cm/eDi\n10 - 5\n\n10 cm /sec, D\nslower than in the liquid or gas phases (Dsoli d\ncm /sec, Dg\ngas\n\n-\n\n10\n\ncm z/sec).\n\nMost of what has been said about chemical reactions applies also to re\xc2\xad\nversible chemical/physical reactions such as the following:\n\n5\n\nLOCKHEED\n\n-HUNTSVILLE\n\nRESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREG TR D496600\n\n-q\nSolid I + Reactant (Liquid, gas, or solution) \t .\n+q\n\nSolid 1: Reactant\nor Solid 2 + Product\n\nor\n\n-q\n\nSolid + Solvent\n\nSolution\n\n\n+q\n\nA distinction must be made, however, between chemical reactions involving\nonly one degree of freedom and those involving two or more degrees of freedom.\nFor example, in a reaction such as\nN 2 0 4 (g) :\n\n2NO\n\n(g)\n\nthe equilibrium is a function of two variables. The number of variables upon\nwhich an equilibrium reaction depends is given by the well known Gibbs phase\nrule, i.e.,\n(Degrees of freedom)=(nurnber of independent -(number\ncomponents)\nFor the preceding reaction\n\nof phases) + 2\n\none component, \t one phase -the degrees of freedom\nis two. Thus, if we vary temperature by adding heat, either the pressure of the\nsystem, if we keep the volume fixed, or the volume of the system, if we keep the\npressure fixed, will change. On the other hand, a system such as\n-\n\nCa (OH) 2 (s) .0CaO\n\n(s) + H 2 0 (g)\n\nhas three phases and two independent components. The degree of freedom,\ntherefore, is one. Thus, we can change only one variable and still maintain\nequilibrium.\n\nIf we change the amounts of CaO and H2 0 by heat addition, the\ntemperature and pressure will remain constant as long as three phases are\npresent. It should be noted that phase change reactions, i.e.,\n\n6\n\nLOCKHEED. HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nA (s)\n\nA (1)\n\n\nA (1)\n\nA (g)\n\n\nalso have one degree of freedom.\n\nTherefore, one degree of freedom reactions\n\nall behave similarly to the addition of heat -temperature\n\nand pressures remain\n\nconstant during heat addition.\nA reaction such as the following:\nPd - H solid solution\n\nZ\n\nH2 (g)\n\nhas two degrees of freedom (two components, two phases). An adsorption\nreaction of the following type, on the other hand, would appear to have one\ndegree of freedom (two components and three phases):\ncarbon (s) + carbon:adsorbed. H 2 (s) = H 2 (g)\nHowever, the phase carbon:adsorbed H2 (s) is rather an ill-defined phase.\n\nHydrogen molecules are undoubtedly moving around the carbon surface.\n\nThus, just what is the carbon phase and what is the carbon:hydrogen phase\n\nis unclear. The author does not recall ever seeing a discussion of this point.\n\nProbably the degrees of freedom for a surface adsorption equilibrium are\n\nsomething like 1 . In general the solid phase in reactions such as the pre\xc2\xad\nceding must be in a fine granular state to absorb or liberate a substantial\n\nproportion of the available thermal energy. Practical complications arising\n\nfrom settling, agglomeration, and heat transfer through the solid, granular\n\nphase, however, will probably be numerous.\n\n2.1.3\n\nReversible Phase Change Reactions\n\nThese type of reactions can be broken down into three types: first order,\nsecond order, and "other type" phase transitions. First order phase transitions\nare characterized by the following derivatives being discontinuous.\n\n7\nLOCKHEED\n\n-HUNTSVILLE\n\nRESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\n(G\n\nT\n\nwhere G is the Gibbs free energy, Second order phase transitions have contin\xc2\xad\nuous first derivatives of the Gibbs free energy, but discontinuous second deri\xc2\xad\nvatives, i.e.,\n\nac G\n\nare discontinuous.\n\nand\n\n(P$T\n\nFirst order phase transitions are exemplified by the\n\nfollowing:\n+q\n\nA (solid)\n\nA (liquid)\n-q\n+q\n\nA (liquid) 9\n\nA (vapor)\n\n-q\n\nA (solid 1)\n\n4-\n\n-q\n\nA (solid 2)\n\nsolid 1 t solid 2 + liquid (peritetic transition)\nwhere q is the latent heat of phase change.\n\nThe liquid/vapor transition is\n\nnot usually considered for heat storage or thermal control because of the\ncomplications caused by vapor volume. The liquid/solid and solid/solid\ntransitions occur at fixed, definite temperatures variously called melting\npoints, freezing points, or transition points.\n\nThe principles of solid/liquid\n\nphase transitions for HS/TG have been dealt with adequately previously (Refs.\n3 through 7). Data on solid/solid phase transitions as heat storers will be\nfound in Ref. 8.\n\n8\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nSecond order phase transitions or order-disorder transitions involve\na drastic change in heat capacity as a function of temperature, i.e., Fig. 2.\n\no\t\n\nSmax = 2.0 cal/C/\n\n0\n\nC\n\n.20\n\n.12\n08\n\n_\n\n\nP4\n\nUo\n\n50\n\n150\n\n250\n\n350\n\n450\n\nTemperature (0C)\nFig. 2\n\n-\n\nVariation of Specific Heat with Tempgerature of Cu 3 Au Alloy\n\nThe discontinuity in specific heat is the result of an ordering- disordering of\nstructure on cooling or heating.\n\nThe onset of ordering appears at a definite,\n\n"critical" temperature called the Curie temperature.\n\nThe ordering may have\n\nits origin in different molecules of a solid solution arranging themselves into\na more ordered structure, or in magnetic or electric domain ordering.\nlatter two cases have not been investigated in this study as yet.\n\nThe\n\nThe concept\n\nat first glance would not appear to have much potential for HC/TC because the\nspike is not very broad.\n\nLittle additional heat, therefore, could be stored.\n\nthese type transitions are apparently quite slow.\n\nAlso,\n\nHowever, most of the data on\n\nthese transitions come from studies of metallic alloys.\n\nThere are indications\n\nthat nonmetallic systems may possess more internal degrees of freedom than\nmetal alloy systems and hence may. display larger heat capacities because of\ntransitions such as non-rotation ---\n\nrotation.\n\nThis area will be looked into a\n\nlittle further in the remainder of the study.\n\nThe "other type" phase transitions that would appear interesting for pos\xc2\xad\nsible heat storage are the gel\n\n-\n\nliquid transitions.\n\nVery little has been found\n\nto date on these, but more information will be sought in the remainder of the\nstudy.\n\n9\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\n2.2\n\nB TYPE STORAGE\n\nAs indicated previously this type of heat storage involves some degree\nof irreversibility. In this type of storage some option exists over the tem\xc2\xad\nperatures-of collection, storage, and delivery. To facilitate, discussion\ncategory B is broken down into two subcategories. Category BI consists of\nsituations where the collection and delivery reactions take place at essentially\nthe equilibrium temperature, i.e., where AG - 0. Thus, no work is done on\nor by the system during storage reaction.\nthe entropy of the system.\n\nAny heat absorbed just increases\n\nExamples of such systems are as follows:\n\nSolid (Tm) t.-Liquid (Tm)\n\nTransition at Tm\n\nLiquid (T)\n\nStorage at T (Tm > T)\n\nLiquid (T)\n\nLiquid (T)\n\nSolid (Tm)\n\n-\n\nSolid 1 (TR)\n\nDelivery at T to Tm\n\n4 1-Solid\n\n2 + Gas (TR)\nfB\nSolid 2 (TB) -4.

HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nIn the preceding reactions some of the heat is converted to separative\nwork. Thus, it would appear to be possible, by controlling the solution amounts,\nrates of mixing, and rates of heat withdrawal to deliver heat at a higher tem\xc2\xad\nperature than the collection temperature. The amount of heat delivered at the\nhigher temperatures would, of course, be smaller than the amount collected at\nthe lower temperature.\nyet fully dnderstood.\naspect of the study.\n\nThe thermodynamics of the preceding category are not\n\nSection 4, however, outlines progress to date on this\nIt would appear, however, that B2 type storage requires\n\nreactions possessing more than one freedom degree.\nThe transformation of heat into work other than chemical work has not\nbeen considered thus far. In the remainder of the study some consideration\nwill be given to transformation of electrical energy into chemical work. It is\nfelt at the moment that B type storage modes other than chemical, i.e., gravi\xc2\xad\ntational, surface, magnetic, elastic, etc., probably do not offer much potential\nfor HS/TC.\nIn the following subsections some possible BI and BZ storage modes\nare considered in more detail.\n2.2.1\n\nIrreversible Chemical/Physical Reactions\nA chemical/physical reaction may be irreversible, i.e.,\nA (No backwar\n\nB + C\n\nreaction)\nfor one of.three reasons: (1) one of the products is made unavailable for the\nbackward reaction; (2) a high activation energy barrier exists to the backward\nreaction; or (3) so many additional reactions can occur between B and C that\nthe chance of ever producing appreciable amounts of A from B and C is for all\npractical purposes nil. Case (3) obviously is of no further interest to us. Cases\n(1) and (2), however, are of high interest because of the possibility of heat storage\nas chemical energy. Such storage could occur at low or medium temperatures\nobviating the need for insulation. When wanted, stored heat could be liberated\n\n11\nLOCKHEED. HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nby allowing B and C to recombine.\n\nFurthermore, by controlling the rate of\n\nthe reaction, some control over the temperature of heat delivery also would\nbe possible. Case (li requires some ingenuity in system design, and case (2)\nan appropriate catalyst which, however, might not be so easy to identify.

The responsible mechanism in Figs.4 and 5 is a com\xc2\xad\nbination of thermal diffusion and convection. The separating effects of a\ntemperature gradient on a solution is known either as thermal diffusion if the\nseparation occurs within a gas phase or Soret effect if the separation occurs\nwithin the liquid phase. In an arrangement such as shown in Fig. 4 ordinary\ndiffusion would remix the separated solution components if the heat flux were\nstopped. In Fig. 5, however, the products are separated to prevent remixing\nuntil desired.\n\n13\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\nThe topic of separations by thermal diffusion or Glusius Dickel separa\xc2\xad\ntions is too complicated to be gone into here.\n\nThe operation of Clusius-Dickel\n\nseparation.cells has been dealt with extensively in a recent report (Ref. 10).\n\n2.2.2\n\nIrreversible Phase Changes\nIt is well known that a number of substances melt readily but exhibit re\xc2\xad\n\nsistance to freezing.\n\nIn many cases, melts can be cooled far below their freez\xc2\xad\n\ning temperatures with no freezing occurring.\n\nIf, however, an appropriate seed\n\nor catalyst is introduced into the system crystallization proceeds with extreme\nrapidity, or until enough heat is liberated by the crystallization to monitor the\nrate of crystallization.\n\nConceivably a scheme whereby a supercooled melt is\n\nflowed into a crystallizing chamber at an appropriate rate would give control\nover the rate of heat liberation, i.e., Fig. 6.\n\nRefs. 3 through 6 are as relevant\n\nto this concept as they are to the previously discussed reversible phase change\nconcept.\n\n\nI\n\n---\xc2\xad\n\nFA.-Supercooled\nMelt\n\nDevice for\nPumping\nMelt\nCrystallizing Melt\n(After material all\ncrystallized, material\n\nReturn\nPipe\n\n/\n\n/melted\n\nagain and super\xc2\xad\ncooled melt pumped up\nto storage chamber.)\n\nq\n\nFig.6 - Schematic for HS/TC by Supercooled Melts\n\n14\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\n2.3\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nThe A and B3 type storage modes each possess thibir own particular charac\xc2\xad\nteristics which may be particularly advantageous for certain applications. The\nadvantages of type A are obviously that heat storage is very efficient. Essen\xc2\xad\ntially all of the heat input (minus heat leaks) can be stored. On the other hand,\ngood insulation or large amounts of storage material may be required. In the\ncase of type B, the storage of heat may not be as efficient as in type A but could\nhave the advantage of less system bulk, especially if, as implied in Fig. 3, one\nof the material components can be vented to or admitted from outside the system.\nAlso, a greater option exists in the B type storages for control on collection,\nstorage, and delivery temperature. Section 4 discusses the question of effi\xc2\xad\nciencies in each type storage in more detail.\n\n15\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nSection 3\nSELECTION OF HS/TC MATERIAL CANDIDATES\nIn this sectibn, specific HS/TC material candidates are given along with\na rating of 1 or 2. A rating of 1 means the material is definitely a candidate\nfor further investigation, and 2 the material appears interesting but further\ndata are required. It might be added that the task of locating chemical reaction\ncandidates is rather formidable at present because literally thousands of chem\xc2\xad\nical reactions are possible in every temperature range and very little data\nexist on rdversibility and reaction heats or heats of formation. Obviously\nsome guidelines must be developed for selecting likely candidates.

Such a\nframework will, of course, take more time and effort than can be spent in a\nstudy of the present kind. \n However, the survey of concepts presented in Sec\xc2\xad\ntion Z brought to light some considerations and questions which should be in\xc2\xad\ncluded in any general theoretical scheme.\n\nThese are outlined in the following\n\ndiscussion.. It should be mentioned, incidentally, that only thermal energy stor\xc2\xad\nage is considered. Photon enetgy storage and conversion is not considered.\nOne of the first questions that immediately comes to mind is: "How many\nways can one store energy"? This question is readily answered by consulting\nthe general energy equation\n\nPdV+ gdn+ adA+ EdQ + HdM+ gmdh - T2dL\ndE = TdS -where the terms for a closed system, i.e., no addition or subtraction of mat\xc2\xad\nter from the system, are identified as follows\n\nTdS\n\nthermal energy\n\nPdV\n\nwork to alter volume of\nsystem\n\npdn\n\nchemical energy\n\nadA\n\nwork to extend surface\n\nEdQ\n\nwork to electrify system\n\nHdM\n\nwork to magnetize a system\n\ngmh\n\nwork to increase gravitational\npotential\n\nT2 dL\n\nwork to extend elastic system\n\n28\nLOCKHEED- HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\nAs indicated previously, however, it would appear that storage modes other\nthan heat and chemical energy, and possibly electrical energy offer little, if\nany, advantage. The next question to be answered is how efficient is the\nstorage, i.e., how much of the ihput heat is redeliverable at will? We are\ninterested for the moment only in storing heat. We, therefore, will address\nhere only the question of what happens to a system if heat is added or subtracted\nand not what happens to the system if external work is done on or done by the\nsystem.\n\nIn other words we consider here systems as shown in Figs. 9a and\nnot as shown in 9c and 9d.\n\nmw\n\nqu\n\nq o[Ji\n\na.

The efficiency of A type storage, therefore,\nneed not concern us further here.\nB I type storage would appear to have efficiencies ranging from quite\nefficient to very low depending on the particlar circumstances. Take for\nexample the case of supercooled melts. The heat input consists of the following:\nqin = qCp\n\n+\n\nL\n\n29\nLOCKHEED - HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\n\nis the sensible heat required to heat the material to its melting\n\nwhere qc\n\np\npoint and qL the latent heat of phase change.\n\nis lost.\n\nture essentially qC\n\nOn cooling to storage tempera\xc2\xad\n\nThus the storage efficiency is essentially\n\np\n\nES\n\nqL - qC\n\n\n\n+\nqL\nq\nqCP\np\n\nSupercooled melts, therefore, may be fairly efficient or fairly inefficient de\xc2\xad\npending on the relative magnitudes of qL and q.\np\nThe question of efficiency appears to be more complicated in BZ type\nstorage i.e., Fig. 9b and Figs. 3, 4 and 5. In BZ type storage a flow of heat\nfrom T 2 to T1I must necessarily be maintained during the storage operation,\nfor example, see Figs. 3 and 4. Thus we have in effects a Carnot cycle in\nwhich internal work is being performed.\n\nThe limiting efficiency of such a\n\nprocess would therefore be given by:\nq stored\nqin\n\nTz-\n\nq.\n\nT1I\nTz\n\nassuming of course that a mechanism exists that would be 100% effective in\nconverting available energy into potential energy.\nThe next question is the magnitude of actual or realistic efficiencies.\nThese would appear to be governed by the availability of a suitable mechanism\nfor performing work and the rates of heat input and work performance.\n\nCon\xc2\xad\n\nsider. for example, the case of separation by thermal diffusion. A system such\nas pictured in Fig.4 is in a semi-steady-state (SSS) condition. That is to say\nheat transport by thermal conduction is essentially at steady state (SS).\nrative work, however, is being performed.\n\nSepa\xc2\xad\n\nSeparative work would continue\n\n30\nLOCKHEED-HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D496600\n\nto be performed until the rate of separation by thermal diffusion became equal\nto the rate of back diffusion by ordinary chemical diffusion or until steady state.\nOnsager. Worked out a relationship for maximum, actual efficiency of a thermal\ndiffusion separation.\n\nThis can be given by the following ratio (Onsager gave\n\nthe ratio in terms of entropy increases and decreases):\n\no\n\n-\n\nperformance\nmaximum rate of workby conduction\nrate of heat transport\n\nThe condition of maximum work performance according to Onsager is when\n\njD\nD2\n\nTD\n\nthat is, when the mass flux due to thermal diffusion is twice the back mass\nflux due to ordinary diffusion. Further discussion of the Onsager efficiency\nis given in Ref. 10.\nIf the preceding line of reasoning remains valid after a more thorough\nstudy, the practical limits on storage efficiency can be identified as the activa\xc2\xad\ntion energy barriers to rate processes such as ordinary diffusion, thermal\ndiffusion, electrodiffusion, magnetodiffusion, and so on. Also, it is fairly\nobvious that each heat storage mode will necessarily be limited as to the\namount of heat storage. For example, if the heat flux to a system performing\nwork by thermal diffusion is exceeded, i.e., if the heat is supplied faster than\ncan be transported or absorbed by conduction and thermal diffusion, boiling\nwill then set in.\nThe preceding theoretical concepts need, of course, to be further studied\nand validated.

Energy storage by chemical reactions as a means to circumn\xc2\xad\nvent some of the problems noted with sensible or latent heat materials is con\xc2\xad\nsidered. The consideration identifies a number of potential advantages for\nmaterials that store energy by chemical reaction over sensible or latent heat\nstores. Among the foreseen advantages are larger heat capacitance, simpler\nand more efficient system designs, and more options with regard to collection\nand delivery temperatures.\nSolar thermal energy storage systems based on materials which store\nheat, either as sensible heat or as latent heat of fusion possess the general\ncharacteristics shown in the following schematic.\n\nSola-r\n\nCollector\n\n\n__]\nHeat\n\nDepository\n\nEssentials of Solar Thermal Energy Storage Systems\n\nL1\n\n\nLOCKHEED\n\n-HUNTSVILLE\n\nRESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA number of problems are associated with actual operation, however. These\ncan be categorized according to the heat storage material used. For conven\xc2\xad\nience of discussion, materials that store heat as sensible heat here are called\nTCMs, an abbreviation for thermal capacity materials.\n\nThose that store heat\n\nas \tlatent heat of fusion are usually called PCMs, an abbreviation for phase\nchange materials. The summary of operational problems, according to the\nheat \'storage material, is as follows.\n\nTCM\n" \t TCM temperature continuously rises during collection.\nresult is greater and greater convective heat losses.\n\nThe\n\n* \t\nTCM temperature continuously drops during heat deposition.\nThe result is smaller and smaller heat flux deliveries.\n* \t Large quantities of TGMs are required, which may pose\n\ninstallation problems in established homes.\n\n* \t Because the optimum delivery temperatures are different\nfor heating and cooling requirements, two storage tanks are\nrequired for dual function subsystems.\n" \t If water is used as a TOM the highest practical storage or\ndelivery temperature is near 100C (ZZ\xc2\xb00F) which poses a\nproblem in that storage for cooling is only between 200 and\n212\'F.\n* \t Heat storage in TCMs occurs at temperatures higher than\nambient. Insulation to prevent heat losses is therefore re\xc2\xad\nquired which adds to Pystem cost.\n\nPCM\n\n* \t Because of the nature of PCMs the material itself if not usually\nused as a heat transfer agent, i.e., separate fluid loops are\nusually required for heat pickup at the solar collectors and\nheat delivery at the depository.\n\n2\n\n\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n\n" \t PCMs typically possess low thermal diffusivities, neces\xc2\xad\nsitating special (i.e., expensive) heat exchangers.\n\n* \t A variety of operational problems is associated with PCM\n\nusage. For example, some PCMs "melt" to form a liquid\n\nphase and another solid phase. The second solid can sink\n\nand thus not be available for the reaction to reform original\nPCM. Other problems include eventual destruction by re\xc2\xad\npeated thermal cycling of catalyst added to overcome super\xc2\xad\ncooling. Additionally, corrosion of the PCM container can\nintroduce impurities that can affect performance.\n" \t Careful consideration must be given to the design of heat\n\nexchangers to ensure that the PCM freezing rates can keep\n\nup with the rates of heat removal. Again, special designs\n\nmay be required which can result in added costs.\n\n* \t Relatively few inexpensive PCMs have been identified (Ref. 1).\n* \t As with TCMs, two different PCMs and two storage tanks are\nrequired for systems that incorporal~e both heating and cooling\nsubsystems. Dual PCM storage is required because the opti\xc2\xad\nmum delivery temperatures are different for heating and cooling.\n" \t PCM heat storage temperatures, if significantly different from\nambient, may require specially insulated storage containers.\nThe preceding discussion is meant to indicate some of the problems that\ncan be encountered with TCMs and PCMs. A number of the problems, if not\nall, will undoubtedly be resolved satisfactorly in the course of further research\nand development on TCMs and PCMs. It is appropriate, however, to inquire\nwhat the advantages might be of systems based on chemical reactions or CCMs\n(an abbreviation for chemical change materials).\nThe concept of utilizing CCMs for energy storage is a relatively new,\nundeveloped concept at present.\n\nThe main attraction of CCM systems is that\n\nthe heats of reaction can be considerably larger than sensible heats and heats\nFarrington Daniels (Ref. 2) mentioned a few CCM possibilities, but\nto \tthe best of our knowledge only recently has the concept attracted more than\nof \tfusion.\n\nIt is necessary, therefore, at this point,\n\ncursory attention (Refs. 3, 4 and 5).\n\nin \ttime to seek to gain some understanding of the operation of chemical re\xc2\xad\nA consideration of the operation of PCMs\n\nactions with regard to heat storage.\n3\n\n3\'\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nis worthwhile in this regard because the principles involved are generally\nthe same as for CCMs.\n\nPCM operation furthermore is simpler than CCM\n\nand therefore more suitable for orientation purposes.\nbrief review of PCM operation.\n\nThe following is a\n\nMore detailed considerations of PCM opera\xc2\xad\n\ntion are available in Ref. 6.\nConsider the operation of a PCM as a heat storer in the following device:\n\nPf\n\nHot Fluid from Solar Collector\n-T I\nLiquid PCM\nI\nT\n\nHeat\nStore\n\nSolid PCM\n\nT2\n\nFluid to Heat Depository\n\n-I\n\nThe terms TI, Tm, and T 2 are temperatures at the indicated locations. The\n\nor the temperature\n\nThe temperature T 1 needs to be somewhat higher than T\nat the solid/liquid interface in order to transfer heat to the melting PCM. The\n\n\' temperature T 2 needs to be somewhat low4er than T m in order to transfer heat\n\nfrom solidifying PCIVI. If the thermal diffusivities of solid and liquid PCMs\nare high T 1 and T\n\nneed not be much greater or lower than T m. In such a\n\ncase heat can be collected and delivered by the PCM at essentially the melting\ntemperature of the PCM.\nAnother arrangement can be conceived:\n\nsuppose that the liquid as it is\n\nformed is siphoned and stored in a separate container. Suppose further that\nthe PCM liquid will not freeze without the adding of a catalyst. The tempera\xc2\xad\nture of the liquid PCM can thus be allowed to drop far below the melting point,\nand heat can be stored in the PCM at ambient temperatures without the need\nof elaborate insulation. When the need for heat delivery arises the liquid\nFurthermore, suppose that the super\xc2\xad\n\nPCM can be inoculated with catalyst.\n\ncooled, liquid PCM is subjected to a pressure higher than that at which it was\n4\n40\n\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nMost substances possess melting point temperatures that increase\nas pressure is increased, water being the exception (Ref. 7). By increasing\nthe pressure on a supercooled, liquid PCM, freezing theoretically can occur\n\nmelted.\n\nat a higher temperature than that at which melting occurred.\n\nHeat delivery\n\nat a temperature higher than that at which heat collection and storage occurred\nis thereby possible.\nTo consider now the operation of CCM systems, it is convenient to utilize\nfor orientation purposes the chemical system suggested in Ref. 3 for high tem\xc2\xad\nperature solar heat collection and delivery.\n\nThe system under discussion is\n\ncalled the SOLCHEM system and depends on the following gaseous, chemical\ncycle.\n\n800 to 1000 0 C\nSolar Energy\nSO Z +0O\n\n\nS03\n\n1\ntCooling\n\nHeat abstracted\nto preheat SO 3\n\nCoolingC 100\nto\n\nso3\n\n1\n\nCatalyst\n\nSO Z + 02\n\n5000 to 6oo 0 c\n\nThe dissociation of SO 3 into SO\n\nand 02 absorbs heat energy while the re\xc2\xad\n\ncombination of SO2 and 02 liberates some 23 kcal/mole (Ref. 3).\n\nThe SOLCHEM\n\nsystem, it should be noted, does not possess the capability of delivering heat\nat a temperature higher than that at which it was collected.\nWith the preceding discussion as background, a conception of desirable\n\ncharacteristics for a CCM. system for home heating and cooling may be con\xc2\xad\nsidered.\n\nSome desirable characteristics are indicated in the schematic on\n\n\nthe following page.\n5\n\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n\n-50-60 0C\n___1\nSolar Energy + Liquid 1 -------- \n\n(Photon or Thermal)\n\nLiquid 2 + Fine Solid Particles\nor\n\nHeat Abstraction\nto Preheat Liquid 1\n\nif Reaction is Motivated\nby Heat.\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\nGas (O, N 2 , GO, CO 2 or HO)\n\n2/0\n+ Fine Solid Particles (or Liquid Z)\n\n/\n\nCooling and\nSeparation\nof Products\nCatalyst and\nLiquid 1\n\n.\n\nCooled Separated\nProducts\n\nPressure or\nConcentration\nAdjustment\n- 100 0 C or\n\nGreater\n\nHeat to\nDepository\n\nDesirable Characteristics for a Solar CCM Storage System\n\nA CCM system depending on liquid and solid reactants is viewed as\ndesirable to minimize storage volumes.\nas the heat transfer agents.\n\nLiquids furthermore can be used\n\nWhere gases might be evolved, it is desirable\n\nthat they can be obtained from or vented to the atmosphere.\n\nThe attractive\xc2\xad\n\nness of having reactions where a liquid is decomposed into another liquid and\nsolid particles or gas lies in the ease of separation and subsequent storage.\nFor example, consider the schematic on the following page.\n\n6\n42E\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nSolar\n\n/\n\nProduct\n\nGaseous\n\n\n/\t\n\nPreheating by\n\nL_ \t\n\nEscaping Gaseous\n\nProducts \t\n\n--\n\n.\n\ntr\nLiquid 2 Immiscible\n\n-\t\n\n-Density \t\nLiquid_ 1\n\nwith Liquid 1 and\nof Liquid\nLiquid 1\n\nReactor\n\nTo Heat\nDepository\n\nIf solid particles are generated in the chemical reaction they can be separated\nby sedimentation.\n\nThe motivating force for the chemical reaction may be either\n\nphotonic or thermal solar energy, although photon chemical reactions investi\xc2\xad\ngated to date have apparently proved to be quite inefficient.\n\nThe preceding brief\n\ndiscussion should serve to indicated the general considerations relevant to CCM\nstorage systems. A number of specific questions, of course, arise. Two that\nare anticipated to be of utmost importance are:\n* \t Identifying specific CCMs, and\n* \t Controlling reaction rates either by catalysts, pressure,\nor reactant concentrations to achieve desirable temperatures.\n\n7\n\n42\nLOCKHEED - HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n\nThe mentioned areas require detailed considerations of factors such\nas reversibility of any given reaction as a function of temperature and pres\xc2\xad\nsure, reaction rate control, catalyst identification and procurement, possible\nside reactions, materials compatibilities and toxicities, materials and equip\xc2\xad\nThe incentive for pursuing development of CCM\nsystems lies in their potential advantages which may be summarized as\nfollows:\nment costs, and so on.\n\nTheoretical Advantages of CCM Storage Systems\nfor Home Heating/Cooling\n* Heat collection and delivery at essentially constant temper\xc2\xad\natures.\n" \t Delivery temperatures higher than collection temperatures.\n* \t Larger heat storage potential than either TCMs or POMs.\n" \t Storage at ambient temperatures.\n* \t One storage tank which would meet both heating and cooling\nrequirements.\nAs mentioned previously some of the stated advantages for CCMs can\napply also to PCMs. The potential advantages of CCMs over PCMs lie in\ntheir larger heat storage capacities, the ability of CCMs to be both the heat\ntransfer and heat storage media, and the greater number of options offered\nby CCMs with regard to collection and delivery temperatures and storage\narrangements.\nIt is evident that the COM storage concept will require an extensive\nresearch and development before its practicality can be assessed. Two\nspecific CCM systems can be mentioned which appear interesting at present\nand which can serve the purpose of model systems for definition of important\nproblem areas. The first involves the following reactions.\n\n8\n\n4K\nLOCKHEED - HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n2NO2 (gas)\n\nN 2 04 (gas) + 147 cal/gm\n\nTemperature range = -11.2 to 73 0 C\n\nNO 2 (gas) + 151 cal/gm\n\nNO (gas) + i/2 0Z (gas)\n\n-\n\nat temperatures over 60 0 C\n\nTwo disadvantages of this system are that it is essentially gaseous and the\nNO\n\n4\n\nr0 NO2\n\nreaction proceeds as readily backward as it does forward\n\nwithout a catalyst.\n\nHowever, it may be possible to retard the back reaction\n\nby lowering pressure or by other means which will perhaps become obvious\nwhen the kinetics of the reaction are studied in detail.\n\nAnother possibility\n\nthat warrants investigation is to conduct the reaction in solution.\nNO 2 system offers further avenues for storing heat.\n\nThe NZO 4\n\nThese lie in the rather\n\nlarge heats of fusion and vaporization and are given in the following set of\nreactions.\nN20\n\n4\n\n(liquid)\n\nN 204 (vapor)\n\n-\n\nLxH v = 198 cal/gm\nTboiling = 21.150C\nand\nNO 4 (liquid)\n\nA\n\nN 2 0 4 (solid)\n\n-\n\n= 76 cal/gm\n\n11.2\xc2\xb0C\n\n\nTmelt\n\n-\n\n9\n+5N\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nWith ingenuity in storage system design it, may be possible to utilize all of\nthe indicated heats.
