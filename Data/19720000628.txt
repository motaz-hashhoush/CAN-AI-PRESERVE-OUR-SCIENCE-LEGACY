D.C. 20546\n\nMAGNETOMETER USES BISMUTH-SELENIDE\nHall resistivity measurements on single crystals of\nbismuth-selenjde show it to be an excellent material for\nuse as a magnetometer. For any temperature between 300\nand 1.2 K (80.33\xc2\xb0F and 457.5\xc2\xb0F), plots of Hall resistivity\nversus magnetic field are linear to within the experimental\nuncertainty of \xc2\xb11 percent in magnetic fields up to 11\nTesla. The slopes of the plots, however; vary with\ntemperature. In addition, Hall resistivity versus magnetic\nfield plots are independent of temperature to within 2\npercent for temperatures below the liquid nitrogen boiling\npoint (78 K) (319.27-17).\nA bismuth-selenide magnetometer has significant advantages over most other magnetometers presently in\ncommon use. Being temperature independent below 78 K\n(-3 19.27\xc2\xb0F), the same calibration can be used for measurements in various cryogenic fluids. Copper magnetoresistors, for example, depend strongly on temperature, thus\nneeding a magnetoresistance calibration for every temperature used. Under variable temperature conditions, this\nis often impractical. Bismuth-selenide magnetometers\nwithstand thermal cycling from ambient to liquid helium\ntemperatures, as demonstrated by repeated direct immersions in liquid helium with no changes in magnetometer\ncalibrations.\nA second significant advantage of the bismuth-selenide\nmagnetometer is the good linearity of output versus\nmagnetic field over a wide range of temperatures. Present\nHall effect devices work well at 300 K (80.33\xc2\xb0F) but\nfrequently have oscillations superimposed as a function of\nfield at low temperatures. The bismuth-selenide tested was\np-type with a carrier concentration of approximately\n1019 per cubic centimeter. Under these conditions, there\nare apparently no carriers with low enough effective\nmasses to cause oscillatory effects for fields below II\nTesla.\nA third major desirable feature of bismuth-selenide\nmagnetometers is that accurate orientation is possible due\nto a very flat natural cleavage plane perpendicular to the\ncrystalographic "C" axis.\n\nNOTE:\nNo additional documentation is available.
