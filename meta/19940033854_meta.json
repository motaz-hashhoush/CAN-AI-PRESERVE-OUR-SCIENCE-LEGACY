A serendipitous observation in our laboratory that most Chinese subjects become motion sick prompted this study. We used a rotating optokinetic drum to provoke motion sickness and compared gastric responses and symptom reports of Chinese, European-American, and African-American subjects. There was no difference in the responses of European-American and African-American subjects; however, Chinese subjects showed significantly greater disturbances in gastric activity and reported significantly more severe symptoms. We suggest that this hypersusceptibility presents a natural model for the study of physiological mechanisms of nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.", "title": "Chinese hyper-susceptibility to vection-induced motion sickness", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T12:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940033854, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stern, Robert M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lyndon B.
