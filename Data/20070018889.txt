b"Firefighting Module NASA and the U.S. Coast\nGuard are working jointly to develop a helicopter transportable firefighting module that can\nshave precious minutes in combating shipboara\nor harbor fires. The program was undertaken in\n1975, after a series of disastrous fires on oil\ntankers indicated a need for a lightweight, selfcontained system that could be moved quickly\nto the scene of a fire. A prototype module was\ndelivered to the Coast Guard last year and\nservice testina is under wav.\nThe compact module weighs little more\nthan a ton but it contains everything needed to\nfight a fire. The key component is a high output\npump, which delivers up to 2,000 gallons of sea\nwater a minute; the pump can be brought up to\nmaximum output in only one minute after\nturning on the power source, a small Allison gas\nturbine engine. The module also contains hose,\na foam nozzle and a spray nozzle, three sets of\nprotective clothing for firefighters, and fuel for\nthree hours operation. Designed to be assembled without special tools, the module can\nbe set up for operation in less than 20 minutes.\nHelicopter transportability saves time either\nby direct air delivery of the module to the fire\nlocale or by delivery to the deck of a ship\nalready en route to the scene. The airlift capability makes feasible broader use of the module\nbeyond the Coast Guard application, for example, firefighting in forests or other land areas\nadjacent to water. Where road delivery is possible, the module can be mounted on a trailer or\nsystem pictured at\na light truck as in the F~refly\nthe top of the page. The unit is also adaptable\n\nto non-firefighting applications requiring a small,\nmobile, high performance pumping systememergency water removal, for example.\nModule development is being directed by\nNASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which\nacquired extensive experience from space\nprojects involving high-capacity rocket engine\npumps, l~ghtweight\nmaterials and compact\npackaging. Marshall's contractor for design\nand construction of the module is Northern\nResearch and Engineering Corporation,\nCambridge, Massachusetts. Northern Research\nis working with Aviation Power Supply, Inc.,\nBurbank, California, to develop the Firefly system, shown undergoing test above. Firefly is a\ncommercial version of the NASA/Coast Guard\nmodule which uses the same pump and other\ncomponents.\n\n"
