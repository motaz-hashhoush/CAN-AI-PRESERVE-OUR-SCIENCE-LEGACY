Satellite technology will likely be an important part of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) in the next decade. Several candidate communications technologies that may be used to carry a portion of the increased data traffic have been reviewed, and estimates of the future demand for satellite capacity have been made. A study was conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center to assess the satellite addressable markets for broadband applications. This study effort included four specific milestones: (1) assess the changing nature of broadband applications and their usage, (2) assess broadband satellite and terrestrial technologies, (3) estimate the size of the global satellite addressable market from 2000 to 2010, and (4) identify how the impact of future technology developments could increase the utility of satellite-based transport to serve this market.", "title": "Broadband Satellite Technologies and Markets Assessed", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050188548, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wallett, Thomas M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "6519e9482c564d8b828debcbacc063c0"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050188548, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050188548, "id": "33bd36c91f0249f39fdc37561e7866ad", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1998", "publicationDate": "1999-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19990052647, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Research and Technology, 1998", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050188548.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050188548/downloads/20050188548.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050188548/downloads/20050188548.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050188548/downloads/20050188548.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
