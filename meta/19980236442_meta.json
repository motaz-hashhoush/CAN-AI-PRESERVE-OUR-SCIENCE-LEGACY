Available thermochemical data for Si-O-H(g) species were used to calculate boundary layer controlled fluxes from SiO2. Calculated fluxes were compared to volatilization rates Of SiO2 scales grown on SiC which were measured in Part 1 of this paper. Calculated volatilization rates were also compared to those measured in synthetic combustion gas furnace tests. Probable vapor species were identified in both fuel-lean and fuel-rich combustion environments based on the observed pressure, temperature and velocity dependencies as well as the magnitude of the volatility rate. Water vapor is responsible for the degradation of SiO2 in the fuel-lean environment. Silica volatility in fuel-lean combustion environments is attributed primarily to the formation of Si(OH)4(g) with a small contribution of SiO(OH)2(g).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980236442, "id": "70a4b8f2357a424483f51211e275758f", "publicationDate": "1998-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980236442.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980236442/downloads/19980236442.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980236442/downloads/19980236442.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980236442/downloads/19980236442.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
