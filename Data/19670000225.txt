The valve has been designed to withstand extreme impact loading (up to 10,000 g's envisioned) for\nuse on hard landing lunar and planetary probes.\nBecause of its space application also, weight and size\nconiderations take on added importance.\nThe valve is made up of an upper and a lower housing, the lower containing an inlet and an outlet port,\nand upper containing a cavity. A lightweight, thin\ndiaphragm divides the cavity into an upper and a\nlower chamber. The upper chamber is filled with a\ntemperature sensitive material such as silicone rubber\nthat will expand or contract in a predetermined manner in response to temperature changes.\nIn operation, the temperature of the incoming fluid\nthrough the inlet port causes the temperature sensitive material to contract or expand, thus causing the\n\ndiaphragm to move up or down, respectively, to open\nor restrict the flow passage between inlet and outlet\nports.\nNote:\nInquiries concerning this invention may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: B67-10225\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to NASA, Code\nGP, Washington, D.C. 20546.\nSource: Marshall B.
