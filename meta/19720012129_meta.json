The measurements were performed in CO that had expanded from equilibrium reservoir conditions of 7060 deg K at 17.3 atm pressure and from 6260 deg K at 10.0 atm pressure. Two RAM flight probes were used to measure electron density and electron temperature in the expanding flow of a shock tunnel. Experiments were performed in the inviscid flow with both probes and in the nozzle-wall boundary layer with the constant bias-voltage probe. The distributions of electron density and electron temperature were independently measured using voltage-swept thin-wire probes. Thin-wire Langmuir probes were also used to measure the electron-density and electron-temperature distributions in the boundary layer of a sharp flat plate located on the nozzle centerline. Admittance measurements were performed with the RAM C and RAM C-C S-band antennas in the presence of an ionized boundary layer.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720012129, "publisher": "NASA", "id": "af4b7a510c144caaa27f21998e70e4ff", "publicationDate": "1972-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720012129.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720012129/downloads/19720012129.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720012129/downloads/19720012129.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720012129/downloads/19720012129.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
