Flight engineering for the Voyager project has the objectives of delivering a functioning spacecraft containing observing sequences to the right places at the right times. Due to the changing environment as the mission has progressed outward from Jupiter to Saturn to Uranus (and on to Neptune), this engineering task has included the development of significant new capabilities. The paper utilizes the case-study method to examine some new spacecraft capabilities in three subsystems: data, attitude and articulation control, and power. The implementation of a new navigational data-type, delta DOR, is also reviewed. An overview is given of the Voyager sequencing process for the cruise and encounter phases with a case study focusing on late updating of part of the near encounter sequence. The prospective mission to Neptune is previewed.", "title": "Voyager flight engineering - Preparing for Uranus", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T10:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850037486, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mclaughlin, W.
