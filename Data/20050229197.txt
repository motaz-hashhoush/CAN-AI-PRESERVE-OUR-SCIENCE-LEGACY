The\ngoal of the Ulysses mission is to provide an accurate assessment of our total solar\nenvironment. This collaborative ESA/NASA\nmission will, for the first time, explore the\nheliosphere -- the region of space that is dominated by the Sun (Figure 1) -- within a few\nastronomical units of the Sun over the full range of heliographic latitudes. The path\nfollowed by the spacecraft, using a Jupiter gravity-assist to achieve a trajectory extending\nto high solar latitudes, will enable the highly sophisticated scientific instruments on board\nto make measurements in the uncharted third dimension of the heliosphere. The\nUlysses spacecraft will carry nine scientific instruments to measure the properties of the\nsolar corona, the solar wind, the Sun/wind interface, the heliospheric magnetic field,\nsolar radio bursts, plasma waves, solar X-rays, solar and galactic cosmic rays, and the\ninterplanetary/interstellar\nneutral gas and dust. Scientists will take advantage of the\nenormous distance between the spacecraft and the Earth to perform astrophysical\nmeasurements and to search for gravitational waves. In conjunction with instrumentation\non Earth-orbiting spacecraft, Ulysses will help to precisely locate the mysterious sources\nof cosmic gamma bursts. The results obtained will help to solve outstanding problems in\nsolar and heiiospheric physics, while undoubtedly revealing new and unanticipated\nphenomena,\n\nBackground\nThe basis for the Ulysses project was first conceived in the late 1950\xe2\x80\x99s by Prof. J.A.\nSimpson of the University of Chicago. Originally it was planned as a two-spacecraft\nmission between NASA and ESA. Named \xe2\x80\x9cOut of Ecliptic,\xe2\x80\x9d this mission would enable\nscientists to study regions of the Sun and the surrounding space environment above the\nplane of the ecliptic that had never before been studied, Later the project name was\nchanged to \xe2\x80\x9cInternational SoIar Polar Mission\xe2\x80\x9d (ISPM). Unfortunately, delays in Shuttle\ndevelopment and concerns over the effectiveness of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) led\nto a House Appropriations\nCommittee recommendation in the 1980 Supplemental\nAppropriations\nBill that ISPM be terminated. Later, in 1981, budget cuts led NASA to\ncancel the U.S. spacecraft contribution to the joint NASA/ESA ISPM mission. The ESA\nspacecraft completed its flight acceptance tests in early 1983 and was placed in storage.\nIn 1984, the ISPM mission was renamed as the \xe2\x80\x9cUlysses Project,\xe2\x80\x9d following a proposal by\nProf. Bruno Bertotti, of the University of Pavia, Italy. It was to be launched in 1986.\nAfter the Challenger incident, it was again rescheduled, this time for a 1990 launch.

High solar latitude\nand the corona, regions of the Sun that give rise to most\nfill the heliosphere, \\vill greatly aid solar physicists in the\ncoherent model of the Sun and its heliosphere.\n\nDespite the general acceptance that the heliosphere is intrinsically three-dimensional in\nnature, our current understanding of the physical processes occurring within this\nenvironment is essentially based on observations made close to the plane of the ecliptic.\nMost interplanetary spacecraft have remained within a small angle of the ecliptic plane:\nconsequently, our view of the Sun and our solar system\xe2\x80\x99s interplanetary environment has\nbeen very restricted. Our present understanding of the Sun could be compared to trying\n\n3\n\nto make a map of the Earth by flying an airplane around the equator. Ulysses, having as\nits primary objective the study of the inner heliosphere in three dimensions, will provide\nthe first in situ observations covering the full range of heliographic latitudes.\n\nBenefits to be Derived\nUlysses is expected to make major scientific contributions to the International\nHeliospheric Study. The aim of this study is to provide coordinated investigations of the\nlarge-scale structure of the heliosphere by exploiting the simultaneous existence of four\nspacecraft in the outer heliosphere (Pioneer 10, 11 and Voyager 1, 2), Ulysses in the\ninner heliosphere, and other spacecraft in the ecliptic. The relationship of the Ulysses\ntrajectory to the network of the deep-space missions, all of which will be beyond 30 AU\nin the first half of the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, is shown schematically in Figure 2.\nMost scientists agree that the solar wind that flows from the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s poles probably has\nconstant speed, unlike the wind from the equator. Such straightforward streams of\nparticles are not expected to tangle the magnetic field lines above the poles. The\nmagnetic field lines there may be more open and less complicated than the twisted and\ntangled paths near the equator. If that is true, scientists could measure and understand\nmany events that cannot be understood near the equator. The major accomplishment\nwould be a clarification of conflicting theories about the heliosphere. For example,\ncosmic rays that enter the solar system near the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s equator are robbed of their energy\nas they twist and turn and leap along the complex magnetic field lines. They are altered\nso dramatically by the loss of energy as to be almost unrecognizable.\nGalactic cosmic\nrays must be detected in their original, pristine condition if their true nature is to be\nunderstood. Scientists believe that cosmic rays in or near this condition can be detected\nover the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s poles. Ulysses bill attempt to detect these particles in their unaltered\nstate.\nUlysses will make observations during the maximum and the declining phases of the\nsolar cycle. The pole-to-pole passage will occur near solar minimum conditions, and the\nspacecraft should encounter a relatively well-ordered heliospheric structure in which\nlatitude dependencies are most obvious.\nIn addition, Ulysses will allow scientists to study the behavior of interstellar neutral and\nionized gas in the heliosphere and the heliopause where effects of the solar wind are at a\nminimum. And, for the first time, the measurement of the speed and flight direction of\nparticles within the interplanetary dust cloud will be made well above the ecliptic.\n\n4\n\n0\nF\ne\n\ni\nY\n\ni\nI+-\n\n1990\nI\n50 AU\n40\nECLIPTIC PLANE\n\nS\n\nULS\n\nSpacecraft trajectories mapped into a common meridian plane.

ULS = Ulysses.\nV = Voyager, P = Pioneer, E = Earth, J = Jupiter, S = Saturn,\nU = Uranus, N = Neptune.\n\nFigure 2. Spacecraft Trajectories\n\nPrior Mission Results\nAstrophysicists study the Sun because it is the only star that is close enough to study in\ndetail. Physicists probe the Sun because it is a marvelous laboratory where they can\nobserve unique conditions of temperature, density, fluid motions, and magnetic fields.\nThe goal of atmospheric physicists and climatologists is to understand the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s effects\non the Earth. These scientists can trace the lineage of their endeavors back more than\nthree centuries to the year 1610 when Galileo aimed his new telescope at the Sun and\nsaw for the first time that our nearest star rotates and that its surface is speckled with\nsunspots.\nWhile our knowledge has grown a thousandfold since Galileo\xe2\x80\x99s time, it was the advent of\nspace exploration in 1958 that accelerated our understanding of the Sun. Suddenly\nscientists could send their instruments above Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, which clouds and\ndistorts their viewing.\nFor more than two and one-half decades scientists have mounted instruments on\nspacecraft to study the Sun and the solar wind -- and the entire heliosphere. Mariner 2,\nfor example, confirmed the existence of solar wind, a plasma that streams from the Sun.\nBut none of these machines could fly above the plane of the ecliptic -- the plane in\nwhich Earth orbits the Sun. To fly out of the ecliptic, to overcome the energy imparted\nto a spacecraft by the motion of Earth around the Sun, requires more rocket power than\nis available. Therefore scientists have been unable to study two subjects of great\nimportance:\nthe entire set of interactions of solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays\nthat take place at the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s poles; and interactions of the three-dimensional physics of\nthe Sun.\n\n6\n\nMISSION\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nPrimary Objectives\nThe primary objectives of\nfunction of solar latitude,\ninterface, the heliospheric\nX-rays, solar and galactic\ndust.\n\nthe Ulysses mission are to investigate for the first time, as a\nthe properties of the solar wind, the structure of the Sun/wind\nmagnetic field, solar radio bursts and plasma waves, solar\ncosmic rays, and interstellar interplanetary neutral gas and\n\nSecondary Objectives\nSecondary objectives of the mission include interplanetary-physics\ninvestigations during\nthe in-ecliptic Earth-Jupiter phase, measurements of the Jovian magnetosphere during\nthe Jupiter flyby phase, the detection of cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and a search for\ngravitational waves from cataclysmic cosmic events.\n\nScience Objectives\nThe detailed scientific objectives of the various instruments,\noverall Ulysses objectives, are as follows:\n.\n\n0\n\nl\n\n.\n\nas they contribute\n\nto the\n\nTo provide an accurate assessment of the global three-dimensional\nproperties of the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind\nTo improve our knowledge of the composition of the solar atmosphere and\nthe origin and acceleration of the solar wind by systematically studying the\ncomposition of the solar-wind plasma and solar energetic particles at\ndifferent heliographic latitudes\nTo provide new insight into the acceleration of energetic particles in solar\nflares and into storage and transport of these particles in the corona by\nobserving the X-ray and particle emission from solar active regions and\nfrom other magnetic configurations that are more accessible for study from\nout-of-the ecliptic\nTo further our knowledge of the internal dynamics of the solar wind, of the\nwaves, shocks and other discontinuities, and of the heliospheric propagation\nand acceleration of energetic particles, by sampling plasma conditions that\nare expected to be different from those available for study near the ecliptic\n\n.\n\nTo improve our understanding of the spectra and composition of galactic\ncosmic rays in interstellar space by measuring the solar modulation of these\nparticles as a function of heliographic latitude and by sampling these\nparticles over the solar poles, where low-energy cosmic rays may have an\neasier access to the inner solar system than near the ecliptic plane\n\n.\n\nTo advance our knowledge of the neutral component of interstellar gas by\nmeasuring as a function of heliographic latitude the properties and\ndistribution of neutral gas that enters the heliosphere\n\n.\n\nTo improve our understanding of interplanetary dust by measuring its\nproperties and distribution as a function of heliographic latitude\n\n.\n\nTo search for gamma-ray-burst sources and, in conjunction with\nobservations from other spacecraft, to identify them with known celestial\nobjects or phenomena\n\nl\n\nTo search for low-frequency gravitational waves by recording very precise\ntwo-way Doppler tracking data at the ground stations.\n\nDirector\nSolar System Exploration\n\nMr. Robert F. Murray\nUlysses Program Manager\nDivision\n\n8\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nMISSION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nMission Plan\nThe Ulysses spacecraft will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center using the\nNASA Space Shuttle (Figure 3) for insertion into near-Earth orbit. An IUS/PAM-S\nupper stage combination will inject it into an interplanetary trajectory toward Jupiter\n(Figures 4 and 5). Ulysses will then use Jupiter as a gravity assist, passing near the north\npole of the planet. At this point, the Jovian gravitational field will deflect the spacecraft\ninto a high-inclination\norbit, taking it south of the ecliptic plane. This high-inclination\norbit will result in a maximum solar latitude of 72 to 85 degrees, an aphelion at 5.4\nastronomical units (AU), and perihelion at 1.3 AU.\nLaunch will take place in early October 1990. A fly-by of Jupiter will occur in February\n1992, while arrival at the southern solar latitudes is scheduled for May 1994. The\nspacecraft will arrive at the northern latitudes in May 1995 and will spend a minimum of\n150 days above 70 degrees latitude.\nThe primary mission will come to an end almost five years after launch when the\nspacecraft dips below 70 degrees north latitude. The spacecraft will have detected and\nmeasured particles inbound from the Milky Way, explored the heliosphere at almost all\nlatitudes, and measured phenomena above both poles of the Sun.\n\nInternational\n\nCooperation\n\nThe NASA and ESA responsibilities for the cooperative Ulysses mission were defined in\na Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), agreed upon for the original dual-spacecraft\nmission, dated 29 March 1979. ESA is responsible for the development of the spacecraft\nand its in-orbit operation, as well as providing mission operations support personnel,\noperations software, and approximately one-half of the science instruments. NASA\nprovides the remaining one-half of the science instruments and is responsible for\nprovision of the launcher and all launch services, provision of the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s power\ngenerator, operating the Ulysses Mission Control Center, tracking and data-acquisition\nsupport by the Deep Space Network (DSN), and processing and distribution of the data.\nThe scientific payload is made up of instruments from both the US and ESA member\nstates. The mission is being carried out by two projects -- one American and one\nEuropean -- located at JPL. Each project has its own Project Manager and Project\nScientist. Joint decisions are made by a Joint Working Group (JWG), consisting of the\ntwo Project Managers and the two Project Scientists. This division of responsibilities is\nsummarized in Table 2.\n\n9\n\nSHUTTLE ET\nSHUT-KE\nORBITER\n\nSHUTTLE SRB\n(ANOTHER ON\nOPPOSITE SIDE\nOF ET)\n\nRTG\n?M-s\n\nFigure 3.

The\nspacecraft has been designed such that playback data can be interleaved with real-time\ndata and transmitted back to Earth during daily contact periods. Data received at the\nMCCC are then processed by a project-unique Ulysses Mission Control System (UMCS)\nand sent to the Data Records System (DRS). Real-time telemetry data will be processed\nimmediately to establish the health of the spacecraft and instruments. The UMCS will\nalso provide information about the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s attitude (with respect to the Earth) and\nenable correction maneuvers to be generated to keep the Earth-pointing spacecraft\nantenna on line. The UMCS will also generate command files for changing science\ninstrument configurations and scheduling report and playback times.\nSpacecraft experiment data, together with spacecraft ephemeris information, will be\ngenerated by the Data Records System (DRS). These data will be supplied to the\nPrincipal Investigators of each scientific experiment in the form of Experiment Data\nRecords (EDR\xe2\x80\x99s) and Supplemental Experiment Data Records (SEDR\xe2\x80\x99s). The EDR\xe2\x80\x99s\nare specific experiment-related\ndata, while the SEDR contains position information not\nreadily available from science and engineering telemetry such as solar system geometries\nand spacecraft orientations.\nIn addition, a Common Data Record (CDR), which pools\ninformation from different experiments, will be prepared and distributed to the\nInvestigators.\n\n15\n\nSPACECRAFI\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSpacecraft Configuration\nOther than its unique trajectory, there are a number of aspects of the mission that make\nUlysses unusual. First, the prime science measurement phase starts 3% years after\nlaunch, when the spacecraft climbs above 70 degrees heliographic latitude. This imposes\na requirement for very high reliability in both spacecraft and payload design. Because\nthe spacecraft will be exposed to a high dose of radiation during the Jupiter fly-by, all\nelectronic components have been specially selected for their radiation resistance.\nMoreover, because Ulysses cannot rely on solar energy to provide electrical power, a\nRadioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) will be used to supply 280 Watts to\npower both spacecraft and instruments.\nUlysses will be spin-stabilized at a rate of approximately 5 rpm. Its high-gain antenna\nwill be permanently pointed towards the Earth by precession maneuvers to adjust the\nattitude approximately every other day throughout the five-year mission. A \xe2\x80\x9cwatchdog\xe2\x80\x9d\nsystem will ensure that the spacecraft points towards the Earth automatically, so that\ncontact is not lost. The telemetry system will operate in the X-band at approximately\n8 GHz, while a low-power 2 GHz S-band transmitter will also be available for radio\nscience investigations and early orbit maneuvers. Uplink communication will be in\nS-band.\nThe spacecraft was designed and built by the STAR Consortium of European Industries\nwith Dornier Systems of Friedrichshafen, West Germany as prime contractor to ESA\n(Figure 7).\nSpacecraft mass properties and balance have been the prime drivers in the spacecraft\ndesign to meet the requirements both for the launch configuration and for the deployed\nboom configuration.\nThe nominal mass of the spacecraft is 366 kg (807 lb) at launch,\nthe on-board scientific instrumentation accounting for 55 kg (120 lb). The body-mounted\nexperiments are located around the periphery on one side of the spacecraft to provide\nthe required fields of view, good EMC shielding, and minimum radiation background\nfrom the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator located on the opposite side of the\nspacecraft. Several sensors are mounted on the radial boom, which is shown in Figure 7\nin a near-stowed position.\nThe spacecraft will nominally be tracked 8 hours per day throughout the mission by the\nNASA Deep Space Network (DSN). Since continuous data coverage is of primary\nscientific importance, the spacecraft has two redundant tape recorders, each having 45.8\niMegabit capacity.

During storage periods data rates of 512, 256, or 128 bits per second can be\nselected.\nProminent characteristics of the spin-stabilized spacecraft are the large diameter (1.55meter) parabolic high gain antenna (HGA) on top of the spacecraft, the Radioisotope\nThermoelectric Generator (RTG), and the 5.5meter radial boom, which provides an\nappropriate electromagnetically\nclean environment for certain experiments. A 72-meter\ntip-to-tip dipole wire boom and an g-meter axial boom serve as electrical antennas for\nthe unified radio and plasma-wave experiment. The body of the spacecraft contains\nengineering subsystems and science instruments with the exception of those experiment\nsensors mounted on the 5.5-meter boom. The internally mounted units are carried on a\nhoneycomb center-panel, which also supports the hydrazine fuel tank for the reaction\ncontrol equipment of the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem. In general, the\nexperiments that are more sensitive to nuclear radiation are mounted on the portion of\nthe spacecraft farthest from the RTG, while the less sensitive subsystems are nearer to it.\n\nUnique Design and Operational\n\nFeatures\n\nInterplanetary missions require a spacecraft designed quite differently from satellites\noperating in Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. At Jupiter, which is about 780 million km (485 million miles)\nfrom the Sun, the intensity of solar radiation is so weak (l/25 that of Earth) that\nphotoelectric cells would never provide enough power, Furthermore, the solar cells\nwould also deteriorate more rapidly because of the harsh radiation environment at\nJupiter. Ulysses will therefore utilize a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)\nto power all the scientific instruments and all the spacecraft subsystems, such as data\nhandling.\nUnder an interagency agreement between the Department of Energy (DOE) and NASA,\nDOE developed and provided RTG power sources (Figures 8 and 9) for both the\nGalileo and the Ulysses spacecraft. Management coordination between DOE and NASA\nwas the responsibility of JPL. The Galileo spacecraft, developed at JPL, utilizes an\nidentical RTG.\nAfter installation of the RTG on the spacecraft at the launch pad, the RTG is initially\nair-cooled to reduce the surface temperature in order to minimize thermal shock before\nwater is introduced to the cooling tubes (the surface temperature is reduced to\napproximately 93 \xe2\x80\x9cC). Water for the cooling is subsequently supplied by an external\nportable cart while the spacecraft is on the launch pad; once the Shuttle bay doors are\nclosed, cooling water is routed through the Shuttle heat exchanger. Prior to spacecraft\ndeployment, the cooling lines are purged and vented with gaseous nitrogen.\n\n18\n\nRTG\nMOUNTING\nFLANGE\n\nHEAT SOURCE\nSUP\xe2\x80\x98PORT\nI\n\nI\n/\n\n\\\nSiGe UNICOUPLE\n\n\\\n\nGENERAL PURPOSE\nHEAT SOURCE\n/\n\n\\\nMIDSPAN HEAT\nSOURCE SUPPORT\n\n\\\n\nALUMINUM OUTER\nSHELL ASSEMBLY\n\nFigure 8.

Very little is known about the fields there\n\n22\n\n(such as their strength) because it is nearly impossible to observe them from the lower\nlatitudes where all earlier spacecraft have flown.\nA pair of magnetometers, each suited to a different purpose, is carried aboard Ulysses to\nmap the heliospheric magnetic field as the spacecraft travels through it. Use of the pair\nof magnetometers will allow the investigators to monitor changes in the magnetic field at\nthe spacecraft. A vector-helium magnetometer will measure slight fields, while near\nJupiter a flux-gate magnetometer will measure the planet\xe2\x80\x99s intense magnetic field. Still\nmore important, the two magnetometers will measure the magnetic fields above the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s poles.\nThe magnetometer team, interested in particle streams riding the solar wind outward\nfrom the Sun, seeks answers to questions such as whether the magnetic field lines near\nthe poles cause clouds of plasma to act differently than they do nearer the equator. For\nexample, the field lines at the poles are expected to arrange themselves nearly parallel to\nthe flow of the solar wind, so the plasma clouds are not kept distinct and separate, as\nthey are at the equator where the field lines are perpendicular to the flow.\nDr. Andre Balogh of Imperial College, London, is the principal investigator on the\nmagnetometer experiment and has provided the flux-gate magnetometer.\nDr. Edward J.\nSmith of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the U.S. project scientist and a co-investigator on\nthe magnetic-fields team, provided the vector-helium magnetometer.\n\nSolar-Wind Plasma lkeriment\nScientists know little about the speed, density, direction, and temperature of plasmas in\nthe solar wind at high latitudes. If the solar wind at the poles originates from coronal\nholes there, it would be free of many of the complications associated with coronal holes\nnear the equator. Near the equator, when quiet regions of the rotating corona pass a\ngiven location, low-energy particles stream forth. When the coronal holes move past the\nsame site, high-speed particles pour out and overtake the slower low-energy particles.\nThus, scientists who have measured the solar wind are perplexed by the alternating slow\nand fast streams. At the poles, however, effects associated with the collisions between\nslow and fast streams may be absent.\nA solar-wind plasma experiment acts like a space version of a weather station and will\nmeasure the solar wind after it leaves the corona. The experiment will detect and\nanalyze particles in the solar wind with the goal of determining variations in the particles\nfrom the equator to the poles. The plasma experiment will determine just how the solar\nwind changes as a function of distance from the Sun and distance from the ecliptic plane.\nThe plasma instrument will measure local changes in the number of particles and in their\nenergy as the solar wind blows past Ulysses while it travels along its flight path.\n\n23\n\nThe plasma instrument\ndiffer between low and\nits place of origin more\ninstrument will observe\nelectron volts.\n\nshould be able to measure how the properties of the solar wind\nhigh latitudes and should be able to trace the solar wind back to\neasily at the poles than at the equator. The solar-wind plasma\nparticles in the energy range from 1 electron volt to 35,000\n\nDr. Samuel J. Bame of the Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\nis principal\n\ninvestigator.\n\nTemperatures in the corona vary depending on the state of the magnetic fields in the\nphotosphere beneath. High temperatures create mixtures of ions that are different at\ndifferent heights. Each mixture is then locked into the solar wind; it does not change as\nit leaves the corona. The solar wind contains electrons, protons, alpha particles (the\nnuclei of helium atoms), and heavy ions such as oxygen, silicon, and iron. The relative\namounts of all those materials are not well understood but are expected to vary with\ndiffering local conditions and changes in the corona where the materials formed. An\nimportant measure is their degree of ionization, a result of differing temperatures at the\nsource.\nA solar-wind ion-composition spectrometer is expected to provide unique information on\nconditions and processes in that region of the corona where the solar wind is accelerated.\nThe instrument will study composition and temperatures of heavy ions in the solar wind\nas they strike the spacecraft. Once scientists have determined these temperatures, they\nshould be able to find the location in the corona of the sources of the solar wind, the\ncoronal heating processes, and the extent and causes of variations in composition of the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nDr. George Gloeckler of the University of Maryland and Dr. Johannes Geiss of the\nUniversity of Bern, Switzerland are coprincipal investigators.\n\nLow-Enemv Ions and Electrons Emeriment\nAn instrument called HI-SCALE (Heliospheric Instrument for Spectral, Composition and\nAnisotropy at Low Energies) will study low-energy interplanetary ions and electrons with\na wide range of energies, from high-energy particles in the solar wind to particles with\nextremely high energies -- the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent of cosmic rays. Scientists hope to\nunderstand the mechanisms that release solar-flare particles and the dynamic phenomena\nthat are associated with the solar cycle\xe2\x80\x99s maximum activity.\nThe instrument will use the flow of high-energy particles from eruptive processes on the\nSun to study structural changes in the corona and in the magnetic field lines. (They can\ndo that because the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s high-energy particles travel paths that reveal the field lines\n\n24\n\ncarried by the solar wind.) The structures are expected to change as the spacecraft flies\never-further from the ecliptic plane. Interactions between the particles and waves that\nmove through the solar wind also may be responsible for the energy imparted to particles\nin the solar wind and therefore could explain their speeds.\nScientists on the HI-SCALE team will also try to measure the composition of low-energy\nnuclei from the Sun both in the ecliptic plane and at high solar latitudes, as these nuclei\nshould give information on the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s composition. The instrument should also provide\nclues about how the masses of individual particles influence their acceleration due to\nelectromagnetic forces.\nDr. Louis Lanzerotti\n\nof Bell Laboratories\n\nEnerneticPartide-Comuosition\n\nis principal\n\ninvestigator.\n\nand Interstellar Gas Exueriment\n\nWhile the high temperatures in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s corona accelerate the solar wind\xe2\x80\x99s low-energy\nparticles, the medium- and higher-energy particles achieve energies that are much too\ngreat to have been caused by such relatively simple heating processes. No one knows\nwhat processes cause the acceleration of the medium- and high-energy particles. In\naddition, once the particles with medium and high energy are accelerated, they appear to\nbe stored temporarily in the corona, to be released sometime later along the magnetic\nfield lines. (Physicists observe solar flares where the particles originate, but they do not\nsee any of the particles arrive at Earth at the time they should.) The structures in the\ncorona where the storage and acceleration processes are believed to occur are apt to\nextend to high solar latitudes during the period of maximum solar activity -- just as\nUlysses is flying over the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s poles.\nThe energetic-particle instrument will detect the particles of medium energy in an effort\nto understand the processes of the coronal-storage phenomenon and how that storage\ndepends on the particles\xe2\x80\x99 energy. The instrument will also study how solar latitude\naffects the paths along which the particles move through the heliosphere.\nThe other experiment that is allied with the energetic-particle detector will search for\nneutral helium -- atoms that have no net electric charge -- coming from the Milky Way.\nInterstellar hydrogen and helium gas exists throughout the Milky Way, perhaps as both a\nremnant and a source of the star-formation process. The solar system moves through\nthat gas as we orbit the center of the galaxy.\nNeutral helium is extremely difficult to detect. However, hydrogen is even more difficult\nto see in the inner heliosphere, as a helium atom is four times more massive and holds\non to its electrons with a stronger force. Since it has no electric charge to trap it in the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field lines, the helium falls directly in toward the Sun, drawn there by\ngravity. The helium atoms therefore penetrate deeper into the solar system (to about\n\n25\n\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s distance) than the hydrogen atoms before they are ionized and carried\noutward again by the solar wind.\nThe interstellar helium can\xe2\x80\x99t be detected until the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s gravity gives it enough speed,\nwhich doesn\xe2\x80\x99t occur until the helium is between 1.2 and 1 astronomical units from the\nSun. Therefore, the helium-detection portion of the experiment will operate only during\nthe first 70 to 100 days of the flight.\nDr. Erhardt Keppler of the Max-Planck-Institut\nfur Aeronomie in West Germany is\nprincipal investigator of the energetic-particle detection experiment. Dr. Helmut\nRosenbauer, also of the Max-Planck-Institut\nfiir Aeronomie, is principal investigator of\nthe interstellar neutral helium experiment.\n\nCosmic-Rw\n\nand Solar-Particle fhperiment\n\nA cosmic-ray and solar-particle investigation will search for particles inbound from other\nregions in the Milky Way galaxy. Team members hope to sample these objects in nearpristine condition, unaltered by the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field lines near the ecliptic plane.\nThe experiment\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to improve our understanding of acceleration and movement of\ncharged particles in interplanetary space -- primarily the cosmic rays that originate\nbeyond the solar system. It will address questions regarding the nature of cosmic rays\nbefore they enter the solar system, how galactic cosmic rays change, and, from measurements of particles not accessible in the plane of the ecliptic, how and where cosmic rays\noriginate, what forces act on them, and how they travel through the Milky Way.\nThe experiment can distinguish between the different elements present in cosmic rays. It\ncan identify such heavy particles as hydrogen nuclei, helium nuclei, oxygen, and nitrogen.\nThe physicists on this team also hope to determine individual isotopes of each element,\nwhich would tell them about how the cosmic rays were created.\nDr. John Simpson of the University\ninvestigator.\n\nof Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Enrico Fermi Institute is principal\n\nUnified Radio and Plasma-Wbve Experiment\nThe Sun is a mighty broadcaster of radio signals that move across the solar system at the\nspeed of light, and high-energy electrons that move outward as the result of solar\neruptions also produce low-frequency waves of energy.\nUlysses\xe2\x80\x99 unified radio and plasma-wave experiment has two objectives:\n\nthe first is to\n\ndeterminethe directionand polarizationof radio sources\nflowing outwardfrom the Sun;\nthe second is a detailed study of waves in the solar wind -- waves associated with local\nvariations in the properties of clouds of plasma that move through the interplanetary\n\n26\n\nmedium. The unified radio and plasma-wave experiment is both a remote-sensing and a\nlocal-measurement instrument. It senses the longer radio frequencies that originate at\ngreat distances and the shorter plasma-wave frequencies as they move past the\nspacecraft.\nScientists on this team, along with colleagues on other teams, are seeking to understand\nthe basic physics of plasmas -- clouds of particles that have lost one or more of their\nelectrons and thus have been electrically charged. Electrons that move with the plasma\ncloud follow magnetic field lines of the heliosphere, emitting electromagnetic waves.\nBoth ions and electrons in streams of plasma interact with the solar wind to create\nplasma waves. Scientists especially want to understand three characteristics of the waves:\ntheir source, how they interact with the solar wind, and how various kinds of waves\ndepend on the medium through which they move.\nDr. R. G. Stone of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Goddard Space Flight Center is principal\n\ninvestigator.\n\nSolar X-raw and Cosmic Gamma-Rav Bursts ExuerimeAt\nIn 1959 scientists discovered that solar flares emit X-rays; in 1973 they discovered\ngamma rays bursting into the solar system intermittently from interstellar space; and in\n1983 X-rays emitting from Jupiter were discovered. Little is known about any of these\nphenomena, and least is known about gamma rays; they do not originate from the Sun\nbut from elsewhere in the galaxy. Scientists have encountered problems explaining the\nperplexing gamma-ray observations. How are the gamma rays produced? What objects\nare responsible for the extremely high-energy gamma rays? Supernovas? Black holes?\nThe physicists have not yet been able to triangulate gamma-ray bursts closely enough to\npinpoint their sources.\nThe solar X-rays and cosmic gamma-ray bursts experiment is intended to provide new\ndata on these perplexing high-energy particles. The solar-flare X-ray portion of the\nexperiment will work in conjunction with spacecraft flying in the ecliptic. The goal is to\ndetermine how the intensity of the bursts varies with their direction.\nObservations of X-rays from the Sun by Ulysses and those by spacecraft in the ecliptic,\nsuch as Galileo, which will be en route to Jupiter, will help to determine the movement\nof electrons within intense solar-flare magnetic fields on the Sun. The physicists of\nUlysses also want to measure how the energy of the solar X-rays differs as the flares\nemit them in different directions.\nGamma-ray bursts are fairly rare events compared with other phenomena that Ulysses\nwill study, but during its mission Ulysses is expected to sense more than 50 per year as\nthey pass through the solar system.\n\n27\n\nDr. Kevin Hurley of the Centre d\xe2\x80\x99Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, France, and\nDr. Michael Sommer of the Max-Planck-Institut\nfiir Extraterrestrische Physik, West\nGermany, are coprincipal investigators.\n\nCosmic Dust Ekperiment\nCosmic dust probably originated in several different ways. Some may be left over from\nthe creation of the solar system. Some has undoubtedly been left behind by comets\nstreaking past the Sun. Still other dust may have come from collisions of great boulders\nin the asteroid belt. Finally, some cosmic dust probably enters into the solar system\nfrom interstellar space.\nDust particles in space are extremely tiny, about the size of the particles in cigarette\nsmoke. Two basic forces act on the dust particles at the same time: gravity and solar\nradiation. Depending on their size, individual particles can be drawn inward toward the\nSun by gravity or forced outward by the pressure of solar radiation. Still other dust\nparticles are just passing through, on their way from interstellar space through the solar\nsystem and out again.\nThe Ulysses dust experiment aims to measure the speed and flight direction of particles.\nIt will measure the electric charges the particles acquire as they fly through the solar\nwind, and it will attempt to determine if the dust exists in greater amounts at higher\nlatitudes than in the ecliptic plane.\nDr. Eberhard Griin of the Max-Planck-Institut\nprincipal investigator.\n\nfur Kernphysik\n\nin West Germany is the\n\nCoronal Soundina Exneriment\nTwice during the Ulysses mission the spacecraft and the Earth will be on opposite sides\nof the Sun. The first such orientation will occur about 10 months after launch; the\nsecond about one year later. During these opportunities scientists will use radio signals\nto and from Ulysses to measure the density of electrons along the path the radio signals\ntake from Earth to the spacecraft and back as they pass the Sun.\nBecause interplanetary space is not a perfect vacuum, the radio signals\xe2\x80\x99 speed will be\nslightly affected by the material they pass through. Therefore the frequency of the\nsignals will change slightly as they pass through the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s corona. Part of that shift is\ncaused by relative motions of the spacecraft and Earth. Yet another part is caused by\nthe electrons in the signals\xe2\x80\x99 path. In addition, irregularities in electron density make the\nradio waves scintillate or \xe2\x80\x9ctwinkle\xe2\x80\x9d just as starlight does, and that scintillation is a\nmeasure of the number of electrons near the corona. What is unique about the\n\n28\n\nmeasurements of Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 radio signals is that they will count the electrons streaming\nfrom a region of the Sun that has never been seen before -- high solar latitudes.\nDr. Hans Volland\n\nof Bonn University\n\nis the principal\n\ninvestigator.\n\nGravitational WavesExperiment\nUlysses may provide evidence in support of Albert Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of gravitation (the\nTheory of General Relativity).\nRelativity predicts the presence of gravitational waves,\nwhich are ripples in Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s space-time caused by matter or mass in motion.\nParticularly strong waves could be produced by cataclysmic events involving vast amounts\nof matter in quasars and the centers of exploding galaxies. An example of such an event\nwould be the collapse into a black hole of matter equivalent to 100 million times the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s mass. Current astronomical observations appear to lend credence to the existence\nof such objects in the centers of galaxies. Gravitational waves would travel out from\nsuch events through space at the speed of light and disturb the position of any object\nthey pass.\n\n29\n\nMISSION SEQUENCES\nThe major mission events are depicted in Table 4. In the first leg of the mission, the\nspacecraft will travel nearly in the plane of the ecliptic to Jupiter. The Jovian\ngravitational field, precisely targeted, will be used to deflect the spacecraft out of the\necliptic plane. After Jupiter swingby, which will occur about February 1992, the\nspacecraft will travel in a heliocentric, out-of-ecliptic orbit with a high heliographic\ninclination.\nIt will pass over the poles of the Sun and will spend a total of at least 150\ndays at 70 degrees above the ecliptic. At maximum heliocentric or solar latitude, the\ndistance from the Sun will be less than 2.3 AU. The subsequent pole-to-pole segment of\nthe trajectory will be traversed relatively quickly, and the second (northern) polar\npassage will occur approximately 12 months after the first.\n\nTABLE 4.

The closing of the\nwindow is based on IUS performance requirements to support the Ulysses\ntarget.\n\n31\n\nAn inertial Upper Stage/Payload Assist Module combination will place the spacecraft on\nan ecliptic transfer orbit to Jupiter (Figure 10). On its outward journey, Ulysses will\nperform interplanetary physics investigations and will search for gravitational waves\nduring two periods when the Earth is directly between the spacecraft and the Sun. Upon\narrival at Jupiter, approximately 16 months after launch, Ulysses will measure the Jovian\nmagnetosphere. Ulysses will then use the massive Jovian gravitational field to deflect\nthe spacecraft trajectory out of the ecliptic into a highly elliptical orbit toward the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nsouth pole, reaching previously uncharted heliographic latitudes. The most intense\nscientific activity will commence with the first polar pass, about three and a half years\nafter launch. As the spacecraft passes through 70 degrees south solar latitude at twice\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s distance from the Sun, Ulysses will \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d the Sun for the first time from all\nlatitudes, including the poles. Ulysses will also study energetic charged particles\noriginating in explosive releases of energy from the Sun, such as solar flares.\nIn response to the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s gravitational pull, Ulysses will arc toward the solar equator and\ncross it at about 1.2 AU. Although scientific investigations will continue throughout this\nperiod, interest will peak again when the spacecraft reaches high northern heliographic\nlatitudes, approximately a year after crossing the Southern Pole. About five years after\nlaunch, Ulysses will have explored the heliosphere at nearly all latitudes, measured\nphenomena over both of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s poles, and investigated interplanetary particles and\nfields. As the spacecraft leaves the region of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s north pole, the mission will end.\n\n32\n\nl\n\nMission Objective:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9890\n\nLaunch\nOtt\n\nFigure 10.

The process has been in place for all NASA missions requiring nuclear power\nsources since the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s and involves approximately 100 individuals from Federal\nagencies, private industry, universities, and the Executive Office of the President (Figure\n11). An essential element of the safety review process is the Interagency Nuclear Safety\nReview Panel (INSRP) that provides an independent safety evaluation to the Office of\nScience and Technology Policy to support their deliberations prior to making a decision\nwheth.er to approve the launch of any mission carrying nuclear materials. The panel\nconsists of agency coordinators from the Department of Defense, the Department of\nEnergy, NASA, and observers from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), as well\nas technical specialists from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA).\nThere are six subpanels,\nwith dozens of members from federal agencies, industry, and universities who review\nsafety analysis reports developed by the DOE.\n\nMISSION\nDEFINlTlON.\nFAILURE\nMODE, AND\nPROBABILITY\nDATA\n(NASA)\n\n+\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\n+\nNPB OESION\nANDTESTOATA\n\nL\n,\n\nOOD\n\n7\n\nPBAR\nUSAR\nFSAR\n\n(2)\n\nSAFETY\n\nEVALUATION\n\n(3)\n\nRESPONSIBLE\n\nMISSION\n\nNASA\n\nOFFICE OF\nSCIENCE\nAN0\nrECHNOLOCiY\nPOLICY\n\n-\n\nPSAIVUSAR\nCOMMENTS\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nA-----------\n\nI PRELIMINARY\nL UPDATED\ni FINAL\n\n+\n_\n\nNASA.\xe2\x80\x98DOE\nPROGRAM\nOFFICE\n\nT-l\n\n(1)\n\n-,\n\n(3)\n\nINDEPENDENT\nANALYSIS\nAND\nTESTS\n(DOE.

Aerospace Nuclear Safety Review Process\n\n35\n\nOFFICE\n\nOF THE\n\nNuclear Safety Analysis\nThree safety analysis reports are developed during the course of a space nuclear power\nproject such as Ulysses. The Safety Analysis Report is prepared by the Department of\nEnergy (DOE). It includes a description of the mission and the nuclear power source, a\nfailure modes analysis, radiological risk assessment, and summaries of test data.\nThe report also provides a description of the final design of the mission and its nuclear\npower sources, radiological safety data including the results of the safety tests, and a risk\nassessment of mission accidents including estimated human and environmental exposures\nto nuclear materials. Draft copies of the Safety Analysis Report are delivered to INSRP\nfor examination by the subpanels, and comments are incorporated into the final version.\nThe Ulysses FSAR was completed in March 1990.\nThe INSRP prepares a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) that assesses and summarizes\nthe FSAR. When the evaluation is completed, the report is presented to the INSRP\ncoordinators for final review. After the SER is published, it is distributed to NASA,\nDOE, and DOD for review. Once the DOE and DOD coordinators have reviewed the\nreport\xe2\x80\x99s contents and analyses, the DOE and DOD agency heads decide whether to\nconcur with or recommend against NASA\xe2\x80\x99s request for launch. If both DOE and DOD\nconcur with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s request, NASA then proceeds to request launch approval from the\nPresident\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Science and Technology Policy. The OSTP Director can either\napprove the launch request or refer it to the President. No launch can take place\nwithout prior approval from either the OSTP Director or the President.\nIn addition to the documents mentioned above, NASA prepares an Environmental\nImpact Statement (EIS) as required by National Environmental Protection Agency\nregulations. The EIS presents an overview of the Ulysses mission, its scientific purpose,\nand the need for taking an action (launch of the Ulysses spacecraft) for which\nenvironmental consequences must be considered. The document discusses alternatives to\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s planned course of action and then describes the potential environmental\nconsequences. The Draft EIS was released for public comment in February 1990.\nResponses to the comments received were incorporated into the Final Environmental\nImpact Statement (FEIS), which was issued in June 1990. After public comments to the\nFEIS were received and considered, the final decision to proceed with the planned\ncourse of action was made by the Associate Administrator, Office of Space Science and\nApplications, and signed in August 1990. The decision is documented in the Ulysses\nRecord of Decision.\n\n36\n\nMISSION\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nThe Ulysses Mission is a joint activity of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration\n(NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) (Figures 12 and 13).\nThe NASA portion of the project is managed under the Flight Programs Branch of the\nSolar System Exploration Division. NASA project management is assigned to the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) at Pasadena, California. The ESA portion of the mission is\nmanaged under the Directorate of Scientific Programmes, ESA Headquarters, Paris,\nFrance. ESA project management resides at the European Space Research and\nTechnology Center (ESTEC) located in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.\nFlight operations\nfor the ULS Mission are conducted under the responsibility of ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Director of\nOperations located at the European Space Operations Center, Darmstadt, Germany.\nThe NASA portion of the project is directed by the Office of Space Science and\nApplications (OSSA) at NASA Headquarters.\nProject management has been assigned by\nNASA to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.\nUnder the terms of the MOU between ESA and NASA, each agency designated a\nproject manager.\n\n37\n\n38\n\ng\n\n-\n\nFigure 13, Ulysses Project Organiz;ltion\n\nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDINQ\n0FFK;E OF SPEClAL NUCLEAR PROJECTS\nOFFICE OF SPACE SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS\nINTERAGENCYAGREEMENT\nPROGRAM APPROVAL DOCUMENT\nMUTUAL INTERFACE DOCUMENT\nJOINT WORKING GROUP\nINTERFACE REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (IRD) CUSTOOIAN\n: MISSION INTEGRATION PANEL (MIP), CO-CHAIRED BY MSFC AND ESA\nI INTEGRATION WORKINQ GROUP (JWG).
