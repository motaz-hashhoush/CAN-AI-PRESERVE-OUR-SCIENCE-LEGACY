Another option is to pulse an accelerating\ngrid negative with respect to the front\nface so as to extract and accelerate positive ions.\n\nTypical parameters of an optimized\ndesign for a basic SSFBS include a ferroelectric-plasma area of 10 cm2, operating\npressure of about 10 -2 torr (about 1.3\nPa), pulse-repetition frequency of 20 Hz,\nelectron or ion current up to 10 A under\nan accelerating pulse of 30-kV amplitude\nand 50-ns duration.\n\nThis work was done by Yoseph Bar-Cohen,\nStewart Sherrit, Xiaoqi Bao, Joshua Felsteiner,\nand Yakov Karsik of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA dusty-plasma apparatus is being investigated as means of accelerating\nnanometer- and micrometer-sized particles. Applications for the dusty-plasma\nparticle accelerators fall into two classes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simulation of a variety of rapidly moving dust particles and micrometeoroids in outer-space environments\nthat include micrometeoroid streams,\ncomet tails, planetary rings, and nebulae and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deposition or implantation of nanoparticles on substrates for diverse industrial\npurposes that could include hardening,\nincreasing thermal insulation, altering\noptical properties, and/or increasing\npermittivities of substrate materials.\nRelative to prior apparatuses used for\nsimilar applications, dusty-plasma particle accelerators offer such potential advantages as smaller size, lower cost, less\ncomplexity, and increased particle flux\ndensities.\nA dusty-plasma particle accelerator\nexploits the fact that an isolated particle\nimmersed in plasma acquires a net electric charge that depends on the relative\nmobilities of electrons and ions. Typically, a particle that is immersed in a\nlow-temperature, partially ionized gas,\nwherein the average kinetic energy of\nelectrons exceeds that of ions, causes\nthe particle to become negatively\ncharged. The particle can then be accelerated by applying an appropriate electric field. A dusty-plasma particle accelerator (see figure) includes a plasma\nsource such as a radio-frequency induction discharge apparatus containing (1)\na shallow cup with a biasable electrode\nto hold the particles to be accelerated\nand (2) a holder for the substrate on\nwhich the particles are to impinge. Depending on the specific design, a pair of\nelectrostatic-acceleration grids between\nthe substrate and discharge plasma can\nbe used to both collimate and further\n\n28\n\nSubstrate\n\nHigh-Energy Microparticle or Nanoparticle Beam\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\n\nAcceleration\nGrids\n\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\nPlasma Source\n\nPlasma\nMicroparticles or\nNanoparticles\n\n(Magnetic Grid)\nCurrent Carry\nRods To Generate\nMagnetic Field To\nFilter Electrons\n(Prevent Electron\nExtraction)\n\nCup\n\nChamber\nBias Plate\n\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\n\nIn a Dusty-Plasma Particle Accelerator, microparticles or nanoparticles in a cup exposed to a plasma\nbecome electrically charged and are then accelerated by applying a pulsed electric field.\n\naccelerate particles exiting the particle\nholder. Once exposed to the discharge\nplasma, the particles in the cup quickly\nacquire a negative charge. Application\nof a negative voltage pulse to the biasable electrode results in the initiation\nof a low-current, high-voltage cathode\nspot. Plasma pressure associated with\nthe cathode spot as well as the large voltage drop at the cathode spot accelerates\nthe charged particles toward the substrate. The ultimate kinetic energy attained by particles exiting the particle\nholder depends in part on the magnitude of the cathode spot sheath potential difference, which is proportional to\n\nthe magnitude of the voltage pulse, and\nthe on the electric charge on the dust.\nThe magnitude of the voltage pulse can\nbe controlled directly, whereas the particle\xe2\x80\x99s electric charge can be controlled\nindirectly by controlling the operating\nparameters of the plasma apparatus.\nThis work was done by John E.
