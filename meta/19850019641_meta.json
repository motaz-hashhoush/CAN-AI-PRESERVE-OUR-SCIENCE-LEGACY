These requirements have yielded higher operating pressures, temperatures, and transient effects as well as markedly increased mechanical vibration and flow-related loads. The difficulty in installation, cost, and potential for destroying an engine severely limited the required instrumentation and measurements to adequately define loads of key components such as turbine blades. Also, accurate analytical methodologies for defining internal flow-related loads are just emerging for problems typically found in rocket engines. The difficulty of obtained measured data and verified analysis methodologies has led to the probabilistic load definition approach.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850019641, "id": "2931185fedd14226866eaba94bcbd0fa", "publicationName": "NASA.
