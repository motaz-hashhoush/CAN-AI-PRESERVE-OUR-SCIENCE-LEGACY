TODAMM can be used in the optimization of dual-arm joint configurations. The task-oriented manipulability measure developed can also be used in the joint configuration optimization of a single arm, providing efficient joint configurations in terms of joint motions and joint torques for the required Cartesian motions and static forces. The dual-arm joint configuration optimization based on TODAMM can be applied to a variety of tasks which require dual-arm cooperation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "5", "submissionId": 19890039432, "issn": "0882-4967", "id": "5d8030d94c03425c8694613f178a4f11", "publicationName": "IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation", "publicationDate": "1989-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
