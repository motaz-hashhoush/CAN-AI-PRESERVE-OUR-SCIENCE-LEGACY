b'Elemental Scanning Devices Authenticate Works of Art\nNASA Technology\n\nW\n\nhat do you think the paper or computer\nscreen you are looking at is made of? Are the\nshoes you are wearing really made of leather?\nIs the table nearby made of wood? How can you be sure?\nFor most people, these questions may sound\nlike useless speculation, because they are largely\ninconsequential to daily life. But knowing the precise\nchemical makeup of spacecraft components is a crucial\npart of quality control and can help ensure a successful\nmission. And learning that\nthe paint on a canvass\nwas produced using\nmodern materials\n\nThe Tracer is the first\nhandheld X-ray fluorescence\n(XRF) scanner that can\ndetect aluminum alloys,\nwhich are used frequently in\nflight hardware.\n\n90\t\n\nConsumer Goods\t\n\ncould be what prevents a museum from spending\n$10 million on a forgery.\nThe truth is that we perform a kind of molecular\nanalysis every time we use our eyes. As light reflects off\nobjects, the photons captured by our eyes get interpreted\nas colors. Of the millions of colors human beings are\ncapable of seeing, all fall within gradations between 1\xe2\x80\x933\nelectron volts (eV). Photons close to 1 eV we see as red,\nphotons close to 3 eV we see as violet, and everything in\nbetween correlates with the rainbow.\nX-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is one way of getting\npast the limitations of human vision. As Bruce Kaiser, a\nscientist and pioneer in XRF technology,\nexplains, \xe2\x80\x9cAn XRF scanner is essentially an expensive flashlight, except\nthat instead of using 1\xe2\x80\x933 eV, it uses\n1,000\xe2\x80\x9340,000 eV.\xe2\x80\x9d The difference\nin range is due to a specialized fluorescent\ntube. Ordinary fluorescent tubes produce\nlight by agitating a gas with electrons; the tube\nin an XRF scanner, by contrast, houses a solid piece\nof rhodium, which is agitated using highly accelerated\nelectrons.\nWith XRF-created light shining on an object, all one\nneeds is a device to interpret the X-ray photons that are\ncoming back\xe2\x80\x94information that conveys the elemental\nstructure of the object being viewed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt works just like\nyour vision, except that instead of seeing colors you\ncan look at the atomic structure and detect elements.\nEvery atom emits a unique color pattern; we just don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave names for them because our eyes cannot see them,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Kaiser.\nThe lighter an element is\xe2\x80\x94that is, the lower its\nnumber on the periodic table\xe2\x80\x94the lower its eV\nrange will be, meaning that returning X-rays will be\nweaker. Conventional XRF scanners typically have no\ntrouble reading elements heavier than calcium, but\nsome materials important to NASA, like aluminum\nand silicon, fall below that threshold and are difficult to\n\ndetect. \xe2\x80\x9cAluminum is really popular with the aerospace\nindustry, but its photon is only 1,470 volts,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kaiser.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t even go through a quarter-inch of air; the air\nstops it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 2001, scientists at Marshall Space Flight Center\nbegan searching for ways to enable easy, accurate, and\nconsistent XRF scanning of aluminum alloys using a\nportable device. Doing so would improve quality control\non a wide range of flight hardware, effectively giving field\ntechnicians an entire materials lab\xe2\x80\x99s worth of tools in a\nsingle, hand-held instrument.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nTo develop XRF capabilities for sensing lighter elements, Marshall partnered with KeyMaster Inc., later\nacquired by Madison, Wisconsin-based Bruker AXS Inc.\nUnder a Space Act Agreement, Kaiser\xe2\x80\x94at the time chief\ntechnology officer of Keymaster\xe2\x80\x94worked with Fred\nSchramm of Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Transfer Office to\ndevelop a system for detecting lighter elements.\nBecause the primary hurdle facing light-element detection was the air between the scanner and its object, NASA\nand KeyMaster created a vacuum chamber that could be\nincorporated into the instrument. During development,\nNASA provided the materials for a prototype and personnel to evaluate the device; KeyMaster contributed its\ntechnical expertise and hosted the project in its facilities.\nThe resulting XRF scanner could easily detect lighter\nelements such as aluminum and silicon; in fact, it could\ndetect any gas, liquid, powder, or solid heavier than neon.\nKeyMaster and NASA filed joint patents on the vacuum\nsystem as well as on some of the other applications of\ntheir research.\nFollowing the patents, the company licensed the\ntechnology and made it commercially available. Says\nKaiser, \xe2\x80\x9cThe partnership was a very fruitful relationship\nand essential to the development of the vacuum\ntechnology for the XRF system. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s participation\nadded credibility when our small company began\nSpinoff 2012\n\nmarketing this new product.\xe2\x80\x9d Bruker AXS now sells the\ntechnology as the Tracer III-SD and Tracer III-V.\n\nBenefits\nThe NASA-improved XRF scanners have been particularly well received in museums, where they are used\nto authenticate artifacts and works of art and assist those\nwho conserve them. Tracer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to detect the elemental composition of an object with a simple, nondestructive\nscan makes it ideal for analyzing precious, rare, or delicate\nitems. Kaiser estimates that more than 600 museums and\nuniversities worldwide now use the device, including such\ninstitutions as the National Archives, the Field Museum\nof Natural History, the Louvre, the National Gallery, and\nthe British Museum.\nOne reason the device is so popular is that experts in\nart history or archeology can easily be taught how to use\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a chemist to operate it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kaiser. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ncan teach anyone how to point the scanner, look at the\ncolor pattern, and figure out what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a practical example of the technology\xe2\x80\x99s impact,\nKaiser cites art authentication: \xe2\x80\x9cI can make something\nlook yellow, but there are a hundred different ways to\nmake something look yellow. Van Gogh only used one. If\na museum is eyeing a newly discovered painting, it might\nbe beautiful, it might have the right style and details,\nbut if the elements in the pigments don\xe2\x80\x99t match what\nVan Gogh used, then you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not his. And yet the\nmuseum was about to spend $2 million on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn addition to authenticating objects, the scanner\nalso assists conservators as they preserve or restore items.\nFor example, a person getting ready to restore a painting can use the scanner to ensure that he or she is using\nthe same pigments found in the painting so that the new\npaint matches it exactly. At other times, museums will\npurposefully select the wrong pigment so that the new\npaint can easily be identified and removed when the work\nis restored at a later date.\nSpinoff 2012 \t\n\nThe expanded capabilities of XRF scanners have\nproven valuable for many other applications outside\nof museums. Tracer scanners have previously been\nprofiled for their impact in the carpet cleaning industry\n(Spinoff 2006), and they are also used to test the\ncomposition of consumer products like food and\nmedication to ensure they are free of contaminants.\n\nWe might not spend much time wondering about the\nelemental composition of the things we use and consume\neach day, but for those who need to find out, this successful NASA-commercial partnership has provided a\nvaluable tool for the job. v\n\nBruker AXS\xe2\x80\x99s XRF scanners quickly and easily identify the elements of an object down to parts-per-million\xe2\x80\x94sufficient to analyze\nNASA spacecraft components or authenticate works of art.\n\nConsumer Goods\t\n\n91\n\n'
