A first step in developing and demonstrating the\nnecessary technologies to support solar-powered exploration could be a 100-kWe-class solar-powered\nplatform in Earth orbit. This platform would utilize advanced technologies in solar power collection and\ngeneration, power management and distribution, thermal management, and electric propulsion. It would\nalso provide a power-rich free-flying platform to demonstrate in space a portfolio of technology flight\nexperiments. This paper presents a preliminary design concept for a 1OO-kWe solar-powered satellite with\nthe capability to use high-powered electric propulsion, and to flight-demonstrate a variety of payload\nexperiments.\n\nBACKGROUND\nSpace solar power (SSP) studies by NASA have\ntaken a stepping stones approach to develop the\ngigawatt systems necessary for cost-effective\ndelivery of power from space.\xe2\x80\x99 These steps start\nwith a 100 kWclass satellite, leading to a 500 kW\nand then a 1 MW-class platform. Later steps\ndevelop a 100 MW bus that could eventually lead\nto a 1-2 GW pilot plant for SSP. Studies have\nshown that a modular approach is cost effective.*\nModular designs include individual laser-powerbeaming satellites that fly in constellations, or that\nare autonomously assembled into larger\nstructures at geosynchronous orbit (GEO). A costeffective approach to launching these modular\nunits is to use existing Earth-to-orbit (ETO) launch\nsystems, in which the modules are dropped into\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) and then the modules\nperform their own orbit transfer to GEO using\nexpendable solar arrays to power solar electric\nthrusters. At GEO, the modules either rendezvous\n\nand are assembled robotically into larger\nplatforms, or are deployed into constellations of\nidentical laser power-beaming satellites.\nExploratinn scenarios r a n\np m p ! q ms&!ar\nsolar-powered units, which self-assemble into\neither solar electric propulsion (SEP) transport\nvehicles or energy-rich infrastructure platforms.\nBoth SSP and solar-powered exploration vehicles\nneed similar technology developments in solar\npower generation (SPG), power management and\ndistribution\n(PMAD),\nmodular\ndeployable\nstructures, and lightweight thermal management\nsystems.\n\nENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR SPACE\nEXPLORATION\nIn expressing his vision for U.S. space\nexploration,\nPresident\nBush\nemphasized\naffordable human and robotic programs, and the\nneed to develop and demonstrate innovative\ntechnologies, including power generation and\n\n1\n\npropuision.\nMr.\nSean\nO\xe2\x80\x99Keefe,\nNASA\nadministrator, re-iterated the need to develop new\ncapabilities in power and propulsion, and to\ndemonstrate these technologies both on the\nground and in Earth orbit. Finally, the Packard\nCommission, directed by the Department of\nDefense to recommend methods for reducing\nprogram cost overruns, stated that technology\ndevelopment needs to focus on lowering the cost\nof the system, and not just increasing\nperformance, and that technologies should be\nsufficiently matured prior to implementation in\nsystems. One of the key threads from these\nvarious sources is that \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced power and\npropulsion technologies should be developed and\ndemonstrated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nrequire power levels of at least 100 kilowatts. A\nhigh-power technology demonstration spacecraft\ncan be used to verify the non-nuclear\ntechnologies required to support these increasing\nsatellite power requirements.\n\na\n\nSolar electric propulsion (SEP) offers multiple\nresponses to these national calls for power and\npropulsion technology development. Solar power\ncollection utilizes freely available solar energy,\nprovides the capability to operate in low Earth\norbits ( 4 , 0 0 0 km) where nuclear power would not\nbe desirable, and has the flexibility to power any\ndesired electric thruster concept. Although they\nhave low thrust-to-weight ratios, electric thrusters\ncouple a high specific impulse (an order of\nmagnitude higher than chemical engines) with the\ncapability to operate for lengthy periods of time,\nresulting in significant total impulse using\nsubstantially lower propellant quantities than\ncurrent chemical engines. SEP provides the\ncapability to support unmanned near-Earth and\nlunar transportation missions (for both equipment\nand propellant), exploration missions to the inner\nplanets, and provide the capability to act as a test\nplatform\nfor\nnuclear\nelectric\npropulsion\n?echn!3!!3gies.The p:in;a;.j disadvantages 0 SEP\n:\nare a low thrust-to-weight ratio and a fairly large\nsolar array area, which results in increased\natmospheric drag at the lower altitudes, potential\nsensitivity to acceleration, and launch vehicle\npackaging issues. Also, the reduced solar\nconstant at the outer planets impacts the\nspacecraft power collection capability.\nCurrent satellite power requirements range from\nless than a kilowatt up to 20 kilowatts. Looking\ninto the future, space-based power needs are\nestimated to reach the 100-kilowatt range in the\n2010 to 2012 timeframe. Fig. 1 shows that\ncommercial satellite power requirements may\nexceed 40 kilowatts by 2010. In addition, spacebased radars and lasers may require 40 to 125\nkilowatts as soon as 2010. For exploration,\nelectric propulsion, electromagnetic accelerators,\nand wireless power transfer technologies will\n\nFig.1: Spacecraft\naccelerating.\n\npower\n\nrequirements\n\nare\n\nPRELIMINARY DESIGN STUDY ASSUMPTIONS\nA primary groundrule was the use of solar energy\nto generate 100 kilowatts (kWs) of electrical\npower under end-of-life conditions. Other\ngroundrules included expendable launch vehicle\n(ELV) launch, a three-year lifetime, and a mission\nthat orbits in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) for two years,\nfollowed by self-transport to mid-Earth-orbit\n(MEO) for a third year of experiment\ndemonstration. Near-term technologies that could\nsupport a manufacturing start in the 2008\ntimeframe were also groundruled, in addition to a\n2000kg payload capability for experiments. To\navoid significant battery weight and solar array\nsizing penalties, high-power payload operation\nwas limited to periods of insolation. A primary\ndesign driver was a high-voltage SPG and PMAD\nsystem that would enable \xe2\x80\x9cdirect drive\xe2\x80\x9c of the\nhigh-voltage electric thrusters, and that would\nminimize heavy power converters at the arrays or\nthe bus. The mission profile included a spacecraft\ntransit of the Van Allen belts for verification of the\nhigh-voltage system in a high radiation\nenvironment. An existing spacecraft bus was\nselected to minimize development risk, and\nmodular concepts were implemented where\nfeasible,\n\nSPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGIES\nThe 100 kW-class technology demonstrator will\nutilize advanced solar power collection and\ngeneration !echno!ogies, power managemefit and\ndistribution, advanced thermal management, and\n\n2\n\nsolar electric propulsion. State-of-the-art solar\nconcentrators, highly efficient multi-junction solar\ncells, integrated thermal management on the\narrays, and innovative deployable structure design\nand packaging make the 100 kW satellite feasible\nfor launch on one existing launch vehicle. Early\nSSP studies showed that a major percentage of\nthe on-orbit mass for power-beaming satellites\nwas from massive power converters at the solar\narrays, at the bus, at the power transmitter, or at\ncombinations of these locations.*\n\nSolar Power Generation\nBased on a study completed by the US\nDepartment of Energy in early 2002, multi-junction\nsolar cells not only have the highest efficiencies,\nbut they also exhibit the highest levels of\nincreased efficiencies in recent years. Some of\nthe most promising are triple-junction cells that\ncan be expected to exceed 30% efficiency by\n2008. Quadruple-junction technology, if available\nin large quantities by 2008, will produce even\nhigher efficiencies, in the mid-thirty percent range.\nSolar concentrator technologies enable smaller\nsolar arrays, which lower system masses and\nstowed volume requirements, and simplify\ndeployment. In addition, solar concentrators\nincrease performance and lower costs due to a\nreduction in the number of solar cells. This study\nhas selected the ENTECH Stretched Lens Array\n(SLA), which has the advantage of passive\nthermal management and a solar concentration of\napproximately eight suns. A key characteristic of\nthese solar concentrators is a solar cell efficiency\nincrease of over 10%.\n\n\'\\P.\\\n\nI\n\nBays finish deployment and latch\nprior to blanket deployment\n\n$\n_.-\n\nMotor starts blanket deployment\n12\n\n---\n\nIO\nMass (MT)\n8\n\nFig. 3: SLASR Deployment\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nis3\n\nTeiescomng\nmag\n\nRigla P a l e l\n\nSLASR\n\nFig. 2: Solar Panel Architecture Comparisons\n\nThis\nstudy traded various solar panel\narchitectures:\nrigid\npanels,\nconcentrating\nphotovoltaic systems, telescoping mast designs,\nand a square-rigger (SR) flexible blanket design.\nFig. 2 provides a comparison of mass, area, and\ncost estimates for these solar array architectures.\nFor reference, ISS solar array performance\nmetrics are shown in the figures in the left bars.\nThe telescoping mast is an ISS design with minor\nimprovements. Cell efficiency estimates for the\ntelescoping mast, rigid panel, and square-rigger\n\nare all based on a mid-thirty-percent, quadruplejunction cells. Mass estimates include PV\nassemblies, harnesses, structure and substrate,\nmechanisms, and tie downs. Area estimates are\nbased on a 110 kW end-of-life design at LEO; the\nareas for the telescoping mast, rigid panel, and\nSLASR are similar due to the same cell efficiency\nand overall area required to capture the solar\nenergy. The SLA with the square-rigger (SLASR)\nstructure provides the lowest mass and lowest\ncost estimates, primarily because its surface is\nsparsely populated by solar cells. The square\nrigger system is based on a standard 2.5m x 5m\nbay, providing a modular unit that can be tailored\nto match satellite power requirements and solar\narray aspect ratios. One of the primary benefits of\nthe square-rigger is the extremely efficient stowed\npackaging capability. Deployment is automated,\nwith the bay structure being deployed first,\nfollowed by the solar-cell-and-stretched-lens\nassembly, as shown in Fig. 3. The SLASR team\nhas plans to fabricate and test a full-scale array in\nthe next few years.\n\nElectric Propulsion\nElectric thrusters are an ideal match for this solarpowered spacecraft design concept, since they\nprovide fairly low thrust levels, which minimize\nsolar array disturbances. Various near-term\nelectric propulsion options have been examined,\nand the two primary candidates are Hall-effect\nthrusters and ion engines, based primarily on their\nrelatively high technology readiness levels.\nTable 1 provides a relative comparison of these\ntwo candidate engines. The Hall-effect thrusters\nhave been selected for the technology\ndemonstrator concep?, based en their highsr\nthrust levels, higher power levels, and lower costs.\nTwo Hall thrusters can be mounted on the rear\nsurface of the spacecraft to provide 100 kW\npropulsion capabilities. NASA Glenn Research\nCenter testing has shown stable performance with\npower levels ranging from 9 to 72 kW, and with no\nevidence of thermal limitation^.^\n\nPower Manaaement and Distribution (PMAD)\nTo achieve higher thrust and specific impulse\nperformance from the Hall thrusters, voltage\nlevels in the 500-600V ranges are needed. Two\nPMAD architectures have been evaluated. The\nfirst architecture baselines a 300V spacecraft bus,\nwhich would require power conditioning at the Hall\nthrusters to elevate the voltage. A second concept\nuses a 600V bus, which would enable "direct\ndrive" capability for the Hall thrusters.\n\nBoth systems have been found to be technically\nfeasible, although both use significantly higher\nvoltages than that used on current spacecraft.\nSome effort will be required in the development of\ncorona detection and mitigation, and the\nqualification of new hardware for the higher\nvoltage levels. However, high-voltage electronics\nis currently at the TRL 5 level. The 600V bus was\nselected for this study concept; the 300V system\ncould be an alternative should the high voltage\nsystem have problems during development.\n\nHALL-EFFECT\nTHRUSTER\n\n915\n\nComplexity\n\nNASA\nEvolutionary\nXenon Thruster\n(NEXT)\n916\n\nUp to 3,300 mN\nUp to 73 kW\n\nUp to 210 mN\nUp to 6 kW\n\n3,200 sec\n62%\n\n4,050sec\n68%\n\n2 thrusters for\n1OOkW\nSimple with few\nmoving parts\n\n16 thrusters for\n1OOkW\nSophisticated\ndesign with\nmany\ncomponents\nHigh\nMore extensive\nUS flight\nexperience\n\nNASA 457M\n\nCandidate\n\nTRL\n(low power I\nhigh power)\nThrust Range\nUnit Power\nCapability\nSpecific Impulse\nThruster\nEfficiency\nIntegration\n\nION ENGINE\n\nI\nI\n\nRelative Cost\ntimes; 4:l\nthrottle\n\nThermal ManaQement\nLarge amounts of power on satellites imply that\nlarge amounts of waste heat will need to be\nmanaged. In order to shunt unused electric power\nfrom the solar arrays, a parasitic load radiator,\ncapable of accommodating over IOOkW, will be\nneeded. However, the radiator can be designed to\nreject heat at significantly higher temperatures\nthan typical spacecraft radiators. An additional\nthermal management system will handle the\ntypical temperature\nranges\nfrom\nPMAD\ncomponents and other spacecraft electronics.\nIntegrated heat rejection techniques using loop\nheat pipes and advanced radiator designs are\nplanned.\n\n4\n\nDESIGN REFERENCE MISSION\nA design reference mission was defined to help\nsize certain subsystems, determine propellant\nneeds, and define subsystem requirements. The\nspacecraft launches from Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC) on an ELV into a 407km, 51.6\' inclination\norbit. The spacecraft maintains this low-Earth orbit\nfor two years to enable ISS interactions, baseline\nspacecraft performance capabilities, and allow\nprimary payload operation. After two years, the\nspacecraft would use its Hall thrusters to raise its\norbit to approximately 15,000km. The slow\ntransition through the inner Van Allen belt would\nverify\nhigh-power, high-voltage spacecraft\noperation in this high radiation environment. The\nspacecraft would maintain this mid-Earth orbit for\napproximately six months for payload operation\nand to compare spacecraft performance against\nthe LEO baseline performance. The spacecraft\nwould then spiral out to Earth escape to complete\nthe mission, transitioning through the outer Van\nAllen belt.\n\nSPACECRAFT BUS\nAn existing flight-proven satellite bus has been\nselected for this concept study, to leverage\nexisting structure and subsystems.\n\nSolar Array Sizing\nTo size the solar arrays for radiation degradation,\navailable data for triple-junction cells was used to\nestimate the temperature-based efficiencies of\nquadruple-junction cells in the ME0 environment.\nFor the triple-junction cells, over 340 W/m2 will be\navailable under end-of-life conditions. In order to\nprovide -100 kW s! EOL, apprcxirnately 300\nsquare meters of solar array area is required.\nThis mission requires additional solar cell\nshielding due to the high-voltage application and\nthe radiation environment of the Van Allen belts.\nThe mass of this additional insulation is partially\noffset by the low-mass SLA concentrator\ntechnology and its decreased solar cell count. For\na lOOkW delivery requirement, the mass of a\nplanar array would be approximately triple the\nmass of an SLA system.\nTwo 150 m2 solar arrays, each with twelve bays,\nis shown on the technology demonstrator concept\nin Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4: Technology Demonstrator Concept with\nDeployed Solar Arrays\n\nElectric Propulsion System Accommodation\nThe spacecraft bus originally included a chemical\nmain engine and bi-propellant tanks, which have\nbeen removed in the concept and replaced by four\n50kW Hall thrusters and pressurized Xenon tanks.\nAfter trades, thruster gimbaling has been selected\nfor thrust vector control. The single mounting plate\nof the aft end of the spacecraft would provide twoaxis gimbal capability.\nAttitude Control System Assessment\nIn addition to existing reaction wheels and star\ntrackers, the spacecraft bus attitude control\nsystem concept will add small girnbaled electric\nthrusters on the spacecraft sides for drag makeup and momentum management.\nTwo-axis\nsteering will be required for the large solar panels,\nand solar array pointing on the order of one\ndegree will be required during both normal\noperations and orbit adjust maneuvers.\nFigs. 5 and 6 show the spacecraft orbit attitudes.\nFig. 5 shows the operational attitude, in which the\npayload is Earth-oriented in an local vertical, local\nhorizontal attitude. Fig. 6 is the orbit adjust\nattitude, in which the spacecraft has been yawed\nninety degrees to align the Hall thrusters with the\nvelocity vector. The spacecraft is steered using\nthrust vectoring, while the solar arrays remain\ninertially fixed with respect to the sun.\nDue to the addition of larger solar arrays, the\nmodified spacecraft moments and products of\ninertia have been estimated, using masses from\nthe original bus. Analysis has shown that the\ninertias and flexible body modes for the modified\nspacecraft are close enough to the heritage\nspacecraft to provide confidence in the use of\nexisting control bandwidths. Transient responses\nto Hall-thruster impulses have been modeled,\n\n5\n\nusing a total thrust at 33% higher than anticipated\nthrusts, and a one-inch center-of-gravity offset.\nMaximum responses of the solar array to thruster\nimpulses are significantly less than the onedegree requirement. Based on these top-level\nassessments, the modified attitude control system\nmeets the requirements for the technology\ndemonstrator with the SLASR arrays.\n\nhigh-power, high-voltage architecture provide\nlarge heat loads that must be accommodated.\nDepending on the primary payload needs, a\nseries boost converter could be eliminated from\nthis architecture, reducing the mass by\napproximately 60 kg, and reducing the heat load\nby 1.7kW.\n\nSdar array driver and posittoner\nmaintain solar array perpendicular\nto solar vector\n\n//\n\ni\n\n/\xe2\x80\x98\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nSpacecraft Heat Rejection ( k W\n\n~\n\nSmall gimballed ektric thrusters\nonsideofspacwaftprovidedrag\nmake-up capability\n\nFig. 5: On-Orbit Attitude\n\nmaintain solar amy perpendlcular\nto solar vectw\n\nn\n\nFig. 7: Parasitic Load Radiator Sizing\n\nThermal Radiator Sizing\nThe current spacecraft design has extensive\nexternal exposed area for larger radiators. One of\nthe primary impacts of the high-power architecture\nis the addition of a high-temperature parasitic load\nradiator, to shunt unused solar array power that\ncould be as high as IlOkW. As shown in Fig. 7,\nsignificant area improvements are obtained by\noperating the radiator at 1OOO\xc2\xb0F. An additional\nbenefit of such a high-temperature radiator is that\nthis panel can be located on the sun-facing side of\nthe spacecraft. The parasitic load radiator area\nhas been estimated at 63 ft2; an illustration of this\nradiator on the bus is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nthrust vectoring while wings\nremain inertially fixed\n\nFig. 6 : Orbit-Raising Attitude\n\nPMAD Assessment\nThe spacecraft concept will use high-voltage\nSLASR arrays and a 600V main power system to\nprovide \xe2\x80\x9cdirect drive\xe2\x80\x9d capability to the Hall\nthrusters. However, the spacecraft subsystems\nrequire 100Vdc. Existing batteries will be replaced\nwith lithium ion batteries. A top-level sizing\nanalysis of the PMAD system has been done,\nresulting in approximately 1000 kg mass increase\nand a volume increase of 0.9 m3. In addition,\nsignificant electrical losses associated with this\n\nFig. 8: Parasitic Load Radiator on Spacecraft Bus\nIn addition to the parasitic load radiator, additional\nradiators will be necessary to accommodate the\nincreased thermal load from the high-power\n\n6\n\nPMAD components. These estimates range from\n5 to almost 7kW; the elimination of the series\nboost converter could save 1.7kW. A fixed\nradiator on the spacecraft face opposite the\nparasitic load radiator could accommodate 1SkW,\nrequiring the addition of deployable radiators\nmounted at the spacecraft corners. These doublesided deployable radiators have been sized at 60\nf? each.\n\nIn-Space Optical\n\nTrajectory Analysis and Propellant Needs\nTrajectory analyses have determined propellant\nquantities and trip times required to complete the\nplanned mission profile. The burn from the initial\nlow-Earth orbit at ISS altitudes to mid-Earth orbit\n(MEO) at 15,000 km requires 85 days and 900 kg\nof propellant. The final orbit-adjust from ME0 to\nEarth escape (906,378\nkm) requires 50 days and\n750 kg of propellant.\nSpacecraft Mass Summary\nThe spacecraft mass is estimated in Table 2. The\ntotal liftoff mass for the technology demonstrator,\nincluding payload, is 7000 kg.\nFig. 9: Several technology experiment payload\ncandidates\n\nPRIMARY PAYLOAD OPTIONS\nSeveral high-power technology experiments\nwould be suitable as a primary or secondary\npayload\nfor\nthe\nhigh-power\ntechnology\ndemonstration\nspacecraft.\nThese\ninclude\nadvanced communications applications, wireless\npower transmission, space-based radar or laser\napplications, energy storage, and on-orbit\npropellant production and storage.

There\nare several laser communications efforts in\nprogress (NASA, ESA, and AFRL). ESA flew\nSILEX in 1998 on SPOT 4, which pmtvided data\nrates of 50 Mbps. New systems being designed\nby JPL have significantly higher data rates and\nwill require flight-demonstration in the 2007\ntimeframe. Although the input power requirements\nare fairly low, higher power transmitters would\nallow larger ground footprints, which would relax\npointing requirements. However, high-power\ntransmitters\nrequire\ndevelopment\nand\nqualification. On the RF side, again there are\nmultiple advanced RF communications efforts in\nprogress by NASA, ESA, and AFRL. Goddard\nSpace Flight Center recently completed a\nspacecraft crosslink study that concluded Ka-band\n(22-27.5 Ghz) is the preferred band for\nintersatellite communications. In addition, the\nlatest three TDRSS satellites incorporated Kaband for high data rates in the 800 Mbps range.\nPower requirements for TV downlink are typically\nless than 10 kilowatts, but higher power\ntransmitters would allow smaller and more\n\n7\n\n5\n\ncompact ground-based receivers. As with higherpower laser transmitters, these RF transmitters\nwill require development and qualification.\n\nWireless Power Transmission\nPlacing this high-power technology demonstration\nsatellite in ISS orbit provides the opportunity to\ninteract with ISS. A wireless power transmission\n(WPT) experiment would be ideally suited for this\napplication. A laser unit could be mounted on the\nExposed Facility of the Japanese Experiment\nModule (JEM-EF), and power can be optically\ntransmitted to the technology demonstration\nspacecraft. infrared sensors on the ISS-based\nlaser module would image the heated edge of the\nsatellite photovoltaic array and aid pointing to this\ntarget. An additional WPT experiment could be\nmounted on the spacecraft primary deck, and\ncould\ndemonstrate space-to-ground\nWPT\ncapability. This technology experiment would\nprovide key demonstrations of space-to-space\nand space-to-ground technologies for Space Solar\nPower.\nSpace-based Radar Aoplications\nSpace-based radars would be suitable as primary\npayloads for\nthe high-power technology\ndemonstration spacecraft. A 100-kilowatt radar\nsystem would significantly increase surveillance\nrates and target resolution. In addition, higher\npower permits a higher altitude orbit, which\nprovides\nincreased\ncoverage,\nenhanced\nsurvivability, and lower constellation costs. Higher\nsurveillance rates from this primary experiment\nwould work well with the high bandwidth data links\nthat could be provided by an advanced\ncommunication system experiment as a\nsecondary pay!mc!.\nEnerrrv Storage\nAdvanced energy storage hardware can be\ndemonstrated on this high-power demonstration\nspacecraft as a means of facilitating continuous\npayload operation. Significant levels of energy will\nneed to be stored during periods of insolation to\nenable payload operation during the eclipse\nportion of the orbit. Two primary energy storage\nmethods to be considered are batteries and\nflywheels.\nAdvanced Batteries\nAdvanced batteries offer increased energy\ndensities (specific energy) and also permit greater\ndepth of discharge. ISS is currently using nickelhydrogen batteries, which have a specific energy\nof approximately 50 watts per kilogram and\ndepths of discharge in the 35% range. Lithium ion\n\nand lithium polymer batteries have specific\nenergies of 100 watts per kilogram and can\naccommodate a 90% depth of discharge. The\nproposed high-power spacecraft would provide an\nideal technology platform for advanced energy\nstorage hardware.\nFlwheels\nAdvanced aerospace flywheels store energy more\nefficiently that rechargeable chemical batteries. In\naddition, they offer improvements in satellite\nattitude control over control moment gyros\n(CMGs) and reaction control wheels. Electricity\npowers a motor that spins a flywheel, and the\nflywheel stores energy mechanically, speeding up\nas it accumulates energy, and slowing down as it\ndelivers energy to a load. The decrease in\nmechanical energy is converted back into\nelectricity by a generator. The technology\nspacecraft would provide an ideal onboard energy\nstorage testbed.\n\nOn-Orbit Propellant Production and Storage\nThis high-power technology testbed can provide a\nplatform to produce and store cryogenic\npropellants. In addition, this platform can be used\nto demonstrate autonomous fluid transfer\ntechniques. With the addition of energy, water can\nbe broken down by electrolysis to its constituent\nelements, hydrogen and oxygen. The high-power\nplatform provides an abundance of energy to\naccomplish electrolysis. Once the gaseous\nhydrogen and oxygen are formed, they can be\ncooled to cryogenic temperatures and stored as\nliquids. These liquids can then be maintained in\ncryogenic dewars demonstrating the latest\nadvances in vapor-cooled shields. Long-term\nci-pgen storage is an eiiabiing iecnnoiogy for\nreusable in-space transportation systems. These\ndemonstrations will allow assessments of the\nthermal leak paths and lead to improved dewar\ndesigns. In addition, critical demonstrations of\nautonomous cryogenic fluid transfer can be\nconsidered. Reusable in-space transportation\nsystems will be heavily reliant on fuel depots to\nreplenish their cryogenic propellants.\nSUMMARY\nA 100kW-class technology demonstrator concept\nhas been developed in this study. Technical\nchallenges include insulation on the high-voltage\nsolar arrays, design and qualification of the highvoltage PMAD components, design of highvoltage power-conducting slip rings, and\nsubstantial radiators to accommodate large\namounts of waste heat.\n\n8\n\nPreliminary design and top-level analyses have\nshown the feasibility of developing and building\nthis spacecraft in the 2008 timeframe.
