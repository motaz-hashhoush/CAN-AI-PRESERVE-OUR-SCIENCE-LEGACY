The emphasis of the research described herein is on meeting the aggressive near- and mid-term\nnational goals for reducing aircraft noise emissions, which NASA internal studies have shown to be\nfeasible using noise reduction technologies currently being developed in-house or in partnership with\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s industry and academic partners. While NASA has an active research effort in airframe noise\nreduction, this overview focuses on propulsion noise reduction only.\n\nIntroduction\nReducing aircraft noise emissions is an important part of the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of\ncommercial aviation on the environment. The anticipated growth of the commercial air traffic in the next\ntwo decades (forecast (Ref. 1) shown in Fig. 1) calls for the development of low-noise aircraft that can\noffset the projected increase in the community noise exposure. To address this challenge, NASA is\npursuing aggressive aircraft noise reduction goals as part of a comprehensive set of national aeronautics\ngoals shown in Table 1. The environmental goals can be traced to the National Aeronautics Research and\nDevelopment Plan, which was approved in December of 2007 (Ref. 2). The designations \xe2\x80\x9cN+1,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cN+2,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cN+3\xe2\x80\x9d denote three successive aircraft generations beyond the current one in service today. NASA is\nconducting research across all three aircraft generations.\nClearly, meeting these noise goals requires significant reductions in the level of noise emissions from\nfuture aircraft compared to aircraft flying today. To highlight the magnitude of the challenge, Figure 2\nshows the N+1 and N+2 noise goals in relation to the measured average noise level margin for a number\nof representative past and present generation commercial aircraft. Margin is the difference between the\nnoise level that an aircraft generates at a given certification point and the level of allowable noise set by\nthe noise regulation at that point, which is a function of the aircraft weight. Note that, since the national\nnoise goals are expressed in terms of the cumulative margin (i.e., the sum of the margins at approach,\nflyover, and lateral certification points), to plot them on this graph, the average margin was taken to be\none third of the cumulative margin.\nThe dramatic change required to meet these goals is the motivation for the aircraft noise research that\nNASA has been conducting over the last five years. In fact, the Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) Project and,\nmore recently, the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project have been funding fundamental\nand system level research in low-noise aircraft concepts and noise reduction technologies that could meet\nthese aggressive goals for the future subsonic transport aircraft. 1 Ultimately, the main objective of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s aircraft noise reduction research is to provide a portfolio of low-noise technologies that do not\ncompromise the other performance aspects of an aircraft.\nAn early outcome of this research campaign was two detailed NASA system noise studies on the\nfeasibility of the N+1 and N+2 noise goals incorporating technologies currently being developed at\nNASA. In the first study, described in Reference 3, it is shown that a single aisle aircraft (see Fig. 3(a))\ncomparable to the Boeing 737-800, with advanced technology engines, could achieve a cumulative noise\n1\n\nThe SFW Project is part of the Fundamentals Aeronautics Program and the ERA Project is part of the Integrated\nSystems Research Program.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n1\n\nmargin that is 29 EPNdB below Stage 4. This means that it should be possible to close the gap with the\nN+1 noise goal with additional improvements in technology. Finally, it should be noted that this airplane\nwas designed as a noise-optimized solution in the design trade space.\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94U.S. Commercial Air Carriers\xe2\x80\x94System Enplanements: Fiscal\nYears 2010 to 2031.\n\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94U.S. NATIONAL AERONAUTICS GOALS FOR SUBSONIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT\nTechnology generations\n(technology readiness level: 4 to 6)\nTechnology benefitsa\nN+1 (2015)\nN+2 (2020b)\nN+3 (2025)\nNoise\n(cumulative margin rel. to Stage 4)\nLTO NOx emissions\n(rel. to CAEP 6)\nCruise NOx emissions\n(rel. to 2005 best in class)\nAircraft fuel/energy consumptionc\n(rel. to 2005 best in class)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9332 dB\n\n\xe2\x80\x9342 dB\n\n\xe2\x80\x9371 dB\n\n\xe2\x80\x9360%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9375%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9380%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9355%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9370%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9380%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9333%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9350%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9360%\n\na\n\nProjected benefits once technologies are matured and implemented by industry.

Noise margins for only a few\nrepresentative aircraft in various classes are plotted. The trend line is for illustrative purposes and\nis only meant to show the general direction of change. The N+1 and N+2 noise goals are also\nplotted by assuming that the average margin is one third of the cumulative margin.\n\nIn the second study, summarized in References 4 and 5, a detailed noise assessment of a twin-engine\nhybrid wing body aircraft (see Fig. 3(b)) showed that such a plane could achieve the N+2 noise goal with\na cumulative noise margin that is 42.4 EPNdB below Stage 4. About half of this is attributable to the\nbasic low-noise design of the hybrid wing body airframe with baseline engines and the rest is associated\nwith the add-on technologies and advantageous propulsion airframe integration. This airplane was\nassumed to have the same engines and was sized for the same mission as the Boeing 777. The fact that the\nengines considered in the study are conventional, current generation engines suggests that an\nunconventional configuration like the hybrid wing body introduces a new paradigm in the way quiet\naircraft of the future could be designed.\nFeasibility of the N+3 noise goal was addressed as part of studies funded by the SFW Project and\ncarried out by teams of industry and academic partners who were asked to address simultaneously all N+3\nenvironmental and performance goals listed in Table 1 (Refs. 6 to 10). None of these studies produced an\naircraft concept that could meet the N+3 noise goal, but many interesting ideas were generated that could\nprovide guidance for future work. An example of an N+3 aircraft concept developed under these studies\nis dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-bubble\xe2\x80\x9d which was produced by a team led by MIT (see Fig. 3(c)). This aircraft is\ncomparable to the Boeing 737-800 and is predicted to achieve a cumulative noise margin of 60 EPNdB\nbelow Stage 4. Clearly, more research is necessary to close the gap with the N+3 noise goal. It should be\nnoted that a previous study, conducted by the Cambridge-MIT Institute, produced the conceptual design\nfor an aircraft called SAX-40, which was predicted to achieve a cumulative noise margin of 75 EPNdB\nbelow Stage 4 (Ref. 11). However, this was achieved by ignoring some of the current certification rules\nlike glide slope at approach and the landing threshold.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Notional aircraft developed in N+1, N+2, and N+3 studies. Shown in panel (a) is the N+1 study\nconcept aircraft; a conventional single aisle aircraft that is predicted to come very close to meeting the N+1\nnoise goal. In panel (b) is the N+2 study concept aircraft, which is predicted to meet the N+2 noise goal. Panel\n(c) depicts an N+3 concept aircrafts, called \xe2\x80\x9cdouble bubble\xe2\x80\x9d, developed by a team headed by MIT. Like other\nconcepts developed under N+3 NASA funded studies (see Refs. 6 to 10), it does not meet the N+3 noise goal.\n\nWhere applicable, the N+1, N+2, and N+3 studies benefited from ideas and technologies that are\nbeing developed by NASA to make the quiet aircraft of the future possible. These technologies\nencompass both airframe and engine noise reduction, but since engine noise is the major contributor to\nthe overall noise produced by an aircraft under most operating conditions, the focus of this paper is on the\nNASA propulsion noise reduction research. This research is comprised of work conducted at NASA as\nwell as sponsored work carried out in partnership with industry and academic partners under the\nsponsorship of the SFW and ERA projects.\n\nEngine Noise Reduction\nFundamentally, there are three approaches for reducing aircraft propulsion noise: advantageous\nchanges to the engine cycle, application of engine noise reduction technology, and judicious integration of\nthe propulsion system with the airframe to prevent (i.e., shield) some or most of the engine noise from\npropagating to the community below. Currently, NASA has active research efforts in all three areas. The\nremainder of the paper is devoted to outlining these efforts.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n4\n\nEngine Cycle Benefits\nChanges to the engine cycle can have a significant influence on engine noise emissions. One of the\nmost dramatic ways to reduce the noise output of an engine is to increase its bypass ratio. 2 In fact, it has\nbeen known that increasing the engine bypass ratio, which is typically accompanied by reductions in the\nfan tip speed and bypass jet exhaust velocity, can noticeably reduce the strength of two principal sources\nof engine noise, namely, the fan and jet sources (Ref. 12). Figure 4 shows the theoretical reductions in the\nengine noise output as the bypass ratio is increased. 3 Of course, nacelle drag considerations, weight\npenalty, and the availability of the liner treatment area place practical limits on how large the bypass ratio\nof a turbofan engine can actually be.\nHowever, the full potential of the design trade space remains untapped, so there is still room for\nimprovement. For example, the largest bypass ratio engines in service today (i.e., the General Electric\nGE-90 and Rolls-Royce Trent 1000) have bypass ratios in the range 9 to 10. Judging from Figure 4, there\nis still significant noise reduction potential to be exploited by increasing the bypass ratios beyond 10. In\nfact, the notional engine considered in the NASA N+1 noise study described in Reference 3 has a bypass\nratio of 16. The fan noise model for that engine was developed based on the wind tunnel data acquired in\na series of NASA and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) tests of an ultra-high bypass cycle fan concept called the\nAdvanced Ducted Propulsor (ADP) which has a bypass ratio of 13.3. The ratios beyond 12 are sometimes\nreferred to as the ultra-high bypass (UHB). The ADP tests (Refs. 13 to 18) were conducted between 1993\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Reduction of engine noise level as the bypass ratio\nincreases. The reference (i.e., 0 EPNdB) is the noise level for a\nturbojet for which the bypass ratio is zero. The indicated\nranges of bypass ratios for the ultra-high bypass ratio (UHBR)\nturbofans and open rotors shown here are notional. This graph\nis based on the information in Reference 12.\n\n2\n\nBypass ratio is the fan bypass mass flow rate divided by the core mass flow rate.\nThe increase in the bypass ratio could potentially come at the expense of an increase in core noise (principally,\ncompressor and turbine noise), but the overall noise reductions at present outweigh this potential penalty.\n\n3\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n5\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94NASA/P&W 22-in. scale model Geared Turbofan\n(GTF) rig installed in the NASA 9- by 15-ft Low Speed\nAcoustic Wind Tunnel. Test results confirmed the acoustic\nbenefits of ultra-high bypass ratio cycles.\n\nand 1997 and laid the foundation for future work (Ref. 19). Based on the knowledge gained from these\ntests, NASA and P&W demonstrated the significant acoustic benefits of a modern UHB fan design called\nthe Geared Turbofan (GTF) in 22-in. model scale tests in the NASA 9- by 15-ft Low Speed Acoustic\nWind Tunnel (see Fig. 5). P&W subsequently carried out static tests of a full-scale GTF engine\ndemonstrator convincingly proving its lower noise emissions compared with the current turbofans in its\nthrust class. Noise estimates based on the wind tunnel and static engine test data indicate that an aircraft\nwith GTF engines can achieve a cumulative noise margin that is as much as 20 EPNdB below Stage 4\n(Ref. 20).\nClearly, the GTF test results have shown the significant potential of the ultra-high bypass ratio\nturbofan technology in reducing aircraft engine noise. In follow up work to the original GTF research,\nNASA and P&W are cooperatively working towards developing the second generation GTF fan design to\nfurther improve its aerodynamic performance margins while maintaining its noise margin (Ref. 21).\n\nFan Noise Reduction Technology\nDespite its significant impact on engine noise, cycle change alone will not suffice in achieving the\nchallenging noise reduction goals. Case in point is the NASA N+1 noise study in which cycle change is\nestimated to provide roughly two-thirds of the overall noise margin benefits. To reduce engine noise\nfurther, a suite of component noise reduction technologies must also be integrated into the design of the\nengine. These technologies target either the source of the noise itself by reducing its strength, or mitigate\nits radiation inside the engine nacelle by absorbing the noise. Under the SFW and ERA projects, a number\nof turbofan noise reduction technologies are being pursued that complement the acoustic benefits of the\nultra-high bypass cycle. Some of these technologies are depicted in the sketch in Figure 6. These include\nOver-The-Rotor treatment, which is aimed at reducing the noise from the fan rotor; Soft Vane, which is\ndesigned to target rotor-stator interaction noise; and Active Liners, which reduce both inlet and exhaust\nradiated noise before it reaches the engine duct terminations.\nThese technologies, which are currently at various stages of development and maturity, will be\ndescribed briefly in the next few paragraphs.\nOver-The-Rotor (OTR) fan casing treatment is designed to reduce the noise associated with the fan\nrotor. The photo collage in Figure 7 depicts the OTR treatment and how it is packaged and integrated into\na fan stage. The foam metal, used in the construction of the OTR treatment, is a porous metal (e.g.,\ncobalt), or an alloy (e.g., iron-chromium-aluminum), that dissipates the acoustic energy of the sound\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n6\n\nwaves that penetrate into it. Its density, porosity, and depth can be tailored to specific applications. The\nfoam metal is formed into a fan casing ring or spool piece. The interior face of the fan casing ring is then\ncovered by a porous sheet made of RenShape board as shown in the bottom right inset picture. The\nRenShape board allows the sound waves to pass through to the foam metal underneath while at the same\ntime it provides a smooth flow surface as part of the nacelle interior. The panel on the bottom left shows\nthe completed OTR fan casing spool piece integrated into the fan nacelle. It is worth mentioning that,\nultimately, OTR could have dual use both as an acoustic treatment and as part of the fan containment\nstructure.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Three promising fan noise reduction technologies;\nOver-The-Rotor treatment, Soft Vane, and Active Liners are\nshown installed in an UHB fan nacelle.\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Over-The-Rotor fan noise reduction concept and its\npackaging. The foam metal is formed into the fan casing ring, is\ncovered with the RenShape board porous sheet, and is integrated\ninto the fan case. This figure shows the first generation\nimplementation of the concept.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n7\n\nA first generation OTR designed for a realistic fan was tested in the NASA 9- by 15-ft Low Speed\nAcoustic Wind Tunnel using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s 22-in. ADP ultra-high bypass fan rig. Figure 8 shows a typical\nresult (Refs. 22 and 23) where the change relative to the hardwall configuration in the measured\nbroadband sound pressure level (\xe2\x88\x86SPL) is plotted as function of the model scale frequency and sideline\nangle. Negative levels (blue) represent reduction in SPL. The results clearly show that this\nimplementation of OTR increased noise at frequencies between 1 and 5 kHz. The cause was traced to an\nunanticipated aerodynamic behavior of this implementation of OTR concept. The cyclic pressure\nfluctuation at the boundary of the treatment due to the passage of the rotor blades created local high speed\njets of air in and out of the treatment generating measurable extraneous noise and in the process probably\nmasking any potential noise reduction benefits of the technology.\nTo correct this problem, a second generation design is being developed to eliminate the possibility of\nthis aerodynamically driven \xe2\x80\x9cpumping\xe2\x80\x9d action at the surface of the treatment. Rather than a porous\nmaterial, in the new design a dense arrangement of individual small-diameter holes (i.e., channels) are\ndrilled into a solid fan case ring. These channels serve as Helmholtz resonators and act to dissipate the\nincident acoustic energy. The channels are independent and do not communicate with each other. This\nfeature, combined with the small diameter of the channels, should prevent any aerodynamic motion at the\nsurface. As before there will be a porous cover sheet over the case ring.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoft\xe2\x80\x9d vane (SV) is a noise mitigation concept designed to reduce the noise associated with the\ninteraction of the fan rotor wakes with the outlet guide vanes in a turbofan engine. This is the so-called\nrotor-stator interaction noise, which is a major contributor to engine noise for a modern turbofan\nespecially an ultra-high bypass one. The collage in Figure 9 shows the SV concept and how it is packaged\nand integrated into a fan stage. SV is a hollow vane (see top left panel) that has several internal chambers,\nor Helmholtz resonators, each of which is sized to mitigate a particular frequency of the vane surface\nunsteady pressure spectrum. In this particular realization of the SV concept, the chambers run the span of\nthe vane and extend chordwise from 5 percent of the leading edge to 40 percent. The chambers can\ncommunicate with the external environment on the suction side of the vane through a perforated surface\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Shown is typical result for the first generation\nimplementation of the Over-The-Rotor treatment. Negative \xe2\x88\x86SPL\n(blue) indicates a reduction in noise. Over a wide range of sideline\nangles and in the frequency range of 1 to 5 kHz, this\nimplementation of the OTR concept actually created noise instead\nof abating it.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n8\n\nas shown in the upper left panel of Figure 9. The exposed surface is then covered by a felt metal sheet,\nwhich allows the sound waves to pass through into the internal cavities, but not the air flow. The\ncompleted stator vane assembly is shown installed in fan rig in the bottom left panel.\nA first generation SV design designed for a realistic fan was tested in the NASA 9- by 15-ft Low\nSpeed Acoustic Wind Tunnel using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s 22-in. ADP ultra-high bypass fan rig. A typical test result\n(Refs. 22 and 23) is shown in Figure 10 which shows that, over a wide range of frequencies, the radiated\nbroadband noise to the sideline was reduced by an average of 1 dB (as before blue represent reduction).\nThis is half of the target reduction, but it nonetheless proved the feasibility of the Soft Vane concept for\nrealistic fan stages. It should be noted that the impact of this implementation of Soft Vane on the\naerodynamic performance of the fan stage was small and caused less than 0.5 percent of thrust loss.\nTo achieve the full potential of the Soft Vane technology, a second generation design is being\ndeveloped with the aim of improving the acoustic performance while reducing the aerodynamic penalty.\nThe new idea for the second generation Soft Vane is the use of small-diameter channels that need not be\nstraight. This provides greater flexibility for the location of the channels within the vane as well as\nincreases the number of channels that can be incorporated into the design thus providing for greater\nfrequency range of effectiveness.\nUse of liners has traditionally been the principal way that the noise generated inside an aircraft engine\nis mitigated. Liners are integrated into all commercial engines in service today and will certainly be\nintegrated into future engines as well. Therefore, there continues to be a critical need for the development\nof more effective liners. Nearly all conventional liners in use today are passive and are designed to target\na specific frequency, or frequency range, and are typically more effective the larger the treatment area\navailable. However, with the emergence of UHB engines, for which reducing the nacelle length and\nthickness is paramount if the nacelle drag and weight are to be controlled, the shrinking liner treatment\narea makes the use of conventional liners somewhat problematic. Complicating matters further is that a\nshorter nacelle means the inflow into the engine is likely to be more distorted during takeoff and landing\noperations resulting in more transient acoustic behavior, which makes designing an optimum passive liner\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Soft Vane fan noise reduction concept and its packaging.\nThe hollow vanes internal chambers are tuned to a range of target\nfrequencies and are open on the suction side of the vane. A felt\nmetal mesh cover sheet provides a smooth flow surface.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n9\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Typical result for the first generation implementation\nof the Soft Vane. Over a wide range of sideline angles and\nfrequencies, SV reduced the radiated sideline noise. The\naverage reduction over the entire range of angles and\nfrequencies is around 1 dB.\n\na difficult task. 4 A potential solution is to use active, and adaptive, liners that can adjust to the temporal\nand spatial variations of the incident acoustic field and tailor their response optimally. There is a growing\ninterest in this area and a number of concepts have been proposed. One, in particular, is an\nelectromechanical self-powered liner (Refs. 24 to 29). The sketches in Figure 11 show a comparison of\nthe basic designs of a conventional passive liner and the proposed active electromechanical liner. On the\nleft, typical single and double layer conventional passive liners are depicted. These liners are constructed\nof a honeycomb backing-layer for a single layer type, and two honeycomb backing-layers for double layer\ntype. In each case, the top of the honeycomb layer is covered with a porous faceplate, which is exposed to\nthe airflow. Conventional liners, being passive, are designed to mitigate sound in pre-selected\nfrequencies, typically, a primary frequency and its first odd harmonic. The double layer liner provides\nsome additional mitigation in the frequency range between the target frequencies as compared with the\nsingle layer liner. In contrast, the electromechanical liner shown on the right is active in the sense that it is\nself-adjusting to the frequencies it targets owing to the use of sensor and actuator circuitries. As shown in\nthe sketch in Figure 11, the electromechanical liner includes, in some of its cells, an actuated resonator.\nThe bottom of each resonator cell has a compliant surface that is actively controlled to produce the\ndesired impedance, thus making the resonator appear deeper or shallower as needed. The result is a\nresonator that is always frequency-tuned optimally for cancelling the incident sound. The actuators are\ncontrolled by micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) that monitor the incident sound environment\nthrough embedded sensors in the liner and adjust the response frequency of the actuators in order to\nprecisely target the incident sound field in terms of its amplitude and frequency content. Additionally, the\nelectromechanical liner is self-powered in that some of its cells are equipped with energy harvesting\nelements constructed, for example, from piezo-electric material that convert a portion of the energy of the\nincident sound field into electrical energy that drives the sensors, actuators, and the MEMS control\nsystem. Individual components of this advanced liner have been successfully tested in the laboratory, but\nthe testing of the assembled liner system remains to be carried out (see Refs. 24 to 29 for more details).\n4\n\nPassive bulk absorbers, which have a relatively large frequency range of suppression, are prone to absorbing water\nand oil and losing their effectiveness over time.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n10\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Shown are the schematic description of a conventional liner on the left and an\nadvanced self-powered, self-tuning electromechanical liner on the right.\n\nNoise Shielding\nIn addition to cycle change and application of engine noise reduction technology, careful integration\nof the propulsion system with the airframe could also be a powerful tool for reducing engine noise. In\nfact, significant potential exists for blocking some of the engine noise directed towards the ground by\njudicious installation of the engines. As indicated in the four artist concepts shown in Figure 12, the\nintegration could be accomplished by placing the engines above the wing or fuselage. This is true whether\none is considering a turbofan or an open rotor engine, or whether the airframe is conventional or\nadvanced. The top left concept is that of a hybrid wing body airframe with two turbofan engine pods\ninstalled above the body. The top right concept is that of a conventional tube and wing airframe with two\naft mounted open rotor pusher engines that are partially shielded by the horizontal and vertical tail\nsurfaces that enclose the two engines on the bottom and the sides. The bottom right concept depicts a\nhybrid wing body airframe with two open rotor engines installed on top of the body. The fourth concept is\nthat of a tube and wing airframe with the turbofan engine pods installed on top of the wing. All of these\nconcepts provide for at least partial shielding of the engine noise via the airframe or wing.\nIn order to quantify the benefits of engine noise shielding by the airframe (i.e., fuselage and/or wing),\nNASA has been working in cooperation with Boeing to examine the nuances of propulsion airframe\nintegration as well conducting basic shielding experiments. As part of these efforts, detailed propulsion\nairframe integration tests have been conducted in Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s Low Speed Aeroacoustics Facility (LSAF)\nusing turbofan and open rotor noise simulators with a conventional tube and wing airframe model as well\nas an advanced airframe model called the blended wing body (BWB). The basic shielding experiments\nwere carried out in the NASA 9- by 15-ft Low Speed Acoustic Wind Tunnel using a scale model open\nrotor 5 and a barrier wall representing a simplified wing or empennage (Ref. 30). The results from these\ntests have provided significant insight into the benefits of shielding as a viable means of reducing engine\nnoise.\n5\n\nDepending on the application of interest (i.e., regional jet versus single aisle), the scale factor for the NASA open\nrotor model, which is nominally 27 in. in diameter, is in the range 1/5th to 1/7th.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n11\n\nFigure 12.\xe2\x80\x94Four novel engine/airframe integration concepts with the potential for significant\nshielding of engine noise by the airframe.\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94NASA/Boeing propulsion aeroacoustics tests were conducted in Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s Low Speed Aeroacoustic\nFacility shown on the left. In the middle of the picture is the simulated nozzle just to the left of the Blended\nWing Body planform suspended vertically from the ceiling. On the right, is an artist\xe2\x80\x99s rendering of the quietest\nconfiguration studied in References 4 and 5. Note the location of the nozzles (fan and core) both of which are\nlocated well upstream of the BWB trailing edge to shield the noise from reaching the observer below. The\ndesign of the chevrons and pylons (in keel and crown positions) were optimized for noise reduction.\n\nThe LSAF test results for the shielding of turbofan jet noise are summarized in References 4 and 5. A\nphotograph of the facility with the test article is shown in the left panel of Figure 13. The results for the\nintegration of an open rotor noise simulator with the airframe are discussed in Ref. 31. The basic\nconclusion from the study in References 4 and 5 is that as much as 20 EPNdB cumulative reduction in jet\nnoise is possible by proper shielding of jet noise. An important element of this study was the use of\naggressive chevrons which mitigate the low frequency (i.e., large scale) jet noise and, at the same, also\nbring the location of the peak high frequency (i.e., fine scale) jet noise closer to the nozzle exit plane\nthereby making this source component better shielded. In short, the location of the engines and the use of\nchevrons serve to enhance the effectiveness of shielding by the airframe (see the right panel of Fig. 13).\nThe conclusions of this study will be refined when a planned test campaign in NASA 14- by 22-ft\nSubsonic Wind Tunnel is conducted in 2012.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n12\n\nFigure 14.\xe2\x80\x94Basic shielding experiment layout and sample results. The sketches on top show the position of the open\nrotor model and barrier wall in forward and aft positions (plan view is shown). The contour plots on the bottom show\nchange in sideline sound pressure level (free field \xe2\x80\x93 shielded) as a function of frequency and over a range of\nsideline angles. Positive numbers (red) are reduction in SPL (i.e., shielding benefits). Note that for angles that are\nin the shadow region of the barrier there is significant noise shielding, especially for the barrier in the aft position.\n\nThe layout of the basic shielding experiment carried out in the NASA 9- by 15-ft wind tunnel along\nwith some representative results are shown in Figure 14. Of the four shielding configurations investigated\nin this study, the two short barrier positions shown are most representative of shielding by a wing or an\nempennage. The contour plots in this figure show the change in the sound pressure level, i.e., free field\nminus shielded, over the range of scaled frequencies from 1 to 100 kHz, and over a wide range of sideline\nangles. Here positive numbers (red levels) represent noise reduction. The results indicate that there is\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n13\n\nFigure 15.\xe2\x80\x94The type of empennage shielded open rotor engine\ninstallation analyzed in the study described in Reference 32. The Utail is providing significant shielding below and to the side of the\nengines.\n\nsignificant shielding benefit in the shadow region of the barrier especially for the barrier in the aft\nposition. Using data from this test, a system study (described in Ref. 32) was carried out to estimate\nsystem level noise reduction benefits of shielding by an empennage for a tube and wing type transport\nwith open rotor engines. The analysis suggests that a U-tail empennage such as that shown in Figure 15\ncould provide as much as 8 EPNdB cumulative noise reductions when it is judiciously placed relative to\nthe open rotor engines. Owing to the inherent limitations of this test data, this reduction may not represent\na true system level assessment of actual flight data. Nonetheless, the experimental evidence used in this\nstudy as well as those from the LSAF test campaigns strongly suggest that shielding of the engine noise\nby the airframe and/or wing may be an effective noise reduction tool in the drive to design low-noise\naircraft that could meet the aggressive national noise goals.\n\nConclusions\nNASA is actively exploring a number of noise mitigation strategies for reducing propulsion noise for\nfuture aircraft that could meet the aggressive national subsonic transport noise emission reduction goals.\nSome of these concepts have been tested, or are being tested while others are in conceptual development\nstages. The goal is to provide a portfolio of low-noise strategies for aircraft designers that do not\ncompromise the other performance aspects of the aircraft.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217248\n\n14\n\nReferences\n1. \xe2\x80\x9cFAA Aerospace Forecast \xe2\x80\x93 Fiscal years 2010 - 2031,\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Aviation Administration, Aviation\nPolicy and Plans, URL:\nhttp://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/aviation_forecasts/aerospace_forecast\ns/2011-2031/media/ 2011%20Forecast%20Doc.pdf.\n2. \xe2\x80\x9cNational Aeronautics Research and Development Plan, Biennial Update, February 2010,\xe2\x80\x9d The\nNational Science and Technology Council, URL:\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/aero-rdplan-2010.pdf.\n3.
