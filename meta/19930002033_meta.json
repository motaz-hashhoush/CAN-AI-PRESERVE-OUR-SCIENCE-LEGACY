Supersonic laminar flow control has been identified as a program element, since it offers significant drag-reduction benefits and is one of the more promising technologies for producing an economically viable aircraft design. NASA is using two prototype F-16XL aircraft to research supersonic laminar flow control. The F-16XL planform is similar to design planforms of high-speed civil transports. The planform makes the aircraft ideally suited for developing technology pertinent to high-speed transports. The supersonic laminar flow control research programs for both aircraft are described. Some general results of the ship-1 program demonstrate that significant laminar flow was obtained using laminar flow control on a highly swept wing at supersonic speeds.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19930002033, "endDate": "1992-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "1992 Aerotech Conference", "location": "Anaheim, CA", "id": "df52944b811e4def9a195e838cbda345", "startDate": "1992-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930002033, "id": "5921d999c66144ad9e82d9c7aeee3d83", "publicationDate": "1992-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930002033.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930002033/downloads/19930002033.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930002033/downloads/19930002033.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930002033/downloads/19930002033.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
