Using proven propulsion technologies, SLS will be the most powerful launch vehicle in the world. That capability translates not only into more mass and volume to destinations but also simplified payload design and mission operations and greater opportunity for mission success. \n\nThese capabilities will be important for the Artemis program, NASA\u2019s plan to return humans to the Moon to stay in a sustainable way in order to develop and test technologies and operations needed for human missions to Mars and other destinations. SLS will anchor the transportation leg of an innovative, sustainable program of lunar exploration with commercial and international partners as the first step of human exploration of deep space. \n\nWhile all major hardware and software efforts made significant progress in 2020 and 2021, the most visible was the Green Run test series of the Artemis I core stage conducted at NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center (SSC) on the B-2 test stand. The series validated core stage design, performance, workmanship, and readiness for shipment to NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for final processing, integration and launch. The core stage provides the backbone for SLS\u2019 main propulsion system, consisting of two five-segment solid rocket boosters and four RS-25 liquid hydrogen (LH2)/liquid oxygen (LOX) engines. SLS also includes an Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) that will insert the Orion crew spacecraft into a lunar trajectory.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210009899, "endDate": "2021-08-11T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "6ae7c36d22994563be8376cd35485829", "id": "0329a260bbd544f3a7e033b3dc9ae5fb"}], "name": "AIAA Propulsion & Energy 2021", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "6ae7c36d22994563be8376cd35485829", "url": "https://www.aiaa.org/propulsionenergy/utility/about/future-propulsion-and-energy-dates", "startDate": "2021-08-09T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "ABSTRACT Honeycutt Propulsion and Energy 2021 01262021-BP-MB TWO BP MB TWO.docx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210009899/downloads/ABSTRACT%20Honeycutt%20Propulsion%20and%20Energy%202021%2001262021-BP-MB%20TWO%20BP%20MB%20TWO.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210009899/downloads/ABSTRACT%20Honeycutt%20Propulsion%20and%20Energy%202021%2001262021-BP-MB%20TWO%20BP%20MB%20TWO.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210009899/downloads/ABSTRACT%20Honeycutt%20Propulsion%20and%20Energy%202021%2001262021-BP-MB%20TWO%20BP%20MB%20TWO.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
