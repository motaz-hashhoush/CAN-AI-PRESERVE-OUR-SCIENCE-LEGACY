For ease in implementing the control law, the control inputs are assumed to be delayed and are applied in a sequential fashion. The guidance problem is formulated as a discrete nonlinear optimal control problem with time delays in dynamics and a cost functional of Bolza form. With a quadratic penalty function to handle terminal constraints on velocity and heading, a solution technique to the control problem based on conjugate gradient algorithm is investigated. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of this approach to solution of a terminal area guidance problem in an automated air traffic control environment.", "title": "Four-dimensional guidance problem with control delays", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T15:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760056878, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nagarajan, N."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland, University", "location": "Princess Anne, Md., United States"}}, "id": "1cd9a096665245fc973aaa4494528ecb"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19760056878, "publications": [{"volume": "13", "submissionId": 19760056878, "id": "6b120c8032fa4d31a72fb53df9a244df", "publicationName": "Journal of Aircraft", "publicationDate": "1976-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
