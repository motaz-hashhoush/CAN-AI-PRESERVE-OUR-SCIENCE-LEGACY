On the assumption that the pressure adjusts itself instantaneously to the motion field, it may be computed by various methods. One of these makes use of planetary boundary theory, and of the possible techniques in this category a two-layer iterative scheme admitting of the parametrization of diabatic and baroclinic effects and of secondary flow was chosen. A second method involves the assumption of zero two-dimensional divergence, leading to a Laplace's equation (the balance equation) in pressure, with the wind field serving as a forcing function. This method does not accommodate adiabatic or baroclinic effects, and requires a knowledge of the pressure at all boundary points. Two comparison fields are used for validation: the conventional operational analyses of the US National Meteorological Center (NMC), and the special analyses of the Gulf of Alaska Experiment (GOASEX), which were done by hand. The results of the computations were as follows: (1) The pressure fields, as computed from the SASS winds alone, closely approximated the NMC fields in regions where reasonable in situ coverage was available (typically, one or two mb differences over most of the chart, three to four mb in extreme cases); (2) In some cases the SASS-derived pressure fields displayed high-resolution phenomena not detected by the NMC fields, but evident in the GOASEX data; and, (3) As expected, the pressure fields derived from the balance equation were much smoother and less well resolved than the SASS-derived or NMC fields. The divergence as measured from the SASS winds is smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as, the vorticity.", "title": "Construction of surface pressure field from scatterometer wind field", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T06:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910031214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wurtele, Morton G."}, "organization": {"name": "California Univ.", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "id": "147ae6b850ea4d44ac17ade5ee6c7fc5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910031214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hsu, Carol H."}, "organization": {"name": "California, University", "location": "Los Angeles, United States"}}, "id": "7274988fbb104ff1bd882e716c410a32"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19910031214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cunningham, Glen F."}, "organization": {"name": "California Univ.", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "id": "823e64530ea54c13946ba180e005b17b"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19910031214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Woiceshyn, Peter M."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "a5630412282443189876ca674a37aac6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910031214, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910031214, "id": "dbceafcd728a400081db29df6f715451", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
