b'OPEN ROTOR TEST STATUS\n\nTesting of low noise, counter-rotating open rotor propulsion concepts has\nbeen ongoing at Glenn Research Center in collaboration with General\nElectric Company. The presentation is an overview of the testing that has\nbeen completed to date and previews the upcoming test entries. The\nNASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project Diagnostics entry is\nthe most recent to finish. That test entry included acoustic phased array,\npressure sensitive paint, particle image velocimetry, pylon installed\nmeasurements and acoustic shielding measurements. A preview of the\ndata to be acquired in the 8x6 high-speed wind tunnel is also included.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOpen Rotor Test Status\nDale Van Zante\nDale.E.VanZante@nasa.gov\nAcoustics Branch\nNASA Glenn Research Center\nCleveland, OH\n\nAcoustics Technical Working Group\nHampton, VA\nOctober 21-22, 2010\n\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation Project/Subsonic Fixed Wing Project\n\n1\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOutline\nThe Open Rotor test program\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low speed testing: 9x15 LSWT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ERA Diagnostics Program\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phased Array\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pylon installed acoustics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pressure Sensitive Paint\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Particle Image Velocimetry\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Barrier wall acoustics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High speed testing: 8x6 SWT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 FAA/C L E E N test\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Numerical simulations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Noise prediction status\n\nTesting is supported by the Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project\nData analysis efforts are supported by the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation Project/Subsonic Fixed Wing Project 2\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nThe NASA/GE Collaboration on Open Rotor Testing \t\n\n"\xc2\xae\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Objective: Explore the design space for lower noise while\nmaintaining the high propulsive efficiency from a counter-rotating\nopen rotor system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Approach: A low-noise open rotor system is being tested in\ncollaboration with General Electric and CFM International, a 50/50\njoint company between Snecma and GE.
