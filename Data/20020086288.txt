b"Water Coditinner\n\nA home-use\n\nwater\nt?i?atmmt\nsystem\nincorporates\ntechnology\ndeveloped to\npunh the\nwater aboard\nthe Space\nShuttle\nOrbiters\n\nAt right is the General\nIonics Model IQ\nBacteriostatic Water\nSoftener, a home use\nsystem that not only\nsoftens municipally\ntreated water but also\ninhlbits the growth of\nbacteria within the\nfiltering unit. It was\ndeveloped by Ionics,\nIncorporated,\nBridgeville,\nPennsylvania,\ninternational water\nconsultants and\nmanufacturer of water\ntreatment equipment for\nmunicipal, industrial and\nconsumer use.\nThe bacteria growth\narresting feature of the\nModel IQ is based on\nNASA silver ion\ntechnology developed to\npunfy the water aboard\nthe Space Shuttle\nOrbiters. In Shuttle use,\nan electrolytic water\nfilter generates silver\nions in the water flow;\nthe silver serves as an\neffective bacteria\ninhibiter and deodorizer.\nThe NASA\ntechnology has been\nused in several water\npurification products, among them a line of home\nwater filters developed by Ray Ward, president of\nBon Del, Chula Vista, California. Ward was assisted\nin his development effort by Ionics, Incorporated.\nThe latter company helped him design his\nequipment to make the most efficient usage of silver\nimpregnated carbon (activated carbon helps remove\nobjectionable tastes and odors).\nSome time later, Ionics vice president Walter J.\nPoulens learned that some countries in Europe were\nconsidering a ban on water softeners that breed\nbacteria. It occurred to Poulens that the silver ion\n\nI\ntechnology, on which he had worked with Ward,\nmight be the answer to a water softener that would\nnot breed bacteria.\nIonics used the NASA technology as a departure\npoint for company development of a silver carbon of\nsuch density that it would remain on top of the water\nsoftening resin bed where, Ionics' research indicated,\nthe greatest bacterial growth occurs. After extensive\ncompany testing, the Environmental Protection\nAgency evaluated the process and found Ionics'\nsilver carbon to be an effective bacterial growth\ninhibiter.\n\n"
