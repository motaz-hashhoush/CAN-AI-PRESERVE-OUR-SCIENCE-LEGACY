The ICLS was designed to augment the capabilities of the current Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), providing a data rate capacity large enough to accommodate the expected rates for user satellites (USAT's) in the post-1995 timeframe. The use of 60 GHz for the anticipated successor to TDRSS, the Tracking and Data Acquisition System (TDAS), was selected because of current technology development that will enable multigigibit data rates. Additionally, the attenuation of the earth's atmosphere at 60 GHz means that there is virtually no possibility of terrestrially generated interference (intentional or accidental) or terrestrially based intercept. The ICLS includes the following functional areas: (1) the ICLS payload package on the GEO TDAS satellite that communicates simultaneously with up to five LEO USAT's; (2) the payload package on the USAT that communicates with the TDAS satellite; and (3) the crosslink payload package on the TDAS satellite that communicates with another TDAS satellite. Two methods of data relay on-board the TDAS spacecraft were addressed. One is a complete baseband system (demod and remod) with a bi-directional 2 Gbps data stream; the other is a channelized system wherein some of the channels are baseband and others are merely frequency translated before re-transmission. Descriptions of the TDAS antenna, transmitter, receiver, and mechanical designs are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900014278, "id": "5915a7f530e44c4981322f47ff547658", "publicationDate": "1986-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900014278.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900014278/downloads/19900014278.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900014278/downloads/19900014278.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900014278/downloads/19900014278.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
