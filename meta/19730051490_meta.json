It is shown that, in 1968, an increase in the average southward component occurred when the sector boundary was crossed. This increase can account for the initial increase in magnetic activity. However, the southward component rapidly fell to its preboundary levels, while geomagnetic activity remained elevated for at least a day. This observation suggests that either the magnetosphere took of the order of a day to relax or energy continued to be fed into the magnetosphere at an enhanced rate during the postboundary period. A possible cause of the increase in southward fields at sector boundaries is discussed.", "title": "Geomagnetic activity at sector boundaries.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T04:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19730051490, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hirshberg, J."}, "organization": {"name": "High Altitude Observatory", "location": "Boulder, Colo., United States"}}, "id": "6035736c1a2d42d98ae2bf497d9f7a97"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19730051490, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Colburn, D.
