for about 3 years.\nDuring\nthis\ntime there\nhave been\nmany challenges\nassociated\nwith movement of mechanical\ncomponents,\noperation\nof instrumentation\nsystems,\nand drying\nof insulation\nin

Reynolds\nNumber Testing,\nhas been\noperational\nin a checkout\nand test\nmode for about 3 years.\nThe order\nof magnitude\nincrease\nin Reynolds\nnumber over existing\ntransonic\nwind tunnels\nprovided\nby the NTF, figure\nI, is the result\nof operating\nat cryogenic\ntemperature\nand stagnation\npressures\nto 8.8 atmospheres.\nAlthough\nthe cryogenic\ntemperatures\nprovide\nsome significant\nand well\ndocumented\nbenefits\nfrom a\nReynolds\nnumber standpoint,\nthe harsh environment\nalso\nprovides\nequally\nsignificant\nchallenges\nfor reliable\noperation\nof large\nmechanical\nsystems\nand\ninstrumentation.\nThe approach\nfollowed\nduring\nthe 3 years\nof operating\nin a combined\ncheckout\nand test\nmode had some obvious\nadvantages\nfor a facility\nlike\nthe\nNTF where there\nis not a significant\nexperience\nbase.\nKnown problems\ncan be\nsolved while\nidentifying\nand solving\nthose\nproblems\nthat\nwill\nonly show up by\nusing\nthe tunnel\nin a testing\nmode.\nThe end result\nis a fully\noperational\nfacility\nat an earlier\ndate.\nHowever,\nthere\nare also some disadvantages.\nMost significant\namong them is that\ntesting\nduring\nthis\ntime period\nis at a\nmuch reduced\nlevel\nof efficiency.\nFor a facility\nlike\nNTF where a very high\nlevel\nof efficiency\nis important,\nit\nis difficult\n_or both operators\nand observers\nto maintain\nperspective\nduring\nthis\ntest\nperiod.\nOver the past 3 years a host of operating problems resulting from the\ncryogenic environment have been identified and solved.\nThese ranged from\nmaking mechanical/electrical\nsystems functional to eliminating temperatureinduced vibration, to minimizing the effect of moisture outgassing from the\nthermal insulation.\nAdditionally,\na preliminary flow calibration\nhas been\ncompleted, and a series of aerodynamic tests has\ndemonstrated data quality\nand provided Reynolds number effects on several configurations.\nCurrently,\na major effort is under way, through the summer of 1988, which is devoted to\nimproving operating efficiency with a goal of being ready to efficiently\nsupport both research and development testing requirements by the fall.\nThis paper will review some of the more significant efforts during this\ntime period and summarize the NTF status concerning hardware and instrumentation systems, operating constraints\nimposed by the cryogenic environment,\ndata\nquality, and some Reynolds number data.\n\nSYMBOLS\nwing\n\nchord,\n\nCL\n\nlift\n\ncoefficient\n\nC\n\nrolling\n\nmoment\n\ncoefficient\n\nC_B\n\nrolling\n\nmoment\n\ncoefficient\n\nCN\n\nnormal\n\nforce\n\nCn\n\nyawing\n\nmoment\n\ncoefficient\n\nCnB\n\nyawing\n\nmoment\n\ncoefficient\n\nCp\n\npressure\n\ncoefficient\n\noF\n\ndegrees\n\nFahrenheit\n\nGPM\n\ngallons\n\nper\n\nHP\n\nhorsepower\n\nLN2\n\nliquid\n\nM\n\nMach

initial\nstart-up\nexperience\n(prior\nto 1985) is reported\nin references\nI to 3.\nA_\nstated\npreviously,\nthe testing\nthat\nhas been accomplished\nto date has a twofold\npurpose\nof providing\naerodynamic\ndata and exposing\ntesting\nproblems\nassociated\nwith\nthe tunnel\nand instrumentation\nsystems.\nNine of the configurations\ntested\nare shown in figure\n3 which collectively\nutilized\nthe maximum\ncapability\nof the NTF at both ambient\nand cryogenic\nconditions\nover the Mach\nnumber range.\nTwo other\naircraft\nconfigurations\nhave also been tested\nbut\nwill\nnot be discussed\nhere.\nThe primary\nmodel used for checkout\nof both tunnel and instrumentation\nsystems\nwas the Pathfinder\nI which has a high aspect\nratio\nwing with\na supercritical\nairfoil\n(reference\n4).\nThis model was first\ninstalled\nin the tunnel\nduring\nthe first\nquarter\nof 1985.\nThe major\nareas receiving\nattention\nduring\nthe checkout\nare listed\nat the\nbottom\nof figure\n2 and include\nmodel access,\nprocess\ncontrols,\nmoisture\nin the\ntunnel,\nmodel vibration,\nand tunnel/test\ninstrumentation.\nAll\nof these\nproblems were worked\nsimultaneously\nas indicated\nby the figure\nand were phased in\nwith\nthe testing\nschedule\nas appropriate.\nThe tunnel\nwas unavailable\nfor\ncryogenic\noperation\nduring\nmost of the first\nhalf\nof 1987 due to a failure\nof\nan expansion\njoint\nin the liquid\nnitrogen\nsupply\nsystem.\nModel Access.\n- Access to the model requires\nthe movement of large\ncomponents w--wTt_Tin the tunnel,\n(figures\n4, 5, and 6), over the temperature\nrange\nfrom ambient\nto fully\ncryogenic.\nThe details\nof this\nsystem are defined\nin\nreferences\n3 and 5.\nThe test\nsection\nplenum is isolated\nfrom the rest\nof the\ntunnel\ncircuit\nby large\nisolation\nvalves.\nThe process\nof putting\nthese\nvalves\nin place\n.....\ninvolves\nunlocking\nand translating\na large\nsection\nof the contraction\ncone and the high speed diffuser\naway from the plenum;\nthis\nprocess\nuses dual\nelectrical\ndriven\nactuators\nwith\na seven-foot\nstroke\nwhich must operate\nin\nphase on each component.\nAdditionally,\nthe ability\nto make up limit\nswitches\nor components\nto fairly\nclose\ntolerance\nwhere the compdne_sm_y\nbe exposed\nto\nlarge\ntemperature\nexcursions\nis required.\nWith the plenum vented\nto atmospheric\npressure,\nthe 9- by 12-foot\ndoors in the pressure\nshell\nare opened and\nthe test\nsection\nsidewalls\nare dropped\nso that\naccess\nhousings\nmay be inserted\nto encapsulate\nthe model as shown in figures\n5 and 6.\nThe reliable\nmovement\nof these\nlarge\ncomponents\nat cryogenic\ntemperatures\nhas required\nseveral\nmodifications\nto the basic\nactuation\nconcept.\n_ese\nmodifications\nhave resulted\nfrom operational\nexperience\nand were implemented\nover the past 3 years.\nA\nfinal\nseries\nof modifications\nto these compoHe_s\niS being\nmade during\nthe\ncurrent\nenhancement\nperiod\nwhich should\nmake it a fully\noperational\nsystem.\nProcess\nControls.\n- The primary\ncontrols\nfor the tunnel\nare closed\nloop\nand provide\nfast\nresponse\ninteractive\ncontrol\nof pressure,\ntemperature,\nand\nMach number and control\nof model attitude\n(see figure\n7).\nTHe Controls\nfor\nthe test\nsection\nvariables\n(tunnel\nwalls\nand re-entry\nflaps)\nare also closed\nloop\nbut have slower\nresponse\nrequirements.\n_=_\n\n4\n\nA detailed description of the process controls is provided in reference 6\nand only a brief summary will be presented here.\nThe approach used in design\nof the pressure, temperature, and Mach number controls involved using a mathematical model of the process to determine circuit response characteristics\nin\norder to establish the design criteria for the control hardware and the initial control laws.\nThis approach as indicated in figure 8 required measurement of actual tunnel response characteristics\nfor verification of the control\nlaws and update of the math model.\nThis effort was a first priority in the\nearly tunnel operation and indicated that the accuracy required could not be\nobtained due to insufficient system resolution and excessive instrumentation\nnoise.\nTo correct this problem the microprocessors,\nservo control valves, and\ninstrumention were upgraded.\nThe upgraded stagnation pressure and Mach number\ncontrol systems were completed in the first half of last year.\nThe Mach number system provides a rapid response and will control around set point to\nwithin \xc2\xb1O.OOl.\nThe last system to become fully operational was the temperature control.\nInitially, this system was based on a measurement of the liquid\nnitrogen flow rate entering the tunnel.\nMinimal success was obtained in\nmaking this measurement\nand an alternative approach which calculates the flow\nrate has been recently implemented and provides adequate performance.\nMoisture Contamination.\n- During the early operation of the NTF at Cryoenic temperatures,\na coating was observed on several models that had a frostike appearance.\nQuantifiable measurements of the extent of the coating were\nnot obtainable.\nHowever, it was clear that frost-like crystals were forming\nand that reflected light was making it visible with a television system.\nAn\nextensive study was undertaken to determine the contaminating\nsubstance and\nits source as well as its possible effect on the aerodynamic data.\nThis study\nidentified the contaminant to be water.\nFurther evaluation of the incoming liquid nitrogen, various tunnel purge\ntechnique, and samples of the thermal insulation system identified the insulation as the water source.\nThe closed-cell\npolyisocyanhrate\nfoam used for the\nthermal insulation has been shown to have approximately\n1.5 percent water\nby weight.\n(As a reference, dry wood has approximately 6-percent water by\nweight.)\nThe problem, as shown in figure 9, is that at the cryogenic temperatures only a very small quantity of water is required to saturate the freestream gas.\nFor example, at -70\xc2\xb0F only about 0.2 pounds of water is required\nto saturate all of the gas in the tunnel at atmospheric pressure, while at\n+70\xc2\xb0F about 200 Ibs of water is required.\nTwo questions naturally arise at\nthis point.\nHow to eliminate the moisture, and what is its effect on the\naerodynamic\ndata measurements?\nExtensive investigations\nhave been conducted\nin both areas.\nWith regard to the question of eliminating\nthe moisture, the\nstudies have indicated that the simplest solution appears to be drying the\ntunnel and then maintaining\na dry environment.\nDrying has been accomplished\nin the past by maintaining the tunnel at the maximum warm temperature\n(approximately 150\xc2\xb0F) for several hours in dry nitrogen gas with a periodic purge.\nThe diffusion of water from the insulation in the NTF is a maximum at this\ncondition as indicated in figure 10. The figure also illustrates the reduction in diffusion with decreasing temperature which is, of course, a favorable\neffect.\nSince in the nitrogen operating mode the tunnel is continuously\nvented, i.e., purged to maintain constant stagnation pressure, test conditions\nwith very small amounts of condensation can be obtained.\nAerodynamic\nstudies\nconducted under these conditions, which will be discussed later, have indicated that the resulting effects on the aerodynamic data are not measurable.\n\nTherefore, the plannned approach when the tunnel is brought back into operation at the conclusion of the current enhancementperiod will be to dry it for\nseveral days and keep it closed to atmospheric air.\nIt should be pointed out\nthat the drying process takes place in static as well as operating conditions;\ntherefore, it continues to dry over weekendsand nonworking shifts.\nThe two cryogenic tunnels in Europe with internal insulation, KKKat Koln\nand T2 at Toulouse, have experienced similar moisture concerns and have also\nreached the conclusion that they can achieve conditions of dryness where\neffects on the aerodynamic data are not measurable. Weare convinced from\nexperience to date, with the NTFand other studies, that procedures can be\nfollowed that will eliminate moisture contamination as a concern regarding\naerodynamic data quality.\nModel Vibration. - Significant vibration of the model/balance combination\nin the latera! plaBe has been encountered at some conditions since the initial\noperation of the NTF.\nAfter some period of operation the vibration was found\nto be more severe when the structure was cold.\nThe model pitch system is\nillustrated in figure 11 and is composed of an arc sector driven by a hydraulic cylinder.\nRestraint is provided by a series of bearing pads located at\nboth the top and bottom of the sector.\nThe loads are transmitted\nthrough the\npads to the internal tunnel structure.\nThere is also a fairing on the downstream part of the sector that is fixed to the tunnel structure and provides a\ncavity for instrumentation\nleads.\nThe attachment of the fixed fairing to the\narc sector is a slip joint which allows the sector to move independently\nof\nthe fairing.\nThe bearing pads, while providing restraint, also have clearance\nto allow for thermally induced movement of the internal structure.\nThe vibration problem has been investigated both experimentally\nand analytically.\nIn the experimental investigation,\nthe Pathfinder model was used\nas a test vehicle.\nBoth it and the model support system were extensively\ninstrumented as follows:\na. Six component force\nPathfinder model\n\nbalance\n\nb. Pressure\n\nin the fixed\n\ntranducers\n\nd. Strain\n\non the fixed\nstructure\n\naccelerometer\n\nfairing\n\nfairing,\n\nand test\n\nbearing\n\npads,\n\npackage\n\nsection\n\nin the\n\nwalls\n\nand the surrounding\n\nr\n\nc. Accelerometers\ntunnel support\n\nand 3-axis\n\ngages and thermocouples\n\non the tunnel\n\nsupport\n\nstructure\n\nThe analytical investigation\ninvolved detailed calculations of the\ndynamic structural respose and of the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics\nthe model support system.\n\nof\n\nExperimental observations were made of the dynamic structural response\ncharacteristics,\nMach number, dynamic-pressure,\ntest temperature, and coldsoak\ntime.\nThe installation of vortex generators and splitter plate on the fixed\nfairing afterbody helped to identify unsteady flow at the rear of the arc sector as one of the sources of dynamic excitation.\nEventually, the primary factor governing the dynamic response of the model was found to be the clearance\ntolerance between the bearing pads and the surface of the arc sector.\nA\n\nprocedure was evolved for setting the clearance adjustment which reduced the\nmodel dynamic response to acceptably low levels independent of temperature\ncycling.\nSomeof the test results are illustrated\nin figure 12 which shows\nthe dynamic yawing momentas a function of stagnation temperature for several\nof the test configurations of the arc sector. Although the low level shown in\nthe figure for the last case is completely satisfactory,\nit may be sensitive\nto adjustment with time due to temperature cycling.\nInstrumentation.\n- For several years prior to initial operation of the\nNTF an extensive research and development program was undertaken by the\nInstrument Research Division at Langley to develop instrumentation\nsystems for\nbasic measurements\nof forces and moments, pressures, and angle of attack that\nwould function with both reliability and accuracy in the cryogenic environment.\nThe results of this program were the development of strain gage balances that were not temperature controlled and heated instrument packages for\npressure and angle of attack measurements.\nThese instrument systems were\ndeveloped in cryogenic chambers and verified to the extent possible, in the\nO.3-Meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel and indicated good performance and soundness of the basic concepts.\nUpon application of these instruments to models\nin the NTF, there were several system problems that had to be resolved.\nThe\nmost significant of these were the effect of leads required to support the\npressure instrumentation\nsystem on the balance axial force component, and the\ncalibration\nsystem for the electronic scanning pressure (ESP) system.\nRecent\ntests, both in the NTF and in the cryogenic checkout chamber, have indicated\nsatisfactory resoultion of both of these problems.\nAs will be discussed in a later section, a strong concern from the outset\nhas been data quality.\nIn this regard, an extensive effort has been carried\nout to eliminate data scatter due to electrical noise and extraneous signals.\nCare was taken from the beginning to provide a "clean" instrumentation\nground,\nbut as is often the case, extraneous signals can creep into the system.\nA\nsignificant effort has been made over the past year to track down and eliminate noise sources that were infiltrating the data system.\nThe results of\nthis effort are indicated in figure 13. The figure illustrates a reduction in\ndata scatter by a factor of 5 to a level less than 10 microvolts.\nThis level\ncorresponds\nto a balance error of less than 0.1 percent of full scale.\n\nOPERATING\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\nThe NTF has the general appearance of, and is often talked about, as a\ntypical continuous operating fan driven wind tunnel that has the potential to\nmass produce data on a continuous basis.\nAlthough in principle the potential\nexists, it is somewhat misleading to think about a large cryogenic tunnel in\nthis context.\nIn reality the operation must be viewed much as a blow-down\ntunnel with efforts directed toward minimizing run time and maximizing data\ngathering rates.\nThe two main constraints with regard to run time are liquid\nnitrogen logistics and costs, and model access.\nIt was shown in the early\n1970\'s that the application of cryogenics to wind tunnel testing provided the\nmost cost effective approach to high Reynolds number testing.\nThis does not\nmean, however, that testing at high Reynolds numbers will carry the same cost\nand degree of complexity as testing in the many ambient temperature and pressure tunnels around the country.\nThis is illustrated in figure 14 where the\nenergy cost ratio (liquid nitrogen is a form of energy) is shown as a function\n\nof Reynolds number ratio for the NTFcompared to the Langley 16-Foot Transonic\nTunnel. An order of magnitude increase in Reynolds number has an energy cost\nratio of approximatley 44. In the cases where high Reynolds number is required for research or development testing, the cost is cheap comparedto\nflight test.\nBut because of this cost difference, test programs and objectives must be carefully defined and supported by adequate precursor studies at\nlow Reynolds numbers. Therefore, it is not well suited for researchers to\nexercise broad freedom or for indiscriminate development programs.\nLN 2 Supply System. - Liquid nitrogen is supplied to the NTF by a commercial air separation piant located adjacent to the Langley property and connected to the NTF site by a pipeline.\nThe capability of this system is shown\nin figure 15. The challenge is to optimize the interface of the plant which\noperates continuously 24 hours per day at a 300 ton per day rate with the\nintermittent\noperation of the NTF, which can use LN 2 to a maximum rate of\n30 tons per minute.\nThis requires, of course, storage tanks to serve as a\nbuffer.\nThe current system has a 2100 ton storage tank at the plant and a\n700 ton tank located at the NTF with capability to transfer approximately\none\ntank per 24 hour day. The system can sustain a use rate of 2100 tons per week\nand if the tunnel has not been using nitrogen for a while, can build up to a\nmaximum quantity available of 4800 tons for a week.\nThis tends to optimize On\ntwo week test programs using liquid nitrogen assuming all tanks are full at\nthe start.\nThe maximum transfer rate of the pipeline is 656 tons or approximately one NTF tankful per day; therefore, the maximum use rate is one tankful per day. As shown in figure 16, if operation is started on Monday morning with the equivalent of four NTF tankfuls available and used at a rate of\n1 tank per day, with 0.5 tanks being resupplied by the plant, and no use over\nthe weekend, the total supply is exhausted by the end of the second week.\nThe\noptions at that point are either to operate on one-half tank per day (the\nplant output) Whi\xc2\xa2_ is not practical, or to allow B days for the nitrogen supply to be replenished and use the tunnel in the air mode or some other capacity during this period.\nThis use scenario can be changed, of course, by _\nincreasing the plant capacity and/or storage and transfer rate.\nA decision to\nincrease the plant capacity must take into consideration\nlong term use rates.\nThe most immediate benefit wili be provided by an increase in storage capacity\nand associated transfer rates.\nCurrent plans are to triple the NTF onsite\nstorage capacity in FY 1990.\nThis will tend to optimize at about a three week\ntest program in nitrogen.\nThe most important aspect of the tunnel operation from cost considerations is the speed of changing test conditions and data acquisition.\nThis is\ndriven primarily by the degree and quality of automation.\nFigure 17 illustrates the impact of time per data point for a typical test condition of\nM = 0.8 and temperature = -250\xc2\xb0F.\nThis illustration includes time to change\nangle of attack and Mach number and adjust temperature and pressure.\nWhen the\nNTF was first brought on-line and manual control was used, times averaged\ngreater than 45 seconds per point.\nAfter the current enhancement period it is\nexpected to be under 30 seconds per point with a goal of 7 to 10 seconds per\npoint with further refinements in the control and operating system.\nThe reduction in electrical signal noise discussed earlier has a direct impact on\nthis in that it reduces the number of data samples required to be averaged to\nobtain high quality data.\n\nDATAQUALITY\nIn this section the status of flow calibrations and efforts to assess\ndata quality will be discussed. The discussion will include both steady and\ndynamic aspects of the flow calibration,\nthe ability to measure _lach numbers\nand angle of attack, importance of wall boundary effects, and the effect of\nmoisture contamination or "frost" on the data.\nFlow Calibration. - As reported previously, references 3 to 10, the NTF\nhas been opera__oughout\nthe operating envelope as shown in the upper left\nof figure 18. The initial calibration looked at the distributions of temperature, pressure, Mach number, and flow angularity on the tunnel centerline as\nmeasured by the model upright and inverted.\nMore recent efforts concerned the\ndetails of the Mach number calibration and the effect of temperature on flow\nangle.\nThe ability to vary the test section wall angle provides the capability\nto maintain zero Mach number gradient through the test section, thus eliminating model buoyancy effects in the empty tunnel for all test conditions.\nA\ntypical variation of wall angle with Mach number is shown in the left of figure 19. This particular case is for a warm temperature of 100\xc2\xb0F and varies\nfrom approximately\n0.2 \xc2\xb0 convergence at M = 0.2 to 0.4 \xc2\xb0 divergence at M = 1.15.\nA typical correction to Mach number as calculated from the plenum static or\nreference pressure is also shown.\nIn general the quality of the steady flow\nappears to be excellent and sufficient adjustments are available on the test\nsection geometry, i.e., wall angle and re-entry flap settings, to eliminate\nthe existence of any Mach number gradients in the empty tunnel.\nIn order to investigate the effect of tunnel structural deformation due\nto temperature gradients in the structure on flow angle with temperature,\nfrequent measurements of flow angle have been made during the last several test\nprograms.\nThe data presented in figure 20 are typical of results obtained\nfrom these measurements.\nWith the exception of one point the effective flow\nangle is always equal\nment accuracy.\nThis\nhistory is developed\nquency of flow angle\n\nto or less than 0.02 \xc2\xb0 which is approaching the measureeffect will continue to be monitored until sufficient\nto have a firm basis for determining the required fremeasurements.\n\nNTF Dynamic Flow Quality. - In 1980 while the NTF was still under construction, the plans for flow quality measurement\nwere described extensively\nin reference 11. The measurements were to consist primarily of fluctuating\npressure and velocity measurements.\nSince that time, hot-film probes and\nfluctuating pressure gages have been operated in the test section at the\nlocations indicated in figure 21, and further tests are planned as also shown.\nSome results of the measurements\nmade to date are shown in figures 22 and\n23.\nThese results have been excerpted from work by W. B. Igoe on a proposed\ndoctoral dissertation to be submitted to the George Washington University.\nFigure 22 shows the root-mean-square\nfluctuating static pressure measured in\nthe NTF as a function of Mach number for a unit Reynolds number of 6 million\nper foot.\nThe fluctuating pressures were measured in air on the test section\nsidewall and have been divided by free-stream static pressure.\nFluctuating\nstatic pressures have been measured in the free stream in a number of other\nlarge transonic wind tunnels using a 10 \xc2\xb0 cone on the centerline\n(see\n\nreference 12 for example). Someof these results have been included for\ncomparison in figure 22 for a Reynolds number range of 1.3 to 5 million per\nfoot.\nThe results of hot-film probe measurementsat low Mach number in the test\nsection are shown in figure 23. These measurementswere madein the free\nstream in air with the slots closed. Results are shown for the streamwise\nmeasurementsat total pressures of 1 and 8 atm. Although there is considerable scatter at a pressure of I atm, the measurementlevels are about 0.1 percent, which was the target level for the NTF. Streamwise hot-wire probe measurements madein the Langley LowTurbulence Pressure Tunnel (LTPT) at total\npressures of 1 and 10 atm (reference 13) are shown for comparison.\nFurther measurementsin the NTFare planned using fluctuating static\npressure probes in the test section free stream, and hot-film probes in the\ntest section, settling chamber, and in the vicinity\nof the cooling coil and\nscreens. The measurementswill be madeover the full operating range of the\nNTF. By the time the measurementsare completed, the dynamic flow quality of\nthe NTFwill have been fully documented.\nMachNumberand Angle of Attack Sensitivities.\n- Prior to looking at\neither Reynolds number effects or the effects of frost on data quality, it was\ndesirable to obtain an assessment of the sensitivity\nof the model to the basic\ntest parameters, Mach numberand angle of attack, and somequalitative\nassessment of our ability to measure them. As stated in the introduction,\nthe\nprimary model used for assessing data quality was the Pathfinder I Model.\nThis model was built early in the program for the purpose of developing model\ndesign and fabrication technology as well as providing a research model. It\nhas an aspect ratio 10 wing with a supercritical\nairfoil\nsection typical of\nsupercritical\nairfoil\ndesign technology of the mid 1970\'s. As a result, shock\nmovementis very sensitive to small changes around the design point in Mach\nnumber and angle of attack. This made it a goodmodel for use in assessing\nour ability to measure Mach number and angle of attack in the NTF. Figures 24\nto 26 illustrate\nthe results obtained from this assessment. The figures show\npressure distributions\nfor an inboard and an outboard wing station at a Mach\nnumber around 0.82 with transition fixed at 10 percent of chord. The data of\nfigure 24 showsthat a Mach number increment of 0.0038 results in a shock\nmovementof about 6 percent of chord for the outboard wing station.\nIn light\nof the high degree of sensitivity\nto Mach number, a series of runs were compared where all variables except Mach numberwere held constant and Mach\nnumber varied in very small increments of 0.0001 to 0._006. Wing pressure\ndistributions\nfor these cases are shown in figure 25. The data show an\norderly progression of shock movementand the we11_defined curves suggest that\nboth wing pressures and Mach numberare being measuredwith a high degree of\naccuracy.\n_\n\n_i _::_i\n_::: _:::\n\n_\n\n_\n\n::\n\n_z\n\n_\n\nThe sensitivity of this model to angle of attack is illustrated in figure 26.\nIn this case, the angle of attack increment was 0.054 \xc2\xb0 with a Mach\nnumber difference of 0.0013.\nAgain, the:shock movement is about 5 to 6 percent.\nHowever, about one half of the movement can be attributed to Mach\nnumber effectS.\nThese data support the point that _hehighestqual_ty\ninstrumentation is an absolute requirement for using the NTF to understand incremental effects of Reynolds number and compressibility.\nFurther they support the\nconclusion that a high degree of accuracy is currently available in the Mach\n\n10\n\nnumber, angle of attack, and model pressure measuring systems. The data also\nunderscore the importance of being able to accurately assess wall boundary\neffects.\nRecent research on this subject by W. B. Kemp(ref. 14), P. A.\nNewman\nand associates (ref. 15), is described by Dr. Newman a separate\nin\nsession of this symposium. Sophisticated techniques have been developed which\nutilize measured tunnel wall static pressures to calculate model induced variations of Mach number and upwashthrough the test section. Figure 27 shows\ntypical contours, in the region of the model, of wall induced Mach number\ncorrections.\nFor this size model at the conditions illustrated the corrections are relatively\nfigures, corrections\nare to be obtained.\n\nsmall, AM = 0.001, but as illustrated in the previous\nof this magnitude are significant if high quality data\n\nMoisture Contamination\n"Frost" Effects. - Having established\nconfidence\nthat small incremental effects of the basic test parameters, Mach number, and\nangle of attack could be both controlled and measured, an investigation\nto\nassess the possible effects of frost on the data was undertaken.\nCare was\nalso taken to insure that comparable test\nparameters were obtained where the\nonly significant variable was that in one case frost was visible on the model\nand in the other case it was not visible.\nWing pressure distributions\nfrom\nthese two cases are compared in figure 28.\nAlthough care was exercised in\nsetting the test parameters it should be noted that the Mach number is different by 0.0004 and the angle of attack by 0.01 \xc2\xb0 . These differences are\nbelieved, based on previous discussion, to account for the small difference in\nshock location shown in the data of figure 28 for the outboard wing station.\nAFter accounting for the difference in shock location, there is a small difference in pressure level ahead of the shock that may be a small effect of\nfrost.\nIn general the two cases are in very close agreement and provide confidence that when planned tunnel drying procedures are used and the inside of\nthe tunnel kept closed to atmospheric air, frost on the models will not be a\nproblem with regard to data quality.\n\nREYNOLDS\n\nNUMBER\n\nEFFECTS\n\nDuring this initial checkout and testing\nsensitivity\nstudies have been conducted using\nand the cryogenic capability\n\nphase several Reynolds number\nboth the conventional air mode\n\nAir Operation. - The operating envelope in air is shown in figure 29.\nIt\nis restricted above a Mach number of 0.4 by the drive power in the variable\nspeed motors.\nA maximum Reynolds number capability of about 20 million per\nfoot at a Mach number of 0.38 is available.\nThis Reynolds number is the\nmaximum available in this speed range and tunnel size in the United States.\nOne of the attractive features of this capability is that a constant dynamic\npressure line tends to be close to the maximum drive power boundary.\nTherefore, models designed for testing at high subsonic or transonic speeds at 1 to\n2 atmospheres can also be tested at high Reynolds numbers at the lower !lach\nnumbers at the same dynamic pressure and model loads.\nOne case where this was\ndone was the EA-6B wing modification program.\nThe objectives and overall\nresults from this program are described in reference 16.\nIn summary, it\ninvolved modifying the wing leading-edge slat and trailing-edge\nflap airfoil\nsections with a major goal of improving maximum lift at loiter and maneuver\nconditions.\nA photograph of the EA-6B configuration\nmounted in the NTF is\n\n11\n\nshown in figure 30. The effect of Reynolds number on the lift\ncharacteristics\nat a Mach numberof 0.30 for the basic and modified configuration are shown in\nfigure 31. The 1.4 million Reynolds numbercase corresponds to testing at 1\natmosphere stagnation pressure. Two points are significant.\nFirst, as would\nbe expected, Reynolds numbereffects on CLmaxare large for all configurations.\nSecond, modifications to the leading-edge slat showedno benefit at\nthe low Reynolds number condition; however, at the higher Reynolds number the\nslat benefit was approximately equal to that of the flap.\nThese data are an\nexample of the potential pitfalls\nof relying on low Reynolds number data for\nconfiguration refinement. The effect of Reynolds number on lateral and directional stability\nas measuredby C_B and Cn_ are shown in figures 32 and 33.\nThe effects are not as dramatic as those shown for CLmax but in general a\n,\nstabilizing\nincrement in lateral stability\nwas obtained with increasing Reynolds number. The exception to this was the basic configuration above _= 16\xc2\xb0\nand the modified wing configuration with glove and vertical tail extension\nabove _ equal about 14\xc2\xb0 . A more stabilizing\neffect in CnBwas obtained for\nall configurations with increasing Reynolds number.\nCryogenic Operations. - Results from three of the configurations tested\nduring this perTod will be briefly discussed here. They include the Pathfinder I, a Lockheed high-wing transport which was a Lockheed wing tested on\nthe Pathfinder I fuselage, and a rather large submarine model.\nThe Pathfinder I (figure 34) was tested over a range of conditions; however, most of the test was aimed at evaluating instrumentation and moisture\nconcerns. Most of the high Reynolds number data was obtained in the early\ntest program and in retrospect may have been contaminated with moisture\neffects and instrumentation errors.\nTherefore, the data shown in figure 35\nare for more intermediate Reynolds numbers (RN = 5 and 18 million) which were\nknown to be free of instrumentation\nerrors.\nThese data are for a Mach number\nof 0.82, a constant angle of attack and essentially constant lift coefficient\nwith transition fixed at approximately\nlO-percent chord.\nThese conditions are\nthe design point for the wing.\nThe natural transition point of the 18 million\nReynolds number case was estimated to be essentially at the trip location.\nThe effects of Reynolds number are relatively small with only a slight aft\nmovement of the shock indicated at the outboard wing station.\nThe data for the Lockheed configuration\nshown in figure 36 show a much\nmore pronounced effect of Reynolds number.\nA photograph of the model is\npresented in figure 37.\nFor the case with transition fixed, the strip was\nlocated at a constant 1-inch aft of the wing leading edge.\nThe difference in\nshock location between transition fixed and free at a Reynolds number of 5\nmillion is about 18 percent of chord.\nA significant difference was obtained\nby increasing the Reynolds number to 30 million.\nA further increase to 40\nmillion produced a negligible effect.\nThese data clearly support the wellknown need to be able to monitor transition location as a function of Reynolds\nnumber if effects at Reynolds numbers less than full scale are to be\ninterpreted.\nThe submarine test in NTF was unique in that full scale Reynolds number\nwas obtained in a wind tunnel for the first time.\nA photograph of the model\nand Reynolds number velocity envelope is presentd in figure 38.\nDetails of\nthe test and data have been omitted for classified security reasons.\nIn the\n\n12\n\ntest both static and dynamic measurementsof pressures were obtained through\nthe boundary layer in the plane of the propeller for evaluation and development of scaling laws. As can be seen on the right of figure 38, data in the\npast using a 6 percent scale model have been obtained at Reynolds numbers\nabout an order of magnitude below full scale. The test in the NTFextended\nthese data well into the region of full-scale\nsubmarine operation.\nSUMMARY\nThe National Transonic Facility has been operational\nin a checkout and\ntest mode for the past 3 years.\nDuring this time there have been many challenges associated with testing in a large cryogenic wind tunnel.\nFor the most\npart they centered around the effect of large temperature excursions on the\nmechanical movement of large components, the reliable performance of instrumentation systems, and an unexpected moisture problem with dry insulation.\nMost of these challenges have been met, and it is expected that the rest of\nthem will be met during a major effort that is ongoing through the summer of\n1988 to improve operational efficiency.\nAlso, during the past 3 years a\npreliminary\nflow calibration\nhas been completed and a data quality evaluation\nconducted along with high Reynolds number aerodynamic tests of several configurations.\nTests were also conducted that provided major inputs to several\nprograms that were not discussed for classification\nreasons.\nThere is still a\nrequirement for a major effort to develop and implement flow visualization\nand\ndiagnostic techniques for maximum utilization of the facility.\nThe current\nNASA facility revitalization\nprogram includes funding for these activities in\nFY\'89 and 90.\nHowever, from a basic facility standpoint, we believe that it\nwill be ready to efficiently\nsupport research and development requirements by\nthe fall of 1988.\n\n13\n\nREFERENCES\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMcKinney,\nFacility.\n\nLinwood W.:\nOperational Experience\nAGARD-CP-348,\n184, 1983.\n\nwith the National\n\nTransonic\n\nBruce, Walter E., Jr.; Fuller, Dennis E.; and Igoe, William B.:\nTransonic Facility Shakedown Test Results and Calibration Plans\xe2\x80\xa2\nPaper 84-0584CP, 1985.\nBruce, Walter E., Jr.:\nThe U.S. National\nand II.
