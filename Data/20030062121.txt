This paper describes the engineering of several vehicles designed for a crewed mission to the Jovian\nsatellite Callisto. Each subsystem is discussed in detail. Mission and trajectory analysis for each mission concept\nis described. Crew support components are also described. Vehicles were developed using both fission powered\nmagneto plasma dynamic (MPD) thrusters and magnetized target fusion (MTF) propulsion systems. Conclusions\nwere drawn regarding the usefulness of these propulsion systems for crewed exploration of the outer solar system.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAdministrator Daniel Goldin initiated the Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts (RASC) activity starting\nin fiscal year 2001 to address conceptual design of systems and architectures for potential missions 25 to 40\nyears in the future. The results of these designs were to determine the technologies and infrastructure necessary\nto enable those missions. Consequently RASC studies were intended to take a \xe2\x80\x9ctop-down\xe2\x80\x9d approach\nIn fiscal year 2002 RASC organized the Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE) group to investigate the\npossibility of crewed travel to the outer solar system. Three scenarios were considered, nuclear thermal\npropulsion using crewed and support vehicles, nuclear electric propulsion also using crewed and support\nvehicles and fusion propulsion using crewed vehicles only. The outer solar system from the asteroid belt and\nbeyond was surveyed to select a suitable baseline destination point. Using assumptions on requirements and\navailable technology three centers (GRC, LaRC and MSFC) designed vehicles to support a crewed trip to the\nouter solar system. The emphasis on this study was to gain a greater understanding of the challenges associated\nwith these missions so that they can be addressed now.\n\nSELECTED DESTINATION\nA number of candidate destinations were considered before the final selection was made. The major selection\ncriteria can be summarized as follows. The destination should be a body in the outer solar system, here defined\nas being beyond the orbit of Mars, it should be suitable for human surface exploration and it should contain\nsome features of legitimate scientific interest. The requirement for human surface exploration ruled out any of\nthe gas giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, although not their extensive satellite systems. As a\nfinal criteria, it was desirable that the destination present a suitable level of challenge for the technology options\nconsidered.\nAmongst the short-listed candidates were the following bodies.\n\nCeres; the largest known asteroid, with a diameter of almost 1000 km, located in the main asteroid belt.\nScientific interest is largely focused on determining the composition and structure of the asteroid as a\nkey to understanding the formation and development of the Solar System. Additional interest is\nprompted by asteroidal mining and planetary defense considerations. Due to its relatively close\nproximity and low mass, Ceres presents a simpler set of design challenges than more distant\ndestinations.\nEuropa; the smallest of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s Galileian satellites and the second-closest to the planet itself.\nScientific interest is largely prompted by the likely presence of a submerged ocean with tidal-heating,\nwhich could offer conditions conducive to the development of life. Europa\xe2\x80\x99s location, within the\nJovian radiation belts, poses significant design challenges, particularly when contemplating human\nsurface exploration.\nCallisto; the second-largest Galilean satellite and the most distant from Jupiter itself. Scientific interest\nis prompted by the possibility of subsurface water. Callisto\xe2\x80\x99s distance from Jupiter places it in a\nsignificantly less hazardous radiation environment than Europa, potentially permitting human surface\noperations.\nTitan; the largest satellite of Saturn and one of the largest in the Solar System. Scientific interest is\nconsiderable, in part because Titan appears to be more complex than other satellites, with a significant\n(and opaque) atmosphere, possibly offering conditions conducive to the development of life. The\nmission difficulty due to the relative remoteness of Saturn is offset by the absence of any significant\nradiation belts.\nChiron; an unusual minor planet, following an eccentric orbit with perihelion just outside the orbit of\nSaturn and aphelion just within that of Uranus. Scientific curiosity is prompted by Chiron\xe2\x80\x99s visible\ncoma and variable brightness, which appear to indicate that volatile compounds are being vaporized\nfrom this, in other respects, asteroidal body. It is hypothesized that Chiron has only been resident in its\npresent orbit for a relatively short period having previously been located in the (trans-Neptunian)\nKuiper Belt. Access to Chiron could yield important data about the composition and structure of\nKuiper Belt objects which are thought likely to be remnant objects from the Solar System\xe2\x80\x99s formation.\nIts remotenss and low temperature would pose significant technical problems.\nTriton; the largest satellite of Neptune and the only significant satellite in the Solar System which\nfollows a retrograde orbit. Scientific interest is due to its continuing seismic activity, as manifested by\nseveral \xe2\x80\x9cice\xe2\x80\x9d volcanoes, and the likelyhood that Triton is a Kuiper Belt object, captured by Neptune in\nthe relatively recent past. Triton\xe2\x80\x99s remotenss and low temperature pose significant design challenges.\nThe Jovian moon Callisto was selected because of the balance which it offers between scientific interest, design\nchallenge severity and the level of hazard to human operations posed by the local environment.\n\nVEHICLE DESIGN\nOriginally MSFC\xe2\x80\x99s task was to consider fusion concepts only for the crewed outer planet mission. The initial\nconcepts selected were the Spherical Torus concept described by Williams et al., the Magnetized Target Fusion\n(MTF) concept by Thio et al. and the VISTA concept by Orth et al. These three concepts seemed to cover a\nbroad range of fusion concepts applications from continuous magnetic confinement to inertial pulsed\nconfinement. Fusion concepts employing antimatter were not considered as their level of development seemed\ntoo low to support a vehicle conceptual design.\nOne of the assumptions for this study was that the crew could only be subjected to one-year total of\nmicrogravity. Therefore any missions over a year would require an artificial gravity system. All of the above\nconcepts were developed using a total mission time of one year and a crew stay time on the target planet of one\n\nmonth. The concepts above were capable of such a mission but some of the initial vehicle masses were\nuntenable.\nThere was little design data on the Spherical Torus and VISTA concepts in the literature. The design team\nincorporated point designs found in the literature to complete preliminary vehicle designs to the selected\ndestination. Unfortunately. these vehicles were non-competitive in part due to the fact that the engine\nparameters were optimized for different missions. Therefore MTF was the only reasonable option for further\nstudy.\nSeveral different options for MTF were then considered. A Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) reaction was\nconsidered to be the baseline with a Deuterium-Helium-3 shown as an advanced option. The fission concepts\ndeveloped by the other centers required an 180-day crew time on planet. The stay time was defined by a desire\nto wait for Jupiter and Earth to come back into realignment and reduce total vehicle delta-V requirements. The\nstudy lead therefore asked for a fusion option with a 180 day stay time for purposes of consistency. While\nrefining the mission design, it was determined that avoiding the artificial gravity requirement by forcing the\nmission duration to be under the one-year limit was more costly than accounting for the additional mass of an\nartificial gravity system. A total mission duration of 1 years was the final selection for the MTF missions. The\none year mission required the vehicle to fly retrograde on both outbound and inbound legs. The 1 - yr mission\ntime eliminated this problem and reduced the acceleration requirements. The addition of an artificial gravity\nsystem was minor compared to the gains due to the decreased delta-V requirements of the longer mission.\nFrom all of these considerations three MTF options were selected for further study; MTF D-D 30 day stay,\nMTF D-D 180 day stay; and MTF D-He3 180 day stay.\nAt the end of the study MSFC also investigated several technologies that hold promise to increase performance\nfor the nuclear electric fission options. The baseline nuclear electric option was a solid core NERVA style\nreactor with a Brayton power conversion system and a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster assembly. MSFC\ninvestigated an option that replaced the reactor and power conversion system with a molten salt reactor and\nliquid metal rankine power conversion system. Additionally MSFC investigated a system that replaced the\nBrayton cycle with a magnetohydrodynamic power conversion system. These concepts require a five year\nmission time and split mission profile that the baseline case does not. These results are shown below.\n\nPayload Components\nThe payload components of the HOPE vehicle consist of a Trans-Hab module, a surface habitat, a lander, and\nan ISRU plant. These components are responsible for providing a livable environment on the vehicle and on\nthe surface of Callisto as well as collect scientific data. The Trans-Hab is the main living quarters for the sixcrew members. This module has a mass of approximately 40 metric tons with an additional 4 metric tons of\nconsumables.\nThe surface habitat is an inflatable structure that can house three crewmembers on the surface of Callisto. It is\nresponsible for providing shelter to the surface crew and will serve as a laboratory for surface experiments. A\n250-kilowatt electric (1 megawatt thermal) reactor located 1 kilometer away will transmit power to the surface\nhabitat for surface operations.\nThe lander is used as a crew and materials transit between the surface of Callisto and the orbiter. It will be\ncapable of sending up to 40 metric tons down to the surface. It\xe2\x80\x99s fuel will come from resources existing on the\nsurface of Callisto.\n\nCallisto is a desolate minor planet with more impact craters than any other object in the solar system. The crust\nof the moon dates back 4 billion years, that is around the time the solar system was formed. This ancient\nsurface may be able to provide scientific information about our early solar system. In addition to scientific\ninformation Callisto may also be able to provide mission resources.\nCallisto has a density of 1.86 gm/cm3, and is comprised of ice and rock. The 200 km thick crust is an icy layer\nthat could be mined to produce water. Beneath the crust is believed to be an ocean of salt and water, 10 km\ndeep. Because Callisto contains such an abundance of water, it can provide various resources. Through simple\ndistillation and dissociation processes, oxygen and hydrogen can be produced for fuel and air. The In-Situ\nResource Utilization (ISRU) unit will convert the icy reguleth of Callisto into water, LOX and liquid hydrogen\nat a rate equivalent to 21 kg of water per hour. This will provide enough propellant for the lander to rendezvous\nwith the orbiter every thirty days. The ISRU will require a power of 215 kilowatts.\n\nReaction Control System\nThe reaction control system (RCS) is based on an oxygen and hydrogen chemical propulsion system. Twentyfour 500 Ibf thruster are located in two ring frames on the vehicles structure and provide full six-degrees-offreedom for attitude control, docking and spin control for artificial gravity. During the outbound and inbound\nportions of the fight, the manned vehicle is spun at approximately one-and-a-quarter revolutions a minute to\nsimulate 25% of Earth gravity. To accomplish both of these tasks up to 85,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and\nliquid hydrogen propellant are stored separately from the main drive propellant. These propellants are\nmaintained in a liquid state by the liberal application of multi-layer insulation with any additional heat leakage\ninto the system removed with cryo-coolers powered by the main electrical system. To ensure that the\npropellants are at the proper gaseous temperatures and pressures required by these RCS thrusters, a series of\nrun-tanks use electrical resistance heaters to convert the cryogenically stored liquid propellants into the gaseous\npropellants required for the RCS thrusters. These run tanks are sized to hold approximately one meter per\nsecond delta V of gaseous propellant, which is available on-demand to the RCS thruster. If additional\npropellant is required beyond the one meter per second stored in the run tanks, the run tanks become a\nconditioning plenum, converting liquid cryogenic liquid propellant into gaseous propellant during high demand\nattitude control and artificial gravity spin maneuvers. In addition to the main RCS thrusters are a series of\nsmaller 50 Ibf hydrogen cold gas thrusters, which are used as needed for fine pointing and close proximity\noperations.\nFigure 1. Baseline Vehicle RCS Schematic\n\n,.....\n.. ..\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n. . . . ..\n.\n\n. ...\n. ..\n\nStructural Components\nThe main propellant tanks for this study were designed with the LVA (Launch Vehicle Analysis)[l] computer\ntool. The analysis was based on the assumption that the tank is launched fully loaded with hydrogen without a\nshroud and was not assumed to be pressure stabilized. LVA analyzed the tank using the full gamut of prelaunch, lift-off, and flight loads. The tanks have both fore and aft skirts that remain with the tank throughout\nthe mission. The necessary docking equipment is launched within the skirts.\nThe main truss design was based on earlier manned Mars studies. With an on-orbit assembled truss, the\ndesigning loads are not the propulsion system thrust as is commonly thought. Most of the weight comes from\nthe loads imparted during the ET0 (Earth To Orbit) phase, assembly, and overall stiffness requirements.\nTherefore, truss sections can serve different space missions with little or no change.\nThe material used for both the main propellant tank and the truss was an unnamed study designated advanced\nmaterial. This material was specified to have a strength three times greater than that of Aluminum.\n\nThermal Control Systems\nThere are three heat rejection systems for the HOPE vehicle: a low temperature radiator system for the avionics\nand crew, a medium temperature radiator for the power conversion system, and a high temperature radiatQr for\nthe propulsion system waste heat. These radiators are necessary due to the need to maintain the systems within\nrequired temperature limits and in space the only method of dumping waste heat is through radiation heat\ntransfer. All of the radiator systems use heat pipes to distribute the heat evenly across the panels. Figure xx is a\nsimplified schematic of the thermal control system for the power conversion system and the MTF engine.\nFigure 2. Schematic of Power Conversion and Engine Thermal Control Systems\n\nI\n\nk\n\nThermal radiators for spacecraft systems need to be as lightweight as possible. However, some of the vehicle\nsystem requirements force the thermal radiator system to be heavier than would be necessary provided there\nwas no other required functionality. The thermal radiator panels for advanced space vehicles of the type\ndescribed in this document tend have large surface areas, thus requiring that they be deployed prior to usage.\nDeployment mechanisms add weight to the panel. Also reliability and safety requirements will likely add\nweight to the system. Many have attempted to analytically model these panels with various heat transport\nmechanisms and materials technology to determine the weight of the system. Near term technology\nincorporates composite panels with heat pipes imbedded in the panels.\nEventually, for the system analysts, the input to model the radiator simplifies to a unit area or \xe2\x80\x9careal density\xe2\x80\x9d.\nFor advanced vehicles some analysts have estimated this unit weight be as low as 1 kg/m2 and as high as 20\nkg/m2. Of course, technology assumptions for the study affect this number. The more advanced the\ntechnology assumption the lower the unit weight. For HOPE the design team assumed near-to-mid term\ntechnology which led to the assumption that the high temperature radiator panels, with the deployment\nmechanisms, safety, and reliability, have a unit mass of 10 kg/m2 for single-sided or 5 kg/m2 for two-sided\npanels, while the medium temperature panels were assumed to weigh 8 kg/m2 (4 kg/m2). The low temperature\nradiator panels have an assumed unit mass of 3.7 kg/m2 for two-sided panels. As a comparison, the\nInternational Space Station radiator panels weigh 8.5 kg/m2 for two-sided panels.\nAnalyses performed to size the radiator panels assumed that the panels have a perfect view to space with no\nview of the Sun. Also the infrared emissivity (e) was assumed to be 0.9. Fin effectiveness was ignored and the\npanel was assumed to be at a constant average temperature.\nThe medium temperature radiator panels reject heat from the power conversion system at 800K. The panels\nemploy a combination of water and sodium-potassium heat pipes. The higher temperature Na-K heat pipes are\nat the cooling fluid inlet to radiator with the water heat pipes near the cooler end. The heat rejection\nrequirements vary with concepts analyzed, and panel surface areas and masses vary accordingly. These are\nsummarized below in Table xx.\nTable 1.

These panels use heat pipes\nthat have Lithium as a working fluid. The temperature of these panels is assumed to be 1250K. The heat is\ncollected in the propulsion system using a high temperature molten salt (FLiBe). The FLiBe passes through a\nheat exchanger to which the evaporator ends of the heat pipes are connected where it is cooled. The cooled\n\nfluid flows back in the engine completing the thermal control circuit. As with the medium temperature radiator\nthe heat rejection requirements vary with the vehicle concepts and are summarized below in Table xx.\nTable 2.

For long term missions passive insulation systems are massive accounting\nfor the propellant boil-off during the mission. Zero boil-off (ZBO) systems use a combination of active and\npassive thermal control to provide a minimum mass solution. ZBO systems comprise subsystems that include\nthe refrigerator, power system, controller, thermal radiator to reject the waste heat from the system and the\ninsulation system, which is composed of multi-layer insulation and foam. The combination of the insulation\nand refrigeration system is optimized to attain the minimum system mass taking into account the propellant.\nThe ZBO system sized for the HOPE mission uses today\xe2\x80\x99s cryo-cooler technology assuming 2-stage coolers for\nthe LH2 tanks. The mass and power calculations were based on research and analyses performed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nGlenn Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center and Ames Research Center. The analysis methodology\ntakes into account the mass of the propellant, the size (surface area) of the propellant tanks, the number of\npropellant tanks, the type of propellant, tank pressure, and environmental conditions. Using this methodology a\nZBO system was adequately sized to maintain the required cryogenic propellant for the HOPE mission.\n\nAuxiliary Power\nFor the HOPERASC studies, a liquid metal potassium Rankine system was selected for the power conversion\nmodule;. for both the solid pin lithium cooled reactor (LMR) reactor and the Molten Salt reactor concepts.\nPotassium Rankine systems are actually quite well characterized, as all of the major components (turbine,\ncondenser, alternator and heat exchangers) have undergone many hours of extensive ground testing. One\nadvantage of Rankine systems is that the heat is typically rejected at much higher temperatures (approximately\n900 O versus 425 O for a Brayton cycle). Thus, the radiator mass tends to be much smaller for Rankine\nK\nK\nsystems. This approximate \xe2\x80\x9cdoubling\xe2\x80\x9d of the heat rejection temperature allows the radiator mass to be reduced\napproximately by a factor of 16, since 24=16.\nEq. 1\n\nA picture of a liquid metal Rankine conversion system is shown below in Figure 3.\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x98m\nur*\nM\n\nFigure 3. Liquid metal Rankine conversion system\nA typical space system layout is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4. Liquid metal Rankine system NEP vehicle layout\nThe liquid metal potassium Rankine cycle is similar to the typical steam cycle employed by the commercial\nutility industry, except that potassium is used as the working fluid.\n\nThe computer program ALKSYS was used for the APU design. The following discussion is taken directly from\nthe ALKSYS users manual (ORNL-TM-10427).\nIn the power conversion system, the principal flow of dry, saturated potassium vapor leaving the\nboiler of the lithium-cooled reactor is diverted to the turbine of the turbo feed pump. As the vapor\nexpands through the main turbine, inter-stage and external separators are used to maintain the liquid\ncontent of the stream at < 12% to avoid the potential for erosion of the turbine blades. Upon exhausting\nfrom the turbine, the vapor is condensed in tapered annular spaces surrounding the evaporator sections\nof the radiator heat pipes. Condensate is drawn from the small ends of the condensing annuli by a jet\npump that is driven by a small stream of liquid taken from the discharge of the turbine driven feed\npump. Liquid discharging from the jet pump flows to the intake of the feed pump and is then pumped\nthrough the shell sides of a specified number of feed heaters (0 - 3) back to the boiler. One of the\nheaters is heated by feed pump turbine exhaust; other heaters, if more than one are specified, are heated\nby vapor extracted form appropriate stages in the main turbine or taken from the boiler outlet line if\nnecessary, to provide the specified boiler feed temperature.\n"\n\nTurbine blade tip velocity is a parameter that is dependent upon the strength of the turbine rotor\nmaterial and is treated as an input variable in the model to allow evaluation of the effects of advanced\nrotor materials. This parameter has a strong effect on turbine size and rotational speed, and therefore,\non the mass of the turbine and the generator.\nMost of the required input information for the ALKSYS code operation pertains to the power\nconversion sub-model. Input includes turbine inlet and outlet temperatures, dry stage efficiency for the\nturbine, and the number of stages of feed heating.\nThe code outputs a complete mass and energy balance for the power conversion subsystem, as well as\nmass estimates for the major components.\nThe major heat rejection load from the power system is from the power turbine condenser. The heat is\nrejected by a heat pipe radiator operating at a temperature somewhat lower than that of the condenser.\nA smaller heat rejection load from cooling of the reactor shield and the turbine generator, is rejected by\na low temperature heat pipe radiator.\nThe geometry of the radiators depends upon the power system rating. Input requirements for the heat\nrejection sub-model include launch vehicle bay dimensions and the operating temperature of the low\ntemperature radiator. Thermal loads for both parts of the radiator are provided by the power conversion\nsub-model, which provides dimensional information 1and the estimated mass of the heat rejection\nsystem.\nThe solid core reactor design is based on a fast spectrum, metallic-clad rod fuel element containing UN\npellets. The primary coolant is lithium, hence it is similar to the SP-100 genre. The ALKYS code limits\nthe peak pellet bum-up to 10 at % and the peak heat flux to 80 W/cm2. Rod diameter is determined by\nheat flux and burnup, but it is limited to 0.64 cm for mechanical stability. Reactor control is provided\nby in-core assemblies and by rotatable drums located around the core periphery. ASTAR-811C is used\nfor the fuel rod cladding and structural components operating at temperatures above 1100 K, and Nb1% Zr is used at lower temperatures. The design stress is two thirds of that which produces 1% creep\nduring the system lifetime.\n\nTwo options are available in the ALKSYS code for estimating shield size and mass. In the two-pi\noption, the shield configuration and dimensions are selected to provide a fast neutron fluence of l O I 3\nneutronslcm* and a total gamma dose of lo6 rad at a plane that is 15 m from and perpendicular to the\naxis of the cylindrical reactor vessel. The shield is thickest along the axis that faces the payload, but it\nalso covers the sides of the reactor to reduce scattered radiation. The two-pi shield utilizes layers of\nlithium hydride in a honeycomb matrix and tungsten. The second option utilizes an alternative shield\nconfiguration consisting of a thin layer of lithium hydride on all exposed surfaces of the reactor and a\nshadow shield of lithium hydride and tungsten that faces the payload. The shadow shield is selected to\nprovide a prescribed fluence of fast neutrons and gamma dose at a payload dose plane with given\ndiameter and distance from the reactor.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe ALKSYS code was used to estimate masses of the various subsystems of the vehicle. The lithium cooled\nUN reactor option was selected to provide mass estimates of the reactor and shield. The shadow shield\nconfiguration was selected with the same radiation requirements as imposed for the two-pi option as discussed\nabove.\n\nTrajectory Simulation\nThe computer program VARITOP [1,2] was the primary tool used for trajectory analysis in the HOPE study.\nVARITOP is a low-thrust trajectory optimization program that was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL) and first used in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s. It is now widely used at JPL, Glenn Research Center (GRC), and Marshall\nSpace Flight Center for preliminary mission design studies. It\xe2\x80\x99s sister program, SEPTOP, was used to provide\ntrajectory support for the Deep Space 1 mission.\nFor the heliocentric phase of the trajectory, VARITOP is a two-body, Sun-centered analysis tool. The planets\nare assumed massless, and targeting constraints match planetary positions and velocities relative to the Sun.\nThe problem solution involves numerical integration of the state and costate or variational equations and the\nsolution of a two-point boundary value problem to satisfy terminal constraints. The optimization, based on the\nCalculus of Variations, allows users to optimize many design variables. Departure date, flight time, and power\nrequired were some of the variables optimized in the HOPE mission analysis.\n\nVARITOP also offers several endpoint bias conditions that address the planetary departure and arrival phases of\nthe trajectory. Of these, the most useful for this study is the low-thrust escape or capture spiral bias. For this\noption, it is assumed that the spacecraft departs from or is captured into a circular orbit around the planet using\nonly the low thrust propulsion system. The formulation of the performance equations for these spiraling escape\nor capture maneuvers can be found in the paper, \xe2\x80\x9cPerformance Computations with Pieced Solutions of\nPlanetocentric and Heliocentric Trajectories for Low-Thrust Missions,\xe2\x80\x9d by Melbourne and Sauer [3].\nThe current version of VARITOP, VARITOP 2000, will do one spiral capture maneuver at the target body. The\nHOPE mission requires two. The capture maneuver at Jupiter consists of a spiral descent to the mean altitude of\nCallisto\xe2\x80\x99s orbit around Jupiter, and then another spiral around Callisto to descend to an orbit that is 500km\nabove Callisto\xe2\x80\x99s surface. For piloted vehicles, this same problem is encountered upon Callisto orbit departure,\nwhere two departure spiral maneuvers are required to escape Jupiter. The additional propellant needed for the\nCallisto spirals is calculated outside of VARITOP for the MPD missions. The fusion-powered missions\nrequired all spirals to be calculated outside of VARITOP.\n\nFor some combinations of vehicle acceleration and spiral initial or final altitude, the VARITOP spiraling\napproximations are not valid. This was the case for the fusion-powered missions considered. For those three\nfast missions, the initial vehicle acceleration was between 0.0005-0.0008 g\'s, with higher accelerations at\nsubsequent mission phases due to propellant depletion. Figure 5 [4] was used to approximate the velocity\nincrement needed to escape from or capture into planetocentric orbits for cases where VARITOP could not.\nThis figure was first generated by Sandorff [5] and is based on the work of Irving [6] and Tsien [7]\nFigure 5. Penalty for low thrust in escape maneuver from satellite orbit, as compared to impulsive thrust\n(tangentially directed thrust) [4]\n\n1.01\n\nTrajectory Summaries\nFusion Missions\nEach trajectory is optimized to give maximum payload for a given set of constraints and independent variables.\nFor the fusion-powered missions, the mission time was constrained to 650 days (excluding Earth escape and\ncapture times). This time was selected though a series of compromises. The team wanted to do a short mission\nto demonstrate the capabilities of the MTF device, however, maximizing payload mass typically means\nextending the trip time. Another consideration was the spacecraft\'s distance from the sun. Missions at 650\ndays or slightly less generally maintained a distance of 1 AU or more from the sun throughout the mission,\nwhile slightly longer missions got closer, meaning more radiation for the crew. In an attempt to limit the\nharmful radiation dose from the Sun, maintain a relatively short mission duration, and maximize payload\ndelivery, a 650-day mission was selected.\nWhile the mission duration was fixed, the flight time for the outbound and return trajectory legs was not. The\nfinal optimized missions have return trajectory legs that are shorter than the outbound trajectories. This is an\nexpected result because the vehicle has a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio on the return leg since most of the\npropellant has been used and most of the payload is left at Jupiter.\n\nVARITOP is also allowed to choose the power level and departure date that will optimize the mission\nperformance. The final results for the three fusion-powered vehicles considered are given below.\nD-D MTF 30-day Stay\nTable 3 D-D MTF 30-day Stay Summary Information\nTotal Mission Duration\n\n- 654 days\n\nMission Timeline\n\nOutbound Leg Departs 412212045\n\nTime\n\n-\n\nFlight to Callisto 33 1 days\n\nMass\n\n(days) (mT)\n\n-\n\nTime in Callisto Orbit 33 days\n\nDepart L1 Station\n\n0\n\n650\n\nTotal time thrusting 258 days\n\nThrust off\n\n51\n\n630\n\nReturns without Surface Habitat, ISRU, and Transport\n(120 mt total)\n\nThrust on\nArrive Callisto Orbit\n\n240\n331\n\n630\n595\n\nIsp = 70,400 sec\n\nDepart Callisto Orbit\n\n365\n\n475\n\nJet Power = 1.072 GW\n\nThrust off\n\n440\n\n445\n\nPropulsion System Specific Mass = 0.046 k g k W\n\nThrust on\n\n614\n\n445\n\nInitial Acceleration\n\nArrive L1 Station\n\n654\n\n430\n\n-\n\n= 0.0005\n\ng\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nFinal Acceleration = 0.0007 g\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nFigure 6 Trajectory Graph for D-D MTF 30-day Stay Option\n\nD-D MTF 1SO-day Stay\nTable 4.

Cargo (surface habitat, ISRU, and transport vehicle) is\npredeployed on a separate vehicle from the crew. The trajectory optimization method is the same for both\nvehicles. The flight time for both vehicles was modeled after the Glenn Research Center team\xe2\x80\x99s MPD missions.\nThis was done so that the effects of different technologies between the cases could be analyzed. For these\ntrajectories, VARITOP was able to approximate the Jupiter capture and escape spirals, while the Earth and\nCallisto capture and escape spirals had to be approximated outside of the program. The Earth spirals, because\nthe altitude at L1 in combination with the thrust-to-weight ratio of the vehicle was outside of the applicability of\nVARITOP\xe2\x80\x99s approximation technique, and Callisto, because VARITOP can only spiral about the destination\nplanet of Jupiter.\n\nMPD Thrusters\nThe Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster is a member of the electromagnetic class of electric propulsion\nsystems. These thrusters use electromagnetic forces to accelerate its plasma propellant to speeds in excess of 50\nkm/sec. With specific impulse values reaching 5,000 seconds and thrust values up to 2 Newton, the MPD\nthruster has a very competitive performance when compared to other electric propulsion systems.\n\nAn MPD thruster makes use of coaxially arranged electrodes consisting of a center spike cathode and an outer\nannular anode. An inert gas such as Xenon is flown between the electrodes via a rear injector plate. An electric\npotential is applied across the electrodes great enough to ionize the gas. Once ionized, the gas becomes\nelectrically conductive and a current flows from the anode through the gas and to the cathode. This current,\nalong with the electrode geometry, produces an induced circular magnetic field between the electrodes. The\nresulting Lorentz force caused by the electric and magnetic field accelerates the ionized gas (plasma) in a\ndirection perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields. It is this force that is responsible for producing\nthrust.\nThe arc discharge between the two electrodes produces a large amount of heat that raises the temperature of the\nthruster. Most of this heat must be removed by a cooling system to protect the materials. Some MPD thrusters\nare designed to use this heat to produce additional thrust by thermodynamic expansion. Some MPD thrusters\nare also augmented by including an external magnetic coil wrapped around the thruster. This coil increases the\nfield strength of the induced circular magnetic field in between the electrodes and can improve performance.\nFigure 9. Schematic of MPD thruster\n\nAdvances in MPD performance are being pursued by going to higher power systems and using Hydrogen gas as\nthe propellant. Because hydrogen has a light molecular weight, it can exhaust at a higher velocity and result in\nlarger values of specific impulse. It is speculated that specific impulse values as high as 10,000 seconds may be\nachievable, but this remains to be seen. Although most MPD thrusters tested to date operate at hundreds of\nKilowatts, it may be possible to push their power levels as high as Megawatts. The efficiency of these thrusters\nranges between 30% to 50% of the input power being converted into jet power.\nThe limiting factors of the MPD thruster are based on the plasma physics inside the electrical discharge. For an\nMPD thruster, most of the losses are associated with the thermal energy created by the high current passing\nthrough the plasma. The plasma has an electrical resistance based on the level of ionization that is determined\nby the voltage across the electrodes. The higher the voltage, the more current passes through the plasma, the\nstronger the induced magnetic field, and the more thrust produced. Performance is limited by the geometry of\nthe electrodes, the electrical properties of the propellant, and the magnetic Reynolds number.\nIn order for the propellant to be ionized, a strong enough electric field must be applied. This is essentially a\nfunction of the density of the gas, the voltage potential across the electrodes, and the distance between the\nelectrodes. These relations govern the mass flow rate, power, and size combinations available to a thruster.\n\nThe Specific Impulse of the thruster is limited by the magnetic Reynolds number. This is a nondimensional\nnumber that represents the ratio of the convective properties of a magnetic field in moving plasma with the\nability of a magnetic field to diffuse through the plasma. For plasma moving through a stationary magnetic\nfield, a magnetic Reynolds number less than one indicates that the plasma can move freely through the magnetic\nfield. The limit of this case is when the magnetic Reynolds number equals unity. In this case, the speed of the\nmoving plasma and the rate at which the magnetic field can diffuse through the plasma are equal. If the\nmagnetic Reynolds number becomes greater than unity, the magnetic field is dragged along with the moving\nplasma and produces a drag force on the plasma flow. This will result in a loss of performance. This may also\nlead to instabilities within the plasma that can further reduce performance and thruster life.\nThe life limiting parts of the thruster are the electrodes. The high currents cause sputtering of the electrode\nmaterial that eventually reduces performance to an unacceptable level. The best erosion rate achievable with\ncurrent models is 0.5 nanograms per ampere per second or a sputtering of one atom for every 5E6 ions collected\non the electrodes. This limits the integrated impulse to approximately lo6 Newton seconds.\n\nThe final results for the two MPD vehicles considered are given below.\nMSR-LMR-MPD\nTable 6 Cargo MSR-LMR-MPD 120-day Stay Summary Information\nTotal Mission Duration\n\n- 1120 days\n\nMission Timeline\n\nOutbound Leg Departs 9/2/204 1\nTotal time thrusting\n\nTime\n(days)\n\n- 588 days\n\nMass\n(mT)\n\nIsp = 8,000 sec\n\nDepart L1 Station\n\n0\n\n456\n\nTotal Power = 11 MW\n\nThrust off\n\n329\n\n390\n\nJet Power = 7 MW\n\nThrust on\n\n861\n\n390\n\nPropulsion System Specific Mass = 5.36 kg/kW\n\nArrive Callisto Orbit\n\n1120\n\n337\n\nTable 7 MSR-LMR-MPD 120-day Stay Summary Information\nTotal Mission Duration\n\n- 1661 days\n\nMission Timeline\n\nOutbound Leg Departs 11/19/2044\n\nTime\n\nMass\n\n(days)\n\n(mT)\n\n- 832 days\nTime in Callisto Orbit - 120 days\nTotal time thrusting - 8 12 days\n\nDepart L1 Station\n\n0\n\n1072\n\nThrust off\n\n34\n\n1049\n\nReturns with 13 mt less consumables\n\nThrust on\n\n60\n\n1049\n\nIsp = 8,000 sec\n\nThrust off\n\n2 84\n\n897\n\nTotal Power = 37 MW\n\nThrust on\n\n593\n\n897\n\nJet Power = 24 MW\n\nArrive Callisto Orbit\n\n832\n\n735\n\nPropulsion System Specific Mass = 5.36 kgkW\n\nDepart Callisto Orbit\n\n952\n\n722\n\nInitial Acceleration\n\nThrust off\n\n1145\n\n591\n\nThrust on\n\n1540\n\n591\n\nArrive L1 Station\n\n1661\n\n509\n\nFlight to Callisto\n\nFinal Acceleration\n\n= 0.0001\n= 0.0001\n\ng\xe2\x80\x99s\n\ng\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nFigure 10 Trajectory Graph for SCR-LMR-MPD 120-day Stay Option\n\nConfiguration Design\nThe HOPE vehicle configuration is designed for launch on a Delta IV type expendable launch vehicle. Multiple\nlaunches and in-space assembly will be required due to the overall size and mass of the vehicle. The payload\nenvelope of the launch vehicle is assumed to be approximately 5.0 meters in diameter by 17.0 meters long.\nThe major components of the MTF baseline vehicle are the six liquid hydrogen (LH2) tanks, the deuterium\ntank, the reaction control system (RCS) thrusters and propellant tanks, dual two-sided radiators for high\ntemperature, medium temperature, and crew/avionics heat rejection, a SP-100 reactor, four deuterium-tritium\ntanks, and a water filled tank which provides radiation shielding for the vehicle. A single magnetized target\nfusion (MTF) engine is located at the aft end of the vehicle. The HOPE vehicle payload consists of a surface\nhabitat module, a transhab module, a lander, and an ISRU. Structural support of the HOPE vehicle components\n\nis provided by open truss segments. The main propellant tank cluster has additional support at the forward and\naft ends. The payload modules dock to a single node located at the forward end of the vehicle.\nFigure 11.
