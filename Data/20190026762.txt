Deliveries are unscheduled and routed as online orders are placed\n\nUse case 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Air metro\nResembles current public transit options such as subways and buses, with pre-determined\nroutes, regular schedules, and set stops in high traffic areas throughout each city. Vehicles are\nautonomously operated and can accommodate 2 to 5 passengers at a time, with an average\nload of 3 passengers per trip\n\nUse case 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Air taxi\nThe air taxi use case is a near-ubiquitous (or door-to-door) ridesharing operation that allows\nconsumers to call vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (VTOLs) to their desired pickup locations\nand specify drop-off destinations at rooftops throughout a given city. Rides are unscheduled\nand on demand like ridesharing applications today. Like the air metro case, vehicles are\nautonomously operated and can accommodate 2 to 5 passengers at a time, with an average\nload of 1 passenger per trip\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n5\n\nStudy findings\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Near-market segments: A commercially viable market for last-mile parcel\ndelivery and air metro could be in place by 2030\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Likely market constraint: There is likely a limited potential market for air taxis in\nconcentrated areas of high net worth individuals and businesses in 2030\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Key challenges: For UAM to be viable, it is necessary to address the technical,\n\nphysical, operational, and integration challenges of a highly interdependent systemof-systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dependencies for the market to become viable:\n\xe2\x80\x93 Safety and security\n\xe2\x80\x93 Economics\n\xe2\x80\x93 Transportation demand\n\xe2\x80\x93 Regulation\n\xe2\x80\x93 Market substitutes (e.g., autonomous delivery and transportation)\n\xe2\x80\x93 Public acceptance\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\nContents\n\n\xe2\x96\xaa Market analysis by McKinsey & Company\n\xe2\x96\xaa Public acceptance by McKinsey & Company\n\xe2\x80\xa2 UAM regulatory environment by Ascension Global\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Potential barriers by Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Lab\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Moving forward by Crown Consulting\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n7\n\nMARKET ANALYSIS\n\nFindings are informed by interviews, surveys and research\nEconometric model\n\xef\x82\xa7 Algorithm to test economic viability of UAM (3 separate use cases), incorporate consumer (and business) demand and\nwillingness to pay; UAM industry costs (including over 50 variables); weather and technical constraints; and evolution\nof costs over time\n\xef\x82\xa7 Adaptable and \xe2\x80\x98living\xe2\x80\x99 parametric model that allows ARMD to continually update key data items as the market evolves\n\nOver 200 expert/executive interviews, including with:\nDirector of Product, Aircraft company\n\nFormer General Manager, Aircraft company\n\nFormer Sr. Manufacturing Engineer, Automotive company\n\nFormer Technical Operations Manager, Retailer\n\nFormer Field Operations Manager, UAS company\n\nCurrent Chairman of UAS association\n\nFormer CEO, Global Freight Forwarding, Logistics company Head of Business Development, Logistics company\n\nSurvey with 2,000+ consumer/business respondents\n\xef\x82\xa7 Current transportation and delivery spend by consumer\nincome and age\n\xef\x82\xa7 Consumer willingness to pay for increased speed across\nboth transportation and delivery use cases by income,\nage, and average trip duration\n\xef\x82\xa7 Public acceptance of UAS technology, broadly, and\ntransportation and delivery UAM options, specifically\n\nFormer Sr. Manager, Retail company\n\nManager, C-UAV company\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 Current B2B delivery spend by company size and speed\npreferences\n\nFormer President and CEO, Helipad company\n\nVP of Sales, UAS company\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 Business willingness to pay for increased delivery speed\n\nChief Marketing Officer, UAS company\n\nCOO, Aircraft company\n\nFormer Group Leader, Aircraft company\n\nProgram Manager, Defense company\n\nFounder, Aircraft company\n\nDirector of Technology, Logistics company\n\nFormer Regional Operations Manager, Logistics company\n\nFormer Managing Director, Automotive company\n\n\xe2\x96\xaa\n\xe2\x96\xaa\n\nFormer VP of Engineering, and Systems, UAS company\n\nFormer Head of Operations, Ground robotics company\n\nFormer Director of Global Bus.

Although under current constraints the model suggests that air taxis are unprofitable for widespread consumption, there are a few\npossible scenarios wherein an air taxi business may be viable that could be considered\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Additionally, although it may be unprofitable in 2030, the synergies between delivery and air metro infrastructure investments (i.e.,\n\nUTM, vertiports), as well as investment in technologies leading to cost declines (i.e., batteries, sensing systems) may lead to a post2030 follow-on market\n\nThe air taxi vision proposed in this model requires nearly ubiquitous infrastructure that is unlikely to be achieved in 2030\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 To satisfy the vision of creating a taxi system (i.e., door to door, unscheduled) the model assumes there is a walking time of less\nthan 3 minutes to a stop at any time, which makes widespread infrastructure costs across all MSAs unlikely by 2030\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Technology and infrastructure required is nearly identical to the air metro use case, though the air taxi model requires a greater\ndensity of vertistops to satisfy people\xe2\x80\x99s need for nearly door-to-door service\n\nAlthough this market may not be ubiquitous in 2030 there is the possibility for localized profitability:\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 In some highly-dense areas (i.e., Manhattan, Boston, SF, Miami, Philadelphia) there may be an opportunity for profitability where\na limited number of vertistops would be able to effectively serve certain populations\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 There may also be an initial market that primarily serves

>2,500 consumers surveyed report they are comfortable with unmanned aerial\ntechnology; approximately 25% of consumers report they will not use UAS or eVTOLs when services\nbecome widely available. This means that nearly half of all consumers surveyed are potentially\ncomfortable with delivery and UAM use cases\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAcross all unmanned aerial use cases, concerns from consumers fall into 5 major categories: safety,\nprivacy, job security, environmental threats, and noise and visual disruption\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 When it comes to UAS last-mile delivery, consumers are specifically concerned about safety (e.g.,\nvehicles malfunctioning and damaging people and property), theft of packages, and invasion of\nprivacy from vehicle camera systems\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 In UAM transport cases, consumers are most concerned about the safety of both passengers and\nbystanders and prohibitively high costs associated with operations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConsumers cite proven safety records and demonstrations as factors that would most increase their\nlevel of comfort with UAM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA comprehensive strategy to address public concerns may include targeted technology R&D, unified\nmessaging to counteract misinformation, proactive engagement with interest groups, and large-scale\ndemonstrations of use case capabilities\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n22\n\nPUBLIC ACCEPTANCE\n\nPublic concerns generally fall into five categories\nSafety\nConsumers distrust autonomous technology and are not aware of safety\nsystems in place\n\nPrivacy\nCivil liberties groups have privacy concerns with widespread UAM adoption but\nmay misunderstand how camera equipment is used in sensing system technology\n\nJobs\nThere is concern that autonomous technology will render jobs obsolete across\nmultiple industries\n\nEnvironment\nWaste buildup from batteries, impact on wildlife, and energy usage concern\nyounger consumers\n\nNoise and visual disruption\nAuditory and visual disturbances in residential neighborhoods are likely to create\nstrong, localized pushback as the market expands\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM

scalable UAM would entail:\n\xe2\x80\x93 Last-mile delivery is heavily restricted and permitted only through the use of waivers and pilot programs\n\xe2\x80\x93 Air metro and air taxi regimes are permitted only as traditional manned helicopter services, which leave out critical components of their\nbusiness cases (e.g., autonomy, eVTOL design)\nHowever, the DOT Integration Pilot Program (IPP) is opening up opportunities for expanding last-mile delivery pilots. Enabling last-mile\ndelivery, air metros, and air taxis requires addressing five major categories of regulation:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Air traffic & fleet operations management\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vehicle development & production\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Airspace design & implementation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Individual vehicle management & operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Community integration\nThe majority of regulatory requirements reside at the Federal level under the jurisdiction of the FAA, DOT, and DHS; however, there is likely to\nbe significant state and local involvement in certain areas in the form of registration requirements for operators and vehicles, zoning and\ninfrastructure requirements, and local ordinances. Absent significant changes, the timeline for the regulatory climate to be in place for scalable\noperations is in the near-term (~2 to 5 years) for last-mile delivery and mid- to long-term (~ 10 or more years) for air metro and air taxi.\nLeveraging innovative risk management approaches, such as safety management systems (SMS) and selected industry self-regulation, can\nhelp accelerate these timelines, but the rulemaking process itself remains the long pole in the tent for getting the required regulation in place\nAs NASA considers structuring a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and launching the Grand Challenge, it can evaluate several\nopportunities to help facilitate the regulatory process:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Help foster cooperation between agencies by leveraging the PPP to convene the right agencies and focus on critical path issues\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lead the way on innovative PPPs by facilitating key PPPs on technology, regulatory collaboration, and investment through the alliance\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Help government and industry develop and execute effective and coordinated public engagement campaigns\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Partner with industry on key technologies required to enable UAM operations\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n27\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nLast-mile delivery operations are limited and governed primarily\nby Part 107 and supporting waivers and COAs\nCurrent commercial small UAS (sUAS) operations are\ngoverned under Part 1071\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vehicles: Aircraft <55 lbs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operators: require Part 107 certification for commercial\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\napplications; must be 16 years old and pass an in-person\nknowledge exam and TSA screening\nOperations:\n\xe2\x80\x93 Aircraft must remain within visual line of sight\n\xe2\x80\x93 Fly at or below 400 feet\n\xe2\x80\x93 No flights over people\n\xe2\x80\x93 Flights only permitted during daylight or civil twilight\n\xe2\x80\x93 Must yield right of way to manned aircraft\n\xe2\x80\x93 Fly at or below 100 mph\n\xe2\x80\x93 Fly only in Class G airspace2\n\xe2\x80\x93 Cannot operate from a moving aircraft\n\xe2\x80\x93 Cannot operate from a moving ground vehicle, unless in\nsparsely populated areas\nLast-mile delivery operations may soon be governed by an\nexemption to Part 135 through the IPP3\n\nExpanded operations are permitted on a case-by-case\nbasis with waivers and COAs\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Part 107 waivers are available to organizations for expanded\n\n\xe2\x96\xaa\n\noperations (e.g., Enhanced Visual Line of Sight (EVLOS),\nnighttime operations, etc.)\n\xe2\x80\x93 In order to get a waiver, organizations must develop a\ncredible safety case that is reviewed and accepted by the\nFAA\n\xe2\x80\x93 To date, there have been over 1,815 waivers granted to\norganizations around the U.S. for expanded operations4\nPublic Certificates or Waivers of Authorization (COA)s are\nanother avenue for expanded operations available to public\nsector entities\n\xe2\x80\x93 To date, over 70 COAs have been issued to public entities\naround the U.S.4\n\xe2\x80\x93 Public agencies are allowed to operate either under\nblanket COAs or under Part 107 depending on their\noperations and preference\n\n1 Section 336 is an alternative means of compliance for recreational users operating as hobbyist / aircraft modelers. Operating under this regime significantly lessens the regulatory requirements (e.g., no Part 107 license\nrequired), but cannot be used by commercial entities or commercial operations. However, proposed legislation to amend section 336 is currently in the senate as part of the FAA re-authorization bill, which may change the\nregulatory authority of the FAA over these groups.\n2 The Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) program is starting to facilitate operations in controlled airspace (Airspace B, C, D, and E).\n3 Integration Pilot Program. 4 As of May

regulation will need to be put in\nplace to govern technical standards for\nautonomous mission management systems,\nand standards and protocols for\nautonomous operations\n\nIndividual Vehicle Management & Operations\n\nRegistration\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n39\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nFuture regulation will likely marry sUAS and manned\ncommercial rules\n\xe2\x96\xaa This process is likely to be time consuming and labor intensive, and completed in a series of incremental steps.\nBoth legs of this evolution will require significant updates to many existing Parts that interact with different components of UAM operations\n\nPart 107 (sUAS) evolution\nLast-mile\ndelivery\n\nAir metro\nand air taxi\n\n1 Visual Flight Rules\n\nLast-mile delivery applications will likely be\nprimarily an evolution of Part 107 (sUAS)\nregulations\n\n+\n\nManned commercial evolution\nLast-mile delivery will likely entail revisions to Part 135\nCurrently, last-mile delivery operations for the IPP are\nexpected to operate under Part 135\n\nThe vehicles, operations, and airspace concerns\nthat regulators are currently tackling for sUAS\nmore broadly are directly applicable to last-mile\ndelivery, and therefore, will likely be addressed in\nlarge part by evolutions of Part 107\n\nMany components of last-mile delivery will borrow from\nevolutions of manned standards (for example, operator\ncertification, should it be adopted, is likely to borrow\nfrom existing operator certification standards for\ncommercial operations)\n\nSome of the standards and regulatory precedent\nwill likely be borrowed from or based on evolutions\nof Part 107 for key technologies, systems, and\noperations that are shared between sUAS and Air\nTaxi or Air Metro regimes (e.g., UTM designs and\nstandards, battery safety standards, Designated\nApproving Authority [DAA] technology standards)\n\nAir Metro and Air Taxi use cases will likely borrow part\nof their regulatory frameworks from existing manned\ncommercial operations (e.g., Parts 135, 91)\nMany of these Parts already tackle the beginnings of\nautomation, but none of them are a perfect fit for UAM\noperations. For example, even manned rotorcraft\noperations fail to address scalable UAM because they\nrely primarily on VFR1\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n40\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nRegulatory progress faces challenges\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Time-consuming regulatory processes. The regulatory process struggles to keep pace with the speed of\n\ninnovation and demands from industry, many of whom are unfamiliar with aviation and the regulatory process\nassociated with it. The rulemaking process is inherently collaborative, and requires community engagement and\nreview as well as compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act. This creates a lengthy process for something\nlike UAM, which is a complex and multifaceted issue requiring multiple rulemakings and Part updates\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Resource constraints for the regulators. The regulatory process is labor intensive, and regulators face tight\nresource constraints, large workloads, and multiple demands on their time\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pressure to move more quickly. Regulators are under significant pressure to move more quickly, but not at the cost\nof safety, given perceptions that the US is being \xe2\x80\x9coutpaced\xe2\x80\x9d in this arena, and industry concerns around enabling\ncommercial markets\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Open development needs for key technologies. Many technologies are simply not there yet in terms of capabilities\nand performance to fill certain functions that are required for safe and reliable operations (e.g., DAA, GPS-denied\nenvironment navigation, etc.). Absent reliable technologies for these functions, regulators cannot set reasonable or\nreliable safety standards for key UAM operations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 State and local pre-emption. In lieu of clear Federal rules and guidance, there is likely to be more unilateral action\ntaken by State and Local authorities. This risks causing a more complex and fragmented regulatory landscape to\nmanage and navigate in the future\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n41\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nFull-scale last-mile delivery is currently near-term timeframe\nImmediate (~0-24 months)\n\nNear-term (~2-5 years)\n\nMid-term (~5-10 years)\n\nLong-term (~10+ years)\n\nOperator certification\n\nAir Traffic & Fleet\nOperations\n\nOperator licensing\nUTM requirements\nsUAS vehicle certification\n\nVehicle\n\nContinuing airworthiness\nAirspace integration\nZoning restrictions\n\nAirspace System\nDesign &\nImplementation\n\nAltitude restriction\nCybersecurity\nInfrastructure requirements\nRegistration\n\nIndividual\nVehicle\nManagement &\nOperations\nCommunity\n\nWeight restriction\n\nIdentification\nPilot certification\nBVLOS\n\nAutonomous flight\n\nFlight above people\nNoise requirements\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\nLikely timeframe for starting scalable operations\n\n42\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nFull-scale air metro and air taxi are currently mid- to long-term\nImmediate (~0-24 months)\n\nNear-term (~2-5 years)\n\nMid-term (~5-10 years)\n\nLong-term (~10+ years)\n\nOperator certification1\n\nAir Traffic &\nFleet Operations\n\nOperator licensing1\nUAM TM & airspace integration\nFleet management\neVTOL vehicle certification\n\nVehicle\n\nContinuing airworthiness\nZoning restrictions\n\nAirspace System\nDesign &\nImplementation\nIndividual\nVehicle\nManagement &\nOperations\n\nCybersecurity\nInfrastructure requirements\nRegistration\nSurveillance\nPilot certification2\n\nCommunity\n\nAutonomous flight\nNoise requirements\n\n1 Currently possible for manned operations under Parts 135 and 121;

building these\nprotocols for UAS operators allows for faster approvals for operations and can accelerate expansion\nand scaling of UAM operations in the NAS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Regulators may be able to leverage industry self-regulation in certain areas to help accelerate the\npace of adoption and implementation of UAM technologies and operations\n\nFacilitating\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Industry is often able to move more quickly than regulators in adopting consensus standards as\nopposed to putting standards through the rulemaking process; as a result, there are certain areas\nselected industry\nwhere industry consensus standards or industry-driven self-regulation could help alleviate some of\nself-regulation\n\nthe burden of the regulatory process, and accelerate adoption and implementation while maintaining\nthe highest safety standard\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insurance requirements may provide an effective avenue for industry self-regulation; should the FAA\nrequire operators to carry certain insurance limits, insurance companies will help the industry selfregulate as they will be unwilling to insure unsafe operators1\n\n1 This avenue would require significant confidence in insurers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to accurately assess and quantify risk in UAM operations.\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n44\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe UAM regulatory process remains time-consuming\nThe rulemaking process itself moves very slowly\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The process is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthree associated executive orders (12866, 13563, and 13579)\nAviation rulemaking normally will take 38 to 42 months or more for a\nsignificant rule, and 30 months for a less significant rule.\nThere are 3 formal stages to rulemaking (pre-rule, proposed rule, and final\nrule), but there are 9 distinct steps to the end-to-end process\nThis process is very detailed and requires strict compliance with the\nrequirements and analyses under each stage, and is very time and labor\nintensive as a result; there are some steps that have historically acted as\nchokepoints for rulemaking (e.g., time intensity for adjudicating comments,\nOST approval, OMB approval)\nThe rulemaking timelines for something as robust as UAM tend to be\nextended due to the requirements for compliance with each stage of this\nprocess for each individual rule and rule update that is undertaken\nRulemaking can take longer at FAA compared to other agencies or\ndepartments because coordination is required with both DOT and the\nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)\nSome agencies tend to operate under de-facto numerical limits on how\nmany rules it can send each year to OIRA\nEven \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d rules (e.g., Part 23 re-write) suffer from the perception that\nrules are bad and fewer new regulations is better; \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d rules often get\nheld because other rules, especially if mandated by Congress, take\npriority\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAccelerating the regulatory timeline\nGiven the APA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, going through the\ntraditional process will lead to long timelines for\nUAM regulation to be in place\nWithin APA, a potentially significant reduction in\nthe time needed for rulemakings may be\npossible by more closely involving DOT, OIRA,\nand other relevant government agencies in the\ndevelopment and drafting of rules\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Once the draft rules are complete, there could\nbe concurrent agency review with an\nabbreviated period for comments\nSome other potential avenues for acceleration,\nshould legislators or regulators choose to pursue\nthem:\n\xe2\x80\x93 Congressional delegation of some airspace\nregulatory jurisdiction to state and local\ngoverning authorities\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Regulator delegation of specific issues to\n\nindustry consensus standards bodies or to\nstate and local governing authorities\n\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers from the UAM models, and should only be considered in conjunction with models\n\n45\n\nUAM REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nPrinciples for a progressive and effective UAM regulatory regime\nFostering cooperation among agencies. Many of these issues are inter-agency challenges (e.g., cybersecurity will require FAA,\nDHS, DOJ, and DOD cooperation at a minimum) and will require effective coordination and governance in order to be successful\nDeveloping innovative Public Private Partnerships. USDOT have already started this process by setting up a FACA in the form of\nthe DAC and launching initiatives like Pathfinder, IPP, and LAANC. However, true success in this arena is going to require more\ninnovative P3 structures like these that allow for more agile co-development, testing, and standard-setting opportunities\nAdopting performance-based regulations. Given the pace of technological change likely to be seen in the UAM industry, building\nperformance-based regulations are going to be critical to enabling innovation. The FAA has already begun the transition to this form of\nregulation with the 14 CFR Part 23 rewrite; this kind of approach will be critical to UAM\nImplementing forward-leaning risk management approaches. Regulators can operate more efficiently by delegating details of\nsafety and risk mitigation to operators who have approved Safety Management Systems (SMS). SMS in conjunction with facilitating\nselected industry self-regulation can help improve efficiency of the regulatory process across the UAM ecosystem\nAcknowledging that politics are local. Although the regulatory authority is primarily Federal, local communities are going to be a\nmajor factor in the integration and adoption of UAM technologies and operations. Local sentiments will dictate both the market adoption\nrates and what ordinances are created, as well as the resulting ease of integration\nDeveloping new methods that match the new face of aviation. The UAM and UAS industries are much more vast and fragmented\nthan the traditional manned aviation landscape. The ecosystem is larger and contains a much wider range of corporate sophistication\nand background than ever before. This means that some of the old ways of doing business may no longer be sustainable and new\nsolutions will need to be developed to help the full ecosystem develop and operate unmanned aircraft safely

cases likely requires a holistic approach\nthat considers UAM\xe2\x80\x99s complex ecosystem\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 This study used over 100 discrete assumptions for the use cases (from the cost of\nsensing systems, to battery efficiency, to weather estimates in the 15 US cities\nstudied)\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Many of the most significant challenges to UAM are regulatory or policy-related\n\nacross multiple governmental entities and would likely need to address evolving\ntechnologies\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThere is an opportunity to coordinate planning for UAM research with industry needs\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPublic acceptance of UAM is likely to be more complicated than asking popular opinion;\nlocal policy, interest groups and research (for example, on noise) each play a major role\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 No single actor (public or private) has emerged yet as the UAM industry convener\n\xe2\x80\x93 Market participants do not yet agree on the vision for each UAM use case\n\nAll

parcel delivery may be a profitable market with ~500M UAS deliveries at a price\npoint near ~$4.20 per delivery by 2030, economic break-even point around 2030\nAir metro may be profitable in 2028, with ~750M passenger trips by 2030 at a price of ~$30\nper trip across the 15 major metro areas\n\nViability of these markets will likely

a\nbig concern\n\nQuote\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worried about a simple glitch in the system that could potentially shut it down. I\'ve never even heard of a safety system in place on\na UAV in case of failure \xe2\x80\x93 are there parachutes? Airbags? These are the things I need to see and hear and know about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cComputers fail all the time. Systems go down. I want to know that if this were to occur, that there would be a back-up system in\nplace to manually control the aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worry that given how little we really understand about cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles could be hijacked by hacking the flight\nsystems. I know regular cars have computer systems that can be hacked, but I do have a strong lingering apprehension about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cHackers could hijack the system and either kill people or steal the goods\xe2\x80\xa6they could also be used to deliver something harmful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they will be harmful to birds and bats, I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about wildlife and the environment in general. I would think this technology\nwould increase injury to birds/wildlife and disruption to their nesting or flight patterns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy main concern would be energy efficiency and environmental impact. It just seems like flying things would require a lot more fuel and\npower\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cMy biggest concern is that they will cut jobs for people that currently drive for transportation or delivery services... This technology\nwill take away jobs from people who make their living providing these services.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy main concern is the impact this will have on job opportunities for people. If this takes off, there will be no need for humans to do\nthese jobs. What becomes of the people whose jobs are in transportation and delivery services?\xe2\x80\x9d\nOther concerns surfaced in interviews and press searches include theft of goods, privacy, and noise

and that younger consumers may be the first to adopt\n\nTakeaway\nIndustry could\nmarket autonomous\nsafety more\neffectively\n\nEarly accidents may\ncatalyze public\nresistance\n\nPrivacy concerns\nmay stem from lack\nof understanding\n\nYounger consumers\nmay be more\naccepting of\nautonomous\ntechnology\n\nQuote\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight now no one is getting the message across that this technology isn\xe2\x80\x99t just safe, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually safer than current options\xe2\x80\xa6people in\nthe industry should be working on a market campaign today because public acceptance of this fact will be slow\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re confident that not having pilots fly these vehicles will be much safer and more reliable, but people initially will not trust automated\nsystems\xe2\x80\xa6Just like with the automation of elevators, people are not going to like it at first\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cDemonstrating the robustness of the safety of air taxis is key\xe2\x80\xa6if there is an accident during early pilot programs in a place with less\nstringent regulation, consumers in the US will get scared away from the technology\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cDrone manufacturers have not yet created sufficient redundancy and safety systems, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t put enough thought into counterUAS\xe2\x80\xa6the public is not going to respond well if the industry can\xe2\x80\x99t answer these questions of security and accidents happen\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we hosted town halls, people were bringing extreme and unrealistic concerns about their privacy \xe2\x80\x93 they came in assuming we\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have any data management plan and that we had not thought through how to protect privacy in any way\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have an immediate negative reaction to the idea of cameras on drones\xe2\x80\xa6even when we explain the methods we use for\nprotecting privacy on paper, people still need to hear that reassurance in-person\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you see the split is between people younger than 25 and older than 25\xe2\x80\xa6the younger demographic is completely accepting of\nautonomous technology, and that divide is only going to increase as other autonomous technology like cars becomes ubiquitous\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cMillennials are the key to the market since they\xe2\x80\x99re used to the technology\xe2\x80\xa6once you get them on board, they can introduce it to older\nmembers of their families to make them more comfortable\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSOURCE: Expert interviews, press search\nAll numbers or assumptions in these materials represent an internally consistent set of numbers
