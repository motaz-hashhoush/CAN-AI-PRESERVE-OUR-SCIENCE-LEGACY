Sprag handle\nwrenches are so named because they\nwould include components that would\n\nfunction both as parts of handles and as\nsprags (roller locking/unlocking components). In comparison with all of the\naforementioned conventional wrenches,\nproperly designed sprag handle\nwrenches could operate with much less\nbacklash; in comparison with the conDrive-Head Housing\n(Part of Frame)\n\nOuter Sprag\n\nInner Sprag\n\nFrame\n\nAssembly Screw\n\nDrive\n\nA\n\nA\n\nOuter Sprag\n\nInner Sprag\n\nSection A-A\n\nDrive\n\nTOP, SIDE AND SECTIONAL VIEWS\nClockwise\nFree Rotation\n\nDrive-Head Housing\n(Part of Frame)\n\nInner Sprag\n\nOuter Sprag\n\nDrive\n\nFrame\nCounterclockwise\nTorquing\n\nSCHEMATIC TOP VIEW ILLUSTRATING PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\n\nA Basic Sprag Handle Wrench would be a low-backlash, \xe2\x80\x9cclickless\xe2\x80\x9d ratcheting wrench that would offer\nadvantages over conventional pawl-and-ratchet, sprag, and cam wrenches \xe2\x80\x94 essential when working\nin tight places.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nventional clickless wrenches, sprag handle wrenches could be stronger and less\nexpensive (because the sprags would be\nlarger and more easily controllable than\nare conventional sprags and cams).\nA basic sprag handle wrench, shown\nin the upper part of the figure, would include the following parts:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A frame that would constitute both the\ndrive-head housing and part of the\nhandle,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A drive that would rotate freely within\nthe drive-head housing except when\nengaged by sprags,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An outer sprag that would constitute\nthe rest of the handle, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An inner sprag that would engage the\nouter sprag at its outer end and the\ndrive head at its inner end.\nThe frame would include a gap, into\nwhich the two sprags could be placed.\nTaken together, the inner sprag, the\ndrive-head housing, and the drive would\nconstitute the drive head. The inner and\nouter sprags would act as a roller-locking/unlocking pair that would afford\nlow-backlash ratcheting, as described\nbelow.\nOmitted from the figure for the sake\nof clarity are gear-tooth-based roller surfaces, on the sprags and in the frame,\nthat would ensure the proper alignment\nand engagement between the sprags, between the outer sprag and frame, and\nbetween the inner sprag and the drive.\nThese surfaces would be such that (1) in\npreparation for applying torque, the operator could bring the ends of the sprags\ninto contact with each other and with\nthe frame and drive, by twisting the\nouter sprag slightly clockwise and (2) in\npreparation for free rotation for ratcheting to the starting position for the next\ntorque-application stroke, the operator\ncould relieve the contact forces on the\nsprags by twisting the outer sprag slightly\ncounterclockwise.\nIn clockwise torquing, depicted\nschematically in the lower part of the figure, the operator would push or pull on\nthe outer-sprag portion of the handle in\na clockwise direction; this action would\njam the inner and outer sprags together\n\n5\n\nbetween the frame at the outer end and\nthe drive at the inner end. The jamming\nof the inner sprag against the drive\nwould prevent rotation of the drive relative to the drive housing, so that clockwise torque would be exerted on the\ndrive. At the end of the clockwise\ntorque-application stroke, the operator\nwould twist the outer sprag to relieve the\n\ncontact forces as described above. Then\nby exerting a small counterclockwise\nforce on the outer-sprag portion of the\nhandle, the operator could further\nunjam the sprags to complete the disengagement with the drive, and turn the\nhandle counterclockwise to the starting\nposition for the next clockwise torqueapplication stroke. Except for reversal of\n\nthe directions of all forces, torques, and\nrotations, counterclockwise ttorquing\nand ratcheting would be the same as in\nthe clockwise case described above.\nThis work was done by John M. Vranish of\nGoddard Space Flight Center. For further information, contact the Goddard Innovative\nTechnology Partnership (ITTP) Office at\n(301) 286-5810. GSC-14682-1\n\nMiniature Low-Mass Drill Actuated by Flextensional Piezo Stack\nThis extremely small impact drill can be used for testing soil for toxic chemicals, and other\nanalytical tests.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nRecent experiments with a flextensional piezoelectric actuator have led to\nthe development of a sampler with a bit\nthat is designed to produce and capture\na full set of sample forms including\n\nvolatiles, powdered cuttings, and core\nfragments.\nThe flextensional piezoelectric actuator is a part of a series of devices used to\namplify the generated strain from piezo-\n\nThe Miniature Drill, the bit, and the covering of both the actuator and bit using bellows are shown.\nThe tube with bellows also is shown.\n\n6\n\nelectric actuators. Other examples include stacks, bimorphs, benders, and\ncantilevers. These devices combine geometric and resonance amplifications to\nproduce large stroke at high power density. The operation of this sampler/drill\nwas demonstrated using a 3\xc3\x972\xc3\x971-cm actuator weighing 12 g using power of\nabout 10-W and a preload of about 10 N.\nA limestone block was drilled to a depth\nof about 1 cm in five minutes to produce\npowdered cuttings.\nIt is generally hard to collect volatiles\nfrom random surface profiles found in\nrocks and sediment, powdered cuttings,\nand core fragments. Toward the end of\ncollecting volatiles, the actuator and the\nbit are covered with bellows-shaped\nshrouds to prevent fines and other debris from reaching the analyzer. A tube\nwith a miniature bellows (to provide\nflexibility) is connected to the bit and directs the flow of the volatiles to the analyzer. Another modality was conceived\nwhere the hose is connected to the bellows wall directly to allow the capture of\nvolatiles generated both inside and outside the bit. A wide variety of commercial bellows used in the vacuum and microwave industries can be used to design\nthe volatiles\xe2\x80\x99 capture mechanism.\nThe piezoelectric drilling mechanism\ncan potentially be operated in a broad\ntemperature range from about \xe2\x80\x93200 to\n<450 \xc2\xbaC. The actuators used here are\nsimilar to the actuators that are currently baselined to fly as part of the inlet\nfunnel shaking mechanism design of\nMSL (Mars Science Laboratory). The\nspace qualification of these parts gives\nthis drill a higher potential for inclusion\nin a future mission, especially when considering its characteristics of low mass,\nsmall size, low power, and low axial loads\nfor sampling.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nSuch a tiny penetrator can be integrated with instruments for life and\nwater detection as well as materials characterization for planetary applications. It\nis also a useful tool for gaining subsurface access, an exploration goal that is\nan essential element of future missions.\nTerrestrially speaking, this tool has applications with regard to testing soil for\ntoxic chemicals, the presence of mois-\n\nture, and various other analytical tests.\nThis work was done by Stewart Sherrit,\nMircea Badescu, and Yoseph Bar-Cohen of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nMilitary and aerospace industries use\nMil-Spec type electrical connections on\nbulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations.\nThese connectors are usually in tight\nproximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described here have been designed to\nwork in such tight spaces, and consist of\na mirrored set of parallel handles, two\ncross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates\nmetal-to-metal contact and provides a\nhigh-friction surface between the jaw\nand the connector.\nOperationally, the user would slide\nthe pliers over the connector shell\nuntil the molded polyurethane lip\nmakes contact with the connector\nshell edge. Then, by squeezing the\nhandles, the end effector jaws grip the\nconnector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector\noccurs by reversing the prescribed\nprocedure, except the connector shell\nis placed into the jaws by hand. The\nmolded lip within the jaw allows the\nuser to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors.\nHandle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit\nweight, incorporate tether locations,\nand improve ergonomics. They have\nbeen designed with an off-axis offset for\nwiring harness clearance, while placing\nthe connector axis of rotation close to\nthe user\xe2\x80\x99s axis of wrist rotation. This was\ndone to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit\nhandle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism.\nA cross-link mechanism was used to com-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nThe Mate/Demate Pliers, shown in their open and closed configurations, feature cross-link springs to\nensure they remain in the open position until adequate force is applied to close them.\n\nplete this task, while ensuring smooth\noperation.\nForward slides allow the links to\nchange position during opening and\nclosing. Springs were added to the cross\nlinks to ensure that the pliers remain in\nthe open position until adequate force\nis applied to close them. The jaw end effectors can be easily removed and replaced to accommodate a range of connector sizes. Because the pliers were\ndesigned with the intent of reducing the\n\nrisk of foreign object debris (FOD), the\nend effectors contain two capturing features. They are held in place by means\nof two captive screw retainers while a\nsecondary detent feature holds the jaws\nin case the screw retainers fail or become loose.\nThis work was done by Brian Yutko,\nMichael Dininny, Gerard Moscoso, and\nAdam Dokos of Kennedy Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nReusable holders have been devised\nfor\nevaluating\nhigh-temperature,\nplasma-resistant re-entry materials, especially fabrics. Typical material samples\ntested support thermal-protection-system damage repair requiring evaluation\nprior to re-entry into terrestrial atmosphere. These tests allow evaluation of\neach material to withstand the most severe predicted re-entry conditions.\nIn pursuit of this purpose, the holders\nare capable of supporting the material\n\nsamples in a stagnation orientation\n(normal to the flow) with respect to the\nimpinging plasma flow. The holder design allows rapid installation and\nchange-out of 2.8 in. (\xe2\x89\x88 71 mm) diameter samples and can accommodate sample thicknesses from fabrics to more\nthan 0.5 in. (\xe2\x89\x88 13 mm). Each holder\nconsists of an interlocking set of rings,\nconstructed of silicon carbide coated\ngraphite, that clamp together concentrically in such a manner as to restrain the\n\nsample during a test. The sample is\nmounted in front of a washerlike backing plate to simulate the repair of a\ndamaged section of reinforced carboncarbon (RCC), such as that used on the\nSpace Shuttle Orbiter.\nThis work was done by Joe Riccio of Johnson Space Center and Jim D. Milhoan of\nLockheed Martin Corp.

The seal system includes a shroud covering that\nboth protects the sealing surface from its\nenvironment when not in use and retracts to expose the sealing surface when\nengaged. The seal system is constructed\nand arranged to mate with a replicate\nseal system or with a flat surface. When\n\nmated with a replicate seal system, the\nseal system functions when the two sealing surfaces are aligned or misaligned.\nThe seal system can operate over a wide\nrange of temperatures, limited only by\nthe glass transition and melt temperatures of the material from which the\nsealing surface is manufactured.\nThis work was done by Christopher C.\nDaniels of The University of Akron for Glenn\nResearch Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1).\n\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title\nto this invention.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn improved locking nut comprises\n(1) an internally threaded shell, partly\nresembling a conventional nut, that can\nbe engaged by a wrench or other tool,\nand (2) an internally and externally\nthreaded insert that engages the threads\n\n8\n\nof the shell and a bolt. Whereas some\nprior locking nuts are plated over their\nentire surfaces for lubrication and prevention of galling caused by engagement of threaded surfaces, this nut includes plating (silver or other soft\n\nmaterial) only on the threaded surfaces\nof the insert, which, during engagement, are enclosed. The elimination of\nexternal plating reduces the likelihood\nof contaminating adjacent equipment.\nThe insert makes an interference fit\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nwith the bolt thread, helping to lock the\nshell against loosening during vibration. In response to bolt tension upon\ntightening, the insert undergoes slight\nelongation that helps distribute the tension along the full length of thread engagement. The locking nut helps to dissipate vibrational energy through\nmicroscopic frictional rubbing between\nthe threads of the insert and the\nthreads of the shell. The soft plating\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nmay contribute to damping of vibrations. Rounding of the outer end of the\nshell reduces the potential for damage\nto nearby equipment or injury to\nnearby persons.\nThis work was done by Rahmatollah F.\nToosky and Scott Forest of McDonnell Douglas Corp. for Johnson Space Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA four-element array conformed to a\nsingly curved conducting surface has\nbeen demonstrated to provide 2 dB axial\nratio of 14 percent, while maintaining\nVSWR (voltage standing wave ratio) of 2:1\nand gain of 13 dBiC. The array is digitally\ncontrolled and can be scanned with the\nLMS Adaptive Algorithm using the power\nspectrum as the objective, as well as the\nDirection of Arrival (DoA) of the beam to\nset the amplitude of the power spectrum.\nThe total height of the array above the\nconducting surface is 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).\nA uniquely configured microstrip-coupled aperture over a conducting surface\nproduced supergain characteristics,\nachieving 12.5 dBiC across the 2-to-2.13-\n\nGHz and 2.2-to-2.3-GHz frequency\nbands. This design is optimized to retain\nVSWR and axial ratio across the band as\nwell. The four elements are uniquely\nconfigured with respect to one another\nfor performance enhancement, and the\nappropriate phase excitation to each element for scan can be found either by\nanalytical beam synthesis using the genetic algorithm with the measured or\nsimulated far field radiation pattern, or\nan adaptive algorithm implemented\nwith the digitized signal.\nThe commercially available tuners and\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA)\nboards utilized required precise phase coherent configuration control, and with\n\ncustom code developed by Nokomis, Inc.,\nwere shown to be fully functional in a\ntwo-channel configuration controlled by\nFPGA boards. A four-channel tuner configuration and oscilloscope configuration\nwere also demonstrated although algorithm post-processing was required.\nThis work was done by Thomas D\xe2\x80\x99Arista\nand Jerry Pauly of Nokomis, Inc. for Glenn Research Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Reconfigurable Robust Routing\nfor\nMobile\nOutreach\nNetwork\n(R3MOON) provides advanced communications networking technologies suitable for the lunar surface environment\nand applications. The R3MOON technology is based on a detailed concept of\noperations tailored for lunar surface\nnetworks, and includes intelligent routing algorithms and wireless mesh network implementation on AGNC\xe2\x80\x99s\nCoremicro Robots.\nThe product\xe2\x80\x99s features include an integrated communication solution incorporating energy efficiency and disruption-tolerance in a mobile ad hoc\nnetwork, and a real-time control module\nto provide researchers and engineers a\nconvenient tool for reconfiguration, investigation, and management.\nA new routing protocol extends existing routing methods such that more alternate routes can be found between\nthe source and the destination. This\nleads to better packet delivery rate as\nwell as larger extent of delivery. Alternate routes can also be used for route\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\noptimization wherein the most energy\nefficient route is chosen. The criterion\nof energy efficiency can be readily reconfigured to accommodate different\ndesign objectives and network requirements.\nWhen disruption occurs, a data buffering mechanism is established so that the\nundeliverable packet is stored at a dynamically selected storage node while awaiting redelivery. Since the undeliverable\npacket is not discarded but buffered, robustness is achieved. A proper storage\nnode is chosen by considering its buffer\nspace, battery power, and location.\nA hardware prototype network is developed based on AGNC\xe2\x80\x99s product solutions such as Coremicro Robot and\nCoremicro 40 GIS. The multi-robot\ndemonstration scheme incorporates\nmesh and relay networking. With three\nnetwork nodes, routing capability is\ntested, verified, and monitored on this\nplatform with a real-time Coremicro\n40 GIS based robot Operator Control\nUnit (OCU). Multimedia data is exchanged in the network through effec-\n\ntive communication and routing, even\nupon disruption. When one of the direct links is disrupted, an alternative\ntwo-hop path can be used to accomplish the communication.\nR3MOON offers the following novel\nfeatures in a complete and comprehensive communication solution:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Energy-efficient routing achieved\nthrough path selection. This approach\nis highly feasible and implementable.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Disruption-tolerant routing achieved\nthrough data buffering and retransmission mechanism. This approach\nis also based on AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) routing protocol. Retransmission from the storage\nnode achieves more graceful packet\ndiscarding rate, faster restoration,\nand higher redelivery rate than retransmission from the source node.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Implementation and performance\ndemonstration through software and\nhardware realization. The simulation\nshows animation for the route discovery process, and validates the performance of the proposed method in vari-\n\n11\n\nous simulated network settings.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An actual implementation of a mesh\nnetwork architecture that integrates\nnetwork control and optimization\nfunctionalities. The integral ap proach combines communication,\nnavigation, control, and other functions needed to perform the mission. Each network node (e.g.,\nrobot) houses modules such as robot\ncontrol processor, sensor fusion\nprocessor, and image processor,\nwhich are all interconnected\nthrough a communication module.\nThe communication module con-\n\nnects all the nodes in the network.\nThe configuration can be customized for designer\xe2\x80\x99s needs such as\nreduction of power consumption or\nsimplification of wiring. In the\nhigher level of the R3MOON architecture, a human/machine interface\nis embedded for executing AGNC\xe2\x80\x99s\n4D-GIS and for monitoring and\nmanagement of the network.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A communication module that can be\nconfigured with different routing algorithms to run the mesh network.\nBoth proactive [e.g., OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing)] and re-\n\nactive (e.g., AODV) based routing\nprotocols can be used in the module.\nA mesh wireless network with optimized routing algorithms enhances\nsystem reliability and performance.\nThis work was done by Ching-Fang Lin\nof American GNC Corp. for Glenn Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nHelmet- and head-mounted display\nsystems, denoted fiber-scanned microdisplays, have been proposed to provide information in an \xe2\x80\x9caugmented reality\xe2\x80\x9d format (meaning that the\ninformation would be optically overlaid on the user\xe2\x80\x99s field of view). A system of this type would include laser\ndiodes feeding light into the input\nends of optical fibers. The output ends\nof the fibers would be vibrated in prescribed patterns (scanned), in synchronism with excitation of the laser\n\ndiodes, to trace out the patterns to be\ndisplayed. Lenses would form virtual\nimages of the patterns and project the\nimages directly (or by reflection) into\nthe viewer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\nThe effective object distance of the\nimages could be set to approximate the\ndistances of other objects in the field of\nview, so that the viewer need not refocus\nto view the display. The display units\ncould be positioned to present the displays at the margin of the field of view,\nthereby minimizing distraction when\n\nthe user needs to concentrate attention\nelsewhere. Alternatively, the display\nunits could be mounted so that a turn of\nthe eye or a slight turn of the head from\na nominal straight-ahead orientation\nwould be necessary for viewing the displays.\nThis work was done by Janet CrossmanBosworth and Eric Seibel of the University of\nWashington for Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe invention allows a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or similar device to be efficiently reconfigured\nin whole or in part to provide higher\ncapacity, non-redundant operation.\nThe redundant device consists of functional units such as adders or multipliers, configuration memory for the\nfunctional units, a programmable routing method, configuration memory for\nthe routing method, and various other\nfeatures such as block RAM, I/O (random access memory, input/output) capability, dedicated carry logic, etc. The\nredundant device has three identical\nsets of functional units and routing resources and majority voters that correct\nerrors. The configuration memory may\nor may not be redundant, depending\non need. For example, SRAM-based\n\n12\n\nFPGAs will need some type of radiation-tolerant configuration memory, or\nthey will need triple-redundant configuration memory. Flash or anti-fuse devices will generally not need redundant\nconfiguration memory. Some means of\nloading and verifying the configuration\nmemory is also required. These are all\ncomponents of the pre-existing redundant FPGA.\nThis innovation modifies the voter to\naccept a MODE input, which specifies\nwhether ordinary voting is to occur, or\nif redundancy is to be split. Generally,\nadditional routing resources will also be\nrequired to pass data between sections\nof the device created by splitting the redundancy. In redundancy mode, the\nvoters produce an output corresponding to the two inputs that agree, in the\n\nusual fashion. In the split mode, the\nvoters select just one input and convey\nthis to the output, ignoring the other\ninputs. In a dual-redundant system (as\nopposed to triple-redundant), instead\nof a voter, there is some means to latch\nor gate a state update only when both\ninputs agree. In this case, the invention\nwould require modification of the latch\nor gate so that it would operate normally in redundant mode, and would\nseparately latch or gate the inputs in\nnon-redundant mode.\nFor fault tolerance, it is assumed that\nonly one fault will occur within a voting\ngroup within one voting cycle, and\nthus, the fault can be eliminated by majority voting. Three voters are often\nused, providing three values to the\nnext voting group, and so on, with the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nentire device triplicated. The only connection between the three sections of\nthe device is the voters. By changing\nthe operation of the voters, the sections can operate independently. A system of triple-redundant voted configuration data (if needed, according to\nthe configuration memory type) can be\nused to provide routing connections to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nallow communication between the sections. The ability to use hardwarebased redundancy where needed in\nhigh-capacity applications may help\navoid high development costs, difficult\nmaintenance, and complex failure of\nfirmware redundancy schemes.\nThis work was done by Robert Shuler,\nJr. of Johnson Space Center.

The foundation\nplatform for GRAPE provides a number\nof communication and data-management mechanisms, which help planners\ncommunicate scheduling issues, including document management, security\nschemes, calendars, wikis, blogs, lists,\nissue tracking, discussion forums, workflow management, alerts/notifications,\nand configuration management.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nAdditionally, a set of \xe2\x80\x9cweb parts\xe2\x80\x9d has\nbeen developed for DSN resource-allocation-specific analysis, including tools\nfor managing ground asset and mission\ninformation; finding configuration\ncodes; displaying, querying, and comparing schedules; analyzing mission coverage; checking for schedule conflicts;\ncreating and submitting schedule\nchange requests; and viewing and validating mission view periods. The\nmethodology of web parts allows individual users to compose their own Web\npages by picking the web parts they want\nto use on a Web page, rather than developers designing Web pages for users.\nThis allows developers to focus more on\nfunctionality and less on appearance\nand integration, while users are empowered to compose Web pages for their immediate analysis and collaboration\nneeds rather than waiting for another\nlong development cycle for some new\ncapability.

MIRO will study\nthe evolution of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\xe2\x80\x99s coma system. The\ninstrument will measure surface temperature, gas-production rates and relative abundances, and velocity and excitation temperatures of each species\nalong with their spatial temporal variability. This software will use these measurements to improve the understanding\nof coma dynamics.\nThe modeling tool solves the equation of motion of a dust particle, the en-\n\nergy balance equation of the dust particle, the continuity equation for the dust\nand gas flow, and the dust and gas mixture energy equation. By solving these\nequations numerically, the software calculates the temperature and velocity of\ngas and dust as a function of time for a\ngiven initial gas and dust production\nrate, and a dust characteristic parameter that measures the ability of a dust\nparticle to adjust its velocity to the local\ngas velocity.\nThe software is written in a modular\nmanner, thereby allowing the addition\nof more dynamics equations as needed.\nAll of the numerical algorithms are\nadded in-house and no third-party libraries are used.\nThis work was done by Paul A.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cgoal\xe2\x80\x9d\nrefers to a science or engineering request to execute a possibly complex\ncommand sequence, such as image targets or ground-station downlinks.\nDeveloped as an extension to the Virtual Machine Language (VML) execution system, the software enables onboard and remote goal triggering\nthrough the use of an embedded, dynamic goal set that can oversubscribe\nresources. From the set of conflicting\ngoals, a subset must be chosen that maximizes a given quality metric, which in\nthis case is strict priority selection. A\ngoal can never be preempted by a lower\npriority goal, and high-level goals can be\nadded, removed, or updated at any\ntime, and the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d goals will be selected for execution.\nThe software addresses the issue of\nre-planning that must be performed in\na short time frame by the embedded\nsystem where computational resources\nare constrained. In particular, the algorithm addresses problems with welldefined goal requests without temporal flexibility that oversubscribes\n\n15\n\navailable resources. By using a fast, incremental algorithm, goal selection\ncan be postponed in a \xe2\x80\x9cjust-in-time\xe2\x80\x9d\nfashion allowing requests to be\nchanged or added at the last minute.\nThereby enabling shorter response\ntimes and greater autonomy for the\nsystem under control.\nThis work was done by Gregg R.

It\nintegrates existing routines into coherent processes, and provides a structure\nwith reusable capabilities that allow additional processes to be quickly developed and integrated. It has an extensive\ngraphical user interface, which makes\nthe tool more intuitive and friendly.\nOPTOOL is implemented using\nMATLAB with a Fourier optics-based\napproach for point spread function\n(PSF) calculations. It features parametric and Monte Carlo simulation ca-\n\npabilities, and uses a direct integration calculation to permit high spatial\nsampling of the PSF. Exit pupil optical\npath difference (OPD) maps can be\ngenerated using combinations of\nZernike polynomials or shaped power\nspectral densities. The graphical user\ninterface allows rapid creation of arbitrary pupil geometries, and entry of all\nother modeling parameters to support\nbasic imaging and radiometric analyses.\nOPTOOL provides the capability to\ngenerate wavefront-error (WFE) maps\nfor arbitrary grid sizes. These maps are\n2D arrays containing digital sampled versions of functions ranging from Zernike\npolynomials to combination of sinusoidal wave functions in 2D, to functions\ngenerated from a spatial frequency\npower spectral distribution (PSD). It\nalso can generate optical transfer functions (OTFs), which are incorporated\ninto the PSF calculation.\nThe user can specify radiometrics for\nthe target and sky background, and key\nperformance parameters for the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s focal plane array (FPA). This radiometric and detector model setup is\nfairly extensive, and includes parameters\nsuch as zodiacal background, thermal\nemission noise, read noise, and dark current.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA design concept, and a fabrication\nprocess that would implement the design concept, have been proposed for\nnearly seamless vacuum-insulated boxes\nthat could be the main structural components of a variety of controlled-temperature containers, including common\nhousehold refrigerators and insulating\ncontainers for shipping foods. In a typical case, a vacuum-insulated box would\nbe shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped conventional refrigerator box\nhaving five fully closed sides and a\nhinged door on the sixth side. Although\nit is possible to construct the five-closedside portion of the box as an assembly of\nfive unitary vacuum-insulated panels, it\nis not desirable to do so because the relatively high thermal conductances of the\nseams between the panels would contribute significant amounts of heat leakage, relative to the leakage through the\npanels themselves. In contrast, the proposal would make it possible to reduce\nheat leakage by constructing the fiveclosed-side portion of the box plus the\nstationary portion (if any) of the sixth\nside as a single, seamless unit; the only\nremaining seam would be the edge seal\naround the door.\nThe basic cross-sectional configuration of each side of a vacuum-insulated\nbox according to the proposal would be\nthat of a conventional vacuum-insulated\npanel: a low-density, porous core mate-\n\nrial filling a partially evacuated space between face sheets. However, neither the\nface sheets nor the core would be conventional. The face sheets would be opposite sides of a vacuum bag. The core\nmaterial would be a flexible polymermodified silica aerogel of the type described\nin\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilica/Polymer\nand\nSilica/Polymer/Fiber Composite Aerogels\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC-23736) in this issue of NASA\nTech Briefs. As noted in that article, the\nstiffness of this core material against\ncompression is greater than that of prior\naerogels. This is an important advantage\nbecause it translates to greater retention\nof thickness and, hence, of insulation\nperformance when pressure is applied\nacross the thickness, in particular, when\nthe space between the face sheets is evacuated, causing the core material to be\nsqueezed between the face sheets by atmospheric pressure.\nFabrication of a typical vacuum-insulated box according to the proposal\nwould begin with fabrication of a crossshaped polymer-modified aerogel blanket. The dimensions of the cross would\nbe chosen so that (1) the central rectangular portion of the cross would form\nthe core for the back of the box and (2)\nthe arms of the cross could be folded 90\xc2\xb0\nfrom the back plane to form the cores of\nthe adjacent four sides of the box. Optionally, the blanket could include tabs\nfor joining the folded sides of the blan-\n\nket along mating edges and tabs that\ncould serve as hinges for the door.\nVacuum bags in the form of similar\nfive-sided boxes would be made of a suitable polymeric film, one bag to fit the\nouter core surface, the other to fit the\ninner core surface. By use of commercially available film-sealing equipment,\nthese box-shaped bags would be seamed\ntogether to form a single vacuum bag\nencasing the box-shaped core. Also, a\none-way valve would be sealed to the\nbag. Through this valve, the interior of\nthe bag would be evacuated to a pressure between 1 and 10 torr (approximately between 0.13 and 1.3 kPa). The\npolymer-modified aerogel core material\nis known to perform well as a thermal insulator in such a partial vacuum.\nThis work was done by Christopher J.\nStepanian, Danny Ou, and Xiangjun Hu of\nAspen Aerogels, Inc., for Johnson Space Center.

The combination of high strength and high temperature\ncapability, as well as a twist-lock mounting\nmethod to the steel burner, sets this flame\nholder apart from existing technology.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nThis design features the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Enables about double the torch output\nwithout damaging the torch.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can operate at a higher temperature\n[4,000 \xc2\xb0F (2,204 \xc2\xb0C)] than stainless\nsteel [1,600 \xc2\xb0F (870 \xc2\xb0C)].\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Allows the torch to be optimized for\ndifferent applications (e.g., may use a\n\nmixing nozzle or a supersonic nozzle).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can be used with either venturi or\nforced draft burners.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Is easily replaceable without tools.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operates without torch/holder rusting\ntogether after use.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Permits a modified torch to still use a\nconventional flame holder.\n\n17\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Uses a twist-lock attachment (an improvement over setscrews).\nThe high-output flame holder was developed in support of the U.S. Navy\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to design a jet engine simulator for\ninfrared plume studies. Previous tests\nhad shown that off-the-shelf components would melt or burn up in a short\ntime. Given these design and performance criteria, NASA developed a ceramic\n\nflame holder that has a much longer life\ncycle and can be used with a variety of\ntorches or burners. Where the stainless\nflame holders showed signs of oxidation,\nflaking after only three hours of testing,\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ceramic flame holder has over\n150 hours and 200 cycles of use in a casting furnace, and soot marks are the only\nsigns of use; there are no signs of deterioration. NASA expects the new technol-\n\nogy to help enhance safety through increased reliability and flame control.\nThe total cost of ownership is less due to\ndecreased maintenance and improved\nefficiency.\nThis work was done by Henry Haskin of\nLangley Research Center.

Unlike pyrovalves,\nNitinol is actuated by simply heating the\nmaterial to a certain temperature, called\nthe transition temperature. Like a pyrovalve, before actuation, the upstream\nand downstream sections are separated\nfrom one another and from the external\nenvironment by closed welded seals. Also\nlike pyrovalves, after actuation, the propellant or pressurant gas can flow without\na significant pressure drop but are still\nseparated from the external environment\nby a closed welded seal.\nDuring manufacture, a Nitinol bar is\ncompressed to 93 percent of its origi-\n\nnal length and fitted tightly into the\nvalve. During operation, the valve is\nheated until the Nitinol reaches the\ntransition temperature of 95 \xc2\xb0C; the\nNitinol \xe2\x80\x9cremembers\xe2\x80\x9d its previous\nlonger shape with a very large recovery\nforce causing it to expand and break\nthe titanium parent metal seal to allow\nflow. Once open, the valve forever remains open.\nThe first prototype valve was designed\nfor high pressure [5,000 psi (\xe2\x89\x8834.5\nMPa)] and low flow, typical requirements for pressurant gas valves in liquid\npropulsion systems. It is possible to modify the dimensions to make low-pressure\nmodels or high-flow models, for use\ndownstream of the propellant tanks.\n\nThis design is simpler, lower risk, and\nless expensive than the pyrovalve. Although the valve must be in a thermally\ncontrolled state (kept below 80 \xc2\xb0C) to\nprevent premature actuation, the pyrovalves and electrically actuated initiators have far more taxing handling requirements.\nThis work was done by Rebecca Gillespie of\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1).\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nBulk shape memory alloys, such as\nNitinol or CuAlZn, display strong recovery forces undergoing a phase transformation after being strained in their\nmartensitic state. These recovery forces\nare used for actuation. As the phase\ntransformation is thermally driven, the\nresponse time of the actuation can be\nslow, as the heat must be passively inserted or removed from the alloy.\nShape memory alloy TiNi torque\ntubes have been investigated for at least\n20 years and have demonstrated high actuation forces [3,000 in.-lb (\xe2\x89\x88340 N-m)\ntorques] and are very lightweight. However, they are not easy to attach to existing structures. Adhesives will fail in\nshear at low-torque loads and the TiNi is\nnot weldable, so that mechanical crimp\n\n18\n\nfits have been generally used. These\nare not reliable, especially in vibratory environments. The TiNi is also\nslow to heat up, as it can only be\nheated indirectly using heater and\ncooling must be done passively. This\nhas restricted their use to on-off actuators where cycle times of approximately one minute is acceptable.\nSelf-propagating high-temperature\nsynthesis (SHS) has been used in the\npast to make porous TiNi metal\nfoams. Shape Change Technologies\nhas been able to train SHS derived\nTiNi to exhibit the shape memory effect. As it is an open-celled material,\nfast response times were observed\nwhen the material was heated using\nhot and cold fluids.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure: (a) Schematic Representation of the TiNi\nTorque Tube. The ends are integrated as hexagonal\ncaps as shown in (b) and (c) shows a processed\ntorque tube with a coupling at a representative\nlength scale.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nA methodology was developed to\nmake the open-celled porous TiNi\nfoams as a tube with integrated hexagonal ends, which then becomes a torsional actuator with fast response\ntimes. Under processing developed\nindependently, researchers were able\nto verify torques of 84 in.-lb (\xe2\x89\x889.5 Nm) using an actuator weighing 1.3 oz\n(\xe2\x89\x8837 g) with very fast (<1/16th of a\nsecond) initial response times when\nhot and cold fluids were used to facilitate heat transfer.\nIntegrated structural connections\nwere added as part of the net shape\nprocess, eliminating the need for weld-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\ning, adhesives, or mechanical crimping.\nInexpensive net-shape processing was\nused, which reduces the cost of the actuator by over a factor of 10 over nonporous TiNi made by hot drawing of\ntube or electrical discharge machining.\nBy forming the alloy as an opencelled foam, the surface area for heat\ntransfer is dramatically increased, allowing for much faster response times.\nThe technology also allows for netshape fabrication of the actuator,\nwhich allows for structural connections to be integrated into the actuator\nmaterial, making these actuators significantly less expensive.\n\nCommercial applications include actuators for concepts such as the variablearea chevron and nozzle in jet aircraft.\nLightweight tube or rod components\ncan be supplied to interested parties.\nThis work was done by A.

Discovered to be superconducting in 2001, MgB2 has the advantage of remaining superconducting at\nhigher temperatures than the previously\nused material, NbTi. The purpose of\nthese leads is to provide 2 A of electricity\nto motors located in a 1.3 K environment.\nThe providing environment is a relatively\nwarm 17 K. Requirements for these leads\nare to survive temperature fluctuations in\nthe 5 K and 11 K heat sinks, and not conduct excessive heat into the 1.3 K environment. Test data showed that each lead in\nthe assembly could conduct 5 A at 4 K,\nwhich, when scaled to 17 K, still provided\nmore than the required 2 A.\n\nThe lead assembly consists of 12 steelclad MgB2 wires, a tensioned Kevlar support, a thermal heat sink interface at 4\nK, and base plates. The wires are soldered to heavy copper leads at the 17 K\nend, and to thin copper-clad NbTi leads\nat the 1.3 K end. The leads were designed, fabricated, and tested at the\nForschungszentrum Karlsruhe - Institut\nf\xc3\xbcr Technische Physik before inclusion\nin Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s XRS (X-Ray Spectrometer) instrument onboard the Astro-E2\nspacecraft.\nA key factor is that MgB2 remains superconducting up to 30 K, which means\nthat it does not introduce joule heating\nas a resistive wire would. Because the required temperature ranges are 1.3\xe2\x80\x9317 K,\nthis provides a large margin of safety.\n\nPrevious designs lost superconductivity\nat around 8 K. The disadvantage to\nMgB2 is that it is a brittle ceramic, and\nmaking thin wires from it is challenging.\nThe solution was to encase the leads in\nthin steel tubes for strength. Previous\ndesigns were so brittle as to risk instrument survival.\nMgB2 leads can be used in any cryogenic application where small currents\nneed to be conducted at below 30 K. Because previous designs would superconduct only at up to 8 K, this new design\nwould be ideal for the 8\xe2\x80\x9330 K range.\nThis work was done by John Panek of Goddard Space Flight Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nPolyimide aerogels with three-dimensional cross-linked structure are made\nusing linear oligomeric segments of polyimide, and linked with one of the following into a 3D structure: trifunctional\naliphatic or aromatic amines, latent reactive end caps such as nadic anhydride or\nphenylethynylphenyl amine, and silica or\nsilsesquioxane cage structures decorated\nwith amine. Drying the gels supercritically maintains the solid structure of the\ngel, creating a polyimide aerogel with improved mechanical properties over linear polyimide aerogels.\nLightweight, low-density structures\nare desired for acoustic and thermal insulation for aerospace structures, habitats, astronaut equipment, and aeronautic applications. Aerogels are a\nunique material for providing such\nproperties because of their extremely\nlow density and small pore sizes. How-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\never, plain silica aerogels are brittle. Reinforcing the aerogel structure with a\npolymer (X-Aerogel) provides vast improvements in strength while maintaining low density and pore structure.\nHowever, degradation of polymers used\nin cross-linking tends to limit use temperatures to below 150 \xc2\xbaC. Organic\naerogels made from linear polyimide\nhave been demonstrated, but gels\nshrink substantially during supercritical\nfluid extraction and may have lower use\ntemperature due to lower glass transition temperatures.\nThe purpose of this innovation is to\nraise the glass transition temperature\nof all organic polyimide aerogel by use\nof tri-, tetra-, or poly-functional units in\nthe structure to create a 3D covalently\nbonded network. Such cross-linked\npolyimides typically have higher glass\ntransition temperatures in excess of\n\n300\xe2\x80\x93400 \xc2\xbaC. In addition, the reinforcement provided by a 3D network should\nimprove mechanical stability, and prevent shrinkage on supercritical fluid\nextraction. The use of tri-functional\naromatic or aliphatic amine groups in\nthe polyimide backbone will provide\nsuch a 3D structure.\nAlternatively, cross-linking of the\npolyimide can be carried out by capping long-chain oligomers with latent\nreactive end caps (nadic anhydride or\nphenylethynylphenylamine, for example). After supercritical fluid extraction, the cross-linking is carried out on\na post- cure of the dried gels. In another embodiment, polyimide or\npolyamic acid can be capped with trialkoxy silanes, which can be co-reacted\nwith small amounts of tetraalkoxy\nsilanes to form regions of covalently\nbonded silica crosslinks. Alternately,\n\n21\n\npolysilsesquioxane cages decorated\nwith surface amines can be co-reacted\nwith anhydride capped polyimide/\npolyamic acid.\nCross-linked polyimide aerogels with\ntheir high porosity, combined with\nhigher strength, have excellent thermal\nas well as sound-insulating qualities. In\n\naddition, their high specific surface area\n(e.g. on the order of 200\xe2\x80\x931,000 m2/g)\nshould make them well suited for numerous applications, including as adsorbent beds for chemical separations, and\nas platforms for solid-state sensors.\nThis work was done by Mary Ann B.\nMeador of Glenn Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAerogels that consist, variously, of neat\nsilica/polymer alloys and silica/polymer\nalloy matrices reinforced with fibers have\nbeen developed as materials for flexible\nthermal-insulation blankets. In comparison with prior aerogel blankets, these\naerogel blankets are more durable and\nless dusty. These blankets are also better\nable to resist and recover from compression \xe2\x80\x94 an important advantage in that\nmaintenance of thickness is essential to\nmaintenance of high thermal-insulation\nperformance. These blankets are especially suitable as core materials for vacuum-insulated panels and vacuum-insulated boxes of advanced, nearly seamless\ndesign. (Inasmuch as heat leakage at\nseams is much greater than heat leakage\nelsewhere through such structures, advanced designs for high insulation performance should provide for minimization of the sizes and numbers of seams.)\nA silica/polymer aerogel of the present type could be characterized, somewhat more precisely, as consisting of\nmultiply bonded, linear polymer reinforcements within a silica aerogel matrix. Thus far, several different polymethacrylates (PMAs) have been\nincorporated into aerogel networks to\n\nincrease resistance to crushing and to\nimprove other mechanical properties\nwhile minimally affecting thermal conductivity and density.\nThe polymethacrylate phases are\nstrongly linked into the silica aerogel\nnetworks in these materials. Unlike in\nother organic/inorganic blended aerogels, the inorganic and organic phases\nare chemically bonded to each other, by\nboth covalent and hydrogen bonds. In\nthe process for making a silica/polymer\nalloy aerogel, the covalent bonds are introduced by prepolymerization of the\nmethacrylate\nmonomer\nwith\ntrimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate,\nwhich serves as a phase cross-linker in\nthat it contains both organic and inorganic monomer functional groups and\nhence acts as a connector between the\norganic and inorganic phases. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the\nsilanol groups of the inorganic phase\nand the carboxyl groups of the organic\nphase. The polymerization process has\nbeen adapted to create interpenetrating\nPMA and silica-gel networks from\nmonomers and prevent any phase separations that could otherwise be caused\nby an overgrowth of either phase.\n\nTypically, the resulting PMA/silica\naerogel, without or with fiber reinforcement, has a density and a thermal conductivity similar to those of pure silica\naerogels. However, the PMA enhances\nmechanical properties. Specifically, flexural strength at rupture is increased to\n102 psi (\xe2\x89\x88 0.7 MPa), about 50 times the\nflexural strength of typical pure silica\naerogels. Resistance to compression is\nalso increased: Applied pressure of 17.5\npsi (\xe2\x89\x88 0.12 MPa) was found to reduce the\nthicknesses of several composite PMA/silica aerogels by only about 10 percent.\nThis work was done by Danny Ou, Christopher J.

The required tool needs to be low\nmass and compact to operate from such\nplatforms as a lander or rover. This technology also would be applicable to sample handling when transporting samples\nto analyzers and sorting particles by size.\nA metal bar or plate with a linear array\nof asymmetric grooves has been designed\nto be shaken at low frequency by a voice\ncoil, or linear actuator, mechanism which\ninduces the particles to jump from one\ngroove to the next. Larger particles with\ndiameters greater than the groove depth\nwere shown to move quicker, while particles with a diameter that is less than the\ngroove depth were found to move slower,\nthus creating a sorting by size. Using this\nasymmetry in particle motion with particle size, it is shown that both the movement of unconsolidated particles along\nthe slide provided both transportation\nand sorting mechanisms.\nThe initial motion of the plate was created by a rotary motor linked to create\nsymmetric vibrations. The figure shows a\ngraphic illustration of this system. The rotary motion can be used to sample unconsolidated material from a platform. A ro-\n\nA Schematic View of the System using a rotary motor and a slide with asymmetric grooves.\n\ntary motor causes linear oscillatory motion in the rod through a linkage, and\ncauses particles in the grooves to move to\nhigher-level grooves by being thrown\nfrom a lower groove. The linear actuation\nalso could be developed with a voice coil\nactuator or any other linear motor. The\nuse of asymmetric teeth increases the likelihood of a forward transfer of particles,\nand in each jump, the particles climb the\ntoothlike steps. Introducing elliptical oscillations increases the efficiency of transfer by giving the sample movement vector\nnormal to the slide axis.\nAn option to this design includes\nsieves to allow gauging of particle di-\n\nmension. A distribution of particles is\ntransported to the end of the groove\nrod. When particles enter a sieve with\nsmaller holes, the excitation shakes\nthem through the sieve. The excitation\nfrequency is then increased, and the\ndifferentiated sample is then moved to\nthe next larger size sieve where the\nprocess is repeated until all particles\nare sieved.\nThis work was done by Stewart Sherrit,\nJames S. Scott, Yoseph Bar-Cohen, Mircea\nBadescu, and Xiaoqi Bao of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Further\ninformation is contained in a TSP (see page\n1).

(Molten alkali metals\nare used as heat-transfer fluids in hightemperature stages of some nuclear reactors.) The principle of operation of\nthis or any such pump involves exploita-\n\ntion of the electrical conductivity of the\nmolten metal: An electric current is\nmade to pass through the liquid metal\nalong an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flow channel, and a\n\n25\n\nHighly Magnetically\nPermeable Material\n\nPermanent\nMagnet\nElectrode\n\nMicroporous\nCeramic\n\nStainless-Steel Tube\nDiameter 1/2 in.,\nThickness 0.049 in.\n\nCopper Cooling\nBlock\n\nThis Direct-Current Electromagnetic Pump is designed to develop a pressure of 5 psi (34 kPa) and a\nmass flow rate of 56 g/s when driven by an input current between 50 and 100 ADC (corresponding to\nan input potential of about 1 VDC). The pumped fluid would be a sodium-potassium eutectic at a temperature of about 650 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nmagnetic field perpendicular to both\nthe longitudinal axis and the electric\ncurrent is superimposed on the flowchannel region containing the electric\ncurrent. The interaction between the\nelectric current and the magnetic field\nproduces the pumping force along the\nlongitudinal axis. The advantages of the\nproposed pump over other such pumps\nwould accrue from design features that\naddress overlapping thermal and magnetic issues.\nUnder the anticipated operating conditions, the molten alkali metal \xe2\x80\x94 a eutectic mixture of sodium and potassium\n\xe2\x80\x94 would be heated to a temperature of\nabout 650 \xc2\xb0C. To maximize the effectiveness of the pump while minimizing\nthe electric current (and thus the\npower) needed for pumping at a given\n\nrate, it is necessary to maximize the\nmagnetic field across the flow channel.\nIn order to do this, it would be desirable to use rare-earth (specifically,\nneodymium or samarium-cobalt) permanent magnets to apply the magnetic\nfield and to place the magnets as close\nas possible to the flow channel. Because\nsuch magnets become demagnetized at\ntemperatures around 130 or 350 \xc2\xb0C, respectively, it becomes necessary to protect them against conduction and radiation of heat from the flow channel. In\nsome other pumps of this type, the thermal-protection problem is solved by\nplacing the magnets farther from the\nchannel and then increasing the electric current needed to obtain the required pumping capacity. In still other\npumps of this type, massive amounts of\n\nconvection cooling are used to prevent\noverheating of the magnets.\nIn the proposed pump, the liquid\nmetal flow channel would be defined by\na round stainless-steel tube that would\nbe flattened to a nearly rectangular cross\nsection in the region where the magnets\nwere to be placed (see figure). Two permanent magnets would be placed on opposing sides of the channel, separated\nfrom the flat tube faces by thermal-insulation material consisting of a microporous ceramic having extremely low\nthermal conductivity. To remove the\nsmall amount of heat conducted\nthrough the ceramic, copper blocks\nhousing the magnets are connected to a\nwater-circulation cooling system. These\nblocks would be in direct thermal contact with each magnet, providing an\nisothermal heat sink to maintain the\ntemperature below a required level. To\nmaximize the magnetic flux density in\nthe channel, the part of the magnetic\ncircuit outside the channel would be\ncompleted with ferromagnetic material\nhaving a magnetic permeability and a\nmagnetic-saturation threshold greater\nthan those of simple iron.\nThick electrodes would conduct the\napplied electric current to the tube\nwalls, and the current would be conducted through the tube walls to the liquid metal in the channel. A portion of\nthe current would be conducted around\nthe channel through the tube walls; this\nportion would not be available for generating pumping force. Hence, unavoidably, some power would be lost in heating of the tube walls.\nThis work was done by Thomas Godfroy and\nKurt Polzin of Marshall Space Flight Center.\nFor further information, contact Sammy\nNabors, MSFC Commercialization Assistance\nLead, at sammy.a.nabors@nasa.gov.

Turning the\nlink into the ground in lieu of driving\n\nthe wheels causes the Axel housing\nand wheels to roll as a unit and\nthereby leads to a tumbling motion\nalong the ground. With a tether\nmounted around Axel\xe2\x80\x99s cylindrical\nbody, the link serves as a winch mechanism to reel and unreel the tether\nraising and lowering Axel over steep\nand vertical surfaces (Figure 1).\nSensors, computation, and communication modules are also housed inside\nAxel\xe2\x80\x99s body. A pair of stereo vision cameras provides three-dimensional view\nfor autonomous navigation and avoiding obstacles. Inertial sensors determine the tilt of the robot and are used\nfor estimating its motion.

By\nuse of only the two main wheel actuators and the caster link actuator, Axel\ncan be made to follow an arbitrary\npath, turn in place, and operate upside-down or right-side-up. If operated\nin a tethered configuration, as shown\nin Figure 1, it can be made to move\ndown and up a steep crater wall, descend from an overhang to a cave, and\nascend from the cave back to the overhang, all by use of the same three actuators. Such tethered operation could\nbe useful in searching for accident victims or missing persons in mines,\ncaves, and rubble piles. Running the\ntether through the caster link enhances the stability of Axel and provides a restoring force that keeps the\nlink off the ground for the most part\nduring operation on a steep slope.\nIn its extended configuration, two\nAxel modules can dock to either side of\na payload module to form the four\nwheeled Axel2 rover (Figure 2).

This development allows for automated sample\npreparation in the laboratory and\nanalysis of complex samples in the\nfield with multiple types of analytical\ninstruments.\nRather than using tedious, exacting protocols for desalting samples\nby hand, this innovation, called the\nAutomated Sample Processing System (ASPS), takes analytes that\nhave been extracted through hightemperature solvent extraction and\nintroduces them into the desalting\ncolumn.

Six different solvents are required to both process\nthe sample and condition the column before and after\nprocessing.\n\nThis system currently targets\namino acids. For these molecules, a\nslurry of 1 g cation exchange resin in\ndeionized water is packed into a column of the apparatus. Initial generation of the resin is done by flowing sequentially 2\xe2\x80\x933 bed volumes of 2N\nNaOH and 2N HCl (1 mL each) to\nrinse the resin, followed by \xe2\x89\x885 mL of\ndeionized water. This makes the pH\nof the resin near neutral, and eliminates cross sample contamination. Afterward, 2\xe2\x80\x933 mL of extracted sample\nis then loaded into the column onto\nthe top of the resin bed. Because the\ncolumn is packed tightly, the sample\ncan be applied without disturbing the\nresin bed.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA glove containing force sensors has\nbeen built as a prototype of tactile sensor\narrays to be worn on human hands and\nanthropomorphic robot hands. Whereas\nthe force sensors of a prior force-sensing\nglove are mounted on the outside, the\nforce sensors of this glove are mounted\ninside, in protective pockets; as a result\nof this and other design features, the\npresent glove is more durable. The sensors, which cost only $3 apiece (2002),\nproduce analog force readings in the\n\nrange of 0 to 5 lb (0 to 22 N) at numerous locations across the hand.\nTo minimize false readings due to internal glove motions and/or tight fit of\nthe glove on the hand, the pockets are\nconstructed as recesses within modular\nfoam inserts that are sewn into the\nglove. High-friction material provides\ngood gripping surfaces for finger and\npalm contact areas. Textile stiffeners on\nthe backsides of the sensors prevent deformation of the foam during motion.\n\nTo ensure that forces are directed into\nthe sensors and not channeled through\nthe relatively stiff gripping-surface material, stiff plastic beads are sewn in\nplace between the sensors and the\nouter glove fabric.\nThis work was done by Melissa Butzer of\nOceaneering Space Systems, Myron A.

It can\ncarry an end-effector to acquire and\ntransfer samples by using active control\nand comply with surface topology in a\npassive mode during a brief surface\ncontact. The three joints are arranged\nin such a way that one joint of two\nDOFs is located at the shoulder, one\njoint of one DOF is located at the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nelbow, and one joint of one DOF is located at the wrist. Operationally, three\nDOFs are moved in the same plane,\nand the remaining one on the shoulder is moved perpendicular to the\nother three for better compliance with\nground surface and more flexibility of\nsample handling. Three out of four\njoints are backdriveable, making the\nmechanism less complex and more\ncost effective.\n\nHaving joints of a robotic arm accomplish two different tasks is a new concept. The preliminary engineering\nshows this concept is workable with\nproper selection of actuators.\nThis work was done by Jun Liu, Michael\nL. Underhill, Brian P. Trease, and Randel\nA.

NPO47099\n\n29\n\nPhysical Sciences\nSuppressing Loss of Ions in an Atomic Clock\nIon traps are excited at two different frequencies.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn improvement has been made in the\ndesign of a compact, highly stable mercury-ion clock to suppress a loss of ions as\nthey are transferred between the quadrupole and higher multipole ion traps.\nSuch clocks are being developed for use\naboard spacecraft for navigation and\nplanetary radio science. The modification is also applicable to ion clocks operating on Earth: indeed, the success of the\nmodification has been demonstrated in\nconstruction and operation of a terrestrial breadboard prototype of the compact, highly stable mercury-ion clock.\nSelected aspects of the breadboard\nprototype at different stages of development were described in previous NASA\nTech Briefs articles. The following background information is reviewed from\nprevious articles: In this clock as in\nsome prior ion clocks, mercury ions are\nshuttled between two ion traps, one a 16pole linear radio-frequency trap, while\nthe other is a quadrupole radio-frequency trap. In the quadrupole trap,\nions are tightly confined and optical\nstate selection from a 202Hg lamp is carried out. In the 16-pole trap, the ions are\nmore loosely confined and atomic transitions are interrogated by use of a microwave beam at approximately 40.507\n\nGHz. The trapping of ions effectively\neliminates the frequency pulling that\nwould otherwise be caused by collisions\nbetween clock atoms and the wall of a\ngas cell. The shuttling of the ions between the two traps enables separation\nof the state-selection process from the\nclock microwave-resonance process, so\nthat each of these processes can be optimized independently of the other. This\nis similar to the operation of an atomic\nbeam clock, except that with ions the\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeam\xe2\x80\x9d can be halted and reversed as\nions are shuttled back and forth between\nthe two traps.\nWhen the two traps are driven at the\nsame radio frequency, the strength of\nconfinement can be reduced near the\njunction between the two traps, depending upon the relative phase of the RF\nvoltage used to operate each of the two\ntraps, and can cause loss of ions during\neach transit between the traps and\nthereby cause loss of the 40.507-GHz\nion-clock resonance signal.\nThe essence of the modification is to\ndrive the two traps at different frequencies \xe2\x80\x94 typically between 1.5 and 2 MHz\nfor the quadrupole trap and a frequency\na few hundred kHz higher for the 16pole trap. A frequency difference of a\n\nfew hundred kHz ensures that the ion\nmotion caused by the trapping electric\nfields is small relative to the diameter of\nthe traps. Unlike in the case in which\nboth traps are driven at the same frequency, the trapping electric fields near\nthe junction are not zero at all times; instead, the regions of low electric field\nnear the junction open and close at the\ndifference frequency. An additional benefit of making the 16-pole trap operate\nat higher frequency is that the strength\nor depth of the multipole trap can be increased independent of the quadrupole\nion trap.\nThis work was done by John Prestage and\nSang Chung of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

This simplified process\neliminates the use of radiative transfer\ncodes and reduces the number of atmospheric assumptions required to perform sensor calibrations. Like prior approaches, the simplified method\ninvolves the collection of ground truth\ndata coincident with the overpass of the\nremote sensing system being calibrated,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nbut this approach differs from the prior\ntechniques in both the nature of the\ndata collected and the manner in which\nthe data are processed.\nIn traditional vicarious radiometric\ncalibration, ground truth data are gathered using ground-viewing spectroradiometers and one or more sun photometer(s), among other instruments,\nlocated at a ground target area. The\nmeasured data from the ground-based\ninstruments are used in radiative transfer models to estimate the top-of-atmos-\n\nphere (TOA) target radiances at the\ntime of satellite overpass. These TOA radiances are compared with the satellite\nsensor readings to radiometrically calibrate the sensor.\nTraditional vicarious radiometric calibration methods require that an atmospheric model be defined such that the\nground-based observations of solar\ntransmission and diffuse-to-global ratios\nare in close agreement with the radiative\ntransfer code estimation of these parameters. This process is labor-intensive and\n\n31\n\ncomplex, and can be prone to errors.\nThe errors can be compounded because\nof approximations in the model and inaccurate assumptions about the radiative coupling between the atmosphere\nand the terrain. The errors can increase\nthe uncertainty of the TOA radiance estimates used to perform the radiometric\ncalibration.\nIn comparison, the simplified approach does not use atmospheric radiative transfer models and involves fewer assumptions concerning the radiative\ntransfer properties of the atmosphere.\nThis new technique uses two neighboring\nuniform ground target areas having different reflectance values. The target areas\ncan be natural or artificial and must be\nlarge enough to minimize adjacent-pixel\ncontamination effects. The radiative cou-\n\npling between the atmosphere and the\nterrain needs to be approximately the\nsame for the two targets. This condition\ncan be met for relatively uniform backgrounds when the distance between the\ntargets is within a few hundred meters.\nFor each target area, the radiance\nleaving the ground in the direction of\nthe satellite is measured with a radiometrically calibrated spectroradiometer.\nUsing the radiance measurements from\nthe two targets, atmospheric adjacency\nand atmospheric scattering effects can\nbe subtracted, thereby eliminating\nmany assumptions about the atmosphere and the radiative interaction between the atmosphere and the terrain.\nIn addition, the radiometrically calibrated spectroradiometer can be used\nwith a known reflectance target to esti-\n\nmate atmospheric transmission and diffuse-to-global ratios without the need\nfor ancillary sun photometers.\nSeveral comparisons between the simplified method and traditional techniques were found to agree within a few\npercent. Hence, the simplified method\nreduces the overall complexity of performing vicarious calibrations and can\nserve as a method for validating traditional radiative transfer models.\nThis work was done by Thomas Stanley of\nStennis Space Center and Robert E. Ryan,\nKara Holekamp, and Mary Pagnutti of Science Systems and Applications, Inc.\nInquiries concerning this technology should be\naddressed to the Intellectual Property Manager,\nStennis Space Center, (228) 688-1929.

An entangled-photon transmitter and optimal receiver combination\n\ncan yield up to a factor of 4 (i.e., 6 dB)\ngain in the error-probability exponent\nover a coherent state transmitter and optimal receiver combination, in a highly\nlossy and noisy scenario (when both sensors have the same number of transmitted photons). However, the receiver that\nachieves this advantage is not known.\nOne structured receiver can close half of\nthe 6-dB gap (i.e., a 3-dB improvement).\nIt is based on phase-conjugating the returned light, then performing dual-balanced difference detection with the\nstored half of the entangled-photon pair.\nActive optical sensors are of tremendous value to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions. Although\nthis work focuses on target detection, it\ncan be extended to imaging (2D, 3D, hyperspectral, etc.) scenarios as well,\nwhere the image quality can be better\n\nthan that offered by traditional active\nsensors. Although the current work is\ntheoretical, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future missions\ncould benefit significantly from developing and demonstrating this capability.\nThis is an optical receiver design whose\ncomponents are, in principle, all implementable. However, the work is currently\nentirely theoretical. It is necessary to:\n1. Demonstrate a bench-top proof of the\ntheoretical principle,\n2. Create an operational prototype offthe-bench, and\n3.

In the measurement process, the frequency of a microwave oscillator is repeatedly set at various offsets from the nominal resonance\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nNominal Resonance at Zero Offset\n1.4\xc3\x97105\n\nPhoton Counts\n\n1.3\xc3\x97105\n\nA = 104\n\n1.2\xc3\x97105\n\n1.1\xc3\x97105\n\n1\xc3\x97105\n\xe2\x80\x934\n\n\xe2\x80\x933\n\n\xe2\x80\x932\n\n\xe2\x80\x931\n0\n1\nRelative Frequency Offset\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThese Three Plots represent fits of the nonlinear curve to three sets of simulated measurements, each\nset comprising photon counts at relative frequency offsets (y values) of 0 and \xc2\xb10.761. The parameters\nof the simulated measurements were B = 1.05 \xc3\x97 105 counts, A = 3 \xc3\x97 104 counts, and signal-to-noise\nratio \xe2\x89\x8830.\n\nfrequency, the oscillator signal is applied\nin a square pulse of the oscillator signal\nhaving a suitable duration (typically, of\nthe order of a second), and, for each\npulse at each frequency offset, fluorescence photons of the transition in question are counted. As described below,\nthe counts are used to determine a new\nnominal resonance frequency. Thereafter, offsets are determined with respect\nto the new resonance frequency. The\nprocess as described thus far is repeated\nso as to repeatedly adjust the oscillator\nto track the most recent estimate of the\nnominal resonance frequency.\n\nThe theoretical nonlinear curve is\nthat of the Rabi equation for the shape\nof the resonance peak\nsin2\nP (y ) =\n\n2\n\n1+ y2\n\n1+ y2\n\nwhere the dimensionless variable y is related to the duration of the microwave\npulse, T, and the frequency offset \xce\xbd \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xbd0\nfrom the atomic absorption frequency,\n\xce\xbd0 , as follows: y= 2T(\xce\xbd \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xbd0).\nAssuming that the signal power has\nbeen optimized and that the photon\n\ncount at a given measurement signal frequency includes a non-resonant background contribution plus a contribution\nattributable to the resonance, the basic\nmeasurement equation for the ith measurement is\nC(i) = B + AP(y1 \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xb5)\nwhere C(i) is the atomic fluorescence\nphoton count, A is atomic fluorescence,\nand \xce\xb5 is an offset of the nominal resonance frequency from the actual resonance frequency. If measurements are\nmade at three different oscillator frequency offsets (y1, y2, y3), then one has\nC(1) = B + AP(y1 \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xb5)\nC(2) = B + AP(y2 \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xb5)\nC(3) = B + AP(y3 \xe2\x80\x93 \xce\xb5)\nRepeatedly, for the most recent such\nset of three measurements (see figure), this set of three equations is inverted to extract B, A, and \xce\xb5 from the\nmeasurement values C(1), C(2), and\nC(3). Because the solution obtained\nthrough inversion of the three equations separates the influences of background light, signal strength, and the\noffset of the resonance from the nominal resonance frequency, unlike in a\nprior method, drift in the power of\nthe lamp used to excite the clock\natoms to the upper level of the transition does not seem to effect frequency\npulling (that is, it does not seem to\nforce a change in the estimate of the\nresonance frequency).\nThis work was done by John D. Prestage,\nSang K. Chung, and Meirong Tu of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Further\ninformation is contained in a TSP (see page\n1). NPO-45958\n\nMeasurement of the Length of an Optical Trap\nThis technique aids in the assembly of MEMS devices.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nNASA Glenn has been involved in developing optical trapping and optical\nmicromanipulation techniques in order\nto develop a tool that can be used to\nprobe, characterize, and assemble nano\nand microscale materials to create microscale sensors for harsh flight environments. In order to be able to assemble a sensor or probe candidate sensor\nmaterial, it is useful to know how far an\noptical trap can \xe2\x80\x9creach\xe2\x80\x9d; that is, the distance beyond/below the stable trapping\npoint through which an object will be\ndrawn into the optical trap. Typically, to\nmeasure the distance over which an op-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\ntical trap would influence matter in a\nhorizontal (perpendicular to beam\npropagation) direction, it was common\nto hold an object in one optical trap,\nplace a second optical trap a known distance away, turn off the first optical trap,\nand note if the object was moved into\nthe second trap when it was turned on.\nThe disadvantage of this technique is\nthat it only gives information of trap influence distance in horizontal (x\xe2\x80\x93y) directions. No information about the distance of the influence of the trap is\ngained in the direction of propagation\nof the beam (the z direction).\n\nA method was developed to use a timeof-flight technique to determine the\nlength along the propagation direction of\nan optical trap beam over which an object\nmay be drawn into the optical trap. Test\nobjects (polystyrene microspheres) were\nheld in an optical trap in a water-filled\nsample chamber and raised to a pre-determined position near the top of the sample\nchamber. Next, the test objects were released by blocking the optical trap beam.\nThe test objects were allowed to fall\nthrough the water for predetermined periods of time, at the end of which the trapping beam was unblocked. It was noted\n\n33\n\nwhether or not the test object returned to\nthe optical trap or continued to fall.\nThis determination of the length of an\noptical trap\xe2\x80\x99s influence by this manner assumes that the test object falls through\nthe water in the sample chamber at terminal velocity for the duration of its fall, so\nthat the distance of trap influence can be\ncomputed simply by: d = VTt, where d is\nthe trap length (or distance of trap\nreach), VT is the terminal velocity of the\ntest object, and t is the time interval over\nwhich the object is allowed to fall. In\norder for this methodology to work, it\nmust be established that the test object indeed falls through the water in the sam-\n\nple chamber at terminal velocity. This answers the question of how far below the\ntrap point an object must be to be drawn\ninto an optical trap in order to select and\nmanipulate material for microscale assembly and characterization.\nThis methodology would make it possible for optical trapping to be incorporated into the assembly of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) devices. In\nparticular, adding pieces or connectors\nto MEMS devices that cannot be positioned via photolithography and vapor\nor film deposition techniques may be\nadded to a MEMS device via placement\nby optical traps. In this case, it is impera-\n\ntive to know how far beyond the stable\ntrapping point in the direction of propagation of the beam an object should or\nmust be to be trapped, and also the distance beyond the stable optical trapping\npoint over which the propagating laser\nbeam has no effect.\nThis work was done by Susan Y.

This property rigidly connects\nthe phase variation of the field in this\nmode with the azimuthal angle between\nthe coupling locations.\nA WGM with orbital momentum L has\nexactly L instant nodes around the circumference of the WGM resonator supporting such a mode. Therefore, in two\nlocations separated by the arc \xce\xb1, the\nphase difference of such a field will be\n\nequal to \xcf\x86 = \xce\xb1L. Coupling the field out of\nsuch locations, and into a balanced interferometer, once can observe a complete\nconstructive or distractive interference\n(or have any situation in between) depending on the angle \xce\xb1. Similarly, a mode\nL + \xce\x94L will pick up the phase \xcf\x86 + \xce\xb1\xce\x94L.\nIn all applications of a WGM resonator as a modulator, the orbital numbers for the carrier and sidebands are\ndifferent, and their differences \xce\x94L are\nknown (usually, but not necessarily, \xce\x94L =\n1).

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nLeak detection and location remain\na common problem in NASA and industry, where gas leaks can create hazardous conditions if not quickly detected and corrected. In order to help\nrectify this problem, this design equips\nan infrared (IR) camera with the\nmeans to make gas leaks of IR-absorbing gases more visible for leak detection and location.\nBy comparing the output of two IR\ncameras (or two pictures from the\nsame camera under essentially identical conditions and very closely spaced\nin time) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, one\ncan cancel out all but the desired varia-\n\n34\n\ntions that correspond to the IR absorption of the gas of interest. This can be\nsimply done by absorbing the IR lines\nthat correspond to the gas of interest\nfrom the radiation received by one of\nthe cameras by the intervention of a filter that removes the particular wavelength of interest from the \xe2\x80\x9creference\xe2\x80\x9d\npicture. This can be done most sensitively with a gas filter (filled with the\ngas of interest) placed in front of the\nIR detector array, or (less sensitively)\nby use of a suitable line filter in the\nsame location.\nThis arrangement would then be balanced against the unfiltered \xe2\x80\x9cmeasure-\n\nment\xe2\x80\x9d picture, which will have variations\nfrom IR absorption from the gas of interest. By suitable processing of the signals\nfrom each pixel in the two IR pictures,\nthe user can display only the differences\nin the signals. Either a difference or a\nratio output of the two signals is feasible.\nFrom a gas concentration viewpoint, the\nratio could be processed to show the column depth of the gas leak. If a variation\nin the background IR light intensity is\npresent in the field of view, then large\nchanges in the difference signal will\noccur for the same gas column concentration between the background and the\ncamera. By ratioing the outputs, the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nCamera #1\n\nGas Filter\nCamera #2\n\nIMeas\nIRef\n\nIMeas\nIRef\n\nThe Two-Camera Version of the Infrared Camera System features two cameras with essentially the\nsame view and time.\n\nsame signal ratio is obtained for both\nhigh- and low-background signals, even\nthough the low-signal areas may have\ngreater noise content due to their\n\nsmaller signal strength. Thus, one embodiment would use a ratioed output\nsignal to better represent the gas column concentration.\n\nAn alternative approach uses a simpler multiplication of the filtered signal\nto make the filtered signal equal to the\nunfiltered signal at most locations, followed by a subtraction to remove all but\nthe wavelength-specific absorption in\nthe unfiltered sample. This signal processing can also reveal the net difference signal representing the leaking gas\nabsorption, and allow rapid leak location, but signal intensity would not relate solely to gas absorption, as raw signal intensity would also affect the\ndisplayed signal.\nA second design choice is whether to\nuse one camera with two images closely\nspaced in time, or two cameras with essentially the same view and time. The figure shows the two-camera version. This\nchoice involves many tradeoffs that are\nnot apparent until some detailed testing\nis done. In short, the tradeoffs involve\nthe temporal changes in the field picture versus the pixel sensitivity curves\nand frame alignment differences with\ntwo cameras, and which system would\nlead to the smaller variations from the\nuncontrolled variables.\nThis work was done by Robert Youngquist\nand Dale Lueck of Kennedy Space Center\nand Christopher Immer and Robert Cox of\nASRC Aerospace Corporation.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nAn innovative fiber-optic sensor has\nbeen developed for low-thrust-level settled mass gauging with measurement\nuncertainty <0.5 percent over cryogenic\npropellant tank fill levels from 2 to 98\npercent. The proposed sensor uses a single optical fiber to measure liquid level\nand liquid distribution of cryogenic propellants. Every point of the sensing fiber\nis a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint sensor\xe2\x80\x9d that not only distinguishes liquid and vapor, but also measures temperature. This sensor is able to\ndetermine the physical location of each\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoint sensor\xe2\x80\x9d with 1-mm spatial resolution. Acting as a continuous array of numerous liquid/vapor point sensors, the\ntruly distributed optical sensing fiber\ncan be installed in a propellant tank in\nthe same manner as silicon diode point\nsensor stripes using only a single feedthrough to connect to an optical signal\ninterrogation unit outside the tank.\n\nEither water or liquid nitrogen levels\ncan be measured within 1-mm spatial\nresolution up to a distance of 70 meters\nfrom the optical interrogation unit.\nThis liquid-level sensing technique was\nalso compared to the pressure gauge\nmeasurement technique in water and\nliquid nitrogen contained in a vertical\ncopper pipe with a reasonable degree of\naccuracy. It has been demonstrated that\nthe sensor can measure liquid levels in\nmultiple containers containing water or\nliquid nitrogen with one signal interrogation unit. The liquid levels measured\nby the multiple fiber sensors were consistent with those virtually measured by\na ruler.\nThe sensing performance of various optical fibers has been measured, and has\ndemonstrated that they can survive after\nimmersion at cryogenic temperatures. The\nfiber strength in liquid nitrogen has also\n\nbeen measured. Multiple water level tests\nwere also conducted under various actual\nand theoretical vibration conditions, and\ndemonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio\nunder these vibration conditions, insofar\nas it affects measurement accuracy, is manageable and robust enough for a wide variety of spacecraft applications. A simple solution has been developed to absorb\noptical energy at the termination of the optical sensor, thereby avoiding any feedback\nto the optical interrogation unit.\nThis work was done by Wei Xu of Broadband Photonics for Glenn Research Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto NASA Glenn Research Center, Innovative\nPartnerships Office, Attn: Steve Fedor, Mail\nStop 4\xe2\x80\x938, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland,\nOhio 44135.

These sys-\n\n36\n\ntems require careful material selection\nand system processing (cleaning and\nhigh-temperature bake-out). Even\nunder the most careful preparation,\nresidual hydrogen outgassing from vacuum chamber walls typically limits the\nbase pressure.\nNon-evaporable\ngetter\npumps\n(NEGs) provide a convenient pumping\noption for sealed systems because of\n\nlow mass and volume, and no power\nonce activated. However, NEGs do not\npump inert gases, methane, and some\nother hydrocarbon gases. For ultrahigh vacuum applications, methane\ncan become the single largest unpumped component. Methane collisions with trapped ions (such as\n199Hg+) used for frequency standard\napplications can produce de-coher-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nence and a very large frequency shift,\nboth significant limitations to high-performance frequency standard operation. Therefore, any methane presence, or buildup in the vacuum system\nover time, can negate the benefit of\ngetter pumping and degrade frequency\nstandard performance.\nIt is well known that the presence of a\nhot surface at or above a particular temperature threshold in a vacuum cham-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nber can \xe2\x80\x9ccrack\xe2\x80\x9d residual methane (CH4\nor other similar hydrocarbons) , dissociating it into C and H2 . Each of these\ncan be readily removed by a getter\npump. This cracking process can occur\nwhen methane molecules interact with\nthe hot tungsten filament of an ion\ngauge (ionization-assisted gettering). In\nthis case, methane molecules are dissociated either via direct interaction with\nthe hot filament or via electron impact.\n\nThus an ion gauge in conjunction with\na NEG can be used to provide a lowmass, low-power method for avoiding\nthe deleterious effects of methane\nbuildup in high-performance frequency\nstandard vacuum systems.\nThis work was done by Robert L.

A major issue that arises in this research is the following question: What\ninvariants of mathematical models of\nthe physics of systems are (1) characteristic of the behaviors of intelligent living\nsystems and (2) do not depend on specific features of material compositions\nheretofore considered to be characteristic of life?\nThis research at earlier stages has\nbeen reported, albeit from different perspectives, in numerous previous NASA\nTech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: One\nof the main underlying ideas is to extend the application of physical first\nprinciples to the behaviors of living systems. Mathematical models of motor dynamics are used to simulate the observ-\n\nable physical behaviors of systems or objects of interest, and models of mental\ndynamics are used to represent the evolution of the corresponding knowledge\nbases. For a given system, the knowledge\nbase is modeled in the form of probability distributions and the mental dynamics is represented by models of the evolution of the probability densities or,\nequivalently, models of flows of information.\nAt the time of reporting the information for this article, the focus of this research was upon the following aspects of\nthe formalism: Intelligence is considered to be a means by which a living system preserves itself and improves its ability to survive and is further considered to\nmanifest itself in feedback from the\nmental dynamics to the motor dynamics.\nBecause of the feedback from the mental dynamics, the motor dynamics attains\nquantumlike properties: The trajectory\n\nof the physical aspect of the system in\nthe space of dynamical variables splits\ninto a family of different trajectories,\nand each of those trajectories can be\nchosen with a probability prescribed by\nthe mental dynamics.\nFrom a slightly different perspective,\nthe mechanism of decision-making is\nfeedback from the mental dynamics to\nthe motor dynamics, and this mechanism provides a quantumlike collapse of\na random motion into an appropriate\ndeterministic state, such that entropy\nundergoes a pronounced decrease. The\nexistence of this mechanism is considered to be an invariant of intelligent behavior of living systems, regardless of\nthe origins and material compositions\nof the systems.\nThis work was done by Michail Zak of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.For more\ninformation, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov.\nNPO-46085\n\nRocket-Plume Spectroscopy Simulation for Hydrocarbon-Fueled\nRocket Engines\nEnhanced simulation includes code for new electronic bands in the 300-to-850-nm\nspectral bands.\nStennis Space Center, Mississippi\nThe UV-Vis spectroscopic system for\nplume diagnostics monitors rocket engine health by using several analytical\ntools developed at Stennis Space Center\n(SSC), including the rocket plume spectroscopy simulation code (RPSSC), to\nidentify and quantify the alloys from the\nmetallic elements observed in engine\nplumes. Because the hydrocarbon-fueled rocket engine is likely to contain\nC2, CO, CH, CN, and NO in addition to\nOH and H2O, the relevant electronic\nbands of these molecules in the spectral\nrange of 300 to 850 nm in the RPSSC\nhave been included.\nSSC incorporated several enhancements and modifications to the original\nline-by-line spectral simulation com-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nputer program implemented for plume\nspectral data analysis and quantification\nin 1994. These changes made the program applicable to the Space Shuttle\nMain Engine (SSME) and the Diagnostic Testbed Facility Thruster (DTFT) exhaust plume spectral data. Modifications\nincluded updating the molecular and\nspectral parameters for OH, adding\nspectral parameter input files optimized\nfor the 10 elements of interest in the\nspectral range from 320 to 430 nm and\nlinking the output to graphing and\nanalysis packages. Additionally, the ability to handle the non-uniform wavelength interval at which the spectral\ncomputations are made was added. This\nallowed a precise superposition of wave-\n\nlengths at which the spectral measurements have been made with the wavelengths at which the spectral computations are done by using the line-by-line\n(LBL) code.\nTo account for hydrocarbon combustion products in the plume, which might\ninterfere with detection and quantification of metallic elements in the spectral\nregion of 300 to 850 nm, the spectroscopic code has been enhanced to include the carbon-based combustion\nspecies of C2, CO, and CH. In addition,\nCN and NO have spectral bands in 300 to\n850 nm and, while these molecules are\nnot direct products of hydrocarbon-oxygen combustion systems, they can show\nup if nitrogen or a nitrogen compound is\n\n39\n\npresent as an impurity in the propellants\nand/or these can form in the boundary\nlayer as a result of interaction of the hot\nplume with the atmosphere during the\nground testing of engines. Ten additional\nelectronic band systems of these five molecules have been included into the code.\nA comprehensive literature search was\nconducted to obtain the most accurate\nvalues for the molecular and the spectral\nparameters, including Franck-Cordon\nfactors and electronic transition moments for all ten band systems.\n\nFor each elemental transition in the\nRPSSC, six spectral parameters \xe2\x80\x94\nDoppler broadened line width at halfheight, pressure-broadened line width\nat half-height, electronic multiplicity of\nthe upper state, electronic term energy\nof the upper state, Einstein transition\nprobability coefficient, and the atomic\nline center \xe2\x80\x94 are required. Input files\nhave been created for ten elements of\nNi, Fe, Cr, Co, Cu, Ca, Mn, Al, Ag, and\nPd, which retain only relatively moderate to strong transitions in 300 to 430\n\nnm spectral range for each element.\nThe number of transitions in the input\nfiles is 68 for Ni; 148 for Fe; 6 for Cr; 87\nfor Co; 1 for Ca; 3 for Mn; 2 each for\nCu, Al, and Ag; and 11 for Pd.\nThis work was done by Gopal D.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cspoken dialogue\nsystems\xe2\x80\x9d signifies unified software systems containing speech-recognition,\nspeech-synthesis, dialogue management, and ancillary components that\nenable human users to communicate,\nusing natural spoken language or\nnearly natural prescribed spoken language, with other software systems that\nprovide information and/or services.\nThe research is proceeding on several\nfronts: recognition of speech signals,\nsyntactic and semantic parsing, language modeling, discourse analysis,\nand contact modeling.\nMany of the advances made thus far in\nthis research have been incorporated\ninto a voice-enabled procedure-browser\nand reader, called Clarissa, that has been\ntested aboard the International Space\nStation. [A procedure-browser and\nreader is essentially a software version of\nan instruction manual that may describe\none or more possibly complex procedure(s).] Major problems that have been\naddressed in developing Clarissa include\ncreating voice-navigable versions of formal procedure documents, grammarbased speech recognition, methods for\naccurate detection of user\xe2\x80\x99s speech directed toward a listener other than\nClarissa based on grammar filtering or\nsupport vector machines, and robust,\nside-effect-free dialogue management for\nenabling undoing, correction, and/or\nconfirmation of steps of a procedure.\nClarissa enables the user to navigate\na complex procedure using only spo-\n\n40\n\nken input and output, making it unnecessary for the user to shift visual attention from the task at hand to a paper\ninstruction manual or to an equivalent\ndocument displayed on a computer\nscreen. Clarissa also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for optional visual display of information. Clarissa has\na vocabulary of about 260 words and\nsupports about 75 different commands,\nincluding commands for reading steps\nof the procedure, scrolling forward or\nbackward in the procedure, moving to\nan arbitrary new step, reviewing noncurrent steps, adding and removing\nvoice notes, displaying pictures, setting\nand canceling alarms and timers, requiring challenges to verify critical\ncommands, and querying the system as\nto status of the procedure.\nClarissa includes the following main\nsoftware modules:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Speech Processor \xe2\x80\x94 Performs lowlevel speech-recognition (input) and\nspeech-synthesis (output) functions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Semantic Analyzer \xe2\x80\x94 Converts output\nfrom the speech processor into an abstract dialogue move.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Response Filter \xe2\x80\x94 Decides whether to\naccept or reject the spoken input from\nthe user.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dialogue Manager \xe2\x80\x94 Converts abstract dialogue moves into abstract dialogue actions, and maintains knowledge of both the context of the\ndiscourse and the progress through\nthe procedure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Output Manager \xe2\x80\x94 Accepts abstract\ndialogue actions from the Dialogue\nManager and converts them into lists\nof procedure calls that result in concrete system responses, which can in-\n\nclude spoken output, requests for display of visual output on the GUI, or\nsending dialogue moves back to the\nDialogue Manager.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GUI Module \xe2\x80\x94 Mediates conventional keyboard and screen-based interaction with the user and accepts\ndisplay requests from the Output Manager. This module can also convert\nkeyboard input from the user into dialogue moves, which are sent to the Dialogue Manager.\nAnother accomplishment of this research has been the development of a\ntargeted-help module that is highly\nportable in that it can be added to a spoken dialogue system, with minimal application-specific modifications, to make\nthe spoken dialogue system more robust.\nThe targeted-help module is intended,\nmore specifically, for incorporation into\na spoken dialogue system in which, as in\nClarissa, there is a prescribed spoken language containing a limited number of\nwords. The purpose served by the targeted-help module is to assist an untrained user to learn the prescribed language by providing help messages in\nresponse to out-of-coverage users\xe2\x80\x99 utterances (that is, users\xe2\x80\x99 utterances outside\nthe prescribed language). These messages can be much more informative\nthan \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x9d and\nvariants thereof generated by older, lesscapable spoken dialogue systems.\nThe targeted-help module includes\ntwo submodules that run simultaneously: a grammar-based recognizer and\na statistical language model (SLM).\nWhen the grammar-based recognizer\nsucceeds, the ordinarily-less-accurate\nhypothesis generated by the SLM rec-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nognizer is not used. When the grammar-based recognizer fails and the SLM\nrecognizer produces a recognition hypothesis, the SLM output is processed\nto generate a message that tells the\nuser what was recognized as having\nbeen uttered, a diagnosis of what was\nproblematic about the recognized ut-\n\nterance, and a related in-coverage example. The in-coverage example is intended to encourage alignment between the user\xe2\x80\x99s utterances and the\nprescribed language.\nThis work was done by Gregory Aist and\nJames Hieronymus of the Research Institute for\nAdvanced Computer Science; John Dowding\n\nand Beth Ann Hockey of the University of California, Santa Cruz; Manny Rayner of the International Computer Science Institute; Nikos\nChatzichrisafis of the University of Geneva;\nKim Farrell of QSS; and Jean-Michel Renders\nof Xerox Research Center Europe for Ames Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nTwo algorithms have been conceived\nto enable automated, thorough testing\nof Built-in test (BIT) software. The first\nalgorithm applies to BIT routines that\ndefine pass/fail criteria based on values\nof data read from such hardware devices\nas memories, input ports, or registers.\nThis algorithm simulates effects of errors in a device under test by (1) intercepting data from the device and (2)\nperforming AND operations between\nthe data and the data mask specific to\nthe device. This operation yields values\nnot expected by the BIT routine. This algorithm entails very small, permanent\ninstrumentation of the software under\n\ntest (SUT) for performing the AND operations.\nThe second algorithm applies to BIT\nprograms that provide services to users\xe2\x80\x99\napplication programs via commands or\ncallable interfaces and requires a capability for test-driver software to read and\nwrite the memory used in execution of\nthe SUT. This algorithm identifies all\nSUT code execution addresses where\nerrors are to be injected, then temporarily replaces the code at those addresses with small test code sequences\nto inject latent severe errors, then determines whether, as desired, the SUT detects the errors and recovers.\n\nThis work was done by Thomas K.

Increasing the effective aerobraking area of a\nspacecraft (without significantly increasing spacecraft mass) results in a corresponding reduction in the time required\nfor aerobraking. For example, if the effective area of a spacecraft is doubled,\nthe time required for aerobraking is\nroughly reduced to half the previous\nvalue. The dedicated deployable aerobraking structure thus enables significantly shorter aerobraking phases,\nwhich results in reduced mission cost,\nrisk, and allows science operations to\nbegin earlier in the mission.\nIn order to achieve a large area without\nimpacting the spacecraft or launch vehicle, a deployable structure is necessary.\nThe dedicated deployable aerobraking\nstructure uses a set of deployable rigid\n\xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d to deploy and support a large\nmembrane. The membrane is made of\nmaterial (Kapton, for example) that can\nwithstand the thermal and mechanical\nloads characteristic of aerobraking. Once\naerobreaking is complete, this aerobraking structure would be jettisoned into an\natmosphere-intercepting orbit and subsequently destroyed upon atmospheric\nentry. This concept uses a mechanical implementation distinct from inflatable\naerodynamic decelerators studied for aerocapture and other applications. Aerobraking requires multiple passes through\nthe atmosphere over several weeks (at\nleast), and so any small leaks or punctures that develop in an inflatable structure during that time could compromise\nthe inflatable structure; this makes inflatable structures a higher risk implementation for an aerobraking structure relative\nto the mechanical implementation used\nin this concept.\nTentative mechanical and thermal requirements for this technology have\nbeen developed. Full-scale proof of concept hardware corresponding to one\nquadrant of a 72 m2 aerobraking structure was successfully designed, fabricated, deployed, and tested. The lab\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\ntests were designed so that the mechanical loads in the 1-g lab environment\nwere higher than the anticipated aerobraking loads, which proved the structure could survive in flight. Finite element models were developed and found\nto be in good agreement with the proofof-concept hardware. Thermal and attitude stability aspects of the concept\nwere analyzed. Based on the preliminary requirements, hardware tests, computational models, and analyses developed, the concept was found to be\nviable using conventional engineering\nmaterials and techniques.\nIn addition to potential use on planetary missions, this technology can also be\nused as an inexpensive, robust, and reliable method for reducing orbital debris\nhazards in Earth orbit by increasing the\nrate of orbital decay of objects in orbit\nabout the Earth such as decommissioned satellites and spent launch vehicle upper stages.\nThis work was done by Louis R.

The portability of the\nhardware makes it quick and easy to\ntransport between test facilities. This\nhardware/software architecture is flexible enough to support a variety of diagnostic applications and test hardware,\nand the GUI-based rapid prototyping\ncapability is sufficient to support devel-\n\nopment, execution, and testing of custom diagnostic algorithms.\nThe PHALT operating system supports\nexecution of diagnostic algorithms\nunder real-time constraints. PHALT can\nperform real-time capture and playback\nof test rig data with the ability to augment/modify the data stream (e.g. inject\nsimulated faults). It performs algorithm\ntesting using a variety of data input\nsources, including real-time data acquisition, test data playback, and system simulations, and also provides system feedback to evaluate closed-loop diagnostic\nresponse and mitigation control.\nThis work was done by Kevin J.

To\nsolve this problem, a model has been developed for the resonant frequency and\nquality factor of a cylindrical microwave\ncavity containing concentric cylindrical\nsamples. This model can then be inverted\nto obtain the real and imaginary dielectric constants of the material of interest.\nThis approach is based on using exact\nsolutions to Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s equations for the\nresonant properties of a cylindrical microwave cavity and also using the effective electrical conductivity of the cavity\nwalls that is estimated from the measured empty cavity quality factor. This\nnew approach calculates the complex\nresonant frequency and associated electromagnetic fields for a cylindrical mi-\n\n43\n\ncrowave cavity with lossy walls that is\nloaded with concentric, axially aligned,\nlossy dielectric cylindrical samples. In\nthis approach, the calculated complex\nresonant frequency, consisting of real\nand imaginary parts, is related to the experimentally measured quantities.\nBecause this approach uses Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s\nequations to determine the perturbed\nelectromagnetic fields in the cavity with\nthe material(s) inserted, one can calculate the expected wall losses using the\nfields for the loaded cavity rather than\njust depending on the value of the fields\nobtained from the empty cavity quality\n\n44\n\nfactor. These additional calculations\nprovide a more accurate determination\nof the complex dielectric constant of the\nmaterial being studied. The improved\napproach will be particularly important\nwhen working with larger samples or\nsamples with larger dielectric constants\nthat will further perturb the cavity electromagnetic fields. Also, this approach\nenables the ability to have a larger sample of interest, such as a liquid or powdered or granulated solid, inside a cylindrical container.\nThis work was done by Martin B.
