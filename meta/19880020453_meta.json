Specific products to be generated during this task were three trade studies and a conceptual design of the Logistic Supply Module. The crew size study was performed to evaluate crew sizes from the baseline size of four to a crew size of eight and determine the preferred crew size. The second trade study was to determine the impact of extending surface stay times and recommend a preferred duration of stay time as a function of crew, consumables, and equipment support capabilities. The third trade study was an evaluation of packaging and storage methods to determine the preferred logistics approach to support the lunar base. A modified scenario was developed and served as the basis of the individual trade studies. Assumptions and guidelines were also developed from experience with Apollo programs, Space Shuttle operations, and Space Station studies. With this information, the trade studies were performed and a conceptual design for the Logistic Supply Module was developed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880020453, "id": "2136b294e38949078886d395da50dc39", "publicationDate": "1988-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880020453.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880020453/downloads/19880020453.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880020453/downloads/19880020453.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880020453/downloads/19880020453.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
