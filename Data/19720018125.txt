b"TECHNOLOGY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, 1970\n\nTELEMETRY\n\n87\n\nREMOTE MODULES\n\nJ. R. Silverman\n\nThe Telemetry\nRemote Module development\nhas been an outgrowth\nof\na GSFC-initiated\ninvestigation\ninto methods of improving data gathering\ncapabilities.\nThis effort has provided, after an initial group of competitive\nstudies, a fully operational\nbreadboard\nand engineering model which meets\nall design goals.\nThe technique\nI am discussing forms the basis for a decentralized\ntelemetry\nsystem which employs small, low powered modules capable of\ndistributing\nthe multiplexer\ninput gates around the spacecraft rather than\nconcentrating\nthem in one centralized location. These modules operate, in\nessence, as a harness reducer, allowing data to be transmitted\nback to a\ncentral control core for inclusion in the telemetry bit stream.\nThe remote\n\nmodule\n\ndeveloped\n\nin this effort\n\nis shown in Figure\n\n1. Each\n\nunit is capable of accepting 32 data points in various combinations\nof analog\nand/or\ndigital input information.\nThese inputs can be controlled\neither\nthrough\nmodule\n\na hardwired\nor programable\ncentral control core sequence. Each\nweighs 113 g, occupies 98 cm 3, and requires a maximum power of\n\n1.3 W during the interrogate\n\nmode.\n\nSystem applications\nof the remote modules and several of the reasons\nwhy this development\nhas been pursued and the advantages which can be\nderived from remote modules are illustrated\nin Figure 2. The central control\ncore and gate address generator serve to generate the sequence of addresses\nfor the data points being sampled and for the formating of data. These items\nare not per se part of this development.\nAlso, the total weights, size, and\npower parameters\nfor both a remote module decentralized\nsystem and a\ncentralized\nsystem, with the same basic data gathering capabilities,\nare\nroughly equivalent.\nA prime advantage in the utilization of decentralized\nremote modules is\na reduction\nin the number of interconnecting\nwires between the central\n\ng8\n\nGODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER\n\ncontrol core and the data inputs. Where previously each of the 32 data\ninputs would require separate harness wires, the use of remote module\npermits the 32 fines previously required to be reduced to five. The weight\nuvings\nalone for major spacecraft requiring long runs can be quite\nsignificant.\nThere is also a more subtle advantage in that additional\nflexibility in specifying harness wire interface requirements is achieved.\nAnother advantage of the remote module is that data gathering\ncapabilities can be tailored more closely to user requirements.\nFigure 2\nillustrates how this building-block\napproach of one or more remote modules\nper user could be implemented.\nThe last item I will discuss here is the universality\n\nwhich has been built\n\ninto the system. This is typified by the capability of intermixing\ninputs in\nseveral combinations\nof analog or digital data. Flexibility is also designed\ninto the system's ability to accept analog data in the range from +10 to\n-10 V. The data rate also provides flexibility in that it can vary from 0 to\n3200 channels per second with a digital resolution of 8 bits per word.\nThe above discussion has been an attempt to summarize a development\nthat has produced\na system which meets several fundamental\nspacecraft\nneeds: standardization,\nincrease in system simplicity, and greater flexibility\nin the use of telemetry systems.\n\n89\n\nTECHNOLOGY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, 1970\n\nFigure 1-Engineering model of remote module.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nI\n\n,\n\nFigure 2-Remote module implcmentation.\n\nR Y\n\n"
