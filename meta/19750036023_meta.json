This rock is believed to have formed as a result of very slow cooling at a depth of 10 to 40 km, and hence furnishes direct evidence that the moon was chemically zoned before 4.26 G.y. The age of the rock is associated with the Serenitatis Basin forming event. The formation of the Serenitatis Basin is then deduced to have occurred 4.26 plus or minus 0.02 G.y. ago, about 300 m.y. before the Imbrium event.  It appears that the major basin forming era on the near side of the moon lasted longer than 300 m.y. The grouping of many lunar rock ages  at 3.9 to 4.0 G.y. is most likely due to the fact that the Imbrium ejecta predominates all highland landing sites.", "title": "Lunar evolution - The first 600 million years", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750036023, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Husain, L."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f62345f7f467429295779d45dc052a1f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19750036023, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schaeffer, O.
