The developed method consists in determining the displacements of adjacent lines by locating the maximum of the correlation profile between the two lines. Then the line to line displacement is used to characterize the TM instrument in respect to: scan to scan jitter and image skew, scan profile non-linearity, along scan jitter, detector to detector displacement, and band to band displacement. To verify the quality of the reported performance parameters, some extracted geometric parameters were used to correct the original raw data. Comparison between P-tape data and results of reprocessed data shows no significant differences in an area of 1024 x 1024 pixels.", "title": "TM Geometric Performance:  Line to Line Displacement Analysis (LLDA)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T15:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850013422, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fusco, L."}, "organization": {"name": "European Space Agency.
