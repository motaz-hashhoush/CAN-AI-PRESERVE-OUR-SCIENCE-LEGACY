Changing the surface texture with grooving, grinding and shot peening, use of chemicals to remove or prevent accumulation of natural or man-made contaminants, and the use of new techniques and materials are discussed as means of improving surface friction performance. Test data are presented to illustrate the effects of runway conditions on aircraft ground performance. The severity of the problem of operating on runway surfaces which cannot provide sufficient aircraft tire friction capability is also illustrated from documented aircraft accident/incident reports. The paper concludes with recommendations for future pavement research activities.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Hungary", "submissionId": 20020085368, "endDate": "2002-03-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Flight Safety Foundation, Inc.", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "d6dd422fdef94e2191d8b8051b5ccfeb", "id": "49ed6292d4df4fd8ab2ebbd126316fec"}], "name": "Flight Safety Foundation''s 14th Annual European Aviation Safety Seminar", "location": "Budapest", "id": "d6dd422fdef94e2191d8b8051b5ccfeb", "startDate": "2002-03-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020085368, "id": "887ca02c16494d0d993950e13c997431", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020085368.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020085368/downloads/20020085368.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020085368/downloads/20020085368.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020085368/downloads/20020085368.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
