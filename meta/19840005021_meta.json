These variations are described in terms of the solar cycle variations of coronal holes, streamers, and transients. The solar wind signatures of the three features are discussed in turn, with special emphasis on the signature of transients, which is still in the process of being defined. It is proposed that magnetic clouds be identified with helium abundance enhancements and that they form the head of a transient surrounded by streamer like plasma, with an optional shock front. It is stressed that relative values of a parameter through a solar cycle should be compared beginning with the declining phase, especially in the case of magnetic field magnitude.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840005021, "id": "4990e472a9354736a702ca81784347df", "publicationName": "JPL  Solar Wind Five", "publicationDate": "1983-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19840004999, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Solar Wind Five", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840005021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840005021/downloads/19840005021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840005021/downloads/19840005021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840005021/downloads/19840005021.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
