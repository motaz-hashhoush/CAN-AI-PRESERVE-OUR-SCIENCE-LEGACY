This capability developed by NASA Ames Research Center is a\nunique way for Scientists and Engineers to gather important Earth science\ndata as well as perform flight research using an innovative, safe, and costeffective aerial platform. This poster describes the aircraft system\narchitecture, capabilities, and provides an overview of current payloads and\nmission concepts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMax Payload Weight at Max Fuel 28.6 Kg 63 lbs\nMax Payload Weight at Min Fuel 61.2 Kg 135 lbs\nPayload Power Provided\n16 Amps, 24 VDC\nScalable nose accommodates a wide range of instrument sizes, can be\ncustomized for irregularly shaped payloads, can be modified to facilitate\ninlets, antennas, access, data retrieval, are relatively inexpensive and can\nbe made available to PI\xe2\x80\x99s to work with\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Payload Volume Useful Inner Dimensions\nStandard (Small) Nose\n28 x 33 x 28 cm 11 x 13 x 11\xe2\x80\x9d\nLarge Nose\n53 x 43 x 43 cm 21 x 17 x 17\xe2\x80\x9d\nForward Fuselage (batteries aft) 48 x 34 x 38 cm 19 x 13 x 15\xe2\x80\x9d\nAft Fuselage (batteries forward) 26 x 34 x 29 cm 10 x 13 x 12\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAircraft and System Performance Specifications\nWing Span\nLength\nHeight\nMax Gross Takeoff Weight (MGTOW)\nUseful Load (fuel + payload)\nMax Fuel Load\nService Ceiling\nBest Cruise Speed\nMax Operating Speed\nMax Endurance\nMax Range\n\n6.1 m\n3.9 m\n1.5 m\n217.7 Kg\n74.8 Kg\n64.4 L\n3,962+ m\n54 to 59 kn\n85 kn\n8.8 hrs\n527 NM\n\n20 ft\n12.9 ft\n5 ft\n480 lbs\n165 lbs\n17 gal\n13,000+ ft\n\nStandard Nose\n\nLarge Nose\n\nCurrent Customers\nSMD Airborne Science Payload \xe2\x80\x93 SRI CubeSat Imaging\nfor Earth Science (CRES)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CIRES payload captures Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/ Interferometric\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data for imaging and high-precision\nground elevation measurements\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CIRES requires a moving platform at sufficient altitude capable of\naccurate repeat pass collections (SIERRA-B)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The program will demonstrate and validate the instrument for future onorbit CubeSat operations and provide a useful scientific research platform\nin its own right, a capability valued in the Decadal Survey\n\nGSFC Search and Rescue Direction Finding Receiver\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and ARC have partnered to\nconduct a technology demonstration mission for Search\xe2\x80\x90and\xe2\x80\x90Rescue\napplications\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The GSFC Search-and-Rescue Direction Finding Receiver payload will be\nintegrated with the SIERRA\xe2\x80\x90B UAS platform\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flights will characterize the performance of the receiver to meet the\nDirection Finding (DF) and homing operational requirements for\nCOSPAS/SARSAT Second-Generation 406-Mhz Beacons\n\nASI \xe2\x80\x93 Building Copies of SIERRA-B for Education\nAnd Commercial Use\nForward Fuselage\n\nWorking with SIERRA-B\nFind the full SIERRA-B Experimenter\xe2\x80\x99s Handbook and team contact info:\nhttps://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/sierra - ARC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 American Space Industries Inc (ASI) has entered into a Reimbursable\nSpace Act Agreement (RSAA) with NASA Ames\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This Agreement will enable NASA ARC experts to provide ASI with their\nunique engineering expertise on the SIERRA-B UAS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ASI will use this information and assistance to build multiple copies of the\nSIERRA-B UAS for educational and commercial purposes\n\n'
