Radar is preferred for targets off the flight path, and microwave radiometry for targets along the flight path. Radar methods are classified by ability to resolve targets. Techniques which do not require target resolution are preferred. Among these techniques, polarization methods appear most promising, specifically those which differentiate the expected relatively greater depolarization by icebergs from that by ships or which detect doubly-reversed circular polarization.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800007278, "id": "f68898d93370426f9cff2ee7adc79d09", "publicationDate": "1979-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800007278.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800007278/downloads/19800007278.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800007278/downloads/19800007278.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800007278/downloads/19800007278.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
