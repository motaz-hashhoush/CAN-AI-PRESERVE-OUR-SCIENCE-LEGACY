RFI, in this case, is primarily the result of numerous earth based radiating sources within or adjacent to the NASA f- equeney allocations.\n2. multipath is a problem in that the unstabilized spacecraft use omnidirectional receiving antennas at VHF. Thus they receive both a direct and\nindirect signal from the synchronous relay. The multipath effect is of\ncourse also evident in the communication link from the near earth orbiting user spacecraft to the synchronous relay.\nThus an experiment for measurement of the RFI and the multipath effects in\nthe frequency bands of 136-138 MHz and 148-154 MHz is proposed.

The purpose of the experiment is to obtain as much\nmeasured RFI and multipath data as possible in order to permit the optimum\ndesign of a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRS). The TDRS\n(Figure 1) is conceived as a repeater satellite capable of relaying telemetry\nand ranging signals from one or more near earth orbiting user satellites to an\nearth station while at the same time relaying command and ranging signals from\nthe earth station to the user satellite(s). This TDRS system is envisioned as\nan augmentation to the present ground networks and eventual replacement of a\nsubstantial number of tracking and telemetry sites.\nShown in Figure 2 is a synchronous TDRS and a low orbiting user. Also\nshown are the direct paths between the user and the synchronous satellite, the\nmultipath created by the user, and the potential interference sources which\nreside on the earth and interfere with the TDRS and the user spacecraft.\nA preliminary investigation has uncovered many potential RFI sources in\nthe continental United States alone. Clearly it is nct possible to pinpoint all\nsources of RFI using frequency assignment data alone. The only practical\nmethod of determining the RFI environment is to perform a series of measurements of the received power and spectral content in the bands of interest. Once\nthese measurements have been interpreted in light of a particular proposed\nsystem, one can make intelligent decisions toward circumventing these effects.\nThe proposed experiment will determine the available channels for most reliable\ntransmission of information both in the 136-154 MHz TDRS to user frequency\nband, and whenever circumstances allow, multipath information.\nExperimental data will be collected at 136-138 MHz and 148-154 MHz by a\nnear earth orbiting satellite. This only requires a single VHF receiving antenna\nand a single tunable receiver swept for RFI measurements in frequency over any\nselected 2 MHz band with the output translated to an intermediate frequency and\ndetected. The output will be recorded when out of ground site view and played\nback when in radio sight of a STADAN site. The recorder output will be transmitted to the ground site in the S-band. The monitoring receiver will be operated\non a non-interfering basis with the command receiver such that the spacecraft\n1\n\nMAKaMGTWM\nM(MaM A TAAMCTOIW ANALV9d OIWMON\n00^*I N RI OATI\nn,\nAta\n^. w wr\xc2\xab\t\n\nFigure 1\xe2\x80\x94VHF Antenna Coverage\n\n^^ 4\n\nt`\n\nJ\nw\nW\n\nN\n\ncm\n\n1\nC4\n0\na\xe2\x96\xba\n\nE\n\n3\n\nmay be commanded in the present assigned frequency bands. Commands will be\ninfrequent and self-interference caused by NASA command transmitters would\npresent only a minor perturbation in the measurement data. Calibration of the\nexperiment receiver will be accomplished using a ground generated signal of\nknown signal strength.\nData reduction costs will be minimuzed by utilizing existing equipments in\nthe RF System Branch of the Advanced Development Division with support fron.\nthe Information Processing Division at GSFC.\nThe effect of multipath upon the signals transmitted from the TDRS to user\nand vice versa is being studied and analyzed. However, necessary experimental\nverifications are still lacking. Under certain conditions multipath effects can\nalso be observed by way of this experiment.\nThere are a number of reasons why multipath measurements between a\nsy...;hronous and non-synchronous satellite would L beneficial. To date there\nhave been no such measurements made, only theory -xists which does indicate\nthat multipath, under certain reflection conditions, can be quite significant\nwhen a low orbiting user spacecraft is equipped with omni-directional antennas\nand is attempting to receive information from the TDRS. The multipath is also\nexpected to affect the user to TDRS link. Therefore, one of the reasons for\nmeasuring multipath between a low orbiting user and the TDRS, or an equivalc.w\nsynchronous satellite would be to establish the validity of the theory and to allow\nthe theoreticians to refine their treatment in light of hard experimental data.\nIn addition to the support of theory, these multipath measurements would collect\nrealistic experimental data which could be used with less expensive electronic\nsimulators to exercise various modulation and coding techniques designed to\ncombat the effects of multipath. Knowing the statistical nature of the multipath,\nadvanced systems concepts could be tried using valid simulations prior to actual\nlaunch. Furthermore, a better understanding of multipath would allow signal\ndesigners to arrive at more optimum designs for operations in this time varying\nchannel\n2.0 DATA RELAY CONCEPT\nIn the space program the fact that small earth orbiting spacecraft are\nunstabilized precludes the use of directional antennas for data transmission.\nThe presently assigned VHF (136-138 MHz) band is particularly attractive for\nthis class of spacecraft utilizing low gain or ro ralled `omnidirectional" antennas. TDRS optimization studies have indicated that an earth coverage\nantenna (i. e., 26\xc2\xb0 solia angle) on the TDRS for multiple low data rate (10 Ib/s\nor less) user will result in no appreciable degradation in the user data signal\n\n4\n\nto thermal noise ratio. These studies are predicated on the simultaneous relaying\nof data to as many as forty low data rate earth orbiting users. The use of an\nearth coverage receiving ante ina on the TDRS has led to two major problemsnamely, RFI and multipath.\n2.1 RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE\nAt frNaeacies above about 30 MHz earth based receivers are shielded from\nmost earth based RFI sources_ by terrain and antenna directivity. On the other -- hand, the TDRS continuously views approximately an entire earth hemisphere.\nEarth sources radiating pov ers several orders of magnitude greater than the\nsmall, low bit rate user would often fall directly in the TDRS antenna beam. A\npreliminary analysis of the known earth based RFI sources has indicated that\nthe mean square value of these sources at the TDRS receiver will be -92 dbm\nwith peaks as great as -80 dbm. l Assuming a receiving system 2 MHz wide\nwith a 1000\xc2\xb0K system noise temperature and a 16 db antem.a gain, the anticipated\nnoise level will be -105 dbm while a one watt user will. have an effective signal\nof -123 dbm at the receiver input. Under these circumstances the TDRS receiver\nsystem will be interference -limited rather than noise limited. Consequently,\nthe data relay system must be carefully channelized and some specialized\nsignal processing must be incorporated if the user-TDRS-eartb data link is not\nto be seriously degraded. The interference problem clearly impacts TDRS\nreceiver design which necessarily requires statistical data on anticipated inter-\t\nference flux levels. This experiment is designed to obtain such statistical data\nat a minimum cost.\nA second, though perhaps more severe, RFI incident is associated with the\nTDRS to user link, where the user once again has an "omnidirectional" antenna.\nHere the problem results from relatively low TDRS command effective radiated\npower (erp) relative to earth based emitters in the same frequency band. Also,\nbecause of the geometry, earth based emissions reach the user with approximately\n20 db less propagation loss. Here once again an investigation has been made of\nthe known emitters within continental U. S. (Table I). Several instances of\ncommand blockage and false commands have been reported by the 080 2 and\nOAO programs. This experiment can provide the necessary data to select a\nproper command frequency and coding scheme which will minimize such RFI\nproblems.\n1 \'RFI Characteristics of a Data Relay Satellite System, * J.

The direct oath may be considered to be a non -fading signal path.\nVariations in signal strength along the direct path will depend primarily on\nvariations in distance between the user and the data relay satellite system and\nimperfections in the user omnidirectional antenna pattern.\nThe indirect or multipath signal channel may be described in terms of a\nmultiplicity of parameters. These parameters will be discussed in the following\nparagraphs.\n\nThe signal reflected off the earth is characterized by a time varying process\nwhich is statistically noustationary because of the changing velocities and geometry between a user and the TDRS. The short -term statistics -of this link can be\nconsidered stationary. If a CW signal is transmitted from a user craft this\nsignal will be reflected off the earth and will appear at the TDRS. The reflected\nsignal can consist of a spec ulcer component and a diffuse component. The degree\nof specularity and diffuseness associated with the reflected signal will in turn\ndepend upon a multiplicity of parameters, e. g., the grazing angle, the roughness\nof the earth near the point of reflection, and the collation length across the\nsurface of the earth. Roughness factor (a) is a measure of the rms \'bump"\n-\n\nheight variations along the surface of the earth and the correlation length (Lj is\na measure ol the degree of correlation between two points along the surface of\nthe earth. In general the amount of reflected specular power can be expressed\nby the following equation.\n\n2\t\n\nPspecuinr - <ps >\n\nD2\n\nz Pd\n\nRo\n\n2\n(psD = exp - 4 wa sinw)\nPd is the direct power\n\nX is the wavelength\na = rms height of the reflecting surface\nD is the average divergence factor associated with the spherical earth,\nRo 12 is the mean squared reflection coefficient and\n4 is the grazing angle ( angle between the incident electromagnetic beam\nand the reflecting surface).\n\n7\n\n^"\'\n\nThe amount of diffuse power can be expressed by the equation derived by\nDuranni and Sarras 3 and has the following form.\nPaiffuse - D2 IR 1 2 F (`r\' h) Pd\nO\n\nh is the user height above the earth\nF (O, h) < 1\n\nThe divergence factor is shown in Figure 3 as a function of the grazing angle\nfor a 160 kilometer, 650 kilometer, and a 1600 kilometer orbit. For reasonable\nroughness factors and correlation lengths, the primary source of reflected power\nwill be diffuse for grazing angles in excess of 20\xc2\xb0. This angle will be exceeded\nduring most of a single TDRS/user contact period.\n\nD\n1.0\n\n160 Km\n650 Km\n\nQ8\n\n1600 Km\n\nQ6\n\nQ4\n\nFREQUENCY= 135 MHz\n\nQ2\n\n00\n\n10\t\n\n20\t\n\n30 40 50 60\nT\n\n70 80 90\n\nFigure 3\xe2\x80\x94Divergence Factor\n3RCA Review \xe2\x80\x94March 1968 pp. 77-105\n\n8\n\n%*- 1W\t\n\n-\t\n\n_01\n\t\n\n-\n\nThe composite multipath or indirect signal power will normally be equal to\nor less than the direct path signal when reflection coefficients of the earth are\nessentially unity and the grazing angles are in excess of 200.\nIf it were possible to separate the direct and the indirect signal paths at a\nTDRS when a CW signal is transmitted from a user, it would be observed that\nthe envelope statistics associated with the indirect or reflected path would be\nRician. This is true since the specular and diffuse components associated with\nthe reflected path constitute a fading signal consisting of a CW component and\na diffuse component, thus the probability density governing the envelope is\nRician and is given by the following equation.\n\nP (a indirect )\n\na\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nP\tdiffuse\t\n\neXp \xe2\x80\x94\n\na\n\n\t\n\n(a2 + 2%pecular\t\n2$\tdiffuse\t\n\nIO\t\n\n2%pecular\n\nSdiffuse\n\nwhere\np (a\n\nis the probability density of (a)\na is the indirect signal amplitude\nSdif fuse is the diffuse component of the indirect signal\nSspecular is the specular component of the indirect signal\nS indirect \xe2\x80\x94 $diffuse + Sspecular and\nIo is the zero-order Bessel function of imaginary argument.\nindirect )\n\nAs the grazing angle increases beyond 20 0 theory states that the specular\ncomponent diminishes rapidly and that the probability density associated with\nthe envelope of the received signal from the indirect path is essentially Rayleigh.4\nIndirect path is also characterized by a differential Doppler relative to the\ndirect path Doppler.s\nIn addition to differential Doppler the indirect signal, when reflected from\nthe earth\'s surface, will fade. The fading bandwidth, B r , is a function of the\nvelocity of the user spacecraft relative to the earth, the ratio a/L, and the grazing\nangle. This relationship is given in the following equation\n\n4 This result has been observed experimentally by K. L. Jordan, \'Measurement of Multipath\nEffects in a Satellite Aircraft UHF Link"\xe2\x80\x94 Proc IEEE June 67.\n5Golden, Tom "Range and Velocity Component_ of TDRS Multipath Signals," GSFC X-520-69-38,\nFeb., 1969.\n\n9\n\nB F _ ^Vf.\'2Lsin\n\nv is the velocity of the user spacecraft\nL is the correlation length as defined on page 7.\nThe fading bandwidth is maximized when the grazing angle is 90\xc2\xb0 or the user\nis directly below the data relay satellite. At this point the reflected energy is\ncompletely diffuse and the fading bandwidth is maximum. 6\nAnother parameter which is of importance in the evaluation of antimultipath systems is the coherent bandwidth of the user to data relay satellite link.\nThe coherent bandwidth can be defined in a number of ways, but two preferred\nmethods are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.\nTRANSMITTED CARRIERS\nOf\t\n\nRECEIVED CARRIERS\nDIRECT\n\nT\t\n\nT\n\ni\n\n\t\n\nA\nl\n\nFADING\nI f -" ,, \xe2\x80\x94 BANDWIDTH\n\njRECEIVED CARRIERS (REFLECTED)\nWHEN THE COMPLEX ENVELOPE CORRELATION\nFUNCTION BETWEEN THE TWO RECEIVED REFLECTED CARRIERS p (Of) IS EQUAL TO 0.5, THE\nVALUE OF Af IS THE COHERENT BANDWIDTH\n\nFigure 4\xe2\x80\x94Coherent Bandwidth (Frequency Definition)\n\n!Ti Figure 4 we indicate that two transmitted carriers separated in frequency\nby _".F are received at the DRSS from a user craft via the direct and the indirect\npaths. If the normalized correlation coefficient between the two received carriers arriving via the reflected path is computed then the value of AF which is\nneeded to produce a correlation coefficient of 1/2, is defined as the coherent\nbandwidth B c . This definition is independent of the direct path received signals.\n6 ibid RCA Review\n10\n\nTRANSMITTED PULSE\n\nTIPATH\n\nSPREAD\n\nTS -\'\nSPECULAR-\n\n^- POINT\t\nTIME DELAY Td\n\nTIME\n\nAVERAGE MULTIPATH TIME SPREAD \xc2\xb0 COHERENT BW\n\nFigure 5\xe2\x80\x94Coherent Bandwidth (Time Definition)\n\nDefinition of coherent bandwidths based on the transmission of two CVO\' signals\nseparated in frequency is an accepted definition in the literature and is a measure of the coherent bandwidth of a fading channel.\nIn Figure 5 a pulse is transmitted by a user and after a time will be received\nby the TDRS via the direct path. At some later time (T a ) the indirect path signal\nwill arrive. The pulse received via the indirect path will be spread in time. The\ncoherent bandwidth is now the reciprocal of the time spread of the indirect signal\nas shown in the figure.\n3.0 IMPLEMENTATION\n3.1 RECEIVING ANTENNA\nAs stated earlier the TDRS is envisioned as having an earth coverage receiving antenna (solid angle of 26\xc2\xb0). This corresponds to a gain of approximately\n16 db not including cable losses. It is not feasible to implement such an antenna\non the proposed PAC spacecraft nor is such a gain and beamwidth required for\nthis experiment. The receiving antenna for this experiment will consist of the\npresent four VHF whip antennas. The signals received on this antenna will be\ndiplexed to the PAC command receiver and the experiment receiver. This\nallows reception of commands during the monitoring action of the experiment.\n\n11\n\n3.2\n\nRECEIVER\n\nThe receiver (Figure 6\'I to be used in this : .peri.nent will be swept in four\nselected frequency bands, namely, 136-138 MHz; 148-150 MHz; 150-152 MHz;\n152-154 MHz. The nominal bandwidth will be 2 MHz in the first IF. The system\nnoise temperature, including earth and sky is expected to be 1000\xc2\xb0K.\nThe receiver will bn a multiple conversion sunerretrodyne. Frequency\nband selection will be accomplished using a discrete stepped frequency first\nconverter. One of four crystal local oscillators will be selected in sequence or\nby command for the first converter. The band selected will be recorded on the\ntape et the beginning of each sweep. These local oscillators are selected for a\n30 MHz first IF. This 30 MHz IF will be 2 MHz wide at the 1 db points. A second converter will convert the received signal to 10.0 MHz. This 10 MHz IF\nband pass will be 100 KHz at the 1.0 db points. The sweeping action of the monitering system will be accomplished in this converter, IF stage. The local\noscillator for the second converter will be swept \xc2\xb11.05 MHz. This essentially\nsweeps the 100 KHz filter of the second IF across the 2 MHz received spectrum.\nThe output of the swept filter will be converted to 1.0 MHz and filtered to 3.0 KHz\nbandpass in the third IF. The resulting signal is now the output of a 3.0 KHz filter swept across the 2.0 MHz received spectrum. The output of the third IF will\nbe envelope detected to realize a voltage proportioned to the amplitude of the\nflux density in the 3.0 KHz bandwidth. Th: voltage from the envelope detector\nwill be converted to a logarithmic scale in a lin-log amplifier resulting in a\nvoltage that is the flux density expressed as a logarithm. This voltage is sampled\nat the rate of 35 samples per second. Each sample is digitized in a 5 bit word\nand recorded on the tape recorder at 185 bits/stic.\n3.3 CALIBRATION\nIn order for the autput of the monitoring system to have meaning, the system\nmust be calibrated. This calibration level will be established while the spacecraft is in view of a ground site. This will consist of transmitting a CW 1 carrier\nfrom the ground and recording the level received. The level of transmission\nwill be varied in 10 db steps to record a caLibration curve on the tape. Considering a nominal 600 milk. circular orbit for the PAC, ground based emitters\nhaving a power of 5 milliwatts will result in a signal to thermal noise ratio of\n+6 db in a 1.0 KHz bandwidth. This assumes that the emitter power is constrained\nto a one kilohertz bandwidth. This corresponds to a 5 watt transmitter radiating\na flat spectrum over the kilohertz bandwidth. Since this is the type of RFI source\nthat is expected, the system should respond to such inputs.\n\n12\n\nz n.\n\ncr j\nt\n\n:1j\n\nUw\t\n\ncr\nWW\n\nI J\n\nW\t\n\nW\n\nfill\n\nF- cr\n\n^ t\n\n\'S:: r i\n30o\t\n\nW cr X^I\nu\nii sl\n\n8\n\nN\n\n2\n=WY\nO\n^ JM\n\nW\nH\nJ\nQ\nW\n\nQ U- n\n\nm\n\nw\na\nW\n\nFO\n\nJ\n\nY\n\n0\n\nU\n\nO\n\n-i\n\nco\n\nU\nZ\n\ntY\n\na g\n\nJ Q\n\n00\n\nW\t\nW\n\nE\n0\na\n0\n\nQ\nJ\n\nO\n\na\nN\n\nN\n\nV\nO\n\n_\n=WY\nN cr\n\n_\n\nco\n\nc\nb\n\nJO N\nn\n\nE\n\nLL.\nO\n\nfait\n\nx\nw\n\nO\n\nX\nWy\nCO a\n\nNbt a\n^\n\nWg\n^ t]\nif) LL\n\nZ\n\nO\n\nO\n\nV\n\nawQ\n\nJaw\no cn z\n\nx^r5\n\nO\nW\t\n\nto\na\n\nam^0\nQ\n\nW\n\nOWcr\nSQ\nXZ\nN\n\nW\na\n\nJU G\nN O\nN\n\nO Y W\nO\nJ>\n\n00\n\nU\nO~\n<-J\n\n2\nNO\nU\n\np5\n\n13\n\nI\n10\n0\n\nLL\n\n3.4 RECORDING\nThe input to track #1 of the on-board tape recorder is the output of the\nVCO in the flux level detector. This VCO has a nominal frequency of 1.0 KHz.\nThe second track will record the time of the sweep start to the nearest quarter\nminute for geographical reference. The timing system will encode the time from\nthe last tape dump for up to two orbits. Tape dump to a STADAN site will be at\na 30 to 1 speed up allowing entire tape dump in approximately three minutes.\nThe signal from the receiver output will consist of a unipolar voltage varying as\nthe logarithr.. of the input signal level. This voltage will drive the VCO over a\n+4.5\n+150\nhertz. This gives a playback range of 30 -0 KHz to modurange c,_ 1000\nlate the downlink system.\t\nDuring the receiver flyback and recycle time the input to the VCO will be\ngrounded. This will calibrate the zero noise, zero signal frequency of the VCO.\n3.5 REAL TIME MODE\nDuring that portion of the orbit when the PAC is within range of a STADAN\nsite, real time monitoring of the RFI environment will be available. The output\nof the lin-log amplifier will be commanded to a 30 KHz VCO. This VCO will\nthen serve as the input for the appropriate modulator in the downlink system.\nAt the same time the sweep applied to the second local oscillator (sweep source)\nwill increase in speed by a factor of 60. This will then sweep the 2 MHz band\nin one second and relay the spectrum with three kilohertz resolution to ground.\nThe first local oscillator stepping will be synchronized to this new sweep speed.\nThe same processes are now followed but at the increased rate. This is a commanded "ON" function. If a command to continue real time operation is not\nreceived the system will revert to the once per minute mode in five minutes.\n3.6 TRANSMITTER\nThe transmitter for linking the above obtained information to the ground\nwill operate in the S-band frequency band. This will be a 2.0 watt solid state\ntransmitter. The tape output will provide a 30 KHz subcarrier and this subcarrier phase modulate the carrier while spacecraft housekeeping data is being\nmodulated on a 10 KHz subcarrier and multiplexed with the RFI data for linkage\nto the ground. Radio Frequency Link parameters are summarized in the\nAppendix.\n\n14\n\n3.7 GROUND LINK ANTENNA\nThe S-band antenna for data transmission to the ground will consist of four\nlinearly polarized yagi arrays mounted 90 0 apart around the circumference and\nabout 10 inches above th:, bottom of the main body of the PAC. These antennas\nwill be folded flat against the side of the PAC and deploy out to an angle of approximately 30\xc2\xb0 after the shroud is ejected. The gain of this four yagi array will\nbe approximately 10 db.\nThe antenna will be fed by a hybrid and appropriate phasing network. The\nindividual yagis will be phased such that the polarizatic.n would appear to be\ncircular in the far field along the vehicle axis. This antenna will be used only\nafter the spacecraft orbit has been determined, the condition of the spacecraft\nverified, and the normal 136.32 transmitter ha been turned off.\n\n4.0 EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURATION\n4.1 RFI MEASUREMENT MODE\nThe relative simplicity of this experiment, the reasonable cost when compared with the wealth of data to be collected, and the importance of the data to\nbe collected and analyzed to the TDRS program make this experiment both very\ndesirable and feasible. The experiment will monitor the 136-138 MHz and the\n148-154 MHz bands to determine relative flux densities from nearly all points\nof the earth. Earth generated signals in these frequency bands will be converted\nto 1.0 MHz in a multiple conversion super heterodyne receiver, amplified and\ndetected in narrow band detector. The first local oscillator (LO) will be stepped\nin discrete steps to allow the selection of a desired 2. MHz band. A sweeping\naction on the second LO allows the entire 2 MHz band to be strobed in a 100\nKHz band within one minute. This action will essentially sweep a 100 KHz band\nacross the 2 MHz selected. This signal will be down converted, filtered to a\nbandwidth of 3.0 KHz and detected. The resultant is a scan of the MHz band\nwith a 3.0 KHz resolution. Upon completion of a sweep the first local oscillator\nwill be stepped to a new frequency so that the sweeping action may cause to be\nrecorded the flux level received within the second 2 MHz band. This process\nwill be continued until the flux levels in the following bands have been recorded,\n136-138; 148-150; 150-152; 152-154 MHz. The first LO will then return to the\nfirst step and the sweep cycle repeated.\n\n4.2 MULTIPATH RELAY MODE\nThis experiment will also be used to provide a means of measuring the\nTDRS multipath parameters. Of particular interest are (1) path length time\n15\n\ntl^v-,\n\t\n\nHS#^\n\ndifference, (2) time spread of the path length time difference, (3) amplitude of\nthe multipath returns, and (4) the frequency spread of the multipath return.\nConsidering the importance of true measurements of these parameters to the\nTDRS multipath modulation problem, the following program is included.\nReferring to Figure 7 "Possible Configurations for Multipath Measurements,"\nconsiderations of available RF sources for the PAC and for the stationary satellite (ATS-3) as well as considerations of antennas dictate the choice of mode (a).\nMode b would require the ATS to relay the direct plus indirect signals received\nfrom the spacecraft. Of the two optional. ways of returning the spacecraft data\nto ground, the spacecraft-to-earth (mode a) direct path is preferable. With this\nconfiguration, 135.6 MHz can be transmitted from ATS-3 directly under ground\ncontrol by strapping the VHF transmitter modulation input to the receiver output. This modulation car, easily be varied from the ATS ground transmitter. Reception of the VHF by the experiment receiver will consist of direct and multipath energy. The receiver will be commanded to a fixed-frequency (non-swept)\nmode. Either the wideband (2 MHz at 30 MHz) or narrowband (0.1 MHz at 1.0 MHz)\nwill be relayed to the earth station in real time via the S-band link. The wideband relay is simpler but the narrowband permits the best dynamic range for\nobserving the multipath returns. Which bandwidth is used will be determined\nduring the experiment real time ope%-ations.\nOn the ground the S-band signal from the spacecraft will be received and\nprocessed as follows. Amplitude information w:L -. be obtained by envelope detection and doppler and doppler spread information will be obtained by (simultaneous) FM reception of the relayed VHF signals. The expected received\nsignals are depicted in Figure S.\nFrom the data obtained as above the multipath returns can be characterized\nin sufficiently many ways to satisfy any foreseeable requirements. Reduction\nof the data will yield dependence of multipath spread and doppler parameters\nas a function of the differential path length for a typical altitude and for a wide\nvariety of surface conditions. Estimates of the statistical spread of the data can\nalso be derived as well as estimates of the day-to-day stability of the parameters.\nThe plan outlined ebove will provide results that are directly usable in\ndetermining the effect3 of multipath interference for pulse modulations of all\ntypes. No intermediate mathematical operations are required, although it is\npossible to (1) determine the medium\'s impulse response, (2) the medium\'s\nfrequency response, and (3) evaluate models of the medium.\nAnother approach to the measurement rf various parameters associpted\nwith the user/TDRS link is based upon the transmission of one or more CW\n16\n\nI!

Under this approach, to measure direct signal strength and indirect\nsignal strength a CW tone would be transmitted and a phase-lock loop would be\nused to track the direct signal component. Phase-lock loop bandwidth is assumed\nto be narrow enough to remain in lock. Signal strength should be, in most\ninstances, greater than the indirect signal path and, because of the fading nature\nof the indirect signal path, the indirect signal should be dispersed in frequency\nthus contributing only a small amount of interference in the bandwidth of the\ndirect carrier phase-iock loop. Since the fading bandwidth is a maximum and\nthe differential doppler zero when the spac^wraft is directly underneath the\nTDRS, under these conditions the phase-lock loop bandwidth would discriminate\nagainst the indirect signal since the indirect signal would probably be diffuse\nand have a maximum fading bandwidth. Under other circumstances such as\nlow grazing angles the divergence factor assists in diminishing the reflected\nsignal strength. Coupled with the differential doppler, these two factors assist\nin maintaining ohe phase-lock loop tracidng capabilities on the direct signal.\nUnder these circumstances the fading bandwidth can be measured at the ground\nstation with a frequency analyzer using the direct signal as a frequency calibration. Furthermore, differential doppler could be readily measured at the\nground station using the same frequency analysis techniques.\n\n18\n\nIn order to measure coherent bandwidth two CW carriers spaced in frequency\nby GF (which will be varied continuously or stepped in frequency separation) will\nbe transmitted vi p ATS and observed through this experiment at the ground station. Coherent bandwidth is defined by the separation in frequency between two\ncarriers required to produce independent fading of these carriers. Thus phaselock loop receivers could be used to form a two-channel tracking fiiter followed\nby a correlation coefficient computer to arrive at the coherent bandwidth at the\nground station. Shown in Figure 9 is the implementation required to measure\nthese various statistical parameters.\n\nPLL *i\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\nNARROW\nDIRECT SIGNAL STRENGTH\nWIDE\nLPF\n\nINDIRECT SIGNAL POWER\n1AND FADING E14WOWIDTH\n\nAVERAGE\n\nI PLL *2 1\n\nFLPF\nLPF\nFigure 9\xe2\x80\x94Correlation System\n\n5.0 WEIGHT AND P01V ER ESTIMATES\nThe required weight and power estimates are listed in Table H.

These samples will be converted to 5 bit per word serial bit stream\nnetting 175 bits of data. The first ten bits stored will consist of the time from\nlast tape dump. The next 5 bits will indicate the band being searched, and the\nnext 175 bits will be the 35 samples as previously described. This sequence of\n190 bits/sec will be stored for each 2.0 MHz sweep.\nUpon command from a ground station, the tape will be dumped at a 30 to 1\nspeed up ratio. This dump will generate a bit stream of approximately 6 kilobits per second for transmission to the ground via the S-band link.\n\n7.0 COMMAND REQUIREMENTS\nThis experiment requires a minimal of commands. The command required\nto turn off the 136.32 MHz transmitter (Command No. 48) can be used to simultaneously energize the experiment. The command to turn on the 136.32 MHz\ntransmitter (Command No. 49) can be used to simultaneously de-energize the\nexperiment. The required command to send the housekeeping and other data\nvia the S-band transmitter instead of the VHF transmitter could also be the\nsame command numbers.\nThe commands required to start the tape dump and/or tune the receiv6r to\nthe fixed frequency mode, required for multipath measurement, should be\navailable from the list of unused commands.\n\n8.0 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the following persons\nin defining this experiment: Dr. Niel Birch, Magnavox Corp.; Dr. N.
