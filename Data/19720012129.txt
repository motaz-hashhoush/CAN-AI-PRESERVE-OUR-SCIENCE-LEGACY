Dunn\nCornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.\nBuffalo, New York\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis document is the final report for Contract NAS 1-9627 which\nwas initiated in November 1969. Several areas\nof experimental research\nwere pursued as part of this study. All of the experiments were conducted\nin the expanding-flow environment of a reflected-shock tunnel. The first\na r e a of interest was the measurement of the reaction rate coefficient f o r\nthe reactions Ct t e\' t e\' --cC t e\' and C o t + e\'C\n0 . The results\nof these experiments are applicable over an electron temperature range of\napproximately 1500 to 7000\'K which is consistent with that currently expected in the stagnation region during entry\nof a vehicle into the atmospheres of Mars or Venus.\n\n+\n\nThe second a r e a of research was concerned with the operation,\nunder controlled laboratory conditions, of the wedge-shaped electrostatic\nprobes that were used onboard the R A M flight vehicles. The probes used in\nthese studies were the RAM C-1 constant bias-voltage probe and the RAM\nC-C voltage-swept thin-wire probes. These probes were used in inviscid\nand boundary-layer flows for conditions such that independent measurements of the electron density (and electron temperature in the case of the\nR A M C-C probe) could be obtained using microwave interferometers and/or\nvoltage- swept thin-wire probes\n\n.\n\nThe third area of interest was concerned with the measurement of\nelectron-density distributions and antenna-admittance properties in ionized\nboundary layers over a flat plate. Measurements were performed with two\nS-band and one X-band antennas using four-probe reflectometers. Thinwire Langmuir probes operating in the free-molecular flow regime were\nused to measure the electron-density distribution in the boundary layer over\nthe antennas and microwave interferometers were used to measure the electron density of the free stream at 1 inch and 11 inches upstream of the plate\nleading edge.\nIn the remainder of this report, the results obtained in each of the\na r e a s noted above will be discussed separately. The results\nof the reaction rate coefficient studies are described in Section 2 . In Section 3 the\nelectrostatic-probe measurements performed with the RAM C and RAM\nC-C probes are discussed. The technical discussion is concluded in\nSection 4 with a description of the antenna admittance measurements obtained in the presence of ionized boundary layers.\n\nThe author would like to thank Mr. Richard Blum of CAL for constructing and operating the microwave reflectometers during the course of\nthe antenna admittance measurements.\n2.\n\nMEASUREMENT OF c+t e - t e - THREE-BODY RECOMBINATION\nAND C o t t e\' DISSOCIATIVE RECOMBINATION IN EXPANDING\nCARBON MONOXIDE FLOWS\n\nThe next step in space exploration beyond the moon project is most\nlikely the exploration of the planets Mars and Venus.\nOne of the basic objectives of the first missions will probably be the determination of the composition of the atmosphere, not only near the surface, but throughout the\nentry trajectory. The success of these missions is partially dependent upon the ability to calculate the gas composition in the plasma surrounding the\nentry body. A t the present time, reaction rate coefficients for several\nof\nthe reactions of possible importance in the C - 0 - N s y s t e m a r e not well\nknown. This lack of data motivated the studies described here.\nAt the\npresent time attention is confined to reactions involving ions and/or electrons because of the potential communication blackout problem.\nPrevious measurements reported1 - 3 * from this laboratory have\npresented rat? coefficient data for the dissociative recombination of NO+,\nN z t , and 0 2 which a r e a l s o of importanceintheC-0-Nsystem.The\npurpose of t h i s r e p o r t i s to present rate-coefficient data, obtained in the\nsame manner, for the electron depletion reactions\n\nc + + e+ e - k , r ~e +\nand\n\nKnowledge of the electron temperature is essential for determining kr for\nboth of these reactions. The electron temperature was therefore measured\nand used in the data correlation.\nMany autho r s4-15 have published theoretical predictions of the rate\ncoefficient for the class of reactions given by Mt t e\' t eM\n\'\nt e\' where\nM is an atomic ion. The result\nof Makin and Keck4 is used here for comparison purposes because of its simplicity and good agreement with available experimental data. The authors use\na classical phase-space concept\nin which a point in phase space is used to represent,the impact point of the\nthree colliding particles and a distribution of these points is assumed to\ncorrespond to a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium. The authors propose\na\n"trial" surface which separates the free and bound states of the electron-\n\n*\n2\n\nSuperscripts refer to references given at end of text.\n\nion pair at a selected energy which is l e s s than the dissociation limit. By\nminimizing the rate at which representative points cross the "trial" surface,\na least upper bound to the recombination rate can be calculated.\nBates, Kingston and McWhirter,\' in\n1962, studied collisionalradiative recombination between electrons and atomic ions in dense plasmas.\nThe authors propose a statistical theory which permits the calculation\nof\nthe rate coefficient i f one knows the relevant spontaneous transition probabilities. The theory has been applied to the calculation\nof the reaction rate\ncoefficients for a hydrogen-ion plasma. Application to other ions\nwould\nprobably be difficult to justify in light of uncertainties associated with current transition probability information.\nRecently, D\'Angelo6 suggested that the classical three-body recombination theory of Thomson7 can be successfully applied to the calculation\nof electron-electron-ion collisional-radiative recombination. His results\na r e i n good agreement with the results o both Bates, Kingston and\nMcWhirter5 and Hinnov and Hirschberg.\n\n6\n\n8\nHinnov and Hirschberg present a theoretical treatment of the calculation of the electron-electron-ion collisional-radiative rate coefficient\nand, in the same paper, substantiate the theory with experimental data\nwhich they have obtained for the three-body recombination\nofHe\'\nand Ht\nTheir theoretical approach involves recombination into the higher energy\nstates, n 7 5 , and thus some knowledge of collisional transition probabilities is required. However, by application of a number of simplifying\nassumptions, they are able to approximate the rate coefficient without a\ndetailed knowledge of the collisional transition robabilities\nIn addition,\nthe experimental results of Motley and Kuckes, for the recombination of\nH e t , a r e c o m p a r e d by Hinnov and Hirschberg to their own theory and data\nover the temperature range 1300\xc2\xb0Kto3000\xc2\xb0K.\nTheir theoretical results\na r e a l s o i n good agreement with the previously discussed works of Refs. 4\nand 5. The experimentally determined rate coefficients were deduced\non\nthe basis of microwave (electron-density decay) and spectrum line-intensity\n(electron temperature) measurements obtained in the afterglow magnetof\nically confined plasmas of helium and hydrogen.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5\n\n-\n\nThe only measurement for the three-body recombination relevant to\nthe C - 0 - N system is that obtained by Park16 at an electron temperature\nof 10,000"K for the reaction\nNt t e - t e\'\nN t e\'\nHis experiments\nwere performed in the expanding-flow region of an electric-arc plasma\nwind tunnel. He used the hydrogen-beta line-broadening technique to determine the electron density. The electronJemperaturg\nw a s obtained from the\nratio of spectral lines of nitrogen, 5617 A and 4935 A . P a r k 1 7 a l s o d i s cusses a theoretical technique for calculating the recombination rate coefficients for the deionization of atomic ions. He compares the results of\nhis calculations for Nt to those of Hinnov and Hirschberg (Het) and\nillustrates good agreement.\n\n.\n\n3\n\n.\n\n-\n\nt\nExperimental data for the reaction\nCO t e\nC t 0 have been\nreported by Mentzoni and D nohoe f o r e l e c t r o n t e m p e r a t u r e sof approximately 273"K18 and 775\xc2\xb0K.P9 The authors used microwave diagnostics to\nstudy the electron decay in the afterglow following a pulsed d. c. discharge\nin carbon monoxide.\n\nIn the present experiments, both the electron temperature and number density were measured. This electron temperature was used in computing the variation of number density along the nozzle. The recombination\nrate coefficient was then adjusted until the calculated number density agreed\nwith the microwave-interferometer data.\n2.1 Experimental Apparatus and Technique\nA pressure-driven shock tube was used to produce a r e s e r v o i r of\nhigh-temperature carbon monoxide which was subsequently expanded in a\nconical nozzle as shown in Fig. 1. The test gas used in these experiments\nwas supplied by Lif-0-Gena Inc. A chemical analysis of the gas indicated\nthe following: 25 2 5 ppm of nitrogen, argon less than 2 ppm, carbon dioxide\nl e s s than 10 ppm, helium less than 4 ppm, hydrogen less than 4 ppm, methane l e s s than 2 ppm, oxygen less than 2 ppm, and water less than 1 ppm.\nThe electron number densities were measured at 11.5,\n21 -5 31.5\nand 41.5 inches from the nozzle throat using microwave interferometers\noperating at frequencies of either 35 o r 17 GHz. One inch downstream of\neach microwave-interferometer measuring station, thin-wire Langmuir\nprobes were used on the nozzle centerline to measure the electron temperat u r e and electron density. The microwave interferometers\nand the experimental procedure are discussed in more detail in Ref. 1.\nThe probes used in these experiments were constructed by surrounding 0.004-inch-diameter tungsten wires with a quartz envelope, leaving a\nnominal 0.400-inch length of bare wire exposed. Immediately prior to each\nrun, the tungsten oxide is removed by placing the probe in a dilute solution\nof sodium hydroxide and passing approximately 400 p amps of c u r r e n t\n.\nthrough the circuit for approximately 10 minutes.\n2.2\n\nMethod of Determining Rate Coefficient\n\nTwo reflected-shock reservoir conditions were used to obtain the\nreaction rate coefficients for the deionization reactions given\nby Eqs. (1)\nand ( 2 ) . At the f i r s t condition the test gas was expanded from an equilibrium condition of 7060\xc2\xb0K and 17.3 atm pressure and the dominant chemical\nreaction taking place in the expansion was C+\nt e - t e\'-C\nt eA l l of\nthe other reactions given in Table 1 were included in the nonequilibrium\nnozzle-flow calculations performed for this reservoir condition, but p e r t u r bation of their rate coefficients did not have a significant influence on the\npredicted electron-density distribution. A t the second condition, 6260OK and\n10.0 a t m p r e s s u r e a the reactions involving neutral species only were still\n\n.\n\n4\n\nunimportant, but several reactions involving charged species were important. By accepting a set of rate coefficients for the charge-transfer reactions it was possible to deduce the rate coefficient f o r the dissociative\nC t 0\nIn the remainder of the paper,\nrecombination reaction Cot t e\'\nthe method of data analysis is described and experimental results are presented f o r each of the previously mentioned conditions\n\n-\n\n2.3 Procedure\n\nf o r Calculating Electron-Density Distribution\nand Chemical Model Utilized\n\nThe nonequilibrium nozzle-flow calculations noted above were performed with the nozzle-flow computer program described in Ref.\n20. This\nprogram computes the solution for the gasdynamic properties\nand chemical\ncomposition in the expansion of a n a r b i t r a r y gas mixture from an equilibrium reservoir state through a given nozzle geometry. The vibrational and\nelectronic degrees of freedom of the species are assumed to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium but the chemical reactions are allowed to proceed at\nfinite rates. A more detailed description of the modifications made to the\nstandard version of this program in order to perform the calculations discussed here is given in Ref. 2. In this study the following species were\n0\nCO+\n0 2 + , C+\nO+ and e\'\nincluded: CO , 0 2 , C 0 2 , C\nThe chemical-kinetics model used in the earlier calculations was significantly larger than the one shown in Table 1 , which w a s obtained by eliminating from the initial model the unimportant reactions\n\n.\n\nReaction rate coefficients f o r reactions 1-6 were estimated to be represented by the expressions given in Table 1.\nF o r the expanding flow situation of interest here, more accurate knowledge of these rate coefficients is\nnot necessary because the neutral species concentrations in the expansion\nwere essentially frozen at the nozzle throat (near equilibrium) values\nand\nthus the neutral reactions had little influence on the ion concentrations in the\nexpansion. Much more important f o r these studies was the rate coefficients\nf o r the ion-molecule and ion-atom reactions 7-10. Throughout the expansion\nthese reactions were all proceeding in the direction opposite to that written\nin Table 1. The only available experimental data for these reactions were\nthose obtained by Fehsenfeld, Schmeltekopf and Ferguson21 at 300\xc2\xb0K f o r the\nreaction C 0 2 t C t " c O\nt C o t . To the author\'s knowledge, rate coefficients have not been measured \xe2\x82\xacor the remaining three reactions. These\nrates were therefore estimated at 300\xc2\xb0K and extrapolated to higher temperato reactures as described by the equations given in Table 1. Compared\ntions 7-10, reaction 11 was considerably less important.\nthe nozzle-flow calculations performed in this study, the\nIn all of:\nprescribed nozzle cross-sectional area was that of the inviscid core. The\nboundary-layer $ifplacement thickness was computed using the method of\nBurke and Bird.\nFor theconditions of these experiments the boundarylayer correction i s small.\n\n5\n\n2.4\n\nLangmuir-Probe and Microwave-Interferometer Measurements\n\nA typical swept-voltage probe characteristic obtained on the nozzle\ncenterline for a reservoiP\'condition of 7060\xc2\xb0K and 17.3 atm is shown in\nFigs. 2(a) and (b). These oscilloscope records were recorded simultaneousl y using two oscilloscopes with the vertical sensitivities adjusted to emphasize the electron-retarding region, from which the electron temperature w a s\ndeduced, and the ion-current region, from which the electron density w a s\nobtained. The voltage applied to the probe\nw a s recorded on the lower channel\nof each oscilloscope. In these experiments the probe voltage was swept from\n-5 to t 2 volts relative to ground potential. Figure 2(c) shows the phase-shift\nof the incident energy and the voltage sweep relative to the test time obtained\nfrom a microwave interferometer located one inch up\'stream of the Langmuir\nprobe. The attenuation\nof the incident microwave energy w a s also recorded\nbut was found to be less than 2 db for this location in the expansion.\nThe electroi density w a s obtained from the Lan muir-probe data\nusing the free-molecular flow theory of Laframboise.\nIn these calculations,\nthe dominant ion was assumed to be\nCt consistent with the calculated species concentrations presented in F i g s . 3(a) and b) for the two r e s e r v o i r\nconditions. However, in contrast to previous1results obtained at this laboratory using several different test gases (air, nitrogen, oxygen and argon),\nthe electron densities obtained in these experiments from the Langmuirprobe data were consistently less than the corresponding values obtained\nfrom the microwave interferometers by a factor of 1.4 to 2.0 at the downstream stations.\n\n2g\n\nI\n\nThe cause of this apparent inconsistency between the two diagnostic\ntechniques does not appear to be related to collisional effects which have been\nshown by Talbot and C h ~ to produce such a result. The relative magniu ~ ~\ntudes of the\nmean\nfree\npaths\nX i-p 3 1 m - n 3 X e-n 3 X\n8\nand 1 e-e\nwere calculated using the expressions summarized by Sonin52 and a r e p r e sented in Fig. 4 for one of the experimental conditions. With the exception\nof\nX i-i , which is somewhat smaller at this experimental condition, these\nvalues are not significantly different from those obtained for the previous\nnitrogen work of Dunn and Lordi26 in which the probe and microwaveinterferometer results were found to be in good agreement at the downstream\nstations. Initially it was felt that the smaller value of the ion-ion mean f r e e\npath w a s contributing to ihe disagreement. The second experimental condition was then completed and a quantitatively similar inconsistency between\nthe probe and microwave-interferometer results w a s still present. However,\nfor this experimental condition, all of the mean free paths were comparable\nto those for the previous nitrogen work.\nThe calculated ion-species distributions suggest that the correct ion\nhas be.en used in the probe data reduction and the calculated mean free paths\nsuggest that the probe results should be free of collisional effects. It is\nrealized that if the collected ion were C o t instead of Ct , then the probe\nand interferometer results would be in relatively good agreement. However,\nin order for this to be the case, the mobility of the Cot ion would\n\n6\n\nnecessarily be much l a r g e r ( s e e F i g s . 3(a) and (b) f o r relative concentrations) than that of C+ and in light of existing information this is an unlikely\nresult.\nThe anomaly described above is disturbing because the only check\none has on proper probe operation is by comparison of the electron-density\nresults with an accepted measurement standard, in our case the microwave\ninterferometer. However, because the probe-deduced electron densities\na r e not essential to the rate-coefficient determination, the problem was not\npursued further. The electron temperatures obtained from the probe results\nare, however, used for the rate-coefficient studies. The measured electron\ntemperatures have been accepted as c o r r e c t on the basis of past experiencel-3, 26 with Langmuir-probe operation. Later in the text, the influence\nof the electron temperature on the rate coefficient results will be illustrated.\n2.5\n\nDetermination of Rate Coefficient\n\nIt was previously mentioned that the rate coefficient f o r the deionization of C t by the reaction Ct t e\' t e\' -+ C t e\' and the deionization of\nC o t by the reaction C o t t e"-C\nt 0 have been measured at two separate reservoir conditions.\nIn this section the measurements obtained at each\nof the experimental conditions are discussed separately.\n2.5.1 Ct t e- t e- "c C t e- reaction in expansion from 7060\xc2\xb0K a t\n17 3 atm pressure. - The electron-temperature measurements performed\nat this experimental condition are com.pared in Fig. 5 to the calculated\nheavy-particle translational temperature. Measurements were made at\naxial distances from the nozzle throat of 12.5r 22.5r 32.5 and 42.5 inches\n(A/A\'\' = 70, 230, 470 and 780). The electron temperature appears to decrease slightly with increasing expansion ratios. A t the first t h r e e m e a s u r ing stations, the electron temperatures are seen to scatter approximately\n10% about an average value. A t the last measuring station the scatter is\nsomewhat greater. The dashed line faired through the measurements represents the electron temperature used in the rate-coefficient determination.\nThe electron-density measurements performed in the expansion are\nshown on Fig. 6. The measurements are seen to scatter by approximately\n2 15% about an average value. Much of this scatter can be correlated with\nthe run-to-run variation in the shock-tube incident-shock velocity.\n\nIt w a s previously noted that f o r these experiments the neutralAll of the chargedchemistry reactions were relatively unimportant.\nchemistry reactions given in Table 1 were included in the calculations but\nthe only one of importance waz 3eaction 13.

We do not feel that our results are sufficiently sensitive\nto\ntemperature dependence to m e r i t any change from these predicted temperature variations.\n\n-\n\n7\n\nIn o r d e r to demonstrate the dominance of reaction 13, the rate coefficient for each of the reactions 12, 7 , 9 and 10 was individually decreased\no r increased by a factor of 10 and the nonequilibrium-flow calculation repeated. For none of these rate coefficient perturbations did the predicted\nelectron density change by more than 15oJo. It can therefore be concluded\nthat the rate coefficients for these reactions given in Table 1 can be considerably in error without affecting the rate coefficient obtained from these\nexperiments for the reaction C t t e\' t e\'\nC t e\'\nBy contrast, the influence of the rate coefficient for reaction 13 on the predicted electrondensity distribution is shown on F i g . 6. Line A on this figure represents\nthe predicted result using the theoretical rate coefficient \'of Ref. 4 and is\nseen to slightly overpredict the measured results.

This result was obtained using the same rate coefficients\nas used for line D but the heavy-particle translational temperature was used\ninstead of the electron temperature in the rate coefficient expression. The\neffect of the temperature history is seen to be a reduction in the predicted\nelectron density at A/A* = 1000 of about 1.6.\nA t smaller area ratios, the\nimportance of the temperature history can be seen to be reduced.\n\n-\n\nFigure 7 presents a comparison between the data of this paper and\nprevious reaction rate coefficient data and predictions f o r the class of reactionsgiven by M t t e\' t e-"\nt e\'\nTo the author\'s knowledge, there\na r e no other data for the C t t e\' t e\'-C\nt e- reaction with which the p r e s ent results could be compared. A s can be seen from .Fig. 7 the prediction of\nMakin and Keck,4 which is independent of the ion undergoing recombination,\nappears to be a good approximation to the available experimental data.\n2.5.2 C o t t e-C t 0 reaction in expansion from 6260\xc2\xb0K at\n10 0 atm pressure. - Microwave-interferometer and Langmuir-probe measurements were a l s o performed at the same axial locations as previously described for a reservoir condition of 6260\xc2\xb0K a t 10.0 atm pressure. Theboundary-layer growth f o r this condition was somewhat different than calculated for the previous condition which accounts f o r why the results are plotted\nat different area ratios f o r the same axial location.\n\n-\n\nv\n\nThe measured electron-temperature distribution in the expansion is\npresented in Fig. 8 along with the calculated heavy-particle translational\ntemperature. The electron temperature is shown to decrease slightly in the\nregion from 12.5 to 22.5 inches but to remain relatively uniform beyond\n22.5 inches from the throat. The scatter in these measurements\nis somewhat l a r g e r than previously experienced but consistent with that obtained at\n42.5 inches for the previous experimental condition (see\nF i g . 5 ) . The dashed\nline faired through the data was used in determining the reaction rate\ncoefficient.\n8\n\nThe measured electron densities are presented in F i g . 9 as a function of inviscid area ratio. The scatter in these measurements\nis consistent\nwith that experienced at the previous experimental condition. However, the\nresults obtained at the last station appear to be high by about 15% based upon\nis not\nextrapolation of the three upstream results. The reason for this\nknown but it is possibly due to an inaccuracy in the boundary-layer correction at this downstream location.\nAgain the neutral-species reactions were unimportant in the expansion.\nHowever, for this reservoir condition, reactions\n7 , 8 , 9, 10 and 12 were\ndominant (all proceeding in the opposite direction to that written in Table 1)\nand of approximately equal importance. The three-body reactions\n13 and 14\nwere relatively unimportant even though the dominant ion in the expansion\nw a s C+ ( s e e F i g . 3(b)) The calculations have demonstrated that the reactions controlling the C+ concentration level are the reactions 7-10 and 12.\ne\n\nThe fact that the ion-molecule and ion-atom charge-transfer reactions\nhave a significant influence on the predicted electron-density distributions is\nunfortunate for the purposes of this study in light of the previously noted uncertainty in the associated reaction rate coefficients. At the present time it\nseems reasonable to accept the rate coefficients given in Table 1 for these\nreactions and proceed with the data reduction.\nIt is, however, important to\nrealize that the results may have to be modified i f data for these reactions\nwere to become available.\n\n+\n\neLines A , B, and C on F i g 9 illustrate the influence of the Cot\nrate coefficient on the calculated electron-density distribution, accepting the\nr a t e s given in Table 1 for reactions 7- 11.

For this\nparticular calculation, the rate of reaction 9\'was decreased by a factor of 5\nresulting in a decrease in the electron densityof approximately a factor of\n1.8. A corresponding decrease in the rates of reactions 8 and 10 produces\na d e c r e a s e of a factor of 5 in the rate coefficient\na similar result. However,\nfor reaction 7 results in an increase in predicted electron density by a factor\nof approximately 1.8. These calculations illustrate that the results presented here for the C o t t e- rate coefficient are sensitive to the rate coefficients of reactions 7- 10.\nThe reaction rate-coefficient expression obtained here for the deionization of Cot at high temperatures is consistent with previous\n\n9\n\nm e a s u r e m e n t ~ \' - ~ f o r t h NOt (k, = (6.7 2 2.3) x 1021 Te -1.5\ne\nN2+ (kr = (1.520.5) x\nT e - l o 5 ) , and 0 2 + (kr = ( 8 2 2 ) x lozi Te-1.5),\ntwo-body dissociative recombination reactions. Though this comparison is\nonly qualitative, it does-suggest that the rate coefficients for the chargetransfer reactions are not drastically in error.\nFigure 10 presents a comparison between the Cot t e- rate coefficient data of his paper and the previous low-temperature data of Mentzoni\nand Donohoe. 18* \'9 The measurements were not obtained at comparable\nelectron temperatures so direct comparison is not possible.

LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS O F ELECTRON DENSITY AND\nELECTRON TEMPERATURE WITH RAM FLIGHT PROBES\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration has for several\ny e a r s conducted in-flight radio attenuation measurements (RA\nimprove understanding of the causes and methods of predicting\n33 the radio-signal degradation during e\'arth entry of a space vehicle. In the last few years, electrostatic probes projecting from the spacecraft into the boundary layer and inviscid flow have been flown in an attempt\nto measure in-flight electron-density distributions. 34 On-board diagnostic\nantennas,35s36 reflectometers,37 and VHF antennas38 have a l s o been used\nto obtain information about the surrounding plasma. Prior to flying the\n\n10\n\ndiagnostic antennas, measurements of the admittance of the RAM C and\nRAM C-C antennas were performed39a40 in a shock-tube facility. Such\nmeasurements can be very helpful in correctly interpreting the flight data.\nThe use of electrostatic probes to measure the electron density in\nthe plasma layer of an entering spacecraft has been extensively discus sed.41 * 4 2 S m e t a n ~ ~ ~ ~\ndeveloped a technique for obtaining electron densities from the ion current collectedby constant-voltage wires located in a\ntwo-dimen \'0 1 rarefied plasma stream. This theory\nw a s used by\nScharfman s22in reducing probe data obtained in an inviscid shock-tube\nflow to demonstrate the applicability of the theory to within a factor of 2 2\nfor the RAM C-1 probe for conditions at which the flow w a s free molecular\nwith respect to the wire diameter. It w a s difficult to investigate the probe\noperation in a boundary-layer flow in this facility because the boundary layer\nwas too thin for conditions at which sufficient uniform test flow could be\nobtained.\nThe purpose of this section i s to describe laboratory measurements\nof electron density obtained in the inviscid\nand boundary-layer flow of a conical nozzle using the RAM C-1 constant bias-voltage probe and m e a s u r e ments of electron density and electron temperature obtained in the inviscid\nflow using the RAM C-C voltage-swept thin-wire probes.\nAn important difference between the experiments discussed in this report and those mentioned above is that relatively thick boundary layers with electron temperatures significantly greater than the heavy-particle translational temperatures\ncan be obtained on the sidewall of the nozzle. Both the previous shock-tube\nexperiments and the present nozzle experiments contribute to establishing\nconfidence in the interpretation of the flight data obtained with the electrostatic probes.\n3.1\n\nExperimental Apparatus and Technique\n\nThe shock tube and nozzle described in Section 2 and shown in F i g . 1\nwas also used for these experiments. The test\ng a s used here was U P C nitrogen supplied by A i r Product and Chemicals, Inc. A chemical analysis of the\ng a s indicated the following: oxygen less than 0.5 ppm, total hydrocarbons\nl e s s than 1 ppm, and water less than 0.15 ppm. The shock tube\nw a s purged\nwith the t e s t g a s to approximately 5 t o r r j u s t p r i o r to each run. A detailed\ndiscussion of the nozzle starting process, uniform-flow duration, and\nboundary-layer growth has been previously p r e ~ e n t e d . ~The dominant\n~ , ~ ~\nchemical species at the nozzle measuring stations were calculated2 to be\nN2 , N and Nt\n\n.\n\nThe RAM C-1 electrostatic probe consists of eight iridium wires\nwith a length of approximately 0.180 inches and a diameter of approximately\n0.009 inches. The wires are supported\non a wedge-shaped dielectric material with the center-to-center separation distance between adjacent wires of\napproximately 0.4 inches. The wires were located in the nozzle\nso that their\nlength w a s perpendicular to the velocity vector. These wires were operated\n11\n\nin the inviscid flow at axial locations of 14.5 32.5 and 42.5\ninches from the\nthroat and in the boundary layer at 34.5 inches from the throat. The probe\nvoltage w a s maintained constant at -5 volts relative to the side collectors.\n\nA t the nozzle locations noted above, voltage- swept thin-wire probes\naligned with the flow direction were used to obtain an independent measurement of the electron density and electron temperature. The ion-current\nportion of the probe characteristic was used to infer the electron density.\nThe experimental procedure used to obtain the Langmuir-probe data in this\nnitrogen plasma has been described in detail in previous papers. , 2 6\n2\nThe RAM C-C flight probe consists of four lengths of iridium wire\nwith diameter and length of approximately 0.0047 inches and 0.4 1 inches,\nrespectively. These wires were mounted in\na wedge-shaped dielectric material similar to the RAM C-l probe but in this case the wires were oriented\nparallel to the flow direction. In the present experiments, the voltage on\nthese probes was swept from -5 to t 2 volts in approximately 80 p s e c , which\nis slow enough to avoid transient effects.46\nIn some cases the voltage ramp\nw a s referenced to tunnel ground and in other cases it was referenced to the\nside collectors. The results were insensitive to the voltage reference.\nHowever, the inferred electron density and electron temperature were found to\nbe very sensitive to probe contamination as will be discussed later.\nDuring all of the experiments noted above an independent measurement of the integrated free-stream electron density was obtained just\nupstream of the probe stations using microwave interferometers operating\nat\nfrequencies of either 35 o r 17 GHz.\n3.2 Discussion\n\nof Constant Bias-Voltage Probe Results in Inviscid Flow\n\nIt was noted above that the RAM C-1 probe w a s used in the inviscid\nflow at axial locations of 14.5, 32.5 and 42.5 inches. Figure\n11 presents\nA i-n\nA\n3\nA e-nl\nthe\nrelative\nmagnitudes\nof the\nmean paths\nfree\nA i-i\nand A e-e as a function of inviscidarearatio.?fResevalues\nwere calculated using the expressions summarized by S ~ n i and the previn ~ ~\nously reported nozzle-flow properties. For the purpose\nof estimating mean\nfree paths, the electron temperature can be assumed to be equal to the heavyparticle translational temperature from the reservoir down to 3500\xc2\xb0K at\nwhich point it can be considered to freeze. Measuring stations at 12.5\n, 32.5\nand 42.5 inches are located on Fig. 11 Also included in Fig.\n11 i s the relative magnitude of the various probe radii usedt i. e . , 0.002 and 0.0045\ninches. A t all of the measuring stations the electron mean free paths are\nlarge compared to the probe radius. Figure\n11 further shows that at the\n14.5-inch measuring station the RAM C- 1 wire diameter is sufficiently large\nthat interpretation of data using free-molecule theory should not provide the\ncorrect electron densities because current collectionshould be inhibited by\ntherelativelysmallvalues\nof X i-n and A n-n\nA t the32.5- and 42.5inch stations the 0.009-inch diameter probes should be in free-molecular\nflow. It was therefore decided to operate the RAM C- 1 probe at 32.5 and\n\n.\n\n12\n\n~\n\n"_\n.\n\n"\n\n.\n\n.-\n\n..\n\n."""*-I_"----\n\n7\n" - " - - - - - - "\n\n42.5 inches from the throat to confirm the data reduction technique, and at\n14.5 inches to investigate the influence of collisions on the number density\ndeduced using the free-molecular flow theory.\nFigure 12 illustrates typical RAM C-1 probe and microwave-interferometer data records obtained in the inviscid portion a n expanding nitroof\nand (b) a r e t h e\ngen plasma at 32.5 inches from the throat.

Figure 12(c) is the\n17 GHz microwave interferometer record\nobtained one inch upstream of the electrostatic probes. The electron density\nmeasured with this interferometer is used as the reference with which the\nnumber density calculated from the probe current is compared.\nBefore calculating the number density from the probe data it is helpful to know the local electron temperature. These temperature measurements were performed in previous experiments\nand were repeated here for\nverification. A s shown in Fig. 5 of Ref. 2 an average value of 3500\xc2\xb0K is\nrepresentative of the plasma at the 32.5- and 42.5-inch locations. The corresponding heavy-particle translational temperature calculated for these\nstations is in the range 500 to 600\xc2\xb0K. It should be noted that the electron\ndensities obtained from the theory are a weak function of temperature. That\nis, i f 500\xc2\xb0K were used as the electron temperature instead of 3500"K, then\nthe electron density would be overpredicted by approximately15 to 20 p e r\ncent which is within the experimental scatter presented in Figs 13 and\n14.\nF r o m the viewpoint of flight-data analysis this insensitivity is important because it suggests that knowledge of T e i s not essential for reduction of the\nRAM C-1 probe data. It should be emphasized that this observation is not\nt r u e when obtaining electron densities from voltage-swept probes aligned\nwith the flow since in this case the number densityis approximately proportional to the square root of the electron temperature. The RAM C-1 data\nanalysis procedure has been discussed in detail elsewhere 32,41242 will\nand\nnot be repeated here.\nFigures 13 and 14 present the ratio of the number density deduced\nfrom the probe t o that obtained from the microwave interferometer with the\nprobe located in the inviscid flow at 32.5 and at 42.5 inches from the thro\nrespectively. Boundary-layer measurements were previously performed\nat these stations for similar reflected-shock reservoir conditions but with\nair as the test gas instead of nitrogen. The boundary-layer thicknesses\nshould not be significantly different for these\ntwo gases. A t the nozzle stations of interest here the width of the uniform inviscid flow is approximately\n21 to 24 inches which is considerably larger than the 3.53-inch width of the\nRAM C - 1 probe.\nAt each location the experiment was repeated approximately 12 to 14\ntimes as indicated by the separate symbols. The centerline of the wedge\nleading edge was located on the nozzle centerline. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate that for the majority of the measurements the ratio was in the range\n13\n\nfrom 0.80 to 1.20.\nP a r t of this scatter is due to the slight nonuniformity of\nthe plasma as illustrated by Fig. 12(c) and p a r t is due to the accuracy with\nwhich the data records shown in F i g s . 12(a) to 12(c) can be read. On the\nbasis of this comparison i t was concluded that the theory predicts the correct\nelectron density when used in the flow regime for which it w a s intended.\nAfter completing the electrostatic-probe measurements in the freemolecular-flow regime, the probe w a s moved to a location 14.5 inches from\nthe nozzle throat (where the uniform inviscid-flow widthwas approximately\n5 inches) and the experiment was repeated. From Fig. 11 one sees that at\nX n-n and X i-n were less than the wire radius. The\nthislocationboth\nratio of the probe radius to this ion-neutral mean free pathwas approximately 2.8. Since the probes were in\na transition-flow regimer interpretation of\nthe collected-current data in terms of Smetana\'s free-molecular flow theory\nshould not be expected to give the\ncorrect results. However, this theory\nw a s employed to deduce the number densities in order to qualitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the results to collisions. The results\nof these measurements are presented in Fig. 15 and illustrate that the probe-deduced number\ndensities were approximately 0.6 to 0.9 of the microwave interferometer\nvalues. The lower number densities measured by probes # 1 and # 8 at the extremities of the 3.53-inch wide probe suggest that the electron density may\nvary by approximately 10 t o 15 per cent across the 5-inch wide inviscid core.\nHowever, this variation is not important for the purposes of this study since\nthe remaining data suggest that i f the probe is operated in a transition flowr\nthen the number densities obtained in the conventional manner will be somewhat l e s s than actual.\nThe influence of collisions on the inferred number density discussed\nabove is considerably less than that obtained in previous work by Weissman,\ne t al.47 These authors performed experiments under conditions f o r which\nthe ratio of the probe radius to ion-neutral mean free path w a s the same as\nexperienced here but they found that the inferred number density was approximately 0.05 of the microwave interferometer values. The difference between the results of the two experiments is felt to be due to a f r e e - s t r e a m\nvelocity effect since Weissman\'s experiments were performed in a lowvelocity flame facility in contrast to the much higher-velocity flow of the\nshock-tunnel results reported here.\n\nA simple analy i has been published by Talbot and ChouZ4 that has\nbeen used successfull$\'to\ncorrect thin-wire data (aligned with the flow direction) for collisional effects.\nThe analysis is ahemeforinterpolating\nbetween the free-molecular theory of Laframboise" and the collision dominated results of Shulz and Brown.48 The technique\nof Talbot and Chou in its\npresent form is not applicable to the RAM C- 1 geometry but it would be helpful for extending the altitude range of the probe data i f such a correction\ntechnique could be found. A brief but unsuccessful literature search was\nmade for an appropriate correction technique.\n\n1\n4\n\n3.3 Discussion of Constant Bias-Voltage Probe Results in\nBoundary-Layer Flow\nThe RAM C-1 probe was also used to obtain the electron-density\ndistribution in the nozzle-wall boundary layer at 34.5 inches from the nozzle\nthroat. The electron-temperature distribution and an independent m e a s u r e ment of the electron-density distribution were obtained using voltage-swept\nthin-wire Langmuir probes. Detailed boundary-layer velocity\nand density\ndistributions had previously been performed at this nozzle location (using air\nas the test gas) and the results suggested that the wire probes should be in a\n45 was\nfree-molecular flow regime. The velocity distribution from Ref.\nused in reducing the probe data because of the similarity in test conditions.\nThe measured electron temperatures presented in F i g . 16 were also utilized.\nThe boundary-layer thickness ( 6 ) and displacement thickness ( 6 ) noted\n,\non F i y 2 16 and 17 were calculated using the method given by Burke and\nBirdfor\na turbulent\nboundary\nlayer. boundary-layer\nThe\nand displacement thicknesses calculated in this manner have been shown to be in good\nagreement with experimental data f o r reflected-shock reservoir conditions\nsimilar to those used here but with a i r a s the t e s t g a s . Calculations indicate\nthat the nozzle-wall boundary-layer growth for nitrogen should be very similar to what it was for air.\nThe temperature results presented in F i g . 16 suggest that the electron temperature decreases as the nozzle wall i s approached. The scatter\nin the data is approximately 4 15 to 20 per cent which is somewhat greater\nthan previously experienced ( 210 per cent) with the thin-wire probeswhen\nthey were used in the inviscid-flow environment.\nThe electron-density distribution measured in the wall boundary layer\nis presented in F i g . 17. The results obtained with the\nRAM G-1 probe are\nshown to be in good agreement with the voltage-swept Langmuir probe measurements. A s previously mentioned, these latter number densities were obtained from the ion-current portionof the current-voltage characteristic.\nTypical data records for these probes and the interpretation method has been\npreviously presented. 2 ~ 4 9The scatter in the thin-wire electron-density\nmeasurements is again somewhat greater than previously experienced using\nthe same diagnostic technique in the inviscid flow.\n\nIt was noted in Ref. 2 that the indicated number density can be greater\nthan the real value when using thin-wire probes in a region where the ratio of\nprobe radius to Debye length becomes less than one. Care was taken in these\nexperiments to avoid this problem by using relatively large diameter wire\n(still within constraints of free-molecular flow) in the low electron-density\nregion of the boundary layer.\nWithin the accuracy of the experimental data presented in Fig. 17 the\nelectron-density distribution appears to approach the measured free-stream\nvalue at approximately 2.25 inches from the wall. A s noted, this is in good\nagreement with the anticipated boundary-layer thickness. Further, the\nelectron-density distribution obtained with theRAM C-1 probe appears to be\n15\n\nin good agreement with the distribution obtained with the thin-wire probes.\n3.4 Discussion\n\nofRAM C-C Swept-Voltage Probe Data\nin Inviscid Flow\n\nThe RAM C-C swept-voltage probe was operated in the inviscid flow\nat 32.5 inches from the nozzle throat. The probe voltage was swept from\n-5 to t2 volts referenced to either tunnel ground or the side collectors. The\nelectron-density and electron-temperature results were found to be independent of the voltage reference. A t this nozzle location the wires were in the\nfree-molecular flow r e g i m e ( s e e F i g . 11) and thus the theory of Laframboise\nwas used in the data reduction.\nThe electron-density and electron-temperature measurements obtained with this probe were found to be in excellent agreement with previous\nthin-wire measurements at this nozzle location. The electron-density measurements were also in good agreement with simultaneously obtained microwave interferometer values measured one inch upstreamof the probes.\nIn order to obtain reproducible data from the swept-voltage probes it\nis essential that the surface be free of contaminants. Experience with these\nprobes indicates that when the surface is contaminated, high electron temperatures are indicated. This observation is consistent with that reported in\nRef. 50. It is normal laboratory procedure to ultrasonically clean each\nprobe immediately prior to each experiment\'ina dilute solution of sodium\nhydroxide if the probe is tungsten or a dilute sodium chloride-hydrochloric\nacid solution if the probe material i s iridium. The probe is used for a single run and then discarded.\nIt thus becomes important for the flight application to have some idea of the susceptibility of the flight probes to relatively\nsmall contamination levels. For this reason, the probes were operated for\nthree consecutive experiments without cleaning. For each experiment the\nprobe is exposed to the high-temperature test gas and interface gas for a\ntotal time of approximately one millisecond. The electron temperature results obtained in these experiments were reproduced with210 per cent which\nis within the limits of normal experimental scatter. Further use in the absence of cleaning resulted in increases in indicated electron temperatures\nby a factor of two to four. The identity or quantity of the contaminant responsible for the increased temperatures is not known at the present time.\n3.5ConcludingRemarks\nThe RAM C-1 and RAM C-C flight probes have been used to measure\nelectron density and electron temperature in the inviscid\nand boundary-layer\nflow of the conical nozzle of a reflected-shock tunnel. Nitrogen was used as\nthe test gas and was expanded from an equilibrium reservoir condition of\n7200\xc2\xb0K and 17.1 atm.\nThe electron densities deduced from the current collected by*the RAM\nC-1 probe and Smetana\'s theory were found to be in good agreement with\n\n16\n\nindependent measurements when the conditions of the theory were obeyed.\nThe electron densities and electron temperatures measured with the RAM\nC-C probe were also in good agreement with independent measurements.\nHowever, the electron-temperature measurement\nis sensitive to probesurface contamination which could be troublesome at some point in the reentry trajectory..\n4.\n\nANTENNA ADMITTANCE MEASUREMENTS IN THE PRESENCE\nO F IONIZED BOUNDARY LAYERS\n\nThe purpose of this phase of the studies w a s to investigate the agreement between measured and predicted antenna admittance for a known d i s t r i bution of electron density in theplasma layer adjacent to the plate surface.\nThis research is essentially an extension of the work of Taylor40 who h a s\npreviously measured the admittance of the antennas used here in a shocktube flow under much different conditions. His boundary layers were much\nthinner than the present ones and the lengthof the uniform plasma was much\nless. The collision frequency,\nv / u , of his plasma (0.1 torr experiments)\nwas less than 0.15 which is of the same order as that obtained here. Taylor\nillustrates good comparison between his experimental data and the predictions of Croswell, et.a1.51 A t the present time, the theoretical calculations\n(being performed by W . F. Croswell and C . T . Swift of the Langley Research\nCenter) for the conditions of interest here cannot be finalized because a\nmore detailed study of the boundary-layer electron-density profiles for the\ncarbon monoxide plasma is yet to be completed.\nA s p a r t of t h i s r e s e a r c h , two S-band and one X-band antennas typical\nof the RAM flight hardware were mounted in a sharp flat-plate model which\nw a s subsequently placed in the fiberglas nozzle of the shock tunnel (see\nFig. 1 ) . The boundary layer over the plate provided an electron-density gradient in the near field of the antennas. This boundary-layer was sufficiently\nthick so a s to p e r m i t good resolution of the electron-density profile by detailed probing with thin-wire Langmuir probes.\n\nThe initial antenna-admittance and electron-density measurements\nwere conducted in an argon to. 12% nitrogen test gas. The boundary layer\nwas probed in detail at two locations along the plate and the result will be\ndiscussed later in this section. Using this test gas,\nit was possible to\nachieve critical electron density for the 3348 MHz antennas but difficult to\nobtain values sufficiently in excess of critical to investigate the antenna response for overdense plasmas. The test gas was changed to carbon monoxide and sufficiently high electron densities were obtained to achieve this\ngoal. All of these measurements were performed for low collision frequency\nplasmas ( V / W 5 0.15) and therefore the influence of collisions on the results\nwas not investigated. However,\nit i s considered important to investigate the\ninfluence of collisions, but that will necessarily be done at a later date. A s\npreviously mentioned, the electron-density distributions in these boundary\nl a y e r s a r e not p r e c i s e l y known because it was not possible to probe the\n\n17\n\ncarbon monoxide boundary layers under support of the current contract.\nHowever, for the purposes of preliminary calculations, the profiles measured in the argon plus 0.12\xe2\x80\x997\xe2\x80\x990 nitrogen plasma can be used because the gas\ndynamic parameters and the chemical kinetics are similar for the test\nconditions considered.\nThe width of the ground plane used in these experiments w a s such\nthat it was not possible to move the flat plate sufficiently close to the nozzle\nthroat so as to achieve X-band critical electron density. It\nis currently\nplanned to re-structure the model so that this can be done in the future. In\nso doing, the collision frequency,\nv / w , will also be i n c r e a s e d . F o r t h i s\nreason, the discussion presented here will be confined to the admittance\nmeasurements obtained with the two S-band antennas.\n4.1 Electron-Density Distributions in Boundary Layer Over Flat Plate\n\nModel\n\nIn preparation for the antenna admittance measurements, the\nboundary-layer electron-density profiles at two plate locations were measured. The plate was located in the inviscid nozzle flow such that the leading\nedge was at 22.5 inches from the throat\nand the top surface was on the nozzle\ncenterline. The test gas used in these experiments\nw a s argon plus 0 . 1 2 p e r\ncent nitrogen. The reflected-shock processed gas\nw a s a t an equilibrium\nreservoir condition of 12,150\xe2\x80\x99K at 30.1 atm pressure. The dominant chemical species at the leading edge of the plate were calculated to be A r and A r t\nand the f r e e - s t r e a m Mach number was calculated to be 15.0.\nA small amount of nitrogen (0.12 per cent) was added to the argon\ntest gas in order to obtain ionization equilibrium in the reflected-shock reservoir prior to termination of the useful test time. As a result of this nitrogen\naddition, the electron temperatures in the expansion are greater than the\nargon temperatures because of the electron thermal energy transfer with the\nvibrational degrees of freedom of molecular nitrogen.52\nThe flat-plate model was 7-inches wide\nby 30-inches long. The top\nsurface was constructed of Plexiglas with the exception of a 1-inch long stainless steel leading edge. Boundary-layer surveys were performed at distances from the leading edge of 6.75 and 19.25 inches.\nAt the most upstream\nlocation, the flow is considered to be two-dimensional since spanwise staticpressure measurements obtained by B ~ y e at 5 and 10 inches from the\nr ~ ~\nleading edge, for similar flow conditions, indicated that the flow was uniform\na c r o s s the plate. However, for the 19.25 inch location pressure measurements were not obtained, and it is possible that the flow here may not have\nbeen two-dimensional.\nDuring all of the experiments noted above an independent measurement of the integrated freestream electron density was obtained just upstream\nof the probe stations using microwave interferometers operating at frequencies of either 35 o r 17 GHz\n\n.\n\n18\n\nThe voltage-swept thin-wire probes used for these measurements\nwere described in previous sections. In performing the probe measurements, care was taken to keep the probe holder\nfar out in the flow to avoid\nany possible interference effects in the subsonic flow region. The quartz\ntubing surrounding the probes was bent as shown in Fig. 18. The 1/ 16-inch\ndiameter tubing used in the probe construction did not permit probing to distances less than 0.060 inches off the plate surface.\nA typical swept-voltage probe data record obtained at 0.060 inches\nfrom the plate surface is shown in Fig. 19. Also shown is a 17 GHz microwave-interferometer data record obtained 1-inch upstream of the leading\nedge. The calculated Mach number\nof the freestream at the leading edge of\nthe plate w a s equal to 15.0 and the mean free paths were as follows:\ncm, A\n2.7 c m ,\nA e - e - 1.5 cm, A i-i E 1.7 x\nA n-n- 7.8 x 10-3 c m , and A i - n g 2.4 x 10-3 cm\nThe magnitude of\nthese mean free paths increased with increasing distance from the throat.\nAt the first measuring station over the plate the smallest of these mean free\nA i - i , was about 0 . 5 of the probe radius. It was assumed that the\npaths,\nprobes were operating in free molecular flow and the free molecular flow\ntheory23 was used in reducing the data.\n\n.\n\nNumber-density measurements obtained in the boundary layer at 6.75\ninches are shown in F i g . 20. The measurements approach\nthe estimated\nfreestream value at approximately 1 .O 2 0 . 2 inches from the surface and dec r e a s e by an order of magnitude as the w a l l is approached which is consistent with the estimated gas density in this region.\nThe leading edge of the flat plate (first 1 inch) was constructed of\nstainless steel and the remainder of the plate surface was Plexiglas. It was\nrealized that this construction represents a potential step<Junction change in\nsurfacecatalysis.However,resultspresented\nby Chung\nsuggestthatsuch\na change should not influence the boundary-layer profiles at the\ntwo downstream measuring stations for these experiments. The dominant\nion in this\nflow environment was calculated to be A r t . In addition, the freestream\nArt\nconcentration was found to be frozen well upstream of the plate leading edge.\nIt is thus unlikely that gas-phase recombination of ions and electrons in the\nboundary layer would be important. Also doubtful\ni s the possibility that the\nPlexiglas surface would provide a good catalyst for surface recombination\nwhich would then result in a diffusion controlled boundary layer that could\nhave a profile consistent with the measurements. Most likely, the boundarylayer electron concentration was frozen at an upstream value and the measured profile reflects the boundary-layer gas-density distribution. However,\nit is difficult to be certain of the mechanism responsible for the measured\nnumber-density profile. The scatter in these ion,-density data\nis l e s s than\nexperienced in the wall boundary layer but consistent with that observed in\ninviscid-flow measurements.\nThe flat-plate boundary layer electron-temperature measurements\nare presented in Fig. 21 Unfortunately, there w a s significant scatter in the\nresults of these temperature measurements. It was not possible to observe\n19\n\nthe trend of decreasing electron temperature through the boundary layeras\nwas seen in the nozzle-wall experiments r e o r t e d h e r e and in the previous\nflat-plate experiments of Tseng and T a l b 0 t 5 ~On the basis of these measurements it could only be concluded that the electron temperature was relatively constant through the boundary layerat a level considerably higher than\nthe argon translational temperature of approximately 130 O K .\nElectron-density and electron-temperature measurements obtained\nat 19.25 inches from the leading edge a r e presented in Figs. 2 2 and 23.\nThe\nnumber-density measurements suggest a reasonably thick boundary layer on\nthe order of 2.0 inches, at which the measured number density approaches\nthe estimated freestream value of 4.0 x 1 0 1 0 e - / c m 3 . T h i s e s t i m a t e of the\nnumber-density is included for comparison purposes and was obtained from\nmicrowave-interferometer data taken at the measuring station in the absence\nof the plate. This comparison assumes that the plate does not significantly\ndisturb the flow. The decrease in the outer-flow electron density between\nthe 6.75 and 19.25 inch locations\nis consistent with that anticipated a s a r e sult of gas-density decrease and frozen electron concentration.\nThe electron-temperature data presented in Fig. 23 suggests that the\nelectron temperature was relatively uniform through the boundary layer.\nThe data scatter is considerably less than experienced at the 6.75 inch location. The explanation for this difference\nis not clear since the same diagnostic techniques and flow environment were used to obtain the measurements.\nComparison of F i g s . 21 and 23 suggests that the electron temperature was\nnot only constant through the boundary layer, but it was also relatively constant along the plate. This observation\nis consistent with a frozen boundaryl a y e r flow in the absence of energy sinks such a s thermalization, exchange\nwith vibration, etc. and the absence\nof energy sources such as recombination.\n4.2 Admittance Measurements with\n\nRAM Antennas\n\nFigure 24(a) and (b) illustrate the RAM C-C S-band antenna\n(3348 MHz) and the RAM C S-band (3348 MHz) and X-band (10044 MHz)\nantennas mounted in the flat-plate model.\nA s can be seen from Fig. 24(b),\nthe RAM C-C antenna does not extend through the Plexiglas top surface of the\nplate. However, both of the RAMC antennas do so t h a t t h e i r a p e r t u r e s a r e\nimmediately adjacent to the ionized boundary layer. For\nall of the data reported in this section, the test gas was carbon monoxide. It should be emphasized that the boundary-layer measurements described earlier were performed in an Argon t 0.1270 nitrogen test gas. A description of the flat-plate\nconstruction is given in Section 4.1.\nSchematic diagrams of the S-band and X-band four-probe reflectome t e r s a r e given in Figs. 25 and 26. The reflected signal was also monitored\nas indicated on the schematics. These systems were very convenient for\ndata reduction purposes -in that five arcs were always available for SmithChart construction. Waveguide instead of coaxial cable was used wherever\npossible in the systems.\n20\n\nIn the remainder of this section, the experimental data obtained to\ndate for the RAM C and the RAM C-C S-band antennas are described separately. A s previously noted, the electron densities at the measuring stations\nwere not sufficiently high to excite the X-band antenna.\n\n-\n\n4 . 2 . 1 RAM C S-band antenna measurements.\nA s p a r t of the preexperiment calibration, the diode spacings were measured using a moveable\nshort. If the microwave diodes a r e n u m b e r e d so that #1 is nearest the gen= 0.1255 A G ,\ne r a t o r and #4 is nearest the short, then the spacings were 1-2\n2-3 = 0.1218 A G , 3-4 = 0.1278 A G , and 4-1 = 0.1252 A G where A G w a s\nthe guide wavelength of 11.378 cm. The reflectometer system\nw a s tuned\nusing a matched load with VSWR of approximately 1.025 to 1.035. Each\nof\nthe diodes was then calibrated as follows. An attenuation of 3 db w a s s e t on\nthe variable attenuator and the four diode outputs were adjusted until they\nwere equal. The attenuation was increased in increments\nof 1 db until reaching 26 db. The attenuator w a s then set to 0 attenuation and the final readings\ntaken. The voltages were normalized\nso that the diode output at 3 db attenuation represented the radius of the Smith Chart. During the experiments this\n3 db tare was a l w a y s s e t on the variable attenuator.\nThe free-space admittance w a s measured with the antenna inside and\noutside of the shock tunnel, but no difference w a s observed between the results. Aluminum foil was then placed over the antenna aperture to obtain the\nantenna short reference. In addition, the coaxial cable was shorted at the\nantenna input terminal to obtain an additional reference.\nThis antenna was operated at two locations in the flat plate, 6.75 and\n11.25 inches from the leading edge. The major differences between these\nmeasuring stations are the boundary-layer thickness and the peak value of\nthe electron density. Previous Langmuir-probe measurements in the argonnitrogen test gas suggested that the boundary-layer peak electron density\nwould be nearly equal to the freestream value at the antenna location. Three\nexperiments were performed at the 6.75-inch location, but in each case the\nplasma was considerably overdense. Several additional experiments were\nperformed at the 11.25-inch location and these spanned the range from underdense thru critical to overdense. The results of these experiments are given\nin Table 2 .\nFigure 27 i s typical of the reflectometer and microwaveis\ninterferometer oscilloscope records obtained: The test-flow duration\nnoted on the oscilloscope records. The 50-ysec duration pulse near the right\nside of these records is the zero-signal level obtained by turning off the TWT\nand the microwave interferometer power supply with a gating pulse. The\nhorizontal line is the no-plasma signal level recorded approximately two\nmilliseconds prior to plasma arrival at the plate leading edge.\nA limited\nnumber of lower confidence-level data points can be obtained from the posttest time plasma. In some cases this w a s done and the data points are so\ndesignated in the discussion to follow.\n\n21\n\nThe measured voltage reflection coefficients are presented in Fig.28\nas a function of,peak electron density over the antenna divided b critical\nelectron density for 3348 MHz (approximately 1.4 x lo1 e - / c m\nRecall\nthat these electron densities are obtained by extrapolating upstream microwave interferometer measurements because Langmuir-probe measurements\nabove the plate were not performed for carbon monoxide test gas. Previous\nexperience in an argon-nitrogen test gas has indicated that this type exof\ntrapolation gives reasonably good results.\n\nY).\n\nOne of the more interesting results of these experiments is the difference between the voltage reflection coefficients of approximately 1.O m e a s ured at the 6.75-inch location and the value of approximately 0.70 measured\nat the 11.25-inch location for ne/ne)cr values\nin the range 1.5 to 3. The\nmost obvious diffecence between these locations is that the boundary layer\nwas somewhat thinner at the upstream location than it was downstream suggesting that boundary-layer thickness may have a significant influence on the\nresults. The data presented in Fig.\n28 also illustrate a rapid change in reflection coefficient in the range 0 . 4 < 1 1 ~ / n e ) ~ ~O . Outside of this number1. <\ndensity range, the reflection coefficient alone is not a sensitive indicator of\nelectron density.\nA l l of the results obtained with this antenna are plotted on a single\nSmith Chart and given in F i g . 29. The circles indicate this uncertainty in\nthe five arc intersections. The phase rotation and voltage reflection coefficient with changing electron density are both illustrated by this plot. For\npurposes of completeness, these phase measurements and their estimated\nuncertainty are replotted in F i g . 30 a s a function of ne/nelcr\n\nAs previously noted, the reflection coefficient w a s essentially zero\nwhen the X-band antenna was used at these locations even for the highest\nelectron densities. For this reason, the\nX-band r e s u l t s a r e not presented\nhere.\n4.2.2 RAM C-C S-band antenna measurements. ". - The R A M C-C\n~.\nantenna was installed in the flat plate at 6.75 inches from the leading edge\nand the top side of the plate was located on the nozzle centerline with the\nleading edge at 22.5 inches from the nozzle throat. Carbon monoxide was\nused a s the test gas so that relatively high electron-density levels could be\nachieved in the boundary layer over the plate. The average freestream electron density was measured at 11.5 and 21.5 inches from the nozzle throat\nusing microwave interferometers.\nThe reflectometer diode spacings for these experiments were the\nsame as those given in Section 4.3.1 f o r the S-band system. The free space\nadmittance was found to be independent of whether the antenna was inside o r\noutside of the fiberglas nozzle. Aluminum foil\nw a s placed under the plexiglas and over the antenna aperture to obtain the aperture-short reference.\nThe coaxial cable w a s also shorted at the antenna input terminal in order to\nobtain an additional reference.\n\n22\n\nFor these experiments, the peak electron density over the antenna\nwas varied in the range of approximately 0.6 < n , / ~ ~ e )2.9 ~by adjusting\n~ <\nthe strength of the incident shock. The experimental results obtained, including the arc lengths for the five diodes, are summarized in Table 3.\nFigure 31 is typical of the oscilloscope records obtained for the\nreflectometer diodes and the microwave interferometers. The test time\nis\nnoted on the oscilloscope records as are the no-plasma voltages and the\nvoltages with the TWT and interferometer power supply turned off. Once\nagain, it was possible to use the post test-time flow (see Fig. 31(g)) and obtain lower confidence-level microwave-interferometer and reflectometer\ndata.\nA l l of the reflectometer data obtained in the CO plasma with the\nRAM C-C antenna are presented on the Smith Chart of Fig. 32. Again, the\ncircles represent the uncertainty of the measurements as determinedby the\nintersection of the five diode voltages. Much of the phase rotation uncertainty associated with these records w a s due to the # 1 diode a r c being consistently long. Care was taken to calibrate each\nof the oscilloscopes just\np r i o r to and after each experiment using a VTVM, thus it is doubtful that the\ndifficulty is associated with a calibration error. This diode appeared to operate satisfactorily when obtaining the free space admittance for which the\ncircle of uncertainty was comparatively small.\n\nThe voltage reflection-coefficient measurements for the RAM C - C\nantenna are presented in Fig. 33 a s a function of ne/ne)cr. The peak\nelectron-density level at the measuring station w a s extrapolated from the\ntwo u p s t r e a m ( l l . 5 and 21.5-inches from the throat) microwaveinterferometer measurements in the manner described in Section 4.2.1.\nThe free space reflection coefficient (see Table 3) measured j u s t p r i o r to\nplasma arrival ranged from 0.33 to 0.36. A decrease from this free space\nvalue to a value of 0.25 was observed when the ratio of ne/neIcr reached\nabout 0.64 suggesting that the plasma may have tuned the antenna.\nIn support of this suggestion, the oscilloscope record\nof the reflected-signal diode\ni s given in Fig. 34 along with the microwave-interferometer oscilloscope\nrecords obtained at the upstream locations. During the useful test-flow period, the reflected signal can be seen to\'be significantly less than the noplasma or free space value. For electron densities greater than ne/nejcr\nof 0.64, the reflection coefficient increases rapidly to a value of approximately 0.86 a t n / n e ) c r of 1.2 and remained relatively constant for increase\ning electron-density levels.\n4.3\nConclusions\nNumber-density and electron-temperature distributions were measured in the boundary layer of a sharp flat plate at 6.75 and 19.25 inches\nfrom the plate leading edge. Significant gradients in electron density were\nmeasured through the boundary layer but the electron temperature w a s found\nto be relatively constant. In addition, the electron temperature remained\n23\n\nrelatively constant along the plate. These measurements were performed in\nan argon + O . 12% nitrogen test gas. This choice of gas was unfortunate because it was later found that significantly greater electron densities could be\nobtained in carbon monoxide test gas. These higher number densities were\nnecessary for the purpose of the antenna admittance measurements also r e ported herein.\nThe RAMC and RAM C-C S-band antennas were operated in the\npresence of an ionized boundary layer of low collision frequency. Both antennas illustrate marked increases in voltage reflection coefficient and phase\nrotation when the peak electron density over the antenna approached critical.\nThe influence of boundary-layer thickness was investigated for the RAM C\nantenna measurements and found to be significant. Comparison\nof the experimental results with existing theory is yet to be completed.\nREFERENCES\n1.\nDunn,\nM.G.\nand\nL o r d i , J .

G. Dunn and\n\nS. W . Kang\n\nCornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc.\nBuffalo, New York\nINTRODUCTION\n1.\nNear the end of t h i s c o n t r a c t , a study w a s performed using stateof-the-art techniques to obtain estimates of the signal attenuation for the\nMars-Viking entry conditions. Flow-field calculations with nonequilibrium\nchemical reactions were carried out in order to obtain preliminary\ne s t i m a t e s of the electron-density and collision-frequency distribution in the\nstagnationregion of theVikinglandercapsuleforthemin\np\nmean p ,\n9s \'\nm a x p 9 s andmax H p,\ntrajectoriessupplied by theMartinCompany1for\na\n- 17 entry angle.\nF o r t h e p u r p o s e s of t h e p r e l i m i n a r y e s t i m a t e s r e q u i r e d of this study\nand the short time period available, the stagnation-region plasma\nw a s felt to\nbe reasonably representative of the plasma anticipated over the conical section of the forebody. Estimates\nof the plasma-layer thickness and the\nnumber-density distributions are presented later in the text for locations away from the stagnation region which provide an indication of the probable\ndifferences between the plasma in these locations.\nA s w i l l be discussed later,\nthis downstream flow field should be analyzed in more detail in order\nto obtain improved estimates of the signal attenuation history.\nThe calculated electron-density and collision-frequency distributions\nin the stagnation region plasma were used to calculate the plane-wave transmission coefficient (for frequencies from\n100 Mc to 3000 Mc) history for the\nmax p ,\nand m a x H p ,\ntrajectories.\nBoth\ninviscid viscous-layer\nand\nflow-field analyses were performed.

It is important to emphas i z e t h a t t h e p r e d i c t i o n s p r e s e n t e d h e r e a r e only as a c c u r a t e as the reaction\nrate coefficients used in the analysis.\nThe technique used herein to calculate the inviscid, nonequilibrium\nflow behind the bow shock was that described by Marrone2 and Gibson and\nM a r r ~ n e .Since this technique is well known, it is n o t n e c e s s a r y t o d i s c u s s\n~\nit in detail. However, the viscous-layer flow-field calculation technique\nis\nnot as well known and Section 2 is included in this appendix in order to help\nclarify the physics of this problem. In section\n3 , typical results of the calculations performed during the available time period are presented.\nA brief\ndescription of the downstream viscous-layer solution and a description of the\ntechnique that could be used to predict the influence of ablation impurities on\nthe plasma properties are given in Section 4. Recommendations for future\nwork that should be completed before accurate estimates\nof the communication blackout boundaries can be defined are given in the conclusion of the\ntext.\n\n2.\n\nVISCOUS, HYPERSONIC\nSHOCK-LAYER\n\nDuring entry into the Martian atmosphere, the flow field surrounding\nthe Viking vehicle undergoes changes in character depending\nupon conditions\nsuch a s the vehicle velocity, angle of a t t a c k , t h e M a r s a t m o s p h e r e m o d e l ,\nand the altitude. For given flight conditions, the important parameter delineating the character of the flow is the altitude (or density) effect. Specifically, at low altitudes, the flow field consists\nof a thin boundary layer and\nan inviscid shock layer around the vehicle. However, the low-density effect\n(or low-Reynolds number effect) prevails at high altitudes, resulting in the\ncompletely viscous shock layer, and there\nno longer exists an "inviscid"\nhypersonic shock layer and\na thin ("Prandtl") boundary layer. Thus\nit is i m p o r t a n t to determine where the viscous shock-layer regimes exist for given\nflight conditions in the Martian atmosphere.\nFor this purpose, calculations were performed for the boundary( A ) a s a function\nl a y e r t h i c k n e s s ( 6 ) and the inviscid shock-layer thickness\nof the altitude for various Martian entry trajectories. The boundary-layer\nthickness was calculated from the Prandtl equations and is based on the works\nof Fay and Riddel14 and Scala and Baulknight.5 Separate calculations were\n6\nmade for the inviscid shock-layer thickness based on Hayes and Probstein.\nF i g u r e 1 shows the results of t h e s e c a l c u l a t i o n s i n t e r m s of 6 / A a t\nthe stagnation region as a function of the altitude and the flight trajectory.\nThe lower shaded region describes the altitude ranges in which the thin\nboundary-layer approximation and the inviscid shock-layer equations are\nvalid. And, strictly speaking, this\nis the region in which the above calculations are quantitatively meaningful. Beyond this region, that\ni s , for\n6 / A ? 0.1 (higher altitudes), the flow-field character changes such that\nat\nfirst the viscous interaction is important and then the "inviscid" shock layer\n\nA-2\n\ndisappears as a result of the viscous effects extending all the way to the\nshock wave. Therefore,\nbeyond the lower shaded portion, it\nis no longer\nc o r r e c t to treat the flow field in terms of the thin boundary-layer flow and\nthe inviscid shock layer.\nThe upper shaded portion delineates the altitude ranges in which the\nshock layer is now entirely viscous. This brings about two effects which\ndirectly influence the magnitudes of the electron-number densities in the\nshock layer. The first is that the effect\nof the low surface temperature of\nthe vehicle is felt in the entire shock layer, causing a decrease in the overall flow-field temperature. The second\nis that there exists species diffusion\nin the layer so that the electrons diffuse both to the vehicle surface and to\nthe shock wave, resulting in lower values\nof the electron-number densities\nand a "smoothed-out" profile shape in the viscous shock layer.\nIt is thus clear that new analyses are necessary for this region dealing with the effects described above. This has been done\nby Kang for the\ncase of mass injection,7 for the ionized nonequilibrium case8\nand for the ablating nonequilibrium case.9 These analyses were applied to the Mars entry\ncase for the Viking vehicle and some of the results obtained to date w i l l be\npresented in greater detail in the following sections. For the intermediate\n"viscous-interaction" region between the viscous-shock-layer\nflow regime\nand the boundary-layer flow regime, the analysis for the viscous-layer flow\nwas extended to obtain the electron-number-density distributions. The results based on the thin boundary-layer and the inviscid shock-layer flow w i l l\nalso be presented for comparison in the following sections.\n3.\n\nRESULTS O F INVISCID AND VISCOUS SHOCK-LAYER CALCULATIONS\n\nThe previous section described the altitude region of applicability for\nthe four atmosphere-trajectories of interest in terms of the thin boundarylayer-inviscid flow regime and the viscous shock-layer regime.\nIn this section.we present results obtained throughout these entry trajectories assuming that each of these two flow-field analyses were valid. It is very important\nto emphasize that in the altitude region between these two regimes (see\nFig. 1) the thin boundary-layer-inviscid flow analysis gives an upper limit of\nthe number density and the viscous shock-layer analysis gives\na lower limit\nof the number density. Therefore, it\ni s necessary for the user of these calculations to apply some judgement, based\nupon his particular interest, in\narriving at the predictions of electron number density in this intermediate\nflow-field regime.\nBefore continuing with the presentation of our results, it is important\nto re-emphasize that the calculations presented in this section do not include\nthe influences of ablation products on the shock layer electron-density and\ncollision-frequency profiles. The reader\nis cautioned against directly applying the results presented herein in view of the possible major effects of ablation products. The Martin Company1 has already performed calculations\n"\n\nA -3\n\nto assess t h i s i m p o r t a n c e i n t h e t h i n b o u n d a r y - l a y e r f l o w r e g i m e a s s u m i n g\nconditions of chemical equilibrium.

The relative importance\nof the 02\' and NOt ions in\nthe shock layer is shown to be influenced by the neutral chemistry reaction.\nSeveral investigatorsl1-l3 have studied this reaction at low temperat u r e s in shock-tube environments. However, there\nstill e x i s t l a r g e u n c e r tainties in the reaction rate coefficients for\nunknown reasons. Brokaw14 has\nsuggested that the difficulty associated with these previous measurements\nis\nthe presence of hydrogenous impurities. To date, the difficulty has not been\nsatisfactorily resolved.\nTwo additional reactions of i m p o r t a n c e i n t h e p l a s m a l a y e r a r e ( 1 )\nk l NO t CO and ( 2 ) 0 t N2 &NO\nt N\nThe rate coefficient\nfo reaction (2) has recently been measured15 in a shock-tube environment\nand is known to within a factor of 2 3 f o r a t e m p e r a t u r e r a n g e of 2000 to\n5000\xc2\xb0K.

If these influences happen to be additive, then\nit\nwould be possible to realize much higher electron-density values than those\npresented in the remainder of this work.\nA-4\n\n3.2\n\nCollision-Frequency and Electron-Density Distributions\nin Stagnation-Region Plasma\n\nThe collision-frequency and electron-density distributions in the\nstagnation region plasma were calculated for many points along each trajectory using the inviscid, nonequilibrium-flow analysis and the viscous shocklayer, nonequilibriun-flow analysis. The electron-neutral momentumtransfercrosssectionsforthespecies\n0 2 , COand\nC02 havebeenexperimentall determined over the electron energy range\nof interest by Hake and\nP h e l p s . y6 C r o s s s e c t i o n s f o r t h e r e m a i n i n g s p e c i e s a r e w e l l\nknown f r o m\nprevious earth-entry studies. For\nall of the trajectory points considered,\nthe electron-ion collision frequency w a s always small compared with the\nelectron-neutral collision frequency.\nF i g u r e 4 p r e s e n t s a comparison of collision-frequency distributions\ncalculated using, the inviscid and merged-layer analyses for the max\nH p,\nt r a j e c t o r y at an altitude of 285,000 f t and a velocity of 1 4 , 5 0 0 f t / s e c\nFrom\nF i g . 1 it is seen that at t h i s t r a j e c t o r y p o i n t t h e m e r g e d - l a y e r a n a l y s i s\nwould be the correct one to use. Because\nof the lower w a l l t e m p e r a t u r e\nassociated with the merged-layer solution, the predicted collision frequency\nnear the w a l l is somewhat higher than it i s for the inviscid solution. Nearer\nthe shock the results of the two solutions a r e in good agreement as to the\nmagnitude of the collision frequency. This lower\nwall temperature results\nin a higher g a s density near the wall with a corresponding thinning of the\nshock-layer thickness a s c a n b e s e e n f r o m F i g . 4 .\n\n.\n\nThe corresponding electron-density profiles for this trajectory point\na r e given in Fig. 5 .

Near the body, the influence of the low w a l l temperature on the profile can be observed. Because\ndiffusion is allowed towards both the body and the shock, the number density\nis fairly uniform over most of the shock l a y e r .\nF i g u r e s 6 and 7 p r e s e n t a s i m i l a r c o m p a r i s o n of collision frequency\nand electron density for an altitude\nof 2 15,000 f t at 14,800 f t / s e c f o r t h e\nmax p,\ntrajectory.From\nF i g . 1,itcanbeseenthatforthistrajectory\npoint the viscous shock-layer analysis should be valid. Figure\n6 illustrates\na significant difference between the collision-frequency distributions with the\nprediction of the merged-layer solution being almost\na factor of 10 l e s s t h a n\nthat of the inviscid solution near the shock. The electron-density profiles\npresented in Fig. 7 i l l u s t r a t e a significant viscous effect. The peak electron\ndensity predicted by the merged-layer analysis is in excess of lo3 t i m e s\nl e s s t h a n t h a t of the inviscid-flow prediction.\n\n3 . 3 Predicted Peak Electron Densities\nfor Various Atmosphere-Trajectories\nInviscid and merged-layer nonequilibrium flow calculations were performed several\nfor\npoints\nalong min\nthe\np , , m e a n p , max p,\nand\n\nA -5\n\n-\n\nrnax H p , trajectories for an entry angle of 17\xe2\x80\x99 using an atmosphere composed of 99% C 0 2 t 170 N 2 . These calculations were repeated for the\nmaxpes and max Hp,, trajectories using an atmosphere composed\nof\n7570 C 0 2 t 2070 A r t 570 N 2 .\nFigures 8 and 9 present the inviscid and merged-layer predictions of\nthe peak electron densities as\na function of altitude for the minp\nand\nmean p trajectoriesforanatmospherecomposed\nof 9970 C 0 2 4 170 N 2 .\nReferring to Fig. 1,\nit can be seen that for the min\np,\ntrajectory at altitudes less than 120,000 f t the thin-boundary layer-inviscid flow analysis is\nvalid and above approximately 215,000 f t the merged layer analysis is valid.\nBetween 120,000 f t and 215,000 ft altitude the inviscid prediction represents\nan upper bound and the merged-layer prediction represents a lower bound to\nthe electron density. Similarly, for the mean\np trajectory the boundarylayer regime is below 115,000 f t and the merged-layer regime is above\napproximately 195 ,000 ft. For intermediate altitudes the results can\nbe used\nin the manner described earlier in this paragraph.\nThe influence of ablation products on the peak electron densities has\nnot been included in\nthese results. Because\nof this, the altitudes of p r e 4,-),,\na r e noted on F i g s . 8- 11. F o r the altitudes\ndictedl 4 c)max and 0.5\na t which 0.5 4c)max occurs, the number density calculated assuming only\natmospheric ionization can be seen to be decreasing. It is therefore clear\nthat before these results can be used to predict the communications blackout\nboundaries, the additional electron production a s a result of impurity ionization must be assessed.\nFigures 10 and 11 present the inviscid-flow and merged-layer flow\npredictions of peak electron density for the max P , and max H p , , trajec~\ntories using\nthe\n99% C 0 2 t 1% N 2 andthe 7570 C 0 2 t 2070 A r t 5% N2\natmospheres. Again from F i g . 1,forthe\nm a x ~ trajectory, the boundary, ~\nlayer analysis is valid at altitudes below approximately 115,000 f t and the\nmerged-layer analysis is valid above approximately 175,000 ft. The corresponding altitudes for the max\nHP,~\ntrajectory are approximately 160,000 ft\nand approximately 250,000 ft. Between these altitude ranges, the electron\ndensity lies between the upper limit of the inviscid-flow prediction and the\nlower limit of the merged-layer prediction.\nFigures 10 and 11 illustrate that adding 2070 A r and an additional\nN 2 to the atmospheric composition results in an increase in the predicted\npeak number density of a factor of approximately 10 near the maximum\nnumber-density region. Because\nof the limited time available, it was not\npossible to separate the relative influences of the Argon and the additional\nnitrogen.\n\n3.4 Estimated Plane-Wave Transmission Coefficient\nThe collision-frequency and electron-density distributions described\nin Section 3.2 have been used to calculate17 the plane-wave transmission coefficient as a function of altitude for the max p, s and max Hp, s\n\nA-6\n\n470\n\nI\n\ntrajectories Using the 7570 G o 2 + 2 w 0 A r + 5% N 2 atmosphere.Theresults of these calculations are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 for frequencies\nranging from 100 Mc to 3000 Mc. F o r the purposes of this calculation, the\ngradients of collision frequency and electron density in the directioa of propagation were accounted for by assuming the plasma layer to be composed of\nmany smaller homogeneous slabs. However, the calculation technique\nis r e stricted in that it requires that these gradients normal to the direction of\nelectromagnetic propagation be negligible.\nThe predictions of transmission coefficient vs. altitude obtained using\nthe inviscid, nonequilibrium-flow solutions and the viscous, nonequilibriumflow solutions a r e both included on Figs.\n12 and 13. In Section 3 . 3 the altitude range over which each of these flow-field prediction techniques should\nbe valid is described. In the intermediate altitude range, it is necessary to\ninterpolate between the upper limit of the inviscid-flow and the lower limit of\nthe viscous-flow predictions.\n4 . DOWN-STREAMVISCOUS SHOCK-LAYER SOLUTIONS\nAND ABLATION-PRODUCT IONIZATION\n4 . 1 Downstream Viscous Shock-Layer Solutions\n\nThroughout this appendix it has been emphasized that\nto date we have\nstudied the stagnation-region plasma. The downstream\nflow field is also important since the radar altimeter is located on the forebody away from the\nstagnation region and because we a r e i n t e r e s t e d in the number density and\ncollision frequency i n the afterbody region.\nThe existing analysis8 was applied for the Viking vehicle i n the\nspherical portion and the results are shown in F i g . 14 in t e r m s of the electron-density profiles in the viscous shock layer. It may\nbe seen that the\npeak electron-number density is greatest in the stagnation region and gradually decreases in the downstream region due to expansion of the flow. F o r\na very blunt body such as the Viking vehicle, the spherical portion ends at\n8 = 20 degrees from the stagnation line (e = 0) and the results show a d e c r e a s e\nin the maximum electron density level from the stagnation value by a factor\nof about two for the given Martian atmosphere\n(57\xe2\x80\x990 N 2 , 20% A r , 75% C 0 2 ) .\nBeyond the nose region, the body shape changes from a spherical to a\nconical section and modification of the presently available program is required to account for the change in the\nbody curvature. Although there seems\nto be no major conceptual difficulty in adapting the program, lack of sufficient time has precluded us from implementing this modification.\n4.2\n\nAblation-ProductIonization\n\nIn a hypersonic, viscous shock-layer\n\nflow, the ablation species\nA -7\n\nreleased into the flow a r e not confined to a thin layer near the body, but a r e\ndiffused all-the way to the shock wave.\nOf these "contaminant" species\nsome will undergo ionization, generating\nnew electrons in addition to those\nelectrons already in the flow field. A t high altitudes, conditions of chemical\nnonequilibrium will prevail so that an analysis of nonequilibrium ionization\nol the contaminant species should be performed. This had been previously\ndone by Kang9 and applied to the Apollo vehicle. The analysis, howevero\nhas not been applied for the Viking c a s e due to lack of sufficient time required to modify the analysis. Hence, the results performed for an\nair flow\nover the Apollo vehicle w i l l be presented here, in order to demonstrate\nqualitatively the importance of the ablation effects.\nT h e r e s u l t s a r e shown in F i g . 15 i n t e r m s of the distributions of\nelectron-number densities across the viscous shock layer for an Apollo\nN is devehicle in the Earth atmosphere for the ablation case. The term\nfined to be the ratio\nof the ablation mass flux\n( p b vb) to the free-stream\nm a s s flux ( poo U ) , where p denotesmassdensity,\n,\nV and U the\nvelocities, and thesubscripts\nb and 00 thebody-surfaceconditionandthe\nN signifiestheperambientcondition,respectively.Physically,theterm\ncent of ablated mass in the flow compared to the ambient mass flux. This\nfigure illustrates the electron-density profiles for the case\nof N = 0 . 1 containing 100 ppm of sodium, and the case\nof N = 0.1 containing 1000pprn of\nsodium. For comparison, the case\nof pure air (no ablation) is also included\nin the figure.\nIt ma be\nseen that ablation results in the thickening\nof the\nviscous shock layer and in the i n c r e a s e -in the number of electrons in the\nflow due to the nonequilibrium sodium ionization. It may\nbe seen further\nthat, for 1000 ppm of sodium species ablated, the peak electron number density increased by m o r e than an order of magnitude for air. Although i t is\nnot possible to assess quantitatively or extrapolate the increase in the number of electrons due to ablation in the Martian atmosphere based\non the r e sults obtained for air, it nevertheless seems clear that the effects\nof\nablation and the nonequilibrium ionization of the alkali metals such as sodium\non the viscous f l o w field w i l l be sizable in terms of the shock-layer thickn e s s and the electron-number densities around the Viking vehicle during entry into the Martian atmosphere.\n\nY\n\n5\n\ne\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBefore estimates of the blackout boundaries for the Viking Marsentry trajectories can be obtained from the material presented herein, there\nare several remaining problem areas that must be investigated. These\np r o b l e m s a r e a s follows:\n( 1 ) To improve our knowledge of reaction rate coefficients for the\nCO2 atmosphere. Section 3.1 contains\na discussion of the current rate-\n\nccefficient information. It is important\nto recall that the nonequilibriumflow electron-density predictions are only as accurate as the reaction rate\ncoefficients.\n\nA-8\n\n(2) Extend the existing nose-region viscous-flow solution with nonequilibrium chemistry to the downstream region as discussed in Section 4.1.\n( 3 ) .
