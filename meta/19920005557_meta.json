Supporting this effort are activities to investigate the effects of the space environment, and particularly ionizing radiation, on microcircuits and to develop a space qualification methodology. Another aspect of the program emphasizes innovative applications of custom microcircuit technology to image and signal processing and communications.", "title": "Custom microcircuits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T17:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920005557, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920005557, "id": "d3b51ca595f041209b01bc72cc7fa138", "publicationName": "Center for Space Microelectronics Technology", "publicationDate": "1991-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
