Various figures of merit were used to examine constellation configurations in order to optimize the performance of Mars Network. Plots were also obtained in order to make a clear comparison of the various figures of merit. In the following analysis, six figures of merit were used in the comparison (average time to achieve a 1 meter fix, maximum time to achieve a 1 meter fix, maximum wait time between satellite sightings, percent of time a satellite is in view, percent of cases to achieve a 1 meter fix in 10 minutes, and percent of cases to achieve a 1 meter fix in 1 hour). For the communication figures of merit (maximum wait time between satellite sightings and percent of time a satellite is in view), an initial run over a period of 10 days was used to produce the data. For the remaining figures of merit, the simulation was first restarted at least 100 times over a period of 1000 Earth days. Each time the simulation was continued until a 1 meter fix was achieved at all stations. The ground station grid was spaced 20 deg in longitude and 5 deg in latitude. In order to obtain the following graphs the values were first averaged over longitude and then an average of the positive and negative latitude values was made (i.e., -90 deg lat and 90 deg lat were averaged). In each case, the resulting figures of merit are shown. For some cases, the difference between the given case and the 'Eagles 2 Satellites' case is also given.", "title": "Mars Constellation Design", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020017761, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020017761, "id": "647c740547aa40ee97e84c4c7a22f1bd", "publicationDate": "2001-05-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020017761.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020017761/downloads/20020017761.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020017761/downloads/20020017761.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020017761/downloads/20020017761.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
