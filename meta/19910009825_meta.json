The facility was designed and built for the calibration and testing of the new generation large aperture long wave infrared (LWIR) sensors, seekers, and related technologies. Capability exists to perform both radiometric and goniometric calibrations of large infrared sensors under simulated environmental operating conditions. The system is presently configured for endoatmospheric calibrations with a uniform background field which can be set to simulate the expected mission background levels. During calibration, the sensor under test is also exposed to expected mission temperatures and pressures within the test chamber. Capability exists to convert the facility for exoatmospheric testing. The configuration of the system is described along with hardware elements and changes made to date are addressed.", "title": "Boeing infrared sensor (BIRS) calibration facility", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910009825, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hazen, John D."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace and Electronics Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA., United States"}}, "id": "c961bdc921264be5baa79355f9396b38"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910009825, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scorsone, L.
