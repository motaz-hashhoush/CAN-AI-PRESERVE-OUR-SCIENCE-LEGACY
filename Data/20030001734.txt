b"AIRBORNE IMAGERY\nAt left below is a geologic map of an area known\nas the Cuprite mining district near Tonopah, Nevada.\nPrepared as an aid to locating mineral deposits, this\nmap was produced from data acquired in a number\nof field explorations, a tedious and time-consuming\nprocess. At right is an image of the same area taken\nby an Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) developed\nfor NASA by Daedalus Enterprises Inc., Ann Arbor,\nMichigan; the ATM data was computer processed-by\nGeospectra Corporation, also of Ann Arbor-to reveal\nthe maximum color differences among the various rock\ntypes in the area. To the skilled interpreter, the colored\nimage represents a geologic map bearing close\nsimilarity to the map produced by ground\ninvestigation-but the data was acquired on a single\nflight of a Gates Learjet. Airborne photographic and\nimaging systems have been used for some time in\ngeological work, but the Daedalus AADS1268 ATM and\na related system, the AADS 1285 Thermal Infrared\nMultispectral Scanner (TIMS), offer expanded\ncapabilities for timely, accurate and cost-effective\nidentification of areas with prospecting potential.\nDaedalus' ATM was developed for Ames Research\nCenter, which is using it in agricultural studies and\n\nin validations of data from the Landsat 4 Thematic\nMapper (TM) that went into service last year; from\n40,000 feet, the airborne system provides resolutions\napproximately the same as those of the TM at altitudes\nabove 400 miles. Daedalus developed the TlMS for\nNASA's National Space Technology Laboratories; Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory is using TlMS data in studies of\ndiscrimination of quartz-bearing rock types by airborne\nscanning. Both systems developed for NASA are now\nbeing offered commercially by Daedalus Enterprises for\nsale, lease or for data collection services. One data\ncollection program involved use of the ATM to cover\nmore than 35,000 square miles of the western United\nStates. Sponsored by 13 energy and mining companies,\nit provided data used to map exposures of clay\nminerals and to segregate iron oxides; such exposures\nare associated with deposits of gold, silver, uranium,\ncopper, lead and zinc.\n\nF\n\nI\n\n"
