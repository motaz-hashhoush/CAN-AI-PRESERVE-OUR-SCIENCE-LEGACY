This can be achieved by maintaining an effective, balances effort in basic, applied, and demonstration prototype communications technology through work in theory, experimentation, and components. The program consists of three major research and development discipline areas which are: microwave and millimeter wave tube components; solid state monolithic integrated circuit; and free space laser communications components and devices. The research ranges from basic research in surface physics (to study the mechanisms of surface degradation from under high temperature and voltage operating conditions which impacts cathode tube reliability and lifetime) to generic research on the dynamics of electron beams and circuits (for exploitation in various micro- and millimeter wave tube devices). Work is also performed on advanced III-V semiconductor materials and devices for use in monolithic integrated analog circuits (used in adaptive, programmable phased arrays for microwave antenna feeds and receivers) - on the use of electromagnetic theory in antennas and on technology necessary for eventual employment of lasers for free space communications for future low earth, geostationary, and deep space missions requiring high data rates with corresponding directivity and reliability.", "title": "Communications technology", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T04:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890009028, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sokoloski, Martin M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "29e0ac71d6544e0f895d2db0abba0106"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890009028, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890009028, "id": "61ff24dd50bd40d596dc1af9ff9366b4", "publicationName": "NASA Information Sciences and Human Factors Program", "publicationDate": "1988-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
