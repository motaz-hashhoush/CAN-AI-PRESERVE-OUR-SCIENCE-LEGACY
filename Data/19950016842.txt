Also on the eighth day, commands\nto the HST were\nunable to move the SA primary deployment\nmechanisms,\nresulting\nin a decision to\nhave the EVA crewmembers\nmanually deploy the SA booms during that day\'s EVA.\nDuring this fifth and final EVA, the crewmembers\nperformed the replacement\nof the\nSADE 1, manually deployed the SA booms, installed the GHRS redundancy\nkit, and\ninstalled the new covers on both MSSs. Commands\nsent to the HST successfully\nunfurled both SAs. Data problems encountered\nfollowing\nthe EVA were eventually\nattributed to a malfunctioning\nchannel in one of the HST\'s data interface units (DIUs).\nWhen the DIU was switched to an alternate channel, it functioned properly.\nThe HST was redeployed\nThe crew was given\n\non flight day 9.\n\na day off on flight day 10.\n\nOn flight day 11, the Commander\nand Pilot practiced Orbiter approaches\nlandings using the portable\nin-flight landing operations\ntrainer (PILOT).\nDuring the twelfth flight day the Endeavour landed\napproximately\n11:25 PM CST on December 12, 1994.\n\nat Kennedy\n\nand\n\nSpace Center\n\nat\n\nDuring the mission the replacement\nhardware was shown to be electrically\nfunctional.\nThe new optical instruments\nwere later demonstrated\nto have corrected\nthe spherical\naberration present when the telescope was placed into orbit in April\n1990. These new instruments\nimproved the telescope\'s optical performance\nto levels\nexpected from the original design.\nKey to the success of the HST SM-1 was the fact that the HST had been designed\nand built to be maintained\nby astronauts\nduring EVA. Astronauts and other EVA\nexperts were very heavily involved in the HST design process. While budget limitations during the building of the HST prevented the incorporation\nof EVA-friendly\nfeatures into every component,\nnearly all the components\nwere made at least EVAcompatible,\nmeaning that even though special tools or procedures\nwould still have to\nbe developed\nto work on the component,\nit is accessible and replaceable\nby an\nastronaut\nwearing a pressurized\nextravehicular\nmobility unit (EMU).\nThe success\n\nof this mission\n\ncame also as a result of total commitment\n\nto the\n\nmission by NASA and its contractor\nteam. The fact that the HST was launched\ncontaining\na flawed mirror, the fact that a large number of components\nwere in need\n\n7\'\n\n2\n\n[\n\nExecutive\n\nSummau_lv\n\nof servicing or replacement,\nand the fact that not all of these components\nwere EVAfriendly, combined\nto make this mission probably the most complex Shuttle mission\nflown to date. Multiple NASA centers and numerous contractors\nwere involved in\nthe design, development\nand execution of the telescope and EVA hardware and the\nformulation\nof the procedures\nfor the servicing mission.\nNASA was willing to devote\nthe necessary resources to ensure adequate high-fidelity\ntraining for the flight crew\nand ground support personnel.\nAlthough the ratio of EVA training hours to in-flight\nEVA hours was not greater than that of some earlier Shuttle EVA missions, and\nbecause the five EVAs of HST SM-1 were the most ever conducted\nduring a mission,\nthe total EVA training load was also the greatest of any Shuttle mission to date. The\nquality of training was also higher than that for previous missions because of\nincreased emphasis\non end-to-end\nEVA and remote manipulator\nsystem (RMS)\ntraining and contingency\nprocedures\ntraining.\nA large number of simulations\nwere\nconducted\nfor this mission, including\ninternal simulations\nheld at Goddard Space\nFlight Center (GSFC), Johnson Space Center (JSC), and Marshall Space Flight Center\n(MSFC) and JISs involving\nthe entire mission team. Every EVA was simulated\nwith\nEVA crewmembers\nin underwater\ntraining facilities during JISs.\nBecause of the complexity\nof the mission and of its importance\nto NASA and to\nthe public, NASA management\ntook extraordinary\nsteps to ensure its success.\nA\nnumber of independent\nreview groups, both inside and external to NASA, were\nestablished\nto assess the management,\ndesign, planning and preparation for the\nmission.\nThese groups produced a large number of recommendations,\nmost of which\nare discussed in detail in this report. While some might argue that the review groups\nmade many recommendations\nthat would have been accomplished\nanyway\nin the\nnormal course of mission activities, the Mission Director believes that the review\ngroups made key and timely contributions\nin a number of areas.\nRecommendations\nto evaluate STS-61 hardware and EVA procedures\non\nprevious missions led to the realization that the planned Orbiter attitude for some of\nthe EVA tasks would result in an environment\ntoo cold for the EVA astronauts.\nIf\nthis discovery had occurred during STS-61, significant\nservicing mission could have occurred.\n\nnegative\n\nimpact\n\nto the\n\nA review group\'s recommendation\nto upgrade the breathing system and remote\nmanipulator\nsystem (RMS) simulator in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS) at\nMSFC helped to bring about those improvements.\nAlthough\nthere was a significant\ndelay in the implementation\nof these recommendations,\nboth were completed\nin time\nto be used for final end-to-end training for the mission.\nThis upgraded capability\nfor\nintegrated EVA and RMS training was key to the success of the mission.\nThe recommendation\nto assign and train\nin the designation\nof the STS-61 EVA Capsule\nbackup EVA crewmember.\nThis assignment\nCapcom\'s familiarity with the EVA tasks and\n\n3\n\na backup\ncrew for the mission resulted\nCommunicator\n(Capcom)\nto also be the\nproved to be beneficial\nin increasing\nthe\nin allowing greater flexibility in the\n\nExecueive\nSum,--, T\n\nI\n\nscheduling\nof crew training events. The Mission Director recommends\nthat for\nfuture critical EVA missions,\nNASA consider the assigmnent\nof a crewmember\nserve as both EVA Capcom and backup EVA crewmember.\n\nto\n\nReview group recommendations\nto perform JISs for each EVA with crewmembers in underwater\ntraining facilities and with participation\nof mission management\nprovided the opportunity\nto refine normal procedures\nand mission team coordination and to train for real-time\ncontingency\noperations that were stressed during the\nsimulations.\nA review group recommended\nthat as many as possible of the commands\nto the\nHST be sent from within the Orbiter instead of from the ground to prevent delays of\nEVA activities caused by waiting for the ground commands.\nPartly as a result of\npractice that occurred during the JISs, HST commanding\nthat was performed during\nthe STS-61 EVAs was well coordinated\nand timely. The Mission\nDirector recommends that the balance of on-board versus ground commanding\nof payloads\ncontinue\nto be given high priority during mission planning.\nThe amount of\ncommands\nthat can be sent by the flight crew should be maximized\nto the extent\npractical, and the commanding\nprotocols should be thoroughly\nrehearsed\nand\nevaluated\nduring JISs.\nAn EVA assessment\ngroup\'s recommendation\nto move EVA tools from the\npayload bay into the Orbiter cabin resulted in the saving of valuable EVA time.\nOn the basis of the positive\nresults from independent\nreviews, the Mission\nDirector recommends\nthat the use of independent\npeer review be continued\nfor\ncritical missions.\nA multidisciplinary\nteam having relevant expertise should\nbe\nestablished\nto perform a thorough and comprehensive\nindependent\nassessment\nof\nflight readiness.\nThe team activities should be coordinated\nwith standard mission\nmilestones\nto impart minimal\ninterference\nto mission\npreparation\nactivities.\nThe use of a single team as mentioned\nabove is the preferred form of peer\nreview, but if reviews are to performed\nby multiple\nindependent\norganizations,\ntheir activities should\nbe consolidated\nto the maximum\nextent possible\nand\nperformed\nin coordination\nwith established\nprogram and mission milestones\nto\nminimize\ndupUcation\nof effort by those preparing for the mission.\nReviewing\norganizations\nshould be sensitive\nto their potential\nfor interfering\nwith mission\npreparation\nactivities.\nA recommendation\nthat NASA establish a mission manager for this mission\nresulted in the appointment\nby the NASA Associate Administrator\nfor Space Flight of\nMr. Randy H. Brinldey as the STS-61 Mission Director on December 15, 1992. In this\nposition, Mr. Brinkley was tasked "to coordinate the efforts of the team working to\nsafely and successfully\naccomplish\nthe HST Servicing Mission." Mr. Brinkley chaired\nthe Mission Coordination\nTeam, which was established\nto coordinate Level I\n\n4\n\nExecutive\n\nSummary\n\nactivities and to oversee Level II and m management\nactivities during mission\npreparation.\nThe team included management\nrepresentatives\nof the Space Shuttle\nand HST Program offices. The Mission Director served to coordinate and expedite\nboth the Space Shuttle and HST Programs\' responses to the recommendations.\nThe\nMission Director also served to help focus and consolidate\nthe efforts of the review\ngroups to minimize impacts to mission preparation\nactivities.\nThe Mission Director\nalso coordinated\ncommunication\nwith and external inquiries from the General\nAccounting\nOffice (GAO) and Congressional\nstaff members.\nThe STS-61\n\nMission\n\nappointing\nmission\nNASA Administrator.\nand oversight\nof the\nand accomplishment\nproper coordination\ngram managers\nand\nsafe and successful\n\nDirector\n\nrecommends\n\nthat NASA\n\ncontinue\n\nthe practice\n\nof\n\ndirectom for highly complex space flights as designated\nby the\nA mission\ndirector should provide management\ndirection\nintegration,\nflight preparation,\nand mission training\nprocesses\nof the mission.\nA mission director should be responsible\nfor\namong the various NASA offices, NASA centers, NASA propersonnel\nexternal to NASA who have a responsibility\nfor the\nexecution\nof the mission.\nA mission director should be respon-\n\nsible for ensuring\ncompliance\nwith all safety and mission\nassurance requirements\nand for resolution\nof key issues involving\nany aspect ofthe mission.\nA mission\ndirector should also co-chair the Mission Management\nTeam. A mission director\nshould provide concurrence\nin the mission\'s\ngoals, objectives,\npriorities,\nand\npolicies, in crew selection,\nin cargo mix, in the determination\nof flight readiness\nof\nall disciplines\nparticipating\nin the mission and of the flight hardware, and in the\ndate and time of launch.\nAlso in response to the recommendation\nto establish a mission manager, the\nSpace Shuttle Program\nnamed Mr. Hal Lambert as Mission Manager\nfor $IS-61 on\nFebruary 18, 1993. In this position, Mr. Lambert was in charge of a Level In HST\nSM-1 Management\nTeam. The team was "established\nto provide management\noverview and resolution of issues associated\nwith the mission.\nThis team [was]\nresponsible\nfor coordinating\nthe integration\nactivities between\nGSFC, JSC, and KSC\n[Kennedy Space Center], maintaining\noverall program schedules, ensuring mission\ncapabilities\nand mission priorities\n[were] compatible and directing the activities in\nsupport of this mission as necessary to ensure mission success." The team was "not\nintended to replace the existing management\nstructure, but to facilitate problem\nresolution and increase the mission visibility throughout\nthe existing system. The\nHST SM-1 Management\nTeam [was to] work with the Mission Director to keep him\ninformed of the status and progress\nof lIST repair preparation."\nFollowing STS-61,\nthe Space Shuttle Program implemented\nthe practice of assigning mission managers\nwithin the Integration and Operations\nOffice for each Shuttle mission.\nRecommendations\nfrom several reviews focused on the great need to present to\nthe public the proper perspective\nof the mission.\nNASA public affairs activities for\nSTS-61, while extensive, were not well coordinated\namong the significant mission\nparticipants.\n\nThe Mission\n\nDirector\n\nrecommends\n\n5\n\nthat for missions\n\nhaving\n\nhigh\n\ns\n\n[_-cutive Summa_\n\nI\n\npublic interest, a well-coordinated\nstrategic plan for public affairs be implemented\nand be under the control of a single NASA office. The plan should include the\npublication\nof a dear set of mission success criteria, and a plan of action to be\nfollowed\nif the mission were not a success,\nRecommendations\nto take extraordinary\nsteps to ensure that the mission\npayload hardware would be protected from contamination\nduring preflight processing resulted in the implementation\nof a special contamination\ncontrol plan at KS(=.\nHowever,\nin spite of the extra precautions\ntaken as a result of this plan, windblown\nsand and debris entered the payload change-out\nroom while payload hardware was\nin the room. The Mission Director recommends\nthat for all missions\nhaving\npayloads\nsensitive\nto contamination,\nthere be in place at the launch site a comprehensive plan to protect the payloads from all sources of contamination,\nincluding\nhuman-generated\nand natural sources.\nThe Mission Director commends\nthe HST and Space Shuttle Programs for the\ncomplex communications\nand coordination\nefforts by the various NASA centers and\ncontractors and for their accomplishments\nin unifying the work of the varied disciplines. However,\nsome problems\ndid occur because of the lack of proper coordination. The most significant of these problems are summarized\nhere, with recommendations for future courses of action.\nGSFC tool coatings were designed on the basis of outdated Orbiter attitude\nprofiles.\nJSC and GSFC used different conventions\nfor numbering\nbits in their digital payload data processing\nschemes using the Shuttle general processing\ncomputer.\nThese kinds of problems might have been detected sooner, or even prevented\nif\ntechnical meetings had been more detailed, more frequent, and started earlier.\nIn a number of different instances both before and during the mission, mission\npersonnel\nmet with difficulty in transferring\ntechnical data from one location to\nanother.\nThe Mission Director recommends\nthat the use of electronic\ncommunications be maximized\nfor future missions,\nboth during mission preparation\nand\nduring the mission itself. Methods of transfer\nof verbal, data, graphical\nand\npictorial information\nshould be readily accessible\nby the entire mission team.\nThe Mission Director recommends\nthat a computerized\nsystem be developed\nto support decision making during EVA replanning,\nThe system should provide\nthe flight control team with access to EVA timelines,\nprocedures,\ndata for tools,\nhardware, and payload systems, photographs\nand engineering\ndrawings.\nAnother example of lack of coordination\nis that JSC and GSFC used different\nphilosophies\nin the development\nof EVA tool certification\nand verification\nrequirements. The Mission Director recommends\nthat NASA establish\na single set of\nrequirements\nfor EVA hardware.\nJSC\'s newly formed EVA and Crew Equipment\n\n6\n\n]\n\nExecutive Summm_ I\n\nProject Office is a start at accomplishing\nauthority to control all EVA hardware.\n\nthis goal,\n\nbut the office\n\nmust be given\n\nthe\n\nEarlier designation\nand participation\nof the EVA crew would have resulted in\nmore crew involvement\nin the design of EVA tasks, especially the coprocessor\nand\nSADE tasks, resulting in easier EVA operations.\nThe Mission Director recommends\nthat complex Shuttle missions\nbe performed\nusing an extended\nflight production\ntemplate, with milestones,\nincluding\nthe designation\nof key crewmembers,\noccurring earlier than for standard missions.\nFor STS-61, mission support personnel who were to support night shifts and\nespecially\nthe EVAs were generally given reduced preflight work schedules immediately before the mission to allow them to voluntarily\nadjust their sleep schedules.\nHowever, there was not a formal team-wide\nplan to ensure that this happened for all\ncritical personnel.\nThe Mission Director recommends\nthat for critical missions\nthat\ninclude crew operations\n(especially\nEVAs) occurring during normal sleep hours, a\nformal plan be implemented\nto facilitate the necessary sleep shifting of the\nmission support personnel\n(including\nmanagement)\nbefore launch.\nDuring the preparation for this mission there was discussion\nof the possibility\nof\nan astronaut\'s\nperforming\nan EVA on each of two consecutive\ndays. This would be a\nviolation of one of the crew constraints\ncontained\nin Appendix K of the Space Shuttle\nCrew Procedures Management\nPlan. This constraint could be waived during a\nmission, but there was a confusion\nover whether a flight director alone or only the\nMission Management\nTeam (MMT) had the authority to waive it. The Mission\nDirector recommends\nthat the authority to waive Appendix\nK constraints\nbe\nclearly defined.\nAnother area in need of greater definition of roles and responsibilities\nis the\ntotal area of mission assurance.\nFor STS-61 there was no single person or organization actively working to coordinate the efforts to enforce compliance\nwith the various\nsets of safety requirements.\nThere was also no discernible overall risk management\nor mission assurance effort for the mission.\nThe Mission Director recommends\nthat\nfor each mission a single point of contact be designated\nwho\nble for all aspects of mission assurance and safety, including\noperational,\nand EVA safety.\nThe Mission\nthat is responsible\n\nis actively responsipayload, Orbiter,\n\nDirector also recommends\nthat NASA develop\na single\nfor all aspects of EVA safety and mission assurance.\n\nprocess\n\nTo provide a tool for the implementation\nand coordination\nof many of the\nabove recommendations,\nthe Mission Director recommends\nthe development\nof a\nmanagement\nplan for complex missions.\nIt should be developed\nearly in the\nmission planning\nflow and should be coordinated\namong the various elements\nof\nthe mission team.\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn December\n15, 1992, NASA\nAssociate\nMr. Randy H.

The report\nalso mentions that the limitation on the water depth to which a suited subject could\ndescend during a training run caused negative impacts on training.\nA Nitrox\n(oxygen-enriched\nair) breathing system would allow the subjects to achieve a greater\ndepth for a greater period of time, thereby allowing enhanced training.\nThe eventual\nincorporation\nof an upgraded RMS simulator and a Nitrox breathing system into the\nNBS in time to support only the October 1993 training runs is discussed below in\nconnection\nwith the recommendations\nfrom General Thomas Stafford\'s HST SM\nReview\n\nTeam\'s second\n\nmeeting,\n\nwhich occurred\n\nFebruary\n\n11-12, 1993.\n\nNumerous\nhardware and procedure changes were made as a result of these NBS\nruns. However, some conditions\nidentified as problems in the report were not\nresolved until very late in the mission flow. The report pointed out the lack of\nexisting capability\nto support end-to-end\ntimeline verification, but this capability\nwas\nnot realized until the October 1993 NBS runs, after the late installation\nof the new\nRMS and the Nitrox systems.\nThe report also stressed the need to finalize tool\nstowage and tool management.\nThe final tool stowage and tool management\nmajor\ndeterminations\nwere not made until late August 1993.\nAn assessment\nof the HST SM-1 extravehicular\nactivities (EVAs) was conducted\nby former astronaut\nDr. Joe Allen, who issued his report on July 17,1992.\nHe had\nbeen asked by the NASA Office of Space Science and Applications\nto assess the thencurrent EVA plan regarding strategy, timeline, and overall feasibility.\nAmong his\nrecommendations,\nhe cautioned\nNASA to guard against blindly pursuing accommodations for low probability contingencies\nat the expense of not being ready for the\nscheduled\nactivities and the more likely contingencies.\nHe also recommended\nthat the original large ORUs,\nbe used for reinstallation\npractice prior to the installation\nresult, partial reinsertion\nof the WF/PC I was performed\nhandling evaluation of the high speed photometer\n(HSP),\nCOSTAR. This type of on-orbit assessment\nproved to be\nthe mission.\n\nwhich were to be replaced,\nof the new ORUs. As a\nduring STS-61, as was a\nwhich was replaced by the\nof significant value during\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 1: EVA tasks requiring\nprecise handling\nof medium and large masses should be rehearsed\non orbit to the extent possible.\nTasks involving\nsmall, difficult-tohandle objects such as noncaptive\nscrews should also be practiced\norbit.\n\non\n\nDr. Allen also dted the need for the new ORUs to have high fidelity with respect\nto the old ORUs. This concern is basic to the design of any servicing EVA and is a\nhigh priority concern of the NASA EVA community.\nDuring the FIST SM-1 EVAs, no\n\n12\n\ni\n\nPre-Mission\n\nsignificant\nhardware fit problems\nwere encountered.\nHowever, a number\nous Space Shuttle EVAs have met with significant\ndifficulties\nin connecting\npieces of hardware because some "simple detail" was overlooked.\n\nEvents I\n\nof previtwo\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 2: Every effort should be\nmade to completely\nunderstand\nand to be able to duplicate on the\nground the configuration\nof hardware that is on orbit. Methods that\ncan be used to help achieve this capability\ninclude detailed records\n(including\nphoto documentation\nand accurate engineerin\n8 drawings,\nboth made of the as-deployed\nconfiguration),\nmolds of the interfaces,\naccurate tooling representing\nmating interfaces, etc. Such a\ncapability\nto duplicate on earth what exists in orbit should be\nconsidered\nan initial design requirement\nfor on-orbit hardware.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 3: The Space Station\nProgram should develop and maintain\na detailed three-dimensional\ncomputer model of the planned Station configuration\nsimilar to\nOrbiter models maintained\nin the PLAID and Integrated\nGraphics\nOperations\nand Analysis Laboratory (IGOAD systems at JSC The\nmodel should be made easy to update as design changes are made.\nshould\nbe accessible\nby the Space Station community\nof designers,\ncustomers,\nand operators.\nIt should be maintained\nas an as-built\nmodel of the station during and after the assembly phase.\n\nIt\n\nAnother area of concern for Dr. Allen, public affairs strategy, was shared by\nGeneral Thomas Stafford\'s HST SM Review Team and by the Group Task Force on\nSatellite Rescue and Repair. Dr. Allen was concerned\nabout the tendency of the\nnational press to ignore successful science, but focus a great deal of attention on\nfailures. To enhance that chances of mission success, and at the same time to\nstrengthen the public perception that NASA was doing all could to succeed, he\nrecommended\nthat NASA select experienced\nEVA crewmembers\nfor the mission, that\nample performance\nmargin be held in management\nreserve, that an Orbiter having a\nlong on-orbit stay capability be used, and that the EVA crew begin practicing the\nEVA procedures\nimmediately\nto increase proficiency,\nand, therefore, timeline\nmargin. He recommended\nthat the mission tasks be divided into a short list of tasks\nrequired to fix the mirror problem; another list of things to do, if time permits,\nto\nimprove the quality and quantity of new data by installing the new SAs; and yet\nanother lower priority\nlist,\nincludingthe tasksinvolvingRSUs, ECUs, and GHRS\nrepairkit,\njustin casetherewere any time left\nover. A significant\namount of attention\nwas given toformation of a public-affairs\nplan forHST SM-I. An HST public-affairs\nteam was formed in January 1992. Itcomprised representativesf theHST Program\no\nand Projectteams, theNASA\ncenters,\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the\nservicingmission contractors.\nThe team addressed therolesand responsibilities\nof\nthevariousorganizationsduring threephases of themission: the firstncluded the\ni\npre-missionperiod up to thirty\ndays beforelaunch,thesecond period was from\n\n13\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nthirty days before launch until landing, and the third phase was from landing until\ncompletion\nof systems and instrument verification.\nBiweekly planning sessions were\nheld. Photos, printed materials and videotapes\nwere provided to educators and to\nthe press. A writers\' workshop was conducted\nat the Space Telescope\nScience\nInstitute in Baltimore, Maryland, and at GSFC in June 1993. A mission operations\nmedia workshop was held at JSC in August 1993, in conjunction\nwith the second JIS,\nallowing the press to see the simulated mission activities.\nIntensive activities with\nthe press, immediately\nbefore and during the mission, ensured wide distribution\nof\ninformation.\nOne of the goals of these workshops\nand briefings was the\nindoctrination\nand education\nof the numerous reporters who were not accustomed\nto\ncovering NASA and mission operations.\nWhile the amount of work devoted to the public-affairs\nplan was extensive,\nit\nwas not coordinated\nas well as it should have been. The effort was led by personnel\nof the NASA Office of Space Science. It was not well coordinated\nwith the Office of\nSpace Flight or the Office of Policy Coordination\nand International\nRelations.\nThe\noverall public-affairs\nefforts functioned largely independently\nfrom mission\nmanagement,\ninstead of in support of it.\nIn an attempt to prevent the press from declaring the mission to be a failure if\nsome minor problem were to occur in orbit, NASA devised and presented to the\nmedia NASA\'s own mission success criteria. It clearly divided the EVA tasks into\nprimary tasks, which, if not accomplished,\nwould likely trigger a second servicing\nmission soon after the first one, and into secondary tasks, which, if not performed,\nwould not cause the mission to be considered\na failure. The primary tasks were\nconsidered\nto be those involving SAs, RSU 2, WF/PC, COSTAR, MSS 1, RSU/ECU\n3\nand SADE.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 4: For critical and highinterest NASA missions,\na thorough public-relations\nstrategic plan\nshould be implemented.\nIt should be well coordinated\namong all\ninvolved\nNASA offices.\nA single NASA office should be in charge\nof the implementation\nand updating of the plan at all NASA centers\nand any other key sites (vendor facilities, etc.). Mission success\ncriteria should be generated\nby mission management\nearly in\nmission plannin 8 and provided to the press by the public-affairs\norganization(s).\nA contingency\nplan of action in response\nto mission\n"failure" should be in place and announced\nbefore the mission.\nInformation\nat all levels of detail should\nbe readily available\nto the\npress. The mission\'s\nimportance\nshould not be overstated,\nand its\ncomplexity\nshould not be understated.\nThe JSC-based HST Review Team, chaired by Richard Fitts, released their\nfindings in the Hubble Space Telescooe (HST) Review Team Final Report. dated July\n\n14\n\n[\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents I\n\n17, 1992. The team had been chartered by the Shuttle Program Office in early June\n1992 to perform an independent,\nnon-advocate\nreview of FIST SM-1 to:\na.\n\nEnsure that adequate and documented\nplans were in place to evaluate the\noperations concepts and preliminary\ndesign to the point of readiness\nto\nenter the standard flow\nb. Ensure that Intelsat and Assembly of [Space] Station by EVA Methods\n(ASEM) lessons learned are applied\nc. Review the operating concepts and preliminary design to assess likelihood\nof mission success and recommend\nchanges as appropriate\nd. Determine if all tasks and timelines were workable and if adequate\nmargins\n\nexisted\n\nto ensure\n\nThe Fitts team recommended\n\nsuccess\nthat the mission\n\nbe constrained\n\nto an Orbiter\n\ncapable of extended duration missions, specifically one capable of a mission duration\nof eight planned days, one payload contingency\nday and two landing contingency\ndays. A similar recommendation\nwas made by the Stafford review team.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 5." Design all critical\nmissions\nso that maximum possible\nmission duration is incorporated\nat the inception\nof mission planning.\nEarly development\nof mission\nrequirements\nis necessary.\nIf needed to provide adequate\nmargins,\nan Orbiter with increased-duration\nmodifications\nshould be used for\nthe mission.\nThe Fitts team also recommended\nthat NASA avoid adding tasks that would\nrequire a fourth EVA. (At the time of this review, only three EVAs were planned.)\nAdditional\nHST problems would later cause an increase to five EVAs, but the\nextended-duration\ncapabilities\nof the Orbiter Endeavour accommodated\nthese five\nEVAs with adequate margin.\nThe Fitts report also recommended\nthat EVAs continue to be designed to be\naccomplished\nby two crewmembers\nin six hours or less, even though EVAs of seven\nor more hours are possible.\nThis has been the standard practice in EVA planning and\ncontinues\nto be a good way of ensuring timeline margin.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 6: To ensure\n\nthat\n\ntimeline\n\nmargin exists for each EVA day, continue to plan tasks for an EVA so\nthat they will take no longer than six hours to complete.\nAnother\n\nFitts team recommendation\n\nwas to determine\n\nwhether\n\ncertain\n\nhigh\n\npriority tasks should be three-crewmember\nEVAs. Plans were put into place to\nprovide three-crewmember\nwater training runs for the HST crew. However,\nafter\nanalyses of the HST EVA tasks indicated\nthat there would be little value added by a\nthird crewmember\nfor any of the tasks, it was decided to not conduct the training.\nIf\n\n15\n\nPre-Mluion\n\nEvents\n\nI\n\nthree-crewmember\ncapability is determined\nto be useful\nand Maintenance\nEVAs, either scheduled or contingency,\nsignificantly\nenhanced by hardware modifications.\n\nfor Space Station Assembly\nthose EVAs could be\n\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 7: Analyze future HST and\nSpace Station EVAs, both scheduled\nand contingency,\nto determine\nwhether three-czewmember\nEVA capability\nwould be desirable.\nIf\nso, modify the Orbiter air-locks, Shuttle extravehicular\nmobility\nunits (EMUs), and trainin s facilities to accommodate threecrewmember\nEVAs. The modifications\nshould include a third airlock-to-EMU\numbilical\nconnection,\nan EVA radio capable of threechannel operation,\nand other changes as appropriate.\nThe Fitts team also recommended\nhuman thermal\nvacuum testing (HIV_\nof the\nflight ORUs, using the assigned\nflight crew to the extent possible.\nDue to the large\nsize, the delicacy, and the cleanliness\nrequirements\nof the FIST ORUs, it was not\npractical to test them in the JSC HTVT runs. The ORUs were tested in non-human\nthermal vacuum tests. Many of the EVA tools were included in the HTVT. Each of\nthe four HST SM-1 EVA crewmembers\nhad been the test subject in a cold HTVT run\nwithin the two years before STS-61. Historically,\nHTVT has found problems with\nflight hardware (especially\ntool) designs that would not have otherwise been\ndiscovered\nbefore flight. The STS-61 HTVT did uncover some significant hardware\nproblems, which are discussed in connection\nwith the Brasher team presentation\non\nJuly 13,1993.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 8: Flight hardware\n(including\ntool) operations\nand interfaces\nshould be verified as early\nas possible\nbefore flight, in worst-case\nthermal\nvacuum conditions\nto\nthe extent possible.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 9:. EVA crewmembers\n\nscheduled\nto perform EVA tasks in severe thermal\nconditions\nshould\nexperience\nthose conditions\nin their flight EMUs (or equivalent)\nin\nvacuum chamber testing before their flight.\nThe Fitts team recommended\nthat NASA consider\nthe practicing of HST SM-1\ntasks on prior Shuttle flights, using full scale mockups of HST ORUs. It was decided\nthat there was not sufficient time before the mission to comply with this\nrecommendation.\nThe Fitts team also recommended\nthat potentially\ndifficult FiST tasks be\nrehearsed on missions before the HST SM-1. EVAs on $IS-57 and STS-51 were used\nto evaluate some of the tools, operations,\nand Orbiter attitudes planned for use on\nSTS-61 and to evaluate contamination\ngenerated by the crew. Insight was gained\nfrom these prior missions relating to the hardware and tasks. Far more important,\n\n16\n\nP_-Mis.ton\n\nEvents\n\nhowever, was what was learned about the Orbiter bottom-to-sun\norientation that had\nbeen planned for some of the HST tasks. During the STS-57 EVA, this attitude\nwas\nfound to be extremely cold and uncomfortable\nby the EVA crewmembers.\nThis result\nled the EVA and HST communities\nto pursue and develop a different attitude that\nkept the EVA astronauts\nat a comfortable\ntemperature\nlevel and still kept sunlight\naway from the light and heat-sensitive\nareas of the HST hardware.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 10:. NASA should expand\nits efforts to evaluate all new hardware, untried procedures,\nand\nthermal effects of new Orbiter attitudes,\nduring missions\nbefore the\nmissions\nfor which they are require&\nDevelopment\nof mission\nrequirements\nis needed as early as possible\nto allow time to support\nthese earlier missions.\nFor HST servicing\nmissions,\nthe HST Project\norganization\nshould develop the plan to exercise tasks and hardware\nas early as possible.\nThe Space Station Program should closely\nanalyze EVA thermal\nenvironments\n(especially\nthose which will\nexist while an Orbiter is attached to the Station) to ensure adequate\nEVA thermal\ncapability.\nAnother Fitts team recommendation\nwas to investigate\nmodifications\nto the\nORU interface designs to reduce sensitivity\nto clearance tolerances.\nFurther\nassessment\nsatisfied the team that the ORU designs were adequate,\nbut the concern\nremains valid for all EVA hardware interface designs.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 11: Designs of all hardware\nhaving the potential to be attached to or removed from other\nhardware during EVA should be thoroughly\nassessed for adequate\ntemperature\nand vacuum tolerances.\nPast flight experience\nand the\nknowledge\nbase of previous\nEVA designers\nshould\nbe used in this\nassessment.\nSee also Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. &\nThe Fitts team recommended\nthat NASA develop alternate techniques\nto\nperform ORU removal and installation\nthat do not rely on the use of the Orbiter\'s\nRMS. A significant amount of effort went into the development\nof and training for\nthe "non-RMS" procedures.\nIt was determined\nbefore the STS-61 mission that all the\nscheduled\nEVA tasks could be performed\nduring the mission, even without the use of\nthe RMS. Initial assessment\nof the crew\'s capability to manually capture and berth\nthe HST without\nthe RMS was considered,\nbut procedures\nand training for this\ncontingency\nwere not developed.\nEven though there has never been a complete loss\nof RMS operability in flight, it is important that this type of contingency\nplanning\nand training be maintained.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 12: Critical\n\nEVA tasks\n\nshould be designed\nso that they can be fully accomplished\nwere total loss of the use of the RMS.\n\n17\n\nif there\n\nI\n\n[Pre-,_ulon\nEver.\n\n,\n\n|\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 13: The Space Shuttle\nProgram should thoroughly\nassess the feasibility\nof manual capture\nand berthing of the HST. If determinedto\nbe feasible, such\nprocedures\nshould be developed\nand future HST servicing mission\nEVA crews should be trained to perform them.\nThe FiRS team recommended\nthat all critical design tasks be designed so that\nadequate crew restraints are available.\nExtensive testing at JSC\'s Weightless\nEnvironment\nTraining Facility (WETF) and Marshall Space Flight Center\'s (MSFC\'s)\nNBS resulted in verified proper placement of crew restraints.\nThe Fltts team also suggested\nthat NASA implement\nan expanded EVA\nintegrated\nsimulation template\nfor HST to allow both nominal and malfunction\nEVA\ntimelinestobe exercisedby the integrated\nteam. The Space ShuttleProgram (SSP),\nwith total support from the HST Project, performed\na JIS for each EVA day, during\nwhich the mission support team and, on at least two occasions, the SSP and HST\nmanagement\nwere extensively\nexposed to nominal and malfunction\nsituations.\nThis\ntraining was very effective in improving coordination\namong the different\norganizations\ninvolved in supporting\nthis mission.\nSee also Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNos. 21 through 24 and No. 72 and the discussions\npreceding\nthem.\nThe FiRs team also recommended\nthe establishment\nof a single point of contact\nfor EVA training hardware.\nIn a presentation\nto the Stafford review team on\nFebruary 12, 1993, Mr. Hal Lambert was named as the single point of contact for all\nEVA hardware.\nIn a March 29, 1993, memorandum,\nMr. Lambert designated\nMr. Jim\nJaax as the single point of contact. After Mr. Jaax was given a job reassignment,\nSteve\nPoulos was named to lead JSC\'s HST Tool Configuration\nControl Board (CCB) and to\nbe the single point of contact for EVA hardware beginning\nApril 12, 1993.

It also designated\nthe use of a fifth\ncryotank set in OV-105 for the mission.\nThis configuration\nwas expected to provide\ncapacity for four contingency\ndays. This mission duration represented\nan increase of\ntwo contingency\ndays over the previous plans (eight planned days plus two landing\ncontingency\ndays [8+2]) and an increase of one contingency\nday over the minimum\nduration recommended\nby the Fitts team (eight planned days plus one payload\ncontingency\nday, plus two landing contingency\ndays [8+1+2]). The IMAX cargo bay\ncamera (ICBC) and the in-cabin IMAX camera were also placed on the flight by this\ndirective.\nOn July 23,1992,\n\nthe first HST Flight Techniques\n\nPanel\n\nmeeting\n\nwas held.\n\nOn August 8,1992, the Program\nReview Team (PRT) for HST SM-1, chaired by\nDr. Michael Greenfield, released the report of its first of four reviews.\nThe PRT had\nbeen chartered by NASA Acting Deputy Administrator\non July 14, 1992, to provide\nthe program and project offices with high-level,\nindependent\nassessment\nof the\nthoroughness\nof the development,\nintegration,\nand verification\nprocesses and to\nensure that the multicenter\nHST servicing team was addressing problems satisfactorily. In this first report, the PRT recommended\nthat the HST Project Office develop\nspedfic decision-making\nguidelines\nand define the management\nprocess to be in\nplace during the mission, and that these guidelines\nand this process be exercised in\nJISs. Prior to the JISs, GSFC mission support personnel\nparticipated\nin a number of\nGSFC-only simulations,\ngiving them a considerable\namount of experience\nwith the\ndecision and information\nflow among their own organizations.\nThis early practice\ncontributed\nsignificantly\nto the efficiency of the more expansive JISs and should be\ncontinued\nfor future servidng\nmissions.\nIt should also be considered\nfor implementation within the Space Station Program.\nThe large number of JISs and the involvement of management\npersonnel in them resulted in a well prepared and coordinated\nteam. However, the training objectives of the JISs and the areas in need of improvement were not well documented\nin post-JIS reports to the partidpants.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 21: Continue the practice of\nhaving all mission support personnel,\nincluding\nmanagement\nand\nespecially\ncustomer management,\nparticipate\nin joint integrated\nsimulations\nOISs) for critical missions.\nJISs for scheduled\nEVAs\nshould be conducted\nwith EVA crewmembers\nin underwater\ntraining\nfacilities,\nunless facility or mock-up\nlimitations\nprevent the crew\nfrom performing\nrealistic activities.\n\n22\n\nI\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents J\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 22: For critical missions,\nthe Mission Operations\nDirectorate\nshould develop more dearly\ndefined and detailed training objectives\nfor the JISs for flight\ncontrollers,\nflight directors, and mission\nand customer management.\nPost-JIS reports should be distributed\nto the JIS participants\ndetailing\nthese objectives\nand how well they were achieved.\nCorrective\nactions should be assigned and lessons learned should be\nformulated\nand distributed.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 23: For HST servicing\nmissions,\ncontinue the practice of conducting\nHST Project internal\nsimulations.\nThey should be well structured and the results should\nbe well documented.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 24: The Space Station\nProgram should assess the benefits of performing\ninternal\nsimulations\nprior to the JISs for Space Station assembly.\nIf\ndetermined\nto be of value, they should be well structured, with clear\ntraining\nobjectives,\nand the results should be documented\nand\ndistributed\nto the partidpants.\nObjectives\nshould include\nthe\ndefinition\nand exercising\nof the relationship\nbetween\nthe Launch\nPackage Teams and the Flight Control Team during both nominal\nand contingency\noperations.\nThe PRT also recommended\nthat GSFC\'s servicing mission manager, the\nsystems management\nteam, and the supporting\nHST and Space Support Equipment\n(SSE) documentation\nall be located at JSC during the mission.\nIt is extremely\nimportant to have quick access to all technical information about a payload or other\nhardware to help support trouble-shooting\nefforts.

The hardware interface evaluations,\nverifications,\nand training\nconducted\nfor STS-61 using the HFMS were extremely\nvaluable.\nThe HST EVA\nServicing Mission Support Plan (EVASP [#8266, LMSC/P015686])\nwas developed\nto\ndefine testing activities using the HFMS, among other facilities.

The cabin air cleaner and a replacement\npayload bay\nliner were flown. A special bake-out of the EMU glove new thermal micrometeoroid\ngarments was performed\nto reduce the chance of HST contamination\nfrom outgassing of the materials during the EVAs. After the payload bay was contaminated\nby sand and debris at Launch Pad A, the payload bay received another special\ndeaning before the payload was installed.\n(The contamination\nof the payload bay\nand the Payload Change-out\nRoom [PCR] is discussed below in connection with Dr.\nGreenfield\'s July 28,1993, report [See Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 80.]\nand in the entry for October 30, 1993.) The Space Shuttle and payload were also\ntransported\nto Launch Pad B, from which they were launched.\nOn the basis of the\nresults of post-S\'IS-61 HST testing and operations,\nit appears that no significant\ncontamination\nwas introduced\ninto the telescope during the EVAs. However, some\nconcerns still exist about the chances of contaminating\nHST and other sensitive\npayloads during future missions.\nThe crew observed that it was common\nfor paint to\nchip from handrails when in contact with tether hooks. Pieces of multi-layer\ninsulation (MLD and labels were seen floating from their original locations.\nA GHRS\nsensor indicated a pressure change, and, therefore,\nthe introduction\nof gas into the\nHST after the firing of Orbiter reaction control jets.

It is essential that crew training be conducted\nwith accurate representations\nof the hardware that will be used in flight.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 33: For both the Space\nShuttle and the Space Station Programs, continue and expand the\nefforts to make trainin 8 mock-ups\nthat are dimensionally\nas flightlike as possible.\nBe alert to any differences\nbetween\ntraining and\nflight hardware and incorporate\nthe necessary precautions\ninto the\ntraining plan to avoid negative training.\nTake precautions\nto prevent\ndamage from handling,\nshipping,\netc., and deterioration\nfrom\ncorrosion, inadequate\nmaintenance,\netc.\n\n26\n\nlh_.Mission\n\nEvents ]\n\nThe PRT recommended\nthat materials and training should be provided to repair\nany multi-layer\ninsulation (MLD or tape that may be pulled loose during any\nscientific instrument\n(SI) removal.\nNo MLI problem was encountered\nduring the SI\noperations\nduring the mission.\nWith the increasing age of the HST MLI and the\nincreasing likelihood of micrometeoroid\nand debris impacts to the telescope,\nthere is\na significant chance that MLI repair capability will be needed during future HST\nservicing missions.\nThe potential need for such a repair capability\nwas emphasized\nduring the mission when it was visually discovered\nthat a particle had perforated\nthe\nHST high gain antenna dish.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 34: Develop\nand verify the\nadequacy of a multi-layer\ninsulation\n(MLI) repair kitfor future HST\nservicing missions.\nIt should enable EVA astronauts\nto repair the\nblack MLI inside the telescope cavities and the MLI external to the\ntelescope\nand to repair light leaks resulting\neither from micrometeoroid or other damage to the telescope\nor from poorly fitting doors or\n\nlight seals.\nThe PRT was interested in methods of verification\nthat light leaks were not\npresent in the body of the HST at the completion\nof the mission.\nIt was determined\nthat there was no practical, simple test that could be performed\nduring the STS-61\nmission.\nSuch a test would allow any needed repairs to be made without requiring\nanother servicing\nmission.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nof developing\na method for detecting\nfuture servicing\nmissions.\n\nNo. 35: Reassess the feasibility\nlight leaks in the HST during\n\nThe PRT was also concerned about the possibility\nthat last-minute\nchanges to\nflight or ground documentation\nmade necessary by changes in hardware or\nprocedures\nmight not be made in time if they are simply submitted through the\nnormal approval processes.\nThe team recommended\nthat the HST Project take an\nactive role in working with the JSC operations community\nto ensure that all needed\nchanges are made. The HST Project did work closely with the JSC operations\npersonnel to ensure that there were very few surprises found during the mission.\nThe Problem Review Team Report No. 1 also addressed the issue of early crew\ndesignation,\nwhich is discussed in connection with the Fitts team recommendations\nand in Mission Director\'s Recommendations\nNo. 14 and No. 15.\nThe Flight Requirements\nDocument\nwas approved on August 14, 1992. It\nestablished the mission\'s requirement\nto support three planned EVAs, two payload\ncontingency\nEVAs, and one Orbiter contingency\nEVA. This six-EVA capability\nwas\nthe minimum\ncapability\nrecommended\nin the July 17, 1992, report of the Fitts team.\n\n27\n\nOn August 14, 1992,the group that was established at JSCto investigate the\nproblems encountered during the Intelsat capture EVAs on STS-49 released a\nmemorandum\ndocumenting\nthe results of their assessment\n(JSC, GA-92-064).\nof their recommendations\nhad applicability\nto the HST SM-1.\n\nSome\n\nThe Intelsat group recommended\nthat sufficient engineering\nanalysis be\nperformed before commitment\nto an operations\nconcept. While the overall concept\nfor HST servicing\nhad been established\nyears earlier, some innovative\nmission\ndevelopment\nand training methods were employed for STS-61. Virtual reality\ntechniques\nwere used in the development\nof some of the RMS positions and\nprocedures\nand in the verification of others.\nIn addition, some air-bearing devices\nused in the Apollo program were employed in a new way to provide training for\nmass handling.\nThe Intelsat group also recommended\nthat the limitations\nof simulation\nmethods\nused for critical design verifications\nand crew training activities be verified,\ndocumented,\nand regularly reinforced to the personnel\ninvolved\nin these activities.\nFor STS-61, adequate precaution was taken to make the flight crew aware of which\naspects of their training were flight-like, and which were unique to the training\nmethod being employed.\nAn example is the demonstration\nof the actual flight ORUs\nto the crew fairly early in the training schedule, so that they would know how the\ntraining mockups\ndiffered from the flight items. The validity of the S\'IVo_l\nsimulation methods was independently\nassessed by the EVA Peer Review Team,\nchartered\nby the STS-61 Mission Director and led by Col. Jerry Ross. This team found\nthat the methods provided valuable training and that limitations\nwere adequately\ncommunicated\nto the crew. See Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 55.\nThe Intelsat group recommended\nthe development\nof a project management\nplan that defines roles and responsibilities,\ntasks, and analyses for hardware\ndevelopment,\noperations, and training for missions with high complexity\nand risk.\nGSFC released the first version of their HST First Servicin_ Mission Management\nPlan in October 1992. It was revised significantly\nin September 1993. The Space\nShuttle Program published their Space Shuttle Program\nProject Plan for STS-61 in\nApril 1993.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 36: For complex missions\nmanagement\nplan should be developed\nearly in the planning\nflow.\nThe development\nand execution\nof the plan should be coordinated\namong the various elements\nof the mission team.\n\na\n\nThe Intelsat group also recommended\nthe use of peer review to validate\noperations\nconcepts\nand the design before committing\nto new high-complexity\nmissions.\nAlthough they were not formed solely in response to this recommendation, peer review groups did make significant contributions\nto the success of the HST\nSM-1. The Tool Review Team, headed by Mr. Warren Brasher, helped to implement\n\n28\n\nI\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents\n\ncorrective actions for the tool problems discovered\nduring human thermal vacuum\ntesting and helped to enhance the effectiveness\nof the STS-61 tool certification\nprocess. The recommendations\nof this team are discussed below in connection\nwith\nthe team\'s July 13,1993, presentation\nof the results of their investigation.\nAnother\nteam, led by Col. Jerry Ross, enhanced STS-61 EVA efficiency with their recommendations for revising EVA procedures\nand tool stowage locations.\nSuch review\nactivities can add significant value to the preparation for a critical mission, but care\nshould be taken to prevent negative impacts to the mission team activities caused by\nthe review team\'s need to become educated on mission details.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 37: For critical missions,\nincluding\nHST servicing and Space Station assembly\nand maintenance\nmissions,\na multidisciplinary\nteam should be established\nto provide a\nthorough\nand comprehensive\nindependent\nassessment\nof flight\nreadiness.\nThe team should identify areas of potential risk and make\nrecommendations\nof appropriate\nactions to enhance mission success.\nThe team must possess a relevant experience\nbase.

They also specifically\nrecommended\nthat the aperture\ndoor (AD) be opened while the Orbiter was still\nwithin reach. Extensive work, some performed before this recommendation\nwas\nmade, went into the development\nand execution of tests performed\nduring or after\neach EVA to verify that replacement\ncomponents\nwere electrically alive and that no\nnoticeable problems were caused by the EVA activities.\nThese tests were very\neffective methods of indicating that the EVA activities were properly performed.\nThe\nissue of when to open the AD had been in work for both the HST deployment\nmission (S\'I_31) and the STS-61 mission.\nWhen analysis indicated\nthe risk of\ncontamination\nto HST to be acceptably\nlow, it was also decided to open the AD while\nthe HST was still grappled by the Orbiter\'s\nRMS.\nStafford\'s team suggested\nthat, given the greater inherent risk of a night landing,\nNASA verify that a night launch was essential to the success of the mission.\nBecause\nof the limited number of days each month in which both potential launch-abort\nlandings and the nominal end-of-mission\nlanding would occur in daylight, it was\ndecided not to make daylight landing a mission requirement.\nDevelopment\nof a\nnight scene for the portable\nin-flight landing operations\ntrainer (PILOT) was accelerated to support STS-61 in-flight training. The commander\nand pilot for STS-61 both\nreceived extensive night-landing\ntraining in the Shuttle training aircraft and the\nshuttle mission simulator.\nHowever, there are no established requirements\nfor\ntraining for night landings.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 38: Establish nighttime\nShuttle training aircraft (STA) training\nrequirements\nfor the\ncommanders\nand pilots of all Space Shuttle missions.\nThis is\nespecially\ncritical for missions\nscheduled\nto land at night and for\nground-up\nrendezvous\nmissions,\nwhich have the potential\nfor\nlanding at night, depending\non when they are launched.\nEstablish\nrequirements\nfor demonstrated\nminimum\nperformance\nlevels for\n\nnight landings.\nStafford\'s team recommended\nthat HST EVA priorities be defined as soon as\npossible.\nGiven the dynamic nature of the condition\nof HST as component\ndegradation continued,\nit was understandable\nthat EVA task priorities would change fairly\nlate in the mission development.\nHowever,\nthis situation is not conducive\nto efficient\nmission preparation.\nRequirements\nshould still be established\nearly and updated as\nrequired.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 39: To help ensure efficient\nand successful\nplanning\nand execution\nof complex EVA missions,\nit\n\n32\n\n[\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents\n\nis important that EVA task priorities be established\nas early as\npossible,\npreferably\nwell before the standard time of publication\nof\nthe Payload Integration\nPlan, and before the occurrence of the Cargo\nIntegration\nReview.\nStafford\'s team also recommended\nthat, given the experience of the STS-61 EVA\ncrew, NASA consider waiving the requirement\nagainst performing\nEVAs before the\nfourth day of the mission.\nAfter thorough\nreview of this suggestion,\nit was decided\nto keep the first EVA scheduled for the fourth day. An earlier EVA day would have\nseriously compressed\nthe timeline for the large amount of preparatory activities.\nIt\nwould also have increased the risk of something\nbeing left undone and of some\ncrewmembers\nstill being under the effects of space adaptation syndrome\n(SAS) when\nscheduled\nto perform an EVA. For future critical missions, the scheduling\nof an EVA\nbefore flight day four should be considered\nonly for experienced\ncrews with low risk\nof SAS, and after a thorough\nanalysis of pre-EVA activities and timelines.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 40: Scheduling\nof critical\nEVAs before flight day four should be done only for missions\nwhose\ncritical crewmembers\nhave an established\nhistory of being free of\nspace adaptation\nsyndrome\nsymptoms\nby the flight day of the EVA,\nand should be done only with the concurrence\nof the crew and the\nflight surgeon, based on a thorough analysis\nof pre-EVA activities\nand timelines.\nThe Stafford team cautioned NASA against scheduling\nsecondary objectives to\nbe accomplished\nprior to the primary ones. While this concept is basic to all Shuttle\nmission planning, because of the changing priority of the tasks of HST SM-1, it was a\nmatter of consideration\nuntil fairly late in the mission planning.\nThe flight plan was\nmade according to this philosophy,\nexcept where the time predicted to perform the\ntask having the next greatest priority exceeded the time remaining in the EVA. In\nthese cases lessor priority tasks were scheduled.\nThe most noticeable example of this\ntype of exception is the SA change-out,\nwhich, although it was the top priority task,\nwas performed\nduring EVA 2, because it could not be performed in a single EVA\nunless some preparatory work had been performed\nfirst.\nThe Stafford team cautioned NASA to not\nexpectations\nto the news media and the public.\nare discussed above in connection\nwith the Dr.\n1992.

Imagery data should be maintained\nin a\nreadily accessible,\nrapid-retrieval\nsystem.\nSee Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNo. 25 and No. 71.\nMr. Young stated that the crew scheduling constraints found in Appendix\nK of\nthe Space Shuttle Crew Procedures Management\nPlan are often waived during a\nmission to increase the chances of mission success. In the planning of HST SM-1, the\nquestion arose whether a crewmember\ncould perform EVAs on consecutive\ndays,\nwithout approval of the mission management\nteam (MMT). Some mission support\npersonnel believed that the flight director has the authority to waive the constraint.\nOthers believed\nthat a decision from the MMT is required.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 42: To provide clearer\ndecision-making\nKu/delines\nfor matters involving\ncrew activity\nconstraints,\nthe authority to waive constraints\nin Appendix\nK of the\nSpace Shuttle Crew Procedures\nManagement\nPlan should be clearly\ndefined.\nMr. Young cautioned that, because of the high criticality of the EVA power\ntools, the battery and power tool provisions\nshould be "overkilled."\nDuring STS-51, a\npower ratchet tool battery failed to provide power for as long at it was expected to.\nDuring STS-61, an HST power tool failed. In both of these cases, sufficient spares\nwere flown to allow completion\nof the scheduled\ntasks. Since such failures of EVA\nhardware are not uncommon,\nit is necessary to have ample backups\nfor tools and\nbatteries.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 43: For critical\n\nEVA tools\n\nand batteries, ensure that ample in-flight\nbackups are available.\nthe use of power tools is essential to the completion\nof required\ntasks, fly enough tools and batteries to accommodate\nmultiple\nfailures of each.\n\n34\n\nIf\n\n|\n\nI\n\nPre-Mission\n\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 44: Review\n\nEvenls |\n\nthe\n\nperformance\nof the batteries used during the STS-61 EVAs. Assess\nthe adequacy\nof the strategy used to manifest\nthe types and\nquantities\nof the batteries that were flown.\nCompare the STS-61\nbattery plan to other techniques\nand technologies,\nincluding\ninflight recharging,\nand other types of batteries.\nMr. Young recommended\nan investigation\ninto the concept of self-rigidizing\ntethers attached to the waist area of the EMU to provide the capability to restrain the\nEVA crewmember\nin less time than it would take to set up a foot restraint. This\nconcept was not developed\nfor STS-61. Such an attachment device would likely be\nuseful to the Space Station Program, where the potential exists for EVAs to be\nperformed\nin locations not accessible from foot restraints.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 45: Investigate\nalternatives\nor improvements\nto the present foot restraint\nconcept, to enable an\nEVA crewmember\nto be secured at worksites\nfor which the present\nfoot restraints are not satisfactory.\nOn September 29, 1992, the Group Task Force on Satellite Rescue and Repair\nreleased their report in Washington,\nD. C. The task force, part of the NASA Advisory\nCouncil, had been established\nby the NASA Administrator\non May 14, 1992, "to\nreview policies, pricing, and implementation\nfor undertaking\nunanticipated\nsatellite\nrescue and repair missions utilizing the Space Shuttle." The task force was chaired by\nDr. Eugene Covert, Head of the Department\nof Aeronautics\nand Astronautics\nof the\nMassachusetts\nInstitute of Technology.\nThe report contains six recommendations\nrelated to the implementation\nof rescue and repair missions.\nThe first recommendation\nis that NASA should continue to ensure that safety\nrequirements\nare met for all satellite rescue and repair missions.\nThe NASA safety\nprocesses for an EVA mission are complex and disjointed.\nHardware provided by\nthe payload customer is subjected to review by the Payload Safety Review Panel\n(PSRP). In-flight operations\nthat serve as controls to safety hazards are submitted\nby\nthe PSRP to the Mission Operations Directorate\'s (MOD\'s) Flight Techniques\nPanel(s)\nfor assessment\nof EVA safety. MOD is tasked with the responsibility\nfor overall\noperational safety verification,\nwhich it performs\nas part of its Flight Techniques\nPanel process. A majority of the Space Shuttle Program\'s (SSP\'s) EVA hardware is\nclassified as flight crew equipment\n(FCE), a subset of the SSP\'s government-furnished\nequipment\n(GFE). EVA equipment\nthat is built especially for a specific payload is\nusually classified as payload GFE hardware.\nAlthough these two different types of\nGFE items are controlled\nby two different configuration\ncontrol boards (CCBs), they\nare both subjected to the same GFE safety approval process, which is separate\nand\ndistinct from the PSRP. Some EVA items (such as some tools) that are flown on every\nmission for contingency\npurposes are classified as contractor-furnished\nequipment\n(CFE). CFE is reviewed under yet another set of safety requirements.\nSome Orbiter\n\n35\n\nI Pm-Mi_ion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nequipment\nthat is incorporated\nto accommodate\na specific payload is classified as\npayload integration\nnominal cost hardware (PINCH) and is approved through a\nprocess different from the CFE process. For each mission an integrated\ncargo hazard\nassessment\nflCHA) is performed,\nusing a standard checklist of generic hazards to\nscreen for hazards caused by any of the payloads on a mission due to their proximity\nto or interaction\nwith Orbiter systems, other payloads, or personnel.\nFor each mission, a Prelaunch Assessment\nReview (PAR) is conducted\nby the\nSafety, Reliability, Quality Assurance,\nand Mission Assurance personnel\nof the\nvarious NASA centers and NASA Headquarters.\nAt the PAR are heard descriptions\nand assessments\nof any significant known problems that might affect the mission\nunder review.\nThe Systems Safety Review Panel (SSRP) at JSC, at its discretion, can\nassess any aspect of mission hardware, preparation,\nor procedures\nfor compliance\nwith safety requirements.\nBecause both the PAR and the SSRP are rev/ew bodies,\ntheir assessments\noccur dose to the launch date, and therefore usually cannot\nproactively\naffect the mission under review.\nTypically, there is no one entity that actively controls or coordinates\nthe various\nsafety processes during the preparation for a Space Shuttle mission.\nFor HST SM-1,\nthere was no discernible\ncomprehensive\nmission assurance effort.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 46: For each NASA human\nspace mission,\ndesignate\na single point of contact who is directly\nresponsible\nfor coordinating\nthe entire safety and mission assurance\neffort for the mission (including\nhardware, systems, and operations).\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 47: NASA should develop\na single process that is responsible\nfor all aspects of EVA safety and\nmission assurance\n(S&MA). This process should assess the\nintegrated\nEVA-related\nS&MA aspects of flight crew equipment,\nother government-furnished\nequipment,\npayload-related\nhardware,\nand EVA, Orbiter, and payload operations.\nThe second task force recommendation\nwas that mission managers should be\nassigned upon acceptance of a mission and that the mission manager should be\nresponsible\nfor all aspects of preflight mission execution.\nA mission manager was\nnamed within the Space Shuttle Program to manage the Level lII (project level)\naspects of the mission, but not "all aspects."\nThe STS-61 Mission Director was\ndesignated\nby the Associate Administrator\nfor Space Flight to "coordinate the efforts\nof the team," but was not given full responsibility\nfor the team. For future significant\nNASA missions, a Mission Director should be appointed\nand be given clearly defined\nroles and responsibilities.\n\n36\n\nI\n\nPr_Mission\n\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 48: A mission\n\nEvents\n\ndirector\n\nshould be appointed\nfor future HST servicing missions\nand other\nhighly complex space flights designated\nby the NASA\nAdministrator.\nThe mission director should be responsible\nfor the\nmanagement\ndirection and oversight\nof the integration\nand flight\npreparation\nprocess and accomplishment\nof the mission.\nThe\nmission director\'s responsibilities\nshould include oversight\nof the\nmission training\nand concurrence\nin the determination\nof the flight\nreadiness\nof the flight crew, the integrated\noperations\nteam, the\ncustomer management\nteam, and the mission management\npersonnel.\nThe mission director should provide concurrence\nin the\ndate and time of launch, and the launch window.\nThe mission\ndirector should also concur in the mission goals, objectives,\npriorities,\nand policies.\nThe mission\ndirector should participate\nconcur in the selection\nof the crew. The mission director should\n\nand\nbe\n\nresponsible\nfor the proper coordination\namong the various NASA\noffices, NASA centers, NASA program managers, and persons,\ngroups, and organizations\nexternal to NASA who have a\nresponsibility\nfor the safe and successful\nexecution\nof the mission.\nThe mission\ndirector should establish\nspecial committees\nand/or\nassessment\nteams, as required,\nto assess the readiness\nof the STS and\ncargo to support mission requirements.\nThe mission director should\nhave final approval authority of the cargo mix, including\nsecondary\npayloads,\ndetailed test objectives\n(DTOs), and detailed\nsupplementary\nobjectives\n(DSOs).\nThe mission director should be\nresponsible\nfor the resolution\nof key issues involving\nany aspect of\nthe mission.\nThe mission\ndirector should co-chair the Mission\nManagement\nTeam (MMT). The mission director should be\nresponsible\nfor ensuring\nthat the Space Transportation\nSystem (STS)\nand cargo comply with all safety requirements.\nThe mission director\nshould be responsible\nfor mission assurance and flight readiness\nof\nthe STS and cargo, and provide concurrence\nin resolutions\nof\npayload or Orbiter anomalies\nthat have a potential\nimpact on\nmission success.\nThe mission\ndirector should be a signatory on\ncertificates\nof flight readiness\nthat pertain to the specific flight for\nwhich the director has responsibility.\nThe mission director should\nprovide concurrence\nin the approval or disapproval\nof flight specific\nwaivers.\nThe mission director should represent\nand report directly\nto the Associate\nAdministrator\nfor Space Flight.\nThe third recommendation\nof the group task force was that mission integrated\ntraining is essential for all aspects of Shuttle training.\nSee Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNos. 21-24, No. 59, and No. 72.\n\n37\n\n|\n\nThe fourth recommendation\nwas that NASA should adequately\ncommunicate\nthe inherent complexity\nof rescue missions to the public. The _1\npublic affairs\nactivities are discussed above in connection with the Dr. Allen recommendations\nof\nJuly 17, 1992.\n\nSee Mission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nThe fifth recommendation\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 4.\n\nof the task force was that NASA\n\nshould\n\ncommit\n\nto\n\nthe maximum\nuse of individuals\nwith previous experience\n(both internal and external\nto NASA) and past lessons learned to help ensure mission safety and success. For\nHST SM-1, significant contributions\nwere made by EVA-experienced\nastronauts\ndirectly involved in the mission, including the flight crew themselves,\nand by\nastronauts\nand former astronauts participating\nin EVA procedure\nreviews, most\nnotably the Independent\nEVA Assessment\nteam established\nby the HST Mission\nDirector and led by Col. Jerry Ross. NASA also made significant use of EVA\nplanning and training personnel\nwho had extensive experience\non previous EVA\nmissions.\nTheir use of proven, and, in some cases, innovative\ntraining methods\nresulted in the excellent preparation of the EVA crew for their tasks.\nEVA lessons learned were also used by the EVA designers and trainers for STS61. Typically, lessons-learned\ndatabases are maintained\nfor internal use by the\nvarious disciplines\nof flight planning personnel.\nBecause these databases are kept\ninformal, they often contain conflicting advice resulting from differing\nopinions\nexpressed by different\ncrewmembers\nand other personnel.\nIf these databases were\nedited to represent dear guidelines,\nwhere possible, and made available to the\ngreater NASA and customer community,\nthey would be of greater use to payload\nand mission designers.\nA lessons learned steering committee led by the NASA Office of Safety and\nMission Assurance has begun working to develop new systems and procedures\nto\nenhance the availability\nof aerospace-related\nlessons both among the NASA centers\nand between NASA and other government\nagencies.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 49: The Space Shuttle\nProgram should formalize\nits various lessons-learned\ndatabases and\nmake them widely available to the Shuttle customer and design\ncommun/ties.\nThe EVA and Crew Equipment\nProject Office might\nbe the proper owner of the EVA and RMS lessons databases.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. S0:. NASA should complete\nthe development\nof a NASA-wide\nand inter\'agency database of\nlessons learned from aerospace programs.\nInput of data from\ngovernment\nprograms should be program requirements.\nThe\ndatabase should be well publicized\nand easily accessible\nto NASA\nprogram and project managers.\n\n38\n\n[\n\n,\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvents ]\n\nThe sixth implementation\nrecommendation\nfrom the group task force is that\nNASA should upgrade its EVA capability, including the use of state-of-the-art\nEVA\ntools and training methods.\nThe improvements\nin EVA training employed\nduring\nSTS_I, including RMS-II, Nitrox, some of the air-bearing equipment,\nand virtual\nreality, were important\nto the success of the mission.\nSuch improvements\nand\ninnovations\nshould be continued and expanded upon.\nMission Directors\nRecommendation\nNo. 51: Expand and use stateof-the-art EVA tools and training methods (such as RMS II presently\ninstalled at MSFCs NBS, Nitrox, virtual reality, improved airbearing techn/ques,\net aL) to perform training and EVA tasks with\nmaximum\nefficiency.\nInvestigate\nother potential\nsources of ideas for\nimprovements,\nincluding\ntime-motion\nstudies and the experiences\nand techniques\nof the Russian space program.\nEspecially\nconsider\nimprovements\nin the area of thermal\nprotection\nof the EVA\ncrewmembers,\nassessing\nthe desirability\nof devices such as hand\nwarmers and an EVA infrared temperature\nsensor.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 52: Fund and develop a\nfully integrated\nEVA tra/n/ng facility (such as the proposed JSC\nNeutral Buoyancy\nLaboratory [NBL]), which would incorporate\na\nlarge capacity pool, state-of-the-art\nRMS simulator,\nNitrox, flightlike video and audio communication\ncapabUities,\nand any other\nfeatures useful to provide the flight crew and flight controllers\nthe\nbest possible\nend-to-end\nEVA training.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 53: For Space\nand for other EVAs with worksites\ntoo large to fit into\ntrainin 8 facilities,\ndevelop alternate\ntraining\nmethod(s)\naccomplish\nreliable end-to-end\ntimeline\nquantification\ntraining r Consider\nthe use of virtual reality to provide\ndimensional\ntraining\nfor handling\nlarge masses and to\nmethods of translating\nobjects that cannot be simulated\ntraining facilities.\n\nStation EVAs\nunderwater\nthat will\nand crew\nthreedevelop\nin water-\n\nOn October 14-15, 1992, the eighth HST Payload Operations\nWorking Group\n(POWG) EVA Working Group (EVAWG) splinter meeting was held. Minutes of the\nmeeting were released December 6, 1992. Preliminary\nEVA scenarios were presented\nat this meeting for consideration.\nThe servidng\ntasks were listed in three priority\ncategories:\n\n39\n\n_Pre-Miuion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nPrimary\nCOSTAR\nWF/PC II\nSecondary\nSolar Ai\'rays H\nTertiary\nRSU 2\nDF-224 Coprocessor\nGHRS Repair Kit\nRSU 3\nThe preliminary\nthree six-hour EVAs.\n\ntimeUnes\n\nprojected\n\nthat these tasks could be accomplished\n\nin\n\nThere was also a discussion of the possible RMS lI and Nitrox upgrades to the\nNBS at MSFC. The Nitrox system was scheduled\nfor completion\nin February 1993,\nand the EMU backpacks for the Nitrox system were scheduled\nfor June 1993.\nAdditional\nfunding was needed for the RMS II. The upgrading\nof the RMS facility at\nthe NBS had been recommended\nby the HST SM 92.1 Executive Summary_ Report\n(April 17, 1992) and by General Stafford\'s HST SM Review Team\'s first report\n(September 18, 1992), but it was stated by the EVAWG that the EVA community\ndid\nnot consider\nthe RMS lI to be required for STS-61. These upgrades are discussed\nbelow in connection\nwith the recommendations\nfrom the Stafford team\'s February 1112, 1993, meeting.\nAlso during the EVAWG, a presentation\nwas made detailing the recently\nupdated crew-induced\nload criteria for EVA hardware.\nThe new requirements\nwere\ngreater than had been previously\npresented to GSFC personnel, which they had been\nusing to design their EVA hardware.\nThese new criteria had not yet been incorporated as overall Shuttle Program requirements.\nThe representative\nof JSC\'s Loads\nand Dynamics Section agreed to work with GSFC personnel\nto determine if the\ncriteria should be applied to the specific hardwareand\ntasks to used for STS-61.\nFrom October 5 through November\n13, 1992, another series of NBS evaluations\nwas conducted.\nThis series of twenty-three\ntests, including\nthirteen with the STS-61\nEVA crewmembers\nas subjects, provided the crew with familiarization\nof all the thennominal ORU change-outs;\nevaluated change-out\nof WF/PC without\nthe use of the\nRMS and with and without\nthe use of the WF/PC installation\ntool (WIT); and\nevaluated new ORU hardware concepts and new space support equipment\n(SSE)\ndesigns.\nThe first HST mission status telecon was conducted\non November\n25, 1992. It\nwas chaired by Mr. Hal Lambert, manager of the Space Shuttle Integration and\nOperations\nOffice. These meetings would later be held biweekly.\nOn February 18,\n1993, Mr. Lambert was designated\nas Mission Manager for STS-61 by the Space\n\n40\n\nF\'_r_MtHlon\n\nEvents\n\nShuttle Program Manager and was placed in charge of an HST SM-1 Management\nTeam, which included\nthe Flight Integration Manager, the HST Program\nManager,\nthe Payload Integration\nManager, the Cargo Engineering\nOffice Manager, the Lead\nFlight Director, the Payload Commander,\nthe chairperson\nof the HST Tools\nConfiguration\nControl Board (CCB), JSC\'s Materials Branch Chief, a representative\nof\nthe Orbiter Project Office, the Space Shuttle Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance\n(SR&QA) Office Manager, GSFC\'s Associate Director of Flight Projects for HST, the\nHST Flight Systems and Servicing Project Manager, a representative\nof KSC\'s Shuttle\nPayloads Operations\nDivision, and the KSC Launch Site Support Manager.\nOn\nMarch 30, 1993, a representative\nof the STS-61 Mission Director was added to the\nteam membership.\nThe team was "established\nto provide management\noverview\nand\nresolution of issues associated with the mission.\nThis team will be responsible\nfor\ncoordinating\nthe integration activities between GSFC, JSC, and KSC, maintaining\noverall program schedules, insuring mission capabilities and mission priorities are\ncompatible and directing the activities in support of this mission as necessary to\nensure mission success." The team was "not intended to replace the existing\nmanagement\nstructure, but to facilitate problem resolution\nand increase the mission\nvisibility throughout\nthe existing system.\nThe HST SM-1 Management\nTeam will\nwork with the Mission Director to keep him informed of the status and progress of\nHST repair preparation."\nTopics of discussion in this first HST mission status telecon included\nthe\ntracking of the action items generated by the Stafford and Fitts HST review teams.\nOne of the action items assigned during this telecon directed the chairman\nof the HST\nTools CCB to ensure that proper certification\nhad been or would be accomplished\nfor\nall EVA tools. The EVA tool certification\nfor _1\nwas a difficult and controversial\nproblem and is discussed above in connection\nwith the recommendations\nmade in\nthe August 8, 1992, report of Dr. Greenfield\'s Program Review Team and below in\nconnection\nwith Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 75.\nA team was chartered by the Space Shuttle Program Office to evaluate the\ncauses for the substantially\ngreater time required\nto perform the STS-49 Assembly of\nStation by EVA Methods (ASEM) EVA, than was predicted preflight.\nThis ASEM\nProcess Improvement\nTeam (PIT) released the report of its findings on December 3.\n1992. The team recommended\nthe establishment\nof formal working groups for EVA\nhardware and define any improvements\nneeded for HST. The HST Tool CCB served\nas the formal working group for this mission.\nSignificant improvements\nwere made\nto the EVA hardware for STS-61. The EVA and Crew Equipment\nProject Office has\nsince been established\nand should serve as the working group for all future EVA\nmissions.\nThe ASEM PIT\'s report mentioned\nthat some on-orbit tasks could not be\nperformed\nbecause of suit stiffness, even though they were easily performed\nduring\nWETF training. Training suits have been empirically\ndemonstrated\nto be more\nflexible than flight suits. This concern led to the increase of EMU pressure during\n\n41\n\nI\n\nPre-Mlmion\n\nEvents\n\n,\n\n,\n\n|\n\nmany of the HST training runs in an effort to increase stiffness.\nHowever,\nthe HST\nEVA crew reported after the mission that the stiffness of the flight space suits was\nstill greater than that of the training suits at the higher pressure.\nMission\ndevelop\n\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 54: For EVA flight crews,\nand provide training EMUs that have flight-like\nstiffness.\n\nUnderwater\nfacilities are used for the greatest amount of EVA training.\nWorking in water has subtle and potentially\nmisleading\nqualities when compared to\nworking in space. The Mission Operations Directorate has developed\na set of such\nitems to be included in the crew training briefings to help prevent negative training.\nThe ASEM PIT recommended\nthat this list be completed\nand reinforced\nto the crew\nduring their water training.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 55:. To minimize\nnegative\nEVA trainin&\ncontinue to quantify shortcomings\nof training\nfacilities\nand to make sure that the differences\nbetween\nthe training\nand flisht environments\nare well understood\nby the flight crew.\nWork to eliminate\nthese differences\nwhere possible.\nAlso, where\npossible,\nprovide alternate part-task training to compensate\nfor\nfacility shortcomings.\nMaximize\nthe repeated exposure of actual\nflight hardware to the crew throughout\ntheir training.\nThe ASEM PIT recommended\nthat the Flight Crew Operations\nDirectorate\nand\nJSC Medical Operations\nassess the potential\nbenefit of implementing\na strength and\nconditioning\nprogram for EVA crewmembers.\nThe services of a professional\ntraining\ncoach and a training regimen were provided to the STS-61 EVA crew. While fatigue\nhas not yet been a significant problem in Shuttle EVAs, such a program would serve\nto enhance a crewmember\'s\ncapabilities and improve the probability\nof task\ncompletion\nin the event of other difficulties\nduring an EVA.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 56: Continue\n\nthe\n\nrefinement\nof the strength and conditioning\nprogram in which STS61 EVA crewmembers\nparticipated.\nImplement\nthis program as a\nrequirement\nfor all assigned EVA crewmembers.\nOn December 3, 1992, Col. Richard Covey, Comdr. Kenneth Bowersox and Mr.\nClaude NicoUier were announced\nto be the final three crewmembers\nfor the STS-61\nmission.\nMr. Nicollier and Comdr. Bowersox were the primary and backup RMS\noperators for the mission.\nEarlier assignment\nof these two crewmembers\nwould have\nallowed them to participate extensively\nin the March, August, and November\n1992\nNBS development\nand training runs. This earlier involvement\nwould have more\ngreatly enhanced the critical coordination\nrequired between\nthe RMS operator and\nthe EVA crewmembers.\nSee Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 15.\n\n42\n\nI\n\nIre-Mission\n\nEvents\n\nThe third FIST SM-1 Flight Techniques\nPanel meeting was held on December\n11,\n1992. Topics discussed during the meeting included the potential use of the WIT.\nThe panel decided to plan the task without the use of the WIT. The subject of\nrendezvous\nwith HST on flight day 2 was also discussed.\nThe crew expressed a\ndesire to consider a day 2 rendezvous\nonly in the event of a reduced-duration\nflight.\nThe second STS-61 Mission Status Telecon was also held on December 11, 1992.\nDuring this meeting, the contamination\nspecialist on the Mission Management\nTeam\nwas assigned actions to evaluate the potential\nfor contamination\ncaused by the\nchafing of painted EVA handrails by EVA tether hooks and whether it was required\nto replace the entire Orbiter payload bay liner for STS-61.\nJohn Young released memorandum\nAC5-92-53 on December\n16, 1992. In this\nmemorandum,\nhe recommended\nthat, because of the physiological\nperformance\ndegradation\ninduced by sleep shifting, the launch and EVA activities should not\noccur at night. Although daytime launch and mission operations\nare desirable goals,\nit is usually impractical to impose such a requirement\non rendezvous\nmissions.\nIt is\nprudent to maximize the chances of success for night missions.\nSleep-shifting\nregimens currently used by NASA for the flight crews have been effective in\nminimizing\nperformance\ndegradation.\nSleep shifting for mission support personnel\nis discussed in connection with Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 90.\nMr. Young also suggested\nthat NASA consider narrowing\nthe launch window to\nmaximize ascent performance.\nFor STS-61, it was determined\nthat ascent margin was\nadequate with the longer window,\nand that the longer window\nwas desirable to\naccommodate\nsmall problems in the launch countdown.\nFor Space Station missions,\nhowever, the launch window\nis expected to be approximately\nfive minutes\nper day.\nSmall problems during Space Shuttle countdowns\nare not uncommon,\nand some\nlaunches occurred only because of relatively large windows.\nThe Shuttle launch\nteams have little experience\nwith requirements\nto launch on time. On the basis of\nSTS-61 post-flight\ndiscussions,\nthe Space Shuttle Program performed\na launch\nprobability study focused on the likelihood of successfully\nlaunching the Shuttle\nduring this five minute window.\nMission\nDirectmas Recommendation\nNo. 57: The Space Shuttle\nProgram should review the current launch criteria and procedures\nand incorporate\nchanges that would safely enhance the likelihood\nsupporting\nthe expected requirement\nfor a five-minute\nlaunch\nwindow\nfor Space Station missions.\n\nof\n\nThe STS-61 Cargo Integration\nReview (CIR) was held January 6-8,1993.\nIts\npurpose was to ensure compatibility\nof flight operations\nplanning and engineering\nhardware and software design with payload requirements.\nDuring the review, the\nplanned launch date was determined\nto be December\n2, 1993. GSFC personnel\n\n43\n\n|\n\n[P_,-Miuien\nEvents\n\nagreed during the meeting to develop\nonly one or two EVAs were available\n\n]\n\nEVA scenarios to be followed\nduring the mission.\n\nin the case that\n\nA number\nof issues and problems were discussed during the CIR. GSFC\nprovided length data for their starboard flight support system (FSS) cable that\ndiffered significantly\nfrom their wiring mockup that had been used for the design of\nOrbiter wiring for the mission.\nConsequently,\nOrbiter cable routing had to be\nredesigned\nand the associated controlling documentation\nrequired major changes.\nAnother issue raised during the CIR was the launch location of the portable\nfoot\nrestraint (PFR) to be used for operations\nwith the HST Tool Box. The PFR socket on\nthe tool box had not been certified to withstand\nlaunch and landing loads with the\nPFR installed.\nSignificant EVA time savings could be realized, however, if the PFR\ncould remain attached\nto the tool box instead of being transferred\nto another location\nat the beginning\nand end of each EVA. During the January 29,1993, HST status\ntelecon, $200,000 was approved for the redesign of the PFR and the tool box to\nwithstand\nlaunch and landing loads.\nAlso at the CIK there were open concerns of possible contamination\nfrom the\ncrew compartment,\nEMUs, tool stowage foam, aft shroud beta cloth, tools, the ICBC,\nand paint chips caused by the chafing from EMU safety tethers. All of these concerns\nwould eventually\nbe satisfied by test or analysis.\nAnother open contamination\nitem\nwas the fact that KS(= had not yet agreed to implement\nGSFC\'s contamination\ncontrol\nplan for operations\nat KSC. KS(= later did approve and implement\nthe plan.\nThere was discussion\nduring the CIR related to the Orbiter\'s center of gravity\n(CG). At the time of the CIR, STS-61 appeared to meet the return-to-launch-site\n(RTLS) CG location requirements\nafter incorporation\nof several relief options,\nincluding installation\nof extra weight in Orbiter bay 13 (aft ballast). Concerns\nexisted,\nhowever, that any cargo modifications\nor additions could adversely affect the CG\nlocation.\nAt the time of the CIR, the RMS clearance assessment\nfor some of the EVA tasks\nand RMS maneuvering\ntime estimates for incorporation\ninto EVA timelines had not\nbeen completed.\nThe potential\nfor these maneuvering\ntimes to cause the EVA\ntlmelines to increase, as well as not-yet-defined\nphotographic\nrequirements\nand the\npossibility\nthat new tasks would be added to the EVAs, caused EVA personnel\nconcern that not all the required tasks could be accomplished\nin the three EVAs that\nwere scheduled.\nA CIR discrepancy\nnotice (DN) submitted by the Mission Director\'s\nOffice recommending\nthat a fourth EVA be added was disapproved\nbecause the issue\nwas currently being worked by upper level NASA management.\nThe number of\nscheduled EVAs is further discussed below in connection\nwith the February 2, 1993,\nupdate of the Flight Requirements\nDocument\nand in connection\nwith the briefing to\nGeneral Pearson on March 9, 1993.\n\n44\n\n[\n\nPre-Minion\n\nEvents\n\nOn January 17,1993, the first of the "EVAs of opportunity"\nwas conducted\nduring STS-54. Although the "EVAs of opportunity"\nconcept was intended to\nperform EVAs to evaluate techniques\nand increase capabilities for future missions\nsuch as HST servicing and Space Station construction,\nthe STS-54 EVA included little\nactivity of direct benefit to the HST EVAs. The decision to perform the EVA on STS54 had been made approximately\nthree months before the flight. Restrictions were\nimposed on the development\nof this EVA requiring that it be accomplished\nwith no\nadditional training, no additional hardware, and no significant impact to the flight\nplan or to payload operations.\nAs mentioned\nabove, recommendations\nhad been\nmade by the Fitts team (July 17,1992) to perform in-flight dry runs of difficult HST\ntasks and by the Intelsat group (August 14, 1992) to take advantage of opportunities\nto demonstrate\nEVA technologies\nand capabilities to the maximum practical extent.\nIf these recommendations\nhad been implemented\nsooner, the S\'IS-54 EVA could have\nbeen designed to be of greater benefit to HST SM-1. See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendation\nNo. 10.\nA tool familiarization\nmeeting was conducted\nin Houston on January 20, 1993.\nIt was announced\nin this meeting that tools controlled by JSC would be considered\ngovernment\nfurnished equipment\nand that GSFC tools would be considered\npayload\nhardware.\nThis different treatment of hardware led to confusion\nover certification\nrequirements\nand methods and over requirements\nfor data reporting.\nSee the\ndiscussion\nrelated to the recommendations\ncontained\nin Dr. Greenfield\'s\nProblem\nReview Team\'s August 8, 1992, report and the discussion\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 75.\n\nrelated\n\nto Mission\n\nOn January 26,1993, Dr. Greenfield\'s PRT released their second report, which\nresulted from the team\'s meetings in conjunction\nwith the CIR earlier in the month.\nOne of the recommendations\nin this report was that a joint GSFC/JSC/KSC\nteam\ndevelop a configuration-controlled\nmaster list of the HST and Orbiter tools required\nto support the mission.\nThe STS-61 HST Tools and Crew Aids Master List was\nbaselined by JSC\'s Payload GFE CCB on January 28,1993.\nAlthough the list was\ncontrolled\nat JSC, the responsibility\nof certifying the tools remained at the NASA\ncenters that produced the individual\ntools. See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendation\nNo. 75.\nThe PRT recommended\nthat NASA investigate\noptions to combine the unscheduled EVA for payload deployment\nwith the Orbiter safety contingency\nEVA. While\nthe Orbiter contingencies\nfor which EVA astronauts\nare trained are not expected to\ntake a fun six hours to perform,\nit is important\nto not assume that such an EVA could\nbe combined\nwith a payload EVA. Because the safety of the crew and the orbiter\nis\nthe top priority in mission planning and execution, consumables\nbudgeted\nfor\nOrbiter contingency\nEVAs should not be used for any other activities.\n\n45\n\ni\n\nPre-iVliuion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 58: Shuttle consumables\nreserved for Orbiter contingency\nEVAs should not be reallocated\nany other purposes.\n\nfor\n\nThe PRT recommended\nthat NASA perform an independent\npeer review by\nexperienced\nEVA astronauts to assess the planned operations\nand training approach.\nAt the direction of the STS-61 Mission Director, an EVA Peer Review Team (EPRT)\nwas formed in July 1993. It was led by Col. Jerry Ross and was composed\nof NASA\nEVA and HST experts and current and former EVA-experienced\nastronauts.\nThe\nEPRT assessed the training plan, including options in case of a launch slip. They\nreviewed nominal and contingency\nEVA timelines and procedures,\nand the EVA\ntools and hardware verification\nplan. They conducted\nextensive\ninterviews\nwith the\ntraining team, the integrated\noperations team, and the mission management.\nEVAexperienced\nastronauts\non the team both directly observed crew training and\npersonally performed\nkey nominal and contingency\nprocedures.\nSTS-61 EVA\ntimeUne enhancements\nresulted from the implementation\nof the EPR\'Fs recommendations to move the stowage location of the primary EVA tools from the payload bay\nto the middeck, their suggested improvements\nto the RSU change-out\nprocedure,\nand\ntheir recommendation\nto perform parallel EVA operations.\nThe EPRT also assessed\nthe possible use of a three-crewmember\nEVA and the performance\nof back-to-back\nEVA.s, switching crew during the same day, and determined\nthat neither of these\noptions would benefit the HST SM-1.\nThe PRT recommended\nthat the quantity and nature of ground commands\nduring the EVA be reviewed and verified to cause the minimum\npossible time\nimpact. They also recommended\nthat the increased use of onboard, aft deck payload\ncommanding\nbe considered.\nThe commanding\nthat was executed during STS-61 was\nwell coordinated\nand performed\nin a timely manner.\nThis good performance\nwas\npartly a result of practice that occurred during JISs for the mission.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 59:. For HST servicing\nmissions\nand for Space Station missions,\ncontinue to achieve the\nproper balance of payload commanding\nperformed\nfrom the ground\nand performed\nby the flight crew. To the extent practical, maximize\nthe amount of commanding\nwhich can be performed\nby the flight\ncrew, to avoid delays caused by wa/ting for a good air-to-ground\ncommunications\nlink. Thoroughly\nrehearse and evaluate\nthe\ncommanding\nprotocols during joint integrated\nsimulations.\nDr. Greenfield\'s\nteam recommended\nthat the aft flight deck commanding\nof HST\nbe verified preflight in an end-to-end test between the Orbiter and GSFC. Communications and commanding\ntesting done in preparation\nfor STS-61 revealed problems in\nsoftware and a potential data link problem (inverted\ndata) which might require panel\nrewiring by the crew during flight. A special cable was flown on STS-61 to be used\nfor this purpose if needed.\nThis rewiring\nwas not required during HST SM-1,\n\n46\n\nI\n\n_-Miuion\n\nbecause the in-flight\ninverted).\n\nacquisition\n\nof signal resulted\n\nin data of the proper\n\nEvents |\n\npolarity\n\n(not\n\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 60:. Continue\nto maximize\nthe mount\nof end-to-end\ncommunications\nand commanding\ntesting\nperformed\nbefore critical missions.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 61: For the next HST\n\nservicin 8 mission, fully understand\nthe potential for acquiring\ninverted\ndata from the HST. If the capability\nfor in-flight rewiring\ndetermined\nto be necessary,\nmake the necessary preflight modifications to Orbiter equipment\nto allow the crew to perform this action\nwith minimal effort (e.g., operating a simple switch).\n\nis\n\nThe Flight Requirements\nDocument was revised February 2, 1993, to include a\nmission duration of nine days plus two payload contingency\ndays and two landing\ncontingency\ndays. The revision also changed the number of EVAs to three scheduled\nEVAs plus one payload contingency\nEVA and one Orbiter contingency\nEVA (3+1+1),\neven though MOD planning at this t_-ne assumed a 4+2+1 EVA capability.\nThe\nShuttle Program preferred to delay the commitment\nto additional EVAs in order to\ndiscourage the addition of tasks of lesser importance.\nThe number of scheduled\nEVAs is fixrther discussed in connection\nwith the presentation\nto General Pearson on\nMarch 9, 1993.\nAt the request of the NASA Administrator,\nDr. Joseph Shea formed a team to\nreview HST SM-1. His Task Force on the HST Servicing Mission held its first\nmeeting, at GSFC, February 4-5, 1993. The task force\'s findings from this and its\nsubsequent\nmeetings were published\nin May 1993, and are discussed later in this\nsection.\nThe second meeting of General Stafford\'s FIST SM Review Team occurred at JSC\non February 11-12, 1993. The team released the report of their findings March 15,\n1993. The team recommended\nthat NASA strive to conduct JISs with EVA\ncrewmembers\nlocated in the NBS at MSFC. One such JIS was conducted\non October\n8, 1993.\nThe Stafford review team repeated their September\n1992 recommendation\nto\nupgrade the RMS simulator at MSFC\'s NBS, and recommended\nthe incorporation\nof a\nNitrox breathing system. The team believed\nthat insufficient\nShuttle Program\nmanagement\nattention had been given to these upgrades prior to the February\nmeeting.\nNeither of these systems was upgraded in time for the June 1993 NBS\ntesting.\nSeveral factors contributed\nto the delay in incorporation\nof the two systems.\nAlthough an informal group began working on the Nitrox system in January 1992, its\nwork was not given high priority by the Centers or by the Space Shuttle Program\nuntil late in the STS-61 flow. A formal Nitrox working group had been in the process\n\n47\n\nIPre-Mission\n\nEvents\n\nI\n\nof formation\nat the time of the February Stafford team meeting.\nNeeded funding\nauthorization\nwas not provided by JSC to MSFC until early 1993. The RMS upgrade\ndid not receive program recognition as a high priority until February 1993. As a\nresult of these delays, neither upgrade was in place in time for the largest series of\nHST training runs, which occurred in June 1993. MSFC personnel were later able to\novercome\nsignificant technical obstacles, and to perform upgrades of both systems\nbefore the October 1993 tests. Both systems were of great significance\nin allowing the\ncrew to validate timelines and to receive valuable end-to-end\ntimeline training.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 62: Identify requirements\nfor joint center operations\nas early as possible\nin the mission flow to\nallow time to resolve technical, budgetary,\nand administrative\nissues\nwithout causing impacts to mission schedules.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 63: The Space Station\nProgram should thoroughly\nassess requirements\nfor integrated\nRMS/EVA training\nin comparison\nto available facilities.\nIf it is\ndetermined\nthat facilities at other centers are required (e.g., MSFC\'s\nNeutral Buoyancy\nSimulator), necessary\nintercenter\nagreements\nshould be established\nas soon as possible\nto ensure availability\nand\nproper configuration\nof facilities.\nThe Stafford team recommended\nthe assignment\nand training of a backup crew.\nThis recommendation\nhad been made by the STS-61 Mission Director to the team\nduring the February meeting.\nMr. Greg Harbaugh, the EVA Capsule Communicator\n(Capcom)\nfor STS-61, was also named as backup crewmember\non March 9, 1993.

This training proved to be extremely valuable, as it\nenabled the crew to become familiar with mechanisms\nthat may have functioned\ndifferently from the training hardware.\nDifferences were made known to the crew to\nminimize negative training that may have otherwise occurred.\nWhile it is always\ndesirable to train with exact duplicates of flight hardware items, it is often impractical\nto produce training hardware to the exact flight specifications.\nIn these cases, it is\nimportant that the crew be given the chance to see, handle and operate the actual\nflight hardware even if only in a restrictive controlled\nsetting (clean room).\nMission\n\nDirectors\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 67: For critical\n\nmissions,\ncontinue to maximize\nthe amount of preflight\nthe EVA crew receives with the actual flight hardware.\n\nEVA\nexperience\n\nOn March 4, 1993, the Mission Coordination\nTeam was established.\nIt was\nestablished\nto coordinate Level I activities and to oversee Level II and HI\nmanagement\nactivities during mission\nSTS-61 Mission Director, and included\nShuttle Program and the HST Program\n\npreparation.\nmanagement\nOffices.\n\nThe team was chaired by the\nrepresentatives\nof the Space\n\nOn March 8-9, 1993, at NASA Headquarters,\nthe Shea task force held the last of\nits four meetings.\nThe report of their findings and recommendations\nwas released in\nMay 1993, and is d_\nlater in this section.\nOn March 9, 1993, mission management\npersonnel made informal status\npresentations\nto NASA Associate Administrator\nfor Space Flight, General Jed\nPearson.\nDuring this meeting General Pearson indicated that he did not want the\nmission to be in progress over the Christmas holidays, because it would then\ninterfere with scheduled\nmaintenance\nactivities at KSC, causing schedule and cost\nimpacts to KSC operations.\nIf the launch were to be delayed by more than two\nweeks, then it would be rescheduled\nfor January 1994. He also indicated that he\nwould not require the launch or landing to occur in daylight.\nIt was reported to\nGeneral Pearson that Dr. Shea\'s task force was concerned\nthat the mission was too\nconstrained\nby the Shuttle Program\'s reluctance to increase the number of scheduled\nEVAs beyond three, and that EVA and contingency\nplanning and training were being\nnegatively\naffected. The task force was expected to recommend\nthe scheduling\nof\nfive EVAs to ensure maximum timeline margin.

One of the recommendations\nfrom this report\nwas that NASA should immediately\nbegin planning a contingency\nHST servicing\nmission to occur as soon as possible after STS-61 to accomplish\nthe tasks that were\nnot performed during _1.\nIn response to this idea, the Space Shuttle Program led\na study into the possibility of such a mission.\nIt was determined\nthat the timing of\nthe contingency\nmission was extremely dependent\nupon which tasks would have to\nbe rescheduled.\nIt was decided that if one of the primary HST servicing tasks were\nnot accomplished\nduring STS-61, then the FiST Program Office would request a\nsecond mission as soon as possible.\nUntil the required tasks were known, it would\nnot be practical to actually manifest such a mission.\nHowever,\nnormal mission\nplanning should include assumptions\nthat not all scheduled tasks will be\naccomplished.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 68: For the second\n\nsubsequent\nHST servicing missions,\nmission\ndevelop a list of primary tasks, which would\nmission if not completed.\nThe PRT also recommended\n\nthat a senior\n\nNASA\n\nand\n\nplanners should again\ntrigger a contingency\n\nofficial\n\nfrom the science\n\norganization,\nwhich was the customer for this mission, be designated\nas the OfficialIn-Charge (OIC) of the execution of the HST SM-1. It was decided that the mission\nmanagement\nstructure that had been established\nby the Space Shuttle Program\nProject Plan for S_1\nwas adequate for mission support.\nAn OIC was therefore\nnot\n\ndesignated.\nThe PRT recommended\nthat all individuals\ninvolved\nin the mission, both\ntechnical and management\npersonnel,\nshould participate in the JISs to the extent\npossible.\nSee Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 21.\nThe PRT observed that it is important that real-time responsibilities\nand clear\nlead and support roles for EVA procedures replanning\nand timeline estimation\nbe\nrecognized\nand enforced.\nThe EVA replanning efforts of the mission support team\nwere not well coordinated\nduring the initial JISs, but were significantly\nimproved by\nthe time of the mission as a result of the JISs.\nThe\npriorities\nreduced\ndesigned\n\nteam suggested\nthat, given the apparent discrepandes\nbetween\nthe\nof the tasks in the nominal mission EVA timelines and the priorities\nof the\nduration mission, NASA should verify that the nominal timeline was\nas if every EVA day were the last EVA day of the mission.\n\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 69:. To the extent possible,\ncritical EVA mission timelines\nshould be arranged so that at the\ncompletion\nof each EVA day, the payload (or Space Station) is in the\n\n52\n\n[\n\nPre-Mission\n\nbest possible\nconfiguration\nto be left in, in case the Orbiter\ndeorbit before the next EVA.\n\nEven_\n\nmust\n\nThe team also wanted NASA to verify that there were redundant methods of\naccomplishing\ncritical tasks in case the primary tool or device were lost or broken.\nSee Mission Director\'s Recommendations\nNo. 12, No. 19, and No. 43.\nThe PRT also recommended\ntimely failure analysis of the ORUs returned from\norbit to determine whether the improvements\nto the new designs had fixed the right\nproblems.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 70: Perform\n\nsufficient\n\nfailure analysis of returned HST components\nto ensure that failure\nmuses are understood.\nAlso look for signs of degradation\nother than\nthose which caused the failures.\nDuring the biweekly HST mission status telecon on April 9, 1993, it was\nannounced\nthat STS-61 would not include the replacement\nof the fine guidance\nsensor (FGS) which had degraded in February 1993. Procedural compensation\nhad\nbeen developed\nfor the degradation.\nIt was also announced\nthat _1\nwould not\nincorporate\nthe capability to send video images from the ground to the Orbiter.\nThe HST science\n\nwriters\' workshop\n\nwas conducted\n\nat GSFC on April 20-21,\n\n1993.\nDuring the May 7, 1993, FIST mission status telecon, it was announced\nduring testing of the deployable optical bench of COSTAR, some physical\ninterference\nwas encountered\nand some debris was generated.\nAn Orbit Flight Techniques\ndiscussion\nincluded procedures\nOrbiter water dumps.\n\nthat\n\nPanel meeting was held May 14, 1993.

This meeting served as a dry run\nfor the FOR to enhance the maturity of the mission documents\nto be submitted\nfor the\nreal FOIL During the meeting, GSFC and JSC personnel\nagreed to develop EVA\nscenarios for use if only one, two, three, or four EVAs would be available due to\norbiter\nor mission constraints.\nJSC personnel\nagreed to draft a real-time operations\ncontingency\nmanagement\nplan to document guidelines\nfor "tiger team" activity for\nsignificant off-nominal\nsituations outside documented\ncontingency\nplans. GSFC\npersonnel\nagreed to consider\nthe scheduling\nof SA blanket retraction during the night\nbefore the SA change-out\nEVA, instead of the morning of the EVA, to allow more\nreaction time in case problems were encountered.\nAt the conclusion of the meeting,\nthe chairman\nof the POWG related his reasons for his confidence\nthat the STS-61\nwould\n\nbe successful.\n\nHis reasons\n\nincluded\n\nthat the GSFC team was largely\n\n53\n\nthe same\n\n|\n\nPre-Mi_ion\n\nEven_\n\nI\n\none that had supported\nthe HST deployment\nduring STS-31, that the GSPC internal\nsimulations\nhad been occurring and exercising their interfaces\nwith JSC, and that a\nlarge number of JISs were to be conducted.\nThe Space Shuttle Program Deputy for\nProgram\nintegration\nexpressed\nhis desire that all relevant HST techn/cal data be\navailable at JSC during the mission.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 71: The Mission\n\nOperations\nDirectorate\nshould develop a computerized\nsystem to\nsupport decision making during real-time EVA mission replanning.\nThe system should\nprovide the flisht team with access to\ninformation\nrelated to the EVA timeline and procedures;\ntool\nhistories,\nperformance\ncapabilities,\nand locations; and payload\nconfiguration.\nIt should also provide access to photographs\nand\nengineering\ndrawings.\nSee Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNo. 25 and No. 41.\nDr. Joseph Shea\'s\nServicing Mission was\nmanagement\ncontinue\norganization.\nThe use\nRecommendation\nNo.\n\nRevort of the Task Force on the Hubble Svace Telescope\nreleased in May 1993. The team recommended\nthat top\npaying close attention to the HST SM-1 mission management\nof formal reviews was also endorsed.\nSee Mission Director\'s\n37.\n\nThe Shea team recommended\nthat training include end-to-end\nJISs of the EVAs.\nJISs typically incorporate\nsignificant malfunctions\nto test and enhance the flight\ncontrol team\'s ability to make changes to the originally planned timelines.\nThe\nrecommendation\nthat the EVAs be practiced fully during JISs is, therefore,\nnot totally\npractical. However,\nit is valuable to provide to the flight control team and the flight\ncrew with as much experience\nwith the nominal timeline as possible.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 72: To the extent practical,\nexpose the participants\nof joint integrated\nsimulations\nto all the\nnominal mission activities.\nDr. Shea\'s team recommended\nthat the HST Project conduct a quantitative\nassessment\nto determine the risk of verifying the status of all subsystems\n(both A and\nB sides) before SM-1. The HST Project did reassess their rationale and again decided\nthat not all redundant systems should be verified. This decision was approved by\nNASA administration\nand mission management.\nPart of the rationale for not\nperforming\ntesting of redundant paths was the fear of entering into an irrecoverable\nconfiguration\nin the event that the redundant path were not functional.\nGiven the\nimproved health of the HST resulting from the HST SM-1, it may now be less risky to\nverify the redundant\nsystems.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nfor not verifying\n\nRecommendation\nthe redundancy\n\nNo. 73: Reassess\nof all HST systems,\n\n54\n\nthe rationale\nnow that the\n\n{\n\n,\n\nPre-Miuion\n\nEvents\n\ntelescope\nhas been serviced.\nConsider verifying\nthe function of\nredundant elements\nwhose health is not now known, where such\nverification\nwould not risk the health of the HST. This verification\nshould be performed early enoush to allow replannin\n8 of the second\nservicin 8 mission,\nshould components\nbe in need of replacement.\nThe Shea team also recommended\nthat an integrated assessment\nof\ncontamination\ncontrol procedures\nand plans for the HS_ servicing missions be\nconducted.\nSuch a preflight assessment\nwas performed under the direction of Dr.\nMichael Greenfield.\nHis PRT reviewed the Contamination\nControl Master Plan\n(CCMP) developed\nby the HST Project, which addressed\ncontamination\nbudgets for\neach HST SM-1 instrument,\nhandling at KSC, and on-orbit possibilities\nfor\ncontamination.\nThe PRT compared the current requirements\ndocumentation\nto that\nused for the initial build of FIST. The HST SM-1 version of the CCMP was compared\nto that used for the FIST deployment\nmission.\nThe PRT found only minor\ndifferences,\nwhich they considered\nto be inconsequential.\nThe PRT reviewed\nthe\nresolution of the problems encountered\nin the testing of the COSTAR. They assessed\nthe design changes implemented\ninto WF/PC H to prevent the self-contamination\nexperienced\nby WF/PC I. The PRT reviewed testing and hardware changes\nimplemented\nto minimize\non-orbit contamination.\nThey reviewed flight procedures\nfor possible threats.\nIn all the above assessments,\nthe PRT found the contamination\nrequirements\nand compliance\nto them to be adequate.\nThe PRT also assessed KSC\nground processing\nguidelines\nand procedures.\nThe PRT considered\nthem adequate,\npartially based on the pending successful completion\nof a special contamination\nreview by KSC following the refurbishment\nof Launch Pad A and before payload\narrival at the Payload Change-out Room (PCR). The PRT released their satisfactory\nreport on October 25, 1993. On October 30, 1993, sand and debris were blown into\nthe PCR at Pad A. The PRT then assessed the investigation\nand corrective\nactions\nundertaken\nin response to the PCR contamination\nand found them to be satisfactory.\nThe PCR contamination\nis discussed below in the listing for October 30, 1993.\nDr. Shea\'s team also made recommendations\nrelated to accelerating\nthe\ndevelopment\nof EVA timelines and contingency\ntimelines\n(See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNos. 15 and 86), to upgrading\nthe NBS at MSFC (See the\ndiscussion\nof the Stafford team meeting, February 11-12, 1993), to designating\nand\ntraining a backup EVA crewmember\n(See Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo.\n64), to practicing HST tasks on earlier missions (See Mission Director\'s Recommendation No. 10), and to planning for a contingency\nmission (See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendation\nNo. 68).\nThe first two STS-61 human\n\nthermal\n\nvacuum\n\ntest (HTVT)\n\nruns were conducted\n\nMay 25 and 28, 1993. The more significant hardware problems\nthat were encountered during these tests are discussed below in connection\nwith the July 13,1993,\nreport from the Brasher team.

Because the Nitrox breathing system\nwas not yet installed, full six-hour tests, which could be used to better verify\ntimelines for entire EVA days, were not accomplished.\nBecause the new upgraded\nRMS simulator was not yet installed, valuable coordination\ntraining and RMS\ntimeline verification\ncould not be accomplished.\nThe communications\nprotocol\nmentioned\nabove had originally been planned as a "mini-JIS," but with the runs\nlasting only three hours, it was not practical to do more than just verify\ncommunications.\nThe KSC Ground Operations\nReview (GOR) was conducted\non June 18,1993.\nIssues presented during the review included concerns over the ability of KSC\nfacilities and equipment\nto support the stringent gaseous nitrogen purge cleanliness\nrequirements.\nDifficulty in meeting these cleanliness\nrequirements\nlater led to a\nrelaxation of the requirements\nwith the agreement of the HST Project. See Mission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 78 and its associated discussion.\nAnother GOR item of concern was the potential\nfor conflicting\nneeds for KSC\'s\nPayload Hazardous\nSupport Facility (PHSF) control rooms in case of a launch delay\nof the STS-51 mission by more than one week past its then-scheduled\ndate of July 17,\n1993. A favored solution to the conflict, if it were to arise, was the reservation\nof a\ntrailer to house some of the STS-61 ground support equipment.\nIt was later decided\nto use such a trailer, thereby eliminating\nconcern over any delay of STS-51. The\nlaunch of STS-51 occurred in August 1993.\nOn July 8,1993, the STS-57 flight crew EVA debriefing was held. The most\nsignificant result of the STS-57 EVA was that the Orbiter-bottom-to-sun\nattitude that\nhad been planned for several of the STS-61 HST servicing\ntasks was unacceptably\ncold to the STS-57 EVA crewmembers.\nDuring the debriefing,\nthe STS-61 Lead Flight\nDirector indicated that the STS-61 EVA thermal environment\nissue was now the top\npriority issue to be resolved before the flight. JSC\'s Crew and Thermal\nSystems\nDivision (CTSD) personnel stated that they were proceeding\nwith the development\nof\nEVA gloves that had better thermal protection characteristics\nthan the present glove\nhad.\nIn a subsequent\n_S-61\nEVA thermal environment\nmeeting on July 8,1993, the\nintention to pursue the development\nof EVA hand-warmers\nwas announced.\nIt was\nalso announced\nthat CTSD personnel\nwould perform higher fidelity thermal analyses\nof the known EVA thermal environment\nof STS-57 and the predicted environment\nof\nSTS-61.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 74: Prior to critical\n\nmissions,\nespecially\nthe HST servicing missions\nand Space Station\nAssembly\nmissions,\nperform detailed thermal analysis\nand modeling\nto verify that crewmembers\nand hardware are not subjected\nto\n\n57\n\n[ Prt,-Mi_ion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\ntemperatures\nbeyond their functional\nlimits. Beta angle of the\nmission\'s\norbital plane(s) should be included\nin the analysis.\nThis\nanalysis for the Space Station\'s womt-case\naltitude, inclination,\nattitude, configuration,\nand beta angle should be performed\nas soon\nas possible.\nSee also Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 10.\nOn July 13, 1993, the results of the investigation\nof Mr. Warren Brasher\'s Tool\nReview Team were presented to the Space Shuttle Program management.\nOne of the\nrecommendations\nof the Brasher team was that NASA consider the development\nof\nEVA gloves that would have improved thermal protection of the EVA crewmember\'s\nhands. C\'ISD personnel were later able to complete\nthe development\nof an improved\nthermal and micrometeoroid\ngarment (cover layer) for the EMU gloves, which had\nnot only greater thermal insulation, but also greater flexibility than the older design.\nThis development\nwas a significant\ncontribution\nto the success of the SIYo-_I mission.\nThe Brasher team also recommended\nthat NASA evaluate the development\nof a\nportable EVA hand-warmer.\nOn the basis of results from detailed thermal modeling\nand analysis, and from further human thermal vacuum testing, it was decided that a\nhand warmer was not needed for $I$-61.\nSee Mission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 51.\nAnother recommendation\nof the Brasher team was that NASA perform an\nanalysis of the ability to interface thermally worst-case tools and fasteners (one side\nhot, other side cold). Thermal analysis personnel\nat both JSC and GSFC produced the\nthermal analyses that indicated\nthat tools and crew aids planned for use on STS-61\nwould be adequate, given the successful performance\nof the planned fit checks of the\ninterfaces.\nAs an added measure,\nit was decided that sets of flight contingency\nsocket\nextensions,\nboth 5/16" and 7/16," would be precisely machined to the maximum\nallowable\ntolerances,\nto ensure that all fasteners could be accommodated\nby sockets\non board the Orbiter. This effort helped ensure the success of the STS-61 EVAs.\nThe Brasher team recommended\n\nthat the chairman\n\nof the HST Tool CCB, Mr.\n\nSteve Poulos, work with GSFC to develop the mechanism\nby which the CCB would\napprove changes that affected form, fit or function changes to GSFC\'s tools and crew\naids. Within the limits of the responsibility\ngiven to him, Mr. Poulos provided very\neffective leadership\nin the coordination\nof the JSC and GSFC design efforts.\nAnother\n\nBrasher\n\nteam recommendation\n\nwas that Mr. Poulos\n\ndefine\n\nan increased\n\nscope of responsibilities\nfor his HST Tool CCB. These responsibilities\nwere to include\nassessment\nand approval of all configuration\nchanges that affected fit, form, or\nfunction of all FIST crew aids and tools and assessment\nof GSFC and JSC certification\nand verification\nmatrices for technical adequacy.\nWhile the recommended\nincreased\nscope was an improvement\nto the coordination\nof the tool and crew aid development\neffort, it was not extensive enough.\nSince the basic responsibility\nof hardware\ncertification\ncontinued\nto reside with the NASA center at which the hardware was\n\n58\n\n[\n\nP_Miuion\n\nEven_\n\n|\n\ndeveloped,\nthere continued to exist differences in design and certification\nphilosophy\nbetween JSC and GSFC. This situation resulted in discrepancies\nin the data provided\nto mission control personnel, which were resolved only very late before launch and\nwith significant effort and management\nattention.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 75: EVA hardware,\nincluding\nall tools, supplied by multiple\nNASA organizations\nshould be manufactured\nto standardized\nNASA-wide\ncertification\nrequirements,\nand be controlled\nby a single configuration\ncontrol\nboard. Performance\nverification\n(including\nfit checks and\nverification\nof thermal tolerance) requirements\nshould likewise\nbe\nstandardized.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 76: Technical information,\nincluding\ncertification\ndata, related to flight tools and other EVA\nhardware, should be maintained\nin a rapidly accessible\nformat to\nsupport replanning\nand failure assessments\nduring missions.\nThe Brasher team learned that some of the standard EVA tools planned for STS-61\nhad not been redesigned\nto meet requirements\nimposed following the Challenger\naccident. The team recommended\nthat the certification of the entire Space Shuttle tool\ninventory be reverified,\nto ensure that no other tools had been omitted from the postSTS-51L rebaselining\neffort. The certification\nof the entire complement\nof EVA tools\nand crew aids contained\nin the _1\nmaster manifest list was subsequently\nreviewed\nand verified to be satisfactory.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 77: Verify that the\nhardware and software\nto be used for critical mission operations\nare\nnot to be used outside the operational\nranges for which they were\ncertified.\nAlso verify that the certification\nrequirements\nused for this\nhardware and software\nare consistent\nwith current program\ncertification\nguidelines.\nThe Brasher team tasked HST Tool CCB personnel\nwith providing\nhardware failures that occurred during HTVTs. The list follows.\n\na list of\n\nproblem - Insertion forces of the push in, pull out (PIP) pin into the McTether\nattachment was excessively\nhigh or would not go into tool at all.\nCorrective action - Apply dry film lubricant to spool to decrease coefficient of\nfriction with housing.\nInstall lighter spring in mechanism.\nEnsure a minimum\nradius on pip pin edges, including plunger.\nVerify ball and socket dimensions\nto ensure ball does not interfere with spool movement.\nReduce acceptable\nlevel for pip pin insertion force from ten pounds to no greater than six pounds.\n\n59\n\n[lh_-Mi_ion Events\n\nProblem\n\n|\n\n- Force to install and remove\n\ntools from tool post was excessively\n\nhigh.\nCorrective\naction - Replace existing ball detent with one requiring\nspring force.

Engrave a direction indicator\non the EVA knob to indicate\ntighten and/or loosen. Procedures\nchange to loosen knob prior to handle\nrelease.\nProblem - Unable to install PIP pin into McTether attachment on three tools.\nOne tool was not restrained on tool post.\nCorrective action - Mandatory inspection of McTether to verify that Loctite has\nnot contaminated\nsystem.\nModify Loctite application\nand curing instructions.\nAdditional\ninspection steps performed to verify correct spool displacement.\nPerform additional thermal acceptance testing to verify proper operation of\nMcTethers.\n\nDuring the presentation\nmeeting, a discussion\nwas held concerning\nthe\ntemperature\nof tools in the HST tool box. Mr. John Young suggested\nthat the EVA\ntools be launched in the Orbiter cabin instead of in the HST tool box. Although the\nSTS-61 crew and EVA training personnel\nhad previously\nexpressed their desire to\nlaunch the EVA tools in the Orbiter cabin, the apparent lack of available locker space\nprevented\nthe adoption of this idea. However,\nafter this idea was again\nrecommended\nby the independent\nEVA Peer Review Team and endorsed by the\n\n6O\n\nPre-Mission\n\nMission\nallowed\n\nDirector, some innovative\nstowage methods\nthe tools to be located in the cabin.\n\nwere implemented\n\nEvents\n\nwhich\n\nOn July 15,1993, the HST Program Manager initiated a reassessment\nof the\nadequacy of the HST aperture door to prevent contamination\nof HST optics during\nthe servicing mission.\nThis reassessment\nconsidered\nOrbiter jet exhaust particle\nimpingement\nto be of negligible concern.\nHowever,\ngiven that pressure spikes were\nindicated\nby the GHRS during STS-61 Orbiter jet firings, such spikes should be\nassessed for possible contamination\nimplications\nfor future servicing\nmissions.\nSee\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 28.\nDuring the HST Mission Status Telecon on July 23,1993, some of the results\nfrom STS-57 were discussed.\nOne result was that all Shuttle missions were now to be\nrequired to reserve an additional 330 pounds of aft propellant due to the high usage\nexperienced\nduring STS-57 and some previous missions.\nBefore the imposition\nof\nthis requirement,\nSTS-61 was carrying a margin of only 30 pounds,\nso this extra\nrestriction was a significant impact.\nThe second result that was discussed\ninvolved\nthe EVA thermal environments\nexpected on STS-61. It was estimated that the coldest\nof the STS-61 environments,\nassuming the worst-case beta angle, would be roughly\nequivalent to the Orbiter-bottom-to-sun\nattitude that was found to be unsatisfactory\nduring STS-57.\nAt a July 27,1993, meeting, GSFC personnel\nannounced\ntheir planned action in\nresponse to a leak that was experienced\nin one of the load isolators on their cargo\ncarriers. Their plan was to remove the damping fluid from an the isolators to\neliminate the risk of future leaks. They also intended\nto perform the hazard analysis\non the system using a "safe-life" approach instead of the previously\nplanned "fansafe" method.\nThe fourth report from Dr. Greenfield\'s\nPRT was released July 28,1993.\nBecause\nof the large number of tool and hardware interface\nverifications\nto be accomplished\nand the limited amount of time in which to do them, the team recommended\nthat a\nsingle office of prime responsibility\nbe defined to establish criteria and priorities for\nthe fit checks.\nThey also recommended\nthe development\nof a pre-defined\npriority\nscheme to ensure that the most important fit checks were the most likely to be\naccomplished.\nAlthough the HST Tool CCB was tasked with approving\nthe close-out\nof the fit-check matrices of both JSC and GSFC tools, they did not determine the\npriorities of an the fit checks before they were performed.\nNeither of these\nrecommendations\nwas totally complied\nwith. See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendation\nNo. 75.\nThe PRT also recommended\nthat the pedigree\nof the various thermal\ngo/no-go\ndetermination\nmethods be investigated\nto ensure that assumptions\nare consistent\namong the various organizations/NASA\ncenters involved\nin performing\nthermal\nverification exercises.\nThe go/no-go\ngauges used to screen probes, sockets, and bolts\n\n61\n\nJ\n\nP_Mimion\n\nEven_\n\nJ\n\nwere made by different sources and controlled by different NASA centers. The effort\nto understand\nwhat each gauge was designed to check (thermal expansion,\nmachining tolerances,\nor both) required a significant amount of coordination\nbetween\ncenters just before flight. There remained sufficient uncertainty,\neven after the\ncoordination\nefforts, that it was decided to make specially sized sockets to accommodate the worst expected temperature\ndifferences.\nSee Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNo. 8 and No. 75.\nThe PRT\'s report recommended\nthat, given the possibility\nthat the FiST SM-1\nflight hardware KSC nitrogen purge moisture and particulate requirements\nmight\nprove hard to meet, specific time periods of slightly higher moisture content and\nparticulate counts be allowed.\nA compromise\nwas later agreed to by KSC and the\nJPL, setting slightly higher steady-state\nallowances.\nHowever,\neven the more relaxed\nmoisture requirement\nwas difficult to meet. It is believed that the more stringent\npurge requirements\ncould have been met with the use of JPL\'s purge purification\nequipment.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 78: For HST servicing\nmissions\nand all other missions\nhaving payloads\nsensitive\nto\ncontamination,\nspecify any purge purity requirements\nearly enough\nin the mission processing\nflow to allow for verification\nof the\ncapability\nto comply with those requirements,\nConsider the use of\nspecial ground servicin 8 equipment\n(e.g., JPL\'s purge purification\nequipment)\nto meet requirements\ntoo stringent to be met with\nstandard equipment.\nThe PRT recommended\nthat KSC personnel\nrenotify organizations\noperating in\nthe areas surrounding\nthe payload processing\nareas of KS(= to restrict, during periods\nof susceptibility,\nactivities that might cause contamination\nof HST SM-1 hardware.\nSubsequent\nto the PRT report, two significant risks to the cleanliness of the payload\ndeveloped.\nA lightning-caused\ngrass fire generated significant amounts of smoke\ndose enough to the payload processing\nfacilities to be of concern.\nThe second cause\nfor concern was the blowing of sand and debris into the PCR at Launch Pad A by\n\nhighwinds.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 79. For HST servicing\nmissions\nand all other missions having payloads\nsensitive\nto\ncontamination,\nhave in place at the launch site a comprehensive\nplan\nto protect the payloads\nfrom all sources of contamination,\nincluding\nhuman-generated\nand natural sources.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 80:. For critical\n\nor sensitive\n\nmissions,\nminimize\nthe number of any untried\nor unusual mission\npreparation\nactivities (e.g., launch pad refurbishment)\nor flight\nactivities\nthat do not serve to increase\nchances of mission success.\n\n62\n\nI\n\n,\n\nPre-Mission\n\nEvenls |\n\nThe PRT also recommended\na special contamination\nreview of the recently\nrefurbished\nLaunch Pad A before arrival of the HST payload.\nAlthough such a\nreview was performed, neither this review nor the contamination\ncontrol plan in\nplace at KSC was adequate to prevent the intrusion of wind-blown\nsand and debris\ngenerated during pad modifications\ninto the Pad A PCR and into the Orbiter payload\nbay. This contamination\nis discussed below in the entry for October 30, 1993.\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nNo. 81: Conduct\n\nan\n\nindependent\nassessment\nof the contamination\ncontrol procedures\nperformed\nat KSC for STS-61. Assess them for adequacy\nfor the\nsecond HST servicing\nmission.\nVerify implementation\nof corrective\naction to prevent recurrence of wind-blown\ncontamination\nof the\nPayload Change-out\nRoom, or any other payload processing\nfacility.\nAnother recommendation presentedby Dr. Greenfield,\nseparatefrom thereport,\nwas thatthepotential\nforcontamination of lIST by a leakingOrbiterRCS thrusterbe\nassessed.This issuewas addressed by Dr. Lubert Leger atthe August 6,1993,\nmission statusreview. He believedthatno propellantwould condense onto HST\nsurfacesatthe temperaturespredictedforthemission,and thattherewas no reason\nforconcern. See Mission Director\'secommendation No. 30.\nR\nOn July 28,1993, at the request of the Mission Director, personnel\nfrom the\nMedical Operations\nBranch at JSC presented the results of their assessment\nof\nmedical risks of the HST SM-1 EVAs. They had assessed the risks to EVA\ncrewmembers\nof space motion sickness, decompression\nsickness, metabolic and\nnutrition deficiencies,\ndehydration,\nfatigue, congestion/barotrauma,\ncardiac\ndysrhythmia,\nradiation exposure, and injury/trauma.\nThe risks they believed\nto be\nof the greatest concern were the risk of receiving insufficient\nnutrition on EVA days\nand risk of fatigue. To prevent nutritional deficiencies,\nthey recommended\nthat the\ncrew\'s meal times should be protected and that pre-EVA and optional post-EVA\nsnacks should be provided in addition to the standard in-suit food bar. To help\nprevent excessive fatigue, the doctors recommended\na preflight physical conditioning\nprogram and protection of the Appendix\nK scheduling\nconstraints\nrelated to sleep,\nmeals, and exercise. They also considered it desirable to avoid the performance\nof\nconsecutive-day\nEVAs by a single crewmember.\nThey also recognized\nthe risk of ear\nblockage during alrlock repressurization,\nbut did not feel that any preventive\nmeasures needed to be taken. See Mission Director\'s Recommendations\nNo. 40, No.\n42, and No. 56.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 82: Continue\nthe practice\nof not scheduling\nEVA crewmembers\nto perform\nEVAs on\nconsecutive\ndays. Exceptions\nshould be allowed only on a\ncontingency\nbasis, with the concurrence\nof the crew, the flight\nsurgeon, and the mission management\nteam.\n\n63\n\n[Pre-MIMion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nOn July 29,1993, it was reported that during cargo integration test equipment\n(CITE) testing, errors in the "decom" definitions of all 75 HST discrete measurements\nwere discovered.\nGSFC and JSC used different conventions\nfor numbering bits in\ntheir digital data processing\nusing the Shuttle General Purpose Computer (GPC).\nThe development\nof the mass memory for the GPC to be used for processing\nHST\nmeasurements\nhad to be interrupted\nfor approximately\none month while this\ndiscrepancy\nwas corrected.\nThis type of payload digital data definition discrepancy\nhas occurred repeatedly\nwith various previous payloads.\nA single NASA-wide\nmethod for defining digital data parameters\nwould prevent this problem.\nMission Director\'s\nRecommendation\nNo. 83: Establish a single\nNASA-wide\nset of standards for the definition\nof payload command\nand data parameters.\nOn July 29,1993, a meeting was held to discuss whether any action should be\ntaken in anticipation\nof the possible encounter\nof the STS-51 mission with the annual\nPerseid meteoroid shower.\nThe concentration\nof meteoroids\nwas suspected\nto be\ngreater than that seen on earth in hundreds, if not thousands\nof years. It was\nannounced\nthat the HST control center was planning to reorient the HST to present\nthe least vulnerable\nside of the telescope\nto the meteoroids.\nAfter this meeting, it was\ndecided to delay the launch of STS-51 to avoid the Perseids.\nOn August 3, 1993, Mr. John Young released his memorandum\nAC5-93-22,\naddressed\nto the STS-61 Mission Director. This letter contained\na number of\nconcerns and recommendations.\nMr. Young suggested that the flying of a drill tool\nbe considered\nfor use in boring out any jammed bolts encountered\nduring the EVAs.\nThe Space Shuttle Program later manifested\na type of drill bit called a ball-end mill,\nwhich might be used to try to drill out a jammed bolt. At the suggestion\nof the\nSTS-61 Mission Directors Office, personnel\nfrom JSC\'s CTSD quickly designed,\ndeveloped,\ncertified,\nand flew a rotary impact tool, which was hoped to be able to\nloosen a jammed bolt without causing the debris that would be generated by a drill\nbit.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 84: Continue to develop\nEVA methods to remove jammed mechanisms\nand bolts. Design\ngoals should include\nthe capability\nto impart large forces to the\njammed mechanisms\nor bolts, while transferring\nlittle force to\npayloads\nor other structures.\nMr. Young also suggested\nthat HTVTs be conducted\nwhich accurately simulate\nthe worst expected\nEVA thermal environment\nto verify the EMU\'s capability to\nprovide adequate thermal comfort to the STS-61 EVA crewmembers.\nSuch tests were\nconducted\nto evaluate thermal modifications\nto the EMU and WF/PC handholds\nand\noperating strategies for the EMU\'s temperature\ncontrol valve. An inadequate\nstrategy for the control of EMU temperature was believed to have contributed\n\n64\n\nto the\n\nl_re-Mission\n\nEvents |\n\nuncomfortably\ncold conditions\nexperienced\nby the STS-57 EVA crewmembers.\nThese\ntests showed that the modified hardware and procedures were adequate to keep the\nEVA crewmembers\nthermally\ncomfortable\nduring the expected ST5-61 EVAs. See\nMission Director\'s Recommendations\nNo. 8, No. 9, and No. 85.\nAnother recommendation\nin Mr. Young\'s memorandum\nwas that a modification\nbe developed\nfor the EMU that would completely\nterminate the flow of chilled water\nthrough the liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) at the crewmember\'s\noption. This modification\nwas designed and tested in human thermal vacuum\nchamber testing.\nIt was determined\nto be unnecessary\nfor STS-61 after incorporation\nof other modifications\nto the EMUs and to the EMU cooling-maintenance\nstrategy.\nHowever,\nit is believed that, if the cooling maintenance\nstrategy were not followed\nproperly, resulting in a crewmember\'s\nbecoming uncomfortably\ncold, that the LCVG\nbypass modification\ncould allow the crewmember\nto regain comfort in significantly\nless time than in the present EMU design.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 85: Complete\nthe design of\nand incorporate\nthe liquid cooling and ventilation\ngarment (LCVG)\nbypass into EMUs to be used during potentially\ncold EVAs during\ncritical missions.\nMr. Young also recommended\nthat contingency\nprocedures\nfor all problems\nthat\nare indicated or implied by engineering\ndata from the _\n(such as the nonretractable SA) be trained for and accommodated\nin the planned mission timeline.\nThe SA contingency\nhad previously\nbeen identified by the operations\nteam as being\nneedful of attention.\nMission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 86: For critical EVA\nmissions,\nsubstantial\nearly attention should continue to be devoted\nto developing\nand training for contingency\nprocedures.\nThose\nprocedures\nthat have a reasonable\nchance of being needed should be\naccommodated\nin the EVA timeline.\nAnother recommendation\nfrom Mr. Young was that thorough engineering\nreviews of HST data be conducted\nto ensure that the repair timelines are accommodating what the data tells us we will find. Little is presently known about the\nexpected mean time between failures of the HST components.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 87: Perform a thorough\nanalysis of all available data to understand\nthe probable operational\nlifetime of HST components.\nThe results of this enhanced\nanalysis\ncould then be used to better schedule\ncomponent\nreplacement\non\nHST servicing\nmissions.\n\n65\n\nThe Flight Operations\nReview was held August 3-5, 1993. Results of an analysis\nwere presented which indicated that the HST would likely begin tumbling if a "Norm\nZ" Orbiter reaction control system configuration\nwere used for the approach to FIST\nwithin 400 feet of HST. It was also pointed out during the meeting that, given the\nrequired budget margins,\nSTS-61 had a negative propellant margin.\nOn August 6, 1993, Mr. Brewster Shaw chaired a mission status review at JSC\nfor the management\nof the NASA Office of Space Flight and Office of Space Science.\nMr. Shaw assigned\na number of action items at the conclusion\nof the meeting.\nOne\naction item assigned by Mr. Shaw was the development\nof a SA mission success plan\nthat would give guidance to make the decision of whether to save or jettison a SA\nthat could not be fully retracted.\nThe plan was later developed\nwhich stated that the\nminimum required effective surface area of a SA was 80 percent. The plan stated that\nan old SA jammed with less than 80 percent area available would be jettisoned\nimmediately,\nand one jammed at greater than 80 percent would be saved until the\nnew array was successfully\ninstalled.\nThis plan was tested thoroughly\nin JIS No. 2.\nBecause the flight and ground crews were well trained in this plan, little time was\nlost when one of the SAs did become jammed during the mission and was\nsubsequently\njettisoned.\nAnother action item assigned was to define IMAX camera in-cabin and crew\nrequirements\nand crew requirements\nand crew interference concerns.\nThe amount of\nlMAX crew training required was assessed by the flight crew and others and\ndetermined\nto not be detrimental\nto the other, higher priority crew training. It was\ndecided that the STS-61 crew Commander\nwould determine whether IMAX\nphotography\nwould take place during the flight. If he judged that it would interfere\nwith the HST servicing tasks, he had the option to cancel the filming. This procedure\nworked well during the mission.\nAnother action item was the definition of EMU gloves and LCVG configuration.\nThe excellent work done to develop and incorporate\nthe improved glove thermal\nmicrometeoroid\ngarment has been cited earlier in this report.\nAlso contributing\nto\ncrew comfort during STS-61, were improvements\nin the LCVGs, thermal comfort\nundergarments,\nand procedures for cooling control maintenance.\nAn improvement\nthat was available, but which was not used significantly\nduring the mission, was a\ngreatly improved thermal outer glove.\nMr. Shaw called for a review of all DTOs and DSOs for their impact to crew\nschedules.\nThe $IS-61 DTOs, DSOs, and secondary\npayloads\nwere well managed\nthey did not interfere with the HST servicing\ntasks.\nMission Director\'s Recommendation\nNo. 88: During a Space Shuttle\nmission,\nno DTO or DSO should be conducted\nif it has the potential\nto hinder the crew\'s complete accomplishment\nof the primary tasks.\n\n66\n\nso\n\nI\n\n,\n\nMr. Shaw\n\n,\n\nalso\n\nconfiguration\n\nassigned\n\ncontrol\n\ngo gauges.\n\nThese\n\nactions\n\nprocedures,\n\nissues\n\nIn conjunction\nsession\nnumber\n\n,\n\nthermal\n\nare discussed\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nMission\n\nand\n\nfound\n\nto crew\nanalyses\n\nelsewhere\nStatus\n\nand tool\n\nof Orbiter\n\nfor SA contingencies.\n\nof the rationale\nboth redundant\nThe rationale\n\nEvents\n\nmodification\n\nattitudes,\n\nand\n\ngo/no-\n\nin this report.\n\nReview,\n\nthere\n\nof the\npaths\n\nfor these\n\nwas\n\nheld\n\nan executive\npresented\na\nof HST SM-1.\n\nplans to replace\nof every system\nthree\n\nplans\n\nonly two\non board\n\nwas\n\nof\nthe\n\nreviewed\n\nand\n\nto be acceptable.\nThe\n\nMission\n\nDirector\n\nasked\n\nfor the completion\n\nprocedures\nand timelines\nfor EVA scenarios\nin a shortened\nmission\nand for contingency\nAlthough\nlater\n\naid\n\nchaired\nby the STS-61 Mission\nDirector.\nThe Mission\nDirector\nof actions\nand issues that needed\nresolution\nbefore\nthe launch\n\nOne of these actions\nwas a review\nthe three RSUs, to not fully verify\nHST,\n\nrelated\n\nPre-Mission\n\nvaluable\n\ntake place,\nThe\n\nfor crew\npolicies\n\nsuch\n\nMission\nand\n\nprocedure\n\nDirector\n\nground\n\ncame\n\nalso called\n\npersonnel\n\ndevelopment\n\nfor the\nwere\n\nDirector\'s\n\nespecially\n\nRecommendation\n\nincluding\n\nfive-minute\n\nSpace\nlaunch\n\nand\n\nhardware\n\ncase\n\nof a significant\n\nand\n\nholiday\n\nalternate\n\ndid\n\nplan\n\nand vacation\n\nto January\n\nor later.\n\nNo.\n\nSuch\n\nplans\n\nlaunch\n\nmissions,\n\nwhich\n\nlikely\n\ndevelop\n\nwindows,\n\nmaintenance\n\nFor critical\n\nmissions,\n\nStation\n\ndetailed\n\nand\n\n89:\n\nschedules\n\ncontrollers\n\nfor flight\n\nnot part\n\nMission\n\nDirector\'s\n\ninclude\n\nhours,\nmission\n\nof a formal\n\ncrew\n\nimplement\nsupport\n\nand\n\nsome\n\nteam-wide\n\noperations\na formal\n\nin\n\nmembers\n\nNo.\n\nscheduled\nplan\n\nof management\n\n90:\n\nsleep schedules\nmorning\nhours.\n\nto occur\n\nto facilitate\n\n(including\n\n67\n\nFor critical\nduring\n\nto better\nbe\nThis sleep-\n\nmissions\nnormal\n\nthe sleep-shifting\n\nmanagement)\n\nbefore\n\nto\n\nwere\n\nplan.\n\nRecommendation\n\npersonnel\n\ntraining\n\nof a team sleep-shifting\nplan\nsupport\npersonnel.\nPreflight\n\nreduced\nto allow the personnel\nto voluntarily\nadjust their\nable to support\nthe EVAs, which were conducted\nin early\nwas\n\ncrew\n\nhave\n\ndelay.\n\nwork\n\nschedules\n\nwill\n\nto be followed\n\nasked for the development\nlevels of launch and mission\n\nthat\n\nof a detailed\n\nto be slipped\n\nThe Mission\nDirector\nmaximize\nthe proficiency\n\nshifting\n\nSA contingency\n\ndays\n\nflow.\n\ndevelopment\n\nsimulations,\n\nthe launch\n\nof\n\none or two EVA\nSA retraction.\n\nfor the\n\nlate in the mission\n\ntraining,\n\nin case\n\ndevelopment\n\nfor minimization\nof impact to crew proficiency\nlevels and to personnel\nschedules.\nA plan was developed\nfor crew training\nand some hardware\n\nMission\nonly\n\ntimeline\n\ndevelopment\n\nto be followed\n\na plan allows\nand facilities\nitems.\n\nand\n\nof the\n\nif there were only\nactions for a failed\n\nsleep\nof the\n\nlaunch.\n\n|\n\nI Pro-MiNion\n\nEvents\n\nAnother recommendation\nfrom the Mission Director was that the portable inflight landing operations\ntrainer (PILOT) be manifested\non SIS-61.

It was later decided not to do this, because of their\nimportance\nto the HST mission.\nThe telecon also included\na discussion\nof a lightning\nfire at KSC, which was generating smoke near payload handling facilities, which\ncaused concern about possible HST payload contamination.\nOn August 16, 1993, the HST Project notified STS-61 mission management\nthat it\nwas likely that a task to replace four additional fuses would be added to I-IST SM-1.\nThe first STS-61 JIS was conducted\nAugust 24-25, 1993. This 36-hour simulated\nmission time.line included\nrendezvous\nwith and capture and berthing\nof the HST,\nfollowed by EVA 1. Two of the significant simulated problems were low Orbiter\npropellant margin and a Flight Support System (FSS) berthing\nlatch malfunction.\nA\nnumber of management\nissues arose during the JIS that the Mission Director\ndocumented\nas needing the attention of the Customer Management\nTeam and of the\nMission Management\nTeam. These issues are discussed below in connection with JIS\nNo. 2.\nOn August 27, 1993, an HST Flight Techniques Panel meeting was held to\nperform a safety review of all the HST SM-1 EVA procedures.\nAlthough the goal of\nthe meeting was to obtain safety concurrence\nin all the procedures\nfrom the entire\nEVA commtmity,\nthere was not enough time in a single meeting to address the\nprocedures\nin sufficient detail to satisfy all the concerns of JSC\'s crew equipment\nsafety and mission assurance personnel\n(NS231). The NS231 personnel\naccepted an\naction item to perform their own detailed assessment\nof the procedures\nand to bring\ntheir concerns to the attention of the Flight Techniques\nPanel. See Mission Director\'s\nRecommendations\nNo. 46 and No. 47.\nAn HST fam/liari_tion\n30-September\n1, 1993.\n\nworkshop\n\nfor the news media was held at JSC August\n\n68\n\n[\n\n,,\n\nPre-Mission Events |\n\nJIS No. 2 was conducted\nAugust 31-September\n1, 1993. Its timeline included the\n38-hour period from the night before EVA 2 through post-EVA 2 HST testing.\nAmong the simulated problems presented were an SA secondary deployment\nmechanism\n(SDM) failure, an SA primary deployment\nmechanism\nfailure to stow, an\nOrbiter nitrogen tank leakage, and low SA electrical power output. The Mission\nteam performed\na jettison of an HST SA. Other EVA accomplishments\nduring the\nreplanned EVA 2 included replacement\nof one SA, two ECUs, PDU fuse plugs, and\nSADE-1.\nDuring the first two EVA JISs, there arose a number of management\nissues,\nwhich were documented\nin a September 29, 1993, memorandum\nfrom the Mission\nDirector to the STS-61 Mission Coordination\nTeam. The Mission Director identified\nthe following\nenhancements\nmission itself.\n\nas being\n\nneeded\n\nfor the remaining\n\nJISs and for the\n\na.

More proactive participation\nof the STS-61 Mission Manager and Mission\nDirector in coordinating\nthe resolution\nof real-time issues between\nthe\nFlight Director and HST management\nd. Clearer definition of HST Project Manager and HST Servicing Mission\nManager roles and responsibilities\nduring real-time operations\ne.

Provision\nof succinct backgrounds\nand rationales for mission decisions as\nthey were being communicated\nby the decision makers\nIn early September,\nrevisions were made to the planned timeline for EVA day 1.\nOn the basis of revised timelines\nresulting from WETF evaluations,\nit now was\nreasonable to perform RSU change-out,\nsolar array carrier preparation,\nand changeouts of the ECUs and fuse plugs, all during the first EVA.\nHTVTs of the thermal modifications\nto the EMU and of the WF/PC handhold\nthermal covers were conducted\nSeptember\n10-12, 1993. On the basis of the results of\nthese runs, it was derided that the LCVG bypass modification\nwas not needed for\nSTS-61. This LCVG bypass is discussed more thoroughly\nin connection\nwith Mission\nDirector\'s Recommendation\nNo. 85.\nIn mid-September\n61 inertial measurement\n\nit was decided by the Orbiter Project Office that all three STSunits (IMUs) would be high accuracy inertial navigation\n\n69\n\n[Pre-Mimion\n\nEvents\n\n|\n\nsystem (HAINS) units. This decision was based on the fact that they have a greater\nmean-time-between-failures\nprediction than the older design had.\nThe STS-51 EVA was conducted September 15, 1993. It induded\nevaluations\nof\nthe EVA thermal environment\nexpected to occur during STS-61, and some of the\nhardware and tasks planned for STS-61. The STS-51 EVA crewmembers\nremained\nthermally\ncomfortable,\ndemonstrating\nthat the newly adopted\nOrbiter attitude\nprotocol, combined\nwith careful management\nof the temperature\ncontrol of the EMU,\nwould also likely keep the STS-61 EVA crewmembers\nthermally comfortable.\nThe\nSTS-51 crew provided the results their\nof\nexperienceswith STS-61 hardware and\nprocedures to theSTS-61 crew.\nIn mid-September\nit was determined\nthat the special clips intended to replace\nthe small SADE connector\nscrews were not satisfactory.\nThe small screws would\nhave to be reinstalled\nafter the SADE change-out.\nJIS No. 3 was conducted\nSeptember\nincluded deployment\nof the HST.\n\n28, 1993. It was a ten-hour\n\nsimulation\n\nthat\n\nOn September\n28, 1993, the Flight Requirements\nDocument\nwas revised to add\nthe PILOT DTO and to update the mission priorities.\nDuring the HST flight status telecon on October 1, 1993, it was announced\nthat\nthe RSU change-out\ntasks would be the first ones performed\nduring the first EVA.\nThe crew equipment\ninterface\nFacility on October 3, 1993.\n\ntest (CELT) occurred\n\nin the Orbiter\n\nProcessing\n\nThe final series of NBS training exercises was conducted\nOctober 4-15, 1993.\nThese ten runs offered the EVA crew the first opportunity\nto train using the RMS II\nand the Nitrox breathing system. For the first time, the crew was able to perform the\nEVAs nearly from end-to-end\nwith a high-fidelity\nRMS simulator.\nThe timelines for\nEVAs 1-4 were verified for both the scheduled\npair of EVA crewmembers\nand the\nalternate pair. EVA 5 was not performed\nduring this series. The tasks included in\nEVA 5 involved\nsmaller hardware items and less critical RMS positioning\nand could\nbe accurately verified using part task activities in the WETF. Besides these eight\nnominal procedure\nruns, the crew also participated\nin JIS No. 4 on October 8, and\nperformed\nSA contingencies\non October 15, 1993.\nJIS No. 4 was conducted\non October 8, 1993, the first JIS to be performed\nwith\nthe EVA crew in the NBS at MSFC. This 12-hour JIS included\nEVA 3. Simulated\nproblems included thermal cover interference\nduring the installation of WF/PC II.\nOn October 18, 1993, the Stafford IIST SM Review Team conducted\nits final\nSTS-61 review at JSC. The Mission Director presented to them the status of mission\n\n70\n\nPre-Mission\n\npreparation.\nThe team expressed satisfaction\naccomplish\nthe servicing of the HST.\n\nEven_. |\n\nwith the efforts of the team working\n\nto\n\nOn October 21-22, 1993, GSFC conducted\nits internal flight readiness review\n(FRR). The review board was generally pleased with the level of planning and\npreparation for mission.\nThe board assigned an action item to the HST Project to\nreopen a previously\ndosed problem report on the torque output of JSC\'s mini-power\ntool. The board was concerned\nthat the higher-than-expected\ntorque produced by the\ntool could damage the SADE connector\nscrews. In response to such concerns, JSC\nperformed\nforce tests using the tool to install 100 SADE-type screws and\ndemonstrated\nthat the tool would not damage the screws.\nOn October 27, 1993, STS-61 mission management\ndiscussed the first report of\nsignificant problems mused by the refurbishment\nof Launch Pad A. A pipe downspout immediately\noutside the payload change-out\nroom had been positioned\nsuch\nthat it prevented\nthe opening of the cargo canister. The interfering\ndownspout\nand\nothers nearby which had been added during the refurbishment\nwere cut away to\nremove the interference,\nand the residual pipe openings were plugged and sealed.\nThe use of facilities that have just undergone\nmajor changes _,carries increased\nrisk of\nsuch problems.\nSee the next paragraph and Mission Director s Recommendation\nNo.\n0.\n\nOn October 30, 1993, contamination\noccurred of the PCR on Launch Pad A.\nExtensive investigation\nand planning efforts were initiated to understand\nthe source\nof contamination,\nassess the condition of the flight hardware that was exposed to the\nsand and debris, and develop and implement\ncorrective\naction. Because it had been\ndouble-bagged,\nmost of the payload hardware was not affected, but the ORU carrier\n(ORUC) and COPE were somewhat\ncontaminated\nand were successfully\nrecleaned.\nSand and debris particles, believed to be residue from sand-blasting\noperations\nduring the pad refurbishment,\nhad been blown into the PCR by strong winds.\nThe\nparticles are believed\nto have been on surfaces above the ceiling of the PCR and\nblown into the PCR through gaps in the ceiling or between the ceiling and walls.\nCleaning of surfaces was performed\nin and around the PCRs of both Pads A and B, in\ncase it was decided to move the Shuttle and payload to Pad B for launch. The seams\nand gaps in the ceiling and walls of both PCRs were caulked, taped and covered with\nplastic to ensure no recurrence of the violation of PCR cleanliness.\nAn assessment\nwas made which verified that outgassing of the caulk used would not be detrimental\nto HST surfaces or materials.\nIt was decided to launch the STS-61 mission from Pad\nB. See Mission Director\'s Recommendations\nNo. 79 and No. 80.\nAt the request of the NASA Administrator,\nto provide independent\nassessment,\nvalidation\n\na committee was formed and tasked\nand verification of all the medical\n\naspects of the STS-61 EVAs. The committee was chaired by Capt. E.T. Flynn, the\nCommand Officer of Naval Medical Research and Development.\nThe committee\nalso\nincluded other medical experts and experienced\nEVA astronauts.\nOn November\n3-4,\n\n71\n\ni\n\nI_\'Mi_t\xc2\xb0a\n\nj\n\n_v_\n\n1993, the team conducted\nits formal review of the _1\nmedical management,\nEVA\nplans, EVA history, and current issues. The committee found that the mission plans\nhad adequately\naddressed\nthe medical risks of the STS-61 mission, and that there was\nno medical reason not to proceed with the mission.\nOn November\n5, 1993, the Flight Requirements\n(Revision F) to specify the launch date as December\n\nDocument\n1, 1993.\n\nwas updated\n\nJIS No. 6 was conducted\nNovember 8-10, 1993. It was held before JIS No. 5 due\nto facilities mission support requirements.\nJIS No. 6 was a 59-hour JIS, which\nincluded EVA 4, EVA 5, and HST deployment.\nSimulated problems included a HSP\nstowage problem (requiring the jettisoning of the HSP), an EMU-to-glove\ndisconnect\nproblem (requiring EMU change-ou0,\nand an FSS tilt mechanism\nmalfunction.\nThese\nand other HST and Orbiter simulated problems led to significant EVA replanning\nand to the holding of the HST on the RMS overnight.\nOn November\n12, 1993, the report by the HST Independent\nTest Review\nPanel was released, detailing the results of their assessment\nof the testing and\nverification\nperformed\non the replac_nent\nand new hardware to be installed into the\nHST during STS-61. The panel, led by Dr. Herb Kottler, began its review on October\n13, 1993. The panel concluded that the HST Project had developed\ngood test\nprocedures\nto work around the problems associated with not having the HST\navailable for integration on the ground. They also found that the review and\nverification\nprocess for the mission had worked quite well. They were impressed\nwith the quality and commitment\nof the people working on the mission, and satisfied\nthat the mission was ready for flight. The panel recommended\nthat future HST\nservicing\nmissions give a greater amount of attention to the reliability\nof the HST\nspacecraft\ninfrasffucture\n(power, attitude control, etc.). The panel also recommended\nthat the HS_ Project consider improving\nthe onboard diagnostic capability\nof the\nHST. The panel recommended\nthat a team be formed to capture the HST SM-1\nlessons learned for the next servicing mission team in a living document.\nThe\ndocument should include up-to-date detailed test configurations,\nexperience gained\nin building and testing the servicing\nhardware, changes in procedures,\nand\ntranslations of STS-61 EVA experience\nback into hardware design and test guidelines\nfor follow-on\nservicing\nmissions.\nThe panel also recommended\nthe formation of a\nmultidisciplinary\npanel to investigate\nthe cost and benefit trade-offs\nof upgrading\nthe\nHST simulators.\nJIS\nincluded\ncaptured\nthrough\n\nNo. 5 was conducted\nNovember\n15, 1993.

Trouble-shooting\ndid not identify or correct the problem, but it was\nbelieved\nto be caused by interference from the structural and electrical configuration\nof the Orbiter airlock and would clear up when the EMU was outside the airlock.\nWhile the crew slept at the end of FD2, ground commands\nwere sent to HST to\nstow the high-gain antennas\n(HGAs). Both HGAs were moved to the stowage\npositions, but did not trigger their "ready-to-latch"\nindications.\nPlans were then\ndeveloped\nto perform a video survey of the HST after its capture to better understand\nthe failure of the HGAs to completely\nstow.\nOn FD3, communication\nlished without\nthe inverted\nThe HST was grappled\n\nlinks between\nthe Orbiter\ndata problem that occurred\nby the Orbiter\n\nand the FIST were estabduring preflight testing.\n\nRMS at 2:46:56 AM CST, December\n\n1993.\nVisual inspection\nwarped approximately\n\nrevealed that the old +V2 SA (attached\nto the FIST) was\nas much as the worst-case analyses\nhad predicted.\n\n75\n\n4,\n\n[ Mission Even_\n\n|\n\nAfter assessment\nof the video survey of the HGAs and their latch configurations, it was decided to proceed with latch closure. The HGA latches were commanded to be dosed.\nThe latch on the +V3 HGA dosed successfully.\nThe -V3 latch\nwas able to cage its HGA, but not move it completely to its stowage location. It was\ndetermined\nthat this configuration\nwas structurally adequate to withstand\na reboost\nof the HST.\nDuring EMU preparations,\nit was discovered\nthat two of the four in-suit drink\nbags (IDBs) were not stowed on the Orbiter. Both of the two bags on board developed leaks during the mission.\nThe crew was able to stop the leaks and the bags\nwere usable.\nOn FD4, the first HST SM-1 EVA was conducted.\n\nThe communication\n\nwith both\n\nEMUs was acceptable.\nThe change-outs\nof RSU 2 and RSU 3 were successfully\nperformed.\nThe -V3 aft\nshroud doors could not be closed with the first attempts, and it was decided that the\nEVA crewmembers\nwould proceed with other tasks and would finish the closing of\nthe doors later in the EVA.\nSome solar array carrier (SAC) preparation work was performed\nin parallel\nthe ECU replacement\ntasks. Replacements\nof ECU 1 and ECU 3 were successfully\nperformed.\n\nwith\n\nDuring the change-out\nof the fuse plugs, the crew noticed a different configuration of J-hook pass-through\nthan that expected before flight. The fuse plug changeouts were successfully\nperformed.\nThe -V3 aft shroud doors were eventually\nclosed with the aid of a payload\nretention device (PRD) strap and the efforts of both EVA crewmembers.\nFollowing\nthe EVA tasks, the -V2 SA was successfully\nretracted, but only after\nrepeated commands\nwere transmitted.\nThe +V2 SA retraction was stopped when the\ncrew saw the SA blanket becoming slack as the damaged area of bistem reached the\ncassette. It was decided not to make further attempts to retract it, but to jettison it\nduring EVA 2.\nDuring the overnight planning for EVA 2, there was some uncertainty\nconcerning whether the disconnection\nof the SA diode boxes needed to occur during nighttime so that electrical current from them would be minimized.\nFor this reason it was\ndecided that nighttime disconnection\nwould\non the SAs from either the sun or the earth).\n\nbe performed\n\n(i.e., with\n\nno light shining\n\nDuring the alrlock depressurization,\nthe feedwater switch on the EV3 crewmember\'s EMU was found to have been bumped "on" prematurely,\nwhich, in the worst\n\n76\n\nI\n\nMission\n\ncase,\n\nwould\n\nswitch\nthen\n\ncause\n\nthe EMU\n\n"off" and\nfunction\n\nwaited\n\nsystem\n\na sufficient\n\ntime\n\nto not function.\n\nbefore\n\nturning\n\nThe crew\n\nit back\n\nturned\n\n"on" for the\n\nthe\n\nEMU\n\nto\n\nproperly.\n\nAt the start\ntion from\n\ncooling\n\nEvents|\n\nof EVA\n\neither\n\n2, the\n\nthe Orbiter\n\nEV3 crewmember\n\nor the ground,\n\ncould\n\nbut only\n\nnot hear\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nradio\n\ncommunica-\n\nEV4 crewmember.\n\nIt\n\nwas decided\nto conduct\nthe EVA having\nEV4 relay Orbiter\nand ground\ncommunications to EV3.

It was eventually\ndecided that if a coprocessor\nproblem were to be verified, then the coprocessor\nwould be disconnected\nelectrically from\nthe DF-224, and both would remain in the HST. The data problem was later determined to be a communications\nproblem unrelated to the HST.\nThe reboost occurred early on FD8 and was terminated\nby the crew when the\nOrbiter trajectory was taking longer than expected to totally match the target\ntrajectory. Instead of a resulting circular orbit of 321 nautical miles, the final orbit\nwas approximately\n321 by 320 nautical miles. The STS-61 Lead Flight Director has\ncommented\nthat similar burns in the future should be terminated based on a velocity\ntarget in the Orbiter "X" direction only. During the reboost, the crew was surprised\nby the amount of relative motion between the HST and the Orbiter.\nHowever,\nthis\nrelative motion was within the range predicted by preflight analyses.\nThe SA primary deployment\nmechanisms\n(PDMs) failed to move when commanded to do so before EVA 5. It was decided that the crew would perform the\nSADE change-out\nwhile ground personnel\nwould work on plans for SA PDM\ndeployment\ncontingency\nprocedures.\nDuring the successful SADE change-out,\nfour of the small connector screws\nwere lost, but each of the eight connectors\nwas secured with at least one screw, and\nonly one screw is needed for adequate attachment.\nThe EVA crewmembers\nThe EVA crewmembers\nduring EVA 5.\n\nwere able to manually\nalso successfully\n\nThe EVA crew then installed\n\nthe newly\n\ndeploy\n\ninstalled\n\nfabricated\n\nthe SA PDMs.\n\nthe GHRS redundancy\n\nMLI covers\n\nWhile the EVA crewmembers\nwere doing their final payload\nprocedures,\nboth SAs were successfully\ndeployed.\n\n78\n\nkit\n\nonto both MSSs.\nbay clean-up\n\n[\n\nMission\n\nEvent. |\n\nAdditional\ndata problems\nwere encountered\nfollowing\nEVA 5, which were\neventually\nattributed to a problem with a data interface unit no. 2 (DIU 2) side A in\nthe HST.

Mission\n\nDirector\'s\n\nRecommendation\n\nWe recommend\nthat a formal SAIL test be performed\non payload GPC displays\nusing a payload-provided\ntelemetry\ntape at the earliest opportunity\nsubsequent\nto engineering\ncycle release, and that customer personnel\nsupport this test and\nparticipate in identifying\nand closing out discrepancies.\n\n99\n\n[\n\nPayload\n\n.\n\nOfficem\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe recommend\nthat, in the absence of any network or Orbiter hardware\nchanges that will reliably alleviate the problem with transmitting\n4 kbps DF-224\nmemory dump data on Ku-band channel 2, future missions be planned such\nthat...\n1) DF-224 computer dumps be performed direct via TDRSS, or\n2) the project assess the feasibility of a 32 kbps memory dump format\nthat will allow dumping of the HST computer via the Orbiter PDI\n[payload data interleaved.\n\n.\n\nPresent predictions\nindicate that a reboost will be required on the next servicing\nmission, which in turn will require the SAs to be fully retracted and latched to\nthe side of the spacecraft.\nIt is also believed that an STOCC-commanded\nPDM\nstow is unlikely based on the following STS-61 flight experience:\n1) The switch guards would most probably interfere with a full PDM\nstow, and\n2) During -V2 SDM retraction, the solar array deployment\nmechanism\nslipped outside the PDM stow range.\n\n[SADM]\n\nWe therefore recommend\nthat the next servidng\nmission be planned to include\na manual PDM stow (including\nreplacement\nof the switch guards to the\nNORMAL position) as part of the nominal EVA timeline.\nThe Mission\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n10.\n\nagrees.\n\nThe FIST telemetry\nto be used by the crew that is dependent\non the DIUs should\nbe documented\nin the CSM [Cargo Systems Manual] or other ground document.\nA channelization\ntable would help prevent any future confusion\non the impact\nDILl problems will have on the crew

program should consider relocating the standard switch\nto improve\nflight crew access to critical payload functions.\n\npanel to L10 or Lll\n\nWe recommend\nthat the SSE wiring be modified to telemeter command\nfrom the SSP to the ground via the flexible multiplexer/demultiplexers\non the FSS.\n\nsignals\n[MDlVis]\n\nWe recommend\nthat the standard\nswitch panel harness for the PSP BYPASS\nswitch be modified to feedback a signal to the corresponding\nswitch talk-back\nthat will indicate that the switch output is present.\n\n101\n\n|\n\n[Appendix \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n]\n\n11.\n\nUse of the ESC [electronic still camera] should be considered\nfor future missions\ninvolving\ncomplicated\ntasks which might involve detailed troubleshooting\ntasks.\n\n12.\n\nWe recommend\nthat the PDIP [payload data interleaver\npanel] relay be wired to\na PF [payload operational\ninstrumentation\nMDM-forward]\nMDM discrete to\nallow INCO to configure\nthe ESC interface to the Ku system as required via uplink command.\n\n13.\n\nWe recommend\nthat any agreements\nto transfer technical data between\ncontrol\ncenters be formally documented\nin the JOIP [Joint Operations\nInterface\nProcedures]\nso that such agreements\nreceive broader exposure to and review by\nthe integrated\nops community.\nThe Mission\n\nDirector\n\nagrees.\n\n14.\n\nA JOIP procedure\nmust be written detailing appropriate personnel to be\ncontacted\nfor Ku-band coverage information in the event that off nominal\nOrbiter attitudes prevent the use of the daily Flight Plan.\n\n15.\n\nWe recommend\nthat for future servicing missions the REPLAN and HST\nCOORD loops be assigned an "owner" position to assist in keeping loop\nprotocol and traffic appropriate\nto the loops\' assigned functions.\n\n16.\n\nWe recommend\nthat the SYSTEMS MANAGER\ncustomer position in the CSR\n[Customer Support Room] take more of a lead role in coordinating\nEVA-related\ninputs to the SSP FCT, and, when EVA-related decisions are made that effect the\nhealth and safety of the HST or SSE that these calls be made by the SMM\n[Servicing Mission Manager] or SYSTEMS MANAGER on PRIME OPS fi.e.\nimplement\nthe coordination\nplan

units be more completely\ndocmnented\npreflight for\nthe operations\nteam.\nWe recommend\na reevaluation\nof the EVA indicator\nlight design on both the\nRSIPE and ASIPE [axial scientific instrument

As the ann was deselected,\nan \'_596 PDRS ABE COMM" fault message was received.\nThis "ABE-fault"\nannunciation\nwas attributed to known timing differences\nwhich can occur between\nthe MCIU [manipulator\ncontroller interface unit] and the arm-based electronics\n(ABE) whenever the arm is deselected.\nSimilar spurious messages\noccurred during\nSTS-57 with the same RMS hardware.\nON-ORBIT INITIALIZATION\nactivities were\nresumed as the crew completed\ntesting the D&C [display and control]\nactivating port RMS heater A, and deploying\nthe MPMs [manipulator\nmechanisms].\n\npanel lighting,\npositioning\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT DAY 2\nThe crew performed\nRMS POWERUP to uncradle the arm as they prepared for\nthe RMS CHECKOUT and payload bay surveys.\nSingle, Backup, and Direct drive\ntests were conducted\nfollowed by checks of the RMS hand controllers,\nthe manual\naugmented\nmodes, and the operator commanded\nauto sequence (OCAS) mode.\nAlso, per the PDRS procedures,\ncheckout of the end effector in auto and manual\nmodes was conducted\nalong with a backup payload release test. Backup release\noccurred in 9.5 seconds as observed by the Mission Control Center (MCC) and\nsubsequently\nverified by operator Nicollier.\nAll RMS subsystems\nwere observed to\nperform nominally.\nCompletion\nof the RMS CHECKOUT indicated a fully operational\nrobotic arm,\nand the next order of business for the crew was to perform a survey of the space\nsupport equipment\n(SSE) in the shuttle payload bay. This type of scheduled\ntask\nprovides the RMS operators an excellent opportunity\nto familiarize themselves\nwith\nthe actual on-orbit feel of operating the shuttle arm while simultaneously\nproviding\npost-launch\ninspection services of the payload bay. Arm operators are thereby\nallowed a chance to fine tune their zero-g technique prior to any critical arm\noperations.\nThe arm was maneuvered\nto provide a cursory scan of various areas in\nthe payload bay [e.g., orbital replacement\nunit carrier (ORUC), solar array carrier\n(SAC), scientific instrument protective enclosures\n(SIPE), etc.]. Simultaneously,\nberthing\npreparations\nfor HST were underway.\nAs a matter of convenience\nand\ncoincidence,\nthe arm\'s wrist camera was utilized to monitor portions\nof the pivot-up\nof the Flight Support Structure (FSS) ring. Upon expiration of the allotted time for\nSSE survey, the RMS was cradled, latched, and configured\nto \'q\'emp Monitor mode".\nDuring crew sleep, HST operations\nin preparation\nfor capture and berthing\ncontinued.\nThe STOCC (Space Telescope Operations Control Center) placed both\nHSTs high gain antennae\n(I-IGAs) in the stow position, however,\nthere were no\n\n132\n\nof\n\nPDRS Post Mission\n\nready-to-latch\nindications.\nConsequently,\nthe RMS flight control team began\ndevelop a survey procedure (MSC,-018) to view the HGA area in question.\n\nSumma_\n\nto\n\nORBIT - FLI(_HT DAY 3\nThe arm was powered up in preparation for rendezvous\nand retrieval of the\nfree-flying HST. Payload ID (PLID) 1 was selected for the arm, and an OCAS\n(operator\ncommanded\nauto sequence)\nexecuted by the crew to configure\nthe RMS at\nthe Poise for Capture position.\nSubsequently,\nseveral burns were completed\nby\nEndeavour to continue closing the gap between the Orbiter and HST. In parallel with\nthis activity, the STOCC placed HST into a capture attitude. When the Orbiter\nintercepted\nHST, a relative pitch misalignment\nof about 15 degrees was observed.\nThis misalignment\nwas within the operational\nenvelope of capturing HST. Bowersox\nreported on the A/G loop that the 15 degrees did not present a problem, and the\ncrew proceeded\nto grapple HST\'s +V2 grapple fixture (GFI). Within the MCC, the\nRMS team observed a 17 second grapple and rigidization\ntime. RMS brakes were\napplied as the crew reconfigured\nthe Orbiter DAP (digital auto-pilo0\nand performed\nphoto documentation.\nThe crew used Orbiter Loaded mode with rate hold applied in the X-axis to\nmaneuver the HST/RMS to the FSS Hover position.\nAfter translating to the FSS\nHover position, Nicoll/er adjusted the attitude (mainly yaw) to configure the HST for\nberthing.\nIn an iterative manner, slight corrections\nin the Y axis were made as part of\nthe berthing\nalignment.\nRMS brakes were cycled as PLID 2 was selected in\npreparation for using the FSS target as the operational\nreference frame for mating\nHST to the FSS ring. Within MCC, the Payloads officer reported the HST reaction\nwheels had been Powered\ndown. Berthing was commenced.\nAbout 18 inches above\nthe berth position, Nicollier made some attitude adjustments\nto bias the orientation of\nHST prior to berthing.\nThis was performed\nto take advantage\nof the inherent crosscoupling effects encountered\nwith fine maneuvering\nof heavy class payloads.\nRMS\nbrakes were applied as Story Musgrave reported to MCC the FSS was ready to latch.\nThe three FSS latches were subsequently\ndosed, and the FSS umbilical was\nmated to the connector on HST. RMS Test mode was entered to relieve any strains\non the arm that may have built up during FSS latching.\nNext, End Effector mode was\nentered, and an auto-release\nof HSTs grapple fixture was performed\nto allow the end\neffector to back away from the berthed HST.\nWhile the RMS operators selected Orbiter Unloaded\nmode to begin an HST\nsurvey, other crewmembers\nreconfigured\nthe shuttle\'s DAP for an Orbiter attitude\nmaneuver.\nThe nominal RMS survey of the HST was completed\nin approximately\n26\nminutes.\nAn additional HGA latch survey by the RMS (MSC,-018) was performed to\ndetermine if the -V3 HGA latch was in good configuration.\nUpon viewing the latch\nfrom the starboard side (-V2), the HST customer requested a reverse angle view from\nthe port side (+V2). While in transit from starboard to port, an elbow pitch\nsingularity was annunciated.\nRMS operations\nwere continued without consequence.\n\n133\n\n|\n\nI Appendix\n\nH\n\nI\n\nUpon completion\nof the post-berth surveys, the RMS was maneuvered\nto an\napproximation\nof the M]_ [manipulator\nfoot restraint] Extended Park position.\nPrior\nto crew sleep, a call to the crew reminded them to set the joint switch to "CR1T\nTEMP". This action placed the RMS in a good configuration\nfor overnight park.\n\nORBIT - FLI(_HT DAY 4\nAs the airlock was depressed\nfor the start of EVA 1, the Orbiter\'s robotic arm\nwas maneuvered\nfrom its overnight\nconfiguration\ntowards the cabin. The crew\negress was viewed with the elbow camera while Nicollier hovered the arm above the\nAirlock Ingress/Egress\nposition.\nThe RMS was brought straight down in Orbiter-Z\nto permit an EV (extravehicular)\ncrewperson\nto tether to the arm. Subsequently,\nthe\nEV crewperson\n(a.k.a. EV2) was transported\nby the arm towards\nthe stowed MFR\n(manipulator\nfoot restrain0.\nThe wrist roll joint was aligned in preparation for\ngrappling\nthe MFIL Auto end effector mode was used instead of manual mode to\ngrapple\nthe MFR contrary to the nominal PDRS procedures.\nNo problems were\nencountered.\nAfterward, the arm was repositioned\nto facilitate MFR ingress.\nRMS\nbrakes were applied.\nIn preparation for MFR-attached\noperations,\nPLID 3 was\nselected to provide an EV2/MFR operational reference frame. Changes in the RMS\njoint angle data received in the MCC indicated the EV crewperson\nwas ingressing\nthe\nMFR.\nThe EV2 (Hoffman),\nafter stationing himself on the MFR/RMS work platform,\nwas maneuvered\nby the arm operator towards the aft portion of the payload bay to\nbegin changeout of HST\'s rate sensing units (RSUs). Various RMS maneuvers\nat the\nRSU worksite and between\nthere and the small ORU protective enclosure (SOPE)\nwere successfully\nexecuted throughout\nEVA 1. The SOPE housed the replacement\nRSUs and stored the original RSUs for ground return. Some difficulty was\nencountered\nby the EV crewpersons\nwith closing FISTs -V3 aft shroud doors after the\nRSU swap was completed.\nAs ground teams assessed this problem, Jeff Hoffman\nwas maneuvered\nfor the electronics control unit (ECL0 changeout.\nUpon completion\nof this task, the next EVA job requiring RMS maneuvers\nwas to change some HST\nfuse plugs. After the fuse plug replacements,\nplans called for a PFR (portable foot\nrestrain0 to be installed on HST in preparation\nfor the next day\'s SA changeout\ntask.\nAs Hoffman was procuring the PFR from the payload bay, his movements\nwhile on\nthe arm caused a "PDRS SLIP EP" annunciation.\nSlip messages may be expected\nwhenever an MFR-attached\ncrewmember\nproduces a large jerking motion while RMS\nbrakes are on. With his communications\nto the EVA crew, IVC (intravehicular\ncrewmember)\nTom Akers confirmed\nthe annundation\ncoincided\nwith Hoffman\'s\nmovements.\nRMS maneuvering\nresumed to support installation\nof the PFR onto\nHST. Nicollier carefully avoided the deployed SAs as he positioned\nHoffman to the\nport location for PFR installation.\nHaving completed\nthe planned EVA changeouts\ncloseout commenced\nwith particular focus on dosing\n134\n\nand installations,\npayload bay\nHST\'s uncooperative\naft shroud\n\nPDRS\n\nPost\n\nMission\n\nSununa_\n\ndoors.

Eventually,\na PRD (payload retention device) was strapped across\nthe doors via the doorknobs which allowed Hoffman and Musgrave to cycle the\nmiddle handle latch to successfully\nclose the aft shroud doors.\nWrapping up the EVA, Nicollier positioned\nthe arm near the cabin for EV\ncrewperson\ntool stowage and airlock ingress.\nAs FSS rotation and pivot began in\npreparation for retraction of FIST\'s SA secondary deployment\nmechanism\n(SDM),\nHoffman reported removal of the tether between the MFR and RMS end erector.\nThis was required nightly while the MFR was attached to the RMS to comply with\nOrbiter rapid sating requirements.\nAfterwards,\nthe arm was placed in a good MFR\npark configuration,\nbut the crew quickly realized the RMS was needed to view SDM\nretraction per the Flight Plan.\nCorrespondingly,\nthe arm was positioned\nto support viewing the SDM\nretraction.\nThe -V2 array retraction was completed\nand resulted in requiring a\nmanual stow of the primary deployment\nmechanism\n(PDM) during the next day\'s\nEVA. This could easily be supported by the RMS using nominal PDRS procedures.\nDue to deformation\nof the +V2 SA, Nicollier had to maneuver the arm clear of\nstructural interference\nas the FSS rotated HST with its twisted and deployed\nappendage.\nThe arm was repositioned\nfor viewing as clearances permitted.\nRetraction of the +V2 array was not as successful as the first (-V2) retraction.\nThe\n+V2 array was observed to have kinks and twists prior to HST grapple, so the\nabnormal retraction was not surprising.\nThe HST Project agreed to plan for a manual\njettison of the array during EVA 2. Upon completion\nof SDM viewing,\nthe RMS was\nmaneuvered\nto the MFR Extended Park position and was placed in a good overnight\npark configuration.\nAs the crew slept, MCC controllers\ndeveloped\na viable sequence for the next\nday\'s events. Correspondingly,\nan updated Flight Plan was generated.\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT\n\nDAY 5\n\nThe replanned\nEVA 2 timeline scheduled\njettison of the +V2 solar array (SA)\nand then resumed the nominal SA changeout.\nAgain, as the airlock was\ndepressurized,\nthe RMS was maneuvered\nto the Airlock Ingress/Egress\nposition.\nKathy Thornton ingressed\nthe MFR on the arm, and NicoUier maneuvered\nher\ntowards the SA worksite to install the jettison handle as Akers began to remove the\ndiode box connectors.\nNicollier maintained good RMS operational\nenvelopes,\nand\nthe wrist pitch reach limit was avoided by having an MFR yaw orientation of about\n15 degrees.\nIn anticipation\nof moving Thornton and the +V2 array to the release\nposition, the arm operators established a safe RMS maneuvering\nrate by selecting\nPLID 4 per the PDRS procedures.\nBased on real-time observations,\nNicollier\nproposed an optimum orientation to configure\nThornton and the RMS for SA release.\nThis was reported to the PDRS flight controllers\nwho verified that his proposed\n\n135\n\n|\n\n[\'4PP_\n\n\'\n\ntl\n\n\'\n\ni\n\nmaneuvering\nwas operationally\nviable. Nicollier maneuvered\nThornton and the\narray forward in the payload bay into a release orientation and waited for the release\nwindow.\nWhen the time came, Thornton released the array, Nicollier brought\nThornton down in Orbiter-Z,\nand separation burns were executed.\nThe array was\nplumed by the Orbiter jets causing it to "flap like a pterodactyl".\nAs the abandoned\narray drifted away, Thornton and Akers assumed the task of\nreplacing the +V2 solar array. During installation\nof the diode box connectors\nto the\nnew array, the wrist pitch reach limit was annundated\ntwice as Thornton was\npositioned\nto support the changeout.\nBoth times the arm was quickly reconfigured,\nand RMS operations\nresumed with minimal impact to the EVA. Next, Thornton and\nthe RaMS operator moved the PFR from the SA worksite to the Wide-Field\nPlanetary\nCamera (WF/PC) worksite prior to FSS rotation. Rotation of lIST was needed to\naccess the -V2 SA changeout.\nThe original -V2 array was removed and replaced\nwith\na redesigned\nSA. Preparations\ncontinued\nfor the next day\'s EVA as Thornton\ninstalled an extender onto the PFR to be used at the WF/PC worksite.\nHaving\ncompleted\nthe objectives for EVA 2, Bowersox maneuvered\nThornton\ntowards\nthe\nairlock. Akers and Thornton\nproceeded\nto stow the EVA tools. Akers reported the\nMFR was untethered,\nand Bowersox maneuvered\nthe RMS to the MFR Extended\nPark position.\nThe arm was placed into a good overnight configuration.\n\nORBIT -FLIGHT DAY\n\n6\n\nSimultaneous\nwith airlock depress for EVA 3, the parked RMS was activated\nand maneuvered\nto support airlock egress. Hoffman rode the ann towards\nWF/PC-I\nto install the WF/PC guide-studs\nupon which a WF/PC handhold was installed.\nTo\nestablish\nproper MFR/WF/PC\nhandling rates, arm operators selected PLID 5 during\nthe WF/PC-I blind mate and ground strap demate.\nWith RMS assistance, the EV\ncrewpersons\nremoved\nand reinserted WF/PC-I.\nThis allowed the EV crewpersons\nand arm operators an opportunity\nto familiarize themselves\nwith the on-orbit\nhandling characteristics\nof the large orbital replacement\nunit (ORL0 prior to the\ncritical installation\nof WF/PC-II.\nWF/PC-I was removed again, and as the WF/PC\nwas maneuvered\ntowards\nthe Orbiter\'s\nport side, the RMS wrist yaw singularity\nmessage, "PDRS SING WY", was received twice. RMS maneuvers\ncontinued\nwithout\nincident, and WF/PC-I was temporarily\nstowed above the Orbiter\'s\nport longeron on\nthe aft fixture of the ORU carrier (ORUC). Additional\narm maneuvers\nwere needed\nfor the removal of a second\nupon WF/PC-II.\n\nW-F/PC handhold\n\nfrom the forward\n\nfixture\n\nfor placement\n\nIntegrated EVA and RMS operations continued\nas the radial scientific\ninstrument\nprotective enclosure (RSIPE) door was opened to ready the improved\nWF/PC-II for installation\ninto HST. The handhold was installed on WF/PC-II,\nand\nWF/PC-r[\'s\nblind mate, ground strap, and A-latch were disconnected.\nThe crew\nsmoothly extracted WF/PC-II from the RSIPE. As Musgrave free-floated\nalong HST\nto position himself at the worksite, Nicollier and Hoffman maneuvered\nthe\n136\n\nI\n\nPDRS Post Mission\n\nSununm_\n\n|\n\nreplacement\ncamera towards installation.\nAnother wrist yaw singularity was\nannunciated\nwhile in transit. Nicollier continued maneuvering\nthe RMS without\nexperiendng\nany significant problems.\nThe replacement\nWF/PC-II was first\npositioned\nto allow Musgrave to remove the mirror cover and then was aligned for\nthe insertion task. Insertion of WF/PC-II proo_ded\nwith no problems, and the\ncontinuity\ncheck was successful.\nWF/PC-II\'s handhold was removed and returned to\nthe forward fixture on the ORUC. Next, Hoffman was positioned\nover Endeavour\'s\nport radiator to install the mirror cover onto the old WF/PC-I.\nThen Hoffman was\nrepositioned\nto remove WF/PC-I from its temporary\nstowage.\nAfter aligning the\noriginal WF/PC with the RSIPE, it was inserted and secured into the enclosure.\nThe\nhandhold was removed from WF/PC-I and stowed onto the ORUC aft fixture. With\nadditional RMS repositioning,\nHoffman retrieved the PFR to doseout the WF/PC\nworksite on HST.\nNext, FSS rotation and pivot were commenced\nin preparation for the next EVA\ntask of installing new magnetometers\n(a.k.a. magnetic sensing systems, MSS 1 & 2) on\nHST. The original magnetometers\nwere powered\ndown by the STOCC as Hoffman\nand Musgrave were transported\nto the MSS worksite by the Orbiter arm. New\nmagnetometers\nwere installed on FIST to bypass the ailing old ones. Tests were\nperformed which verified the new MSS 1 and MSS 2 were "alive and functional".\nWhile installing the replacement\nMSS 2, the EVA crew noticed the surface of the\noriginal magnetometer\nhad peeled off in various places. Loose material was\nremoved and stowed by Hoffman as ground controllers\nassessed potential\ncomplications.\nCompleting\nthe day\'s EVA objectives, Hoffman and Musgrave\nrode\nthe arm down toward the Orbiter to begin the payload bay doseout.\nMusgrave\ndetached himself from the arm along the Orbiter\'s port sill while Hoffman was\nmaneuvered\nto the airlock. After completion\nof toolboard stowage and untethering\nthe MFR from the RMS, Nicollier maneuvered\nthe arm to survey the WF/PC light\nseals with the wrist camera. When the inspection was completed,\nNicollier\nconfigured\nthe RMS into the planned overnight park position.\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT\n\nDAY 7\n\nAirlock depress was initiated, and the RMS was positioned\nto support airlock\negress for EVA 4. Once Thornton\ncompleted\ningress of the MFR, the RMS was\nmaneuvered\ntowards the -V2 aft shroud for the High Speed Photometer\n(HSP) and\nCorrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement\n(COSTAR) changeout\ntasks.\nThe arm was stopped momentarily\nas the EVA crew prepared their hardware for the\nchangeouts.\nA "PDRS SLIP WY" message occurred at this time, and the crew\nconfirmed\npost-flight\nthis occurred while Thornton\nwas twisting her body to yaw the\nMFR platform.\nArriving at the HST, the crew proceeded\nto open the -V2 doors. The\narm operators selected PLID 5, and Thornton\nwas positioned\ninto the HST cavity to\nhandle the HSP. The EVA crew and arm operators worked together to carefully\nextract the phone-booth\nsized HSP from the telescope.\nOnce clear of the HST cavity,\n\n137\n\n[Appendix H\n\nI\n\na partial reinsertion was performed to practice the tight maneuvers\nrequired for\ninsertion of the COSTAR. Afterwards,\nthe HSP was extracted again and maneuvered\ntowards\nthe Orbiter port side and attached to the aft fixture on the ORUC. Following\nHSP removal from HST, the wrist camera was used to inspect the multi-layer\ninsulation (MLD within the empty H_ bay.\nNicollier repositioned\nthe RMS towards the axial scientific instrument protective\nenclosure (ASIPE) on the ORUC in preparation for the removal of COSTAR. As\nNicollier maneuvered\nthe RMS away from the carrier, the COSTAR was extracted\nclear of the ASIPE. Thornton rotated the COSTAR, and Akers removed the\nDeployable\nOptics Bench (DOB) cover. COSTAR was then transported\nto the HST\nworksite and inserted into HST. After all the latches were engaged, the wrist camera\nwas used to videotape the worksite for post-flight\ndocumentation.\nMeanwhile,\nthe\nSTOCC reported\na "good" aliveness test for COSTAR. The aft shroud doors were\ndosed, and the RMS was maneuvered\nback to the ORUC aft fixture to retrieve the\nHSP. The HSP was removed\nfrom the aft fixture and oriented above the ASIPE for\ninsertion.\nAfter the HSP was stowed and the ASIPE dosed out, the FSS was rotated\nto support\n\nthe DF224 coprocessor\n\ntask.\n\nClaude Nicollier positioned\nthe RMS near the large ORU protective enclosure\n(LOPE) to allow the EVA crew to remove the new DF224 coprocessor.\nAkers and\nThornton traded places on the MFR. NicoUier maneuvered\nAkers and the\ncoprocessor\ntowards\nthe installation\nworksite at I-IS\'Us Bay 1. After reaching the\nworksite, Bowersox and Nicollier traded places operating the RMS. When the\ncoprocessor\ntask was completed,\nThornton\nand Akers traded places again on the\nMFR. Next, Bowersox used the RMS wrist camera to perform\na video survey of the\nBay I worksite prior to door closure. Upon completion\nof the survey, Bowersox\nmaneuvered\nThornton towards the LOPE to stow the DF224 coprocessor\nhandles.\nNicollier and Bowersox traded places as Thornton stowed the handles and Akers\nprocured MLI from the SSE. The MLI was needed to fabricate MSS covers for the\nHST. Assessments\nby the ground team had identified thermal and contamination\nconcerns due to the peeling surface of the old magnetometers.\nResolution\nof these\nconcerns required the crew to fabricate thermal covers for MSS 1 and MSS 2 from\nscavenged\nMLI. In preparation for EVA closeout, Thornton\nwas maneuvered\nto the\nairlock for MFR egress, tool stowage, and untethering\nthe MFR from the RMS.\nSubsequently,\nthe RMS/MFR was placed in the MFR Extended Park position in a\ngood configuration\nfor overnight.\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT DAY 8\nFor the HST Reboost burn, the RMS was positioned\nto monitor the dearance\nbetween the tilted _\nand the ORUC. Post-bum,\nas the HST and FSS were\nreconfigured\nto support the final EVA 5, the arm was placed temporarily\nnear the\nMFR Extended Park position.\nAs the airlock was depressed,\nthe arm operators\nmaneuvered\nthe RMS into position for MFR ingress. Musgrave climbed aboard the\n138\n\n[\n\nPDRS Post Mission\n\nSummary\n\nI\n\nMFR, and Nicollier maneuvered\nthe arm port towards the contingency\nORU\nprotective enclosure (COPE). After Musgrave retrieved the SA drive electronics\n(SADE) replacement\nunit from the COPE, NicoUier positioned\nhim at HST Bay 7 for\nSADE changeout.\nHoffman stationed himself nearby to assist in the task. During the\ntask, a loose screw drifted away from the worksite out of EV crewperson\nreach\ntowards the payload bay. Looking out the aft flight deck windows,\nthe arm\noperators sighted the screw. Nicollier responded\nquickly and translated the arm to\nchase the free-flying\nscrew. This allowed the EVA crew to recover the loose part.\nThe arm was repositioned\nat the SADE worksite, and the crew continued\ntheir task.\nMeanwhile,\nSTOCC commanding\nto deploy the telescope\'s solar array (SA)\nPrimary Deployment\nMechanisms\n(PDMs) had been unsuccessful.\nThis resulted in a\ndecision to manually deploy the PDMs. The RMS team would provide a work\nplatform for the EVA team with maneuvers\nsimilar to the previous SA changeout\ntask during EVA 2. Executing this plan, the -V2 PDM was deployed\nfirst followed by\nFSS rotation to the 304 \xc2\xb0 position.\nThen, with continued RMS support, the +V2 PDM\nwas deployed.\nThe next task required opening HSTs +V2 aft shroud doors for the Goddard\nHigh Resolution Spectrograph\n(GHRS) repair kit installation.\nAfter the crew\ncompleted the GHRS servicing, the arm was maneuvered\nto obtain close-out\nvideodocumentation\nof the worksite using the end effector/wrist\ncamera. Subsequently,\nthe aft shroud doors were closed, and preparations\nwere made for the next task of\ninstalling the crew-fabricated\nMLI covers over the HST magnetometers.\nTo prepare for the MLI cover installation,\nHoffman tethered himself to the\nMFR/RMS to hitch a ride alongside\nMusgrave on the Orbiter\'s arm. Meanwhile,\nthe\nFSS was rotated for MSS 2 access. Nicollier maneuvered\nboth EV crewpersons\nto the\nMSS 2 worksite.\nCompleting\nthe first cover installation,\nMusgrave and Hoffman\nenjoyed the vantage point afforded by the RMS as from inside the Orbiter Kathy\nThornton\nrotated the FSS for MSS 1 worksite access. Bowersox took control of the\narm to position the EVA team for the second cover installation.\nAfter both MLI\ncovers for the magnetometers\nwere successfully\ninstalled, Bowersox maneuvered\nthe\narm starboard\nto the SOPE to allow Hoffman to egress the arm and begin payload\nbay closeout.\nMusgrave was maneuvered\nto the aft end of HST (-V1) to remove the\nlow gain antenna cover.\nNicollier resumed control of the arm with PLID 3 to transport\nMusgrave\ntowards the aifltxk to begin EVA stowage.\nNear the airlock, a trash bag with a 80"\ntether drifted port beyond Musgrave\'s reach. Nicollier, Bowersox, and Covey\nworked together quickly to assist EV2 retrieval of the items. The equipment\nwas\nrecovered, and closeout of the payload bay continued.\nDuring this activity, a STOCC\ncommand had been sent to deploy HST\'s -V2 solar array. MCC requested the crew to\nconfigure the RMS elbow camera for SA deploy.\nThe crew complied\nwith the MCC\nrequest. Since the elbow camera provided the primary visual cue for positioning\nthe\nRMS for tool stowage in the airlock, Nicollier requested verbal directions from\n\n139\n\n[ Appendix\n\nH\n\n|\n\nMusgrave to continue doseout\nactivity. After all tool operations\nwere completed, the\nRMS was maneuvered\nto the port side of Orbiter bay 5 for MFR stowage.\nMFR\nrelease was performed\nin EE [end effector] manual mode. Subsequently,\nMusgrave\nuntethered the MFR from the arm, and PLID 0 was selected.\nMusgrave clutched the\nhandhold on the RMS end effector and was transported back to the airlock by the\nRMS. Upon alrlock ingress, the RMS was configured\nfor overnight park.\n\nORBIT - FLI(_HT DAY 9\nHST was in good configuration\nfor grapple and deployment\nby the RMS. All\nappendages\nwere deployed\nwith the -V3 HGA dish oriented towards the -V2 axis.\nThis provided good clearance for the R_MS grapple of the +V2 grapple\nfixture. FSS\nlatches were opened, whereupon\nNicollier unberthed HST from the FSS and\nmaneuvered\nthe RMS into the HST Release position.\nThe crew and ground\ncontrollers\nmade final preparations\nfor deployment.\nState vectors were uplinked,\nand Covey readied the Orbiter for the separation\nburns. The STOCC readied HST for\noperational\nfree flight by successfully\nopening its aperture door. Orbiter deadband\ncollapse was commenced.\nWhen the time came for release, the Orbiter was set into\nfree drift. NicoUier executed an end effector auto-release\nand proceeded\nto back the\narm away from HST structure.\nThe SEP 1 burn resulted in a .45 feet per second\nopening rate, and SEP 2 increased the rate to 1.2 feet per second.\nAfter separation\nmaneuvers\nwere completed,\nthe RMS was cradled and latched.\nMinor adjustments\nof the joint angles were needed to obtain the MRL [manipulator\nretention\nlatch] RFL [ready for latch] indications.\nThis was expected due to previous\nflight history of this hardware.\nWith the exception of MPM stowage, RMS\nPowerdown\nwas complete with RMS Heater B active.\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT DAY 10\nRMS Heater A was activated to provide redundancy\nwith Heater B prior to\nuncradling the RMS. An RMS survey of the Orbiter\'s\nwater nozzle was performed\nduring a 10.2 psia H20 dump. Upon completion\nof the dump, the RMS was cradled\nand latched. The MPMs were stowed, and the arm was configured to TEMP\nMONITOR mode with Heater A - OFF and Heater B - ON.\n\nORBIT - FLIGHT DAY 12\nThe RMS was deactivated\n\n4 hours 15 minutes\n\n140\n\nprior to Endeavour\n\ntouchdown.\n\n[\n\nNotes\n\nPDRS\n\nPost\n\nMission\n\nSummary\n\nof Interest\n\nA new technique to cradle the arm was utilized on STS-61 to acquire the MRL\nready-for-latch\n(RFL) indications.\nThis technique was developed\nby RMS Training in\nresponse to previous shuttle flights where minor difficulties\nwere encountered\nin\nmaintaining\nthe indications.\nFirst, the shoulder pitch joint is lowered until the\nforward RFL indications\nappear. Next, the elbow pitch joint is lowered until the mid\nRFL indications\nare set. If the forward RFL indications\nare lost during the elbow joint\nmaneuver,\nthe shoulder pitch joint is adjusted to regain the RFL indications.\nPostflight, Nicollier and Bowersox reported this cradling technique to be very effective\nand helpful.\nFor optimal planning, the baseline mission design should strive for a consistent\nMFR yaw orientation\nto minimize crew reconfiguration.\nAfter a baseline is\nestablished\nadjustments\nm procedures\nmay be made as specific details are\nunderstood\n(e.g., EVA crew arm length and reach, accessibility\nof worksite, EV\ncrewperson\nvisibility, etc.). This simplifies the RMS mission design process.\nDepending\non the specific mission tasks, the tip of the end effector may be the\nbest reference\nframe to use when maneuvering\nan attached EV2 versus the standard\nPOR [point of reference] chosen to represent an imaginary rigid EV crewperson.\nThis\nmay be decided with RMS operator input prior to submission\nof the RMS Level-C\ninputs.\nFor integrated\ntasks involving EVA, RMS, and payload operations\npersonnel,\ncoordination\nbetween PDRS, FAO [Flight Activities Officer], EVA, and Payloads is\nimperative\nto insure there are no operational\nconflicts. Task details must be reviewed\nto determine the viability of the sequence of events. For example, FSS rotation may\nbe required for RMS/EVA\naccess to a particular HST worksite.\nTask transition must\nbe coordinated\namong all affected disciplines.\nClaude Nicollier established\na voice protocol for the EVA crew. This\nstreamlined\nthe communications\nrequired for maneuvering\nthe crewmembers\nattached to the RMS. This is docmnented\nin the reference data section of the PDRS\nOPS C/L, _1\nFlight Supplement.\nMSFC\'s Neutral\nBuoyancy Simulator (NBS) was a very valuable addition to the\nstandard RMS training facilities. A new working mockup of the shuttle robotic arm\n(RMS ID was developed\nin time to support the HST servicing\nmission.\nThe NBS\'s\nlarge volume is the only environment\navailable to date where the RMS operator can\nmaneuver\nthrough nearly the full range of RMS reach while an EV crewperson\nis\nsimultaneously\nattached to the (simulated)\nRMS [Note: JSC\'s WEIT arm geometries\nare constrained\nby the WETFs comparably\nsmaller volume.].\nFor this mission, the\nNBS was the only facility able to provide an environment\nwhere the EVA crew and\narm operators could interact in a near beginning-to\nend simulation.\nAlso, the\ninteraction afforded\nby the NBS between arm operator and EVA crew allowed for\nrefining the RMS procedures\nbased on crew assessments.\n\n141\n\n|\n\n[Appendix H\n\nI\n\nVirtual reality facilities were used pre-mission\nby the RMS mission designer, Sal\nFerrara and the STS-61 crew (Nicollier, et al) to evaluate and refine RMS positioning\nin support of the EVA tasks. This was also helpful in providing\nearly opportunities\nfor the EVA crew and RMS operators to familiarize themselves\nwith the interactions\nrequired for this flight. Additionally,\nin preparation for mission support, flight\ncontrollers were given access to virtual reality facilities providing\nthem with a\n"hands-on" environment\nto familiarize themselves\nwith the highly complex mission.\nTo insert and extract large ORUs, the crew developed\na technique involving\niterative motion between the RMS and the EV crewperson\n(i.e."inchworm"\ntechnique).\nFor example, to remove the WF/PC, Hoffman held the WF/PC in place\nas Nicollier pulled him back a little bit from the HST. Then Hoffman would pull a\nlittle on the WF/PC.\nNicollier would pull I-Ioffrnan back some more effectively\nextending Hoffman\'s reach so that the WF/PC could be pulled some more. This\niterative technique worked very well on-orbit and enabled the crew to smoothly\nhandle various ORUs.\n\nAlbert Y.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\nTo ensure the success of the complex Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, STS-61, NASA established\na number of\nindependent\nreview groups to assess management,\ndesign, planning, and preparation\nfor the mission.\nOne of the resulting\nrecommendations\nfor mission success was that an overall Mission Director be appointed to coordinate\nmanagement\nactivities\nof the Space Shuttle and Hubble programs and to consolidate\nresults of the team reviews and expedite responses to\nrecommendations.\nThis report presents pre-mission\nevents important to the experience\nbase of mission management,\nwith\nrelated Mission Director\'s recommendations\nfollowing the event(s) to which they apply. All Mission Director\'s\nrecommendations\nare presented collectively\nin an appendix.\nOther appendixes\ncontain recommendations\nfrom the various\nreview groups, including Payload Officers, the JSC Extravehicular\nActivity (EVA) Section, JSC EVA Management\nOffice,\nJSC Crew and Thermal Systems Division, and the STS-61 crew itself. This report also lists mission events in chronological\norder and includes as an appendix a post-mission\nsummary by the lead Payload Deployment\nand Retrieval System Officer.\nRecommendations\nrange from those pertaining to specific component\nuse or operating techniques\nto those for improved\nmanagement,\nreview, planning, and safety procedures.\n\n15.
