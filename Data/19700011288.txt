Sealing Joints with Uniform Strews\nDistribution." This program was administered by the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration, George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville,\nAlabama. Mr. William J. Miller was the Contracting Officer and\nMr. H. M. Walker was the Project Officer. Mr. Walker maintained close\ncoordination with WRD during the course of this program, and provided\nvaluable guidance during its conduct.\n\nThis report was released by the authors for publication on 17 September 1969.\nWork was conducted at WRD under the general direction of Mr. Boris Levenetz,\nManager, Advanced Composites Engineering, and Dr. Kenneth R. Berg, Chief,\nStructural Design and Analysis Group. Dr. Harold A. Evensen served as\nPrincipal Investigator, taking over these duties from Mr. Stephen Feher\nin December, 1968.\n\n\'3r\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis study program is part of an effort by NASA to develop\nimproved joint manufacturing and design techniques. Specifically, means\nof attaining uniform adhesive shear stress distributions in double-lap\nbonded joints were investigated, and a joint design criterion was developed.\nFor straight-lap, stepped-lap and scarf joints, this criterion was shown\nto be independent of adhesive properties and adherend shear stiffness.\nIt was shown that reduction of adhesive peak shear stresses can\nbe accomplished if several general design rules"are followed:\n(a)\n\nThe local strains in the adherends must match as\nclosely as possible at each point on the bondline.\n\n(b) The adherend thickness shear stiffness should be\nreduced as much as the overall application constraints\nwill permit.\n(c) The adhesive shear strength should be high; its\nductility should be as high as the overall joint\ndeformation constraints will permit.\nFull exploitation of these reduced peak shear stresses further requires\nthat the shear strengths of the adherends and the adherend-to-adhesive\ninterfaces exceed that of the adhesive.\nThe unique tailoring capabilities of fiber composite materials\nwere shown to be applicable in realizing the optimum designs suggested by\nthe design criterion. With judicious, choice of layup patterns, joint\n\t\nstrength was shown to be improved without affecting the geometry of the\nstepped-lap or straight-lap configurations. Procedures for tailoring\ncomposite adherend properties are discussed in the report.\nIn support of the study, an improved analysis of straight-lap\njoints was conducted, accounting for adherend shear properties and\nadhesive nonlinearities. These factors were shown to be important to the\n\ni\n\nn\n\n41\n\nperformance of adhesive joints in fiber composite materials. A finiteelement program was employed to study the stepped-lap joint and to verify\nthe simplified design criterion developed in this investigation.\nJoint designs developed under this study were fabricated and\ntested. The observed relative strengths were found to be in good agreement with the predicted relative strengths, and the effects of several\nfabrication parameters were noted. A photoelasti.c study was conducted.\nIt was shown that adherend shear deformations preclude accurate determination of adhesive stresses, but the technique is still applicable when\nvisual monitoring of salient features of the stress field is required.\nThis report includes recommendations for improved joint design\nprocedures. A suggested study of the effects of joint fabricatioc parameters is outlined; and a procedure for adhesive characterization, based\non the analytic results, is proposed. Computer programs for analysis of\nlap joints with nonlinear adhesive and finite adherend shear stiffness\nare included in the appendices.\n\nf\n\nii\n\nt\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection\n\n\t\n\nPage\n\nABSTRACT\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n2\n\nPRELIMINARY STUDY\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n1- 1\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n2- 1\n\n.\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\n\n2- 1\n\nSelection of a Brittle Adhesive .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n2- 2\n\nPreliminary Straight - Lap Specimens.\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t\n\n.\n\n2- 6\n\nFinite-Elem nt Computer Study .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t \xe2\x80\xa2\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n2- 6\n\nPhotoelastic Determination of Adhesive Shear Stresses .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\n\n2- 9\n\nSIMPLIFIED JOINT DESIGN CRITERION . \t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\n\n3- 1\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nAnalysis\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t . `\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\nIllustrative Examples\t\n\n3- 2\n3- 7\n\nDESIGN OF STEPPED - LAP JOINTS USING THE SIMPLIFIED CRITERION .\n\n4- 1\n\nBasic Configuration\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n4- 1\n\nAverage-Strain Design Criterion for Stepped-Lap Joints \t .\t .\t .\nJoining of Titanium and Boron / Epoxy Composite .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nFabrication and Testing of Stepped-Lap Titanium-\n\n4- 1\n\nPreliminary Step-Tapered Specimen . \t .\t .\t .\t\n\n3\n\n4*\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t .\t\n\nBoron / Epoxy Joints .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n4- 5\n4-12\n\nJoining of Boron/Epoxy Composite Materials. \t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nFabrication and Testing of Boron/Epoxy Stepped-Lap Joint.\t .\t .\n\n4-22\n4-22\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF ADHEREND SHEAR MODULI AND ADHESIVE\nNONLINEARITIES ON THE STRENGTH OF LAP JOINTS.\t .\t .\t\n\n.\t .\t . .\t .\t .\n\n5- 1\n\nAnalysis of Practical Straight-Lap Joints .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n5- 2\n\nStraight-Lap Joints with Linear Adhesives .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n5- 6\n\nThe Effect of Adhesive Nonlinearity . \t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nA Simplified Design Criterion for Adhesive Bonded Joints\nwith Finite Adherend Shear Moduli and Nonlinear Adhesive\n\n5\n\n.\n\n5- 7\n\nShear Properties.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n6\n\n.\t\n\n.\t\n\n.\n\nDESIGN OF STRAIGHT - LAP, COMPOSITE JOINTS.\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n5-11\n\n6- 1\n\nDesign, Fabrication and Testing of Titanium-Boron/Epoxy\n\n\' 6- 2\n\nStraight.-Lap\t Joints\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .-\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\nDesign, Fabrication and Testing of Boron/Epoxy - Boron/Epoxy\n\nStraight - Lap Joints\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n.\n\n6-- 7\n\n.\t .\t .\n\n6- 8\n\nDesign, Fabrication and Testing of Titanium - Titanium\n\nStraight - Lap Joints\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t\n\n^,\t iii\n\n.\t\n\n.\t .\t\n\n\t\n\n.I\n\nPage\n\nSection\t\n7\t\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \t\n\n. . .\t\n\n. . . . .\t\n\n. 7 - 1\n\n.\t\nThe Simplified Design Criterion . . . . . . . . \t\nEffect of Adherend Shear Modulus and Adhesive\n. . . .\t\n. . . . . . . .\t\n. .\nNonlinearity\t\nEffect of Adhesive, Adherend and Interface\n.\t\n. . . . .\t\nStrengths\t\n. . . . . . . . .\t\n. .\t\nThe Photoelastic Method for Determining Adhesive\n. . . a . . .\t\n. . . 0 .\t\nShear Strength . . . . \t\n. . . . . . .\nSuggested Design Optimization Procedure \t\n.\nThe Tailoring Capabilities of Composite Materials \t\nRecommendations\t\n. . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . \t\n\n7 - 1\n7 - 1\n7 - 2\n3\n7\t\n3\n7\t\n7 - 5\n7 - 6\'\n\nTEST REFERENCES\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix A:\t\n\nPreliminary Survey of Bonded Joint Design\n\nAppendix B:\t\n\nPreparation of Titanium--Alloy Surfaces for\nAdhesive Bonding\n\nAppendix C:\t\n\nLamination Patterns for Boron/Epoxy Specimens\n\nAppendix D:\t\n\nFORTRAN Computer Program for Straight-Lap\nJoints with E 1 t = E 2 t 2 .

The reliability of mechanical joints must be obtained at the expense of material load bearing capability, due\n\nto\n\nthe concentrations of stress in the joint. Adhesive bonding, on\n\nthe other hand,\n\nhas\n\nbe developed (being\n\nthe advantage that any joint strength can theoretically\n\na\n\nfunction of bonded area rather than material notch\n\nsensitivity). However, conventional adhesive joining configurations do not\ntake full advantage of adhesive or adherend capabilities. The lap..joint\nconfigurations usually encountered in adhesive bonding have their origins\n\nin\n\nthe riveted and welded-joint technology, and are not ideally suited to\n\nmatch the properties\n\nof\n\nadhesives. Conventional simple-lap joints, for\n\nexample, often develop less than 20% of the adhesive strength capability\nbecause adherend strain mismatches result in severe adhesive stress concentrations.\n\nSimple expedients,\n\nsuch as adhesive grading and tapering of the\n\ndoublers, have significantly improved adhesive joint behavior, but investigations of these latter approaches have been of\n\nan empirical\n\nnature and few\n\nguide lines for general design of adhesive lap joints have been established.\n\nEffective application of modern adhesives requires development of\nadvanced adhesive joining concepts, designed to utilize both adhesive and\nadherend properties\n\nto\n\nfullest advantage. A fundamental understanding_ of\n\nthe mechanical behavior in adhesive joints\n\nis\n\nnecessary if these\n\nare to be accepted and incorporated into the technology.\n\nL-1\n\nconcepts\n\nThe objective of the research program presented in this reportis the development of manufacturing methods and procedures, as well as\n\nunique\nmethods were\n\ndesign allowables required to obtain optimum utilization of the\ncharacteristics of adhesive or bonding agents. Specifically,\n\ninvestigated during the program for attaining uniform shear stress distribution throughout the bonding agent in the bonded or adhesive joint. A\ncombined analytical and experimental study has been performed to accomplish\nthis objective.\n\nThis study is a sequel to contract NAS 8-2.0376, "Research Study\nof Common Bulkhead and Manufacturing Technology Improvement Program for\nSaturn Stages", 10 July 1967.\n\nIn the earlier study,\n\nit was suggested that\n\noptimum joint designs could be tailored to the environmental, geometric,\nand material constraints of a particular joining requirement. The present\nstudy, initiated 29 March 1968, further investigates this possibility.\nSince the most obvious optimization criterion\n\nis\n\nthe development of uniform\n\nadhesive shear stress, this objective has been pursued with particular\nintensity during the\'program: , --\xe2\x80\xa2-A revised scope of work was approved 21\nApril 1969. This revision was granted in light of findings of the preliminary\nstudy, in which it was found that better adherend strain matching _could be\naccomplished if the adherends were properly varied, not only in crosssectional area, but in cross-sectional tensile modulus.\njoint design could\n\nnot\n\nThis new\n\naspect of\n\nbe fully investigated Lasing homogeneous adherends;\n\nand it was natural, in view Hof WRD background, to consider the unique tailoring capabilities of composite materials as a means of accomplishing the\nrequired modulus changes. An extended scope of work was approved 10 June\n1969 that included the effects of adherend shear stiffness and adhesive nonlinearities on the adhesive shear stress. Since composite materials are\nparticularly amenable to simultaneous tailoring of\n\ntensile\n\nand\n\nshear\n\nstiffness,\n\nthe study ultimately focused on the application of these materials in\nhigh-strength joints. NASA interest\n\nin\n\nprovided an additional stimulus.\n\n1-2\n\njoining of boron-epoxy and titanium\n\nr\n\nThis report discusses the program in two parts: A preliminary\nstudy\n\nthat\n\ncovered effort prior to the revision, and a composite design\n\nstudy that covered the revised program effort. A simplified optimization\nprocedure was developed and has been demonstrated to lead to stronger\nbonded joints. Given the particular geometric and property constraints,\nan optimum doubler geometry and property makeup can be developed.\n\nThis\n\noptimum configuration then serves as a guide for design of the practical\nconfiguration. Designs developed from this criterion have been analyzed\nwith the aid of\n\na\n\nfinite element computer program and have been fabricated\n\nand tested in tensile shear. Using this criterion, joints can be designed\nthat develop lower adhesive shear stresses for\n\nthe same\n\napplied load.\n\nThe photoelastic technique, developed and applied\n\nin\n\nthe prelim-\n\ninary study, has been shown to be most effective in joint configuration\nhaving homogeneous adherends with no abrupt changes in cross-section.\n\nWhen composite\n\nmaterials or materials with low shear moduli are used, the\n\nphotoelastic method gives apparent peak shear stresses that are\n\nsubstantially\n\nlower than the actual. values. With the aid of the analysis developed herein,\nthis technique can still be used\nstresses\n\nin\n\nin\n\nthe practical monitoring of adhesive\n\njoints of simple geometry.\n\nA preliminary survey of bonded joint design was performed and\nis included in Appendix A for reference.\n\n1P\n\nSECTION 2\nPRELIMINARY STUDY\n\nIn this portion of the program, eighteen double -lap joint configurations were designed, fabricated and tested. The results were correlated\n\nwith a\n\nnumerical analysis that was performed\n\nwith the\n\naid of a finite ele-\n\nment computer program. A concurrent photoelastic study , was performed, and\nthe apparent adhesive shear distributions obtained from, this study were\ncompared with those predicted by the finite-element program. A computerized parameter study was performed that\nconfigurations; and a\n\nsimplified\n\ninvolved eleven\n\ndouble-lap joint\n\njoint optimization criterion was developed\n\nfrom basic strength-of-materials considerations.\n\nInformation obtained from this preliminary study led to the\ninvestigation of the applications of composite material to joint design.\nThis will be discussed in a later section.\n\nPreliminary Straight Lap Specimens\n\nPreliminary straight-lap joints were designed, fabricated and\nevaluated for two adhesive thicknesses and two adhesive systems. The\nparameters considered were:\n\n1. Adhesives\n(a) Narmco Type 7343\n(b) Narmco Metlbond 328\n\n2-1\nr\n\n2. Bondline Thickness\n(a)\n\n.004 inch\n\n(b)\n\n.008 inch\n\nTable 2-I and Figure 2-1 summarize\n\nthe joint configurations\n\nand\n\ntest results. In view of the relatively small scatter and high failure\n\nstresses\n\nobtained with\n\nMetlbond 328,\n\nthe decision\n\nwas made\n\nto use this\n\nadhesive in all further studies.\n\nSelection\n\nof\n\na Brittle Adhesive\n\nMetlbond 328 is\n\nparticularly\n\nwell-suited to this study, since\n\nit is a brittle adhesive with a relatively high shear modulus.\n\nWhen tensile-shear tests are used to evaluate the magnitude of\nadhesive shear stress concentrations, it is desirable that the joints fail\nimmediately when the maximum shear stress exceeds the adhesive ultimate\nshear stress. A joint incorporating a ductile adhesive would not fail\nwhen this occurs because peak stresses would tend to be relieved by the\nflow of the adhesive. A brittle adhesive, on the other hand, would\nfracture under the same load condition with very little flow. Typical\n\ndistributions in a brittle\nshown in Figure 2-2. Because of\n\nshear stress\n\nadhesive (a) and a ductile adhesive\n\n(b) are\n\nthe stress relieving action, a\n\nductile adhesive having relatively low yield strength may fail at a significantly higher total applied load than\n\na joint of\n\nthe same dimensions, but\n\nincorporating a brittle, high-strength adhesive. However, if the shear\nstress concentrations could be reduced through proper joint design, the\nhigh-strength adhesive would obviously be the more desirable of the two.\n\nThe properties of Metlbond 328 were evaluated by Berg\n\nIll and are\n\nsummarized in Table 2-II and Figure 2-3. This film adhesive is supplied\non a glass-cloth carrier, and achieves a .005-inch bondline thickness with\na cure pressure of 15-25 psi at 375\xc2\xb0F.\n\n2-2\n\nTABLE 2-1\nSUMMARY OF TENSILE-SHEAR FAILURE TESTS FOR\nSTRAIGHT-LAP ALUMINUM JOINTS\n\nBONDLINE\n\nSPECIMEN ADHESIVE\nMetlbond\n328\n\nLENGTH WIDTH THICKNESS\nt;a\t IN.\n2L IN. b IN.\n\nFAILURE\nLOAD LB\n\nAVERAGE FAILURE\nSHEAR STRESS psi COMMENTS\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.004\n\n7800\n\n3925\n\n328--2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.004\n\n7900\n\n\xc2\xb10.6%\n\n328-3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n.004\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n2\n\n1\n\n7900\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n1\n\n.008\n.008\n.008\n\n8000\n7900\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.004\n\n300\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n1\n\n.004\n.004\n\n305\n440\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.008\n\n640\n\n313\n\nL100-5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.008\n\n590\n\n\xc2\xb14.2%\n\nL100-6\n\n2\n\n1\n\n.008\n\n650\n\n328-1\n\nMounting\nFailure\n\nMe t\'lb and\n328-4\n\n328\n\n328-5\n328-6\n\n1armc o\nL100-1\n\n7343\n\nL100-2\nL100-3\nL100-4\n\nNarmc o\n7343\n\n3970\n+06%\n\n174\n\xc2\xb118.7%\n\nf\xe2\x80\x94 ta\n_T\n-POO\'\n\nDoubler thickness .0625"\nMainplate thickness .125"\nMaterial 2024-T3\nFigure 2-1.

Bulk - Tensile Stress-Srain Curve for\nMetlbond 328 Adhesive Ill.\n\n2-5\n\nPreliminary Step-Tapered Specimen\n\nStep-tapered aluminum joints were designed, fabricated, and\n\nevaluated, using Metlbond 328 adhesive and the two boadline thicknesses:\n.004-inch and .008-inch. Table 2-III and Figure 2 -4 summarize the joint\nconfigurations and test results. One specimen from each group was pre pared for later photoelastic determination of the adhesive stress distribu-\n\ntion. The destructive test results indicated that step- tapering led to only\nsmall (five percent) increases in joint strength, although reduction of\nthe doubler leading-edge thickness is a technique often used to improve\nthe joint strength. It is evident from this result that the variation of\ndoubler thickness must proceed according to a definite rule if the joint\nstrength is to be improved. The criterion by which this and other\nvariations are accomplished is an important goal of this study.\n\nV nice-Element Computer Study\n\nixi,order to evaluate the effect of. specimen geometry, adhesive\nproperties, adherend properties, and boundary conditions on the joint\nd\n\nstrength, a finite element computer program was adapted to the analysis of\nbonded joints. In this preliminary study, a so-called \'three-point" element\n\nwas used as the basic building block. This finite-element ap; roach would\npermit consideration of advanced composite materials in complex joint- \t\nconfigurations, and would provide a verification of the design criteria\ndeveloped in this research program. In application, the joint is simulated\nby -a structure consisting of small triangular elements joined at their\nvertices. The joint stress distributions are then obtained, to a very\n1\n\ngood approximation, by assuming uniform stresses in the triangular elements\nand satisfying the required force and displacement boundary conditions.\n\nA computerized parameter study was performed n the eleven joint\nconfigurations listed in Table 2-IV.

The computer analysis is believed to be more nearly correct in this\ncase, since the classical analysis does not account for the stress-relieving\neffect of adherend shear deformations.\n\nIt is evident, from review of Table 2-IV and Figures 2-5 through\n2-15, that judicious choice of joint geometry, materials and bondline\nthickness can lead-to significant reductions in maximum bondline shear\nstresses. While the stepped-doubler concepts (Cases\n\n3 and\n\n4) produce\n\nlittle improvement over the straight-lap joint of Case 1, the steppedbondline approaches have definite merit. As Cases 5 through 11 demonstrate,\nadhesive shear stresses are further reduced by proper alteration of step\nd-pths and material properties. The aluminum-aluminum combination of Case\n5 (Figure 2-8), for example, will not develop the adhesive strength as\nwell as the titanium boron/epoxy combination of Case 7 (Figure 2-10).\nCase 7 in turn can be improved by changes of step depth, as typified by\nCase 10 (Figure 2-13).\n\nIt should be emphasizedthat the finite element program was not\nconsidered the goal of this preliminary study. The preliminary study, with\nthe aid of this program, has demonstrated the potential benefits to be\ngained from a more practical design criterion that would specify an optimum\nmaterial and geometry combination, given the design constraints. Once this\ncriterion has been developed, the resulting designs can be further evaluated,\nusing this program, if desired.\n\nPhotoelastic Determination of Adhesive Shear Stresses\n\nTwo joints with step-tapered doublers were evaluated nondestructively,\nusing photoelastic techniques described in [2]. In agreement with the finiteelement results of Table 2-IV, the photoelastic evaluation reveals no discernible reduction of maximum stress concentration when the step-tapered doublers\nare employed.\n\nt\ndo\n\n6\n\nY\n5\ni Aluminum\t\n\n.0625"\n\nAluminum\t\n\n4\nT actual\nT average\n\n.0625"\n- ---Fx\n\nCase 1, ta = .004"\n\n3\n\nCase 2, t =.008"\na\n\n2\n\n"0\t\n\n0.2\t\n\n0.6\t\n\n0.4\t\n\n0.8\t\n\n1.0\nX\nL\n\nFigure 2-5.

A typical photostress\napplication is shown in Figure 2-16. Photoelastic material\n\ni5\n\nbonded to\n\nthe outer facing of the doubler, and the quantity actually measured photoelastically is the tensile strain at this surface. According to classical\nanalysis, when the doubler has an infinite shear modulus the adhesive shear\nstress can be obtained from differentiation of the surface tensile stress\n\nQX\t\n\nActually, the finite shear deformations in the doubler cause the\n\nstrains on the outer face to differ from the desired strains at the bonding\nface. Since the "apparent" adhesive shear stress is deduced from the\nderivative of this erroneous measurement, a departure from the actual shear\n\nstress distribution may be expected. This phenomenon is demonstrated in\nFigure 2-17, where possible "apparent" and actual adhesive shear stresses\nare determined from adherend tensile stresses measured on the inner and\nouter surfaces of the doubler.\n\nnite-element comparisons of the tensile stresses at the bondline and at the photoelastic interface are presented in Figures 2-18\nthrough 2-27. Note that the tensile stresses are welt-matched at points\nremoved from cross-sectional changes, but may differ appreciably at steps\neither in the doubler (Figures 2-19 and 2-20) or in the bondline (Figures\n2-21 through 2-27). Even in the straight -lap joint (Figure 2-18, it is\nevident that the character of the peak stresses at the ends of the doubler\ncannot be accurately determined with this technique. Since the adhesive\nshear stresses are deduced from the derivatives of these tensile stresses,\nthe discrepencies can be accentuated even further.\n\nOn the basis of the finite element analysis, it can be asserted\nthat the photoelastic technique has merit when qualitative features of the\nadhesive shear are to be monitored, and when the joint geometry does not\ninclude adhesive steps. Areas of high-adhesive shear stress can be located\nby noting regions of high fringe density in the photoelastic display. The\nuse of the photoelastic technique is questionable, however, when attempts\nare made to actually evaluate these shear stresses.\n\n2-21\n\nt\n\nPhotostress Coating\n\nFigure 2-16.

This assumption is reasonably correct\nfor metallic adhexends, but will be modified later when typical composite\nadherends are studied.\n\nAnalysis\n\nConsider the symmetrical double-lap joint shown schematically in\nFigure 3-28.

This strain\nmatching criterion is actually employed intuitively when leading edges of\ndoublers are tapered \xe2\x80\x94 a common practice. Assuming adherends of like\n\nmaterial, for example, the large load P,..P I\t\n\nin the mainplate at this\n\nleading edge is best accommodated by a very thin doubler.

The abrupt changes of adherend thickness would require diffusion\nof stresses through shear transfer, and Equation (8) would be less accurate\nin these regions. Since finite shear moduli have an attenuating effect\non the adherend tensile strains, the criterion (8) should yield conservative\ndesigns in such cases.\n\nIllustrative Examples\n\nApplication of (8) will be discussed with the aid of several\nexamples. The question will be posed as follows; Given a mainplate of\n\nconstant width b^ specified material properties\t\nand specified geometry\'\nproperties\t\n\nE,(x)^V1(x)\t\n\nt2 (x),92( x )\n\n,\t\n\nEZ(x),v2(x)\n\ndetermine fhe optimum doubler\n\nand/or geometry\t\n\ntl(x),e,(x)\n\n(a) Double-Lap Butt Joint, Straight Mainolate.\nTitanium\n\nIn this case, E 2 = 16x106 pit i, v2=.33,82=0,t 2=\n\nare assumed.

If\nsome freedom i.s allowed in doubler geometry,\nthe compromise design shown in the bottom half\nof Figure 3-31b is a definite improvement over\nthe current-practice design shown in the top\nhalf of Figure 3-3Ib. However, if the currentdesign geometric configuration is a requirement,\nthe only way to achieve the criterion is to alter\nthe tensile modulus continuously along the bond\nline. This, obviously, is impossible for a metallic\ndoubler, but can be approached, at least, if the\ndoubler is of composite construction. This\npossibility will be considered in the next example.\n\n(d) Double-Lap Butt Joint, Stepped Bondline, Standard\nDoubler Geometry\n\nIn this case, no restriction is imposed on the\nadherend modulis and the curve of Figure 3-31a\ncan be applied to the tailoring of these moduli.\nA means of approximating this criterion is represented\nin Figure 3-32. This joint design more fully utilizes\nthe tailoring capabilities of composite materials by\n"grading" the adherend tensile moduli through their\nthicknesses. In this case, the criterion (8) would\nbe considered a guideline; verification of the\nimprovement would be a job for the finite-element\ncomputer program.\n\nThe means for selection of the moduli in example (d) would\nlogically be a practical implementation of (8) .

The moduli\t\n\nF1A\'E,,",F1C,E\t\n\nof the sections\n\nindicated in Figure 4-34c are determined from the properties of the\nNMD-5505 boron-epoxy and SCOTCHPLY 1009-26 plies, and from the prescribed\n0\xc2\xb0 and 90 0 layup pattern for each configuration. The ply properties are\nsummarized in Figure 4-35 and Table 4-VI. The interlaminar shear modulus\nis unknown for layup patterns which are not unidirectional, i.e., for a\n0 1 - 90\xc2\xb0 combination. For computation purposes, the moduli for unidirectional (0\xc2\xb0) patterns were used. Since the order of magnitude of\n\nGzx\n\nis\n\nmore important than an "exact" number, this assumed value will lead to\neGoentially the same conclusions that could be obtained from a more exact\nv Iue .\nConfigurations 1, 2 and 3 have identical geometries, but have\ndiffering raoduli at each doubler cross-section. The mainplate and doubler\nstep depths are equal in these configurations. A comparison of net crosssectional moduli with the optimum moduli determined from the criterion\n(11) are shown in Figure 4 -36. From this figure, it can be seen that\nConfiguration 2 conforms best to the optimum criterion, Configuration 3\nconforms least, and Configuration 1 is an intermediate case. On the basis\nof this comparison, the strengths of these configurations could be ordered\nOPTIMUM-2-1-3, in descending order. It was not practical to design a\nconfiguration that conformed exactly to the optimum because the specified\ndoubler thickness limits the number of 0\' and 90\xc2\xb0 plies available for\n\nmodulus -tailoring in each step. The values shown in Table 4-V can be\nattained, using 0\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0 orientations only. More refined tailoring of\ntensile moduli could be achieved by using other orientations, but serious\ndifficulties with torsional coupling effects and nonlinear stress-strain\nproperties would obscure the intended demonstration.\n\nConfigurations 4 and 5 are joints with near-identical modulus\nratios at the different cross sections; but with differing step depths.\nA comparison of step-depth ratios for Configurations 3, 4, 5 with the\noptimum ratios determined from (11) are shown in Figure 4-37.

In Figure 4-38, the lowest peak stresses and, consequently,\n\n..the highest strength occurs with Configuration 2.

In Figure 4-39, the lowest peak stresses occur\n\nin\n\npeak\n\nConfiguration 5,\n\nwhile Configuration 3 exhibits the highest peak levels. These evaluations,\nobtained from a rather involved finite-element procedure, agree qualitatively\nwith the predictions obtained from the simplified average-strain design\ncriterion (11). With the aid of the criterion (11), it appears feasible\nto develop initial optimum designs of joints in composite materials without\nemploying lengthy, expensive, finite-element parameter studies. Once\nthe basic geometry and properties have been established by this procedure,\nthe finite-element program could then be\n\nused, if\n\nnecessary, to numerically\n\nevaluate the developed joint stresses.\n\nFabrication and Testing of Stepped-Lap Titanium-Boron/Epoxy Joints\n\nThe five confi g urations specified in Table 4-V and Figure 4-34\nwere fabricated and tested to evaluate the simplified failure criterion.\nThe adherend layup patterns are summarized in Appendix C, Table C-1.

The glass backing\ncan be clearly seen on the doublers in this figure. The marks on the\ntitanium mainplates result from a light filing that was done to break\n3 are the\n\ncorners prior to bonding.\n\nThe\n\ntitanium mainplates were\n\netched,\n\nusing\n\nthe procedure out-\n\nlined in both Appendix. B and Reference (8). The mainplates of Configurations\n\n1 and 2\n\nwere subjected to a single cycle of the etch procedure in\n\nAppendix B. The remaining three configurations were subjected to two etching cycles. The\n\nboron /epoxy\n\ndoublers were prepared,\n\nusing\n\nthe simple MEK\n\ndegreasing procedure of C91, omitting the sandblast step.\n\nThe failures for Configurations 1 and 2 are shown in Figure\n4-43. Note that the failure occurs in the adhesive-to-titanium interface.\nThe failures for Configuration 3, 4 and 5 are\n\nshown in\n\nFigure 4-44. In\n\nthese cases, the failure occurs nearly equally in the adhesive-to-titanium\ninterface and in the first layers of the boron-epoxy doublers. Since the\ncomposite shear stress is directly related to bondline shear stress ka\njoints of. this type, the optimization procedure will lead to likewise\nreduced peak shear stresses in the boron/epoxy doublers. Thus, the\naverage shear stresses at failure will still follow the order established\nby the optimization criterion.\n\nThe results of the tensile failure tests are summarized in\nTable 4-VII.

Even with the improvement of strength, Configuration 3 is still\nthe weakest joint, as predicted from the simplified criterion. Moreover,\nthe strength ordering OPTIMUM-2-1-3 for equal step, variable modulus joints\nand OPTIMUM-5-4-3 for variable step joints is in agreement with the order\ndetermined from the simplified criterion.\n\nJoining of Boron/Epoxy Composite Materials\n\nA stepped-lap joint configuration was designed for joining boron/\nepoxy sections, using the stepped-lap criterion (11). The bonding agent\nwas Metlbond 328, as employed in the titanium-boron/epoxy joints. The\ndesign configuration is summarized in Figure 4-45 and accompanying Table\n4-VIII. Since four equal steps were adopted for the design, the minimum\nsection thicknesses were found to be thick enough that the SCOTCHPLY\nreinforcing layers were not necessary. A comparison between the optimum\nE2\nat each cross-section is shown in Figure\nE\t\nand actual modulus ratio\t\n1\n4-46. Note the close agreement, implying a near-optimum utilization of the\nadhesive in this four-step configuration. Failure would be expected to\noccur in the laminate, rather than in the adhesive itself, since the interlaminar shear stress concentrations may be higher than those in the adhesive\nb ondl ine .\n\nFabrication and Testing of Boron/Epoxy Stepped-Lap Joint\n\nThe configuration described\n\nin\n\nTable 4-VIII and Figure 4-45 was\n\nfabricated and tested, and the tentative conclusions drawn from the simplified failure criterion were evaluated. The required layup patterns are\nsummarized in Appendix C, Table C-2. The construction, before bonding, is\n\nshown in Figure 4-47. Note that each joint is made up of four boron/epoxy\nmainplate sections and two boron/epoxy doublers.

The\n\ndoublers were maintained by placing pins in the holes during the adhesive\ncure. The external flashing that is seen in Figure 4-48 was not removed\nprior to testing, since it was\n\ndesired to\n\nreduce\n\nthe possibility of damage\n\nto the bondline.\n\nThe failures for\n\nthis\n\nconfiguration are represented in Figure\n\n4-49. The failure occurs primarily in the layers of the\n\ncomposite adjacent\n\nto the bondline. As indicated qualitatively by the simplified analysis,\nthe joint shear strength is developed to its\n\n.full potential\n\nfor this\n\nfour-step composite configuration.\n\nResults of the tensile failure tests are summarized in Table 4-TX.\nAs in the previous tests on\n\ntitanium- boron/epoxy\n\njoints, the scatter of data\n\nis very small, and the tensile strength (3877 psi) compares very favorably\nwith results obtained by others [11, 121. The strength would improve\nconsiderably, of course, if a ductile bonding agent were used, rather than\nthe brittle one that was intentionally used here. Further evidence that\nfull potential strength is attained can be gained from the analysis in [5]\nand experimental data in [12]. In [5], it is shown that the shear stress\nconcentration factor in the boron/epoxy laminate\n\nis\n\napproximately 2.8. The\n\nadhesive shear stress at the adhesive-adherend interface is magnified by\nthis factor in the boron/epox) plies adjacent to the bondline, implying an\naverage shear stress of 10,850 psi in these plies. This value compares\nclosely with average interlaminar shear strengths reported in [12].\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nimportant to note that the tensile strength of this boron/\n\nepoxy configuration exceeds those of the geometrically similar titaniumboron/epoxy Configurations 1, 2 and 3. On the basis of the comparisons in\nFigures 4-36\n\nand 4-46,\n\nthis is to\n\nbe expected\n\nqualitatively, since agree-\n\nment with the optimum configuration is more nearly achieved: in the\nepoxy\n\njoint.\n\nHowever,\n\nsince\n\nboron/\n\nthe failure modes of Configurations 1 and 2\n\nwere related to the titanium-to- adhesive\n\n4-26\n\ninterface\n\nstrength rather than to\n\nAverage Failure Stress = 3877 psi \xc2\xb1 2.3%\nFigure 4-49.

With increasing application\n\nof composite materials in joints, it is no longer safe to ignore these two\nfacts. The low interlaminar shear moduli of composite materials, along\nwith their relatively low shear strengths, makes knowledge of adherend\nshear deformations and stresses of great practical value to the designer,\n\nwho must strive to fully\n\nutilize the limited shear capabilities of these\n\nmaterials. Using modern adhesives, in fact, the shear stiffness of the\nadherends and adhesive may be nearly the\ntechniques\n\nare incapable of\n\nsame; conventional\n\nlinear design\n\ndealing with this problem. Moreover, since\n\nadhesive flow in regions of high shear stress has teen recognized to\nproduce a strengthening effect on the joint,\nof this effect\n\nis\n\nessential\n\nto\n\na\n\nan evaluation of\n\nmore complete\n\nthe extent\n\nunderstanding of composite\n\njoint behavior.\n\nIn the brief analysis to follow, the adherend\nand adhesive nonlinearities are included in a\n\nstudy of\n\nshear properties\nthe double-lap\n\njoint. Linear adherend properties are assumed, and the adhesive\n\n5-1\n\nis assumed\n\n\t\n\nf\n\nnonlinear but elastic. The resulting stress distributions more closely\ndescribe the response of practical double-lap joints in composite materials.\n\nAnalysis of Practical Straight-Lap Joints\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReferring to Figure 5-50, the equations of equilibrium (1) can be\nseen to be unaffected by the small adherend deformations:\n\ndP l\tbTa\ndx\t\n\n2\t\nCOS 6\n\nbTa\n\n(1), repeated\n\ndP 2\tbTa\n\xe2\x80\x94 _ 2 = bTa\ndx\t\n\nCos 0\n\nIn allowing adherend shear deformations, however, the loads P 1 ,P2 can\nno longer be assumed to be uniformly distributed over the cross-sections.\n\nInstead, the\n\nstresses\t\n\nCI ,c\' 2\tmust be integrated\n\nover each cross-\n\nsectional area to obtain P1,P2,\n\nl\t\n\nP (x)\t\n\nb f^ Q (^,x)d^ = bE f lE (^,x)d\n1\t\n1\n0 1\n0\t\n\n(17)\n\n0\t\n\n0\n\n-t 2\t\n\n-t2\n\np 2 (x) - b f ,Q 2 (a,x)dA = bE 2\nf E2(O ,X)do\n\nwhere\t\n3\t\n\nand\t\n\nare defined in Figure 5-50b.

Further examination\nreveals that (21) is equivalent to assuming linear shear stress distributions\nthrough the adherends. Although not strictly true for composite adherends,\nthe linear variation is an improved approximation to the actual distribution,\nparticularly when the adherends are homogeneous. Refined distributions\nwould provide greater detail, but the essential features of the shear\neffects will be contained in this simplified analysis.\n\nSubstituting the derivatives of (21) into (17) yields the following\nexpressions for P 1( x ) and P 2 (x)\n2\nP 1\t (x)\t\n\nbE , du 10\nl dx\t\n\nt + l dTa\t\n1 G 1 dx\t\n\n1\n3\n(22\n\nP x\t\n\n2 ( )\t\n\nbE (du 20 t 2\n2 dx\t\n\n- 1 dTa\nG2 dx\t\n\nt22\n3\n\nFrom Figure 5-50c the adhesive shear strain Y a is, by definition, equal\nto\n\nYa(x) = u10(x) t - u20(x)\t\n\n(23)\n\na\n\nand its derivative, in terms of T a, is\n\ndY\n\ndYa\t\n\ndu10\n\n1\t\ndTa\t\ndx = to\t\n\na\ndx = dTa\t\n\ndu 2C(24)\n\ndx \t - ax\n\nCombining (22) and (24), we obtain\n\ndY a\tdTa\t\ndTa\t\n\ndx\t\n\n1\t\nbta\t\n\nP1\t\nEtl\n\nP2\t\n\n1\t\n\nE 2 t 2\t\n\nto\n\n5-5\n\ntl\t\n\nt2\t\n\ndTa\t\n\n3G 1 + 3G2 . dx\n\n(\t 25 )\n\n\t\n\n6\nr\n\nDifferentiating (25) and applying the equilibrium relation (1) yields the\n\ngoverning equation for the straight-lap joint:\n\nt 1\tt2\t\n\n2 Ta dYa\ti\t\n\n\td\n\nl\t\n\nd2Ya dTa 2\n\ndT + t (TG + 3G +\n\ndx\t\n\na\t\n\na\t\n\n2\t\n\n1\t\nElt1\t\n\nto\n\n1\t\n\ndT\n\nE2 t 2\n\nT\n\na\n\n2 ( dx\n\n(26)\na\n\nSince the adherend forces are related to the applied load P by the\n\nP\t\n\nrelation P 1 + P 2\t\n\n, the boundary conditions on the shear stress\n\nT a can be obtained directly from (25) :\ndTa dYa\n\n1\t\n\t\n\nt l\tt2\t\n\n1\t\n\n-P\n\ndx d^a + to 3G l + 3G 2 bta\nE2t2)\n^\t\n\nat x 0\t\n\n(\t 27 )\n\nat x L\n\nIP\nbta(T\n\nt1\n\ni\n\nEquation (26) along with boundary conditions (27) can be solved numerically,\nusing a Runge-Kutta procedure in combination with a special extrapolation\nprocedure.

The thicknesses\nare chosen, in each case, so that the cross-sectional stiffnesses EItl,E2t2\nare all equal to 6.25 x 10 6 lb./inch. A comparison of case (c) in Figure\n5-51 and the solution for Cases 1 and 2 in Figure 2-5 reveals good agreement between the finite-element solution and the analytic solution of (26).\nNote in Figure 5-51 that reduction of the shear modulus can lead to considerable reduction of the stress concentration factor, from 5.86 for the\nl \'pseudo-aluminum" joint (e) with infinite shear modulus, to 3.96 for the\nboron/epoxy joint (d) .\n\nThe classical analysis yields stress concentration factors that\nare more conservative than those a\',)tained with the improved model presented\nin this paper.

The criterion (29) reduces identically to the criterion (10)\nfor straight -lap joints, or criterion (11) for stepped -lap joints. Although\nthese properties may greatly affect the shape of the adhesive shear stress\ndistribution, from the designer\'s standpoint the criterion for uniform shear\nstress distribution is governed solely by the adherend tensile moduli and\nthicknesses. It can be shown that this conclusion also holds true for the\nscarf-type joint.\n\nWith a small additional effort, it is possible to design joints\nwith strength properties improved over those designed by classical approaches.\nMoreover, inclusion of adherend shear properties and adhesive nonlinear\nproperties present little difficulty in design of optimum configurations.\n\nt\nr\n\nSECTION 6\nDESIGN OF STRAIGHT-LAP COMPOSITE JOINTS\n\nThe results presented in the previous sections indicate a\npotential\n\nfor improving the\n\nstrength of titanium-boron/epoxy joints by\n\naltering adherend shear moduli: Only with composite materials is it\npossible to simultaneously\nsectional shear\n\nmod *1lus\t\n\ntailor\n\ntensile stiffness E 1 t 1 and the cross-\n\nCl in the adherend. As Figure 5-51 and Table\n\n5-X indicate, a reducL-on in the thickness shear modulus of the adherend\nwould lead to reduction of stress concentrations in the adhesive. One\ntechnique for accomplishing this objective with boron\n\n/epoxy composite\n\nmaterials is the interleaving of glass scrim cloth with the boron/epoxy\nplies during layup. With proper control of this process, the stiffness\nE1 t\n\n1\tcan be maintained constant while considerably increasing the\n\nratio\t\n\nti.\t\n\nSince the glass scrim layers effectively increase boron/\n\nG1\nepoxy ply separation, the increase of t\nthickness shear modulus\n\nis accompanied by a decrease of\n\nG1 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe adhesive Metlbond 328 was used in this study to eliminate\nadhesive nonlinearity effects of the type illustrated in Figure 5-53.\nSince the shear modulus resulting from the interleaving of\n\nscrim cloth\n\nis\n\nnot readily determined, a qualitative study was performed. Strength of\n\na\n\n"base" configuration, containing no scrim layers, was compared with strengths\nof three other configurations with\n\nvarying amounts\n\n6-1\n\nof\n\nscrim.\n\nThe boron/\n\nt\n\nepoxy plies (NM-5505) were all oriented in the same direction (0 0 ) to\neliminate the shear relieving effects of 0\xc2\xb0 - 90 1 layup combinations and\nthe interaction between the adhesive and adjacent plies.*\nDesign, Fabrication, and Testing of Titanium-Boron /Epoxy Straight-Lap\nJoints\n\nFour straight -lap joint configurations were designed and fabricated with l x 1 -inch boron/epoxy doublers and 1-inch wide by 0.252 -inch\nthick titanium mainplates. The boron/epoxy doublers each consisted of\nsixteen plies of NMD\'-5505, oriented unidirectonally, and 0, 8, 16, or 32\nplies of Type 104 glass scrim cloth, depending upon the desired configuration. The layup patterns are summarized in Appendix C, Table C-3, Due\nto the lower modulus and thickness of the scrim cloth fibers, the net\nsection stiffness E1 t1 of the adherend is unchanged by the addition of\nthe scrim cloth, but the interlaminar shear stiffness will be decreased as\nthe number of scrim plies increases. Table 6-XII defines the four configurations with respect to the number of scrim plies.\n\nThe bonded joints are shown in Figure 6-54. Four configurations\nare shown; Each is represented by four specimens. Two titanium etch\ncycles were used to prepare the titanium mainplates. The adherend preparation and bonding procedures have been discussed previously and need not\nbe repeated. On the basis of interlaminar shear modulus alone, the expected\norder of joint strengths is 4B - 3B\t\n\n2B - 1B in descending order.\n\nA useful technique proposed by Boyle (ill consists of placing\n90 boron/epoxy plies on the adhesive-adherend interfaces.\nThis method yields excellent joint strength improvements, but\nalters the effective adhesive properties in a yet-undetermined\nmanner. The effect is believed to be a simultaneous reduction\nof adherend tensile and shear, moduli and adhesive shear modulus\nnear the bondli.ne. Meaningful investigation of the adherend\nshear effects alone requires than only unidirectional boron\nplies be utilized in this study.\n\n6-2\n\nTABLE 6-XII\nBORON/EPDXY-BORON/EPDXY STRAIGHT-LAP JOINT CONFIGURATIONS\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nNUMBER OF\n00 BORON PLIES\n\nNUMBER OF\n104 SCRIM PLIES\n\nCURED DOUBLER\nTHICKNESS,\t IN.\n\n1B\n\n16\n\n0\n\n.072"\n\n2B\n\n16\n\n8\n\n.075"\n\n3B\n\n16\n\n.067"\n\n4B\n\n16\n\n16\n32\n\nI\n\nFigure\n\n6-54.

The associated failure modes were identical, and are represented by the single failed configuration shown in Figure 6-55. As\nTable 6-XIII indicates, the joint configurations can be listed, in descending\norder of joint strength: 4B - 3B - lB - 2B. Since the strengths of\n1B and \'2B are nearly the same, these two configurations actually belong in\nthe same strength category. The joint failure mode, represented in Figure\n6=55, is primarily an adhesive shear failure, but there is some evidence\nof doubler interlaminar shear failure in Configurations 1B and 2B. The\ndouble-etch procedure used to prepare the titanium surfaces has completely\neliminated the titanium-to-adhesive interface failure noted in earlier\ntests.\n\nOn the basis of tests conducted in this study, it can be concluded\nthat the strength of the straight-lap joint can be improved by reducing the\ndoubler shear modulus through the thickness. This modulus - reduction can be\neffectively accomplished using glass scrim cloth, but as Table 6-XIII\nindicates, this cloth must separate each ply of boron. In Configuration\n2B, for example, the scrim separates double plies of boron, with no discernible strength improvement over the all-boron Configuration 1B.\n\nComparison of the tests results in Table 6-VIII and the results\nfor stepped - lap configurations in Table 4 -VII reveal that the simple\nstraight - lap configurations are stronger than the stepped - lap configurations,\neven though their bondline thicknesses are less. This increase can be\nattributed to two factors\n\n(a) The addition of scrim cloth reduces adhesiveshear stress,.\nr^\n\nand\n\n1\n\n(b) The straight doubler is free of shear and tensile stress\nconcentrations induced by steps in doubler thickness.\'\n\nt\n\ne\n\ncn\n\nZ\n\nA4\n\nH\n\nh\n\nO\n\no\n\na\n\nL.n\n\nb\nC7\n\nA\nP4\n00\n\nM\n\nN\n\nM\n\nH\n\nM\n\nLn\n\nN\n\nEa\n\nN\nLn\n\n^\nPD\n\nM\nLn\n\nLn\nU1\n\nb\n\nO\n\nH\n\nW\n\nx\nz^\n\nP4\n\nz\n\na\nO\nPa\n\nIn\n\nN\n^A\n\nH\n\na\n\nH\n\nW\n\n,.a\t w\n\nH\n\nE^\n\nLn\t\n\nW\n\nW\n\nE-1\n\nW^\n\nLnO\n\nNLnO\n\nO 0 L\n\nOOOO\n\ncn\t I \xe2\x96\xba^1 N\nLn\t\nU1 M\n\n-1\nr-4N\nI\t r-1 N\n\nO\t I Ln Ln\nLn Ln\n\n%DU, L O O\n-It\n\nIn v \xe2\x96\xba n o\n\nw In Ln o\n\no a o Ln\nO ll 1\n\nO O O o\n\nnNO\nLn t11 U1\n\nO\t R! u\'1 U1\nU1\n\n%^O \'t O O\nu\'1 U1 u\'1 t.0\n\nLn \'n U1\n\nu1\t\n\nL\n\nn \'C\n\nD\n\nW\n\na\nT\n\nW\n\nH\ncn\n\nz\n\nH\nO\n>4\n\n1\n6\n\nO\nwa\n\nN DNU1\n\nM Ri r-1 N\nLn En U1 U1\n\nrn\n\n^d r-I r-1 N\n\nr-1 N M\n\nr-1 GV M It\n\nrd N M -,t\n\nN\n\nM\n\nW u1 u1\n\nOU1OO\n\nz\nH\nU\n\nr-1 N M\n\na\n\nz\n\nN\n\n0\nH\nP4\nH\n\nU\n\npq\n\nFigure 6-55. Failure in ilLanium- lip r.jn/Epoxy\nStraight-Lap Joints.\n\n6-6\n\nBecause of the latter effect, the interlaminar shear stresses are reduced,\npermitting more complete development of adhesive shear strength in the\nstraight-lap joint. The predominance of doubler interlaminar shear failure\nin the stepped -lap joint, compared with the adhesive shear mode which\ncharacterized the straight-lap joint failure, substantiates this argument.\n\nWhile introduction\n\nof\n\nglass scrim increases the average joint\n\nstrength, Table 6-VIII makes it evident\nsubject to\n\na higher\n\nthat\n\nthese strengths also become\n\ndegree of scatter (cr,%,). The correlation between the\n\nscatter of test results and the number of glass scrim plies\n\nis\n\nstrong.\n\nThis phenomenon is easily understood qualitatively, since the number of\nply interfaces (regions\n\nof\n\npotential interlaminar shear failure) are\n\nincreased by the addition of scrim. Moreover, the increased uncertain y in\nprocess and layup parameters should also be reflected in these figure\'-.\n\nThe scope\n\nof\n\nthis program precluded more detailed study of the\n\ndoubler shear effect using more scrim plies and various orientation\npatterns. Additional correlation\n\nwas obtained,\n\nhowever, from the study of\n\nstraight-lap boron/epoxy-boron/epoxy and titanium-titanium joints. These\nresults are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nDesign, Fabrication, and Testing of Loron/Epoxy-Boron/Epoxy StraightLap Joints\n\nA straight-lap joint was designed\n\nand fabricated\n\nwith I x 1-inch\n\nboron/epoxy doublers and 1-inch wide by 0.090-inch thick boron/epoxy mainplates.

Since the principal mode was\n\nnot the same as\n\nthe\n\nobserved in the titanium-boron/epoxy specimens, a direct\ncomparison of joint strengths could not be made. Further examination of\nthe failure surfaces revealed that separation occurred in the doubler -tofailure mode\n\nadhesive interface. These doublers were subjected only to the MEK cleaning\noperation, while the\n\nthicker\n\nmainplates were also sandblasted, Even with\n\nthe reduced interface strength, the\n\nstrength\n\nof the joint is still high\n\nenough (4425 psi) to indicate the strengthening effect of the reduced\nadherend shear moduli.\nIf the adherend-to-adhesive interface strength can be improved,\nwhile somehow increasing the doubler interl.aminar shear strength, a joint\nstrength exceeding those observed to date can be achieved. In this event,\nthe failure would occur only in the adhesive. Since currently available\ncomposite materials\n\ndo not\n\nhave sufficient interlaminar shear strength for\n\nthis demonstration, the most promising joint for demonstrating this improvement seemed to be the titanium-titanium joint. With proper surface preparation, the interface strength should be high, while the relatively high\nshear strength of the titanium would preclude adherend\n\nshear\n\nfailure The\n\ntitanium-titanium configuration of the following section was designed to\ndemonstrate this potential strengthening effect.\nDesign,, Fabrication, and Testing of Titanium-Titanium Straight-Lap Joint\n\nA titanium-titanium straight-lap joint was fabricated and tested.\nThe 1\n\nx 1-inch\n\ndoublers were 0.126-inch thick, while the 1-inch wide\n\n6-8\n\nFigure 6-56.

A\nsimplifi-ad joint design procedure has been developed for achieving uniform\nadhesive shear stress, and the effects of adhesive and adherend strengths\nand stiffnesses on the joint strength have been investigated. The photoelastic technique for monitoring adhesive shear stresses has been reevaluated, using a finite-element computer program adapted for this study.\nConclusions and recommendations are enumerated in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe Simplified Design Criterion\n\nA design criterion, based upon the matching of adherend strains\nalong the b ondline, has been developed and evaluated both analytically and\nexperimentally. When all other production parameters are maintained\nconstant, the changes of material and geometry suggested by this criterion\nhave, in the cases tested, Zed to increased strength of symmetrical lap\nbonded joints. In the straight-lap configurations investigated, this\ncriterion is shown to be applicable even when the adherends have low\nthickness-shear moduli and the adhesives have nonlinear properties.\n\nLrrecc or Aanerena 5near Moaulus ana Aanesive Nonlinearity\n\nAnalysis and test results demonstrate that reduced adherend shear\nmoduli can lead to considerable reduction in adhesive peak shear stresses.\n\n7-1\n\n0\n\nFurther reductions can be achieved if the adhesive has greater ductility,\ngiven the\n\nsame shear\n\nstrength. A straight \xe2\x80\x94 forward procedure has been\n\ndeveloped for determining adhesive\n\nshear stresses in\n\ntypical straight-lap\n\njoints, accounting for finite adherend shear moduli and nonlinear adhesive\nshear properties, To the author\'s knowledge, these solutions are presented\nhere for the first time.\n\nEffect of Adhesive, Adherend and Interface Strengths\n\nFailure of the joints tested in this study were of three types:\n\nthe boron/epoxy\n\nlaminate,\n\n(a)\n\nShear failure in\n\n(b)\n\nshear failure in the adherend-to-adhesive interface, and\n\n(c)\n\nshear failure of the adhesive itself.\n\nThe first was related to the\n\ny>i rte shear strength and was of particular\n\nimportance to strength of thO 12.;o,\'O/epoxy joints. The second was directly\nrelated to the adherend surface . preparation. The third was governed by the\ndegree to which the simplified design criterion was satisfied. Joints\nfailing in mode (c) were always strongest; joints failing in mode (b) were\nalways weakest. Improvement of the design by use of the simplified strain\nmatching criterion\n\nnearly always\n\nincreased joint strength,, regardless of\n\nmode of failure. This result indicates that a reduction of peak shear\nstresses has been accomplished,using this procedure Reduction of adherend\nshear strength or degradation of the adherend-to-adhesive interface properties always reduced the\n\njoint\n\nstrength and often affected the failure mode.\n\nEach of these factors had sufficient influence on the joint strength that\nthe benefits gained from improvement of one could be negated by the degradation of another.\nr"\n\n7-2\n\nr\n\nThe Photoelastic Method for Determining Adhesive Shear Stress\n\nThe photoelastic method has been shown to yield only a qualitative\nindication of adhesive shear stress, when used in the manner discussed\nherein. The technique is appropriate where visualization of the adhesive\nshear stress field is necessary, but it should not be used to determine\nthe magnitudes of these stresses. The photoelastic display is in particularly\nlarge quantitative error in regions of high geometric or adhesive-strain\ngradients.\n\nSuggested Design Optimization Procedure\n\nThe optimization of a joint design, subject to given geometric\nand material requirements, can be accomplished by the following procedure:\n\n1. Suitable adhesive materials are selected on the basis\nof critical environmental conditions such as temperature,\nhumidity, corrosive atmosphere, etc.\n2, Adherend geometric and /or material constraints are\nestablished from the overall structural requirements.\nTypical of these would be_"\t\n\nto join titanium and\n\nboron/epoxy of a specified layup pattern --- "\n"-\t\n\nor,\n\nto join two boron /epoxy panels in a specified bond-\n\nline configuration\t\n\n-" or, "--- to join two materials\n\nwith a specified exterior joint geometry\n\n3.\n\nDetermine optimum joint design conditions, using the\nsimplified design criterion (8) , p. 3-7.\n\n4.\n\nDesign joints representing practical approximations to\nthe optimum design, and compare their strengths qualitatively,using the optimum as a reference.\n\nt\n8\n\n5.\n\nbest approximating\n\nSelect the designs\n\nthe optimum.\n\nMake final selections on the basis of adherend shear\nand tensile strengths and the effectiveness of available\nbonding procedures.\n\n6.\n\nDetermine stress distributions in the selected design,\nusing the finite-element computer program\n\nand assumed\n\n(or known) joint material properties. The material\nproperties are, of course, given for the prescribed\nenvironmental conditions.\n\nIn many applications,\n\nthis\n\nlast step is optional.\nThe procedure\nstepped-lap joints:\n1.\n\noutlined above was employed\n\nin the design of\n\nthe\n\nMetlbond 328 was the chosen adhesive, because it\nsatisfied the requirements of high strength, low\nductility and potential for bondline thickness\n\ncontrol.\n2.\n\nThe bondline geometry (four step)\n\nand doubler\n\ngeometry\n\n(flat external surface) constraints were established for\nfabricability and demonstration potential.\n\n3.\n\nemployed in the design criterion\nstepped -lap joint criterion (10).\n\nThe constraints were\n(8) to\n\nobtain\n\nthe\n\nPractical approximations to criterion (10), based on\nthe matching of total strain in each step, led to the\naverage- strain\n\n4.\n\ncriterion (ll), p. 4-3.\n\nFive configurations were designed, and their strengths\ncompared on the basis of (11)\n\nt,\n0\n\n5.\n\nJoints which conformed best to the criterion were\ntentatively judged superior in strength, and would\nhave ordinarily been\n\nchosen for further\n\nstudy. The\n\ntests performed corroborated the choices made.\n\n6.\n\nThe finite-element computer analysis, assuming linear\njoint properties, produced qualitative agreement with\n\nthe\n\nchoices made. Joints which conformed best with the\ncriterion were shown to be stronger in both the analytic\nand the test programs.\n\nThe Tailoring Capabilities of Composite Materials_\n\nThe\n\noptimum design\n\ncan often be achieved only by simultaneous\n\nchange of adherend geometry and stiffness along the bondline. Limited\nadjustment can be performed using metallic materials, but the greatest\nfreedom in design can be achieved with the\n\naid of composite materials.\n\nBy controlling layup patterns and ply properties, adherends have been\nfabricated which closely conform to the optimum property and geometric\nrequirements.\n\nAn effective technique for simultaneously\n\ncomposite adherends\nmoron/epoxy plies. With slight\n\naltering\n\ntensile and\n\nshear stiffnesses in\n\nis the interleaving of glass scrim\n\nwith the\n\neffect on tensile st>ffness, the\n\ninterlaminar shear modulus can be reduced enough to realize significant\nimprovements in joint strength. In practice, this method leads to greater\nscatter of failure strengths\n\nand may\',\n\nin extreme\n\nmode by reducing the adherend interlaminar\n\nshear\n\ncases, alter the\n\nfailure\n\nstrength. Test results\n\nindicate a strong correlation between joint shear strength and the number\nof interleaved scrim plies.\n\nIf\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe analysis developed herein can be used to generate an almost\nunlimited\n\nrange of\n\nparameter studies, demonstrating the effects of joint\n\nmaterial and geometry parameters on the stress distributions\n\nin\n\nthe joint,\n\nThese distributions, in combination with appropriate shear failure criteria,\ncan be used to determine the relations between the design parameters and\njoint strength.

Without the improved\nsurface preparation, however, this scatter increased to 12.2 and 15 percent.

Later elastic analyses were\nperformed by Sherrer (3) (1957), Hahn ane, Fouser (4 ) (1962), and\nLubkin (5) (1957), but it appears that the fundamental elastic\n\nformulation of the problem in most of the later analyses can be\ntraced to the "classical\' formulation of Goland and Reissner. In\nthe Goland-Reissner study, the adherend materials aw y front the\njoint are treated as plates, bent into cylindrical shape by moments\ninduced by the offset tensile loads applied to the joint. Due to\nthe thinness of the adhesive layer, normal stresses parallel to the\nadherends are neglected and the remaining stresses are assumed constant through the adhesive thickness. On the basis of strain energy\nconsiderations \'. two extreme cases are defined: the joint with\nrelatively inflexible cement layer, and the joint with relatively\n\nflexible cement layer. In the former case, the tension stress is\nassumed linearly distributed over each adherend, and adherend shear\nstresses are neglected; i-d-, plane- sections remain plane near the\njoint edge. With these assumptions, solution of the stress distribution in the adhesive becomes a plane- strain problem in the theory of\nelasticity, and is performed approximately.\n\nA-1\t\n\nWPD/3699\n\n\t\n\nIIn\n\n6\n\nJ\n\na\n\nq orJ\n\nThe relatively flexible cement\n\nlayer is treated by assuming; the\n\nadhesive strains large compared with- the adherend transverse formal\nand shear strains. The strain differentials between the adherends\nare related to the adhesive shear strains, and a set of equations in\nthe adhesive st-resse4 is obtained. In this analysis, Goland and\nReissner recogni.::e that analytic rigor could still be maintained in\n\nand adherend materials,\nis not pursued further. This latter analysis forms\nwhich most of the later modifications have sprung.\n\ntheir approach, even for nonlinear .adhesive\nbut the matter\nthe basis from\n\nIts value has been proven in the considerable body of experimentation\nwhich has followed, both destructive (Eickner (6) (1955), Anderson (7)\n(11)\n(1967), Goodwin\n(1963)) and photoelastic (Lobbett and Robb(g)\n(1962), Mylonas (15) (1955) , Tuzi and Shimada (9) 1964-65, Hahn and\nFouzer (4) (1962) , Feher (10) (1967) , and Anderson (7) (1967-68) .\nThese experiments generally agree that, provided the responses remain linear and the cement relatively flexible, the Goland-Reissner\nanalysis provides excellent insight into joint behavior. Most of the\ndiscrepancies have been correlated either with inelastic behavior in\nthe joint or deficiencies in the bonding techniques. It was recognized, for example, that adhesive yield improved joint strength\nthrough redistribution of the resultant stresses.\n1967,\n\nBerg (12) of Whittaker Research & Development extended the\n\nnonlinear stress-strain\n\nGoland-Reissner analysis to include the\nrelation:\n-by\nT0 (y)=a[1-e\t\n\n]\n\nwhere a and b are experimentally determined adhesive properties.\nFor the first time, the effect of\n\nan adhesive\n\nnonlinearity on joint\n\nstrength could be evaluated quantitatively, accounting\nof\n\na\n\nthe material\n\nproperties- a\n\nand\n\nb\t\n\nfor\n\ndetails\n\nBerg\'s analysis constituted\n\nrigorous extension of the Goland-Reissner elastic for,nulation,and\n\nrequired\n\na\n\nstraightforward numerical computation to obtain the\n\nsolution. As such, the approach is readily adaptable to other forms\nof adhesive nonlinearity,\n\nA-2\t\n\n\\\n\n"WPD/3699\t\nN\n\ne\n\nIn addition to material nonlinearity, it was understood that shear\n\nlag in\n\nwould prove\nSince the Goland-\n\nthe adherends, particularly for stepped shapes,\n\nimportant in determination of adhesive stresses.\n\nReissner\n\nresults have generally proven conservative, the need to\n\nrefine the analysis for weight-strength purposes has prompted\ndevelopment of various discrete-element modelling techniques that\n(13)\n(1953), Lobbett\nwould consider adherend shear effects. Cornell\n(8)\n(7)\n(1962), and Anderson\n(1967) have generated discrete\nand Robb\nelement models consisting of springs\n\nand beams,\n\nor shear webs and\n\ntensile rods that yielded much data valuable to the study of joints.\nApplication of the\n\ncomputer\n\nto joints, using the plate element\n\napproach, has not been widely documented. Although a well-established\ntechnique, this form-of the finite element\n\napproach seems\n\nto enjoy a\n\nproprietary status. Analyses of stepped-lap, simple-lap, and doublelap joints have been performed by Feher (1 0 ) , using a plate element\nprogram developed at Whittaker Research & Development in 1968. This\nprogram is now in use in a NASA-sponsored study being conducted by\nWhittaker.\nSeveral adaptations of linear discrete element programs have been\nmade to account for plastic effects in the adhesive (Goodwin (11)\n(1963), for example). These tend to be of\n\nan empirical\n\nnature.\n\nWhile the analytic approaches permit ready formulation, including\nnonlinear effects, for simple\n\nshapes,\n\nthe discrete element approaches\n\nappear best adapted to include shear effects and a variety of joint\ngeometries. A study of nonlinear joints\nrequire\n\nexploitation of\n\nthe\n\npositive\n\nwith complex\n\nshapes will\n\nfeatures of each technique.\n\nDetermination of adhesive properties has been a probicm which has\ndeveloped parallel\nbeen performed for\n\nto the analysis of joints \t\nthe purpose of evaluating\n\nSeveral studies have\nadhesive properties\n\nsuitable\n\nfor joint study. These include both indirect methods\n(14)\n(Kuenzi and Stevens\n(1963), Feher (10) (1967)) and direct\n\nmeasurement techniques (Hughes, Rutherford (16) (1968), Berg (12) (1968)).\n\nA-3\n\nWPD/3699\n\ns\n\n.\n\nIn these studies it has become apparent that observed properties of\n\nthe adhesive are strongly correlated with the properties of the\nadherends. In the practical analysis of joints using these observed\nproperties, it becomes necessary to do one of two things: either\n(a) translate these observed properties into .fundamental properties,\'\n\nthen analyze the joint accounting for the adherend-adhesive interaction of properties, or (b) translate the observed properties into\n"effective" properties, then analyze the joint,usng a somewhat\nsimpler analysis. Each technique requires much iteration between\nexperimental and analytic study in order to verify that the fundamental\nor "effective" properties are appropriate to joint design.\nSome tests, most notably the lap shear test, have been abused in\ntheir application to bonding studies. On the one hand, the joint\nproperties are to be determined, assuming the adhesive properties;\non the other hand, the adhesive properties are to be deduced from the\njoint behavior. In general, the same test cannot be employed to support\n\nthe assumptions used both in joint idealization and in adhesive\ncharacterization - any more than one equation can lead to a complete\nsolution for two unknowns! Either independent tests are necessary,\nor the basic test must be suitably modified to bring out important\nfeatures of the adhesive and the stress distribution separately.\nSimplified design methods have been presented by Szepe (18) (1957),\nby Tombach (17) (1957), and by McCombs, et.al . ( 1 9) (1968), wherein\ndata from a relatively few tensile tests are used to develop\nempirical design curves for a particular joint configuration. The\ndesign techniques mentioned are best applicable to linearly elastic\nadherends and adhesives,using ultimate elastic stress failure\ncriteria. The testing _experience indicates, however,- that linear\n\nis\nfrom . linearity has\n\nrelatively\n\njoint behavior to failure\n\na\n\nde2arturg\n\nimportant consequences with.res,peo.t to\n\nrare occurrence_ and , that\n\njoint strengths .\n\nA-4\t\n\nWPD/3699\n\ns\n^!f\n\nd"\n\nProbably the most graphic description of nonlinear adhesive and\nadherend effects is contained in the recent paper by Wegman, Devine,\n(20)\nLacher, and Anderson\nIn this work, striking experimental\nevidence is presented that strongly correlates joint strength with\nadherend ultimate strength. In double-lap joints of overlap L\nand adherend thickness t , the ultimate cohesive failure load\n\nul t is related to L/ t as illustrated in Figure A-1. Segment I of\n\nP\nthis curve appears dependent solely upon the nonlinear adhesive shear\nproperties, segment TI upon nonlinear local adherend strains, and\nsegment III upon the adherend strength itself. A transition from\nadhesive shear to adhesive peel failure occurs in portion II,\naccompanied by evidence of yield in the adherend material. This\nabrupt transition from adherend-elastic to adherend-inelastic\n21\nbehavior has also been observed by Duke and Stanbridge( ) (1968) in\npeel tests to determine cleavage strength of bonded thin adherends.\nIt is evident from both studies that adherend yield has profound\n\neffects on the apparent strength of adhesive joints.\nApplication of composite materials in bonded joints has been seriously considered lately, in view of the potential weight savings in\naerospace structural applications. In order to realize the potential\nweight savings, however, it is necessary to achieve greater confidence\nin the design technque; i.e., to reduce the safety factors currently\nused in designing metallic joints. Even with homogeneous isotropic\nadherends, the full consideration_ of material properties - so\nessential to full utilization of the joint - has not yet been\naccomplished. The urgent current interest in composite applications\n\nforces the analyst (and the technology) to make a giant step, in\nwhich he must not only analyze the effects of nonlinear material\nproperties, but must also consider a variety of new failure modes\nassociated with layered orthotropic adherends.\n\nSeveral factors combine to make the Goland-Reissner analysis less\napplicable to composite joints than to metallic joints:\n\nA-5\t\n\nWPD/3699\n\n4f\n\nIr\n\npull\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nL/t\n\nFIGURE A-.1.

It\nis generally recognized, however, that composite interlaminar stressstrain behavior is nonlinear, particularly at low strain levels.\nEssential to the prediction of failure in composite joints will be\nthe understanding of the stress distribution in nonlinear layered\northotropic adherends, bonded by a nonlinear adhesive. Adequate\ntreatment of this model of the composite joint has yet to be\naccomplished.\n\nt\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nVolkersen, Von Olaf, "Die Nietkraftverteilung in Zugbeanspruchten\nNietverbindungen Mit Konstanten Laschenguerschn.tten," Luftfahrtforschung,\n\n15, 1988, pp. 41-47.\n2.\n\nGoland, M and Reissner, E., "The Stresses in Cemented Joints," Journal\nof Applied Mechanics, Vol. 11, 1944, ` pp. A17-27.\n\n3.\n\nScherrer, R.
