Has\n456,100 in. 2 of initial surface area and\n1, 102, 000 lb of propellant.\n\nTC-526-04-01B\n\nBasically the same design as configuration A\nexcept that the star was shortened (and the\nforward segment CP section length correspondingly increased) to reduce the initial\nsurface area to 440, 000 in. 2\n\nTC-526-04-01C\n\nNot based on an actual grain design. The propellant weight was assumed to be 1, 095, 000 lb\nand the surface areas were reduced by the\nratio 1, 095, 000/1, 102, 000. The web thickness was assumed to be the same as\nconfiguration A\'s.\n\nTC-526-04-01D\n\nThe grain geometry was assumed to be that\nof configuration A. A burning rate correction\nfactor was applied to the nominal rate of A.\nThis factor rose linearly from 0. 94 at 0% web\nto 1.04 at 50% web back to 0.96 at 100% web.\n\nTC-526-04-01E\n\nModified -01A performance by assuming 1/2\nthe progressivity of A up to 20 seconds. The\nimpulse at 20 sec was made eq1al to that of A.\nThe remainder of the curve was the same as\nthat of A.\n\nFigures 3-50 and 3-51, respectively, depict the grain design of configurations A and

goal.\n3.4.2\n\nMotor Specific Impulse\nOptimization studies conducted during the interim contract period have altered\n\nthe SRM configuration in areas which affect motor performance such as nozzle

performance for various\nnozzle parameters, i.e., initial turning angle (0.), turnback angle (AO), and nozzle\nlength-to-throat radius ratios.\n\nSince the performance loss contributors are influ-\n\nenced by the nozzle design, a method of analyzing the losses for a given nozzle\ndesign was required for the optimization studies.\n\nTC found a convenient method of\n\nrelating total losses (or delivered specific impulse) for various nozzle configurations\nas shown in figure 3-54.\n\nThese curves were fit by a series of equations which have\n\nbeen implemented into the automated design program and are used in motor optimization studies.\n\n(The specific impulse and nozzle geometry parameters given in\n\nTable XXII are a combination of initial and average values.\n\nThus, a comparative\n\nspecific impulse obtained from figure 3-54 is not possible.)\n3.4.3\n\nMinimum Specific Impulse\nSpecific impulse predictability and reproducibility have been evaluated to\n\nestablish the minimum expected motor specific impulse.\n\nMotor predictability\n\naccuracy involved evaluation of historical data for analytical and empirical relationships for specific impulse prediction.\n\nThe analytical analysis evaluates the various\n\nloss mechanism including two-phase losses, divergence loss, heat and friction losses,\nand kinetic losses.\n\nTC has conducted efficiency analyses for in excess of 50 motors\n\nwhich have been static tested.\n\nComparison between predicted and measured specific\n\nimpulse for these motors results in a mean of 0.11 points (i.e., predicts 0.11 points\nhigher than measured) and a standard deviation of 1.58.\n\nThe analytically predicted\n\nmotor specific impulse for the baseline design was 261.5 lb-sec/lb.\nAn empirical evaluation of motor specific impulse using the TC-developed\nmotor efficiency versus propellant flow rate curve yields a motor specific impulse\nof 260.5 lb-sec/lb.\n\nBy performing a curve fit of the measured motor data and\n\nestablishing limits about this curve, the predictability limits can be determined\nstatistically.\n\nThe results of such an analysis indicate that the probability is 90 per-\n\ncent that at least 95 percent of the distribution will be greater than:\n[(Isp vac)] nom -1.33% or [Isp vac] nom -1.33% = Isp vac] min\n\n152\n\nCHAMBER PRESSURE\n\n=\n\n600 PSIA\n\nEXIT

established and performance data becomes\navailable, the motor will have reproducibility limits the same as demonstrated on\nprevious programs, i.e., Minuteman and Poseidon.\n\nHisotrical data have established\n\nspecific impulse limits as 0. 20 % for one standard deviation.\n\nCombining the repro-\n\nducibility and predictability error, the following statement is applicable:\nThe probability is

always reproducible or predictable\n\nand, thus, can create problems particularly at or following web burnout.\n\nThe\n\neffects of erosive burning are amplified at burnout, and the performance difference\nbetween two motors could be most pronounced during tailoff operation.\nof this tailoff variation can be assured if erosive burning is eliminated.\n\nMinimization\nUsing the\n\nSaderholm erosive burning model and evaluating all large motor data available, the\nmost severe erosive environment was experienced by the Titan III M, seven segment motor.\n\nThis motor had a maximum mass flow rate per unit port area (G*)\n\nof 3.1 lb/sec-in. 2 and no erosive burning was experienced.\n\nTherefore, it was con-\n\ncluded that the SRM will not experience erosive burning if a G* of 3.1 is not exceeded.\nA maximum G* limit of 3.1 lb/sec-in. 2 was thus added to SRM internal ballistic\ndesign criteria.\n\nThe port-to-throat area ratio of 1.3 was maintained while motor\n\nlength to diameter values were allowed to vary until the G* limit was reached.\n\n154\n\nTABLE XXIII\nPERFORMANCE INTERCHANGE SUMMARY\n\n* MOTOR SPECIFIC IMPULSE EFFICIENCY\n* THEORETICAL EVALUATION OF VARIOUS LOSS

butadine\n\nrubber (NBR), and the liner is an asbestos-filled HC polymer.\n\nNo insulation or\n\nliner material or process changes have resulted due to the interim study contract.\nHowever, two areas have undergone studies to evaluate conditions which could\neither modify the insulation design or have significant effect on other aspects of the\nSRM.\n\nThese two areas of study are: (1) evaluation of internal case insulation\n\ntemperature at water impact and the probability of generating sufficient steam within\nthe case to result in the case sinking after the steam has condensed and, (2) the\ncost and schedule impact associated with increasing the case aft dome insulation\nthickness for the first two demonstration motor (DM) tests.\n3.5. 1\n\nCase Internal Insulation Temperature Study\nThis study was expanded to include the case, nozzle, and internal case\n\ninsulation heat content at splashdown.\n\nThe thermal analysis considered the heating\n\nduring motor operation, aerodynamic heating, and the added heat content due to\nreignition of the internal insulation as the spent case re-enters the atmosphere.\nThe case insulation was divided into several areas of differing material thickness\nand exposure time.\n\nEach area was thermally analyzed\n\nplots were prepared.\n\nand temperature-thickness\n\nFigure 3-55 presents a typical temperature profile.\n\nThe\n\narea under the curve times, the material density, and specific heat gives the heat\ncontent per inch.\n\nThe heat content for each area was then determined by multiplying\n\nthe heat content per linear inch by the length.\n\nThe same process was applied to\n\nthe nozzle materials to determine their heat contents.\n\nThe results of the thermal\n\nanalysis indicate a maximum internal insulation temperature of approximately 3000 F\nand a maximum nozzle material temperature of 16000 F at splashdown.\nThe total internal case heat available is 771, 543 Btu above a 2120 F reference\ntemperature.\nA conservative SRM vertical velocity of 80 feet per second was used to\ndetermine the depth of SRM submergence and the flow rate of water entering the\n156\n\n700\nV-44

for solid propellant\nrocket motors.\n\nCombustion instability and its attendant vibrations is an area\n\nwhich was largely ignored until recently.\n\nThe inclusion of aluminum early in the\n\nhistory of solid propellants eliminated most of the problems and until recently\nmajor emphasis was not directed at the problem.\nVibration and acoustic data measurement and analysis techniques have been\nimproved significantly during the past few years.\n\nAlso, engineers and technicians\n\nare currently more cognizant of combustion instability indications and are able to\nidentify the modes.\n\nIn the past, potential instability modes were often incorrectly\n\n180\n\ndiagnosed as structural modes.\n\nEarly solid motor program instrumentation was\n\noften not adequate to fully assess motor dynamic environment.\nThe data presented in Appendix A result from researching published\nreports, Thiokol engineering files, and, in some cases, reanalyzing the FM\nrecorded motor firing data.\n\nAnalysis of the limited data available indicates\n\ncombustion instability was not present in any of the 156-in. motors fired at\nThiokol.\n\nA detailed investigation of non-Thiokol fired motors is possible, but\n\naccess to the original raw data is necessary.\n\n181\n\n5.0\n\nLAUNCH SITE ASSEMBLY AND STACKUP TOLERANCE\nThe SRM assembly tolerance analysis was reviewed to determine the max-\n\nimum possible displacement of the SRM centerline.\n\nResults indicate that the\n\nmaximum lateral displacement could be as much as 0.625 in. for Configuration 1-1\nif the case segment tolerances were stacked in the worst possible manner.\n\nA\n\nstatistical treatment of the tolerances, assuming a random ordering of the tolerance\ncombinations, indicated a more probable lateral displacement would be 0.177 in.\nThe maximum offset of the true centerline of Configuration 1-1, due to\nangular offset, diameter offset, and runout tolerances, is shown on figure 5-1.\nThe simplifying assumption made in the calculations is that the case segments are\nrectangular in cross-section rather than circular.\n\nThis reduces the analysis to\n\na two-dimensional problem thus ignoring the complexity of including the location of\nthe dimensional variations relative to the axis of the segments.\n\nThe maximum\n\ncenterline offset due to the maximum possible difference between segments is\nshown on figure 5-2.\n\nThe dimensions used in these calculations are tabulated below:\n\nAt O-ring Groove Area\nTang ID\n\n144. 613 + 0. 004\n\nClevis OD\n\n144. 603 + 0.

Identical angular offset values are obtained by considering separate\nangles affecting summed SRM segment lengths.\n\nHowever, the proper technique\n\nfor computing the random combination of independent items is to consider the\nseparate angles affecting the summed SRM segments.\n\nThe results of these calcu-\n\nlations, as shown on Table XXX, indicate the more probable angular offset for the\nstacked SRM case components is 0.1735 in. instead of 0. 4709 in.\nIt is recognized that both treatments of the maximum offset question\nare quite cursory, and the results are only adequate for initial evaluation purposes.\nA much more detailed analysis, probably involving a Monte-Carlo simulation,\nwill have to be conducted to determine the expected variation in offset during SRM\nassembly at the launch site.\n185\n\nA\n\nIA\n\n-\n\n0.005\n0.005\n\n-\n\n0.005\n\nFWD SKIRT\nINDEX SLOT\n\nS\n\nFORWARD SKIRT\nINDEX SLOT\n- 0. 005\n\n-0.005\nS\n\n-0.005\nI\n\n-\n\n-0.005\n\nAFT SKIRT\nINDEX SLOT\n\n0.055 ARC LENGTH\n00 - 2\' - 31"\n--0.005\n\nATTACH RING\n\nVIEW A-A\n\n4\n\n-0.005\n\n-\n\n0.005\n\nAFT SKIRT\n\nINDEX SLOT\n\n- 0.005\n\nFigure 5-3.\n\nRotational Maximum Misalignment\n186\n\nTABLE XXX\nANGULAR OFFSET\n(IN.)\nSegment\nNumber\n11\n\nSegment\nLength\n\nSum of\nLengths\n\n15.17\n\nSum of Lengths\nx (0.010/146)\n\n15.17\n\n0.0010\n\n10\n\n156\n\n171.17\n\n0.0117\n\n9\n\n156\n\n327.17\n\n0.0224\n\n8\n\n156\n\n483.17\n\n0.0331\n\n7,\n\n156\n\n639.17\n\n0.0438\n\n6\n\n156\n\n795.17\n\n0.0545\n\n5\n\n156\n\n951.17\n\n0.0651\n\n4\n\n86\n\n1,037.17\n\n0.0710\n\n3\n\n127\n\n1,164.17\n\n0.0797\n\n2\n\n127\n\n1,291.17\n\n0.0884\n\nSum\n\n0.4709\n\nSquare root of sum of squares\n\n0. 1735\n\n187\n\n6.0\n\nSRM DDT&E SCHEDULE\nSRM project planning and development of DDT&E Schedules during this\n\ninterim contract are based on MSFC supplied milestones, discussions with major\ncomponent suppliers, and modifications to the RFP or the Thiokol proposal baseline\nschedule.\n\nThe major changes which have occurred to influence the schedule include\n\nSRM ATP slip, PDR and CDR slip, FMOF slip, increase in the number of development\nand qualification motors, decrease in the number of ground test articles, and increase\nin component lead times.\nThe SRM case represents the most critical path, and case lead times paces\nthe SRM project.\n\nDiscussions with potential case subcontractor and forging suppliers\n\nhave supplied current lead time outlook which is incorporated into the schedule shown\nin figure 6-1 . This schedule reflects case steel being placed on order in April 1974.\nThe Ladish Company has placed D6AC steel billets on order with Latrobe and Republic\nSteel Companies.\n\nCommitment of dollars to support these orders is not required\n\nuntil September-October 1974 time period.\nNozzle steel material lead time is the second most critical path and lags\nthe case by approximately one month.\nDuring the interim contract period, NASA-MSFC and TC jointly agreed to\nincorporate conventional high-cost nozzle ablative materials in the first development\nmotor static firing (DM-1).\n\nThe newer low-cost materials, which will be thoroughly\n\ntested in laboratory and subscale motors (up to 38, 000 pounds of propellant) over\na 26-month period are scheduled for the second development motor test (DM-2).\nFive development motors and four qualification motors are now planned with\ndevelopment motor testing being conducted from December 1976 to December 1977,\nand qualification motor testing accomplished from April 1977 through October 1978.\nThe twelve DDT&E flight motors begin fabrication in October 1977, and the last\nmotor is supplied in May 1979.\n\n188\n\nFAM\n\nFOLDOUT MUATE IFOLDOUT\nJUL\n\nS\n\n121 1 126\n21\n\n1974\nAUG\n\n2\n\n9\n\nSEP\n\n11 2\n1623130\n3\n\n6\n\n1975\nOCT\n\n13T2702714 III\n13\n2\nI 1\n\nNOV\n\n181i2l 1 18\n1\n4\n1\n8\n\n1\n152222\n1\n\nDECA\n29\n29\n\n6\n\n3 2o\n6\n\nM\n27 7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n111\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n1976\n\nA\n\n112113\n\nS\n\nO\n\n141 15\n\nN\n\n16 117\n\nF\n\n1\n\n18\n\nM\n\nA\n\n20 211 22\n\nJ\nJ\n\nM\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n1 26\n\nA\nO\n\n27 128\n\n1 29 1 30\n\nJ\n\n31 32\n\n3334\n\n1 35\n\nS\n\nA\n\n1 36 137_38\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43 441 45\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\nA\n\n49\n\nS\n\nONJASON\n\nSO1511 52 1\n\n54\n\nD\n\n5\n\n5\n\n1 IFMOF\n\n_1\n\nl\n\nOF CDR\n\nPDR\nOF\n\n58\n\nATPPF-1\n\nMILESTONES\n-SHUTTLE\nSYSTEM\n\nPDR PDR (SRB)\nA\nTP (7-1)\n\nMILESTONES - SRM PROJECT\n\nM\nNDJFMA\nN\nJ\n\n199\n\n178\n\n1977\n\nAS M\nF\nS\n\nIDCKKSC\n\nFMOF\n\nPF,\n\nON DOCK KSC\n\nT\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-\n\nUPDATE PROPOSAL\nLEGEND\n\nSRM NEGOTIATONS COMPLETE\n\nNASA CONTROLLED MILESTONE\n\nS\n\nSLIPPAGE\n\nCASE PROCUREMENT\nDESIGN\nV\n\nSRM CONTROLLEDMILESTONE\n\nli\n\n6\n\nPDR\n\nPOSTFIRE/EFURBISHMENT\n\nITIME\n\nPREPARE - MAIL BID PACKAGES\nVENDOR RFP\n\nSPAN\n\n__\n\nLmm\n\nREVIEW BIDS - SELECT VENDOR - NASA OK\n\nNASA ACTIVITY\nON DOCK MFC/KSC\n\nAWARD CONTRACT\nT\n\nSTATICTES\nNO.

Much of the data dates\nback five to ten years, particularly that of the 120- to 156-inch diameter motors.\nThe test objectives of only a few of the motors included obtaining vibration and\nacoustic environment. In most cases, cost considerations limited the use of vibration transducers to a few locations on a motor nozzle or case as an aid in\nfailure analysis.\nThe data in this report were gleaned from memoranda and final reports.\nThe reports are referenced when only a summary of their data is presented in\nthis report. A list of references, not received by Thiokol in time for this report,\nis included.\nThe motors included in this report vary in size from 52 inches in diameter\nto 156 inches in diameter. Aerojet-General Corporation fired 260-inch diameter\nsolid propellant motors, but Thiokol has received no data from these tests.\nTable I is a list of motors and the type of data reported.\n\nFor some motors,\n\ndata are limited to one channel.\nMotor descriptive parameters are presented in Table II and individual sections\nwhen available to permit scaling of data.\n\nClassified data are excluded intentionally.\n\nA-1\n\nTABLE I\nMOTORS REPORTED ON\n\nDiameter\n(in.)\n\nVibration Data\n\nAcoustic Data\n\n156-1 (TU-412)\n\n156\n\nX\n\nX\n\n156-7 (TU-393)\n\n156\n\nX\n\nX\n\n156-8 (TU-312.

This data\ncould not be correlated to a corresponding thrust nor was any indication given on\nthe accelerometers during this same period.\n\nBoth CEC traces and shock spectrum\n\nplots were made of the data with no indication of this frequency.\n\nIt did, however,\n\nexcite the accelerometers at the apparent natural frequency of the dome, at about\n89 Hz.\n\nDue to the nature of the igniter on this motor it appears this pressure\n\ncharacteristic was caused by the ignition transients.\nThe only other area\n\nwhere low-frequency data could be deteced was on\n\nthe TU-412, where a frequency of approximately 10 Hz was noted on the axial\naccelerometers between 1 and 2 seconds of firing. This frequency could not be\ndetected on the pressure trace but correlated directly with test stand ring as indicated\non the thrust channel.\n\nThe amplitude of this data was in the order of 0.2 g\'s. It\n\nwas concluded that the accelerometer data were a result of test stand ring and could\nnot be related to motor performance.\nOn the TU-393 and TU-312 motors, there was no evidence of any low-frequency\ndata on any channel.\n\nThe pressure, accelerometer, and thrust channels were band\n\npassed, filtered, and amplified; but still no data were evident. It was concluded\nthat the longitudinal acoustic mode was not excited on any of these three motors.\n2.7\n\nUTC DVXL5-1 (120-IN.
