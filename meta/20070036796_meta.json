Standardized approaches in the past involved selecting and then integrating the most appropriate set of functional tools. Assumptions were made that \"one size fits all\" and that tool changes would not be necessary for many years. GMSEC took a very different approach and has proven to be very successful. The core of the GMSEC architecture consists of a publish/subscribe message bus, standardized message formats, and an Applications Programming Interface (API). The API supports multiple operating systems, programming languages and messaging middleware products. We use a GMSEC-developed free middleware for low-cost development. A high capacity, robust middleware is used for operations and a messaging system with a very small memory footprint is used for on-board flight software. Software components can use the standard message formats or develop adapters to convert from their native formats to the GMSEC formats. We do not want vendors to modify their core products. Over 50 software components are now available for use with the GMSEC architecture. Most available commercial telemetry and command systems, including the GMV hifly Satellite Control System, have been adapted to run in the GMSEC labs.", "title": "[Interview Questions]", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T00:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20070036796, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, Dan"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "883b1406a75343669d604d0bf5db15c5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070036796, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070036796, "id": "25373df9de104fcc8f90d1534cdcaba1", "publicationDate": "2007-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070036796.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070036796/downloads/20070036796.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070036796/downloads/20070036796.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070036796/downloads/20070036796.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
