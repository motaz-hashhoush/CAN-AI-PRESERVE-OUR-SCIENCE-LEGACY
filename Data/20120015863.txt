The quality of these\ngeophysical parameters relies on the input quality of sensor calibrated radiances. MODIS\nobservations are made in 36 spectral bands with wavelengths ranging from visible (VIS) to longwave infrared (LWIR). Its reflective solar bands (RSB) are calibrated using data collected from\nits on-board solar diffuser and regularly scheduled lunar views. The thermal emissive bands\n(TEB) are calibrated using an on-board blackbody (BB). The changes in the sensor's spectral and\nspatial characteristics are monitored by an on-board spectroradiometric calibration assembly\n(SRCA). This paper presents an overview of Aqua MODIS lO-year on-orbit operation and\ncalibration activities, from launch to present, and summarizes its on-orbit radiometric, spectral,\nand spatial calibration and characterization performance. In addition, it will illustrate and discuss\non-orbit changes in sensor characteristics and corrections applied to continuously maintain the\nsensor level IB (LIB) data quality, as well as lessons learned that could benefit future calibration\nefforts.\n\n"
