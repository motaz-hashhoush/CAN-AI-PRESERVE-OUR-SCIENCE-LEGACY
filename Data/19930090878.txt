It involves the creation of aircraft satisfying all the conditions\nof safety and reliability which we are now wont to claiim for\nother means of transportation and also includes an increase in\nthe pay load. It is chiefly a problem of technical research\ninvolving the improvementof the flight characteristics and\nstrength with the lowest possible weight. This is undoubtedly\nthe ultimate purpose of all new aircraft designs. On this basis the development of an airplane and the flights made with it\nare to be regarded as an attempt to come one step nearer the\ndesired goal. Success will necessarily depend on the obtention\nof all the possible data from these expensive tests.\nMost of the data are obtained through the fact that every\naircraft reveals its characteristics in flight. In many cases,\nhowever, it is impossible to account for these characteristics.\nOnly a general law would enable us, however, to take advantage\nof the experience gained.. Aside from the preliminary scientific\nwork, those tests are the most helpful which, after the completion, of an airplane type, enable us to determine Its true cha1\'ac* tt Ueber qe Messung der \xe2\x80\xa2Krfte an Luftfahrzeugen, t\' from Zeitschrift fur Flugtechnik und.

Technical Memorandum No. 519 \t\n\n2\n\nteristics and to express numerically the effect of the various\ncomponents on the characteristics of the whole airplane.\nProgress can of. course be made without such tests. If\nenough airplanes axe made and if their efficiency is determined\nIn each case, general laws will be eventually discovered. By\nthis method, however, the tests are necessarily more numerous\nand expensive. Especially in Germany, the most essenti1 plienomena of an aircraft should be classified according to their\norigin and then measured. Information can be . thus obtained in\na quicker, cheaper, and more reliable way than would otherwise\nbe possible.\nWith this idea in mind, I have regarded it as one of the\nmost important tasks for my division of the D.V.L. (German Institute for Aeronautic Research) to attempt the solution-of\nthis problem. I will now inform you as to how far this attempt\nhas been successful. I hardly, need to say that I do not regard\nthis very difficult and extensive problemas beinganywhere\nnear solved, I think I can show you some results, however,\nwhich indicate that the problem is not so hopeless as it is\noften regarded.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the first instance it is\n\nvery important to separate air-\n\nplane performances Into two main\n\ngroups, that of the power plant\n\nand that of the airplane proper.\n\nCertairn performances specified\n\nin contracts, such as the ceilin\n\n, are based on the assumptiom\n\nthat the engine develops a given power. If these performances\n\n-\t\n\nNPA.CSA. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n3\n\nare not attained, which happens in some cases, no adequate reason can usually be given for the failure. The engine designer\nis generally firmly convinced that his engine satisfies all the\nrequirements and so is the airplane designer. Lastly, the propeller designer never doubts the efficiency of his propeller.\nIt has often been attempted to solve this probleip by measuring the forces between the airplane and the propeller or the\nmoments between the engine and the propeller, but all previous\nefforts to insert force-measuring devices, such as measuring\nhubs, between the engine and the propeller have failed to be\nentirely satisfactory. Reports on the numerous tests made\nabroad are so incomplete, that it is impossible to obtain any\ncorrect understanding of them. The only data available in\nGermany were obtained with the old D.V.L. measuring hub, and\nthese data were the main factor in the designiof the two new\nmeasuring hubs which were shown at the \'I.L.A. (1928 International Aeronautia . Exposition in Berlirn), and which will now be\nbriefly described.\t\n\n-\n\nBefore making these measuring hubs, tests were carried out\nwith various measuring devices for the purpose of finding a\nmethod to transmit the test results electrically to the post of\nobservation. After many fruitless attempts, it was eventually\ndecided to return to the fluid measuring box which, on account\nof its simplicity and reliability even under the most difficult\nconditions of operation, is superior to all other devices,\navailable for this purpose. There is, however, some difficulty\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n4\n\nin connecting the rotating propeller or hub with the stationary\nrecording device in the observer t s cockpit.\nThere are two reasons against rotating the measuring box\nwith the propeller. In the first place, the pressure pipe can\nbe rum from the pressure box to the . observer\'s cockpit without\nbeing carried around the propeller. In the second place, the\naccuracy of the measurement is increased, owing to the following\nreasons. The forces exerted betwei the propeller and the crank\nshaft are not constant, due to the irregular running of internal combustion engines. When the box, in which the pressure is\nmeasured, is of the rotating type, its connection with a stationary pipe requires the use of a gasket which, however, is never\nquite tight. Consequently, a certain amount of the fluid leaks\nthrough, especially at maximum pressure, and the pressure in\nthe pipe decreases. Thus, the mean value obtained by a suitable\ndamping of the recording device will be too low.\nThe volume of the escaping fluid and consequently, the decrease in pressure depend on the viscosity. Hence, the values\nvary according to the viscosity of the fluid. Since, om the\nother hand, the viscosity of the fluid is greatly affected by\ntemperatuze,different test results will be obtained at various\ntemperatures. An instrument designed for use on airplanes in\nflight should not be sensitive to variations of temperature.\nThis fact, which fully explains the experiments previously made\nwith similar measuring devices and which therefore seems to be\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n5\n\nreliable, finally settled the question in favor of the stationary\nmeasuring box in spite of the attendant difficulties. Thus, the\nfluid volume can be tightly enclosed, and the results hitherto\nobtained have fully confirmed our expectations.\nThe mounting of the whole hub on the shaft without clearance\nis another difficulty, which must be overcome in order to maintaini equilibrium. On the other hand, the hu\' . should slide freely\nto insure the passing of all the forces through the measuring\ndevice and to prevent their transmissiorn by friction. These two\nconditions are difficult to coordinate. Former arrangements\nconsisted in mounting a cylindrical sleeve On the shaft stub.\nThe bore of the hub was ground to fit the sleeve exabtly. Under\nthese conditions sliding became very difficult, since the sleeve,\nwhen firmly secured on the shaft to avoid seizing, expanded\nand-caused jamming. Eien . grinding, when it is possible, only\ncompensates for the elastic deformatiorn due to the pressure on\nthe cone and not for the deformationi by heat. This phenomenoni\nis of minor importance in the case of torque measurements, since\nthe lever aim of the friction forces is so small that no great\nerror can occur. It is otherwise with thrust measurements which\ndepend on the absolute magnitude of the frietloit. This state\'\nment, as will be shown later, applies particularly to themeasurement of very small thrusts.\nThus the arrangement of the thrust-measuring hub shown in\nFigures 1 to 5, was adopted for the mounting.of the propeller\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n6\n\non the crank shaft. A flange both in front and aft of the propeller is keyed to the crank shaft. Each flange is provided, on\nits periphery, with four pairs of rollers mounted on ball bearings. The longitudinally movable portioni, into which the propeller blades fit,, has four front and rear arms each, fitting in\nbetween the pairs of rollers. The whole propeller is mounted\non these\' four arms only and is not otherwise connected with the\ncrank shaft. This arrangement allows for expansion without\ndanger of jamming, especially since the expansion is very small\non the periphery of the flanges. Where mov&bie and fixed parts\nmay produce friction, by elastic or thermal expansion, they are\nseparated by air.\nFor transmission of the thrust to the measuring drum, the\nlatter is ring-shaped. Arms of the longitudinally movable propeller pass between the engine shaft and the drum and transmit\nthe thrust to the piston of the measuring drum by means of a\nthrust ball bearing. The drum is mounted on ball bearings on\nthe sleeve and transmits the axial force through a.thrust ball\nbearing to the flange, which is firmly secured to the crank\nshaft. The wholeaction of the force is thus exerted inside of\nthe measuring hub only, so that no force need be transmitted to\nthe outside.\nThe hub (Fig. 5) is mounted in the usual way , except that\na pipe must be runto the observer\'s cockpit and made fast, in\norder to prevent the measuring drum\' from rotating under the ac-\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n7\n\ntion of friction in the roller bearings. A rod, fastened to one\nof the screws on the engine or engine mount, answers the purpose.\nThe experience gained hitherto with this measuring hub is\nillustrated by the calibration diagram (Fig. 6). The circles\nmark points of increasing thrust and the crosses, points of decreasing thrust. There is hardly any internal friction, since\nthere are no deflections in the calibration-curve which otherwise would have been produced according to the direction. in\nwhich the thrust is approached. The curve was plotted on the\nelectric test stand which produces practically no vibration.\nFrictioni conditions are certainly as favorable on the vibrating\naviatiom engines. The accuracy of the measurement is therefore\nchiefly dependent on the accuracy with which a pressure measurement can be made. According to experimental data, the thrust\ncan be measured with an accuracy of 1 to 2 kg (2.2 to 4.4 lb.).\nSpecial pressure-measuring devices are used for very small\nthrust measurements, and the, error is then considerably smaller.\nThe hub has also given satisfactory results on aviation\nengines in flight. It has now been in operationi for approximately 20 hours without the slightest damage. A flight measurement is shown iii Figure 7. It is seen that the measured points\n- lie on a curve.\n(Fig. 8)\nThe torque-measuring hub/was also designed on similar principles. The fluid pressure is measured by means of a stationary\n\nNSA.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519 \t\n\n8.\n\nmeasuring drum. This result was first achieved by converting\nthe tangential force of the engine into an axial force by means\nof a flange mounted on the engine shaft in front of the propeller. The propeller is rotatable and mounted on ball bearings.\nThe flange carries six pistons. The pistons act on six small\nboxes secured to the propeller (Figs. 9 and 10). The pressure\ndeveloped in these boxes is transmit-d througfi a pipe to four\nother boxes provided with pistons working in an axial direction.\nAll the components participate in the rotation. A specific\nforce in the axially working pistons corresponds to the pressure\nin the boxes. This force is transmitted by a thrust ball bearing to the ring-shaped statioiiary measuring drum. The pressure\nin this drum. is measured in the same way as in the thrust-measuring hub. Thus the fluid volumes are all completely enclosed.\nThe pistons of the boxes are ground in and a diaphragm. is\nstretched between the pistons and the fluid, to secure perfect\ntightness.\nAt first sight the whole arrangement (Fig. 11) looks more\ncomplicated than it really is. The first two sets of boxes\nmerely produce a hydraulic conversion of a force on the principle of the hydraulic press. As in a hydraulic press, the force\ncan also be increased and reduced at will. In the case of the\nconsidered hu the force is reduced, primarily to reliev\xc3\xa8.the\nwhole system of excessive axial. forces and furthermore, to enable the pressure-measuring devices, used for the thrust-meaa-\n\nN.A.C\'.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519 \t\n\n9\n\nuring hub, to be likewise used for the measurement of the pressures in the ring-shaped measuring box.\nThe pressures set up in the rotating fluid and hence also\nthe forces in the axially working pistons are not produced by\nthe pressure of the pistoit alone, but also by the centrifugal\nforce of the fluid. However, the axial and tangential boxes\ncan be arranged each with respect to the other, so as to eliminate this influence and to render the measurement independent\nof the centrifugal force. This was actually done in the completed. model.\nThe accuracy of the measuring hub is illustrated by Figure\n12. The values designated by small circles were obtained on the\nelectric test stand, and those marked with a cross, on the aviatiorn engine. It appears that even torque measurements can be\nmade with an accuracy which is perfectly satisfactory for technical purposes.\nWe shall next turn to problems which could Trot be solved\nup to the present and which can now be solved by means of these\nmeasuring hubs. The most important task would be to use the\nthrust-measuring hub under conditions corresponding to flight\nat zero thrust. The pilot is provided with a recording device\nwhich enables him to control the number of revolutions by means\nof the throttle and to reduce the thrust to zero at the -desired\nangle. of glide. For the sake of obtaining accurate test results,\na measurement will be made for a slightly negative and also\n\n\t\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n10\n\nfor a slightly positive thrust at the same gliding angle. According to previous tests this can be easily done. The revolution speed at zero thrust materially exceeds the idling speed\nof the engine, whence it follows that the propeller produces\nconsiderable drag at the idling speed.\nSuch measurements afford means of ohtaining the polar of\nan airplane as if it were flying without a propeller and of\nchecking the usual wind-tunnel tests and aerodynamic calculations\nwith their more or less reliably estimated drag coefficients.\n,A possible objection to such measurements is the way of controlling the number of revolutions by reducing to zero the total\nthrust over the propeller-disk area, which may be negative about\nthe periphery of the propeller disk and positive toward its center, whereby an error might be incurred, owing to the influence\nexerted on the airplane. The error, however, is certainly very\nsmall. In doubtful cases a special propeller can be so constructed that during gliding tests, the thrust will be zero all\nover its disk and will leave only a very small residual disturbances\nAfter thus measuring the airplane polar, we can verify the\npropeller thrust and the effect of the propeller slipstream on\nthe airplane polar by measuring the same values again with a\nrunning engine. such investigations have already been instituted in the a. gttingen wind tunnel and by the D.V.L. in flight, by\nsubjecting airplanes to identical tests by both methods. Torque\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n11\n\nmeasurements which, in additiort to propeller tests, can also be\nused for the determinatioit of engine power as a function of altitude, are likewise very important.\nTorque and thrust measurements were separated chiefly for\nthe sake of simplifying the constructional problem. Moreover,\nthis sepaation. constitutes only a slight disadvantage, because\nmost of the tests involve only one of the two factors. Airplane problems involve only the thrust and all engine problems\ninvolve only the torque. Thus, all these tests require only\nthe simple installation. Propeller tests alone require both\ntorque and thrust measurements. In such cases the best way is\nto make two flights, measuring the thrust coefficient during\none flight and the torque coefficient of the same propeller\nduring the other flight. In my opinion it is not worth while\nto seek a complicated solutiom by a forced combinatiorn of the\ntwo measurements, since no sufficiently simple solutiom seems\nto be available as yet.\nThe propeller blades were made adjustable in the hubs, on\nthe assumptioni that the hubs would be used in most cases for\nairplane and engine tests, the shape of the propeller being of\nminor importance, provided one is able to take off at all. Thus\ntheir use becomes more general, since by changing their pitch\nthey can be easily adapted to different airplanes and engines\nwithout requiring new blades in each case. The two models exhibited at the th l.L.A.. fl were designed for metal blades. In\n\nI\n\n\t\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n12\n\nfuture, hubs will be designed for both metal and wood variablepitch propellers. Tests of corresponding locking devices are\nnow being made. The chief advantage of wood blades lies in the\nfact that they are cheap and can be easily modified.\nI think I have now mentioned the most important points regarding the problem of the separation of the effect of the engine and propeller, on the one hand, and of the airplane, on\nthe other hand, on the performance ofthewhole airplane. It\nonly remains for me to mention that my coworker, Mr. Ebert,\nhas had an important share in the development of these measuring\nhubs. He will also conduct further experiments with them and\nannounce the results at the proper time.\nThe separation of propeller, engine and airplane effects\nis far from affording a clearidea of all the forces acting on\nan airplane. The explan\xc3\xa1tioniof their-relations requires further force measurements to be made. Surprisingly little work\nhas been done thus far in making force measurements on the varbus components of an airplane. The only serious attempt to\nsolve this problem was made by Hoff many years ago in the form\nof rope, force measurements. The requisite data for strength\ncalculations were obtained by acceleration measurements. The\ndemand for an accelerometer giving accurate values under practically all conditions is so frequently addressed to the D.V.L.\nthat it inclines me to believe that the actual value of acceleration measurements isbeing considerably overestimated. Atten-.\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n13\n\ntioni is therefore called to certain points which, although not\nnew, have received too little attention.\nAn accelerometer always consists essentially of a mass connected by a spring to some part of the airplane. Under the action of acceleration the mass exerts forces on the spring and\nthese forces are measured and recorded by its elongation.\nSuch a system can produce vibrations. When the load is suddenly\nincreased or decreased, it vibrates with a certain. frequency\nwhich depends primarily on the spring constant and on the magnitude of the mass. According to the elementary principles of\nthe vibration theory, it is a well-known fact that accelerations are accurately measured by such a system, provided the\ntime, during vihich , the measured accelerationi increases and decreases is large mm coniparisom with the duratiom of a natural\nvibration. The limit of resonance of the accelerometer is\nreached when these two times become approximately equal The\ndeflections are then excessive and no readings can be taken.\nWhen the acceleration increases and dies away in a time which\nis short in comparison with the duratiom of a natural vibratiorr,\nthe recording in strunient no longer measures the acceleration\nbut records changes in the positioni (vibration) of the point\nwhere it is attached to the airplane. It thus becomes a vibrograph or seismograph.\nUnfortunately, the airplane produces various accelerations\nwith quite different frequencies. The most disagreeable .dis-\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\t\n\n14\n\nturbances are due to periodical accelerations set up by the en gine vibrations. On present-day engines these accelerations\nreach frequencies of from .40 to 60 per second and their magnitude at full engine power is usually three to five times that of\nthe acceleration due to gravity. According to the above considerations, accelerometers must be designed with a much higher or\na much lower frequency than that of the engine vibrations. Otherwise only a wild vibration will be produced. When higher freq\xc3\xbcencies are adopted, they should be at least 100 per second in\norder to lie well outside the range of resonance. Such an accelerometer would then measure all the accelerations of its\npoint of attachment and hence also those engendered by the engine vibrations, which are generally not very important, but cannot be eliminated. They might be damped, :but this would also\nlead to the suppression of all the other vibrations shorter than\nthose of the engine. In that case, the high natural frequency\nof the accelerometer becomes meaningless, since the unavoidable\nsmall deflections require large gearings which cause great constructionaJ. difficulties. If, on the other hand, these defleaitions are not suppressed, the readings taken in flight will be\nof the type represented in Figure 13. The accelerometer shows\nan acceleration of approximately 3 to 5 g (acceleration:. due to\ngravity) with 30 to 60 periods. The record is a wide band\nwhich, according to the accelerations moves upward or downward\na distance, which is usually smaller than the width of the band.\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n15\n\nSuch readings are not of much use. An accelerometer of this\ntype will givegood results only when the engine is stopped\nand the engine vibrations are very small.\nThe accelerations should furnish a measure for the stress\nbut when they increase and die away quickly they fail to do so.\nThe rather high accelerations, set up by engine vibrations without affecting the construction, confirm this fact. Fatigue\nfailures due to vibrations are not affected by the magnitude of\nthe acceleration but by the number and magnitude of the deflec:tions, which are best measured direct, instead of through the\nintermediary of acceleration.\nWhen the acceleration measurements are Qvaluated mi the\nusual way and the acceleration is introduced into the fimdarnental law of mechanics, force = mass times acceleration (the mass\nbeing that of the whole airplane), this holds good, so long as\nthe airplane can be considered as a rigid body. An airplane,\nhowever, is actually far fromi rigid but forms on the oontrary a\ncomparatively flexible structure capable of vibrating. The duratiorn of the natural vibrations of monoplane wings is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 of a second. For all phenomena of shorter\nduration acceleration is no suitable measure of the stress.\nAccording to Hooke t s law the tension is proportional to the\ndeforma\'tion. When a very great force is exerted on the wing or,\nin other words, when a very great acceleratiom is produced, the\nwing is deflected and the stresses grow in proportion to the\n\nN.A.CSA. \'Technical Memorandum No. 519 \t\n\n16\n\ndeformation. When, after a short time, the force and hence also\nthe acceleration acting on the wing are suppressed, the wing is\ndeflected still further at first, owing to the inherent kinetic\nenergy, and the streses are further increased, although there\nis no acceleration. The force can even be reversed, in which\ncase the wingis further deflected with a correspondingly retarded motion until its maximum deflection is reached. The greatest\nstresses correspond to this maximum. deflection. In the case of\nthe imagined experiment they occur at the moment when the acceleration-i is zero or has such a sigii that the usual evaluation of\nan acceleration measurement would yield a tension with the contrary sign. This consideration holds good only so long as the\nacceleration- increases and dies away within a time of the same\norder of magnitude as the duration of a natural vibration.\nShort-period accelerations actually occur on an airplane,\nespecially when they are greatest and hence most important.\nThese time limits are closely approached during accelerations\nin flight, at least for monoplanes. During landing and especially alighting on water, the action of the forces is jerky and\nunder these conditions the idea of acceleration-becomes, meaningless for the airplane as a whole. Different acceleratiornVaiues will be obtained at various points of the airplane and no\nconclusions regarding the stresses can be made until the airplane and its vibratiorr. characteristics are known, which will\nnot be soon.\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n17\n\nFrom these considerations it follows that the accelerations\nare a suitable standard for the measurement of stresses only\nwhen they increase from one value to another withiit a time equal\nor superior to the period of a natural vibration of the wings,\ni.e., at least 0.1 to 0.2 of a second. Such accelerations can\nbe easily measured by means of accelerometers with natural frequencies of approximately 20 per second, which, on account of\nlonger oscillations of the springs, can be built in a simpler\nand handier way. It should, however, always be kept in mind\nthat only comparatively slow phenomena can be studied, for which\nthe acceleratiom is then.. also a reliable measure of the stress.\nAcceleratiom measurements alone do not afford means of determining stresses during short-period phenomena such as the landing\nimpact. Under these conditions the flattening out after a dive\nis also a short-period phenomenon for certain airplanes with\nflexible wings.\nThese statements are not intended to disparage acce1eratiofl\nmeasurements. They may be very useful, provided the above conditions are kept in mind. This question was taken up only to show\nthe need of a much more general and reliable method for force\nmeasurements. The. above-mentioned difficulties and restrictions\ndo not apply to force and elongation measurements, which always\nafford a reliable criteriom for both static and vibrational\nare\nstresses. Aircraft force measurements/also important for inivestigating the air flow about airplanes. Thus considerable bene-\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical\' Memo r andum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n18\n\nfit might be derived from measurements of the forces generated\nby the tail surfaces in flight, or exerted on seaplane floats\nduring the take-off.\nA measuring device suitable for the above purposes should\nbe independent of. inertia, shock-proof, accurate, and designed\nto satisfy all working conditions on airplanes, especially that\nof occupying only a small space.\nThe simplest way to determine a force is to measure the\nelongation of a spring or, which, is often better, the actual\ndeformation of a structural part\', and to establish by calibration the relatiorn between the force and the elongation. The\ndifficulty lies chiefly in the smallness of the deflections, so\nthat, in order to achieve a reasonable degree of precision, the,\nmeasurements must be made with an accuracy of at least 0.01 mm\n(.00039 in.). The work in this connection, especially with\nelectric measuring devices, failed to be satisfactory until\nPabst hit \'upon the idea of scratching the deflections on a plate\'\nwith a diamond and of then magnifying them with a microscope.\nRecording devices, as shoin in Figure 14, were developed along\nthis line. They satisfy all the above-mentioned requirements\nand work on the following principle. A spindle, driven by\nclockwork or by a small motor, moves a slide. This slide carries the plate on which the records are made. Hith .erto .the best\nresults were obtained with glass plates. The over-all dimensions of the device are 30 x 30\n\nX\n\n50 mm (1.18 x 1.18 x 1.97 in.). .\n\nN.A.O.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519 \t\n\n19\n\nIt is secured to some spar or strut at the point where the deflections are to be measured. At a certain distance, say 25 cm\n(9.84 in.) from the device is secured one end of a rod, the\nother end of which can move longitudinally and fits into the recording device where it actuates the diamond. The record can\nbe enlarged at will and gives sharp prints up to a 500-fold enlargement. Owing to the fact that the enlargement can be adapted\nto the requirements, the records can be enlarged at will. Two\ndiagrams of different magnification are showrn in Figures 15 and\n16.\nTests based on this method are now being instituted for the\nmeasurement of landing-gear stresses. Although the method has\nnot yet been applied to all the previously mentioned problems,\nI am confident it will constitute a means for obtaining most\nof the experimental data which are still lacking.\nSome details are given below on the important question of\nfloat and hull resistance, which has hitherto defied mathematical solution. A purely theoretical solutiom is not likely to\nbe found for a long time. In the meantime we must therefore\nhave recourse to tests Float-model tests are affected by the\ndifficulty of obtaining mechanical similarity. This feature\nis also common to other model tests, such as wind-tunnel tests\nof wings, but it does not greatly affect wind-tunnel experiments\nin general, and the calculations are fairly reliable, which can\nnot be claimed of water-tank float tests.\n\nNIPA.O.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n20\n\nAccording to test results on the effect of the model scale,\nthe coefficients used in float-model investigations are critical\nvalues which render scale conversions particularly unsafe.\nTheir untrustworthiness increases with the size of the seaplanes.\nThe large hulls now being built may cause disagreeable surprises.\nModel tests, however, are far from being useless and should, , on\nthe contrary, be more frequently resorted to, in conjunctiorn,\nhowever, with full-scale tests.\nAn installatiom which seems to suit the purpose is shown\nin Figure 17. It differs from. a,, normal seaplane only by small\nframes inserted between the float struts and their points of\nattachment to the floats. The forces exerted by the floating\ngear on the floats are transmitted by one horizontal and two\nvertical steel bands to force-measuring devices. The steel band\nsuspension insures easy, frictionless transmissiorn, so that the\nforces are fully exerted on the measuring devices. This arrangement enables three-component measurements to be carried out.\nThe whole installation works in two directions and insures a\ncorrect recording of the forces, even if they change their sign\nduring the test, which may actually happen when the floats are\nlifted off the water. The above-mentioned components could be\nused as the actual measuring devices. The method would consist\nin transmitting the forces through springs and measuring their\nelongation which seems quite feasible, since only very small\nspring oscillations - 0,5 mm (.0197 in.)- are required. These\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n21\n\ninstruments are particularly suitable for measurements on rough\nwater, because they are practically unaffected by inertia and\nbecause the spring travel is such that the instruments do not\naffect the elastic properties of the hull.\nFluid measuring boxes seem to be best suited for systematic\ninvestigations of the float resistance, which are usually carried out on smooth water, since they enable the recording device\nto be located in the pilot\'s or observer\'s cockpit. The readings,. which can be thus taken during the test, are more explicit\nthan subsequent evaluations. The results hitherto obtained with\nthese measuring boxes have the same percentage of accuracy as\nwater-tank tests. The position and the speed of the float orn\nthe water must be determined in connection with force measurements. This can be done photographically, while the speed can\nalso be measured with a Pilot tube.\nA complete measuring installation of this type is owned by\nthe D.V.L., but no tests have been made for lack of appropriations.\nFor systematic investigatioits on a large scale,-such an installatiorr must also comprise special floats with an under-water\nbody which, in each case, can be easily and quickly modified\nwithout changing the actual framework. The completion of this\narrangement should offer ito difficulties, since its weight is .of\nminor importance. A great number of current full-size float\ntypes could be tested on one seaplane provided with such an\n\nI\n\nN.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 519\n\n\t\n\n22\n\nequipment. In the case of very lxge floats, suitably reduced\nmodels could be used.\nThe D.V.L. installation is designed for airplanes of from\n2000 to 3000 kg (4409 to 6614 lb.) total weight. For the largest\nseaplanes now in use, this represents a model scale of about\n1.6 and for the 40-toni Dornier flying boat, under construction,\na scale of approximately 2.4. Such scale ratios insure absolutely reliable results. With regard to these tests, which are\nplanned as model tests for very large hulls, it should be noted\nthat the relationi between the speed of the model and that of\nthe full-size hull must be as the square roots of the dimensions.\nThe load reduction, due to the wing lift corresponding to each\nspeed, should be produced by suitable variations of the lift\nwhich, however, cannot be easily effected. A suggested method\nconsists in mounting on top of a monoplane a second wing of the\nsame area, this wing being easily detachable and having an adjustable angle of attack. This arrangement satisfies all the\nconditions of flying boats now in, operatiom and of those mi\ncourse of development. In additioni to float strength and resistance, there are many other questions, such as formation of\nspray, behavior on rough water, drifting before the wind, etc..,\nregarding which this method will afford reliable information.\nT\'ans1ation by W.
