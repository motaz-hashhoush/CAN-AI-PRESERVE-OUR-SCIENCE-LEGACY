For this reason, \"Follow the Water\" has been adopted as a mantra for the search for Life in the Cosmos. Expeditions have helped to establish the limits and biodiversity of life in the most extreme environments on Earth. Microbial extremophiles inhabit acidic streams; hypersaline and hyperalkaline lakes and pools; the cold deep sea floor, permafrost, rocks, glaciers, and perennially ice-covered lakes of the polar environments; geysers, volcanic fumaroles, hydrothermal vents and hot rocks deep within the Earth's crust. The ESA Venus Express Spacecraft entered Venusian Orbit in 2006 and continues to produce exciting results. The Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument made the first detection of hydroxyl in the atmosphere of Venus, indicating it is much more similar to Earth and Mars than previously thought. Huge hurricane-like vortices have been found above the poles of the planet and as yet unidentified UV absorbers that form mysterious dark bands in the upper atmosphere. At 70 km and below, water vapor and sulfur dioxide combine to form sulfuric acid droplets that create a haze above the cloud tops. Thermophilic acidophiles, such as have recently been discovered on Earth, could possibly survive in the hot sulfuric acid droplets that exist in the upper atmosphere of Venus. In order to understand how to search for life elsewhere in the Solar System, over 40 VIRTIS images of Earth from Venus have been obtained to search for evidence of life on Earth. The signatures of water and molecular Oxygen were detected in the Earth s atmosphere, but the atmosphere of Venus also exhibits these signatures. The water and water ice are far more abundant on comet, the polar caps and permafrost of Mars and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. These \"frozen worlds\" of our Solar System, are much more promising regimes where extant or extinct microbial life may exist. The ESA Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) probe has found that both the North and South Polar Caps of Mars are approximately 3.5 km thick and are composed almost entirely of water ice. In winter, a thin dry ice layer covers the caps, but it sublimates directly to CO2 in the spring. The ESA Mars Express Orbiter images reveal Rupes Tenuis to be a vast snow-laden region on the southern edge of the Martian North Polar Cap. The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit found alkaline volcanic rocks in the Gusev Crater and the Phoenix Mars Lander has shown that the soil of Mars is much more alkaline than previously expected. The Phoenix Mars Lander has also made direct observations of frozen and liquid water on Mars. It is known that microorganisms from Alaska, Siberia and Antarctica can remain alive frozen in permafrost or ice for long periods of time. These discoveries increase the possibility that the Labeled Release Experiment may have discovered life on Mars during the Viking Mission and provide strong impetus for the return of life detection experiments to Mars. Changes in the spin rate of Saturn's moon Titan indicate that it may also harbor a 300 km thick liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. The NASA/ESA/Italian Space Agency Cassini Spacecraft has imaged geysers containing water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide and organics erupting from the \"tiger stripe\" regions near the South Pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus. The high temperatures observed, the water vapor and large number of ice particles expelled suggest that a liquid water lake may exist beneath the \"tiger stripe\" ice cracks of Enceladus. The NASA Deep Impact probe found the surface temperature of comet 9P/Temple 1 at 1.5 AY was slightly above the ice/water phase change temperature (273 K). This suggests melting of water ice near the comet surface. A spectrometer the spacecraft detected a mixture of clay and carbonate minerals (that form in the presence of liquid water) streaming off the comet after the collision with the pactor. The study of chemical and mineral biomarkers, chiral amino acids and possible indigenous microfossils in SNC and carbonaceous meteorites continues. These results suggest that comets should be considered prime targets in the search for Life in the Cosmos. The ESA Rosetta mission is on track to rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The recent space observations combined with new information about the ability of microbial extremophiles to thrive in polar environments suggest that life may be far more widely distributed in the Cosmos than previously thought possible. The Panelists will review recent discoveries and provide their own insights about Life in the Cosmos -- followed by a question and answer session with the audience.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090034846, "endDate": "2009-08-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "Bellingham, WA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5d6c8f0fa870464fba9a54a2cc081d62", "id": "829b2cf21a4945f38b1d1f2cd700eee9"}], "name": "SPIE Optics + Photonics 2009 Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "5d6c8f0fa870464fba9a54a2cc081d62", "startDate": "2009-08-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090034846, "id": "17155ea26dcc4be3a5eb462622eda551", "publicationDate": "2009-08-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
