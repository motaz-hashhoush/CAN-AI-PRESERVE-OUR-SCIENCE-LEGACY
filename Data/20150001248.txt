The, at this point largely unexamined,\nplethora of possibilities going forward, a subset of which is discussed, could\nliterally reinvent aerospace but requires triage of many possibilities. Such\ninitial upfront homework would lengthen the Research and Development\n(R&D) time frame but could greatly enhance the affordability and\nperformance of the evolved products and capabilities. Structural nanotubes\nand exotic energetics along with some unique systems approaches are\nparticularly compelling.\nIntroduction\nAerospace, originally as Aeronautics and later including Space access,\nutilization, science and exploration, developed in the Industrial Age and is to\na major extent still an artifact of that age. In both the Aerospace and Space\narenas a conservatism has developed over the years including reliance upon\nproven, legacy systems and approaches. Having begun in the Industrial Age,\nthe continued utilization of flight proven, legacy systems, approaches and\ntechnologies biases the industry toward maintaining an Industrial Age\ncontent and status quo. Systems are updated, (some) materials are\nimproved as are sensors and IT components but overall the aerospace arena,\nwhich was the \xe2\x80\x9cgo-go\xe2\x80\x9d industry, the technological cutting edge of the 1950s\nand 1960s is today often typified by risk aversion and less than aggressive\nvisioning actualization.\nWe are now in the Information Technology (IT), Biologics (Bio), Nano age\nheading rapidly into the virtual age, beyond the Industrial Age. We are also\nbeset by apparently long term fiscal issues impacting the affordability of the\ncontinuation of Industrial Age approaches, technologies and mantras. Both\nin the military and civilian aerospace arenas the worldwide \xe2\x80\x9ccompetition\xe2\x80\x9d is\nbecoming more aggressive with respect to application of contemporary and\ndeveloping technologies, systems and concepts. In some cases such\n\nutilization alters much, from missions and goals through functionalities and\noften proffers significant cost reductions. This increasing competition is a\nresult of the essentially level technological playing field worldwide.\nThe purpose of the present report is to briefly summarize the nature and\npromise of the ongoing worldwide technological revolutions and posit\nsynergistic applications of such across Aerospace which would/could in most\ncases greatly alter missions, goals, affordability, safety and in some cases\nraw do ability. What is suggested herein would require homework and triage\nacross a large number of technological possibilities. The highly successful\nmethod of addressing risk in such cases is to ideate/collect many approaches\nand then do homework, research and triage, putting more resources on a\nfewer number of possibilities as learn more. This usually ensures a\nsuccessful outcome and is very different from the current risk averse\napproach of trying to \xe2\x80\x9cpick winners\xe2\x80\x9d up front before the requisite homework\nto enable such a decision is accomplished.\nThis \xe2\x80\x9chomework first\xe2\x80\x9d approach to developing advanced systems, which\ncan require a decade or so of research on several approaches, requires\ndecades long foresight regarding goals and missions and such long term\nstrategic planning has not been prevalent within aerospace in recent\ndecades, with folks going to the shelves and trying to pick up available\ntechnologies when a goal/mission is decided upon. In many cases, such as\nNational Aero-Space Plane (NASP), X-33, High Speed Research (HSR),\nSpace Launch Initiative (SLI), Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT),\nConstellation, this approach of trying to attain revolutionary goals with\nevolutionary, existing technology has resulted in \xe2\x80\x9cnegative margins\xe2\x80\x9d which\nwent south during the studies, weight and cost increased as they usually do.\nNeed to start with large positive margins which in general require\nrevolutionary technologies, which in turn require homework and\nforesight/triage of many possibilities to develop. A poster child for such a\nshift, having both the requisite time scales (a decade for research, a decade\nfor development) and the absolute affordability and safety requirements is\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumans to Mars.\xe2\x80\x9d A prospective \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign plan\xe2\x80\x9d for Humans to Mars\nmight include the following, per the content herein:\n\n- Rapid development and deployment of virtual Mars exploration via\n\xe2\x80\x9cinstrumenting the planet,\xe2\x80\x9d combining all of the available, obtaining more,\nsensor etc. information into a virtual reality experience available to anyone,\nany time. Quite inexpensive and near term, should greatly increase public\ninterest and involvement in exploration. A version of this for younger\nchildren could include having a Martian of their choice provide a guided tour\nof their neighborhood.\nDevelop and deploy robotics, using increasingly capable In-situ Resource\nUtilization (ISRU), to prepare equipment and life support etc. onsite/planet\nfor eventual human arrival. Such robotic exploration and preparation is\norders of magnitude less expensive than on site humans and is doable near\nto mid-term.\nWhile the above activities are occurring, conduct the research and\ndevelopment necessary to enable humans both safe and affordable and\nwhen the requisite technology is ready, launch a manned mission.\nThe discussion herein suggests possibilities for major affordability and\ncapability revolutions in aerospace nearly across the board via exploitation\nand development of advanced, often nascent technologies, deviating from\nthe conventional use of existing legacy approaches, technologies and\nthinking.\nSome \xe2\x80\x9cgoing in\xe2\x80\x9d examples of what is now unaffordable and/or unsafe but\nmight be executable given advanced technology capabilities include:\n- Routine \xe2\x80\x9chumans to Mars\xe2\x80\x9d\n- Mars colonization and terraforming\n- Humans to the outer planets\n- Physical interstellar exploration\n- Serious ISRU\n\n- Space solar energy\n- Commercial Space \xe2\x80\x9cIndustrialization\xe2\x80\x9d beyond privatization of government\nactivities and \xe2\x80\x9cearth utilities\xe2\x80\x9d\n- A $1T/ year market in personal air vehicles\nCurrently, especially for much beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and for longer\nmissions largely what is affordable is not safe and what is safe is not\naffordable, for onsite humans, using existing technologies. There has now\nbeen more than 2 decades of systems studies, \xe2\x80\x9cDesign Reference Missions\xe2\x80\x9d\nand creative attempts to rearrange the piece-parts utilizing mostly the\nproven Industrial Age technology inventory without much success in terms\nof an affordable and safe mission. As the long duration radiation health\nimpacts have become clearer, more definitive and systems designers have\nestimated the weights necessary for passive radiation protection, active\nradiation protection appears to be required to save weight/cost/ensure crew\nhealth and there is evidently a possibility that advanced superconducting\ntechnology may enable solution spaces for active magnetic radiation\nprotection. In general, to afford safety requires major mission cost\nreductions and simplistically, along with reducing the marching army such\noverall cost reductions require weight reductions. As an example\naerodynamic capture and aerodynamic braking on Mars, where there is an\natmosphere of sorts to enable such, is nearly a mission enabler by obviating\nthe fuel weight required to retro rocket. Many other weight reduction and\nother cost reduction approaches are needed to enable both safe and\naffordable long duration human exploration much beyond LEO. These weight\nreductions may be obtainable nearer term via serious ISRU (for everything\npossible that makes sense).\nOne arena that is being pursued somewhat already is utilization of genomic\nand synthetic biology to \xe2\x80\x9cRad Harden\xe2\x80\x9d humans. This research is attempting\nto increase deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair rates, reduce the health\nimpacts of radiation to enable reduced required radiation protection weights.\nOther frontier exploration possibilities, discussed herein, include serious\n\nISRU (make it there instead of hauling it there), vastly improved space\naccess and in space propulsion, frontier energetics, increasing value per\npound via multi-functionality and miniaturization, use of holographic crew\nmembers for both functionality and psychological support, resulting in\nreduced crew size and large overall weight/cost reductions, and frontier\nmaterials to include structural nanotubes. Interesting life support options\ngoing forward range from concentrated nutrients and recycling everything\nincluding the solids to various forms, approaches for suspended animation.\nAlso, using/following studies of extremophiles, altering humans to require\nless sustenance, already being researched for plants (reduced water,\nnutrients).\nThe aeronautics metrics and issues are changing rapidly and becoming ever\nmore stringent. These metrics/issues include worldwide technical and\neconomic competition, acoustic strictures, \xe2\x80\x9crunway\xe2\x80\x9d efficiency as traffic\nincreases faster than new runways can be built (primarily due to permitting\nissues), emissions, competition from tele-travel, on site printing vice air\ncargo, security and safety. As an example, short haul aero traffic is\nchallenged by the fact that driving is less expensive by far and air travel trip\ntimes are impacted by security issues, traffic and weather delays and\nscheduling changes. There is some evidence that tele-travel is starting to\nimpact and substitute for physical travel. Some assert that the growth in\ndemand for physical travel overall has slowed to possibly stopped in\nindustrialized countries. For automobile transportation the U.S. is past\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeak car,\xe2\x80\x9d the miles driven per capita have been in decline for several years\nnow. Air travel for short haul has declined in the U.S. and the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) growth rate projections for air travel overall is\ndropping year by year. The precautionary principle dictates that the impacts\nof ever improved tele everything including tele travel should be factored into\nstrategic planning for both what is needed and how to provide those needs.\nZeroth order technological opportunities include ever better, less expensive\nand more intelligent robotics, major/serious materials and energetics\nbreakthroughs, accurate regional level climate measurements and\nprojections/predictions, inexpensive immersive presence/virtual reality\nexploration for everyone 24/7/265, nano sensor revolutions enabling\n\nmassive networked global and planetary sensor grids, the increasing\nreplacement of physical testing by mod-sim, affordable and safe personal air\ntransportation for everyone as well as effective scientific campaigns to\ndetermine explications for the far too many physics issues, disconnects, and\nunknowns at cosmological scales, dark matter and energy being perhaps the\nmost onerous of such. References 1 and 2 document the requirements for\nexploration going forward, with Reference 3 providing an extensive collection\nof frontier technology approaches to enable such.\n\nSynopsis of Current Aerospace Approaches\nAeronautics:\nCivilian Long Haul \xe2\x80\x93 707 [1950s] Derivatives in spite of nearly 25 years of\nserious Blended Wing Body (BWB) studies (and the B-2 military flying\nversion) and the more recent truss braced wing designs/ technology suite\nproffering up to 80 percent (overall) improvements\nAir Traffic Control (ATC) \xe2\x80\x93 Largely human operated with long latencies and\nthe inability to enable a massive [~ $1T/ year] autonomous Unmanned\nAerial Systems (UAS) (Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs), UAS carrying\npassengers (pax) worldwide aero market. According to the FAA, \xe2\x80\x9cNext Gen,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe current ATC upgrade which is many years out, would enable some 7,000\nUAS in controlled airspace in the U.S. when we need many millions for this\nnascent PAV market.\nMilitary \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cShort Legged fighters\xe2\x80\x9d and 707 derivative platforms for tankers,\ntransports and sensing. These are increasingly vulnerable to disparate\nthreats.\n\nSpace:\n\nSpace Access \xe2\x80\x93 Derivatives of 1950s era military missiles, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter living\nthrough chemistry\xe2\x80\x9d/chemical propulsion, small payload fraction, costs too\nhigh to enable \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial space\xe2\x80\x9d beyond legacy \xe2\x80\x9cearth utilities\xe2\x80\x9d (telecom\netc.) recent Space X developments are improving this situation\nHuman Space Exploration \xe2\x80\x93 Chemical propulsion (same 1950s era\nderivatives as military), Apollo mantras, self-contained expeditions, serious\ncost and safety issues beyond LEO, some interest in electric and fission\nnuclear propulsion\nSpace Science \xe2\x80\x93 The introduction of post-industrial age technologies (IT,\nsensing, robotics) has reduced the cost and increased the return from space\nscience activities, increasing \xe2\x80\x9cvalue per pound,\xe2\x80\x9d still conducting \xe2\x80\x9cselfcontained\xe2\x80\x9d missions vice establishing/utilizing reusable space infrastructures.\nAll Aeronautical and Space activities are challenged by several overarching\nissues:\n- Energetics Restrictions, Energy Budgets\n- Weight(s)\n- Cost(s)\nOf these energetics is the key issue, improvements in such could mitigate\nthe issues with weight and costs. We are essentially still largely in thrall to\nchemical energetics.\n\nNature of the Ongoing Technology Revolutions\nThere has been much written in recent decades of the several and\nmultiplying major ongoing technology revolutions, References 4-7. The first\nof these, the IT Revolution, provided the means for and ensured that the IT\nand subsequent revolutions promulgated worldwide to the point where the\nworld is avowedly technologically \xe2\x80\x9cflat.\xe2\x80\x9d Although extant listings and\n\ncodifications of the ongoing technology revolutions differ in detail, for\npurposes of the present report the major areas addressed include IT,\nBiologics, Nano, Quantum and Energetics, in the approximate order of their\nappearance. The IT Revolution began in the 1950s with the development of\nsolid state electronics, the Biologics Revolution in the 1960s -1970s with\nDNA, genomics, nano in the 1990s with self-forming nano systems and\ncarbon nanotubes. Quantum technology is developing rapidly in real time as\nan enablement of nano and the Energetics Revolution is nascent in terms of\nnew, seriously deviant, non-chemical approaches to energy generation and\nstorage.\nIT \xe2\x80\x93 The IT Revolution has produced an astounding factor of E9 in\ncomputing capability/speed since the late 1950s with another some E8 to\nE12 to go as we shift from silicon to biologics, optical, nano, molecular and\natomic computing. Then there is quantum computing, which for an\nincreasing number of applications is projected to provide up to some E44\nimprovements, a very large number, TBD. As this is written the fastest\ncomputer is a Chinese machine at some 30 plus petaflops, essentially human\nbrain speed.\nThe development of machine intelligence, after decades of suffering\ninadequate machine capability to make serious progress and a detour into\nexpert systems, (which have/are proving to be extremely useful/important)\nis now embarked upon biomimmetics/brain emulation approaches. There is\neven a possibility of \xe2\x80\x9cemergence,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e. make something complex enough and\nit \xe2\x80\x9cwakes up.\xe2\x80\x9d This latter is by some thought to be the source of human\nintelligence via evolutionary changes during the million plus years of the\nhunter-gatherer epoch. In fact, some posit that human intelligence can be\nimproved upon, is only a cul-de-sac of what is conceivable.\nThe IT Revolution has produced massive changes in human society and\neconometrics including the internet, its\xe2\x80\x99 impacts upon knowledge ability and\nan increasingly pervasive trend of \xe2\x80\x9cTele-Everything\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 tele\xe2\x80\x93commuting, telework, tele-shopping, tele-travel, tele-education, tele-medicine, telecommerce, tele-politics, tele-socialization, tele-entertainment, telecommunications and recently via printing tele-manufacturing, etc. A\n\nrelatively recent realization is that the extraordinary compilation, storage\nand availability of truly massive amounts of information and data could via\nprocesses under the mantra of \xe2\x80\x9cBig Data\xe2\x80\x9d reinvent much of both technical\nand commercial/business processes and content, including the elucidation of\nheuristic governing \xe2\x80\x9claws\xe2\x80\x9d for various situations.\nYet another major impact of the IT revolution involves enablement of\nrobotics writ large, which is on a clear path to pervasive autonomous\nsystems. The machines are rapidly supplanting humans in ever increasing\nareas of employment, are proving to be ever more productive and\ninexpensive and in an increasing number of areas more capable than\nhumans. The major recent and emerging IT human-machine interface\ncommunications development, 5 senses virtual reality, bodes well for greatly\naccelerating the tele-everything trend. The ongoing development of IT\nenabled 3-D printing is rapidly changing the manufacturing landscape, from\ncentral factories employing numbers of humans in the Industrial Age toward\nrobotic home \xe2\x80\x9cfab laboratories,\xe2\x80\x9d with potential major consequent impacts\nupon the requirements for cargo transport in Aeronautics and ISRU\ncapabilities for space exploration. Finally, what is evolving is a global brain,\nvia the web, which when combined with on-site printing is enabling a planet\nof inventors, both human and increasingly machine.\nBiologics \xe2\x80\x93 The major impacts of the Bio Revolution have thus far been in\nagriculture and medicine. In the former crops have been developed which\nare insect and disease resistant and which make more efficient use of\nresources whilst producing greater yields. Genomic medicine is under\ndevelopment for both prevention and treatment. Of especial interest in the\nBio arena is the now rapid development of synthetic biology, essentially bio\nengineering wherein bio systems are assembled out of piece parts for\nspecific technological applications. These applications include bio-production\nwherein bio processes are utilized for manufacturing and bio-functionalism\nwhere bio systems are applied for engineering purposes, an example of\nwhich might be \xe2\x80\x9cwatering your aircraft in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d The possibilities are\nvery intriguing.\n\nNano \xe2\x80\x93 Nano, which started out as self-organizing nano systems ala\nchemistry, is beginning to morph into the original Drexler \xe2\x80\x9cEngines of\nCreation\xe2\x80\x9d circa mid 1980s vision of assembling materials and devices atom\nby atom through mechanical vice chemical processes. This is termed\n\xe2\x80\x9cmolecular manufacturing,\xe2\x80\x9d essentially the penultimate printing approach.\nThe major nano impacts are in materials, surface chemistry across the board\nand in sensors. Nano proffers possibilities for \xe2\x80\x9cageless\xe2\x80\x9d materials, sans the\nusual dislocations and inhomogeneity\xe2\x80\x99s that instigate and promote crack\ngrowth. Nano also is enabling superb and inexpensive sensing with\nprojections for several trillion networked sensors worldwide in a decade, an\nexcellent start on a ubiquitous global sensor grid to provide input(s) to the\nemerging Global Brain. Nano systems are also greatly improving robotics\nand enabling \xe2\x80\x9cBrain Chips\xe2\x80\x9d to augment/enhance human brains as well as a\nmyriad of other human health and performance related contributions. Then\nthere is nanotubes, both carbon and nitride. The structural material vision\nfor contiguous versions of nano tubes, if such can be developed, proffers a\nfactor of 3 to 8 dry weight reduction almost across the board, not\npercentages, factors.\nQuantum \xe2\x80\x93 Quantum is of course the fundamental science behind lasers,\nsuperconductivity, quantum entanglement, super fluidity, Bose-Einstein\ncondensates etc. current attempts to engineer around decoherance could\nresult, in just over a decade some opine, in serious quantum computing.\nQuantum encryption is entering the commercial application stage. Lasers\nhave obviously developed into a massive number of applications, from\nmedicine through entertainment and materials processing to\ncommunications, including now free space communications with nearly\nunlimited bandwidth. Then there are quantum based sensors, quantum\ndeveloped materials, quantum non-linear optics including plasmonics and\nphotonics, quantum imaging, quantum optimized photo voltaics, and\nquantum electronics. Overall, Quantum Technology, engineering\napplications of quantum science, appears to be the next big thing beyond\nnano.\nEnergetics \xe2\x80\x93 Energetics for nearly all purposes has long relied primarily\nupon chemistry, with, starting in the mid-1900s, the addition of fission\n\nnuclear. Before the Industrial Revolution energy was produced by/via what\nare now termed \xe2\x80\x9crenewables,\xe2\x80\x9d especially biomass, water and wind. There\nare now several admittedly nascent but promising energetics alternatives,\nincluding Positrons (E9 times Chemical), LENR (from theory, up to E6 times\nChemical), low diffraction energy beaming (enables separation of propulsive\nmass and energy), SBER (E3 faster and cold chemistry), aneutronic inertial\nelectrostatically confined fusion, atomic fuels (e.g. H not H2, 20X Chemical),\nheat storage in Zeolites, SMES with CNT magnets (batteries at 20X\nchemical), metal air batteries, Isomers (E5 times Chemical), solid hydrogen\n(20X Chemical), neutral particle beams, cold fast compression (E3 times\nChemical), etc. These are coincident with ongoing reductions in energy\nrequirements via miniaturization and efficiency improvements/conservation\nwrit large. Several of these approaches/concepts would if successfully\nproven out and developed/engineered enable massive changes across the\nboard in society, climate and econometrics as well as aerospace and\ntechnology in general.\n\nEmerging Frontier Technology Enabled Aerospace Opportunities:\n1. Energy Rich Aeronautics, Space Science and Space Exploration\nOf the frontier energetics options Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR),\nPositrons and low diffraction energy beaming appear to proffer the most\ninteresting opportunities for aerospace, References 8 and 9. All of these\nwould enable separation of propulsive mass and energy, which are combined\nin chemical fuels. For LENR and positrons the heat produced could be used\neither to replace a combustor or to produce electricity for electric\npropulsion/propulsors via an increasingly interesting rack up of direct\nconversion approaches including pyroelectrics, thermoelectrics, thermalphoto voltaics and sterling/other thermal cycles. The propulsive mass would\nno longer have to also be a \xe2\x80\x9cfuel\xe2\x80\x9d/energy producer, which opens up a vast\nnumber of \xe2\x80\x9cpropulsive mass\xe2\x80\x9d sources of opportunity including Regolith and\nfar outer region atmospheric constituents obtainable via \xe2\x80\x9charvesting,\xe2\x80\x9d\nobviating the need to loft propulsive mass from the earth initially for inspace propulsion. Conventionally, lofted fuel, a propulsive mass and energy\n\nchemical combination, is the order of some 80 percent plus of the nearly\n1000 metric tons in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) required for the Humans-Mars\nexpeditions studied thus far. Such \xe2\x80\x9charvested\xe2\x80\x9d non-energetic propulsive\nmass is then made conductive via either alkaline doping or thermal inputs\nfrom what is avowedly \xe2\x80\x9cenergy rich\xe2\x80\x9d energetics, propulsive energy sources.\nThis approach produces a very different set of systems, architecture options,\ntradeoffs and optimizations as well as what should be far reduced costs\nenabled by the obviation of lofting propulsive mass (as fuel) from earth. The\nbeamed energy options, usually either microwave (MW) or various flavors of\nlasers, can produce electricity directly via either rectennas or photo voltaics\nrespectively. Having conductive propulsive mass and electricity available,\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) accelerators, operating at high thrust, could\nfrom studies produce Isp levels above 2000 seconds. Obviously for\naeronautical, in atmospheric propulsion the propulsion options would also\ninclude heating or increasing the conductivity of and accelerating ingested\natmospheric air in an open cycle and in lieu of the separate propulsive mass\nrequired for in space propulsion. For energy beaming newer developments,\nincluding meta materials, appear interesting for reducing beam diffraction,\nwhich would make the less expensive MW approaches more useful.\nThere is another class of advanced energetics which includes atomic fuels\n(e.g. H not H2) which is a mono fuel and could be utilized via either storage\nin solid hydrogen or as a result of formation/carriage of metallic hydrogen.\nOther options include the \xe2\x80\x9cslingatron\xe2\x80\x9d to loft g-tolerant payloads such as\nwater via a mechanical device and the Russian blast wave accelerator which\nis a \xe2\x80\x9cgun\xe2\x80\x9d utilizing semi-continuously staged explosives/detonation waves.\nThen there are neutral particle beams and even mass drivers as in-space\nalternatives. All of this is in addition to the more \xe2\x80\x9cusual\xe2\x80\x9d fission and even\nfusion zoo of options, along with some chemical fuels improvements such as\npoly nitrogen. In spite of this array of energetics possibilities, along with\ntheir major in most cases potential benefits aerospace continues largely to\npursue conventional chemical, and in some cases electric, propulsion along\nwith episodic studies of fission systems\n\nBeing \xe2\x80\x9cenergy rich\xe2\x80\x9d (as for example from LENR or Positrons) would produce\nvery much altered cost and operation design spaces, opportunities across\nthe board. Enabled would be such as:\n- Light-weight power/energy sources for space probes and instrumentation\n- Energetics for long lived and superb performance planetary hoppers and\nrovers\n- Entry Descent and Landing (EDL) wherein atmospheric constituents\ningested at higher altitudes would be heated and retroed at lower altitudes\n- On planet power and energy, as much as would be needed to prosecute\nserious ISRU, for exploration and later colonization\n- Energetics for planetary terraforming\n- High thrust in space propulsion\n- Energetics for active radiation protection\n- For aeronautics, negligible fuel fraction\n- Energetics for electric propulsion\n- With efficiency less important, unloaded lift fans, much quieter VSTOL\ndevices, of especial importance for personal air vehicles operating out of\nneighborhoods vice airports.\n- Energy focused upstream to largely obviate sonic boom\n- Negligible emissions in the climate sense\n- Enables huge loiter for sensor craft\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Via energetics for active flow control, enables extended envelope, bird like\nflight and flight through weather\n- Provides design margins to improve safety including all vehicle\nparachutes to land safely in the event of mishap, and armored engine\nsurrounds, etc.\n- Energetics for direct control of wake vortices to largely obviate the wake\nvortex hazard, which. along with circulation flow control to provide much\ngreater lift coefficient enables multiple takeoffs on the same runway at the\nsame time, increasing runway productivity, throughput.\nOverall, for Aero, far lower gross weights, higher speeds, lower noise,\nlower costs, lower emissions, greater range, Emissions solved, all weather\nsuperb ride quality, greater safety.\n- Enables hypersonic air breathing, greater thermal value added than H2\nfuel, enabling for high mach number utilization\nFor the military, greater EMP capabilities, VTOL to obviate need for\nincreasingly vulnerable runways and carrier decks, ultra long loiter are\nalways there vice trying to get there in time, along with the other aero\nbenefits already noted.\nOf all the technologies and opportunities discussed herein, advanced-torevolutionary energetics, beyond chemical energy density and sans the usual\nfission nuclear radiation safety, weight issues, is the most game changing.\nWhether the advanced energetics techs will be successful is TBD, but if they\nare not researched, worked the result is clear, either they will not be\navailable and we keep mainly limping along at the apex of the chemical\nenergetics mantra/solution spaces/agonizing over the various fission nuclear\nissues or others will develop them first. Many of the advanced/exotic\nenergetics approaches discussed herein would also, along with high altitude\nwind, apply to the massively important current and future worldwide\nclimate/energy issues.\n\nThe benefits of advanced energetics enabled fast transits to Mars are well\nknown:\n- Reduced costs overall\n- Reduced integrated radiation exposure\n- Reduced micro g exposure\n- Increased reliability due to reduced \xe2\x80\x9cduty time\xe2\x80\x9d\n- Reduced durability concerns/issues\n- Less \xe2\x80\x9cboil off\xe2\x80\x9d\n- Less consumables\n- Less \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological\xe2\x80\x9d problems\n- Improved public engagement due to enhanced \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency\xe2\x80\x9d\nReferences 10\xe2\x80\x9313 document portions of the energetics state of the art/\npossibilities for aerospace going forward.\n\n2. Reusable Space Infrastructures\nThus far, space activities have largely to almost exclusively been conducted\nusing expendable, one time vice reusable, launch vehicles, capsules, and on\nplanet equipage, e.g. for transportation, habitability and operability etc.\nThere was an attempt on the Space Shuttle to attain partial reusability\nespecially wrt the orbiter. The extensive refurbishment required flight to\nflight obviated much of the benefits of such. It is conceivable going forward\nto employ a much more reusable space exploration-to-commercialization\nmantra, which should reduce cost(s) and increase safety. Benefits of\n\nreusability are obviously a function of the number of reuses and any rework,\nmaintenance required. Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM)\npossibly including self-healing would be required to ensure safety and\noperability. What is suggested is essentially a panoply of reusable space\n\xe2\x80\x9cutilities.\xe2\x80\x9d An initial, simplex inventory of such might include:\n- Terrestrial, in-space, on planet/body beamers for propulsion and\nenergetics. As discussed, this allows the separation of propulsive mass and\nenergy as well as reusability. Such beamers could also power tethers for\norbit raising where magnetic fields are extant.\n- GPS, RF or Optical, for navigation/location on planets/ bodies. Navigation\nalternatives which could obviate the need for such a central, reusable\nsystem include \xe2\x80\x9cAtom Optics,\xe2\x80\x9d aka in USAF parlance \xe2\x80\x93 cold atoms proffering\norders of magnitude improvements in inertial guidance. Also quantum\nenhanced graviometers and magnetometers which could utilize the emerging\ndetailed scans, documentation of surface magnetic and gravity fields.\n- Space solar satellites around planets, bodies. These would not be\nimpacted by the dust issues that affect on planet/body photo voltaics, have\nhigher 24/7/365 output and be capable of servicing distributed areas,\nproviding both redundancy and reductions in surface infrastructure(s). The\nnano technology is greatly improving the efficiency of photo voltaics as are\ncombinational photo voltaics and thermal designs which utilize the photo\nvoltaics \xe2\x80\x9cwaste heat.\xe2\x80\x9d Obviously the in-space beamers referred to above\ncould also perform this function.\n- Establishment of a semi-regular \xe2\x80\x9cslow boat\xe2\x80\x9d cyclic transportation system,\nutilizing sails of various flavors or low thrust/high efficiency electric\npropulsion, between earth and other \xe2\x80\x9cbodies.\xe2\x80\x9d This could over time supply\nthe necessary initial ingredients for serious ISRU (discussed herein) as well\nas initial equipage and that required for expansion along with whatever\ncritical supplies that could not be produced on site. Such a transportation\nsystem would presumably be inexpensive compared to current practices/\napproaches.\n\n- Distributed space \xe2\x80\x9cservice stations,\xe2\x80\x9d for repairs, fueling, and most\nimportantly, for possibly saving lives, equipped as life boats in the event of\nserious vehicle or habitat malfunctions.\n- Virtual Exploration, Utilization of in situ inexpensive nano/other\ninstrumentation and other sensors/sensing such as from satellites as input\nto software which enables virtual reality exploration 24/7/365 for everyone\non (personal) demand. Optical free space communications would provide\ngreater band width.\n- Reusable Launch Vehicles, the key to serious launch cost reduction for\nconventional space access approaches, requires reasonable launch rates and\ndurable/low refurbishment designs for viability.\n- Momentum Tethers, from planet to solar system scales. These have\ninteresting-to-serious engineering issues of various flavors. Another perhaps\nrelated technology in some aspects/issues is space elevators.\n\n3. Serious ISRU\nThe emerging technologies are greatly increasing the prospective options\nand capabilities of ISRU, which would be far less expensive [extracting and\nbuilding it there] than hauling it there. ISRU could then year provide\ncommunications, navigation, solar sats, transportation devices, power and\nenergy, robotic adjuncts, fuels, radiation protection, medical\nfacilities/equipage, and habitats and laboratories. Also, since operability and\nreliability can be demonstrated/ assured before \xe2\x80\x9cleaving home (earth),\nsafety is greatly enhanced, and durability, reliability can be demonstrated,\nproven before committing humans. As already stated, the ISRU initiation\npackages could be delivered via inexpensive \xe2\x80\x9cslow boats (\xe2\x80\x9csails\xe2\x80\x9d or high Isp\nelectric). prospective components of an advanced ISRU approach include:\n- 3-D printing, on the way to molecular manufacturing. Multiple materials\nand imbedded electronics capabilities have been demonstrated. The 3-D\nprinting technology is developing very rapidly.\n\n- Autonomous Systems/Robotics, nano functionalization coupled to the\nincreasingly capable machine intelligence on the way via biomimmetics to/\napproaching human level in one to two decades provides an excellent\noutlook for the requisite autonomous robotics systems capable of executing\nserious ISRU.\n- Synthetic biology, assembling bio systems from piece parts, could\nconceivably provide both bio production and bio functionalism as part of an\nISRU overall system. \xe2\x80\x98Plants for Planets,\xe2\x80\x9d using the ongoing research on\nextremophiles, appear at this point to be do able, for both subsistence and\neventual terraforming. Bio-functionalism tasks could include sensing as well\nas construction aspects. Then there is Bio-mining, wherein biologics are\nutilized to process ores and minerals, enabling faster extraction rates, lower\nenergy requirements and lower overall extraction system mass than\nconventional chemical approaches.\n- LENR, lacking radiation issues and with some E4 times chemical energy\ndensity is especially interesting for both the energetics to execute ISRU and\npossibly capable, from extant experiments, of transmutations, altering\nindigenous materials into those desired/required for various ISRU tasks/\nresulting systems. Then there is long term storage of \xe2\x80\x9cinexpensive\xe2\x80\x9d\npositrons at E9 times chemical. Conceivably they could be generated on\nplanet using space solar.\nPerhaps the most important ISRU products are fuels and life support\n\xe2\x80\x9cfluids.\xe2\x80\x9d There are immense water resources on Mars, for example,\nincluding water, CO2, magnesium/other minerals, enabling production of\nmethane, O2, etc. To first order the cost of humans/Mars is proportional to\nup mass in low earth orbit, and a major portion of that up mass is fuels for\ntransportation writ large and life support on Mars. ISRU could supply these\nfuels etc. at little direct costs once the ISRU equipage is in place. Many of\nthe humans/Mars costs are in paying people, ISRU can be wholly robotic.\nAs a simplex example, Martian CO2 could be used for shielding, fuel cells,\nO2 production, carbon for carbon nano tubes (CNTs), pressurized rockets,\n\nCH4 production, polyethylene production, and in atmosphere solar pumped\nlasers.\n\n4. Reduced Cost for Space Access\nProbably the greatest cost element associated with space faring, space\noperations for whatever purpose is space access. Since the 1950s this has\nbeen accomplished using variants of military heritage expendable rockets\nwith current costs in the thousands of dollars per pound to low earth orbit.\nInternational systems with lower indigenous labor rates are less than U.S.\nlaunch costs, although Space X is making progress in bringing down costs\nand even developing versions that may enable prices per pound below a\nthousand, possibly far below a thousand. This is accomplished by reducing\nthe marching army and utilizing up to date design and manufacturing\napproaches and reusability. The ongoing miniaturization, the increasing\nability to produce the same functionalization in ever smaller packages is\naltering in real time the space access landscape for many payloads. Cooperative concepts of operations are being studied as are deployable\nmembranes to enable large apertures using small payloads and the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) research on Microelectrical\nMechanical Systems (MEMS) rocket turbine feed pumps could provide\n(down) scalable space access for nano satellites. The humans however are\nnot shrinking and therefore they and their equipage which scales to their\nsize continue to present the same cost and safety challenges. There are a\nvast plethora of alternative space access possibilities that have not yet\nreceived serious study, at this point most are at the viewgraph engineering\nstage, although some are beyond that (References 10 and 14). Note, this\nparticular summary does not include either fission or fusion nuclear\napproaches due to their innate safety and weight issues. However they\nshould obviously be included as part, an important part, of the overall range\nof possibilities. The non-fission/fusion alternative space access approaches,\nwhich should be triaged and studied sufficiently to allow comparative\nanalysis with extant approaches for cost and safety include:\n\n- Momentum Tethers, These are essentially single point of failure devices\nthat are in the reusable infrastructure category but would constitute major\ndevelopment and employment investments. Some systems studies indicate\npotential problems with material degradation from upper atmosphere excited\nstates. Tethers could be applied to both space launch and in-space and are\napparently \xe2\x80\x9cdo able\xe2\x80\x9d without recourse to nano tube material strength levels\nalthough such would possibly allow increased reliability and safety.\n- Energy Beaming, enabling the separation of propulsive mass and energy,\nis a very different space transportation construct that is just now receiving\nserious study. All requisite technologies including pointing, rectennas or\nPhoto Voltaics (PV), Microwave (MW) or lasers, approaches to reduce beam\ndiffraction, etc. are undergoing rapid development. This requires reusable\ninfrastructures (the beamers) and therefore strategic planning and cooperation to amortize the costs over many future launches. The energy can\nbe used either to heat or to create electricity utilized in very high Isp\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) accelerator propulsors.\n- Advanced Materials, Rocket payload fraction is extremely sensitive to dry\nweight. The dry weight reductions of factors of 3 to 8 proffered by\ncontiguous nano tube structural materials would by itself constitute a\nrevolution in space access. Whether such can be created is at this point TBD\nbut obviously very worth the effort to find out if it can be done.\n- Robotics, Much of the costs of space access and space propulsion are\ndirectly attributable to paying people. Fuel per se is quite inexpensive.\nMuch of the Shuttle operational cost was due to the \xe2\x80\x9cmarching army\xe2\x80\x9d\nrequired to operate and refurbish it. Human labor costs are involved in all\nfacets of space propulsion including R&D, manufacture, transportation and\noperation. Space X has reduced these costs and they can be reduced much\nmore as we continue to replace humans by robots and develop \xe2\x80\x9cprinting\xe2\x80\x9d\nmanufacturing.\n- Exotic Energetics, Progress is being made in positron storage as\npositronium. As stated previously, positrons posit energy density some E9\ntimes chemical with very reasonable radiation (.5 Mev Gamma) and no\n\nresidual radiation. They essentially produce heat which can be used as\ncombustor replacements for open cycles, heat propulsive mass or to produce\nelectricity for various flavors of electric propulsion. LENR, which from the\nweak interaction theory is some E4 to E6 times chemical, has at this early\nstage of understanding/development no known radiation issues, also\nproduces heat and therefore can be used in the same way as positrons.\n- Launch Assist, There are several flavors of launch assist with capabilities\nacross the speed range. At the upper range is the slingatron, which is\nalleged to be capable of imparting up to 45,000 feet per second at sea/\nground level. In the 1960s under NASA Project Radio Attenuation\nMeasurement (RAM), the agency developed a technique to protect such\npayloads from the extreme heat transfer and drag encountered during\ntransit of the lower atmosphere. The injection of a very small stream of\npressurized liquid water from the nose reduced both drag and heating during\nflight tests at 18,000 and 25,000 feet/second. Such nose region water jet\ninjection could also be used during ascent within the sensible atmosphere for\nrockets writ large to reduce atmospheric drag. Other types of ground level\nlaunch assist include rail guns, coil guns, and the Russian blast wave\naccelerator. The Mag Lev approach is a form of rail gun. It is even thought\npossible to utilize laser guided polymer stabilized water jets to provide an\ninitial boost. Energy beaming can also be considered a form of launch assist.\nMany of these impart large acceleration forces during launch which restricts\nthe payload possibilities to those that are g tolerant. The Army has\ndeveloped electronic packages for artillery rounds that can withstand\nelevated g levels, increasing the potential payload possibilities. Some might\nconsider launching from aircraft as a form of ground assist, others book keep\nthis as an alternative first stage, albeit a reusable one.\n- Safety improvements could include pressurized tanks vice turbine feed\npumps. Such pressurized tankage would be enabled by advanced materials\nand eliminate one of the foremost safety issues wrt rocket engines. An\nalternative approach to the elimination of turbine feed pump safety issues is\nto employ pulse detonation wave engines, wherein the detonation wave(s)\nsupply much of the requisite pressure increases. Since the turbine feed\n\npumps are also a serious cost issue their elimination might also reduce cost\nas well as increase safety.\n- Advanced fuels, There are an increasing number of advanced fuel\npossibilities, with performance far less than the beamer/MHD accelerator\ncombination and less than the exotics discussed herein but greater than the\ncurrent norms. These include \xe2\x80\x9ccold silicon,\xe2\x80\x9d Metallic H2, Atomic H/C/B, Polynitrogen (e.g. N4), and possibly metastable helium. Also in this genre are\nseveral avowedly higher Isp fuels (Isp ~ 700 sec) which are currently\ndeemed too reactive/dangerous to be utilized, these include Flourine/\nLithium Hydride and O2/Beryllium Hydride. Then there is Structural Bond\nEnergy Release (SBER), which, via applying shear and pressure to materials\nenables cold chemistry at orders of magnitude greater reaction rates which\nwould serve as an effective \xe2\x80\x9cspark plug\xe2\x80\x9d to combust materials not usually\nconsidered fuels. Not a fuel per se but proffering greater than chemical\nenergy storage is the, at this point conceptual, possibility of superconducting\nmagnetic energy storage using CNT magnets which provide the material\nstrength to contain the enabled large increases in magnetic field strength\nwith major reductions in losses. Estimates indicate possibilities for a\n\xe2\x80\x9cbattery\xe2\x80\x9d at some 20 times chemical energy storage density.\n- Pulse Detonation Wave Rockets, These nearly constant volume\ncombustion, aka Humphrey cycle rockets enable major reductions in turbine\nfeed pump pressure resulting in serious cost and safety benefits. There are\ndesigns extant that utilize wave dynamics for valving and ignition, further\nreducing cost and weight and increasing cycle efficiency. Detonation while\nthe fuel is a liquid has been suggested as a means of attaining higher thrust.\n- Air Breathers, There is a many decade long heritage of and interest in\nspace access studies and research employing air breathers. This is mainly\nmotivated by their much greater Isp than rockets for Mach numbers into the\nteens. For the many military flexible launch metrics air breathers are a very\nintriguing approach. However, they have several problems wrt the usual\ncivilian space access metrics of cost and safety. Firstly, space access via air\nbreathers requires several propulsion systems, one to accelerate to\n\nMach 3ish where the hypersonic air breathing flow path becomes effective,\nThe Ramjet/Scramjet air breathing propulsion system for Mach 3ish to Mach\n12ish or less and then a rocket system to accelerate the rest of the way.\nThese multiple propulsion systems increase dry weight and dry weight is\nwhat you pay for in space access, not gross weight, fuel is generally\nrelatively inexpensive. Also, the thrust to weight of an air breather is low\ncompared to a rocket and therefore the vehicle has to accelerate over a long\ndistance/time, acquiring drag and heating in the process, requiring yet more\nheat protection system weight. The dry weight increase usually increases\nthe vehicle cost compared to a rocket.\nThe other major air breather issue involves development costs. Hypersonic\nair breathers are very aero/propulsion integrated machines. Cannot, as you\ncan with rocket engines, tie them down in a thrust stand and test them,\nneed a hot hypersonic flow facility to do the development testing and such\ndo not exist at the requisite full vehicle scale. Therefore vehicle\ndevelopment would necessarily entail many hypersonic flight experiments at\na large cost per flight, would dictate a huge development cost, as well as an\nextended one.\nIt may be possible to reduce these cost issues with air breathers by\nimproving mod-sim to allow reduction of the number of developmental\nflights required and to optimize the propulsion cycle and flow path to reduce\nlosses and weight. There are a plethora of as yet unoptimized Scramjet\ndesign approaches that could be studied to attain reduced losses and weight.\nThese include utilization of the complex internal shock systems and fuel\ninjection flow physics to increase turbulence level/mixing, use of passive\nseparated flow control devices vice using a heavy isolater for Ramjet\noperation, increasing fuel temperature via body heat regeneration and\ninjector optimization for accruing thrust from fuel injection (especially critical\nat higher M<ach numbers) and premixing to reduce the length of the\ncombustor/reduce combustor losses.\n\n5. In Space Propulsion and Power Approaches\nPhoto Voltaics, The Nano Tech Revolution proffers serious improvements in\nPV efficiency, up to some 70 percent is suggested, along with combined\ndevices wherein the \xe2\x80\x9cwaste heat\xe2\x80\x9d is also harvested, added to the device\noutput. Related alternatives include pyroelectrics for conversion of both\nwaste heat and solar thermal, also alleged to ultimately exhibit high\nefficiency, utilizes transient thermal inputs.\nThe exotics, such as LENR and positrons, at some E4 plus to E9 times\nchemical respectively are obvious in space propulsion and power game\nchangers.\n- Sails, Solar/Photon sails, Magnetic sails, mass driver \xe2\x80\x9ccatchers\xe2\x80\x9d\n- Beamers, separating propulsive mass and energy, enabling harvesting\nand utilization of upper atmosphere and regolith etc. propulsive \xe2\x80\x9cmass of\nconvenience.\xe2\x80\x9d Included in this category are MWs, lasers, neutral particle\nbeams and \xe2\x80\x9cmass beaming/mass drivers.\xe2\x80\x9d A key to MW utilization and also\nlasers is reduction of beam diffraction. Approaches to such include meta\nmaterials, and bessel, X waves, bowtie, mathieu and airy beam forms.\nThere is some very nascent research which suggests possibilities for doing\nenergy transfer via teleportation, TBD (e.g. Reference 15).\n- Advanced fuels, see previous section/discussion\n- Hydrogen Storage, The potential use of nano tubes as structural materials\nproffers possibilities for non cryo storage of hydrogen, aided by casimir force\nengineering, within the \xe2\x80\x9cpores\xe2\x80\x9d of the tubes. This approach to H2 storage\nwould obviate \xe2\x80\x9cboil off\xe2\x80\x9d issues, which are obviously also addressable by\nrefrigeration, given the energetics to operate such. Such materials are also\nthought to be configurable as ultra-capacitors, enabling storage of electricity.\n- Electric Propulsion, There are a plethora of electric propulsion approaches,\nmainly producing low thrust but at large to huge Isp values. There are two\nMHD approaches that proffer high thrust, claim Isp in the 20,000 range and\n\nutilize magnetic nozzles \xe2\x80\x93 VASIMIR and FRC (Field Reversed Configuration).\nThese are candidates to provide the requisite fast transits for humans\nbeyond LEO, but require a serious energy source. Current concepts\nconcentrate on Nuc fission but going forward positrons and LENR are\npotentially interesting candidates.\n6. Advanced Air Traffic Control (ATC)\nThe current air traffic control system has many known limitations, utilizes\nconsiderable human involvement and is relatively expensive to operate and\nextremely difficult to modify. Along with increasing traffic delays and cost(s)\nthe major driver for a serious redo of the ATC system is to enable large\nnumbers of UAS in controlled airspace for both civilian and national security\napplications. The current ATC upgrade project, NEXTGEN, apparently will\nultimately allow some 7,000 UAS in CONUS airspace at any one time,\nwhereas the then year need, military and civilian, is for many millions. The\nongoing Technology Revolutions could enable a much less expensive, wholly\nelectronic system which would allow the requisite many millions of UAS in\ncontrolled airspace, thereby enabling an estimated new ~ $1T/ year\nworldwide aeronautical market in UAS/ PAVE. Advanced technologies for all\nof the elements of such an automatic ATC system are either available or\nnascent, including techs for communications, sensors, navigation, software,\ncomputers, machine intelligence and \xe2\x80\x9carchitectures.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe major impediment to developing such a seriously updated, enabling\nATC system is the time/schedule, cost and safety aspects of modifying the\nexisting system. A breakthrough way forward would be to build, experiment\nwith, prove out the new system as initially piece parts and then as a system\nin/as a giant simulation operating outside of, not interacting with except to\nextract data from, the existing system. When the new system has been\nproven to be fail safe, safe wrt functionalities, piece parts and as a\nfunctioning all up system, then the old one would be \xe2\x80\x9cdisconnected\xe2\x80\x9d and the\nnew one employed.\nRevolutionary ATC system communications options include ground and\nspace based RF and free space optics and farther term, possibilities for\n\nquantum vector/scalar high bandwidth communications that cannot be\njammed (Reference 16). Navigation options include passive location (PCL),\nutilization of TV tower, other ambient RF, which can have many orders of\nmagnitude greater signal strength than GPS, and advanced magnetometers\nand graviometers, operating in a tercom mode off the detailed mappings\nfrom space of the planets gravity and magnetic fields. Then there is atom\noptics, termed by the USAF cold atoms, a Bose-Einstein (B-E) condensate\nproducing a single stream of atoms at the same quantum state which, using\nlasers, can provide orders of magnitude improvements in inertial navigation.\nSensors include infared (IR), lidar, radar, Electromagnetic (E-M) emissions,\nacoustics (including infrasound) and electro-optic.\nA candidate architecture for an advanced ab initio ATC system is a\ncombination of centrally monitored/oversight and locally controlled/free\nflight with real and advanced time deconfliction in a swarm environment.\nVehicle flow control can be utilized to greatly expand flight envelope and\nimproved energetics and materials could provide margins for crashworthy/\ncrash proof via \xe2\x80\x98chutes and/or a combination of aero and propulsive controls\nreconfigured to \xe2\x80\x9cfly while hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n7. Approaches to \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d aircraft emissions\nThe current approaches to reducing aircraft emissions are partial solutions\nand include higher load factors, improved routing, increased vehicle\nefficiency (aero, propulsion, weight) and, on the part of the public, teletravel (the U.S. is evidently past peak car). There are other approaches\nwhich could essentially solve the several aircraft emissions issues (NOx, CO2,\nWater), e.g.:\nLENR or Positron Energetics, except for some NOx produced by heating air\nwhich could by design be minimized there are no emission issues with these\nexotic energetic approaches now known.\nBiomass fuels, especially those produced via cyanobacteria or halophytes\n(salt plants grown on deserts using seawater agriculture) could possibly\n\nactually sequester CO2. Such fuels do not impact except favorably fresh\nwater and arable land issues. They result in a possibly better than a closed\nCO2 cycle, proffer massive capacity and their NOx could be much reduced\nvia mod-simulation combustor engineering as is done now. Their water\nemissions could be addressed via flying below the tropopause where water is\nthought to be cooling, not warming, in terms of climate. Flying in that\naltitude range would require lower wing area and some enhanced flow\ncontrol provided ride quality as would be \xe2\x80\x9cflying in the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\nElectric Propulsion, there is increasingly serious interest in electric\npropulsion for air vehicles. Such has been used for UAS and several light\naircraft, with studies ongoing for application to larger vehicles. As the\nbatteries improve, especially to the storage densities of metal air batteries,\nthis becomes a viable emissions reduction approach. LENR, positrons,\nenergy beaming and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) with\nCNT magnets could also provide the electrical energy required sans\nemissions issues. Then there are fuel cells, possibly using H2 stored in a\nnano tube structure. Fuel cells produce water which again would entail\nflying below the tropopause.\n\n8. Nano Tubes, a Near Ultimate Multifunctional Material\nAs stated previously, nano tubes have revolutionary potential, nearly\nacross the board, to reinvent aerospace, and much else (Reference 17). If\ncontiguous structural nanotube materials can be invented/developed/\nfabricated their projected impact on dry weight is factors of 3 to 8. There\nare some ongoing efforts in this regard, including going beyond conventional\nmaterials processing approaches (chemical, thermal, impact/stress,\npressure) and exploring ionizing radiation of various flavors, magnetics,\nplasmonics and shear. Besides dry weight reductions applications include\nflywheels for energy storage, magnetic sails, tethers, ultra capacitors,\nadvanced sensors, and petaflop computing. Overall, nano tubes are\nprojected to be a nearly optimal multifunctional material, potentially\nproviding/combining superb structural performance with imbedded/integral\n\nsensors, actuators, computing and energy storage, either electrical or\nhydrogen in the \xe2\x80\x9cpores\xe2\x80\x9d via casimir force engineering.\n\n9. Reinvention of Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (VSTOL)\nPersonal Air Vehicles, aka Pave, are projected to be UAS carrying PAX, to\nsubsume much of the domestic scheduled airline and automobile markets,\nand attain a worldwide market in the range of $1T/year. Enablers for this\nmarket level include the/a electronic, revolutionary ATC system discussed\nherein and the capability to operate out of the street in front of an individual\nholding, sans airports per se, which requires quiet V/STOL capabilities. The\ncurrent, usual gold standard for VTOL is rotary wing, which has historically\nbeen burdened with high maintenance costs, low cruise efficiency, and\nsafety concerns. There are a plethora of V/STOL alternatives, VTOL per se is\nnot required for PAVE, but Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) is for\n\xe2\x80\x9cneighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d out of the street in front of an individual holding, operation.\nThese STOL alternatives to the \xe2\x80\x9chelicopter\xe2\x80\x9d for PAVE include:\n- Channel wings with circulation control, The first relatively serious\nmanifestation of this was the Custer channel wing, with later versions\nstudied at Antonov. These early versions did not have circulation control,\nwhich was added in later NASA-Georgia Institute of Technology work. The\napproach employs a curved span wise wing configuration (which could be\nstrut braced) with a turboprop engine placed in the curved section. At zero\nforward speed the engine provides air flow over the curved wing section,\nproducing lift, which can be augmented greatly by employing/adding\ncirculation control. The resulting lift coefficient approaches 12ish, enabling\nsuperb STOL performance.\n- Auto-gyros, these are well known and zeroth order employ a flow turned\nrotary wing for lift and a separate engine, device for thrust. There are\nextant versions that are inexpensive, provide climate controlled carriage for\n2 over a respectable range with adequate speed and STOL operation of far\nless than 100 feet. There are roadable versions under development.\n\nCyclo-gyro machines, these have a horizontal rather than a vertical axis of\nrotation and resemble agricultural harvesting machines. They are still, have\nlong been, in the research stage with considerable recent progress made.\nThe concept can provide VTOL and quiet operation, the latter critical for\nneighborhood operation.\nRevolutionary energetics, the energetics capabilities of such as LENR and\npositrons could provide the energy density to both unload the lift fans,\nthereby reducing noise, and make direct propulsive lift feasible, economically\nand performance wise.\nCNT Springs, The projected capabilities of CNT springs are several orders of\nmagnitude greater than conventional steel springs, possibly providing an\nopportunity, either in an adjunctive fashion or as a mainline approach, to\n\xe2\x80\x9cspring into the air,\xe2\x80\x9d with recompression occurring upon, during landing.\nV/STOL concepts also apply to planetary exploration, allowing far greater\ncoverage then crawling around a small portion of the landscape.\n\n10. Drag Due to Lift Reduction\nFor a well designed cruise aircraft drag due to lift is some 40 percent plus\nof the total cruise drag, and a huge percentage of the drag during takeoff\ndue to the much higher Lift Coefficient (Cl). While there have been major\ncampaigns to reduce the 50 percent of the cruise drag which is skin friction,\nprimarily via various flavors of Laminar Flow Control, there has not been, for\ndecades, sizable attempts to reduce drag due to lift. Many of the conceptual\napproaches to Drag Due to Lift (DDL) reduction, beyond that obtainable with\nwinglets, C-tips and other wing tip geometry modifications, involve\nsignificant alterations in aircraft configuration, i.e. deviations, often\nsignificant deviations, from the canonical 707 derivative prevailing mantra.\nSuch approaches include:\n- Strut/Truss braced wings, the most straight forward method of reducing\ndrag due to lift is via increased span. There are limits to this imposed by\n\nboth structural issues and the 80 meter box at the airport gates. The 80\nmeter box restriction can be circumvented via folding, hinged outer wing\nsections, for which there are extant and viable designs. The structural\nissues can be addressed via utilization of external strut or truss bracing.\nWork by VPI and others indicates major reductions in drag due to lift are\npossible using external strut or truss bracing. This approach, besides\nproffering the possibility of some 75 percent DDL reduction, also enables the\nwing thickness to be reduced, and therefore the wing sweep. This, along\nwith the concomitant wing chord/Reynolds Number reduction necessitated\nby the increased span, results in the opportunity to establish \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d\nlaminar flow over major portions of the wing, reducing skin friction much.\nSuch skin friction reduction is required, having reduced the DDL, to obtain\nan efficient balanced design. Initial versions of truss bracing are under\nstudy in the NASA N+3 research program. Obtaining extreme sweep\nreductions, from the VPI work, may be facilitated by going to inflatable inner\nwing sections.\n- Wing Tip Engines, these have been studied, primarily using propellers but\nby Whitcomb using GTEs, to reduce drag due to lift, with often significant\nresults into the 40 percent range. The wing strut/truss bracing discussed\nherein could provide the structural efficiency necessary to apply this wing tip\nengine approach for DDL reduction. Since, according to Lighthill, \xe2\x80\x9cwe build\nwhat we can compute,\xe2\x80\x9d the historical inability to seriously compute the wing\ntip engine effects may have held up the adoption of this approach. The\nother issue with this is the engine out effects, which can be countered either\nby going to thrust vectoring or circulation control on the vertical tail.\nThere are other potential DDL reduction approaches that require \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery\xe2\x80\x9d\nclass research. These include leading edge bumps, ala the pectoral fins on\nhumpback whales, and the curious bendable portion of the shark caudal fin\ntip region. Then there is oscillatory span loading, which has been shown to\nseriously delay-to-obviate the tip vortex rollup, which should alter the\nrotation of the lift vector into the drag direction \xe2\x80\x93 the origin of drag due to\nlift. There has been some study of horizontal axis ring wings, anchored to\nthe fuselage base. The DDL reduction is order of some 50 percent but there\n\nare issues with weight and wetted area increases, design/optimization\nstudies are required.\n\n11. Detailed, Localized Climate Information\nThe latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report\nmakes it clear that disruptive climate change is occurring in a time scale of\nyears-to-decades and that human engendered influences are either largely\nresponsible or at least accelerating the processes. The IPCC reports are, by\nthe necessity of their intensive editing processes, based upon the most solid\nscience and their projections have thus far proven over the years to be\nextremely conservative. There are a series of positive feedbacks for which\nthe scientific observations are not yet complete enough to be included in\nthese reports/projections. However, these positive feedbacks are thought\nby some to be largely responsible for the faster than IPCC report climate\nchanges that are occurring. Estimates of the potential impacts of these\npositive feedbacks are very worrisome to dire.\nThese positive feedbacks include gasification, due to temperature increases,\nof the massive amounts of fossil methane and CO2 contained in the oceans\nand the Tundra and the ocean acidification due to CO2 uptake, resultant\nimpacts upon the algae CO2 sequestration and overall ocean CO2 uptake\nreductions. Then there are the reductions in planet reflectivity due to\nreduced ice coverage and coverage of that ice by carbon particles, and the\nincreased water vapor content in the atmosphere due to increased\nevaporation caused by temperature increases. The major worry, the\nreductions in the ocean Thermal Haline circulation resulting in anoxic\nconditions and overgrowth of cyanobacteria producing hydrogen sulfide,\nmakes the atmosphere toxic and takes down the ozone layer. All of this\noccurred previously during the Permian Extinction, which was triggered by\nCO2 release from Siberian volcanoes at release rates some two orders of\nmagnitude less than the current anthropogenic release rates, we appear to\nbe replaying the Permian at an accelerated pace.\n\nAll these climate concerns/issues requires seriously detailed scientific data\nto develop and verify numerical/theoretical simulations/projections and to\nquantify the feedbacks in sufficient detail such that they can be included in\nthe IPCC projections. An additional requirement for much more detailed\nclimate information/data devolves from the need to, on a local and regional\nbasis, provide detailed information and support for climate change\nadaptation by various means. Given the major potential impacts and\nexpense of various climate adaption approaches accurate projections on a\nlocalized basis are essential. Current climate data acquisition is mainly\ncomprised of a series of satellite and ground based instruments along with\nsome aircraft insitu campaigns. There is even a potential mitigation/\ngeoengineering approach involving utilization of lasers to incite aerosol\nformation. Aerosol measurements/understanding are particularly critical as\naerosol climate impacts are approximately equal in magnitude but opposite\nin sign compared to CO2. Some half of the aerosols are anthropogenic and\na large percentage are formed in-situ in the atmosphere. Potential data\naugmentation and alternative data acquisition approaches include:\nNote \xe2\x80\x93 all of these would benefit from, are enabled by the technology\nrevolutions especially nano sensors, IT and materials.\n- InSitu Smart Dust, Micron (or larger/smaller) motes which contain,\nthanks to the IT and Nano Technology revolutions, imbedded\ncommunications, sensors, energy harvesting and computing. These could be\nnetworked to provide possibly detailed and inexpensive coverage with cooperative concepts of operations and sparse array for aperture as needed.\n- Extremely long loiter mini-Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs)/ UAS that are\nenergized either by exotic energetics or beamed energy, with advanced\nsensors and communications.\n- Utilization/exploitation of the emerging \xe2\x80\x9cglobal sensor grid,\xe2\x80\x9d with some\ntrillions of networked sensors projected worldwide in a decade. We are\nbusily putting sensors on everything, because with the tech revolutions we\nnow can. Inclusion of climate applicable sensors and use of \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d\napproaches should improve, inform localized climate knowledge/ projections.\n\n12. Military Frontier Aerospace Opportunities\nThe increasing vulnerabilities and costs of airfields, short legged fighters,\nforeign bases and transport airframe based tankers, transports and sensor\ncraft suggests a re-examination of future aerospace power projection\napproaches. The exotic energetics approaches discussed herein would\ngreatly alter military range, payload, loiter, speed, maneuverability, flight\nenvelope and lethality, providing at the same time serious cost and size\nreductions. Even in the absence of such energetics breakthroughs there are\na collection of alternative global precision strike approaches that are\nbecoming increasingly enabled. These would, could obviate the need for in\ntheater and strategic aircraft and overseas bases, as well as provide major\noverall cost reductions with far more survivability and enable the qualities of\nquantity. All of these concepts \xe2\x80\x9cstage\xe2\x80\x9d out of Continental United States\n(CONUS), provide global precision strike. The swarm/horde nature of these\napproaches makes defense quite difficult.\n- Swarms of transoceanic UAVs, Folks have thus far successfully flown the\nAtlantic non-stop with UAVS smaller than 14 pounds. The MIT Aero folks\nindicate the smallest non-stop over the Atlantic UAV is some 1 Kg or so. All\nthis indicates an opportunity for essentially undetectable ultra inexpensive\nswarms of aerial strike platforms with, thanks to precision strike and\nalternative kill mechanisms, an \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting\xe2\x80\x9d set of warheads/effects.\n- The \xe2\x80\x9cSlingatron,\xe2\x80\x9d a mechanical device that uses wall plug power to\naccelerate thousands of 50 KG projectiles per minute to Intercontinental\nBallistic Missile (ICBM) speeds. Uses a spiral tube mounted on 100 Hz\nvibration motors to put, via a \xe2\x80\x9chula Hoop motion, Coriolis forces into the\nprojectiles.\n- The \xe2\x80\x9cBlast Wave Accelerator\xe2\x80\x9d, an I-beam from which is suspended\nannular rings of explosives which sequentially detonate, with the detonation\nwaves accelerating a projectile to ICBM speeds\n\n- Micro Rockets/ICBMs, MIT has developed a MEMS turbine feed pump\nwhich enables construction of miniaturized ICBS that are Sports Utility\nVehicle (SUV) transportable and inexpensive, swarms/hordes of such.\n- Global reach unrefueled oblique wing strike aircraft.\n- Swarms of transoceanic Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) with popup\nmissiles, especially effective against areas with extensive and often largely\nundefended shorelines. The short time of flight enabled by the historical\nconcentration of population and infrastructure near seacoasts makes\ninterception \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n13. Reliability for Long Space Missions/Exploration beyond LEO\nThe various \xe2\x80\x9cDesign Reference Missions\xe2\x80\x9d for long duration exploration (e.g.\nMars) have not, thus far seriously considered the mission/weight/cost\nimpacts of ensuring reliability, functionality, providing fail safe safe\noperability across the board. Reliability issues that should probably be\nconsidered, worked, include:\n- Planetary Dust. Moon dust caused problems and Martian dust is\napparently thought to be far worse in terms of health and mission impacts\n(carcinogens, oxidants etc.). Provision, design for dust free everything\n(habitants, transfer locks, suits, \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation\xe2\x80\x9d) will be expensive and\ndifficult. There is concern that the effects of the highly oxidative Martian\nregolith, containing perchlorates, might be especially damaging at the O2\nrich, high pressure and moisture conditions inside the habitats.\n- The usual issues, micrometeoroids, micro gravity, radiation effects.\n- The long duration of the mission, aging, fatigue, durability etc.\n- System level, cascading failures, non-linear effects.\n\n- Verification and validation (V&V) for fail safe, including the psychology of\nthe humans.\nThe observed effects of space writ large [micro g, radiation] upon bio are\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cbugs\xe2\x80\x9d become more virulent, worrisome. The human gut contains\nmany thousands of Bio bits that, evidently, might develop over time into\neither pathogens or corrosives which potentially could become serious\nproblems. We have no long duration experience wrt such issues except on\nstation, which is protected by the Van Allen Belts from full radiation.\nObviously the serious up front ISRU and prepositioning approaches, where\nfunctionalities are in place and fully evaluated pre-need, along with system\nredundancies and serious up front/development testing and extended\nevaluation under realistic conditions would contribute to the overall reliability\nissues writ large. However, long duration human missions beyond LEO could\nmore than conceivably have serious unknown unknowns. While we have\nsuccessfully sent robotic probes etc. on such long duration missions the\npresence of humans, and the requirement to keep them \xe2\x80\x9cpink and warm\xe2\x80\x9d\nand breathing changes greatly the number and details of mission\nrequirements and requisite technologies. The possibility mentioned herein of\nbugs from the human gut, carried aboard on/with the humans, becoming\nunder deep space conditions and over time serious corrosion and/or\npathogenic issues is probably just one of many potential unknowns going in.\nIf this potential issue is determined to be a real problem then solution\nspaces will be \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d Bugs tend to build up an immunity to\n\xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d approaches. The robotic missions are sterilized before launch,\ncannot sterilize the humans internally. Then there is the extra cost, weight\netc. to ensure reliability/operability, given definition of the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cdesign\xe2\x80\x9d\nissues.\n\n14. Initial/Boundary Conditions for Modeling and Simulation (Mod Sim)\nThe rapid development of computing machine capabilities and algorithms\nhas enabled mod sim to increasingly replace physical experimentation. One\nresult of this shift has been a reduction in wind tunnel usage. The expected\n\ndevelopment of quantum computing should massively accelerate this trend\ntoward computing for research, design and development. Computation for\naerospace usually requires knowledge of applicable initial and boundary\nconditions. There are several classes of problems for which boundary and\ninitial conditions are particularly critical, these include cases where critical\nphenomena/physics are rapid-to-exponential, where major changes result\nfrom quite small initial/boundary condition changes. Perhaps the most\nnotorious of such is boundary layer transition, where requisite knowledge of\nall of the ambient and vehicle induced disturbance fields, including details of\nthe ambient particulates, are essentially unknowable to the precision\nrequired. Therefore, while transition can be increasingly computed as an\ninitial/boundary value problem, the lack of definitive initial and boundary\nconditions limits the computational predictive precision obtainable and could\neven shift/obscure the major causative instability modes.\nOther situations where the computability accuracy is affected to first order\nby the incomplete knowledge of initial and boundary conditions include\nmulti-phase flows, icing, fluid/particle flows, ignition, arcing in gases,\natmospheric aerosols, fire(s), fracture/fatigue and durability, corrosion,\nsurface chemistry effects, micro-gravity effects and surface catalysis.\nThe development, enabled by IT and Nano and Quantum Technologies, of a\nserious global sensor grid, along with localized application(s) of such\nsuperlative sensors should provide some improvement going forward for this\nserious limit upon mod simulation for aerospace.\n\n15.\n\nOther Frontier Aerospace Opportunities:\n\nSBER as an Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) sensor, It is well known that\nearthquakes produce E-M signatures. Research and theory of SBER\nphenomena indicate that shear with some pressure, per the now many\ndecades of SBER experiments, collapses band gaps and produces E-M\nsignatures, along with the much faster cold chemistry previously discussed.\nSuch shear stress induced E-M emissions have been utilized for NDE\npurposes and would be an interesting addition to the panoply of such.\n\nAircraft designed in an open thermodynamic system, conventionally aircraft\ndesign employs aerodynamics derived from a closed thermodynamic system\nto which is added a propulsion system. There is no theory per se for a\nsimultaneously optimized Aero, propulsion and structure aircraft design in\nwhat would of necessity be an open thermodynamic system. Historically the\nmilitary has been much more interested in, deployed propulsion assisted\naero, primarily for various flavors of high lift or \xe2\x80\x9cpowered lift.\xe2\x80\x9d The\ndiscussion thus far has mentioned several concepts that take advantage of\nfavorable aero/propulsion interactions, including channel wings with\ncirculation control and wing tip engines. Another concept,that the military\nhas at least experimented with, is thrust vectoring for control in lieu of the\nweight and drag of an empennage. Flow/boundary layer control, primarily\nusing propulsive power in various ways, has historically been applied for\nhigh lift. Supersonic Transport (SST) application of flow control at cruise\nproffers many potential advantages including increased lift generation on the\nupper surface, energy projected far forward for wave drag reduction, flow\nseparation control for enhanced favorable shock interaction (as in parasol\nwings), increased lift carryover onto the fuselage and increased leading edge\nthrust. The commercial world has researched suction laminar flow control\non wings but not thus far on fuselages. The advent of personal view screens\nproffers the possibility of replacing windows with surfaces more conducive to\nlaminar flow. Given the various nose region flow disturbance generators\n(windshields and their wipers, pitot tubes, radomes, the forward door) there\nwould be a need to do suction relaminarization on the fuselage before\nstarting maintenance suction. The recent discovery that a single layer of\ngraphene can greatly inhibit corrosion, along with development of meta\nmaterial and nano surfaces that reduce adherence of bug remains are\nbeneficial to laminar flow control maintenance issues. Additional propulsion/\nairframe/aerodynamics favorable interaction approaches include the ejector\nwing, wing tip injection, utilization of LFC suction as a flow separation control\napproach for takeoff/high lift and several flavors of boundary layer inlets\nincluding the as yet unevaluated in detail \xe2\x80\x9cGoldschmied\xe2\x80\x9d approach which\nasserts cancellation of a portion of the body viscous drag via establishment\nof a high static pressure region on the after body.\n\nAdvanced configuration Aeronautics, There are a large number of\nadvanced-to-different aircraft configurations which appear to proffer various\nflavors of benefits and which probably should be studied further given the\ndiffering metrics going forward, References 18- 75. At this point the one\nthat has received the most study is the blended wing body, including a\nmilitary instantiation, the B-2 bomber. Major benefits of BWBs include huge\nvolumetric efficiency and far less fuselage drag yielding an L/D increase in\nthe 25 percent range. The non-circular pressure vessel issue associated\nwith such requires much further research and invention. Advanced\nconfigurations mentioned thus far include ring wings, strut/truss braced\nwings and channel wings. Others on offer are the R.T. Jones yawed wing\nwhich he claimed could, for the same fuel burn, increase speed by up to\nsome 50 percent without worrisome sonic boom. Then there is the \xe2\x80\x98Sky\nTrain\xe2\x80\x9d mid wing double fuselage concept.\nFor SSTs, the advanced configuration options include unswept thin NLF\nwings, parasol wings for favorable wave interference, multistage aircraft,\nyawed wings and the Pfenninger strut braced extreme arrow wing, the latter\nproffers the order of twice the conventional double delta L/D. All of these\nconfigurations could profit from R&D into the application/ engineering\naspects of the observations of up to 45 percent turbulent skin friction\nreduction from oscillatory transverse wall motions. The challenge is to have\na sizable net benefit.\nThe major potential benefits proffered by advanced configuration aero\nacross the speed range coupled with the dearth of serious efforts to study let\nalone apply such is an indication and indictment of the innate conservatism\nof the aeronautical community. In the ideation of new advanced\nconfigurations it is sometimes useful to list the assumptions made in usual\naircraft design and attempt to open up the design spaces by attempting to\nobviate them. Such assumptions include usually contiguous geometry,\nnearly separate aero and propulsion systems [as opposed to designing in an\nopen thermodynamic system], high lift approach integral to the aircraft vice\non the ground, aerodynamic controls for civilian designs and horizontal\nsymmetry. Some attempts to obviate these usual assumptions include\nmultiple fuselages, external wing strut/truss bracing, span loaders, multi-\n\nstage aircraft, ski jumps for takeoff, thrust vectoring for control, skewed/\nyawed wing and various flavors of variable geometry.\nHigh speed nose bluntness optimization, With the development of serious\nhigh speed mod sim there is now an opportunity to optimize nose bluntness\nfor the multitudinous applicable design metrics including drag, heating,\nboundary layer transition delay, weight, cost and volumetric efficiency. The\ndownstream effects of the typical overexpansion and entropy layers give this\noptimization problem some interesting non-linear aspects. Initial early\nstudies of such nose region optimization for just a few of these issues\nindicated some interesting results.\nSmart Inflatables, There are a plethora of aerospace applications for\ninflatables including sails, antennas, transonic drag reduction for hypersonic\nair breathers, decelerators, light buckets, wings, arrays, concentrators,\nmirrors, lenses, radiators, sunshades, habs and many more. The evolving\nadvanced nano material technologies including IVHM, self healing, imbedded\nsensors/actuators, computing etc. mitigates in favor of serious development\nand optimization efforts given the major potential benefits of inflatables writ\nlarge.\n-EDL, (Entry, Descent and Landing), Landing large payloads/vehicles on\nMars without transporting the necessary fuel to retro-rocket is extremely\ndifficult due to the low atmospheric density. Current approaches for small\npayloads involving parachutes etc. are not suitable beyond a certain payload\nsize. There are several alternative EDL/deceleration approaches that should\nbe studied and triaged that would still save most of the fuel weight required\nto retro rocket. The first of these is regenerative aero braking, this is\nanalogous to automobile regenerative braking. In one variant Martian CO2\nis taken aboard after being heated by the bow shock at entry speeds,\nprocessed through an MHD generator to produce electrical energy which can\nbe stored, possibly in a nano tube skin/structure which is an ultra capacitor,\nand used to heat ingested CO2 at lower speeds which can then be retroed to\nslow the vehicle (Reference 76). It may be possible, TBD, to take CO2 on\nboard at intermediate speeds and utilize the ram pressure recovery and\nstore the thermal energy to retro the CO2 at low(er) speeds to slow down\n\nwithout needing the weight and cost of an MHD generator. Another\nalternative to using CO2 taken on board during entry is to store energy from\nthe solar cells during interplanetary transit and use that to heat the gas for\nretro.\nOther alternative EDL approaches for large payloads into Mars include\nutilizing lifting aerodynamics and maneuvering in the atmosphere, doing\nskips and lateral flight to accrue drag and bleed off speed. Then there is the\npossibility of using multiple deployable deceleration devices suitably\narranged to obtain a multiple shock, much higher, pressure recovery/drag\nlevels. Also, David Kirtley has a concept for EDL termed Plasma\nMagnetoShell Aero Braking that utilizes charge exchange.\n- Reactive Turbulent Drag Reduction in Air, While Laminar Flow Control\ntechnology, developed over many decades of research, can provide major\nskin friction drag reduction in many design spaces, there are many situations\nwhere the flow will be turbulent and approaches to providing turbulent drag\nreduction are required. For air the current SOA is riblet surfaces, small\nlongitudinal grooves which is spite of adding wetted area, reduce turbulent\ndrag overall by some 8 percent or a bit more. There are laboratory and\ncomputational experiments which indicate up to order of 40 percent drag\nreduction via transverse wall motions, but practical systems level\napplications of this approach are not yet extant. An alternative approach is\nto attempt to counter the formation of the \xe2\x80\x9cwall ejections\xe2\x80\x9d known to produce\nmuch of the drag in turbulent wall flows. The MEMS and nano, as well as IT\nadvances over the last decade plus proffer the opportunity to revisit this\nreactive turbulent drag reduction approach. One way forward is to sense the\nmoving adverse pressure gradient that produces the localized near wall\nembedded shear layers that produce wall ejections/bursts and deform the\nwall in an attempt to cancel or mitigate this pressure dynamic. There are\nexperiences with several such reactive approaches and the tech revolutions\nare producing the requisite sensors, actuators and computing to justify a\nrevisit.\n- Kite Wings, Delta wings can produce prodigious tip vortices which can be\nutilized to mix fluids. NASA was involved in a study to mix the waters in\n\nChesapeake Bay to counter summer anoxic conditions using delta wings\nmoored at angle of attack in the current. Going forward there is concern\nregarding increased storm/hurricane activity and formation of anoxic oceans\ndue to changes in the thermal-haline circulations, producing anoxic bacteria\nand resulting in production of hydrogen sulfide which is poisonous and\ndegrades the ozone layer. It may be possible to, at low cost(s), deploy a\nfleet of robotic \xe2\x80\x9ckite wings\xe2\x80\x9d to counter both hurricanes and anoxia to some\ndepth. The concept is simplex. Utilize buoyant lift autonomous kites to pull\nsubmerged delta wings. Hurricane intensity is first order dependent upon\nsurface water temperature which the kite wings, deployed in front of the\nstorm path, should reduce via mixing with cooler waters at some depth.\nSuch mixing also distributes and adds oxygen to the water column to some\ndepth for the anoxic ocean concerns. Whether such near surface\noxygenation would have a material effect upon the hydrogen sulfide issue is\nTBD.\n- Noise Reduction, The key to a viable operate off the street in front of your\nhouse PAV functionality and the associated up to $1T/ year market is\ncontrolling noise. The most straight forward approach to reducing noise is\nthe development of revolutionary energetics, enabling energy rich operation\nwhich allows reduced performance, lower blade loading of lift fans. Electric\npropulsion would obviously reduce direct propulsion/energetics noise sources.\nStudies have indicated that turbulent jet noise can be reduced by injecting\nliquid water which breaks up into droplets which interfere with the\nturbulence dynamics, reducing the strength of the noise sources. For\ninterior noise, anti-noise or noise cancellation has had some success. For\nthe exterior turboprop noise issue boundary layer devices termed \xe2\x80\x9clarge\neddy breakp devices\xe2\x80\x9d are thought to produce a flow configuration that is\nefficacious. Obviously separated flows, which are a notable noise source,\ncan be \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 reduced to eliminated via flow control. Some tens of\nflow control approaches extant, which, what is a systems decision. Then\nthere is frequency shifting and possibly noise shielding opportunities via\ndistributed propulsion. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has developed\nto a point where source strength computations are an advancing capability,\nan increasing alternative to experiments.\n\nSynopsis of Frontier Technologies\nThe following is a listing of the Revolutionary Frontier Technologies which,\nin the aggregate, have the potential to change mightily essentially all\naspects of society, including Aerospace. These technologies are in progress\nnow, and their potential individual, let alone combinatorial, impacts have not\nyet been fully projected and documented.\n- Revolutionary Energetrics \xe2\x80\x93 LENR, halophytes, positrons, energy beaming,\nultra efficiency PV and energy conversion\n- 3 D and 4 D printing on the way to molecular manufacturing\n- Structural Nano Tubes, Potential for Factors of 3 to 5 dry weight reduction\n- Quantum Computing, For an increasing number of problems a huge\nnumber of orders of magnitude faster\n- Atom Optics/Cold Atoms, orders magnitude improved inertial Navigation\n- Biomimmetics human level machine intelligence\n- 5 Senses virtual reality/immersive presence\n- Designer/modified/more robust humans\n- Vector/scaler quantum potential non E-M communications\n- Autonomous robotics\n- Global sensor grid/global mind\n- Synthetic biology for bioproduction and biofunctionalism\n\nExamples of what these technologies and their combinations proffer include\nclimate solutions (also, in the case of halophytes, solutions for land, food\nand water), energy rich aerospace, massive cost reductions in many\nsystems/functionalities, Tele-everything/ the Virtual Age, mod sim vice\nphysical experiments, increasing replacement of humans by robotics,\nincreased tele vice physical travel, less cargo/more at home manufacture,\nhuman space exploration both safe and affordable,\n\nConcluding Remarks\nAerospace has a significant opportunity to reverse a decades long slide into\na conservative posture and mantra by studying and ideating the application\nof the multitudinous current and projected results of the many technology\nrevolutions to the (morphing in real time) aerospace missions and metrics.\nThis applies to both re-examination of old, existing ideas with these new\ntechnologies and opportunities as well as ab-initio ideation of newly enabled\nsolution spaces. The emerging budget realities going forward along with the\nchanging metrics emphasizing simultaneously emissions, acoustics,\nenergetics, safety and cost, along with the potentially massive impacts of\nprinting manufacture, tele-travel, immersive presence and machine\nintelligence/robotics upon both what is needed/the work to be done and how\nit is best done should incite a re-examination of the capability of the usual,\nhistorical products and capabilities to enable a viable, thriving aerospace\nindustry going forward. The present report provides a cross section of such\nreexaminations and opportunities.\n\nReferences\n1. NASA Space Technology Roadmaps, NASA , 2012\n2.
