Although recently, commercial space ventures, such as Space X, have begun to develop enhanced commercial space launch capabilities, and many companies provide space related services - including satellite development and operations, advanced technology development still requires (and should require) participation by the federal agency assigned this role - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, this standard funding model may not be the most efficient and stable means of developing the advanced technology systems. And while the federal government does not need to be involved in areas where private industry can reasonably operate, it should remain the leader in supporting the development of new and advanced space technologies to further increase our national capability. And as these technologies mature, then private industry can begin the commercialization process, freeing up resources and funds for NASA to develop the next generations of advanced space technology. In fact, simply examining the last decades of space technology development shows that there is room for improvement. Part of the problem is that there are realistically two space frontiers. There is the commercialization frontier (the realm of Space X and others) and the exploratory frontier (the realm of NASA.). Often technologies that can support the exploratory frontier can also immediately support the commercialization frontier. Yet, these technologies are still developed under the standard model of federal funding and contracting. Is that really the best way to proceed? In this paper, the argument is put forward that a new process is required, a new paradigm. A consortium of federal agencies as well as commercial companies is needed - in a collaborative rather than a contractual relationship.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140008782, "endDate": "2014-02-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Universities Space Research Association", "location": "Albuquerque, NM, United States"}}, "meetingId": "bb385ff470a84c638393e25d4c4c0ec4", "id": "c244f854ac434b9eb1c253f2d9e084dd"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Nuclear Society", "location": "La Grange Park, IL, United States"}}, "meetingId": "bb385ff470a84c638393e25d4c4c0ec4", "id": "c4f737f0e8a9435392dc4a4aada2f664"}], "name": "Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space (NETS-2014)", "location": "Stennis Space Center, MS", "id": "bb385ff470a84c638393e25d4c4c0ec4", "startDate": "2014-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140008782, "id": "3666bbb01fcd477b9e63c1155612d1f9", "publicationDate": "2014-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140008782.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140008782/downloads/20140008782.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140008782/downloads/20140008782.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140008782/downloads/20140008782.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
