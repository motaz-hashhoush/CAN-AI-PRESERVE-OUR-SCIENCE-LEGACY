b'BUILDING\n\nON THE\n\nFOUNDATION\n\nSUSAN\n\nFOR\n\nAN ENGINEERING\n\nCAREER\n\nWHITE AND RUTH WHITE\nAmes Research\nMoffett\n\nCenter\n\nField, California\n\nSummary\nA predictable and preventable hurdle stops a majority of\nyoung women from entering the scientific and technical\nfields. This cuts down the individual\'s career possibilities,\nand cuts in half the pool of potential U.S. engineers later\navailable to industry. The waste of talent does not\nadvance our country\'s competitive position.\nThe typical American adolescent girl has acquired all the\nbasic mathematical\nskills needed to pursue science and\nmath, but, from adolescence on, she does not build the\nfoundation of science and math courses that she would\nneed later in life to work in engineering.\nSeveral questions are addressed: Why are some young\nwomen stopped cold in their mathematical tracks during\nadolescence?\nWhat is the influence of psychology,\nincluding discussion of the personality traits quantifiably\nshared by women in technical fields? How should the\nschool system adapt to keep their female charges learning\nmath and science?\n\nIntroduction\nSeveral recent studies indicate a disturbing possibility that\nyoung women are typically stopped cold in their mathematical tracks during adolescence. The typical adolescent\n\namong doctoral scientists and engineers, the proportion of\nwomen grew from 8.6 percent in 1973 to 17.3 percent in\n1989. Women represented\napproximately\none-third of the\nPh.D.\'s in psychology\nand the medical sciences, but less\nthan 5 percent of the Ph.D.\'s in engineering.\nWomen are\ngoing on to higher education, increasing both in numbers\nand percentages,\nbut they are apparently avoiding\nengineering.\nOne explosive new study (ref. 4) states bluntly that\nschools are shortchanging\ngirls. Recent studies have\nshown that during adolescence,\ngirls suffer a significant\ndrop in self-esteem, which affects their performance.\nOther studies have shown (ref. 5) that women in technical\nfields share certain personality traits. Are these the same\ntraits that helped these individuals\navoid or survive a drop\nin self-esteem and performance\nexperienced by the\naverage adolescent girl? How can the school system\nchange to keep these students performing\nin math and\nscience during this phase of their lives? Studies suggest\nan emphasis on cooperation\nand problem solving (ref. 6)\nrather than competition\ndoes reduce alienation of these\nstudents. In addition, science and math events tailored to\ngirls (ref. 7) appear to convince them that science\nmath are fundamental\nto many careers.\nPhysical changes\nno more difficult\n\nand\n\naccompanying\nadolescence\nare probably\nfor girls than for boys, because radical\n\ngirl does not build the foundation\nof science and math\ncourses that she will need later in life to work in engineer-\n\nphysical changes take place in all adolescents.\nThere is no\nevidence of a significant\ndifference in overall mental\n\ning. This has the end result of limiting the number of\nyoung women who are later able to work in the scientific\nand technical fields.\n\ncapabilities, although intriguing differences in some components of mathematical\nthought, such as pattern recognition and spatial resolution, have been uncovered. The\n\nBefore adolescence,\nmany different articles (refs. 1 and 2)\nhave discussed studies showing girls competing equally\nwith or out-performing\nboys in the fields of study most\nimportant to the technical professions:\nmathematics\nand\nscience. However, after girls reach adolescence,\ntheir\naverage performance\nand participation\nin these fields\ndrops significantly.\n\nsocietal forces appear to simply be harsher on girls, and to\nbe responsible for the adverse changes in mathematical\nperformance.\n\nThe effect persists to the highest levels of education. The\nNational Research Council (ref. 3) regularly surveys\nPh.D. scientists and engineers in the United States. In\n\nRegardless of the causes, it is important to take steps to\nhelp adolescent girls get past this predictable hurdle in\ntheir lives. It is important to keep girls involved in learning mathematics\nand science to keep their future options\n\ntheir highlights\n\nfrom the 1989 survey,\n\nthey reported\n\nthat\n\nWhy do the majority of adolescent\ngirls appear to lose\ninterest in mathematics?\nWhy are other students unimpeded, as is proved by the growing representation\nof\nwomen in the technical fields?\n\n125\n\n?NF_IIN_\n\nII_A_[ BLA/O( !)K)T FILMFD\n\nopen. After a brief overview of current developmental\ntheory, the results of recent studies are summarized in the\nfollowing sections. Proposed solutions are repeated in the\n\nrole modeling can have a significant impact here, before\nthe child becomes a teenager. The most important relationships center around the school and the neighborhood.\n\nsummary.\n\nAdolescence\nis the next period of life. Because this stage\nis so variable for different people, Erickson provides no\n\nBackground:\n\nPsychological\n\nFramework\n\nA condensed outline of current psychological\ndevelopmental theory is sketched out below to provide a\nframework for discussion of adolescence and\npre-adolescence.\nThe personality is defined by psychiatrists as the sum\ntotal of all an individual\'s experience,\nbecause it is\nbelieved that every event that happens to a person has an\nimpact on their personality (ref. 10). There are three main\nschools of thought on development of the personality:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 heredity\n\nvs. environment\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 mechanistic\n\nvs. organismic\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 critical periods\nThe heredity vs. environment\ntheory refers to the wellknown nature vs. nurture issue. The mechanistic vs.\norganismic theory argues that a person is either like a\nmechanism, rigid and unchangeably responding to events\nin life, or more like an organism, evolving and flexibly\nchanging when necessary. The critical period theory\nasserts that a person is staged to learn and evolve only at\ncertain critical times in life. The critical period theory is\nthe cornerstone of Erickson\'s "eight stages of man"\nmodel, which is almost universally\nthis reason, it is discussed below.\n\naccepted\n\ntoday. For\n\nErickson\'s eight stages of psychosocial\ndevelopment\n(ref. 8) are shown in table 1. Erickson\'s framework for\ndevelopment covers a model for development over the\nindividual\'s entire life. Few age limits are shown in the\ntable, because each person has a different maturation rate.\nPsychiatrists believe that most individuals do not progress\nthrough all stages completely. The stages of life relevant\nto this discussion are latency and adolescence.\nLatency is the period of life from ages 6 to 12 for most\npeople. This is a joyous time for children, as they are\nexpanding their horizons and grasping new concepts.\nTheir attention is easily engaged, and they repeatedly\nexperience a sense of mastery over new skills. In grades\n1 to 7, they learn to read, to write, to solve problems in\nmathematics, to ride a bike, etc. The crisis of latency is\nthe clash between the active industry of learning and the\ndeveloping feeling of inferiority. For the first time they\nare cognitively aware of shortcomings in themselves.\nSelf-doubt, possibly even shame, over one\'s self or family\nnow comes to the forefront of consciousness.\nPositive\n\n126\n\nage delimiters. The central crisis at this stage of life is that\nof ego identity versus role confusion. The ego identity or\nsense of self is strong, and children want to be treated\nmore as individuals. Freedom, independence and the right\nto choose one\'s own friends, clothes, or books become\nimportant to them. This is when children start to question\nauthority, in particular, their parents. They mentally put a\ndistance between themselves and their families, and want\ntheir friends to replace their parents as the center of their\nsocial lives. This is the time when children are "launched"\ninto the world. Role confusion\n\nrefers to the sorting of\n\nsexuality and of where they fit in the world. They already\nknow where they fit in their families. This stage can be\nvery painful for some children. They feel a strong need to\nbe in agreement with their peers, rather than conforming\nto their parents. The leadership models at this stage are\nusually an idealized teacher, a rock star or movie star, or\nthe most popular and attractive child at school. The\nsmartest adolescents never appear to be idealized by their\npeers.\nErickson\'s theory asserts that the social clues and cues are\ndifferent for the two genders as they grow. The media,\nrole models, books, schools, parents and relatives all send\nout subtle, or not so subtle, messages about what is\nexpected of a person.\nChildren\n\nabsorb new information\n\nand messages\n\nconstantly. According to Piaget (ref. 9), it is the job, or\nthe life\'s work, of children to develop the ability to\nmeasure things out, to delay gratification with some\ndegree of stability and internalized control, and to be able\nto understand and conceptualize\ndifferences. Piaget did\nwidely accepted work on how children organize information, how they take in new concepts and information and\ngradually learn to apply it to the environment. They are\nconstantly adjusting their ideas, synthesizing\nnew information and using the new synthesis in new applications.\nPiaget gave an example to illustrate the changes in the\nchild\'s process of thought. Witnessing a one-gallon\ncontainer of water being poured into a tall, narrow, empty\ncontainer, a younger child will insist that the tall container\nholds more fluid, because it is so much taller. An older\nchild understands that the two containers hold the same\namount of fluid, because the child saw that all the water\ncame from the one gallon container.\n\nAdolescence important\nis an\n\ntime in life. According to\nEnglish and Finch (ref. 10), an adolescent has several jobs\nat this stage of life.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to attain emancipation\n\nfrom the parents\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to choose a vocation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to accept their sexual\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to integrate\n\nidentity\n\ntheir personality\n\nand goals\nin the direction\n\nof altruistic\n\ngoals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 for girls: to make the difficult choice between a career,\nhomemaking,\nor only recently, a balance of both career\nand homemaking.\nRegardless of psychiatric theory, most girls do not choose\na vocation at this stage of life. There are two probable\ncauses. First, the marriage-versus-career\nchoice may\nconsume so much of their energy that they are unable to\nfocus beyond that conflict, although many girls try to\ndeny the existence of the conflict entirely. Second, girls\nare not forced or encouraged\nto choose a vocation by the\nadults in their lives, their parents and counselors.\nIn summary, theories\nprovide a framework\nconflicts confronting\n\nNon-traditional\n\nof psychological\ndevelopment\nfor understanding\nthe changes\nthe adolescent girl.\n\nand\n\nwere not as sociable, and they were more radical and\nadventurous. Presumably because they are a minority\nboth among women _nd among professionals,\nthey had\nless ego-strength and were less self-assured.\nLike all\nwomen, women scientists had been trained to be supportive of others, to listen, to stroke. Ashburn remarked that\nthese behaviors were probably incompatible\nwith aggressive professionalism\nand ego-strength.\nIn a typical\nfinding, female and male medical students were equally\nintelligent, effective, aggressive,\netc., but the women\nplaced more importance on relationships,\nwere more\naccepting of feelings, and more alert to moral and ethical\nissues.\nPsychiatrists\nattempting to explain and categorize women\nmaking non-traditional\ncareer choices have produced two\ntheories: the "deviance"\nhypothesis and the "enrichment"\nhypothesis. The "deviance"\nhypothesis asserts that such\nwomen are deviants from traditional middle America, in\nwhat appears to be a tautology.\nThe "enrichment"\nhypothesis asserted that women who chose nontraditional\nwork have been exposed to more alternatives\nand recognize a greater variety of options for women, often by\ncontact with a different culture or a variety of jobs.\nAshburn cited quantitative\nhypothesis.\n\nhome.\nIn her study and overview of the literature on women in\nmale-dominated\nprofessions,\nAshbum (ref. 5) reported\nthat\nwho have entered\n\nthe top\n\nwoman\n\nhave time to "think\n\npink" anymore.\n\nin life to a greater extent.\n\nThe Impact\n\nin a\n\nThis stereotype was not affirmed by statistical analysis of\navailable surveys and personality\ninventories, which\nportrayed a positive image of actual professional\nwomen.\nThe personalities\nof women in non-traditional\noccupations exhibited four main focal points: independence,\nintelligence,\nindependent\n\ndon\'t\n\ntraits and experiences. These traits may have been necessary for these women to survive the school system and\nembark on scientific careers.\n\nAsburn painted a stark picture in the 1977 work. The\nstereotype existed in the popular literature of the professional women as the masculine, dominating,\naggressive,\nless-than-competent\n\nWomen\n\nUp to the 1960s, gender differences\nhad more cultural\nrelevance than today, and they determined\na person\'s role\n\nIn summary, analysis of personality surveys of women\nscientists showed an unusual constellation\nof personality\n\nprofessional\nfields have had to have\nextraordinary\nmotivation,\nthick skins,\nexceptional\nability, and some unusual\npattern of socialization\nin order to reach\ntheir ocoupational\ndestinations.\nIntelligence\nand education are apparently\nnot sufficient\nconditions to predict professional\nachievement."\n\ninsensitive,\nprobably\nman\'s world.\n\nfor the enrichment\n\nThings have changed to a large extent since large numbers of women returned to the work force outside the\n\nWomen?\n\n"those women\n\nevidence\n\nfeelings and ego-strength. They were more\nand inner-directed\nthan the average, they\n\nof the School\n\nFor the AAUW report, Bailey (ref. 4) surveyed a large\nbody of recent statistical studies on the effect of the\nschool system on female students. Bower (ref. 1) and\nBrush (ref. 11) recently summarized this and other related\nwork for a wider audience. One statistical study indicated\nthat girls suffer from a large drop in self-esteem\nthey become teenagers. Girls also expressed less\nin professional careers, less interest in math and\nand less confidence in themselves than did boys.\nstudents with higher self-esteem\nliked science\nmore than the average student in the study.\nThe effect on self-esteem\n\nwas measured\n\nwhen\ninterest\nscience,\nThe\n\nand math\n\nby surveying\n\n2400 girls and 600 boys, aged 9 to 16. One fourth of the\n\n127\n\nstudents were Black or Hispanic. The students were from\n36 schools spread across the United States. The survey\nincluded questions about a student\'s sense of well-being,\nif they liked themselves, etc. The study reported sharp\ndrops in self-esteem as the students began junior high\nschool for both sexes, but that the number of girls who\nwere unhappy with themselves was greater, and the loss\nof self-esteem was worse in girls.\nGirls rarely play with boys after age 5. However, girls and\nboys do compete in the classroom. Scholastics\nis the only\narea that the two groups interact or compete in. Girls and\nboys act and learn in different ways, but coeducational\nschools tailor their instructional\nmethods to the learning\nstyle of boys (ref. 1), emphasizing,\ntion. This has the result of causing\nacademic abilities.\n\nfor example, competigirls to doubt their\n\nCoeducation\nitself appeared to have a detrimental effect\non the girls learning. Gilligan (ref. 6) showed that small\nmixed-sex groups have been shown to have an adverse\neffect on girl\'s learning. Girls who said they did poorly in\nmath and science blamed themselves,\nbut boys who said\nthey were unsuccessful in math and science blamed the\nsubject itself, saying they thought it was useless.\nAshburn (ref. 5) proposed an interesting new perspective\non the value and significance\nof competitive\ndrive, citing\nstudies on the motivations\nof scientists. Almost 40% of\nthe men but only 25% of the women gave the "publish or\nperish" or the competitive atmosphere\nof their institutions\nas a strong motivation, whereas 75% of the women and\nalmost half of the men cited "fascination\nwith the problem" or a preference for research as a reason. Also,\nconsidering recent scandals among scientists, the value of\ncompetitiveness\nmust be questioned. A competitive\nenvironment has been repeatedly shown (ref. 2) to discourage\ngirls, and a cooperative\nenvironment has been shown to\nencourage girls. Gilligan (ref. 6) reported that girls generally learn best and had the greatest self-confidence\nworking in collaboration\nwith other students and teachers,\nrather than in competitive\nsituations. Boys, on the other\nhand, did best on competitive\ntasks or in games with a\nstrict set of rules.\nKimball (ref. 2) summarized\na formidable body of\nacademic literature, relying on statistical analyses of girls\'\nperformance\nin mathematics.\nThe article focused on a\nsignificant, well-documented,\nbut largely ignored\nfinding: that girls receive better grades in math than boys,\nalthough boys do better on standardized\ntest than girls, as\nhas been much publicized.\nSex-correlated\ndifference in mathematics\nperformance\non\nstandardized\ntests appear in grades 8 or 9, and generally\nfavor boys. Older studies or studies reflecting smaller\n\n128\n\nsample sizes reported larger sex-related differences on\nstandardized\ntests than do more recent studies. Metaanalysis indicates that this probably reflects recent\nimprovements\nin girls\' performance\nin mathematics,\ndue\nto reduced stereotyping\nof math as a male domain and\nincreases in the number of math classes girls currently\ntake as opposed to reflecting a change in publication\npolicy allowing studies showing small-magnitude\neffects\nto be published.\nHowever, when mathematics\ngrades are used to analyze\ndifferences in mathematical\nperformance\nbetween girls\nand boys, the opposite trend is observed (ref. 2). Differenees, when measurable, almost always favor girls, and\nthis holds consistently\nacross high school and college\nsamples.\nThis is particularly surprising because\nshown that the classroom environment\n\nmany studies have\nis less favorable to\n\ngirls than to boys. Boys receive more of the teacher\'s\nattention, are more active in class, and receive more\nencouraging\n\nremarks.\n\nTo illustrate, in grade 2, boys had more academic contact\nwith teachers, a difference that has been estimated\namounting to 6 hours of instruction over one year. Studies\nof grades 5 to 9 found few overall differences,\nhowever,\nwhen math and sciences classes were separately studied,\ntrends appeared correlating the students role-related\nexpectancies with their performance.\nOne surprising finding indicated that the students who received the most\nattention in these classes were high-achieving\nboys and\nthe low-achieving\ngirls. In high school classes for older\nstudents, consistent differences in treatment are still\nfound. For example, girls received 84% of the discouraging comments and 30% of the encouraging comments.\nOverall the classroom appeared to be an unfavorable\ndepriving environment (refs. 1 and 2) for girls when\ncompared against boys\' experiences.\n\nand\n\nThis may account for the fact that girls are consistently\nless confident of their math abilities than boys. Mathematics may serve as a red flag to indicate a student\'s confidence level (ref. 2), because students with low confidence\nmay tend to avoid math, where one is likely to make\nhighly visible errors. Highly confident students may prefer math to more subjective verbal subjects, because in\nmath the student is likely to be able to demonstrate,\nto\nobjectively prove, her/his ability by the successful\nsolution of a math problem.\nThat boys take more elective math courses than girls has\nbeen well-documented.\nIn addition, studies have shown\nthat boys have more experience outside the classroom\nrelated to science and math than do girls. However, the\neffect of enriching experiences with mathematics\noutside\n\ntheclassroom\n\nhas not been well studied. One aspect of\nsuch extracurricular experience is toys. One study (ref. 2)\nof a group of girls in accelerated math and science classes\ndocumented\nthat,\n"a commonly remembered experience was\ntrouble convincing\ntheir parents to buy them\ntoys such as Legos. In particular, chemistry\nsets had been much desired with little suc-\n\nany, of experience\nthe classroom.\n\nwith mathematics\n\nif\n\nor science outside\n\nWhy do girls take fewer math classes than boys, given\ntheir higher grades? Kimball suggests that the girls\' lesser\nextracurricular math and science experience, and a presumed rote approach to mathematics undermines their\nconfidence and their motivation for pursuing math\ncourses. Studies suggest that, even when they did very\nwell in their current math classes, girls were more likely\nto believe this resulted from hard work than innate ability,\nso they did not regard this as proof that they would continue to excel in math. Sex-role conflict plays a role as\nwell, in terms of discrimination,\nstereotyping, and downplaying of even a\nmath. In addition,\ndemanding career\nan engineering or\n\nin place, Brush suggests that individual women may in\nfact be even acting in their own better interest to drop out\nof these fields. This work summarized\nan extensive body\nof literature on the chilling effect of the college and the\nwork environment on women\'s careers. The following\n\ncess unless they were only children, the\noldest of several girls, or separated from\ntheir brothers by a large age span."\nSpecific studies are needed to relate the extent of\nextracurricular math experiences to mathematical or\nscientific achievement, to determine the significance,\n\nA great deal of effort has gone into recruiting women into\ntechnical fields, but not to keep women from dropping\nout. Furthermore, iii light of the institutional barriers still\n\ngifted girl\'s achievements in science or\nthe conflict between motherhood and a\nmay reduce a girl\'s interest in pursuing\nscientific career.\n\nKimball recommended that good math grades earned by\ngirls be taken seriously, by parents teachers, counselors,\nand the girls themselves. Grades are an important measure\nof achievement, and it is unclear why grades show an\nopposite trend of girls\' and boys\' abilities from that of\nstandardized tests.\nIt is believed that good grades have not been used to help\ngirls fulfill their potential, due to the low expectations for\nthe girls\' future held by the parents and other significant\nadults. Parents and teachers can he influenced, even by\npopular media reports, to take a girl\'s good grades seriously. This may in turn improve the girl\'s confidence and\nperformance,\nand encourage her to take more math\ncourses.\n\nA recent article by Brush (ref. 11) probes why women are\nstill under-represented\nin the sciences at this time, and\n\nhave been quantitatively\ndemonstrated or are strongly\nsuspected to be effective obstacles to women\'s success in\nscience and engineering: stereotypes of scientists, textbook stereotyping, publicity about older, dubious studies\non women\'s supposed mathematical inferiority, bias in\nthe Scholastic Aptitude Test, financial aid cutbacks, sexist\nand combative attitudes among students and scientists,\nand the glass ceiling. Brush\'s recommendations\nare\nincluded with other recommendations\nin the summary.\nThe current laws, books, and newspaper want ads, have\neither fundamentally or superficially reduced sexual\nstereotyping. On toys and in commercials,\nthe "doers"\nstill tend to be boys, with the girls depicted as "helpers".\nThis is progress from the "helpless" image portrayed\nbefore the 1960s. In the 1978 edition of a well-known\nphysics text, the earlier illustrations, all featuring males,\nwere replaced with new illustrations, which could be\nconstrued as either male or female.\nThe large body of data on cognitive\n\nsex differences\n\nhas\n\nbeen publicized and has a strong impact on popular\nthought, but objective examination shows dubious claims\nhave been made. Brush shows that no significance can be\nattached, for example, to the differences in spatial perception abilities favoring boys for two main reasons: the\neffect is small, e.g., one-half of one standard deviation,\nand the effect is inconsistent with spatial ability measurements in cultures where this ability has some actual\nrelevance in everyday life. In addition, recent studies have\nshown girls outperforming boys on a different component\nof mathematical thought, that of pattern recognition.\nBrush suggests publicizing the recent studies, to defuse\nthe popular belief that it has been somehow\nproven that girls are "inferior" in math.\n\nscientifically\n\nOn the effects of the tenure and similar promotion\nsystems, Brush points out that it is counterproductive\nto\ndiscourage women from entering science for fear of a\ntemporary drop in productivity due to time spent caring\nfor young children, and it is also counterproductive\nto\ndiscourage highly intelligent citizens who are scientists\nand engineers from having children.\n\nproves that the early school and social environments are\nnot solely responsible for the shortage of women in\nengineering and science. The obstacles of the college and\nwork environment may even override earlier effects.\n\n129\n\nSummary\n\n4.\n\nBailey, Susan McGee: How Schools Shortchange\nGirls.
