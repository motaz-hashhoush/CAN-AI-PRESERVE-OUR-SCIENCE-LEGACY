By combining the use of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites with existing terrestrial communications systems and innovative, highly efficient spread spectrum techniques, the Globalstar system provides users with low-cost, reliable communications throughout the world. The Globalstar space segment consists of a constellation of 48 LEO satellites in circular orbits with 750 NM (1389 km) altitude. Each satellite communicates with the mobile users via the satellite-user links and with gateway stations. The gateway stations handle the interface between the Globalstar network and the OSTN/PLMN systems. Globalstar transceivers are similar to currently proposed digital cellular telephones in size and have a serial number that will allow the end user to make and receive calls from or to that device anywhere in the world. The Globalstar system is designed to operate as a complement to existing local, long-distance, public, private and specialized telecommunications networks. Service is primarily designed to serve the rural and thin route communications needs of consumers, government users, and private networks.", "title": "The Globalstar mobile satellite system for worldwide personal communications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940018313, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wiedeman, Robert A."}, "organization": {"name": "Loral Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d0583fe0a9014d3584c50696fe1d35b2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940018313, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Viterbi, Andrew J."}, "organization": {"name": "Qualcomm, Inc.", "location": "San Diego, CA., United States"}}, "id": "762f06723fd54ef485e5559ffff8227c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940018313, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940018313, "id": "86641ef0b9664e6e904f5e005d0b3055", "publicationName": "JPL, Proceedings of the Third International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1993)", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940017957, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "MSATT Workshop on Innovative Instrumentation for the In Situ Study of Atmosphere-Surface Interactions on Mars", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940018313.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940018313/downloads/19940018313.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940018313/downloads/19940018313.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940018313/downloads/19940018313.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
