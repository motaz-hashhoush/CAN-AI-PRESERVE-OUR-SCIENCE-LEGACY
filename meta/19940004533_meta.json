There were no restrictions on the types of propulsion or power systems used. The duration of the mission was not defined, but a factor influencing the length of the mission was the statement that it would be cyclic in nature and the spacecraft could be manned or unmanned. The only assumptions provided were that a pumping and refueling station existed on Phobos and that a base existed on the Moon. The technology used for this mission was to be of the year 2007 and beyond.", "title": "Mission: PHH2O", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adams, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "44fff2900cf44a5e8b15113bfc0b200f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bays, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "4b2d3bd2fc4e43d29f42b2a7cb813805"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kronschnabl, G."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "99ab400090da44d3b4844f65fdde3971"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mccutchon, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "afa535865bee45ad99670ebce3053881"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Minier, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "1af82b7abf8f4dd2a79a7d35da799391"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19940004533, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rush, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Texas A&M Univ.", "location": "College Station, TX, United States"}}, "id": "bbf49885dbe444bd9e2781ad988e415f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2017-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940004533, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940004533, "id": "bb19e1b21b2d4a089c1b98597e0c0300", "publicationName": "USRA, NASA(USRA University Advanced Design Program Fifth Annual Summer Conference", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940033285, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Workshop on Scaling Effects in Composite Materials and Structures", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940004512, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA/USRA University Advanced Design Program Fifth Annual Summer Conference", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
