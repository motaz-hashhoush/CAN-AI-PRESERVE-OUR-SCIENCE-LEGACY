This is done in two phases. First, mobile data services was introduced. Hub equipment and 3000 mobile data terminals were supplied. Over the satellite tests were performed. The mobile data service provides full two way digital messaging automatic vehicle location and fleet management services. The second phase is to construct, launch and make operational the MSAT satellite and associated network control facilities. The implementation is examined of the mobile data service in Canada, including the technical description. Marketing and applications are also examined.", "title": "Satellite mobile data service for Canada", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920014953, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Egan, Glenn R."}, "organization": {"name": "Telesat Mobile", "location": "Inc., Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "779ef4b3bf2442d098a48d15c3a714db"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920014953, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sward, David J."}, "organization": {"name": "Telesat Mobile", "location": "Inc., Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "0f2c245ee8864c5382b4a9f02767ff9c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920014953, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920014953, "id": "8c8e15d2f71c4648a57aaf4a3b3fa3a3", "publicationName": "JPL, California Inst. of Tech., Proceedings of the 2nd International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1990)", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920014953.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920014953/downloads/19920014953.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920014953/downloads/19920014953.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920014953/downloads/19920014953.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
