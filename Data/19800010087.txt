The piston includes a seal formed of a sheet of\ncompressed carbon material which extends between the\nbody of the piston and the walls of the cylinder, to form\na substantially gas-tight fit that keeps in gases produced\nat elevated temperatures of a coal sample. The end\nwalls of the cylinder and piston are tapered into a conical shape, and the sample is formed with conical surfaces to mate therewith, to provide a smooth outflow of\nmaterial and high heat transfer to the sample from the\ncylinder and piston walls.\n10 Claims, 4 Drawing Figures\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nJan. 29, 1980\n\n4,185,493\n\nFIG.I\n88-\n\n\\\\XX\\\\V-.V.
