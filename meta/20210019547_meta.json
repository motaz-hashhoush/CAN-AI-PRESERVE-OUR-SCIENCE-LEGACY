NASA ARC is partnering with NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to provide a comprehensive sensor suite, including a DLR-provided Data Acquisition System (DAS). DrEAM will provide key aerothermodynamic data and performance analysis for Dragonfly\u2019s forebody and backshell Thermal Protection System (TPS).\nTitan\u2019s atmosphere predominantly consists of ni-trogen (~98% by mole) with small amounts of me-thane (~2% by mole) and other trace gases. CN is a strong radiator, and is found in nonequilibrium con-centrations for Titan entry. The accurate modeling of nonequilibrium CN radiation has proven to be a diffi-cult task. Prompted by the Huygens mission, many experimental campaigns and analyses were performed to better understand the aerothermal environments experienced by the probe during Titan entry [1]. How-ever, the Huygens probe carried no heatshield instru-mentation. Therefore, the DrEAM sensor suite will sig-nificantly advance the state-of-the-art not only by documenting the environment and performance of Dragonfly\u2019s entry system but also by making key in situ measurements in Titan\u2019s atmosphere for the first time.\nAerothermal environments and TPS response will be measured using sensors whose flight heritage is tak-en from the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing In-strumentation 2 (MEDLI2) thermocouple plugs and the COMbined Aerothermal and Radiometer Sensor (COMARS) suite [2], with the latter supplied by DLR. The MEDLI2 project used embedded thermocouples to directly measure the in-depth TPS temperature-time history at several locations on the heat shield and backshell of the Mars 2020 entry vehicle. These tem-perature measurements, in turn, can be used to infer surface environments via an inverse analysis proce-dure analogous to that used for MEDLI. For DrEAM, the thermocouple plug subsystem will be known as Dragonfly Sensors for Aero-Thermal Reconstruction (DragSTR). On Schiaparelli, the COMARS suite in-cluded three total surface-mounted heat flux sensors, three pressure sensors, and one radiometer. For DrEAM, the COMARS package will be known as the COmbined Sensor System for Titan Atmosphere (COSSTA). Since the methane concentration in the Titan atmos-phere is directly proportional to the radiative heat flux, the COSSTA measurements will be used to reduce the current uncertainty in the methane volume fraction. Atmospheric density measurements and capsule aero-dynamic data will be obtained through the onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), supplemented by pressure transducers similar to those used by the MEDLI and MEDLI2 projects. The DrEAM pressure sensors will be known as the Dragonfly Atmospheric Flight Transducers. (DrAFT). The pressure measure-ments, when combined with data from the on-board IMU, will allow for reconstruction of such quantities as vehicle Mach number, freestream density, and atmos-pheric winds. DrAFT measurements will enhance Dragonfly trajectory reconstruction and enable a sepa-ration of the aerodynamics from the atmosphere, as was done for MEDLI [3] and is currently in process for the MEDLI2 flight data set.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210019547, "endDate": "2021-09-01T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "caba028024835183ac5ceb068aa86384", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Institute", "location": "Houston, Texas, United States"}}, "meetingId": "baf4c69c6f6945168e4136a53d7e152b", "id": "3cdb9123571f43e892f7fc635804f0cb"}], "name": "2021 Fall Meeting of Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG)", "location": "Virtual", "id": "baf4c69c6f6945168e4136a53d7e152b", "url": "https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/upcoming/", "startDate": "2021-08-30T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210019547, "publisher": "Lunar Planetary Institute", "id": "d17046eb7a3d4133ac43ddc1f878026b", "publicationName": "2021 Fall Meeting of OPAG website", "publicationDate": "2021-08-09T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "DrEAM Abstract OPAG_20210730_final.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210019547/downloads/DrEAM%20Abstract%20OPAG_20210730_final.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210019547/downloads/DrEAM%20Abstract%20OPAG_20210730_final.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210019547/downloads/DrEAM%20Abstract%20OPAG_20210730_final.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
