The best use of transportation way-points, the integration of launch vehicles with spacecraft of various configurations, and the incorporation of such advanced concepts as solar sail propulsion, are additional considerations to be studied. The planning of lunar and Martian missions must always take into account the extent to which local resources can diminish earth-supplied logistics requirements.", "title": "Looking at the architecture", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890046549, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bekey, Ivan"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Office of Exploration", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "577d0f483c8a4b7e9e4586304579a2a2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890046549, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19890046549, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "f1d8fac074d74ca3b75ba819e101b3f6", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
