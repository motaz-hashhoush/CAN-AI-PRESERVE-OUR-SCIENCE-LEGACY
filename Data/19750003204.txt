b'DhlA PRECISE: TIME AND TIME INTERVAL REQUIREMEN\'I3\n\nR. H. Carnahan\nDefense Mapping Agency\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Defense Mapping Agency, a s well a s i t s predecessors, has been a user of time\nfor a number of years a s part of the geodetic astronomy a d satellite geodesy\nprograms.\nJohn Harrison\'s clock opened the door to the field use of time required \'n the\ndetermination of astronomic longitude. While current astronomic observing\nm e t h d s employ the same &sic principles that were utilized 200 years ago, instrumentation u s d in the determination of astronomic positions has been greatly\nimproved and epoch times a r e printed out rather than read from,a clock face\no r interpolated from recorded clock ticks. The accuracy ,md p?rticularly the\nstability of portable timing equipment us& in the field for astrononlic positioning has been greatly improved during the last 10 years.\nPositioning by satellites using portable Geoceiver equipment has facilitated the\nrapid determination of geodetic positions on a uniform world system and has replaced positioning by astronomic methods in remote areas of the world. The\nhigh velocity of satellites being used for precise positioning has led to the requirement for more accurate time. Clock epochs to about 50 microseconds a r e\nnow routine a t satellite tracking stations with the goal being a t least 10 microseconds. Although these accuracies a r e still l e s s precise than the state of the\nart, they must be met with operational equipment and frequently under unusual\nfield conditions. Crystal oscillators in the Geoccivers a r e stable in frequency\nto 8 parts in 10" (short term) and 5 parts in 10"\' (long term), and a r e among\nthe better crystal standards.\nAnother geodetic system, the Very Long Base-Line Interferometer (VLBI) requires the synchronization of clocks at two o r more observing stations to extremely high accuracy. The accuracy of the system depends largely on the accuracy of the synchronization. The use of Rubidium sLqndards to replace the\ncrystal standards will be tested in the near future a t fixed satellite tracking stations for the purpose of improving satellite orbits. New satellite systems, such\na s those proposed in the Defense Positioning Program ( D P P ) will be able to use\nmore precise timing for providing observational data required for the accomplishment of geodetic missions, Defense Mapping Agency timing requirements\nm g e from milliseconds to tenths of nanoseconds. These requirements will be\ndiscussed in detail.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Defense Mapping Agency was eetablished in July 1972 by the Secretary of\nDefense. We a r e charged with providing the Unified and Specified Commands\nand Services with maps, charts, precise positions, gravity field data and other\ngeodetic products. While DMA i s a new agency, it i s made up of e!ements of the\nformer Army Topographic Command, the Naval Oceanographic Office and the\nA i r Force Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, which have existed for\nsome time. These a r e now known a s our Topographic, Hydrographic and Aerospace Centers. Our small Headquarters is located on the Naval Observatory\ngrds.\nOne of man\'s earliest requirements for precise time was for navigation and positioning. The addition of the astronomical section of the Depot of Charts and Instrummts in 1837 was a step in the direction of more precise time for greater\naccuracy for nagivation and charting. Although the U.S. Naval Observatory and\nthe U. S. Hydrographic Office became separate entities in 1866, when the Depot\nof Charts and Instruments was reorganized, the need for time has made us more\nand more dependent upon the Naval Observatory throughout the years. This depedence shows up mainly in two areas of our work; time required for geodetic\nastronomy, and time required for satellite tracking.\nGEODETIC ASTRONOMY\nSince there is a direct relationship between longitude and time, determination\nof the local time at a specific point with respect to the time at the meridian of\nGreenwich will establish the longitude of the point. Present day time signals\nwhich are broadcast by several major observatories throughout the world have\nbeen synchronized and provide an excellent means of obtaining time with r e f e r\nence to the meridian of Greenwich. Time a t the measurement point i s determined\nby observing the meridian transit of stars using optical instrumen& and precisetiming equipment.\nThe UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) time signal used to compute longitude\nmust be corrected to UT1 (Universal Time Corrected For Polar Motion); in other\nwords, the UT1-UTC corrections must be applied. This means that the local\nsidereal time of the observatory monitoring the radio signal which is received\nat the field station has been referenced to the identical pole or axis of rotation\nas the field station.\nUTO (Uncorrected Universal Time) a s determined by stellar observations includes\nerrors in the apparent positions of the stars observed, unknown refraction effects,\nobservational errors, and a systematic error causrd by the conventional longiMe\n\nof the observatory not being exact, relative to the prime meridian. One millisecond of time represents approximately one half meter on the ground at the\nequator. Through the Bureau of International de LIIIeure (BIH), the conventional\nlongitudes of the time service stations a r e revised to minimize the errors introduced by inconsistent longitudes.\nAs a result of the longitude adjustments and the previous synchronization of the\ntime services with the atomic frequency standards, conventional (high frequency)\ntime signals and corrections thereof are based on the coordinated and synchronized system UTC (UT Coordinated). Published corrections a r e now available\n30-60 days after the fact. It would, of course, be desirable to have these corrections available sooner, say, about 15 days. (Since the presentation we h a v ~\nbeen advised that the corrections are available in the desired time).\n\na\nUntil comparatively recent times, time for field astronomy w s maintaind with\na mechanical chronometer which was compared about once an hour with a radio\ntime signal. These comparisons were recorded in increments of two seconds\non a chronograph along with the star transits over the observer\'s meridian and\nsubsequently manually scaled (interpolated) and meaned. As the mechanical\nchronometers were replaced with crystal clocks, the times between radio clock\ncomparisons were allowed to become less frequent. Finally, the increased accuracy, due to use of temperature controlled ovens, permitted longer periods\nbetween time comparisons.\nPaper or magnetic tape recorders allowing direct input of star transit. times into\na computer have been considered for some time. This would eliminate the most\ntime consuming (and I might add, the most monotonous) job in the determination\nof longitude; that is, the scaling of the time ticks from strip o r oscillograph\nchrrrts. As you know, field astronomic equipment must be portable. Very few\nsites, probabIy less than fifty percent, a r e " d r i ~ e stations. Most stations\nto"\na r e lccated on hill tops or in remote areas not accessible by road. The "backpa.cklngl\' of generators or heavy batteries except for short distances i s an\nextremely difficult task. We are still looking for a lightweight digital recorder\nsystem whic3 can be used for direct entry into a computer.\nRecently, DMA acquired several time position printer systems, Model SP-300,\nmanufactured by Datametrics, a subsidiary of ITE Imperial Corporation of\nWilmington, Massachusetts. One of these is shown with a Wild T-4 optical the0 dolite (Fig. 1). This system can be powered by disposable dry cell batteries.\nA sample of the "grocery tapew output of the system shows FK-4 star number,\nday of year, hours, minutes and seconds of observation (Fig. 2). About 60\nastronomic stations have been observed to date with excellent results using this\nequipment.\n\n3 5 1 3 2 1 2 !>+\n3613 212 36\n3513\n3413\n3.616\n\n212\n212\n\n212\n\n06\n36\nj E\n36\n\n35\n\n25\n\n35 13 2 1 2\nf e l C 2 1 2 3 6 2.\n\'\n3.512 2 1 2 C b 2 5\n3 5 I S 2 1 2 3 6 2.7\n3510\n3610\n3513\n3Ct3\n\njcr;\n3513\n5513\n\n30ij\n3519\n35.2\n3 5 13\n\n212\n\n2 1 2 06 34\n212\n\n2;:\n212\n212\n212\n2!2\n212\n\n212\n212\n351.3 2 1 2\n3433 2 1 2\n112\n361:\n3613 212\n3413 2 1 2\n3612 212\n\n3t13\n\n23\n\n;6\n9 5\n\n2s\n\n36 ? 5\n36\n\n36\nOj\n\n25\n2\'i\n\n06\n\n25\n\n37 .7?9\n3 3 -131\n\n2\n\n3 4 .%3?\n35 0\n3\n\'\n1\n5 2 .?5$\n\n33\n21\n\na???\n\n27\n\n.&?7\n\nOr; 2 5\n2C\n25\nS6\nG6\n36\nOA\n36\n\n25\n25\n23\n\n25\n2\'7\n25\n\n29\n2s\n\na%??\n\n9 5 0296\n\n2 6 .321\n\nt\n:\n\n2-21\n\n-\n\n.21?r\'\n\n0252\n\nI? . ? 1 5 c P\nl ( r .?I?\n1 5 .I",\n! ? .?33\n12 -553\nIS - \' 3 "\n2 9 .CC?\nC? ,576\n25 -271\n34 d 5 "\n\n31\n\n5.9 . $ 7 5\n3 5 . 1? 5 S .47:\n2!. s c . .PC,?\n2;\nc\n5 ; F\': . 4 5 ?\n\n2 1 2 i7f\n\n561,? 2 1 2\n36:s 2 1 2\n1\n2\n3633\n\ni r a\n:\n.\n4?.7!?\n.;I . ? ? 7\n\n25\n25\n25\n19\n23\n24\n\n.:<\n\n*;.\n\n0 6 ~ 00\n25-&\nFigure 2\n\nC\n\nI\n\n.?c\'\n\nA major advantage of combining the DoD mapping, charting d geodesy firactiom\nunder me single organization i that a larger base f available for the ju8tificas\ns\ntion and development of new instnunentation. In an effort to reduce & possibi\'\nlity of error and to reduce the coet of astranomic poeitianing, an automated urtrowmic positioning system is being dweloped for DMA by the Coatrol Data\nCorporrtioa.\nElectromagnetic distance meunving equipment used for trilatemtioa o r h v e r sing measurer, the time required for a signal to make the rorrnd trip over the\ndistance being measured, While the accuracy of ~ ~ m e nare limited by\nt s\nour knowledge of the speed of light, it is not the dominant error in these\nmeasurements.\n\nSATELLITE GEODESY\nDMA requires more precise time measurements for its satellite tracking programs. Satellites a r e tracked to determine 2n ephemeris which is used for positiand in s t d i e s to i m p m e our model of the earth\'s gravity field. Among\nother p u m e s , the model of tbe gravity field can be used t provide improved\no\nephemerides. This bootstrap operation has been used primarily by the U. S.\nNavy, from whom the program was inherited, since 1960 and has resulted in\nthe present gravity field model which includes harmonic terms thm** the twentieth order and degree, about 400 terms in all.\n\nIn addition to the Navy navigation satellites, other satellites, such a s those\nlaunched by NASA, a r e used for gravity field improvements. The Timation III\nsatellite, due to be launched next spring, will also be used. The CEOS-C satellite, scheduled to be launched next summer, will have an altimeter aboard which\npromises to provide deflections of the vertical over ocean areas and also an indication of the variation of the geoid. Other techniques, such a s satellite-tosatellite tracking, a r e being examined to determine the least expensive system\nfor improving the gravity field model and thus the shape of the geoid.\nThe DMA TRANET tracking network is managed by our Topographic Center and\nconsists of 15 semi-permanent stations deployed worldwide and six stations\navailable for mobile deployment. l\'hese ground stations track doppler satellites\nby recording the time of day when a preset number of doppler cycles have been\nreceived since the last data point. The measurements a r e dependent on a local\nclock synchronized with UTC from t i e Naval Observatory. The master tracking\nand control station at the AT-lied Physics Laboratory of The Johns Hopkins\nUniversity is equipped with a cesium clock, which i s tied to the Observatory by\nVLF, Loran, TV and portable clock transfers. When tracking the Navy navigation satellites, containing clocks maintainc close to UTC, the time to receipt\n\nof the satellite\'s timing marks provides a means of =librating the satellite clock\nagainst the Observatory\'s clock, The time signals from the same satellite,\nwhen received a t the other stations, pmvide a meaes a# calibrating the clocks\na t tboee statloem, Redudaacp is pnwided by trackiw VLF time signals. A t\nthe present time, epoch is maintained a t the tracking statiaas to an a m c y o\nf\na\n50 m\nc\n.i\nAt tbe altitude of the NAVSATS, satellites move a t the\nrate of seven meters per millisecood. The 50 microseeoads. therefore, equates\nto 35 centimeters of satellite motSon. Althis is well witbin the current\nobservatiaml accuracy, impmements are desired which will require timing\naccumcies a about 10 microerecoads. Rubidium osciLlators have k e n ordered\nf\nfor six o tbe semi-permanent stations, as a first step in achieving increased\nf\ntiming accuracy. O&erchanges are being considered at the same time to impnwe the cnrerall abser\'zatioaal accuracy, Tbese inclPde modification of a\ndigitizatiaa technique, s M y d the third order ionospheric correction, and impraviag Me phase lock loop. Quartz cqwtai uscillators are currently be* used\nat the statioas to drive the clocks a s well as to measure the doppler shift. These\noscillators have r stability of about are part in 10\'\' per day and sligatly better\nihan that wer the period of a satellite pass.\nAs with astronomic observations, satellite observations must be corrected for\nthe latitude sB\'i dt.e to the motion of the pole. A satellite making a d - or 80\no\nrevolutions about the earth each day becomes a powerful tool for determing the\nposition of the pole. The Naval Weapons Laboratory, Dthlgrea, Virginia, reduces the data collected at tbo TRAhET stations every dher day to generate an\nephemeris. These epkmerides can only be accurate if the polar motion is taken\ninto accourt. bowing the positiocs of the tracking h t i o n s , the position o the\nf\npole becomes a bias in the adjustment of the data, and must be applied a s a correctioa. Comparison of the N W L polar m t o values with the BIH and the IPMS\noin\n(Intematiaoal Polar Motioa Service) values shows as good agreement as between\nthe B M and the IPMS values themselves.\nAlthough we a r e supplyiag the polar motion coordinates derived from doppler data\nto the Naval Obsematory. the c o r r a a r s applied to astronomic positions are\n\nderived by the BIH. Most astronomers a r e n t ready to replace the traditional\no\nstar observations with corrections derived from satellite data.\n\nsatellite is also accomplished by wing a geoceiver (Fig. 3) with\nPositioaing\nthe antenna unit located wer the mark to be positioned. The geoceiver (Reodetic\nreceiver) is a miniaturized dqrpler tracking station weighing only about 45 kilograms. Designed hy the Applied Physics Laboratory and Magnavox, geoceivera\na r e operated by DMA Centers, a s well a s NAVOCEANO and others. The geoceiver clock is driven by a quartz crystal oscillator similar to the ones used a t\nlarger tracking stations, The clock i s started from aud synchronized with the\nNAVSAT time signals. The frequency of the oscillator and the clock drift can be\n\ndefermined om site by hrmd calcplriaas or ur a part ofthedata reduction program.

UilLLIAads:\nYes.\n\nThat i s andher name, yes. It i s very h a d Q l i e 2 up with the bureaucratic\naame changes. I must admit.\n\nDR. KLEPCZYNSI:\nI believe "GPS* stands for "Glob1 Positioairrg System. "\n\nMR. WILLIAMS:\nRight.\n(Editor\'s Comment: Later during the week of the meetillg. the System m a s\nrenamed "NA V STAR". )\nDR. KLEPCZYNWI:\nA r e there any other questions ?\n\n(No response. )\n\nDR. KLEPCZYSKI:\nU\'ell, thank you very much. Maybe we can get a discussion going here for a\nfew minutes with some audience participation.\nBefore the meeting started - e weretalking about wrttiag requirements for\nw\nPTTI system. This seems to be a very difficult thing to do. People require,\no r they say they need accurate time. Some people talk about accuracies of ten\nnanoseconds\n\n.\n\nApparently it bemmt-s very hard to justify requirements in terms, which upper\nmanagement finds easy to accept.\nNow, I am wondering if anybody in the audience might be able to contribute\nsome type of discussion a s to some hard and proven techniques for justifying\nextreme accuracies in certain time systems ?\nEverybody knows all systems work better with more exact time, but it is\ndifficult to formulate that in words which a r e easily understood, o r can be\nproven. It sometimes gets to be a very difficult thing, and I don\'t know if anybody here has had experience with this.\nYes, Dr. Winkler.\n\nDR. WINKLER:\nWell, my experience is rather broad and general; there seems to be a subtheorem of the more general one that the more expensive a system is, thc\neasier it would be approved. The subtheorem offered is: The fancier the clock,\nthe better will be the system.\n\no\nBut I think, t be more on the serious side, in specifying requirements, and in\njustibing requirements, you have really two problems.\nThe first one is the acceptance of a common terminology; how do you specify a\nfrequency, how do you spec~fy\ntime. o r frequency and phase variations. In most\nspecifications which you see there i s a tremendous confusion. People like to\ntalk in parts to the 10 to the something, when in fact they mean phase noise, and\nvice versa. We will later on have occasion to refer to some papers, some\nfundamental literature which exists regarding terminology, most notably, the\nIEEE Subcommittee work on Frequency Stability and its publication on characterization of frequency stability by Barns et al. I think this paper is one which\nmay lead the way to a uniform specification of frequency stability.\n\nUniform specification language in time should be simpler. You simply state\nwhat your phase noise expressed in time i s going to be.\nBut turning now to the second part of my concern, the credibility aspect, and\nto the justification which ~ o u l d given in a language easily understood by the\nbe\nmany levels of review and approval, I think you have again basically two aspects.\nOm nanosecond propagation time of light corresponds to one foot; it i s an\nextremely short interval of time. I will caution systems designers and systems\nproponents, to be very, very careful not to overstate the actual requirements,\nbecausc it will be very expensive to implement timing systems with nanosecond\ntime requirements.\nIn the discussion of a system, anyone, who talks about nanosaconds and so on,\nshould better first study the various disturbances in the atmosphere, the various\ndisturbances in signal propagation, through the electronic systems, etc., before\nspecifications of requirements for clocks a r e firmed up.\nyou follow that common engineering syndrome of overspecifying, and of\ndoing things more complicated than may actually be necessary, then you have\nalready embarked on a path which leads to disaster, and you will end up with the\ntypical problems of production, maintenance and cost. I remind you what an\nelephant is; an elephant i s a "military specification" designed mouse.\n\n3nce\n\nAnd one should not use cesium clocks o r hydrogen masers in a backpack unless\nabsolutely required (if one can\'t get a time signal in time!).\n\n(Applause, )\n\nDR. KLEPCZYNSKI:\nDo you have a comment over here?\n\nMR. LIEBERMAN:\nI think to tcirn the question around, rather than requirements, a s Captain Fowler\npointed out, perhaps we should look a t what i s available in precise time on\nexisting systems, and try to make maximum use of what i s available a t\ncomparatively reasonable costs.\n\nWe now have 1 microsecond around the world a t the SATCOM stations. VLF, i t\nwas pointed out, could be used down to 10 microseconds and approximately\n1 microsecond is available on some Loran C systems.\n\nTry to build systems based upon this availability.\n\nDR. KLEPCZYNSKI:\nVery good. These are very interesting comments.\nAre there any more ?\n\n'
