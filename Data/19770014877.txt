The apparent enhancement\nof dry heat lethality by vacuum conditions may provide an improved spacecraft\nde contamination/ sterilization process.\n\nThis revised process could be more\n\ncompatible with spacecraft hardware, increase spacecraft reliability and possibly\nincrease the probability of achieving a specified level of sterility.\nAnother element of these studies stems from the information obtained\nfrom tests performed at JPL and reported in an earlier JPL Semi-Annual Review\n(Ref. 3).\n\nAs a result of these tests it has been theorized that an organism\'s\n\nability to withstand a given substrate temperature depends on the chamber\nmaterial and color (infrared reflectivity) and chamber wall temperature as well.\nThis warranted the fabrication of a new test fixture (Figure 5-B. 1).\n\nThe new\n\ntest fixture consists of a closely-controlled substrate temperature and a\n"chamber wall" with independent temperature control.\nlends itself to good thermal flux analysis.\n\nIts geometric design\n\nThe fixture can be used in existing\n\nj\n\nvacuum chambers to produce the required test conditions regardless of the\nchamber wall temperature or surface color.\n\nAuxiliary heat exchangers utilizing\n\nheated or cooled gases may be employed with the new fixture configuration to\naugment electrical resistance heaters and permit reduction of the time to reach\nsubstrate test temperature and return to ambient.\n\nThe reduction of this ramp\n\ntime represents a significant reduction in a source of experimental error,\nespecially for short exposures.\n\nThe primary objectives of this task are to\n\nclarify and define the effects of chamber wall temperature, infrared reflectivity\nand other parameters on the sterilization efficiency of dry heat applied concurrently with vacuum or atmospheric pressure as well as to develop a better understanding of the vacuum/heat synergism which decreases the heat resistance of\nspores.\n\n..\n\nt\n\nt\n\n/\n\nj\n\n5-10\n\n__\n_ ~____~____________________________..;J\n\'1_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n900-762\n\nFib \' 5-B . 1.\n\nVacuUIll/heat test fixture\n5-11\n\n"\n\n1\n\n900-762\n\n5.2.2\n\nApproach\nA two-phased approach was taken in order to better present the varying\n\n.\n\n,\n\ntest conditions and also to permit presentation of the data in a more clear and\nconcise manner.\n5.2.2.1\n\nPhase 1.\n\nPhase I constitutes the work performed on Bacillus sub-\n\n~ var. niger (BSN) spores.\n\n0\n\nThe substrate temperature was 80 C with the\n0 0 0 0 0\n\ncryo-plate temperature at -185 C, -35 C, 23 C, 80 C and 100 C.\n\nBoth the\n\nreflective (shiny) and non-reflective (black) sides of the cryo-plate were used.\nExposure duration for the various test conditions were 2, 16, 24, 48 hrs under\na vacuum of 10\n\n-5 torr.\n\nSeveral tests were conducted utilizing the heat source\n\nin the shroud of the vacuum chamber.\n\nIn these tests all three elements (sub-\n\nj\n\nstrate, cryo-plate and shroud) were heated; when the desired temperature was\nreached the substrate and cryo-plate heat source was cut off and the temperature was maintained by the shroud only.\n\nTests were conducted with the shroud\n\n\'I\n\nat BOoC and 100oC.\n\n,\n\nTable 5-B. 1 shows the cumulative results of all the various parameters\nstudied under vacuum.\n\nI\n\nThe effect On the survival of B. subtilis spores when\n\nutilizing the shroud as the heat source as opposed to heating the substrate and\ncryo-plate directly is shown on Fig. 5-B.2.\nThe effect of wall temperature on the survival of B. subtilis spores\n0\n\nis shown in Fig. 5-B.3. The substrate was maintained at 80 C at a pressure\n-5\nof 10\ntorr. The cryo-plate had its shiny side facing the substrate.\nThe effect of chamber wall reflectivity at a substrate temperature of\n-5\n80 C and a pressure of 10\ntorr, on the survival of B. subtilis spores, is\no\n\nshown in Fig. 5 - r,. 4.\nThe present studies shows none of the previously observed effects of\nchamber wall infrared reflectivity and temperature, on the thermal death of\no\nB. subtilis spores placed on a substrate at a constant temperature (80 C) a",d a\n-5\npressure of Ie\ntorr. It is believed that the app;~rent "chamber wall" effect\nobserved in previous studies was an artifact due to some undetected and uncontrolled factor or factors among the various vacuum test systems.\n\nPresent data,\n\nutilizing the new test fixture, indicates that highly reproducible results may be\nobtained with, good physical control.\n5-12\n\nI\n\nf\n\nt\n\n!\n\nI\n900-762\n\nTable 5-B. 1.\n\nDuration,\nhrs\n\nEffect of test conditions on Bacillus Subtilis var.\nniger in vacumn\n\nReflectivity\nof Cryoplate\n\nTemperature, \xc2\xb7C\nSubstrate\n\nCryoplate\n\nShroud\n\nShiny\n\nBlack\n\nSurvival\nFraction\n\n2\n\n-185\n\n-\n\n16\n\n80\n\n-185\n\n24\n\n80\n\n-185\n\n-\n\n48\n\n80\n\n-185\n\n2\n\n80\n\n23\n\n16\n\n80\n\n23\n\n24\n\n80\n\n23\n\n48\n\n80\n\n23\n\n-\n\n2\n\n80\n\n23\n\n-\n\nX\n\n0.44\n\n16\n\n80\n\n23\n\n-\n\nX\n\n0.02\n\n24\n\n80\n\n23\n\n-\n\nX\n\n0.0052\n\n48\n\n80\n\n23\n\n-\n\nX\n\n-\n\n2\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\nX\n\nO. 33\n\n16\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\nX\n\nO. 025\n\n24\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\nX\n\n0.0042\n\n48\n\n80\n\n80\n\n80\n\nX\n\n-\n\n2\n\n80\n\n80\n\n-\n\nX\n\n-\n\n16\n\n80\n\n80\n\n-\n\nX\n\n0.02\n\n24\n\n80\n\n80\n\n0.0048\n\n80\n\n80\n\n-\n\nX\n\n48\n\nX\n\n2\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nX\n\n0.0074\n\n16\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nX\n\na\n\n24\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nX\n\n-\n\n48\n\n~,\n\n80\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nX\n\n-\n\nX\n\n0.48\n\n-\n\nX\nX\n\n0.0046\n\nX\n\n0.000058\n\nX\nX\n\n0.035\n\nX\n\n0.0044\n\nX\n\n0.000067\n\n,\n\n,\n\n:.~\n\n-\n\n-\'\n\n5-13\n\nI\n\nI\n),\n\n900-762\n\n10\n\nl.\n6\n\no\n\n~\n\nooec\n\n;\n\nl\n\nAMBIENT\n\n-- j\n\n1.0\n\nJ\n,\n\n. j\n\n,\n\ni 1\n\nIi\n\n~\n!\n\nl\'\nI\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n-1,\n\n,\n\n.\n\n;\n\n1\n\n1\nZ\n0\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n.\'"\n\n5\nu..\n\n-\'\n\xc2\xab\n>\n;;\n\'"\n\n\'"\n~\n\n0.001\n\n.I\n\n0.0001\n\nl\nI\n\n0.00001\n\n1\nI\n\n!\nO.ooOOOIL-L-____________~------~--------------.------------------~\n2\n\n16\n\n24\n\nTIME. hrs\n\nFig. 5-B.2.\n\nEffect of shroud temperature\n5-14\n\n~.\'.--\n\nI\n\n1\n\nII\n\n. 11\n\n900-762\n\no\n\n-lB5\'C\n\no\n\n23\'C\nBO\'C\n\nb.\n1.0\n\nJ\n\n!\nj\n\n0,0001\n\nl\n1\n\n1\n\n/\n\n0.00001\n\nO.OOOOOIL-L-__________~L_____~L---------------------~~---------2\n\n16\n\n24\n\n4B\n\nTIME, hrs\n\nFig. 5-B.3.\n\nEffect of wall temperature\n\n5-15\n\nj\n\n\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7tII\n\nI\n\n1\n\n900-762\n\no BLACK\n\no SHINY\n1.0\n\n.,\n\n" ;\n\n0.000001\n\nLL-------:i-----f.:--------------f.;-------....J\n2\n\n16\n\n24\n\n48\n\nTIME,\n\nFig. 5-B.4.\n\nEffect of wall reflectivity\n\ni\n~\n\n)\n\nhr~\n\n5-16\n\nI\n\n,\n\ni\n\nt.\n\n-..,..----,--~-----==---....i\n\n\\\nIi\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2..--....... \xc2\xb7 I\n\nL_\n\n_~. __ . ~.. _.

Landsat) allows rerrlOte detection of bio-\n\nsystems on a macroscopic scale, i. e., multispectral sensing of agricultural\nand forest crops as well as marine populations.\n\n,\n1\n-!\n\nIt has been suggested that per-\n\nhaps this same technology could be applied to microscopy and allow the detection\nof a microscopic biosystem such as microorganisms on a surface.\nA procedure has been described by Casida (Ref. l) for visual observation of bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, protozoa, and other biosystems in masses\nof soil.\n\nThis technique utilizes a microscope with reflected light, a broad band\n\nwhite light source and time lapse photography.\n\nDifferentiation of microorganisms\n\nfrom soil minerals and organic particles was accomplished by color discrimination using color photography.\n\nThe diffraction colors of in situ soil microorgan-\n\nisms corresponds with the green wavelength of 490 to 500 nm.\n\nSoil particles\n\nappear translucent, grey, brown or black.\nIt

This option, which is desirable due to\n\n6-1\n\ni.I\n\nj\n\nr\n\n--\n\n900-762\n\nthe lack of weight penalties, assumed that the STS payload bay was enclosed with\na flexible liner, 2) Reusable shroud - This option, which is unlikely but still\nbeing considered, assumed that the reusable shroud was an inherent component\nof the orbiter structure, and 3) Disposable shroud - This option assumed that\nthe disposable shroud would be similar to the Mariner 1971 shroud, i. e., clamshell structure opening along a vertical split line.\n\n6.3.1.2 Study Definitions.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, a contam;\'1ation\n\nevent was defined as any event where a high probability existed for the generation of particulate (dust, water, fibers, skin, etc.) and non-particuLate (films,\netc. ) matter, both volatile and nonvolatile in nature.\n\nThese events were\n\nidentified because of the relationship between particulate and microbial contamination, in which greater numbers of particulates generally equate to higher\nmicrobial levels.\nIn a similar manner, quarantine events were identified in qualitative terms,\nfo l\' example, ide ntifying situations (using pasl expe rience) whe re the nature and\ndegree of contamination might l1ecessitate a reprocessing (reclean,\n\ndecon~amina\xc2\xad\n\ntion or sterilization) of the spacecraft in order to meet Planetary Quarantine (PQ)\nrequirements.\n\nThese requirements 2re developed and imposed as NASA policy,\n\nin conjunction with the National Academy of Science I s\n\nl\n\n,\n\nSpace Science Board.\n\nThe type of requirements imposed on a p, oject are missiun dependent.\n\n1\n\n6.3.1.3 Study Assumptions.\n\n1\n\nThe contamination assessment was conducted\n\nusing the foHowing assumptions:\n\n1\n\n1)\n\nAn MJO-type mission was used as the study model.\n\nj\n\n2)\n\nThe spacecraft was installed vertically on the pad with the\n\nj\n\ninterim upper stage (IUS) already in the payload (PiL) bay.\n3)\n\nA reusable shroud would employ gasket-type seals at all closure\npoints, including the adapter and IUS.\n\n4)\n\nContamination and quarantine event identification were based on\nViking type PQ requirements.\n\n6-2\n\nI\ni\nj\n\n!\n\nj\n\n.:\n\nIi\n\n900-762\n\nl\'\n5)\n\nA liner of non-shed mate,-ial would be installed in the P/L\nbay to minimize contamination from orbiter structural\n\ni\n\nand support elements.\n6)\n\nThe P/L bay would be no better than Class 5,000 environment\nprior to launch.\n\n7)\n\nThe abort and reentry mode were not considered to any detail.\nsince any shroud option other than that\n\n0\'\n\nthe pressurized dis-\n\nposable shroud would subject the spacecraft to an influx of\n50 micron or greater particles and minimal humidity control.\n6.3.1.4 Approach.\n\ni\n\n-j\n\nThe approach was to examine the shroud options in rela-\n\nI\n\n} I\n\nI\nI\n\nj\n\ntion to the typical operations that would occur during each mission phase in an\neffort to identify the contaminating events.\n\nIt was understood that this was\n\na first-cut assessment performed in lieu of exacting detail regarding each\noperation.\n\nThe type of contamination, the probable cause of the contamination,\n\nand the suggested method of control were noted along with any salient comments regarding the particular operation.\n6.3.1.5 Conclusions.\n\nThe study conclusions are qualitative in nature and are\n\nreported in terms of the number and type of contaminating events.\n\nIt was assumed.\n\nhowever. that each identified event could potentially have a deleterious effect\nupon the spacecraft due to either an impact on contamination sensitive hardware\nOr by exceeding the PQ imposed microbial burden requirement.\n\n,I\n\nQuantitation of the level of contaminants associated wlth each event\nwould be dependent upon obtaining and understandir_g data for several variables,\nfor example, the duration of the operation, the number of personnel involved,\n\n,\nI\n\nI\nI\nj\n\nthe level of environmental control and other important factors.\nTable 6-1, pages 6-8 through 6-11. indicate that of the 24 identified\noperations \'that occur up to the time of IUS ignition, 22 have sorr,e effect on a\nno-shroud system; 20 have an effect on a reusable shroud system; and only\n8 have an effect on a disI\'\')sable shroud system.\n\nf\ni\n\n!\n~\'--J\n\nj\n,_.1\n\n6-3\n\nT\n\n-~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI\n900-762\n\nIn comparing the no- shroud and reusab Ie shroud system, it should be\nnoted that although the number of contaminating events are similar, the potential for, and the magnitude of, contamination remains greater for a no- shroud\nsystem.\nFor the abort-reentry mode, a review of present plans indicates that\nboth the no-shroud and reusable shroud options would subject the spacecraft to\nan influx of 50 micron or greater particles and minimal humidity control.\n\nSuch\n\na result would necessitate total reprocessing of the spacecraft for PQ and con2\ntamination control (C ) requirements. Prevention of this problem with a disposable shroud would be dependent upon the ability to maintain the shroud\ninterior above ambient and the sustaining of a GN 2 purge.\nThe results further indicate that if the no-shroud or reusable shroud\n\n4\n,\n\noptions are employed, the nature of the prelaunch operations are such that prepad PQ \'sampling could be invalidated.\n\n,\n\nInvalidation could necessitate resampling\n\nI\n\nj\n\non the pad, an operation that requires opacecraft access for 6- 8 hours and an\n\nI\nI\n\nadditional 40-72 hours for the samples to be processed, enumerated, and\npresented for NASA consideration.\nTwo additional problems deserving consideration were revealed as a\nresult of the assessment.\n\nThe first deals with the proposed Class 5,000 clean\n\nroom on the pad, the Payload Changeout Room (PCR).\n\nDrawing on our past\n\nclean room experience, it would be our contention at this time, that PCR appears\ninadequate for PQ constrained spacecraft operations.\n\nUntil more operational\n\n1\n\ndetails become available, it is suggested that personnel numbers and equipment\nwithin the room would have to remain limited, stringent cleaning operations\nwould have to be implemented, and a continuous air quality monitoring capability\nshould be providec. The second problem deals with on-orbit operations. Our preliminary asses sment indicates that, depending upon the nature and magnitude\nof the off-gas, out-gas and molecular cloud formations, a 3-6 hour on-orbit\ndispersion interval may be required prior to deployment of the spacecraft\nfrom the P/L bay.\n\nFailure to implement such a procedure (for the no-shroud\n\nand reusable shroud options) could result in severe degradation in spacecraft\ncleanliness and performance.\n\nIt is unknown, at this time, what effect orbital\n\n6-4\n\n~__~_~_~_~ __ ~~ ~ ~ _~ _~ ~ _\n\nI\n\n-------~\n\n-.\n\n.~ _J\n\n---~"--"\'-\n\n,\n.\n\n\'_i_\n\n900-762\n\nmaneuvering would have in shortening the dispersion interval.\n\nIt should be\n\nnoted, however, that fairly vigorous on-orbit contamination requirements are\nbeing requested by the STS Program Contamination Requirements Definition\nGroup.\':\' At this stage of the program, however, it is unknoVln whether the\noperational STS can achieve them.\nAs a result of the preliminary assessment, it is felt that the no-shroud\nand reusable shroud options result in high contamination risks for the spacecraft (particulate and microbial).\n\nThrough use of the dispo sable shroud options,\n\nthe P/L community could, on a mission-by-mission basis, achieve cleanliness\n\ni\n\nstandards greater than those presently proposed by the STS, at a reasonable\n\nj\n\ncost and with minimal impact on STS operations and facilities.\n6.3.2\n\n!\n\n-1,\n\nQuarantine Monitoring/ Technology Needs\nThis effort evaluated the application of the state-of-the-art quarantine\n\ntechnir-jue used to obtain sampling and monitoring data.\n\n.\'\n\nThese techniques were\n\nas<,essed in light of proposed STS operations and constraints.\n\nThe results of the\n\ne"aluatiun indicated that the Viking-type techniques were indeed usable;

W. L. followed four approaches (Ref. 1):\n\n1\n1\n\n1)\n\nimmunization of personnel,\n\n2)\n\ntesting to determine the presence of hazardous organisms\nand decontaminating to remove them,\n\n3)\n\ndeveloping safe laboratory methods to reduce hazardous\nconditions, and\n\n4)\n\ndeveloping biobarriers to contain biohazardous material.\n\nHowever, when the biological material is virtually unknown such as life from\nanother planet or recombinant genetic material, not all of these approaches\nare practical; e. g.\n\nJ\n\nimmunization.\n\nThe purpose of a sample return investigation is to determine the presence and nature of biological material.\n\n1\n\nThus the approach to the safe manipu-\n\nlation of a l\xc2\xb7eturn sample is to develop handling systems in conjunction with\nbiobarriers to contain potentially biohazardous material.\n\n8-2\n\niU\nI\n\n900-762\n\nlu\n\nIU\n\nThe maximum containment system deviced by the B.

W. L.\n\nhas documented instances of class III cabinet failure leading to laboratory\ninfections (Ref. 3).\nr\'"\\\n,,\n! !.\'\n\\~\n\nThere are a number of locations in the gloves boxes where leaks most\ncommonly occur; the air lock, dunk tank, and pass box used in passing material\nthrough the barrier as well as the rubber gloves.\nHazards due to the air lock can be minimized by reducing traffic\nthrough the interfaces of the biobarrier.\n\nMinimization of material traffic can\n\nbe accomplished in part by having well planned operations and in part by\nhaving a continuous line of biological safety cabinets.\n\nThis allows material\n.>\n\nto be moved from one work station to another without having to be removed\nM\n\n\'_!i(\n\nD\n\nfrom behind the biobarrier.\nThe least reliable portion of the total biobarrier system are the gloves\n\nn\n\nor protective suits.\n\nLJ\n\na normal service life in excess of one year; however, they ar.} subject to many\n\nm\nw\n\nmechanical failures.\n\nRubber gloves presently used in glove box systems have\nThey can be punctured, burned, torn by sharp objects,\n\nor cut by broken glassware.\n\nA very common occurrence in animal work is\n\nresearcher self-innoculation by hypodermic needle.\n\nill\niJl\n\nli\n8-3\n\nI\n\nqj I\n\nJ\n\nL\n900-762\n\nReplacement of a glove or suit being used for handling extraterrestrial\n\n~\n\\\', II I\nI\n~,r.\n"X\n~\n\nmaterial or genetic recombinancy studies may cause a potentially hazardous\nsituation.\n\nThus if use of this weak link in the biobarrier system can be\n\navoided or minimized, it should be.\n\nUse of a remote manipulator or tele-\n\noperator system would allow for the use of an absolute biobarrier system with\nthe ability to maneuver and manipulate samples and material freely.\nA containment system analogous to this class III system has used a\nremote manipulator system in raising germ free animals (Ref. 8).\n\n.\n\nA feasi-\n\nH\nj\n\nj\n\nbility study performed by the B. W. L. in 1960 (Ref.

Since all of these missions were flybys and the\nliklihood of release and growth of terrestrial organisms is small, the Planetary\nQuarantine (PQ) constraints for these programs are readily satisfied with no\nspacecraft, ground operations, or trajectory penalties. For Jovian orbiters,\nthe PQ constraints may not be as easily satisfied because of orbital lifetime\nconsiderations. For outer planet probes, the necessity of, as well as the\ndegree of, sterilization/decontamination for satisfying the quarantine constraints are not understood. In order to do a realistic quarantine appraisal\nof a probe mission, a specific mission, outer planets orbiter/probe (Jupiter)\n- also referred to as Jupiter Orbiter Probe (JOP) - was selected for this\ninvestigation.\n\n,\n\nkJ\n\n-1\n\n",.,\n\n\'I\n.\ni\n\nI\n\nd\n\nI\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2~\n\n",i\n\n-.\n\n-I\n\n~"\n\nA1.1\n\n1\n\n/\n\nJOP Mission and Spacecraft Description\n\n"\n\nA Mission utilizing an outer planet spacecraft is under consideration\nfor a single launch during\'the 1981/1982 opportunity to delivery an entry probe\nin April 1985, and remain active in orbit around the planet for approximately\none year. This proposed mission, designated the Outer Planet Orbiter/Probe\n(Jupiter) OPO/P(J) will offer the first opportunity to make in situ measurements of the Jovian atmosphere. It will also provide the opportunity to\nconduct extensive surveys of the planet, its environment, and its satellites\nutilizing orbits with apsides and orientations which are varied during the\nmission duration.\n\n"\'\ne\n\n;\n\n. \xe2\x80\xa2.

The spacecraft will\nbe either a spin-stabilized (Pioneer type) or three-axis stabilized (Mariner\ntype) spacecraft (reference 1). Flight time from spacecraft injection to\nProbe separation is approximately thirty-seven months. The spacecraft will\nbe aimed directly at the planet with Probe separation occurring 56 days prior\nto JOI. At this time, the Orbiter will be deflected from its impact trajectory.\nThe Orbiter will remain in orbit with a peri jove of 3.0 Rj with an inclination\nof 15 degrees. The Probe will be delivered at a 7.5 degr~e entry angle at\n6 degrees south latitude.\nThe Probe is released at a distance of 500 R.* from Jupiter prior to\nperformance of a maneuver to deflect the Orbiter v~hicle from a planetary\nimpact trajectory. The Probe is nominally targeted to a 7.8 degree (equatorial\nNorth) latitude, posigrade entry point with an inertial entry path angle\n\n*1 Rj = Distance equal to radius of Jupiter.\nA-2\n\n:r\nn\xc2\xb7\n\n~\n\n!\n\n,\n\n+-\n\nJ\n\ni\'\n\nbO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n..\n..\n;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\n,.\n\n,-:-::\'\n\n900-762\nof -7.5 degrees. The Probe enters the atmosphere at a total angle of attack\nwhich is dependent upon the spacecraft/Probe separation conditions .\nThe characteristics of the Probe\'s motion will be determined by the\ndescent trajectory and aerodynamic properties upon entry into the planet\'s\nsensible atmosphere. The entry flight path angle of -7.5 degrees limits\nentry deceleration to the 300 g E level, which is well within the design\nvalue.\nThe following is a brief description of the Probe mission time-line\nfor atmospheric descent as presented in Figure A1. The Probe enters the\nsensible atmosphere 56 days after separation from the spacecraft and encounters\nthe atmospheric heating and deceleration environments. At a subsonic speed\n(M = 0.9) the in-situ measurement sequence is initiated by deploying the\ntemperature sensor and mass spectrometer pressure inlet tube through the\nheat shield. The Probe continues to descend through the atmosphere relaying\nboth stored and real time scientific data to Earth via the Orbiter. In-situ\ndata is collected and transmitted to the spacecraft for the approximately\n30 minute time span it takes to reach the 30 bar pressure level, wherein\nthe communication levels geometry constraint is exceeded.\nAs for the Probe itself, it is a blunted 60 degree half-angle cone\nentry vehicle with a hemispherical afterbody, weighs 150 kg, and is 89 cm\nin diameter. A carbon phenolic heat shield covers the forward cone and remains\non the Probe throughout atmospheric descent. The Probe spin rate at separation\nfrom the bus is nominally 5 rpm\'s. An external insulating blanket made of\n25 layers of goldized mylar and nominally 1.21 cm thick covers the entire\nProbe. The Pr,)be carries eight experiments which are provided to determine\nthe physical structure and chemical composition of the upper portion of the\ntroposphere, and the infrared radiation from the planet. Prior to the peak\nheat pulse, energetic particle and accelerometer data are gathered and stored\nfor playback during real time data transmission.\nWhile the Probe forebody is a single piece, carbon phenolic sphere,\nthe after-body is a fiberglass-phenolic honeycomb hemisphere filled with\na low density elastomeric ablation material. The forward ablator spherical\nnose section is 9.33 cm thick and the conical section is 5.39 cm thick.\nThe carbon phenolic heat shield is bonded to a fiberglass face sheet 1.27\nmm thick over a fiberglass-phenolic honeycomb core 2.15 cm thick. The honeycomb\nis in turn bonded by a high temperature adhesive to the outer surface of\n1.52 mm thick aluminum cone (the primary structure). The honeycomb core\nis filled with powder. The heat shield is sized to dissipate the Jupiter\nentry heat load (primary by ablation) that is calculated for a Jupiter nominal\natmosphere at an entry angle of -7.5. A polyurethane foam cover forms the\naft closure on the equipment.\nThe aft heat shield consists of a hemispherical fiberglass honeycomb\nsandwich 0.6 cm thick to which is bonded a 0.6 cm thick open honeycomb core.\nThe core is filled with a low density elastomeric ablator by vacuum techniques.\nThe primary structure is designed for entry deceleration of 800 gE\nwith a safety factor of 1.25. The individual loads distributed over the\nstructure are uniformly balanced by the atmospheric pressure loads that impin~e\non the heat shield face during entry, so that a minimum of bending is present\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\nA-3\n\n..\n,\n\nl\n\n1\n\n900-762\n\nJUPITER 1981 rlOtlil/Al tuSSIOIi\n\n.IICTIVATE KAlil BATTERY ENERGIZE\n\nT1HELINE\nTiME\n\no DATA HANDL ING SYSTEM\n\nALTITUDE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ACCELEROMETERS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 g SWITCH\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ENERGETIC PARTICLE DETECTOR\n\n(km)\n\n\xc2\xb740\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ENG WEER IIIG SENSORS\ne MASS SPECTROMETER PUMPS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GAS CHROHATOGRAPIl BEATERS\n\n(MIN)\n\n-1-\n\nSEPARATION "OIl PlOHEER \xe2\x80\xa2 "DAYS\n\n~,\n\\,\n\n\'I. ,\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\\ \\\n\n]\n\n~Q\n\n,\n\nj\n\n~\n0\n\n1000\n\n00\n\n\'"\'0\n\nCALIBRATE PRESSURE SEI/SOR AND START\nUPPER ATMOSPERE/lOIl ACCELERAT:OII STORE\n\n\'""\'-i\n\nI\n\n(SEC)\n7.\n\n\'00\n\na,,- 0,0004 gr\'" SENSIBLE ATMilSPH[Rl\n\nENERGI ZE\n\n1\n\nCHANGE 10 ~!l1iH ~r.\'t\nSTO~AG\xc2\xa3 MID II[{O~:-)\n\nI\nl U[JlTSln::l[)\n\no PRESSURE SENSOR\n\n340\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n"\n"\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.0\n\nTEr~PERATUR[ SENSOR\nI<1ASS SPf./;TROMETER\nGAS CHROMATOGRAPH\nNEPHElOMETER\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NET FLUX RAOIOI1ETER\n\nliS\n\n17.\n\n100\nACTIVATE TRANSMITTER -30 gE \'5------>-\\\n\n,.\n\nDEPLOY\nIUt 3 CLOUDS\n\n19.\n\n0\n\nSOD\n\n\xc2\xb740\n\n900\n\n-100\n\n1650\n\n-170\n\n-3 gE\' S------io+--1+\n\nP~O.lATM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SAMPLING iUBf FOR HASS SPECTROMETER,\ntJ\n\n1\n\nGAS CHROMATOGRAPH AIm PRESSURE SENSOR\nNEPHELOMETER PORT\n\nP \xe2\x80\xa2 1 ATM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 TEMPERATURE SrllSOR\n\xe2\x80\xa2 IIET FLUX RAOIOIIETER PORT\nC~.L\n\nISRATE TEMPERATURE SEIISOR\nBEGIN TRANSMISSION\n\nP : 3 AH1\nH\n\n.\n\nnYI\'[R,\'l\'JPfS\n\no.\n-,\n\n:,tA(lt 1 .J\n\n~\n\n.,\n\n.,\n\nl\'\n\n)~\n\nI\n\n;:.\'\n\nP=10ATM\nP \xe2\x80\xa2 30 AIM\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nj\n\nl\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n~l\nFigure A-1.\n\nProbe Time-Line for Jupiter 1 981 l~ominal l~ission\n\nr\'\n\n,,~--\xc2\xad\n\n, 1\n;\niii\n\n\\1\n\n,\n"\n\n---- ----- -------------------------\n\n::J\'\n\n,\n\n:\'1\n\n1-\n\n..\n\n900-162\nj,\non either the carbon phenolic heat shield or on the primary sandwich type\nstructure.

Reproductive death is measured\nquantitatively as the ability of a microbe to form a clone under optimU!".\ncondit1ons. For application to planetary quarantine, it is assumed that\na cell incapable of division under optimum conditions would be incapable\nof division under conditions of planetary contamination.\n\n,~\n\n,\n\nI\n,\n\nThis work describes the effect of high energy electrons on survival\nof microorganisms associated with unsterile spacecraft. it is a subtask\nof a larger task concerned with determining the consequences of solar, cosmic\nand planetary trapped radiations on spacecraft decontamination requirements.\nWith fly-by missions now planned for Jupiter and Saturn and possible Jupiter\norbiters and probes, the planetary trapped radiation belts represent environments lethal to microorganisms that could reduce pre-launch spacecraft decontaminr,tion requirements. Tha m\'ljor components of these radiation belts are\nelectrons and protons. This ~ork evaluates possible biological effects of\nthe electron component of these belts by subjecting several spacecraft microbial\nisolates to different energies, exposures, and dose rates and then investigating\nmodels that describe the microbes\' survival as a function of the radiation\ninsult.

The mean survival fraction weighted\nby the inverse of its standard deviation was the data used to develop and\nevaluate models of radiation sensitivity.\nEach model\'s ability to fit the data was evaluated quantitatively.\nThe criterion for judging the goodness of fit for a particular model is the\nweighted root-mean-square error \xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n~.J\n\n~ ~ 2:\ni=1\nN\n\n1\\\n...\nf\'\n\niJ\nf\nL\n\nr\nD\n, I\n\n11\nn\n.. ,,,j\n\n,\n\n11\ne"\n\'1\n\nr\n\n~.\n\n~\n\n..\n\n...\nJ[\n\n.\n\n""\'\'1\n"\n\nJ;\n~,1\n\nt\n\n":\n\n"-\'\n\n,\n\nil\nI\nI\nI\n\nRMS Error =\n\n(1)\n\nu is the number of degrees of freedom in the data, Yi is the mean value of\nthe ith data point, f(xi,Pi) is the value of the model at that point and\nui is the standard deviation associated with the ith point. Two computer\nprograms, one a linear regression program in the JPL library and the other\na non-linear regression fitting program developed as part of this task, are\nused to evaluate models. Both programs determine model parameters that produce\nthe minimum weighted RMS error for the model under investigation.\nThe capabilities of several models to fit the data have been investigated \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe origin and capabilities of each model are discussed in the next section.\nReference 2 pres~nts an analysis of variance of the data that indicates all\nthe independent variables, organism, temperature, energy, flux and fluence,\nhave significant effects on the survival fraction. Therefore, an attempt\nwas made to employ these variables explicitly in some of the models. However,\nthe analysis of variance is not robust with respect to the assumption of\nequal sample variance for each data point (i.e. it is not capable of determining\nwhether the observation is caused by a functional dependence or by varying\nuncertainties Lntroduced as the result of changing the variable) and in subsequent\nmodel evaluation no simple functional dependence on energy or flux was apparent\nwithin the range of, the experiment.\nThree signHicant conclusions may be based on behavior of the data.\nFirst, the non-sporeforming microbes are significantly more radio sensitive than\nthe sporulated microbes. Second, each model was investigated twice, once\nwith survival fraction as a function of dose and once as a function of fluence. 1\nFor every model the RMS error was smal\'er with fluence as the independent\nvariable. This behavior indicates that radio sensitivity is proportional\nto electron fluence rather than an average energy density. Third, as microbe\ntemperature increases, the survival fraction at a given fluence decreases.\nThis behavior lndicates that the temperature effect is not the result of\na heat activated repair mechanism, but possibly an accelerated cell cycle.\n\n1Green-Burki model excepted.\n\nB-3\n\ni _\n\n-,\n\n-\'H1\n\n900-162\n\nI.!:>t\n\nnh\n\nB4.\n\nRESULTS 1\n\nLit\n\nB4.1\n\nLinear Model\n\n"\':"v\n"\n\n":i\n\nAs microbes are irradiated it is reasonable to assume that the number\nof microbes "killed" is proportional to the total number of viable microbes\npresent and the electron fluence, i.e. dN = -QNd~where N is the number\nof viable organisms and\nis the fluence.

First the temperature and flux ranges investigated\nare very limited. Second, while the energy effects are small the results\nof a parallel sub task (Effect of Solar Wind on Microorganisms) indicate they\nbecome very large as the energy decreases, particularly below about 15 keV.\nFinally, as the models are phenomenological and not physical, there is no\nassurance that they are valid outside the fluence, flux, temperature and\nenergy ranges investigated and extrapolation could yield misleading estimates.\n\nB-l0\n\n~\n\n! ,\n\n\\.:.;\n\n900-762\n\n\'\',I\nill\n\nB5.2\n\nPlanetary Quarantine Estimation\n\nConsidering the models evaluated the modified quadratic model, equaGion\n7, had the lowest RMS error for all organisms 2 and therefore is the model\nrecommended for planetary quarantine microbial burden estimates.\n\n-]\ni\n~;\n\n,-\n\nHigh, nominal and low survival engineering models for estimating microbe\nsurvival in high energy electron environments were constructed. These models\nare illustrated for the comparative organism Bacillus subtilis var. niger in\nFigure B5. The nominal model is the modified quadratic model of Section B4.2.\nThe high and low survival models were constructed by fitting a parabola to\nthe extreme (highest and lowest) survival observed for each fluence. The\narea between these two models therefore includes most of the data observed\nand observations outside the area have a low probability of occurrence.\nThe high no~inal and low survival model parameters are given in Tables B8,\nB5, and B9 respectively.\n\nTable B8.\n\nParameters for High Survival Model\n\nIr\n\nOrganism\n\nY\n(X 10-27 cm 4 )\n\n(X 1O- 13 cm2 )\n\nK\n\n(X 10- 3 )\n\nT\n\nI\no\n\n1\nI\nL-,-\\\n\n1\n2\n8\n9\n11\n12\n13\n16\n18\nBSN\n4\n5\n19\nSE\nSpore Mean\nVegetative Mean\n\nLOg\n0.643\n1. 31\n0.988\n0.751\n0.902\n0.779\n0.370\n0.403\n1.26\n1.88\n0.659\n2.00\n2.16\n0.142\n2.24\n\n4.14\n7. 11\n1.28\n3.10\n3.05\n1.89\n3.16\n6.35\n5.34\n3.13\n0.360\n5.25\n4.31\n5.64\n8.05\n-1.82\n\n-5.94\n-6.43\n-0.193\n-1.88\n-1.06\n3.29\n1.90\n-0.439\n-3.01\n1.56\n11.2\n-1.49\n\n7.67\n-4.40\n2.86\n-7.70\n\nl\'\nI\n\nI\n, I\n\n20rganism 4 excepted.
