Hudson, Editor)\nwhich was transmitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Congress. Under the\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1977, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nis required to report both to the Environmental Protection Agency and to the Congress on its assessment of\nthe current state of knowledge of the stratosphere and mesosphere. These reports are to be prepared biannually starting in January 1980. This report is the first in that series.\nIn order to prepare this report, the Goddard Space Flight Center organized a workshop at Harpers Ferry,\nWest Virginia during the week of June 4, 1979. The workshop was centered around seven working groups. A\nLaboratory Measurements Working Group, chaired by Dr. W.B. DeMore of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory;\na Models Working Group chaired by Dr. D. Stroebel of the Naval Research Laboratory; a Budget Working\nGroup chaired by Dr. R. Cicerone of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography; a Radicals Working Group\nchaired by Dr. J. Anderson, Harvard University; a Meteorology Working Group chaired by Dr. M. Geller,\nUniversity of Miami; a Trends Working Group chaired by Dr. J. London, University of Colorado; and a\nPredictions Working Group chaired by Dr. R. Stolarski of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The overall\nChairman for the Workshop was Dr. R.D. Hudson of the Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. L. Rex Megill,\nUtah State University was the Vice-chairman and Mrs. Edith Reed of the Goddard Space Flight Center was\nthe Co-Chairman.\nEach working group was further subdivided and prominent scientists active and expert in stratospheric and\nmesospheric studies were asked to prepare position papers to cover selected topics of research. In addition to\npreparing position papers, modeling groups were approached to run their models using a standard set of input\ndata supplied by the Goddard Space Flight Center and to predict the impact on the stratosphere of specific\nnatural and anthropogenic perturbations. Specific output data, as well as predicted ozone changes, were requested in order that realistic model comparisons could be made.\nOver 90 scientists representing most of the institutions engaged in upper atmospheric research in the United\nStates, Canada and Europe attended the Workshop. A complete list of the position paper authors and the\nparticipants with working group assignments is given in the Appendix. Each working group prepared a summary document and these have been assembled into this report. Thus, this report should represent current\nknowledge as of June 1979.\nGoddard Space Flight Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration wish to express their\nthanks to the working group chairmen, the position paper authors, and the participants for the time and\neffort that they contributed to the preparation of this report.\n\n111\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIlllllllllll I\nI

PHOTOCHEMICAL\n\nDATA FOR MODELING\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe kinetic and photochemical\n\ndata in this chapter is an update of the publication\n\nJPL 79-27, Chemica/\n\nKinetic and Photochemical Data for Use in Stratospheric Modelling, by DeMore et al. (1979). The foregoing\npublication should be consulted for a more comprehensive discussion and evaluation of the laboratory data\nbase that was used to arrive at the present recommendations.\nThe JPL 79-27 publication was prepared by the NASA Panel for Data Evaluation, which is an on-going\nworking group charged with the responsibility of producing an updated tabulation of laboratory data related\nto the stratosphere, at intervals of approximately nine months. Their first evaluation appeared in NASA\nRP-1010, Chlorofluoromethanes and the Stratosphere, edited by Hudson (1977). The tabulations presented\nin this chapter represent the third evaluation of that working group.\nIn addition to kinetic and photochemical data, the present chapter contains sections on the following topics as\nthey relate to the stratosphere: heterogeneous chemistry, ionic processes, and infrared spectroscopy. No attempt is made to tabulate all laboratory data for these areas; rather, they are discussed in more general terms\nand references to available literature are given.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn recent years, considerable progress has been made in the laboratory measurement of rate constants and\ncross sections for use in stratospheric modeling, and in many respects, these rates are the best-founded part of\nstratospheric science. Nevertheless, a number of major problems remain, ranging from small (but not insignificant) differences in results for a given parameter obtained by different laboratories, to the possibility\nthat major factors have not been properly incorporated in the chemical schemes. Indeed, there are discrepancies in the comparison of the measurements with predictions in the stratosphere that suggest at least the\npossibility that the models are not complete. There are also cases involving laboratory simulations of selected\naspects of stratospheric photochemistry which do not seem to be compatible with the rate constants which\nhave been measured independently (usually on an absolute, direct basis). Some of the difficulties may stem\nfrom the need to study reactions under conditions similar to those under which the results are to be applied. It\nhas long been recognized that rate constants and cross sections used for stratospheric temperatures should be\nmeasured at those same temperatures wherever possible because of the uncertainties attached to long\ntemperature extrapolations. Similarly, it is becoming apparent that other conditions such as total pressure\nmust often be taken into account because some presumably bimolecular reactions may in fact occur by more\ncomplex mechanisms. Partial pressures of other gases, such as water vapor or oxygen, may occasionally affect reaction rates.\nIt is the general consensus of the Laboratory Measurement Group that tuning of rate constants to fit\nstratospheric observations is inadvisable, since no matter how uncertain the laboratory measurements may\nbe, they are probably more reliable than the deductions based on stratospheric measurements. The combined\nerrors arising from both model and measurement ambiguities are expected to be greater than those of the\nlaboratory measurements. Thus, artificial adjustment of rate constants may obscure important evidence\nwhich could otherwise be inferred from the existence of a discrepancy between prediction and observation.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n2\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nIn subsequent paragraphs of this chapter, recent developments in the different reaction categories are discussed and several specific problem areas are outlined. These should not be taken as a statement of priorities\nfor further study since the definition of importance depends somewhat on the objective in mind. For example,\nsome reactions may be relatively unimportant (as determined by a sensitivity analysis) in terms of the overall\neffect on the total ozone column density, but may be the most important factor in setting the ratios of certain\nspecies in the atmosphere. Since such ratio measurements are important for testing the accuracy of\nphotochemical models, the corresponding rate constants need to be known precisely. In some cases, additional study is suggested because the experimental data do not seem to yield rate constant parameters consistent with theory or previous experience on similar reactions. It must be stressed that anomalies in rate constants frequently suggest the presence of error.\nFrom the standpoint of CFM-induced ozone depletion, there are approximately 16 rate constants and 8\nphotolysis parameters to which the predictions are particularly sensitive. These processes are listed in table 151\nin order of descending effect.\n\nTable l-l\nThe Most Important Rate Constant and Photolysis Parameters\nfor Prediction of Ozone Depletion by CFMs\n\nRate Constants\n\nPhotolysis\n\nCl0 + 0 -+ Cl + 0,\n\n02,X > 200nm\n\nN,O+O(\xe2\x80\x98D)\n\nSolar flux, X < 320 nm\n\n+ NO+NO\n-+ N2 + 0,\n\nOH + 0, + HO, + 0,\n\nNzO cross sections\n\nO(*D)+M\n\nO3 +hu-+02\n\n+ 0(3P)+M\n\n+O(\xe2\x80\x98D)\n\nHCI+OH\n\n+ H,O+Cl\n\n0, cross sections\n\nOHtNO,\n\n+M + HNO, +M\n\nHNO, cross sections\n\nO+NO,\nNO+O,\n\n+ NO, +O\n\nClONO, cross sections\n\n+ 0, +-NO\n2\n\nNO+HO,\n\n+ NO, +OH\n\nOH+HO,\n\n--f H,O+O,\n\nCl + 0, --f Cl0 + 0,\nCl0 + NO, + M -+ ClONO, + M\nO+O,+M+O,+M\nH,O+O(\xe2\x80\x98D)\n\n+ OH+OH\n\nCl0 + NO + NO, + Cl\nCltCH,\n\n+ HCltCH\n\n3\n\nHO, + 0, + OH + 20,\n\nNO, cross sections\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n3\n\nNO, and O(lD) Reactions\nIn general, the kinetic data base for NO, reactions is relatively good. The chemistry of N atoms is not too well\ndefined, but these reactions are only of secondary importance in a consideration of stratospheric chemistry.\nIndependent confirmation of the temperature dependence for the important reaction 0, + NO is needed.\nDirect mechanistic information is needed for the reaction OH + HNO,; its unusually low preexponential factor suggests the possibility of a more complex reaction than simple H-atom abstraction, or possibly other\nproblems.\nThere are only five reactions involving O(lD) that are important when considering the chemistry of the upper\natmosphere. These are the reactions with N, and 0, (the dominant quenching species), with N,O (the only\nsource of stratospheric NO), with HZ0 (the principal source of OH), and with CF,O (the principal removal\nmechanism for CF,O). The very important branching ratio for the reaction of O(1D) with N,O requires further study. Recently reported results are significantly different from earlier results, and indicate a source of\nNO greater than previously believed. Further studies are needed to confirm the recently reported quenching\ncomponents in the interaction of O(tD) with N,O, H,O, and CH,.\nThere are almost no data on the reactions of HO,NO,. Studies of HO,NO,\nmospheric species are needed to understand its role in atmospheric chemistry.\n\nreactions with reactive at-\n\nHO, Reactions\nSince the original report (NASA RP-lOlO), kinetic studies have clarified many areas of uncertainty which existed at that time. Many problems, however, still remain. Very few reactions are known to better than 20% at\nroom temperature, no temperature dependence data are available for several reactions, Arrhenius parameters\nare unusual for some reactions, and, for some key reactions, results are conflicting.\nThis latter group contains the reactions\nl\n\nOH + HO,\n\n- H,O + 0,\n\nl\n\nHO, + HO, - H,O,\n\nl\n\nHO, + 0,\n\n+ 0,\n\n- OH + 20,\n\nwhich have been and still are the major problem of HO, chemistry. Complex-formation\nbetween HO, and\nwater vapor (at millibar pressures) has interfered in several HO, + HO, studies, but is novv fairly well\ncharacterized. For this reaction, there is preliminary evidence for a very strong negative temperature\ndependence (E/R = - 1245 K), as well as possible pressure dependence. As a further complication, the\ntemperature dependence has been shown to change with pressure. The rate constant recommended here,\nhowever, is both pressure and temperature independent because the apparent dependencies are preliminary,\nunpublished, and not fully understood. Users of the tables presented in this chapter will undoubtedly want to\nuse these temperature and pressure dependencies in calculations. They are cautioned, however, to be careful\nto include both effects and not to exceed the range of values actually encompassed by the data. For example,\nuse of the temperature dependence without the corresponding pressure dependence will lead to anomalously\nhigh rate constants at low pressures. The overworked cliche caveat emptor has never been more valid than it is\nhere.\nThe reaction OH + HO, also exhibits a possible pressure dependence, based on the discrepancies between\nlow pressure and atmospheric pressure studies. Clearly, a detailed study is needed of the pressure dependence\nof this reaction by a direct technique.\n\nIllIll I I\n\nI\n\n4\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nThere is reasonable agreement among the various studies on HO, + O,, although some discrepancies need to\nbe resolved. In addition, this reaction has unusual Arrhenius parameters, and further experimental and\ntheoretical work is needed to confirm these findings. Curiously, the unusual Arrhenius parameters for this\nreaction, coupled with the suprisingly strong negative temperature dependence for the HO, + HO, reaction,\nyields a rate constant ratio in excellent agreement with actual measurements of that ratio (see JPL 79-27 and\nDeMore, 1979). The recent DeMore study is a simplified simulation of a clean, wet atmosphere. Thus, if\nsteady-state 0, levels in that study are not explained by recommended rate constants, it is probable that the\n- actual atmosphere will also remain unexplained. The recommendations given in this chapter are consistent\nwith DeMore\xe2\x80\x99s results, except that a high value (1 to 2 x IO-\xe2\x80\x9c) of k(OH + HO,) is needed. Currently, this\nreaction is, as it has been in all prior reports, a major uncertainty in stratospheric chemistry.\nThere are several other HO, reactions worthy of general note. One is OH + CO - CO, + H which (except\nunder clean, ideal conditions) exhibits a pressure dependence in non-inert gases, doubling the rate constant at\natmospheric pressure. Thus, the recommendation contains a multiplicative factor of 1 + P,r, where Pat, is\nthe pressure in atmospheres.\nThe reactions of H,O, with 0 and OH exhibit unusual Arrhenius behavior, both in absolute value and\nrelative to one another. In view of the difficulties in working with H,O, and the problems mentioned in the\nNotes in JPL 79-27, additional investigations are needed. A recent room-temperature study of OH + H,O,\n(Harris and Pitts, 1979) agrees very well with the present recommendation, but provides no temperature\ndependence clarification.\nThe reaction OH + 0, - HO, + 0, presents an interesting contrast to the typical situation, viz, the\ntemperature dependence below 300 K is in better agreement than either the temperature dependence above\n300 K or the room temperature rate constant. Values of k (298 K) reported by various investigators vary over\na wider range than desirable, especially in view of the excellent E/R agreement between these studies. An\nunexplained anomaly concerning this reaction is revealed in the recent Zahniser and Howard study (Howard,\nprivate communication, 1979), yielding a curved Arrhenius plot agreeing with the other studies on E/R below\n300 K but showing a significant increase above that temperature. A limited temperature range study by\nDeMore (1975) agrees very well with their apparent E/R in the overlapped temperature range. However, caution must be used here since the DeMore study was relative to OH + CO and it is not entirely clear what the\ncorrect temperature behavior of that reference reaction is under his conditions.\nRecommendations for some other reactions have been confirmed by recent studies. For the most part, conclusions expressed in JPL 79-27 are unchanged in this report.\n\nHalogen Chemistry\nSince the NASA RP-1010 evaluation, there have been many changes in the recommended values for halogen\nrate coefficients. However, most of the modifications in the important ClO, rate coefficients, i.e., for the\nreactions Cl + O,, 0 + CIO, Cl + CH,, OH + HCl etc., have been at best relatively minor (less than 10%\nchange in k at stratospheric temperatures), and as such will not significantly affect the output of the\nphotochemical modeling calculations. Some of the most important changes in the ClO, data base are that experimental data have now become available for k (Cl + H,CO), k (OH + ClO) and k(H0, + ClO). Inclusion of the Cl + H&O reaction has neither seriously affected the predicted photochemical partitioning of\nClO,, nor the predicted ozone perturbation by ClO,. The OH + Cl0 reaction has only been studied at 298 K,\nand the product distribution is not quantitatively understood. An upper limit of 35% of the total reaction has\nbeen placed on the channel producing HCl + 0,. However, even if only a few percent of the overall reaction\nproduced HCl + O,, it would still be of atmospheric importance. Although the HCl channel would seem to\nrequire the reaction to proceed rapidly (approximately lo-lo cm3 molecule-\xe2\x80\x98s-l) via a four-center complex, it\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n5\n\ncannot be ruled out. One channel of the Cl0 + Cl0 and BrO + BrO reactions proceeds rapidly by an apparent four-center intermediate. Consequently, additional studies of this reaction are required, with emphasis\non the temperature dependence of both the overall rate coefficient and the rate coefficients of the individual\nreaction channels. The experimental values for k (Cl0 + HO,) at 298 K are significantly greater (by a factor\nof 30) than the earlier estimate. In addition, Howard et al. (private communication, 1979) report nonlinear\nArrhenius behavior for this reaction, suggesting the possibility of a complex reaction mechanism with one or\nmore sets of reaction products. At present, experimental studies are being performed in order to provide\ndetailed mechanistic information on this reaction. As in the case of the OH + Cl0 reaction, even if only a few\npercent of the total reaction produces HCl, the HO, + Cl0 reaction would be of significant atmospheric importance. Consequently, additional studies of the temperature dependence of this rate coefficient and identification of the reaction products are needed.\nReactions where the rate coefficients have been significantly revised include k(C1 + HO,), k(C1 + H,O,),\nand k(OH + CH,CCl,). The last of these has a significant impact on understanding the atmospheric lifetime\nof CH,CCl,.\nThere are several other areas in which further studies are required. For example, there is reason to suspect that\nthe reaction Cl0 + NO, + M yields both ClONO, and possible isomers such as ClOONO as reported by\nChang et al. (1979). This possibility is suggested by the fact that the reaction Cl + NO, + M yields both\nClNO, and ClONO as noted by Niki et al. (1978a). The possibility of multiple pathways for other reactions,\nparticularly the fluorine and bromine analogues of the above, needs consideration.\nTwo recommendations are made for Cl0 + NO, + M (see table l-3). The first corresponds to the measured\ndisappearance rate constant for the reactants, and assumes that only CIONO, is formed. The second corresponds to the results from the pyrolysis of CIONO, and must (assuming a correct equilibrium constant) correspond to formation of only ClONO,. If the discrepancy is indeed a result of isomer formation, the total\ndisappearance of Cl0 and NO, in this reaction must be obtained by adding rate constants for each of the\npathways at any temperature and pressure. The atmospheric fate of the isomers must also be considered.\nConsequently, identification of the primary products (as a function of T and P) is required, in addition to further studies of the temperature and pressure dependence of this reaction. More information is required on the\ndetailed degradation mechanisms of species such as CH,CCl, and C&l,, to determine whether stable\nchlorinated compounds other than HCl are formed in the degradation process.\nWhereas most of the important ClO, rate coefficients are quite well established, this is not the case in the\nBrO, system. Although many of the BrO, reactions have been studied since NASA RP-1010, all reactions (except the NO + BrO and Br + 0, reactions) should be re-examined. The key reactions requiring further examination are: Cl0 + BrO, Br + HO,, OH + HBr, OH + BrO, and BrO + NO, + M. Reactions such as\nBr + H&O may also be important. In each case, emphasis must be placed not only on determining the\npressure and temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, but also on understanding the reaction\nmechanism, i.e., the relative importance of the reaction channels. There is recent evidence of a synergistic effect between ClO, and BrO, leading to an efficient catalytic destruction of ozone through the BrO + Cl0 Cl + Br + 0, reaction.\nAlthough the rate coefficient data base for FO, reactions is rather poor, it is difficult to identify those reactions which need better understanding in relation to the distribution of fluorine-containing\nspecies in the\nstratosphere. In addition, it is generally assumed that the catalytic efficiency of FO, for destroying ozone is\nlow, due to both the rapid formation of HF and the unreactivity of this species.\n\nIllIllI I\nI\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n6\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nMethane Oxidation\nA simplified and therefore incomplete scheme describing the oxidation of methane in the stratosphere is\nshown in figure l-l. Most of the reactions shown are evaluated in this chapter. Information on these reactions\nhas been increasing rapidly since the appearance of the NASA RPlOlO evaluation. The recommended values\nfor the rate coefficients of all these reactions have undergone modification, and new reactions have been\nadded. The kinetics of CH,O and CH,O, radicals have been growing especially rapidly, but the present data\nbase is still relatively poor. This should improve as the result of more laboratory experiments involving direct\nmonitoring of the radical species.\nA characteristic of many of the reactions involved in methane oxidation is the possibility of multiple reaction\nchannels. Accordingly, there is a need for mechanistic information to complement the growing data base for\nrate coefficients. In addition, there may be a significant pressure dependence for some of these reactions,\nespecially those involving the larger free radicals such as CH,O and CH,O,. Also, there is no assurance that\nreaction channel ratios for a particular reaction will remain constant for varying pressure or temperature. All\nof these features emphasize the need for continuing mechanistic, temperature, and pressure studies.\n\n-\n\n.\n\nHO2\n\n02\nI\n\n)\n\nr.u\n\nCH4\n\nO(\'D)\n\n4\n\nCH302\n\nCH,OOH\nOH\n\nc\n\nNO,NO,\n\nA\nA\n\nOH\nHCO\n\n0\n\nH,CO\n\n4\n\nOH\nco\n\nco2\n\n02\n\nhv\nCH,O\n\n4\n\nCH,OH\n*\n\nFigure l-l.\n\nMethane oxidation.\n\nSO, Reactions\nThe reactions evaluated are for the oxidation of a few simple sulfides which have been observed in the atmosphere and are considered important in the global sulfur cycle.\nThe reactions of known mechanistic simplicity are characterized by fairly low uncertainties in the Arrhenius\nparameters. These typically involve simple atom abstraction by either 0 or OH. For others, however, the\n\n7\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\npossibility of alternate addition channels has been suggested. Unfortunately, direct mechanistic observations\nto either support or oppose these hypotheses are lacking, and uncertainties in the rate constants reflect the\nlack of data. Since it appears that in the 200 to 300 K temperature region, no one reaction path dominates,\nthere is a strong need for quantitative mechanistic measurement as a function of temperature. For the reactions 0 + H,S, OH + OCS, and OH + CS,, these studies should be accompanied by accurate rate constant\ndeterminations.\nThe production of SH as a product in at least two, and possibly four, of the processes opens yet another area\nof reaction uncertainty. There is at present a paucity of information on the atmospheric fate of the SH\nradical. Speculation is possible about the fate in the presence of 0, or 0, and the similarity (or lack of\nsimilarity) of its reactions to those of OH, but there is little direct information upon which to base any conclusions. For this reason, laboratory studies of SH kinetics are also recommended. The reaction of OH with SO,\nis believed to be a primary step in atmospheric aerosol formation, and subsequent reactions of HSO, need to\nbe studied.\n\nThird-Order Reactions\nThe present evaluation uses a somewhat different approach for the presentation of third-order rate constants\nthan NASA RP-1010, which employed either curve-fitted analytical expressions (as for CIONO, and HNO,\nformation) or otherwise gave only the limiting low-pressure rate constants in the Arrhenius form. Here, the\nlow-pressure rate constants are given in the form:\nk 0(T) = k300 (T/300)-\xe2\x80\x9d cm%r\n0\n\n(1)\n\n(where the value is suitable for air as the third body), together with the recommended value of n. Where\npressure fall-off corrections are necessary, an additional entry gives the limiting high pressure rate constant in\na similar form:\nk, (T) = k~(T/300)-\xe2\x80\x9d\n\ncm%-1.\n\n(2)\n\nTo obtain the effective second-order rate constant for a given condition of temperature\n(altitude), the following formula is used: (See JPL 79-27 for a detailed discussion.)\nk(z) = k(M,T)\n\n= ( A------)k CWMI\n\n1 + k,U\xe2\x80\x99Wl/k,a\n\nf-U\n\n0.6 { 1 + bg,o\n\n(ko(\xe2\x80\x98WWk,(T))12j\n\nand pressure\n\n-I\n\nThe number 0.6 which appears in this formula has been changed from the value 0.8 which appears in JPL\n79-27. This small change better accommodates the data and is more consistent with theory.\nThis expression allows the computation of k(z) from the tabulated values of k, and k,. From the discussion\nin the Appendix of JPL 79-27 and references cited, it is clear that this formula is an oversimplification of the\ncomplex formulae of unimolecular rate theory. As presented, it appears to be a good representation of the\nsparse amount of relevant data. The adjective good is obviously a subjective one, and if the reaction of interest is highly sensitive for a particular calculation, precise and accurate data taken under appropriate conditions must be obtained.\nIn the case of the important reaction, HO + NO, N HNO,, the recommended expression fits the pressure\n2\nand temperature data exactly, within the precision with which they have been obtained.\nThe representation presented here is a good way to supply information to stratospheric models for many reactions for which the data base is sparse (or even non-existent), and may serve as an indicator of those reactions\nwhich deserve high laboratory priorities. One of the best uses of a theoretically based codification-andextrapolation technique is to indicate where time and effort are not necessary.\n\n8\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nPhotochemical Processes\nA number of problem areas remain in UV cross-section measurements, as well as in the determination\nquantum yields and identities of products for several photochemical processes.\n\nof\n\nThere is a large discrepancy between the theoretical calculations of HOC1 absorption cross sections (which indicate negligible absorption beyond 300 nm) and the experimental results; the reason for this is not known.\nMore experiments should be carried out, if possible, using an HOC1 source other than gas-phase hydrolysis of\nCl,O. The recommendation\nis to adopt the experimental results which indicate that HOC1 will\nphotodissociate quite rapidly in the stratosphere (lifetime of about one hour).\nThe quantum yields for production of O(lD) in the photolysis of ozone as a function of wavelength are now\nreasonably well established, but there are still conflicting laboratory results on the extent of O(3P) formation\nfrom photolysis at shorter wavelengths in the Hartley band.\nThere are conflicting reports on the identity of the primary photodissociation products of ClONO,, and further work is necessary. Also, the products of BrONO, photolysis should be determined and the UV spectra of\nFONO, and of HOBr characterized. In fact, the identity of HOBr in the gas phase is yet to be established. The\nquantum yields for photodissociation and the identity of the products in the photolysis of N,O,, CF,O and\nCFClO are yet to be determined.\n\nSUMMARY OF DATA RECOMMENDATIONS\nBasis of the Recommendations\nAs in the NASA RP-1010 report, the recommended rate constants and cross sections are based wherever possible on laboratory measurements, and in general only published data are considered. (Occasional exceptions\nare made when preprints of articles submitted for publication are available to the panel.) However, the panel\ndoes consider the question of consistency of data with expectations based on theory, and in cases where a\ndiscrepancy appears to exist, this fact is taken into account. The major use of theoretical extrapolation of\ndata is in connection with three-body reactions in which the required pressure dependences are sometimes unavailable from laboratory measurements and can be estimated by use of appropriate theoretical treatment. In\nthe case of a few important rate constants for which no experimental data are available (for example, OH +\nHOC1 - H20 + ClO), the panel has provided estimates of rate constant parameters based on analogy to\nsimilar reactions for which data are available.\n\nFormat\nThe rate constant tabulations\n\nfor second-order reactions in table l-2 give the following\n\nl\n\nReaction stoichiometry\n\nl\n\nArrhenius A-factor\n\nl\n\nTemperature dependence and associated uncertainty (activation temperature, E/R\n\nl\n\nRate constant at 298 K.\n\nl\n\nUncertainty\n\ninformation:\n\nand products (if known).\n\ndefined by the equation k = Ae\xe2\x80\x9dlRT.\n\nfactor at 298 K.\n\n+: AE/R.\n\nI\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n9\n\nRate constant recommendations which have been changed since the previous panel evaluation, JPL 79-27, or\nfor which there is other new information are indicated by an asterisk, and new entries to the table which were\nnot on the previous list are designated by a dagger. Both of these reaction types are accompanied by a note at\nthe end of the table, explaining the basis for the new evaluation. Only those reactionsfor which the recommendation has changed, or which are new entries, are annotated-the reader is requested to consult the\nprevious tabulation (JPL 79-27) to obtain the complete explanatory notes for the entries in this table.\nRate constant parameters for third-order reactions are listed in table 1-3. Where necessary for atmospheric\napplications, pressure fall-off parameters are given and may be used as previously discussed.\nPhotochemical cross sections of species of stratospheric interest are also presented in tabular form. Table l-4\nis a summary list of photochemical processes which are important in the stratosphere. Table l-5 gives recommended reliability factors for some of the more important reactions. Except as noted, these factors refer to\ntotal dissociation rate regardless of product identity. For completeness, all previous entries are reproduced in\ntables l-6 to 1-31.\n\nError Estimates\nIn the previous evaluation (NASA RP-lOlO), rate constant uncertainties were expressed in the form of A log\nk(230 K), i.e. upper and lower bounds (corresponding approximately to one standard deviation) of the rate\nconstant at 230 K could be obtained by multiplying or dividing the central value by the factor:\nf = lo@\xe2\x80\x98ogk).\nHowever, that approach had drawbacks in certain cases, particularly where the rate constant was measured\nonly at room temperature, or was known with much greater accuracy at room temperature than at other\ntemperatures. Also, that approach gave no information as to the uncertainty at other temperatures.\nIn the present report, a somewhat different method of error estimation is used. Uncertainty factors, figs, are\ngiven for the rate constant at 298 K, and these are analogous to the previous factors given at 230 K. A satisfactory estimate of the uncertainty at temperatures below 298 K may be obtained from the following expression:\n\nUnits\nThe rate constants are given in units of concentration expressed as molecules per cubic centimeter and time in\nseconds.

Notes giving the basis for\nthese recommendations may be found in this reference.\n2 Accepts the upper limit reported by Chapman and Wayne (1974).\n3 Preliminary\n\nvalue of Trevor, Chang, Barker, Chang, (private communication,\n\n1979).\n\n4 Estimated by analogy with the reaction OH + H,O,. This value is consistent with the upper limit of 3 x\nlo-lo reported by Graham, Winer, and Pitts (1978a).\n5 Value reported by Graham and Johnston (1978).\n6 Reactions of O(lD). The recommendations adopt the time-resolved O(rD) emission measurements at the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA) Laboratories for the reactions with N,O,\nH,O, CH,, H,, N,, 0,, O,, HCl, CFCl,, CF,Cl,, NH,, and CO, (Streit et al., 1976; Davidson et al.,\n1977a; and Davidson et al., 1978).\nRate constants for all the above reactions (except the reactions with HCl) have also been measured at the\nCambridge Laboratory by Heidner and Husain (1973); Heidner, Husain, and Wiesenfeld (1973); and\nFletcher and Husain (1976a, 1976b). These results were based on time resolved O(lD) resonance absorption measurements. Data analysis uses the modified Lambert-Beer law It/I, = exp( - u(nl)r) where Y =\n0.41.\nThe analysis of the latter results is less straightforward\nthan that of the time resolved emission\nmeasurements because an independent calibration of the value of \xe2\x80\x98Y is required. Additionally, the results\nfrom the NOAA Laboratories for H,O, CH,, N,, O,, O,, and CO, have been confirmed very recently by\na completely independent technique, (Amimoto et al., 1978, 1979), although in this same study, the value\nfor N,O is 40% higher than the result from the NOAA Laboratory. These same studies report significant\nquenching components in the reactions with N,O, H,O, and CH,. Further studies are needed to confirm\nthis result. New studies of O(tD) reactions with 0, and H,O have been reported by Lee and Slanger (1978\nand 1979). These values are in good agreement with the results recommended here.\nThe branching ratio for the reaction of O(lD) with N,O to give N, + 0, or Nd + NO is an average of the\nvalues reported by Davidson et al. (1979); Pirkle et al. (1977); and the very recent result of Marx et al.\n(1979). This latest result is significantly different from the earlier results. Further study is needed.\nThe branching ratio for reaction of O(lD) with CH4 to give OH + CH, or H, + CH,O is from Lin and\nDeMore (1973). The branching ratio for reaction of O(lD) with 0, to give 0, + 0, or 0, + 0 + 0 is\nfrom Davenport et al. (1974).\nFor the reactions of O(lD) with CCl,O, CFClO and CF20, rate constants are reported only by the Cambridge Laboratory by Fletcher and -Husain (1978). Thus, for consistency, the recommended values for\nthese rate constants were derived using a scaling procedure. This procedure preserves the relative placement of these rate constants among the set of Cambridge Laboratory data but employs an average ratio\n(0.50) of the NOAA to Cambridge Laboratory rate constants for those reactions studied by both groups.\nThese reactions have been studied only at 298 K. Based on consideration of similar O(lD) reactions, it is\nassumed that E/R equals zero, and therefore the value shown for the A-factor has been set equal to k(298\nK).\n\n18\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nThe chlorocarbon rate constants are for total disappearance of O(rD) and probably include physical quenching. Lower limits have been reported for the fraction of the total rate of disappearance of O(lD) proceeding through the reactive channel forming Cl0 for CFCl, (2 0.39) and CF2Clz (2 0.49) by Gillespie et\nal. (1977). It is not possible to give corresponding values for the reaction O(rD) with Ccl,0 and CFClO.\nThere are significant changes from the recommendations given in NASA RP-1010 for the values of the\nrate constants for the reactions of O(lD) with CF,Cl,, CC&O, CFCIO, and CF,O, since the studies upon\nwhich the present recommendations are based did not exist at the time of the previous evaluation. There\nare changes in the values recommended for each of the reactive channels with N,O based on new\nmeasurements of the branching ratio.\nBecause there are two disparate sets of data and that the recommendations are based primarily on one of\nthese, the error limits cited (la ) are somewhat larger than reported in the NOAA studies.\n\n7 The recommended value is derived from the upper limit of Chang and Kaufman (1978), the measurement\nof Hack et al. (1978), and the ratio measurement (relative to OH + H,O,) by Burrows et al. (1977), and is\nwithin the experimental accuracy of all three studies, although it is not compatible with the value of 1 to 2\nx lo-r0 derived from rate constant ratios in steady state 0, photolysis experiments by DeMore and\nTschuikow-Roux (1974) and DeMore (1979).\n8 This is the room temperature value of Hamilton and Lii (1977) and Cox (1978). Both studies found the\nrate constant to be sensitive to the presence of water vapor (at the millibar level). There is preliminary\nevidence in the Cox study for a very strong negative temperature dependence (E/R = - 1245 K), although\nthe data are very limited. However, there is evidence that the strong temperature dependence is not present\nat lower pressures. Thus, for the time being, E/R = 0, with a lower uncertainty bound of - 1245 K is\nrecommended. Preliminary evidence of a pressure dependence by Burrows et al. (1978) and Cox (1978),\nwould, if confirmed, require a further change in the recommendation. Recent measurements of the relevant rate-constant ratios in a study by DeMore (1979) are consistent with both the water vapor and\ntemperature effects cited by Cox.\n9 The recommendation is based on Zahniser and Howard (private communication) and Leu (1979), and the\nroom temperature determinations of Margitan and Anderson (1978) and Kaufman and Riemann (1978),\nand the ratio determination by Burrows et al. (1978) relative to OH + H,O,. The agreement is excellent.\n10 Recent rate-constant ratio measurements by DeMore (1979) are consistent with the previous recommendation for this reaction.\n11 A recent determination by Zahniser and Howard (private communication, 1979) is in excellent agreement\nwith the recommendation below room temperature. Their measured rate constants also agree very well\nwith the recommended values at higher temperatures, although their data indicates a curved Arrhenius\nplot over the entire temperature range.\n12 Recent results by Finlayson-Pitts and Kleindienst (1979) agree well with the present recommendation\nalthough their results indicate a second reaction channel to give HO, + 0 (- 25%). Confirmation is\nneeded.\n13 Harris and Pitts (1979) confirm the room temperature recommendation. However, preliminary data by\nKeyser (private communication, 1979) is about a factor of two higher. This reaction clearly requires additional work, especially on the temperature dependence.\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n19\n\n14 This revised value is based on the Arrhenius expression reported by Keyser (private communication,\n1979). The A-factor reported by Michael et al. (1977) is considerably lower than expected from theoretical\nconsiderations and may possibly be attributed to decomposition of H,O, at temperatures above 300 K.\nThe data of Michael et al. at and below 300 K are in good agreement with the Arrhenius expression\nreported by Keyser. More data are required before the Arrhenius parameters can be considered to be wellestablished.\n15 The preferred value at 298 K was obtained by taking a simple mean of the results reported by Howard et\nal. (private communication,\n1979); Birks and Leek (private communication, 1979); and Reimann and\nKaufman (1978). No recommendation is given for the temperature dependence of this reaction. Howard et\nal. have reported that the reaction exhibits nonlinear Arrhenius behavior, with the rate constant increasing\nas temperature decreases. The magnitude of the temperature dependence below 300 K is similar to that\nreported by Cox et al. (1978) for HOz + HO,.\n16 Value reported by Leu and Lin (1979). A lower limit of 0.65 was determined for k,(OH + Cl0 - HO, +\nCl) / k(OH + Cl0 - products) at 298 K. The actual value of k,/k may possibly be unity.\n17 This evaluation is based on the recent data of Kurylo (private communication,\n1979) and Kaufman\n(private communication, 1979). The results are in excellent agreement. The earlier results of Howard and\nEvanson (1976); Watson et al. (1977), Chang and Kaufman (1977), and Clyne and Holt (1979) are rejected\nin favor of the recent results. The CH,CCl, used in the early studies may have been contaminated.\n18 Value chosen to be consistent with k(C10 + HO,).\n19 Value chosen to be consistent with k(C10 + OH).\n20 The recommendation is based on the results of Washida and Bayes (1976) obtained over the temperature\nrange 259 to 341 K. This reaction is probably only important in the vicinity of the stratopause.\n21 The value for k(298 K) is the average of those reported by Plumb et al. (1979), k = (8 f 2) x lo-t2 cm3\nmolecule-Is-\xe2\x80\x98; and by Cox and Tyndall (1979), k = (6.5 k 2.0) x lo-l2 cm1 molecule-is-i. Preliminary\ndata of Sander and Watson (private communication, 1979) supports the recommendation.\n22 The room-temperature value is that of Cox and Tyndall (1979), who report (6.5 f 1.5) x lo-l2 cm3\nmolecule-Is-\xe2\x80\x98. This study also reports a large negative E/R value over the temperature range 274 to 338 K.\nThis is similar to that found by this group for HO, + HO,. This requires independent verification. No\nrecommendations for A or E/R are suggested at the present time.\n23 The recommended A-factor and E/R are those determined by Barker et al. (1977), who measured the ratio\nk(CH,O + 0-J / k(CH,O -t NO, + M) from 396 to 424 K. Recent results on this same system have been\nreported by Batt (1979). Although these new results yieid a higher A-factor and somewhat higher E/R,\nthey are consistent with the results of Barker et al. over the limited temperature range studied. The k(298\nK) value is calculated from the recommended A-factor and E/R. The factor of two uncertainty in k(298 K)\nencompasses the higher value calculated from the higher A-factor and E/R from the study of Batt. Further work over a wider temperature range is needed.\n24 The value for k(298 K) is the average of those determined by Atkinson and Pitts (1978) and Stief et al.\n(1979), both using the flash photolysis-resonance fluorescence technique. The value of (1.4 + 0.35) x\nlo-l1 cm3 molecule-is-i reported by Morris and Niki (1971) agrees within the stated uncertainty. There are\ntwo relative values which are not in agreement with the recommendations. The value of Niki et al. (1978b)\nrelative to OH + C,H, is higher (1.4 f 0.1) x lo-l1 cm3 molecule-is-i while the value of Smith (1978)\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n20\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nrelative to OH + OH is lower (6.5 x lo-r2 cm3 molecule-is-i). The latter data are also at variance with the\nnegligible temperature dependence observed in the two flash photolysis studies. Although Atkinson and\nPitts assign a small energy barrier (E/R = 90 + 150), their data at 356 K and 426 K and that of Stief et al.\nat 228 K, 257 K and 362 K are all within 10% of the k(298 K) value. Thus, the combined data set suggest\nE/R = 0. The abstraction reaction given is probably the major channel; other channels may contribute\n(Horowitz et al., 1978).\n25 The recommended values for A, E/R and k(298 K) are the averages of those determined by Klemm (1979)\nusing flash photolysis-resonance fluorescence (250 to 498 K); by Klemm et al. (1979) using discharge\nflow-resonance fluorescence (298 to 748 K); and Chang and Barker (1979) using discharge flow-mass spectrometry (296 to 437 K). All three studies are in good agreement. The k(298 K) value is also consistent with\nthe results of Niki et al. (1969), Herron and Penzhorn (1969), and Mack and Thrush (1973). Although the\nmechanism for 0 + H,CO has been considered to be the abstraction reaction yielding OH + HCO,\nChang and Barker suggest that an addition channel yielding H + HCO, may be occurring to the extent of\n30% of the total reaction. This conclusion is based on an observation of CO, as a product of the reaction\nunder conditions where reactions such as 0 + HCO - H + CO, and 0 + HCO - OH + CO apparently do not occur. This interesting suggestion needs independent confirmation.\n26 This estimate is based on an assumed similarity to OH + H202 and OH + CH,OH. The k(298 K) values\nfor these two reactions are reported to be very similar: k(OH + H202) = 8.1 x lo-l3 cm3 molecu!es-\xe2\x80\x98s-t\n(this evaluation) and k(OH + CH,OH) = 9.5 x lo-l3 molecule-\xe2\x80\x98s-l (Campbell et al., 1976). In the absence\nof temperature-dependent data for OH + CH,OH, the A-factor and E/R values are assumed to be the\nsame as those for OH + H,O,. The latter values are somewhat uncertain at present. The reaction products are not specified since, using the above analogies to CH,OH and H202, abstraction of H from either\nend of the molecule may be equally probable.\n27 This recommendation accepts the recent determination by Singleton et al. (1979). The uncertainty factor\nin k(298 K) was chosen to encompass the values of k(298 K) determined by Hollinden et al. (1970);\nWhytock et al. (1976); and Slagle et al. (1978). The E/R value is that of the Singleton study as confirmed\nby the higher temperature data of Whytock et al., and the measurements of Slagle et al. It should be emphasized that the Singleton determination did not extend below 298 K. The only existing data below 298 K\nappear to indicate a dramatic change in E/R in this temperature region. Thus A E/R was set to account for\nthese observations. Such a nonlinearity in the Arrhenius plot might indicate a change in reaction\nmechanism from abstraction (as written) to addition. An addition channel has been proposed for 0 +\nH2S by Slagle et al. (1978) as well as by Singleton et al., and addition products from this reaction have\nbeen seen in a matrix (Smardzewski and Lin, 1977). Further kinetic study is recommended in the 200 to\n300 K range. Direct mechanistic information is needed.\n28 The uncertainty factor in k(298 K) has been increased to reflect the complexity of the kinetic analysis used\nto derive k(298 K). This increase does not permit overlap of k(298 K) from both literature studies. Further\nstudy is still needed to establish the validity of the interpretation upon which the present recommendation\nis based. Measurements at both the temperature dependence of k and the mechanism of the reaction are\nessential. If suggestions regarding a possible addition mechanism are correct, the reaction may have a\nnegative temperature dependence.\n29 Corrected for typographical\n\nerrors in JPL 79-27.\n\n30 Rate constant given in JPL 79-27 has been lowered by a factor of two to be consistent with our definition\n- d[radical]/dt\n= 2k[radical12.\n\n21\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\nTable 1-3\nRate Constants for Third Order Reactions\nThe Values Quoted are Suitable for Air as Third Body, M\nHigh PressureLhnil\n300\nk,(T) = k,\n(T/300)-\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLow PressureLimit\nkc,(T) = kT\xe2\x80\x99(T/300)300\n\nReaction\n\nCH, \xe2\x80\xa2t 0, M, CH,O,\n0 + 0, Y 0,\n\n(2.1 f 0.4)(-31)\n(2.6 f 0.3) (-30)\n( I .6 f 0.2) (-3 I )\n(3.5 k I .7) (-32)\n(2.2 + l.l)(-31)\n(6.2 f 0.9) (-34)\n\nO(\xe2\x80\x98D)+Nz\n\n(3.5 _+\n3.0) (-37)\n\nM, N,O\n\nCl f NO M, GINO\nCl + NO, M, GINO,\n(CIONO)\n\n(9.0 f 2.0) (-32)\n(1.6 f 1.O) (-30)\n\nCl + 0, M, Cl00\n\n2.0 f 0.5\n3.45 f 2.0\n- .45\n1.8 f 0.5\n1.9 + I .o\n\n(5.5 + 0.5) (-32)\n\nm\n\nL\n\n5.0 f 2.0\n2.9 f 0.7\n3.4 f 0.3\n3.8 + I .O\n2.2 f 1.0\n\n(2.0 + I .O) (-33)\n\nH + 0, M, HO,\nOH + NO M, HONO\n\n300\n\nII\n\nic0\n\nHO, + NO, M, HO,NO,\nOH+NO 2 M, HN03\nCl0 \xe2\x80\xa2t NO, M, CIONO\n(Two recornmendation2)\n\nI1\n\n-I-\n\n1.3 + 2.0\n- 1.3\nI .4 + 0.5\n3.3 I!

(1978) and by Kajimoto and Cvetanovic (1979). The results of Fairchild\net al. (1978) as well as those of Sparks et al.

These are\nthe values which were recommended in the original report (NASA RP-1010). The second evaluation (JPL\n79-29) recommended instead the results of Wayne et al. (1978), but these later results have now been\nwithdrawn. However, Wayne (private communication, 1978) has now an absolute NO, cross section measurement at 662 nm which indicates that Graham and Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (1978) values should be multiplied by approximately 0.7.

(1978b) and Cox and Patrick\n(1979). Only the former reports cross section values in the critical wavelength region for atmospheric\nphotodissociation beyond 290 nm. The results of Graham et al., which provide the basis of this recommendation, are listed in table l-14. The two sets of results are in reasonable agreement between 205 and 260 nm, but\nat 195 nm the cross-section value obtained by Graham et al. is more than twice the value reported by Cox and\nPatrick. Additional studies of the HO,NO, spectrum would be desirable.\nH&O\n\n+ hv - H + HCO (4r) and H, + CO(&)\n\nMoortgat and Warneck (1979) have reinvestigated the photolysis of H,CO.

Photo-decomposition accounts for at most two or three percent of the total destruction rate of Cl0 in\nthe stratosphere (see JPL publication 79-27), which occurs predominantly by reaction with oxygen atoms and\nnitric oxide.\nHF+hv-H+F\nThe ultraviolet absorption spectrum of HF has been studied by Safary et al.

(1979) have recently measured absorption cross sections of HOC1 using essentially the same\ntechnique as Molina and Molina (1978) except for a higher temperature, which allowed them to obtain a more\naccurate value for the equilibrium constant K,, for the H,O - Cl,0 - HOC1 system. The cross section\nvalues from Molina and Molina\xe2\x80\x99s measurements, recalculated using the new K,, are in excellent agreement\nwith the results of Knauth et al. The recommended values, taken from this later work, are presented in table\nl-17.\nMolina et al. (1979a), by monitoring directly OH radicals produced by laser photolysis of HOCl, obtain an\ncm2 around 310 nm, again in excellent agreement with the data\nabsorption cross section value of -6 x 10m20\nof Knauth et al. (1979). In contrast, the theoretical predictions of Jaffe and Langhoff (1978) indicate negligible absorption at those wavelengths. The reason is not known, although it should be pointed out that no\nprecedent exists to validate the theoretical approach for this particular type of problem.\nHCIO,\n\n+ hv - products\n\nThe UV spectrum of HClO, has been studied by Molina et al.

For\nthese areas, the purpose is to refer to current reviews and compilations as sources of data and to indicate the\nkinds of measurements that are still needed.\n\nHETEROGENEOUS PHENOMENA\nIntroduction\nA relatively persistent aerosol layer is known to exist in the stratosphere over the altitude range extending\nfrom approximately 17 to 40 km. This layer is characterized by wide variations in number density with\nlongitude and latitude and often displays stratification with altitude. See reviews by Castleman (1974) and\nFarlow et al. (1979), and Chapter 3 of this report.\nLaboratory work is needed to elucidate the processes leading to aerosol formation, to describe the interactions of aerosols and ions, and to define the extent that aerosol surfaces may catalyze reactions involving\nstratospheric trace species. Unlike the situation existing in the field of homogeneous chemistry, heterogeneous\nchemistry is a developing science where interpretation of results in often difficult even under well-controlled\nlaboratory conditions. Much of our current understanding of these processes is based on theoretical considerations.\n\nFormation Process\nStratospheric aerosols appear to be generated in situ via the reactions of sulfur bearing gases, possibly from\nSO, and/or COS. The initial phase of new particle formation involves the interaction of numerous precursors\nuntil a critical size is reached. This involves tens of elementary reaction steps which are not well identified and\nare difficult to quantify, even in the laboratory. This \xe2\x80\x9cprenucleation critical size embryo\xe2\x80\x9d may then be\nenlarged by heteromolecular processes, involving more than one gaseous species participating in the formation of the particle.\nLittle is known about the generation of the prenucleation embryos subsequent to the primary steps whereby\nthe sulfur compounds are oxidized. In the case of SO,, it is likely that it will react with H20 to form an H20\nSO, adduct, followed by rearrangement to H,SO, (Holland and Castleman, 1978; Castleman et al., 1975).\nWhere HSO, is oxidized to HSO, via OH, the further addition of 0, leading to the formation of HSO, is a\nplausible step; subsequent clustering with H,O may perhaps lead to aerosol formation as suggested by Davis\net al. (1979). Friend and Vosta have presented some circumstantial evidence to suggest that hydrated free\nradical species may be important in aerosol formation. In the case of the nitrosyl compounds which have been\ntentatively identified as components of the stratospheric aerosol layer, even less is known about their formation mechanisms; reactions involving NO,, SO,, SO,, and H,O have been invoked to explain field observations (Farlow et al., 1978). Clearly there is an urgent need for laboratory studies in this area.\nl\n\nThe initial phase of formation has been theoretically described in terms of individual cluster species forming a\nliquid drop (Zettlemoyer, 1969; Mason, 1961; Heicklen, 1976); however, there is conflicting evidence as to the\n\n44\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nvalidity of this liquid drop formalism (Heicklen, 1976; Castleman, 1979a, Zettlemoyer, 1977). Recent experimental work using high pressure mass spectrometer-y (Castleman, 1979), the expansion of proton hydrates\nin beams composed of water vapor (Searcy and Fenn, 1974; Burke, 1978), and neutral clusters indicate that\nthe small clusters may be relatively ordered, not disordered as assumed in liquid drop theory. Nevertheless\nsuch theories have been useful in estimating conditions under which stratospheric aerosols might form and\ngrow (Hamill et al., 1977b and references therein), and have suggested the likelihood of the incorporation of\nsome HNO, into the primary aerosol particles (Kiang et al., 1975).\nA second mechanism for initiating new particle formation has been proposed by Ferguson, private communication, (1977). As a result of a change in the effective ionization potentials and electron affinities of\ncluster species involving positive and negative ions, in principle, a size range can be reached where the particles would not be neutralized upon collision, but would lead to the formation of a small electrolytic droplet\nconstituting a new condensed phase and could grow by further condensation. There is an experimental observation of Fe+ and FeOH + and their hydrates associated with noctilucent clouds near the mesopause\n(Goldberg and Witt, 1977).\nIt is clear that in order to adequately formulate a theory for heteromolecular nucleation in particular, and to\ngain more insight into the entire field of aerosol formation, more attention must be paid to the structure of\nsmall clusters, the influence of these structures on the energy barrier, and the kinetics of clustering reactions.\nPromising theoretical approaches to nucleation can be expected to be based on molecular dynamic and Monte\nCarlo techniques since these methods offer the possibility of describing the molecular properties of small\nclusters and taking into account the many configurations possible as the clusters develop and grow.\nIn addition to changes resulting from continual condensation of vapor, particle sizes may also be altered by\nthe coagulation of discrete entities of the condensed phase. The problem has been formulated by Chandrasekhar (1943) for the general case where size distribution is evolving as a result of random collisions among\nparticles. Under some conditions, the collision kernel is directly related to the Boltzmann constant, gas\nviscosity, and absolute temperature (Hidy and Brock, 1971). Friedlander and co-workers (1966) show that,\nalthough number concentration and hence mean particle size vary during coagulation, the shape distribution\nis time independent, leading to the concept of a self-preserving aerosol size distribution. Even if aerosols are\ninitially produced with a nearly uniform particle size, Lindauer and Castleman (1971) have shown that a\npolydispersed size distribution approaching a log-normal form will ultimately develop.\n\nEffects of Aerosols\nPotentially important chemical and physical effects include charge exchange between ions and aerosols, the\nproduction of trace species, and surface catalysis. It is of interest to note the total surface area of\nstratospheric aerosols is estimated to be 0.4 x 106 km2 and that a given gas phase molecule suffers a collision\nwith a stratospheric aerosol surface about every 104 seconds (Castleman et al., 1975a).\nThe effect of aerosols on stratospheric ion densities is expected to be small. Keefe et al. (1959) show that to a\ngood approximation aerosols maintain a Boltzmann charge distribution. Under stratospheric conditions, with\nabout ld ion pairs/cm3 it appears that ion destruction due to charge exchange processes involving aerosols is\nabout a factor of 10 less than destruction due to ion recombination, except when the aerosol concentration is\nincreased following periods of intense volcanic activity.\nThere is one situation where stratospheric aerosols have been thought to play a role in the production of trace\nspecies, namely the production of HCl from the interaction of H,SO, with NaCl (Castleman et al., 1975b).\nCalculations show that the reaction is exothermic and the quantity of HCl so produced is likely to be limited\n\nLABORATORY\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\n45\n\nby the quantity of NaCl, potentially from sea salt, which may be deposited in the stratosphere following major storms in equatorial regions. However, the kinetics of the reactions are not known under the low\ntemperature conditions prevailing in the stratosphere and laboratory studies of this reaction are needed.\nThere are three possible ways in which aerosol surfaces may play a role in affecting the gas phase concentration of chemically reactive species. These include the destruction of reactive intermediates such as free\nradicals which would be normally important in gas phase reactions, a catalytic influence on reactions between\nstable gas phase constituents, and the stabilization of a product molecule in the condensed state which might\notherwise readily dissociate in the gas phase.\nQuantitatively, very little is known about catalytic reaction mechanisms or rates which might be important in\nthe upper atmosphere. Therefore, in order to assess which ones warrant attention, model calculations were\nmade where it was assumed that one species is absorbed and others react with it upon each collision\n(Castleman et al., 1975a). By comparing these rates to known homogeneous ones involving the same species,\na crude prediction was made regarding what species might have potentially important surface controlled\nchemistry. Admittedly this does not provide an unequivocal assessment of the importance, or lack thereof for\nthe species under consideration, but it gives a way of screening and establishing priorities for laboratory investigation. Table 1-32 is a list of reactants, possible products, and an estimate of the maximum possible ratio\nof heterogeneous to homogeneous rates.\n\nTable 1-32\nComparison of Surface and Gas-PhaseReaction Rates*\n\nReactants\n\nRatio,\nSurface to Gas-Phase\nReaction Rate\n\nProducts\n\n2 HNOa\n\n>103\n\nNOs,Oz\nCHa 0, NO2\n\n-10\n-1\n\n2 02\n\n200\n-10\n\nNO2 702\nOH*, O2\nHO2\n\n5.3 x 10-2\n1 x 10-a\n\n-302\n\nCH2 O., HO,,\n\nl\n\n1.6 X lo-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nClO*, 02\n\n1 x 10-e\n\n03\n\n2.5 x 1o-7\n\nCH3 O2 *\n\n5.8 X lo-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHO2\n\n1 .7 x 1o-10\n\nl\n\n*Maximum surface reaction rate based on kinetic theory\nfor collision rates, and assuming unit reaction probability\nupon collision.\n\n46\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nMuch of the stratospheric aerosol is believed to be composed of H,SO, which is characteristically noncatalytic for many systems. Yet, since sulfuric acid aerosols contain H,O, reaction with N,O, might be important and deserves attention in this context. Olzyna et al. (1979) have shown that ozone destruction is not important on sulfuric acid surfaces. Therefore, this marginally important case may be omitted from further consideration unless substantial metallic oxide aerosols are found; in which case, they may play a small role.\nFerguson (1978) suggests the possible importance of ozone reactions with metal atoms which might be a\nsource of oxide aerosols.\nAs far as the possible importance of surface reactions is concerned, three other contenders are: the reaction of\nCl0 with H,SO,/H,O\nto produce HCl (Martin et al., 1978); CIONO, with H,O giving rise to HOC1 (Birks,\nprivate communication, 1979); and sulfur dioxide with H,O,. Based on laboratory measurements, there is\nsome evidence that the first occurs to a small extent. Estimates by Martin et al. (1978) suggest that the inclusion of this reaction in models could decrease by a few percent the estimated Cl/HCl ratios existing in the\nstratosphere. Laboratory studies are needed to assess the importance of surface reactions of H,O, (Cadle et\nal., 1975).\nFinally, a consideration of the potential importance of stratospheric heterogeneous reactions on the behavior\nof the fluorocarbons has failed to provide any evidence in support of such 2 mechanism. Ausloos et al. (1977)\nhave demonstrated that unexpectedly large surface photochemical effects can result on certain surfaces,\nnotably certain sands, leading to the destruction of some fluorocarbon\ncompounds and N,O. The\nmechanisms and significance of these catalytic processes are not well known, but even if they do occur, the\nquantity of potentially active surface material is far too low to be of importance in the stratosphere.\n\nATMOSPHERIC ION CHEMISTRY\nIntroduction\nOver the past decade, considerable progress has been made toward a quantitative understanding of the ion\nchemistry of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. The present status has recently been reviewed in detail by Ferguson\n(1979a) and Ferguson et al. (1979). Laboratory techniques are presently available to provide the kinetic data\nrequired to model atmospheric ion chemistry and many, if not most, of the critical reaction rate constants\nhave been determined. A compilation and critical evaluation of these results has been provided by Ferguson\n(1973) and, in addition, the ion-neutral reactions measured in flow-tube reactors through 1977 have been\ncompiled by Albritton (1978). For the most part, the laboratory techniques used for these determinations can\nbe considered standard, with the most notable new development in the techniques used to study low-energy\nion reactions of atmospheric interest being the selected-ion flow tube of Adams and Smith (1976).\nIn general, there is good agreement between laboratory measurements. The previous disagreement concerning\nbinary ion-ion recombination coefficients now seems to be resolved in favor of the somewhat lower values\nmeasured by Smith et al. (1978). Perhaps the two most notable disagreements are those involving the heat of\nformation of CO, (see Moseley et al., 1976; and Dotan et al., 1977) and the dissociative recombination ?f\nNO+ (see Torr and Torr, 1978). It should be noted that these disagreements are small and do not involve options that significantly alter the ion reaction schemes that have been devised for the atmosphere. Rather, their\nsignificance lies in the detailed understanding of the systematic differences that can exist between the interpreted results of diverse experimental techniques.\nThe degree to which the directly measured atmospheric ion compositions can be predicted by models using\nlaboratory results is, at present, the most important gauge of the completeness of the chemical reaction\nschemes, and the correctness of the laboratory measurements of the relevant rate constant data. The current\nstatus of this comparison for the mesosphere and stratosphere is reviewed in the following sections.\n\n47\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\nMesospheric Positive-Ion Chemistry\nNumerous in situ measurements of the D-region positive-ion composition (see e.g. Goldberg and Aiken, 1971;\nNarcisi et al., 1972; Arnold and Krankowsky, 1974; Zbinden et al., 1975) have indicated that the dominant\nnHzO, in the D-region.\nions of the E-region O,+ and NO+, are replaced by the water cluster ions, H,O+\nThe reaction scheme that has been devised to explain this conversion is shown in figure l-2. The conversion of\nNO + to the hydronium ions by this scheme has been modeled by Reid (1977), and the association-reaction sequence seems to offer an adequately efficient mechanism. Certain of the thermochemical values assumed by\nReid (1977) have been confirmed by later laboratory measurements (Turner and Conway, 1976; Johnsen et\nal., 1975; and Fehsenfeld and Albritton, 1979). In addition, some of the key ions in this reaction sequence\nhave been observed in situ (Arnold and Krankowsky, 1974).\nl\n\nBecause the reactions that convert NO+ to H,O + nHzO involve very weakly bound cluster ions of NO+ as\nintermediaries, this conversion is extremely sensitive to temperature. The D-region positive-ion composition is\nexpected to manifest strong seasonal, latitudinal, and even irregular variations as a result of variations in atmospheric temperature. Moreover, electron-ion recombination coefficients for these weakly bound ions, thus\nfar unmeasured in the laboratory, may be considerably larger than those for the unclustered NO+ and O,+\nions. This may explain, at least in part, the strong variations in the electron density that are observed at about\n80 km (Arnold and Krankowsky, 1977; Reid, 1977).\nl\n\nMesospheric Negative-Ion Chemistry\nThe D-region negative-ion chemistry has been derived predominantly from laboratory studies. This is in contrast to the positive-ion chemistry, which was deduced to explain the in situ measurements. The negative-ion\nchemistry is shown in figure l-3. This chemistry is initiated by the attachment of electrons to 0, to form 0,.\nThe relatively unstable 0, ions undergo a series of ion-molecule reactions with the D-region minor molecular\nneutral constituents to form progressively more stable ions. In competition with this progression, reactions involving minor neutral constituents, principally atomic oxygen, lead back to the release of the electrons. Eventually, the sequence of reactions lead to terminal ions, e.g. NO; and HCOY , which are sufficiently stable to\nresist attack by the atomic species.\nThe rate limiting step in the production of the terminal negative ions, and thus in the loss of electrons by attachment, is the conversion of CO; to NOT by reaction with NO. This is due to the small rate constant for\nthe reaction and the low concentration of nitric oxide. As a consequence, the ion chemistry of figure l-3\npredicts a low negative-ion concentration in the D-region, depending strongly on the concentration of minor\nneutral species such as 0, 0,, NO, and H.\nFigure l-3 does not include the effects of molecules clustering to the negative ions. At the relatively low\nD-region temperatures, all of the negative ions are subject to clustering to the atmospheric neutral molecules\nN,, 0, and CO,. Clustering of these molecules to CO, may somewhat alleviate the CO; bottleneck if it inhibits the reaction of CO, with 0 relative to that with NO. With the improved ability to study individual\ncluster ions that now exist, more extensive studies of the effects of clustering on chemical reactivity are being\nundertaken.\nThe first in situ measurements of the D-region negative-ion composition were made by Narcisi et al. (1971)\nand Arnold et al. (1971). There are sizable differences between these results, as well as areas of disagreement\nbetween these profiles and that predicted from the ion chemistry. Narcisi and co-workers observe ions that\ncorrespond to NO, . nH20 (n = 1 to 5) as the dominant negative ion below 90 km, which is in accord with\nthe predictions drawn from the laboratory-derived chemical schemes. However, ions identified as O- and\nOt were observed above 90 km, which is not in accord with the chemical scheme outlined in figure l-3. On the\nother hand, Arnold and co-workers found a rather sharp upper boundary to the D-region negative ions,\nwhich is in accord with predictions, but they identified the dominant masses as CO;, Cl-, and HCOT , with\nthe NO,\nnHzO sequence not observed.\nl\n\n48\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nNO\nN\n\nH20\n\n1\n\n1\nH,O+\n\nH20\n\n-HzOtH,O\n\nI\nH20\n\n- H,0t2H,0\n4\n\nL\n\nNO+\nL\n\nI\n1\n\nH2O\n\nt\nH20\n\n4\n(332\n\nH20\n\n- NO+-Hz0\nI\n\xe2\x80\x99 co2\nt\nI!\n\n_\n\nH20\n\n-NOt2H,O\n- NOt3H,O\nb\nI I\nt\nI IC02\nt\n\nFigure 1-2.

Galactic cosmic rays are the\nprimary source of ionization in the stratosphere. An ion production rate of 10 ion pairs cmJsl is fairly typical\n(Cole and Pierce, 1965). The ambient concentration of positive ions is determined by the recombination rate\nwith negative ions and yields a concentration of about 5 x lo3 cmJ (Cole and Pierce, 1965; Paltridge, 1965,\n1966).\nIn the ion chemistry the conversion of the primary ions N,+ and O,+ to the hydronium ions, H,O+ . nHzO,\nis quite efficient and there seems to be no alternative to their production in the stratosphere. The H,O+\nnHzO ions are observed to be the dominant ions above 40 km in the stratosphere (Arnold et al., 1977). Below\n40 km other ions are observed to become the dominant ions (Arnold et al., 1977; Arijs et al., 1978; Arnold et\nal., 1978). These non-hydronium ions have recently been interpreted (Ferguson, 1978; and Liu and Reid,\n1979) as being protonated sodium hydroxide ions. Sodium is produced by meteor ablation near 90 km. It is\nargued that this sodium will settle through the stratosphere and be incorporated as NaOH below 40 km. The\nexceedingly large proton affinity of NaOH (Kebarle, 1977) ensures that the reaction with H,O+\nnH20 is\nhighly exothermic and likely to occur with nearly unit efficiency.\nl\n\nl\n\nStratospheric Negative-Ion Chemistry\nThe negative-ion reaction scheme as deduced from laboratory measurements is indicated in figure l-5. The\nshaded boxes and dashed lines represent points of considerable uncertainty, which is associated with the increasing importance of three-body association reactions to form cluster ions. Although the presence of these\ncluster ions make the exact reaction paths uncertain, there is little question that these paths will lead eventually through NO;. Both HNO, and N,O, provide effective NO, production routes (Fehsenfeld et al., 1975;\nDavidson et al., 1977b). It has been shown that HNO, exothermically displaces H,O in hydrated negative ions\n(Fehsenfeld et al., 1975); therefore, the agent of NOS formation can enter the cluster.\nNO; is not considered the terminal ion of the stratospheric negative-ion chemistry. It has recently been found\n(Viggiano et al., 1979) that NO,\nnHN03, n = 0, 1, 2, reacts rapidly with H,SO,. Consequently, this neutral\nspecies is capable of establishing HSOi as the terminal stratospheric negative ion. That this does occur in the\nstratosphere is indicated from the first mass sampling of stratospheric negative ions (Arnold and Henschen,\n1978). In this balloon-borne mass-spectrometric measurement, ions identifiable as HSOi . HNO,; HSOi\nH,SO,, HSO,\n2HN03; HSO, . H,SO, . HNO,; HSO; .3HNO,; and HSO, .2H,SO, were observed.\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nSummary\nAs a more comprehensive understanding of the ion chemistry is achieved, the measured ion composition can\nbe used to obtain information concerning the neutral composition of the stratosphere and mesosphere. In this\ncontext, Arnold and Krankowsky (1977) have determined the mesospheric water vapor concentration from\ntheir D-region positive-ion composition measurements. In the same fashion, the stratospheric positive ion\ncomposition (Arnold et al., 1978; Arijs et al., 1978) has been used to establish a lower limit on the\nstratospheric concentration of NaOH (Ferguson, 1978) and an upper limit for CH,OH (Fehsenfeld et al.,\n1978). Furthermore, the stratospheric negative-ion composition observed by Arnold and Henschen (1978) has\nbeen used to set a rather precise value for the stratospheric H,SO, concentration (Viggiano et al., 1979). The\npotential utility of the stratospheric and tropospheric ion composition measurements as sensitive probes of atmospheric composition is quite apparent.\nOne area in which ion chemistry has arisen from time to time as a potentially significant atmospheric factor is\nas a source or sink of atmospheric neutrals. Ion reactions have been proposed as a sink for ozone in the\n\nLABORATORY\n\n51\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\n4\n2+\n\nN2\n\n02\n\n0:\n\nCosmic\n\nRays\n\n02\n\n02+lbl\n\n03\n\n0$02\n\nt\n050,\n\nH20\n\n05\n\nH,O\n\nI\n\n-\n\nH20\n\nI\n,\n\nN205\n\nI\xe2\x80\x9d;\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n*\n\nH:O+ 1\n\nt\n\niH30;OH\n\nH20+M\n\nt\n\nNO;l H20\n\nH20\n\ni\n\n1\n\n= H,NO;\n\n-\n\n]\n\nH30+# H20\n\nH20+M\nNO;\n\nl\n\n2H20\n\n= H,NO;*\n\nH20\nM\n\nH,O\n\nH20+M\n\nCH30H\n\nCH,OHG\n\nl\n\nn H,O *\n\nH30hH20\nNaOH\nNa 0 Hi-nNaOH*mHzO\n\nFigure 1-4.

In these cases, however, the reactivity of atmospheric ions with these species is not sufficient to provide an efficient removal mechanism (Fehsenfeld et\nal., 1976a; Fehsenfeld et al., 1976b; Fehsenfeld and Albritton, 1977).

Except for the\natoms and the hydrogen molecule, these species have active infrared absorption bands, and infrared instruments of various types can be employed to detect and quantitatively measure the abundance of many of\nthem.\nAccurate spectral data are of critical importance to the utilization of infrared techniques for remote, quantitative measurements of stratospheric species. The ability of the infrared techniques to accomplish highly accurate, remote measurements with adequate spatial and temporal resolution and coverage justifies the investment in relevant infrared spectroscopy.\n\nCurrently Available Data\nThe infrared spectrum of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere is dominated by numerous spectral features due to the more\ncommon gases: H,O, CO,, CH,, CO, N,O, 0, and 0,. An extensive compilation of infrared spectral data for\nthese molecules was compiled several years ago by McClatchey et al. (1973), at the Air Force Cambridge\nResearch Laboratory, and a recent update of this compilation has been described by Rothman (1978). The updated data primarily concern certain parameters for H,O, CO,, CH,, and includes an extension to shorter infrared wavelengths, where numerous 0, lines exist. The compilation includes the following data for each\nmolecule and its isotopes: line center frequency, line strength, air-broadened linewidth, lower state energy,\nand quantum identification of the transition. Lines whose strengths fall below a certain cutoff value are excluded. Recently, an initial compilation of spectral parameters for other trace gases has been assembled,\nunder the sponsorship of the Air Force Geophysical Laboratory (Rothman et al., 1978). The new molecules\ninclude NO, SO,, NO,, and NH,.\nThe compilations of spectral parameters just mentioned are extremely valuable for unraveling the meaning of\nan atmospheric spectrum in the infrared, for assessing which spectral regions are most desirable for detecting\nthe existence of other trace gases in the atmosphere, and for accurately calculating the contributions of the\nvarious infrared-active molecules to the so-called greenhouse effect. However, much of the spectral data can\nonly be considered approximate, even for the more common trace gases listed in these compilations. This is\nespecially true of the line broadening parameters. Certain overtone and combination bands of these gases are\nnot represented in the compilations, even though they are observable in long-path stratospheric spectra and\nrequire identification. However, the compilations are always useful, even if only as a first approximation in\nsome cases, and the organizers involved in the compilations update their material when new data becomes\navailable. The continuation of this program is important.\n\n-Spectral Requirements\nUntil recently, no large effort has existed in the application of high-resolution infrared measurement techniques to the understanding of stratospheric photochemistry. Thus, it is not surprising that the data for most\nof the constituents of interest are not in any of the major atmospheric absorption compilations. However, a\ngreat deal of these data do now exist at various institutions-data\nwhich can be used at least for identification\n\nII 11111 I I\n\nI I111111 11111111 I\nIII\n\nI\n\nII II I\n\n54\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE\n\n: PRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nof these species. Data which can be used to obtain a measurement with 20% accuracy or better at\nstratospheric temperature are yet to be obtained for many of these species (e.g., ClONO,, CH,CCl,, HO,,\nCFCl,) .\nAs needs arise for measurements of trace molecules which are not on this list, it is almost always the case that\na laboratory spectroscopic study must be undertaken to produce the data of necessary accuracy to be useful in\na stratospheric measurement.\nAt this point it is useful to insert a few remarks on molecular parameters to help point out the spectral data\nand infrared instrumentation requirements for optimum measurement capability. Radiation at frequency v\npassing through the atmosphere is absorbed according to the expression\nI = I, exp [ - LY(v,z)],\n\n(7)\n\nwhere (Y(v,z) is the absorption coefficient at frequency v and position z along the path. If the absorption is due\nto a single nearby absorption line, (Y(v,z) can be expressed as\nQ(V,Z) = N(Z) S(T) f (v -v \xe2\x80\x98,p) ,\nWhere N(Z) is the number density of absorber molecules at position Z, S(T) is the line strength, and f(v -v \xe2\x80\x98,p)\nis the line shape function for the absorber at pressure p and temperature T. The strength of the line centered at\nfrequency v \xe2\x80\x98, is\nS = (v \xe2\x80\x98/v,) S; L g [exp (-E\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c/kT)]\n\n[(l - exp( - v/kT]) F/Q,\n\nwhere v0 is the molecule\xe2\x80\x99s vibration-rotation\nband center, SF is the band strength at temperature T, L is the\n\xe2\x80\x9crigid rotor\xe2\x80\x9d rotational transition probability, g and E are the statistical weight and the energy of the lower\nenergy level, respectively, k is Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s constant, Q, is the rotational partition function (which is a function of T), and F is a factor which accounts for vibration-rotation\ninteractions.\nThe absorption line shape is influenced by collision broadening and Doppler effects. The Doppler half-width\nis proportional to the transition frequency, and to (T/M)\xe2\x80\x98j2,\nwhere T is the temperature and M is the\nmolecular absorber\xe2\x80\x99s mass. If the absorption line width is dominated by collision broadening, then\nf(v -v \xe2\x80\x98,p) assume a Lorentz shape. The half-width in this case is proportional to P/(T)\xe2\x80\x9c~ in most cases. At\nstratospheric altitudes, the pressure is low enough such that Doppler broadening becomes important, and the\naltitude at which this occurs depends on the absorption-line frequency, and on the molecular mass and\ntemperature. Doppler broadening is important at all stratospheric altitudes for, e.g., HF, HCl, CH,, and\nH20 lines in the 3000 cm-\xe2\x80\x99 region and at higher frequencies. In this case, the Doppler limiting linewidths are\nalmost 0.01 cm-r for the light molecules. In the 1000 cm-l region (where many of the heavier molecules have\nabsorption bands), Doppler limiting linewidths are much smaller, e.g., 0.001 cm-l. These linewidths are\ntypical at altitudes above 30 km in the stratosphere.\n\nIf possible, laboratory spectroscopic measurements should be carried out with high spectral resolution instruments capable of resolving the absorption lines under Doppler limited conditions. The infrared instruments used for measurements should also have high spectral resolution, for the optimum performance (in\nterms of sensitivity and selectivity) is obtained when the spectral resolution matches the linewidths. In some\ncases where heavier molecules are involved, the density of lines within a band is so large that the lines are\nblended even under Doppler-limited conditions. This produces a band which does not ordinarily have spectral\nfeatures as sharp as Doppler-limited linewidths, which implies that instruments with lower spectral resolution\nmay be just as effective in detection and measurement of these species.\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n55\n\nCurrent Capabilities\nA great deal of spectral information\n\nfor various trace species is now being generated by various groups with\nFourier Transform infrared spectrometers (FTIR) whose spectral resolutions are between 0.01 cm-t and 0.05\ncm-l, and by a smaller number of groups with tunable diode lasers (which can yield 0.001 cm-l spectra). The\nFTIR instruments produce high-quality spectra over large spectral regions. This data is adequate for several\nexisting infrared measurement instruments which have comparable resolution. (See, for example, Murcray,\n1978.) For application to measurement programs in which higher resolution instruments are used (e.g., laser\nheterodyne radiometers, with resolution of about 0.001 cm-l), this data is useful for determining optimum\nwavelength regions for measurement of a specific trace species. Further spectroscopic measurements with\nhigher spectral resolution are required. This can be accomplished with various lead salt diode laser systems, or\nwith a combination of diode and discretely tunable gas lasers. (Many gas laser frequencies are known with extremely high accuracy, and these can be used as benchmarks.) This type of work was recently done for the\nchlorine monoxide (CIO) fundamental near 845 cm-\xe2\x80\x99 (Margolis et al., 1978; Rogowski et al., 1978); and for\nthe 2vg band of nitric acid (HNO,) near 890 cm-t (Brockman et al., 1977); and is presently being carried out\nfor the H,O, band near 1350 cm-t (Hillman private communication, 1978), and for the CIONO, v3 and v4\nbands near 800 cm-r. Work is ongoing with these types of instruments and techniques at several institutions,\nwith plans to produce accurate, high resolution spectra for each of the species of interest (with the exception\nof 0, and Hz) for which the data is incomplete or of unacceptable quality for the stratospheric measurements\napplication.\n\nMuch of the spectral data which now exists for stratospheric trace species is applicable only to a narrow set of\nmeasurement conditions. Further analyses of these and additional laboratory spectra are required to generate\nthe kind of data which can be inserted into compilations for eventual use by a large community of workers.\nAlthough this often requires additional manpower and funding, the potential benefits of this investment are\nconsiderable.\n\nULTRAVIOLET\n\nFLUXES AND CROSS SECTIONS\n\nThe primary influence of the Sun in the middle atmosphere is due to the ultraviolet fluxes absorbed by\nmolecular oxygen and ozone. Nearly all radiation of wavelengths less than 100 nm is absorbed by nitrogen\nand oxygen in the thermosphere and is, therefore, not considered here. The X-rays of wavelengths of less than\n1 nm and energetic particle radiations can penetrate into the atmosphere below 100 km and are considered in\nChapter 4.\n\nOverview\nThe radiation of wavelengths less than 242 nm is absorbed by molecular oxygen and leads to its\nphotodissociation. The principal photodissociation continuum (Schumann-Runge continuum) at 1<175nm\nresults in a complete absorption of the solar radiation in the thermosphere. However, an important solar line,\nLyman-u at 121.6 nm, situated in a so-called atmospheric window where the 0, absorption cross section is only of the order of 10m20\ncm2, is absorbed in the mesosphere.\nThe second important spectral range for molecular oxygen, between 200 nm and 175 nm, is related to the 0,\nSchumann-Runge band system which includes 18 bands, (2-O) to (19-O), subject to the predissociation process.\nIn this spectral region, the mean absorption cross sections are a function of the temperature and number of\n0, absorbing molecules. This absorption, which is essentially a mesospheric process, also plays a role in\nvarious stratospheric photodissociations.\nFrom 200 to 242 nm, the 0, absorption, which is related to the Herzberg continuum with low absorption\ncross section (from 1O-24to 1O-23cm2) occurs in the stratosphere. In addition, the ozone absorption must be\n\n56\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nintroduced since this spectral region belongs to the spectral range of the 0, Hartley band. In the mesosphere,\nthe 0, absorption is practically negligible since the total number of ozone molecules is very small even for low\nsolar zenith angles, but the simultaneous absorption by 0, and 0, must be considered in the stratosphere.\nFor the Hartley band the limit near 310 nm must be determined with precision, since the photodissociation\nprocess in the Hartley band, which is\n0, + hv (XI3lOnm)\n\n- O&A,)\n\nleads to the production of O(rD) atoms responsible, particularly\nH,O, CH, and H,, and also of NO from N,O.\n\n+ O(lD)\nbelow 50 km, for the production of OH from\n\nAt X> 310 nm, the 0, Huggins bands correspond to the limit of its ultraviolet absorption. The spectral range\nbetween 310 nm and 400 nm corresponds also to various limits of the absorption spectrum of H,O,, H,CO,\nNO,, N,O,, HNO,, HNO,, ClONO,, HOCl, etc.\nIn the visible region (410 - 850 nm), the Chappuis bands lead to the 0, photodissociation\nthe atmosphere, troposphere and lower stratosphere.\n\nin the lower part of\n\nAt A>300 nm, various effects such as the Rayleigh scattering and the albedo must be introduced. In particular, they play a role on the photodissociation rates of O,, ratio n(O)/n(O$, of NO,, ratio n(NO#n(NO),\nand on the absolute concentration of the other constituents absorbing in that spectral region.\nThus, the photodissociation problem is related to a knowledge of the solar flux and its possible variations in\ncertain spectral regions, the exact determination of the vertical distribution of the atmospheric optical depth\nof 0, and O,, the measurement of the absorption cross sections and photodissociation quantum yields for\neach constituent, and the introduction of the atmospheric conditions related to the radiation scattering and\nalbedo.\n\nSolar Fluxes and 0, Absorption\nThe absorption cross section in the Herzberg continuum is known with an accuracy which is not greater than\n25% (figure l-6). At X>230 nm the 0, cross section is not known with sufficient precision; but since the\nozone absorption is maximum in this part of the ultraviolet spectrum, the numerical error is reduced for the\nvalue of the total 0, photodissociation rate. Table l-33 shows the variation of the mean absorption cross section based on the experimental data of Ditchburn and Young (1962), Ogawa (1971), Hasson and Nicholls\n(1971) and Shardanand and Rao (1977) and increasing from about lO-24 cm2 at 240 nm to 1.5 x lO-23 cm2 at\n200 nm; this last value involves the O-O and O-l Schumann-Runge band absorption. The resulting j, (02)\nfrom identical energy spectral ranges (500 cm-r) shows a rapid increase from 240 nm to 230 nm (table l-33)\nand also a decrease at A>210 nm. The problem of the solar flux values will be discussed shortly.\nThe Lyman-o absorption occurs in the wing of an 0, band and is subject to a temperature effect (Carver et\nal., 1977). Its absorption cross section is a function of the temperature and of the 0, optical depth. Figure l-7\ncm2 at T = 190 K (mesospheric\nshows how the absorption cross section varies from 10d20cm2 to 7 x 10m21\ntemperature) for optical depths between 0 and 9. Lyman-a plays a role in the mesospheric photodissociation\nrate of several constituents, but particularly of H20, CH, and CO,. It is responsible for the NO ionization in\nthe mesosphere.\nThe problem of the 0, photodissociation in the Schumann-Runge band spectral range, and also of its atmospheric absorption has not yet reached its final solution. After various applications of the first experimental results to the atmosphere (Hudson et al., 1979; Kockarts, 1971, 1976; Hudson and Mahle, 1972; Fang et\nal., 1974; Park, 1974; Muramatsu, 1975; Shimazaki et al., 1977), new experimental and theoretical results\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\nDITCHBURN\nOGAWA\nHASSON\n\nAND\n\nYOUNG\n\n0971)\nAND NICHOLLS\n\nSHARDANAND\n\n57\n\n(1962)\n(1971)\n\n\\\n\n11977)\n\n\\\n\\\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n220\n\n.\n\nI\n\n210\n\n200\n\n230\n\n240\n\n(nm)\nFigure 1-6.

Additional measurements with still higher resolution would be useful. But precise oscillator strengths\nand linewidths associated with exact line positions are an absolute necessity for accurate determination of the\nphotodissociation processes, particularly in the mesosphere. From a comparative analysis (Nicolet and\nPeetermans, 1979) of the various parameters involved in the atmospheric 0, absorption, it can be concluded\nthat there is no important direct effect of the Schumann-Runge band absorption on the total J, value in the\nstratosphere. Simplified formulas for computing the 0, mean optical depth for the Schumann-Runge bands\nare also given in that paper. They can be applied to stratospheric problems without any restriction, but they\nmay require several improvements for mesospheric applications when the physical parameters are known with\nbetter accuracy. Nitric oxide requires a specific analysis (Cieslik, Nicolet, 1973; Cieslik, 1977, 1978; Frederick\nand Hudson, 1979b; Nicolet and Cieslik, 1979). See table l-34.\n\nSolar Flux Variability, 0, Absorption\nIn the wavelength range of X> 175 nm, which is involved in mesospheric, stratospheric and tropospheric\nphotodissociation processes, it has not yet been possible to identify solar flux variations associated with\nspecific solar activity phenomena.\nFirst, fluctuations of the solar constant S = 137 f 1 mW cm-2 have not been established by direct\nmeasurements; only a few of atmospheric phenomena have been associated with the bi-annual variation of\n6.6% in flux due to the variations of the Earth-to-Sun distance variation. Only Lyman-a at 121.6 nm shows a\nclear evidence of an association of its intensity with solar activity controlled by identified chromospheric\nplages. It is not possible to examine here all rocket or satellite measurements made since 1949 (see Friedman,\n1960; Weeks, 1967; Prinz, 1974; Vidal-Madjar,\n1975, 1977). It is clear that a more precise absolute calibration\nof the total Lyman-a line flux is still required; on the other hand, the profile measurements (Tousey, 1963;\nBruner and Parker, 1969; Bruner and Rense, 1969; Lemaire et al., 1978; Artzner, 1978) indicate that the\nglobal profile is a variable average profile whose form is determined by various solar features between the\ncenter and the limb which are influenced by solar activity.\nThus, a mean value of 3 x 10\xe2\x80\x9d photons cm-%ec-1 (see, for example, Thomas and Anderson, 1976) for the\nLyman+ solar flux at the mean Earth-to-Sun distance is almost a conventional value, although the accuracy\ncannot be better than *25%. If we write\nq o3(Lyman-a)\n\n= (3 f 1) x 10\xe2\x80\x9d photons cm-2sec-1\n\nwe may consider 2 x 10\xe2\x80\x99 1 photons cm-zsec-1 as a minimum working value and 4 x 10\xe2\x80\x99 1 photons cm\xe2\x80\x9dsec-l as\nan acceptable maximum value corresponding to quiet Sun and active solar conditions, respectively. There is,\ntherefore, a variation of a factor of the order of 2 over an average solar cycle. As far as the variations of the\nLyman-a intensity associated with short-term fluctuations (27 days, for example) are concerned, it seems\nreasonable to use as an indication the preliminary empirical relations established by Vidal-Madjar (1975).\nWe consider that the Lyman-a flux variations with solar activity represent the maximum possible differences\nthat can occur in the solar flux at X> 100 nm. Furthermore, there is no astrophysical result leading to such\npossibilities at X > 175 nm, except for a few emission lines of relatively low intensity related to solar plages.\n\n60\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nTable l-34\nSolar flux (4, photons cmm2\nset-\xe2\x80\x99 ), mean absorption cross\nsection (uMIAx cm \xe2\x80\x98) at T = 230 K, and O2 photodissociation\ncoefficients (j, set-\xe2\x80\x98) at the top of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere\nin the spectral range of the 02 Schumann-Runge bands.\n\nO2 BAND\n19-o\n18-O\n17-O\n16-O\n15-O\n14-O\n13-O\n12-O\n11-O\n1o-o\n9-o\n8-O\n7-o\n6-O\n5-O\n4-o\n3-o\n2-o\n\n403\n\n1.58~10\xe2\x80\x99~\n2.23\n2.80\n3.66\n5.18\n6.60\n8.79\n1.o3xlo11\n1.43\n2.07\n2.09\n2.56\n3.96\n4.63\n6.38\n7.16\n1.14x10\xe2\x80\x99*\n1.54\n\nuMAX\n7.52~10-~\xe2\x80\x99\n1.4lxlo-\xe2\x80\x98g\n1.71\n1.64\n1.44\n1.28\n9.9lx1o-2o\n7.14\n4.91\n3.17\n2.02\n1.16\n6.o6xlo-21\n2.86\n1.16\n4.o5xlo-22\n1.29\n3.88~10-~ 3\n\nL\nl.l9x1o-g\n3.14\n4.79\n6.00\n7.46\n8.45\n8.71\n7.35\n7.02\n6.56\n4.22\n2.97\n2.40\n1.32\n7.40x10-*0\n2.90\n1.47\n5.98x10-\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n61\n\nHowever, a recent review by Heath and Thekaekara (1977) describes various observational results obtained\nbetween 1964 and 1975 which would indicate a variation of a factor of the order of 2 at 200 nm and not less\nthan + 10% at 300 nm. On the other hand, Simon (1978) and Delaboudiniere et al. (1978) do not reach the\nconclusion that there is any such variability during the 11 year cycle. In fact, if we examine the observational\nresults obtained in the ultraviolet region from the first rocket measurements to the last observational results,\nwe can see that there is a systematic decrease in the observed values of this solar ultraviolet flux. Furthermore,\nif we consider only the more recent observational data in the spectral range of the 0, Schumann-Runge band\nsystem (Rottman, 1974; Simon, 1975; Samain and Simon, 1976; Heroux and Swirbalus, 1976; Brueckner et\nal., 1976), it is clear that the estimated precision in the flux measurement is of the order of + 20%. Thus, any\nmean value adopted for this spectral region reflects the lack of accuracy resulting from the dubious character\nof absolute calibrations, and also from the limited precision due to various uncertainties in laboratory and atmospheric measurements in this spectral region. Consequently, it must be said that any solar activity effect\nleading to a possible variation of the solar flux cannot yet be distinguished from differences between\nobservers. There is no clear indication leading to a perfect choice for mean or specific values of the solar flux\nin this spectral region leading to the 0, photodissociation. The adopted numerical values given in table l-34\nshould be accepted as provisional values, since the accuracy cannot be given and the precision cannot be better than f 25%. They indicate, however, an increase in the solar flux from 175 nm to 200 nm of the order of a\nfactor of 10 for identical spectral ranges (Av - 500 cm-r) and of about a factor of 100 from (19-O) to (2-O)\nband ranges. Nevertheless, it is not excluded that a systematic error of 50% could exist in a particular domain\nof this spectral region. In any case, reference must be made to the observational results (Brueckner et al.,\n1976) on the variation of the solar flux in the spectral range of the Schumann-Runge bands due to solar activity (about 5%).\nIn the region of the 0, Herzberg continuum, 200 nm < X<242nm, several atmospheric measurements have\nbeen made (see Simon, 1978). The values adopted here are based essentially on data published by Broadfoot\n(1972) and Simon (1975) and have been given in table l-33 with the related 0, absorption cross sections for\n500 cm-r spectral ranges. More observations are needed to improve the accuracy of the adopted values, even if\nit seems that the precision is better than at Xc200 nm.\nIn the spectral region covered by the Hartley band from 242 nm to 310 nm, we have also adopted rocket data\nby Broadfoot (1972) with the values obtained by balloon measurements (Simon, 1975) at A>284 nm in order\nto avoid certain discrepancies between various observational data particularly in the spectral region 200-300\nnm (see DeLuisi, 1975; Simon, 1978). The adopted results (Nicolet, 1975) are given in table l-35 with the corresponding 0, cross sections and photodissociation rates.\nFinally, in the ultraviolet region, corresponding to the Huggins bands, it is necessary to introduce in the\nnumerical values a smooth transition from about 300 nm, in the range of the spectral limit of observational\ndata obtained by Broadfoot (1972), to 400 nm where the solar flux data obtained by Arvesen et al. (1969) can\nbe accepted if the published values are reduced to a lower solar constant value (Nicolet, 1975). Such data for\nAA = 5 nm are given in table l-36. New measurements of the solar flux between 300 nm and 400 nm would be\nuseful in helping to improve the accuracy of absolute values.\nFinally, the solar flux.which is adopted in the visible region corresponds to the numerical values adjusted to\nthe present value of the solar constant (Nicolet, 1975) and deduced also from observational data published by\nArvesen et al.

Since the experimental cross sections of the 0, visible band are\ncertainly good and are not subject to a temperature effect, the total photodissociation rate J, (Chappuis) =\n3.4 x lO-%ec-r seems to be accurate; the total error (< f 10%) corresponds to the accuracies of the solar flux\nobservations and of the experimental 0, absorption cross sections. In the region of the 0, Huggins bands,\nwhere the temperature effect on the absorption cross section value is significant, new solar observations and\nlaboratory measurements are certainly needed.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE\n\n62\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nTable l-35\nSolar flux (q, photons cmS2\nset-\xe2\x80\x99 ), average cross section (u, cm2 for 500 cm-\xe2\x80\x98) and 0s photodissociation\ncoefficients (i, SC-\xe2\x80\x98) at the top of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere in the spectral ranges of the O2 Herzberg\ncontinuum and 0s Hartley band,\n\nNnn-9\n201.0\n203.0\n205.1\n207.2\n209.4\n211.6\n213.9\n216.2\n218.6\n220.9\n223.4\n225.9\n228.6\n231.2\n233.9\n236.7\n239.5\n242.4\n\nQ3\n1.44x1012\n1.80\n2.08\n2.45\n5.09\n7.12\n9.23\n8.42\n1.20x10r3\n1.22\n1.77\n1.60\n1.96\n1.97\n1.70\n2.00\n1.77\n2.58\n\n3.26x10-l\xe2\x80\x99\n3.26\n3.51\n4.11\n4.84\n6.26\n8.57\n1.17x10-\xe2\x80\x98*\n1.52\n1.97\n2.55\n3.24\n4.00\n4.83\n5.79\n6.86\n7.97\n9.00\n\nL\n4.69~10-~\n5.87\n7.30\n1.o1x1o-6\n2.46\n4.46\n7.91\n9.85\n1.82x10-\xe2\x80\x99\n2.40\n4.51\n5.18\n7.84\n9.52\n9.84\n1.37x1o-4\n1.41\n2.32\n\nXk-4\n\n245.4\n248.5\n25 1.6\n254.7\n258.0\n261.4\n264.9\n268.4\n272.1\n275.9\n279.7\n283.7\n287.7\n291.9\n296.3\n300.7\n305.3\n\n9cu\n\n2.35~10\xe2\x80\x99~\n2.38\n2.28\n3.24\n5.83\n4.89\n1.19x1o\xe2\x80\x994\n1.29\n1.17\n1.11\n7.85~10\xe2\x80\x99~\n1.50x10\xe2\x80\x994\n2.12\n3.56\n3.33\n3.08\n4.39\n\nQ3\n\n1.oox1o-17\n1.07\n1.11\n1.12\n1.11\n1.03\n9.43x10-\xe2\x80\x98*\n8.23\n6.81\n5.31\n3.99\n2.84\n1.92\n1.14\n6.60\n3.69\n1.97\n\nL\n2.35~10-~\n2.55\n2.53\n3.63\n6.47\n5.04\n1.12x1o-3\n1.06\n7.97x1o-4\n5.89\n3.13\n4.26\n4.07\n4.06\n2.20\n1.14\n8.65x1 0-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLABORATORYMEASUREMENTS\n\n63\n\nTable l-36\nSolar flux (q, photons cmm2\nset-\xe2\x80\x98) with average cross section\n(CI,cm2 for A A = 5 nm) and O3 photodissociation coefficient\n(j, set-\xe2\x80\x98) in the spectral range of the 0s Huggins bands, at\nthe top of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\n\nNnm)\n\n403\n\nuO3\n\n310.0\n315.0\n320.0\n325.0\n330.0\n335.0\n340.0\n345.0\n350.0\n355.0\n360.0\n365.0\n370.0\n375.0\n380.0\n385.0\n390.0\n395.0\n400.0\n405.0\n\n4.95x10r4\n5.83\n6.22\n6.96\n8.61\n8.15\n8.94\n8.44\n8.69\n9.14\n8.23\n1.07x1015\n1.08\n9.72\n1.11\n8.98\n1.18\n9.34\n1.69\n1.70\n\n1.o5x1o\xe2\x80\x9cg\n5.23~10\xe2\x80\x98~\xe2\x80\x99\n2.91\n1.50\n7.78~10-~~\n3.72\n1.71\n7.46~10-~~\n2.66\n1.09\n5.49x 1o-23\n\nL\n5.20~10-~\n3.05\n1.81\n1.04\xe2\x80\x98\n6.70~10-~\n3.03\n1.53\n6.30~10-~\n2.31\n9.96x10-*\n4.52\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nTable 1-37\nSolar flux (q photons cmV2sec-l) with average cross section\n(u, cm2 for A A = 5 nm) and O3 photodissociation coefficient\n6, set-\xe2\x80\x98) in the spectral range of the Chappuis bands.\n\n400\n405\n410\n415\n420\n425\n430\n435\n440\n445\n450\n455\n460\n465\n470\n475\n480\n485\n490\n495\n500\n505\n510\n515\n520\n525\n530\n535\n540\n545\n550\n555\n560\n565\n570\n575\n580\n585\n590\n595\n600\n605\n610\n615\n620\n625\n\n1.69\n1.70\n1.84\n1.97\n1.95\n1.81\n1.67\n1.98\n2.02\n2.18\n2.36\n2.31\n2.39\n2.38\n2.39\n2.44\n2.51\n2.30\n2.39\n2.48\n2.40\n2.46\n2.49\n2.32\n2.39\n2.42\n2.55\n2.51\n2.49\n2.55\n2.53\n2.54\n2.50\n2.57\n2.58\n2.67\n2.67\n2.70\n2.62\n2.69\n2.63\n2.68\n2.66\n2.59\n2.69\n2.61\n\n5.35xlo-8\n6.19\n7.78\n1.18~10-~\n1.14\n1.71\n2.25\n3.25\n4.04\n4.90\n8.53\n8.76\n9.70\nl.l9x1o\xe2\x80\x986\nI .78\nI .94\n1.98\n2.25\n2.93\n3.99\n3.93\n3.7 1\n4.25\n5.01\n6.50\n6.88\n7.17\n7.83\n8.02\n8.53\n9.70\nI.llxlo-s\n1.20\n1.27\n1.21\n1.17\n1.16\n1.24\n1.29\n1.30\n1.21\n1.10\n1.05\n9.4oxlo-6\n\n630\n635\n640\n645\n650\n655\n660\n665\n670\n675\n680\n685\n690\n695\n700\n705\n710\n715\n720\n725\n730\n735\n740\n745\n750\n755\n760\n765\n770\n775\n780\n785\n790\n795\n800\n805\n810\n815\n820\n825\n830\n835\n840\n845\n850\n\n2.62\n2.62\n2.63\n2.60\n2.55\n2.48\n2.57\n2.61\n2.61\n2.62\n2.62\n2.57\n2.52\n2.60\n2.58\n2.52\n2.51\n2.48\n2.45\n2.48\n2.45\n2.44\n2.39\n2.40\n2.41\n2.40\n2.38\n2.34\n2.32\n2.30\n2.33\n2.34\n2.29\n2.29\n2.27\n2.27\n2.20\n2.22\n2.18\n2.20\n2.14\n2.14\n2.13\n2.09\n2.05\n\n8.99~10-~\n8.31\n7.2 1\n6.79\n6.17\n5.46\n5.19\n4.83\n4.36\n4.03\n3.72\n3.21\n2.82\n2.65\n2.37\n2.12\n1.93\n1.73\n1.54\n1.41\n1.29\n1.16\n1.07\n1.01\n9.04x10-\xe2\x80\x99\n7.80\n6.95\n6.46\n6.26\n6.44\n6.64\n2.90\n5.04\n4.17\n3.70\n3.97\n4.18\n4.11\n3.71\n3.34\n3.04\n3.00\n2.98\n2.97\n2.97\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nMODELS\nINTRODUCTION\nAtmospheric phenomena are extremely complex and because of this, it is impossible to-achieve-an-accurate\ndescription of all physical, chemical, and dynamical processes in a single comprehensive computer simulation. Thus, the atmospheric scientist must select the phenomena of most interest, hypothesize on those processes that exercise the most control, and construct an appropriate model which may be either analytic or\nnumerical. Although, by necessity, the model is a simplified representation of the real atmosphere, if the\npremises upon which it is based prove correct, it can provide an accurate description of the selected\nphenomena.\nConfidence in atmospheric models is generally gained by a comparison of model predictions with observational data. However, the cause-and-effect relationship contained in a model is not always apparent or discernable in observational data. It is quite possible for a model to omit relevant physical processes and still\npredict effects fortuitously in agreement with observational data. Similarly, a model can fail to predict\nobserved phenomena because it is too restrictive in the number of processes it incorporates.\nThe most rational approach for studying stratospheric phenomena is to rely upon a hierarchy of models that\nindividually assess the chemical, dynamical, physical, and radiative processes of the stratosphere. Once a firm\nunderstanding of individual processes and confidence in the correctness of simple models are gained, then the\nconstruction of more complex models can be undertaken.\nA variety of models used in the study of stratospheric phenomena are examined in the following paragraphs.\nEach type of model is important in its own right, and has made a significant contribution to the knowledge of\nstratospheric processes. Particular models allow in-depth study of selected processes and the possibility of\ndeveloping suitable parameterizations of these processes. Specific attention is given to three important processes: chemistry, radiative transfer, and motions. All of these processes depend on solar radiation and it is\nappropriate to begin the discussion with models of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s radiation balance and vertical temperature\nstructure.\n\nRADIATION AND ONE-DIMENSIONAL\n\nRADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE\n\nMODELS\n\nOne-dimensional radiative-convective models play a limited, but useful, role in stratospheric studies, primarily by providing estimates of the direct radiative effect of changes in stratospheric composition on global\ntemperatures. Such estimates have limited significance because they exclude important feedbacks in the atmosphere. However, these models are needed to develop and test parameterizations for the multidimensional\nmodels.\n\nCURRENT CAPABILITIES\n\nAND LIMITATIONS\n\nOne-dimensional radiative-convective (1-D RC) models are used to compute the vertical temperature profile\nof the atmosphere under certain assumptions concerning the physical processes that determine the profile. In\nthese models, the atmosphere is assumed to be in radiative equilibrium (a balance between radiative heatings\nand toolings), except at altitudes where the resulting temperature permits processes other than radiation (such\nas small-scale convection or large-scale dynamics) to contribute significantly to the vertical transfer of energy.\n\n65\n\n66\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nFor climate studies, a rapid and accurate method is essential to calculate temperature changes due to infrared\nradiative heating and cooling in the atmosphere. The available radiative transfer techniques and\nspectroscopic data on atmospheric gases, by McClatchey et al. (1973), are adequate for stratospheric radiative\ntransfer calculations. In a realistic atmosphere, the basic problems encountered are the inseparable processes\nof scattering and absorption due to cloud and aerosol particles, and of absorption by atmospheric gases as\ndiscussed by Goody (1964). The main difficulties are: (1) integration over frequency is underestimated by the\nusual band-model techniques for gaseous absorption which do not allow for multiple scattering, and (2) direct\nline-by-line integration is too time consuming for practical use. Recently, Lacis et al. (1979) have developed\nan approximate method, called the correlated k-distribution method, to handle the frequency integration.\nThis approximate treatment is remarkably accurate when compared to line-by-line calculations for the\n9.6pm ozone band (one of the most complex atmospheric band systems), while the commonly used pressurescaling and Curtis-Godson approximations fail to yield accurate results (Walshaw and Rodgers, 1963). Furthermore, the k-distribution method is several orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line calculations.\n\nSpecified Lapse Rate\nThe procedure used by Manabe and Strickler (1964) and Manabe and Wetherald (1967) to parameterize the\nvertical transport of heat by atmospheric motions was to limit the computed temperature gradient to a\npreassigned maximum (6.5 K/km) wherever the radiative equilibrium profile exceeded that limit. This procedure is called a convective adjustment, although the empirical maximum lapse rate incorporates effects of\nlarge scale dynamics and condensation as well as convection. Most 1-D RC models developed in the last 15\nyears essentially have followed the method of Manabe and Strickler (1964).\nThe prime difficulty with this empirical approach is that it does not indicate how the lapse rate may change as\nthe climate changes. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss other physical procedures for specifying the lapse\nrate, even though these may have only limited domains of applicability.\n\nRelative Humidity\nWater (in the form of both vapor and clouds) is the primary atmospheric constituent determining the surface\ntemperature of the Earth. Cloud cover is the prime factor in determining the planetary albedo, and thus the\neffective temperature. The greenhouseeffect (by which the surface temperature is increased above the effective temperature), is determined mainly by water vapor which defines the infrared (8 to 14 pm) window. Other\ngases perturb this basic picture, primarily by absorbing the window region. In the stratosphere where there is\nvery little water vapor, 0, and CO, primarily determine the temperature structure. However, changes in the\nstratospheric water vapor abundance have a great impact on surface temperature.\nManabe and Wetherald (1967) assumed that the relative humidity would remain fixed for a perturbation of\nother radiative constituents. The corresponding change in the amount of water vapor resulted in a positive\nfeedback effect of a factor of approximately 1.8 (i.e., the percent change in H,O is 1.8 times the percent\nchange in other constituents) compared tti the case of fixed absolute humidity. More elaborate radiative\ncalculations by Wang et al. (1976) confirm this, with a slightly smaller feedback factor of approximately 1.6.\nMost I-D RC models use the assumption of fixed relative humidity, because it appears more plausible than\nfixed absolute humidity. Recent work by Sarachik (1979) lends considerable support to the case for approximately constant relative humidity.\n\nClouds\nThe radiative effects of specified clouds were included in the early 1-D RC models by Manabe and Wetherald.\n(1967) and others. Most clouds cause a reduction in surface temperature, because their reflection of solar\nradiation has a larger effect than their blanketing of thermal radiation.\n\n67\n\nMODELS\n\nHowever, cirrus clouds at their normal altitudes (approximately\nat both high and low latitudes (Lacis et al. 1979).\n\n12 to 20 km) cause a strong greenhouseeffect\n\nIn general, current 1-D RC models do not predict cloud altitude, or the possible feedback effect caused by a\nchange of cloud altitude with a change of climate. However, the models have shown that the assumptions\nabout cloud altitude do strongly influence the model results as reported by Wang et al. (1976). The models\nalso show that the cloud-base altitude, and perturbations of the altitude, are equally important.\n\nAerosols\nRadiative effects of aerosols can be considered similar to the effects of clouds; i.e., there are competing effects in the solar and thermal parts of the frequency spectrum. Current 1-D RC models permit an accurate\nassessment of the direct radiative effects of aerosols, provided that the physical properties of aerosols are\nknown. This climatic forcing by aerosols depends substantially on the composition, size distribution and\naltitude distribution of the aerosol, as well as on the amount of the aerosol. Furthermore, the radiative forcing due to aerosols produced by volcanic explosions provides an excellent opportunity for testing climate\nmodeling capabilities (Hansen et al., 1978). One very useful strategy for investigating the global climatic\nsystem is to perform detailed observations and analyses of the next large volcanic explosion. The observations\nshould include global monitoring of the spread, growth, and decay of the aerosol, sampling of the aerosol\nproperties in situ, and accurate global monitoring of the climate response. These data would permit testing of\nglobal climate models and aid in-depth analyses of radiative, chemical, and dynamical processes essential for\nobtaining an improved understanding of the physical mechanisms and interactions involved.\n\nMODEL VERIFICATION\nSeveral procedures can be employed for verification\nbased on comparison with observations.\n\nof I-D RC models, although ultimately,\n\nall of these are\n\nComparison with Other Models\nThe first test of 1-D models is a comparison with other models, usually with more sophisticated multidimensional models. In general, this can be expected to lead to a similarity in the results of the different\nmodels, if the processes included in the more sophisticated models are parameterized in the simpler models.\nThus, the procedure is basically a cross-check, since all the models must be compared to observations. Recent\nmodel comparisons by Coakley (1979) and others indicate that different models are in rather close agreement\nwhen the same processes are taken into account.\n\nComparison with Observations\nThe 1-D models offer a reasonably good method of reproducing the mean atmospheric temperature profile,\nas shown in detail by Manabe and Strickler (1964). However, since there is a certain amount of tuning in the\nmodels (such as the 6.5 K/km specified tropospheric lapse rate), additional comparison with observations are\ncrucial. This is especially true if the models are to be relied upon for predicting the effect of atmospheric perturbations.\nRecently, Hansen et al. (1978) argued that the temperature perturbation caused by the aerosols produced after\na large volcanic explosion can provide an excellent test case for verifying the ability to model radiative perturbations. The best documented large explosion to date (Mt. Agung in 1963), provides some encouraging\nevidence in this regard as shown in figure 2-l. However, Hansen et al. caution overinterpretation\nof this\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n68\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nsingle test, particularly because of the lack of sufficient data on: (1) aerosol properties, (2) the observed\ntemperature changes, (3) other factors which affected the temperature, and (4) the effect of many model\nsimplifications.\nNASA is currently developing plans for a more comprehensive study of the next large\nvolcanic eruption.\nM\n\n-\n\nIw\n\nObserved\n\n86\n\n-\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nComputed\n\n4-\n\n6-\n\n100 mb\n\n4-\n\nI\nJ\n\n1961\n\nJ\n\n1962\n\nJ\n\n1963\n\nI\nJ\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1964\n\nJ\n\n1965\n\nJ\n\n1966\n\n1\nJ\n\nFigure 2-1.

Representation of gas-phase chemical reactions by\nproduction-and-loss terms in the continuity equation is an accurate description. The difficulties and deficiencies in a chemical model are related to: (1) accurate rate coefficients for atmospheric conditions (2) inclusion\nof all important species, (3) dissociation rates and quantum yields for photochemical processes (4) proper\ntemporal (diurnal) averaging for long-time integrations, (5) surface sources and sinks and (6) in the case of\n1-D models, proper spatial (latitudinal) averaging. The chemical species included in a model depend on\nlaboratory studies, field measurements, and theoretical insight. It is essential that all important species be included. For example, in initial studies of stratospheric chlorine only Cl, HCl, ClO, Cl,, and Cl00 were considered, but subsequent study showed that CIONO, and HOC1 were important reservoir species. Because\n\nMODELS\n\n69\n\nsome chemical species have chemical lifetimes comparable to transport time constants, the completeness of\nthe chemistry depends on the accuracy of the transport employed in the model.\nCalculations based on a chemical model are very sensitive to a number of key reactions. Recent revisions of\nthe rate-coefficients for reactions such as NO + HO, - NO, + OH, and HO, + 0, - OH + 20, have\nresulted in major changes in predictions by chemical models. In principle, the problem can be solved by\nsuitable laboratory kinetics experiments. However, the laboratory studies are usually carried out under conditions very different from those in the atmosphere. For example, the early measurements of OH + HO, H,O + O,, and CO + OH - CO, + H were carried out at low pressure. Since these reactions were thought\nto be binary reactions, the results were expected to be valid up to about 1 atmosphere of pressure. However, it\nwas recently found that these reactions may be more complex than previously assumed, and that pressure\ndependence is not negligible.\nPhotodissociation rates (J values) depend on the solar radiation field. At wavelengths shorter than 300 nm,\nthe atmosphere acts as a pure absorber, and the radiative transfer problem is straightforward.\nFor longer\nwavelengths, the calculation of J values is complicated by multiple scattering. The important molecules that\nare affected by this complication are CIONO,, HOCl, ClO, O,, H,O,, NO,, and HNO,. There are other\nspecies (such as NO, OH, and HO,) that are strongly coupled to the above species, and these will be affected\nby the way the radiation field is handled. Currently, methods developed by Luther and Gelinas (1976), for example, are adequate for calculation of the multiple-scattering corrections, except at sunrise and sunset.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sphericity of the atmosphere cannot be ignored. Since the total time involved is only\nabout one-half hour, an incorrect treatment of sphericity will not seriously affect the predictions of the\nchemical model. However, sphericity considerations are important for comparison of theory with\nmeasurements obtained near sunrise and sunset. A number of important species such as OH, HO,, and NO,at\n40 km have response times on the order of minutes.\nThe production and loss rates in a chemical calculation have the forms, J[x] or k[x][y], where J is defined\nabove and k is the rate coefficient. The most accurate procedure is to solve the time-dependent continuity\nequation with the radiation field computed at each time step. Algorithms which overcome the stiffness problem (most troublesome at sunrise and sunset), and the convergenceproblem (for long-lived species such as\n0, in the lower stratosphere) are in regular use. A very simple, but acceptably accurate technique for performing diurnal averages of k[x][y] has been reported by Turco and Whitten (1978).\nIn 1-D models, the latitudinal average (< >) of k[x][y], is approximated by c k> < [x] > <[y] >. The\nvalidity of this approximation depends on the nature of the problem. For perturbation studies involving\nCFMs or N,O, it is probably acceptable. However, for problems with latitudinal asymmetry, proper spatial\naveraging can only be obtained with a multi-dimensional\nmodel. Further details of one-dimensional\nphotochemical models have been discussed in Hudson (1977).\n\nAEROSOL MODELS\nJunge et al. (1961) made the first in situ measurements of, and constructed the first model for, the\nstratospheric aerosol layer. Recognition by Pollack et al. (1976c) that these high-altitude particles can influence the climate and by Cadle et al. (1975) that ozone might be affected by surface reactions spurred the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated aerosol models by Kritz (1975), Rosen et al. (1978), and Turco et al.\n(1979a). Knowledge of the chemical reactions which influence the stratospheric sulfur compounds and the\nformation of sulfate particles has also advanced through work by Friend et al. (1973), Castlemen et al.\n(1975a), and Crutzen (1976b). The microphysical processes treated in aerosol models include nucleation\n(homogeneous, heterogeneous and ion), vapor condensation and evaporation, coagulation (Brownian),\n\n70\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\ngravitational sedimentation, and convective and diffusive transport. In general, these models can reproduce\nsome of the important features of stratospheric aerosols, the total sulfate mass, the number and size of the\nparticles, and their optical properties, but they cannot generally reproduce conditions following large volcanic\neruptions.\nMany problems remain unsolved. The composition of natural aerosols is believed by Farlow et al. (1978) to be\nliquid sulfuric acid with a mixture of numerous sulfates, halogen- and nitrogen-bearing compounds, and insoluble materials such as silicates. The physical and chemical processes responsible for this composition are\nunknown, and the impact of heterogeneous reactions on ozone abundances is unresolved, although it appears\nto be small. The major sources of sulfur for the ambient aerosol iayer are OCS, SO,, and CS,, but the origins\nof OCS and CS, have not been clearly identified (Sze and Ko, \xe2\x80\x981979a). The mechanism of H,SO, formation\nfrom these source gases involves intermediate sulfur radicals (HSO,) whose properties are undetermined but\nmay be important for initiating aerosol nucleation according to Friend, (private communication). There are\nalso uncertainties in H,SO, vapor pressures, background condensation nuclei concentrations, and the quantity of meteoritic dust and gas reaching the stratosphere. These factors affect aerosol properties and predictions.\nCalculations have been made by Turco et al. (1979a, b, c) of man\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the aerosol layer due to increased industrial emissions of OCS, high-altitude deposition of soot and SO, by SSTs, and injection of aluminum\noxide particles by space-shuttle launch motors. The results show that, while large aerosol perturbations are\nnot predicted for any of the emissions studied, aerosol perturbations capable of altering the climate could occur with substantial increases in such emissions. Accordingly, aerosol models are needed to assess the potential influence of anthropogenic activities on terrestrial aerosols and climate.\n\nSIMPLIFIED TRANSPORT MODELS\nONE-DIMENSIONAL\n\nDIFFUSION MODELS\n\nThe one-dimensional (1-D) vertical diffusion model permits the use of very detailed chemical reaction sets by\ninclusion of transport in a simplified manner, as an altitude-dependent diffusion coefficient, K(z). This\ntreatment of transport is based on the assumption that the vertical flux, 9, of a minor constituent is proportional to the gradient in its time and globally averaged volume mixing ratio, f, and is expressed by the equation:\n@J= -KMaf\n\naz\nwhere M is the bulk atmosphere density and z is the altitude. The appropriate\nthen:\nM af -\n\nat\n\ncontinuity\n\nequation for f is\n\n! (KM af) = P - L\n\naz\n\naz\n\nwhere P and L are the chemical production and loss rates, respectively. The simplified assumption contained\nin this equation is that transport always acts to remove gradients in mixing ratios and thus, is down-gradient.\nThis has empirical support in that minor constituents that have long-residence times in the stratosphere are\nobserved to be mixed uniformly with the major gases. Although the neglect of horizontal fluxes cannot be\nrigorously justified from the physical standpoint, the most important variations off occur with height and the\nresults of 1-D diffusion models can be interpreted as horizontal averages over the globe. Mahlman (1975), and\nprivate communication, (1979) has examined the applicability of 1-D and 2-D diffusion models by comparing\nthe model results to those of a 3-D general circulation model. He concluded that the simplified approaches\n\nMODELS\n\n71\n\nproduce results consistent to within a factor of 2 over a wide range of conditions, although there are regions\nwhere the true circulation does not act to reduce mixing ratio gradients. Alternately, the success of 1-D\nmodels in reproducing observations can be cited as empirical evidence that, in many cases, the simple assumptions concerning transport are useful even though they do not constitute a physically correct model of the process.\nEmpirical determinations of K(z) in the stratosphere are based on observations of a minor gas whose\nchemistry is presumably well understood. A good example is N,O which is supplied to the stratosphere by upward transport and lost through dissociation. The altitude-dependence of the mixing ratio may then be used\nto deduce K(z). The N,O measurements of Schmeltekopf et al. (1977a) imply a latitude dependent K(z). For\n1-D calculations a globally averaged K(z) is required and the profile presented in Hudson (1977) is still considered applicable. Recently Allen and Yung (1979) have derived a profile of K(z) from CO data in the upper\nstratosphere and mesosphere. Taken with the earlier inferences of Wofsy and McElroy (1973) and Hunten\n(1975), these imply K(z) values between 1 x lo5 and 5 x lo6 cm\xe2\x80\x9dsec -I between 50 and 80 km. Throughout the\ndynamically active troposphere, a large constant value for K on the order of lo5 cm*sec -\xe2\x80\x99 is applicable. The\nstability of the lower stratosphere leads to smaller values (between lo3 and lo4 cm*sec -I ).\nAlthough the 1-D diffusion approximation has been used in numerous aeronomic studies, care must be used\nin interpreting the results. Such models are least applicable when making predictions in cases where large\nhorizontal gradients are involved (for example, NO, injections along SST corridors). However, as noted by\nHudson (1977) and the National Academy of Sciences (1976), the 1-D calculation appears to provide an acceptable level of accuracy when applied to a wide class of globally averaged calculations, particularly when\nthe effects of transport are minor compared to chemistry. Despite its severe limitations, the 1-D diffusion\nmodel will probably remain, for sometime, the major tool of chemical aeronomy because of its simplicity\ncompared to the complexity of multi-dimensional models.\n\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL\n\nDYNAMICAL\n\nMODELS\n\nIn an attempt to account for both the latitudinal and vertical structure of the atmosphere, a variety of twodimensional models have been developed. These models consider only zonally averaged quantities and are\nclassified according to their method of averaging dynamical variables.\n\nEulerian-Mean Models\nThe term Eulerian Mean signifies that averaging is performed along latitude circles, at fixed latitude and vertical coordinates. The resulting equations contain eddyflux divergenceterms that must be either (1) specified\nin advance, or (2) parameterized in terms of zonal mean quantities. The first approach has the disadvantage\nof implicitly assuming that departures from zonal symmetry (eddies or waves) are independent of the structure of the zonal-mean flow, and this is a poor assumption, since it is well known that changes in the mean\nflow induced by the waves will, in turn, feed back on the waves themselves.\nParameterizations of Eulerian eddy fluxes have mostly followed the approach proposed by Reed and German\n(1965), who assumed that the local eddy flux of any quantity is related linearly to the mean gradients of that\nquantity by a positive definite tensor. Arguments of this kind are usually based on some kind of mixing-length\nhypothesis, and on the assumption that projections of particle trajectories in the meridional plane are straight\nlines. That such a parameterization sometimes fails was demonstrated by Mahlman (1975), whose 3-D tracer\ncalculations effectively showed that the total implied eddy-flux tensor can often become locally negative. This\nwas recently demonstrated in another way by Matsuno (1979) and also by Plumb (1979). Matsuno showed\nthat for a simple analytical model of a steady, weakly dissipated, stratospheric planetary wave, the projections of the particle paths in the meridional plane are ellipses, and that the tensor relating eddy fluxes to mean\ngradients is strongly antisymmetric, representing an advective, rather than a diffusive process.\n\n72\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe above arguments indicate only that eddy transport parameterizations by the Reed and German (1965)\nhypothesis can be inconsistent. This does not mean that successful 2-D transport models cannot be constructed. Such models might be based either on newer, less restricted transport hypotheses, or on a completely\nempirical engineering approach in which transport coefficients are fitted to produce agreement with real data.\nCurrently, there exist a number of 2-D transport models empirically based in their construction, e.g., Hidalgo\nand Crutzen (1977); Louis et al. (1974); Whitten et al. (1977); and Borucki et al. (1979). These models have\nachieved varying degrees of success when applied to tracers other than those for which the original model was\ncalibrated. Such empirical models show promise of reducing the uncertainties inherent in 1-D models because\nthey allow for meridional variations in trace constituents and overhead Sun angle. There is reason to believe\nthat further progress can be expected in these types of models.\nOne problem that remains to be resolved is the predictions of perturbations that use empirical transport\nparameterizations. For many perturbations, there is reason to expect that such models should give useful and\nreasonable results. But if either subtle balances or large excursions away from the current state must be considered, the confidence in the predictions of these models will decrease markedly. In this context, the more\nphysically based models also result in a decrease in confidence in such situations since they also contain empirically based parameterizations. However, because these models are based on known physical processes, the\ndecrease in confidence should be considerably smaller.\nAt present, there are no existing 2-D transport models that have demonstrated a more fundamentally correct\nbasis than that in the Reed and German (1965) mixing-length hypothesis. It is useful to outline some of the approaches currently under consideration that may circumvent the difficulties described above.\n\nMean-Cell 2-D Models\nIn these models, equations have been solved by Rao-Vupputuri (1973); Harwood and Pyle (1975, 1977); and\nTurner et al. (1979) for the zonal mean meteorological variables in addition to the tracer variables. These\nmodels may show more promise because they contain the possibility, at least, of inducing a meridional circulation that buffers the calculation against the non-physically based eddy-transport parameterization.\n\nSecond-Order Closure Approaches\nA suggestion was offered by Mahlman and Lee (private communication, 1978) that a 2-D tracer transport\nmodel could compute eddy fluxes internally by using the equations of motion to generate specific prognostic\nequations for the eddy tracer fluxes themselves. Required input parameters are self-consistent sets of zonally\naveraged meteorological statistics composed of individual variables, variances, and covariances. Such an approach requires closure hypotheses at the level of triple-eddy products. The degree of sensitivity to such\nhigher-order closure uncertainties remains unclear.\n\nLagrangian-Mean Approaches\nA recent theoretical approach to problems of the interaction of waves and mean flows has been to perform\naverages over specified sets of fluid particles rather than along lines fixed in coordinate space. This is the\ngeneralizedLagrangian-Mean (GLM) theory set forth by Andrews and McIntyre (1976a; 1978a,b), which has\nalready proved to be a powerful tool in deducing general results concerning the interaction of waves and mean\nflows. For example, the crucial importance of wave dissipation (or forcing) and wave transience in bringing\nabout mean-flow changes has been clearly demonstrated; this general result is not easily obtainable by the\nEulerian-mean approach. The GLM theory also allows a rather general formulation of the wave-action concept which, apart from its fundamental physical interest, may also be a useful diagnostic tool in the description of wave propagation in complicated stratospheric mean flows.\n\nMODELS\n\n73\n\nBecause of its concern with mean particle properties, it is possible that the GLM approach may be a natural\ntool for the study and interpretation of transports of tracers in the stratosphere. The first attempt to use the\ntheory for this purpose was made by Dunkerton (1978), who exploited the fact that the GLM version of the\npotential temperature equation contains no eddy-flux terms. After various approximations, he was able to\nestimate the Lagrangian-mean meridional circulation for the stratosphere and mesosphere at the solstices on\nthe basis of Eulerian-mean heating at those altitudes. This meridional circulation is capable of describing the\nmotion of the center of mass (as viewed in the meridional plane) of a line of tracer particles that originally lay\nalong a circle of latitude. As calculated by Dunkerton, it consists of a single stratospheric cell much like the\nBrewer-Dobson circulation, which had been postulated to explain certain observations of the ozone and water\nvapor distribution (and which can be regarded as a Lagrangian circulation in some sense). By contrast, the\nEulerian-mean circulation consists of two cells, including a wave-induced Ferrel cell in the winter hemisphere.\nThis qualitative agreement with observation is encouraging, but further improvement in Dunkerton\xe2\x80\x99s simple\nmodel will require much thought and ingenuity. For example, the Lagrangian-mean heating (rather than the\nEulerian-mean heating) should really be used; the differences could be quite significant in the lower\nstratosphere as shown by Mahlman et al. (1979). It is desirable to relax some of the other assumptions made\nby Dunkerton as well, which naturally leads to the question of the feasibility of a 2-D Lagrangian-mean\nnumerical model. As yet, no such model has been constructed, but the possibility of such a model, either for\nsimulation or diagnostic purposes, should be considered seriously.\nAnother approach is to use output from 3-D stratospheric circulation models to construct Lagrangian-mean\nquantities. This would seem a natural thing to try in view of the insight afforded by the GLM theory in the\ntheoretical studies of Andrews and McIntyre (1978a,b). Numerical experiments by Hsu (private communication, 1979) have shown that the formalism as developed by Andrews and McIntyre may break down in practice when waves approach finite amplitude, because lines of fluid particles become highly convoluted and split\ninto separate segments. At the present time, techniques of adapting the GLM formulation to circumvent this\ndifficulty are being pursued actively by McIntyre (1979) and Mahlman et al. (1979).\n\nTHREE-DIMENSIONAL\n\nDYNAMICAL\n\nMODELS\n\nQUASI-GEOSTROPHIC MODELS OF THE STRATOSPHERE\nBetween the general circulation models and the eddy-diffusion chemistry models of the stratosphere, there is a\nmultitude of models in which the dynamics are simplified and the chemical and radiative processes are highly\nparameterized. These models have been developed to focus on particular stratospheric phenomena (such as\nthe quasi-biennial oscillation, or the sudden stratospheric warming), and to provide an inexpensive representation of the general circulation of the stratosphere. They can often sort out the complex dynamical features\nsimulated by general circulation models, as well as provide a test bed for theoretical concepts.\nTable 2-l shows a representative list of stratospheric models. Three categories of assumptions characterize\nthese models: (1) truncated dynamics, (2) parameterized radiative transfer, and (3) simplified chemistry. This\nsection discusses the various schemes employed by the models to simplify calculations and the effect each of\nthese assumptions might have on the transport, production, and loss of ozone. (Note that most of these\nmodels do not consider ozone chemistry and its transport.) The major question is: if such transport were to be\ncalculated, how would this transport be affected by the assumptions used in the models, and how accurately\nmight these models assess the impact of pollution-injection\ninto the stratosphere over a long period?\n\nDynamics\nSeveral approximations are used to simplify the dynamics of the models listed in table 2-1, quasi-geostrophy,\nspectral truncation, and area limitation. With the exception of the model developed by Clark (1970) (included\nto provide a historical perspective), the models listed take into account the entire stratosphere.\n\nI\n\n-\n\nUpper\nLevel (km)\n\n130\n\n9\n\n35\n\n23\n\n33\n\n2s\n\n17\n\n40\n\nRamanathan\nand Grose (1978)\n\nSchoeberl and\nStrobe1(1978a, 1980)\n\nHarwood and\nPyle (1975, 1977)\n\nHolton (1975)\n\n,Cunnold et al.

Because\nmost of the energy of atmospheric motion resides in Rossby-type disturbances, this assumption provides a\ngood approximation to midlatitude dynamics and a fair approximation to the Hadley circulation near the\nEquator. Themquasi=geostrophic system has the computational advantage of automatically filtering gravity\nwiives.\nAtmospheric motion which cannot be correctly simulated by quasi-geostrophic systems includes the class of\nequatorial waves known to force the quasi-biennial oscillation in the mean wind in the stratosphere (QBO)\nand the atmospheric tides. However, the role of the QBO or tidal motions in the organized transport of ozone\nis uncertain.\n\nSpectral Truncation\nThe transport of ozone appears to be primarily controlled by very large scale waves and the mean circulation\nin the stratosphere, as indicated by both satellite and ground based observations. As a result, most models\nconsider only the lowest spectral harmonics (planetary waves) to represent the horizontal fields, with diffusion coefficients simulating the mixing by higher harmonics. However, it is not clear that spectral models\nwhich include the troposphere can truncate below wavenumber 10 if they are to correctly simulate the general\ncirculation of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere according to Baer and Alyea (1971) and\nMahlman (1975).\nAs an example, typical spectral forecast models use 20 to 25 harmonics to simulate developing synoptic\nbaroclinic disturbances as reported by Daley et al. (1976).\n\nArea Limitations\nHemispheric, mechanistic and P-plane models exclude large regions of the atmosphere in order to focus on\nparticular phenomena and to increase computational speed. Since hemispheric and P-plane models cannot\nsimulate the pole-to-pole solstitial circulation as reported by Leovy (1964) and Schoeberl and Strobe1 (1978a),\nthey are inadequate for representing upper stratospheric transport. Mechanistic models usually treat the\ntroposphere as a fixed-boundary condition, with a climatological tropopause temperature or geopotential\nfield specified at some pressure level. These models can treat transport adequately above the troposphere\nbo.undary, but must specify constituent fluxes as boundary conditions. Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible,\nto use these models to evaluate stratospheric-tropospheric\ninteractions.\nThe level at which the upper boundary is applied is also an area limitation. Most of the models in table 2-1,\nwhich calculate the pole-to-pole zonally averaged circulation of the upper stratosphere, under-represent its\nstructure by placing a rigid lid where the meridional velocity maximizes. As a result, the vertical velocities in\nthe polar mesosphere and upper stratosphere are too weak, and the meridional temperature reversal in the\nmesosphere does not occur. This assumption produces a polar night jet in the mean wind which increases in\nstrength up to the upper boundary and, in turn, affects the planetary wave computations. Schoeberl and\nStrobe1 (1978a) find that the zonally averaged circulation can be correctly computed by placing the upper\nboundary in the 110 to 130 km region. Other procedures, which do not require a boundary condition at such a\nhigh altitude, are currently under investigation.\n\nRadiation\nTwo radiative processes are important in the stratosphere and mesosphere: insolation by ozone and O,, and\ninfrared cooling by CO,, 0,. and H,O, and trace constituents such as N,O and the chlorofluoromethanes.\n\n76\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nInsolation\nSeveral excellent schemes by Lacis and Hansen (1974) and Strobe1 (1978) accurately treat 0, and 0, insolation. Most models include 0, heating accurately, but few include 0, heating which according to Strobe1\n(1978) is important only above 80 km. Insolation for the troposphere is often treated in an ad-hoc fashion using a Newtonian-type damping approximation. Essentially, a climatological temperature field, T,, is specified\nby observations, and then a heating rate is computed using:\n\nq = QJTC - Tm)\nwhere T, is a temperature required to reproduce the observed heating rates in the troposphere, a, is the relaxation time, and T, is the model temperature. This method is detailed in Cunnold et al. (1975). Clearly, this\nprocedure fixes tropospheric heat sources and prevents any feedback between the stratosphere and\ntroposphere through insolation.\n\nIR Cooling\nThe most popular procedure for assessing the impact of IR cooling on the stratosphere is, again, the Newtonian cooling approximation,\nq=a,T+b\nwhere T is temperature and b is the background rate. Most investigators use the rates derived by Dickinson\n(1973b) for the 1962 standard atmosphere. Unfortunately, the background rates vary considerably with the\ninitial temperature profile, and the a0 values may be in error by 20% or more for disturbances where the\ntemperature varies from 10 to 20 K according to Ramanathan and Grose (1978). This variation is caused by\nthe neglect of radiative exchange in the Newtonian cooling formalism. Other, more elaborate, but still computationally efficient IR models have been developed by Ramanathan (1976) and Fels and Schwarzkopf\n(1975, 1980) which include exchange, and are currently being installed in some quasi-geostrophic models.\nThe importance of IR processes has been demonstrated by Dunkerton (1978) who showed how the BrewerDobson circulation for ozone is basically a function of the radiative imbalance in the stratosphere. This result\nis a clear example of how the Lagrangian-mean transport of trace constituents is influenced by external\nsources of heat and momentum, not by the eddy fluxes. Thus, it appears important that the radiative processes be treated accurately if ozone transport is to be correctly assessed.\nFew models listed in table 2-l explicitly calculate the total photochemical response of ozone in addition to\ntransport. One reason for this is that the photochemical time constant above 40 km is faster than the transport\ntime scale. Thus, within the sharp transition region (40 to 45 km), the time step of the model is dictated by fast\nphotochemistry, so that computational costs increase. Above 50 km, photochemical equilibrium can be\nassumed.\nIn models which do not explicitly calculate the transport of O,, the dynamic-photochemical-radiative\nfeedback mechanism is often parameterized by a photochemical acceleration which has the same functional form\nas Newtonian cooling. Values by Blake and Lindzen (1973) for the photochemical acceleration parameter\nhave recently been modified by the inclusion of radiative feedback by Hartmann (1978) and Strobe1 (1979).\nDirect calculation of ozone mixing ratio with quasi-geostrophic models has been made only by Cunnold et al.\n(1975); and Clark (1970). Even with these models, only a few representative reactions have been used because\ncalculations quickly become too time consuming. Nevertheless, direct calculation is the only realistic technique for assessing the total impact of chemical pollutants on the ozone layer.\n\nn\n\nMOdELS\n\n77\n\nSummary\nExisting 2-D and 3-D quasi-geostrophic models of the atmosphere have provided considerable information on\nthe dynamics of the stratosphere. Yet, none of these models currently has the capability of realistically\nforecasting the impact of atmospheric pollutants on ozone. The chief problem areas are:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nInadequate or inflexible assumptions are used to compute IR processes. Since the Lagrangian-mean motion of constituents in the upper stratosphere appears to depend on heat sources and sinks, these processes must be accurately represented.\nSpectral truncation may be too severe to represent the cross-tropopause mass exchange and lower\nstratosphere poleward transport by transient eddies. Since the cross-tropopause exchange is the process\nby which ground-released pollutants reach the stratosphere, it is critical that synoptic disturbances be\ncorrectly modeled. Spectral models should contain at least 10 or more zonal and meridional harmonics\nto represent such exchange or suitable parameterizations should be developed for transport by high\nwavenumber components.\nUpper boundaries are too low. The upper boundary must be located well above the stratopause to adequately represent the upper stratospheric-mesospheric pole-to-pole circulation.\nChemistry is poorly represented. More chemical reactions must be considered in the calculation\nozone mixing ratios.\n\nof\n\nHowever, all of these problem areas can be resolved, and good predictions can be made at moderate cost with\ntruncated spectral or semispectral models which are within the range of current technology. Furthermore,\nquasi-geostrophic models have the additional advantages of computational efficiency and simplicity, which\nallow numerical experiments that can isolate and determine the mechanisms of selected stratospheric\nphenomena.\n\nTHREE-DIMENSIONAL\n\nPRIMITIVE EQUATIONS MODELING\n\nIn the previous sections, the motivation, methodology, and status of simplified models of the stratosphere\nhave been outlined. Those results present a larger question: at the present time, to what extent is it possible to\nconstruct a credible, comprehensive and self-consistent model of the radiation, chemistry, and dynamics of\nthe entire stratospheric system?\nIt is most important to establish that no such model currently exists, or will exist in the foreseeable future.\nHowever, significant progress is occurring in the development and evaluation of models which appear to be\nsufficient at the present level of knowledge. Even the most comprehensive and sophisticated models still contain important simplifications and idealizations.\nIt is important that the scientific community continue to develop comprehensive state-of-the-art stratospheric\nmodels. At the present time, this state-of-the-art level is defined by the so-called 3-D primitive equations\ngeneral circulation model (GCM). The GCM is usually considered to be an attempt to provide a fully selfconsistent numerical model of the atmospheric dynamical system. Since such fully self-consistent models are\nnot currently obtainable, the GCMs tend to differ from models mentioned previously, mainly in their degree\nof self-consistency and their relative credibility.\nTraditionally, GCMs have attempted to incorporate reasonably complete and self-consistent dynamical and\nradiative transfer calculations (although many significant approximations are made in both). On the other\n\n78\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nhand, the ocean temperature, permanent ice caps, and the distribution of radiatively important trace constituents (except water vapor) have usually been incorporated as prescribed quantities. Some of these prescribed\nquantities are currently being relaxed in various models.\nTo achieve a fully self-consistent description of the stratosphere, it is necessary that ozone be self-determined\nin the model. This implies that other trace constituents must be calculated as well. Because of the major\nchemical uncertainties and the increasing computational burden, some or many of the important trace species\nmust be specified so that they are consistent with available observations.\nA stratospheric GCM must include the troposphere as well, since the troposphere supplies significant\nmechanical energy to the stratosphere. In addition, the transfer of radiative energy and the exchange of mass\nand trace constituents between the stratosphere and troposphere are important. For such a model to serve also\nas a climate model in the usual sense, the thermodynamic properties of the surface boundary must be selfconsistently determined (i.e., the ocean-surface temperature and ice content must be calculated in the model).\nTo perform this properly in any model remains a most difficult task. Aspects of climatic change in the\nstratosphere appear to be largely independent of longer-term variations of the lower boundary. Thus, a GCM\nemploying prescribed ocean-surface temperatures and ice caps might serve as an excellent model for climate\nchange in the stratosphere, while being incapable of calculating climatic changes at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\n\nModeling of Various Physical and Dynamical Processes\nIn attempting to model radiation, chemistry, or dynamics in a GCM, the computational difficulties are formidable. Substantial computational simplifications must be made in all three areas. However, at current\nlevels of understanding, such simplifications are reasonable and efficient because substantial uncertainties remain in the physical understanding that are not necessarily reduced by increased computational capacity.\nRadiative transfer enters the problem in several ways, the most obvious being the calculation of local\ntemperature changes caused by non-adiabatic heating effects. A complete calculation is very lengthy, because\nof the requirement to provide integrations over the applicable parts of the electromagnetic spectrum for each\nradiatively active atmospheric constituent. In addition, the effects of scattering and absorption by particles\nmust be considered. Fortunately, a number of simplified techniques have been developed, e.g. Lacis and\nHansen (1974) and Fels and Schwarzkopf (1975, 1980), that can produce accurate calculations (relative to the\nachievable accuracy) at a small fraction of the cost of more complete calculations.\nChemistry enters the problem mainly because sources and sinks of ozone, a radiatively active gas, must be\nknown. The complete chemistry of ozone requires consideration of a number of other trace constituents,\nmany of whose sources and sinks remain uncertain. Also, much of the chemistry governing the relationships\nbetween constituents and groups of constituents is known only approximately.\nEven in the presence of these uncertainties, substantial improvements in computational requirements are\npossible. These can be accomplished through a number of assumptions and approximations, some excellent\nand some questionable: (1) grouping of constituents into internally coupled chemical families; (2) simplifications in the photodissociation calculations; (3) prescribing or adjusting less important trace constituents (or\nthose with very long time scales); (4) averaging over the diurnal cycle as performed by Kurzeja (1975); and (5)\ninfrequent calculation of slowly varying quantities. Many of these simplifications require parameterizations\nof other processes.\nComplete calculations of the dynamica structure of the atmosphere are overwhelmingly complex. The spectrum of observable motions varies from length scales of a centimeter to the size of the planet itself. Fortunately, observations have indicated that most of the energy of atmospheric motions is contained in the larger\nscales, i.e., those existing on scales greater than hundreds of kilometers. However, important exceptions occur, particularly in convective clouds, frontal type phenomena, gravity waves, and clear-air turbulence. The\nmost serious exceptions occur in the troposphere. (Most of the energy in the stratosphere is on even larger\n\nMODELS\n\n79\n\nspatial scales than in the troposphere.) Hopefully, stratospheric dynamical processes can be properly defined\nthrough use of less computational resolution than that required for the troposphere; however, it is not yet\nclear that this is the case. Proper simulation of trace constituent transfer in the stratosphere, cross-tropopause\nflux of water vapor, equatorial wave-mean flow interactions, and simulation of the tropospheric long waves\nand cyclone scale waves that propagate to the stratosphere appear to be significantly sensitive to model spatial\nresolution. Only careful experimentation and analysis of models employing hierarchies of resolutions can address the question of the minimum spatial resolution required for a given problem. This is an important consideration simply because the computational requirements increase very rapidly with increases in spatial\nresolution.\nEven though most of the energy is contained in the larger scales, a successful dynamical model must take into\naccount unresolved scales and processes through parameterization. Particularly critical in this regard are the\nparameterization schemes for convection, precipitation, and dissipation. In each case, fully satisfactory\nmethods have yet to be developed. As described in an earlier section, atmospheric transport of trace constituents depends to some degree on these processes. Studies to date suggest that GCM transport results are not\nsensitive to uncertainties in these types of parameterizations. Further work is required.\n\nModeling Approaches and Efforts\nFor a GCM, a reasonably complete description usually implies that the dynamical processes be calculated using the so-called primitive equations. In this sense, primitive equations means the fluid equations of motion\nscaled in an energetically consistent manner to eliminate deviations from local hydrostatic equilibrium from\nthe equation set. For the large-scale motions of the atmosphere, it is a superb approximation, and this restriction is used in all known GCMs.\nThe descriptions of GCMs have not made any reference to the numerical algorithms used to solve the\ndynamical equations. The various methods available (such as finite difference, spectral transform, pseudospectral, and finite element) have all been employed in dynamical problems with varying levels of success. The\nchoice of a particular approach is related to: (1) the character of the problem under emphasis, (2) the computational burden, (3) the coordinate system, and (4) the personal preferences of the investigator. Each approach appears to possess major liabilities when applied to the complete general circulation problem. At this\nstage, no method appears to possess a clear advantage over all others. It appears that a continued and expanded diversity of approaches in GCM research will enhance longer term progress.\nTo date, there have been a number of successes in simulating the structure of the stratosphere.

This list is also indicative of the\nmagnitude of atmospheric processes generally neglected in one- and two-dimensional models. Our atmosphere is exceedingly complex to model and will remain a challenge to atmospheric scientists for many\nyears. However, suitably constructed models have been and are continuing to be major tools for investigating\nthe effects of stratospheric pollution.\n\nIllIIIIlllllIlllI\nI\n\nCHAPTER 3\nBUDGETS\nINTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the current knowledge of the sources, sinks, and distributions of those atmospheric\nspecies that are important in determining the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere. These species are\nthe halocarbons, nitrous oxide, odd-nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and non-methane\nhydrocarbons, and sulfur compounds.\n\nHALOCARBONS\nSOURCES\nThe measured tropospheric concentrations for a variety of chlorocarbons at the end of 1977 (Singh et al.,\n1978; 1979a) and over a 3-year period (Rasmussen, private communication) are given in tables 3-1 and 3-2\nrespectively. Many of these are produced industrially; some are naturally occurring; most contribute to the\nhalogen content of the stratosphere. The halocarbons found in amounts greater than 50 ppt, CCl,F, CCl,F,,\nCcl,, CH,CCl,, and CH,Cl, are considered in more detail in the following sections.\n\nNatural Sourcesof Halocarbons\nAll the chlorofluorocarbons\nidentified in the atmosphere are considered to come primarily from man-made\nsources, and there is little or no evidence to believe otherwise. CF4 is a molecule whose sources are yet to be\ncharacterized, but several anthropogenic sources have been identified (Cicerone, 1979). Currently, the\npossibility of natural sources cannot be ruled out.\nAmong the chlorinated (nonfluorinated)\nspecies, there is little doubt that the dominant sources are manmade. From time-to-time, suggestions have been made that natural sources of Ccl,, CHCl,, CH,Clz, and\neven CH,CCl, may exist. Most of these suggestions have been speculative, and in the course of time have been\nconsiderably weakened. In the case of Ccl,, it now appears that the atmospheric reservoir is largely an accumulation of man-made emissions (Molina and Rowland, 1974; Singh et al., 1976; Galbally, 1976). The\npossibility of small natural sources of Ccl, cannot be completely ruled out, although none is known to exist.\nThere is evidence (although scant) that oceans are not such a source. The problem of CHCl, and CH,Cl, is\ncomparable to that for CCl4. At present the atmospheric burden of CHCl, and CH,Cl, is poorly\ncharacterized-large\nman-made sources exist and no natural source has been identified.\nHowever, methyl chloride, CH,Cl has a large atmospheric reservoir. Accumulation over a long time period is\nnot possible because of its short lifetime (2 to 3 years). The data from the Southern Hemisphere is highly\nlimited (Singh et al., 1977), but it appears that the north-south gradient is extremely small. The large reservoir, the uniform distribution, the short lifetime, and the lack of large man-made emissions indirectly point to\na natural source. The nature of the source or sources has never been adequately characterized. The two major\nsources appear to be (1) the oceanic source and (2) the burning of vegetation, but their quantitative contributions are undefined. Preliminary measurements of Lovelock (1975) and Singh et al. (1979a), clearly\ndemonstrate the existence of a natural oceanic source. This source is poorly characterized (Zafiriou, 1975),\nbut may turn out to be the dominant source of CH,CI. Little work has been done to determine production of\nCH,Cl from the burning of vegetation. Simplistic analysis of data and simple models (Cicerone et al., 1975;\nYung et al., 1975; and Graedel, 1979) require a source of 3 tg per year of CH,Cl and no more than 10% of\nthat source is man-made. The evidence that CH,Cl is indeed a component of the natural atmosphere is strong,\nbut additional research is needed to better characterize its sources.\n83\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n84\n\nTable 3-l\nBackground Concentrations of Halocarbons\nat the End of 1977\n\nCompound\n\n-1\n\nCClaF, (FC-12)\nCClsF (FC-11)\nCClaFCClFa (FC-113)\nCClFaCClFa (FC-114)\nCHClaF (FC-21)\ncc14\nCHsCCla\nCH, Cl\nCH,I\nCHCla\nCHaCla\nCaHCls\nc2c14\n\nAverage Concentration*\n(ppt1-I\nS.

The north-south distributions of these, even though poorly defined, appear to be consistent\nwith man-made sources in the Northern Hemisphere. The knowledge of brominated and iodated halocarbons\nis considerably poorer than for the chlorinated species. The only two brominated species detected in the atmosphere are CH3Br and CH2BrCH2Br. There is little doubt that the latter is all man-made, but the former\nappears to also have natural sources. Neither the atmospheric distribution nor the sources of CH3Br have\nbeen studied in detail.\nThere is some evidence of an oceanic source of CHJBr, but quantitative data are lacking. The only iodated\norganic identified in the air is CH,I and this appears to come primarily from the oceans. The data base is virtually nonexistent-there\nis some doubt as to the identity of CH,I, and lack of measurements in ocean water\nmake it impossible to assess its natural sources. It should also be added that because of its very short lifetime\n(a few days), CH,I is of little interest for understanding the chemistry of the stratosphere.\n\nIndustrial Sourcesof Halocarbons\nValues for the United States production of major halocarbons are available through United States Tariff\nCommission reports and are believed to be accurate to within +5%, but world production figures are\ngenerally less accurate. For the particular cases of CCl,F (FC-11) and CCl,F, (FC-12), a concerted effort by\nthe major manufacturers has produced accurate (+5%) worldwide production figures (A.D. Little, Inc.,\n1975; Manufacturing Chemists Association Technical Panel, 1978a, b; McCarthy et al., 1977; CMA, 1979).\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n86\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nAtmospheric release is much more difficult to determine and must be assessed for each material on the basis\nof use. Assessments of this type have been carried out for the halocarbon industry (Bauer, 1978a; Galbally,\n1976; and McConnell and Schiff, 1978). For most compounds, about half of the release was in the United\nStates.\nAccurate data for the production and release to the atmosphere of CCl,F and CCl,F, have been published by\nMcCarthy et al. (1977). Release to the atmosphere is estimated as being close to 85% of the amount produced\nat any given time; this value was obtained by breaking down sales in terms of end use (refrigeration, aerosols,\nclosed-cell foam, etc.) and combining it with a release pattern for each application. For example, CCl,F, used\nin domestic refrigerators is released slowly, whereas aerosol propellants are released quickly. Total world\nrelease to the atmosphere by the end of 1978 was 3.73 tg of CCl,F and 5.48 tg of CCl,F, (CMA, 1979).\nOverall estimates of release to the atmosphere are probably accurate to *5%. World production and release\ngrew exponentially up to about 1973. Since 1973 the release has been nearly constant; recent production has\n--:-\xe2\x80\x9c&:A\xe2\x80\x9d\\.\nbeen as follows I\n\n2.\nYear\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n1978\n\nP. +The\n\nFC-11\n354.3\n377.6\n322.5\n349.9\n330.7\n307.9\n\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\n\nunits in the table of CFM production\nFC-12\n447.5\n473.6\n419.7\n449.8\n424.4\n401.2\n\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\n\nare 109 g, not tg.\nFC-22\n78.7\n90.2\n76.0\n94.2\n101.9\n\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\ntg\n\nCHF$l\n(FC-22), CFCl,CF,Cl (FC-113), CF$lCF,Cl\n(FC-114), and CF,CF,Cl (FC-115) are produced in\nsmall amounts. Of these CHF,Cl occurs in the largest volume; world production through the end of 1977 for\nuses other than as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals being 1 tg (Manufacturing Chemists\nAssociation, 1978b), approximately l/lOth of the combined CCl,F and CCl,F, production. World production and release of FC-22 on a year by year basis to the end of 1977 has been reported by Jesson (private communication) as given above.\nCurrently, Ccl, is manufactured largely as an intermediate for the production of CCl,F and CCl,F,. The use\nof Ccl, for other purposes (solvent applications, fire extinguishing applications, fumigating agents, etc.) has\ndeclined significantly since the 1950s. Values for its production and atmospheric emission through 1976 have\nbeen estimated by several groups (Galbally, 1976; Singh et al. 1976; and Parry, 1977) and show considerable\nscatter. Release of CC14 in recent years is only a small fraction of total production and could, therefore, be\nsubject to large errors. Total worldwide production is also somewhat uncertain. The estimates of Galbally\nassume that the only significant production between 1914 and 1955 was in the United States, United\nKingdom, France, and Germany. Estimates for later dates include Japan and other European countries. No\ndata are available for the USSR and China. These emission estimates were obtained by subtracting Ccl, production used as a feedstock and assuming that 90% of the remainder is lost to the atmosphere. Linear interpolation was used to obtain estimates for those years where no production and usage figures were available.\nAn uncertainty figure of + 30% was given for the final estimates.\nProduction and release figures for methyl chloroform are given by Neely and Plonka (1978). Industrial production of methyl chloride is not a significant source.\n\n87\n\nBUDGETS\n\nTROPOSPHERIC ORGANIC HALOGEN BURDEN\nTable 3-3 provides total tropospheric budgets of organic Cl, Br, I, and F, and indicates the source contributions (Singh et al., 1979a). It is clear that the global average tropospheric Cl concentration (organic) in late\n1977 was 2.7 ppb. The possibility that unknown sources of tropospheric chlorine exist cannot be completely\ndismissed, but measurements of total organic chlorine (Berg and Winchester, 1977) do not support the existence of large unknown Cl sources. Using a 1-D model, it is possible to estimate the contributions of the\nvarious chlorocarbons to the background in the upper stratosphere. A current estimate is:\nCH,Cl\nccl,\nCH,CCl,\nHCl\nCC1,F\nCCl,F,\n\n0.56ppb .\n0.50 ppb\n0.29 ppb\n0.16 ppb\n\nTotal\n\n2.13 ppb\n\n0.62 ppb\n\nOf the Cl total of 2.7 ppb, about 77 percent is man-made and the remaining 23 percent appears to be of\nnatural origin.\nTable 3-3\nTropospheric Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine and\nFluorine Organic Budgets in 1978\nCompiled by Singh and Cicerone (Private Communication)\n\nBudgets\n\nPercentage\nSource\nContributions\n(\xe2\x80\x9cro)\n\nThe organic bromine and iodine budgets are much more uncertain. Measurements by Singh et al. (1979a) suggest only two brominated species CH,Br and CH2BrCH2Br. Even for these two species the data base is sparse\n(see table 3-l). A preliminary interpretation suggests an organic Br content of 5 to 30 ppt, of which 50 to 90%\nmay be of natural origin (table 3-3).\nThere are no obvious significant sources of organic iodine, but loss of iodine-rich materials from the marine\naerosol is possible. The only species currently identified is methyl iodide, which is present at a concentration\nof about 2 to 5 ppt in the marine boundary layer. The tropospheric mean concentration of CH,I is expected to\nbe much less than 2 ppt. The atmospheric residence time of CH,I is about 5 days.\n\nII lIIllIIllIlI\nII\n\n88\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe chlorine, bromine, and iodine budgets are contrasted with the budget for fluorine, which shows approximately 1 ppb of fluorine almost entirely attributed to man-made sources. There is a real possiblity that other\nsources of organic bromine and iodine are yet to be identified. Special emphasis should be devoted to the\nidentification of new species and better characterization of those already measured.\n\nTropospheric Concentration of CCl,F\nThere have been extensive measurements of CCl,F over a period of eight years, mostly at midlatitude\ntions of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nloca-\n\nMeasurements by Singh et al. (1978, 1979a), Rasmussen (private communication 1979), and by Pack et al.\n(1977) show that local variability is small at remote points in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e., points well\nremoved from sources of release). These measurements may reasonably be assumed to represent background\nconcentrations at their respective locations. Measurements (Singh et al., 1978, 1979a; Rasmussen, private\ncommunication,\n1979) at relatively remote locations in the Northern Hemisphere suggest that Northern\nHemisphere background concentrations are less than 20% above the Southern Hemisphere background. The\nSouth/North ratios of approximately 0.5 found by Pack et al. between Capetown (35 \xe2\x80\x9cS) and Adrigole (51 \xe2\x80\x9cN)\nsuggest that a significant contribution to the Adrigole measurements is arising from local sources. It appears\nthat with careful selection of a number of locations and repeated measurement over a significant period of\ntime, reliable samplings of background air could be obtained.\nThe results of an interlaboratory calibration exercise for CCl,F (Rasmussen, 1978b) involving 16 blind determinations are given in table 3-4. The extremes of the range, for a single standard sample, were 120 and 176\nppt, and, although 8 of the measurements were within 6 ppt of the nominal value (150 ppt), 5 of the\nmeasurements were at the 120 ppt extreme (20% below the nominal value). Comparison results for CCl,F,,\nCH,CCl, and Ccl, intercalibrations are also given in table 3-4. Here the results were even less satisfactory.\nThe highest CCl,F, value was 45% above the nominal value. The overall scatter was worse for these three\ncompounds than for CCl,F.\nAdditionally, comparison of the data in Tables 3-l and 3-2 shows that Rasmussen finds a global CCl,F concentration of 151 ppt for 1977, while Singh et al. (1978) finds a value of 126 for the end of 1977. Clearly, both\nnumbers cannot be correct. Although the two observations differ by only 20% the tropospheric lifetimes derived from these values are infinity and 30 years respectively.\nA further comparison, which is important to the discussion of interhemispheric gradients which follows, is\nbetween Rasmussen data (Table 3-2), and Pack et al. (1977) Southern Hemisphere data for 1976. Pack et al.\nfound 85 to 95 ppt CCl,F at Capetown in mid 1976 (consistent with many earlier measurements taken at this\nlocation over a period of 4 years) while Rasmussen\xe2\x80\x99s Southern Hemisphere value for 1976 was 127 ppt.\nFigure 3-l shows the global distribution of many halocarbons for late 1977. For all stable halogenated species\n(CCl,F, (FC-12), CCl,F (FC-11), CCl,FCClF, (FC-113), CClF,CClF, (FC-114), and Ccl,) the average concentration in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere differs by only 10 to 15% (Singh et al.,\n1979a). This small North/South difference is also in agreement with the results of Rasmussen (private communication, 1979) and Tyson et al. (1978a). These results appeared to be in conflict with the earlier data obtained by Lovelock et al. (1973) on a voyage of the Shackleton from North to South and back in 1971 and\n1972. Cunnold et al. (1978) have pointed out two factors that could make the data compatible: (1) the higher\nfluorocarbon concentrations over the Atlantic relative to the Pacific because of transport of fluorocarbons\nreleased in the United States and Europe, and (2) the fact that exchange between the hemispheres occurs\nmainly in the upper troposphere. They analyzed the problem on the basis of an 8 box model (4 latitudinally by\n2 vertically). They estimate the unpolluted background S/N ratio to be about 0.8, but that it could be as low\nas 0.5 when proximity to source of locations in the North is taken into account. The corresponding value in\nthe upper troposphere is 0.89, with a midlatitude Southern Hemisphere value in the upper troposphere of 0.94\ntimes the global average.\n\n89\n\nBUDGETS\n\nTable 3-4\nHalocarbon Results Returned from Participating Laboratories*\n\nSample\nNo.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nCClz Fz\nppt v/v\n\nCCla F\nPPt v/v\n\nCH,CC13\nppt v/v\n\nCCl\xe2\x80\x98q\nPPt v/v\n\n243\n2.8%\n246\n1.6%\n.223\n10.8%\n250\n0%\n\n145\n3.3%\n136\n9.3%\n120\n20.0%\n148\n1.3%\n145\n3.3%\n149\n0.7%\n150\n0%\n176\n17.3%\n120\n20.0%\n1.50\n0%\n141\n6.0%\n156\n4.0%\n124\n17.3%\n145\n3.3%\n123\n18.0%\n120\n20.0%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n97\n\n167\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n227\n9.2%\n246\n1.6%\n322\n28.8%\n250\n0%\n362\n44.8%\n249\n0%\n\n12\n13\n\n224\n10.4%\n\n14\n15\n16\n\n243\n2.8%\n204\n18.4%\n\n100\n\n144\n\n-\n\n130\n\n112\n\n105\n\n-\n\n-\n\n80\n\n120\n\n103\n\n108\n\n130\n\n71\n\n37\n\n126\n\n106\n\n122\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n30\n\n321\n\n*The % figures are percent difference from the submitted value.\n\nII\n\nI II I\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n90\n\n160\n\n210+\n\nH\n\n-400\n\n.,.,.,,,\xe2\x80\x99\n\n,;______\n-&$&JJp-~*-.-~~-\n\nem-\n\n-\n\n, .,,,.,.\n\n(25.1)*\n\nPPt\n\n230+\n\n(25.5)\n\nppt\n\n51,\n\n-\n\n2\n0\xe2\x80\x9d 50-\n\nG\xe2\x80\x9d Mo . __________ >=&~-**+-\xe2\x80\x98---\n\n0\n\nllQ(4.0)\n\n0\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98.I.\xe2\x80\x9c,\n\npp?\n\n8\n\n122(4.9)\n\n(\n\n\xe2\x80\x98,\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99,.,-\n\n2oo-l\xe2\x80\x9d~I~I~\n\n3xc\n\n8\n\n119(11.7)ppt\n\n-200\ni\n\n133(13.4)\n\nppt\n\n-\n\nO\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nppt\n\n113\xe2\x80\x99\n\nPP1\n\n5. ,**\xe2\x80\x98,---~-\xe2\x80\x98~\n-\xe2\x80\x9cloo\n\n,__ ___________ ,.&&.&---~-+-~.~\n100 -\n\n77\xe2\x80\x99\n\n160 -\n\n3\n\nppl\n\ni\n\n-\n\n5. \xe2\x80\x98I.... ____________\n>;:+~i-----!\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x98.,,I\n\n1wowlW3.1)\n\nppt\n\n19(3.5)\n\nppt\n\ns\nv,ooo\n\n_\n\n6\xe2\x80\x995\n\n(103.01\n\nppt\n\n611\n\nppt\n\n(63.7)\n\n40 -\n\nTJ\n\n13M PPb \xe2\x80\x98430\n(51.4)1 (64.7)PPb\n]\n6\n0.5(0.1)\n\nt\n\n&y.W\xe2\x80\x99\nS\n\nFigure\n\n3-l.\n\nGlobal distributions\n\nof atmospheric\n\nPPb\n\n-.50- -400\n\nconstituents\n\nl.l\xe2\x80\x99mb\n\n-200\nLatltudc\n\n00\n\n20\xe2\x80\x99\n(dcg)\n\n400\n\n60.\n\n.wsa~\nN\n\n(Singh et al., 1979a)\n\nKey: ppt = IO-l2 (volume/volume);\nppb = IO-\xe2\x80\x99 (volume/volume);\n(7) is the average\nconcentration in the hemisphere; (+) is the standard deviation; (*) indicates that\nfor species where a significant gradient within each hemisphere is observed the\nweighted average concentration is defined to represent the total burden of the\nspecies in that hemisphere; V, trip 1, stainless steel vessels; A, trip 1, glass vessels;\n0, trip 2, stainless steel vessels;and 0, trip 2, in-situ air-sampling and analysis.

If it is correct, it leads\nto the conclusion that the Lovelock southern data (lower troposphere) at any given time should correspond to\nthe global mean concentration multiplied by a factor of approximately 0.93, while the Rasmussen southern\ndata (upper troposphere) should correspond to the global mean concentration multiplied by a factor of approximately 0.94. In other words, at any given time, the two sets of data should agree in the Southern\nHemisphere, with the Lovelock data being higher than the Rasmussen data in the Northern Hemisphere due\nboth to proximity to sources of release and to the tropospheric circulation patterns. Figure 3-2 shows a\nSouthern value of 85 to 95 ppt for Lovelock for midi1976; this translates into an approximate global mean of\n90/0.93 or 97 ppt.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI-\n\nI\n\nI-\n\n100\n\n80\n60\n\n40\n\n0\nLJ\n\nNRL\n\n0\n\n20\n\nLOVELOCK\n\nwsu\n\nCD NOAA\n.\n10\n1971\n\nI\n1972\n\nA\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1973\n\n1974\n\nNASA\ncwlq\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\n,\n1977\n\nYEAR\nFigure 3-2.

NASA\n(Inn et al., 19771, WSU (Rasmussen and Krasnec, 1977, and private\ncommunication),\nNRL (Naval Research Laboratory), CSIRO (Fraser and\nPearman, 1978).\n\n1978\n\n92\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nOn the other hand, the Rasmussen Southern Hemisphere data (also shown in figure 3-2) give values of approximately 127 ppt for 1976 leading to a global estimate of 130 ppt.\nAssuming the Cunnold et al. (1978) analysis is correct, there is a systematic absolute calibration difference\nbetween the Lovelock and Rasmussen groups, with the Rasmussen data being uniformly higher. The Singh et\nal. (1979a) data lie between the other two sets (see tables 3-l and 3-2 and figure 3-2).\n\nConcentrations of Other Fluorocarbons\nTable 3-2 shows global average concentrations for CCl,FCClF, (FC-113) at 18 ppt; CClF,CClF, (FC-114) at\n11 ppt; and CHCl,F (FC-21) at 4 ppt. Based on production, CHClF, (FC-22) might be expected to be the\nmost abundant fluorocarbon after FC-11 and FC-12. However, it is subject to attack by OH (limiting its\ntropospheric lifetime), and in addition, it is difficult to detect by electron capture gas chromatography. No\nreliable estimates of the atmospheric concentration of FC-22 are available.\nOf the three other fluorocarbons which were detected, FC-113 and FC-114 are produced industrially.\nPresumably their concentrations can be roughly accounted for on the basis of historical release. On the other\nhand, FC-21 is not produced commercially and total release from industrial sources could account for only\n0.03 ppt (Glasgow et al., 1978).\nFC-21 has now been detected by a number of groups (Singh, 1978; Cronn, 1978; Rasmussen, 1978a; Bruner,\nprivate communication, 1979) and has been unambiguously identified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (Crescentini and Bruner, 1979).\nIt has been suggested that FC-21 may arise from Teflon out-gassing in the measuring equipment. This seems\nunlikely on the basis of the following studies: FC-21 is still detected in Teflon-free equipment (Rasmussen,\n1978a); no increase in FC-21 is observed when the gas from large amounts of finely divided Teflon is sampled\n(Rasmussen, 1978a); there is no indication in the manufacture, chemistry, or industrial experience with\nTeflon that FC-21 is a contaminant (Glasgow et al., 1978).\nAusloos et al. (1977) have observed the formation of CHCl,F following irradiation of CCI,F with near-UV\nlight (3OOnm<X<4OOnm) in the presence of sand. Although the size of this effect in terms of a possible\ntropospheric sink has not been determined, it could provide evidence for conversion of CC1,F into CHCl,F.\nThus, if FC-21 is a real atmospheric constituent, it could be a degradation product of FC-11. In any case, at a\nconcentration of 1 ppt the FC-21 present could not represent a significant FC-11 sink.\nAn alternative suggestion is that FC-21 arises from decomposition of FC-11 on the chromatographic columns, or from degradation of stored FC-I1 standards. Either of these explanations would raise questions\nabout the accuracy of current FC-11 measurements.\nTables 3-l and 3-2 give measured atmospheric concentrations for Ccl,. Unlike the fluorocarbons, CC14 is\nuniformly distributed, presumably because the growth of emissions over the last decade has been relatively\nsmall. Because of uncertainties in the release figures for Ccl,, it is difficult to determine whether all the current atmospheric burden is of industrial origin. The observation of elevated Ccl, concentrations in urban\nareas is evidence for continued industrial emission (Singh et al., 1977), as is the observation of an apparent\ngrowth rate of approximately 2% per year in the atmospheric background concentration (Singh et al., 1979a).\nCH,CCI, is the only abundant measured industrial halocarbon subject to attack by tropospheric\nsignificant rate:\nCH,CCl,\n\n+ OH - H,O + CH,CCl,\n\nOH at a\n\n93\n\nBUDGETS\nFor this reason, most of the studies of the tropospheric concentration\ndirect route to estimating tropospheric OH concentrations.\n\nof CH,CCl,\n\nhave been used as an in-\n\nSingh has attributed the fairly sharp change in the latitude gradient for CH,CCl, between 2O\xe2\x80\x9dN and 20\xe2\x80\x9ds to\nthe high tropospheric OH concentration and temperature in this region. The much larger interhemispheric\ndifference (50% in table 3-l) than is observed for background FC-11 and FC-12 (less than 20%) could suggest\na latitude-dependent removal mechanism. However, it must be noted in this regard that the hemispheric difference found by Rasmussen (private communication, 1979) for CH,CCl, is smaller (24% in table 3-2). Current estimates suggest that the tropospheric lifetime of CH,CCl, is approximately 8 years, but the uncertainties in this lifetime are large.\n\nREMOVAL MECHANISMS FOR CHLOROCARBONS IN THE TROPOSPHERE\nRemoval processes in the troposphere would be significant if their rate approaches or exceeds the overall rate\nof removal via stratospheric photolysis. However, that removal is a slow process. In the case of CHsCCl,,\nremoval by OH is clearly a process which effectively competes with stratospheric photolysis.\nIn the case of fully halogenated hydrocarbons, processes of comparable efficiency have not yet been established. The NAS report (1976) identified three removal processes for FC-11 and FC-12 which are believed to\nwarrant more study: (1) solution in surface waters (estimated lower limit on removal time approximately 100\nyears), (2) ion-molecule reactions (1000 years), and (3) photodissociation in the troposphere (5000 years). As\nthey stand, none of these is likely to present significant competition to stratospheric photolysis.\nSingh et al. (1979a) have investigated the possibility that the ocean might act as a sink for Ccl,. They estimate\nthis sink to be about half as effective as the stratospheric photolysis sink. This leads to residence times in the\n25 to 40 year range.\nThe only sink of possible interest for FC-11 and FC-12, which has been suggested since the NAS report, is\ndecomposition on the surface of sand particles (Ausloos et al., 1977). Irradiation of Ccl,, CCl,F, and CCl,F,\nin the presence of C,H, in vessels containing silica sand results in the formation of products containing\nchlorine. The formation of these compounds occurs at wavelengths extending to 400 nm, i.e., at wavelengths\nwhere the solar radiation penetrates to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. More recently, experiments performed in the\npresence of oxygen suggest an apparent rate increase of a factor of approximately 40 (Rebbert, 1978). Additionally, earlier work by Lovelock (1976) has suggested that Ccl, concentrations in the atmosphere are\ndiminished in the vicinity of large bodies of windblown sand; the question of photo- or thermal decomposition of FC-11 and FC-12 on airborne and surface sand (and other surfaces) clearly merits further study.\nHowever, no reliable quantitative estimate of the possible size of the effect is available.\n\nESTIMATION OF THE CCI,F TROPOSPHERIC LIFETIME\nTo date, it is not known whether there are processes in the troposphere which destroy CCl,F at a rate sufficiently fast to compete with photolysis in the stratosphere as a removal process. The existence of such processes might be inferred from calculation of the tropospheric lifetime. There are two approaches to the\ncalculation of this lifetime. One is to estimate the lifetime from determination of the absolute atmospheric\nburden using the accurate production-and-release data discussed previously. The second is to estimate the\nlifetime from analysis of the rate of increase of atmospheric concentration with time. The first approach has\nthe advantage of giving large differences in tropospheric lifetime for different burdens (currently the absolute\nconcentration for an infinite lifetime is about 60% greater than the absolute concentration for a IO-year\nlifetime for CCl,F), but suffers the disadvantages of being quite sensitive to a number of parameters entering\nthe calculation. The second approach is less sensitive, or even insensitive to these parameters, but results in\nsmall growth-rate differences for different tropospheric lifetimes (less than 3% per year between infinite and\nlo-year lifetimes for CCl,F and CCl,F,).\n\n94\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nWhatever the latitude, to allow meaningful estimates of the tropospheric lifetime from absolute burden\nmeasurements the following criteria must be satisfied (Meakin et al,, 1978): (1) The measurements must represent background concentrations at the latitude of measurement (particularly difficult in the Northern\nHemisphere because of proximity to the sources of release). (2) The measurements must be accurately\ncalibrated on an absolute scale. (3) For comparison with model calculations the measurements must be converted to a global average, using latitude correction factors since the background concentration varies as a\nfunction of latitude (or a 2-D model must be used).\nIt is to be noted that calculated concentrations for a particular release scenario are sensitive to the eddy diffusion schemechosen, and that the accuracy of the calculated concentrations also depends on the accuracy of\nthe releasefigures.\nThe problems of obtaining representative background measurements, accurate calibrations,\ndistributions have been discussed earlier in this chapter.\n\nand latitude\n\nStatistics for fluorocarbon release are now believed to be accurate to + 5 %. This is one of the smaller uncertainties in the problem, but must be accounted for in comparing measurements and theory.\nThe stratospheric photolytic sink must be properly taken into account. The effectiveness of this sink is quite\nsensitive to the rate of transport to the stratosphere. For a range of commonly assumed eddy diffusion profiles, Meakin et al. (1978) indicated that calculated lifetime can vary by a factor of 2. The accuracy with which\ntransport of fluorocarbons to the stratosphere must be specified limits the accuracy of tropospheric lifetimes\ncalculated from global burdens.\nWith 2-D models, it should be possible to empirically describe the transport more realistically. Interhemispheric gradients would be expected to be correctly reproduced as well as seasonal effects. Use of a\n2-D model would provide an improved evaluation of tropospheric lifetimes from global burdens. Such\nmodels will soon be available.\nThe combination of these problems in estimating tropospheric lifetime for FC-11 from global burdens, make\nit unlikely that this approach will prove satisfactory in the immediate future. The current best estimatesare infinity from the Rasmussen data, approximately 40 years from the Singh data, and approximately 15 to 20\nyears from the Lovelock data. The estimates based on measurements of Goldan et al. (1979) and Tyson et al.\n(1978b) would also suggest residence times between 40 and 60 years. The sources of error described above\nwould allow a range of possible lifetimes from 10 years to infinity.\nThe difficulties associated with determination of tropospheric lifetimes from absolute atmospheric burdens\nhave lead to the examination of other approaches. The most promising of these is to determine lifetimes from\ntemporal trends in concentration (Cunnold et al., 1978). Cunnold et al. estimated that a network of four stations spaced around the globe could establish a lo-year lifetime from 3 years of observations and a 20-year\nlifetime from observations over a period of 5 years (2a confidence limits) assuming relatively constant production and release.\nA network of four fluorocarbon measuring stations has been established under the auspices of the Manufacturing Chemists Association to acquire long-term fluorocarbon growth-trend data with the specific objective\nof establishing fluorocarbon tropospheric lifetimes. The network has been operating for one year.\n\nLifetime for CCI,F,\nMeasured atmospheric\nsion of concentrations\nmeasurements over a\nessentially unchanged,\n\nconcentrations for CCl,F, are given in tables 3-l and 3-2. Most of the detailed discusand lifetimes has been in terms of CCl,F since there are a large number of CCl,F\nlong period of time. However, all the considerations in the previous section apply,\nto CC12F2except that CCl,F, is inherently less reactive than CFCl, in the troposphere.\n\nr\n\nBUDGETS\n\n95\n\nMeasurements of Singh (table 3-l) suggest overall residence times of approximately 45 years, and correspond\nto a tropospheric lifetime of approximately 80 years, and those of Rasmussen (table 3-2) suggest overall\nresidence times of approximately 100 years and corresponds to a tropospheric lifetime of infinity. The\ntropospheric lifetime of CCl,F, from chemical considerations, is probably greater than that for CCl,F. When\nthe cumulative uncertainties are included, a range of tropospheric lifetimes between 20 years and infinity can\nbe calculated.\n\nNITROUS OXIDE\nINTRODUCTION\nNitrous oxide is thought to originate primarily as a product of microbial metabolism. For many years, it was\nbelieved that the gas was formed primarily during denitrification, but recent works (Elkins et al., 1978; Cohen\nand Gordon, 1978, 1979; Yoshinari, 1976; Bremner and Blackmer, 1978; and Freney et al., 1979) suggest that\nnitrification (microbial oxidation of NH; to NOT) may represent an important source, both in aquatic\nsystems and in soils. Moreover, denitrification\nappears to function as a sink for atmospheric N,O under\nselected conditions (Elkins et al., 1978; Kaplan et al., 1978; Elkins, 1979; and Cohen, 1978).\nStratospheric photolysis represents the largest currently established sink for N,O, accounting for removal of\n10 to 20 tg (N) per year. This flux is quite small compared to global rates for fixation or mineralization of\nnitrogen, and therefore, relatively modest changes in the balance of biospher-ic nitrogen transformations\ncould effect large changes in the source of atmospheric N,O (McElroy et al., 1977; and Johnston, 1977).\nHowever, the view that nitrification may play a central role in the cycle of N,O requires revision of earlier\nconcepts concerning the nature and magnitude of the human influence. A number of investigations are currently underway intended to obtain a quantitative understanding of human influences on nitrification and the\nassociated impacts on sources of N,O to the atmosphere.\nThe following paragraphs contain a brief summary of current knowledge about the atmospheric distribution,\nsinks and sources (both natural and anthropogenic) of N,O.\n\nATMOSPHERIC DISTRIBUTION\nNitrous oxide is distributed uniformly through the troposphere, and under most conditions, it exhibits extremely small short-term variability (Ehhalt et al., 1975; Pierotti and Rasmussen, 1977a, 1979; Singh et al.,\n1979b; Pierotti et al., 1978; Cicerone et al., 1978; and Goldan et al., 1978). The mixing ratio is between 290\nand 335 ppb by volume. This range of values results from inconsistent calibration standards. The uncertainty\ninterferes with attempts to measure long-term trends, since the implication cannot be avoided that at least\nsome existing calibration procedures are subject to systematic errors. Large fluctuations of the atmospheric\nconcentration of N,O, reported by earlier investigators appear to result from instrumental effects, although\nsome studies (e.g., Goody, 1969; and Hahn and Junge, 1977) might reflect true variations of regional scale.\nHowever, nocturnal increases of N,O have been unequivocably observed over active soils under stable atmospheric conditions (Matthias et al., 1979).\nThe uniform concentration observed for N,O in the atmosphere implies a fairly long lifetime for the gas, and\nfurther suggests that its sources and sinks are rather widely dispersed over the globe. According to GCM\nstudies by Levy et al. (1979), the empirical relation between variability and lifetime proposed by Junge (1974)\ndoes not apply to N,O because of the proximity of stratospheric air with low N,O concentrations. Figure 3-3\nshows the calculated global distributions of N,O (Levy et al., 1979) for a model with a completely uniform\nsource for the gas at the ground, and with stratospheric photolysis assumed to be the only sink. The model\npredicts slightly lower concentrations at northern midlatitudes than at corresponding southern locations, due\n\nIllIll\n\nllIllIl I\n\nII\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n96\n\nDEC-JAN-FEE\n\nlATlTUDE\n\nJUN-JUL-AUG\n\nLATITUDE\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nDEC -JAN\n\n- FEB\n\nLATITUDE\n\nJUN-JUL-AUG\n\nLATITUDE\n\nNote: Left-most figures are winter and summer cross sections of zonal mean N,O\nmixing ratios.

The variability of N,O in the model\n(shown on the right-most panels of figure 3-3) is influenced by infrequent events which advect stratospheric\nair into the troposphere. It is interesting to note that the North/South contrast in the model (about 2 ppb at\n40\xe2\x80\x99 latitude) agrees remarkably well with data reported earlier by Pierotti and Rasmussen (1977b) -and Singh\net al. (1979b) (see table 3-5), despite the fact that the concentration differences are so small that the experimenters did not claim to have accurately measured it.\nTable 3-5\nObserved Interhemispheric Differences of NzO\n\nN2O\n\nN20\n(ppbv)\n\n(NorthSouth)\nCwb)\n\nLatitude\n\nAltitude\ne-4\n\n47\xe2\x80\x99N\n45\xe2\x80\x9ds\n\n7.7\n10.8\n\n4-24\xe2\x80\x99N\n4-35Os\n\n0\n0\n\n312\n312.4\n\n-0.4\n\nSingh et al.

In the\nlower stratosphere, the meridional isopleths follow the preferred-mixing surfaces identified from radioactive\ntracer observations and from potential temperature data, as shown in figure 3-4 (Wofsy, 1978; and Logan et\nal., 1978). Above about 30 km, the lifetime of N,O appears to be too short for complete meridional mixing,\nas manifested by sharp variations in concentrations at mid- and high-latitudes. Atmospheric upwelling in the\ntropics is apparently more vigorous above 30 km than is represented in the model of Logan et al. (1978). This\ndeviation is not surprising in light of the fact that the data in figure 3-4 represent the first accurate tracer\nobservations in this part of the atmosphere.\nSINKS FOR ATMOSPHERIC\n\nN,O\n\nStratospheric photolysis and reaction with O(lD) account for removal of about 10 tg of N,O (as nitrogen) per\nyear. The distribution of N,O is now known sufficiently well that a rather accurate calculation of the\nassociated NO, production rates should be possible. But unfortunately, the distribution of total NO, is not\naccurately known, so that it is not clear whether other sources of stratospheric NO, are globally important.\nSurface-catalyzed photodissociation and biological uptake offer potential sinks for atmospheric N,O. Rebbert and Ausloos (1978) reported heterogeneous decomposition of N,O over various types of sand from\nAfrica. The quantum efficiency for a mercury arc (Xr280nm) was rather low, about 10e7 molecules per\nphoton, although it could be increased to 10m5\nmolecules per photon by heating the sand prior to the experiment. Pierotti et al. (1978) observed a slight depression (3 ppb, or 1%) of the N,O concentration in dusty air\nfrom West Africa, with rather large reductions for CH,CCl, (10%) and Ccl, (5%). It seems unlikely that\nthese rather gentle depressions could play a dominant role in removing these gases from the atmosphere (except perhaps for CClJ, but further work is needed to clearly resolve the question.\n\nIll\n\nI\n\nI\n\n98\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n0\n\n30\n\n-z\n25\ni!i\n2\n5\na\n\n0\n\nHeidt et al., 1976\n\n0\nA\n\n41\xe2\x80\x99N\n9\xe2\x80\x99N\n\nSchmeltekopf\n\n0\n\n5O\n\n$\n\n20\n\n32\xe2\x80\x99N\n\n9ON\n\nJ\n\net al., 1977\n\nGoldan et al., 1979\nTheoretical\n\n10\n\nNsO MIXING\n\nRATIO\n\n(by volume)\n\nTheoretical profiles were calculated with a 1-D model in combination with the\nmixing-surface procedure discussed by Logan et al.

Altitude\n\nprofiles at various latitudes for N20.\n\n99\n\nBUDGETS\n\nBiological uptake of N,O from the atmosphere has been observed in marshes and ponds (Kaplan et al., 1978;\nand Elkins et al., 1978). These systems are characterized by anoxic sediments underlying shallow water which\nhas been stripped of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and which is undersaturated in oxygen. It appears that\ndenitrifying organisms may very rapidly consume N,O under these condition, so that the water remains\ndepleted in N,O despite contact with the atmosphere. The examples studied to date represent rather common\nsystems, but their global importance is not clear. Gas exchange rates have not been measured, but are probably slow, as evidenced by the low oxygen concentrations in the water. Further studies are clearly indicated\non this question.\n\nSOURCES OF N,O AND MAN-MADE PERTURBATIONS\nObservations in the oceans, in the Potomac and Delaware Rivers, in freshwater ponds, and in agricultural\nsoils provide direct evidence for a quantitative relation between oxidation of organic material and production\nof N,O. Interpretation of these studies and of laboratory experiments suggests that microbial oxidation of\nammonia under oxygenated conditions,\nNH;\n\n+ (3/2)0,\n\n- NO,\n\n+ H,O + 2H+\n\nmay be the mechanism responsible for production of N,O (Yoshinari, 1976; Hahn and Junge, 1977; Elkins et\nal., 1978; Cohen and Gordon, 1978, 1979; and Bremner and Blackmer, 1978). Surprisingly, the yield of N,O\nobserved during nitrification appears to be uniform in many aquatic systems. Fertilization of agricultural\nsoils with ammonium or organic N and disposal of human and animal wastes strongly stimulate nitrification\nand may lead to globally significant efflux of N,O to the atmosphere.\nThe relationship between the oxidation of organic material and the evolution of N,O in the oceans is indicated\nin figures 3-5 and 3-6 (Elkins et al., 1978). The quantity AN,0 provides a measure of the net accumulation of\nN,O in a water mass since its last contact with the air, and AOU (the apparent oxygen utilization) provides a\ncumulative record of the net quantity of oxygen consumed over the same period due to oxidation of organic\nmaterial. If it is assumed that the C:N:P ratios in marine organic material are 106:16:1 (Redfield et al., 1963),\nand that the stoichiometry of decay is represented by\n\n(CH,O),,,(NH,),,(H,PO,)\n\n+ 138 O,-\n\n106 CO, + 122 H,O + 16 HNO,\n\n+ H,PO,,\n\nthen the data in figures 3-5 and 3-6 may be used to estimate an average yield of one mole of nitrogen as N,O\nfor every 350 moles of ammonia oxidized (0.28%).\nThe small yield of N,O in the oceans is consistent with a minor role in marine processes in the global budget\nfor atmospheric N,O. Even if all nitrogen incorporated into primary organic material were oxidized to NO,,\nthe marine source of N,O would account for less than 10 tg of nitrogen per year (Elkins et al., 1978; and\nCohen and Gordon, 1979). Since much of the nitrogen mineralized in the sea is reused as NH4+, the oceanic\nsource of N20 is probably very small (less than or equal to 10% of the global source).\nRecent data by Weiss (1979) show that the surface waters of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans are supersaturated with\nrespect to atmospheric N,O by only 4%. Weiss\xe2\x80\x99 experiments measure the surface super-saturation directly\nusing an equilibration chamber, and cover cruise tracks in excess of 60,000 km. Using the thin-film model\n(Broecker and Peng, 1974; and Liss and Slater, 1974), Weiss estimates a global source of approximately 3 tg N\nin N20 per year. However, the applicability of the thin-film model to such small supersaturations is unclear\nsince physical effects may produce small excesses of N,O.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n100\n\n4\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPRESENT\n\nI\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n0\n\n.\n\n0\nAN2O - - (0.06 + 0.06) + (0.31 k 0.01) AOU\n.\n\n3\n\n0\n0\n\n.\n\n2\n7\nt\n.=\n-3\n0\nzN\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nAOU (ml liter-\xe2\x80\x99 )\nNote: Most of the data are shown in this figure, except for unusually\nactive regions and AOU < 0.3 ml liter-t.

The disposal\nof nitrogenous wastes in rivers and estuaries stimulates vigorous production of NZO. McElroy et al. (1977)\nusing data on the concentration of N20, 0, and inorganic nitrogen species in the Potomac River estuary,\nestimated a conversion to N20 of 1 to 5% of the total nitrogen input. If the nitrogen in human and animal\nwastes were on the average converted to NZO with such high efficiency, disposal of these wastes could represent a globally significant source of N,O.\nRecently, extensive observations in the Delaware and Potomac estuaries have revealed marked variations of\nthe N20 production rate. The data suggest that enhanced production of N,O is triggered by severe oxygen\ndepletion, where concentrations of 0, in surface waters drop below 2 mg liter-r. There is evidence to suggest\nthat denitrification\nnear the water-sediment interface may be responsible for the enhanced production of\nN,O. Consequently, a nonlinear amplification may occur where more severe pollution reduces 0, levels and\nincreases the fraction of waste nitrogen converted into N20. Because of increasing world population, such a\nnonlinear response could greatly amplify anthropogenic production of N,O in the future.\nWork on fertilized agricultural soils indicate that nitrification may be the dominant source of N,O in these\nsystems (Bremner and Blackmer, 1978; McKenney and Wade, 1978; and Freney et al., 1979). The fractional\nyield of N,O in fertilized soils appears to increase under oxygen stress in a manner analogous to that of the\nestuaries. The yield of N,O from nitrification of fertilizer N appears to be similar to oceanic values at low\nrates of application, (10m3 moles N,O per mole of NHJ ) increasing rapidly at high rates (Bremner and\nBlackmer, 1978). McKenney and Wade (1978) observed an exponential increase in the N,O flux as a function\nof the application rate of fertilizer at high rates. Where the systems are heavily loaded with reduced nitrogen\nthe aquatic and soil systems both appear to exhibit nonlinear amplification of the N20 flux in response to increased loading.\nLaboratory and field studies of instantaneous N,O fluxes from soils give values ranging from less than 0.1 kgN ha-r yrl (c 1.4 x 109 N-atoms cm3s-r) to larger than 10 kg-N ha-r yrl (> 1.4 x 10\xe2\x80\x9d N-atoms cm-2s\xe2\x80\x99)\n(Bremner and Blackmer, 1978). Averaged over the year, the sources of N20 from agricultural soils appear\nlikely to be globally significant.\nA curious feature emerging from the field studies on agricultural soils is the marked small-scale variability\nobserved in the N,O flux, even where the soil surface appears homogeneous. As a consequence of this\nvariability, it is presently difficult to generalize about the anthropogenic sources of N20 arising from\nagricultural activities.\nSmall quantities of N20 are produced during chlorination of water containing ammonia or organic nitrogen.\nPresumably, the reaction involves intermediates in the oxidative chain for N initially in the -3 oxidation state.\nThis phenomenon has been observed in drinking-water plants (Cicerone et al., 1978) and sewage-treatment\nplants (McElroy et al., 1977). Although unlikely to be a significant global source, the mechanism responsible\nfor generation of N,O is of interest in view of possible similarities with the nitrification process.\nWeiss and Craig (1976) and Pierotti and Rasmussen (1976) observed production of significant quantities of\nN,O during combustion of coal and oil. Catalytic converters on automobiles may also be potentially important sources. Estimates for the global contribution of combustion range between 1 and 2 tg N in N,O per year.\nCombustion appears to be a potentially significant source of anthropogenic N20.\nISSUES\nThe magnitudes of the sources and sinks for N,O remain uncertain, despite considerable advances in our\nunderstanding during the last 5 years. The possibility of important unknown sinks cannot be discounted. The\nlocus of important sources and time scales for anthropogenic change are presently understood only in rough\noutline. The relative importance of nitrification as compared to denitrification is not yet firmly established.\n\n103\n\nBUDGETS\n\nNonlinear amplification of the N,O flux from oxygen-stressed environments could result in greatly enhanced\nanthropogenic sources of N,O, but the cause of this phenomenon is not presently understood. The\nmechanism must be clarified in order to make meaningful assessments of future human perturbations.\nThe existence of a long-term trend is a key question. Weiss (1979) reported preliminary results which suggest\nan increase of approximately 0.5 ppb per year between 1977 and 1979. These data come from remote stations\nin the Pacific and Antarctica. Goldan and co-workers (1979) reported a similar upward trend from observations in the upper troposphere over Wyoming. In neither case is the data base adequate at the present time to\naccurately establish the magnitude of the increase. The Weiss data suggest a present flux of 3 tg N in N,O per\nyear (or a doubling time of approximately 400 years). However, the slow growth rate is not genuinely reassuring since the recovery time of the atmosphere is probably correspondingly slow. Moreover, both biogenic\nsources (soils, aquatic systems, nitrogenous waste disposal) and combustion sources may grow rapidly, and it\nis presently unclear at what level such changes could become significant to stratospheric chemistry or\ntropospheric infrared transmissivity.\nFuture research on N,O should emphasize quantitative characterization of sources and elucidation of\nbiogeochemical mechanisms, which control evolution of the gas to the atmosphere. This effort should proceed in parallel with observations of the long-term and seasonal variations of atmospheric N,O, since changes\nin the background concentration of N20 reflect the net effects of man-made and natural perturbations. It\nshould also be remembered that the existence of presently unknown sinks for N,O could have a major impact\non our understanding of the atmospheric cycle of the gas.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC NsmBUDGET\nSOURCES AND SINKS\nThe major source of stratospheric NO, is the oxidation of nitrous oxide by O(tD) (Nicolet,\n\n1971).\n\nN,O + O(\xe2\x80\x98D) - 2 NO\nUsing the reaction rate constants in this report, a typical 1-D calculation gives a column production rate of 2.3\nx lo* CM2S\xe2\x80\x99 above the tropopause. Estimates of this source strength by Schmeltekopf et al. (1977b) with extrapolated measured profiles of N,O and the 2-D model of Crutzen (1975a), found the value to be 4.5 x\nlo* cm-2s-t. Given the uncertainties in both models, it is not clear that the discrepancy is significant.\nThe reaction above accounts for only about 10% of the known atmospheric\nPhotodissociation in the stratosphere is the dominant sink.\nThe major sink of NO, is the downward flow through the tropopause\nprocesses in the troposphere. A simple 1-D model calculation including\npredict an NO, mixing ratio of about 32 ppb at 40 km as shown in figure\nand sinks will be estimated by comparing their effects on the predicted\n\nsink of nitrous\n\noxide.\n\nfollowed by heterogeneous removal\nonly the major source and sink will\n3-7.

It is believed that this sink is responsible for the minimum mixing ratio near 70 km. This sink also\nreduces the mixing ratio of NO, at 40 km to a value of about 25 ppb when the NO photodissociation rate of\nFrederick and Hudson (1979a) was used (figure 3-7). If the NO photodissociation rate of Cieslik and Nicolet\n(1973) is used, this mixing ratio is further reduced to about 18 ppb. It is essential to include this sink in\nevaluating the effect of a downward NO, flux from the thermosphere. This source of NO, is due to the\nreaction\nN(2D) + 0, + NO +0\nwhere N(2D) is produced through ionospheric reactions (Frederick and Rusch, 1977):\nNO+ + e - N(2D) + 0\n\n76%\n\n- N(4S) + 0\n\n24%\n\nNf+O-\n\nN(2D) + NO+\n- N(4S) + NO+\n\nN2 + e(fast) - 2N(2D) + e\n- 2N(4S) + e\n\n1o-y\n\nlo+\n\nVolume Mixing Ratio of NO,\nFigure 3-7.

(1977). The downward flux of NO,\nat the mesopause is about 1 to 5 x IO* cm-*s-r (Strobel, 1971; and Cravens et al., 1979). Figure 3-7 also\nshows the calculated NO, mixing ratio for 30\xe2\x80\x9d latitude at equinoctial condition when the downward flux of 2\nx lo* cm-*,-r is used. This profile should be latitude dependent since both the source and the sink are latitude\ndependent. At high latitude during the winter, the thermospheric NO, can be transported into the\nstratosphere without suffering any significant loss. Furthermore, there could be a large increase of NO, from\nthe aurora1 source during the winter. This effect should be investigated with a 2-D or 3-D model. NO,\nmeasurements at high latitudes are needed to resolve this problem. It is important to measure the branching\nratios of the second and third reactions, because if N(4S) rather than N(*D) is the primary product, then the\nreaction, N(4S) + NO - N, + 0 would follow and result in an NO, sink.\nCosmic rays produce O+ , N+ , and N, and thus produce NO, (Warneck, 1972). However, the production is\nonly about 10\xe2\x80\x99 cm-*s-r in high latitudes (above 60\xe2\x80\x9d), and a factor of 5 less in low latitudes. Since most of the\nNO, is produced in the lower stratosphere where it is easily transported into the troposphere, the contribution\nof this source to the NO, mixing ratio at 40 km is less than 1%. Through similar reactions, solar proton events\ncan produce large amounts of NO at high geomagnetic latitudes (greater or equal to 60 o according to Crutzen\net al., 1975). The largest event recorded was in August, 1972. As much as 2 x IO* cm-*s-r of NO was produced at high latitudes, comparable to the source of N,O oxidation in the midlatitude. The fact that an ozone\nreduction was observed in the high-latitude upper stratosphere (Heath et al., 1977), supports qualitatively the\ncatalytic ozone destruction by NO,. However, since then, because of the drastic changes in stratospheric\nphotochemistry (such as addition of chlorine), it is important to make a current evaluation of this problem.\nEvents like this are rare. Smaller events such as the September 1966 event produce only about 2 x 10\xe2\x80\x99 cm-*s-r .\nEvents of this size happened several times per year during 1958 and 1959, but have been sporadic (less than\nonce per year) since then.\nIntrusion of tropospheric NO, into the stratosphere is unlikely because of the low tropospheric NO, (less than\nor equal to 0.5 ppb) that has been measured (Drummond et al., 1977; Noxon, 1975; and McFarland et al.,\n1979). There is no quantitative estimate of the intrusion of NO, produced by lightning. Injection of NO, by\nvolcanic eruption is also negligible (Lazrus et al., 1979). Efficient scavenging by rain apparently prevents NO,\nin the upper troposphere from building up. For the same reason NH, in the upper troposphere should be so\nlow that its conversion to NO, through reaction with OH is negligible also. High-flying subsonic transport\naircraft inject NO into the lower stratosphere. Using the projected injection profile for the year 1980 (CIAP,\n1974) it can be found that the increase of NO, at 15 km is about 5%, but is negligibly small above 20 km.\nNuclear bombs produce NO through high-temperature reactions. Two recent papers (Bauer, 1978b; and\nChang et al., 1979) have summarized these NO, inputs into the stratosphere. In 1961 and 1962, the NO, injected was large, about 1 to 2 x lO34 molecules. There should have been large increases in NO, at high\nlatitudes in the Northern Hemisphere at that time. Recent nuclear tests inject only about 103* molecules per\ntest, negligible compared to the N,O source.\nOdd-nitrogen species are also produced by high-temperature reactions during atmospheric entry of meteors\n(Park and Menees, 1978). The production of NO is about 5 x IO6 cm-*,-r and peaks at an altitude of about 85\nkm. The production of atomic nitrogen is about 5 x 10\xe2\x80\x99 cm-*s-r and peaks at 95 km. Since most of the\natomic nitrogen produced near this height will recombine with NO rather than reacting with 0, to form NO,\nthis represents an important sink of NO,, especially during intensive meteoric showers.\nHeterogeneous reactions can affect the stratospheric NO, abundance in two ways: one is that aerosols can be\na reservoir of NO,, and the other is that NO, can be removed from the stratosphere by aerosols settling into\nthe troposphere. Although the stratospheric aerosol apparently consists mainly of sulfate (Junge and Manson, 1961; Lazrus et al., 1971), Kiang et al. (1975) have pointed out that in laboratory analyses undertaken at\n\nBUDGETS\n\nroom temperatures that nitric acid may have evaporated. Recently, Farlow et al. (1978) have tentatively identified nitrogen-sulfur compounds in the stratospheric aerosols and concluded that although the NO, removed\nby aerosols settling into the troposphere is small in comparison to the production rate of reaction N,O +\nO(lD) - 2N0, the aerosol layer may constitute an important reservoir of NO, in the lower stratosphere.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH MEASUREMENTS\nMeasurements of the various atmospheric nitrogen-containing species show a great deal of variability, particularly in the lower stratosphere. The measured mixing ratios of NO, shown in figure 3-8; NO,, shown in\nfigure 3-9; and HNO,, shown in figure 3-10, indicate a general increase from the tropopause into the upper\nstratosphere. Although consistent with model calculations, these values are generally lower by about a factor\nof 2 than those predicted for the stratosphere. Extensive NO, column density measurements by Noxon (1979)\nin low latitudes (0 to 40\xe2\x80\x9d) are consistent with the in situ data shown in figure 3-9. But the much lower NO,\nvalues (by more than a factor of 2) in winter high latitudes indicate there may be either an NO, sink or an\nunknown mechanism converting NO, to more stable species such as HNO,. Most of the upper stratosphere\nand lower mesosphere measurements indicate a decrease in NO mixing ratio with altitude contrary to the\npresence of an important thermospheric source. However, the measurements at even higher altitudes (Meira,\n1971) are consistent with the models which include the thermospheric source.\nIn the daytime, most NO, resides in the form of NO above 40 km. Extensive latitudinal and seasonal\nmeasurements of NO between 40 km and 100 km can determine the NO, mixing ratio, and the importance of\nthe ionospheric and the aurora1 sources. At night NO, and HNO, are the dominant NO, species below 60 km.\nSimultaneous measurements of NO, and HNO, at night can also determine the mixing ratio of NO,. A more\ndetailed discussion of these observations and a comparison with model predictions is found in Chapter 4.\n\nAs of 1978, the global atmosphere contained 610,000 tg carbon, or a mole fraction of 3.33 x 10e4.The observations shown in figure 3-l 1 confirm that the atmospheric inventory is increasing, presently at a rate of about\n2 x 1Or4 moles of carbon per year (1.5 ppm). The rate of increase has also been increasing, roughly doubling\nsince the late 1950s.\nMajor gaps exist in the knowledge of the biogeochemistry of CO,. The preindustrial inventory is uncertain.\nMost models adopt a value of 290 ppm, about 15% less than the present concentration. If this assumption is\nwrong, model-based predictions of future trends could be in error.\nAnother related question concerns the role of the biosphere in the long term storage of carbon. This role is\npotentially large, especially with respect to the exchange between the atmosphere and the reservoirs of\nreduced carbon in soil and in forest biomass.\nThe biospheric reservoir is composed of several parts, each with markedly different exchange times and\nmagnitudes. The terrestrial, non-fossil biosphere contains about 14 x 1017 moles of carbon, of which 90%\nexchange carbon with the atmosphere on time scales of tens of years or more. The remainder consists of\nmaterial such as leaves, small branches and roots, litter, etc. Annually, this part of the biosphere introduces,\nby virtue of photosynthetic and decay activities, the seasonal variation in the atmospheric inventory, amounting to approximately 5 x 1014 moles of CO2 or about 3 ppm globally, or 5 ppm in the Northern Hemisphere\n(see figure 3-11). The marine biosphere contains an amount of carbon similar to the terrestrial non-fossil\nbiosphere. Large quantities of organic carbon are also stored as terrestrial organic matter in soil humus (1.6\nx 1017moles) and peat (1 .O x lOI moles).

An additional 3 x lo\xe2\x80\x99*\nmoles of carbon reside in the bulk of the oceans, but exchange between this reservoir and the atmosphere is\nvery slow (100 to 1000 years). Because of the potential magnitude of this reservoir for taking up atmospheric\ncarbon, the precise evaluation of the exchange time between the upper mixed ocean and mid-ocean is important. Further research is required to fully quantify the detailed mechanisms by which CO, is transferred between the atmosphere and oceans. Organic and inorganic ocean sediments contain about 3 x l@l moles of\ncarbon, but this reservoir is well isolated from the atmosphere, except on the geological (108 years) time scale.\nThe principal carbon reservoirs and their exchange rates with the atmosphere are summarized in table 3-7.\nTable 3-7\nPrincipal Carbon Reservoirs\nand Their Exchange Rates with the Atmosphere*\n\nReservoir\n\nInventory\n(10\xe2\x80\x998 g C)\n\nAtmosphere\n\n1.56\n\nAnnual biota\nOcean surface\nlayer\n\nFR-A\ng C/Yd\n\nFA-R\n(1016 g Ch)\n\n0.615\n\nPerennial biota\n\nW6\n\nDeep ocean\n\n0\n\n0.69\n\n0.075\n\n20.9\n\n0.80\n\n2.46\n\n17.3\n\n8.83\n\n36.2\n\n(Adapted from model parameters of Keeling and Bacastow, 1978).\n*FR-A and FA-R are fluxes from reservoir to atmosphere and\natmosphere to reservoir, respectively.\nIt has been commonly assumed that the increase in the abundance of atmospheric CO, has resulted only from\nthe input of fossil carbon due to combustion of fuels such as oil, coal, or natural gas. Production rates of\nfossil fuels since industrialization have been estimated by the United Nations, and Keeling (1973) calculated\nCO, production rates from these data. Combustion rates have grown at about 4.3% per year, except for the\ndepression and war periods, with slightly faster rate of increases (4.5%) since 1960 (Rotty, 1977) and a\ndecrease after 1973. There appears to be consistency between the increasing rates of fossil fuel production and\nthe accelerating increase of atmospheric CO, levels. If it is assumed that fossil fuel combustion is the major\nnet source of CO, to the atmosphere, it can be calculated that about 55% of the carbon released since industrialization has accumulated in the atmosphere. At present, about 5 x log tons are released annually, with\na total of 150 x log tons released since 1850.\nRecent works (Bolin, 1977; Woodwell et al., 1978; and Stuvier, 1978) suggest a large value for the cumulative\nnet rate of forest destruction and loss of organic carbon from soils. The magnitude of this biospheric source\nhas been estimated to be in the range,of 1 to 10 x log tons annually, roughly equal to the fossil fuel source at\npresent, and exceeding it in total CO, release up to the present. However, Broecker et al. (1979) argue that\ncurrent ocean-atmosphere models are consistent with available data and that regrowth of forests cut in the\npast may have compensated for much of the recent cutting.\nIt has been commonly assumed that the oceans are the only major sink for anthropogenic CO,, and the\nmagnitude of the ocean sink has been calculated from measured transport rates of water to the deep, combined with theoretically deduced values for the average degree of undersaturation of the oceans with respect\n\nBUDGETS\n\n113\n\nto atmospheric CO, (cf, Broecker and Peng, 1974). According to these analyses, removal by the oceans can\naccount for slightly less than the quantity of fossil fuel CO, which has apparently been removed from the atmosphere. Therefore, the addition to the inventory of a large biospheric source of CO, would invalidate\nglobal models for the CO, budget.\nThe problem is characterized by a severe lack of pertinent data, e.g., on the historical levels of COZ, the actual\ndegree of undersaturation of ocean waters on a global basis, and mechanisms for transferring carbon from\nthe atmosphere to the oceans. Projections of future CO, levels depend strongly on resolution of the questions\nsurrounding the biospheric source.\nQuantitative predictions are not reliable. The relative importance of terrestrial plants, ocean carbonate\nsediments and ocean water in the removal of CO2 from the air are not known. None of the existing models\ncan be shown to be correct in their parameterizations of the circulation of intermediate and deep-ocean\nwaters, which are of critical importance in long-term prediction. The impact of global changes in soils and\nvegetative covers is poorly understood and the necessary data base does not exist for evaluations to be made.\nFinally, there is the question (not easily answered) as to whether increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide\nmight produce secondary effects which in themselves could significantly influence the level of atmospheric\nCO,. Examples might include changes in the biospheric flux of CO,, alteration of the oceanic circulation, or\nocean-atmosphere exchange mechanisms in response to climatic perturbations.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR\nINTRODUCTION\nDocumentation of the extreme aridity (approximately 3% relative humidity) of the lower stratosphere and the\nrapid decrease of mixing ratio with height through the polar tropopause (20-fold in the first kilometer) was\nbegun in 1943 by Dobson et al. (1946). They recognized that this extreme and persistent aridity must be\ndynamically maintained or it would be destroyed by turbulent diffusion. This led Brewer (1949) to\nhypothesize a stratospheric circulation in which all air enters through the tropical tropopause where it is\nfreeze-dried to a mass mixing ratio of 2 to 3 ppmm. This dry air then spreads poleward and descends through\nthe polar tropopauses, overpowering upward-transport of water vapor by diffusion, which would otherwise\nbe permitted by the much higher temperatures of the polar tropopauses.\n\nHISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nFor a quarter-century following Brewer\xe2\x80\x99s (1949) hypothesis, there was little further progress in understanding\nthe stratospheric water budget. Observations served mainly to confirm the dryness of the stratosphere and the\nobservations of the MRF (British\ndifficulty\nof obtaining reliable measurements. The intermittent\nMeteorological Research Flights) and of Mastenbrook (1968, 1971, 1974a) tended to confirm the basic Brewer\nhypothesis and to suggest a gradual increase in the mixing ratio of the stratosphere from the 1940s through the\n196Os, followed by a decline thereafter (see Chapter 6). \xe2\x80\x99\nDuring the CIAP program, Newell et al. (1973) explicitly pointed out that if H,O cannot diffuse upward\nthrough the polar tropopause, neither can other trace species. That is, all atmospheric transport from the\ntroposphere to the stratosphere must occur through the tropical tropopause. Wofsy et al. (1972) and\nWeickman et al. (1975) have pointed out that since CH, destruction in the stratosphere exceeds planetary\nescape of hydrogen approximately 300-fold, the stratosphere must be a source of water vapor, returning more\nto the troposphere than it receives. Ellsaesser (1974) found from existing data analyses that the HZ0 mixing\nratio of air entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause cold trap exceeded that generally found\nin the lower stratosphere suggesting that there must be a stratospheric sink specific for water vapor. Stanford\n(1973) and Ellsaesser (1974) independently pointed out that the winter temperatures of the polar\n\n114\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nstratospheres, particularly that of Antarctica, typically dropped below that of the tropical tropopause cold\ntrap, and by freezing out ice crystals which could precipitate, might provide a sink for stratospheric water\nvapor. Since CIAP, three reviews on the subject of water in the stratosphere have been published.\nHarries (1976) made a comprehensive review of all the various types of observations. By excluding .two\nsomewhat extreme sets of data from the Southern Hemisphere, and some observations which contributed\ngreatly to the rms scatter of the HZ0 mixing ratios, he attempted to deduce representative vertical, latitudinal,\nand temporal variations. He concluded that the considerable uncertainties in the absolute levels of\nstratospheric mixing ratios preclude anything more than qualitative conclusions concerning the water budget\nof the stratosphere.\nThe data summarized by Harries indicated that measured mass mixing ratios generally lie between 0.5 and 5\nppmm for all stratospheric levels up to 40 km, In northern midlatitudes, there is a vertical profile of fairly\nconstant mixing ratio between 13 and 30 km of about 2.5 f 0.7 ppmm. There is some evidence for a small increase above 30 km to about 2.9 ppmm, but occasionally, as high as 4 to 5 ppmm. Three independent sets of\nobservations show an upward trend of 0.1 to 0.25 ppmm per year which may possibly be related to long-term\nchanges of temperature at the tropical tropopause (see Chapter 6). Observations at fixed levels above single\nlocations in the Northern Hemisphere show marked annual cycles, the amplitudes and phases of which are in\nfair quantitative agreement.\nPenndorf (1978) performed another comprehensive and critical review of stratospheric H,O measurements.\nHe rejected all soundings reporting mixing ratios exceeding 9 ppmm above 15 km as suffering from contamination. He then summarized the remaining observations by observational technique. In determining a\nvertical profile, he rejected as invalid Harries\xe2\x80\x99 (1976) method of combining, with equal weight, data sets\nrepresenting from 1 to nearly 100 balloon flights and specific altitude averages containing between 5 and 15\ndifferent data sets. From his analysis he concluded that 32 retained data sets strongly support a constant mixing ratio from the tropopause to at least 30 to 35 km with a mean northern midlatitude value (circa 1969-1970)\nof 2.58 _+0.6 ppmm. Limited observations suggest a higher mixing ratio above this level. Although 6 data sets\nindicate an equatorial maximum, any deduction of a latitudinal gradient of mixing ratio from the existing\nfield measurements below 18 km is still controversial. Above 20 km, no conclusions about latitudinal gradients can be drawn since field measurements are nonexistent. Three independent Northern Hemisphere series\nof measurements indicate that an annual cycle is significant only for altitudes below 20 km, amounting to 10\nto 20% at 15 km and decreasing with altitude. At 15 km the maximum occurs in November; it lags with\naltitude, occurring in April at 20 km. Three independent series of measurements indicate an overall increase\nfrom 1954 to about 1973 of about 0.87 ppmm/decade and a steep decrease thereafter of about 1.6\nppmm/decade. (See Chapter 6.)\nRobinson (1978) emphasized several features of HZ0 soundings. The tropical soundings appear to fall in one\nof two distributions classified by Kuhn (unpublished work) as wet and dry days. On the wet days, the mixing\nratios (approximately 6 ppmm) correspond to saturation at the ambient tropical tropopause and remain\nreasonably constant upward in altitude to pressures as much as 60 mb below the tropopause pressure.\nOn dry days, the mixing ratios (approximately 3 ppmm) are generally less than that corresponding to saturation at the ambient tropical tropopause and are found to extend as much as 100 mb beneath the tropopause in\nclearly tropospheric air. In Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s words, the mixing ratios,...\xe2\x80\x9c suggest that stratospheric air is entering\nthe troposphere in the tropics, but other tracers, particularly ozone, show no evidence of this.\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson also\nnotes that the freeze-dry mechanism implies a deep or thick cloud extending downward from the tropical\ntropopause, and points out that this requirement can be reconciled with the observations only if the ascending\nbranch of the Hadley cell is entirely confined to cumulus towers with slow descent at all other locations.\n\nBUDGETS\n\n115\n\nRECENT OBSERVATIONS\nObservations of stratospheric H,O mixing ratios versus latitude are depicted in figure 3-12. With the exception of Mastenbrook\xe2\x80\x99s (1968) data, all measurements compiled in figure 3-12 were obtained from aircraft\nplatforms and, due to limitations on ceiling heights, were not necessarily performed high enough over the\nlocal tropopause in tropical regions to be free from direct contributions from the underlying troposphere.\nVertical profiles measured since about 1976 from aircraft, balloon and rocket platforms over midlatitudes are\ncompiled in figure 3-13. These soundings agree in showing a minimum mixing ratio near 20 km and an increase above, but disagree strongly with regard to the magnitudes of both the minimum and maximum mixing\nratios and the altitude of the latter. Harries et al. (1979), and Farmer et al. (1979) used remote spectroscopic\ntechniques which are less sensitive to local contamination than in situ techniques with the implication that the\nobserved increase with altitude is less likely due to contamination. Note that the gradient for all individual\nprofiles of figure 3-13 is notably smaller than that of some of the more extreme earlier measurements discussed in Harries (1976).\nNote also that the apparent substantial increase in stratospheric mixing ratio up to 1973 and rapid decline\nthereafter would, if valid, tend to make any mixing ratio increase with altitude due to CH, oxidation more apparent now than at any time since about the beginning of the Mastenbrook series.\nOnly one measurement (Kley et al., 1979) has been made in tropical regions in recent years.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThere is still no better explanation of the persistent extreme aridity of the stratosphere than that proposed by\nBrewer (1949), i.e., all air enters the stratosphere through the cold tropical tropopause where it is freeze-dried.\nThis hypothesis is supported by essentially all available observations. Annual cycles in stratospheric mixing\nratios in the Northern Hemisphere vary in the proper sense, and with the expected phase lag with the saturation mixing ratios permitted by the tropical tropopause cold trap, which is warmest in July and coldest in\nFebruary in both hemispheres. Tropical tropopause heights and temperatures, and stratospheric 0, and particulates, in turn, vary as would be expected from the Brewer hypothesis and the observed annual shifts and\nvariations in intensity of the intertropical convergence zone and the Hadley cells. There is substantial evidence\nthat HZ0 does not diffuse upward through the polar tropopause, the temperature of which would permit mixing ratios approximately one order of magnitude greater than generally observed just 1 km or so higher in the\nstratosphere.\nThe Brewer (1949) mechanism, augmented by the proposed stratospheric oxidation of CH, would appear to\nrequire a downward directed H,O gradient from levels of more rapid CH, oxidation to the tropopause, and\nan equator-directed gradient so that the return Hadley flux through the polar tropopause could carry more\nH,O than the upwelling branch of the Hadley flux. However, nearly all available observational data support\ngradients of the opposite signs, i.e., directed upward and poleward from the Brewer (1949) tropical\ntropopause source.\nDue to the variations in absolute values of stratospheric H,O obtained by different instruments, gradients can\nbe inferred only from homogeneous data. Even with this precaution, the available data do not provide unambiguous answers.\n\n111.1.1\n\nI I\n\nI\n\n,..mm11\n\nm..-111\n\n.I.\n\n,\n\nI\n\n. . . . ..\n\n..--\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n116\n\n6\n\n;\n1\n\n5\n\n8\n\n-I\nStratospheric\n8\n\nx-x\n- o\nM\n. l. .\n\n7\n\n-+-+\n-\n\nMixing\n\nI\n\nRatio\n\nFarmer 119741 < 14 km\nHarries [1973] 12-16 km\nHarries [19761 14-17 km\nHilsenrath etal.

See Table 3-8.\n\n118\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nInspection of the data used to compile figure 3-12 shows that some of those obtained over tropical regions\nmight have been influenced by larger mixing ratios from the nearby tropical tropopause. Indeed, of the\nseveral data sets represented in figure 3-12, it is those measured at the higher altitudes (e.g. McKinnon and\nMorewood, 1970; and Mastenbrook, 1968) which yield relatively flatter profiles as a function of latitude:\nthose measurements made at the lower altitudes clearly show the influence of the troposphere. However, this\nprovides no grounds to restrict the search for evidence for a stratospheric sink to examining latitudinal gradients obtained only above 18 km. Air in the upwelling Hadley cell, once above the tropopause (unless it contains visible hydrometeors of an overshooting cumulus cloud), is presumably stratospheric air. Any\ndecrease in mixing ratio above this point would appear to represent a stratospheric process, and be just as indicative of a stratospheric sink as poleward-directed gradients pointing horizontally away from the tropical\ntropopause source. If this is not true, clearly the process by which the tropical tropopause cold trap operates is\nnot understood.\nThe observational\n\ndata on vertical profiles (such as that in figure 3-13) appears less ambiguous.\n\nMastenbrook\xe2\x80\x99s (1968) Trinidad soundings and the Brazil sounding of Kley et al. (1979) show H,O decreasing\nthrough the tropical tropopause to minimum mixing ratios near 19 km (approximately 60 mb and termed the\nhygropause by Kley et al.) of 2.1 and 1.7 ppmm respectively. These mixing ratios would require cold trap\ntemperatures of -83 o and -84\xc2\xb0C at the tropical tropopause. Even if such low cold trap temperatures prevailed\nit would leave unexplained the higher mixing ratios generally reported just above the tropical tropopause, and\nthe decrease in mixing ratio from the tropopause upward to the hygropause.\nAt present, these data must be taken as factual experimental results without a satisfactory theoretical explanation. They seem to require a stratospheric sink for H,O (i.e., a mechanism other than return Hadley flow for\nremoving H,O from the stratosphere), or to imply that there are gaps in our understanding of the method of\noperation of the tropical tropopause cold trap.\nThe temporal or spatial variability suggested by the data in figures 3-12 and 3-13 is well outside anything that\ncould be expected from the Mastenbrook series. For this reason it would appear the safest choice, at present,\nto assume that most of the variability among data sets reflects observational difficulties more than variations\nin stratospheric mixing ratio. Estimates of the observational accuracy of stratospheric HZ0 measurements are\nvery nebulous. Estimates culled from reports of the experimenters by Penndorf (1978) are listed in table 3-8.\nOne proposed stratospheric sink is freeze-out over the winter poles as has been put forward by Stanford\n(1973) and by Ellsaesser (1974). In this case, the mixing ratio lapse rate above the tropopause might be taken\nas indicative of a sink at some higher level, and the very cold winter poles (particularly Antarctica) might provide such a sink. According to Kochanski\xe2\x80\x99s (1955) 1948-1951 mean January cross section for 8O\xe2\x80\x9dW there is a\nclosed -85\xc2\xb0C isotherm centered over the North Pole at approximately 30 km. Similarly the June-July cross\nsection for 14O\xe2\x80\x9dW (the coldest longitude) synthesized from radiosonde, rocketsonde and SCR data by\nLabitzke and Van Loon (1972) shows a closed -90 \xe2\x80\x9cC isotherm centered over the South Pole at approximately\n24 km. These correspond to saturation mixing ratios of about 10 ppmm from 22 to 30 km for the Arctic and\nabout 3 ppmm from 16 to 24 km for the Antarctic. A more recent picture of these low winter pole\ntemperatures is given in figure 3-14 from Prabhakara and Rodgers (1976) showing satellite-determined\nlOO-and 50-mb temperatures as a function of latitude and season.\nThese numbers are barely of the right magnitude for a freeze-dry sink even over Antarctica. And even if\nwinter polar temperatures drop low enough to produce saturation mixing ratios below 3 ppmm, there remain\nthe nagging questions of the small volume of the stratosphere so cooled, the restricted movement of air\nthrough this volume due to the reduced meridional mixing and transport enforced by the dynamic stability of\nthe winter polar vortices, and that any precipitated ice crystals must survive falling through several kilometers\nof warmer air before they can exit the stratosphere. An attempt to quantitatively model such a sink\nmechanism might be illuminating.\n\n119\n\nBUDGETS\n\nTable 3-8\nTypical Uncertainties in the Hz0 Measurements Proposed\nby Various Investigators\n\nName\n\nMastenbrook (1968)\nCluley and Oliver (1978)\nMet-Res.

Zonal average stratospheric temperature (K) derived from\nNimbus-4 IRIS measurements for April 1970 through\nJanuary 1971 (adapted from Prabhakara and Rodgers.1976).\n\nBUDGETS\n\n121\n\nJohnston and Solomon (1979) have suggested that cumulus towers could overshoot the tropical tropopause by\nover 2 km, cooling adiabatically to below -100\xc2\xb0C and act as a cold finger modification of the cold trap\nmechanism. Mahlman (private communication, 1979) reports that his new 3-D model, because of forced convection, calculates relative humidities at and above the tropical tropopause of only 50 to 60%. Although both\nthese results must be regarded as preliminary, they suggest types of processes to be explored as alternatives to\na stratospheric sink for H,O.\nBut, in turn, such alternative mechanisms must be given careful scrutiny. Considering the steepness of the\ntropospheric lapse rate just below the tropical tropopause and of the temperature inversion just above it, it is\ndifficult to see how air parcels once above the tropopause (unless having first arrived there in an overshooting\ncumulus) could again return to the troposphere without first spending an appreciable lifetime (months) in\nthe stratosphere. Accordingly, it is difficult to understand why the HZ0 mixing ratio is observed to decrease\nfor another 2 or 3 km above the tropical tropopause. The faster a convective cell penetrates the tropopause\nand the farther it overshoots it, the larger will be the hydrometeors it can support, and the greater will be the\nlocal temperature deficit or density excess to accelerate it back toward the troposphere. It is not clear whether\nthe temperature difference leads to freeze-drying of entrained stratospheric air, or to evaporation in the\nstratosphere of hydrometeors shed from a tropospheric cloud.\nWhat does appear clear is that there is a compensating trade-off between latent heat and buoyancy which\ntends to restrict net transfer of water across the original altitude of neutral buoyancy. Specifically, evaporation of hydrometeors will reduce internal energy or buoyancy, and thus, lower the altitude at which the convection element is at buoyant equilibrium with the environment; conversely, freezing hydrometeors out of\nstratospheric air increases the altitude of buoyant equilibrium. That is, the more the overshooting convective\nelement evaporates water into stratospheric air, the more likely the total mixing unit is to return to the\ntroposphere; the more it condenses out stratospheric water vapor, the more likely the total mixing unit is to\nremain in the stratosphere. Thus, it appears difficult to argue that penetrating convection does anything other\nthan continue to bring saturated air to the level of buoyant equilibrium with the environment which cannot be\nvery far removed from the tropical tropopause itself. The contained hydrometeors will quickly adjust the\nwater vapor content to the saturation vapor pressure at the pressure and temperature of buoyant equilibrium,\nand then precipitate back into the troposphere. Since air at the tropical tropopause is radiatively warmed at\nabout 0.25 \xe2\x80\x9cC per day, it will slowly ascend as it is replaced by successive convective elements. Given a constant tropopause temperature and pressure, there appears to be no reason why this process should not lead to a\nconstant mixing ratio with height above the tropical tropopause.\n\nH,O BUDGET\nThe stratospheric HZ0 budget was discussed by Ellsaesser (1974). He proposed that a stratospheric sink was\nneeded to balance the budget and to explain the gradients indicated by the data.\nThe observed mixing\n-84\xc2\xb0C at the tropical\ntemperature of -80\xc2\xb0C\neither the existence of\nby which the cold trap\nto be consistent with\nbalance.\n\nratios at 60 mb over the tropics appear to require a cold-trap temperature of about\ntropopause. However, the available data tend to support a tropopause cold-trap\nand a decrease in mixing ratio from the tropical tropopause to 60 mb. This implies\na sink for Hz0 within the stratosphere or a gap in the understanding of the mechanism\noperates. Ellsaesser (1974) noted that the limited observational data available appeared\nan Antarctic winter freeze-dry sink of sufficient magnitude to bring the budget into\n\nIt must be noted that the apparent long-term trend in stratospheric HZ0 (see Chapter 6), if valid, has been of\nsufficient magnitude (9OVo increase from 1954 to 1973 per MRF data) to have an appreciable effect on the\nHZ0 budget and possibly on the radiation of the stratosphere. If such variations are indicative of changes in\nthe general circulation of the atmosphere or the strength of the Hadley flux through the tropical tropopause,\nthey may impact on other stratospheric species as well.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n122\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nAvailable data indicate several unresolved questions with regard to stratospheric water vapor such as:\nl\n\nl\n\nAre there significant long-period trends in lower stratospheric mixing ratio, suggesting changes in the\ngeneral circulation of the atmosphere?\nAre there decreases in mixing ratio with height just above the tropical tropopause which suggest a\nstratospheric sink for H,O or a lack of understanding of the operation of the tropical tropopause co/d\n\ntrap?\nl\n\nAre there latitudinal\n\ngradients in H,O mixing ratio of the following\n\ntypes?\n\n-\n\n-\n\nl\n\nPoleward-directed gradients between the tropical tropopause and the higher level minimum in mixing\nratio or hygropause supporting a higher mixing ratio in the ascending air over that of the descending\nbranches of the Hadley current.\nEquatorial-directed gradients at the hygropause supporting a higher mixing ratio (due to CH, oxidation) in the high latitude descending branches of the stratospheric Hadley current than in the lowlatitude ascending current.\n\nAre there increases in mixing ratio with height above the hygropause, and can the increases be fully accounted for by CH, oxidation?\n\nTo achieve answers to these questions will require observational programs of the following\nl\n\nl\n\ntypes:\n\nContinued homogeneous observations from fixed locations to define long-term trends. To accomplish\nthis, it is important that past observational series such as those of Mastenbrook, Hyson, and the MRF be\ncontinued, and that new series be initiated at other locations. In this connection, documentation from\nboth past and future data of the year-to-year variations at height and temperature of the tropical\ntropopause at as many stations as possible would be a valuable endeavor.\nMeasurements from aircraft at various stratospheric altitudes to determine latitudinal gradients. Such\nflights should make simultaneous high-resolution measurements of H,O, O,, temperature, and other\nparameters. Of most value would be:\n-\n\nFlights over midsouthern latitudes during September and October when the latitudinal\npected to be a maximum as a result of any Antarctic sink and Hadley cell source.\n\n-\n\nl\n\nFlights across the Equator or seasonal position of the ITCZ at 18 km and above.\n\nFlights during the winter over the polar caps themselves seeking any evidence of freeze-dry removal of\nH,O from the stratosphere.\n\ngradient is ex-\n\nSatellites to provide long-period coverage (in both time and space) of H,O distributions in the\nstratosphere. The first usable data on global H,O distributions are just now beginning to emerge from\nNimbus-7; strong support should be given to the continuation of similar programs.\n\nIt is important to emphasize the need for high accuracy in measuring stratospheric H,O. To determine the\nvertical, horizontal, and temporal variations in stratospheric H,O will require relative accuracy capable of\ndistinguishing changes of + 5070,or less. Uncertainty in absolute values must be kept below f 20% in order to\nresolve the global budget. To resolve the long-term trend will require even greater accuracy: on the order of 1\nto 3%. Different scale resolutions are also required. To define H,O morphology in the region of the\n\nl-\n\nBUDGETS\n\n123\n\ntropopause requires small-scale resolution. For studying global patterns and budgets and comparison with\nmodel predictions global coverage is more important than scale resolution.\nIn addition to measurements, model experiments could help provide answers to these questions. It is believed\nthe following would be productive:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nDesign and execute a complete model of stratospheric chemistry without holding Hz0 constant to determine rates and patterns of H,O consumption and production.\nModel winter polar freeze-out to quantitatively estimate the rate of exchange through the polar vortex\nand the total amount of H,O that can be removed or the total mass of air which can be freeze-dried per\nyear.\nModel thunderstorm penetrations of the tropical tropopause to determine whether such occurrences\ntransport H,O upward or downward, and whether they introduce gradients by vertical redistribution of\nH,O.\nStudy the physics of low-temperature condensation and evaporation of H,O. (Although homogeneous\nnucleation may not occur under normal stratospheric conditions, could nacreous cloud particles, once\nformed, survive a fall to the troposphere?)\nModel penetrative tropical convection from the surface through 100 mb to determine the vertical\ndistribution of H,O which will result from successive penetrations under expected atmospheric conditions.\n\nHYDROCARBONSANDHYDROGEN\nMETHANE\nSources and Sinks\nThe major sources of CH, are believed to involve the anaerobic fermentation of organic material due to\nmicrobial action (Koyama, 1963) in rice paddy fields, swamps and marshes, tropical rain forests, and tundra,\nas well as enteric fermentation in mammals. The magnitude of these sources has been studied by Ehhalt (1974)\nand Baker-Blocker et al. (1977); the estimated source strengths for each category are listed in table 3-9. The\nlarger area of wetlands and rice paddies, as well as the greater population of livestock in the Northern\nHemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere, implies a hemispherically asymmetric source of CH,.\nThis asymmetry appears to be borne out in the finding of slightly more CH, in the Northern Hemisphere than\nthat of the Southern Hemisphere. Although soils have been shown to act as a sink for CO (Inman et al., 1971)\nand H, (Schmidt, 1974), there is no evidence for a globally significant CH, soil sink.\nObservations of CH, supersaturations of 1.2 to 1.7 in the surface waters of the open ocean (Lamontagne et\nal., 1974) implies a source of atmospheric CH, due to oceanic biological activity. However, estimates of this\nsource (using the stagnant film diffusion model) imply that this source is small, as is the source from the continental shelf and tidal flat regions (see table 3-9).\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n124\n\nTable 3-9\nAtmospheric CH, Budget\n\nEstimated* Rate\n(tg CH4 yr-\xe2\x80\x98)**\n\nReference\n\nEnteric fermentation\nPaddy fields\nPaddy fields\nWetlands\nWetlands\nFreshwater lakes\nForest and tundra\nOceans\n\n100-200\n280\n170 - 350\n130 - 260\n150\nl-25\n1 - 13\n5 - 20\n\nEhha!t (1974)\nEhhalt (1974)\nBaker-Blocker et al.

However, while direct anthropogenic sources\nare small, the large emissions due to rice paddy cultivation and enteric fermentation in livestock are indirectly\nrelated to man\xe2\x80\x99s activities. While the former tend to enhance CH, production, the draining of wetlands and\nclearing of forests by man tends to decrease the source rate, and it is not presently known if the CH, source\nrate is increasing, decreasing, or constant.\nThe atmospheric source of CH, due to lithospheric processes is generally believed to be small. Since CH, is\nunstable at high temperatures relative to CO,, the CH, source from volcanoes (which are characterized by hot\ngaseous discharges) is only about 0.2 tg CH, per year. However, Gold (1979) has proposed a major new\nsource of CH, due to cool outgassing of carbon-containing molecules during earthquakes and seeps along\nfault lines. While the escape of CH, in this manner has not been observed, Gold estimates that this source\nmay account for a significant fraction of the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s CH, source. From the rate of deposition of\nlimestone, Gold (1979) estimates an average yearly source of 20 tg CH, per year due to this process; however,\nthis source would be highly variable, and in any given year, could be orders of magnitude larger or smaller.\nAlthough present data on the C14H4 to C12H4 ratio in the atmosphere cannot rule out this source (Ehhalt,\n1974), further measurements are needed to establish its existence or nonexistence.\nThe major sink of atmospheric CH, is reaction with tropospheric OH (Levy, 1971):\nCH, + OH - CH, + H,O,\nwhich initiates a long series of reactions known as the methane oxidation chain and ultimately leads to the\nproduction of CO, H,CO, and H, (Levy, 1971, 1972; McConnell et al., 1971; and Wofsy et al., 1972). Thus, a\ndetermination of the loss rate of CH, requires knowledge of the tropospheric OH abundance. OH is initially\nproduced by\n0, + hv (Xc310 nm) - 0, + O(lD)\nwhile\nO(\xe2\x80\x98D) + H,O - 20H,\nand is converted to HO, by reactions in the methane oxidation chain as well as\nCO+OH-CO,+H\nfollowed by\nH+O,+M-HO,+M.\nThe reaction\nNO+HO,-NO,+OH\nacts to recycle OH from HO, and is a key reaction in the formation of 0, in the troposphere as well as lower\nstratosphere. Other sinks for OH involve chain terminating steps such as the heterogeneous removal of\nHNO,, CH,OOH, and H,O,. Photochemical models have predicted average, free-tropospheric OH levels of\n16 to 106 molecules cm-3 (Wofsy, 1976; Crutzen and Fishman, 1977; Chameides, 1978; and Chang et al.,\n1977), and recent measurements indicate at least qualitative agreement with these predictions (Wang et al.,\n1975; Davis et al., 1976; Perner et al., 1976; and Philen et al., 1978). Uncertainties in the NO and H20 levels\nin the troposphere as well as key rate constants cause uncertainty in the calculated OH abundance, and thus,\nin the rate of oxidation of CH, by OH. It is estimated that the tropospheric OH sink for CH, is about 200 to\n800 tg CH, per year.\n\n126\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nTropospheric Distribution\nSince stratospheric CH, originates from the troposphere (where it is injected into the atmosphere by\nbiospheric and lithospheric processes at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface), the stratospheric CH, abundance is determined\nby the tropospheric CH, concentration. Tropospheric CH, is relatively long-lived (a lifetime on the order of\n10 years), and is thus wel!-mixed throughout the troposphere, except near source regions. Observations indicate about 10% less CH, in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere (Wilkniss et al.,\n1973; Lamontagne et al., 1974; and Ehhalt, 1978b).\nThe possibility and implications of temporal variations in atmospheric CH, has been the subject of several recent studies (e.g., Sze and Rice, 1976; Chameides et al., 1977; Wang et al., 1976; and Logan et al., 1978). Recent measurements of a CH, abundance of 1.65 to 1.70 ppm (Heidt and Krasnec, 1978; Ehhalt, 1978b; Bush\net al., 1978; and Fabian et al., 1978); when compared to earlier determinations of about 1.40 ppm (Ehhalt and\nHeidt, 1973), imply a large increase in CH,. However, a re-examination of the earlier measurements indicates\nthat a CH, abundance of 1.60 ppm for the early 1970s is more appropriate (L. Heidt and D. Ehhalt, private\ncommunication, 1979) implying a small rise in CH4 over the decade. It is not clear if this apparent increase in\nthe CH, abundance, equivalent to the addition of about 150 tg CH, to an atmospheric burden of 4000 tg CH,\nis due to a real variation in the CH, sources or sinks, or is merely due to statistical or systematic errors in the\nmeasurement technique. A long-term program to measure the CH, abundance is needed to clarify temporal\nvariability.\n\nStratospheric Distribution\nThe CH, not destroyed in the troposphere is injected into the stratosphere where the principal loss processes\nare:\nCH, + OH - CH, + H,O\nCH, + O(lD) - CH, + OH\nCH, + O(l D) - H,CO + H,\n\nIt is estimated that oxidation\n\nin the stratosphere accounts for about 10% of the global CH, sink (Ehhalt,\n1974; and Wofsy, 1976). The increased intensity of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere results in higher\nconcentrations in OH and O(rD), which when coupled with the positive altitude gradient in temperature,\ncauses the CH, photochemical lifetime to decrease from about 100 years at 10 km, to 3 years at 30 km, and to\n0.2 years at 40 km. This decrease in photochemical lifetime, coupled with the slow rate of transport through\nthe tropopause results in a decreasing CH, mixing ratio with altitude in the stratosphere and mesosphere.\nFigure 3-15 illustrates the most recent observations of CH, abundance as a function of altitude at various\nlatitudes. Although all profiles indicate a decrease of CH, with altitude, the shape of the profiles vary\nsignificantly between latitudes. The tropical profile of Bush et al. (1978) indicate a slow vertical decrease suggesting a relatively strong upward transport. The profiles at 32\xe2\x80\x9dN and to some extent at 44\xe2\x80\x9dN suggest a complicated transport pattern, with a steep decrease in CH, immediately above the tropopause, a layer of fairly\nconstant CH,, and above this layer a steep CH, decrease. Many more in situ profiles (or satellite data) are required before a meridional cross section of the CH, mixing ratio can be established, but the present data indicate that there should be quite significant latitudinal variations in the stratosphere.\n\nBUDGETS\n\n50\n\n:rrrf-nlT\n--i--l+\n4%\n\n32\xe2\x80\x9dN\n\n44ON\n\n127\n\n52\xe2\x80\x9d N\n\nI\n\nI\n0\n\nKFA\n\n40\nNCAR\n\nA\nI\n-c\nI\n\n,=,\na\n0\nm\n\n2 June\n1975\n14 Aug\n1975\n17Aug\n1975\n10Aug\n1976\n27 Jan. 27 Feb 1976\n14 Aug\n1977\n\nq\nI2\n\nI\n\n30\n\nNOAA\n\nA\n\n6.6March\n14 Feb\n\n1976\n1978\n\n2 Ott\nAckerman\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c0\n\n1977\n1977\n1977\n1977\n\n7 June\n16June\n12Sept\n26Sepr\n\nd\n0\n0\n\n1975\n\n2\n\n0\n\n5\na\n\n20\n\n%\\\n\nI\n\n_\\I\n-\n\n10\n\nCH4 MIXING\n\nRATIO\n\n-\n\nTtopopause\n\n(ppml\n\nNote: Data labeled NOAA were published by Bush et al.

The actual\ntropopause during the flights is indicated by the horizontal line.\nFigure 3-15. Vertical profiles of the CH4 mixing ratio in the stratosphere\nat various latitudes.\n\nAn important product of stratospheric CH, degradation is CO, which is also injected into the stratosphere by\ntropospheric-stratospheric\nexchange processes. Thus, stratospheric CO levels may be altered by variations in\natmospheric CH, as well as processes which cause changes in tropospheric CO levels, including anthropogenic\nactivities. Model calculations have revealed that an increase in lower stratospheric CO may lead to an\nenhancement in 0, via reactions similar to those associated with photochemical smog (Logan et al., 1978;\nButler et al., 1979) and further confirm the importance of the CH,-CO system for stratospheric ozone. The\ngross features of the tropospheric CO distribution are probably reasonably well represented by Seiler\xe2\x80\x99s (1974)\nmeridional CO cross section, with an average CO abundance of 0.11 ppm and about 2 to 3 times more CO in\nthe Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere. This hemispheric asymmetry has been\ninterpreted to indicate the importance of anthropogenic CO emissions relative to natural sources. Figure 3-16\nillustrates the observed stratospheric CO profiles, indicating a sharp decrease in CO above the tropopause\nfollowed by a relatively constant mixing ratio with altitude in the upper stratosphere.\nWater vapor is also an important product of CH, oxidation in the stratosphere as has been discussed in the\nsection on the water vapor budget.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n128\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nI m\n\nI\n\nI\nCurve\n\nSpring 1976,\nFarmer et al.\n\nHistogram\n\n18 Jan. 1972,\nGoldman et al.\n26 June 1978,\nFabian et al.\n14 June 1978,\nFabian et al.\n\nTropopause\n+-i$\n\nI\n4\n\nI\n\nI\n6\n\nIll\n\nI\n8\n\n10\n\nI\n\n20\nCO MIXING\n\nFigure 3-16.\n\nI\n\n,\n\nI\n\nIIIII\n\n40\n\n60\n\nRATIO\n\n80 100\n\n200\n\n(ppb)\n\nVertical profiles of the CO mixing ratio in the stratosphere.

Since the sources of NMHC (like those of CH4)\nare located at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, reactive varieties are too short-lived to be transported across the tropopause\nand directly affect the stratosphere. However, unreactive NMHC (such as C,H,, C,H,, C,Hs, C,Ht,, and\nCSHr2) are sufficiently long-lived to have a possibly significant flux into the stratosphere, depending on their\nsource rates at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nObservations indicate background tropospheric abundance of unreactive NMHC in the range of 0.1 to 1.0\nppb (Cavanaugh et al., 1969; Research Triangle Institute, 1974; Grenda and Goldstein, 1977; Singh et al.,\n1978; Rasmussen and Robinson, 1977; and Cronn et al., 1977).\nTypically, concentrations of 1.O ppb are found for C,H, and 0.2 ppb for C,H,. Somewhat lower concentrations of C,H, and C,H, are found in the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern Hemisphere, probably indicating hemispherically asymmetric sources. A comprehensive inventory of C,H, and C,H, sources\nhas not been made, and it is not certain if the major unreactive NMHC sources are of natural or anthropogenic origin. Observations by Grenda and Goldstein (1977) and others indicate that non-negligible C,H,\nemissions may be associated with gas fields. Significant concentrations of C,H, (0.2 to 0.5 ppb) and C,H,\n(0.02 to 0.05 ppb) have been observed in the lower stratosphere (Rasmussen and Robinson, 1977; and Cronn\nand Robinson, 1979) and these observations are in qualitative agreement with 1-D model calculations of the\nvertical profile of NMHC (Chameides and Cicerone, 1978).\nChameides and Cicerone (1978) studied the photochemistry of these long-lived, unreactive NMHC and attempted to identify their stratospheric photochemical roles and budgets. The major sink for long-lived\nNMHC are photochemical reactions with OH in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, NMHC are destroyed\nby H abstraction reactions with Cl, as well as OH. (It is likely that NMHC have oxidation chains similar to\nthat of CH, as reported by Demerjian et al., 1974.) Chameides and Cicerone (1978) found that NMHC have a\nnegligible impact upon the stratospheric 0, system provided their tropospheric abundances are a few ppb or\nless and the product of the reaction\nCl + C,H, M CHCl = CH\nis photochemically destroyed before removal to the troposphere. If CHCl = CH were stable in the lower\nstratosphere, C,H, could act as a chain terminator, impeding catalytic removal of stratospheric 0, by Cl and\nClO.\nNormalizing to ground-level mixing ratios of 1 ppb for C,H, and 0.1 ppb for C,H,, C,Hs, C,H,c, and\nC,Ht , 1 D model calculations imply ground-level sources, in molecules cm-2s-1, of 2.6 x IO9 for C,H,, 1.8\n;b x 10 for C,H,, 9.3 x lo8 for C,H,, 1.5 x log for C,H,c, and 2.1 x log for C,H,,; equivalent\nto a total unreactive NMHC source due to natural or anthropogenic activities or about 100 tg per year. The\ncorresponding rates of injection into the stratosphere for these assumed ground-level abundances, in\nmolecules cm-2s-t, were 1.2 x 108 for C,H,, 9 x 106 for C2H2, 1.0 x lo8 for C,H,, 5.6 x\n10\xe2\x80\x99 for C,H,,, and 3.0 x 10\xe2\x80\x99 for C,H,,. Proportionally smaller or larger NMHC source strengths and fluxes\nare implied by smaller or larger ground-level mixing ratios. However, a complete understanding of the\nbudgets and role of NMHC in the stratosphere will have to await more detailed measurements and laboratory\nstudies.\n\n130\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nHYDROGEN\nMolecular hydrogen, H,, has a tropospheric abundance of about 0.5 ppm with a relatively uniform distribution in the vertical and horizontal (Schmidt, 1974; and Ehhalt et al., 1977). The average H, abundance in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about 0.02 ppm lower than in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe tropospheric H2 budget was reviewed by Schmidt (1974), who estimated an H2 residence time of 4 to 7\nyears. Schmidt included sources from anthropogenic activities, photochemistry (H,CO photolysis in the\nmethane oxidation chain), ocean emissions, and emissions from soils and sinks from photochemistry (H2 +\nOH - H + H20), and soil losses. The major processes identified were anthropogenic production and soil\nlosses and the total atmospheric budget comprised a turnover of about 30 to 40 tg per year (or 6 to 9 x 10\xe2\x80\x990\ncm-2s\xe2\x80\x991). Zimmerman et al. (1978) have proposed an additional source from the oxidation of nonmethane\nhydrocarbons from vegetation of 10 to 35 tg per year.\nFigure 3-17 illustrates H, stratospheric profiles at various latitudes taken from Ehhalt et al. (1978) and Fabian\net al. (1978). The profiles indicate a relatively constant stratospheric mixing ratio in the vertical and a smal!\nlatitudinal variation. Stratospheric H, is produced from the photolysis of H,CO, which, in turn, is produced\nfrom CH, oxidation. Above 40 km,\nH + HO, - H, + 0,\nis also a significant H, source as well as a chain terminator for free radicals. The major sinks of stratospheric\nH, are the oxidation of H, by OH and OCIO. Model calculations indicate that the stratosphere may be a small\nnet source of H,, with a column production rate of 7.5 x log cm-2s-1 and loss rate of 4.0 x log cmm2s1(Liu,\nprivate communication, 1979).\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC SULFUR\nINTRODUCTION\nThe sulfur budget of the stratosphere is closely related to that in the troposphere, which is quite uncertain in\nseveral respects. As a result, it is not appropriate at this time to construct an overall budget. Instead, this section discusses current knowledge of the specific sources and sinks of the sulfur compounds, their measured\nconcentrations, their chemical processes, and the implications of sulfur compounds for the chemistry of the\nstratosphere. Such information is required for the eventual construction of a detailed atmospheric sulfur\nbudget.\n\nTROPOSPHERIC SOURCES AND SINKS\nTropospheric sources and sinks, together with appropriate transformation processes, are the items that constitute a sulfur budget. Such budgets have been prepared in recent years by Robinson and Robbins (1968),\nKellogg et al. (1972), Friend (1973), Granat et al. (1976) and Rodhe (1978); and some aspects of sulfur budget\nconstruction are discussed in detail by Hitchcock et al. (1979). For the purposes of stratospheric sulfur assessment, it is most important to discriminate between major and minor processes, to indicate the areas of major\nuncertainty, and to identify those aspects of atmospheric sulfur that have not been included at all in sulfur\nbudget assessments.\n\n131\n\nBUDGETS\n\nI\n\nI\n\n50\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\n\n40\n\n-z\nY\nE\n?\nF\n2\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\nH2 MIXING\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\nRATIO\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n(ppm)\n\nFigure 3-17.

Similar processes occur in oceanic surface\nfilms, at least in nutrient-rich areas. Lovelock et al. (1972) have proposed that dimethyl sulfide is emitted in\nquantities comparable to H,S, a thesis supported to some extent by measurements of dimethyl sulfide in\nocean waters (Nguyen et al., 1978) and by atmospheric modeling studies (Graedel, 1979). Other sulfur species\nmay be emitted as well. Sulfur budget studies have generally estimated natural gas-phase emissions by using\nvalues that make the budgets balance. The fluxes estimated in this way range from 34 to 92 tg per year, the\ndifference reflecting conflicting results for other budget components.\nVolcanoes are the primary natural source of oxygen-containing sulfur compounds, mostly in the form of\nsulfur dioxide (White and Waring, 1963; Shepherd, 1938; Nordlie, 1971; and Cadle et al., 1978). Various\nestimates have been made of average annual volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide, with extremes ranging from\n1.5 tg (Kellogg et al., 1972) to 40 tg (Naughton et al., 1975). These estimates are complicated both by the\nstatistical fluctuations in active volcano eruptions and by the temporal emission fluctations of individual\nvolcanoes (Malinconico, 1979). The more recent flux estimates have clustered nearer the high end of this\nrange, and biogenic and volcanic fluxes of sulfur seem likely to be of similar magnitude. COS, CS,, H,S, and\npossibly other sulfur compounds are also emitted by volcanoes. The amounts are probably not large, but remain to be accurately assessed.\nSea water contains about 2.65 milligrams of sulfate per gram of water, and sea-salt particles formed by the\nbreaking of bubbles introduce large amounts of sulfate into the atmosphere. However, most of this particulate material very soon returns to the ocean and is not an important source of stratospheric sulfate.\nEriksson (1960) estimated that 13 tg per year of sea-salt sulfate passes over the continents.. However, data are\nvery sparse and confirmation of this estimate is desirable.\nAnthropogenic sources of sulfur compounds emit largely sulfur dioxide with smaller amounts of carbon\ndisulfide, sulfuric acid, carbonyl sulfide, and a number of organic sulfur compounds. The main anthropogenic source of emission to the air is the burning of fossil fuels. Recent estimates for the emission of\nsulfur are as much as 65 tg per year. The estimates do not yet include fluxes of COS from combustion and\nother sources (Crutzen, 1976; and Turco et al., 1979c), CS2, from a variety of industrial operations (Peyton et\nal., 1976), or mercaptans and sulfides from pulp mills and other sources (Graedel, 1977). It may be quite important to establish these fluxes accurately, because of the long tropospheric lifetimes of some of the compounds.\nRainout and washout are major mechanisms for the removal of sulfur dioxide and sulfate ions from the\ntroposphere. Estimates of the quantities removed by these means are based on analysis of precipitation and\nestimates of the total global annual rainfall, usually calculated as excess sulfite, (i.e., total sulfate from all\nsources other than sea salt). The derived removal fluxes have ranged from 106 to 350 tg per year, the most recent estimates being at the low end of this range. A major difficulty in arriving at this estimate is the lack of\nprecipitation chemistry data for many parts of the globe.\nThe other principal sink for the removal of tropospheric sulfur is dry deposition of sulfur dioxide and sulfate\nat the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface as a result of turbulent diffusion and sedimentation. Estimates of this quantity have\nranged from 38 to 75 tg per year, not including sea-salt sulfate.\n\nTRANSPORT BETWEEN THE TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE\nA single, extremely violent volcanic eruption may introduce sufficient sulfur compounds into the stratosphere\nto exceed (by an order of magnitude or more) that from any other source for a year or two (Cadle and Grams,\n1975). If many such eruptions occur during an extended time period, they can appreciably affect the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nclimate by affecting its radiation balance (Lamb, 1970). Most of this sulfur is converted to impure sulfuric\nacid by the oxidation and hydration of sulfur dioxide. The dispersion of volcanic sulfur in the stratosphere\nhas been discussed by Lamb (1970) Cadle et al. (1976), and Cadle et al. (1977).\n\nBUDGETS\n\n133\n\nAfter two or more years have elapsed since a major explosive volcanic eruption, stratospheric sulfur may be\ndominated by that crossing the tropopause as a result of the atmospheric circulation. Aitken particles, including sulfates and sulfuric acid, which serve as nuclei for the condensation of sulfuric acid vapor, sulfur\ndioxide, various sulfates (including sulfuric acid, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide) are probably the major sulfur compounds which reach- the stratosphere in this manner. Exchange processes between the\ntroposphere and the stratosphere have been reviewed by Reiter (1975).\nLazrus and Gandrud (1974a) have estimated that 0.14 tg of SO,, or of SO, precursors would have to enter the\nstratosphere each year to maintain the sulfur in the stratosphere as sulfuric acid during periods of little explosive volcanic activity.\n\nAEROSOL FORMATION\nVarious sampling studies and numerical models have provided evidence that stratospheric aerosols are\ngenerated in situ via the reaction of sulfur bearing gases (Junge et al., 1961; Turco et al., 1979a). An extensive\nstudy of the temporal and spatial distribution of the sulfur isotope ratio by Castleman et al. (1973) has borne\nthis out. As a result of elementary modeling calculations and the results of laboratory experiments, Castleman\net al. (1975a; 1976/77); Davis et al. (1979); and Moortgat and Junge (1977) have speculated that the\nstratospheric aerosol layer originates, at least in part, from SO, oxidation via OH. Other candidates for the\norigin of the sulfur component of the aerosol layer are COS (Cadle and Crutzen, 1975) and CS, as a precursor\nto COS (Sze and Ko, 1979a).\n\nREMOVAL FROM THE STRATOSPHERE\nThe sink for stratospheric sulfur compounds is transport to the tropopause where they are removed by the\nprocesses described above. Gases and particles smaller than 1 or 2 micrometers in diameter are transported to\nthe troposphere by descending air (Reiter, 1975). Larger particles and small particles that grow into the larger\nsize range by agglomeration, or by vapor condensation are usually removed by sedimentation.\n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF STRATOSPHERIC SULFUR\nSulfides and Mercaptans\nH,S, the most common of the sulfides, is known to be a component of volcanic gas emissions (Huntingdon,\n1973). Therefore, it is likely that volcanic eruptions which penetrate the tropopause inject H,S into the\nstratosphere. At present, the fluxes of H,S from such sources cannot be estimated accurately, but are certainly much less than those of SO,.\nThere is no evidence yet for the existence of organic sulfides in the stratosphere. However, members of this\nchemical group are ubiquitous in the troposphere, generally at low concentrations. Their lifetimes are on the\norder of a few days (Graedel, 1978), which appear to preclude their diffusion into the stratosphere.\n\nCarbon Disulfide and Carbonyl Sulfide\nCarbonyl sulfide (COS) has only recently been detected in the stratosphere, but appears to be a major component of the stratospheric sulfur cycle except following major volcanic eruptions. It is present in the\ntroposphere at about 500 ppt (Torres et al., 1978). Measurements of COS in air samples obtained above the\ntropopause by high-flying aircraft indicate concentrations of 14 to 524 ppt (Inn et al., 1979) at different\naltitudes and seasons.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nCarbon disulfide (CS3 is found in the troposphere at concentrations within the range 70 to 370 ppt (Sandalls\nand Penkett, 1977) and has a life-time of about half a year (Graedel, 1978). It has not been detected thus far,\nhowever.\nCOS and possibly CS, are minor constituents of volcanic emissions (Stoiber et al., 1971) and thus, like H,S,\nare expected to enter the stratosphere in volcanic eruptions that penetrate the tropopause. As with H,S, the\nfluxes from such processes cannot be accurately estimated at present.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\nSO, appears to be a major gas-phase constituent of the stratospheric sulfur cycle. Its concentrations have\nbeen measured on only four occasions, but with results that differ very widely. Jaeschke et al. (1976)\nmeasured approximately .05 ppb SO, at 13 km. Data from two recent balloon flights by Mauersberger and\nFinstad (1978) give an SO, concentration of approximately 10 ppb within an altitude range of 25 to 35 km.\nThese could all be consistent if SO, is being produced at higher altitudes by chemical reaction of other sulfurcontaining compounds. The balloon observation of Sagawa and Itoh (1977) report SO, concentrations at 18\nto 30 km of 10 to 30 ppm. These numbers are so much higher than are seen near major tropospheric sources\nthat they seem unlikely to be realistic.\nVolcanic plumes generally possess high SO, concentrations and volcanic eruptions are thus capable of major\nmodifications in the stratospheric sulfur balance if tropopause penetration occurs.\n\nCOMPOSITION OF STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS\nAerosol\nplosive\ntion to\nsulfuric\n\nparticles in the stratosphere consist largely of volcanic ash for periods of a few months following exeruptions; at other times they consist largely of impure sulfuric acid (Cadle and Grams, 1975). In addiH,SO,, the particles may contain (NH&SO,\n(Friend, 1966) (NH&S,Os\n(Friend, 1966), nitrosyl\nacid NOHS04 (Farlow et al., 1978) and nitrosyl pyrosulfate NOHS,O, (Farlow et al., 1978).\n\nGenerally, stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations fall in the range 0.1 to 1.5 rig/g of air. Strong\nlatitudinal, altitude, and seasonal variations appear to be present. Figures 3-18 and 3-19 show the most complete sulfate concentration observations made to date, although these may be relevant only to the time and\nregion to which the observations apply.\n\nCHEMICAL REACTIONS OF STRATOSPHERIC SULFUR\nSulfides and Mercaptans\nThe initial reaction of these compounds involve hydrogen atom extraction by OH to give the thiyl (HS) or\nthioxyl (RSO) radical. The subsequent reactions of these radicals have not been determined with certainty,\nbut the available evidence (Graedel, 1977, 1978; and Thiemens and Schwartz, 1978) suggests that the sulfur in\nthe original compound is converted rapidly to SO, by reaction with molecular oxygen.\nCarbon Disulfide\nCarbon disulfide reacts with the hydroxyl radical. Although the intermediate states are unclear (Sannigrahi et\nal., 1977; Kurylo, 1978; and White and Gardiner, 1978), the sulfur-containing products have been suggested\nto be COS and HS (Kurylo and Laufer, 1979). If COS is confirmed as a product, CS, will be a global source\nof COS that may be significant if CS, is sufficiently abundant (Sze and Ko, 1979a). Photolysis of CS, can occur at wavelengths less than 230 nm to yield, in oxygen, COS and SO, (Wood and Heicklen, 1971).\n\n135\n\nBUDGETS\n\nI8 -L\nt\n17\n\n\\\n\nf--J\n\n\\-\n\n/I\n\nI\\\\\n\n1.3*\n\n+0.12*0.11--,\n\nc.65\xe2\x80\x9d37-0.32-0.32-\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\\\nI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n70\n\n60\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\nIO\n\n0\n\nIO\n\n20\n\n30\n\nLATITUDE\nNote:\n\nThe numbers on the isopleths are grams \xe2\x80\x983,f SO; x 10e9 per gram of air.\n\nFigure 3-18.

Whether addition or abstraction occurs is uncertain (as for CS.&\nbut SO, or other oxygen-containing\nsulfur compounds are likely products. COS will photolyze at\nstratospheric wavelengths to produce a free sulfur atom (Donovan, 1969; and Crutzen, 1976) that will promptly form SO (Davis et al., 1972) and then SO, (Schofield, 1973).\n\nSulfur Dioxide\nThe principal reactions of SO, are with the OH and HO, radicals. The product in the former case is the HSO,\nradical; its subsequent reactions are not known, but appear certain to lead monotonically to sulfate aerosol\n(Davis et al., 1979; and Friend et al., 1979). SO, reaction with HO, produces S03, which combines directly\nwith water vapor to yield sulfuric acid. The conversion of gas-phase sulfur compounds to particulate sulfur\ncompounds has been studied theoretically by Turco et al. (1979a); further research in this difficult field is\nneeded.\n\nSulfate Aerosol\nReactions of the sulfate anion can take place upon the stratospheric aerosol particles. Chemical studies of the\naerosol suggest that ammonia vapor may add to sulfuric acid aerosol to produce ammonium sulfate or ammonium hydrogen sulfate, and that nitrogen dioxide vapor may add to produce nitrosyl sulfate and nitrosyl\npyrosulfate. The heterogeneous loss of SO, and other stable stratospheric molecules to the stratospheric\naerosol has been discussed by Cadle et al. (1975); the processes are potentially significant as loss mechanisms.\n\nCHEMICAL SUMMARY\nThe stratospheric chemistry of sulfur is summarized on the schematic flow chart of figure 3-20. Two features\ndeserve comment. The first is that the hydroxyl radical and solar radiation are the significant chain initiators;\nthe second, that the sulfur atoms proceed unremittingly in the direction of increased oxidation state, ending\nwith the + 6 state as sulfate aerosol. All species and reactions shown dotted on this figure need confirmation\nby laboratory experiments; they are important but uncertain parameters in stratospheric sulfur chemistry.\n\nStratospheric Implications of Sulfur Chemistry\nThe most important chemical function of stratospheric sulfur compounds appears to be the removal of\nhydroxyl radicals from the stratospheric odd-hydrogen cycle. This effect, normally small compared to\nremoval of OH by CH, and CO, may be particularly important after volcanic injection of sulfur compounds\ninto the stratosphere; Cadle et al. (1978) have calculated that a major depletion of OH may occur following\nsuch an event as a result of OH reaction with SO,. Reaction of OH with other sulfur compounds would add to\nthis effect.\nIt appears certain that both NH, and NO, can be incorporated into sulfate aerosol, and thus lost to\nstratospheric odd-nitrogen processes. The magnitude of such effects is probably small, but needs to be quantitatively assessed. They could affect the composition, index of refraction, and radiative transfer processes\nassociated with stratospheric aerosols.\n\n138\n\nc\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nHO,..\n\nn\n\nI-CH,O,.\n\nL------,\nI\n\nI\n\nNH).\nNO:\nH20\n\nNote: Stable stratospheric species are indicated by rectangular boxes, transient\nspecies by diamonds.

Fluxes of COS and CS, from tropospheric sources including\nvolcanoes, and the tropospheric and stratospheric concentration of SO,, COS, and CS, are perhaps the most\nsignificant of the factors that are, at present, either poorly established or undetermined. It is clear that sulfur\nchemistry can markedly perturb the stratosphere during periods of major volcanic eruptions. The diffusion of\ntropospheric sulfur compounds into the stratosphere may be great enough to render sulfur chemistry significant at other times as well. The transformation of gaseous sulfur into sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere and\nthe importance of the stratospheric aerosol to global radiation and climate suggest that studies of sulfur in the\nstratosphere should be promptly and vigorously pursued.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC PARTICLES\nSIZE DISTRIBUTION\nThe size distribution of stratospheric aerosol particles has been reviewed by Cadle and Grams (1975). The\nconcentrations in the stratosphere of Aitken particles (namely those having radii less than 0.1 micrometers)\nhave been determined by several groups using condensation nucleus counters. These methods determine the\nconcentration of essentially all particles greater than a critical size. It depends on the supersaturation\nemployed in the chamber of the counter, but since concentrations of Aitken particles in the stratosphere\ngreatly exceed the concentrations of the larger ones, such methods largely measure the concentrations of\nAitken particles. By changing the supersaturation, rough indications of the size distribution within the Aitken\nsize range can be achieved in principle, but to date this has not been particularly successful. So-called mobility\ntechniques have indicated quite varying size distributions for the Aitken particles; distributions that are often\nbimodal.\nConsiderably more information is available concerning the concentrations and size distribution of particles\nexceeding 0.1 micrometer radius than concerning the Aitken particles. These are often plotted as dN/dlog R\nagainst the log of the radius or diameter. Often the curves have a slope of about - 2 for particles larger than\nabout 0.1 micrometers, and this slope has sometimes been stated to be typical of stratospheric particles.\nHowever, numerous measurements have indicated marked departures from the slope of - 2, and at times, the\noverall curves are multimodal.\n\nCOMPOSITION\nAs a result of the work of Cadle and coworkers (Cadle et al., 1970) stratospheric aerosols are known to contain the elements Si, Na, Cl, Mn, Br, as well as nitrates and sulfates (See table 3-10). A relatively persistent\naerosol layer is known to be distributed between approximately 17 and 40 km elevation, but with wide variations in number density existing around the globe; stratification\nwith altitude is also known to be\ncharacteristic of the layer (Farlow et al., 1979). Measurements by Junge et al., (1961a), showed the average\nparticle size of stratospheric aerosols to be = 0.3pm diameter with sulfate representing the single most abundant chemical component. This fact has been borne out by the work of Friend (1966).\nAlthough early measurements suggested the presence of ammonium ions chemically combined with the\nsulfate, subsequent work by Manson et al. (1961) indicate that this conclusion must be taken with caution\nsince handling procedures can introduce ammonia as a contaminate in the particles after collection. However,\nBigg et al. (1970) have presented morphological evidence suggesting that the percentage of sulfate existing as\nammonium sulfate increases somewhat with altitude. More recently, Farlow and coworkers (1978) have acquired tentative evidence that other compounds such as NOHSO,, NOHS,O,, (NH&&O,\nand possibly\nsodium sulfate, as well as ammonium sulfate, are also important components of the stratospheric aerosol.\n\n140\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nTable 3-10\nChemical Composition of Stratospheric Aerosols*\n-ILocation/Dat\n\nso,\n\nSi \xe2\x80\x99\n\nTrace Elemen (mi\nI NOj I Mn Br\n\n\xe2\x80\x980.\n\n5.0\n\n0.02 0.3\n\n16.\n\n6.4\n\n0\n\n0.35\n\n0\n\n0\n\nmoles\n-q\n\n-\n\nI\n\n1110\nK\n\nNO,&\n\nIS-19km\n3\xe2\x80\x99S-I IoN\n\n0\n\nJuly 69\n17-18km\n18-32\xe2\x80\x99N\n\nJuly 69\n17-19km\n34-48\xe2\x80\x9d N\n\n31.\n\n19.\n\n0.35\n\nD.2S\n\n8.3\n\n13.4\n\n1 I.\n\n3.6\n\n0.06\n\n3.1 1\n\n1.7\n\n7.7\n\nDec. 69\n\n7ti-12km **\n1I-35\xe2\x80\x99N\nNov. 69\n\n*Data of Cadle et al. (1970) averaged and recalculated.\n**Upper tropical troposphere.\n\nAlthough there is no definite evidence concerning the cation with which sulfate is in chemical composition,\nthe work of Rosen (1971) and Toon and Pollack (1973) suggests the presence of a substantial quantity of\nsulfuric acid in the stratospheric aerosol. Calculations by Kiang et al. (1973, 1975) indicate that H,SO, might\nalso nucleate with HNO,; however, whether HNO, is actually present in the aerosol or only distributed as a\nvapor species at similar altitudes is still a controversial subject warranting further study. Regarding the very\nsmall (Aitken) particles which may represent those formed most recently, there is virtually no information\nabout their chemical composition.\nEven less is known about aerosols at the higher elevations. On the basis of optical observations, some\nevidence for the occasional existence of aerosols at the stratopause has been presented in the literature\n(Rossler, 1968; Clemesha and Simonich, 1978; Kent et al., 1971). These higher altitude particles are thought\nto result from products of meteoritic ablation, formed in the neighborhood of 90 km, and settling through the\nlower regions of the atmosphere.\nThere is an urgent need for knowledge of aerosol molecular composition as a function of particle size. Such\ndata require very carefully designed experiments and it is not clear that the problem is amenable to study with\nexisting techniques. Yet, without such data it is difficult to assess proposed mechanisms and models of\naerosol formation. The paucity of such data also makes an assessment of potentially important catalytic surface mechanisms rather speculative.\n\nBUDGETS\n\n141\n\nMASS CONCENTRATIONS\nMass concentrations of stratospheric particles have proved to be extremely variable. Measurements by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and also by Castleman et al. (1974) have shown that\nduring the period from 1963 to 1973, the concentrations in the vicinity of the peak concentration of the sulfate\nlayer varied from about 0.001 to 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter of ambient air at about 18 kilometers\naltitude. Multiplying these values by approximately 20 would convert them to concentrations in terms of parts\nper billion of particulate matter by mass. The reason for the wide variation in concentration is that major\nvolcanic eruptions inject very large amounts of particulate material (especially ash and sulfuric acid) and also\nextremely large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. In fact, sulfur compounds injected into the\natmosphere by volcanoes consist largely of sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide is slowly converted to sulfuric\nacid droplets over periods of several months, probably by reaction with OH. At the same time, the large particles of ash settle out of the stratosphere. The effect of a single, very large eruption on the concentration of\nparticles in the stratosphere can last for as long as two years. During 1963 to 1973, a number of highly explosive volcanic eruptions occurred, and the eruption clouds penetrated the tropopause. The largest of these\nwas that of Agung in Bali in 1963. Toward the end of the decade, the effects of the volcanic eruptions on the\nparticulate content of the stratosphere disappeared and the lowest values obtained were for that later time. A\nvalue of about .Ol micrograms per cubic meter of sulfate at the levels of the highest concentration in the\nsulfate layer might be considered average for the concentration in the absence of a perturbation as a result of\nvolcanic activity.\nDuring the decade 1963 to 1973, perhaps 60% of the time the stratospheric concentration of particles was perturbed as a result of volcanic eruptions. In 1974, an eruption by Fuego in Guatemala took place, which again\nintroduced very large amounts of material into the stratosphere; the effects of this were observed until about\n1976. Since that time, the concentrations (judging from lidar measurements) have remained those of the\nunperturbed atmosphere. Lazrus and Gandrud (1974a) have estimated that 0.14 tg of sulfur dioxide (or of\nsulfur dioxide precursors) calculated as SO, would have to enter the stratosphere each year to maintain the\nsulfur in the stratosphere during periods of little explosive volcanic activity, based on sulfate concentrations\nduring Spring, 1973. Cadle et al. (1977) estimated that the Agung eruptions in 1963 in Bali introduced about\n12 tg of sulfur (calculated as sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere. The Fuego eruption in Guatemala in 1974\nwas estimated to have introduced one-fifth this amount of sulfur dioxide. It is important to realize that in\norder to estimate the effects of such volcanic eruptions on the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s radiation balance, the rates of\nspreading of volcanic debris in the stratosphere and also the rates of conversion of the sulfur dioxide to\nsulfuric acid must be taken into account. In addition, particle growth and particle sedimentation must be\ntaken into account, and the transport of stratospheric material into the troposphere by means of atmospheric\ntransport processes considered. These factors can be taken into account by means of actual measurement of\nthe concentration of particulate material in the stratosphere, by the measurements of atmospheric turbidity,\nor by means of modeling.\n\nNUMBER CONCENTRATIONS\nThe number concentrations of Aitken particles vary from a few hundred near the tropopause to fractions of a\nparticle per cubic centimeter at altitudes above about 20 kilometers. There is much uncertainty concerning the\neffects of volcanic eruptions on the concentrations of these small particles. The effects of volcanoes on mass\nconcentrations are primarily the result of particles that are larger than 0.1 micrometer radius. Furthermore,\nthe Aitken particles do not exhibit the maxima corresponding to the sulfate layer, as mentioned earlier. The\nnumber concentrations of the larger particles may vary to a much greater extent than those of the Aitken particle. In general, the surface mean diameter of the particles is probably in the vicinity of 0.2 micrometers\nradius. The radius of the particles of mean mass is probably somewhat larger than this, but any such figures\nare highly uncertain in view of the variability in the estimate of size distribution as has previously been mentioned.\n\n142\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nSOURCES\nVolcanic sources have already been discussed at length, and the fact has already briefly been mentioned that\nthe sulfur dioxide introduced by volcanoes is probably converted to sulfuric acid primarily by reaction with\nOH. It might also be pointed out that the reaction of sulfur dioxide with OH when the sulfur dioxide concentrations are high can deplete the affected portions of the stratosphere of OH; this effect has been noted by\ncm6s1 is assumed, and it is also assumed that two OH\nCadle et al. (1979). A rate constant of about 3 x 10m31\nradicals are involved in the conversion to sulfuric acid. The OH is largely formed by the reaction of O(lD)\nwith water to form 20H, and the rate constant for this reaction is assumed to be 7 x lo-r0 cm3s1. Then,\nassuming a water vapor concentration of 1013 cm-3 and daytime concentrations of OH to be 5 x lo5 cm-3 (in\nthe absence of large quantities of SO,) and O(\xe2\x80\x98D) of 0.5 cmJ, and equating the rates of formation and depletion of OH, the volcanic SO2 will deplete the stratosphere of OH until the SO, concentration drops to 4\nppbm. Of course, this calculation is a considerable oversimplification;\nfor example, it neglects other reactions\nof OH, but it does demonstrate that volcanic SO, can markedly deplete the affected portion of the\nstratosphere of OH. Conversely, higher values of SO, concentrations than 4 ppbm in the equation yield\nvalues of OH less than 5 x lo5 cm -3. Sources of sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere during periods when there\nhas been little volcanic activity (at least little explosive activity) have been discussed in the section on the\nstratospheric sulfur budget.\nThe possibility exists that sulfate aerosol from the troposphere is transported into the stratosphere and influences the stratospheric sulfate budget. The amounts are thought to be negligible but there is little direct\nevidence on this issue. Figure 3-18 supports this idea since it represents a situation relatively unperturbed by\nfresh volcanic injections.\nSUMMARY\nIn this chapter we have reviewed available information on the stratospheric budgets of key chemicals and\nchemical groups. For the chlorofluoromethanes\nwhere global emissions are known to within f 5%, the\namounts that enter the stratosphere annually are uncertain only to the extent that unknown tropospheric\nremoval processes might exist. It is clear that most of the CFMs do reach the stratosphere but the determination of the exact extent of tropospheric removal loss, if any, must await better absolute calibrations and\nlonger term temporal trend data than now available. Of the other key gases in atmospheric chemistry and\nradiation several are biogenic: CH,, N,O, and possibly certain sulfur-containing gases. For CH, virtually no\nbackground trend data exist and although reasonable annual budgets have been deduced, they are based on\nvery few field measurements. Nitrous oxide is now thought to be very long-lived in the troposphere so that its\nprincipal sinks are stratospheric; one such reaction comprises the principal source of stratospheric NO,. The\nrelative importance of the oceans, combustion, inland waters, loss from fertilized fields and from animal\nwastes as atmospheric N,O sources is not yet clear and the classical view that biogenic N,O results solely from\ndenitrification (in anerobic environments) is being challenged by recent data on ammonium oxidation as an\nN,O source. Global COZ levels continue to rise. While we are fortunate to have a 25-year data base, the extent\nto which the biosphere and the ocean can accommodate ever-increasing amounts of anthropogenic CO, is not\nwell determined. The origin of the stratospheric sulfate particles and their exact role in climate control are still\nnot clear and the global sulfur cycle itself needs research to determine the principal species involved in sulfur\ntransfer and the relative contributions of man and nature. Fluxes of sulfur to the stratosphere as COS, CS,,\nand SO, are suggested but unmeasured. Mechanisms that control stratospheric water vapor concentrations\nare now under active study; with the increased accuracy and coverage possible with modern instrumentation,\nwe expect a greatly improved understanding of its distribution and variability to be gained in the next several\nyears.\n\nRADICALS,\n\nCHAPTER 4\nRESERVOIRS,\n\nAND IONS\n\nNEUTRAL SPECIES\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section discusses radicals and reservoirs, herein defined as those molecules chemically formed in the\nstratosphere. For convenience they are divided into 9 groups as shown in table 4-l. The purpose of this discussion is threefold:\n(1) To review the available library of data on those constituents which are currently believed to be of primary\nimportance to stratospheric ozone photochemistry. In most cases, only the most recent publications by\neach measurement group are cited so that all previous observations are appraised therein by those authors\nin terms of recent improvements in experimental technique, improved data coverage, etc.\n(2) To identify emerging problems by comparing calculated and observed concentration profiles of those\nconstituents for which a developing data base exists, such as NO, NO,, HNO,, O(3P), Cl, ClO, OH,\nHO,, HCl, CIONO,\n(3) To appraise emerging research objectives in the field of observational\nstratospheric\nozone\nphotochemistry, including those questions which remain unsolved since the writing of NASA RP-1010\nand those which have emerged during the past two years of research.\nThe group preparing this section was particularly concerned with the problem of achieving a compromise between completeness in the coverage of data sources and coherence in the comparison between observed and\ncalculated concentration profiles in view of the broad audience which this document must serve. To achieve\nthis compromise it was decided to deal with the data base on four levels. First, a table giving the most recent\nreferences for observations of these constituents was constructed which lists the analytical method, date,\nlatitude, solar zenith angle, and season of the observation, the observed concentration or mixing ratio at\nvarious altitudes, and any subjective comments of importance to the measurement such as observations made\nsimultaneously with the constituent listed, observation platforms used, etc. Second, the tabulated data were\nreviewed and those observations which could be compared directly with model calculations were chosen and\npresented in graphical form. In view of the need to condense an observational data base for an inherently\nvariable natural system given a wide range of latitude, solar zenith angle, season, etc., represented by the\nobservations, a brief overview of the observations for each molecule is given. Third, for those constituents\nwhich could be represented by an altitude distribution in the stratosphere, graphs were prepared representing\nthe range of available observations and the mean of those observations. The danger of oversimplification exists in the determination of this mean, and care was taken to represent as completely as possible the logic applied to the condensation. Considerable guidance was taken from the models discussed in Chapter 7 to determine this mean only when a meaningful correlation could be made with the calculated profiles. For example,\nonly when small variations within a range of solar zenith angles were predicted by the models was a mean of\nthe observations which fell within that range of solar zenith angles determined. Emphasis was given in this\nsection to a comparison between experimental uncertainties and the observed range of concentrations. Finally, those profiles representing the range and mean of the observations were overlayed with current model\ncalculations for the appropriate latitude, season and solar zenith angles.\n\n143\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n144\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nTable 4-1\nNeutral Species of Interest\n\nGroup 1\n\nO(3P), o(\xe2\x80\x98D>, O,(\xe2\x80\x98A>, 02C121,\n\nGroup 2\n\nK OH,\n\nGroup 3\nGroup 4\n\nN, NO, NO23 NO33 N205\nNH3, HNO, HONO, HON02, HOz NO2\n\nGroup 5\n\nCl, ClO, OClO, C102, C103, HCl, HOCl, C10N02\n\nGroup 6\n\nBr, BrO, OBrO, BrOz, HBr, HOBr, BrON02\n\nGroup 7\n\nF, FO, HF, FOH, FON02\n\nGroup 8\n\nS, SO, S02, SO\xe2\x80\x98,, HS, H2S, COS, CS2\n\nGroup 9\n\nCO, CH2 0, CH3 02, CH3 OH, CH:, , CH3 0,\n\nHO2,\n\nH2\n\n>HzO,\n\n03\n\nH202\n\nCHO, CHJOOH, CH,ONO, CH30N02,\nC2 H5, HCOOH, CH3 CHO, C2H5 ONO, C2H2 02, OCZH2 0.\n\nTABULATION\n\nOF DATA\n\nThe purpose of table 4-2 is to review, in condensed form, the available literature on those constituents involved directly in chemical exchange processes in the stratosphere that have a demonstrated relationship to\nthe photochemistry of ozone. This choice reflects our current perceptions of stratospheric photochemistry\nrather than a representation of current analytical methods. A collation of the available data was significantly\nmore complex for this document than for NASA RP-1010 two years ago, emphasizing the rapid expansion in\nour observational knowledge of stratospheric photochemistry resulting from the proliferation of new techniques. The expanded data base has begun to test many of the hypotheses which form the basis of chemical\nmodels used to predict changes in the total column concentration of stratospheric ozone.\n\nAtomic Oxygen\nAtomic oxygen, in its 3P ground state, has been observed on six occasions in situ through the middle and upper stratosphere by the parachute drop resonance fluorescence technique using the 130.4 nm triplet to induce\nfluorescence, as described in Anderson (1975, 1976, and 1979). The method provides vertical resolution on\nthe order of 0.2 km throughout the stratosphere. These data (figure 4-l) reveal significant local structure\nbelow -32 km except in the October 1977 and November 1978 observations.\nA simultaneous, in situ observation of O(3P) and 0, was made on December 2, 1977 using the above technique for O(3P) and a modified Dasibi instrument (see Robbins and Carnes, 1977) for the measurement of 0,\nby ultraviolet absorption at 253.7 nm; the results are displayed in figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 presents the observed\nratio, [O(3P)]/[03], obtained from that flight, a quantity which will be used to check the calculated steady\nstate ratio in the later section, Comparison with Theoretical Models. The atomic oxygen-ozone ratio will\nreceive careful attention as a more detailed consideration of the rate limiting processes governing the destruction of odd oxygen is attempted since O(3P) is involved in virtually every rate limiting 0, loss process above 30\nkm.\n\n03\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\n\nI(\n-\n\ni\n\nTable 4-2.

Observed [O(3P)] / [O,] ratio determined from simultaneous\nobservations of atomic oxygen and ozone.\n\nin situ\n\nO,(\xe2\x80\x98A)\nNumerous rocket measurements of the infrared atmospheric system of 02(\xe2\x80\x98A) have been made and interpreted in terms of O,(\xe2\x80\x98A) concentrations. Most of these are mesospheric and aurora1 studies. Only a few are\napplicable to the lower levels of the stratosphere. Two rocket measurements of the day airglow in the 1.27pm\nband with a rocket photometer are given in the table (Evans and Llewellyn, 1970). They are in essential agreement. Aircraft measurements (Noxon, 1968) and balloon measurements (Evans and Llewellyn, 1969) of the\nintegrated dayglow intensity are in agreement with these rocket measurements. Below 30 km new balloon ascent measurements would be required to obtain good estimates of O,(lA) concentrations. New measurement\ntechniques such as photoionization\nmass spectrometry could be applied. O,(\xe2\x80\x98A) is produced by ozone\nphotolysis and resonance phosphorescence, is quenched by molecular species, and is reasonably simple to\nmodel. A summary of the observed profiles is shown in figure 4-4.\n\nO,(b\xe2\x80\x99U\nAlthough there have been numerous measurements in the airglow and aurora of the atmospheric system of\nO,(b\xe2\x80\x99C+ - X3C;), there are few measurements applicable to the stratosphere. The results of the only relevant rocket measurement by Wallace and Hunten (1968) are shown in table 4-2. These have a large radiative\ntransfer correction; hence the concentrations of O,(b\xe2\x80\x99C) below 50 km are quite uncertain. Balloon ascent\nmeasurements would be required to obtain better estimates. The main production processes are O(lD)\ntransfer and resonance fluorescence. Due to self absorption in the atmosphere, the measurement of O,(b\xe2\x80\x99C)\nconcentrations at lower levels by optical techniques is difficult.\n\nI. -\n\nII II\n\nI I I\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n152\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n50 \xe2\x80\x985\nY\nw\n2\n\n45-\n\n!I\n5\na\n40\n\nA\n\n-\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n0.01\n\nI\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\n100\n\nMIXING\n\nRATIO\n\n(ppm)\n\nFigure 4-4.

(Evans and Llewellyn, 1970)\n\nAtomic Hydrogen\nAs noted in table 4-2, no observations of any kind are presently available for atomic hydrogen. Although a\nsensitive in situ analytical method exists for its detection, the predicted midday concentration ranges from 120\ncmJ in the lower stratosphere to - 1 x 16 cm3 in the upper stratosphere, the latter of which is approximately equivalent to the detection threshold of current methods.\n\nOH\nThe OH radical has been observed in the stratosphere by three techniques. A rocket-borne high resolution\n(0.06 nm), polarized scanning spectrophotometer was used to observe solar induced fluorescence (Anderson,\n1971a,b) at 309 nm from which the altitude distribution between 45 and 70 km was inferred by differentiation\nwith height of the vertical column emission rate. These results were extended downward to -28 km using a\nparachute drop, in situ resonance fluorescence technique (see Anderson, 1976, 1979). Burnett and Burnett\n(1979) report the results of several hundred observations of the total atmospheric column of OH at 4O\xe2\x80\x9dN using high resolution absorption spectroscopy with the Sun as the source. They have been able to study both the\ndiurnal and seasonal changes in total column abundance.\nIn the troposphere, Davis et al. (1976), Perner et al. (1976) and Wang et al. (1975) have measured the radical\nfrom aircraft and at ground level. Those measurements demonstrate that the total column concentration of\n\nRADICALS,\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\nAND IONS\n\n153\n\nOfi observed from the ground by Burnett and Burnett is unaffected by the tropospheric contribution and is\nthus dominated by the stratospheric and mesospheric distribution. As will be discussed in a later section of\nthis chapter the integrated column from the mean of the rocket and balloon in situ measurements above 30\nkm and the mean of the total column concentrations of OH observed from the ground both fall within the\nrange 4 - 9 x 1Ol3 cme2 and both exhibit variability in excess of the stated accuracy of the technique.\n\nIn Situ Appraisal\nFigure 4-5 displays the in situ observations of OH in terms of volume mixing ratio with the two late afternoon\nobservations (January 12, 1976, April 26, 1977) made at a solar zenith angle of 80\xe2\x80\x9d corrected to 41\xe2\x80\x99 for comparison with the observations of July 14, 1977 and September 20, 1977 and the midday model calculations\ndiscussed in Chapter 7. This requires an upward adjustment in those X = 80\xe2\x80\x99 profiles of a factor of two based\non the solar zenith angle dependence of OH determined by the diurnal models. Observed structure in the OH\nprofiles of a factor of two exceeds significantly the precision of the observations (+ 15%) as well as the accuracy of the measurement (+ 35%). For a discussion of experimental uncertainty see Anderson (1976). The\nappearance of local structure in the observed profiles, as in the case of the atomic oxygen data, is not an uncommon feature even with the somewhat limited vertical resolution ( f 2 km).\nNo in situ observations are available in the important\nour observational knowledge.\n~_.\n\n..OH\n\n42\n\nI\nMIXING\n\nII7\n\nregion below 25 km which represents a serious gap in\n\nI I\nRATIO\n\n41\n\no 12 JANUARY\nX=800\n\n1976\n\n40\n\nA 26\n\n1977\n\n39\n38\nz\n\n37-\n\n2\n\nl\n\nJULY\nx \xe2\x80\x98410\n20 SEPT.\nx.410\n\n34-\n\n2\n\n0 14\n\n35-\n\np\n\n(X2)\n\n36-\n\n2\n:\n\nAPRIL\n\n33323130-\n\nFigure 4-5.

Even so,\nthe limiting uncertainty is set by statistical noise which corresponds to - 2 x 1013 cmS2for a single one-hour\nmeasurement. By averaging, the Burnetts have presented a convincing argument that the uncertainty can be\nreduced to about 1 x 1013 cme2. They present their data in four seasonal means of the total vertical column as\na function of solar zenith angle. In the summer, when X < 40\xe2\x80\x9d, the data reveal a curious morning/afternoon\nasymmetry not seen at larger X. In only an hour or two, centered on noon, the abundance drops by about 30%\nas indicated in figure 4-6. This appears to be a real atmospheric phenomenon but is not understood as yet.\nThe derived OH column does depend upon the temperature assumed for the altitude at which the bulk of OH\nis located. Some of the variability observed in the OH column may therefore reflect changes in temperature.\n\n+\n\nx>40\xc2\xb0\nBURNETT\n\nX<40\xe2\x80\x9d\n-\n\nMODEL\n\n+\n\nI\n3.0\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n2.0\n\n1,O\n\nI\n\nI\n2,o\n\n3.0\n\nSEC X\nFigure 4-6.

Both the column measurements lend support to the correction of a factor of 2 in the in situ OH\nmeasurements obtained at X = 80\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSeasonal Variation\nThe Burnett measurements extend over several years and show there to be a small spring maximum and fall\nminimum. The departures from a mean diurnal curve fitting all measurements as a function of X show an excess of 15% in spring and a deficit less than this in the fall. Logan et al. (1978) indicate that [OH] is proportional to [H,0]1\xe2\x80\x992; the Burnett measurements thus suggest a rather small seasonal change in stratospheric\nwater vapor (at least above -40 km) near 40\xe2\x80\x9dN.\n\nHO2\n\nThree in situ, midlatitude, midday observations of HO, in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s stratosphere, using a chemical conversion - resonance fluorescence technique, are available (Anderson et al., 1979) which encompass the altitude\ninterval 27-39 km. The mean of the observed HO, volume mixing ratio (see table 4-2 and figure 4-7) at 37, 35,\n33, 31, and 29 km are respectively 4.7 x lo-to, 2.6 x lo-lo, 3.9 x lo-to, 2.1 x IO-to, and 1.1 x lo-lo with an\nexperimental uncertainty of -I 35%. Significant variability is observed among the three observations. Since\nHO, is rate limiting in the closure of the HO, catalytic cycles which recombine O,, the HO, observations provide a comparison between the rate of odd oxygen production by 0, photolysis and the rate of HO, catalyzed\ndestruction demonstrating that hydrogen-oxygen free radicals account directly for a fractional destruction of\n0, equal to 0.15, 0.10, 0.20, 0.13, and 0.10 respectively at 37, 35, 33, 31,nd 29 km given current formulations of stratospheric chemistry. A graphical comparison between 2 k2 [HO,] [O(3P)] and 2J,,[Oz] is shown\nin figure 4-8.\n\nH2O\n\nIn figure 4-9, the left-most shaded area is from Harries\xe2\x80\x99 1976 review and represents the rms limits to the mean\ncalculated in that paper from sources quoted therein. The right-most shaded area indicates the bounds of\nseveral post-1976 measurements which are currently available. Clearly, an increase with height is strongly indicated by this data set. Much of the data is just being submitted for publication. No value judgment other\nthan authors\xe2\x80\x99 own claims to good accuracy can be made at this stage. Some evidence (Kley et al., 1979) indicates that the vertical profile of H,O may change with season at the same site. Further, other results (Heidt\net al., private communication) may indicate that measurements at different latitudes show a dependence of\nprofile shape on latitude. It should also be noted that evidence for a maximum of - 8 ppmv was found at both\n30\xe2\x80\x9dN and 30\xe2\x80\x9ds by Farmer et al. (1979 and private communication) in measurements spaced one year apart using the same instrument.\n\nH202\n\nH202, hydrogen peroxide, is a moderately strong infrared absorber with a band in the 1250 cm-\xe2\x80\x99 region.\nSunset solar spectra covering this region were obtained during a balloon flight made October 27, 1979 by\nMurcray et al. (1979), at a resolution of 0.01 cm-t. Examination of these spectra fails to show any absorption\nthat can be attributed to H202. If H202 were present at a mixing ratio of 5 x lo-lo at 20 km, the absorptions\nwould be observable. Thus, an upper limit of this amount can be placed on this specie on the basis of these\ndata.\n\n156\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n393B-\n\nA\n\ng/20/77\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nx = 410\n\n8\n\nlW25/77\n\no\n\n1212177\n\nABOVE\n\net al.\n\nx=50\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n36-\n\nANDERSON\n\nx=450\n\n37-\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nAT 32ON LATITUDE\n\nT35-\n\nIiT\n: 34z 33\xe2\x80\x992 3231 Xl-\n\nx\n\nX = 50-75\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nB/W76\n\nOBSERVATION\nMIHELCIC\n\nAM\n\n53\xe2\x80\x9d LATITUDE\n\net al.\n\n29\n28\n27\n1\n\n261\nIO-\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n1\n\nI\n\n,I\xe2\x80\x98,,\n\nI\nlo-\xe2\x80\x980\nMIXING\n\nHO,\n\nI\n10-g\n\nRATIO\n\nFigure 4-7.

Although it is amenable to in situ atomic\nresonance fluorescence methods, the low densities expected imply a formidable experimental problem. The\nuncertainty in calculated values is principally due to calculations of the J-value for NO.\n\nNO\nIn situ and remote techniques to measure NO have included chemiluminescence,\n\nRidley et al. (1973) and\nRidley and Howlett (1974), atmospheric absorption of solar infrared radiation, Girard et al. (1973) and Toth\net al. (1973), and atmospheric infrared NO emission, Chaloner et al. (1975). Also employed have been spin\nflip laser photoacoustic detection, Pate1 et al. (1974), photoionization mass spectrometery, Aikin and Maier\n\n158\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n(1978), and NO gamma band resonance fluorescence, Anderson et al. (1978). A rocket-borne chemiluminescent detector for the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere measurements has been developed by Mason\nand Horvath (1976). The solar infrared radiation absorption technique has been used at 1876 cm-l in the R\nand Q branches of the 1-O fundamental, Toth et al. (1973). A detailed description of the technique is given by\nFarmer (1974). The absorption features are weak at this wavenumber. Uncertainties arise from inaccuracies in\nline strength parameters and difficulties in the process of deconvolution as well as the weak line strength.\nBecause of the long tangent path the technique emphasizes NO densities at 90\xe2\x80\x9d solar zenith angle when NO is\nbeing rapidly converted to NO, at sunset and created from NO, at sunrise. The method has also been\nemployed at 1890 to 1914 cm-\xe2\x80\x98, Fontanella et al. (1975).\nProblems associated with measurements at the terminator can be overcome by observing NO in emission\nrather than absorption. It provides useful diurnal information. Nitric oxide has been detected at 1876 cm-r\nusing a pressure modulated radiometer (Chaloner et al., 1975, 1978). Height profiles are obtained by scanning\nthe horizon. Deconvolution contributes to the uncertainty of this measurement. The addition of the pressure\nmodulated NO cell reduces uncertainty but careful laboratory calibration is still required. The measurement is\nalong an integrated path so that only averages over large areas are possible. A thorough discussion of the\nmethod and results appears in Drummond and Jarnot (1978).\nTo date, the majority of NO measurements have been obtained utilizing the chemiluminescent technique. In\nthis technique, NO is detected by observing the fluorescence of NO,* produced by the reaction of NO with\n0,. In a sense the method is non-specific, since other compounds also fluoresce after reaction with 0,.\nHowever, in the stratosphere, the abundance of such compounds is thought to be extremely low. Various instruments have been flown on balloons and rockets. The technique is potentially very precise but attention\nshould be directed towards problems in absolute calibration. Also, sampling problems are particularly\ntroublesome with balloon-borne instruments. Errors in past measurements have probably been less than a\nfactor of 1.8 (Ridley, private communication). The technique has been used to provide altitude profiles and to\nprovide diurnal behavior of NO.\nThe laser photoacoustic technique has been used to provide measurements of the diurnal variation of NO.\nHowever, because of the complexity of the technique, it has not been used extensively.\nPhotoionization mass spectrometers have been used to detect NO. The technique employs selective ionization\nof gases using a krypton lamp with lines at 123.6 nm and 116.5 nm and detection of the resulting ions. As with\nmost in situ techniques, uncertainties arise from the inlet system.\nIn the gamma-band method, NO is detected by observation of the y-band radiation from NO excited by a resonance lamp. In the experiment, a pod containing the lamp and detector is dropped by parachute. Sampling\nshould not be a problem with this method. Calibration uncertainties yield an accuracy of approximately\n+ 35%.\nFigure 4-10 illustrates data taken at northern midlatitudes and is representative of midlatitude fall mixing\nratios. There is considerable spread in the data with a factor of 5 or more variability in NO over most\naltitudes. Some of this variation must be attributed to experimental errors such as uncertainties in calibration\nand modeling of the deconvolution process. As noted above, earlier values measured by Ridley et al. (1974,\n1975) may have been too low due to sampling problems. Photoionization mass spectrometer data (Maier et\nal., 1978) from a flight in April 1977 exhibits a steep gradient below 35 km. The global distribution of nitric\noxide can be obtained from a pressure modulated radiometer on a satellite. Such an instrument is on\nNimbus-7 and data should be available soon. Intercomparison of satellite and in situ NO measurements has\nbeen accomplished using the instrument on Nimbus-7 and the chemiluminescent technique.\nThe only available data on latitudinal variations of NO come from aircraft carrying chemiluminescent detectors for measurements in the 18 to 21 km altitude region. In the 30\xe2\x80\x9d to 45\xe2\x80\x9d latitude zone summer values are\n\nRADICALS, RESERVOIRS, AND IONS\n\n55\n\nI\nn\nq\nA\nX\n0\n0\n\nI5c\n\n4:i-\n\n_\n\n+I+\nA\nA\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIllIll\n\nMAIER al. 1978\net\nHORVATH MASON\nand\n1976\nMASON HORVATH\nand\n1976\nRIOLEY\nIMMA N\n199::\n1976\nORUMMOND JARNOT\nand\n1978\nRIDLEY\n1975\nDRUMMOND\net al\nANDERSON\net al\nK\n\nI\n\nI\n\n159\n\nI\n\nIllIll\n\nI\n\nIIIII\n\nI3\n\nA\nA\n\nP\n\n1\n\nl\n\n.\n\nA\n\nI2 4(\n\nw\n5\nS-+ 3!\nl5\na\n3(\n\nI\n\nA\n\n-p7L*o\n4 I\n\nI14lII\n\nI\n\n1Q9\nNO\n\n10-a\nVOLUME\n\nMIXING\n\nI\n\nIIIII\n\nlo-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRATIO\n\nFigure 4-10.

Between the Equator and approximately 50\xe2\x80\x9dN, data obtained during\nsummer and fall exhibit only small changes, Loewenstein and Savage (1975). For latitudes greater than approximately 50\xe2\x80\x9dN there is an increase of nearly a factor of three (Loewenstein et al., 1978).\nFew studies of the diurnal variation of NO have been made. However, the rapid decrease at sunset and increase at sunrise has been observed (Patel, 1974, and Ridley et al., 1974). The general features of the diurnal\nvariation have also been seen (Ridley et al., 1977, and Burkhardt et al., 1975).\nTo date there has been no intercomparison of the various techniques reported. This remains a valid goal.\nHowever, there have been laboratory comparisons made of the photoionization\nand chemiluminescent\nmethods.\nNO2\n\nA limited number of altitude profiles of NO, have been measured using spectroscopic techniques in the near\nUV, IR and submillimeter regions. The altitude profiles obtained from balloons using long path length solar\nabsorption suffer from the inaccuracies and errors of the kind discussed briefly for NO. For these types of\nmeasurements, we note that the deconvolved data apply to a X of order 90\xe2\x80\x9d, which is typical of late afternoon\n\n160\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nNO, amounts. Below 26 km the NO, amounts measured are more typical of nighttime NO, densities, due to\nthe conversion of NO to NO,. In the visible spectrometric/photometric\ntechniques, which measure the absorption due to NO, in zenith sky light during the sunset or sunrise period, the deconvolution of the data is\nnot as straightforward as for absorption spectroscopy of direct sunlight. Accordingly, the information obtained is not as detailed; the method provides column abundances with errors - 20 to 30% and also the height\nf 3 to 6 km of the center of mass of the column. Emission measurements have been made in the submillimeter\nregion and in the 6.3pm region. The latter experiment utilized a pressure modulated radiometer. The inaccuracies specific to this technique have been discussed in the section for NO. The emission methods, however,\nenable the diurnal behavior of NO, to be mapped throughout the day. To date, the only in situ measurement\nof NO, has been made using cryogenic sampling with paramagnetic resonance detection. Details of the\nvarious measurement methods are listed in table 4-2.\nColumn amounts of NO, have been obtained from the ground and from aircraft platforms using both emission and absorption spectrometry. To date, the most extensive set of measurements of NO, have been made\nby measuring the absorption of NO, in zenith sky light (Noxon et al., 1979). As noted above, the method\nallows an estimate of the stratospheric columnar amount of NO, and its center of mass to be made. The most\nreadily apparent feature of the measurements is the variability of NO,. However, the number of\nmeasurements made is sufficiently extensive that certain latitudinal and seasonal features emerge. The\nlatitudinal behavior of columnar NO, suggested by these measurements is that lower amounts of NO,, by\nabout a factor of two, occur at equatorial regions, compared to midlatitude regions. Also, the center of mass\nof the column appears to be lower in the equatorial regions. The principal seasonal features inferred are (a)\naround 50\xe2\x80\x9d latitude in both\nthe summer maximum of NO, at midlatitudes and (b) the winter \xe2\x80\x9ccliff\xe2\x80\x9d\nhemispheres. The \xe2\x80\x9ccliff\xe2\x80\x9d is a steep decline of column NO, that occurs over a few degrees of latitude in winter\naround 50\xe2\x80\x9d when there is a strong polar vortex. The drop in sunset NO, may be as large as a factor of five or\nso. Another important feature of the Noxon et al. (1979) measurements is the diurnal behavior of NO, which\nis not in total agreement with earlier results (Brewer et al., 1974). Generally, more NO, is observed at evening\nthan at sunrise. In addition, using the Moon as a source, NO, is observed to increase after sunset and then\nsubsequently decrease. The detailed altitude profiles of Kerr and McElroy (1976) from balloons using direct\nsolar absorption measurements also show more NO, at sunset than at sunrise. Drummond and Jarnot (1978)\nhave discussed in considerable detail the day-night comparison obtained using a pressure modulated\nradiometer. A summary of the altitude profiles in the latitude range of 40-50\xe2\x80\x9dN is shown in figure 4-l 1. Given\nthe accuracy of the various techniques and the variability established by Noxon\xe2\x80\x99s more extensive column data\nset, the altitude profiles inferred from the measurements appear to be in reasonable accord.\nAn intercomparison problem may exist. The measurements of the groups using the near UV region of the\nspectrum and similar techniques, both spectroscopy and spectrophotometry (table 4-2), tend to measure NO,\namounts which are lower by up to a factor of two. It is not clear whether this is a serious quantitative problem\nthat needs to be resolved, or whether it is just indicative of a combination of inaccuracy and variability. In\nthis regard it should be noted that measurements of column NO, Mankin (1978) using IR and Noxon et al.\n(1979), using visible wavelengths above the same location and same day agree to within 20%.\nFor the NO, measurements a more extensive intercalibration\n\nof techniques is required.\n\nNO3\nNO, has been detected in the stratosphere using ground-based visible absorption spectroscopy and spectrophotometry with the Moon as a light source (table 4-2). Currently there is no latitudinal information. NOXon et al. (1978) and Noxon (private communication) have obtained some seasonal information on NO, column abundances above Fritz Peak (40\xe2\x80\x9dN). The amounts of NO, observed in March and April are - 1014cmM2\nbut by July the column amount of NO, is below the detection threshold of 0.4 x lOI cmm2.\n\nRADICALS, RESERVOIRS, AND IONS\n\n50-\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI 1\xe2\x80\x997 I R\n\n-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nw\n\nDRUMMONO JARNOT \\\nand\n1978\net\n45- _ o MURCRAY al. 1974\nX iltOX&Met al. 1975\n&iV ACKERMANal. 1974\net\n_---, HARRIES\n1978\n40-\n\n161\n\nI\n\nNIGHT\n\nDAY\nI\n\n-l--T\n\nI\n\nNO2\nIIIlll\n\nNIGHT\n\n25 -\n\n_m\n\n10-l\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIlllll\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIllIll\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIIIII\n\nlo-7\n\n10-Y\nNO 2 VOLUME\n\nI\n\nMIXING\n\nRAT!-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nFigure 4-11. Nitrogen dioxide mixing ratio profiles\n\nA problem arises in the determination of absolute amounts of NO, since there appears to be a factor of 1.3\nuncertainty in the absorption cross sections of NO,. Noxon et al. (1978) use the higher cross sections of\nGraham and Johnston (1978). Use of the Wayne et al. (1978) cross sections would yield NO, amounts higher\nthan those quoted.\nN205\n\nStratospheric N,O, has been searched for in emission in the 8. lprn region of the spectrum. Evans et al. (1978),\nusing a radiometer, have a tentative detection of N,O, a few hours after sunrise. They obtain 2 ppbv at 30 km.\nMurcray (1978 and private communication) has looked for N,O, on several occasions but has set upper limits\nof < 1.2 x 1015cme2 above 18 km before dawn in February 1979 in California and also Cold Lake, Alberta in\nFebruary 1978.\nNH3\n\nAmmonia has been measured in the troposphere by means of absorption features present in infrared solar\nspectra obtained from the ground (Murcray et al., 1978). Examination of infrared solar spectra obtained\nfrom balloon altitudes fails to show any absorptions due to NH,, corresponding to an upper limit of 0.2 ppb\nat 20 km.\n\n162\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nHNO,\nNitrous acid has a number of absorption bands in the infrared including one in the window between 1000 cm-l\nand 800 cm-l. This band is stronger than the 895 cm-l HNO, band and occurs in a region of little overlap with\nother absorbers. Emission spectra obtained at an altitude of 40 km looking down at 3.5O covering this spectral\nregion have been examined for any indication of emission by HNO, and no evidence of any such emission was\nfound. It is estimated that if HNO, were present in the atmosphere at a mixing ratio of lo-lo at 26 km, it\nwould be detectable in such spectra (Murcray, 1979).\n\nH0,N02\nThis compound has a strong absorption feature around 800 cm- l. Atmospheric emission spectra obtained at\n40 km looking at a depression angle of 3.5\xe2\x80\x9d have been examined for any indication of a feature which can be\nassigned to this molecule. No indication of such a feature is present. This yields the upper limit of 0.4 ppb as\ngiven in table 4-2 (Murcray, 1979).\n\nHNO,\nNitric acid profile and column measurements have been made by filter paper absorption (Lazrus and Gandrud, 1974b) by IR and submillimeter emission (Murcray et al., 1975a, Harries et al,, 1974, Evans et al.,\n1976c, 1978), and by infrared absorption (Fontanella et al., 1975). Since HNO, is a relatively long-lived\nspecies, dynamics play a significant role in its distribution, both with latitude and altitude. Thus, the altitude\nprofiles which have been presented in the literature show large variations which are associated with motion\nrather than any measurement error. The effect of transport must be taken into account in comparing experimental profile with model calculations. The effect of transport is illustrated by comparing a profile obtained at 33\xe2\x80\x9dN with one from 51\xe2\x80\x9dN as given in figure 4-12. The lowering in altitude of the peak of the mixing\nratio is believed to be the result of the lower tropopause present at the high latitude. This effect also accounts\nin part for the variation in column data with latitude observed by Murcray et al. (1975a) since the lowering of\nthe peak results in a greater column density. It should be pointed out, however, that this is not a totally\nsatisfactory explanation for these observations, since at the higher latitudes the aircraft penetrates the layer\nand this should result in a decrease in column density at the higher latitude which is not observed.\nSeasonal variability is not firmly established. However, the latitude survey data (Murcray et al., 1975a) appear to indicate lower HNO, amounts in summer than in winter, and Alaska profiles obtained in the fall seem\nto be higher than those obtained in the spring (figure 4-13).\nThe data obtained with the various techniques are in reasonable agreement. However, the filter data appear to\nbe consistently lower than the infrared techniques, and the reason for the disagreement should be determined.\n\nAtomic Chlorine\nTo date atomic chlorine has been measured only by in situ resonance fluorescence using its 2D,,2 - 2P,,2\ntransition at 118.9 nm (Anderson et al. 1977). The measurements were performed using apparatus mounted in\nan aerodynamically shaped pod lowered through the stratosphere at a controlled rate (- 40 to 100 m/s) by a\nstabilized parachute released from a balloon near 44 km. The atmospheric flow passes unrestricted through a\nhollow detection chamber in the pod which (a) isolates the detector from the photon beam which induces the\nfluorescence and from the stratospheric radiation environment and (b) contains the flow so that the controlled chemical conversion used for measurements can be carried out. The resonant photon beam which induces fluorescence in atomic chlorine is formed by collimating the output from a low pressure microwave\nplasma discharge of helium and molecular chlorine. Resonance fluorescence from the interacting chlorine is\ndetected by a cesium iodide cathode photomultiplier.\nA background count rate from the photomultiplier in\n\nRADICALS,\n40\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\nI\n\nAND IONS\n\nI\n\n163\n\nI\n\n35\n\n30\n\n15\n\n10\n\nFigure 4-12.

Results of these measurements are shown in table 4-2 and figure 4-14. A third measurement of atomic chlorine made on 2 October 1976 reported earlier (Anderson et al., 1977) is not included here\nbecause on that flight, an 0, absorption cell used as a filter in the measuring apparatus was subsequently\nfound (Anderson et al., 1979) to have stabilized at a pressure a factor of ten below its nominal design value.\nCl0\nStratospheric Cl0 has been measured by the same in situ resonance fluorescence techniques used for measuring Cl (Anderson et al., 1977, 1979) and remotely by laser heterodyne radiometry (Menzies, 1979) from a\nballoon. A tentative detection of stratospheric Cl0 has been obtained from aircraft-based microwave\nradiometry (Waters et al., 1979).\nFor the in situ resonance fluorescence measurements the atmospheric Cl0 is first converted to Cl by adding\nNO to the atmospheric flow prior to its entry into the detection chamber. Fluorescence from the resulting Cl is\nthen detected as described above for the atomic chlorine measurement. Ten balloon flights, in which the apparatus to measure Cl0 functioned as designed have been reported to date (Anderson et al., 1979 and private\ncommunication); all were from Palestine, Texas, and most occurred near local noon. Atomic chlorine was\nsimultaneously measured on flights on July 28, 1976 and December 8, 1976; certain of several other species\n(OH, O,, NO, HO,, 0) were measured on the other flights. The results for Cl0 are shown in table 4-2 and\nfigure 4-15.\nFor the laser heterodyne radiometer measurement of stratosphere CIO, a CO, laser local oscillator was used\nin a balloon-borne radiometer to observe the R(13/2)3 = 3/2 vibration-rotation\nline of 35C10 in the sunset\nabsorption spectrum. This measurement was also performed from Palestine, Texas, on 20 September 1978.\nAn absorption feature, most pronounced at an observation path having 33.8 km tangent height, was detected\nat a frequency within - 15 MHz of the laboratory value for the Cl0 line. The agreement between the observed\nand laboratory CIO line frequency is within the expected laboratory uncertainty and, after investigating\npotential absorption by other species, the observed absorption line was concluded to be due to ClO. The profile retrieved from the laser heterodyne radiometer measurement is given in table 4-2 and figure 4-15.\nStratospheric emission from three millimeter-wavelength\n35C10 rotational transitions has been searched for\nwith aircraft-based microwave radiometers by Waters et al. (1979). The J = 912 - 7/2 transition at 167 GHz\nwas searched for on five flights occurring between May 30 and June 15, 1977 and between latitudes 36\xe2\x80\x9d and\n53\xe2\x80\x9d ; the J = 1312 - 1 l/2 transition at 241 GHz on flights on 26 and 27 June 1977 between 41\xe2\x80\x99 and 54\xe2\x80\x9d N;\nand the J = 15/2 - 13/2 transition at 278 GHz on August 1, 1977 between 37\xe2\x80\x9d and 43\xe2\x80\x99 N. Data for all three\ntransitions were taken during midday. The millimeter-wavelength\ndata suggest the presence of Cl0 in the\nstratosphere but its detection by these techniques is not definitive. The most sensitive millimeter-wavelength\nresult was obtained from the 278 GHz observation (made over the Pacific, west of San Francisco). This result\nindicates that, at the time and place of the measurement, there was (a) more than ten times less stratospheric\nCl0 than measured two weeks later by the in situ resonance fluorescence technique from Palestine, Texas; (b)\nmore than two times less than measured on 20 September 1978 by the laser heterodyne radiometry technique;\nand (c) - 30% less than the mid-range of current model predictions (comparison with model predictions is\ndiscussed further in a later section). The stated uncertainty in the microwave radiometry results is - f 30%,\nwhich includes the effect of uncertainty in the stratospheric temperature profile.

The latter method is not specific to HCl but determines total acid chlorine in the atmospheric\nsample and thus should yield an upper bound to the HCl concentration values.\nFigure 4-16 illustrates the results. The spectroscopic results show an apparently high degree of consistency,\nbut it should be noted that conservative estimates of the uncertainties associated with them (including all\nsources of error) are f 30% at intermediate altitudes, increasing to f 50% at the extremes of the profile. The\ndata of Lazrus et al. fall well below the spectroscopic values above 25 km, the opposite of what would be expected if the two techniques were mutually consistent. Problems with uncertainty in the details of the CH,\nspectrum and the degree to which CH, lines contaminate the HCl features may have caused overestimation of\nthe HCl abundances in the case of the radiometer measurements (Eyre and Roscoe, 1977). Considerations of\nthe mechanisms involved in the formation and recyling of HCl, together with the known characteristics of\nother analogous species, suggest that HCl might be expected to exhibit a significant degree of variability in the\nvertical. No evidence for such variability has been seen in the rather limited data available to date, and this\nmay well be the result of the rather large-scale averaging characteristic of the optical methods. This should be\nborne in mind when making comparison between this suggested mean profile and model predictions.\n\n45\n\n1,\n40\n\nH\n0\n\nWilliams\n\nrt\n\nAckcrm~n\nt:yrc\n\nal.\n\nrt\nb\n\n(1976)\n\nal.\n\nRoscoc\n\nI//I\n\n2\nx\n-\n\ni\xe2\x80\x98.armcr\n\net\n\n.\n\nI,JZT"S\n\nb (;,,ndrud\n\n0\n\n35\n\n(1976)\n(1977)\n\nRill)c~-\n\net\n\n~1.(1976)\n\nal.\n\n(1977)\n\n(1977)\n\n30\n\n::\n2\nz\n::\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\nI\n\n10\n1\nlo-lo\nHCl\n\nFigure 4-16.\n\nMIXING\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIIIII\nRATIO\n\n10-g\n(v/V)\n\nIllustrated are hydrochloric acid mixing ratio profiles measured by\nIR absorption and trapping on base-impregnated filters.\n\nRADICALS,\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\nAND IONS\n\n167\n\n3N0,\niarly calculations of the possible perturbations of the ozone layer resulting from the use of fluorocarbons\nvere based on the assumption that HCl was the predominant sink for the chlorine. In 1976 Rowland et al.\n:uggested that GINO, might also be an important stratospheric sink. Model calculations based on the\navailable laboratory data confirmed a significant role for ClNO, in stratospheric chemistry. Recent revisions\nn some of the rates reduce the predicted amount of ClNO, expected to be present; however it still appears to\ngea significant sink.\nattempts to measure chlorine nitrate have been made using two techniques, infrared spectroscopy and basempregnated filters. Chlorine nitrate is a relatively strong infrared absorber with intense bands occurring in\nhe 780 cm-t and 1292 cm-t region (Graham et al., 1977). Murcray et al. (1977) examined infrared solar specra obtained during a balloon flight in 1975 covering the 780 cm-r region and estimated an upper limit for its\nnixing ratio of 2 ppbv at 30 km decreasing to 4 x 10-l 1 at 15 km. Data covering the 1292 cm-l region were obained during a balloon flight made March 4, 1977 (Murcray et al., 1978). Examination of the spectra obtain-d during the flight resulted in a tentative identification of GINO, in these spectra with a resulting mixing ratio\n$2 ppbv at 26 km. Spectra covering this region at much higher resolution were obtained during a balloon\ndght made October 27, 1978. The identification of the ClNO, is confirmed in these spectra and the results\n&e been used to determine the mixing ratio profile given in table 4-2.\n!I e results obtained by the infrared techniques differ considerably from those obtained by the base im$\n&gnated filter techniques (Lazrus et al., 1977). Lazrus has shown that these filters respond not only to HCl\nnut also to ClNO,. Thus, his measurements represent the sum of both HCI and ClNO,; however, when his\nesults are compared with the infrared data for HCl they indicate much less HCl than observed by the remote\n:ensing technique. This presents a problem in attempting to interpret his results in terms of GINO,. If one ac:epts his measurement as representing an upper limit for ClNO, there is serious disagreement between the\n::lNO, rsults. The uncertainty in the results obtained with both methods is large, but not large enough to\nwring the results into agreement.\nIOCI\n-.aboratory infrared spectra of the 3600 cm-l and 1240 cm-r bands of HOC1 have recently been recorded by\n<ams et al. (1979) and Wells et al. (1979). While this work provides accurate frequencies for the individual\nransitions in the two regions, knowledge of their intensities is rendered very uncertain by the difficulties\nIssociated with measurement of the quantity of absorber in the sample cell. The high resolution balloon specra of both Murcray et al. and Farmer et al. are potentially able to provide information on stratospheric\nIOCl; at the time of this writing no features due to HOC1 have been positively identified in the spectra, and\nhe current uncertainty in the line intensity values does not allow a reliable upper limit for this important\nGpeciesto be quoted. It is to be hoped that additional quantitative laboratory data will be made available in\nhe near future.\n\nGO,\n.ower stratospheric SO, data were reported by Jaeschke et al. (1976) using a method based on the\nrhemiluminescence effect which occurs during oxidation of sulfite with potassium permanganate in aqueous\nolution. The measured SO, mixing ratio profile appears to be remarkably constant with a mixing ratio of\n.bout .05 ppb, see figure 4-34.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n168\n\ncos\nCarbonyl sulfide (COS) was detected by Inn et al. (1979), and mixing ratio measurements are reported (see\ntable 4-2 and figure 4-35) for altitudes of 15.2 to 31.2 km. A large volume, cryogenic sampling system\nmounted on board a U-2 aircraft has been used for lower stratospheric measurements and a balloon platform\nfor measurement at 3 1.2 km. The gaseous sample was analyzed for sulfur compounds by gas chromatographflame photometric detection methods.\n\nco\nData on stratospheric CO are summarized in figure 4-17 and table 4-2. Two profiles obtained by infrared\nspectroscopy are included. The older measurement of Goldman et al. (1973) reaches only into the lower\nstratosphere. Recent data by Farmer et al. (1979) are the only valid data above 20 km. Cryogenic sampling\nand subsequent gas chromatograph analysis in the laboratory by Fabian et al. (1979a) are also given in the\ntable and figure. This technique is sensitive to CO production due to 0, interaction with hydrocarbons absorbed on the inner walls of the inlet line. It is felt that this effect is minimal below 20 km where the 0, concentration is reduced.\n\n6.\n\npp. 168 and 185.

This upper limit is based on\nan analysis of positive ion composition measurements. This conclusion is based on the failure to observe the\nion CH,OHi which is formed as the result of proton transfer between H,O+\n(H,O), and CH,OH, (Arnold\net al., 1977; Ferguson, 1978; Fehsenfeld et al., 1978).\nl\n\nH,CO\nThe moderately strong bands of H&O in the near infrared at 2700 cm-* lie in the range of balloon spectra recorded at midlatitudes (Farmer et al., 1979). Since laboratory spectra of these bands have been analyzed recently by Brown (1979) it is possible to search the high resolution stratospheric spectra for features of H,CO.\nThe spectral region is contaminated by lines of several of the more abundant stratospheric gases (principally\nCH, and 0, so that a very careful reconstruction of the spectrum is necessary before an unequivocal identification of H&O can be made. At the time of writing it can be stated, however, that if H,CO were present in\nthe stratosphere at altitudes in the 26 to 30 km region with a mixing ratio in excess of 5 x IO-lo (by volume) it\nwould be clearly visible in the spectra. It is expected that this value will be refined, or a positive identification\nmade, from further analysis of the higher resolution observational data being acquired currently.\n\nC2H29\n\nC2H6\n\nVertical profiles of acetylene and ethane have been obtained from analysis of mid and low latitude air samples\n(Cronn and Robinson, 1979). The values drop off precipitously in the first 3 km above the tropopause; low\nlatitude upper tropospheric values are appreciably less than for midlatitudes.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THEORETICAL MODELS\nAn important aspect of validation of numerical model representations of the physical and chemical processes\nbelieved to be occurring in the stratosphere is the comparison of computed values with data available from the\nmeasurements. In the following sections, the results of one-dimensional models (those used for the predictions in Chapter 7) are shown in the plots as a range of values, reflecting differences between models (e.g.\nglobal mean versus midlatitude average) plus uncertainties in some of the chemistry used in the calculations.\nResults for two- and three-dimensional models were unavailable at the time of the meeting.\n\nA comparison between model calculated distributions and the mean of the six in situ observations from figure\n4-l are shown in figure 4-18, indicating agreement well within the cited accuracy of the observations, f 30%.\nThe excellent agreement may be fortuitous because, with the exception of the data of December 2, 1977,\nozone was not simultaneously observed, and the calculations use model-generated ozone distributions that are\nmore appropriate for a climatological mean. A detailed comparison between atomic oxygen and ozone is\navailable for one simultaneous in situ observation, however, which is displayed in figure 4-19 comparing the\n[O(3P)]/[03] ratio observed on December 2, 1977 with the calculated ratio for the appropriate solar zenith\nangle by Logan et al. (1978). The [O(3P)]/[03] ratio is a particularly fundamental quantity and must be defined with significantly better precision than that indicated in figure 4-19 since O(3P) is the rate limiting odd\noxygen constituent in the major gas phase catalytic cycles throughout much of the stratosphere.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n170\n\n45\n\nPRESENT\n\nI\n\nI\nATOMIC\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nOXYGEN\n\nMEAN OF OBSERVATIONS\n25\n7\n2\n25\n17\n15\n\nNOVEMBER 1974\nFEBRUARY 1975\nDECEMBER 1977\nOCTOBER 1977\nNOVEMBER 1978\nJUNE\n1979\n\nI\n\naI\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\nVOLUME\n\n1\n\nI\n\n10-9\n\n10-10\n\n10-l\'\n\n1o-8\n\n1o-7\n\nMIXING\n\nRATIO\n\nFigure 4-18.

Also, a problem in comparing with these data is that\nthe variability of the structure for both species exceeds measurement precision, suggesting that the different\nair masses being measured have significantly different time histories. Concurrent measurements of various\nspecies (OH, HO,, O,, H,O, etc.) are desired in the future to study this variability. Studies of the HO,/OH\nratio and the (HO, + OH)/H,O ratio are also of particular importance.\nComparison of the total OH column as calculated by current 1-D models with the observations of Burnett et\nal. (1979) do not indicate any significant differences. However, seasonal and diurnal variation effects need\nfurther examination.\n\nTotal NO,\n\n/\n\nThe theoretical models are presently calculating up to approximately a factor of two or more NO, (NO +\nNO, + HNO,) than is being measured. See figure 4-22. It should be noted that in situ measurements of all\nthree species are not available with the same technique.\n\nIt appears that the cause for the large difference is due to the model predicting too much N,O in the\n\\pp stratosphere; N,O being the primary source for NO, in the stratosphere. The N,O content in the one, dimensional models used in this comparison results to a large extent from the choice of vertical transport\ni\n?i\xe2\x80\x99 coefficient, K,, used in the calculations. The transport coefficients used have been based on fitting the\n.,-I\ni\nmethane, CH,, and nitrous oxide, N,O, profiles plus the chlorofluoromethanes.\nCurrent models are capable\nof fitting the methane profile, but are not able to fit the N,O, CF,Cl,, and CFCl, profiles without adjusting\nthe transport used in the lower stratosphere. Doing this, however, would destroy agreement between the\nmodeled and observed CH, profile. In addition to the vertical transport, the distribution of methane is determined by the OH content. Thus, changing the transport coefficient would require that some mechanism be\nfound for reducing the OH concentration in the 20 to 30 km region of the stratosphere. At present, this is\nunresolved, and the one-dimensional models calculate too much total NO,.\n\nNO\nThe average of measurements shown in figure 4-23 is for midlatitudes near local noon. When compared to\nmodel calculated noon profiles, we find significant differences above 30 km with the maximum difference occurring in the upper stratosphere where NO is the dominant NO, species. The difference between models and\nobservations is probably not conclusive due to the large spread in the various measurements.\nNO2\n\nA comparison is shown in figure 4-24 between the model calculated range of distributions for NO, and that\nmeasured near sunset near the fall equinox at 40 to 50\xe2\x80\x9dN. The models correspond more to 30\xe2\x80\x9dN equinox conditions which leads to uncertainty regarding the differences found in the lower stratosphere.\n\nHNO,\nWhen compared to available data (figure 4-25), it is clear that current models predict too much HNO, in the\nstratosphere. This may be at least partially explained, especially at altitudes below 25 km, by the high total\nNO, being calculated by current models. However, this does not appear to be sufficient to explain the entire\ndifference above 25 km. Above 30 km, the difference may be due to an incorrect treatment of photolysis.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n172\n\n70,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nI\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98,\n\nOH MIXING\nSTRATOSPHERE:\n\nRATIO\nBALLOON -- SITU\nIN\nRESONANCE\nFLUORESCENCE\n\nMESOSPHERE:\n\nI\n\n/\n\nROCKET SOLAR\nINDUCED\nRESONANCE\nFLUORESCENCE\n~~\n\nCALCULATED\nRANGE\nALL MODELS\nHARPER\xe2\x80\x99S FERRY\nJUNE 1979\n\n-iE50=\n:\n2\n\n45-\n\n5\na\n40RANGE /tOHI\nIN SITU\nBURNETT\n\n35-\n\ndz\n\n4-9r10\xe2\x80\x993cm-2\n4-B x 10\xe2\x80\x993crn-2\n\nFigure 4-20.

Results are summarized graphically\nin figure 4-26.\n\nOne-dimensional models currently calculate an N,O, concentration of - 2.5 ppb near sunrise as compared to\nthe one measurement of 2 ppb found a few hours before sunrise by Evans et al. (1978). Until further\nmeasurements are made, the comparison is inconclusive.\n\nCl, Cl0\nFigure 4-27 compares model predictions and measurements of Cl and ClO. The model predictions shown apply to 32\xe2\x80\x9dN, where all reported measurements to date have been made, and midday equinox (fall or spring)\nsolar zenith angles. Variations of the predicted Cl and Cl0 profiles with season are small on the scale shown\nand very small compared to the range of measured profiles. The indicated range of calculated profiles encompasses the results of various groups and chemical models and is discussed further in Chapter 7.\nFor Cl0 the resonance fluorescence measurements, with the exception of the July 14, 1977 measurement, are\nwithin a factor of about 2 of the predicted Cl0 abundances near the mixing ratio profile peak. The September\nthrough December measurements show a significantly sharper decrease in Cl0 at altitudes below the mixing\nratio peak than is predicted. The July measurements give more Cl0 than the September through December\nmeasurements. The July 14, 1977 measurement gives 6 x more Cl0 than predicted near the mixing ratio peak,\nwhich exceeds the total chlorine mixing ratio believed to be present in the stratosphere. The laser heterodyne\nradiometer measurement also shows more than 2 x more Cl0 than predicted near the mixing ratio peak and\nsharper decrease in Cl0 at lower altitudes than is predicted; it also gives approximately 3 x more Cl0 than the\nresonance fluorescence measurements performed at the same time one year earlier. The millimeterwavelength results imply slightly less Cl0 than the mid range of model predictions and substantially less Cl0\nthan the July resonance fluorescence and the September 20, 1978 laser heterodyne results. A broader data\nbase is needed to explain the difference in these results, as well as the overall large (> 10x) variation in the\nCl0 profiles which is observed by resonance fluorescence but which is not predicted by models.\nBecause of the implication of the July 14, 1977 resonance fluorescence Cl0 measurement on our understanding of stratospheric chemistry, Anderson et al.

However, at present, speculations for explaining this range from the possibility of a missing\nchemical reaction or an incorrect rate constant in present theory to a possibility of its being an artifact of the\ntransport parameterization in current models.

(1979) and agrees to within measurement uncertainty with calculations. Figure 4-29 compares the\nmeasured and calculated Cl/Cl0 ratio. It is difficult at present to make any conclusions regarding this comparison because of the experimental uncertainties and the limited amount of data, however it does appear that\nmodels are not correctly predicting the slope of the ratio versus altitude.\n\nHCI\nExcept for a possible difference (as large as 30 to 40% when compared with the IR spectra data; much larger\nif compared to the better of the radiometer data) above 30 km there does not appear to be any large disagreement between the measured data and the theoretical calculations of HCl (see figure 4-30). Also, the uncertainty in the data in this range is such as to probably encompass the areas of disagreement.\n\n40-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cI.II\n\n.-.I\n\n%I\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c#.\n\nYL\n\nI\n\n..LLI.\n\nOBSERVED\nFor:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cLbLBLr-3,\n\nLV\n\n,-3I\n\n[CIO] /[M]\n\n28\n\nJULY\n\n1976\n\nx = 430\n\n8\n20\n25\n\nDECEMBER\nSEPTEMBER\nOCTOBER\n\n1976\n1977\n1977\n\n550\n410\n45\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2\n\nDECEMBER\n\n1977\n\n50\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n16\n\nNOVEMBER\nJUNE\nAUGUST\n\n1978\n1979\n1979\n\n50\xe2\x80\x9d\n24\xe2\x80\x9d\n430\n\n15\n7\n\nMEAN\nOF\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nRANGE\n\nOF CALCULATE\n\nCl0 PROFILES\n30\xc2\xb0N\nLATITUDE\n25 lO-\'O\n\nFigure 4-28.

This excellent agreement is obtained if the fast production\nrate for ClONO, is used in the calculations, whereas there is a factor of 2 difference if the slower production\nrate is used (see Chapter 1 discussion regarding the rate of production of ClONO,). Until further data are\navailable, it is difficult to make any conclusive statements regarding this specie. However, the limited amount\nof data available. do not indicate any gross discrepancies between theory and observations.\n\nTotal CIO,\nThere now exist a limited number of measurements for Cl, ClO, HCl, and ClONO, in the stratosphere. Except for three measurements of Cl0 taken in summer (Anderson, 1979; Menzies, 1979) there does not appear\nto be any large discrepancy in the total amount of ClO, predicted and that observed. However, the summer\nmeasurements of Cl0 are so large as to require much more total ClO, than capable of being produced by present estimates from known sources.\n\n-1\n\nI\n\nI\nC10N02\n\n5c\n\n0\n\n40\n\nElodcl\n\n(1979)\nCalculations\n\n-\n\n10\n\nMurcray\n\n\':":\n\nI\n\n10-12\n\n1 L -\'\n\nVOLUME\n\nMIXING\n\nI\n\n10-10\n\nI\n\n10-g\n\nRATIO\n\nFigure 4-31.

Farmer et al. (1977, 1979) obtained a profile covering the 20 to 40 km\nregion at 30\xe2\x80\x9d latitude; Zander et al. (1977) determined a total column abundance value above 28 km at northern midlatitudes; and Buijs (private communication) has obtained a vertical profile at 64\xe2\x80\x9d. In addition to\nthese, in situ sampling using the filter collection/wet chemistry method have been reported by Mroz et al.\n(1977). The combined data are shown in figure 4-32. Intercomparison of the results is made difficult by the\nfact that the available measurements are made under very different conditions. The Zander value refers to the\napparent volume mixing ratio obtained if the observed column total is assumed to be uniformly mixed. It provides a useful guide to the trend expected at altitudes above the highest reached by the other observers. The\ntwo infrared profiles (Farmer et al., Buijs et al.) diverge with increasing altitude, but this difference is reduced\nif the results are adjusted to take into account the approximately 5 km difference in the tropopause altitude at\nthe latitude of two sets of data. The in situ data of Mroz et al., on the other hand, while in agreement with the\nspectroscopic results (within the stated errors) over much of the common altitude range, nevertheless show a\nconsiderably different altitude gradient. This, again, may be related to the fact that the filter technique\nrecords total acidic fluoride in the samples collected, rather than HF specifically.\n\nHBr\nHydrogen bromide has been measured by Lazrus et al. (1979) using the acid filter technique. The data obtained by these investigators is given in table 4-2 and shown in figure 4-33.\n\nSulfur Constituents\nThe status of current model agreement, or disagreement, with atmospheric measurements of sulfur compounds is difficult to assess. Only one reliable measurement of SO, above the planetary boundary layer is\navailable (Jaeschke et al., 1976). For COS the situation is better; an initial stratospheric height profile has\nbeen measured by Inn et al. (1979), and numerous low-altitude observations have verified its ubiquitous\ntropospheric distribution (Maroulis et al., 1977). Regarding CS,, however, just one preliminary, highlyuncertain measurement exists at Harwell, England (Sandalls and Penkett, 1976). Nevertheless, Turco et al.\n(1979c) and Sze and Ko (1979b) have calculated SO,, COS, and CS, profiles (which are compared to data in\nfigures 4-34 and 4-35). Considering the meager data base, the agreement between theory and experiment\nseems reasonable.\nTurco et al. have, in addition, determined a global budget for COS which is consistent with COS observations\nand other geophysical data. One important source of COS may be CS,, through its decomposition by OH\n(Kurylo, 1978; Sze and Ko, 1979a; Turco et al., 1979c). In the atmosphere COS is destroyed primarily by reaction with OH below 25 km (Kurylo, 1978, Sze and Ko, 1979) and by ultraviolet photolysis above 25 km\n(Crutzen, 1976). SO, (some of which is formed by the decomposition of COS and CS,) reacts in air with OH\nto produce HSO,, whose fate is as yet undetermined but likely leads to the formation of H,SO,. Because\nhydroxyl radicals play a key role in the sulfur chemical cycle, that cycle is subject to a large degree of uncertainty.\nIn figure\nconsider\nphotolytic\n106/cm3\nclustered\n\n4-34, the difference in the SO, predictions above 25 km arises in part because Turco et al. (1979c)\nsulfur vapor to be recycled from evaporating aerosols above 30 km, initially as H,SO, and, after\ndecomposition, as SO,. Interestingly, their model predicts H,SO, concentrations greater than\nabove 30 km, which is consistent with the recent tentative identification\nof H,SO, molecules\nto stratospheric negative ions (Arnold and Henschen, 1978).\n\nRADICALS,\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\n181\n\nAND iONS\n\nFigure 4-32.

Although a complete list of molecules known to be of importance would be prohibitively long, a few species for which new or improved techniques must be developed include:\nl\n\nBromine compounds\nBr, BrO, Br02, OBrO, HOBr, etc.\n\nl\n\nChlorine compounds\nHOCl, ClONO,,\n\nClO,, OClO, ClO,\n\nl\n\nTotal chlorine\n\nl\n\nFluorine compounds\n\nl\n\nSulfur compounds\nHS, COS, SO,, CS,, SO,, etc.\n\nl\n\nHydrocarbon\n\noxidation fragments\n\nCH,O, CH,O,,\nl\n\nH&O,\n\nCHO, etc.\n\nTotal odd nitrogen\n\nEddy diffusion coefficients K, were derived principally from measurements of the upward diffusion of species\nsuch as N,O, CH, and the CFMs. It should be noted that such eddy diffusion coefficients may not be appropriate for downward diffusion of species such as O,, ClX and NO,. Measurements of ClX and NO, may\nprovide important information concerning the removal of molecules chemically produced in the stratosphere.\nCarefully selected simultaneous measurements are needed of related species such as NO,, OH, and HNOs; Cl,\nClO, OH, CH, and HCI; OH, HO,, H,O, 0,, and 0; ClO, HCl, and ClONO, to mention a few. These observations provide a much more stringent examination of mechanisms proposed for stratospheric photochemical\nmodels.\nAlthough further experimental evidence in the last two years has demonstrated that a clear pattern is present\nin fall-winter Cl0 concentrations, there remain cases showing significant departure from an envelope of\ntypical Cl0 profiles. Detection of chlorine monoxide by laser heterodyne solar absorption indicates concentrations well above the envelope. This is an important indicator that major mechanistic problems remain with\nrespect to the free radicals of chlorine. The steep gradient in the Cl0 mixing ratio observed below the peak at\n- 38 km also remains unexplained.\nThe diurnal behavior of the NO, system remains unexplained. The relationship between NO,, NO, and N,O,\nis poorly understood.\n\nIY-\n\n184\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nProblems Which Have Emerged\nAtmospheric Variability\nFluctuations in the chemical composition of the stratosphere have been observed over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Although some of this variability can be rationalized by examination of\nmeteorological records, it can be stated that, in general, characterization of the mechanisms and quantitative\nimportance of these phenomena are not well established. Atmospheric variability is emerging as an important\nproblem in the formulation and interpretation of field experiments. A summary follows of the measurements\nwhich establish large fluctuations for a variety of trace gases.\nKley et al. (1979) observed fine structure in the vertical profile of water, which appeared to be positively correlated with the fluctuations observed simultaneously for ozone. The correlation may be interpreted in terms\nof air parcels advected from various locations, since the stratification of water vapor in the stratosphere is\nmorphologically similar to that of ozone. This explanation has not been tested experimentally, however, and\nother explanations may be equally plausible.\nBurnett and Burnett (1979) observed short-term fluctuations of up to a factor of 2 in the total column OH.\nVariations of this magnitude are extremely difficult to understand. Short-term enhancements of OH near the\nmesopause could perhaps be caused by turbulent transports of H, 0, and O,, but there is little evidence to\nsupport the existence of such an effect on the total OH column.\nOne of the most celebrated fluctuations of atmospheric species has been discussed by Anderson et al. (1979).\nMeasurements showed on one occasion very large concentrations of Cl0 near 40 km. Rather large variations\noccur seasonally and within a single season. Explanations advanced for these variations (rocket launches,\nmeteoritic deposition) are not presently convincing.\nFluctuations of total column NO, (Noxon, 1977, 1979) have been reported, and the concentrations near 30\nkm of N,O, CH,, and CFMs show marked variability (Goldan et al., 1979; Ehhalt, 1978):\nIn order to characterize the concentration of a trace species in the atmosphere, measurements are required of\nthe mean concentrations throughout the atmosphere, as well as the short-term variance about the mean and\nthe distribution of that variance. Secular trends (seasonal, long-term) are also required. The initial efforts of\nfield programs naturally focus on determination of the mean concentration field. However, the apparent\nvariances of the observed concentrations are quite large. Understanding these fluctuations may be no less important than characterizations of the mean values. The problem is more challenging than the mean problem\nboth for experimental and for theoretical studies. At the present time, it is truly an emerging problem, with\npoorly-understood ramifications.\n\nOther Problems\nA major disparity exists between the observed sum of NO, = NO + NO, + HNO, and that currently used in\nthe models. This discrepancy depends upon the value used for the rate of dissociation of NO which has recently been examined (Frederick and Hudson, 1979a) and shown to be less than previously used. When account is\ntaken of this, about 2.5 ppb more NO, is used in the model than exists in the atmosphere with serious implica- ,\ntions for the 0, balance in the stratosphere.\nThe upper limit reported by Murcray for N,O, lies significantly below that predicted by current models, yet\nthe molecule remains undetected. The observed diurnal response of NO, (a decrease through the night following an initial increase and then a slow increase from dawn to midday resulting from N,O, photolysis) does not\nconsistently appear. There are also major unexplained latitude effects in NO, (the Noxon cliff).\n\nRADICALS,\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\nAND IONS\n\n185\n\nThe role of excited states of molecular oxygen and other energy pooling processes and the importance of ionmolecule processes in the rate of breaking and reforming the 0, bond must receive continued attention.\n\n6.\n\nPP. 168 and 185.

Examples of species are shown in\ntable 4-l under Group 9.\nTropospheric measurements indicate that ethane, C,H,, is a long-lived species which may enter the\nstratosphere in quantities as large as 1 ppb. Although this species has little effect as a loss process for chlorine\nit may influence the OH distribution. The chemical cycles involving the products of methane oxidation and\nthe destruction of low molecular weight hydrocarbons are not well understood and a survey should be taken\nof all species present in the stratosphere.\nThe influence of sulfur containing radicals on ozone is poorly understood. There exist almost no\nmeasurements of these species. Techniques must be developed to determine the distribution of constituents\nsuch as SO,. There remains considerable uncertainty on the total chlorine content of the stratosphere. Additional techniques to measure total chlorine and chlorine species will have to be developed.\n\nENERGJTIC FLUXES AND IONS\nIONIZING SOURCES\nOverview\nMiddle atmosphere ionization sources are important for a variety of reasons. For example, large variations in\nthe ionizing input may play a role in aerosol formation (Mohnen and Kiang, 1978) and a role in altering the\nconcentrations of minor neutral species (Crutzen et al., 1975; Thorne, 1977; Reagan et al., 1978). Variations\nin the ionization input can also modulate atmospheric electricity via the influence of conductivity variations\non the mapping of electric fields and current flow (Markson, 1978). Thus, for the middle atmosphere at all\ngeomagnetic latitudes, it is important to determine the relative importance of the ionization rates from the\nvarious background (quiet-time) energy sources; it is also important to evaluate the atmospheric response to\ntransient solar-geophysical phenomena. This topic has recently been reviewed by Rosenberg and Lanzerotti\n(1979); this section is largely from that review.\nOf particular interest for ionization of the middle atmosphere is the wavelength range from the ultraviolet\n(UV) through X-rays, electrons >O.Ol MeV and protons >0.3 MeV. Higher energy heavy nuclei associated\nwith galactic cosmic rays can also penetrate to the middle atmosphere.\n\n186\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nIonization of the middle atmosphere is controlled, to a degree strongly dependent on altitude and latitude, by\ndirect energy inputs in the form of galactic and solar cosmic rays, solar H Ly (Y(and solar UV and EUV radiation), non-flare and flare-associated solar X-rays, and magnetospheric electron precipitation with its\nassociated X-ray bremsstrahlung.\nTable 4-3 lists the energy sources that contribute to the ionization of the middle atmosphere, together with\nestimates of the incident energy fluxes. In the table the various sources have been separated according to\nwhether they contribute to the background (quiet-time) ionization levels, or are associated with specific\nevents. Event sources can have durations ranging from a few minutes, as in the case of solar flare X-rays, to\nseveral days as in the case of solar cosmic ray events or for the midlatitude precipitation of energetic electrons\nfollowing a geomagnetic storm (Spjeldvik and Thorne, 1975).\nFor the quiescent case, solar Ly-cr (121.6 nm) ionization of NO dominates between 70 and 85 km with small\ncontributions from cosmic radiation and 0.1 to 1.0 nm X-rays. Between 85 and 120 km, 1.0 - 10.0 nm\nX-radiation and Ly-0 (102.6 nm) are the dominant ionization sources. During solar flares 0.1 - 1.0 nm\nX-rays dominate the 50 to 90 km altitude region. Only galactic and solar cosmic rays and high energy solar\nX-rays and X-ray bremsstrahlung can contribute to the ionization of the stratosphere at altitudes below 30-40\nkm. Table 4-4 (Smith and Gottlieb, 1974) gives X-ray levels for various solar activities.\nGalactic cosmic rays represent a continuous ionization source which is a factor of two greater during sunspot\nminimum than sunspot maximum. Variation with geomagnetic latitude shows a factor of 10 more ionization\nat the poles than the Equator. Solar cosmic rays are sporadic and associated with major solar flares.\n\nMagnetospheric Electrons and Bremsstrahlung X-Rays\nObservations of trapped 100 keV electrons at altitudes of 250-400 km from measurements obtained on a\npolar-orbiting satellite (Seward, 1973; Paulikas, 1975) show their presence in the aurora1 zones as well as in\nregions of trapped fluxes extending to quite low latitudes, including the magnetic anomaly region in the South\nAtlantic.\nAt middle latitudes,\nboth nighttime and\nLarsen et al., 1976;\nwhich are observed\n\nelectron precipitation can be a significant ionization source for the lower ionosphere for\ndaytime conditions (Potemra and Zmuda, 1970; Potemra, 1973; Gough and Collin, 1973;\nand Spjeldvik and Thorne, 1975) and may be responsible for magnetic storm after-effects\non VLF communication signals.\n\nIn the aurora1 zones, considerably higher fluxes of precipitated energetic electrons are routinely encountered.\nHere ionization produced by substorm electrons will dominate the upper reaches of the middle atmosphere a\nlarge fraction of the time. Rates have been calculated by Berger et al. (1974) and Berger and Seltzer (1972).\nEven more intense electron precipitation with energies sufficiently high (2200 keV) to perturb daytime HF\nforward scatter radar of VLF propagation circuits is known to occur during some geomagnetic storms and\nsubstorms (Bailey, 1968; Bailey et al., 1970; Rosenberg et al., 1972; Larsen and Thomas, 1974; and Thorne\nand Larsen, 1976). Such events have been called relativistic electron precipitation (rep) and have yet to be\nthoroughly investigated.\nEnergy deposition by electrons or bremsstrahlung X-rays has been speculated as possibly influencing the\nmechanisms for cirrus cloud formation (Roberts and Olson, 1973a,b) and for thunderstorm generation\n(Markson, 1978). However, these energy sources have been rejected as an important agent for solar-weather\ncoupling on the basis of energy flux considerations (Johnson and Imhof, 1975; Willis, 1976).\n\n187\n\nRADICALS, RESERVOIRS, AND IONS\nTable 4-3\nIonization Sources for the Middle Atmosphere\n(Rosenberg and Lanzerotti, 1979)\n\nBACKGROUND ENERGY SOURCES\nSOURCE\n\nFLUX (ergs cm- -set-\xe2\x80\x99 )\n1o-3 - 1o-2\n\nGalactic Cosmic Rays\n\n4 x 1o-g\n\nCosmic x-rays: Diffuse, 0.1 - 1 nm\nSolar x-rays:\n\n10-s - 10-l\n\nNonflare, < 1 nm\n\n10-r - loo\n\nl-10nm\nSolar H Ly (Y: Direct\n\n6\n\nScattered (Nightside)\n\n6 x 10-j -6x 1O-2\n10-r - 100\n\nMagnetosphere Electrons: Aurora1 Zone\n\n10-4 - 1o-3\n\nMidlatitude\nEVENT SOURCES\nSolar Cosmic Rays\nSolar x-rays:\n\n1O-3- 10\xe2\x80\x99) 50 (g/2/72)\n<3\n\nFlare,< 1 nm\n\n< 3.5\n\nl-10nm\n\n4 x 1o-7\n\nCosmic x-rays: SC0 x-l, 0.1 - 1 nm\n\nloo - lo3\n\nMagnetosphere Electrons: Aurora1 Zone\n\n1o-3 - 10-2\n\nMidlatitude\n\nTable 44\nSolar Irradiance (erg cmm2\n-set-\xe2\x80\x98)\n\nWavelength\n\nQuiet Sun\nR - lo-40\n\nActive Sun\nR- 100\n\nSlowly Varying Sun\n\n3B Flare\n\n6.16 (-2)\n\n3.10\n\n0.2-l\n\n1.24 (-3)\n\n2.32 (-2)\n\nl-3.0\n\n1.02 (-1)\n\n3.04 (-1)\n\n1.37\n\n3.15 (-1)\n\n4.50 (-1)\n\n3.0-10-o\n\n2.31 (-1)\n\n27.8\n6.7\n\n188\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nSolar Cosmic Rays\nAlthough the Sun seems to be a more or less continuous emitter of low fluxes of MeV particles, these fluxes\nhave relatively little impact on the ionization of the middle atmosphere. In contrast, the discrete solar flare\nevents that produce large fluxes of > 10 MeV particles can dominate the ionization levels of the polar caps\nover the entire range of the middle atmosphere for several days at a time. The normal geographical distribution of polar cap radiowave absorption effects (pea) resulting from solar particle bombardment of the atmosphere cover the polar caps down to invariant latitudes of about 65\xe2\x80\x9d and 60\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe ionization rates during average pea events far exceed those from any other source at altitudes below 80-90\nkm and above 20-30 km. However, it is obviously difficult to typify the ionization situation during these solar\nparticle events. For example, the rates maximize at altitudes varying from 40 to 80 km, depending on the\nevent, indicating that the spectra of individual events can vary widely.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nThe sources of atmospheric ionization are well defined. However, there is great need to characterize the solar\ncycle variation as well as fluctuations on much shorter time scales. In the case of solar Lyman alpha and X-ray\nfluxes, this can be accomplished by continuous solar observations. Such observations should be carried out in\nconjunction with atmospheric observations. Inclusions of such measurements in the Upper Atmosphere\nResearch Satellite is one way to accomplish this. Electron precipitation is difficult to characterize since electron trapping in the terrestrial magnetic field leads to precipitation with a large range of electron fluxes,\nenergy spectra, and spatial distribution. Satellite measurements of X-ray bremsstrahlung fluxes at different\nenergies as well as ultraviolet and visible radiations can supply some of the needed information. Solar protons\nhave been measured from orbit and atmospheric ionization sucessfully inferred. Satellite measurements\nshould be supplemented with rocket and balloon campaigns until it is possible to infer ionization rates from\nsatellite data. This is most important for aurora1 electrons.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC IONS\nIn situ access to stratospheric ion measurements is very difficult, with balloons being the primary vehicle, and\nmeasurement techniques are not easy. Current information is thereby mainly based upon model calculations,\nwith only very few in situ experiments.\nBased upon laboratory and field measurement, we can derive a sketchy and preliminary picture of the nature\nof stratospheric ions. However, we cannot yet assess the importance of ions in the atmospheric chemistry of\nthat region. There exists the potential that ions do indeed influence some of the gaseous and particulate trace\nconstituents in the stratosphere.\nThe free electrons produced by the various ionizing sources discussed earlier in this chapter will, after thermalization, attach to neutral molecules. The positive and negative ions undergo a series of so-called ionmolecule reactions including charge transfer, attachment reactions, switching reactions, proton transfer reactions, clustering reactions, and recombination reactions. Furthermore, there can be ion annihilation reactions\nresulting in charged aerosol particles or ion-induced aerosol formation reactions that are generally described\nby a heteromolecular, heterogeneous nucleation theory.\nIon molecule reactions of the first five types have been compiled by D. L. Albritton (1978). With this information, reaction schemes can be designed for the stratosphere as was done, for example, by Mohnen (1971)\nfor positive and negative ions or, more recently, by Ferguson (1979). See Chapter 1. Vertical profiles can be\ncomputed as were shown in Reid (1979).\n\nRADICALS,\n\nRESERVOIRS,\n\n189\n\nAND IONS\n\nPositive Ions\nThe first in situ mass spectrometric measurements of stratospheric positive ions above 24 km were conducted\nby Arnold et al. (1977). They revealed the presence of proton hydrates of the form H,O+\n(H,O), as suggested from model calculations. However, the observed water cluster contained fewer water molecules than\nexpected on theoretical grounds as a result,of shock wave induced cluster fragmentation. Arnold et al. (1977)\ndetected some other ion species have masses 29 + 2, 42 f 2, 60 + 2 and 80 + 2.\nl\n\nLater balloon-borne mass spectrometer measurements at 33-37 km altitudes by Arnold et al. (1978) confirmed\ntheir earlier findings and are summarized below:\n\nTentative Identification\n\nMass (amu)\n55\n\nH,O+\n\nl\n\n(H20)2 = H+\n\nl\n\n(HzCQ3\n\n73 + 1\n\nH,O+\n\nl\n\n(H20)s = H+\n\nl\n\n(H20)4\n\n78 + 1\n\nH+ .

The overall abundance of these unknown ion species\nwas determined to be 0.43 at 37 km.\n(H,O), at stratospheric levels. Arijs et al.\nOther groups have, to some extent, confirmed the existence of H+\n(1978) observed at 35 km altitude the following proton hydrates and their abundances:\nl\n\n37 f 2\n\n1Vo\n\n55 f 2\n\n16%\n\n73 -t 2\n\n80%\n\n91 1- 2\n\n3%\n\nThey also observed some of the unknown ion species detected by Arnold et al. having masses of 78 + 2,96 +\n2 and 99 f 2 (Arijs et al. upper mass detection limit is 109 amu). In addition, they detected masses 47 -I 3, 50\n+ 3 and 60 f 2. There have been several attempts to identify the unknown ion species. Obviously, they must\nevolve from H + (HzO), via any one of the principal ion-molecule reaction mechanisms listed above, the\nmost likely one being a proton transfer reaction. Ferguson (1978) has speculated that the unknown molecular\nspecie N, might be NaOH or KOH, both of which have higher proton affinities than water. For example:\nl\n\n77\n\nH+\n\n99\n\nH+\n\n139\n\nH+\n\n(Hz0)2\n\nl\n\nN, = H+\n\nl\n\n(H20)\n\nl\n\nb12 = H+\n\nl\n\nH,O\n\nl\n\n(NaOH),\n\nl\n\n(H20)\n\nl\n\nN, = H+\n\nl\n\nH,O\n\nl\n\n(NaOH)3\n\nl\n\n(H20)2\n\nl\n\nl\n\nNaOH\n\n190\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe presence of aerosol particles would, for all practical purposes, exclude the existence of free molecular\nNaOH at concentration levels high enough to encounter collisional interactions with ions. One can therefore\nconclude that the above type of ion does not exist at levels below 25 km. With regard to the measured H+\n(H20),., cluster distribution at around 35 km as reported by Arnold et al. and Arijs et al., they agree\nreasonably well with the abundance calculated by Mohnen (1971) and Fehsenfeld et al. (1976) in that H+\n(H20)4 is by far the most abundant cluster at that altitude. Since there are no in situ mass spectrometric observations available to date below 25 km, one must fall back on model predictions: It can be assumed with some\ndegree of certainty that for all stratospheric levels, the intermediate ion will be of the form\nl\n\nl\n\nH,O+\n\nl\n\n(H20),.,-t or H+ . (HzO),\n\nwhich is the same. Through collisional interaction during the lifetime of the ion with neutral stratospheric\nconstituents, further transformation might occur, leading to mixed ion clusters of the general type\nH+*(H20)n+m*T[Ni],\n\n(X=\n\n1,2,...ofspecieNi)\n\nvia proton transfer reactions or any other \xe2\x80\x9cion growth\xe2\x80\x9d reaction mechanism. The ion lifetime is governed by\nthe recombination coefficient or the annihilation coefficient. At stratospheric levels, the ion annihilation\ncoefficient is normally smaller than the recombination coefficient (Zikmunda and Mohnen, 1972). The latter\nhas been determined as\n\n1.4 x 10m6\ncm3 s-l for troposphere, Nolan (1943)\n1 x lO-\xe2\x80\x98j cm3 s-l at 15 km, Gringel et al. (1978)\n4.5 x 10m7\ncm3 s-l at 25 km, Gringel et al. (1978)\n3.5 x 10m7\ncm3 s-l at 30 km, Gringel et al. (1978)\n\nFor the observed ion concentrations of 1000 to 10,000 cm3 in the stratosphere, these coefficients yield ion\nlifetimes on the order of 1000 seconds (Mohnen, 1975).\n\nThere is indirect proof that the average reduced stratospheric ion mobility below 30 km is of the order of 1.3\ncm2 v-l s-l. (Riekert, 1971; Morita et al., 1971.) As reported by Young et al. (1970), the mobility of H + .\n(H20)4 was measured as 2 cm2 v-* s-l. A value of 1.85 cm2 v-t s-l was reported by Huertas (1972). Mobility\nvalues of 1.3 cm2 v-l s-* would correspond to ion masses of roughly 350 amu, or far in excess of the proton\nhydrates predicted at stratospheric altitudes. The sulfuric acid molecule is a prime candidate for ion molecule\ninteractions leading to \xe2\x80\x9cprenucleation clusters\xe2\x80\x9d (Castleman, 1975). An attempt to predict the ion cluster of\n(H,SO,), under stratospheric conditions has been made by Chan et al. (1978). Using a\nthe type H+ (H20),\nmodified Thomson theory, it can be shown that preferred or \xe2\x80\x9coptimal\xe2\x80\x9d\ncluster combinations exist between\nH,O and H,SO,. The real nature of ions can be expected to be more complex in that nitrogen, carbon dioxide, nitric acid, oxides of nitrogen, etc., continuously attach and detach to the more stable \xe2\x80\x9cion core.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, one type of molecule, the chlorofluorocarbons\nFC-11, FC-12, FC-13, etc., do not seem to participate in any of these ion molecule reactions (Fehsenfeld et al., 1976) or clustering reactions (Kadlecek et al.,\n1977). Obviously as the temperature reaches extremely low values as it does around the mesopause, cluster\nformation involving N2 and CO, in addition to water vapor become more likely. Arnold has experimentally\nconfirmed this possibility from a measurement at the summer polar mesopause (Arnold and Joos, 1979).\nl\n\nl\n\n191\n\nRADICALS, RESERVOIRS, AND IONS\n\nNegative Ions\nThe first and only negative ion measurements from stratospheric levels of 34-37 km have been reported by Arnold and Henschen (1978). They reported the major ion masses with fractional abundance greater than 1% as\nfollows:\n\nMass numbers and tentative identifications of\nmajor negative ions observedat 33-37km altitude\nMass\n\nTentative identification\n\n125 + 2\n\nNO,\n\n161 + 2\n\nR- HNO,\n\nHNO,\n\nNO,\n\nHNO, HCl\n\n188 + 2\n197 f 3\n\nNO, (HNO,),\nR-*HR\n\n224 + 3\n\nR- WNO,),\nNO, (HNO,),\n\n253 + 3\n260 f 3\n\nNO, WNO,),\nR- HR HNO,\n\n289 f 3\n\nR- WNO,),\nNO, (HNO,),\n\nHCl\n\nHCI\n\nR- U-W,\n\n295 f 3\n\nThere are obviously two ion sequences, NO,\n(HNO,),\n(HCl), with n = 1,2,3 and m = O,l, and R(HNO,), with HR having a mass of 98 f 2 amu and with m = n 5 3. Arnold and Henschen have\nproposed H,SO, as a possible candidate for mass 98 + 2.\nl\n\nU-W,\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nThe major core ion NOT is predicted to be of importance in the stratosphere and its evolution is relatively\nwell understood (Mohnen, 1971; Fehsenfeld et al., 1975). The complex cluster ion at upper stratospheric\nlevels is expected to be of the form:\nNO,\nHere,\n\ndNi)x\n\n=\n\nWNO3),,2,3\n\nl\n\nl\n\n(H20)k\n\nl\n\na(Ni), with\n\n= 1,2. . . of specie Ni\n\nx\n\nG-W,,,\n\nThe absence of any water clusters in Arnold and Henschen\xe2\x80\x99s (1978) tentative ion identification scheme comes\nas a surprise. As Fehsenfeld and Ferguson (1974) indicated, their tests showed that weakly bound cluster ions\ncould be detectably broken up with draw-in potentials in the mass spectrometer in excess of 1 volt. On the\nbasis of heteromolecular, heterogeneous nucleation theory, one would expect some water molecules attached\nto these large prenucleation ion clusters. From a nucleation point of view, the following additional ion identification would be conceivable,\nNO,\n\nl\n\nW2O)k\n\nl\n\na(Ni)x\n\n=\n\nNO;*\n\n(H+)k\n\nl\n\n(H,SO,),\n\n. (HNO,),\n\n.

However, the key issue for the existence of prenucleation ion clusters\nis the presence of water molecules in these ions.\nThere exist no in situ measurements for other stratospheric levels. Again, one must resort to model predictions. As the concentration of HNO,, H,SO,, HCl, O,, NxO,, etc., decreases in the stratosphere with\ndecreasing altitude and H20 increases, one might expect other core ions appearing besides NO,. For example, CO,, 07, CO, and 0, ion cores are conceivable.\nComplex ion clusters are certain to appear with trace gas molecules constantly attached and detached to these\ncore ions as a result of collisional interactions with the gaseous environment, whereby the degree of clustering\nis determined by the physical and chemical properties of the neutral gas molecules and the ambient\ntemperature.\n\nIon Recombination\nThe general assumption in ion chemistry has been that positive and negative ions will charge, neutralize and\ndecay into neutral fragments. it is conceivable that the recombination reaction between stratospheric ions of\nthe general type\nH+\n\nl (H20),.;\n\n[Nilx\n\n+\n\nNO,\n\nl\n\n(H,O),\n\nl\n\nT\n\n[Mjly\n\n[Ni and Mj being stratospheric trace gas constituents with concentration greater than around lo5\nmolecules cmJ and x, y the number of molecules clustered to the ion, x, y = 1,2,...]\ndoes not yield charge neutralization for x, y L 1 and m, n L 1. Rather, these postulated recombination reactions lead to metastable \xe2\x80\x9ccharged\xe2\x80\x9d condensation embryos (Mohnen, 1971). Experimental proof for the existence of metastable or stable states is unavailable currently. However, other investigators (i.e., Ferguson,\n1978, private communication) are calling attention to the possible existence of large molecular products of\nion-ion recombination containing ions of both signs. The presence of metastable and stable clusters does have\nimportant implications on initiating aerosol formation, particularly if McMurry\xe2\x80\x99s (1977) and Gelbard and\nSeinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s (1979) mechanisms of aerosol formation based on cluster-cluster interactions proves to be dominant.\n\nSummary\nThere seems to exist a basic understanding of stratospheric ion chemistry based upon extensive laboratory\ndata, so that the observed positive and negative ion spectra can be interpreted. Current instrumentation for\n\nRADICALS, RESERVOIRS, AND IONS\n\n193\n\nprobing the stratosphere needs to be refined to minimize mass uncertainties, to extend the mass range\nsubstantially, to sample the ambient ion population at near thermal energy, and to cover, eventually, all\nstratospheric levels. Clustered protonated hydrates, as expected, are a significant part of the stratospheric\npositive ion population, while the NO, core ion seems to dominate the negative ion population. The type and\ndegree of clustering depends on the collisional interaction of ions with their neutral environment. This conceivably allows appropriate trace constituents of concentration down to lo5 molecules cm-s to play a significant role in determining the ion nature, and at the same time renders models into diagnostic rather than\npredictive tools. The existence of large metastable or stable clusters, neutral or charged, still awaits in situ\nverification. The role of H,SO, in positive and negative ion chemistry needs further investigation.\n\nATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS OF IONIZING SOURCES\nProduction of NO and HO,\nAtmospheric ionization events can modify the concentration of neutral species in the stratosphere and\nmesosphere. In particular ozone is destroyed. because of the production of significant quantities of odd\nnitrogen and hydrogen compounds which react photochemically to destroy ozone.\nIt was first suggested by Dalgarno (1967) that ionization could lead to modification of the neutral upper atmosphere. Maeda and Aikin (1968) suggested that mesospheric ozone would be modified by production of\natomic oxygen during aurora1 events. Ionization by cosmic radiation and the subsequent ion neutral reactions\nwhich lead to the formation of NO was proposed by Warneck (1972), Brasseur and Nicolet (1973) and in more\ndetail by Nicolet (1975a). The production of NO during solar flare proton events has been discussed by\nCrutzen et al. (1975), Frederick (1976), Reagan (1977), and Reid et al. (1978).\nOdd nitrogen is produced by several processes following the creation of the primary ion pair. The quantity of\nNO generated per ion pair has been estimated. Nicolet (1975a) used 1 NO per ion pair, Crutzen et al. (1975)\nadopted 1.5 NO molecules per ion pair for the August 4, 1972 polar cap absorption (pea) event. Frederick\n(1976) assumes 1.27 NO per ion pair. This figure is in agreement with calculated values by Porter et al. (1976).\nMost recently Fabian et al. (1979b) have adopted a value of 2-2.5 NO molecules per ion pair based on experimental measurements of NO produced during an aurora and their two-dimensional model fit to the\nAugust 4, 1972 pea observations. The same ozone data has been fitted with a value of 1.5 molecules/ion pair\nby Reagan et al. (1978) using a time-dependent photochemical model. Jackman et al. (1979) estimate the upper limit as 2.68 NO/ion pair for 10 KeV electrons. This estimate includes the effect of NT which is lost in the\nstratosphere by charge exchange to form 0, + . When the contribution from Nl is omitted the upper limit for\nthe stratosphere is 1.5.\nIonization can lead to odd hydrogen through several processes involving water cluster ions. The net production of OH and H depends on the species of negative ion present. It is usually assumed that each ion pair leads\nto the production of 2 odd hydrogens, Swider and Keneshea (1973). Odd hydrogen influences the 0, distribution primarily above 50 km; below 50 km odd nitrogen is more important.\n\nEffects on 0, and NO Densities\nThe decrease in ozone following the August 4, 1972 solar flare (the largest such event in 25 years) was observed by the Nimbus-4 BUV instrument, Heath et al. (1977). Data for both hemispheres is illustrated in figure\n4-36 which plots total ozone above 4 mb as a function of time. The winter hemisphere is normally disturbed\nby planetary wave propagation. This masks to some extent the influence of proton precipitation. Thus, while\nozone recovers within 20 days in the summer hemisphere, the winter hemisphere still exhibits ozone depletion\nafter more than one month.\n\nI .-\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n194\n\n1 I\n.\n\nI\n\n70%\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n(\xe2\x80\x98WINTEA)\n\n.OlO[, , , , , , I \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d , ;y,\n180\ni, .,!lI~\'/)l,i ,,,\n,,, ,/\n180\n\n190\n\nI:, (,,,, , ,, \' ,,,- ,.(!\n,:\n200\n\n210\nDAY NO.\n\nI(,,\n,,,,,,,,(,\n220\n(1972)\n\n230\n\n240\n\n190\n\n200\n\n210\nDAY NO.\n\n220\n(1972)\n\nI,ILuIl\n250\n\nFigure 4-36.

Part A shows ozone measurements for\nthe November 2, 1969 event by Weeks et al. (1972) and computations by Swider et al. (1978). Part B shows\ndata for the August 4, 1972 event with computations by Reagan et al. (1978) using a time dependent model,\nbut not including eddy diffusion. In Part C, the ozone data for the 1972 event is compared to computations\nby Fabian et al. (1979b) and by Crutzen et al. (1975), each of which used two different values for the NO production rate. None of the four computations fit the data as well as desired, due both to the paucity of data\nand to our incomplete understanding of the odd nitrogen and odd hydrogen interactions involved. A better\nunderstanding of neutral species changes occurring in the ionization of air is required, together with more accurate measurements of 0, and other species during a pea. Simultaneous measurement of NO, O,, and OH\nshould be attempted.\nOther ionizing sources are also important to the middle atmosphere. In the sunlit atmosphere the production\nof nitric oxide by cosmic radiation dominates NO production by the reaction of O(lD) with N,O only below\n20 km. Solar flares are characterized by large enhancements in hard X-radiation emitted from the flare region\nduring 10 to 15 minutes. This radiation source will affect ozone only above 50 km and the effect will be\nlimited due to the short duration of the X-ray pulse. Aikin and Maeda (1978) have presented evidence that\nsuch an effect occurs based on the Nimbus-4 BUV ozone data.\nEnergetic electrons are precipitated into the atmosphere largely in the aurora1 zone and can influence ozone,\nMaeda and Aikin (1968). The flux and energy spectrum are the determining factors in the altitude region\nwhere ozone changes occur. It is usually assumed that the energy spectrum does not contain enough high\nenergy electrons to create significant ionization below 65 km and that the accompanying bremsstrahlung must\naccount for any effect below that altitude. However, Imhof et al. (1977) have presented evidence for higher\nenergy electrons and discussed their implications for 0, depletion. Calculations of the influence of relativistic\nelectron bremsstrahlung throughout the stratosphere has been carried out by Thorne (1978). Simultaneous\nmeasurement of energetic electrons, X-radiation and ozone during an aurora1 event has been conducted by\nHilsenrath et al. (1978). A 25 percent decrease in 0, above 1 mb is reported. Observations during solar flares\nand electron precipitation events will be useful in studying the recovery phase of ozone depletion above 50\nkm.\n\nLightning\nAlthough the debate on the production of NO from lightning has been ongoing for many years, see for example Reiter and Reiter (1958), Ferguson and Libby (1971), it is only recently that it has been introduced into the\nproblem of the global troposphere NO budget and its relation to the stratosphere, Dubin (1975), Zipf and\nDubin (1976a,b), Noxon (1976), Griffing (1977), Chameides et al. (1977) and Chameides (1979). There is\ngreat uncertainty concerning formation efficiency for NO, NO,, HNO, and, N,O. Calculations as well as\nmeasurements during simulated and natural lightning have been used to estimate these efficiencies. Formation of NO, has been observed during a lightning storm and the estimated NO, production is lOi NO,\nmolecules per joule or 60 ev is required for 1 NO, molecule with lo9 joules per lightning stroke. Based on\nlaboratory measurements with a spark chamber Chameides et al. (1977) estimate 6 x 1016 NO molecules per\njoule. Using shock dissociation of air approximation, Chameides (1979) has calculated the NO molecule/\njoule yield dependence on input energy in joules/meter. He concludes that lightning accounts for a large fraction of tropospheric nitrogen oxides.\nThis conclusion is based on an energy dissipation of 105 joule meter- *. However, a recent survey of lightning\nenergy estimates by Hill (1979) concludes that an upper limit of only 104 joules meter-\xe2\x80\x99 is dissipated per\nstroke. This limits lightning odd nitrogen production to 10% of the value quoted by Chameides (1979). Recent satellite optical data, Turman (1978) indicates that power and distribution of lightning can be mapped\nglobally. If agreement is reached on the percentage of total power represented by optical power, such satellite\nexperiments can reduce the uncertainty in lightning odd nitrogen production estimates.\n\nI II IllIII\n\n196\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nC\n\nFigure 4-37, Comparisons of computed and actual ozone variations during the pea events of\nA) 2 November 1969, B and C) 4 August 1972.

A quantitative understanding is\nrequired if the influence of such events on stratospheric ozone is to be properly evaluated. There is uncertainty concerning the amount of odd nitrogen produced by proton impact on the atmosphere. The influence of\nphotochemistry and dynamics on recovery from such events is poorly understood. Better laboratory data on\nimportant parameters is required. Future measurements during polar cap absorption events should measure\nNO and its temporal variations as well as 0,.\nThe amount of ionization as a function of time and altitude is needed in order to quantify energetic electron\nprecipitation and solar flare X-ray events. The transient nature of these events can be used to evaluate\nrecovery of the mesosphere and upper stratosphere following such events. Neutral and ionized species\nmeasurements in addition to ozone should be carried out during such events.\nSince the global lightning distribution can be measured from orbit, Turman (1978), better estimates of global\nlightning production of odd nitrogen should be possible. Continued experiments and theoretical work on the\nefficiency for odd nitrogen production are required.\n\nCHAPTER\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n5\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the geophysical sciences in general, and in the study of the stratosphere in particular, application of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cscientific method\xe2\x80\x9d does not follow the same course as it does in the laboratory sciences. Carefully controlled\nlaboratory experiments cannot be formulated to test against theory. Instead, complementary observational\nand theoretical studies must be designed to achieve the goals of understanding the present workings of the\nstratosphere and ultimately of predicting with confidence its future states. In Chapter 2, the techniques for\ntheoretically modeling the stratosphere were presented. This chapter discusses how far past theoretical and\nobservational efforts have taken us toward understanding the workings of the stratosphere.\nThe first part of this chapter considers the role of stratospheric measurements with an indication of the advantages and shortcomings of various types of data in testing meteorological theories. Then various techniques are discussed for obtaining the geographical and temporal distributions of measured parameters from\nthe collection of discrete measurements that are taken at different locations and times.\nCurrent understanding of the stratospheric general circulation is discussed, emphasizing the physical processeswhich maintain the observed distribution of meteorological variables in the stratosphere. Since one parof\nticularly important stratospheric variable is ozone, a separate discussion is devoted to presenting the status\nour understanding of the physical processes that determine the observed distribution of ozone and to what extent present day models are able to simulate these processes. Since the stratosphere is not a static medium, the\nstatus of our understanding of the physical processes that lead to the long period oscillations in the\nstratosphere - the annual cycle, the quasi-biennial oscillation, and the semi-annual oscillation are discussed.\nIn addition to these rather regular variations, irregular changes occur in the form of both major and minor\nstratospheric warmings. The current understanding of these phenomena is discussed, along with that of short\nperiod phenomena such as tides, synoptic scale instabilities, gravity waves, and turbulence.\nThere is presently considerable controversy about the extent to which solar disturbances affect the structure\nof the stratosphere. It is important to establish this, since our ability to detect anthropogenically induced\nstratospheric change depends to some extent on our ability to identify naturally occurring variations, of which\nsolar disturbance effects are but one example. The observational and theoretical evidence for these effects is\nreviewed.\nFinally, the stratosphere cannot be considered in isolation from the atmospheric regions above and below.\nThus, a discussion is given of our present understanding of chemical exchange processes, dynamical coupling\nprocesses, radiative interactions, and electrical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. The goal\nof this chapter, then, is to indicate how far existing observational and theoretical efforts have progressed\ntoward the understanding of stratospheric processes and toward the ability to use this knowledge to predict\nfuture states of the stratosphere. In this connection, gaps in present knowledge are pointed out, and the\nnecessary research areas identified.\n\n199\n\n200\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS AND DATA ANALYSIS\nINTRODUCTION\nFor the past several decades, stratospheric data have been obtained from ground observing stations (including\nballoons and rockets). Although there are large quantities of temperature, pressure-height, wind, and ozone\ndata (the meteorological parameters to be discussed in this chapter), they are restricted mostly to land areas of\nthe Northern Hemisphere. Until recently, they have been the basis for the accepted climatology of the\nstratosphere. Spatial, seasonal, and short term variations of these,parameters were first described by balloon\nobservations in the lower stratosphere and by rockets in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. An initial\ndescription of the general circulation was then determined by a compilation of the various ground observations. However, this climatology has not been truly representative of global characteristics.\nSatellite observations of the upper atmosphere began nearly a decade ago. These early measurements were\nused to develop the remote sensing techniques for later global observations. During the past several years, an\nextensive effort has gone into verifying remotely sensed data so that they may be used to accurately derive\nglobal morphologies. Such verifications will be continued by comparison with the ground observing stations.\nThe series of Nimbus satellites is yielding a stratospheric data base of unprecedented size. Some of these data\nare discussed in this chapter.\nThe availability of large quantities of data has required new and sophisticated analysis schemes to be\ndeveloped. These schemes, which are briefly discussed in a following section, draw on traditional numerical\nanalysis techniques such as interpolation, harmonics, and adjustment to first guesses. With the availability of\nlarge quantities of satellite data, a 3-dimensional plus time presentation will be required.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS\nBackground\nThis section deals with currently active measurement programs which include those that are regularly performed from the ground (balloons, rockets and aircraft) and the on-going satellite programs such as the Nimbus and the NOAA operational satellites. Many individual specialized experiments are conducted worldwide\nfor limited time periods, and have significantly contributed to our knowledge of the stratosphere, but are not\nincluded herein because of the limitation of space in this report. A brief history, coverage and advantages of\neach of the measurement systems are reviewed. The accuracies of the temperatures measured from the\nballoon, rocket and satellite systems are discussed in this chapter, while accuracies of the ozone measurement\nare discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nGround Based Measurements of Temperature and Wind\nWhen considering the data distribution in the stratosphere, it is necessary to distinguish between the lower\nstratosphere, below about 30 km, and the upper stratosphere from 30 km to about 55 km. The lower region is\nmainly sampled by rawinsondes (balloonsondes or radiosondes for temperature and wind measurements),\nwhile data for the upper region has come from less numerous rocketsonde flights.\n\n11\n?METEOROLOGY\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n201\n\nFigure 5-l depicts the distribution of balloonsonde stations throughout the Northern Hemisphere as of July\n1978. This map indicates that the coverage over the land areas is rather extensive, but the coverage is achieved\nwith different instrument types. McInturff and Finger (1968) studied the problems posed by various instrument types and showed that the temperature measurements may require adjustments of up to 7 \xe2\x80\x9cC in order to\nform a consistent data set. In the Southern Hemisphere extensive areas exist with little or no coverage as can\nbe seen in figure 5-2, and satellite information is required to fill in the gaps. The distribution of pressure levels\nat which data are available has also been studied. Thomas and Finger (1974) have compiled, from worldwide\nradiosonde flights, the heights achieved and their sampled frequency. They show that only 45% of the observations reach 70 mb and less than 15% reach 10 mb. The main sources of radiosonde error are listed in the Air\nWeather Service Technical Report (1955). Seven sources of error, which contribute to a total standard deviation of +0.36\xe2\x80\x99%, are considered. A value two or three times this value is considered applicable for a\nradiosonde in flight.\nWith respect to the upper stratosphere, figure 5-3 depicts the current rocketsonde stations of the Northern\nHemisphere, and figure 5-4 those of the Eastern and Western Meridional Networks that extend into the\nSouthern Hemisphere. Currently, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 sites launch rocketsondes on a l-3 per week schedule\nwhile the other countries launch at a rate of approximately 1 per week. The height range of these instruments\nis between 20-65 km. As with the radiosonde information, the use of several instrument types necessitates a\ncomparison between types. Results of such comparisons (Finger et al., 1975) have shown that temperatures\nare generally within 5\xc2\xb0C (1 standard deviation) for the U.S., U.K., and French systems, but that significant\ndifferences above 50 km (over 20\xc2\xb0C in the average values and a 10\xc2\xb0C standard deviation) exist between the\ndata from the U.S. and U.S.S.R. systems. The rms wind differences, on the other hand, show a general increase with altitude, but are basically within about 20 m/s.\nWithin the United States, there have been at least 10 different types of temperature sensors used, all of which\nhave different errors. For a summary up to 1968, Quiroz (1970) and Hoxit and Henry (1972) give an extended\ndiscussion of sensors and accuracies. Since 1969 a common rocketsonde instrument type has been used at all\nU.S. sites, and a common adjustment scheme (Krumins and Lyons, 1972) that is considered reliable up to\nabout 60 km has been applied. Thus, a major source of difficulty in the analysis and interpretation of the data\nhas been alleviated. Naylor (1976) has shown that the temperature uncertainties below 50 km are on the order\nof 1.0-l .5 K, increasing to 3.6 K at 60 km. Performance of this instrument has been discussed by Miller and\nSchmidlin (1971) who indicate an overall repeatability to about ~t2 K (2~ ).\nIt should be noted that the measured.parameter of the rocketsonde is temperature as a function of height.\nPressure is determined by matching the rocket temperature sounding to a balloon sounding in the overlap\nregion, and calculating upward using the hydrostatic\xe2\x80\x9dequation. Densities are then determined from the equation of state. Errors in the pressure, then, are not independent of the errors in temperature.\nIn addition to the utilization of these data by the NOAA/National\nMeteorological Center in synoptic analyses\nfor temperature, height, and wind, the in situ soundings serve several other important purposes that are listed\nbelow:\nl\n\nAt the present time, the operational (NOAA) satellite temperature soundings are not independent of the\nin situ data. Satellite retrievals currently utilize a regression technique (Quiroz and Gelman, 1972; Smith\nand Woolf, 1976) and, in practice, it has been found necessary to update the regression coefficients on\nabout a monthly basis using in situ data. The accuracy of the satellite retrievals, then, is dependent on\nthe data acquired from the meteorological radiosonde-rocketsonde program.\n\n202\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nFigure 5-l.\n\nDistribution\nthe Northern\n\nf d\xe2\x80\x99\no ra losonde instrument types throughout\nHemisphere, as of July 1978.\n\n.\n.\xe2\x80\x9c.\n\n..\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n203\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n~~\nKEY\n+MESURAL\n\nAORAW\n\n0\n\nJAPANESE\n\n4 DIAMOND\n\n+\n\nU.K. KEW\n\nB MNDIX-fRIEZ\n\n-0 VAISALA\n\nq U.S.E.R.\n0\n\nHIMMAN\n\nV\n\nU.S.A.

Danielson (1968) and Reiter (1972), for example, present cases where the detailed\nradiosonde observations are critical for delineating the tropopause-folding that results in mass exchange\nbetween the troposphere and stratosphere. In a similar vein, Webb (1965) and Miller et al. (1968) have\nshown that the meteorological rocketsondes can delineate 1 km variations in the vertical which are important for consideration of gravity wave structure in the stratosphere. Figure 5-5 (Miller et al., 1968),\nfor example, shows the smoothed temperature and wind profiles and departure therefrom for several\nsoundings utilizing two different rocketsonde sensors during a U.S.-Japan intercomparison test. Clearly, the detailed structure as evidenced by the two systems is reproducible and is not an artifact of the\nmeasurement.\n\nIn the past few years, a new generation of sensitive radars utilizing the Doppler technique has been developed\nthat has the potential to provide routine observations of wind, turbulence, and stable atmospheric layers in\nthe troposphere and stratosphere via scattering from clear air irregularities in the radio refractive index. Gage\nand Balsley (1978) present a broad overview of the measurement capabilities of several Doppler radars\noperating over a range of frequencies in the VHF (30-300 MHz) and UHF (300-3000 MHz) regions. This study\npoints out that previous radar observations (non-Doppler) do not provide continuous backscatter from all\nheights in the troposphere. On the contrary, they only outline the strongest echoing regions, where the reflectivity exceeds the minimum detectable reflectivity for the particular radar being used.\nAddition of the Doppler capability significantly enhances radar sensitivity and increases the information content that can be retrieved from the radar echoes. Since the atmospheric scatterers are advected with the wind,\nthe echoes are Doppler shifted and easily separated from stationary ground clutter. Moreover, since the radial\ncomponent of the wind can be determined from the mean Doppler shift, the magnitude of the horizontal wind\ncomponent can also be deduced, with minor assumptions. Observations made at a sequence of heights at one\nazimuth and fixed elevation result in a vertical profile of the horizontal wind component at that azimuth\n(assuming negligible vertical velocity). Vertical profiles obtained in more than one direction (e.g., an orthogonal set or an azimuth scan) can be used to determine the horizontal wind vector as a function of height.\nSensitive radars can obtain such data in a few minutes to an hour depending on their processing capabilities\nand the altitude being probed.\nBecause of their ability to take data continuously over a period of several days, these radars have the potential\nto provide scientifically interesting data on gravity waves and on dissipative processes (turbulence). Additional comparisons with other independently obtained data are needed to fully evaluate their capabilities including the possibility that they be able to provide information on vertical transport. Parameters for a\nnumber of coherent pulsed radar systems involved in clear air studies are given in table 5-1.\n\nGround Based Measurements of Total Ozone and Its Vertical Distribution\nThe ground-based total ozone and vertical distribution techniques have been reviewed in NASA RP-1010 and\nare discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. One additional item to be noted, however, is that an international\ncomparison of ozone rocketsondes is planned for the fall of 1979 at Wallops Island, Virginia. The participants are to be the United States, Canada, India, Japan, and Australia.

A major strength of the ground-based systems is\nthat they can be calibrated and thus serve as standards for long-term satellite measurements.\nThe balloon-rocketsonde system provides information on the small-scale vertical structure essential to\ninvestigation of certain problems such as stratospheric-tropospheric mass exchange. An example of such\nexchange is presented by Kroening et al. (1968).\nBy measuring both ozone and horizontal wind, the balloon and rocketsondes can provide first approximations to the ozone transports (e.g., Hering, 1966; Hutchings and Farkas, 1971). These are limited by\nthe spatial extent of the observations, but at this time serve as the only source of long-term\nmeasurements.\n\nAircraft Measurements\nResearch aircraft have played a key role in furthering our understanding of the physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the stratosphere. Although aircraft measurements are taken only over a limited altitude\nrange, they provide detailed information on horizontal structure. High resolution data have provided important information on tropospheric-stratospheric\nexchange process as will be shown later in this chapter.\nSimultaneously measured meridional distributions of meteorological parameters and trace gases and\nsubstances near the tropopause have also yielded information on atmospheric constituent budgets and\ntransport in the lower stratosphere. Table 5-2 summarizes the various well-known aircraft programs.\n\nSatellite Characteristics\nThe nature of satellite coverage and observations strongly influences the types of problems for which these\ndata can be effectively used. It is worth noting some of these features here.\n. Satellites have the unique ability to obtain global measurements on a repeated basis with regular sampling in space and time. To date, most observations of the stratosphere have come from spacecraft in\nSun-synchronous polar orbits such as those of the Nimbus and TIROS series. For these orbits the\nlatitudinal sampling is controlled by instrument considerations, while the longitudinal spacing is determined by the distance the Earth rotates during one orbital period. Typically, these orbiters have periods\nof about 104-108 minutes, during which the rotation of the Earth (and therefore the separation between\nsub-satellite tracks) is 26\xe2\x80\x9d-27\xe2\x80\x9d, with coverage of the whole globe once each 24 hours for both day-side\nand night-side portions of the orbit. At any latitude, all orbits view about the same local time. Thus,\nsatellite coverage is very good for large-scale processes, and phenomena that do not change rapidly in\ntimes much less than a day.\nl\n\nl\n\nSince the same instrument is used at all locations, systematic errors will tend to be similar everywhere.\nThus, although absolute values may be in error, differences, and thus spatial or temporal gradients, may\nbe determined quite well. This is especially important for the calculation of geostrophic winds from\ntemperatures, calculation of transports, and determination of seasonal and longer term trends.\nSatellite observations have an ability to reach regions of the atmosphere which are difficult to observe\nby conventional measurements. Satellites are the major data source for all altitudes over the oceans and\nin the Southern Hemisphere, and above 30 km altitude over Northern Hemisphere land areas.\n\nReferences\n\nTemperature, ozone, nitric\noxide and other stratospheric\nspecies over ITCZ and meridional\nand latitudinal surveys\nWhole air samples, chlorinated\ncompounds particulates, radioactive debris, and tritium,\nlatitudinal surveys from\nequator to 75\xe2\x80\x99N three times\nper year\n\nu-2\n\nWB-57\n\nNASA-Ames\n\nDepartment\nof Energy\n\nMax Plank\nInstitute\nfor Aeronomy\nNSF, Georgia\nInst. of Tech.\n\nStratospheric Air\nSampling Program\n\nProject Airstream\n\nProject TROZ\n\nGAMETAG\n\nNCAR-Electra\n\nHydroxyl, aerosols, ozone,\nnitrogen compounds, in\ntroposphere\n\nIn situ ozone, meridional and\nseasonalvariability\n\nLoewenstein et al,\n1978\nNASA TM 78577,1979\n\nTemperature, ozone, carbon\nmonoxide, and CN along commercial air routes\n\nCommercial 747\n\nNASA-Lewis\n\nGlobal Atmospheric\nSampling Program\n\nCommercial 707\n\nPerkins et al, 1978\nFalconer and Holdeman,\n1976\n\nTemperature and ozone in the\nvicinity of active tropopause\n\nSabreliner\n\nNCAR\n\nStratospheric-Tropospheric\nExchange Project\n\nDavis, D.D. and others,\n1978\n\nFabian and Pruchniewicz,\n1977\n\nDepartment of Energy\nReports of the\nEnvironment Measurement Laboratory,\n1978, 1979\n\nShapiro, 1976, 1978\n\nMeasurements\n\nAircraft Type\n\nAgency\n\nAircraft Programs\n\nTable 5-2\nAircraft Programs\n\nN\n0\n\nI .--\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nl\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n211\n\nFinally, the use of satellite data in long-term trend detection requires that the data be routinely\nverified/calibrated\nagainst some standard. This is necessary to compensate for instrumental drift or\nchange in the atmospheric state that are not included in the data processing. For the current satellite\nsystem, this is probably best accomplished by comparing the satellite data with the ground-based data\ndiscussed previously.\n\nSatellite measurements, especially those from the Nimbus series, have greatly expanded the data on\ntemperature and ozone in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. Much of the temperature data has already\nbeen used for operational and research purposes. Other data, including the ozone data, are just beginning to\nbe available and many more constituents will be measured in the future.\n\nSatellite Measurements of Temperature\nSatellite temperature sounders have been used since 1969 (table 5-3). Until 1975, all measurements were made\nlooking downward, or nadir viewing. In this case, radiation received comes from a deep layer (Wark and\nFleming, 1966). Measurements of radiation upwelling from a uniformly mixed constituent such as carbon\ndioxide, in the 15pm band allow one to obtain the mean black body temperature over the thickness of this\nlayer, which is on the order of 12-20 km. The highest weighting functions for the early sounders such as SIRS\nand IRIS peaked at about 25 km. The later operational sounders, Infrared Temperature Profile Radiometer\n(ITPR) and Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR) were similar. Subsequently, the Selective\nChopper Radiometer (SCR) launched on Nimbus-4 (1970) and Nimbus-5 (1972) had weighting functions\npeaking up to 45 km, and the Pressure Modulated Radiometer (PMR) launched in 1975 on Nimbus-6 allowed\naltitudes up to 80 km to be observed.\nPresent operational sounders on TIROS N have characteristics similar to the VTPR and the SCR. Recent\nresults of studies utilizing a sample of 1200 simulated radiances from the three TIROS N sounding instruments and the regression techniques of Quiroz and Gelman (1972) shown in table 5-4, indicate the general\nlevel of precision that we might expect from this system. The temperature rms differences are on the order of\n2 \xe2\x80\x9cC up to about 10 mb, increase to about 4\xc2\xb0C at 1 mb and become about 6 \xe2\x80\x9cC at 0.4 mb.\nThe first atmospheric limb viewing instrument, the Limb Radiance Inversion Radiometer (LRIR) was also\nflown on Nimbus-6. By scanning across the limb, atmospheric emission is measured as a function of altitude,\nwhich allows vertical distribution of temperature (and trace constituents) to be determined. In addition,\ntemperature weighting functions are only 4 km thick, from the tropopause to about 65 km (Gille and House,\n1971). The narrow weighting functions and frequent samples (spaced 1.5 km apart vertically) allow higher\nvertical resolution and better depiction of atmospheric temperature structure than with downward viewing instruments. However, some horizontal resolution is lost since 50% of the energy (at 10 mb) received comes\nfrom a 300 km horizontal path. An additional disadvantage of the LIMS and LRIR is that the detector is actively cooled with an on-board cryogen which dissipates in orbit resulting in a 6-7 month lifetime. Table 5-5\npresents the mean differences between a sample of rocket and LRIR retrievals, and the repeatability of the\nLRIR results. The Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) similar to LRIR, and the Stratospheric\nand Mesospheric Sounder (SAMS) also a limb viewing instrument, were flown on Nimbus-7.\n\nSatellite Measurements of Ozone\nTotal Ozone\nSatellite remote sensing methods for determining total ozone are basically divided into two techniques, that\nusing backscattered UV sunlight (Dave and Mateer, 1967) and that using 9.6pm radiation emitted by the atmospheric ozone (Prabhakara et al., 1970).

These techniques were evaluated with the backscatter UV spectrometer\ninterferometer spectrometer (IRIS) sensors flown on Nimbus satellites, and they were\n&6 percent with simultaneous Dobson station data over a broad range of conditions\nPrabhakara, 1976; FIeig et al., 1978). This value includes station to station differences\n\n(BUV) and infound to agree\n(Mateer et al.,\nas well.\n\nWhile satellite systems offer more extensive spatial coverage than the ground-based systems, it is important to\nrecognize that certain caveats must be considered. The SBUV (Nimbus-7) and BUV (Nimbus-4) instruments\nare nadir viewing daylight sensors only, which means that for a typical polar orbit the data are about 27\xe2\x80\x9d in\nlongitude apart. A single instrument provides limited longitudinal resolution. Also, as a daylight sensor it\ndoes not obtain retrievable information in the wintertime polar night. The Total Ozone Mapping System\n(TOMS) on Nimbus-7 has a side-scanning capability that resolves the longitudinal spatial sampling problem,\nbut the winter polar limitation is still in effect.\nFor a 9.6pm instrument both day and night coverage is achieved, and when side-scanning capability is included, as in the NOAA HIRS-2 and the Air Force MFR instruments, the coverage is comparable to TOMS. The\nmajor difficulties with the infrared technique are that the total ozone retrievals must include a correction to\nthe observed radiances for cloud contamination, and in the winter polar regions additional errors arise due to\nthe lack of temperature contrast. The accuracies of satellite total ozone measurements are discussed in detail\nin Chapter 6.\n\nVertical Distribution of Ozone\nMethods for remote sounding of the vertical distribution (Singer and Wentworth, 1957) using backscattered\nUV radiation have been discussed by Mateer (1972). The ozone profiles inferred from measurements of the\nUV Earth radiance are valid from above the ozone concentration maximum (about 30 km) to approximately\n55 km, and have a vertical resolution of about 7 km. Instruments using the backscatter principle have been\nflown on satellites in several short-lived experiments (Iozenes et al., 1969; Rawcliffe and Elliot, 1966), while\nlonger lived experiments were flown on OGO-4 (London et al., 1977) and on Nimbus-4 (Heath et al., 1973).\nThe longest lived experiment to date has been the BUV on Nimbus-4, which was launched in April 1970 and\nproduced data until it was put in a standby mode in late 1977. The results, although of lower vertical resolution than direct rocket or balloon sounding data, agree, to about 10 percent, with simultaneous rocket\nmeasurements. The BUV was also flown on Atmospheric Explorer-E (AE-E), in a low inclination orbit (20\xe2\x80\x9d)\nin 1975 and initial results reported by Guenther et al. (1977). Results from preliminary analysis of Nimbus-4\nBUV profiles have been reported by Deluisi et al. (1979). An improved version of the BUV called the SBUV\nwas flown on Nimbus-7 and has an additional capability to measure the solar ultraviolet flux from 140pm to\n340pm. Additional comments concerning accuracies of ozone profile measurements appear in Chapter 6.\nGille et al. (1970), Russell and Drayson (1972), Gille et al. (1979), Bailey and Gille (1978) have discussed determination of the ozone profile from satellite measurements of limb emission in the 9.6pm band. The weighting\nfunctions are again of the order of 4 km wide, allowing high vertical resolution. Comparison of LRIR on\nNimbus-6 with 4 rocket soundings indicates agreement to within 1 ppmv and precision of 0.3 ppmv from\n30-60 km. (In percentage terms the agreement was within 5% from 30-60 km). Repeatability determined by a\nseries of measurements within four degrees of latitude (where atmospheric variations are small) was better\nthan 10% from 30 to 55 km. A similar instrument, LIMS, flew on Nimbus-7.\nThe Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) on Application Explorer Mission - B (AEM-B) was\nlaunched in early 1979. It is a four-channel grating spectrophotometer; three channels are for deducing the\nphysical properties of stratospheric aerosols, the fourth for deducing vertical distributions of ozone concentration. SAGE is a solar occultation experiment; i.e., it obtains its basic data by the absorption of solar radiation viewed through the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s limb.\nA summary of the history and status of satellite ozone measurements is given in Chapter 6 (see table 6-l).\n\nI -\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nDATA ORGANIZATION\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n215\n\nAND ANALYSIS OF STRATOSPHERIC FIELDS\n\nBackground\nThe optimal use of large sets of stratospheric measurements will result in a significant increase in the\nunderstanding of (1) the natural morphology of ozone, temperature, and other trace species, (2) the variations\nof these parameters over various time scales, and (3) the causes of these variations. Several analysis schemes\nare employed to utilize the various data bases available, ranging from relatively simple averaging of quantities, analyses using subjective or objective interpolation schemes, and finally, sophisticated statistical computations designed to handle large data sets or data with uneven spacing in time and/or space. The following\nsections summarize some of the more useful of these approaches.\n\nStandard Atmospheres\nAmong the earliest attempts to assemble and organize upper atmospheric data from various sources into a\ncoherent entity was the preparation of the United States Standard Atmosphere, 1962 and the subsequent supplements. This model utilized standard meteorological data for the troposphere, balloon data for the lower\nstratosphere, and the rocket data for the upper stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere, all referred to a\nlatitude of 45\xe2\x80\x9d North, average solar conditions, and averaged over a year. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere\nSupplements (1966) extended the altitude coverage to 1000 km based largely on Jacchia\xe2\x80\x99s empirical model\n(1965) and included systematic effects due to latitude, season, time of day, and solar activity. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere was updated in 1976 using new data for the region above 50 km and an analytic profile for\nthe upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere rather than the earlier tabulation.\n\nEmpirical Models\nEmpirical models of the neutral thermosphere have been utilized for organizing large data bases in a form\nsuitable for geophysical interpretation and comparison with other data (e.g., Jacchia, 1965; the OGO-6 and\nMass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter (MSIS) models; Hedin et al., 1974, 1977). The application of this\ntechnique has recently been extended to include a few stratospheric parameters, primarily the temperature\ndata derived from the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) instrument carried on the Nimbus-4\nsatellite, from total ozone data obtained from the IRIS and BUV instruments on Nimbus-4 and from ground\nmeasurements (see e.g. Reber et al., 1977; Keating et al., 1977).\nThe horizontal distribution of geophysical properties of the atmosphere (such as temperature, density, etc.) at\na given height and time can be represented by a spherical harmonic expansion in terms of geographic latitude\nand longitude:\nF(B,X] = fgo\n\nngo p#at, cos nX + bpn sin nX)\n\nwhere p; = Legendre\xe2\x80\x99s associated functions of latitude\n0\n\n= latitude (radians)\n\nX\n\n= longitude (radians)\n\nThis expansion can be further generalized by expanding the coefficients as a Fourier series in time to yield an\nanalytic expression to represent periodic variations as well.\n\n216\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe expansion given above can represent variations of any complexity in the atmosphere (at a constant\nheight). A standard product of the model generation is the set of coefficients for the various harmonics,\norders, and cross terms of the expansions which provide quantitative assessments of variations such as the annual, semi-annual, latitudinal, longitudinal, etc. A simple example is the P,Ocoefficient which is the global\naverage of the parameter involved, such as of total ozone. Figure 5-6 (lower) shows the variation of global\ntotal ozone calculated in this manner on a monthly basis using the BUV data from Nimbus-4 and the Dobson\nground data for the same time period. Integration of the spherical harmonics over the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres individually provides the hemispherical variations shown in figure 5-6 (upper). For descriptive\npurposes, one can summarize all the systematic variations included in a large data set (such as obtained from\nsatellites) in a relatively compact set of analytic expressions and the corresponding coefficients. Finally, the\nmodel can be expanded by including terms relating the systematic variations to other parameters, such as\nsolar irradiance and magnetic activity.\n\nSubjective Synoptic Analysis\nThe simplest and most straightforward\nrepresented by the long-term, published\nThese analyses are for the lOO-, 50-,\nHemisphere (12 GMT), extending from\n\nanalysis technique resulting in contoured hemispheric maps is that\nsubjective analyses from the Free University of Berlin (1958-1979).\n30-, and IO-mb height and temperature fields for daily Northern\nabout 1958 to the present.\n\nObjective Synoptic Analysis\nAdjustment Technique\nAn analysis technique that has been in use for several years is the adjustment scheme suggested originally by\nCressman (1959) and Yanai (1964). Basically, this method examines the data in the vicinity of an analysis gridpoint and adds a \xe2\x80\x9ccorrection\xe2\x80\x9d\nfactor to a first-guess value at that point. In practice, the influence of a data\npoint is usually weighted so that those farthest from the grid-point are weighted least, with an upper limit\ndesignated on the distance from the grid-point. The first-guess field can be flexible and, in practice, has ranged from a zonal average data field to the analysis from the previous time period (persistence), to a forecast\nfield via a numerical model using data from a previous time period as the initial condition.\nThe strength of this technique is that it can provide something more than a simple interpolation in large datagap areas (if data were available previously), but it suffers in that it cannot consider the asynoptic nature of\nsatellite data in a simple manner.\nWithin the NOAA, National Weather Service, the following stratospheric analyses, utilizing the above technjque, are being prepared on a routine basis:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nIOO-, 70-, and 50-mb maps of height, temperature,\navailable from late 1974 to the present.\n\nand wind, globally,\n\n70-, 50-, 30-, and IO-mb maps of height and temperature\navailable from 1964 to the present (Finger et al., 1965).\n\nfor the Northern\n\nat 00 GMT and 12 GMT\nHemisphere at 12 GMT,\n\n5-, 2-, and 0.4-mb maps of height and temperature for the Northern Hemisphere appropriate to the\nWednesday of each week (Staff, Upper Air Branch, 1975, 1976); from 1964 to the present and with the\nI-mb level added since July 1976.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n217\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nI\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d1\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x80\x9dI\nOZONE\n\n350\n\nDENSITY\n\nNORTHERN\nHEMISPHERE\n\n340\n330\n\nCOLUMN\n\n.\n\n\\\n\n320\n310\n300\n290\nz\nu\n2\n5\n\n280\n270\n\n/\nSOUTHERN\nHEMISPHERE\n\n-\\\\/\n\n260\n\n320\n\nGLOBAL\n\n310\n300\n290\nBUV\n\n280\n2.1~1\n\nAPR\n\nI\n\nJUL\n1970\n\nFigure 56.\n\nI\n\nOCT\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nJAN\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nAPR\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nJUL\n\n1971\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIt\nOCT\n\nI\n\nI II\nJAN\n\nI\nAPR\n\n1972\n\n(Upper) The Northern and Southern total ozone variations determined by integrating the\nmonthly averaged spherical harmonic expansion over the respective hemispheres.

After certification,\nNorth Carolina. An example of the\n5-20).\n\nOptimum Interpolation\nOptimum interpolation is an analysis scheme based on statistical concepts (Gandin, 1963; Gandin and Kagan,\n1974). Observed data are assigned weights so that the mean square error of interpolation to desired analysis\npoints (usually points of a regular grid) is a minimum in a statistical sense. A reasonably intelligent \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\nguess\xe2\x80\x9d of each field is desirable; usually, a short period prediction, persistence, climatology, or some combination of these is used.\nOptimum interpolation can be univariate or multivariate. In the former case, only observed data of the same\nkind as the field being analyzed are used. In the latter case, data which are related to the field being analyzed\nby gradient relationships (for example, wind data) to the geopotential height gradient via the geostrophic relationship are also used. The correlation statistics must be modified to include the gradient relationship.\nThe variable quality of observed data is allowed for in optimum interpolation. Poor quality data receive less\nweight, other factors being equal, in the analysis compared to data of good quality. The correlation of certain\ntypes of observational errors, which reduces the amount of independent information the observations contain, is also part of the analysis method.\n\nOptimal Estimation\nSatellite data are acquired continuously, regularly spaced in position and time. This regularity lends itself\nreadily to optimal estimation techniques, using a Kalman filter. Rodgers (1977) described an approach in\nwhich, at a given latitude and time, a variable is represented by a mean and series of Fourier coefficients expressing the longitudinal variation. Information on the precision of these coefficients is contained in a\ncovariance matrix which is also calculated.\nAt a given latitude, each new satellite overpass provides a new observation which may be used to update the\nprevious estimate of the coefficients. This is done by combining the measurement, weighted inversely by its\nvariance, with the weighted previous estimate. This results in a time series of estimates of the coefficients. The\ntwo may then be combined to yield a final optimal estimate of coefficients as a function of time. Perhaps the\nmajor result is that the coefficients can be used to produce optimal estimates of the instantaneous state of the\natmosphere (synoptic maps), although the data are obtained asynoptically.\nRodgers (1977) applied this technique to Selective Chopper Radiometer (SCR) data. Kohri and Gille (1977)\nhave studied the application of this approach to satellite data with realistic errors and data gaps. They found\nthat the LRIR temperature, geopotential and ozone data allowed 6 longitudinal wavenumbers, although most\nof the variance is contained in the lowest wavenumbers. An ozone map using this technique on LRIR data\nevery 4\xe2\x80\x9d of latitude is shown in figure 5-7.\nFrom this analysis, the meridional cross sections are immediately obtained from the mean coefficients. The\ngeopotential can be differentiated in the latitudinal direction to yield the zonai mean geostrophic wind, u.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n.:..\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n-Ye\n\ncunaR\n\nLMT\n\ne-c\n\n= 3LO.U\n0.0\n\n-\n\nc\nI\n\n_ ;\xe2\x80\x98,\n4\n\nTo\n\n219\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n. ..L .\xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n__... ..\n\n..+;,,\n\n\xe2\x80\x98.\n.. .\n\n-1-c\n\nI rmuLW\nCummlNmwLQ\n7.oooo\n\n.wooo\n\nn\n\n\xe2\x80\x985.3\xe2\x80\x99\n\nl\n\nSRI5\n\nFigure 57.

Zonal eddy components, v*, may also be obtained by differentiating the geopotential\ncoefficients in the latitudinal direction.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC CIRCULATIQN\nINTRODUCTION\nThe distribution of ozone within the stratosphere is strongly affected by stratospheric air motions transporting ozone and energy, which together with vertical motions influence the temperature distribution in the\nstratosphere. The temperature distribution is very important in the photochemistry of ozone. The motions, in\nturn, are strongly influenced by radiative sources and sinks of thermal energy, while ozone is the principal absorber of solar radiation in the stratosphere. The ozone distribution, the movement of air, and the radiative\nenvironment in the stratosphere, therefore, are all closely coupled.\nIn this section our current understanding of the circulation or motion field of the stratosphere and its interactions with the ozone distribution and the radiative processes in the stratosphere is presented. The first section\nintroduces the nomenclature of the various types of motion which are observed in the stratosphere. The manner in which motions respond to radiative forcing and produce the usual patterns of temperature and wind,\nwhich is often called the general circulation, is discussed next. Several types of specific motion patterns are\nthen discussed, including the quasi-biennial and semi-annual oscillations, sudden warmings and very short\nperiod motions. A separate section specifically details the present state of knowledge concerning how the\nozone distribution is determined by both the influences of atmospheric motions and chemistry. A final section\ndiscusses the possible stratospheric response to solar variability.\n\nTYPES OF MOTION\nAtmospheric motions are described in terms of the zonal average and the deviations from that average. These\ndeviations are referred to as eddy, or wave components. Waves which represent variations characterized by\nvery large wavelengths (zonal wavenumbers l-3) and by fairly long periods (several days or more) are known\nas planetary waves. Quasi-stationary planetary waves represent much of the variability observed in the extratropical stratosphere. Synoptic-scale waves are waves which have shorter horizontal wavelengths. Those\nsynoptic-scale waves, which are important in the stratosphere, are essentially upward extensions of extratropical weather systems and are confined to the lower stratosphere. Several other long-period oscillations\ncontribute to the variability of the equatorial stratosphere. These include the semi-annual, and quasi-biennial\noscillations, as well as such equatorial waves as the Yanai and Kelvin waves. Finally, there is the prominent\nannual oscillation of the zonal mean itself. Short-period motions (i.e., those whose periods are on the order of\n1 day or less) include the planetary-scale atmospheric tides, as well as much shorter scale waves. These shortperiod, small-scale waves are commonly divided into three groups: acoustic, inertial, and gravity waves. The\nfirst two of these groups, which are the result of compressibility or purely rotational effects, respectively, are\ngenerally unimportant in the stratosphere.\nThe characteristic periods and horizontal scales of the stratospheric waves, which are discussed in greater\ndetail in this chapter, are summarized in table 5-6. The relative amplitudes of these waves as a function of\nheight are plotted in figure 5-8. Synoptic-scale waves are vertically trapped and do not penetrate very high into the stratosphere. Quasi-stationary planetary waves are vertically trapped by the easterly zonal mean flow in\nsummer, but can propagate vertically in the winter zonal mean westerlies, growing in amplitude with height as\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n221\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nTable 5-6\nStratospheric\n\nWave Characteristics\n\nPeriod (days)\n\nPlanetary Waves\n\nZonal Wavenumber\xe2\x80\x99\n\n23\n\nType of Wave\n\n1-3\n\nEquatorial Waves\nKelvin\nYanai\n\n12-20\n4-5\n\nl-2\n4-5\n\nSynoptic-Scale\n\n23\n\n5-15\n\nGl\n\n1-2\n\n01\n\nWavelengths\n-1-100 km\n\nAtmospheric\n\nWaves\nTides\n\nGravity Waves\n\n*Zonal wavenumber\n\nis the number of waves which could fit around a latitude circle.\n\n-----\n\nFigure 58.\n\n-\n\nr\nKEY\nSynopt,c-%ale\nwarer\nGrarll\xe2\x80\x9d\nwarer\n\nI\n\\\n\n!\n\\ .q\n\nVertical distribution of wind amplitudes (order of magnitude only) associated with\nvarious atmospheric wave components (from an original graph by T.

Equatorial waves which are important in the tropical stratosphere also propagate energy vertically, but they are subject to strong radiative damping at stratospheric heights. Gravity waves, and those atmospheric tidal components which can propagate vertically, are less affected by this radiative damping, so\nthey continue to grow in amplitude as they propagate into the mesosphere. Before discussing the various\nwaves in more detail, the mechanisms which maintain the background zonal flow itself will be considered in\nthe next section.\n\nGENERAL CIRCULATION\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nBackground\nAn understanding of the general circulation of the stratosphere implies an understanding of the physical processes by which the wind, temperature and other properties of the stratosphere are maintained. This\nunderstanding includes an appreciation of which atmospheric phenomena contribute most importantly to the\nmaintenance of the mean state, seasonal fluctuations and interannual variability in the stratosphere. The\ntraditional approach to these questions is through diagnosis of data and of numerical model output using the\nconservation laws known to govern the atmosphere: conservation of mass, momentum, heat, and energy. An\nintegral part of most diagnostic studies of this type (see Lorenz, 1967 and 1969 for a review of the\ntropospheric general circulation) is the division of the meteorological fields being analyzed into a zonal mean\npart and the deviation from the zonal mean called the wave or eddy part of the flow field.\n\nMean Zonal Wind\nThe important features of the annual oscillation in the stratospheric and mesospheric zonal wind system are\ndepicted in figure 5-9 from Murgatroyd (1969). The discussion which follows summarizes what is known\nobservationally and theoretically about the annually-varying circumpolar jets which attain their maximum\nvelocities in the 60 to 70 km region.\nThe traditional means of observing winds and temperatures in the region between about 30 km and 65 km has\nbeen the meteorological rocket network. Both the rocket data and winds derived geostrophically from satellite\ntemperature data show that there are pronounced interhemispheric differences in the stratospheric jets in addition to the seasonal reversal that is evident in figure 5-9. They also show that the flow in summer is nearly\nindependent of longitude, while in winter there are large-amplitude meanders in the circumpolar flow (i.e.,\nplanetary waves). It is important to note that the spatial resolution of the meteorological rocket network is\nnot by itself sufficient to describe the annual variation of the distribution of zonal winds. Figure 5-9 indicates\nthat the peak-to-peak range of the annual cycle of middle atmosphere zonal winds is about 140 m see-*.\nThis net annual cycle is driven mainly by differential radiative heating which has maximum amplitude at\nabout 50 km. At this level, solar heating at the solstices is at maximum at the summer pole, decreasing toward\nthe winter pole, where infrared radiative cooling predominates. Figure 5-10 is a cross section of net radiative\nheating rate constructed from a number of sources by Leovy (1964) which illustrates these features. The shortwave heating is principally due to absorption of solar radiation by ozone; thus, changes in the zonally averaged ozone concentration in the upper stratosphere will affect the zonal mean flow there. It is also important to\nnote that throughout large portions of the stratosphere, there is normally a close balance between shortwave\nheating and infrared cooling, and that it is the much smaller residual sum of these which provides the in situ\ndrive for the motions in these regions. As discussed later in this chapter, the uncertainties associated with\nradiative transfer calculations make accurate direct diagnosis of such small residuals difficult.\nThe response to such differential heating is a meridional overturning with rising motion in the high-latitude\nsummer hemisphere and sinking motion in the high-latitude winter hemisphere.

The return branch of this meridional cell is located at much lower levels, where the density\nis much higher and the flow is correspondingly weaker.\nOne of the earliest models of this middle atmosphere circulation was that of Murgatroyd and Singleton\n(1961), who calculated the meridional overturning by assuming that the differential heating pattern was\nbalanced by the cooling and heating in the respective upward and downward branches of the overturning.\nSuch a model is not useful for predicting the amplitude of the zonal wind jets, because it does not specify how\nthe angular momentum put into the jets by Coriolis torque can be balanced. Such a model also ignores other\nmechanisms that can drive meridional overturning such as a horizontal flux of heat by the zonally-asymmetric\n(eddy) component of the motion field in the middle atmosphere.\nThe first model to incorporate most of the relevant processes in one form or another was that of Leovy\n(1964). His model predicts that meridional overturning and the zonal jets are a response to prescribed differential heating in the presence of parameterized horizontal fluxes of heat and momentum by eddies. Leovy\npresented results separately for the cases where the parameterization of these flux divergences took the form\nof a linear relaxation law (i.e., Newtonian cooling and Rayleigh friction) and where they took the form of\nconventional eddy diffusion. He was able to obtain summer and winter hemisphere jets of the observed\namplitude and at the right levels by reasonable choices of the coefficients in his parameterizations. His model\nresults also show a warm winter mesopause and cold summer mesopause which is in agreement with observation.\nMore recent models of the annual oscillation in the stratospheric zonal wind by Trenberth (1973a, b);\nSchoeberl and Strobe1 (1978a); and Holton and Wehrbein (1979) treat various processes more realistically\nthan the Leovy (1964) model. These model studies indicate that we still need to understand in more detail the\nmechanics of the interaction between planetary waves, the zonal flow, and the nature of the mechanical\ndissipation before we can successfully simulate this interaction in numerical models of the annual oscillation.\nIn the upper stratosphere, the annual cycle of zonal mean wind and the associated temperature field is not\nsmoothly varying, but often undergoes rapid irregular changes associated with large-scale wave activity in the\nwinter hemisphere. These changes in zonal mean temperature, although apparently associated with planetary\nwave activity in the winter hemisphere (Madden, 1975), extend well into the summer hemisphere (Fritz and\nSoules, 1970; and Labitzke and Barnett, 1973). These intra-hemispheric oscillations emphasize the essentially\nglobal nature of the stratospheric general circulation, which becomes increasingly apparent at higher\naltitudes. Enhanced planetary wave (zonal wavenumber l-3) activity often accompanies abrupt springtime\ntransitions from winter to summer circulation patterns in both hemispheres. These transitions are similar in\nmany respects to the major stratospheric mid-winter warmings which have been observed only in the Northern Hemisphere. Large amplitude planetary waves, which are coherent with planetary waves in the\ntroposphere, are observed in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere in winter (Muench, 1965), but in the\nsummer, wave activity is weak (Muench, 1968). However, in the lower stratosphere (below about 20 km),\nwave activity at both planetary and synoptic (zonal wavenumbers 4 to 15 or so) scales is present in all seasons,\nalthough it is greatest in winter.\n\nHeat, Momentum and Energy Budgets\nThe extratropical lower stratosphere (30 \xe2\x80\x98- 90 o latitude, lo-30 km) in the Northern Hemisphere has been comparatively well studied because relatively good coverage by rawinsonde observations has been available for\nsome years. Extensive studies of the energy balance of this region have been performed for two complete\nyears of data (Oort, 1964; Dopplick, 1971) and for a large number of shorter periods (Reed et al., 1963;\nMuench, 1965; and Julian and Labitzke, 1965, as well as others). The key finding of these studies was that the\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n225\n\nlower stratosphere is driven very strongly from below by eddy energy fluxes. They also show that the eddies\ntransport heat up the gradient of zonal mean temperature and that radiation tends to destroy the meridional\ngradients rather than produce them. Diagnosis of numerical general circulation models also indicates that the\nseasonal temperature variations in the lower stratosphere are controlled primarily by dynamical processes\nrather than by radiation (Manabe and Mahlman, 1976). An upward extension of the tropospheric meridional\ncirculation feature known as the Ferrel cell is driven by eddy fluxes of heat and momentum in the lower polar\nstratosphere of both hemispheres (Vincent, 1968; Mahlman, 1969; Adler, 1975). The disturbances which are\nimportant in the lower stratosphere include planetary-scale eddies and vertical extensions of baroclinically\nunstable synoptic-scale eddies. These large scale eddies, together with the mean meridional circulation,\ndominate the transport in the lower stratosphere. Heat and momentum exchange by small-scale turbulence\nappears to be relatively unimportant (Lilly et al., 1974).\nThe extratropical upper stratosphere differs from the lower stratosphere in several respects. Because synopticscale eddies generated in the troposphere do not penetrate to these altitudes, the eddy activity is dominated by\nthe planetary scale waves. In addition, the radiative forcing of the circulation becomes more important as one\ngoes upward in the stratosphere. As noted earlier, radiative forcing is the principal drive for the zonal wind\nsystem in the upper stratosphere, and dynamical transports by eddies provide a mitigating influence rather\nthan a determining influence. Between the lower stratosphere and the upper stratosphere, the relative importance of heat transport by eddies decreases, compared with heat transport by the mean meridional circulation.\nIn the lower stratosphere, eddy heat transport is sufficient to drive a thermally indirect mean meridional circulation, whereas there is a gradual transition to a thermally direct, radiatively forced circulation as the\nstratopause is approached from below. The planetary wave energy originates in the troposphere primarily as a\nresult of zonally asymmetric thermal and orographic forcing (Saltzman, 1968; Manabe and Terpstra, 1974).\nFurthermore, the propagation of these waves into the stratosphere is strongly dependent upon the zonal mean\nwind structure (Charney and Drazin, 1961; Dickinson, 1968a, 1968b; Matsuno, 1970; Simmons, 1974b; and\nSchoeberl and Geller, 1977). The zonal mean wind and planetary wave structures, therefore, are strongly interdependent.\nThe kinetic energy of the eddy component of the circulation is derived partially from local conversion from\navailable potential energy in the stratosphere and partly from convergence of upward energy flux from below.\nFigure 5-l 1 shows energy box diagrams for three layers of the stratosphere during two months of Southern\nHemisphere winter. Although these diagrams are based upon limited data, they demonstrate several general\nfeatures of the energy cycle as a function of altitude in the stratosphere. Both the relative importance of the\nconvergence of the upward flux of kinetic energy compared to conversion from potential energy and the absolute magnitude of the convergence per unit mass of the upward flux of energy increase with altitude in the\nupper portion of the stratosphere. The conversion of eddy available potential energy to eddy kinetic energy\nappears to be a manifestation of upward energy flux through the stratosphere rather than being associated\nwith in situ baroclinic instability (McIntyre, 1972; and Hartmann, 1976). The eddy kinetic energy delivered to\nthe stratosphere by upward flux from the troposphere is converted primarily into zonal mean kinetic energy\nthrough quasi-horizontal processes. Large transients in the amplitude of planetary waves can have a powerful\neffect on the zonal mean wind and temperature distributions as indicated by the stratospheric warming model\nof Matsuno (1971).\nThe relative importance of heat and momentum transport by small-scale turbulence in the upper stratosphere\nhas not been precisely defined, but it may increase with altitude as a result of breaking of gravity waves\n(Hodges, 1967, 1969). An increase in turbulent momentum exchange may be especially important for the\nmomentum balance of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, where it appears that both planetary scale eddies and the mean meridional circulation transport momentum poleward. Observations suggesting the\npresence of high frequency synoptic-scale disturbances near the stratopause have been reported by Leovy and\nAckerman (1973), but the importance of these phenomena for the general circulation of the stratosphere has\nnot been determined.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n226\n\nPRESENT\n\n3\n0.00067\n\n*\n\nAE\n0.0035\nl-01\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nI\n\nKE\n0.023\n(-.WO6)\n\n0.0016\n1\n\nk\n\n\\\n\n0.023\n\n\\\n\n0.024\n\nl-1Omb\n0.0013\n\n-\n\n0.02\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAE\n0.042\n(-0.0003)\n\nKE\n0.20\n(-0.0018)\n\n0.171\n\nKE\nA 0.67\n(-0.0036)\n\nlo-IOOmb\n4\n0.0014\n\nw\n\nAE\n0.23\n(0.002)\n\nk\n\n-2\n\nflux from below 1Omb = 0.167 Watts-m\nFigure 5-11.\n\nEnergy box diagrams for three stratospheric layers for the period 1 July to 6 September, 1973,\nin the Southern Hemisphere (15O-90\xc2\xb0S) determined from analysis of satellite data.

The units for the rates are W-md2 (Hartmann, 1976).\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n227\n\nIn the upper stratosphere, interactions between radiation, photochemistry and dynamics become extremely\nimportant. Temperature and ozone photochemistry are closely coupled, since the radiation balance in the upper stratosphere is essentially between absorption of solar radiation by ozone and infrared cooling to space,\nand ozone, in turn, is inversely proportional to temperature because of the temperature dependence of some\nof the reactions controlling the photochemical production of ozone (Craig and Ohring, 1958; Lindzen and\nGoody, 1965; and Blake and Lindzen 1973). Both the zonal mean and the eddy component of the general circulation in the upper stratosphere are coupled to radiation and photochemistry, since the radiative heating\ndrives the zonal mean circulation and damps upward propagating planetary waves. Radiative damping of upward propagating planetary waves has been the subject of several investigations (Dickinson, 1969; and Garcia\nand Geisler, 1974).\n\nContrast Between the Hemispheres\nA description of the Southern Hemisphere stratosphere has been given by Labitzke and Van Loon (1972) and\nKnittel (1976). The circulations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are quite different, both in the\ntroposphere and in the stratosphere, because of the differences in surface features in the two hemispheres.\nThe surface temperature at the South Pole is much colder than the North Pole because of the high ice sheet\ncovering the Antarctic Continent. These colder polar temperatures strongly influence the radiative environment of the polar stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, the quasi-stationary planetary wave amplitudes in the Southern Hemisphere are smaller because the\nzonal asymmetries in orography and surface thermal contrast which force these waves are much smaller in the\nSouthern Hemisphere than in the Northern. Approximately half of the total planetary wave energy in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is contained in eastward traveling waves 2 and 3, which appear to be generated in the\ntroposphere through the process of baroclinic instability rather than being primarily forced quasi-stationary\nwaves as in the Northern Hemisphere (Phillpot, 1969; Leovy and Webster, 1976; and Hartmann, 1979).\nAlthough the Southern Hemisphere stratosphere has periods of substantial planetary wave activity, there are\nno observed occurrences of the major stratospheric warmings with concurrent wind reversals such as occur in\nthe Northern Hemisphere. The reasons for this have not been isolated, but they seem likely to be related to the\nstrong radiative influence of the cold Antarctic Continent which continuously acts to generate a strong\npoleward temperature gradient, and to the weaker planetary wave forcing due to greater zonal symmetry in\nthe Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFinal Remarks\nThe preceding discussion indicates several deficiencies in our knowledge of the general circulation. The first is\nthat there are inadequate observations of the annual oscillation of zonal winds in the stratosphere and of\nplanetary wave motions in the upper stratosphere. Satellite-based observing techniques show great promise\nfor providing the needed information in both of these areas. From the theoretical standpoint, it is evident that\nexplicit modeling of the effect of planetary waves on the zonal wind system has not been successful. Furthermore, most models of the zonal wind system need considerable dissipation to reproduce the shape and\nmagnitude of the zonal wind jets. The source of such dissipation in the atmosphere is not known, but may be\ndue to motions on the space and time scales of internal gravity waves.\nA major effort will be required to take temperature, ozone, and other trace gas data which are now, or soon\nwill be, obtained from the current generation of research satellites and to convert them into useful data sets\nfor diagnostic studies of the stratospheric general circulation. These data sets are invaluable in themselves and\nare also necessary for the verification and proper interpretation of numerical modeling studies of the upper\natmosphere. A detailed month-by-month\nclimatology of the global stratosphere comparable to the\ntropospheric studies published by Oort and Rasmussen (1971) and Newell et al. (1972) should be possible with\ndata obtained from satellites in combination with conventional meteorological data. A few cross sections of\nzonal mean temperature from a single year of Selective Chopper Radiometer data have been published by\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE\n\n228\n\n: PRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nBarnett et al. (1972) and Barnett (1974), but a comprehensive study of several years of data including winds\nand eddy heat and momentum transport statistics has not been attempted. A proper matching between observational and numerical effort and refinement of both should be achieved in the near future. An important\nfurther refinement will be the proper integration of interactions between radiation, photochemistry, and\ndynamics into an overall understanding of the general circulation of the stratosphere. In addition, it is essential to obtain an adequate quantitative evaluation of the role of small scale motion, tides and turbulence in the\ngeneral circulation of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere.\n\nQUASI-BIENNIAL\n\nAND SEMI-ANNUAL\n\nOSCILLATION\n\nBackground\nThe annual oscillation was discussed in detail in the previous section on the Mean Zonal Wind. At mid- to\nhigh-latitudes, the annual oscillation accounts for most of the variance (that is, the deviation from the longterm mean) in the zonal wind. Closer examination of the wind data (mostly from balloons and rockets)\nreveals that the annual oscillation is not a simple seasonal reversal. There appear additional components\nwhich can be resolved into quasi-biennial and semi-annual oscillations which are not merely harmonics of the\nannua! oscillation. With the availability of new data, especially from satellites, quasi-biennial and semiannual oscillations have also been detected in the ozone and temperature variations,.\n\nThe Quasi-Biennial Oscillation\nMost of the variance, (i.e., deviation from some long-term mean) in zonal wind within 20\xe2\x80\x9d of the Equator\nand between about 18 and 30 km is contained in the quasi-biennial oscillation, whose period varies between\nabout 2 and 2.5 years. The maximum of this zonal wind system is located directly over the Equator and\ndescends with time. In the so-called westerlyphase of the oscillation, the maximum winds are from the West.\nAs this maximum slowly drifts downward, a descending easterly (that is, from the East) zonal wind appears in\nthe upper part of the domain (35 km). The westerly jet begins to decay with time once it drifts down below\nabout 25 km, and the easterly jet intensifies as it moves downward into the middle of the domain. When the\neasterly jet has replaced the original westerly jet, a half cycle has passed and the quasi-biennial oscillation is\nsaid to be in its easterly phase. Figure 5-12 from Coy (1979) shows a time-height cross section of zonal wind\ndata from a single radiosonde station near the Equator. In this representation, the downward drift of the\nzonal wind is clearly seen. Also notable in this figure is the considerable variation in intensity from cycle to cycle.\nAnalysis of the day-to-day fluctuations in the observed wind in the tropical Iower stratosphere was first\nundertaken by Yanai and Maruyama (1966) and Maruyama and Yanai (1967). It was soon established that the\nmotions discovered by these authors were associated with a wave of 4 or 5 day period, zonal wavelength of\nabout 10,000 km and phase propagation toward the West. This wave, known generally as the Yanai wave (or\nthe mixed Rossby-gravity wave) is vertically propagating in the tropical lower stratosphere and is observed to\nhave the largest amplitude there during the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Another type of\nwave, discovered by Wallace and Kousky (1968a), has a period of 10 to 20 days, zonal wavelength of 20,000\nor 40,000 km and phase propagation toward the East. This wave is generally known as the Kelvin wave. It is\nvertically propagating in the tropical lower stratosphere and is observed to have largest amplitude there during the easterly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Both the Yanai wave and the Kelvin wave are excited\nby processes in the troposphere.\n\nI\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nUmb)\n\n--\n\n~--\n\n7I\n\nlwwl~lll\n\nI\n\nI I\n\nI I\n\nII\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nI1111111111 I\n\n229\n\nHT.&m:\n\n._~~~ -___\n---------l=\n\nIO\n\n30\n\nIS\n\n26\n26\n\n20\n\n24\n22\n20\n18\n16\n34\n32\n30\n28\n26\n24\n22\n20\n16\n16\n34\n32\n30\n26\n26\n24\n22\n20\n16\nI6\n\ni\n\nFigure 5-12.\n\nI --\n\n-434\n\nTime-height section of the zonal wind near go N with the 15-year average of the monthly means\nsubtracted to remove annual and semi-annual cycles.

The vertical transport of momentum by the Yanai\nplicated process, but it was shown by Lindzen (1970) that the net upward momentum\neasterly (i.e., negative) and, hence, opposite to that of the Kelvin wave.\n\npositive) momentum\nthe westerly accelerawave is a more comflux by this wave is\n\nThe theory which incorporates the vertical momentum fluxes carried by the Kelvin wave and the Yanai wave\nas the drive for the quasi-biennial oscillation was advanced by Lindzen and Holton (1968) and in somewhat\nrevised form by Holton and Lindzen (1972). The mechanism works as follows: When the quasi-biennial\noscillation is in its westerly phase, the frequency of the (eastward-propagating)\nKelvin wave relative to the\nzonal flow decreases as the Kelvin wave penetrates into the westerly shear zone on the underside of the westerly jet. With the decrease of this so-called intrinsic frequency, the wave becomes more susceptible to damping\nby radiative cooling to space. By this process the Kelvin wave is essentially absorbed in the westerly shear zone\nof the quasi-biennial oscillation and, therefore, deposits westerly momentum there. The westerly jet thereby\nbuilds downward with time. Above this westerly jet, an easterly shear zone exists. As the (westwardpropagating) Yanai wave penetrates this shear zone, its intrinsic frequency decreases and the wave becomes\nincreasingly susceptible to radiative cooling to space. As the Yanai wave damps out, it deposits easterly\nmomentum, which acts to bring downward an easterly shear zone and ushers in the easterly phase of the\nquasi-biennial oscillation.\nThe magnitude of the momentum flux carried by the Yanai and Kelvin waves observed in the lower\nstratosphere is about right to account for the observed amplitude and period of the quasi-biennial oscillation.\nThus, there is little doubt that the above theory is essentially correct. Subsequent refinements of the theory\nhave occurred in the light of deeper understanding of wave-zonal interactions from papers by Andrews and\nMcIntyre (1976a) and Boyd (1976). These refinements are mainly concerned with questions of the horizontal\nstructure of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Thus, Andrews and McIntyre (1976b) showed that the introduction\nof mechanical dissipation causes the Yanai wave to transport momentum horizontally away from the\nEquator. This resolves the problem that the Yanai wave is structured in such a way that its vertical momentum\nflux deposition should produce twin easterly jets either side of the Equator, rather than the observed single\neasterly jet centered on the Equator. Most recently, Holton (1979) has presented a numerical model which\nshows that in the presence of mechanical damping, both Kelvin and Yanai waves incident from below tend to\nproduce a symmetric equatorial jet, even in the presence of cross-equatorial shears representative of those\nthat could be generated by the annual cycle in the global zonal wind system.\nThere is also a quasi-biennial oscillation in ozone concentration. Figure 5-13 from Wilcox et al. (1977) shows\nthe vertical distribution of amplitude and phase of the oscillation over eastern North America. The amplitude\nis largest in the lower polar stratosphere. The phase diagram shows that a low latitude maximum occurred\naround January of 1963, which was the time of maximum easterly winds in the quasi-biennial oscillation in\ntropical zonal winds. This evidence supports a theory of Diitsch and Ling (1973) in which an enhanced Hadley\ncirculation during the easterly phase of the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation is hypothesized to lead to increased ozone advection into the region 20\xe2\x80\x9d-30\xe2\x80\x9d latitude and 20-25 km. Subsequent poleward transport by eddies in the altitude range leads to the Arctic maximum, which occurs about 8 months after the low latitude\nmaximum as indicated in figure 5-13.\n\nSemi-Annual Oscillation\nIn the tropical stratosphere, the annual cycle is weak and there is a region where most of the variance in the\nzonal wind is contained in a semi-annual oscillation. This region extends roughly 20\xe2\x80\x9d either side of the\nEquator and from 30 km to about 60 km. As described in the previous section, the quasi-biennial oscillation\ncontains most of the variance below 30 km in this region of the tropics. Above about 60 km, little is known\nabout the temporal variation of the zonal wind in the tropics.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nC\nI\n\n231\n\nMB\nI,\n\nG\n1\n\nSW\nI\n\n1.K\nI\n\nG\nI\n\nc\n0\n\nIAl3\n-7\n\n24 -\n\n4-\n\n.%I\n\n70\n\nFigure 513.\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\nLATITUDE PiI\n\n30\n\n20\n\nlo\n\n00\n\n70\n\n60\n\n(Left) Amplitude of the quasi-biennial (29 month) oscillation\n(1011 molecules cm -3) near 80\xc2\xb0W (Wilcox et al., 1977).\n\n50\n\n40\nLATlT\xe2\x80\x9dDE\nPiI\n\n30\n\n20\n\n0\n\nin ozone concentration\n\n(Right) Phase of the quasi-biennial (29 month) oscillation in ozone concentration near\n80\xc2\xb0W. lsopleths are labeled with the number of months after 1 January 1963 that the first\nmaximum occurs.\n\nThe semi-annual oscillation is beyond the rawinsonde ceiling and has to be observed with meteorological\nrockets. It was first described comprehensively by Reed (1965, 1966). It is reasonably well established that the\noscillation has a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 60 m set-\xe2\x80\x99 and is centered on or very near the Equator. The\nwesterly wind jet is situated at about 60 km and the easterly wind jet at about 50 km. A time-height cross section from a single rocket station on Kwajalein Island is shown in figure 5-14, which also shows the quasibiennial oscillation. Although not obvious in this diagram, observational evidence by Reed (1966) indicates\nthat the westerly phase of the semi-annual oscillation drifts downward with time while the easterly phase remains at the same altitude. This characteristic is relevant to the theory of the oscillation.\nAs explained by Wallace (1973), fundamental difficulties arise in ascribing a westerly zonal jet at the equator\nto any process other than convergence of vertical momentum flux by waves. Since Kelvin waves are the only\nknown equatorial modes that carry westerly momentum upwards, it generally has been believed that the\nwesterly acceleration of the semi-annual oscillation is the result of Kelvin wave absorption. This view is not\nwithout difficulties, however, since the Kelvin waves that are observed (in the lower stratosphere) are absorbed by the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation and would not be available during this lengthy period\nto drive the westerly phase of the semi-annual oscillation.\nThe first hard evidence for the needed Kelvin waves came from analysis of the rocket winds themselves by\nHirota (1978), who isolated in these data an eastward propagating mode with a period of about 10 days and a\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n232\n\n1971\nFigure 5-14.\n\n1972\n\n1973\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n1974\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\nTime-height cross section showing observed zonal winds in the semi-annual oscillation\n(Coy, 1979).\n\nvertical wavelength of 15 to 20 km. The observed period is somewhat less than the typical 15-day period for\nthe Kelvin waves that are absorbed in the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation, hence these upper\nstratosphere waves must (for a given zonal wavelength) be moving somewhat more rapidly toward the east.\nDunkerton (1979) has presented a simple model of the semi-annual oscillation using radiative damping rates\nappropriate to the upper stratosphere and a Kelvin wave with features matching the wave observed by Hirota\n(1978). This model shows that the required westerly acceleration in the semi-annual oscillation can be provided if the upward momentum flux in the Kelvin wave is about one-third of the upward flux carried by the\nKelvin waves involved in the quasi-biennial oscillation. It remains to be established by observation that\nHirota\xe2\x80\x99s Kelvin wave carries this much momentum.\nIn the model of Dunkerton (1979) the easterly acceleration in the semi-annual oscillation is provided by a\nlinear law of relaxation to a prescribed easterly jet. The actual source of easterly momentum has not yet been\nestablished. A traditional candidate has been a lateral transfer of momentum out of the tropics and into the\nwincer hemisphere by upper stratosphere planetary waves. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the easterly regime of the semi-annual oscillation is fixed in altitude and does not propagate\ndownward. The verification of the hypothesis is hampered by the lack of data suitable for deducing the\nlatitudinal dependence of the horizontal momentum flux by planetary waves at these altitudes. A further\nuncertainty arises because of a present lack of knowledge in the area of how the relevant stationary planetary\nwaves interact with the low latitude zonal flow.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n233\n\nData assembled by Belmont et al. (1974) indicates that there is a secondary maximum in the semi-annual\noscillation of zonal winds that is located near and above the stratopause in high northern latitudes. This is\nshown in figure 5-15, which is taken from that reference. The maximum westerly phase of the oscillation there\noccurs about a week after equinox, as determined from both rocketsonde (Belmont et al., 1974) and radio\nreflection data (Belmont and Nastrom, 1979). The stratospheric portion of the oscillation apparently arises\nfrom the non-sinusoidal variation in solar radiation heating in high latitudes (DeVore and Venkateswaran,\n1977), although the mesospheric portion may be influenced by other effects.\n\nLATITUDE\nFigure 5-15.\n\nAmplitude (ms-1) of the semi-annual wave. Arrows indicate location of rocket stations\n(Belmont et al., 1974).\n\nData from the Nimbus-4 backscattered ultraviolet experiment show a semi-annual oscillation in zonal mean\ntotal ozone content as shown in figure 5-16, taken from Hilsenrath et al. (1979a). As can be seen from this\nfigure, some 40% of the variance from the annual mean in 1970 is contained in a semi-annual oscillation in\nequatorial latitudes. They show, however, that the semi-annual oscillation detected in the total ozone is a\nresult of the annual oscillation in the two hemispheres whose phases are 6 months apart. In the following\nyear, the semi-annual component is much reduced, possibly because of a quasi-biennial oscillation. In both\nyears, the amplitude was large in high latitudes; however, the variance is near the noise level in the Northern\nHemisphere but high in the Southern Hemisphere. The need to extrapolate data poleward of 67\xe2\x80\x99 latitude in\nwinter makes this result somewhat uncertain.\n\nSUDDEN WARMINGS\n\nSudden warmings are strong increases of temperature in middle to high latitudes of the winter-spring\nhemisphere, associated with planetary zonal wave 1 and/or 2 disturbances in the stratospheric and\ntropospheric circulation. Major warming events commonly involve two or three warming and cooling\nepisodes culminating in substantial net warming of the polar stratosphere, and a reversal of the midstratospheric mean zonal wind from westerly to easterly.\nAside from intrinsic interest in warmings as an extreme manifestation of dynamical processes in the\nstratosphere, they are important because of the associated changes in the circulation (which influence the\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n234\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n-\n\n1970\n\n. . . . . . . . . 1971\n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nLATITUDE\nFigure 5-16.\n\nBelow, amplitude of semi-annual wave and above, variance of second harmonic of total ozone\nfrom first and second year of 8UV data (Hilsenrath et al., 1979a)\n\ndistribution of minor constituents) and because of the large temperature changes observed (which are important to the photochemistry of the upper stratosphere). The importance of temperature dependence in upper\nstratosphere chemistry has been stressed by various authors (e.g., Barnett et al., 1975, and Luther et al.,\n1977). Temperature increases by 30-80\xc2\xb0C in one week, usually greatest near 40 km, have been observed.\nObservational evidence of ozone changes in warming events has been given by Zullig (1973); Ghazi et al.\n(1976), Miller et al. (1976), and others.\nThe knowledge of stratospheric warmings has been greatly expanded in the past decade by (1) a vastly improved observational framework, including satellite observations of both hemispheres, and (2) theoretical insights\ngained by dynamic mode!ing. Comprehensive descriptions have been given by Quiroz et al. (1975), Labitzke\n(1977), McInturff (1978), and Schoeberl (1978), among others while model simulations have been made by\nMatsuno (1971), Holton (1976), and others identified in the above descriptive papers. More recent simulations have been made by Haggard and Grose (1978), Schoeberl and Strobe1 (1979) and Lordi et al; (private\ncommunication). Recent comprehensive accounts of the observed planetary wave structure include, for the\n\n-\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n235\n\nstratosphere, Labitzke (1977) and for both the troposphere and stratosphere, Quiroz and Nagatani (1976),\nLabitzke (1978), and Quiroz (1979~). However, various important questions, some of which are discussed\nbelow, have not been resolved.\n\nFrequency of Warmings and Circulation Reversals\nAs illustrated in figure 5-17, warmings of various degrees of significance are common. Several usually occur\nin any winter (this applies also to the Southern Hemisphere except that the season of greatest activity is\ndelayed relative to the Northern Hemisphere). Warmings which affect the polar region over a deep\nstratospheric layer in such a way as to reverse the meridional gradient of mean stratospheric temperature\n(figure 5-17) are less frequent. Warmings accompanied by a circulation reversal (denoted by CR in figure\n5-17) at 10 mb (30 km) are even less common: two wintertime cases in four years in this sample, and usually\none case every spring. The Northern Hemisphere frequencies in this recent four-year sample are consistent\nwith earlier data sets (e.g., Labitzke, 1977, for 1964/65 to 1976/77) and indicate a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d wintertime event\nabout once in two years. The traces in figure 5-17 further illustrate the great variability in warming activity\nfrom year to year. The downward penetration of zonal mean flow reversal is also variable. For example, in\nJanuary, 1977 in connection with an exceptionally strong warming, the flow was reversed down to the lower\ntroposphere (Quiroz, 1977; O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Taylor, 1979).\nSignificant warmings occur in the Southern Hemisphere as well, but mid-winter circulation reversals have not\nbeen observed (Quiroz, 1974). There are some systematic differences in the zonal circulation and long-wave\nactivity of the two hemispheres, perhaps accounting for the observed delay in the occurrence of maximum\ntotal ozone in the Antarctic, relative to the Northern Hemisphere (Prabhakara et al., 1976).\n\nEnergy and Forcing from the Troposphere\nTheoretical arguments indicate that upward flux of wave geopotential energy and the horizontal transports of\nheat and momentum are key factors in the development of stratospheric warmings. Figure 5-18 illustrates\nperiods of strong geopotential flux through the base of the stratosphere (near 100 mb) and strong heat\ntransports (peaking around January 25 and February 20 at 50 mb, 60\xe2\x80\x9dN) which were clearly important processes in the event of early 1979 (Quiroz, 1979~). In their analysis of the event of 1976-1977, O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and\nTaylor (1979) indicated acceleration of the circulation reversal by the observed pattern of momentum\ntransport. Further appraisal of these factors in a wide range of warming cases would serve to clarify the dominant processes.\n\nI\n\nSome features of stratospheric warmings have been simulated by introducing tropospheric forcing in zonal\nwavenumbers 1 or 2 which was held nearly constant for about 25 days in the work of Matsuno (1971) and\nHolton (1976). In the real atmosphere, the duration of sustained high wave amplitude is variable, and important contributions may be due to both zonal wavenumbers 1 and 2. Quiroz (private communication) has\nobserved several discrete cases of large tropospheric wave amplitude, in each of several winters, with a wide\nrange of \xe2\x80\x9cresponses\xe2\x80\x9d in the stratosphere. Concurrent stratospheric flow conditions, the duration of\ntropospheric forcing (Geisler, 1974), and interaction between waves 1 and 2 may be among the most important factors influencing the response in the stratosphere. A need exists for isolating those tropospheric and\nstratospheric factors which, in combination, assure the occurrence of strong warming and circulation reversal.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n236\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nt8\nt4\n\nc\n\n1975-76\n\nCR\n\n1976-77\n\nCR\n\n-124,\n+8 -\n\nNoV\n\n30\n\nDEC\n\n31\n\nIAN\n\n31\n\nFEB\n\n28\n\nMAR\n\nFigure 5-l 7.

Such data have led to the deduction (Labitzke,\nwarmings are those exhibiting a large wave 1 height amplitude accompanied by a\n1978) that \xe2\x80\x9cmajor\xe2\x80\x9d\nminimum in wave 2. However, wave 2 may have special importance, since (1) significant wave-wave interaction may occur in the troposphere in an early phase of a warming event, and (2) the reversal of the mean zonal\ncirculation may actually be associated with strong amplification of tropospheric-stratospheric\nwave 2, as in\nlate February, 1979 (Figures 5-18 and 5-19). In figure S-18, note the attainment of zonal mean easterlies at 10\nmb (65 \xe2\x80\x9cN) in late February, keyed to a strong development of wave 2 (Figure 5-19), while wave 1 was declining in amplitude. The strong wave 1 development in late January, which accounted for a vast \xe2\x80\x9cAleutian\xe2\x80\x9d\nanticyclone in the stratosphere (Figure 5-20), can be shown to be related to the superpositioning of the\nretrogressing wave 1 with the quasi-stationary wave 2, in the troposphere (Quiroz, 1979~). In view of such\nbehavior, which was observed in the major warming event of December-January, 1976-1977 (Quiroz, 1977), it\nis important to elucidate the role of traveling and stationary components of these waves. In this connection,\nthe recent theory of Tung and Lindzen (1979) is noteworthy.\n10\n\nmb\n\n20\n\nJAN 79\n\nFEB 79\nAMPLITUDE (HEIGHT), DECAMETERS\n\nFigure519.\n\nlsolines of height amplitude\n\nof zonal waves 1 and 2 at levels 700-10 mb (Quiroz,\n\n1979c).\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n/\n\n\'WI33\n\nFigure 520.\n\nI -\n\n--\n\n010th\n\n239\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nANALYSI?\n\n10-mb map for 27 February 1979, showing split polar vortex and anticyclonic\nover polar region, with warm centers near 100\xc2\xb0W, 50\xc2\xb0E and 75\xe2\x80\x99N.\n\nsystem extending\n\n240\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nLow-Latitude Cooling\nHigh-latitude warming is accompanied by low-latitude cooling, consistent with the concept of poleward heat\nflux, previously incorporated in the model simulation of Matsuno (1971). However, cooling can be discerned\nto prevail nearly simultaneously to polar latitudes of the opposite hemisphere. Further investigation of this\nstructure and of the nature of low-amplitude cross-equatorial wave and zonal mean features may increase the\nunderstanding of the role of inter-hemispheric processes in stratospheric warmings.\n\nTropospheric Condition for Circulation Reversal\nFinally, it should be emphasized that circulation reversals depend not only on the reversal of the meridional\ngradient of stratospheric temperature, but on the polar tropospheric condition as we!l. In contrast to the event\nof 1976-1977, the explosive dramatic warming in late January, 1978 (figure 5-17) did not involve a circulation\nreversal because a strong poleward pressure gradient was maintained in the troposphere during the short\n\xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x9d of the stratospheric warming. This exemplifies the need for awareness of tropospheric conditions at all\nstages of a warming event.\n\nFinal Remarks\nStratospheric warmings are especially important because of the potential effects of the associated circulation\npatterns on the distribution of ozone and other constituents. A great deal is known about the warmings and\nsome of the observed features have been reproduced, at least qualitatively in model simulations employing\nsingle-wave tropospheric forcing. To answer several important questions, research is needed to:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nBetter define relationships between stratospheric temperature and height disturbances, on the one hand,\nand large planetary wave amplitudes in the troposphere, on the other, since strong tropospheric wave\namplification is not a sufficient condition for strong stratospheric warming (in contrast to some model\nresults).\nImprove knowledge of the relevant heat transport patterns in the troposphere and stratosphere, which\nmay involve knowledge of the vertical structure of the responsible eddies and perhaps determination of\nthe origin of amplifying waves.\nDefine unambiguously the mode(s) of vertical propagation\ncritical-level interaction.\n\nof a warming and determine the role of\n\nSHORT-PERIOD MOTIONS\nBackground\nThe short-period motions in the stratosphere can be divided conveniently into two groups: (1) those whose\ntypical time scales are comparable to a day, and (2) those whose time scales are short when compared to a day.\nThe latter are usually of the order of one hour or less, and include internal gravity waves and the shorter\nperiod, intermittent fluctuations known as clear air turbulence (CAT). These various short-period motions\nare important in stratospheric studies for several reasons and are discussed in detail in the following sections.\nl\n\nl\n\nShort-period fluctuations of the meteorological fields complicate the analysis and interpretation\nmeteorological measurements taken with inadequate temporal or spatial resolution and coverage.\nShort-period, vertically propagating waves generated in, br transmitted\nsignificantly affect the mesospheric circulation.\n\nof\n\nby, the stratosphere may\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nl\n\nl\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n241\n\nShort-period motions such as CAT are important in the free exchange of air and chemical constituents\nacross the tropopause.\nFluxes of mass, momentum, and energy associated with short-period motions may be locally important\nin modulating longer period components of stratospheric circulation and photochemistry.\n\nAtmospheric Tides\nAtmospheric tides, characterized in the earlier section on Types of Motion, are planetary-scale, regular\noscillations of wind, temperature, and pressure fields. The two most prominent tides are the thermally driven\ndiurnal and semi-diurnal tides, whose periods are one, and one-half solar day, respectively. The classical\ntheory of atmospheric tides, which has been thoroughly reviewed by Chapman and Lindzen (1970), is based\nupon the inviscid primitive equations, linearized about a motionless basic state, and generally has used highly\nidealized representations of the thermal forcing due to the ozone and water vapor absorptions of solar radiation. Yet, as shown in figure 5-21, this theory is remarkably successful in simulating the diurnal tidal winds\nobserved in the stratosphere by rocketsondes. Similar agreement is obtained for the semi-diurnal winds, except that the phase reversal of the tide is observed near 50 km rather than at 25 km as predicted by the classical\ntheory. Reed (1972) suggested that this discrepancy might be due to the theoretical neglect of the mean wind,\n\nFigure 521.\n\nComparison of Lindzen\xe2\x80\x99s theoretical predictions with the amplitude and phase (hour of maximum)\nof the diurnal variation of meridional wind observed between 30 and 60 km at different latitudes\n(Reed, Oard, and Sieminski, 1969).\n\n242\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nbut extension of the classical theory to include such winds and their geostrophically related temperature gradients does not entirely eliminate the problem (Lindzen and Hong, 1974; Walterscheid, 1978). More recently,\nLindzen (1978) has suggested that an additional source of semi-diurnal forcing due to daily variations in\ntropical rainfall could raise the theoretical phase reversal height to 50 km, while simultaneously removing a\nrather persistent phase discrepancy of 44 minutes between the predicted and observed semi-diurnal surface\npressure maxima.\nThe aforementioned atmospheric tides are functions of local time; that is, their zonal and temporal\nwavenumbers are identical, as would be expected for oscillations driven by the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s apparent motion\noverhead. However, not all tidal forcings have this simple form. Wallace and Patton (1970) showed that the\ndiurnal surface heating was strongly modulated by land-sea differences. Using an idealized heating distribution, McKenzie (1968) demonstrated that topographically modified surface heating could produce diurnal atmospheric tides of different zonal wavenumbers, many of which would propagate vertically into the\nstratosphere. Although significant longitudinal differences have been observed in the diurnal tides below the\nstratopause, it is not clear whether these are due to topographic forcing, variations in the mean wind, or variations in the tropopause height. Large seasonal variations of the diurnal tides in the stratosphere also are\nobserved, and these may be the result of seasonal changes in the background state (temperature and wind) or\nchanges in the distributions of water vapor and of ozone (Wallace and Tadd, 1974; and Nastrom and Belmont, 1976).\nBecause tidal phase speeds are too large for critical level interactions to occur, atmospheric tides can interact\nwith the mean zonal flow only during recent changes of the background state or in regions of strong heating\nor dissipation. Modifications of the stratospheric zonal mean wind by atmospheric tides are thought to be\nsmall compared to planetary wave effects. The ultimate fate - and thus effect - of those tidal components\ngenerated by longitudinal variations of topography and heating is presently unknown.\n\nGravity Waves; Turbulence\nGravity waves are generated in stably stratified layers by flow over topographic barriers or by other perturbations of the background flow. Their periods typically range from several minutes to an hour or more, and\ntypical wavelengths are of the order of 100 km in the horizontal, and 1 km in the vertical. Like their atmospheric tidal counterparts, those gravity waves which can propagate vertically will grow in amplitude with\nheight. Thus, although they are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, their largest amplitudes probably occur in the\nmesosphere just prior to their degeneration into turbulence or prior to their attenuation by nonlinear transfer\nof wave momentum and energy to other components of the circulation (Hines, 1970, and Hodges, 1969). The\nresulting vertical convergence of wave momentum flux, together with the atmospheric tides, may strongly influence the mean circulation of the mesopause region (Houghton, 1978). Models of the upper atmospheric\nzonal jets tend to require large dissipation to produce the observed decrease of the zonal wind above the\nstratopause (Leovy, 1964; Schoeberl and Strobel, 1978b; Holton and Wehrbein, 1979). Whether the dissipation required by these models is physically related to the dissipation generated by the turbulent breaking of\nupward propagating, short-period waves is not clear. The periods and horizontal wavelengths of gravity\nwaves are such that, in many cases, gravity wave phase speeds, unlike those of atmospheric tides, can be less\nthan stratospheric wind speeds. Where the phase velocity of the gravity wave equals the wind velocity, critical\nlevels occur. Linear theory, with and without dissipation present, predicts that when an upward propagating\ngravity wave encounters a critical level, most of its wave momentum flux will be absorbed by the mean flow\n(Booker and Bretherton, 1967). More recent work (Fritts and Geller, 1976) indicates that the incident gravity\nwave can excite shear instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz waves) near the critical level of the wave. Since these instabilities will eventually dissipate into turbulence (Fritts, 1978), gravity wave critical levels may be an important source of stratospheric turbulence. In addition, nonlinear interactions, involving either the incident\ngravity wave or the subsequently amplifying Kelvin-Helmholtz\nbi!lows, may generate neutral gravity waves\ncapable of radiating momentum away from the critical level (Fritts, 1979). The wave momentum flux\n\n-m\n\n. ..I\n\nI\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n243\n\nassociated with these radiating waves noticeably enhances the wave momentum flux (actually wave-action; see\nMcIntyre and Andrews, 1978), which leaks to higher altitudes. It remains to be seen whether or not planetaryscale waves can also radiate part of their momentum during critical level interactions.\nKung (1967) estimated that the energy dissipation over the Northern Hemisphere at jet stream levels by\nsubsynoptic-scale phenomena is comparable to the energy dissipation in the surface boundary layer. Much of\nthis high-level dissipation may occur during episodes of CAT defined as any turbulence not directly associated\nwith convective activity. The extent to which instabilities induced by gravity waves contribute to CAT is\nunknown since turbulence generated by shear instability of the background zonal jets near the tropopause is\nprobably more common in the lower stratosphere (Bretherton, 1971).\nTo what extent CAT mixes the lower stratosphere is still uncertain, but the area and time-averaged effective\nvertical eddy diffusivity estimated from observations of the turbulent heat flux (Lilly et al., 1974; Heck, 1977;\nCadet, 1977) appears to be an order of magnitude less than the vertical transport due to all scales of motion\n(Gudiksen et al., 1968). However, neglect of this dissipation could lead to overestimates of the strength of the\njet stream near the tropopause. The turbulent-scale dissipation also appears to be an essential part of\ntropospheric-stratospheric\nexchange (Shapiro, 1978), as will be discussed later in the section entitled Mass Exchange Processes. As is the case for gravity waves, parameterization of the effects due to CAT have been\nhampered by the lack of detailed understanding of how large-amplitude waves in a stably stratified region\ndegenerate into turbulence.\nThere is indirect evidence that motions may exist with vertical scales smaller than those usually associated\nwith gravity waves, yet with a temporal coherence greater than that expected for turbulence. Observations of\nthe vertical profiles of ozone (Evans et al., 1979) and other constituents such as O(3P), OH and Cl0 (Anderson, 1975, 1976, Anderson et al., 1977) show anomalous thin regions where the mass mixing ratio varies\nsignificantly within vertical distances of 1 to 2 km. The implication is that these quantities have been advected\nlarge distances in narrow layers; however, gravity waves with such small vertical scales will have time periods\nand amplitudes much too small to produce the required advection. Whether such motions actually exist is\nuncertain, since the available observational techniques do not have the vertical resolution and temporal consistency to directly measure the persistence of such motions. At this time, the question of the existence and\nnature of such motions remains unanswered.\nSynoptic-Scale Instabilities\nPartial reflection radiowave wind observations at high latitudes have shown large day-to-day variations in the\namplitudes and phases of atmospheric tides, and of gravity waves at mesospheric heights. These same observations occasionally show a two-day oscillation in mesospheric winds which seems to be associated with an\noscillation of similar period in stratospheric temperatures near 20 km at high latitude (Stening et al., 1978).\nObservations from many other sources suggest that transient motions have their largest amplitudes near both\nthe stratopause and mesopause (Green, 1972). Furthermore, analysis of daily meteorological rocket data\ntaken at Ft. Churchill (at 59 \xe2\x80\x9cN) during December reveal large-amplitude, high-frequency disturbances above\n45 km (Leovy and Ackerman, 1973). These latter observations, shown in figure 5-22, strongly suggest that at\nleast some short-period transients are generated locally in the vicinity of the stratopause. These transients do\nnot simply represent disturbances propagating from below. Studies by Simmons (1974a) and Pfister (1977) indicate that the zonal mean wind near the wintertime stratopause can become unstable, inducing amplifying\nwaves whose characteristics are consistent with the analysis of Leovy and Ackerman-(l-973). Furthermore,\nzonally averaged geostrophic winds derived from satellite data show that the winter stratosphere is occasionally barotropically unstable (i.e., the zonal mean wind could transfer kinetic energy to an amplifying eddy) on individual days (Leovy and Webster, 1976).\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n244\n\nE\n\n60\n\n50\n\n3\ni\n\n4o\n\nt\n\n30\n\n-\n\n,j--j-ql;;m\n---I.-:\nZONAL\nIO\n\n12\nDECEMBER\n\nFigure 522.\n\nWIND\n\n1969\n\nI\n\nI\n\n14\n\n16\nOATE\n\nIt3\n\n(UT)\n\nTime cross sections of temperature, zonal wind and meridional\nDecember 1969 (Leovy and Ackerman, 1973).\n\nwind components\n\nover Ft.

For now, the eddy momentum and heat fluxes due to these\nwaves appear to be of secondary importance to the stratospheric circulation, but are possibly of greater importance in the mesosphere (Dickinson, 1973a, and Simmons, 1977).\nInstability mechanisms involving the zonal mean flow near the stratopause appear to excite only weak,\nshallow disturbances (Simmons, 1972). Although the eddy heat and momentum fluxes associated with these\nunstable waves could be important locally, the fluxes associated with vertically propagating planetary waves\nare far more important to the overall stratospheric circulation (Simmons, 1974b, and Matsuno, 1971).\n\nOZONE CONTROL BY DYNAMICS AND CHEMISTRY\nBackground\nThe observed distribution of ozone has long intrigued atmospheric scientists because, although it is\nphotochemically produced, its maximum total column abundances are found at high latitudes in the spring.\nThis distribution implies that both photochemistry and atmospheric transport play important roles in determining the ozone distribution. The global network of Dobson stations has provided a substantial data base on\nthis latitudinal distribution of columnar ozone and its seasonal variations (see figure 5-23 from Diitsch, 1971).\nSatellite observations provide additional evidence that the Dobson network captures the principal features of\nthe zonal mean distribution of columnar ozone. In this section, the physical mechanisms believed to be\nresponsible for the distribution of ozone are discussed. Emphasis is placed upon transport by atmospheric\nmotions and its relationship with photochemical sources and sinks of ozone, rather than on the details of the\nphotochemistry itself, which is treated elsewhere.\n\nPhysical Mechanisms\nThe ozone distribution in the atmosphere is affected by both photochemistry and dynamical influences.\nHowever, it is possible to divide the atmosphere into regions where photochemistry and dynamics, respectively, appear to be dominant. Figure 5-24 shows the photodissociation rate of molecular oxygen for solsticial\nconditions. Superimposed on figure 5-24 are dotted lines which indicate the approximate locations of the\nlimits of the regions of dynamical and photochemical control. Between these two regions is a transition region\nwhere both dynamics and photochemistry are important in determining the ozone concentration. Division of\nthe atmosphere into three separate regions is helpful, but somewhat artificial since, on one hand, dynamics\ncan affect the distribution of photochemically active species in the upper stratosphere by altering the\ntemperature there, while, on the other hand, photochemistry can affect the ozone concentration in the\ndynamically controlled region by alternating the ozone concentration near the upper boundary of the\ndynamically controlled region. Nevertheless, the division of the atmosphere into regions as shown in figure\n5-24 is very useful in understanding the variations in ozone around latitude circles, which are associated with\nthe presence of planetary waves. Figure 5-25 shows the phase of the zonal wavenumber 1 components of\nozone, temperature and height at 60\xe2\x80\x9dN on November 1, 1975, observed by the Limb Radiance Inversion\nRadiometer (LRIR) (Gille et al., 1979). Around 10 mb, the ozone is in phase with the height and temperature,\nwhereas at about 3 mb, there is a rapid variation in the phase of the ozone so that at 2 mb the ozone is about\n180 degrees out of phase with the temperature, as would be expected from photochemical considerations\nalone. The mechanisms involved in this change of the phase of the ozone variation associated with planetary\nwaves and its potential importance in enhancing ozone transport in the transition region have been discussed\nby Hartmann and Garcia (1979).\n\nlllIlllllIl\n\nI\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n246\n\nFEB\n\n9O\xe2\x80\x9dN\n\nMAR APR MAY JUN\n\nJUL AUG SEP OCT\n\nNW\n.---\n\nOFC\n---\n\n30\xc2\xb0N\n\n< 260\n\n/\n\nI\n\n30\xe2\x80\x9ds\n\n60\xe2\x80\x9ds\n\n9o\xe2\x80\x9ds\n\nI\n\nFigure 5-23.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ni\n8\nMONTH\n\nThe observed behavior of columnar\nseason (Diitsch, 1971).\n\n9\n\nIO\n\nII\n\nozone (Dobson units) as a function\n\n12\n\nI\n\nof latitude and\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n0.05\n\nWinter\n\n80s\nI\n\n60 s\n\n40 s\nI\n\n1\n-I--\n\n20 s\nI\n\n0\nI\n\n1\n\n247\n\nSummer\nI\n\n20 N\nI\n\n40N\nI\n\nI\n\n60 N\nI\n\nI\n\n80~\nI\n\nI\n\n-70\n\n0.1\n0.2\n\n-60\n\nIO\n\n-30\n\n0.5\nI .o,\na\nE 2.0,\nw 5.0,\ncr\n2 10,\nWI\nl-g 20,\na\n50.\n\n-50\n\n\\\n\\\n\n.40\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\\\n\n-z\ntf.\n\n.30\n\n\\\n\nlg\n-\n\n3 \'\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\.\n\n1\n\nW\nI\n\n.20\n\n100,\n200.\nIO\n\n500,\n1000\n\nI\n\n80 s\n\nI\n\nI\n\n60 s\n\nI\n\nI\n\n40 s\n\nI\n\nI\n\n20 s\n\nI\n\n1\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n20 N\n\nI\n\nI\n\n40 N\n\nI\n\nI\n\n60 N\n\n1\n\nI\n\n80 N\n\n0\n\nLATITUDE\n\nFigure 5-24.

The nature of the horizontal\ntransport of ozone in the lower stratosphere has been discussed by many researchers. For example, Martin\nand Brewer (1959) found significant correlations between vertical motions, temperature, and vorticity at 100\nmb and total ozone. Newell (1961) has provided observational evidence for a strong positive correlation between meridional velocity, temperature in the lower stratosphere, and columnar ozone. His analyses also\nshow that these horizontal fluxes of ozone may be quite transient. Hunt and Manabe (1968) analyzed the\nplanetary wave structure of a tracer at 65 mb in their model calculations. The local concentration maxima\nseemed to be located to the east of the planetary wave troughs. Wallace (1978a) has described a mechanism to\nexplain the counter-gradient fluxes of ozone in the winter lower stratosphere.\nIn the last few years, satellite observations of the global field of ozone have allowed more extensive studies of\nthe transport of ozone in the stratosphere. One of the first studies, by Miller et al. (1977), used preliminary\nbackscatter ultraviolet (BUV) ozone observations, together with conventional wind analyses, to calculate ed,dy transports. These are depicted, for 30 mb, in the upper part of figure 5-26. In addition, at 10 and 30 mb,\nmeridional velocities were available from conventional analyses. They were used to obtain the mean meridional transports, which are shown (for 30 mb), in the lower part of figure 5-26. The near cancellation between the eddy and mean meridional transports in the lower stratosphere is clearly displayed. This near\ncancellation in the lower stratosphere is one of the severe problems in the experimental determination of net\nozone transport.\nCurrently functioning satellite observing systems, discussed earlier in this chapter, will allow the simultaneous\ndiagnoses of global fields of ozone and geostrophic winds, thus allowing a detailed climatology of the ozone\ntransport to be attempted. Figure 5-27 shows a zonal cross section of the poleward ozone transport by eddies\non November 1, 1975, determined from LRIR data (Gille et al., 1979). Although still in the early stages,\nanalysis of satellite observations will soon greatly expand the knowledge of ozone transport.\n\nModeling of Transport and the Ozone Distribution\nThree-dimensional models (or the General Circulation Models) provide the best analytical tool for describing\ntransport processes. These models in most cases use the so-called primitive equations to calculate the various\nscales of transports directly. With the addition of chemistry and with a sufficiently high upper boundary, a\nreasonable estimate of the global distribution of ozone can be achieved. There are presently numerous\n3-dimensional models which incorporate dynamics, chemistry, and radiation and varying degrees of feedback. A more complete discussion of the approaches and efforts for the various 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional\nmodels was given in Chapter 2. For the purpose of this discussion the model of Cunnold et al. (1975) will be\nused to illustrate our ability to model and understand the processes which determine the global ozone distribution.\nThe model begins with a continuity equation where the local time rate of change of ozone is equal to the sum\nof the large scale flux convergence (by the 3-dimensionai wind), the sub-scale transport effects (subgrid diffusion coefficients), and the physical and chemical sources and sinks. Figure 5-28 shows the simulation of the\nseasonal variation in total ozone as a function of latitude achieved in this Northern Hemisphere calculation as\nwell as the observed Northern Hemisphere distribution of total ozone.\nThe photodissociation of molecular oxygen, which is responsible for the production of odd oxygen (which is\n99% or more 0, below approximately 45 km) is dependent on the ozone distribution, and has been calculated\nto yield the production rate given in figure 5-24. Figures 5-29, 5-30, and 5-31 depict the calculated contributions that horizontal advection by planetary waves, mean circulation, and chemistry, make to ozone change\nduring the summer and winter seasons. These three contributions are approximately in balance at each \xe2\x80\x9cgrid\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n2.50\n\n30\n\nmb\n\nr\n0\nl\n5\n\n30\n\n-1\n\n-\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-3\n\n-\n\n-5\n\n-\n\n-6\n\n-\n\n-a\n\nmb\n\n-\n\nI\n65N\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n60N\n\n55N\n\n50N\n\n45N\n\n40N\n\n35N\n\nI\n30N\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9825N\n\n20N\n\nLatitude\nFigure 526.\n\nMeridional ozone transport by eddies (upper) and by the mean\nmeridional winds (lower) derived from BUV ozone data and\nrawinsonde winds (Miller et al., 1977).\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n251\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nI-\n\nD-\n\nI\n\n.\n\nI\n\nIOC.\xe2\x80\x99\n20\n\n80\n\nLATITUDE\nFigure 527.\n\nCross section of zonally averaged q,\nmeridional transport of ozone by geostrophic eddy motions, for\n1 November 1975.

(This model utilized a diffusion coefficient of 102cm2/sec in the lower stratosphere). Figure 5-31\nshows a net chemical production of ozone in the lower stratosphere between approximately 20 and 35 km\naltitude, centered in tropical regions of the summer hemisphere. At these heights, ozone is chemically\ndestroyed at high latitudes, particularly in the winter hemisphere. Between approximately 25 km and 45 km in\nthis model calculation, horizontal advection by eddies is primarily responsible for counterbalancing the net\nchemical production and loss of ozone as shown in figure 5-31, transporting ozone away from the source\nregion in tropical latitudes and toward the weakly illuminated destruction region at high latitudes.\nBy comparing figures 5-29, 5-30 and 5-3 1, one can identify the dominant terms in the ozone continuity equation in each of the three zones identified in figure 5-24. In the dynamically controlled region (lower\nstratosphere), there is a near balance between zonal mean transport and horizontal eddy transport. At these\nlevels, the transport of air parcels containing ozone is associated with a time scale which is much shorter than\nthat for ozone changes within the parcel due to photochemistry. Thus, ozone acts as an almost inert tracer in\nthe lower stratosphere. Its behavior should be similar to that of other essentially inert tracers (with a source in\nthe stratosphere) and to isentropic potential vorticity. This relationship has been noted observationally by\nHering (1966) for larger scale features over North America and by Danielsen (1968) and Danielsen et al.\n(1970) in their studies of tropopause folding events. Hartmann (1977) has used potential vorticity as a proxy\nto study tracer movements in the Southern Hemisphere stratosphere.\nIt has been demonstrated by Boyd (1976) and Andrews and McIntyre (1976a and b) and others that waves\npropagating into the stratosphere under idealistic conditions do not affect the zonal flow, and that, in fact, a\nwave induces a meridional circulation which just cancels its effect. It is only as a result of dissipative processes\nand wave transience that net transport in the lower stratosphere is produced. These conclusions also apply to\nan almost inert tracer (Mahlman et al, 1979). The cancellation between the contribution of eddies and mean\ncirculation to ozone change seen in the lower stratosphere in figure 5-30 is not surprising and has been noted\nin previous three-dimensional model studies of ozone and in the observations cited earlier (Hunt and Manabe,\n1968; and Mahlman, 1976).\nThe dissipative processes responsible for destroying ozone variations are chemistry (the production of\ntropospheric ozone from NO, as first suggested by Chameides and Walker (1973) is not included in this\nmodel), downscale transport of energy and ozone (represented by a vertical diffusion coefficient of\n102cm2/sec in the lower stratosphere in this model) and surface destruction.\nBecause of the approximate balance between mean and eddy processes, conclusions concerning net ozone\ntransport in the lower stratosphere and troposphere may require that dissipative processes be represented in a\nphysically meaningful manner. For example, Mahlman et al. (1979), in their 3-dimensional model, produced\na stronger-than-observed downward slope of mixing ratio surfaces at mid-latitudes. This was attributed to a\nneglect of chemistry in the lower stratosphere. However, numerical model studies of tracer transport should\nprovide some insight into the trajectories of air parcels in the lower stratosphere and, to the extent to which\nwave transience is responsible for net transport, should also contribute to an understanding of the ozone\nbudget. Mahlman et al. (1979) have found, for example, that wave transience is particularly important for\ntransport at midlatitudes in winter. Mahlman and Moxim (1978) found in their tracer studies that the mean\nand eddy cancellation for tracer change in the lower stratosphere is particularly incomplete during the spring\nas planetary scale disturbances weaken, and is weak when the zonal mean flow in the stratosphere is weak,\nThey attribute the latter effect to the absorption of planetary waves (and, hence alteration of the mean flow)\nat singular lines on which speed of the mean flow equals the phase speed of a planetary wave. It is also known\nfrom observations that large net transports of ozone occur during sudden warmings in the Northern\nHemisphere. Much more study is needed on the ability of models to simulate wave transience, and on the effect of various representations of the dissipative processes on transport by wave motions.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n257\n\nThe budget of ozone below 10 mb may be calculated by integrating the ozone continuity equation horizontally\nto obtain the budget of global mean ozone. The model then predicts a net production of ozone exists between\n20 and 25 km, amounting to approximately 12 tons/set. This chemically-produced ozone is transported vertically downward by the large scale eddies as shown by the model calculation in figure 5-32. Observations\n(e.g., Fabian and Pruchniewicz, 1977) indicate that, in fact, approximately 25 tons/set are transported\nthrough the tropopause to be destroyed at the ground. Both observations (e.g., Danielson et al., 1970) and\nmodel calculations (e.g., Mahlman and Moxim, 1978, and Kida, 1977a and 1977b) indicate that much of this\ntransfer occurs at midlatitudes in association with the jet stream, particularly in the spring. Stratospheric air\nmay be injected into the troposphere (in a partially irreversible process) to the north of the jet stream by an induced direct circulation, and to the west of extra-tropical cyclones in the upper troposphere (Mahlman and\nMoxim, 1978). Additional evidence for these ideas is provided by the observed distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere (Fabian and Pruchniewicz, 1977) which exhibits a substantial maximum at mid-latitudes in\nthe spring. This transfer is incompletely resolved in current stratospheric models (e.g., Mahlman and Moxim,\n1978). A more extensive discussion of stratosphere-troposphere exchange is presented later in this chapter.\nIn the transition region where chemistry and dynamics are equally important, which is between the dotted\nlines in figure 5-24, there is a near balance between horizontal eddy transport and photochemical sources and\nsinks. This balance between eddy transport and zonal-mean photochemical disequilibrium in this model is\nconsistent with conclusions derived from the mechanistic model of Hartmann and Garcia (1979). The probable importance of the transports produced in the transition region can be estimated by comparing the\nphotochemical disequilibrium which they produce in middle latitudes (shown in figure 5-31) with the production of odd oxygen by 0, dissociation shown in figure 5-24. Near the bottom of the transition region the\nchemical disequilibrium is of the same magnitude as the total of the oxygen production, so that a large deviation from the photochemical equilibrium concentration in the transition zone is possible. More work is required to evaluate how the details of the transition zone interaction affect the total ozone column of the atmosphere.\nCalculated and observed meridional cross sections of ozone mixing ratios in the upper stratosphere can be\ncompared in figure 5-33. It is seen in both cross sections that the ozone mixing ratio increases with latitude, up\nto approximately 60\xe2\x80\x9d latitude, in the winter hemisphere between 1 and 2 mb. Although the model predictions\nat latitudes higher than 60\xe2\x80\x9d in winter have yet to be verified, it can be surmised, from figures 5-24, 5-29, and\n5-31, that this gradient appears to be defined by chemistry. However, there are limitations of this model (e.g.,\nthe cold pole temperatures) which suggest the need for further studies of the origins of this maximum. The\nanalyses of satellite data by London et al. (1976a) show a tendency toward an increase of ozone with latitude\nat these levels in the winter hemisphere, but no marked peak is observed. Thus, at this time, the observed high\nlatitude winter maximum at 1-2 mb is not completely understood; since NO,, HO,, Ox, and ClO, all contribute to the ozone balance at this level, and species which sequester radicals (e.g., GINO,) are likely to have\ntheir maximum effect at high latitudes in winter. The complete explanation of this local maximum will probably have to await additional knowledge of the chemistry.\nThe budget of columnar ozone is evaluated by performing a vertical integration of the data in figures 5-29,\n5-30, and 5-31. Figure 5-34 shows that columnar ozone is chemically produced at tropical latitudes of the\nwinter hemisphere and at both tropical and midlatitudes of the summer hemisphere. It is chemically destroyed\nat high latitudes, with much of the destruction occurring in the winter hemisphere. Ozone is transported\nacross the Equator from the summer to the winter hemisphere by the mean circulation and hence poleward by\nthe midlatitude eddies. There is a small poleward transport by the midlatitude eddies in the summer\nhemisphere. At latitudes greater than 60\xe2\x80\x9d the decay of ozone from the spring maximum, which occurs over\nthe course of the summer, appears to result from chemical and surface destruction of ozone (substantially offset by the transport of ozone from lower latitudes). At latitudes less than 40\xe2\x80\x9d the decay of ozone from the\nspring maximum may be produced by a transport of ozone into the winter hemisphere (Cunnold et al., private\ncommunciation).\n\nI llllll\n\n258\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n70\n\n0.05\n\nUPWARD FLUX\nOF OZONE\n0. 1\n\nRUN\nAVERAGE\n\n17\nFOR YEAR\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\n60\nI\n\n0.5\n\nI\n\xe2\x80\x98\\ DIFFUSION\n\n50\n\nI\n\n2\n\nADVECTION\n\n1000 L\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\nFLUX\nFigure 532.\n\n0\n\nIO\n\n20\n\n30\n\n(TON/SEC)\n\nThe calculated global-annual-mean vertical ozone fluxes resulting from planetary waves\nand diffusion (Cunnold et al., 1979).\n\n259\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nJUNE\n80N\n1\n\n0.05\n\n60N\nI\n\nI\n\n40N\nI\n\nI\n\n20N\nT-I\n\n17, 1970\n0\n\nI,\n\n1\n\n40s\n1\n\n20s\nI,\n\n60s\nI\n\nI\n\n80s\nI\n\nI\n\n70\n\n0.1\n0.2\n\n60\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1 .o-\n\n50\n\n2.040\n\nZ\n5\n\n5.0-\n\n:\n\nlo-\n\n;\n)j\na\n\n30\n\n2050100\n\nE\nl5\nii\nI\n\n20\n-I\n\n200\n\n10\n\n500\n1000~\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\nEON\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n60N\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n40N\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n20N\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n20s\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n40s\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n60s\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n80s\n\n0\n\nLATITUDE\nSUMMER\n0,05-\n\nEON\nI\n\n60N\n1\nI\n\n8\n\nWINTER\n40N\n8\n\nI\n\n20N\n8\n\nI\n\n0\n1\n\nI\n\n20s\nI\n\nI\n\n40s\nI\n\nI\n\n60s\n1\n\n1\n\n80s\nI\n\n- 70\n\n0.1 0.2 -\n\n- 60\n\n0.51 .o2.0\nz\n8\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\n\n50-\n\n1000\n\nI\nEON\n\nI!\n\n*\n60N\n\nI\n40N\n\nI\n\nI\n20N\n\nI\n\nI,\n0\n\nI,\n20s\n\nI\n40s\n\nI,\n\n1,\n60s\n\n80s\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLATITUDE\n\nFigure 5-33.\n\nCalculated ozone mass mixing ratios (pgm/gm) (Cunnold et al., 1979) (lower figure)\ncompared against BUV observations by Krueger et al.

It may be noted that for total ozone, Hilsenrath et al. (1979a) have found\nthat 90% of the variance of the zonal mean total ozone is in the annual wave except in the tropics, and\nperhaps at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Differences between the ozone distributions in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are clearly indicated in figure 5-23 and are supported by the satellite data.\nThe smaller annual columnar ozone maximum and the l-month phase delay in the occurrence of this maximum at polar latitudes seem to be a well established feature of the Southern Hemisphere as shown by\nHilsenrath et al. (1979a). These differences, compared with the Northern Hemisphere, are almost certainly\nrelated to the dynamical differences between the two hemispheres (see, for example, Newell et al., 1974).\nWintertime flow is more zonal in the Southern Hemisphere, and the planetary wave amplitudes are generally\nweaker. However, more observations in the middle and upper stratosphere, which should be forthcoming\nfrom the satellites, will better define these interhemispheric differences in ozone.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n261\n\nSOLAR-STRATOSPHERIC RELATIONS\nBackground\nVariations in extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun account for most of the observed variations in the\nstructure of the thermosphere. Particle-induced radiations, in addition, can account for significant high\nlatitude effects in the upper atmosphere. However, it has been difficult to demonstrate changes in\ntropospheric weather which might be directly related to variations in solar output. In the middle atmosphere,\nparticularly in the stratosphere, it has been postulated that variations in the solar ultraviolet irradiance (in the\nspectrai region absorbed by ozone) or in solar particle output may significantly and systematically perturb the\nstratosphere. Any relevant evidence of solar-related stratospheric variations is of considerable interest, not\nonly for evaluating stratospheric trends of other origin, but also because of the possibility that variations in\nthe zonal mean state of the stratosphere may influence weather and/or climatic processes in the troposphere\n(Bates, 1977). Several mechanisms possibly leading to solar-related stratospheric variations and some observations of such variations are considered in the following paragraphs.\n\nPossible Mechanisms\nThe possible mechanisms leading to solar-related stratospheric variations include:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nAppreciable variation of UV flux at wavelengths affecting ozone. Heath and Thekaekara (1977) infer a\nsolar cycle dependent flux at wavelengths between 175 and 310 nms from a series of rocket and satellite\nexperiments between 1966 and 1976. Callis and Nealy (1978) and Penner and Chang (1978) have made\nmodel calculations incorporating UV variations based on these observations, which indicate significant\neffects on stratospheric ozone and temperature. Their results and comparison with observations will be\ndiscussed below. On the other hand, there are some doubts about the reality of the UV variations inferred by Heath and Thekaekara because of observational uncertainties. Solar UV variations are discussed\nin Chapter 7.\nSolar proton deposition in events associated with disturbed solar conditions, leading to an increased\nproduction of NO, compounds in the stratosphere, affecting, in turn, the ozone budget (e.g., Crutzen et\nal., 1975).\nRelativistic electron precipitation events involving plasma interactions in the magnetosphere, where\nelectrons precipitate to stratospheric depths (characteristic penetration depths *have been given by\nThorne, 1977).\nModulation of cosmic rays by solar activity, leading to stratospheric modulation\ning ozone (Ruderman and Chamberlain, 1975; and Chamberlain, 1977).\n\nof NO,, in turn affect-\n\nEvidence of Solar-Related Stratospheric Variations\nShort-term effects include variations in ozone, temperature, and wind. A depletion of ozone during a solar\nproton polar cap absorption (pea) event was first observed in the mesosphere by Weeks et al. (1972). More\nrecently, a 20 percent depletion above the 4-mb level (38 km) was observed during the pea event of August\n1972 (figure 5-35, Heath et al., 1977), which was found to be consistent with the process described in the second mechanism above. Most remarkable was the persistence of this effect, the ozone depletion having been\nmaintained long after the termination of the responsible source. The observed high-latitude depletion was attributed to production of odd nitrogen through proton bombardment. Rocket data evidence for ozone depletions during aurora1 X-ray events has been reported by Goldberg (1979). These data show a 25 percent reduction of ozone above 1 mb in figure 5-36 (Hilsenrath, private communication) following each of two night-time\n\nI-\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE : PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n262\n\n5\xe2\x80\x99S-5\xe2\x80\x99N\n\n.02 1\nt\n\n,009 -180 185 190 195200205210215\n\n220225230235240245\n\n250\n\nDAY NO., 1972\n\nFigure 5-35.\n\nDaily zonally averaged total ozone (Nimbus-4 BUV experiment) above 4 mb pressure\nlevel (about 38 km) for equatorial (top panel), middle (middle), and high (bottom)\nlatitudes during July and August 1972.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nAUROROZONE\n\n263\n\nI, POKER FLAT, ALASKA,\nSEPTEMBER 1976\n\n65.\n\n60\n\n55\n5\niz\n2\n\n50\n\n5\n\na\n\n45\n\n40\n\n--\n\n.\n\nHILSENRATH\n(g/21/76, 14032)\n(9125176, 07562)\nRANDHAWA\n(9123176, 13272)\n9123176, 09532)\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0.2\n\n35\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\xe2\x80\x99 OZONE DEPLETION RATIO\n(DISTURBED/QUIET)\nFigure 536.\n\nI-\n\nRatio of nighttime vertical ozone distributions comparing post-aurora1 disturbance values\nto quiet time profiles preceding each event.

The ozone changes were observed again in two additional soundings performed\nduring March, 1978, under similar conditions. However, Schoeberl and Strobe1 have shown that sizable as\nthis effect is locally, its geophysical extent is too limited to affect global stratospheric dynamics directly.\nIn the mesosphere, there is evidence that temperature changes occur following geomagnetic storms\n(Ramakrishna and Seshamani, 1976). Finally, Reiter (1979) reports that troposphere-stratosphere exchanges\nare enhanced following solar flares. The importance of troposphere-stratosphere exchange in the chemical\nbudget of the stratosphere is discussed in a later section.\nSolar influences on the stratospheric circulation have been studied in terms of the solar rotation period (27\ndays). Ebel and Batz (1977) report statistically significant coherency values at both 27 and 13.5 day periods\nfrom cross-spectral analysis of the 10.7 cm solar radio flux and daily 10 mb height values. In the upper\nstratosphere, Nastrom and Belmont (1978) used a similar analysis technique to study the relationship between\nsolar flux variations and zonal wind speed at 30-60 km. The amplitude of the zonal wind speed variations during winter (figure 5-37) shows two centers of maximum, near 50\xe2\x80\x9dN and 25 \xe2\x80\x9cN above 50 km. The phases (times\nof maximum eastward speed) at these two centers differ by about 13.5 days (i.e., 180 degrees). These coherency studies indicate that there exists some connection between 10.7 cm flux and stratospheric circulation than if\nthere were independent fluctuations in these parameters with the same period as Volland and Shaeffer (1979)\nclaim.\n\nI,\nN80\n\nFigure 5-37.\n\nran_\n70\n\nAmplitude (ms -\xe2\x80\x99 ) of\n27.1 days.

Most recently, Quiroz (1979a) has presented results\n(figure 5-38) which showed an overall temperature variation in the upper stratosphere of about 4K during\nsolar cycle 20, with an overall coefficient of correlation near + 0.9 between combined temperature data from\nseven rocketsonde stations (8\xe2\x80\x9ds - 64\xe2\x80\x9dN) and annual sunspot number. The variation appears fairly uniform\namong the stations, except at 50 km, where Poker Flat (64\xe2\x80\x9dN) and Ascension (8 \xe2\x80\x9cS) show strong differences.\nThe temperature range reported is within the model calculations mentioned in the first mechanism involving\nvariations in UV radiation.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nr\n\nFigure 538.\n\n,\n\n_.e.---.\n\n\\\n\n265\n\n- +2\n\nMean summertime temperature departure from long-period average (3-year running averages)\ncompared with sunspot number (dashed lines) (Quiroz, 1979a).\n\nLong-term variation of stratospheric ozone over a solar cycle has been seen from statistical studies based on\ndata from the global network of ground based Dobson stations (Angel1 and Korshover, 1973 and 1978d). The\nresults are controversial, in part because of absolute and intercalibration errors among stations and gaps in\ndata acquisition. The interpretation is confused by the fact that total ozone (Dobson) measurements are\ndominated by the maximum density of ozone found below about 25 km altitude. In this height regime, the\nresidence time of atmospheric ozone is about two years, and its distribution and concentration are controlled\nby transport processes.\nPenner and Chang (1978) using a one-dimensional model which includes major feedback mechanisms and\nchemical time delays showed that ozone changes would result from an eleven-year variation in the solar\nultraviolet flux. Their calculated variation over a solar cycle is consistent with the analysis of total ozone data\nby Angel1 and Korshover (1978d). However, the agreement of their calculations above 30 km with Umkehr\ndata was less satisfactory. The most recent calculations by Callis et al. (1979) using a time dependent\nradiative-convective-photochemical\nmodel also shows an ozone response to solar cycle variations in the\nultraviolet. These calculations seem to produce ozone variations more consistent with the observations above\n30 km. Both of these models produce temperature changes in the stratosphere consistent with the Quiroz\n(1979a) and Angel1 and Korshover (1978c) analyses of rocketsonde data. Both model calculations use solar\nultraviolet variations as observed by Heath and Thekaekara (1977). The observations are still controversial,\nand there is an obvious need for regular and accurate observations of the solar ultraviolet flux. Further\ndiscussion of long-term ozone variations appear in Chapter 6.\n\nIIll I\n\nII\n\nI\n\n266\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nFinal Remarks\nThere are numerous studies which show that an atmospheric response is consistent with solar variability.\nHowever, in most cases the observations used to show solar cycle relationships are taken over one solar cycle.\nPittock\xe2\x80\x99s critical review of solar weather relationships (1978) points out several guidelines for interpreting\nsolar related phenomena which are applicable to the stratosphere.\nThe evidence discussed for solar-related stratospheric variations is provocative, but not conclusive. Solar\nresponse at various time-scales does not appear implausible in the context of the mechanisms listed. However,\nit is evident that much work remains, including the development of an improved body of ultraviolet observations, in order to rigorously define solar relations in the middle atmosphere.\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC TROPOSPHERIC INTERACTIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section will consider the mass and chemical exchange, energy transfers, and electrical coupling between\nthe stratosphere and the troposphere. The various meteorological processes responsible for the direct exchange of air and its associated chemical constituents across the tropopause are discussed. The dynamical\ncoupling process that takes place through vertically propagating waves and the mean motions is then considered. The exchange of radiative energy across the tropopause is discussed. And finally, consideration is\ngiven to aspects of electrical coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere.\n\nMASS EXCHANGE PROCESSES\nBackground\nThe current research on stratospheric-tropospheric\nexchange processes is motivated, in part, by the awareness\nthat the transport of anthropogenic and natural chemical constituents across the tropopause may bring about\nsignificant changes in the radiative and chemical budget of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. These exchange processes\nare those arising from 1) mean meridional circulations, 2) seasonal variations in the height and potential\ntemperature of the tropopause, 3) radiative cooling at the tropopause above jet stream and cumulonimbus cirrus clouds, 4) transverse mass circulation about subtropical and polar front jet stream systems, 5) vertical exchange during tropopause folding events within extratropical cyclones, 6) cumulonimbus clouds which\npenetrate the tropopause, 7) turbulent mixing processes in the vicinity of jet stream tropopause folding\nevents, and 8) weak eddy diffusion across the vast quiescent expanses of the tropopause. This section\ndiscusses recent results which add to our understanding of tropospheric-stratospheric\nexchange by processes\nl), 5), 6), and 7). The reader is referred to the review by Reiter (1975) for a comprehensive discussion of\nstratospheric-tropospheric\nexchange processes.\n\nDefinition of the Tropopause\nThe interface between the stratosphere and troposphere (the tropopause) was previously defined solely in\nterms of the discontinuity in the vertical lapse rate of temperature. This thermal definition of the tropopause\nhas been replaced by Reed\xe2\x80\x99s (1955) concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cdynamical\xe2\x80\x9d\ntropopause based on potential vorticity. The\ndynamical tropopause is situated at the near-zero-order discontinuity in potential vorticity that separates the\nlow values of that quantity in the troposphere from the values one to two orders of magnitude higher, which\ntypify the stratosphere. Figures 5-39a and 5-39b present a cross section analysis from Shapiro (1974) in which\nthe stratosphere is separated from the troposphere by the discontinuity in potential vorticity situated near the\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n1\no-\n\no-\n\nIO -\n\n10 -\n\nIO -\n\n,o ,O20 ,oGJT/476\n\nFigure 5-39a.\n\nFigure 5-39b.\n\nNCAR\n\nCross section of potential temperature and wind speed. lsentropes (K), solid lines; isotachs\n(m set-\xe2\x80\x98), heavy dashed lines.

In addition, figure 5-39b includes the ozone\nconcentration distribution which takes the same configuration as potential vorticity in the vicinity of the\ndynamical tropopause.\nPotential vorticity, P, is the vorticity (rotational tendency about a vertical axis) of an air parcel (le + f), times\nits thermal stability, -ae/ap as evaluated on surfaces of constant potential temperature, 0\nP = - (To + f) ae/C?p\nco = a_v - au\n\nax\n\nay\n\nwhere u and v are the horizontal air velocity components in the west-east (x) and south-north (y) directions,\nrespectively; and f = 20sind is the vorticity associated with the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation, Q, as a function of latitude,\n4 . If one neglects as second order effects the contributions by diabatic and turbulent mixing processes, potential vorticity is nearly conserved along three-dimensional air parcel trajectories. It should be noted that\nbecause of the difference in stratospheric versus tropospheric potential vorticity, potential vorticity generation and destruction processes are essential to the exchange of air and chemical constituents between the\nstratosphere and troposphere.\n\nExchange by Lagrangian Mean Motions\nThe traditional diagnosis of mean mass exchange across the tropopause separates the motions into zonal\nmean meridional and eddy transport motions (Oort and Rasmussen, 1971). The resulting picture of the mean\nmeridional circulation contains the thermally direct Hadley cell of the tropical and subtropical latitudes, the\nindirect Ferrel cell of middle latitudes, and the direct polar cell. The Eulerian concept of the general circulation, based upon point averages of the mean motions, which leads to the three cells mentioned above, is found\nto be difficult to reconcile with the chemical tracer circulation motions proposed by Brewer (1949) and Dobson (195 1). In contrast to the Eulerian three-cell mean circulation, the Brewer-Dobson circulation, figure 5-40\n(upper) contains a single direct Hadley cell, extending from Equator to pole, which defines the Lagrangian\n(parcel trajectory) mean motions. Implicit within the Lagrangian mean motions are the contribution by the\neddy motions, which are predominant in middle latitudes. It should be noted, as discussed by Wallace\n(1978b), that the Stokes drift induced by\xe2\x80\x99the eddy motions in middle latitudes, when added to the Eulerian\nmean circulation, acts to counteract the effect of the indirect Ferrel cell of middle latitudes.\nThe resulting Lagrangian mean circulation, (the heavy arrows of figure 5-40, lower), is quite similar to the\nfigure 5-40 (upper) Brewer-Dobson circulation. The individual contributions to the Lagrangian mean circulation schematically entered into figure 5-40 (lower) illustrates the complex processes which force the\nLagrangian mean circulation.\nA possible mechanism for the exchange of air between the troposphere and the stratosphere by the mean\nLagrangian motion may be inferred from the circulation shown in figure 5-40. The ascending branch of the\ncirculation in the equatorial tropics transports tropospheric air to the Dobson-Brewer \xe2\x80\x9ccold trap\xe2\x80\x9d for water\nvapor at the tropical tropopause, where the low water vapor saturation mixing ratio air and tropospheric trace\nconstituents are incorporated into the tropical stratosphere. The northward moving motion of the circulation\ntranports ozone from the upper-stratospheric tropical ozone production region toward the middle and high\nlatitudes, where the descending branch of the circulation deposits the ozone into the ozone reservoir above the\npolar tropopause. Further sinking motions subsequently transport ozone-rich air into the extratropical\ntroposphere.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\n269\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n300\nLATITUDE\n\n601~\n\nIlPlanetarv waves I I\n\n65C\n.--LATITUDE\nFigure 540.\n\n(Upper) The Brewer-Dobson\nthe tropopause.\n\nmodel of the mean meridional\n\ncirculation.\n\nHeavy lines denote\n\n(Lower) Langrangian mean meridional circulation, heavy arrows, from the numerical\nsimulation of Kida (1977), showing contributions by the Hadley cell, extratropical\ncyclones; jet streams, J; ptanetary waves, and small-scale motions (thin lines).\nBoth figures are presented in Wallace (1978a).\n\nRecent examples of Eulerian versus Lagrangian mean circulations are found in the numerical studies of Kida\n(1977) and Dunkerton (1978). These studies and the theoretical formulations of the Lagrangian motion concept by Andrews and McIntyre (1976a,b) suggest that it is useful to view the general circulation-scale exchange of air and trace constituents between the troposphere and the stratosphere in terms of the mean\nLagrangian motions.\n\nExchange by Extratropical Cyclonic and Jet Stream Systems\nThe transport of potential vorticity, ozone, and radioactive particles from stratospheric to tropospheric levels\nthrough tropopause folding within the synoptic-scale (- 4000 km) eddies of middle latitudes has been investigated by Reed (1955), Reed and Danielsen (1959), and Danielsen (1964), Staley (1960), and Shapiro\n(1974, 1976, 1978). It should be stressed that tropopause folding is not, in itself, evidence for stratospherictropospheric exchange. In the absence of diabatic and turbulent mixing processes, potential vorticity is conserved and tropopause folding is a reversible process, i.e., the stratospheric extrusion that occurs within the\n\n270\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nsubsiding northwesterly flow of extratropical cyclones is retracted back into the stratosphere in the ascending\nsouthwesterly flow in advance of the cyclonic disturbances. Measurements made from research aircraft by\nKennedy and Shapiro (1975), and Shapiro (1976, 1978) quantitatively documented the magnitude of the\npotential vorticity altering turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum associated with CAT within tropopause\nfolds. They also established the first-order importance of CAT in the free exchange of air and chemical constituents across the potential vorticity discontinuity of the tropopause.\nRecent observations from Shapiro (1979) give evidence that tropopause folds are mixing regions for chemical\nconstitutents. This is illustrated in figures 5-41a, 5-41b, and 5-41~ which present the meteorological, ozone,\nand condensation nuclei distributions, respectively, for a pronounced example of tropopause folding. Figures\n5-41a and 5-41b reveal that the air within the fold contained both stratospheric levels of ozone and\ntropospheric concentrations of condensation nuclei. Figure 5-42 shows the turbulent fluxes of ozone and condensation nuclei for the upper and lower portion of this fold, which permitted the evaluation of the\nmagnitude of vertical turbulent flux divergence as a mechanism for altering chemical concentrations within\nthe fold. The calculations indicate a vertical flux divergence of ozone out of the fold, with a simultaneous flux\nconvergence of tropospheric condensation nuclei into the fold. Cadle et al., (1979) presented evidence from\naircraft measurements showing tropospheric concentrations of condensation nuclei within the stratosphere in\nthe vicinity of an upper-level jet stream system. Therefore, the recent measurements from research aircraft\nsuggest that small-scale turbulent mixing processes within tropopause folds act to entrain tropospheric\nchemical constituents into the stratosphere, while stratospheric ozone is simultaneously expelled into the\ntroposphere.\n\nExchange by Convective Cloud Systems\nThe traveling synoptic disturbances of the InterTropical\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ) contain organized\nmesoscale convection systems within which are imbedded the \xe2\x80\x9chot tower\xe2\x80\x9d cumulonimbus clouds first\ndescribed by Riehl and Malkus (1958). The penetration of the tropical tropopause by these convection systems\ncan lead to a vertical exchange between the stratosphere and troposphere. Houze et al. (1977) and Riehl(1977)\npresent further evidence that less than 1Vo of the equatorial convective systems reach altitudes near the 16 km\ntropical tropopause. Thus, only a small percentage of the total tropical convection participates in the direct\nexchange process.\nThe role of deep tropical convection is to transport lower tropospheric constituents to the layer just below the\ntropical tropopause; from there the much weaker upward motion of the mean circulation performs the final\ncross-tropopause transport into the stratosphere. An example of tropopause-penetrating\ncumulonimbus\nclouds in extratropical latitudes is presented in Shenk (1974). The relative importance of tropical versus extratropical convective systems as exchange mechanisms is not clearly established at this time.\n\nDiscussion of Mass Exchange\nA common factor among exchange mechanisms is the role of non-conserving potential vorticity processes as a\nrequirement for stratospheric-tropospheric\nexchange. These potential vorticity altering processes range in\nspace-time scale from the differential diabatic heating by the Sun, which forces the mean meridional circulation and provides the energy for the extratropical baroclinic waves with their associated tropopause folds,\ndown to the diabatic heating within mesoconvective cloud systems and the turbulent mixing in the vicinity of\njet stream-frontal zone tropopause folding systems. From the meteorological point of view, it is the contributions by mesoconvective and turbulent-scale motions to the total exchange process that are the most difficult\nto assess.\n\nMETEOROLOGY\n\nFigure 541a.\n\nFigure 5-41b.\n\nOF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nCross section through the 0000 GMT 13 March 1978 tropopause folding event.

Nastrom (1977)\ndocumented the average ozone concentration and estimated the downward flux of ozone near the tropopause\nfor the latitudinal belt 30N to 50N from an extensive ozone data set taken from the GASP program.\nHowever, these estimates are not repeated in this report, since it appears that the spatial and temporal contributions by exchange components smaller in scale than the mean and seasonal components have not been\nsufficiently observed to warrant quantitative evaluation.\nIn the absence of global measurements of the individual exchange components, estimates have been obtained\nof the total mass exchange and downward ozone flux across the tropopause by using global general circulation models to simulate the three-dimensional air motion trajectories and exchange processes. These models\ninclude parameterizations for sub grid-scale motions and physical processes which are not explicitly resolved\nby the grid resolution of the models. Results from such experiments are found in the tracer studies of\nMahlman et al. (1979) and the dynamical-chemical atmospheric model of Cunnold et al. (1975). The total\ndownward ozone flux estimates at the tropopause from the GFDL (Mahlman et al., 1979) and NCAR (Gidel\nand Shapiro, 1979) general circulation models have addressed the question of the asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheric tropospheric concentrations described by Fishman and Crutzen (1978).\n\nFinal Remarks\nThe current understanding of the specific meteorological processes responsible for the exchange of air and\nchemical constituents between the stratosphere and troposphere has been discussed in this section. What is\nunclear, at present, is the magnitude and relative importance of the individual components that make up the\ntotal exchange across the tropopause. For example, it is essential to determine the amount of air that enters\nthe stratosphere in equatorial regions through the mean and small-scale motions, as compared to the amount\nwhich enters via turbulent entrainment within middle and high-latitude tropopause folds, as well as return\nflow on the anticyclonic side of the jet. The impact of observed interhemispheric and latitudinal differences in\nanthropogenic sources of tropospheric chemical constituents upon the chemistry and energetics of the\nstratosphere is dependent in part upon the location of chemical source regions relative to the location of the\nmajor meteorological exchange processes. Furthermore, tropospheric chemical characteristics such as the\nobserved larger amount of ozone in the Northern versus the Southern Hemisphere troposphere require the\ndetermination of the relative contributions by hemispheric asymmetry in in situ photochemical production\n(Fishman and Crutzen, 1978) and suggested hemispheric differences in the intensity of stratosphere to\ntroposphere ozone transport (Gidel and Shapiro, 1979).\nIt remains for future coordinated research efforts to obtain simultaneous observations of the meteorological\nand chemical properties in the vicinity of the tropopause on scales ranging from the global to the mesoscale\nand turbulent scale, in order to arrive at quantitative evaluations for the individual exchange processes. Such\nefforts wiil require the use of satellite, conventional ground-based, and research aircraft measurements in\nconjunction with modeling efforts. Exchange processes coupled with our understanding of atmospheric\nchemical processes, would provide the basis for a new synthesis of the combined physical-chemical evolution\nof both the stratosphere and the troposphere.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE : PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n214\n\nDYNAMICAL\n\nCOUPLING\n\nBackground\nWhereas the previous discussion related to direct mass exchange, dynamical coupling deals with transports of\nphysical quantities such as momentum and/or energy where no net mass exchange is necessarily involved. As\nin the discussion of mass exchange, both upward and downward interaction need to be considered.\n\nMechanisms\nThe role of tropospheric forcing of the stratospheric circulation is well appreciated. The mean meridional\ntropospheric motions that are forced by the differential heating of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface are known to penetrate\nwell into the lower stratosphere (Vincent, 1968). The extratropical planetary waves that exist as a consequence\nof surface airflow over continental topography and of the continent-ocean thermal differences are observed\nto penetrate upwards at least into the mesosphere (Green, 1972). Also, enhancements in the tropospheric\nplanetary waves are crucial to present theories of stratospheric warmings (Matsuno, 1971, and Tung and\nLindzen, 1979). The tropical waves that are believed to force the quasi-biennial oscillation in the lower\ntropical stratosphere (Holton and Lindzen, 1972), and to play a large role in forcing the semi-annual oscillation in the middle and upper tropical stratosphere (Hirota, 1978), are thought to be forced by tropical convective systems (Holton, 1972).\nRecently, however, the concept that changes in the stratospheric circulation can significantly affect the\ntroposphere has been examined more closely. Hines (1974) suggested one possible mechanism by which this\nmight take place. The basis of this mechanism is that tropospherically forced planetary waves propagate their\nenergy upward, where the stratospheric and mesospheric winds play a dominant role in determining the\n\xe2\x80\x9crefractive index\xe2\x80\x9d for these waves (see Charney, 1961; Matsuno, 1970; and Schoeberl and Geller, 1976)\nwhich then determines the transmission-reflection\nproperties of the waves. Thus, changes in the middle atmosphere flow might iead to changes in tropospheric planetary wave amplitudes and phases. Some of the relevant dynamical model studies that relate to this mechanism are those of Bates (1977), Schoeberl and Strobe1\n(1978a, b), and Mahlman et al. (1978). Both the approaches and the results of these latter studies differ with\nBates (1977) which indicated that changes in the stratospheric mean zonal wind and/or temperature structure\nproduced large changes in tropospheric planetary wave structure and the resulting heat flux. Bates\xe2\x80\x99 (1977)\nresult was obtained analytically using a model which required a number of simplifying assumptions and\nresulted in a one-dimensional vertical structure equation. Schoeberl and Strobe1 (1978a,b) and Mahlman et al.\n(1978), using more complete dynamical formulations, did not find so marked tropospheric effects. Tung and\nLindzen (1979) have indicated that in order for changes in the stratospheric mean flow to significantly affect\ntropospheric planetary waves, such changes must take place below the middle stratosphere where dissipative\nprocesses are relatively small. This conclusion is also supported by recent calculations of Geller and Alpert\n(private communication).\nRamanathan (1977) has suggested a combined dynamical-radiative stratospheric-tropospheric\ncoupling process that may be important. He suggested that during a stratospheric warming, the warm high latitude\nstratosphere emits a sufficiently enhanced amount of infrared radiation so as to significantly decrease the\npole-to-Equator temperature gradient in the troposphere, thus decreasing the tropospheric available potential\nenergy. Observational studies indicate downward dynamical coupling from the stratosphere. Quiroz (1978)\nhas shown that the circulation reversal that accompanied the 1976-77 stratospheric warming was observed to\npenetrate down to ground level.\nIn summary, the idea that tropospheric dynamics affect stratospheric dynamics has been around for at least\ntwenty years, and is by now a well-accepted concept. A new concept that has emerged in the last five years is\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n27.5\n\nthat under some conditions, the coupling in the opposite direction can be significant. This subject is much\nmore speculative, but with present and future theoretical work taken together with further joint analysis of\nstratospheric and tropospheric data, rapid progress in our understanding should be forthcoming.\n\nRADIATIVE COUPLING\nBackground\nThe stratosphere and troposphere interact not only by exchange of mass and mechanical energy, but also by\ntransfer of radiant energy across the tropopause. It is largely through this coupling that changes in the\nstratosphere may affect tropospheric climatology, while the upwelling radiative flux from the troposphere\nplays a very important role in the meteorology of the stratosphere.\nThe stratosphere receives shortwave radiation reflected from the surface, clouds and tropospheric aerosols,\nand long wave radiation emitted by all of these and by tropospheric CO, and H,O. Variations in surface\nalbedo and cloud amount may modify shortwave heating rates in the stratosphere, and introduce non-zonal\nforcing (Lindzen, 1965). In addition, reflected radiation from below also affects stratospheric photochemistry\n(Callis et al., 1975).\nIn the longwave (thermal infrared) region, ozone absorption at 9.6pm is of special interest since it allows efficient radiative communication from the cloud-tops or surface to the lower stratosphere. In fact, the same\nstratospheric airmass may be radiatively heated while passing over the warm tropical ocean, and cooled while\ngoing over a high, cold cloud. Changes in the surface temperature of - 20\xe2\x80\x9d between day and night, which is\ntypical of desert regions, induce diurnal cooling rate fluctuations of -0.2\xe2\x80\x9d/day\nin the lower stratosphere,\nwhich may provide a non-migrating tidal forcing (Fels, 1979, private communciation). None of these effects\nhave been studied in detail, nor has the role played by upwelling IR in maintaining the structure of the polar\nnight stratosphere.\nBy contrast, the tropospheric effects of changes in the stratosphere, (as mediated by radiation), have received\na great deal of attention in the past decade, due largely to fears that anthropogenic perturbations of the\nstratosphere will affect the troposphere. Although in principle these interactions are well described by the\ntraditional methods of terrestrial radiative theory, in practice they proved rather delicate, demanding not only\ncareful theoretical treatment, but also very accurate specification of atmospheric variables such as composition, thermal structure, cloud amounts, spectra, particle size distribution, and absorption. Often the required\naccuracy is beyond our present attainment.\nThe source of the delicacy lies in the complementary role played by short and longwave radiation. To an\nobserver located in the troposphere, the stratosphere may be conveniently regarded as a highly nongrey\nscreen, absorbing and scattering, on the one hand, portions of the incoming solar beam, and on the other,\nproviding a source of downward infrared radiation. Generally these two effects have opposite signs, and\nassessment of the radiative effects of perturbations to the stratosphere is plagued by the difficulties common\nin such situations. These problems are illustrated by a consideration of the radiative effects of ozone,\nstratospheric aerosols and carbon dioxide, and of altered amounts of these constitutents.\n\nRadiative Properties of Ozone\nReducing 0, allows more solar radiation to reach the tropopause, but cools the stratosphere, so less IR is\nemitted downward. The roles played by these two effects have been examined extensively by Ramanathan and\nco-workers (Ramanathan et al., 1976; Ramanathan, 1977; Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979). They find that\nin a global mean sense there can be close cancellation between the two. In view of this, the methods for\ncalculating 0, radiative transfer may be important.\n\n276\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nA sense of the variation\n\nby the use of different assumptions may be had by considering the change in\ndownward solar flux across the tropopause due to a 30% uniform reduction in ozone between 12 and 40 km.\nRamanathan et al. (1976) find an increase of 1.14 W/m2. The shortwave algorithm of Lacis and Hansen\n(1974) ,gives 1.07 W/m2 and 1.OO W/m 2, depending on cloud parameterization (Fels, 1978, private communication; Coakley, 1978). The compensating IR effect is calculated to be - 1.5 W/m2 so that the residual\nerror due to uncertainty in the shortwave calculation is as much as 25%.\nAs emphasized by Ramanathan and Dickinson (1979), however, the delicacy of the global mean annual\nresponse may be illusory. They find that the IR effect is roughly uniform with latitude, while the solar effect is\nstronger at the Equator than at the poles on an annual average basis, so that there is likely to be a net cooling\nin high latitudes. They also found that changes in the shape of the 0, profile may be more important than a\nuniform change in amount. In one case, a 60% reduction in 0, to 40 km, with smaller variation above and\nbelow, (the columnar amount remaining constant) apparently leads to a net global increase in downward flux,\nwith warming equatorward of 50\xe2\x80\x9d.\nChanges in stratospheric temperature due to purely dynamical effects can also affect the energy input into the\nlower atmosphere. As mentioned previously, the 9.6pm 0, band is especially important in this connection. A\nparticularly interesting example, discussed earlier, in connection with stratospheric sudden warmings has been\nanalyzed by Ramanathan (1977). He finds that the annual arctic surface energy budget has a non-trivial component (7-15%) due to the downward 0, IR flux from the stratosphere, and that during a sudden warming\nthis flux can increase by several W/m2 leading to a rise in surface temperatures of a few degrees. This acts to\ndecrease the available potential energy in the troposphere.\n\nRadiative Properties of Aerosols\nThe lower stratosphere contains a complex mixture of particles (The Junge Layer), whose origin is not completely understood. During periods when there has been no large-scale volcanic activity for several years, the\ndominant constituents are sulfate compounds. The optical depth (at 0.5pm) during such periods is probably\n< .Ol (Toon and Pollack, 1976, Young and Elford, 1979). Immediately after large eruptions such as that of\nAgung in 1963, the stratospheric optical depth increased very substantially, values of 0.2 to 0.3 having been\nmeasured (Irvine and Peterson, 1970). In principle, such events present an excellent test of our understanding\nof radiative influences of the stratosphere on the troposphere, and of local thermal changes in the\nstratosphere, Unfortunately,\nthe actual situation is complicated by the same type of cancellation between\nshort and longwave effects discussed previously, and is beclouded further by our uncertainty about the scat.tering and absorption properties of the aerosols. In situ sampling (reviewed in Hansen et al., 1978), suggests\nthat the initial pulse of ejectum from Agung contained a \xe2\x80\x9clarge amount\xe2\x80\x9d of silicate dust, which settled out\nwithin a month, leaving a residue of sulfate particles. Since silicates both absorb and scatter in the visible and\nultraviolet, while sulfates have low absorption, their radiative effects are quite different. This difference is\nless important in effect in the downward flux into the troposphere than in the in situ heating due to solar absorption.\nExtensive calculations of the change in planetary albedo have been carried out by Herman et al. (1976), both\nfor 75% H,SO, particles, and more general aerosols with various values of single scattering albedo. In\ngeneral, these cannot be used to calculate changes in the downward flux at the tropopause. As might be expected, the sulfate-type aerosol layer of an optical depth of about 0.03 increased the albedo at all latitudes and\nseasons, but most noticeably in the high latitude winter. These authors also emphasize that in general the\nchange in planetary albedo due to aerosols depends on the albedo of the surface beneath, as well as the single\nscattering albedo.\n_.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\nThe emission of downward IR by aerosols depends in an important way on their imaginary index of refraction\nin the IR, and on the size distribution of particles. The former is generally such that the single-scattering\nalbedo is low, but the latter is highly variable and uncertain. The efficiency of the IR effect is extremely sensitive to the number of large (>0.5pm) particles; Pollack et al. (1976a) have shown, for example, that if the\nmode particle radius of a hypothetical basaltic silicate aerosol is taken as 0.25pm, the aerosol acts to cool the\nsurface. When the mode size is O.Spm, however, the greenhouse effect is sufficiently large to convert this to a\nheating.\nIn their discussion of the climatic effects of the Agung eruption Hansen et al. (1978) assumed that the longlived H,SO, component of the aerosols had an effective radius of 0.2-0.3pm, so that the increase in\ndownward flux of IR is only 25% of the decrease in the solar beam. Using a simplified radiative convective\nmodel with a 7Opm ocean mixed layer, they find a decrease in tropical tropospheric temperature of - 0.5 \xe2\x80\x99\none year after the eruption, a result which agrees with the observations of Newell and Weare (1976). There is\nan indirect reference in the literature to the work of Mason (1976), claiming that neither theory nor observation shows any tropospheric effect. Whether the manner in which the IR is treated accounts for the negative\nresult is not known; certainly, however, the great sensitivity to the aerosol size distribution suggests that further observational work is necessary.\n\nRadiative Properties of Carbon Dioxide\nAlthough large temperature changes (- - 10\xe2\x80\x9d at 50 km) are expected if the CO, burden of the atmosphere is\ndoubled, the stratospheric effect is not likely to be important for the troposphere, for the fact that the\nstratosphere is essentially in radiative equilibrium largely determines the downward IR flux at its base. If,\nhowever, we wish to use observed temperatures and mixing ratios to calculate cooling rates to diagnose\ndynamical heating in the stratosphere, such uncertainties will be quite serious. The magnitude of the cooling\nrate error due to the uncertainties in spectral data is on the order of several tenths of a degree/day (Fels and\nSchwarzkopf, 1980), which is thought to be the size of dynamical heating in the lower and middle\nstratosphere.\nThe concentration of CO, is extremely uniform in space and time below 70 km, so that most of the uncertainty in the IR cooling rates arises from basic spectroscopic data. The data on which most calculations of CO,\nfluxes and cooling rates have been based are those of Drayson (1973), and the AFCRL compilation (McClatthy et al., 1973). Detailed comparisons carried out by Fels and Schwarzkopf (1980) show that spectrally integrated absorptions based on these two sources agree to within 2% at worst. This may be misleading,\nhowever, for the two data sets are not independent. Planet et al. (1978) have made tunable laser diode\nmeasurements of individual lines in the fundamental band, and find intensities as much as 7% less than those\nof Drayson. Of equal importance are the pressure broadened linewidths, which Planet et al. (1978) find to be\n- 15% greater than the values used by Drayson. Taking these numbers to be representative of all lines, it appears that for strong absorption which depends on the product of the strength and width, the discrepancy may\nbe 4%, while in the weak region, as much as 7%.\n\nRadiative Properties of Water Vapor\nAlthough present in very small quantities (10-5-10-6 kg/kg), the strong IR features of water contribute on the\norder of 5-10 W/m2 to the downward IR flux at the tropopause, and less than 0.5 \xe2\x80\x9c/day to stratospheric cooling rates. These latter are comparable to those due to CO, in the lower stratosphere, but substantially smaller\nabove 25 km. Possible changes in the tropical tropopause temperature could subsequently change the water\nvapor amount in the stratosphere and suggest that resulting IR flux changes could be on the order of several\nW/m2. Of equal significance is the fact that the amount of stratospheric water could be important in determining the size of the change in the downward IR flux when the temperature of the stratosphere changes due\nto other causes. The chief uncertainties in the radiative role of stratospheric water are due to poor knowledge\nof the water vapor mixing ratios.\n\nI -\n\n278\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nRadiative Effects on Wave-Mean Flow Interactions\nIn this subsection on radiative exchanges, the discussion has emphasized the role played by radiation in energy\ntransport. Radiative processes are also responsible for the excitation and damping of waves and other timedependent disturbances. The past decade has seen a growing understanding of the important part played by\nwave-mean flow interactions in the stratospheric genera1 circulation,\nand in tracer transport. Such\nphenomena as the quasi-biennial oscillation, and stratospheric warmings, and perhaps mean flow forcing by\ntides are obvious examples. These interactions, however, depend crucially on the relaxing of the so-called\n\xe2\x80\x9cnon-acceleration\xe2\x80\x9d\ntheorems (McIntyre, 1979). In simple terms these theorems say that waves will not permanently affect the mean state unless there are either transient or dissipative processes present. These include\n\xe2\x80\x9ccritical level\xe2\x80\x9d interactions, wave breaking, viscous effects, and radiative damping or forcing. Of these, the\neasiest to handle theoretically are the radiative effects. The possibility that changes in radiative properties due\nto altered O,, CO, or aerosol levels might therefore affect the wave-mean flow interactions cannot be\nneglected and is currently under investigation.\n\nFinal Remarks\nConsiderable progress has been made in the last decade in understanding radiative processes in the\nstratosphere. It is likely that future research will concentrate on clarification of the local rather than global effects of changes in stratospheric composition, and on better measurement of the climatological and\nlaboratory data.\n\nELECTRICAL COUPLING\nRecent ideas regarding coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere involve perturbations of the global\nelectrical circuit (e.g., Markson, 1978 and Roble and Hays, 1979). Such perturbations include modulations of\nthe atmospheric electrical conductivity and electric fields. The stratosphere may participate in the electrical\nenhancement of thunderstorm activity, cloud growth, precipitation effects, etc. within the troposphere.\nAt this time, the proposed concepts are largely speculative, and more research is needed in this area. Electrical\nproperties of the stratosphere, including fluctuations induced by the troposphere, are largely unknown; they\nare described by a limited number of rocket and balloon samplings of electrical conductivity and electric fields\nwithin this region. For a detailed account of this field, the reader is referred to Middle Afmospheric Electrodynamics (NASA, CP-2090) which is the proceedings of the recent workshop on the Role of the Electrodynamics of the Middle Atmosphere on Solar Terrestrial Coupling.\n\nSUMMARY AND FUTURE NEEDS\nThis chapter has discussed the types of measurements that form the data base for studies of the meteorology\nof the stratosphere, together with discussion of some of the analytical techniques now used to analyze the\nspatial and temporal fields of stratospheric parameters from the input data. It was pointed out that different\nanalysis strategies are used for synoptic (simultaneous) measurements, such as those with the worldwide\nradiosonde network, than for asynoptic (nonsimultaneous) satellite measurements. It is important to note\nthat regardless of the analysis technique used, the original spacing of the observations will determine the\nscales of motion that are possible to study. In particular, since the transport of a physical quantity such as\nheat, momentum, or ozone mathematically takes the form of a covariance of a transport velocity and that\nquantity, it is crucial to have horizontal, vertical, and temporal resolutions that are sufficient to define the\nscales of variation that contain most of the variance about the mean. Also, of course, the variance in each\nmeasured variable that results from measurement inaccuracies should be small compared to that resulting\nfrom geophysical variability. With availability of larger amounts and more accurate data, more sophisticated\ndata handling and analysis schemes will be required.\n\nMETEOROLOGY OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\n279\n\nOur understanding of the stratospheric general circulation is improving, but further advances await analysis\nof existing data and acquisition and analysis of more extensive stratospheric data sets with better spatial and\ntemporal resolution. Until recently, the existing picture of the stratospheric wind and temperature fields\nabove the level where radiosonde measurements can be made (about 10 mb in pressure or 30 km in altitude)\nwas based on sparse rocket measurements taken over many years. Satellite measurements are seen to be essential for continuous geographical and temporal coverage in the stratosphere, but they need to be complemented by measurements using other platforms such as aircraft, balloons, and rockets for investigations of\nsmall scale processes and for calibration of instruments on satellites.\nObservationally, it is well known that in the middle latitude stratosphere there is a strong annual oscillation in\nthe mean zonal winds, with strong westerlies existing in the winter, and strong easterlies existing in the summer. This annual march in the mean zonal flow is driven mainly by the differential heating of the\nozonosphere. The observations also show that during the winter season, the stratospheric flow displays marked planetary scale waviness that is due to the upward extension of the tropospheric planetary waves driven as\na consequence of the continent-ocean distribution while in the summer the flow is nearly circular. There have\nbeen recent advances in understanding how these planetary waves interact with the mean zonal flow in the \xe2\x80\x99\nstratosphere. However, to correctly model these interactions, it appears necessary to treat irreversible effects\nsuch as radiative processes and mechanical dissipative processes together with a proper description of transient processes.\nOne notable success in the interplay between theory and observation has been the explanation of the quasibiennial oscillation in the equatorial lower stratospheric wind in terms of equatorial wave interactions with\nthe mean zonal flow. However, this success was partially due to the existing observational capabilities being\nwell-matched to the oscillation itself, as well as to the characteristics of the equatorial waves in terms of\naltitude, vertical resolution, and period. The fact that an explanation of the semi-annual oscillation has not\nyet been obtained is probably due, in large part, to the fact that the dynamical processes are not so well\nmatched to existing observational capabilities. In the case of both the quasi-biennial oscillation and the semiannual oscillations, it remains to be understood how the tropical oscillation is coupled to extratropical\nlatitudes.\nOur understanding of the interplay between the dynamical and chemical processes that determine the distribution of ozone has been hampered by the fact that existing observations are inadequate to provide a detailed\nbudget of ozone. However, there does exist a general agreement between model results and ozone observations. Some improvement in this situation should be forthcoming with the analysis of data obtained from\nprevious and existing satellites and from in situ measurements from aircraft, for example, but new observations will be required.\nPart of the difficulty in studying the stratosphere observationally is that it is such an active region dynamically. For example, during every other winter, on the average, there occurs a major warming in which the\ntemperature at high latitudes increases by tens of degrees Centigrade in only a few days, the sense of the zonal\nflow reverses (in the Northern Hemisphere), and ozone distributions are greatly altered. Also, each warming\nhas a somewhat different character. Thus, one year\xe2\x80\x99s observations are not necessarily representative of any\nother year.\nThe cause of stratospheric warmings appears to be understood to the extent that they are known to be connected with enhancements in tropospheric energy flux transported upward by the planetary waves. However,\nthis appears to be a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for a warming to take place. Also, the cause of\nthese planetary wave enhancements is not understood. It is not believed that short period motions such as\ntides or gravity waves play a major role in affecting the stratospheric mean flow directly through wave-mean\nflow interactions, as do planetary waves. However, there is evidence that gravity wave produced turbulence\nmay play a major role in dissipating momentum. There is a newly developing radar technology which is being\n\n280\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\napplied to the remote sensing of winds and turbulence in the stratosphere. This should prove to be most\nvaluable for investigations of stratospheric short period motions in the coming years. This technique will be\nleast applicable to stratopause levels, however, due to minimum radar reflection at that level.\nWhile synoptic scale instabilities (analogous to the highs and lows on a weather map) do not appear to be as\nimportant in influencing the global circulation as planetary scale motions in the stratosphere, there is some\nobservational evidence for their existence. Further research is needed to determine if they give rise to locally\nimportant heat and momentum fluxes.\nMuch of the current concern about the stratosphere involves the effects of tropospheric sources of chemicals\nthat are active photochemically in the stratosphere. To treat these problems rigorously, it is necessary to\nunderstand the manner in which tropospheric air enters the stratosphere. Several scales of motions appear to\nbe responsible for this interchange of air, ranging from planetary scale circulations to turbulent exchange.\nUnfortunately,\nthe relative importance of these scales is not known, and more observations are needed to\nestablish this. Aircraft and radiosonde observations are particularly well suited to this problem due to their\nability to provide resolution of structure in the vicinity of the tropopause.\nRecent theoretical work has indicated the possible importance of dynamical and radiative coupling between\nthe troposphere and stratosphere, in the sense that stratospheric changes may affect the troposphere. These\nare new results that need to be checked observationally. Even more speculative is the stratosphere\xe2\x80\x99s role in\nelectrically coupling downward into the troposphere. There is evidence of solar related stratospheric variations. These have been studied statistically; however, the conclusions remain controversial. Mechanisms have\nbeen suggested, but there is need for more work both observationally and theoretically.\nWhen the state of knowledge of meteorological processes in the stratosphere is examined, the first need identified is for an increased diagnosis effort on stratospheric processes, using data from different sources such as\nsatellites, rockets, radar, lidar, balloons, and aircraft. The absence of such efforts leads to the use of model\nresults that are not sufficiently validated against observations. Observational programs that are well matched\nto the problem being investigated in spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and duration need to be planned\nand executed. The data outputs from these programs need to be extensively analyzed and checked against proposed theoretical and numerical models.\n\nCHAPTER\nLONG PERIOD\n\nCHANGES\n\n6\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the assessment of anthropogenic influences on stratospheric ozone, ideally one would like to have complete\nglobal ozone data sets extending over a time period such that any periodic and aperiodic variations in the\nnatural atmosphere could be determined. Because the atmosphere is a complex, nonlinear system, it would\nalso be necessary to have simultaneous measurements of a set of other parameters known to influence the\nozone concentration (e.g., air temperature, N,O, solar spectral irradiance, etc.). Finally, it would be convenient to have additional data sets of parameters which exist independently from ozone (e.g., potential\nvorticity), and subject to common atmospheric factors (e.g., transport), to verify that conclusions drawn\nfrom the ozone record are correct.\nIn reality, the ozone data sets are very short; one has to search for measurements that extend more than twenty years. The longest data sets of most trace constituents represent only local conditions and are thus subject\nto higher variability than found in global data sets. Furthermore, in some cases, it has been necessary to use\nsurface or tropospheric measurements, rather than stratospheric data, to obtain information about trends.\nFor those constituents that are long-lived, the results are assumed to apply to the lower stratosphere.\nObservations made over the past 50 years of the total amount of ozone in a vertical column have established\nthe average column abundance and the general pattern of latitudinal,\nlongitudinal,\nseasonal, and\nmeteorological variations. The average total amount of ozone is about 0.3 atm-cm at STP. The latitude variation and the seasonal variations at sub-polar latitudes are about f 20% of this average value. During a typical\nwinter or spring month, day-to-day variations at mid-to-high latitudes could amount to + 50% and year-toyear variations of the annual average at individual stations could be as high as + 10%.\nRoutine measurements of the vertical ozone distribution over the past 20 years have also indicated an ozone\ndistribution pattern that varies with latitude, season, and meteorological conditions. Large latitudinal and\nseasonal variations, as high as f 25070,are found at and below the level of maximum ozone. Also, day-to-day\nchanges, sometimes larger than a factor of 2, are noted in the ozone concentrations below the level of ozone\nmaximum. Variations above this level are relatively smaller. In addition, approximately 10% of the changes\nin the annual mean vertical distributions occur over periods of years, both locally and globally.\nIn this chapter an attempt is made to determine whether analysis of records can be used to find out what long\nperiod changes (if any) exist and to what extent (if any) they can be ascribed to human activity. The first problem is purely statistical; that is, to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d trend from a set of ozone observations. The second\nproblem involves the interpretations of these trends.\nA great deal of progress has been made in the recent past with the statistical problem; relatively small changes\nin the basic statistical characteristics of observed records can be detected. However, the interpretation of the\nstatistical results is more difficult. Trends can occur for reasons independent of man\xe2\x80\x99s activity. First, there\nmay be changes over long periods of natural origin. Since the records at most stations cover a period of only\nabout 20 years, they are too short to permit understanding of the statistical properties of these variations. Second, there may exist trends in the observations because of changes in the instrument characteristics. Third,\nthere can be apparent changes if the measurements are not representative of global conditions because the stations are geographically biased.\nTrends due to the first two of these causes are generally unpredictable. With global sampling from satellites,\nthe third problem in trend determination can be greatly reduced. Observed trends must exceed significantly\n281\n\n282\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nany reasonable trends produced by a combination of these effects before any part of the trend can be confidently ascribed to man-made changes in global ozone.\nIn this chapter,. our knowledge of all these matters is summarized. The emphasis is on conventional total\nozone records, which exist for a relatively long period, but for which the models predict only modest changes.\nCommentary is made on the vertical distributions of ozone in the upper stratosphere, where predicted changes\nare large, but where the records are relatively short. Also included are analyses of the evidence for long-term\nchanges in atmospheric temperatures and in trace constituents important to the stratosphere.\n\nA;VAILABLE OBSERVATIONS FOR TREND ANALYSES\nThe techniques that are in common use for measurement of atmospheric\nRR-1010. In this report, primarily new developments since 1977 and the\nanalysis are discussed. Recent summaries of the satellite ozone measurement\nKrueger et al.

The Dobson instrument is the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO) designated standard instrument which is in use at about 75 stations, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. The M-83 is used at about 35 stations, principally in the Soviet\nUnion and Eastern Europe.\nObservations with the Dobson instrument started in 1925, and with the M-83 in 1957. During the 1930s and\n194Os, there were 3 to 5 Dobson stations at which total ozone observations were taken more or less routineiy.\nThese were in the Northern Hemisphere, and not all were in operation during the same period. The number of\nobserving stations increased during the 1950s to 40 at the start of the International Geophysical Year 1957.\nObservations are normally made daily during daytime.\n\nSatellite Observations\nA chronology of satellite flights in which extensive ozone measurements have been made is given in table 6-1.\nBackscatter ultraviolet methods for total ozone measurements (Dave and Mateer, 1967) were first tested with\nthe Nimbus-4 satellite backscatter ultraviolet (BUV) instrument, a nadir-viewing ultraviolet monochromator.\nThe method uses measurements of the relative absorption of sunlight which has passed through the\nstratospheric ozone layer and is reflected from the lower atmosphere or the surface back to space. Because approximately seven years of global observations were acquired with the Nimbus-4 instrument, this data set is\nimportant for total ozone monitoring.\nAn improved version of the Nimbus-4 BUV, called the Solar-Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument, was\nlaunched on the Nimbus-7 satellite in October 1978. A second BUV-type instrument, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), was also flown on Nimbus-7 to evaluate the backscatter ultraviolet technique for\noff-nadir soundings. This instrument is a monochromator, sensing the BUV total ozone wavelengths, but\nequipped with a cross-track optical scanner to measure the complete global ozone field (excluding polar night)\nwith an average spatial resolution of 75 km. One of the objectives in development of the TOMS instrument\n\nr\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\nTable 6-1\nSatellite Sensors for Ozone Data\nSatellite and\nInstrument\n\nOzone Measurement\n\nData Record\n\nComments\n\nOGO-4\nBUV\n\nProfile\n\nSep 67 -Jan (\n\nSolar spectral irradiance inferred from rocket ozonesonde\nfor OGO-4 calibration.

The nadir-viewing Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) experiments on the Nimbus-3 and\nNimbus-4 satellites produced data for the months of April through July 1969 and from April 1970 to early\nJanuary 1971.\nSince the time of the IRIS flights, several temperature sounding instruments have included a channel to sense\nthe 9.6pm ozone band. Beginning in March 1977, the Multichannel Filter Radiometer (MFR) instrument on\nfour of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program series of satellites included such a channel. The most recent 9.6pm ozone sensor is part of the High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HIRS) sensor on the Tiros-N\nSatellite, launched in November 1978.\n\nVERTICAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nOF OZONE\n\nBalloon-Borne Ozonesondes\nThe present network of in situ balloon observations of the vertical ozone distribution is based on two types of\nelectrochemical instruments. The height ceiling for these ozonesondes is about 30 km as a result of the techniques used and the limitation of the carrier balloon. There are currently about 20 observing stations in the\nglobal network, with all but one in the Northern Hemisphere. Most stations use the Brewer-Mast type of instrument. Data for about half of these stations are available for slightly more than 10 years. Most stations\ntake an average of only 2 to 4 observations per month. This limits the representativeness of the mean monthly\nozone values for those stations.\n\nUmkehr Observations\nZenith sky observations taken with a Dobson Spectrophotometer at several solar zenith angles during a morning or afternoon can be used to derive an ozone profile up to about 50 km. This technique (Craig, 1965)\ndepends on Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorption in the stratosphere. As the solar zenith angle increases\nfrom 60 to 90 degrees, the center of the contribution function shifts from near the surface to about 45 km.\nThe change in zenith sky radiance is then interpreted in terms of the gross features of an ozone profile.\nAt the present time, there are about 15 stations taking routine Umkehr observations, about half of which have\nrecords for slightly over 20 years. However, the observational frequency is highly irregular, and for most stations, considerable portions of the data record are completely missing. Only the Arosa and Tateno stations\nhave published mean monthly values for at least 90% of their 20-year record, but long series of observations\nhave also been made (but not yet processed) at several Australian stations.\n\nRocketsondes\nMeteorological sounding rockets are the least expensive vehicles for direct measurements of the ozone\ndistribution above balloon ozonesonde altitudes (approximately 30 km). Direct techniques can be based on\nabsolute methods, generally measure with 1 to 2 km vertical resolution, and are normally accompanied by\ndirect measurements of air temperature and winds.\nTwo techniques are available for rocket measurements of ozone from about 20 km to 60 km altitude. These\nare based on: (1) optical absorption of sunlight or moonlight in the Hartley and Huggins bands of ozone, and\n(2) chemiluminescence of dyes. To date, a total of 370 soundings, mostly optical type, have been reported.\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n285\n\nThe first rocket measurement was made in 1946 (Johnson et al., 1951) but routine measurements have been\nmade only from 1976 to 1978. Data from all known launches are currently being assembled as part of the\nWMO-sponsored International Rocket Ozonesonde Intercomparison, scheduled for October 1979.\n\nSatellite Observations\nThe ultraviolet spectrum of the sunlit atmosphere contains information about the stratospheric ozone profile.\nThe first satellite experiments to investigate this technique were flown in 1965, but the first global data set of\nsignificant duration for trend analysis was obtained from the backscatter ultraviolet experiment on the\nOGO-4 satellite in 1967. Table 6-1, presented earlier, lists the satellite ozone profile experiments. The most extensive data set (7 years) was obtained from the Nimbus-4 BUV which was launched in 1970. A similar instrument was launched on the AE-5 satellite in November 1975 to obtain tropical data. The Nimbus BUV ozone\nprofile data set is now being extended with the SBUV on Nimbus-7.\nA second major technique for measuring the ozone profile uses observations of the radiance of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nlimb in the 9.6hm band of ozone. The Limb Radiance Inversion Radiometer (LRIR) sensor on Nimbus-6 obtained global data from June 1975 to January 1976 using this method. Subsequent limb observations of the\nvertical distribution of ozone have been obtained on Nimbus-7 with the Limb Infrared Monitor of the\nStratosphere (LIMS) sensor, an improved version of the LRIR experiment.\nA third technique for profile soundings uses solar occultations as the satellite passes in or out of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nshadow. Although the observations are not global, data will be available from the Stratospheric Aerosol and\nGas Experiment (SAGE), launched in early 1979 aboard an Applications Explorer Mission (AEM) satellite.\n\nMEASUREMENT ERRORS FOR TREND DETERMINATION\nThe reliability of a measurement may be expressed in terms of random errors (related to measurement precision) and systematic or bias errors (related to measurement accuracy). It is important to consider both of\nthese errors in long-term (more than several years) trend determinations since the minimum length of record\nneeded for determination of a significant trend depends upon the precision of individual measurements and\ntheir frequency, while variations with time of systematic measurement errors may be falsely interpreted as real\nchanges in the parameter considered. The treatment of systematic errors is, furthermore, fundamentally linked to time scales. Systematic errors that vary during time periods considerably shorter than the period of\nrecord under consideration are generally treated as random errors. Thus, what appears to be a trend in a short\nobservational record may be, instead, a short term fluctuation in a long record.\nProcedures for combining measurement random errors are well defined by statistical theory (e.g., Ku, 1966).\nHowever, there is no generally accepted standard method for combining several systematic errors (Eisenhart,\n1963). For a function of two variables W = F (X,Y), where the systematic errors associated with X and Y are\nAx and Ay, respectively, the bound IAw 1 for the systematic error in W is given by:\n\nassuming that Ax and Ay are small so that second and higher order terms in Ax and Ay are collectively negligible in the Taylor series expansion. Since the signs of Ax and Ay are not ordinarily known, an accepted procedure is to add the absolute values of the two terms together. (If the sign of either Ax or Ay is known, this information, of course, should not be ignored.) However, when the systematic errors are believed to be uncorrelated, an alternate approach is to take IAw 1 as the square root of the sum of the squares of\n\nI-\n\n286\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nterms on the right hand side of (1) instead of adding together the absolute values of all terms. This procedure\npresupposes that some of the systematic errors may be positive and others negative, and that the two classes\ncancel to a certain extent.\n\nTOTAL OZONE MEASUREMENT ERRORS\nDobson Spectrophotometer Total Ozone Measurement Errors\nEstimates of Dobson spectrophotometer\nmarized in table 6-2 where a distinction\ndeterminations and those that do.\n\ntotal ozone random and systematic measurement errors are sumis made between systematic errors that do not affect ozone trend\n\nTable 6-2\nDobson Ozone Spectrophotometer Measurement\nError Estimates\nType of Error\n\nEstimated Value*\n\nSystematic Errors\n1.

J. Miller, private communication, 1979), rocket ozonesonde measurements\n(Krueger, 1969) and balloon ozone soundings (Komhyr, 1979) suggests that Dobson spectrophotometer\ntotal ozone data may be systematical!y biased by up to + 7% due to uncertainties in AD wavelength absorption coefficients used in data reduction, or by the presence of some anomalous absorber in the atmosphere. Although the existence of an anomalous atmospheric absorber might pose problems for\nozone trend analyses if its abundance changes with time, the magnitude of the postulated error appears\nto be too large to be caused by unknown trace gas species. A systematic error in AD wavelength ozone\nabsorption coefficients will not affect trend analysis results. Nevertheless, the problem of whether or\nnot this error is real merits attention, particularly since Dobson total ozone observations provide\nground referencedata for satellite ozone measurements. A significant difference would imply either a\ncalibration error in one of the systems or an incomplete model for the satellite retrievals.\n\nCW Fixed ozone absorption coefficients are used in reducing Dobson instrument observations. The absorption coefficients are temperature sensitive, and since stratospheric temperatures in the region of the\nozone maximum may vary up to f 5 \xe2\x80\x9cC during the course of several years (discussed under Long-Term\nVariations of Other Parameters), resulting maximum systematic errors in measured total ozone are\nestimated to be &0.5% (Powell, 1971).\n\n(2b) The net effect of Dobson instrument calibration\n\ndrifts (upward and downward), resulting from\ndeterioration of optical and electronic components, mechanical shock, and contamination problems is\nestimated to be equivalent to a 0.3% per year drift in data from any 10 stations in the Dobson network.\n\n(2c)\n\nThe occurrence of 15% changes in solar extra-terrestrial irradiance at 300.0 nm during the course of a\nsunspot cycle has been proposed (Heath and Thekaekara, 1977). If the irradiance change is assumed to\nbe exponentially decreasing in the wavelength region 300.0 to 400.0 nm, calculations show that\nsystematic ozone errors, assuming a constant extra-terrestrial solar irradiance when processing Dobson\ninstrument data, do not exceed 50.3% for observations on AD double pair wavelengths. The effects of\nchanges in Fraunhofer structural features in the extra-terrestrial solar spectrum at the Dobson\nwavelengths during the course of a sunspot cycle or other longer period solar constant changes, if any,\ncannot be quantified at the present time, but presumably are small.\n\n(24 Current estimates (see e.g., Shah, 1976; Thomas and Holland, 1977) of the effect of scattering and absorption by tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols on double-pair-wavelength\ntype Dobson spectrophotometer measurements give total ozone errors of approximately 1% for highly polluted conditions. Considering the possibility of an increasing or decreasing aerosol pollution trend occurring at a\nstation, this error translates into a systematic error of + I%, a result that is probably subject to upward\nrevision by a factor of 2, pending additional research.\n\nCW Ozone is produced photochemically\n\nin polluted air near ground level. During times of extreme pollution and high solar insolation, a 10% ozone addition to the total ozone column may result. For a station located where local pollution is gradually increasing or decreasing during the course of several or\nmore years, taking into account that highly polluted conditions do not occur on all days, the resulting\ncontribution to total ozone systematic measurement error is estimated to f 1%. A similar effect\n(Komhyr, 1979) involving other UV absorbers in polluted air (principally SO,) translates into estimated\nsystematic measurement errors of f 2%.\n\nI -\n\n288\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n(2f)\n\nThe estimated cloud-effect systematic ozone measurement errors of + 1% shown in table 6-2 stem from\ntemporal cloud condition changes that may occur at a Dobson station. Biases arise from a relative increase or decrease in the frequency of observations made on clouds, or from changes in station observational procedures (e.g., observations on clouds may be avoided).\n\n(3)\n\nMeasurement random standard errors associated with Dobson instrument total ozone amounts are also\nsummarized in table 6-2. For an optimally maintained and operated instrument during a measurement\nprogram of several or more years duration, the random standard error of an individual AD-wavelength\ndirect sun observation is estimated to be+ 1.5%. This estimate is based on consideration of random\nstandard errors associated with periodic instrument calibrations, relatively short period fluctuations in\nthe instrument calibration level, observer errors, aerosol effects stemming from varying haze conditions, and ozone absorption coefficient variations resulting from annual stratospheric temperature\nfluctuations. For an average observatory in the global total ozone station network, it is reasonable to\nassume a direct sun ozone measurement precision of -t 3%.\n\n(4)\n\nWhen direct sun total ozone data are compared with results of zenith sky observations, an agreement in\nresults is obtained to within ?2% for about 70% of the pair measurements (Komhyr, 1961). Combining this result with the direct sun observational error data given above yields a measurement standard\nerror of + 2.5% for zenith sky observations at an optimally operated Dobson instrument observatory.\nFor an average station in the global total ozone station network, it is likely that the measurement precision for zenith sky observations is +5%.\n\nM-83 Ozonometer Total Ozone Measurement Errors\nTotal ozone observations with the M-83 filter ozonometer, developed by Gushchin in 1958 (Gushchin, 1974,\n1977), are based on the measurement of solar irradiance ratios in three different broad spectral intervals in the\nHuggins ozone absorption band. In the past, performance evaluations of the instrument have been provided\nby Bojkov (1969) and Vanier and Wardle (1969). In comparisons with Nimbus-4 BUV total ozone values in\n1970-1971, the rms difference with M-83 data was 18% vs. an rms difference with Dobson measurements of\n5.3%. There has been improvement in the optics used in the M-83 instrument since 197 1, mostly through the\nuse of new light filters. As a result, errors associated with use of these instruments have been reduced.\nA performance evaluation of an M-83 ozonometer during 1977-78 in Boulder, Colorado (Szwarc, 1978), indicated that within the air mass range 1.3 to 3.5, direct sun Dobson spectrophotometer and M-83 ozonometer\nozone readings agreed to f 3070,with the M-83 instrument data exhibiting an air mass dependence such that at\nan air mass approaching 1.O measured ozone amounts were too low by about 5%. Observations on the clear\nzenith sky with the M-83 instrument gave similar results. However, ozone observations made on low, thick\nclouds using standard measurement and data processing techniques yielded total ozone amounts 20% to 30%\ntoo high. It is likely that these measurement errors can be substantially reduced by employing corrections empirically derived from quasi-simultaneous observations on direct sun and the cloudy zenith.\n\nSatellite BUV Experiment Total Ozone Measurement Errors\nThe total ozone measurements from the Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) experiment are susceptible to some of\nthe same errors that affect the ground based instruments like the Dobson spectrophotometer. However, there\nare other sources of errors that are unique to a satellite-based instrument which retrieves total ozone on a\nglobal basis under a very wide range of atmospheric conditions. (Dave, 1978; Fraser and Ahmad, 1978 and\n1979; Bhartia et al., 1979; Klenk, 1979; Fleig et al., 1979). Table 6-3 lists the BUV and TOMS total ozone\nmeasurement errors, as they affect estimates of global ozone amounts.\n\nI-\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\n289\n\nTable 6-3\nBIJV and TOMS Total Ozone Measurement Error Estimates\nEstimated Value\n\nType of Error\n~~\nSystematic Errors\n(1)\n\nTrend determination not affected\n(a) Absorption coefficient uncertainties\n\n(2)\n\nlaboratory measurement\nerrors\n\nTrend determination affected (change per decade):\n(a) Oa abs. coeff. affected by strat. temp. changes\n\n+ 0.5%\n\n(b) Relative calibration errors between instruments\n\n<f3%\n\n(c) Solar spectrum changes\n\n+ 0.3% (Nimbus4)\n\n(d) Uncorrected calibration drifts\n\n+ 1% (Nimbus4)\n\n(e) Changes in stratospheric aerosol content\n\n<<l%\n\nRandom Errors\n\nf 1%\nimportant only near\nterminator (+ 5% for > 80\xe2\x80\x99\nzenith angle)\n\n(d) Surface reflectance errors\n\n< 1%\n\n(e) Aerosols (tropospheric)\n\n(la)\n\n+ 1%\n\n(c) Profile errors\n\nThe following\n\n(a) Noise and telemetry errors\n(b) Cloud errors\n\n(3)\n\n+ 0.5%\n\nis a brief discussion of the errors in the order listed in the table.\n\nOzone absorption coefficient uncertainties - Like any other ultraviolet instrument operating in the\nHartley/Huggins\nband, the absolute accuracy of the total ozone measurement from the BUV is limited\nby the uncertainties in the measured ozone absorption coefficients. At present, an accurate (- 1Ore),low\ntemperature ( - 30 to - 70 \xe2\x80\x9cC), high resolution ( - 0.1 nm) absorption spectrum of ozone in the 300 - 400\nnm range is not available. The effective absorption coefficients computed from the various reported\nmeasurements differ by as much as 25% for the primary BUV total ozone wavelength band centered\n\n290\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\naround 315.0 nm (Klenk, 1979a). Though an accurate measurement of the absolute amount of ozone is\nnecessary for intercomparison of various instruments, use of a common set of absorption cross sections\nwill not affect trend analysis results.\n(2a)\n\nFixed ozone absorption coefficients are assumed for BUV data reduction.\n\n(2b) Pre-launch instrument calibration error - A 1% error in the relative radiometric calibration between the\npaired wavelengths causes approximately 1% error in the retrieved ozone (note that errors in the absolute calibration are not important). For a data set obtained from one satellite sensor (such as the\nNimbus-4 BUV) this error causes a systematic bias in the retrieved ozone, but does not impact the trend\ndetermination. However, in a program of long-term ozone monitoring using a series of such instruments, this error will cause an interexperiment bias which may affect the trend analysis. For the\nNimbus-4 BUV, the uncertainty caused by this error is estimated to be approximately 3%. In an operational program with improved pre-launch calibrations, this uncertainty can be significantly reduced.\n(2~)\n\nSolar spectrum changes - If in-flight solar calibrations are not available (such as with Nimbus-4), trend\nerrors are comparable to Dobson network errors.\n\n(2d)\n\nUncorrected instrument calibration drift - One of the most important sources of errors which affect the\nlong-term trend determination is in the instrument calibration. In the case of the Nimbus-4 satellite\nBUV, degradation of the diffuser plate for solar flux measurements caused a serious problem in maintaining long-term instrument calibration. Alternative schemes which assume constant surface reflectivity in selected geographic areas were developed to correct for drifts in instrument calibration but the accuracy of these schemes is limited to + 1%. Several changes in the BUV instrument design have been incorporated in the TOMS and SBUV sensors to minimize any degradation.\n\n(2e)\n\nAerosol related uncertainties - From an extensive study of the effects of various types of aerosols on the\nBUV ozone measurements (Dave, 1977), one can draw the following conclusions:\n-\n\nThe most commonly occurring atmospheric aerosols (assumed to be non-absorbing)\ntle effect (< + 1%) on the retrieved ozone, even when present in large amounts.\n\nhave very lit-\n\n-\n\nFor localized highly absorbing aerosol clouds that might occur over an active volcano, the ozone\nmay be overestimated by as much as 5%. Given the rarity of such events, the error has negligible\nimpact on global ozone studies.\n\n(3a)\n\nInstrument noise - An instrument noise of 1% in each channel causes an error of 1.7% in total ozone.\nThe main source of the instrument noise in the case of the Nimbus-4 BUV is the size of the word used in\nthe transmission of the radiance data (digitization). The la error in the retrieved total ozone as a result\nof this error is calculated to be approximately 1%. Digitization errors in the SBUV have been reduced\nto insignificant levels, so that measurement noise is the limiting factor.\n\nlb)\n(3\n\nCloud related uncertainties - When significant cloud cover is in the field-of-view, BUV measures the\nozone above the cloud top. Since most of the ozone in the atmosphere (approximately 94%) lies above\nthe clouds, the error caused is not large. In the case of BUV algorithm, the ozone below the cloud top is\nestimated using climatological information, and is added to the measured ozone. It is calculated that\nthe la error in total ozone, in the presence of clouds, is approximately 3%, caused by the variations in\nozone amounts below the cloud. On a global basis, clouds are present in 5-10070of the soundings and\nthus are not a significant source of error (~0.3%).\n\n(3~)\n\nProfile shape related uncertainties - Unlike Dobson measurements, the BUV total ozone estimation can\ndepend on the vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere. This effect, however, becomes important only at solar zenith angles greater than 77\xe2\x80\x99 (Klenk, 1979b). As one approaches the terminator, the\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n291\n\ndependence on profile rapidly increases, and no ozone is retrieved when the errors are estimated to be\ngreater than 5%. The procedure effectively limits the retrieval to a maximum solar zenith angle of 82\xe2\x80\x9d\nto 85 o depending on climatological profile errors.\n(3d)\n\nSurface reflectivity related uncertainties - The BUV algorithm assumes an isotropic spectrally-neutral\nreflecting surface at the base of the atmosphere. Effects of various highly anisotropically reflecting surfaces like sea or ice have been studied theoretically (Ahmad, 1977) and their effect on total ozone\nretrievals is found to be <0.5%. The wavelength dependence of reflectivity of various surfaces has\nbeen analyzed in BUV and TOMS data from 330 to 380 nm and found to result in less than 1% errors in\ntotal ozone.\n\nComparisons between simultaneous Nimbus BUV and Dobson total ozone data indicate that for 1272 direct\nsun coincidences in 1970, the BUV values average 3.4% less than Dobson values and the rms difference was\n5.3%.\n\nInfrared Sounding Total Ozone Measurement Errors\nThe basic principle in infrared remote sensing of ozone from the 9.6pm band is that the stratospheric ozone\nlayer absorbs radiation from the surface and troposphere, and subsequently reemits to space at the\ntemperature of the ozone layer. This absorption and reemission produce the spectral features in the 9.6pm\nspectral region which are then inverted, taking into account the radiation transfer physics. Obviously, the\ntemperature profile information is intimately involved in this procedure. The ozone absorption in the 9.6pm\nband is relatively weak so that radiation from the surface and cloud tops also reaches the remote sensing platform. In view of this transparent nature of the band, the need for temperature profile information, and\nassumptions about the vertical ozone profile associated with all passive infrared sensing schemes, significant\nerrors are inherent and appear in the total ozone estimates.\nIn addition, instrument calibration errors and random noise in the radiance measurements will introduce total\nozone errors which depend on the particular instrument.\nPrabhakara et al. (1976) have analyzed the data from the Nimbus-4 IRIS, and find that the time-dependent\nerrors, reflecting a seasonally-dependent bias, as large as ? 10% can result due to the various reasons explained above. An analysis of errors for individual instruments is not presently available. A comparison of MFR\ndata with clear sky, near simultaneous ground-based observations from 32 Dobson stations for 20 days in the\nperiod May-July 1977 indicated that the MFR values were 2.3% lower than the Dobson with an rms difference of 6.6% (Lovill et al., 1978).\n\nERRORS IN OZONE PROFILE MEASUREMENT METHODS\nBalloon OzonesondeObservation Errors\nTwo\ntical\nECC\nrors,\n\ntypes of balloon ozonesonde systems, with various modifications, currently in use in routine ozone verdistribution monitoring programs are the Brewer-Mast ozonesonde (Brewer and Milford, 1960) and the\nozonesonde (Komhyr, 1969; Komhyr and Harris, 1971). The systematic and random measurement erassociated with the use of these instrument types, are summarized in table 6-4.\n\nTotal ozone amounts derived from Brewer-Mast sonde data are about 25% lower than Dobson instrument\nresults (Diitsch, 1974; Mateer, 1977). ECC ozonesondes use solution concentrations that are adjusted to yield\ntotal ozone amounts that agree on the average with Dobson total ozone data (Komhyr, 1979). After\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n292\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nnormalization of the ozonesonde profiles to Dobson instrument total ozone, data from the two types of\nsondes assume the Dobson instrument systematic error referred to in an earlier section. Because of the normalization procedure used in correcting the ozonesonde data, however, systematic errors in ozonesonde\nvalues of f 5 Vo may arise corresponding to postulated secular changes of -+25 ?7o ozone amounts above 30\nin\nkm (Pittock, 1977). In addition, height-dependent, systematic measurement errors occur for the sonde above\n20 mb due to uncertainties associated with the pump efficiency factors used in processing the data.\n\nTable 6-4\nBrewer-Mast (BM) and Komhyr (ECC)* Balloon Ozonesonde Measurement Error Estimates\nType of Error\n\nEstimated Value\n\nSystematic Errors (Relative to Dobson Instrument Total\nOzone Measurements)\n(1)\n\nTrend determinations not affected:\n(a) Uncorrected data+\n\nBM\nECC\n\n(0, -25)%\n(0, -2)%\n20 mb\n\n(b) Pump correction biases at\npressure levels\n(2)\n\nBM\nECC\n\nTrend determinations affected\n(changes per decade):\n(a) Secular changes in ozone above\ntop of balloon sounding\n\nBM\nECC\n\nf 5%\n25%\n\nRandom Errors\n(3)\n\nErrors include measurement errors inherent in instrument performance, Dobson spectrophometer random\nmeasurement errors, and extrapolation (for total\nozone) errors.\n\n(a) In troposphere\n\nf 6%\n\n(b) Tropopause to 20 mb\n\n+ 4%\n\n(c) 20 mb to 5 mb\n\n-I 8%\n\n*Data apply to ECC sensors employing 1.5% KI solution.\ni-Published data are adjusted to Dobson total ozone.\n\nI\n\n10 mb\n\nI\n\n5 mb\n\nLONG PERIOD\n\nCHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n293\n\nUmkehr Observation Measurement Errors\nThe limited information available from the Umkehr method permits only the gross features of a vertical\nozone profile (resolution, - 15 km) to be inferred from an inversion of the measurement (Mateer, 1965). In\naddition to this, random errors in any one particular Umkehr measurement will introduce errors in the inferred ozone profile. Nevertheless, it is expected that a large set of observations could substantially reduce the\nlatter effects so that long-term trends in mid and upper stratospheric ozone might be reliably detected. Current estimations of the uncertainties in the Umkehr method are based upon the utilization of the Standard\nEvaluation System developed by Mateer and Diitsch (1964), which suffered because of a lack of sufficient a\npriori ozone statistics (e.g., ozonesonde and rocketsonde data) at that time. It is likely that the potential for\nthe Umkehr method to detect trends can be improved by optimizing the inversion procedure.\nThe reliabilty of ozone vertical distribution data derived from Umkehr observations depends upon observer\nskill, instrument calibration errors (including uncertainties in ozone absorption coefficients), atmospheric effects, and shortcomings in measurement data inversion procedures. (Effects of variations in the solar UV\nspectrum are eliminated in the Umkehr measurement inversion procedure.)\n\n-\n\nAerosol effects on Umkehr measurements have been investigated by DeLuisi (1969, 1979a) and DeLuisi et al.\n(1975). In general, the bias in ozone profiles due to aerosols is negative above 30 km, minimal near the major\nmaximum between 20 and 30 km, and positive below 20 km. It was shown that the inferred ozone concentrations in the 32 to 45 km atmospheric layer were probably low by about 10% in the Northern Hemisphere at\nthe time when stratospheric aerosols reached a peak optical depth following the eruption of Agung. In the\ncase of tropospheric aerosols, the Umkehr error sensitivity is about one order of magnitude less (per optical\ndepth) than the error sensitivity to stratospheric aerosols.\nBecause the ozone absorption coefficients for the Dobson wavelengths are moderately temperaturedependent, some error bias can be expected in the Umkehr ozone profiles. DeLuisi (1971) investigated\ntemperature induced errors in Umkehr profiles for midlatitude summer and winter standard atmospheres.\nFor an integrated total ozone amount of 0.344 atm-cm, he estimated that if summer-to-winter temperature\nchanges are neglected in the reduction of Umkehr data, average errors of 2% to 3% in layers 2 to 8 and 5% in\nlayer 9 appear in computed Umkehr ozone amounts. For trend estimates, in which the annual cycle is removed, these errors are assumed to be comparable to Dobson errors.\nShortcomings in the inversion procedure can be listed under two categories: those that are correctable to some\nextent, such as effects of surface reflectivity, temperature, aerosols, and approximations in radiative transfer\ncalculations; and those due to the inherent non-uniqueness problem encountered in the inversion of most integral equations.\nSome attempts to empirically evaluate the accuracy of Umkehr observations (Bojkov, 1966; Craig et al.,\n1967; Diitsch and Ling, 1969) have shown that the Standard Evaluation System retrievals give less ozone at\nthe major maximum, but more ozone above and below the maximum, in comparison with ozone profiles\nmeasured concurrently with ozonesondes. In a study comparing Umkehr and ozonesonde observations at\nArosa, Aspendale and Tallahassee, DeLuisi and Mateer (1971) obtained better agreement in Umkehr and\nozonesonde data by using improved a priori statistics derived from 511 ozone soundings made in Boulder.\nIt is apparent from the foregoing discussion that systematic and random errors for Umkehr observations are\ndifficult to assess. Table 6-5 gives provisional estimates for measurement errors. To obtain an estimate of the\neffect of random errors on deduced Umkehr profiles, DeLuisi (1979bj perturbed Umkehr measurement data\nwith assumed measurement errors of 1% and 10%. Resulting root mean square deviations derived from the\nerror-free and the perturbed data profiles are shown in figure 6-l. If an all-encompassing measurement error\nof + 5% is assumed for Umkehr observations, the measurement precision may be deduced, from figure 6-1,\nto be + 25% at 100 mb, * 10% at 50 mb, + 5% at 20 and 10 mb, and f 6% at 5 mb, with the errors gradually\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n294\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nincreasing to f 12% at 1.5 mb. This implies, for example, that real changes in ozone at 20 and 10 mb, of\nmagnitude somewhat greater than +5% and of at least 10 km vertical extent may be detectable by the\nUmkehr technique.\n\nTable 6-5\nUmkehr Ozone Profile Measurement Error Estimates\nType of Error\n\nEstimated Value\n\nSystematic Errors\n\n(1) Trend determinations not affected\n(a) Absorption coefficient uncertainties\n(2)\n\nlab meas. errors\n\nTrend determinations affected\n(a) Stratospheric temp. changes @40 km\n\nf 0.5%\n\n(b) Wavelength calibration errors\n\n1% per 1% error in\nabsorption coeff.\n\n(c) Solar spectrum changes\n\nNone\n\n(d) Ozone profile changes during 3-hour measurement time\n\nconstant bias if\nchange is regular\n\n(e) Changes in aerosol optical depth (T), error @40 km\n(i)\n\nStratospheric, Agung size event (7 = 0.02)\n\n(ii) Tropospheric aerosols, T = 0.2\n\n(0, - lO)%\n(0, - 4)%\n\nRandom Errors\n(3)\n\nAssuming an unbiased estimation and 5% random\nerrors in Dobson measurement\n(a) 20 km (layer 3)\n\nf. 15%\n\n(b) 30 km (layer 6)\n\n+ 7%\n\n(c) 40 km (layer 8)\n\n_+\n9%\n\n$I,\n295\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\nI\n9\n\n_\n\n(1%) \xe2\x80\x98(IO,,\n\n.ea!urement\n\nI\n\nI\n\nErlor\n\n1.4\n2.7\n\n8\n\n5.5\n11\n22\n44\n89\n178\n500\n\n1\n0\n\n!\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nPercent rms deviation\nFigure 6-l.\n\n1000\n70\n\nin ozone partial pressure\n\nUmkehr ozone profile root mean square deviations resulting from perturbations of idealized,\nerror-free Umkehr measurements with 1% and 10% measurement errors (DeLuisi, 1979b).\n\nRocket OzonesondeMeasurement Errors\nU.S. Optical Ozonesonde\nOptical ozonesondes are absolute sensors which measure the UV light absorption by ozone per unit height as\nthe instrument ascends or descends through the atmosphere (Krueger et al., 1979b). Systematic errors are suppressed by measurement of the ratio of fluxes in wavelength pairs. Thus, internal sensitivity changes and external wavelength-independent influences are cancelled in the measurement, as in Dobson spectrophotometer\nmeasurements. However, unlike the Dobson technique, an absolute calibration is not required since the ozone\ndensity is computed from changes in ratio with altitude. The principal source of bias is due to errors in\nlaboratory measurements of ozone absorption coefficients.\nRandom errors are of two types: (1) telemetry and photometer noise, and (2) effective absorption coefficient\nerrors. The noise levels are equivalent to 1 to 470 random errors in ozone density for 2 km vertical resolution\nbetween 20 and 45 km, but can grow rapidly outside this altitude span. The largest source of error between individual instruments is due to instability of filter characteristics caused by aging and environmental conditions. These errors can be kept small through quality control of instruments and by minimizing the time\n\n296\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n.PRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nbetween calibration and flight. The extent of filter change varies with production batch, but all changesappear to be in the samedirection. Nominal biasesin ozone determination for a recent, worst-case, batch with 3\nto 6 month intervals between calibration and flight are -2.970, -1\xe2\x80\x9970, and -8% at 30, 40, and 50 km,\nrespectively, at the lo level. These filter changeshave affected approximately 10% of all the optical rocket\nsoundings. The resulting errors, adjusted for fraction of instruments affected, are listed in table 6-6.\nTable 6-6\nRocket Ozonesonde Measurement Error Estimates\nEstimated Value\n\nType of Error\n\nAltitude Level\n\nSystematic Errors\n30 km\n(1)\n\n50 km\n\nTrend determinations not affected:\nozone absorption spectrum errors\n\nOptical (Krueger)\nChemiluminescent* (Hilsenrath)\n(2)\n\n40 km\n\n2 12%\n\n?12%\n\nk 12%\n\nTrend determinations affected\n(change per decade):\n* 0.5%\n\n+ 0.2%\n\n* 0.05%\n\n(a) Telemetry and sampling\n\n+ 2.5%\n\n+ I .5%\n\n(variable)\n+ I to 20%\n\n(b) Filter calibrations, aging\n\n(O,-0.3)%\n\n(O,-0.7)%\n\n(c) Filter calibrations, other\ncomponents\n\n_+1%\n\nf 1%\n\nf2%\n\n+ 3%\n\n* 3%\n\n+ 3%\n\n(a) Optical-ozone abs. coef. affected\nby stratospheric temperature\nchanges.\nRandom Errors\n(3)\n\nNoise and calibration errors, not\nincluding radar errors\nOptical (Krueger)\n\n(O,-0.8)%\n\nChemiluminescent (Hilsenrath)\n(a) Telemetry and sampling\n(b) Calibration\n\n*Includes uncertainty in the ozone absorption coefficient at 254 nm.\n\nLONG PERIOD\n\nCHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n297\n\nSoundings with larger biases are eliminated from the data set by virtue of an internal consistency test applied\nin the data processing. Although a relatively small number of soundings are affected by this particular filter\nbatch, all were launched in 1978 and 1979 and may result in a perturbation in a trend line. Additional calibration errors due to variations in other optical components are estimated to be + 1% at 30 and 40 km and f 2%\nat 50 km.\nU.S. Chemiluminescent\n\nOtonesonde\n\nThe chemiluminescent method is not absolute, and each instrument is calibrated by repeated exposure to\nknown ozone concentrations at air pressures and flow rates expected in flight (Hilsenrath et al., 1979b).\nSystematic errors in chemiluminescent ozonesondes arise from: (1) ozone absorption coefficient errors at\n253.7 nm as used in the calibration standard, (2) nonlinearities in the chemiluminescence process, and (3)\nozone losses in the instrument. These errors are estimated to be + 12%.\nRandom errors in this sensor are due to sensor and telemetry noise and to flow modulation caused by\nparachute oscillations. These errors are about &3% between&and 60 km. The standard error from the\nLO\nrepeated calibrations is typically @%.\n5\n\nBUV Ozone Profile Measurement Errors\nThe ozone profile measurements from the Nimbus type BUV instrument are susceptible to several different\ntypes of errors including both systematic and random errors; the latter including instrument errors and\nalgorithmic errors. The algorithmic errors include first guess related errors, uncertainties due to limited\naltitude resolution, and profile uncertainties due to the use of wavelengths scattered in the troposphere.\nTable 6-7 summarizes the profile measurement error estimates for the BUV instrument.\nThe following\n\nnotes explain the error information\n\ncontained in table 6-7.\n\n(la)\n\n(lb)\n\nInstrument errors - A wavelength independent 1% error in instrument radiometric calibration will\ncause approximately 1.7% error in the mixing ratio for layers between 1 and 3 mb. The error will\nbecome progressively smaller as one goes down to lo-20 mb. Again, a wavelength dependent error is\nmore serious as it distorts the retrieved profile.\n\n(2)\n\nI-\n\nOzone absorption coefficient uncertainties - The retrieval of ozone profiles from backscattered\nultraviolet radiance requires an accurate knowledge of ozone absorption coefficients. A constant\npercentage error in all wavelengths will cause a scaling of the retrieved profile with only minor changes\nin the shape. Wavelength dependent errors in absorption coefficients are more serious. A 1% error in a\nsingle wavelength absorption coefficient will change the mixing ratio (or partial pressure) by approximately 1% in the layer in which that wavelength weighting function peaks. Since the peaks of\nweighting functions shift with solar zenith angle, such anomalous effects are indistinguishable from\nreal changes in the profile with latitude.\n\nThe long-term radiometric stability of the BUV instrument is more crucial for profile determination\nthan it is for total ozone determination. Moreover, any long-period changes in the solar flux in the 250\nthrough 300 nm wavelength bands must be accurately monitored. For the Nimbus-4 BUV, the solar\nflux monitoring system failed shortly after launch. Approximately 5% changes in the short wavelength\natmospheric radiances have been detected over a period of seven years. It cannot be established with\nany certainty whether these changes were due to (1) a shift in the instrument calibration; (2) a change in\n\n298\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nthe solar flux; or (3) changes in the upper level atmospheric ozone. Several design changes affecting\ncalibration stability, implemented in the recently launched SBUV instrument, have worked, and it is\nbelieved that the long-term SBUV instrument calibration can be maintained to a few percent.\n(3a)\n\nInstrument noise - A 1% instrument noise in all channels will cause about 3% noise in layers between 1\nand 3 mb. For lower layers, the effect will decrease to about 1.5% at 10 mb. For the Nimbus-4 BUV,\nthe estimated la noise is about 1%. For the Nimbus-7 SBUV. the noise is about 0.5%.\n\nTable 6-7\nBUV Ozone Profile Measurement Error Estimates\nType of Error\n\nEstimated Value\n\nSystematic Errors\n(1)\n\nTrend determinations not affected:\n(a) Absorption coefficient uncertainties\n(b) Bias due to first guesserrors\n\n(2)\n\nlab meas. errors\n<O.S%(upper)*\n< 1% (lower)*\n\nTrend determinations affected (change per decade):\n(a) 0s abs. coeff. affected by temperature changes\n\nf 0.5%\n\n(b) Relative calib. error between instruments\n\n<3%\n\n(c) Solar spectrum changes\n\n< S%(Nimbus-4)\n\n(d) Uncorrected calibration drifts\n\n< 1O%(Nimbus-4)\n\nRandom Errors\n(a) Noise and telemetry\n\nT 2%\n\n(b) Cloud and surface reflectivity errors\n\n0 (upper)\n+ 1% (lower)\n\n(c) Multiple scattering uncertainties\n\n0 (upper)\n+ 3% (lower)\n\n(d) First guess related errors\n\n(3)\n\n+ 3% (upper)\n+ 6% (lower)\n\n*Note:\n\nUpper profde levels extend from 35 to 50 km, lower levels are from 25 to 35 km.\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES\n\n(3b)\n\nAlgorithmic\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n299\n\nErrors - Includes three types as follows:\n\n(9\n\nFirst guess related - The BUV profile algorithm starts with a climatological profile as a first\nguess. Although the retrieved profiles are first guess dependent, the exact magnitude of this\ndependence and the error caused by it are difficult to-quantify. From a simulation study based\non realistic profiles, a reasonable estimate of la error is f 3% in mixing ratio at each layer\nwithin the range of information (- 1 to 10 mb). Outside the range at which the wavelength contribution functions peak, the retrieved profiles are constrained to the first guess and, as such,\nthe errors there will increase to the natural variance of the ozone in those layers. However, it\nshould be noted that for layers between 20 and 40 mb, the first guess variances are smaller than\nthe natural variance because the first guess is selected using the total ozone as a predictor.\n\n(ii)\n\nUncertainties due to limited altitude resolution - The half width of the weighting functions for\nthe BUV profiling wavelengths is about 15 km. Therefore, the BUV can detect only the fluctuations in the profile that occur over comparable heights. When compared to high resolution\nmeasuring systems (e.g., rockets) the BUV will underestimate the natural variance in the layers.\n\n(iii)\n\nProfile errors arise due to the use of wavelengths at which tropospheric scattering is important\nsince the longer wavelengths used with the BUV (295 nm) penetrate the stratospheric ozone\nlayer. Use of these wavelengths in profile retrieval requires accounting for multiple scattering,\nsurface reflectivity, and cloud and terrain height. The BUV profiling algorithm has been\ncarefully designed to account for these effects. However, when it is determined that the uncertainty in the retrieved profile, using a particular wavelength, exceeds a maximum of & 7070,that\nwavelength is not used in the profile determination. This restricts the retrievable information\nfrom BUV at low latitudes to levels between 1 and 7 mb. At higher latitudes, all wavelengths up\nto 305.8 nm are used to derive profiles which are valid from .7 to 20 mb.\n\nOBSERVED TRENDS IN OZONE\nTRENDS FROM GROUND BASED OBSERVATIONS\nThe ground based total ozone data set covers a longer time span than any other ozone data set and has been\nanalyzed extensively for long-period variations. Ozone studies, based on combined data from stations,\ngrouped by regions or the hemispheres, have been used for these analyses (Angel1 and Korshover 1976, 1978d;\nKomhyr et al., 1973; London and Kelly, 1974; Hill et al., 1977). These data have been smoothed in time and\nspace to reduce the noise. By examining the observed variations, evidence was sought for the effects of solar\nactivity, volcanic eruptions and atomic tests, and of linkage with other variables such as surface pressure, and\nrecently, with CFM releases.\nAn example of such an analysis is given in figure 6-2 which shows the variation in total ozone between 1958\nand 1977, for north and south temperate latitudes, the tropics, and the world. The north temperate average\nhas been estimated from a 3, 3,2, 1, 1 weighting of regional values for Europe, North America, Soviet Union,\nJapan, and India, respectively. The tropical average comes from about five stations scattered around the\nEquator. The south temperate average is derived from stations mostly in the Australia-New Zealand region.\nThe world average results from a 1-3-4-3-l weighting of north polar (not shown), north temperate, tropical,\nsouth temperate, and south polar (not shown) regions. The vertical bars extend two standard deviations from\nthe mean.\nAs has been documented previously (NASA RP-1010) there was a notable increase in total ozone in the Northern Hemisphere during the 196Os, reaching a peak about 1970. This variation was not observed at south\ntemperate latitudes. The estimated global variations shown in the bottom curve of figure 6-2 indicates an\n\nI -.-\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n300\n\n6\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPRESENT\n\nt\n4-\n\n2-\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-4\n\n-\n\n4\n\nNorth\nTemperate\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2-\n\nTropics\n\no-\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-4\n\n-\n\n4-\n\n2-\n\nSouth\nTemperate\n\nO-\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-4\n\n-\n\n4-\n\n2-\n\nWorld\n\nO-\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-4\n\n-\n\n-6\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\nI 958\n\nI\n1962\n\nI\n1966\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1974\n\n1970\n\nI\n1978\n\nYEAR\n\nFigure 6-2.\n\nTime variation of the annual mean percentage deviation from the long-term regional average\ntotal ozone for north and south temperate zones and the tropics for the years from 1958\nthrough 1977.

The 1977 global average total ozone is approximately 1% above the longterm average.\n\nTRENDS FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS\nTotal ozone observations from the Nimbus-4 BUV instrument have been analyzed for changes during its\nseven years of operation. Global mean amounts were computed from area-weighted zonal mean values and an\nestimate of polar night values. Sufficient data were obtained to compute monthly global averages almost until\nthe end of 1976. These observations are shown in figure 6-3. Beyond 1976, satellite operations became intermittent. Although both hemispheres are included, an annual cycle is still present due to hemispheric differences in their annual cycles. From this record, it is obvious that the seasonal variation (about 13 matm-cm)\nis dominated by the spring maximum of the annual wave in the Northern Hemisphere. However, over the\nseven-year data set a definite downward trend can be distinguished.\n\n,\n\nThe analysis of ground-based data shown in figure 6-2 indicates that, during the time period of BUV observations on Nimbus-4, the Dobson-derived global ozone decreased by 0.8% between 1970 and 1973, remained\nconstant for the next several years and then may have increased 0.2% by 1977. The BUV Nimbus-4 observations, after the removal of the annual wave, indicate a decrease of about 2.5% during the corresponding\nperiod from 1970 to 1973, and a gradual decrease thereafter of about 0.2% per year. Qualitatively, these data\nsets indicate a tendency for ozone decreases after 1970; however, the reasons for the differences in year-toyear fluctuations are not known at this time.\nDuring the period between 1970 and 1978, there were four satellite instruments which operated long enough\nto permit computation of monthly mean global ozone amounts. The experiments which span this region are\nthe IRIS and BUV, both flown on Nimbus-4, the Multifilter Radiometer (MFR) flown on a Block 5 satellite,\nand the SBUV on Nimbus-7. Tables 6-8a and 6-8b are comparisons for the monthly mean global amounts\nfrom the various experiments for the months of June and November. Unfortunately, the reported MFR data\nare not coincident with BUV data and a direct comparison is not possible.\nThe global ozone values shown for the IRIS experiment were listed in the study by Keating (1978). In June\n1970, the global ozone value from IRIS was 4% higher than that derived from BUV observations. In\nNovember 1970, IRIS was about 6% higher. This is not inconsistent with the analysis of Prabhakara et al.,\n(1976) which showed that the 9.7pm ozone retrievals have a seasonally-dependent bias.\nPreliminary hemispheric and global ozone values obtained from the SBUV experiment for November 1978\nare also shown in table 6-8b. It is interesting to note that the Northern Hemisphere ozone is virtually identical\nto the 1970 BUV value, but the Southern Hemisphere ozone has increased by about 12 matm-cm. This seems\nto provide additional evidence that there are significant interannual hemispheric differences in the ozone\nbudget. In order to have the maximum sensitivity for the detection of global scale trends with the existing instrumentation, it is necessary both to monitor global ozone from space, and to maintain a high quality ground\nbased network with the proper geographic distribution.\n\n2\n\n8\n\n$\n\nz\nE\n6\nw\n\n.26\n\n.2?\n\n.28\n\n.29\n\n.30\n\n.31\n\n.32\n\nJa\n\nError\n\nI\n\nJI\n\nOc\n1971\n\nAp\n\nJI\n\nFigure 6-3.\n\nJa\n\nOc\n\nAp\n1972\n\nJI\n\nOc\n\nJa\n\nI\n\nJI\n1973\n\nAp\n\nOc\n\nENTIRE\n\nYEAR\n\nJa\n\nAp\n\nGLOBE\n\nI\n\n1974\n\nJI\n\nOc\n\nI\n\nJa Ap\n\n1975\n\nJI\n\nOc\n\nI\n\nJa\n\n1976\n\nAp\n\nJI\n\nOc\n\nd\nI\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\n\nJa\n\nvariation of global average total ozone amounts derived from Nimbus-4 BUV\ndata from April 1970 through December 1976.\nTime\n\nJa\n\nUncertainty\nfrom Extrapolation\n(if larger than standard error)\n\nStandard\n\n1970\n\nAp\n\n:\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1977\n\nAp\n\nJI Oc\n\nI\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\n303\n\nTable 6-8a\nHemispheric and Global Ozone for June\nHemisphere/\nGlobal\n\n(Year)\n70\n\n72\n\n71\n\n73\n\n75\n\n74\n\n77\n\n76\n\n78\n\nNimbus-4BUV\nN.

A comparison of long-term ozone changes has been made using\nballoon ozonesonde and Umkehr data (Angel1 and Korshover, 1979).\nUmkehr networks exist in Europe (about 5 stations), India (about 3 stations), and Japan (3 stations). A north\ntemperate average has been estimated from a 2-l-l weighting of the respective regional values. For the\nSouthern Hemisphere, data have been taken for many years at several stations in Australia, but the data are\nlargely unprocessed.\n\n304\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nFor comparison with the Umkehr measurements in the 8 to 16, 16 to 24,24 to 32 and 32 to 46 km layers, mean\nozone values from balloon sondes have been determined for 8 to 16, 16 to 24 and 24 to 32 km layers. Mean\nozone values also have been determined for the mid-troposphere, or the approximately 2 to 8 km layer.\nOzonesonde networks exist in North America (5 stations), Europe (about 5 stations) and Japan (3 stations),\nand Australia. A north temperate average has been estimated from a 2-2-l weighting of the respective regional\nNorthern Hemisphere values.\nFigure 6-4 shows the derived ozone variations in given height layers for north temperate latitudes. The vertical\nbars represent 95% confidence intervals. For ease of comparison, the vertical dashed line at the right shows\nthe initial year of the ozonesonde record. The Umkehr data suggest an increase in ozone amount in all layers\nduring the years between 1962 and 1970. In the 32 to 46 km layer of greatest sensitivity to anthropogenic effects, there appears to be a significant decrease in ozone between 1974 and 1975. This apparent decrease is\nbelieved to be mostly, if not entirely, an artifact due to biases introduced into the Umkehr technique by\nstratospheric aerosols from the volcano Fuego (Guatemala) eruption in the autumn of 1974 (DeLuisi et al.,\n1975) (Note the absence of an effect in the 24 to 32 km layer). In 1976 and 1977, the ozone amount in the 32 to\n46 km layer increases again, presumably reflecting the decrease of the stratospheric aerosols. Because of the\nFuego eruption, it is difficult to ascertain whether there has been any real decrease in ozone in the sensitive 32\nto 46 km layer since 1970. If there has been a decrease, it has been very small. The ozone amount in this layer\nin 1977 was still almost 4% above the 18-year data set average. However, aerosols from the Agung eruption\nmay have biased the average in the same way Fuego aerosols decreased the yearly values after 1974.\nIn the 24 to 32 km layer, both ozonesondes and Umkehr measurements suggest little ozone variation after\n1969. The small extent of the vertical bars indicates the considerable consistency among station values in this\nheight interval.\nIn the 16 to 24 km layer, the ozonesonde data suggest a 3 to 4% ozone decrease between 1969 and 1977\n(superimposed on a strong quasi-biennial oscillation), while the Umkehr data indicate a smaller decrease, with\neven some evidence of a recent ozone increase.\nIn the 8 to 16 km layer, bracketing the tropopause, the discrepancy between ozonesonde and Umkehr trends\nbecomes more obvious, although the greater spatial variability of ozone in this layer may contribute to the\ndifference. The indicated 8% increase in mid-tropospheric ozone over the period of record is noted with interest, but is not discussed further here except to note that the increase has been large in industrialized Europe\nand Japan, and small in the rural areas of Canada (where most of the North American network stations are\nlocated). Ozonesonde data from Aspendale (38 \xe2\x80\x9cS) show a decrease in the lower stratosphere and an increase\nabove the 30 km level (Pittock 1974; Kulkarni, 1979).\nTo examine the consistency between total ozone trend and the trends aloft determined from ozonesondes and\nUmkehr measurements, figure 6-5 presents a comparison of the respective variations, where a 1-2-2-l\nweighting has been applied to Umkehr values in 8 to 16, 16 to 24, 24 to 32 and 32 to 46 km layers (weighting\nproportional to relative ozone amount) to obtain an integrated ozone value, and a l-2-2 weighting to\nozonesonde values in the 8 to 16, 16 to 24 and 24 to 32 km layers to obtain an integrated ozone value. After\n1970, the trends are similar, although the integrated ozonesonde values suggest a slightly greater ozone\ndecrease, and the integrated Umkehr values a slightly smaller ozone decrease, than shown by the total ozone\nvalues. The greater increase of integrated Umkehr value than total ozone value, prior to 1970, presumably is\ndue to artifacts in the Umkehr technique resulting from the Agung eruption in 1963.\n\nObserved Ozone Variations from Rocket Data\nAlthough rocket measurements of ozone have been made over a 30-year time span, most of the data have\nbeen collected at essentially random times of the day and year. For a trend estimate, it is necessary to know\n\n305\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\nUMKEHR\n\nOZONESONDE\n\na\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4o-4\n\nFuego\n\n-8 -\n\n-8 -\n\n-8\n8\n4\n0\n-4\n-8\n\n8\n\nT\n\nI-\n\n2-8\n\nkm\n\n1\n.12\n\n1\n\nI\n1970\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1974\n\n1978\n\nI\n1962\n\nI\n1966\n\nI\n1970\n\nI\n1974\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1978\n\nYEAR\n\nFigure 6-4.\n\nI -.\n\nTime variation of the annual mean percentage deviation from long-term averages of ozone\npartial pressure for five altitude zones in the north temperate region.

An estimate of the global average vertical ozone\ndistribution and its variability has been made from early data (Krueger, 1973). The mean distribution at nor- .\nthern midlatitudes was calculated for the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere (Krueger and Minzner, 1976).\nDiurnal ozone changes have been measured by Hilsenrath (1971) who finds a day-to-night increase above 47\nkm, but a decrease at lower altitudes at Wallops Island, Virginia. Krueger (private communication) has investigated local time effects on high altitude ozone and finds 10 to 15% increases from morning to afternoon\nnear the mixing ratio maximum (35 km), and similar decreases near 50 km.\nWatanabe and Tohmatsu (1976) find seasonal changes at all altitudes above 30 km, with winter ozone densities at 50 km at Kagoshima City, Japan being a factor of two greater than summer densities. Krueger and\nWright (private communication),\nfrom a series of 35 monthly flights at local noon at Wallops Island,\nVirginia, find much smaller seasonal changes with winter mixing ratios at the 1 mb level exceeding summer\nvalues by 35%. The phase of the maximum was found to vary with altitude so that highest mixing ratios at 10\nmb appear in summer. Fifty percent changes in the mesospheric ozone profile due to solar protons have been\nfound in rocket observations by Weeks, Cuikay and Corbin (1972), and Hilsenrath recently found similar\nchanges associated with a magnetic substorm (see Chapter 5 of this report).\nThese various effects are larger than the anthropogenic effects being sought in a trend analysis. To make use\nof the entire set of rocket measurements, one must have a determination of at least the seasonal and diurnal\nvariations as a function of latitude. The Wallops Island data set is providing an initial estimate of seasonal\nchanges at midlatitudes, and some information is becoming available for high latitudes (Fort Churchill,\nManitoba) from a 20-month series of monthly flights.\nThe minimum change in ozone that can be detected from a random set of noontime flights can be estimated if\nthe variability is known. Figure 6-6 illustrates the percentage variability in ozone mixing ratio and number\ndensity as a function of air pressure, for the Wallops Island data set. Of particular interest is a minimum\nvariability (- 10%) in the 3 to 5 mb region, near the level of maximum predicted CFM effects. This occurs\njust above the level where the mixing ratio variability becomes less than the density variability, as might be expected in the transition from dynamic to photochemical control of ozone.\nObserved Ozone Profile Variations\n\nfrom Satellite Data\n\nStratospheric ozone data of global extent have been obtained from satellites since the late 1960s. These data\nhave come from seven separate sensors, using three different techniques as listed earlier in table 6-1. Except\nfor the Nimbus-4 BUV data set, each instrument acquired data over a time span that is very much less than a\ndecade (a few months to one and one-half years). For the earlier flights, the data sets do not overlap in time, a\nfactor needed to assess calibration differences. The data processing for recent flights is not yet completed.\nThus, at the present time, an objective assessment of the trend over the last decade cannot be made by combining the satellite data sets. The Nimbus-4 BUV results, which extend for a seven-year period, have the\npotential for precise determination of variations in the global mean ozone concentrations near the 40 km level\nof maximum CFM depletions. Final BUV data production was completed in November, 1979. The interpretation of the observed variations in terms of trends is problematical due to the present uncertainty in long-term\ninstrument stability as noted earlier in this chapter. It remains to be seen whether new techniques for determination of sensitivity changes can be devised. Based on early results, the Nimbus-7 SBUV appears to be\nquite stable since it was improved to avoid contamination effects, and contained internal devices to measure\nsensitivity changes.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n308\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n//\n\n55\n\n/\xe2\x80\x99\n1\xe2\x80\x99\n\\/\n\n50\n\nI Mixing\n\nRatio\n\n-\n\nI\n\nNumber\n\nDensity\n15\n\n40\n\nH\nY\nis\n\n.\n2\nu\nw\n5\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n100\n5%\n\n15%\n\n10%\nPERCENT\n\nFigure 6-6.\n\n20%\n\n25%\n\n30%\n\nVARIABILITY\n\nObserved percentage variability of ozone mixing ratio and ozone density versus air pressure\nin the stratosphere and lower mesosphere derived from optical rocket ozonesonde flights at\nWallops Island, Va.

Similar trends during this period were found in independent studies by\nAngel1 and Korshover (1978a; b) from analyses of radiosonde and Western Hemisphere rocketsonde (Angel1\nand Korshover, 1978c) data taken during the period from 1964 to 1976. Results from the latter reference are\nshown in figure 6-7, in which seasonal data have been binomially smoothed after removal of the annual\noscillation. A downward trend is clearly evident in the low latitude data, throughout the period in the lower\nstratosphere, and starting from solar maximum in the upper stratosphere. The trends are similar in the north\npolar regions for the middle and upper stratosphere, but upward in the lower stratosphere. Figure 6-8 shows\nthe Angel1 and Korshover analysis, with error bars, of the 100 to 30 mb (16 to 24 km) layer in more detail, and\nwith an extended period, from 1958 to 1977, separately for the equatorial (10s to lON), north subtropical\n(10N to 30N), north temperate (30N to 60N) and north polar (60N to 90N) regions. The solid curves are again\nbinomially smoothed values, and the ordinates for the north polar data are compressed by a factor of two.\nThe years of the Agung (March 1963) and Fuego (September 1974) eruptions are marked by arrows below the\nnorth subtropics curve, which suggests that the downward trend may be due to a gradual settling of Agung\ndust.\nFigure 6-9 shows the downward trend in the Northern Hemisphere monthly mean temperatures at 50, 100 and\n200 mb for the period between 1964 and 1973, as analyzed by Oort (private communication, 1979) from the\nglobal rawinsonde network after removal of the seasonal variations.\nThe cause or causes of these observed temperature decreases are still unknown. Quiroz (1979a) has calculated\nhigh correlations between mean annual sunspot numbers and yearly temperature departures at 35 and 50 km,\nbut warns that \xe2\x80\x9cit remains to be seen whether the relationships seen in solar cycle 20 hold in cycle 21.\xe2\x80\x9d Quiroz\n(1979b) also points out that satellite data from 1969 on can perhaps be used to substantiate trends found from\nrocket measurements. In general, much care should be taken to insure continuity of calibrated measurements\nand their interpretation. Careful analysis of the wind field should be carried out to see whether temperature\nchanges at the tropopause level have dynamical consequences predicted from circulation model sensitivity\nstudies (e.g., Fels and Kaplan, 1975). Trends in the wind field are more difficult to see through the noise than\nare those of temperature, and most correlations found between motion fields in the stratosphere and\ntroposphere can more easily be explained by tropospheric influence on the stratosphere than vice versa.\nTRENDS IN TRACE SPECIES\nThis section discusses long-term measured variations for several trace species. Many other species, whose\nglobal abundances are suspected to have undergone long period changes (e.g., CO, H,, OH, and stratospheric\nClO,), have not been included because few data that can be used to quantify trends are available. (It may be\npossible to estimate a trend for CO from available solar and planetary spectra). Table 6-9 summarizes the\ndata discussed below in terms of percent changes.\n\nh-\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n310\n\n5\n\nWESTERN\nHEMISPHERE\n- NORTH\n,,\n..,,\n,.,..,.,\n\nPOLAR\n\nWESTERN\nHEMISPHERE\n5\n,,,,,,I,,*,,II.I,\n4 .\n\n- NORTH\n\nSUBTROPICS\n\n6-7b\n\n6-7~ :\n\n-1 -2\n\n46.56\n\n-\n\nkm\n\n36-45 km\n\n26.35\n\nkm\n\n16-24 km\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\nWC-16\n1980\n\nFigure 6-7a.

Recent trend estimates are given in table 6-9. The errors associated with these trend estimates have\nnot always been quantified, but the rate of increase is consistent with the rate of increase of emissions\n(- 20ppt/yr) from 1975 to 1977 (CMA, 1979). As an indication of the absolute errors in the measurements,\nthe range of calibration errors among 16 laboratories has been found to be +26% for CF,Cl, (Rasmussen,\n1978b). Consequently, trends computed from a combination of different data sets would be uncertain within\nthese limits.\nCFCl, has been measured in the troposphere since 1971 (Lovelock et al., 1973; Lovelock, 1974) and it is clear\nthat the tropospheric concentration has been increasing. Recent estimates for the rate of growth are given in\ntable 6-9. Most researchers are in general agreement with regard to the magnitude of recent increases, which\nseem consistent with the corresponding emissions data (about 13 ppt/yr for 1975 to 1977, CMA, 1979). The\nerrors associated with the trend estimates of Goldan et al. (1979) and Komhyr (1979) are standard errors\nderived from a linear regression analysis. The true errors are larger for a variety of reasons. Calibration standards may drift over long periods of time and spatial variability (particularly large near emission sources) affects measurement results. In most cases, reliable estimates of these errors are not available, but they need to\nbe quantified in order to validate model estimates of the fate of these species in the atmosphere. Absolute\ncalibrations vary by + 18% (Rasmussen, 1978b).\nIn situ stratospheric measurements of CFCl, and CF,Cl, date from 1973 (Heidt et al., 1975). The available\nmeasurements are fewer than in the troposphere and the natural variability larger, making accurate trend\nestimates much more difficult. A comparison of 1968 infrared data with data obtained in 1975 showed that\nboth CFCl, and CF,Cl, increased by more than a factor of 2 in the stratosphere, (Murcray et al., 1975b).\nHowever, the relative error in the August 1968 data limits the accuracy of the determination of the long-term\ntrend. The 1968 data have a precision of only +20% The September 1975 results are reliable to ?I 5%.\n\nCCI,\nCarbon tetrachloride was measured by Lovelock\xe2\x80\x99s group from 1972 to the end of 1975. The estimated trends\nfrom these early measurements, as well as more recent measurements, appear in table 6-9. These trend\nestimates are probably not statistically significant, due to the sparseness of data and general difficulty of\nmeasuring Ccl, (a 9 laboratory intercomparison revealed differences of +63%, Rasmussen, 1978b).\n\nCH,CCI,\nFewer measurements for CH,CCl, are available than for either CFCl,, CF,Cl, or CC!,. The recent rate of increase of methyl chloroform has been estimated by various researchers in table 6-9. This species is more difficult to measure than the other halocarbons (in a 9 laboratory intercomparison, the range of errors was\n+63% Rasmussen, 1978b). In addition, it is more difficult to maintain stable standards, and its spatial\nvariability is larger. Thus, an accurate trend cannot be estimated at present.\n\nWeiss (private communication) reported preliminary results which suggest an increase of 0.5 ppb/yr between\n1977 and 1979. These data were acquired at the NOAA Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change\n(GMCC) stations in the Pacific and Antarctica. Although the data base is not yet sufficient to accurately\nestablish the trend, the rate of increase is consistent with the rise since 1961, inferred (Weiss et al., 1977) from\nstored samples of COzand N,O, which had been extracted from samples of Pacific air. Goldan et al. (1979)\n\nLONG PERIOD\n\nCHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n315\n\nobserved an upward trend of N,O in upper-tropospheric air samples which were obtained over Wyoming between 1977 and 1979. Their data are also too few to accurately determine the rate of increase, but their observations (3.2 ppb/yr) do not appear to be inconsistent with Weiss\xe2\x80\x99 measurements.\nThe existing background observations of N,O represent a period too short to accurately determine a longterm trend, although three data sets suggest a slow increase. The quantification of any global change is one of\nthe key problems in the N,O budget, and the background studies are therefore extremely important.\nc*4\n\nMethane observations exist from 1948 to the present. From 1948 to 1966, measurements were made of telluric\nabsorption of solar infrared radiation (Migeotte, 1948; Goldberg, 1951; Fink et al., 1967). These data may be\ninterpreted as showing a methane abundance of 1.5 to 1.6 ppmv, with error bounds which are hard to\nestimate. Equivalent width determinations are influenced by instrumental and subjective factors which make\nit difficult to quantitatively compare present-day and past measurements of methane infrared absorption.\nGas-chromatographic measurements of CH4commenced in 1968, indicating mixing ratios of 1.4 to 1.7 ppmv.\nEhhalt and Heidt (unpublished work, 1979) maintained consistent calibration gases between 1970 and 1979.\nThey report approximately 1.6 ppmv (corrected from earlier reports) for the atmospheric abundance of CH,\nin 1970, and about 1.65-1.70 ppmv in 1979.\nTaken together, these data rule out a methane trend larger than t- 1% per year, and they hint at a modest rate\nof increase (-0.3% per year). Since CH, may be expected to exhibit small seasonal variations, and is known\nto vary geographically (Wilkniss et al., 1973; Ehhalt, 1918a), the spot measurements currently available are\ninappropriate for determination of whatever small trends may exist. The need for baseline measurements\n(with very careful verification of sampling and analysis procedures) is clear, although no such effort appears\nto be underway.\nco2\n\nOne of the best documented of the anthropogenic changes to the global troposphere is the increase in concentration of carbon dioxide. For example, figure 6-10 shows the record of CO, data from Mauna Loa for the\nyears 1958-1978. The station site was chosen to minimize contamination by regional and local sources (or\nsinks) of CO,, and the data were acquired using a highly stable infrared analyzer subject to periodic, precise\ncalibrations (Keeling et al., 1976a, 1976b). This painstaking work produced accurate measurements of trends.\nThe observations shown in figure 6-10 confirm that the atmospheric inventory is increasing presently at a rate\nof about 2 x 1014 molecules of carbon per year (0.4%/yr). The rate of increase has itself been increasing,\nroughly doubling since the late 1950s.\nSulfur Compounds\nSulfur compounds have been measured in the stratosphere during the last two decades. Most of the\nstratospheric sulfur is present as impure sulfuric acid droplets formed largely from SO, injected from time to\ntime by large volcanic eruptions. The sulfur from any given eruption remains in the stratosphere for a year or\ntwo. Maximum stratospheric sulfate concentrations have varied from about co.01 to 3pg/m3, usually at a\nfew kilometers above the tropopause; of course, near the erupting volcano, the sulfur concentrations have\nbeen very much higher. Long-term trends of the stratospheric sulfur content can be estimated based on the extent of volcanic activity at the present time. Details may be obtained in Cadle (1972); Cadle and Grams (1975);\nCadle et al. (1976); Castleman et al. (1974); and Lamb (1970).\n\nZ\n\nppm\n\nAmal\n\n335-\n\nyr-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nthaw\n\n-\n\nE\n\n2\n\n;\n\nI,\n\n,,,6\n\n0 89\n\nBASED\n\nNOAA\n\nON\n\n0.68\n0 46\n\n1974\n\nLOA.\n\n10.641\n\n1965\nI\nIO 581\n\nMANOMETRIC\n\nHAWAII\n\n068\n\nI 1966\nI\n078\n\nI 1967\nI\n\nCALIBRATION\n\nBASELINE\n\n0.87\n\nI 1960\n#\n\nI .90\n\nI 1969\nI\n\nSTATION\n\n1.31\n\nI 1970\nI\n\nI 04\n\nI 1971\n,\n\n1.15\n\nI 1972\nI\n\n2.19\n\nI 1973\nI\n\n0 54\n\nI 1974\nI\n\n051\n\nI 1975\nt\n\n1 08\n\nI\n\n,976\nI\n\nI 58\n\nI 1977\nI\n\n1.49\n\nI 1978\n,\n\nI 1979\n1\n\nFigure 6-10.

Several questions about the state of the atmosphere necessitate regular and careful longterm measurements of key trace chemicals. First, baseline studies are needed to provide a reference against\nwhich to assess changes in the atmospheric environment. Second, it should be clear that nature\xe2\x80\x99s own\ndynamics (e.g., biospheric fluctuations) should be observed and that several types of changes are possible:\nsecular trends, cyclical behavior, and sudden or catastrophic shifts. The species that require monitoring are\ngenerally recognized. They are the long-lived molecules, such as CH,, N,O, CFzCl,, CFCl,, CH,CCl, and\nstratospheric H,O, that decompose to yield stratospheric radicals and which are also important in the infrared\nenergy budget.\nNot so well recognized is the non-automatic character of long-term measurement programs. Absolute and\nreference calibration standards must be prepared, stored, cross-referenced and propagated. Sampling\nmethods, instruments and locations must be well chosen and periodically reexamined. Instrumental drift must\nbe guarded against and quantified, and data-reduction procedures must not be changed unduly. Finally, it\nmust be recognized that continuity of personnel is needed. Thus, to succeed with this high priority item will\nrequire a proper mix of scientific talent, institutional or agency commitment, perserverance and innovative\nmanagement.\n\nWATER VAPOR TRENDS\nAlthough a number of stratospheric water vapor measurements have been carried out since the middle 1940%\nmost have been made after 1972 using a variety of techniques. There exist only two long-term series, both using the frost point-hygrometer technique (Mastenbrook 1971, 1974a, 1974b; Murgatroyd et al., 1955; Cluley\nand Oliver, 1978), and a short series by Harries (1976) using the thermal emission spectroscopy technique.\nThe systematic errors, considered reasonable, of the first technique are given as f 8 to 10% and f 20% for\nthe latter. New data on global distributions of water vapor are being collected by the Nimbus-7 SAMS and\nLIMS sensors.\nThe published measurements of Mastenbrook, made at Washington, D.C., cover the period 1964 to 1975.\nThe British MRF aircraft measurements over Southern England cover the period 1954 and 1955 and 1972 to\n1976. They were recently discontinued. Measurements were also made by Harries between 1970 and 1972\nmostly over Southern England.\nThus, all measurements available for long-term analysis are made in midlatitudes (40\xe2\x80\x9d to 55 \xe2\x80\x9cN). At the present time, nothing can be inferred about such trends in tropical, subtropical, and polar latitudes, nor of those\noccurring in the Southern Hemisphere. Whether the global water vapor concentration undergoes long-term\nvariations is still unknown. Since the British measurements are made at or below 14 km, the following discussions are restricted to the lower stratosphere.\nThe observed mixing ratio as shown in figure 6-l 1 was lowest in 1954,2.9 ppmv, and increased to 3.1 ppmv in\n1955. The Washington measurements show an increase from 1969 to 1972/73, from 3.7 to 4.8 ppmv, and a\nsteep decrease thereafter to 3.7 in 1975. The British measurement also shows a decrease from 5.4 ppmv in\n1972 to 4.7 ppmv in 1976. Harries\xe2\x80\x99 measurements show an increase from 3.4 ppmv in 1970 to 4.1 ppmv in\n1972.\nThese three independent data sets show changes larger than the measurement errors and the same general\ntendencies. Piecewise linear trends computed using regression analysis (Penndorf, 1978) are listed in table\n6-10. Since the measurements so far indicate a nonlinear variation, linear trend computations may be\n\n318\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nsomewhat misleading. If the longer-term changes are periodic neither the amplitude nor the length of the\nperiod can be established at this time. Definitive conclusions are thwarted by the lack of long, corroborative\ndata sets and the limited geographic coverage. The latter problem may be alleviated by the water vapor soundings from Nimbus-7, provided their results are validated.\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nMRF (England)\n\nA\n\nMastenbrook\n\nI7\n\nHarries\n\nw\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\nA\n\n0\n\n1970\n\n1960\n\n1980\n\nYEAR\n\nFigure 6-l 1.

In the next section the\nanalysis problem for upper stratospheric ozone is discussed. Strictly speaking any quantification of this ability must be related to the method and the data sets used in estimating a trend, and to the nature of modelers\xe2\x80\x99\npredicted trends. That is, detectability thresholds are influenced by the statistical methodology, the quality of\nthe data used, including their spatial and temporal distributions, and the uncertainty in the predicted trend.\nConsider the situation where a long meandering time series is contained in a meteorological data set. Without\nhaving any hypothesized trend, one can readily find IO-year periods in which there appears to be a trend\nrelative to the preceding record, and statistical tests would probably prove the trend to be statistically significant. One could then formulate hypotheses regarding the cause, but trend detectability has little meaning in\nsuch a context.\nOn the other hand, a significant trend may begin at some time, T, and go undetected for many years because\nthere were no reasons to suspect a change at time T. Thus, the threshold for detecting a trend beginning at a\nspecified time T, is quite different from that if no time were specified. In this discussion, trend detection\nthresholds will be based on our capability to detect a specified trend.\nWhen attempting to detect a trend due to one specified cause-such as a CFM-induced trend-the envelope of\nuncertainty related to an estimated trend in the data must be viewed relative to the envelope of uncertainty\nabout the predicted trend. If these envelopes diverge, then eventually a time will come when the data begin to\nrefute the predicted trends. Both of these uncertainty envelopes must be used in any assessment of the\nplausibility of predicted trends.\nAt the present time, global ozone determinations are derived from an ensemble of instruments, where spatial\ndistribution is not optimized, and whose calibration and quality of data varies over time and from location to\nlocation.\n\n320\n\nThe data\ncuracy of\ntration at\nstatistical\nestimated\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nbase under examination for trends thus contains several types of errors which can affect the aca trend estimate. Let x represent an ozone variable, either total column ozone or the ozone concensome level. Now let Ax be the estimated change in ozone over a IO-year period based on the best\nmethods applied to a data set extending back approximately 20 years prior to that period. This\nchange is related to the true change in global ozone over that period, Axtrue, as follows:\n\nThe term Axstat is a statistical error resulting from random noise and systematic very short-term time\ndependencies in the data base, neither of which are removed by the statistical (averaging) process. The term\nAxspat is a spatial error which results from the fact that a trend in the integrated global ozone is being\nestimated by measurements made at discrete locations *. A large amount of spatial variability exists in the\nozone. Some of this is related to large-scale waves in the mean pressure field whose time variation is relatively\nslow. A lo-year period may not be long enough for this effect to average out at a discrete set of locations. The\nthird error, AXinst, results from any trends in the ensemble of instrument calibrations and/or measurement accuracy which would appear as a trend in the ozone data, e.g., an instrument drift.\nFixed biases, such as errors in standardized absorption coefficients, do not affect trend estimates. Any random error whose mean over a sufficiently long data record is essentially zero is presumably included as a part\nof the statistical error. Thus, A.x,~~~and AXins* are related to measurement errors which themselves may show\ntrends over 10 years. These trends, appearing in Axmeas, would either be mistaken for an ozone trend or would\ncancel an ozone trend depending on their direction.\nA measure of our ability to detect any real change in global ozone, whether man-made or natural, over 10\nyears is given by the mean square error:\nE LAXmeas - AXtruel2\n\n= a2stat + u2spat + u2inst\n\nwhere E[ ] indicates an expected value.\nThe charge is to determine our ability to detect a CFM-induced trend. To do this, one must distinguish among\ndifferent components of a true change. The true change may be a result of several causes; i.e.,\nAx true = 4at\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCFM\n\n+ AXother\n\nwhere Axnat is made up of low-frequency natural variations in global ozone due to meteorological and\npossibly extra-terrestrial causes, and AxCFM + Axother includes CFM related changes and all other man-made\neffects. A measure of our error in isolating a CFM-related trend would be:\nAxmeas - &FM\n\n= &at\n\n+ Axother + &tat\n\n+ &pat\n\n+ AXinst,\n\nwhose variance is given by:\n\nThe variances associated with the statistical methodology ( u2&, the spatial sampling ( u2spat)and the instrument (u2inst) can all be reduced by improvements in the measurement accuracy, the sampling density and\nstatistical methods. In fact, it is at least theoretically possible to reduce these errors to such an extent that they\nare insignificant\ncompared to u2nat + a20ther. The u2,at variance can be reduced somewhat\n*An analogous error arises from the bias involving discrete temporal observations.\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\nwith longer data records that allow some of the systematic low-frequency natural variations to be accounted\nfor in the statistical models. For example, possible systematic solar cycle effects may be removed from a2,at\nby having a sufficient number of cycles in the data. However, very long-period meteorological effects would\nstill remain.\nA NASA-sponsored Symposium on Ozone Trend Detectability (NASA, 1977) was held to examine the\nvarious error sources and to assess their impact on the methods used to estimate ozone trends. At that time,\nthe nature of errors was discussed but a quantitative estimate of their magnitudes was not made. Since then,\neach of the sources of error has been at least partially reviewed, and estimates of their relative magnitudes\nhave been made. A discussion of each variance component is contained in the following section. It should be\n\nemphasizedthat the valuesgiven for the individual standard errors in estimating the thresholdfor trend detection are, for the most part, quite soft. The continuation of satellite and ground-based observations, along\nwith additional research on observed ozone variability,\n\nwill certainly reduce the uncertainty of these values.\n\nSTATISTICAL ESTIMATION ERRORS\nIn this section methods are described that have been applied to the total ozone data discussed earlier to detect\nslow changes in the global mean which might be expected if CFMs do, in fact, destroy ozone. Because M-83\nobservations are subject to relatively large errors, and satellite data over extended periods of time have not\nbeen readily available, these methods have been applied to the network of Dobson data.\nIf the monthly ozone measurements at a station have some known patterns of variation, they can be filtered\nout. For example, seasonal effects can be removed by subtracting monthly constants or taking twelve month\ndifferences. A linear trend beginning at some specified time could be similarly removed if its slope were\nknown. If the slope were not known, one could be estimated to remove the trend most effectively. For example, a simple least squares fit could be used if the monthly values were uncorrelated and of equal variance.\nThis is not so here. Adjacent observations are correlated and generally have different variances. Thus, to\nremove the seasonal effects and to estimate trends, one must at the same time determine the correlation and\nvariance structure.\nIf, in fact, all the trends have been removed, then residuals will resemble data generated by a stationary random process. These are the data analogs of colored noise, and they may be specified either by their spectral or\nautocorrelational structure. To get finite parameter models, it is natural to fit autoregressive moving average\n(ARMA) models. If trends are regarded as signals, we are trying to detect signals in a noise environment. It is\nclear that the trends sought are low-frequency signals, which may be confused with low-frequency noise in the\nshort data series available.\nHill and Sheldon (1975)\nmeasured at Arosa from\nwere any signs of lack\nautoregressive models to\ndata.\n\nbegan by fitting an ARMA model to the longest available (monthly) series, that\n1932 to 1970, and examined its fit to subsequent data through 1974 to see if there\nof fit. The series was seasonally filtered. Pagan0 and Parzen (1975) fitted\nthe data before 1970 from 35 stations, and then looked for lack of fit with recent\n\nHill et al. (1977) rephrased the CFM detection problem as follows: (1) find a number of globally representative stations with long and essentially independent records, (2) assume that the CFM effect was trivial\nbefore 1970 (now known to be incorrect), so that earlier records should show only seasonal variations and\nlater records should also have a linear trend, (3) fit an ARMA model to twelve-month differences of the data\nfrom each of the stations to 1970, (4) use these models to make the most efficient slope estimates from the\ndata in the 70s for each station, and (5) average the station slope estimates and compare their average slope\nwith its estimated variance. They used the nine stations at Edmonton, Arosa, Tateno, Mauna Loa, Huancayo, Kodaikanal, MacQuarie Island, Buenos Aires, and Aspendale.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n322\n\nNo statistically significant trend was found in the data from any station, individually, nor in the g-station\naverage. Their estimated change in ozone for the 6 years, 1970 thru 1975, averaged over 9 stations, was - .47\nmatm-cm, which is - .15al, of the global average of 307 matm-cm. Individual station trends ranged from\n+ 9.7 matm-cm (+ 3% per 6 years) at MacQuarie Island to - 13.3 matm-cm (-4%\nper 6 years) at\nKodaikanal.\nG. Watson made similar analyses using seasonally filtered data and different fitting procedures that allowed\nall the data to be used in steps 3 and 4 above. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s technique (National Academy of Sciences, 1979) produced a standard error of the trend which was approximately 50% lower than that of Hill et al. (1977).\nAssuming that parametric time series models are fitted to 9 stations and their individual trends averaged to\nprovide global trends, the best estimate of ustat ranges from .4 to .8% per decade, the larger value being that\nof Hill, et al. A value of .6% will be used in the computation of thresholds, although uncertainties in this\nvalue clearly exist due to the methodology.\n\nINSTRUMENT ERRORS\nA discussion of error sources which are associated with the Dobson instrument has been given earlier. Of\nthese sources, those affecting a trend estimate (i.e., possible trending errors) are listed in table 6-l 1 (Komhyr,\npersonal communication).\nTo combine these error ranges into an estimate of the total instrument error,\nTable 6-l 1\nDobson Measurement Errors which Affect the Observed\nChange Over 10 Years at a Single Station\n\nSource of Error\n\nRange\n(Percent)\n\nStandard\nDeviation\n(Percent)\n\nDistribution\nAbout Zero\n\nTrends in stratospheric\ntemperature affecting\nabsorption coefficients\n\nf 0.5\n\nuniform\n\n0.3\n\nPollution trends including aerosols, tropospheric\nozone, and other gases,\nwhich are correlated at\na particular station\n\nf4\n\nNormal = sum of\nthree uniform\nvariates\n\n2.0\n\nCloudiness changes\n\nfl\n\nuniform\n\n0.6\n\nCalibration drifts\n\n+1\n\nprob (* 3%) = 0.1\nprob (6) = 0.9\n\n0.9\n\nSolar spectral variation\n\nf 0.3\n\nuniform\n\n0.2\n\nCombined single station rms error = 2.30\nrms error for 9-station average: *Assuming independence\nAssuming correlated solar effect\nValue used\nOinst\n\n*Solar effect assumed same at all stations, other errors independent.\n\n.77\n.79\n= 0.8\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\n323\n\nassumptions regarding the distribution of errors within this range were made. Errors were assumed not normally distributed, an assumption which gives added weight (probability) to errors near 0, but instead were\nassumed to have a uniform distribution within the given ranges. The one exception to this was the error due to\na calibration drift, in which case it was estimated that for 90% of the stations this error is negligible, whereas\nfor 10% a drift of *3% is present. The sum of uniformly distributed errors still tends toward a normal or\nGaussian distribution whose mean is, in this case, zero, and whose variance is the sum of the variances,\nassuming independence. The standard error resulting from instrument-related sources when estimating the\ntrend at a single station is computed as 2.30%. Assuming that a global trend is estimated by averaging the\nIO-year trends at 9 stations, then its standa,rd error is one-third (m)\nthat at a single station. Thus, the value\nis estimated to be 0.77%. This may be somewhat underestimated since the errors at all stations are not\nof ainst\ntotally uncorrelated. If one takes the extra-terrestrial effect to be perfectly correlated at all 9 stations and all\nother errors to be uncorrelated, then the standard error associated with Dobson observations at the 9 stations\nis ainst = 0.79%. A value of 0.8% will be used in the calculations for trend detectability thresholds.\n\nSPATIAL SAMPLING ERRORS\nLong-wave pressure patterns (troughs and ridges) often persist in their spatial distributions for several years,\npossibly changing gradually, or they can change abruptly. Ozone concentrations are correlated (negatively) to\nthese pressures. Thus, a sudden or gradual change in the pressure distribution could result in an ozone trend\nat the monitoring stations even when there is no change in the ozone integrated over the globe. In addition,\nlong-term variation in observing conditions, such as would be associated with climatic variations of\ncloudiness, could incorrectly affect observed trends. Both spatial and temporal observational biases would be\nminimized with use of a long-period satellite total ozone monitoring system.\nIn a study on the use of Dobson station observations near 50 \xe2\x80\x9cN latitude to provide an estimate of the average\ntotal ozone over the entire 50\xe2\x80\x9d latitude zone (Miller et al., 1979), it was suggested that an error of as much as\n+4% could occur in the IO-year trend estimate.\nExtrapolating this to the entire Dobson network, these errors would be reduced somewhat due to the decreased amplitude of long-wave patterns at lower latitudes. The standard deviation associated with these spatial\nsampling errors in a lo-year global difference is estimated to be between 1 and 2%. This should be added to\nan error associated with lack of data over the polar regions, an error tihich may, in fact, be random but will\nnot be averaged out over short time intervals. This error is estimated to be approximately 0.3%. Assuming the\nfirst error is 1.5%, the rms spatial sampling error is therefore aSpat = 1.53% - 1.5%.\n\nLONG-TERM NATURAL TRENDS\nThe Dobson data do not extend over a sufficiently long period to remove long-term natural trends. On the\nbasis of such low-frequency behavior in other geophysical and meteorological records, it is estimated that\nsuch natural trends may cause errors between 1 and 3% over a IO-year period. A value of 2% will be used for\nunat. This estimate can be reduced slightly if solar cycle influences are present in this low frequency behavior.\n\nOTHER ANTHROPOGENIC TRENDS\nChemical modelers estimate that standard errors of approximately 1Vo should be included to cover other anthropogenic trends, not related to CFM release, which might result from other chemicals introduced into the\nstratosphere. The standard errors estimated are given in table 6-12. Due to the unaccounted changes in the\nconcentration of tropospheric and stratospheric chemical species, there are likely to be systematic trends in\nthe ozone data of +2% (2~) in a lo-year period. Past trends and the expected future changes in CO,, N,O,\n\na-.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n324\n\nCH,CCl,, CO, H,O and others all lead to estimated changes in the ozone concentration. It is difficult to\nestimate the exact amount of possible systematic bias introduced into the ozone data. However, current\nunderstanding of atmospheric chemistry and the sensitivity of ozone to individual changes in the concentration of these chemical species would indicate the above estimate to be reasonable and conservative.\n\nTable 6-12\nStandard Errors in Estimating Global Changes in Ozone\n\nSymbol\n\nCause\n\nValue\n(Percent)\n\nComment\n\n\xe2\x80\x98stat\n\nStatistical methodology,\nrandom errors and\nunmodeled short-term\ntime dependencies\n\n0.6\n\nBased on time series analysis\nof 9 Dobson stations\n\noinst\n\nPossible trending errors\nin Dobson instruments\n\n0.8\n\nAssuming 9-station average\nwith correlated error due\nto solar effects\n\n\xe2\x80\x98spat\n\nSpatial sampling\n\n1.5\n\nExtrapolated from bias seen\nat 5OoN latitude\n\nonat\n\nNatural long-term\nvariation in global ozone\n\n2.0\n\nEstimated to range between\n1 and 3 percent\n\noother\n\nOther possible\nanthropogenic changes\n\n1.0\n\nBest guess of modelers\n\nESTIMATING THRESHOLDS OF TREND DETECTABILITY\nThere are three thresholds that can be identified. A threshold for detecting a real change in total ozone after\nallowing for statistical, instrumental and spatial errors is suggested by E [(A xmeaS- AxtnJ2]. Substituting\nustat = 0.6, qnst = 0.8 and uSpat = 1.5 into the equation above, one has\nE [(Axmeas - Axtrue)2] = 3.25 = (1.8)2\nThe standard error is 1.8\xe2\x80\x9970, and 2 standard errors representing a 95% confidence interval is f 3.6%. Thus, if\nan observed global change in ozone over 10 years exceeds 3.6\xe2\x80\x9970, it may be judged as a true change and not attributable to statistical errors, possible instrument errors or spatial biases. It would be anomalous in the sense\nthat it is not consistent with the behavior of the ozone data prior to that IO-year period.\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES IN STRATOSPHERIC PARAMETERS\n\nThe question of whether a change is CFM-related or otherwise anthropogenic\nthreshold. Allowing for a possible low-frequency natural change, one has\nEKAx,,,,\n\n- AxanuJ2]\n\n325\n\nwill require an even higher\n\n= u~,.,~~+ (1.8)2 = 7.24 = (2.69)2\n\nwhere Axa,thr = AxcFr,,, + Axother. The standard error is 2.69070, and the threshold for detectability becomes\n5.4%. An observed trend exceeding this threshoid may be suspected as anthropogenic in that it is no longer\nwithin the range of natural low-frequency variations.\nTo further conclude that an observed anthropogenic trend is CFM-related, one must account for an estimated\n1% standard error due to other chemical species affecting the ozone. This increases the standard error to\n2.87% and the threshold to 5.74%. It appears that an observed IO-year global trend must exceed approximately 6%, or 18 matm-cm, before it can be surmised that the CFMs are implicated. The 3 thresholds just\ndiscussed are summarized in table 6-13.\n\nTable 6-13\nThresholds for Detecting Changes in Ozone Using Best\nStatistical Methods and Dobson Network Data\n\nThreshold*\n\nPurpose\n\n?ercent change globally\nn 10 years\nt1.2\n\nFor detecting any net change or trend in\nDobson data sets after allowing for uncertainty due to statistical error (i.e., noise in\ndata) and methodology.\n\n3.6\n\nFor detecting a true change in global average total ozone after allowing for uncertainty due to statistical error, instrument drifts and spatial sampling biases.\n\n3.4\n\nFor detecting an anthropogenic effect\nafter making additional allowance for\npossible low-frequency natural variations.\n\n3.7\n\nFor detecting a CFM effect after allowing\nfor errors above plus possible variations\ndue to other anthropogenic changes.\n\n*95% confidence (20) level\n\nConclusions associated with these thresholds, viewed without the uncertainty limits associated with CFMrelated depletion predictions, are applicable only to situations where measured trends exceed the thresholds.\nIf Ax*eas is below the highest threshold, in the case of ?6%, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether or\n\nII III III\n\nI\n\nI\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\n326\n\nnot predictions are valid. This conclusion would have to be reached on the basis of both uncertainty\nenvelopes-those of the estimate Axmea4 and of the predictions. As long as Axmeas is within both envelopes,\nthe CFM-related depletion is still a viable hypothesis.\nAXmeasand its threshold can be used to test hypothesized values for ozone depletion due to CFMs. For example, if a hypothesized depletion is D% (say 10%) over a decade, it can be rejected if D does not fall within\nAXmeas -+ threshold. In this way, certain hypothesized upper limits of depletion may be ruled out by the empirical trend analysis.\nTable 6-14 gives a corresponding set of potential thresholds if one assumes that data from a satellite ozone\nmonitoring system are available. The errors resulting from the spatially poor distribution of Dobson stations\nshould be reduced by a factor of five (from 1.5 to 0.3). It is also assumed that the Dobson records are carefully corrected for errors such as instrument drifts and calibration changes. Errors due to other anthropogenic\ntrends are assumed to be reduced from 1.0 to .7%. The resulting thresholds are 1.6%, 4.3% and 4.5%. The\nnat was not changed because the length of data records was assumed to be the same. The latter two assume\nthat no progress can be made in understanding and reducing natural trend biases. However, it should be\npointed out that the inclusion and analysis of other meteorological data sets may aid in quantifying and\nreducing the long-term natural trend biases.\nU2\n\nTable 6-14\nPotential Thresholds for a Projected\nSatellite Global Ozone Monitoring Program\nIntegrated with Calibrated Dobson Network\n\nPotential Threshold*\n\nPurpose\n\n+1.6\n\nFor detecting a real change after accounting for statistical error (0.6), instrument\nerror (0.4) and spatial error (0.3). lmprovements in spatial biases through use of\nsatellite data and correlated pressure\nmeasurements.\n\nw.3\n\nFor detecting an anthropogenic change\nafter accounting for natural variation (2.0).\n\nk4.5\n\nFor detecting a CFM effect after accounting for other chemical effects (0.7).

It is, therefore, arguable that monitoring ozone concentrations at these heights in the atmosphere may lead to earlier and more reliable detection of statistically significant effects which may be due\nto these influences.\nAt 40 km altitude, appreciable trends in ozone concentration due to non-anthropogenic causes may be expected due to two main sources. Trends in temperature at this level will affect the ozone concentration\nthrough the photochemistry and could amount to uT = 2% per decade if the temperature variation and its effect on ozone are unknown. Possible variations in the solar spectrum might lead to an additional trend in\nozone of about as = f 1% per decade. Trends in the strength of the atmospheric transport, on the other\nhand, will not lead to appreciable trends in ozone concentration at these levels because the ozone is close to\nphotochemical steady-state (except in the winter polar regions which have a small area relative to the sunlit atmosphere).\nAt 30 km altitude, where data are available from the existing balloon-borne ozonesonde network, the possible\ntrend in ozone which would be induced by a natural trend in temperature is of the order of &0.5%. The trend\ndue to a changing solar spectrum at 30 km will also be smaller than at 40 km and is put at *0.5%. However,\nthe predicted fluorocarbon effect on ozone is also reduced to one half of that at 40 km.\nThese and other uncertainties in the estimation of decade1 trends in ozone at 30 km altitude by balloon-borne\nozonesondes and at 40 km altitude by rocketsondes, the Umkehr method and satellite methods, respectively,\nare summarized in table 6-15.\nBalloon-borne ozone sensors at a few locations in Western Europe since 1966, the U.S. for a few years, at\nfour stations in Canada, one in Australia since 1965, and more recently in India and Japan, and one station in\nAntarctica give some data up to altitudes of about 30 km. Of these, only the European and Canadian networks and the Australian station have records long enough to establish a useful data base at this time. These\nrecords were obtained with Brewer-Mast ozonesondes, with data adjusted to agree with nearby Dobson instrument total ozone values and subject to the errors discussed earlier.\nWhile statistically significant trends were reported in ozone concentrations at 30 km and above at Aspendale\nin Australia (Pittock, 1974, 1977a), such trends by themselves can in no way be considered representative of\nhemispheric or global averages at these levels. If a sufficiently detailed global analysis of the temperature\nand/or pressure-height or wind fields existed at these heights over the data period, such trends could be interpreted in a climatological context so as to be possibly indicative of a more general picture. Available\nmeteorological data may be somewhat inadequate for such a purpose, although less so over Europe and\nNorth America.\nSimilar problems of lack of geographical representativeness occur with the rocketsonde and Umkehr\nmethods. Estimates for the uncertainties in decade1 trend determinations by each method is given as eG in\ntable 6-15.\nAt lower altitudes, the Umkehr method suffers from another problem of non-representativeness when used\nfor ozone monitoring. This is due to the fact that Umkehr measurements cannot be made under thick or\nhighly variable cloud conditions. Since ozone content in the lower stratosphere is generally positively correlated with cloudiness this leads to a systematic bias towards low ozone content in these layers.

This can vary from year-to-year and could seriously\naffect trend estimates at these levels.\nAt the 40 km level, the ozone is close to photochemical steady-state. The geographical bias in the observing\nnetwork enters here because of the geographical variations of temperature at this level, which will affect the\nphotochemical equilibrium concentrations. In the satellite case the only representativeness problem concerns\nthe absence of observations in the polar night. This may contribute +~0.5% to the uncertainty in the trend\nover a decade.\nThe white noise problem arises from random errors in individual measurements and short time-scale variations. This problem is reduced in cumulative effect on the trend estimates by more frequent observations, and\nthe best current estimate of its magnitude for each method is given by ustat in table 6-15. These estimates are\nbased on an assumed frequency of five balloon soundings per month, one rocket sounding per month, and 15\nUmkehr measurements per month. The u,,,t values have been reduced on the basis of an assumed five independent pieces of information per time interval from the existing balloon-sonde network, only one from the\nexisting rocket-sounding program, and five from the Umkehr observation network. This term would be\nsignificantly reduced by an increase in the number of stations and frequency of observations. A small increase\nin the rocketsonde network to four or five stations would render the rocketsonde network competitive with\nthe existing Umkehr network, particularly as it has better vertical resolution. In the case of satellite observations, time series of global mean data suggest that ustat will be much smaller, of the order of 0.2% per decade.\nA trend in the aerosol content in the stratosphere may cause a minor error in the Umkehr method decade1\ntrend estimates, UA, of f 2%, but in the event of a major volcanic eruption this effect would be larger unless\nallowance were made for the aerosols in estimating the ozone trend.\nIn the case of the balloon-borne ozonesondes, an uncertainty, uE of about t- 1% in the decade1 trend may be\ncaused by the need to extrapolate from the maximum height reached by the sounding to the top of the atmosphere. Unknown trends above the maximum balloon height could cause false contributions to the\nestimated trend below via the procedure which corrects the data to agree with the total ozone amount\nmeasured by the Dobson spectrophotometer.\nFinally, there is a problem of calibration drift UC. The balloon and the Umkehr methods each rely on the\ncalibration of the Dobson spectrophotometer network, which was discussed in the previous section. This is\nsubject to a possible decade1 drift of about f 1%. In the case of the projected satellite monitoring system\nthere is, as part of The National Plan for Ozone Monitoring and Early Detection of Stratospheric Change, a\nrequirement for a ground-based calibration/verification\nprogram using rocket and balloon-borne\nozonesondes to achieve a yearly 2u precision of +- 5%. This goal implies an error due to drift in an estimated\ntrend of about f 1% per decade.\nSumming up the various contributions to the overall uncertainty, urms, in decade1 trend estimates, using the\nroot mean square method, it is found that the projected monitoring system should yield trend estimates good\nwithin one standard error of about +2.5% per decade, or a 95% confidence limit of f 5%. This would only\nbe achieved, however, if the satellite calibration stability were ascertained by careful and repeated rocket\nozonesonde validation flights.\nThe existing balloonsonde network should achieve a standard error of the global decade1 trend estimate of\nabout f 5% at the 30 km level. At the 40 km level, where anthropogenic-induced trends may be larger, both\nthe rocketsonde and Umkehr network presently may achieve an accuracy of about f 8 or 9% in the decade1\ntrend. In both cases more observations at more stations could significantly lower these uncertainties.\n\n330\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe present estimated uncertainties are based on general knowledge of the methods and available data, but\nnot on an exhaustive data analysis. They are given as general guides to problems and capabilities and subject\nto possible revision in the light of further analysis.\nThe nomenclature used in this section is not completely identical to that used in the previous section. For purposes of comparison, a combination of uA and uE and uc is equivalent to qnst, eG corresponds to uspat, and a\ncombination of u= and us is equivalent to u,,t, and e,ther has not been estimated, but modeling of other possible anthropogenic effects suggests it would be larger at 30 or 40 km altitude than in the case of the total ozone\ncolumn.\nThe final figures, urms, in the table 6-15, thus correspond to la threshold limits equivalent to the third limit in\ntable 6-13 and the second limit in table 6-14. Thus, the potential threshold at the 95% confidence level (2~) for\nthe projected global ozone monitoring program to detect a real lo-year trend in ozone concentration at 40\nkm, is about 5.0% per decade. Given that the expected anthropogenic trend at the 40 km level is three times\nlarger than that in the total ozone column amount (see e.g., Chapter 7), this is perhaps the most hopeful approach to early detection of anthropogenic effects. Increased investments in expanded networks of balloonor rocket-borne ozonesondes or in Umkehr observations are also attractive possibilities.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe prime purpose of this chapter was to arrive at some estimate of a threshold, or likely value, of our ability\nto detect a projected chlorofluoromethane\n(CFM) induced decrease of total ozone and the ozone concentration in the middle and upper stratosphere. In this chapter we have discussed: what is known of the ozone\nvariations; how certain we are of this information; what can be done to improve the data bank through future\nobservations; and what can be done to effect a reduction of the uncertainty of the information. The problem\nof ozone trend detectability was discussed earlier in the section on Measurement and Analysis of Ozone Variation in NASA RP-1010. This chapter differs from the past report in that it:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nIncludes estimates of various observation errors\nDiscusses observed trends in other atmospheric parameters known to influence the long period changes\nin ozone (e.g., other trace species, stratospheric temperature, etc.)\nMakes use of additional\n\nobserved data (particularly\n\nsatellite data) in analysis of past changes\n\nProvides estimates of the thresholds of trend detectability of observed total ozone and ozone concentration in the stratosphere.\n\nEstimates of variations of the global amount of total ozone during the past 20 years, derived almost exclusively from the ground based observations provided by the Dobson network, show changes of the order of a few\npercent, the most significant of which was the unexplained increase of about 4 percent in global total ozone\n(largely Northern Hemisphere) during the IO-year period 1961 to 1970. Data derived from satellite observations (BUV) indicate a decrease of total ozone in the period 1970-72 (- 2.5 percent) but no strong variation\nfor the years 1972-77. Although there is some uncertainty in these estimated variations, it is important to note\nthat, in general, the pattern of total ozone changes derived from satellite and ground based data for common\nperiods of observations are quite consistent and both data sets indicate that Northern Hemisphere variations\ndominate the global pattern.\nObservations of stratospheric ozone concentrations are still too sparse to allow for definitive statements concerning past long-term trends of global stratospheric ozone.\n\nLONG PERIOD CHANGES\n\nIN STRATOSPHERIC\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n331\n\nEvaluation of long period past ozone trends and those projected for the future is complicated by uncertainties\nof the time changes, both anthropogenic and natural, of the other parameters such as trace gases,\nstratospheric temperature and winds, etc., which influence the ozone amount through both photochemical\nand dynamic interactions. It appears that there has been a downward trend of global mean temperature in the\nNorthern Hemisphere lower stratosphere of about 2\xc2\xb0C for the period 1964-73 with probably little change\nsince then. The cause of this temperature trend is not known although it is suggested that long period\ntemperature variations in the middle and upper stratosphere may be associated with the 1l-year solar cycle.\nMost of the trace gases of interest, including water vapor, seem to be increasing at a rate of about 2 to 10 percent per year. However, except for a few gases such as CO, there is a lack of representative, long-term, and\nwell-calibrated measurements for necessary quantitative estimates of global trends of the species discussed in\nthis chapter.\nThe difficulty in distinguishing between the measured and true value of ozone variations results from uncertainties due to statistical variability, instrumental error, and bias in the time or space distribution of the observations. In addition, it is necessary to separate CFM produced ozone changes from those changes resulting\nfrom natural or other anthropological influences. For convenience, the problem of ozone trend detection was\ntreated as a change over a IO-year interval 1980 to 1990. On the basis of our evaluation of the standard errors\nof the individual items that contribute to uncertainty in the ozone changes, we have estimated that the\nthreshold for detecting changes in global total ozone using the ground based network is k6 percent for 10\nyears at the 95 percent (2~) confidence level. If satellite observations are used to complement the groundbased Dobson measurements and if improvements are made in the observational systems, this threshold value\ncould be reduced to + 4.5 percent per 10 years. The threshold for detection of a CFM produced ozone trend in\nmid-stratosphere is about f 5 to 10 percent per 10 years if natural and other anthropogenic influences are important.\nWe emphasize that many of the numbers used in arriving at estimates given in this chapter, particularly those\ninvolving low frequency natural variations, are very soft. These latter, of course, involve the general problem\nof climate predictability and the influences of long period climatic changes on ozone variations. More firm\nestimates of the threshold values could be developed with a carefully planned program of continuous ozone\nobservations made with intercalibrated satellite and ground-based systems. In addition, the thresholds could\nbe lowered by reduction of the uncertainty in long-term meteorological effects and reduction of the groundbased Dobson network errors.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nSince the threshold of detecting an anthropogenic trend in ozone cannot be precisely quantified at this\ntime, the emphasis should be put on reducing the two major uncertainties in the present values, which\nare geographical sampling bias and long-term natural-trend bias. Comparisons between satellite and\nground-based station data and the use of detailed total ozone field from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer observations are potentially important for correcting sampling bias that may exist in the present Dobson network. Analysis of long-term meteorological data sets in conjunction with ozone data\nwill also contribute to reducing uncertainties due to long-term natural ozone trends.\nRapid initiation of an integrated ozone monitoring plan is strongly recommended. The monitoring\nsystem should consist of satellite total ozone and profile sounders, operated in conjunction with a well\ncalibrated set of Dobson stations, and with regular and frequent launches of rocket and balloon\nozonesondes, such as is recommended in the Federal Ozone Monitoring Plan.\nContinued efforts are recommended toward improvement and extension of international Dobson ozone\nspectrophotometer network, which still represents the most extensive ground-based source of total\nozone data.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nConventional sounding programs (balloons, rockets, Umkehr) should be continued and expanded for\nindependent analyses of long-term variations in stratospheric ozone, in addition to validation of satellite\nderived ozone profiles.\nIncreased theoretical and observational research efforts to understand the physical association between\nglobal transport processes and ozone changes are recommended.\nEarly detection of anthropogenic trends in ozone would be more likely using data pertaining to the 35 to\n45 km altitude region. Increased frequency and spatial coverage by rocket- and balloon-borne\nozonesondes and by Umkehr observations, as well as satellite monitoring systems, would greatly\nenhance the capability for early detection.\nAccumulating evidence from ozone observations with different instruments suggests that Dobson spectrophotometer AD wavelength effective ozone absorption coefficients may be erroneous. Because Dobson instrument observations represent a long-term data set and provide ground truth for satellite ozone\nmeasurements, a concerted effort is recommended to establish the absolute error in the ozone absorption coefficients, particularly at the Dobson wavelengths.\nFurther studies are needed to reduce errors associated with long-term Dobson instrument calibration\ndrifts, the dependence of ozone absorption coefficients on changing stratospheric temperatures, the effects of stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols on measurement, and interferences caused by UV absorbers in polluted tropospheric air such as sulfur dioxide and photochemically-produced\nozone.\nLittle is known about the variability of long-lived atmospheric species such as CH,, N,O, CF,Cl,,\nCFClj, CH,CC13, and stratospheric HZ0 which decompose in the stratosphere to yield radicals which\ndirectly impact on ozone. Long-term observational programs, with improved calibration techniques\nshould be implemented. The existing series of stratospheric water vapor soundings should be continued.\nAll efforts should be made to process and validate existing ozone profile data sets.\nRecently detected trends of stratospheric temperature require further investigation, including careful\nanalysis of satellite data at levels normally sounded only by rockets. The analysis should be extended to\nearlier periods, if possible, and care should be taken to insure calibration and continuity of future\nmeasurements and their interpretation.\n\nCHAPTER 7\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n!NTRODUCTION\nIn previous chapters, the present status of stratospheric science has been discussed in some detail. The three\nbasic elements of stratospheric science-laboratory\nmeasurements, atmospheric observations, and theoretical\nstudies are intimately interconnected, since results from each element serve to refine and validate results from\nthe other elements. A major focus of the continuing development of the field is on achieving the ability to\npredict, with reasonable confidence, the effect on ozone of particular anthropogenic sources of pollution.\nThis chapter discusses the current status of such model predictions. Simply stated, a prediction is an attempt\nto answer the question: Compared with the present state of the stratosphere, what changes will occur as a\nresult of a change in one or more chemical species? To answer this question, changes in the amount and\ndistribution of stratospheric ozone are considered almost exclusively. Modifications of the aerosol layer and\nof the temperature distribution are only briefly discussed, as are the implications for possible climate changes.\nIn NASA RP-1010, (Hudson, 1977) the primary emphasis was on the effects on ozone of anthropogenic\nsources of CFCI, and CF.&.\nIn addition to CFCl, and CF,Cl,, the present study includes other forms of\npollution identified as being potentially capable of producing significant ozone changes. Predictions are made\nof effects of ground level releases of CH,CCl, and of chemicals produced by aircraft, rockets, and atmospheric nuclear explosions. Changes in N,O, H,O, CO and CO, are also considered.\nA number of 1-D photochemistry models exist, and many of these were used to provide results for this\nchapter. Each of the models is referred to in the text by the name of the institution where the model is used.\nThe investigators who participated in the workshop and provided the results from the model are identified in\ntable 7-1, which also cites references that discuss the particular model. However, it must be remembered that\na research group may have more than one model, and that models have evolved considerably over the past\nfive years. Thus, the models used in this study may differ in some respects from those discussed in these\nreferences. Each research group, except GSFC, used only one model to obtain the results presented in this\nchapter; two models are used by GSFC because one of the models (denoted GSFC-UNC) is substantially less\nsophisticated than the others. This model is used in uncertainty studies (as described later in the chapter), and\nthus it is important to document how well the GSFC-UNC model compares with the others. The different\nmodels were compared and found to produce generally consistent results in that any substantial differences\nwere traced to model input data and boundary conditions. Further comparisons are contained later in this\nchapter and in Chapter 4.\nThere are certain limitations inherent in 1-D photochemistry models, as discussed in Chapter 2, but 1-D\nmodels still provide the best current predictive capability. This is because: (1) they can include all known\nchemistry and chemical-radiative feedback, (2) they have been shown to be reasonably consistent with most\nobservations of the current atmosphere, (3) many of the current 1-D models have been extensively intercompared for consistency, and (4) some reasonable method of uncertainty analysis can be applied to their predictions. Where appropriate, selected two-dimensional (2-D) model predictions are also used, especially their\ndiagnostic capability for assessing the latitude dependence of effects.\n\n333\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n334\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nTable 7-1\nInstitutions and Workshop Participants Associated with Models Used to Provide\nPredictions in this Report\n\nParticipants\n\nInstitute\n\nLawrence\nLivermore\nLaboratory\n\nLLL\n\nDuPon\n\nReferences\n\nI\n\nLaRC\n\nChang,\nPenner.\n\nJ.. and Duewer,\nW.\nJ.. and Wuebbles,\nD.\n\nChang et al.\n(1974,1979)\nPenner & Chang\n(1979)\n\nE.

This\nunderstanding has evolved from the original pure oxygen chemistry proposed by Chapman (1930) to the current concept of an interacting radiative-chemical-dynamical\nsystem. Because the perturbations discussed\nherein are generally chemical in nature, the most important criterion in the selection of a perturbation model\nis its accurate representation of the chemistry of the stratosphere. This has led to intense work on the development of 1-D parameterized transport models. In this type of model, simplifications of dynamical processes\nhave been made in order to focus on understanding the complexities of the chemistry.\nIn the stratosphere, odd-oxygen is formed mainly through the photolysis of 0, in the upper stratosphere and\nis destroyed by reaction with itself and various catalysts. The reaction, 0 + 0, - 20,, accounts for a relatively\nminor fraction of odd-oxygen loss in the stratosphere. The major loss processes for odd-oxygen involve the\ncatalytic effects of various free radical species.\nThe major recognized catalytic loss mechanisms for odd-oxygen involve NO, (NO + NO,), HO, (OH +\nHO, + H) and ClO, (Cl + ClO) in such reaction sequences as:\n\nNO + 0, - NO, + 0,\nNO,+O-NO+O,\n0, + 0 - 20,\nOH + 0, - HO, + 0,\nHO, + 0, - OH + 20,\n20, - 30,\nCl + 0, - Cl0 + 0,\nCl0 + 0 - Cl + 0,\n0 + 0, - 20,\nIn addition to the examples given above, there are many other reaction sequences, some of comparable importance.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nSince NASA RP-1010, new measurements of various reaction rate constants have led to an increased\nawareness of the importance of interactions among the various catalytic species. The rate constant recommendations made by DeMore et al. (1979) are used throughout this chapter. They are slightly different from those\nin Chapter 1, and differ from the recommendations in NASA RP-1010 for many reactions. Most of the differences from NASA RP-1010 are either modest in magnitude, or involve reactions that have little influence\non model predictions.\nDeMore et al. (1979) recommend significant increases in the rates of the reactions: HO, + 0, - OH + 20, and\nHO, + NO - OH + NO,. The rate for the second reaction was given in NASA RP-1010 as 8 x lo-t2 cm3\nmolecule-1 set-i independent of temperature. This represented a large increase over previous evaluations of\nthis rate coefficient and was based on the measurements of Howard and Evenson (1977). DeMore et al (1979)\nand Chapter 1 of this report recommend a temperature-dependent rate constant based on the measurements\n\nI -\n\n336\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nof Zahniser and Howard (private communication, 1979) and Howard (1979) which gives an even larger value\nat stratospheric temperatures. These revisions in recommended rate constants shift the balance within the\nHO, species toward OH and away from HO,. Larger \xe2\x80\x98OH concentrations have opposite effects on the efficiencies of the chlorine and nitrogen catalysis of ozone loss. Since OH removes chlorine from the inactive HCl\nreservoir through the reaction OH + HCl * H20 + Cl returning it to the active Cl form, one effect of an OH\nincrease is to increase the calculated efficiency of ozone destruction by chlorine. The effect on the oddnitrogen catalysis of ozone loss is the opposite because the reaction OH + NO, + M + HNO, + M ties up\nNO, in the inactive HNO, reservoir. Thus, the effect of these rate changes is to increase the sensitivity of\nstratospheric photochemical models to chlorine additions, while decreasing the sensitivity to NO, perturbations .\nOther important revisions include the photolysis rate of NO by Frederick and Hudson (1979a), NO + hv N(4S) +0, and the reactions of N atoms with NO, 0, and 0,. The net result of these changes is the slower\ndestruction of odd nitrogen (the sum of N, NO, NO,, 2xN205, ClONO, and HNO,) in the upper stratosphere\nand lower mesosphere, leading to larger predicted concentrations of odd nitrogen than previously obtained.\nComputations with the older rates yielded a peak odd nitrogen of approximately 18 to 20 ppbv, while the\nnewer rates increase this amount to 23 to 25 ppbv. The possibility that the ionospheric odd-nitrogen sources\ncould provide a significant contribution to the stratospheric budget is also increased. As stated in Chapter 4,\nthese higher values are in greater disagreement with the measurements of the individual odd-nitrogen species.\nIn addition to changes in long-recognized photochemistry, recent developments have occurred which introduce essentially new chemistry into the models. Amon these are the formation reactions of HOC1 and\nH02N02: HO2 + Cl0 + HOC1 + O2 and HO, + NO2 d HO,NO,. Both reactions have been measured to\nbe quite rapid. Subsequent chemistry is poorly known, but these species strengthen the couplings between\nHO, and ClX and HO, and NO,.\nAlthough the coupling between HO, and ClX ties up some ClX in a relatively inactive form, ClX catalysis\nmay actually be increased because of the reaction sequence:\nCl + 0, - Cl0 + 0,\nOH + 0, - HO, + 0,\nCl0 + HO, - HOC1 + 0,\nHOCl+hv-OH+Cl\n20, - 30,\nThis provides an odd-oxygen destruction sequence which is effective in the lower stratosphere where oxygenatom concentrations are low.\nEarlier model calculations (e.g. as described in Hudson, 1977) generally assumed that the products of\nCIONO, photolysis were Cl0 + NO,, simply returning to the formation reactants with no net effect on\nozone. Current results given in Chapter 1 indicate that the products are Cl + NO,. Some of the NO, formed\nwill photolyze to NO and 0, giving a net ozone destruction via the following reaction sequence:\nCl0 + NO, M CIONO,\nClONO,\n\n+ hu - Cl + NO,\n\nNO, + hv - NO + 0,\nNO + 0, - NO, + 0,\nCl + 03 - Cl0 + 0,\n20, - 30,\n\n337\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\nIf the products of peroxynitric\ncesses will exist.\n\nacid (H0,NO.J\n\nphotolysis are OH + NO,, analogous ozone destruction pro-\n\nA reaction between OH and Cl0 has recently been measured by Leu and Lin (1979). Two sets of products are\npossible:\nOH + Cl0 - HO, + Cl\n\n(a)\n\nOH + Cl0 - HCl + 0,\n\n(b)\n\nBranch (a) accounts for most of the products observed by Leu and Lin (1979) and has relatively little effect on\nmodel calculations, but branch (b) is potentially a major route for the conversion of ClO, into the relatively\nstable species HCl, and will be important if even a few percent of the overall reaction goes through this\nbranch. It is also possible that the rate of reaction (b) is pressure dependent.\nIn addition to newly recognized reactions of ClO,, HO,, and NO,,, attention has been directed to the potential\nrole of bromine in stratospheric chemistry. In the past, bromine has received little attention because it has a\nmuch smaller ambient concentration than chlorine; about 10 pptv BrX compared to 2 ppbv ClX (Lazrus et\nal., 1975, 1976). However, recent calculations by various workshop participants have shown that at mixing\nratios of approximately 10 to 100 pptv, bromine species can influence stratospheric composition. Thus,\nbromine could become a serious environmental problem if substantial increases in its anthropogenic emissions occur. (Wofsy ct al., 1975; Bauer, 1978).\nBromine has the potential for enhancing,the destruction of ozone by chlorine through the coupling reaction of\nBrO with ClO. The Br and Cl atoms formed in this reaction quickly react with ozone to complete a catalytic\ncycle:\nBrO + Cl0 - Br + Cl + 0,\nBr + O,A\n\nBrO + 0,\n\n- Cl0 + 0,\nCl\n_._~~ + 0, -.~\n20, - 30,\nWith 20 pptv of bromine in the stratosphere, the depletion of ozone by CFMs is estimated to be enhanced by 5\nto 20% (See e.g. Yung et al., 1979; and results Ijresented later in this chapter). Thus, for low bromine levels,\nthe chlorine-bromine synergism with respect to ozone depletion is of moderate importance.\nUnlike chlorine, there are no known efficient reservoirs for Br and BrO because HBr and BrON02 are rapidly\ndestroyed by sunlight. Accordingly, on a molecule-for-molecule basis, bromine should destroy ozone more\neffectively than chlorine. If bromine levels were high (more than 100 pptv), bromine consumption of ozone\nwould increase more rapidly than the bromine concentration itself because of the fast reaction,\nBrO + BrO - Br + Br + 0,\nThus, as bromine concentrations increase, the importance of bromine catalysis of odd-oxygen loss quickly increases relative to that of other catalytic cycles. In fact, because of the reaction BrO + Cl0 - Br + Cl + O,,\nbromine and chlorine should together be more efficient in destroying ozone.\nThe net result of the changes and additions to the chemical description of the stratosphere is an increased\nperception of the interconnection of the catalytic cycles. Although many of these reactions have been known\nand used in the models for some time, their importance has recently increased as has the perception of their\nrole in synergistic and interference effects. The stratospheric photochemistry system is now viewed as one in\nwhich the ozone production-and-loss processes involve a number of species in an interconnected manner so\nthat a perturbation in any one of these affects all of the others.\n\n338\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nIn addition to changes in the perception of stratospheric chemistry, other features of 1-D models have evolved. Many models now include details of methane oxidation, and an attempt to incorporate consistent calculations of water vapor. Those models having their lower boundary at ground level have attempted to improve\nthe representation of the troposphere and have included flux boundary-conditions.\nMost model calculations\nnow take multiple scattering into account, and employ more sophisticated treatment of diurnal averaging.\nThe potential importance of temperature feedback effects is widely appreciated, although most model\ncalculations do not include such temperature feedback. The current treatment of radiative cooling in I-D\nphotochemical models is probably too crude to be satisfactory below 30 km (Dickinson, 1973b).\nA number of 2-D photochemical models are under development, and some results are now available from\nWhitten et al. (1979), Vupputuri (1976), Crutzen (1975a), Brasseur (1978), Harwood and Pyle (1975),\nWidhopf (1975), and Hidalgo (1978). These models permit the examination of latitudinal differences in\nphotolysis rates, and offer some improvement in the parameterization of transport. Although such models do\nnot offer much hope for computing the effects of chemical changes on transport processes, they do provide\nan improvement over 1-D models in their ability to treat latitudinal and seasonal effects.\n\nMODELING--THE\n\nPRESENT STRATOSPHERE\n\nThe modeling groups listed in table 7-l were requested to perform a standard set of calculations, using the\nrecommended set of rate constants and photolysis cross sections described in DeMore et al. (1979). However,\nmost models include some chemical reactions for which no recommendation was given, and some used the\nphotolysis rate for NO given by Cieslik and Nicolet (1973) while others used that suggested recently by\nFrederick and Hudson (1979a). Thus, the photochemical reaction rates used in the different models are\nsimilar but not identical. Since no other attempt was made to standardize the models, they differ somewhat in\nthe choice of solar-flux values, boundary conditions, standard atmosphere (30 \xe2\x80\x9cN, or midlatitude mean), vertical diffusion coefficients, and actual type of calculation performed (steady-state or time-dependent treatment of the diurnal variation of insolation). On the other hand, most models employed similar values for\nmany of these parameters, and this is reflected in the agreement between the different model results.\nAlthough the vertical diffusion coefficients may differ, they are all tuned to the same measured concentration\nof CH,, N,O, CF,Cl, and CFCl,. The models all used global average, equinoctial, or 30 \xe2\x80\x9cN (midlatitude) conditions.\n\nTRACE SPECIES\nA comparison of the model results was made for both the ambient atmosphere and for several specific perturbations. The results for the ambient atmosphere are shown in the figures in Chapter 4, which also present the\nmeasurements of atmospheric constituents. Rather than presenting individual calculations, the range of\nmodel results is represented by a band. In most cases, the agreement among the calculated profiles is satisfactory (within a factor of 1.5) and the larger discrepancies can be attributed to specific differences in\nphotochemical input.\nCalculated profiles for the HO, species agree remarkably well with each other, primarily because the models\nused identical rate constants for the HO, partitioning reactions (HO, + NO and HO, + O$ and HO, formation and destruction reactions and similar H,O and CH, profiles. For the NO, species, the width of the band\nof computed profiles arises in large part from use of different NO photolysis rates. The range of ClX profiles\ncomes partly from the different total ClX used (1.9 to 2.3 ppb), but also reflects the use of two formation\nrates for chlorine nitrate given in Chapter 1. This alters the partitioning among the members of the ClX family. The agreement between the different model calculations is as good as could be expected considering that\nthe models are not identical.\n\nI\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\nII\n\nI\n\n339\n\nThe comparison of model results with observations (discussed in detail in Chapter 4) is summarized here to\nfocus on implications of some specific problem areas for perturbation calculations. There is a general agreement between the computed Cl0 concentrations and the average of the recent measurements by Anderson\n(1979) and Menzies (1979). However, the measured Cl0 concentrations in the summers of 1977 and 1978 were\nmuch higher than the model calculations, and also present theories cannot explain the gradient in the Cl0\nprofile below approximately 35 km. The sum of NO + NO, + HNO, in the models is larger than that derived\nby summing concurrent measurements of the individual species. Part of this latter discrepancy could be\nremoved if the vertical diffusion coefficients in the 1-D model were tuned to fit the N,O, CF,Cl, and CFCl,\nmeasurements, rather than a compromise between fitting these and the CH, profile. However, with the present photochemical models, it is not possible to fit the N,O, CF,Cl,, CFCI, and CH, profiles with a unique\nset of vertical diffusion coefficients, unless a method can be found to reduce calculated OH in the lower\nstratosphere (where no data for OH exist). Discrepancies between the calculated and measured HNO,/NO,\nratio would also be reduced by lower calculated OH in the lower stratosphere. (See e.g. McConnell and\nEvans, 1978).\nDisagreements such as these between measurements of atmospheric constituents and model calculations contribute significantly to the uncertainty in perturbation calculations. For example, smaller OH concentrations\nin the lower stratosphere would have large impacts on the results of NO, or CIX perturbation calculations,\nbut in opposite directions. This topic is explored further in the section on uncertainties in model predictions.\n\nPREDICTED OZONE ABUNDANCE\nStratospheric models which employ recommended reaction rate coefficients (Chapter 1) predict high-altitude\n(about 50 km) ozone abundances smaller than measurements of upper stratospheric ozone as noted by Butler\n(1978) and Poppoff et al. (1978). This disagreement arose when the predicted upper stratospheric abundance\nof OH was increased to levels which are in approximate agreement with measurements by Anderson (1976);\nlarger concentrations of OH increase the loss rate of ozone due to reactions of HO, species. The cause of the\ndiscrepancy between measurement and prediction of high-altitude ozone may be caused, in part, by heavier\nweighting of winter ozone data in the empirical model of Krueger and Minzner (1976). The relevance to ozone\nperturbations is not clear because only a negligible part of the total ozone change occurs at these altitudes.\nIn the lower stratosphere, 1-D model predictions of ozone abundance disagree with each other by as much as\n30% as a result of differing globally averaged vertical transport rates (eddy diffusivities). After the introduction of the new value of the rate coefficient for the reaction NO + HO, - NO, + OH, but before the\nmeasurement of the new rate coefficient for HO, + 0, - OH + 20,, lower stratospheric ozone was\noverestimated by all photochemical models. However, when the rate coefficient for the latter reaction was increased to its current value (see Chapter l), the problem of excessive low-altitude ozone largely disappeared\n(see e.g. Whitten et al., 1978).\n\nPERTURBATIONS\nThe model calculations of stratospheric perturbations taken one at a time are the subject of this section.\nPossible interactions among simultaneous perturbations will be considered in the next section. The perturbations considered are ground release of halocarbons, N,O and CO,, changes in tropospheric OH, high-altitude\naircraft operations, rocket exhausts, atmospheric nuclear explosions, and natural events and variations.\n\nGROUND-LEVEL HALOCARBON RELEASES\nChlorofluoromethane Effects\nMost studies of atmospheric halocarbon perturbations have been concerned with the effects on ozone of\nfluorocarbons 11 and 12. The historical release rates, current inventories, and atmospheric budgets of these\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n340\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nfluorocarbons (and other halogen compounds) are reviewed in Chapter 3. Calculations of ozone reductions\ncaused by FC-11 and FC-12 made for this assessment are presented in table 7-2. The results indicate an ozonedepletion efficiency of about 3% of the ozone column per ppbv of CIX, added and roughly a 15 to 18%\neventual ozone decrease for continuous FC-11 and FC-12 release at 1975 rates (with more or less the present\nset of reaction rates).\n\nTable 7-2\nSteady-State Perturbations for 1975 Emission Rates of Fluorocarbons 11 and 12*\n\nModeling\nGroup\n\nAClX\nwb+\n\nLLL\n\n-AO, (col)\n\n-AO, (40 km)\n\nm\n\nw\n\n-AO, (col)\nA ClX\n@/wW\n\n5.5\n\n15\n\n38\n\n2.7\n\nDuPont\n\n6.2\n\n18.3\n\n46.1\n\n3.0\n\nLaRC\n\n6.7\n\n16.2\n\n43\n\n2.4\n\nRDA\n\n5.5\n\n16\n\n42\n\n2.9\n\nHarvard\n\n6.6\n\n18\n\n41\n\n2.7\n\nCal Tech\n\n6.9\n\n18\n\n50\n\n3.1\n\nNOAA\n\n5.8\n\n18\n\n39\n\n3.1\n\nGSFC\nGSFC-UNC\n\n7.0\n\n18\n\n39\n\n2.6\n\n6.9\n\n15.4\n\n55\n\n2.2\n\nAER\n\n5.8\n\n16.7\n\n52\n\n2.9\n\n*Fluorocarbon 11 at 9.4 x lo6 and Fluorocarbon 12 at 13.0 x lo6 molecules\ncm-\xe2\x80\x99 se?\n\nFigure 7-l shows the predicted ozone reductions as a function of altitude for the steady-state case outlined\nabove using the DuPont model. The large percentage ozone reduction near 40 km is a well-known feature of\nphotochemical model predictions. However, the large absolute ozone reductions below 30 km are a relatively\nnew feature due largely to the increased reaction rates used for NO + HO, - NO, + OH and HO, + 0, OH + 0, + O,, and to the inclusion of HOC1 chemistry in models. Although the largest relative changes in\nozone continue to be at about 40 km (as in previous predictions), the bulk of the absolute ozone decrease is\nnow calculated to occur below 30 km.\n\nMODEL\n\n341\n\nPREDICTIONS\n\n50\n\n40\n\nz\nE\nc\n\n30\n\n2\n\n20\n\nI\n10\n\nI\n\nI\n-40%\n\nI\n-20%\n\n-30%\nRELATIVE\n\nOZONE\n\nFigure 7-1.

For this model, the eventual buildup of ClX caused by continuous fluorocarbon release at 1975\nrates is about 6 ppbv, and the corresponding ozone column reduction is about 18%. Although the United\nStates fluorocarbon production rates have begun to decline in recent years, CFM production in the rest of the\nworld has remained approximately constant. Even if production were to cease immediately, the fluorocarbons already in the atmosphere would be expected to continue to affect ozone for many decades as shown by\ncurve 1 of figure 7-2. Also, it takes approximately 5 to 10 years following cessation of CFM production for\nozone recovery to begin, even without accounting for the protracted leakage of fluorocarbons from sealed\nrefrigeration units; the slow recovery is attributable to a delay in transit of fluorocarbons from the\ntroposphere to the middle stratosphere.\n\nI\n\nI IIII\n\n111111111\n\n342\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n0\n1960\n\n1975\n\n2000\n\n2050\nYEAR\n\nFigure 7-2.

They are (I ) constant FC-1 1 and FC-12 release at 1975 rates until\nthe year 2,000, with no subsequent release; (2) constant release at 1975 rates indefinitely; and\n(3) release starting atxe 1975 rates and growing by 5% per year for several decades. The tropospheric lifetimes of fluorocarbons 11 and 12 are assumed to be greater than 100 years. The fluorocarbon ozone reduction in 1975 is taken to be 1.5%. For curve 2, the cross-hatched area reflects\nthe widest range of model predictions available for this assessment.\n\nIf fluorocarbons have natural sinks other than stratospheric photodecomposition,\nthe ozone depletion curves\nin figure 7-2 would be reduced in magnitude and the response times would be shortened. The shortening\nwould roughly follow to the relationship.\n\nwhere r is the overall fluorocarbon lifetime in the atmosphere, rP is the average lifetime due to stratospheric\nphotolysis (approximately 60 years for FC-I 1 and approximately 100 years for FC-12 in current models), and\nrT is the lifetime due to other (tropospheric) processes. With a constant fluorocarbon emission rate, the eventual steady-state fluorocarbon concentration and concomitant ozone reduction vary roughly in proportion to\nr. Thus, a tropospheric FC-12 loss process with a lOO-year time constant cou!d reduce the eventual impact of\nFC-12 on ozone by one-half. The short-term time dependent behavior would not be significantly affected,\nhowever.\n\nMODEL\n\nFREDICTIONS\n\n343\n\nOne natural fluorocarbon sink is the adsorption and subsequent photolyis on sand surfaces. This has been the\nsubject of recent analysis by Rebbert and Ausloos (1978), Gab, et al. (1978) and others. Accurate estimates of\nthe lifetimes attributable to this sink are not yet available. Thus, uncertainties remain in the atmospheric\nlifetimes of CFMs, and this has a direct bearing on the uncertainties in the corresponding stratospheric perturbation scenarios.\nTwo-dimensional\nmodel calculations of fluorocarbon-ozone\nperturbations show that the largest ozone\ndecreases occur at high latitudes in winter; the increase in the computed ozone column depletion from the\nEquator to the pole is a factor of 1.5 in the winter hemisphere and 1.2 in the summer hemisphere (Borucki et\nal., 1979). Two-dimensional model calculations of global ozone reductions are generally consistent with the\none-dimensional model results.\n\nOther Chlorine Perturbations\nChanges in the column content of ozone due to the continued release of chlorine from other chlorocarbon\ncompounds can be estimated from a knowledge of a few simple parameters. The ozone reduction efficiency of\ntable 7-2 relates the column ozone change to the increase in the ClX mixing ratio in the upper stratosphere.\nThe CIX increase can be estimated from a knowledge of the release rate and the atmospheric residence time of\nthe chlorocarbon, and is given by\nAClX=\n\n!?*T=Y\nHT\n\nx lo9 (PPW\n\nwhere $I is the release rate of the chlorocarbon in molecules cm-*se,-\xe2\x80\x99 (assumed constant in time), 7 is the atmospheric residence time in seconds, y is the number of chlorine atoms released from the chlorocarbon, H is\nthe atmospheric scale height (- 8 x lo5 cm), and M is the total atmospheric concentration at the ground (2.5\n1019 molecules cmm3).Then the change in the ozone column abundance N(03) is given by\nx\n\nAN(0,)\n\n= E . ACIX\n\nwhere E is the efficiency (3% per part per billion of AClX according to table 7-2).\nAs an example, this analysis can be applied to methyl chloroform. Assume a release rate for CH,CCl, at the\nground of 5\nlo7 molecules cm-\xe2\x80\x9cset- l. (This is a globally averaged value equivalent to about 1.7 x lo6\nmetric tons of CH,CCl, released each year worldwide, or about three times current production rates.) The\ntropospheric lifetime of CH,CCl, is determined by its reaction with OH. Adopting a six-year lifetime*, an\nemission rate of 5 x 107 molecules cm-*se,-1 leads to a steady-state CH3CC13 concentration of about 450\npptv. Because each methyl chloroform molecule has three chlorine atoms, each of which may be released\nupon decomposition, and the efficiency for ozone reduction is close to 3% per ppbv of ClX, a corresponding\nsteady-state ozone decrease of about 4% is estimated. This value is consistent with detailed model calculations\nmade for this assessment.\nx\n\nOzone reductions caused by other chlorocarbons may be estimated on a similar basis, using individual budget\ninformation tabulated in Chapter 5.\n\n*Estimates of the CH3CC13 lifetime are quite uncertain, reflecting, in part, uncertainties in tropospheric OH. Other researchershave estimated CH3CC13 lifetimes in the range of 6 to 12 years. The impact of CH3CC13 on ozone will vary\nroughly in proportion to its lifetime. Recent measurementsof the reaction between OH and CH3CC13by Kurylo (private\ncommunication, 1979, seeChapter 1) suggest that a minimum six-year residence time is likely.\n\nlllll\n\nII\n\nI II\n\n344\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nBromine And Fluorine Perturbations\nTable 7-3 compares model predictions of ozone reductions corresponding to 20 pptv of bromine in the\nstratosphere. Current stratospheric bromine levels are thought to be 10 to 20 pptv (Lazrus et al. 1976; Wofsy\net al. 1975; Yung et al. 1979). Large increases in atmospheric bromine have not been forecast, but the\nsynergistic interaction with chlorine is considered later in this chapter.\nKnown fluorine chemistry suggests a negligible impact on ozone if fluorine is released in moderate quantities\n(i.e., up to at least a few ppbv) into the stratosphere (Stolarski and Rundel, 1975; Watson et al. 1977).\n\nTable 7-3\nColumn Ozone Change Due to NzO, BrX and Combined Perturbations\nThe first column is the change in the column content of ozone when the NzO flux at the lower boundary\nis doubled. The second column is the ozone column changed when the NzO flux is doubled and CFMs\nare added at the rate defined in table 7-2 carried out to steady-state. Columns 3 and 4 are the ozone\ncolumn content changes due to addition of 20 pptv of CHaBr at the lower boundary and the combination\nof CHa Br and CFMs again carried to steady-state.\n2x@N20\nANW (%I\n\n2xGN20 + CFM\nAN(%) @I\n\nLLL\n\n-2.1\n+1.3\n\n- 9.1\n\nLaRC\n\n-1.9\n\n-11\n\nRDA\n\nto.2\n\n-\n\nHarvard\n\n+3.6\n\nCal Tech\n\n20 pptv BrX + CFM\nAN(%) @)\n-\n\n-15,-11*\n\nDuPont\n\n20 pptvBrX\nNW\n6)\n\n-1.1\n\n-19.3\n-\n\n-2.0\n\n-\n\n- 8.8\n\n-1.0\n\n-19.5\n\n+3.3\n\n-10\n\n-2.4\n\n-\n\nNOAA\n\n-1.2\n\n-10\n\n-1.0\n\n-19\n\nGSFC\n\nt1.5\n\n-11\n\n-0.8\n\n-16.2\n\nGSFC-UNC\n\n- 8.3\n\n*- 15% when slow C 1ONOz formation rate is used, - 11% when fast formation rate is\nused (see Chapter 1 or DeMore et al., 1979).\n\n\xe2\x80\x98MODEL\n\nPREDICTIONS\n\n345\n\nNITROGEN CYCLE CHANGES AND NITROUS OXIDE (NzO)\nNitrous oxide, which is the major source of stratospheric NO,, is a by-product of the biospheric nitrogen cycle. Possible changes in the atmospheric N,O content as a result of increased nitrogen fertilizer usage or other\ndisturbances in the global nitrogen cycle have been discussed by many authors (see Chapter 3 and references\ntherein). In order to compare model sensitivity to N20 changes, a test case was run by each group in which the\nflux of N,O into the atmosphere from the ground was doubled compared to the normal value used in the\nmodel. Table 7-3 shows the results of these runs. The most notable points about these results are that not all\nmodels show the same sign for the ozone change, principally because of different NO photolysis rates, and\nthat the magnitude of the ozone change is significantly smaller than had been previously predicted (see\nJohnston, 1977 and references therein).\nThe primary reason for the change is the increased value of the reaction rate constant for NO + HO, - NO,\n+ OH. NO, in the stratosphere still catalytically destroys ozone but two other effects are now more pronounced. One is the creation of ozone through smog reactions (so called because they are virtually identical to\nreactions which cause photochemical smog in urban air). The sequence of reactions is as follows:\nR. + O,@RO,\nNO+RO,-N02+R0\nNO,+hv-NO+0\nO +O*\xe2\x80\x9c03\n\nR* + 20,\n\n+ hv -\n\nRO + O3\n\nwhere R* could be a hydrogen atom or an organic radical. The rate of this process in the stratosphere is\nlimited by the second reaction, and thus, increased values of its rate constant have led to enhanced levels of\nozone production. The other effect is the enhanced interference of NO, in the normal HO, catalytic destruction of ozone. This is especially pronounced in the lower stratosphere where HO, reactions with ozone are the\ndominant loss mechanism. The resulting decrease in this destruction by added NO, appears as an effective\nproduction rate. The net effect is that in the lower stratosphere such production exceeds destruction for added\nNO, while in the upper stratosphere the opposite still prevails. The net effect on column ozone is a balance of\nthese two responses to added NO,. The changes in rates have also increased the predicted concentration of\nOH and this, in turn, leads to enhanced conversion of NO, to HNO, and to a lower proportion of the atmospheric odd nitrogen being in the more chemically active NO, form.\n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CO,\nAssociated with the anticipated rise in fossil fuel consumption is a concomitant increase in atmospheric CO,.\nSuch an increase has already occurred with a 5% increase between 1958 and 1974 (Eriksson, 1978). Large increases in CO, (i.e., factor of 2) are expected to have the following effects on the stratosphere:\n9 Increased temperatures in the lower stratosphere (1 to 2 K) and reduced temperatures in the upper\nstratosphere (10 to 20 K).\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nIncreased temperatures at the tropical tropopause (2 to 3 K) which may affect stratospheric water vapor.\nSlightly increased intensity of tropospheric hydrological\nble gases.\n\ncycle which may alter scavenging rates of solu-\n\nIncrease of zonal mean eddy kinetic energy in the stratosphere.\n\n346\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe most significant of these effects is believed to be the rather large decrease in upper stratospheric\ntemperatures. These changes can lead to significant 0, increases above 35 km through temperature sensitive\nphotochemistry. Increasing levels of CO, and CFMs have opposing effects on O,, but both reduce upper\nstratospheric temperatures. This complicates the attribution of any observed 0, and temperature trends to a\nparticular cause. These thermal structure changes due to CO, and CFM increases may alter the phase and\namplitude of long planetary-waves, leading to changes in the dynamic climatology of the stratosphere and\npossibly tropospheric effects. It is important that these potential interactions receive further study.\n\nPERTURBATIONS INDUCED BY CHANGES IN TROPOSPHERIC OH\nThe concentrations of many important species in the stratosphere are in large part determined by processes\nwhich occur in the troposphere, in particular reactions with the OH radical. Reaction with OH is the major\ntropospheric sink for important trace gases such as CO, CH,, H,, CH,Cl, CH3Br, CH,CCl,, and NO,. CO\nand NO, play an important role in regulating the concentration of tropospheric OH, and Wofsy (1976) has\nsuggested that a hemispheric asymmetry in OH exists as a result of the asymmetry in the CO distribution\nnoted by Seiler (1974). Sze (1977) and Chameides et al. (1977a) discussed the possibility that continued CO\nemissions might lead to a decrease in OH and therefore to an increase in the global concentrations of CH, and\nCH,Cl, which could indirectly affect stratospheric ozone.\nSeveral important developments in tropospheric photochemistry have occurred recently, and at present, there\nare many inconsistencies in tropospheric models and estimates of the budgets for CO, NO, and 0,. Ambient\nOH concentrations are uncertain by at least a factor of 5. Moreover, inhomogeneities in background trace-gas\nconcentrations make it difficult to analyze tropospheric photochemistry with a global 1-D model. For these\nreasons, a quantitative assessment has not been made of trends in either tropospheric or stratospheric ozone\nthat might result from future surface emissions of CO and NO,. Quantitative analysis of halocarbon perturbations (e.g., CH,CCl,) to stratospheric ozone is also hindered by a lack of knowledge of ambient OH concentrations as a function of latitude, altitude, season and location.\n\nHIGH-ALTITUDE\n\nAIRCRAFT OPERATIONS\n\nTable 7-4 summarizes the current model results for point source injections of nitrogen oxides at two different\naltitudes, 17 and 20 km. In each case the ozone-column change is positive for the injection rate of 1 x lo*\nmolecules cm-*set-l. Also shown is the local change in the ozone concentration at 20 and 40 km illustrating the\ntendency of the competing mechanisms to give ozone decreases in the upper stratosphere and compensating\nincreases in the lower stratosphere. Because the upper and lower stratospheric changes of ozone do not depend on the injected NO, flux in exactly the same way and because the change in the ozone column is small\ncompared to the local positive and negative changes, the response of the ozone column is a nonlinear function\nof the magnitude of the NO, injection rate as shown in figure 7-3 from Turco et al. (1978). These results suggest that, for large enough NO, injections, ozone reduction would occur. To place these results in the context\nof proposed SST operations the so-called upper bound CIAP fleet corresponds to about 2 x lo* molecules\nNO, cm-* set-1 when globally averaged. The amount of NO, injection required to reverse the sign of the ozone\ncolumn change is many times the upper bound CIAP fleet.\nThe above considerations have been for NO, injections only. High altitude aircraft will also inject H,O in\npotentially significant amounts leading to increases in HO, concentrations (Turco et al., 1978). Figure 7-3 indicates the effect of inclusion of H20 injection with the NO, injection at 20 km as calculated in the RDA\nmodel. In addition, figure 7-4 presents a typical altitude profile of ozone concentration change illustrating\nthat a large ozone increase at low altitudes offsets a smaller decrease at high altitudes. SST calculations made\nwith a 2-D model by Whitten et al. (1977) indicate that the ozone reductions at the Equator are about l/3 less\nthan at 70\xe2\x80\x9dN latitude.\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\n347\n\nTable 7-4\nSteady-State Ozone Perturbation for an NOx Injection Rate of 1 x IO8 NO Molecules/cm\xe2\x80\x99-set*\n\nModeling\nGroup\n\nI\n\nr\n\nInjection at 17-18 km\n\n1\n\nInjection at 20 km\n\nAO, (col)\n(%)\n\nIO, (40 km)\n(%)\n\nAO, (20 km)\nm\n\nno, (co])\n(%I\n\n10, (40 km)\nm\n\nIO, (20 km)\n(%I\n\nLLL\n\nt1.4\n\n-1.9\n\n+5 .o\n\nt1.3\n\nDuPont\n\n+2.6\n\n-1.2\n\n+5.1\n\nt2.9\n\n-1.9\n\n+ 7.7\n\nLaRC\n\n+1.4\n\n-1.2\n\n+3.2\n\n+1.1\n\n-2.4\n\n+ 4.1\n\n+2.4\n\n-2.0\n\n+ 6.3\n\n+4.6\n\n-2.3\n\n+11.\n\n-2.3\n\n+ 3.0\n\nRDA\n\n+2.6\n\n-1.5\n\nt6.0\n\nHarvard\n\n+3.4\n\n+6.9\n\nCal Tech\n\nt2.2\n\n-1.1\n-1.4\n\nNOAA\n\n+1.3\n\n-1 .o\n\nt2.0\n\nt1.2\n\nGSFCUNC\n\n+1.5\n\n-1.1\n\nt4.4\n\n+2.2\n\n*Or about 1.1 X lo9 kgNO,/yr\n\n+5.1\n\nover the globe.\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\n348\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\n0\n\nVALUES COMPUTED USING A WOFSY-TYPE\nDIFFUSION COEFFICIENT\n\n0\n\nVALUES COMPUTED WITH A DICKINSONCHANG DIFFUSION PROFILE\n1\n\n0\n\nNO, INJECTION\n\nFigure 7-3.

The LLL model indicates a lower sensitivity to Hz0 in the lower stratosphere (Duewer, Private communication).\n\n350\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE: PRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nEngine emissions of high-altitude aircraft also include soot and sulfur dioxide which have the potential to affect the stratospheric aerosol layer. Recent calculations by Turco et al. (1979b) indicate that a fleet of several\nhundred SSTs would perturb the aerosol layer by less than 20% leading to probably insignificant climatic\nalterations. See also Oliver et al. (1977) and Pollack et al. (1976b).\n\nROCKET EXHAUSTS AND BY-PRODUCTS\nSpace shuttle launch and re-entry operations generate NO,. However, Potter (1978) reports that the amounts\nare too small to produce a noticeable change in ozone. Greatly increased rocket activity associated with the\nconstruction of a satellite power system (SPS) could lead to increased rates of NO, generation. Launch\ngenerated NO, is predicted by R. P. Turco (private communication) to have less than a 0.01% effect on global\nozone, (for - 400 launches/yr) but the related re-entry problem has not yet been carefully analyzed.\nThe solid-fueled boosters to be used on space shuttle launch vehicles release HCI into the stratosphere as an\nexhaust constituent. Current 1-D model calculations indicate that 60 space shuttle launches per year could\nreduce the ozone layer by 0.2 to 0.3% worldwide. Calculations made with a 2-D model by R. C. Whitten\n(private communication), which assumed launches at 30\xe2\x80\x9dN, indicate that: (1) the corridor effect is minimal\nwith improved chemistry and transport parameterizations; (2) the largest ozone reduction occurs at high northern latitudes for all seasons; and (3) the increase in column ozone reduction in going from the Equator to\n70\xe2\x80\x9dN is approximately a factor of 2.\nSpace shuttle is predicted to inject 8 IO\xe2\x80\x99 kg/yr of water vapor into the stratosphere while the proposed\nHeavy Lift Launch Vehicle would inject 2 . lo9 kg/yr for 300 launches per year. These injections may be compared with the natural stratospheric injection rate due to Hadley cell upweiling in the tropics of the order of\nlOI kg&. (Ellsaesser and Kley, private communication). Thus, the direct rocket injections are not expected\nto have much effect.\nl\n\nThe solid-fueled boosters on the space shuttle also inject aluminum oxide particles into the stratosphere (Potter, 1978). Calculations by Turco et al. (1979b) suggest that these particles would have only a small effect on\nstratospheric aerosols, and probably a negligible effect on global climate. (See also Hofmann et al., (1975)\nand Pollack et al., 1976b)\n\nATMOSPHERIC NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS\nThere are two contexts in which this source of stratospheric perturbation is considered: previous atmospheric\ntests and a potential nuclear war. The former are particularly important to study because ozone data records\nexist for comparison to the models. The primary effect in both cases is augmentation of the rate of\nstratospheric odd-nitrogen production.\n\nNuclear Tests\nDuring 1961 and 1962, the US and USSR detonated some 340 megatons (MT) of explosives in the atmosphere, producing some 2 to 4 x 1O34NO molecules in the stratosphere (primarily from the Soviet tests in\nNovaya Zemlya at 75 \xe2\x80\x9cN). Since the ambient stratospheric loading of NO,, (= NO + NO, + HNO,) is of\norder 4 to 15 x 1O34molecules, a significant effect was anticipated by Foley and Ruderman (1973) but not\nobserved by Angel1 and Korshover (1973) (See also Bauer and Gilmore, 1975).\n\n351\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\nThe question is: Why was no effect observed? There are a number of factors, all of which appear to have\nworked together:\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nThe biggest effects on ozone would undoubtedly have been observed at\nwinter following the Soviet test series in the Fall of 1962. Observations\nthese times and latitudes because of the low solar zenith angle, the high\nparticular limitations of the M-83 photometer compared to the Dobson\nthere were no satellite observations).\n\nhigh latitudes\nof ozone are\nfrequency of\n(note that in\n\nin late fall and\nvery difficult at\nclouds, and the\n1961 and 1962,\n\nMost of the NO injections caused by the large explosions occurred between 20 to 30 km. As the\nunderstanding of stratospheric photochemistry developed, it became recognized that NO, injections\nbelow approximately 20 km will increase ozone, while only injections at higher altitudes reduce ozone by\nthe catalytic cycles. The absolute magnitude of expected changes has also decreased, and the latest 1-D\ncalculations of W. Duewer et al. (private communication, June 1979) give a maximum ozone reduction\nof 2% if it is assumed that the 58 MT bomb cloud rose to 33 km (Foley-Ruderman cloud rise). But if it is\nassumed that this cloud only rose to 19 km (Seifz\xe2\x80\x99estimate), the net ozone change was a maximum increaseof I %. By contrast, using earlier (1974) chemistry, an 8 to 10% ozone reduction was computed\nfor either estimate of cloud rise.\nA 1-D global/annual average model, such as the calculations of Duewer et al. (1977), overestimates the\neffects of the actual (late fall-high latitude) injections because the initial insolation needed for\nphotochemical reactions to take place was very weak, and the strong winter circulation then took much\nof the injected NO, out of the stratosphere before it was able to affect the ozone through catalytic\ncycles. As reported by Quiroz (private communication 1979), there was a particularly strong inversion in\nthe stratospheric circulation in January 1963 which swept the injected NO, due to the 180 MT Soviet test\nseries of 1962 out of the atmosphere even faster than during an average winter.\n\nPotential Nuclear War\nDuring a large-scale nuclear exchange, approximately 10,000 megatons (TNT equivalent) of nuclear explosives might be detonated in the atmosphere. Depending on the yield of the explosions, average column\nozone depletions of 30 to 60% for the first year (over the Northern Hemisphere) have been predicted by\nDuewer et al. (1978). These results are consistent with earlier calculations by MacCracken and Chang (1975),\nand Whitten et al. (1975).\n\nNATURAL EVENTS AND VARIATIONS\nA variety of natural phenomena can also affect the stratosphere. Among these are impulsive phenomena,\nsolar-proton events and volcanic eruptions and more gradual variations such as solar UV output and interplanetary magnetic field modulation of galactic cosmic rays.\n\nSolar-Proton Events\nSolar-proton events (SPE) involve high-energy protons which can penetrate into the atmosphere to 35 km and\nbelow, producing ionization, NO, molecules, and OH radicals (Frederick, 1976). The series of flares of 4 to 8\nAugust 1972 gave rise to approximately 3 x lO33 NO molecules and 4.5 x 1O33OH radicals, which may be\ncompared with the ambient stratospheric loading of 4 to 15 x lO34 molecules of NO, (= NO + NO, +\nHNO,) and 1.5 to 3 x 1O33molecules of HO, (= OH + HO,) according to Bauer (1978) (Note that the HO,\nlifetime is only about one hour.)\n\n352\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nThe only large SPE on which there are adequate observational data is that of August 1972. Crutzen et al.\n(1975a) predicted an ozone reduction at high geomagnetic latitudes and high altitudes (approximately 45 km)\nwhich has been observed by Heath et al. (1977). However, the lower altitude behavior (less than 30 km) where\nmost ozone resides has not been adequately investigated; this domain is particularly significant because it is\nhere that details of the chemistry and dynamics and their interaction are important in explaining the observed\nphenomena.\nSPEs appear to take place primarily during the decrease in solar activity following a solar maximum. From\nother large events of 1956, 1959, and 1960, a large variability is reported; see e.g. Bauer (1978).\nThere are other ionizing events that might be expected to produce NO, and HO, (such as aurorae, X-ray\nflares, relativistic electron precipitation events, and galactic cosmic ray deposition), but they either produce\ntheir effects in the mesosphere far above the ozone layer, or have such a weak intensity (galactic cosmic rays)\nthat no evidence of an effect on ozone has been observed.\n\nVolcanic Eruptions\nVolcanic eruptions inject large amounts of various materials into the atmosphere. (Table 7-5 lists two\nestimates of stratospheric injections caused by the 1963 eruptions of Mt. Agung, Bali at Latitude 8.5 O,\nLongitude 115.5 \xe2\x80\x9cE). From volcanic eruptions, water, sulfur compounds (mainly SO,) and hydrochloric acid\nwould probably be injected sometimes above the local tropopause and would be expected to produce a significant and long-lasting reduction of OH in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere according to Cadle\nand Friend (private communication), with significant effects on stratospheric ozone. A preliminary and partial calculation of the effects of HCl alone has been made by Stolarski and Butler (1978), but no realistic\nsimulation has yet been made.\nA large explosive volcanic eruption may inject a large amount of water into the stratosphere: two current\nestimates of the stratospheric water injection due to the 1963 eruption of Mt. Agung indicate (2 x 101o-lO1l)\nkg injected into the stratosphere (16-23 km)-see Bauer (1979)-which\ncould be locally significant.\nSignificant explosive volcanic eruptions occur every few years, as noted by Bauer (1978), but the 1963 Agung\neruption has been the largest in the past 25 years. However, the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 sent some 3 to\n10 times more material into the atmosphere than that of Agung, while the eruption of Tambora in 1816 was\nsome 3 to 10 times that of Krakatoa. It is possible that these events represent statistical lOO-year and 250-year\nvolcanic eruptions.\n\nSolar UV Variability\nThe solar ultraviolet irradiance determines the overall level of stratospheric ozone, principally by the\nphotodissociation processes that lead to the original formation of ozone, and also by the local heating\nresulting from the absorption of solar UV and the changes in temperature, photochemistry, and dynamics\nresulting from this heating.\nThere are indications that solar UV irradiance shows some time variation: EUV (Xc 100 nm) increases\nsignificantly from solar flares, variation with the 27-day solar rotation period, and according to Vidal-Madjar\n(1977), the intensity at Lyman (Y (121.6 nm) varies by a factor of 2 between solar maximum/high activity and\nsolar minimum/low activity. There is also an effective 6.6% variation in the solar constant associated with the\nvariation in Sun-Earth distance between summer and winter.\n\nMODEL\n\n353\n\nPREDICTIONS\n\nTable 7-5\nTwo Estimates of the Stratospheric Source Function of the 1963 Agung Eruption Cloud\n\nI\n\nMass, kg\n\nI\n\nSource\n\nEstimate of Cadle\net al.

(1979),\nLepel et al. (1978), and Stith et al. (1978).\n\n354\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nHowever, for longer wavelengths and longer time periods, the character and magnitude of any variation\nbecomes quite uncertain. Heath and Thekaekara (1977) have reviewed measurements of solar UV in the 180\nto 350 nm wavelength range over the period from 1964 to 1975, and infer a 20 to 50% variation over the 200\nto 300 nm wavelength range, which they correlate with the 11-year sunspot cycle. The problem has been\nreviewed by numerous others, such as White (1977), Delaboudiniere et al. (1978), Nicolet (1979), and Simon\n(1978), who neither accepknor refute the conclusion of Heath and Thekaekara (1977) but seem to indicate\nthat their results represent an upper bound on the magnitude of the effect. In fact, it is difficult (if not impossible) to infer a solar cycle trend over a total period of 11 years. Thus, Nicolet (1979) points out that the\nvariation in calibration procedures over the 1964 to 1975 time period is large so that the precision of the individual measurements is on the order of 25%, with an unknown accuracy.\nCalculations of ozone depletion over an 1l-year sunspot cycle have been made by Callis and Nealy (1978) and\nPenner and Chang (1978), who find that the extreme model of Heath and Thekaekara (1977) leads to an increase in total ozone of 8 to 10% going from solar minimum to solar maximum. This would be a very large effect, dominating all others over the 1957 to 1975 time frame for which there exist global ozone measurements.\nHowever, it must be noted that the best current estimates of total ozone over this period made by Angel1 and\nKorshover (1973, 1976, 1978d) provide no unambiguous evidence that total ozone varies with solar cycle.\n\nCOUPLED PERTURBATIONS\nMost previous assessments of possible changes in stratospheric ozone have focused on the effects of a single\nperturbation, such as NO, emissions by high flying aircraft, use of chlorofluorocarbons,\nand the possibility\nof an increase in global N,O. In the real atmosphere many changes are occurring and will continue to occur at\nthe same time. Thus studies of simultaneous perturbations and their interactions will prove to be necessary to\nunderstanding of atmospheric changes. Several published studies, (Logan et al. 1978; and Liu et al. 1976)\nhave addressed the question of simultaneous perturbations and show that they interact in a nonlinear fashion,\nas expected given the coupling reactions in the ClX - HO, 1 NO, photochemistry.\nAn example of such coupling is that the effect on the ozone column of an increase in stratospheric chlorine\ndepends on the background N,O. At higher concentrations of N,O, more chlorine will be present in the form\nof chlorine nitrate. This, together with the reaction Cl0 + NO - Cl + NO, suppresses the concentration of\nCl0 and therefore reduces the efficiency of the chlorine catalytic cycle for ozone destruction.\nThe net effect of NO, injections into the lower stratosphere on ozone column-density is a balance between\nNO, catalyzed ozone destruction NO, interference in other catalytic cycles, and NO, enhanced ozoneproducing smog reactions. If water vapor is injected together with the NO,, it will modify all of these effects,\nas well as contributing directly to HO, induced destruction of ozone.\nA newly appreciated synergistic effect is the interaction of BrX with ClX radicals. The key reaction is BrO +\nCIO - Br + Cl + 0, by which the presence of BrX radicals permits a recycling of Cl0 to C1 without atomic\noxygen and provides an avenue for ClX catalyzed ozone destruction at night.\nA number of modeling groups have made studies of combined perturbations. In particular, the groups who\ncontributed to this report performed calculations with doubled N,O flux together with a steady-state CFM\nrelease at 1975 production rates, and a 20 pptv addition of BrX together with the same CFM perturbation.\nThe results for column 0, change are given in table 7-3. In the N,O + CFM case, the effects (with one exception) are less than those for CFM alone, regardless of whether the model used predicts an ozone increase or\ndecrease due to N20 doubling. In no case is the resulting effect a simple addition of the separate ozone\nchanges for the two perturbations. In the case of BrX combined with CFM, a simple addition of the effects\ndominates for the small amounts of BrX considered.\n\n355\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\nObviously, the possibilities for combined perturbations of stratospheric ozone are many. In assessing an individual source of pollution, all of the other changes taking place in the real atmosphere can be ignored.\nHowever, to predict the actual fate of global ozone, it is necessary to include all of the expected changes in\nboth the natural and anthropogenic inputs to the atmosphere, and this produces considerable additional\nsources of uncertainty.\n\nUNCERTAINTIES\nThere are two types of uncertainties present in predictions of stratospheric response to perturbations: uncertainties in model input parameters and uncertainties inherent in the model representing the atmosphere.\n\nUNCERTAINTIES IN MODEL INPUT PARAMETERS\nTo date, two techniques have been developed and applied to the quantification of uncertainties in predictions\nof stratospheric ozone depletion. The first of these is the sensitivity technique as described in NAS (1976) and\nin Hudson (1977). The second technique is the Monte-Carlo approach which is described by Stolarski et al.\n(1978). Both of these methods have been applied extensively to the question of chlorofluoromethane\neffects\non the stratospheric ozone, but neither has been used to study the other possible pollutants. The most recent\nresults for the CFM problem were performed by Butler (private communication 1979). The input set used was\nessentially the same as that recommended by Hudson (1977) except for more current values for the rates of the\nreactions HO, + O,, NO + HO,, OH + O,, for the photolysis rate of N,O; and for the quantum yield of\nO(lD) in 0, photolysis. Considering changes in the input data set currently in use, the qualitative features of\nthe results are emphasized.\nTable 7-6 below gives results of CFM-induced ozone depletion for the Monte-Carlo technique using two different distribution functions for input parameters. In the Log-Normal case, the random numbers used to vary\ninput parameters followed a Gaussian distribution of unit width, while in the Square case, the random\nnumbers were uniformly distributed between plus and minus one. In both cases, the random factors were applied to the log of the input parameter and the size of the factor was proportional to the uncertainty in the individual parameter. The centerline ozone depletion was 19.75% for steady-state CFM release at 1975 rates.\nTable 7-6\nMonte Carlo Uncertainty Factors\nComputed uncertainty factors on change of the column\ncontent of ozone for a steady-state CFM addition. The\ncomputed centerline value should be multiplied by the\nappropriate factor to obtain the * la and 220 values.\nLog normal and square refer to two different input\nprobability distributions as explained in the text.\n-2a\n\n-la\n\nLog Normal\n\n.38\n\n.66\n\n1.23\n\n1.51\n\nSquare\n\n.61\n\n.79\n\n1.15\n\n1.33\n\n+10\n\n+2u\n\nThis implies a 2u range of the prediction of 7.5% to 29.8% for uncertainties in reaction rates and photolysis\nparameters. The square input distribution eliminates all cases where any parameter is more than la away from\nits accepted value and clearly narrows the range of uncertainty.\n\n356\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nIn these results, the output was found to be best fit by a linear normal distribution, but the mean of the\ndistribution was always below the center-line result. This indicates a small saturation on the high side which\nmay be due to physical feedbacks, or to the intrinsic lack of Iinearity in a percentage depletion. The extent to\nwhich uncertainty factors are constant (given different sized CFM perturbations) was tested. At a smaller perturbation, the uncertainties increased.\nAnother result of the Monte-Carlo study dealt with the elimination of nonphysical cases from the uncertainty\ndistributions. In this exercise, a given case was eliminated if certain well-measured quantities, (such as ozone\nor nitrous oxide) differed from the center-line result by more than a given factor. About one-third of the cases\nwere eliminated by this test, and although they were distributed more broadly than all the cases taken\ntogether, the remaining distribution did not give significantly smaller uncertainties.\nStudies were made to examine the uncertainty due to reaction rates only. The results did not differ significantly from those for rates and photolysis parameters together. This indicates that photolysis parameters contribute little to the uncertainty of CFM effects on ozone, and the sensitivity results confirm this.\nTable 7-7 shows the sensitivities and uncertainties\n\ncalculated with the same model used in the Monte-Carlo\n\nstudies.\nIn principle, the uncertainties arising from the eddy-profile determination are also quantifiable. Several\ngroups have studied the same models with different eddy coefficients (see figure 7-5). Wuebbles (private communication, 1979) compared the studies with the Chang (1974) profile, the Hunten (1975a) profile, and the\nNAS (1976) profile and found maximum change in the 1978 level of ozone depletion from CFM of roughly a\nfactor of 1.25. This involves both changes in the u!timate steady-state value of ozone depletion and in the time\nhistory of CFM injection into the stratosphere. Miller (private communication, 1979) indicates that comparing the DuPont standard profile with the Chang-Dickinson (NAS 1976) profile gives a factor of 1.08 difference in the steady-state result. Stolarski (private communication, 1979) has studied the effects of a simple\nscaling of K(z) values and found a sensitivity of 0.35 when the lower-boundary conditions were constant\nfluxes. When the lower boundaries were fixed mixing ratios, the sensitivity was almost nonexistent. Although\nthese results are not subject to systematic quantitative comparison, they do indicate that eddy coefficients can\nbe a significant source of uncertainty for CFM induced ozone depletion.\nVery little quantitative work has been done on uncertainties in perturbations other than CFMs. This means\nthat very little quantitative data are known, but some qualitative comments can be made. All ClX perturbations can be expected to be sensitive to the same reaction rates and photolysis parameters as the CFM case,\nand thus, their uncertainty should be similar. Continuous sources such as SSTs and rockets are much more\nsensitive to transport parameters than are perturbations arising from ground-level changes in long-lived\nspecies such as N,O, CFM, CO,, etc. This is because of the direct competition between transport to the\ntropospheric removal region and photochemical activity in the stratosphere, and is compounded by the differences in photochemistry in both the lower and upper stratosphere.\n\nUNCERTAINTIES DUE TO MODEL CONSTRUCTION\nIn general, uncertainties in atmospheric models fall into two major categories: (1) uncertainties due to\nphysical approximations and (2) uncertainties due to omitted chemistry. The first category includes such\nknown factors as latitudinal effects, radiative transfer approximations and feedback mechanisms. These will\nbecome more quantifiable as the state-of-the-art improves, but at present, cannot be determined with accuracy. The second category is basically unquantifiable. As understanding of the chemistry of the atmosphere\nadvances, important omissions in the chemical scheme may be discovered and incorporated, but it is impossible to assess, at any given time, the effect such omissions have on perturbations. Theorists generally strive to\ninclude all of the important chemical reactions and species in their models and to provide estimates on that\nbasis. However, they also speculate on the possible missing chemistry, and ask the kineticists to supply the\nnecessary experimental data to assess the importance of such chemistry.\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\n357\n\nTable 7-7\nSensitivities and Uncertainties of Ozone Depletion Due to CFM at 1975 Rates*\n\nInput\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99\n-\n\nU-\n\n20\n\ns+\n\nut\n\nSC\n\nUC\n\nN,O+O(\xe2\x80\x98D)+NO+NO\n\nI .5x\n\n-0.338\n\n-0.179\n\n-0.488\n\n-0.225\n\n-0.429\n\n-0.198\n\nO+O,+M+O,+M\n\nI .38\n\n-0.142\n\n-0.046\n\n-0.

Profiles of eddy transport coefficients.\n\nUncertainties Due to Diurnal, Latitudinal, and SeasonalVariations\nOver the past few years, it has been found that replacing 24-hour-average approximations with detailed diurnal variations has had a major impact on the magnitude of the estimated perturbation in stratospheric ozone\nfrom CFMs. In a similar manner, the coupling effects due to variations in atmospheric dynamics and\nphotochemistry with latitude and season may also influence calculated perturbations.\nAt present, the only practical techniques for assessing latitudinal and seasonal effects are 2-D models with\nparameterized transport. These models can include sufficient chemistry to make the assessment meaningful,\nand yet, do not require excessive amouunts of computation time. Despite objections concerning the atmospheric dynamics of parameterized transport 2-D models (see Chapter 2), such models should perform an\ninherently better job of describing the chemical behavior of the atmosphere than 1-D parameterized transport\nmodels.\nIn general, the accuracy of parameterized transport models for large perturbation predictions is limited by the\nmagnitude of dynamic feedback mechanisms. The models also suffer from the problems associated with\nspecification of an accurate transport parameterization (because of the present inadequate data base), and\nfrom the question of whether an eddy-transport parameterization can ever really describe transport of longlived species in a suitable manner. Nevertheless, recent developments in the theory of Lagrangian transport of\n\nIIIII\n\n360\n\nIll\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE\n\nmass in the atmosphere by Dunkerton (1978) and Andrews and McIntyre (1978a) lend credence to the concept\nthat a 2-D parameterized transport treatment of the dynamics in a primarily photochemitial model may be\ncapable of permitting a realistic description. This is especially true if allowance is made for an asymmetric\neddy-diffusion tensor in the model. As has been noted by Danielsen and Louis (1977), asymmetries in the\neddy-diffusion tensor are equivalent to modifications in the mean meridional stream function for mass\ntransport. Thus, suitable choices in the asymmetric portion of the eddy-diffusion tensor provide the possibility of obtaining a Lagrangian-mean meridional flow field different from the ordinary Eulerian flow field used\nas the basis for many current 2-D models. Although there may be difficulties with 2-D models at high\naltitudes where the chemical behavior of the atmosphere is determined to a large extent by photochemistry,\nthe objections to the use of parameterized transport are not nearly as convincing.\nIf a 2-D parameterized transport model reasonably describes the observed latitudinal and seasonal behavior\nof certain key long-lived trace species in the lower stratosphere and troposphere (such as N,O, ozone, and\nCFMs), then it is possible that it also provides a good description of the behavior of most other chemical\nspecies as well. There are several reasons for this. First, in terms of the chemical behavior of the atmosphere,\nif the model calculates the transport of long-lived species correctly then the photochemistry dictates interconversion between short-lived species within long-lived families. Secondly, the generally upward-moving\nlong-lived species such as CFMs, NZO, and CH, may all undergo a similar general scheme of transport and\nchemistry in the lower stratosphere (characterized by upwelling in the tropics to provide maximum mixing\nratios) and in the middle tropical stratosphere (characterized by major photochemical destruction). The\nbehavior of the general downward-moving species such as ozone (below 30 km), odd nitrogen and ClX in the\nlower stratosphere are virtually the inverse of the calculation for the long-lived species.\n\nGiven the potential of 2-D parameterized transport models to provide an improved description of the\nbehavior of chemical species in the atmosphere the uncertainties due to latitudinal and seasonal averaging\nprocedures of 1-D models may be assessed by comparison with 2-D model results. Such a comparison has\nbeen carried out by Whitten et al. (1977) using the NASA Ames 2-D model as a basis. In this comparison the\npredicted global mean perturbations in stratospheric ozone in a CFM scenario are roughly in agreement for\nthe 1-D and 2-D models, assuming similar vertical transport. Furthermore, there are indications that the trace\nspecies concentrations calculated in the 1-D model are quite similar to the 2-D model results at approximately\n30\xe2\x80\x9d latitude (seasonally averaged). Therefore, for this particular type of perturbation, the tentative conclusion is that the uncertainties due to latitudinal and seasonal effects are small. Results from the Ames 2-D\nmodel for certain other perturbations such as SSTs and solid-fueled rockets produce conclusions similar to\nthose for CFMs, although so-called corridor effect related to the pattern of injections (i.e., at midlatitudes in\nthe Northern Hemisphere) must be considered.\n\nUncertainties Due to Missing Chemistry\nUncertainties due to missing chemistry in 1-D models are very difficult to assess, even in the case of proposed\nbut unmeasured reactions. Significant discrepancies between model predictions and actual experimental\nmeasurements in the atmosphere may be an indication of chemistry omitted from models. Such discrepancies\nshould receive careful attention, since if omitted chemistry is the cause, it could have a profound influence on\nthe magnitude of certain perturbation predictions.\nThe comparison of model-computed ambient concentration with measurements suggests several systematic\ndifferences between model and observation. A number of speculative mechanisms have been proposed by McConnell and Evans (1978), and Prasad and Burton (1979) to correct these differences. However, the identification of the actual sources of differences between model and observation is difficult. Thus there is a suggestion that present models omit (or poorly represent) some significant chemical or physical processes or that\nthe data coverage is somehow inadequate and that substantial changes in computed sensitivities may occur.\n\nMODEL PREDICTIONS\n\n. 361\n\nUncertainties Due to Treatment of Radiative Transfer\nThe transport of solar radiation through the atmosphere is a key factor in determining the rate of\nphotodissociation of atmospheric species. One-dimensional atmospheric models employ a number of simplifying approximations in the calculation of radiative transfer, which lead to uncertainties with respect to both\nspecies concentration profiles and perturbation estimates.\nThe present state-of-the-art 1-D model treatment of radiative transfer includes absorption of radiation by 0,\nand O,, multiple scattering by atmospheric molecules, and reflection of radiation by the ground. Individual\natmospheric 1-D models handle the calculation with varying degrees of sophistication. For example, in the\ncase of multiple scattering, it is often common to use phase functions other than the Rayleigh-phase function\n(e.g., isotropic or double stream). This type of approximation has been shown by Miller et al. (1978) to be accurate for certain solar zenith angles, but remains to be tested at zenith angles greater than 60\xe2\x80\x9d.\nMost state-of-the-art 1-D models neglect curvature effects in the treatment of radiation transfer and assume a\nflat parallel atmosphere. This approach is valid for solar zenith angles less than 75 \xe2\x80\x98, but it can also lead to inaccuracies in the calculated diurnal variations in short-lived species near sunrise and sunset. In the case of perturbation calculations, the inaccuracies introduced by the neglect of curvature are believed to be quite small.\nAlthough simple corrections for curvature effects exist in the pure absorption situation, the inclusion of\nmultiple scattering in the calculation leads to a complicated 2-D problem.\nThe majority of 1-D models neglect scattering by aerosol particles and clouds in the radiation transfer calculations, and instead lump these effects into an increased albedo at ground level. Some testing of the implications\nof this approximation on photolysis rates has been carried out by Callis (1977), but additional work must be\nperformed to determine the impact on perturbations.\nThe albedo at the surface of the Earth is known to be a function of latitude and season, but such effects are\nnot included in 1-D models because of global averaging. There is a need for the latitudinal and seasonal variation of albedo to be included in 2-D models to provide an assessment of this uncertainty. Sensitivity studies of\nthe type described above should also be carried out to examine the sensitivity of various perturbations to the\nadopted ground-level value of the albedo. Although the reflection of radiation at the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface is known\nto be nondiffuse, 1-D models commonly assume diffuse reflection for simplicity. Further studies should focus\non the implications of the diffuse-reflection approximation on the uncertainties of 1-D model predictions.\nFor some processes (e.g., NO and H,O photolysis), the penetration of light through the Schumann-Runge absorption bands of 0, is of great importance. A number of somewhat different treatments by Hudson and\nMahle (1972), Nicolet and Vergison (1971), Ackerman and Biaume (1970a), Fang, et al. (1974), Turco (1975)\nare in current use. All such approximations are sensitive to the shape and width of the 0, absorption lines.\nThese parameters are uncertain enough to have a substantial effect on processes such as NO photolysis, as\nnoted by Frederick and Hudson (1979a).\n\nFeedbacks\nThere are a number of atmospheric processes that can serve as positive or negative feedbacks on stratospheric\nozone perturbation. Many of these have been hypothesized but few are included in most 1-D models. The\nmost prominent is temperature feedback. It is well known that ozone absorption of ultraviolet sunlight is the\nprincipal heat source in the middle atmosphere. As ozone is perturbed, the temperature structure responds\nand feedback through temperature-dependent\nrate coefficients and atmospheric pressure to mitigate or\nenhance the ozone change. This effect has been calculated by several groups such as Chandra et al. (1978) using Newtonian cooling approximations which are questionable below 30 km. The feedback effect was not\n\n362\n\nTHE STRATOSPHERE:\n\nPRESENT\n\nAND FUTURE\n\nfound to be substantial, and most groups have continued omitting this from their calculations. There is also a\nfurther feedback such that a change in temperature structure implies a change in transport. To use this in a\nI-D model, a temperature-dependent eddy coefficient would have to be devised, and there is no basis for doing so.\nA combined temperature and dynamics feedback that has received considerable mention is the tropical\ntropopause cold trap. The concept is that the water-vapor content of the lower stratosphere is substantially\ncontrolled by the temperature of the tropical tropopause and limited to the saturation mixing ratio at this\ntemperature. Thus, if the temperature is changed at this point in the atmosphere, the water-vapor abundance\ncan change throughout the stratosphere. Dobson et al. (1946) and Brewer (1949) orginated this idea which was\nmore recently discussed by Liu et al. (1976) and Chapter 3 of this report. At present, the basis for quantifying\nthis feedback and including it in routine model calculations does not exist, and thus, despite its long history, it\ntoo must remain a source of uncertainty.\nA further source of feedback is potential changes in the troposphere and biosphere that might result if ozonecolumn density in the stratosphere changes substantially. Chemical changes resulting from altered UV flux\nmay be expressed in modified OH concentrations which would, in turn, change the tropospheric lifetimes of\ncompounds such as CH,Cl and CH,CCl,. Living organisms and the ecosystems in which they are imbedded\nmay respond directly to UV change, or indirectly to climatic or chemical changes, and alter the biogenic\nsources of N,O, CH,, or CH,Cl, which form key minor constituents of the stratosphere. Most stratospheric\n1-D models now include the troposphere and attempt to account for the direct chemical feedbacks of the\ntroposphere. However, as indicated earlier, the 1-D approximation is not as physically appropriate in the\ntroposphere as in the stratosphere, and tropospheric chemistry appears both more complex and less well\nunderstood than stratospheric chemistry. As yet, there is no quantitative basis for assessing climatic or\nbiospheric response. Thus, tropospheric feedbacks are a considerable source of unquantified uncertainty.\nThere may be direct climatic feedbacks which are as yet undetermined. In addition to the changes in transport\nand UV heating already alluded to, there are potential changes in radiative balance arising from changes in\nground albedo, modified abundances of IR active gases, and changes in aerosol content of the atmosphere.\nAn assessment of these feedbacks must await general improvements in the understanding of the atmosphere.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe uncertainties associated with estimating the long-term impact of several perturbing influences to the\nstratospheric ozone layer continue to be large. However, prospects appear good for improving the situation in\nthe near future.\nThe easily quantifiable uncertainties related to existing model parameter inputs such as reaction rates, cross\nsections, boundary conditions, etc., can be reduced significantly in the near future through the availability of\nnew kinetic and atmospheric data. On the other hand, the reduction of uncertainties due to model construction is not as close because of the time delay required to bring about advances in modeling capabilities.\nAlthough 1-D models continue to be a powerful tool for approximating trace species behavior on a globally\naveraged basis and for making assessments of perturbations, the need still exists for additional development\nin the area of 2-D modeling.\nBecause of presently unquantifiable\nuncertainties (such as omitted processes) models must be used as\ndiagnostic tools to compare theoretical predictions with measurements. When discrepancies are discovered a\nsearch must be made for the possible role of missing chemistry, omitted physical processes, or inappropriate\nnumerical approximations.\n\nREFERENCES\nAckerman, M., Stratospheric water vapor from high resolution infrared spectra, Planet.

Abstract\n\nThis document reports the conclusions of a Workshop held by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in June, 1979, to assess\nthose aspects of our current knowledge that pertain to the modification of\nthe stratosphere by anthropogenic activities which lead to the release of halocarbons, nitrous and nitric\noxide, carbon dioxide, etc. Naturally occurring perturbations such as related to solar or volcanic activity\nare likewise considered. The basis of model description is given in terms of the laboratory data for rates\nand cross sections and the types of models suitable for various purposes. Observed distributions of various\ntrace species are considered in terms of their sources and removal mechanisms and are compared to values\nfrom models. Stratospheric meteorology is discussed in terms of the effects of dynamics on the distribution\nof species. Model predictions of ozone depletion are given for various scenarios; the accuracy to which such\nchanges in ozone content may be detected in available observational data is discussed.\n\n17.
