In\nthe meantime, single-mode, frequency-stabilized gas lasers having been\ndeveloped, it became clear that their use as reference source s would allow\nFourie r spectroscopy to be extended to ve ry much highe r re solving powe rs.\nThe MK 11 inte rfe romete r, constructed and te sted by J. Pinard (19651968) (Refs. 10 and 11) demonstrated the practicability of this extension.\nThe carriage displacement was equal to 80 cm, giving A\n= 160 cm; the\nmax\n-3\n-1\nre solution was 0 rr=:. 1/A\n= 6 X 10 cm . The new technique s developed\nmax\nwere:\n(1)\n\nThe use of the 632.8 nmline from a single-mode He-Ne laser\nstabilized by the Lamb Dip for a reference source.\n\n*By contrast, the technique called "rapid scanning" (Ref. 5) connects the\nmodulation frequency and the exposure time. Its use on weak source s such\nas stars requires the summation of a great many successive interferograms\nin a digital memory. Although well adapted for low-resolution work, it is\ndifficult to use for the kind of problems that inte re st us.\n\n2\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\n(2)\n\nThe use of pressurized oil-bearings for the moving carriage,\ndriven by a two-phase linear motor for the servo; the two\napproaches are easily extensible to greater movements, and the\nvalue of L:.\n\nwas chosen only because it seemed adequate for\nmax\nall conceivable studies.\nThe MK II interferometer was conceived for the study of relatively\nnarrow spectral regions at high resolution.\n\nThe recording and reduction\n\ntechniques were essentially the same as for the MK I; since M\n\n= N,\n\nit follows\n\nthat the maximum number of spectral elements available was M\n_3\n-1\nmax\nIf [) rr = 6 X 10\ncm , the spectral inte rval is reduced to 390 cm -1\n\n= 64,000.\nThis\n\ninstrument, for example, was capable of studying a single vibration-rotation\nband in the nea r infrared.\nThe re sults obtained established, on the one hand, that the de sign re so1ution was attained (it is seve ral time s bette r than that of the be st grating\nspectrometers) and, on the other hand, that the wave-number accuracy was\nequally improved.\n\nIn essence, since there is neithe r scanning of the spec-\n\ntrum nor interpolation between secondary standards, the wave-number scale\nis determined by purely digital operations based upon a single standard line.\n-1\n\n-4\n\n-1\n\nIn a N 0 band near 4,700 cm , an RMS error of 1.5 X 10\ncm\nwas\n2\n7\nobtained by comparison to the calculated positions (an accuracy of 3 X 10 ) .\nIf even greater resolving powers do not seem to be required, then an\n\nincrease in the width of the spectral interval to be studied would be feasible\nand would allow new problems to be attacked at maximum resolution.\nIt is clear that Fourier spectroscopy will not have shown its full power\n\nand the multiplex principle will not be fully exploited until an inte rfe romete r\ncan, in a single inte rfe rag ram, record all the information contained in the\nspectrum of the source to be studied, within the re sponse range of a single\ndetector.\nFor example, a recording of an emission spectrum ought to permit the\nsimultaneous measurement of hyperfine structure (and, eventually, the\nZeeman structure), isotope shifts, the widths and shapes of the lines, and\ntheir absolute positions.\n\nFor sources of limited lifetime, such as radioac-\n\ntive isotopes (ill which we have a great interest),\nobtained in a single run.\n\nall these data could be\n\nThis is impossible by classical techniques.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\n3\n\nIn the study of an astronomical source, one trie s to obtain the highe st\nresolving power allowed by the available energy in a single observing session; however, the MK I interferometer could only reach\n\no(J\n\n= 0.1 cm\n\n-1\n\nat\n\nbe st and this only within one of the three atmosphe ric windows acce s sible\nwith a PbS cell (1 to 2.5 f.lm); hence, three separate runs were needed to cover\nall this region.\n\nAs for the MK II interferometer, it was never used astro-\n\nnomically because of the slow recording rate and the narrow spectral interval at high re solution.\nSuch a goal is much more difficult to attain than a greater increase in\nresolving power would be since, as we have shown, such an increase would\npose no new problems.\n(1)\n\nThe problems encountered are of three types:\n\nThe difficulty--and duration--of the reduction increases with the\nnumber of points to be transformed and is independent of the\nre sol ving powe r .\nThe rate of controlled movement of the interferometer must be\n\n(2)\n\nmuch greater in order to record a given number of data points\nin a given time.\n\nHoweve r, the accuracy of the system must be\n\nthe same; an error of a single step during the scan re sults in a\nsevere distortion of the spectrum.\n(3)\n\nThe wider the spectral interval and the greater the resolving\npower, the more the discrimination of the spectral elements\n(which should,\n\nin theory, be perfect in a Fourier transforma-\n\ntion) become s a practical difficulty.\nIt is useful to introduce a quality factor Q for spectra obtained by\n\nFourier transformation of an interferogram.\n\nThis is simply the ratio of the\n\ntotal energy\n\ncontained in a spectrum to that in the minimum detectable line (absorption\nor emission).\n\nWith the assumption that the true line width is less than or\n\nequal to the instrumental width, the strength of such a line will be essentially\n\n4\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\nequal to B eff\' the RMS value of the random noise in the final spectrum from\nall cause s.\nwhere S\n\nThe quality factor can the refore be written as Q\n\nmean\n\n= MS mean / B e ff\n\nis the mean intensity in the spectrum.\n\nThe only truly fundamental noise of the system is that of the detector.\nHoweve r, a numbe r of othe r source s can exist (variations in source brightness, amplifier gain or ze ro level, instabilities in integrators, digitization\nnoise, etc.) whose relative importance increases as Q becomes larger.\nIf the factor M is a measure of the superiority of a multiplex technique,\n\nthen the factor Q is a measure of the difficulties to be overcome in obtaining\nthis gain.\n\nThe problem which we have attacked here (widening of the spec-\n\ntral interval at high resolution) required just such an increase in Q for the\nsystem.\n\nThe price paid was a greater need for care and a more complex\n\nsystem.\nThe MK III inte rfe rometer, which will be de scribed below, re sulted\nfrom these various requirements.\n\nThe step-by-step motion and internal\n\nmodulation were retained for their proven advantages, while leaving a much\nwider scope than we had in the earlier systems for a choice of step-length\nand modulation amplitude and being totally secure against external vibration.\nThe maximum stepping rate is 50 per second, and 10\n\n6\n\nsamples can be\n\nrecorded, although this last figure is by no means the limit feasible.\n\nAt the\n\nsame time, the computational te chnique s have been developed to transform\nsuch an inte rfe rogram in 22 min on an IBM 360/75.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\n5\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\nINTERFEROMETER AND SERVO SYSTEM\n\nOptics\nThe general layout of the MK III interferometer is similar to that of\n\nthe MK II (Ref. 10, Fig. 2).\n\nThe maximum carriage movement is 1 meter,\n\nwhence\n\nA\n\nmax\n\n= 2m\n\nandolT\n\n=5\n\nX 10\n\n-3\n\ncm\n\n-1\n\nThe diameter of the cat\'s-eyes has been increased from 80 to 160 mm and\nthe useful beam diameter from 20 to 80 mm.\n\nThe single beamsplitter has\n\nbeen replaced by two separate plates labelled S (splitter) and M (mixer),\nthe thickne s se s being identical to within 0.1 IJ.m (Fig. 1).\n\nA common sup-\n\nport and fine flexure adjustments as sure their parallelism.\n\nThe two semi-\n\ntransparent coatings were made simultaneously on both plates, assuring\ntheir identity and making the system perfectly achromatic.\n\nThe plates\n\nthemselves are of Infrasil and the coatings are of silicon, the optical thickness being one-quarter-wave at 1.6 fun; the 4RT product is greater than\n0.75 from 0.8 to 3.5 IJ.m.\n\nOthe r plate s are planned for othe r spectral\n\nregions.\nThe reference line used is the xenon superradiant emission line\nA\n\nr\n\n= 3.50 IJ.m (Section III-A).\n\npolarizer P\n\nThe beam first passes through a linear\n\n(2-mm plate of dichroic calcite [calcium carbonate] cut\n\nparallel to the optic axis (Ref. 13)).\n\nIn the two arms of the inter-\n\nferometer are two quarter-wave plates Q\nto the axis,\n\nthe thickness being e\n\nand Q (quartz cut parallel\nl\n2\n= 136 IJ.m) orientated in such a way\n\nthat the beams are right (D) and left (G) circularly polarized;

A\nsecond potentiometer,\n\ncoupled to the first,\n\nis introduced into the feed-\n\nback loop of a variable-gain amplifier; source intensity fluctuations are\nthereby compensated (on the assumption that they are achromatic,\n\nof\n\ncourse).\nThe recorde r is of the incremental type >1< (400 step s/ second).\n\nWhen\n\n6 characters are recorded, taking dead-time into account, the maximum\nrate is 50 points/ second.\nF.\n\nAdjustments\nThe system of phase modulation is, by its ve ry nature, insensitive to\n\nintensity variations in the reference signal; it requires neither a delicate\nbalance between two different detectors, nor manipulation of precise\n\n>:<Step-by-step recording allows stops of any length to be made during a\nrecording.

This\n2\nl\ncompensation is very delicate; it requires, in effect, a simultaneous 3-parameter adjustment (azimuth of the quarter-wave\n\nplate in its plane, the angle of incidence and the plane of incidence).\n\nIt is pe rformed by occulting one of the beams in the\n\ninterferometer and orientating the quarter-wave plate in the other\nbeam in such a way as to annul the modulated signal received by\neithe r of the detectors H\n\nor H ; the incident vibration on the\ns\nc\nrotating half-wave plate is then nece ssarily circular.\n\n>l\'These qualities, which are essential for a precise measure of A, are a\nprope rty of the mechanical system which produce s the modulation (rotating\nhal\xc2\xa3wave plate D mounted rigidly to the disk VA). Of course, it is possible\nto perform the equivalent operation with electro-optic crystals driven by\nsuitable sinusoidal voltage s. But in orde r to obtain a rigorous relationship\nbetween the phases of the reference signals of frequency 4N and 400N, an\nextreme precision in the waveforms and amplitudes of the applied signals,\nnot to rnention the driving conditions and the crystal temperature control,\nwould be necessary. An alternative measurement system, somewhat like\nours (Ref. 14), in which the carrier is obtained by beats between the Zeeman\ncomponents of a lase r line, has the advantage of not requiring a rotating element. But it no longe r allows the fine, accurate, and rapid inte rpolation\nbetween whole fringes which is the essential property of our arrangement.\n\n24\n\nJPL Technical Mem.orandum. 33-525\n\nThis empirical adjustment is convenient only if it is possible to\nfollow the phase and the amplitude of the modulated signal; therefore, the signal (before squaring) is sent to two synchronous\ndemodulators fed by the reference signals Rand R . Their dc\ns\nc\noutputs are fed to the X and Y inputs of an oscilloscope and one\nattempts to cente r the spot.\n\nThe accuracy of the adjustment is\n\nlimited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the reference signal; an\n4\nellipticity of less than 1,5 x 10- has been obtained, which corre sponds to a periodic error\ndiffe rence.\n\nE\n\nof the orde r of 0.5 nm in the path\n\nSuch an error must introduce ghosts into a spectrum\n\ncalculated by Fourie r transformation>:< for which the spacing from\nthe main line equals\n\n(J\n\nr\n\n= l/X. r\n\nand the intensity is calculated as\n\nThe measured ghost intensity for a visible line (X. =\n3\n632.8 nm)was 5 x 10- ; since it is proportional to l/X. it is much\n2\'ITE\n\nIX..\n\nreduced in the infrared.\n\nThis intensity can appear relatively\n\nlarge; but (because of the use of a phase-sensitive Fourier\nTransform) the re sultant shape of the ghosts is asymetric and\nthey cannot be confused with normal line s.\n(2)\n\nThe adjustment of the incidence angle on the rotating half-wave\nplate D is significantly more delicate.\n\nBut the error in\n\n~\n\nintro-\n\nduced by the error in the optical thickness of D is time-periodic\n(of period liN).\n\nSince the internal modulation period liN\' and\n\nthe integration time is an integral multiple of liN, the average\nresidual effect on each interferogram sample is nil; in other\nwords, only the form of the internal modulation program is\n(ve ry slight!y) changed and is unimportant.\n\n>l<Since the periodic error is stable, one might imagine measuring\ncompensating in orde r to reduce the ghosts even more.

We now have a\n6\n360/75 having 256K words but we need to transform 10 points.\nNow, the fast FT method of Cooley and Tukey is easily applied when\nall the computation can be done in core.\n\nHowever, when the number of\n\npoints exceeds a limit N L\' depending on the computer being used, auxiliary\nstores (tapes or disks) must be used, for which the access time is much\ngreater than that for the core.\n\nIt has been necessary, therefore, to gene-\n\nrate two programs for transforming a number of points which, in one case,\nis less than N\nA.\n\nL\n\nand in the other, is greater.\n\nCalculation of the Fourier Transform\nWe must calculate the sine FT of an odd function sampled by N points\n\nbetween A\n\n=0\n\nand A\n\nmax\n\nLet us put\n\nh\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\n29\n\nwhere h is the distance between sample points (Fig. 13).\nthe N samples of the interferogram I\n\n(.~),\n\nStarting from\n\none calculates N samples of the\n\nspectrum S (0-) separated by 00- by the series\nk=N\n\nS (0-1\n\n+ P 00- )\n\n=\n\nL:\n\nI k _ 1 cos [2 TT ( 0-1\n\n+ P 0 0- )\n\n(k - 1) h)\n\nk=l\n\n1.\n\nClas sical method.\n\nThe das sical algorithm using this formula\n\nleads, for the calculation of the N points in the spectrum, to the product of\na square matrix of rank N by a column matrix of N terms, wherein the\n2\ncalculation time is proportional to N and the coefficient of proportionality\nis dependent on the computer used and the method of generating the cosines.\nThe best times realized follow the formulae\n\nT\n\n=\n\nO. 8 X 10- 3 N2 for an IBM 704\n\nand\n\n-3\nT = O. 3 X ION 2 for a 7040\nwith T being expressed in seconds (Fig. 14 and Table 1).\nIn practice, the largest scale on which this algorithm was used was\nfor the calculation of spectra of Jupiter (1965) with N\n2.\n\nCooley- Tukey method.\n\n=\n\n12,000 in 12 h.\n\nIn its original form, this method permits\n\nthe calculation of the Fourier Transform of any kind of complex function.\nThus, in our notation, N\nto obtain N\n\nD\n\nD\n\n=\n\n2N complex samples are transformed in order\n\ncomplex values of the spectrum spread out in the interval\n\n2~0- = l/h.\n\nThe general idea of the method was expre s sed at the beginning of the\nfundamental paper by Cooley and Tukey (Ref. 24):\n\nlithe square matrix\n\nND X N\n\ncan be considered as the product of m partially-filled matrices,\nD\nm being equal to log 2 N ."\nD\na.\n\nComplex functions.\n\nIn this case, the necessary core size is 2N\n\nD\n\nwords, which implies reserving 4N words for the 2N real samples taken\n\n30\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\nand +~\n\':\' and 2N imaginary, null values. Let H be the\nmax\nmax\nsize of the memory of the computer under consideration; H is always a\n\nbetween -6\n\npower of 2.\n\nSince a portion is nece s sarily taken up by the system monitor\n\nand the program, one can, at most, use H/2 words for storing the data;\ntherefore with a 7040 with a 32K core one can, at most, handle an interferogram of\n\nNL\n\n=\n\nH\n\n=\n\n2 X4\n\nWith a 360/75 with a 256K core, N\n\nL\n\n4K\n\n=\n\n4096 words\n\nbecomes 32K.\n\nOn the other hand, the results of the FT are not in order and the\nelementary sorting by inversion of the bits adds a term in\n\nN~ to the cal-\n\nculation time which is quite negligible for small N\n\nbut becomes dominant\nD\nAn improvement of the sorting method has required the use\n\nfor large N .\nD\nof an extra N words in the core but has suppressed the term in N~.

technique (Ref. 26),\nN\nwhich allows an FT of a real function, sampled at N\n= 2 points, to be\nD\ncalculated on a computer having only Nd12 words of fast-access memory.\nIn the first stage, the

gross conSUll1ers of ll1achine till1e.\nThe se figure s are not optill1ull1.\n\nThe first ill1provell1ent that can be\n\nll1ade is to adapt the FFT algorithll1 to the particular case of a real function\nwhich is partly even and partly odd.\n\nIt is reasonable to expect that this would\n\nresult in less ll1ell1ory being used and the cOll1putation till1e being reduced.\nB.\n\nAuxiliary Calculations\nThe calculation of the Fourier Transforll1 itself is only one stage in the\n\ncOll1plete treatll1ent which the interferograll1 ll1ust undergo between recording\nit on ll1agnetic tape and plotting the final spectrull1.\n\nAs was discussed ear-\n\nlier, the interferograll1 is sall1pled at the ll1inill1ull1 possible nUll1ber of\npoints N.\n\nConsequently, the spectrull1 obtained by the Fourie r Transforll1 is\n\nalso sall1pled at N points, N always being a ll1inill1ull1.\n\nThis signifies that\n\nthere is only 1 point per spectral elell1ent; a linear interpolation gives only a\nrough approxill1ation to the true spectrull1 and a precise interpolation schell1e\n(by convolution) is indispensible (Ref. I).\nThe cOll1putation is pe rforll1ed as follows:\n\nthe 1024K prill1ary spectral\n\npoints S(a) resulting froll1 the FT are stored on disk.\n\nThe search for the\n\nll1axill1ull1 value of Stakes 25 s; the norll1a1ization of all the spectrull1 and\nthe writing of it onto ll1agnetic tape in 1K records take s 86 s; the calculation\nof the requisite interpolation function f(lJ) and various necessary initializations use s anothe r 25 s.\n\nAt this point, the inte rpolation prope r begins; one\n\nll1ay calculate either the entire spectrull1 or an arbitrary portion; the COll1plete calculation, ell1ploying 5 secondary points per prill1ary point, giving\n5 X 1024K= 5 X 10\n\n6\n\npoints, takes 22ll1in, 10 s.\':<\n\nFinally, the writing of the\n\nll1agnetic tape for the Calcoll1p 563 plotter is perforll1ed in 10 ll1in. \':<\n\nThe\n\ntotal till1e for these operations is thus 1 h, 03 ll1in.\n\n\':<New software froll1 the plotte r ll1anufacture r should allow us to reduce this\ntill1e.\n34\n\nJPL Technical Mell1orandull1 33-525\n\nC.\n\nTe st Program\nIt is ve ry use ful to ha ve info rma tion on the quality of the spe ctrum a s soon as\n\npossible after the recording of the interferogram.\n\nFor this it suffices to cal-\n\nculate, at maximum resolution, three narrow regions (8K points wide, for\ninstance) in three different spectral intervals; one in a region of maximum\nsignal, within which are narrow lines, and the two others at the wings of the\nspectrum, where the signal is zero; one has, therefore, a simple means of\ndete rmining the effective noise level and the signal/noise ratio in the spectrum.\n\nThe calculation of the FT is done from a secondary inte rfe rogram\n\nsampled at 8K equidistant points spaced at 1024K/8 intervals generated by a\n6\nsuitable convolution with the 10 primary samples (Ref. 8). Table 2 gives\nthe corresponding calculation time s.\nThus, using a test taking 3 X 96 s\n\n=4\n\nmin 48 s, one has enough infor-\n\nmation about the spectrum to decide whether to perform the complete\ncalculation. \':\'\n\n\':\'One can, equally well, calculate a complete spectrum of 10 24K in 16 slice s\nof 64K if one has access to an "Array Processor," a specialized device for\npe rforming convolutions which works in parallel to the Central P roce ssing\nUnit (CPU).

Verges (Refs. 19, 20, 21, and 22); the accent has been more on high\nresolution for the analysis of hyperfine structure, isotope shifts, and\nZeeman effect rather than precise absolute positions.\n\nThe method goe s in\n\ntwo successive stages:\n(1)\n\nA preliminary scan of the entire spectrum is performed at\n0.2 cm -1 resolution using a first SISAM; the region covered is\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\n41\n\n-1\n4, 000 to 12, 000 em,\n\nThe effective recording time is of the\n\norder of 150 h and the operation takes about 3 weeks.>:<\n(2)\n\nAfter a first look at the spectrum, in the course of which the\ninte re sting line s are noted, an analysis at much highe r re solution (0.03 em-I) is performed in very narrow spectral regions.\nThe effective recording time for\n\n~\n\nstructure is of the order of\n\n10 to 30 min; as a consequence of nece s sary adjustments and\ncalibrations, the numbe r of structure s analyzed doe s not exceed\n10 to 15 per day.\n\nThe study is necessarily limited to the strong-\n\nest lines only (50 in the case of holmium, for example).\n\nFig-\n\nure 20 compares the weakest line satisfactorily recorded with\nthe SISAM to the result obtained by Fourier Transform spectroscopy.\n\nThe intensity of this structure is about 25 time s greater\n\nthan the weakest structure discernible in Fig. 19 (at 8152 em-I).\n\n>:<A similar study at longer wavelengths is performed by C.

An increase in the number of samples to N = 5 X 10 seems\nconceivable without modification of the instrument; spectroscopic problems\njustifying such an expansion are doubtle ss rare.\nA real-time digital computer, specially adapted to the interferometer,\n1S\n\nalso in the process of construction. >:\' It uses the classical algorithm (that\n\nof Cooley and Tukey not being usable in a real-time calculation).\n\nThe basic\n\ncycle -time is 1 fJ.m s/ input point/ output point; thus it is, for this particular\nproblem, 1000 times faster than the 7040 (Table 1, column 2, and Fig. 14,\nthe curve labeled "7040 classique") and about 100 times faster than the\n360/75.\n\nIt can calculate up to 20,000 points in a spectrum starting from an\n\ninterferogram recorded at a rate of 50 points/second, without any limitation\non N.\n\nIn itself sufficient for all problems in which M < 20,000, in other\n\ncase s it allows a portion of the spectrum to be examined in real time.\n\n>:\'Translator\'s Note:\n\n50\n\nThis device was successfully completed early in 1971.\n\nJPL Technical Memorandum 33-525\n\nWe wish to thank M.
