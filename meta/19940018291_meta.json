The major input considered is the traffic assumption which would be offered by the system. A first key step is the choice of the best Rider or Walker constellation geometries - with different numbers of satellites - to insure a good quality of coverage over a selected service area. Another aspect to be addressed is the possible altitude location of the constellation, since it is limited by many constraints. The altitude ranges that seem appropriate considering the spatial environment, the launch and orbit keeping policy and the feasibility of the antenna allowing sufficient frequency reuse are briefly analyzed. To support these first considerations, some 'reference constellations' with similar coverage quality are chosen. The in-orbit capacity needed to support the assumed traffic is computed versus altitude. Finally, the exact number of satellite is determined. It comes as an optimum between a small number of satellites offering a high (and costly) power margin in bad propagation situation and a great number of less powerful satellites granting the same quality of service.", "title": "Optimizing space constellations for mobile satellite systems", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940018291, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Roussel, T."}, "organization": {"name": "France Telecom International", "location": "Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"}}, "id": "bba3dcedea034e569d184d5c622e821d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940018291, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Taisant, J.-P."}, "organization": {"name": "France Telecom International", "location": "Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"}}, "id": "0e8d6b81e50a4437b6969a66d1ba70d4"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940018291, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940018291, "id": "8037f2f42fd54ef69760460f12e558c0", "publicationName": "JPL, Proceedings of the Third International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1993)", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940017957, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "MSATT Workshop on Innovative Instrumentation for the In Situ Study of Atmosphere-Surface Interactions on Mars", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940018291.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940018291/downloads/19940018291.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940018291/downloads/19940018291.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940018291/downloads/19940018291.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
