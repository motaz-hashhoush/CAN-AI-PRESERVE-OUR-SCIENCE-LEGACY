A fast-time simulation study was conducted to assess the benefits of TASAR to Virgin America. The simulation compares historical trajectories without TASAR to trajectories developed with TASAR and evaluated by controllers against their objectives. It was estimated that about 25,000 gallons of fuel and about 2,500 minutes could be saved annually per aircraft. These savings were applied fleet-wide to produce an estimated annual cost savings to Virgin America in excess of $5 million due to fuel, maintenance, and depreciation cost savings. Switching to a more wind-optimal trajectory was found to be the use case that generated the highest benefits out of the three TASAR use cases analyzed. Virgin America TASAR requests peaked at two to four requests per hour per sector in high-altitude Oakland and Salt Lake City center sectors east of San Francisco.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150001251, "id": "68450000a12446c88ea25cf98588b65e", "publicationDate": "2014-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150001251.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150001251/downloads/20150001251.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150001251/downloads/20150001251.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150001251/downloads/20150001251.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
