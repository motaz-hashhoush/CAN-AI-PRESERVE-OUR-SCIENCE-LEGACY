b'Tooling Techniques Enhance Medical Imaging\nNASA Technology\n\nT\n\nhey can release as much energy as tens of billions\nof hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time.\nThey send protons and electrons rocketing at near\nthe speed of light. They heat gas in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere\nto tens of millions of degrees Celsius. They send a blast of\ngas and particles toward Earth, posing a danger to spacecraft and astronauts outside the planet\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere,\nin rare cases even knocking out radio communications and\npower grids on the ground.\nThey are so-called solar eruptive events, made up\nof solar flares and the often associated coronal mass\nejections.\n\nBecause of the scientific mystery of how these solar\neruptions are produced on the Sun with such scale and\nforce, and also the major role they play in space weather\nthat can impact life on Earth, NASA researchers have\ninnovated new methods of gathering information about\nthese violent events.\nOne NASA mission, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy\nSolar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has significantly\nadvanced understanding of solar flares since its launch\nin 2002. RHESSI scientists use the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s imaging\nspectrometer to piece together pictures of solar flares\nfrom the high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray radiation\nthey emit. While there is still much to be learned,\ndata gathered by RHESSI has revealed how magnetic\nfields in the vast expanse of the solar atmosphere may\nbe the force that drives the immense explosions. The\ninstrument has imaged around 50,000 flares to date,\nproviding information that may explain not only the\nworkings of solar flares but also of much more massive\nenergy releases from distant objects like black holes\nand quasars.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been able to make images from X-rays with\nmuch finer resolution and greater sensitivity than have\never been made before,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brian Dennis, RHESSI\nMission Scientist and astrophysicist in the Solar Physics\nLaboratory at Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe key to RHESSI\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented capabilities lie in\na set of essential components a NASA partner created for\nthe mission. The manufacturing techniques developed to\ncreate the components have yielded innovations advancing medical imaging, transportation security, and even\nenergy efficiency.\n\nPartnership\nA solar flare is imaged by RHESSI\nin conjunction with two other NASA\nspacecraft, SOHO and TRACE. For a\ndeeper look at the RHESSI mission,\nscan this code.\n\n54\t\n\nHealth and Medicine\t\n\nTo gather its groundbreaking imagery, RHESSI\xe2\x80\x99s\nspectrometer was outfitted with metal grids incorporated\nin devices called rotation modulation collimators (RMCs).\nAs the spacecraft rotates, the grids block and unblock\nX-rays emanating from the Sun. The instrument\xe2\x80\x99s\n\ndetectors record the modulated radiation passing through\nthe grids and transmit the information to the ground,\nwhere scientists generate images using computers. For\nthis setup to function effectively, NASA needed the most\nfinely crafted grids yet created. A number of attempts to\ncreate the technology failed until engineer Mike Appleby,\nworking at a company called Thermo Electron Tecomet,\nwas able to meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement, producing grids\nusing photoetched tungsten foils built up into precise\nstack laminations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding Mike Appleby was the real secret,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nDennis. \xe2\x80\x9cCollaborating with him allowed us to do this\nmission.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAppleby founded Mikro Systems Inc., based in\nCharlottesville, Virginia, in 2000 to build upon the\nunique lithography-based manufacturing platform he\nused to craft the RHESSI grids. Mikro partnered with\nNASA through the Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) program to improve the company\xe2\x80\x99s platform for\nproducing even finer, more complex grids for future space\nimaging missions.\n\nBenefits\nNow in its 11th year of operation, Mikro Systems has\nfully developed its patented TOMO lithographic molding\ntechnology and, according to Appleby, Mikro\xe2\x80\x99s president\nand CEO, is applying the lessons and techniques the\ncompany derived from its NASA work to manufacturing\nadvanced products for multiple markets.\nThe TOMO process starts with a 3D computer model\nof the part to be created. The model is sliced into thin\nlayers ranging from 25\xe2\x80\x93200 microns in thickness. Using\nphotomasks created from the layers, a chemical machining process is applied to etch each layer in thin metal foils.\nThe layers are then bound together using stack lamination\nand epoxy to create a master pattern. The pattern serves\nas the basis for a mold then used to cast the products.\nWith this process, says Appleby, Mikro can cast ceramics,\nSpinoff 2011\n\nA Mikro Systems Inc. employee holds a layer of a TOMO tool. Mikro\xe2\x80\x99s NASA-derived TOMO process allows for the manufacturing of\nnew medical imaging components, like the 2D antiscatter grid shown on the right.\n\npowdered metals, polymers, and composites with high\nprecision and at low cost.\nOne of the company\xe2\x80\x99s main markets developed\nfrom its NASA collimator work. Just like the RHESSI\ninstrument, X-ray-based medical imaging machines\nrequire collimators, also known as antiscatter grids. These\ngrids, typically made of tungsten or molybdenum, sit\nbetween the X-ray source and the detector. As the X-rays\npass through the body, some are scattered; the grid absorbs\nthe scattered radiation while allowing the unscattered\nX-rays to pass through, ensuring a clean image for doctors\nto study.\nUsing the TOMO process, Mikro now creates unique\ncollimators for computed tomography (CT) machines\nSpinoff 2011 \t\n\nused to image injuries and other conditions in regions\nlike the brain, heart, and lungs. These collimators are\ntwo-dimensional grids\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the standard onedimensional collimator\xe2\x80\x94a device that was not possible\nto create prior to the innovation of the TOMO process,\nAppleby says. The 2D grid provides significant benefits\nincluding improved scatter rejection (and thus better\nimaging) and enhanced strength. These features are key\nto newer CT machines that move the detector-carrying\ngantry around patients at higher speeds and produce\nmore comprehensive imagery. The advanced qualities all\ncome at a reduced cost; the TOMO process uses powdered tungsten instead of tungsten foil to create the grids,\n\nHealth and Medicine \t 55\n\nHealth and\nMedicine\n\nlowering material expenses from between $300\xe2\x80\x93$500 a\npound to around $20 a pound.\nIn addition to the medical imaging applications,\nMikro\xe2\x80\x99s collimators are currently used in a high-resolution scanner for airport security screening, and Mikro is\nalso applying the TOMO process to the production of\nblades for gas turbine engines used for aircraft propulsion\nand energy generation. The hotter a turbine engine runs,\nthe more efficiently it operates, so effective methods for\nmanaging the engine\xe2\x80\x99s heat are essential to boosting efficiency. The TOMO process allows Mikro to cast blades\ncontaining finer and more complex cooling passages than\npreviously achievable. At the same time, TOMO reduces\nthe cost of the tooling process by one third and shortens\nthe time involved from between 30\xe2\x80\x9340 weeks down to\n4\xe2\x80\x936 weeks. Mikro is currently working with major firms\nlike Siemens Energy to advance the technology for energygenerating industrial gas turbines.\nLaunched with three employees, Mikro now has\n40, including 15 recent hires to support the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nmedical imaging efforts. The company\xe2\x80\x99s turbine work is\ngrowing even faster, and all of this success can be traced\nback to Mikro\xe2\x80\x99s NASA collaboration, says Appleby.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are always proud to accomplish something on the\ncutting edge,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the privilege we have in\nworking with NASA and other Government agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDennis says that Mikro\xe2\x80\x99s new etched grids, smaller but\nmore complex than those used for RHESSI, are essential\nfor enabling the Solar Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX)\nto be flown on the Solar Orbiter, a joint NASA/European\nSpace Agency mission that will venture within the orbit of\nthe planet Mercury to obtain a close-up look at the Sun.\nIt seems a NASA partnership will once again play a role in\ndrawing back the veil on the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries. v\t\n\n'
