One of the problems Robonaut developers encountered was that the robot s interface offered an extremely limited field of vision. Johnson robotics engineer, Darby Magruder, explained that the 40-degree field-of-view (FOV) in initial robotic prototypes provided very narrow tunnel vision, which posed difficulties for Robonaut operators trying to see the robot s surroundings. Because of the narrow FOV, NASA decided to reach out to the private sector for assistance. In addition to a wider FOV, NASA also desired higher resolution in a head-mounted display (HMD) with the added ability to capture and display video.", "title": "Virtual Reality System Offers a Wide Perspective", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T20:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090002505, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090002505, "id": "1b62aa7cc23c418fb128aaa94d14b5a3", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2008: 50 Years of NASA-Derived Technologies (1958-2008)", "publicationDate": "2008-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090002505.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090002505/downloads/20090002505.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090002505/downloads/20090002505.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090002505/downloads/20090002505.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
