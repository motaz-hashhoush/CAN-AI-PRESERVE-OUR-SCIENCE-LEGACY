For example, the NRC ASTRO2010 Decadal Survey states that an advanced large-aperture UVOIR telescope is required to enable the next generation of compelling astrophysics and exo-planet science; and that present technology is not mature enough to affordably build and launch any potential UVOIR mission concept. The NRC 2012 NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities report states that the highest priority technology in which NASA should invest to 'Expand our understanding of Earth and the universe' is a new generation of astronomical telescopes. And, each of the Astrophysics division Program Office Annual Technology Reports (PATR), identifies specific technology needs. NASA has a variety of programs to fund enabling technology development: SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research); the ROSES APRA and SAT programs (Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science; Astrophysics Research and Analysis program; Strategic Astrophysics Technology program); and several Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) technology development programs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140005779, "endDate": "2013-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "Bellingham, WA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "abe8260c411d494bac2c885ecb748505", "id": "c27189e4d7d74dcf9fe7f17fef7d93e7"}], "name": "OptiFab Conference", "location": "Rochester, NY", "id": "abe8260c411d494bac2c885ecb748505", "startDate": "2013-10-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140005779, "id": "f7b4e42159124ec793f7938059b2f637", "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140005779.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140005779/downloads/20140005779.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140005779/downloads/20140005779.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140005779/downloads/20140005779.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
