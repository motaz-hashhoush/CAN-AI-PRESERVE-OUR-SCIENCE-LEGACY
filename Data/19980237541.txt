Throughout\nthis report, the term\n"object" is to be interpreted\nin a broad sense to cover any kind of object, including\nliving beings,\nnon-living\nphysical\nthings, events, even ideas and concepts.\nThe idea was to produce\na theory\nthat could serve as the uniting\nfabric of a base technology\ncapable\nof being implemented\nin a\nvariety\nof automated\nsystems.\nThe decision\nwas made to employ\ntwo technologies\nunder\ndevelopment\nby the principal\ninvestigator,\nnamely,\nSMS (Symbolic\nManipulation\nSystem) and\nSL (Symbolic\nLanguage)\n[see deBessonet,\n1991, for detailed\ndescriptions\nof SMS and SL]. The\nplan was to enhance\nand modify these technologies\nfor use in an ICT environment.\nAs a means of giving focus and direction\nto the proposed\nresearch,\nthe investigators\ndecided\nto design an interactive,\nclassificatory\ntool for use in building\naccessible\nknowledge\nbases for\nselected domains.\nAccordingly,\nthe proposed\nresearch was divisible into tasks that included:\n1) the design of technology\nfor classifying\nbases from the results automatically;\n\ndomain\n\n2) the development\nof a scheme\nof inference\nprocessed\nclassificatory\nschemes and knowledge\n3) the design of a query/search\ninclusive\nsystem.\n\nmodule\n\nobjects\n\nand\n\nfor building\n\ncapable\nof drawing\nbases; and\n\nfor accessing\n\nthe knowledge\n\nupon\n\nbases\n\nknowledge\n\npreviously\n\nbuilt\n\nby the\n\nThe interactive\ntool for classifying\ndomain objects was to be designed\ninitially for textual\ncorpora with a view to having the technology\neventually\nbe used in robots to build sentential\nknowledge\nbases that would be supported\nby inference\nengines\nspecially\ndesigned\nfor the\nnatural or man-made\nenvironments\nin which the robots would be called upon to operate.\n3.0 Progress\n\nto Date\n\nThe results achieved\nthus far are very promising.\nAs expected, the technology\nwas found to\nbe crucially\ndependent\non theories\nof inference\nand classification\nthat could be implemented\nover a complex\nof ontologically\ndiverse\nobjects.\nThe investigators\nsuccessfully\ndeveloped\na\nunified approach\nto knowledge\nrepresentation\nand inferencing\nthat is capable of accommodating\na diverse range of objects.\nIn addition,\na plan was established\nfor handling\nsome of the more\ndifficult cases, such as the representation\nof the cognitive\nprocesses\nof an android.\nThe guiding\nprinciple\nis that the deeper the understanding\nof the object to be classified,\nthe better and more\nuseful the classification.\nThe classification\nof a described\ncognitive\nact of remembrance,\nfor\n\nexample, can be contextually\ntreated for classification\npurposes more effectively\nif the system\nhas some defined notion of what it means to remember something.\nOne of the most significant\nresults of the first year of research was the specification\nof a\ngeneral, naively defined, cognitive\nmodel for use in classification\ntechnology\n(see section 6.0,\ninfra). SMS vitally needs more developed\ntheories in these areas to perform sophisticated\ntasks\nof interpretation\nthat would be required\nof a classification\nsystem of the kind envisioned.\nWith respect\nto the development\nof ICT technology,\nwork under the initial year of funding\nwas successful.\nThe proposed design was found to be adequate\nfor the most part but needed\none significant\nmodification\n- the addition of a cognitive\nmodel and accompanying\ncognitive\nfunctions.\nA paradigm of cognition was needed to enable the investigators\nto address problems\nassociated\nwith interpreting\nsentences\nthat describe cognitive\nprocesses\nof human beings and\nother cogitating objects. A diagram of the current ICT design is given below.\n\nU\nClassification Module\n\nI i ooe ,Se c.Modo,e\nI I Ao,oma,odD,c.ooa\n[\n\n[\n\nInference\n\nEngine\n\nCognitive\n\nModel\n\n[\n\n]\n\nIn the main interface, the user selects the module appropriate for the desired task. The classification\nmodule is used to build knowledge\nbases for selected\ndomains,\nwhereas\nthe query/search\nmodule is employed\nto ask questions\nand retrieve information\nfrom whatever\nKBs have been\nbuilt using the classification\nmodule. The automated dictionary is a by-product of the dassification\nprocess and is used for quick look-up and graphical displays\nof relations\nbetween\nconcepts.\nThe classification\nprocess, which is the focus of attention in this proposal, is diagrammed\nbelow\nusing arrows to indicate that the inferencing\nmodule would provide interactive\nsupport during\nthe entire classification\nand interpretation\nprocess.\n\n2\n\nTheinvestigators\nweresuccessful determining:\nin\n1) that ICT technology\ncan be implemented\nincrementally\nincluding\nexamples,\ndefinitions,\nand normative\ndictates\n\nfor various kinds\nsuch as right/duty\n\n2) that\nand\n\nset of quantifiers\n\nuseful\n\nresults\n\ncan be achieved\n\nusing\n\na limited\n\n3) that for best results, the system would require an interpreter\nselected epistemic\noperations\nas well as modal and emotional\n\nof information\nrelationships;\nand\n\noperators;\n\ncapable of "understanding"\nconcepts.\n\nWith respect\nto the accompanying\ngoal of developing\nan appropriate\ntheory\nsupport\nan ICT environment,\nthe investigators\nwere successful\nin determining:\n\nof inference\n\nto\n\n1) that for reasons\nof convenience\nICT technology\nmust accommodate\n\nand efficiency,\nthe representation\nlanguage\nused\nthe encoding\nof multiple perspective\nsimultaneously;\n\n2) that SL notation\n\nto encode\n\ncan be modified\n\nmultiple\n\nperspectives\n\nsimultaneously;\n\nin\n\nand\n\n3) that with some modification\nand the availability\nof a compatible\ncognitive\nmodel, the\nproblem\nof imprecise\nclassification\ncan be effectively\naddressed\nto a useful extent by\nemploying\na defeasible\nscheme\nof inference\nthat employs\nmultiple\nperspectives\n(see\nsection 6.0, infra).\nThe components\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n\nof the model\n\nof the classification\n\nprocess\n\nclassifier;\nobject to be dassified;\nbases of the classification\n(e.g. rules, criteria);\nprocedure\nlabel, identifier,\nor marker for the classification;\nrelation type (e.g. \'isa, \'is, and \'is=).\n\nspecified\n\nfor SMS are:\n\nand\n\nClassification\nin ICT includes the identification\nof objects; in addition, class identifiers\ninclude\nraw data headers, although\nfor expository\nconvenience\nonly lexical labels are discussed\nherein.\nThe classifier envisioned\nis assumed to be a cogitating object, which has important consequences\nfor ICT technology.\nSince SMS is intended to serve as a classifier, and since some of the objects\nto be classified contain descriptions\nof cognitive\nacts that are themselves\nclassificatory\nin nature,\nthe inescapable\nresult is that SMS must have some "understanding"\nof the cognitive\nprocesses in\nwhich the classificatory\nacts occur in order to be able to interpret them.\nIn other words, the\ninterpretive\ntasks require the availability of a paradigm of cognition that includes those processes.\nThe bases of a classification\nthat would be made by a cogitating\nobject of the SMS universe\nwould in theory have to be accessed\ninternally\nby that particular\nobject.\nIt was therefore\nnecessary\nto develop\na model\nof such a cognitive\nevent, one that would\nfit the general\nepistemological\ntheory specified\nfor SMS (see deBessonet,\n1995).\nThe investigators\nmade\nsignificant\n_progress\nin modeling\nselected\ncognitive\nactivities.\nThe belief its that unless an\ninterpreter\nhas access to this kind of information,\nit will be seriously\nhampered\nin its ability to\nperform\nits crucial role in the classification\nprocess. An diagram of a simple, sensory component\nof the model as developed\nthus far is given in section 6.0, infra.\n2.0 Submission\n\nof New\n\nProposal;\n\nGoals\n\nThe investigators\nare submitting\na new proposal\nto NASA requesting\nfunding\nto continue the\nwork performed under the first year of funding.\nThe proposal contains much of the material of\nthis report\nand describes\nthe objectives\nof the proposed\nresearch\naccordingly.\nThe proposed\ngoals are:\n\n3\n\n1)\n\nthe enhancement\nof the representation\nperspectives\nand a wider range of meaning;\n\nlanguage\n\nSL to accommodate\n\nmultiple\n\n2) the development\nof a sufficient\nset of epistemic\noperators\n(cognitive\nfunctions)\nhandle basic cognitive\nacts performed\nby the SMS interpreter,\nincluding\nthe storage\naccessing\nof points of reference;\nand\n3) the development\nencoded.\n3.0 Relevance\nThe goals\nareas related\n\nof Proposed\n\nof a default\n\nscheme\n\nto operate\n\nover\n\nSL notation\n\nas it is\n\nWork for NASA\n\nset for the proposed\nto:\n\n1) knowledge\n2) knowledge\n3) automated\n\ninference\n\nto\nand\n\nresearch\n\nengineering;\nacquisition;\nand\nsystems designed\n\nhave\n\nimportant\n\nfor use in mechanical\n\nrelevance\n\ndevices,\n\nfor NASA\n\nin technological\n\nincluding\n\nrobots.\n\nWith respect\nto knowledge\nengineering,\nthe proposed\nwork would have direct application\nin\naddressing\nproblems\nassociated\nwith handling\nlarge and moderately\nsized data bases.\nThe\ninteractive\ntool, for example,\ncould be used to build conceptual\nretrieval\nsystems\nfor particular\ndata bases.\nWith respect\nto knowledge\nacquisition,\nthe proposed\ntechnology\ncould be used to\nassist in the elicitation\nof information\nfrom domain experts, thereby\npreserving\nit for future use\neven if the experts\nbecome\nunavailable.\nThe interactive\nclassification\ntool could be directly\nemplo} ed in this capacit_\nin cases in which information\nbeen recorded\nby experts in forms in\nwhich particular\nitems of information\nare not conveniently\naccessible.\nWith respect to automated\nsystems\nfor use in mechanical\ndevices,\nthe proposed\nwork would\nhave relevance\nfor devices\ntflat must automatically\nclassif T /identi_\'\nobjects in their domain.\nSince the primaD"\nobjective\nfor the proposed\nwork is to produce\na uniform\nsystem\nof\nrepresentation\nand inference\nspecified\nwithin\na well-defined\ntheoD, of robot epistemolog9_\',\nprogress\nalong these lines would provide\nNASA with versatile\ntechnologies\nthat could continue\nto be developed\nfor a variety of specialized,\nautomated\ntasks.\n4.0 Findings\nAs mentioned\npreviously,\nthe research\nunder the original proposal\nwas directed\ntowards\nthe\ndesign of an interactive\nclassification\ntool (ICT) and the development\nof an appropriate\ntheory"\nof inference\nto support\nICT technology.\nAlthough\ndescribed\nseparately,\nthe work tasks were\ninterrelated\nand were performed\nsimultaneously.\nAn appreciation\nof the progress\nmade and of\nthe goals of the proposed\nresearch\nrequires\nand understanding\nof the mutually\nsupporting\nrelationship\nbetween\nthe two technologies.\nThe interactive\nclassification\ntool was designed\nto\nemploy formalisms\nin an interactive\nmode in which information\nwould be instantiated\ninto the\nformalisms\nas text is processed.\nTo maximize\nthe power of the tool, an expansion\nprocess had\nto be designed\nthat would operate\nrecursively\non instantiated\nformalisms\nto produce\na result\nover which inferencing\ncould be defined.\nPart of the expansion\nprocess is referred to a penumbral\ninferencing,\na process by which nonstandard\ninferences\nare generated\nfrom given information\n(see deBessonet,\n1991, 1995). A brief, formal illustration\nis given below.\nOne can conceive of a syntactical function _ that would be capable of drawing relevant syntactical\nobjects into association with a given object \xe2\x80\xa2 using one or more relations defined for that purpose.\nThus, _(_, \xc2\xae) = { e, } where \xe2\x80\xa2 ranges over sentential and nonsentential linguistic objects, \xc2\xae ranges\nover relations and { ot } is a set of objects, each of which bears the relation O to _. The function\ncan be used to produce penumbral inferences. Given that E)_is a relation and that _ is a sententiat\nobject and that _, = < 13_ J3_ where 13ranges over noun components and ), ranges over links\n)\',\n>,\n(verbs), the function .Qcan be applied to the internal noun components of _ to produce two sets of\nobjects related to one another by the link )\'_. In other words,\n4\n\n(where _ 1 and\ny\n\nz =- 1). Using the information to the right of the equal sign, one can relate each\nelement of the first set to each element of the second set to produce a set of penumbral inferences,\neach inference bearing an assigned value indicative of its degree of presence. The inferences might\ntake the form:\n\n{<<13,_,\n_\',1_2_,\n> A,>\n<<13,_,\n_\',132__>\na>\n<<13,__\n_\',13.__,>\na>\n<<13,__\n_\',132__>\n,_>}\n(where/_ ranges over values indicative of full or penumbral presence in the system). This set of\ninferences would constitute part of the penumbral realm of the system. The effect of employing _ on\na given object _ and a set of relations is that multiple objects become co-present with _ and are\nthemselves cast into penumbral relations with the objects to which _ is related. If _ is the object\n"grape\',for instance, the object "wine\' may be generated into presence in the penumbral realm by\nusing an appropriate relation symbol as an argument to _.\nAs predicted,\nthe querying\npower\nof the system\nwas found to be functionally\ndependent\nupon classificatory\nand interpretive\ncapabilities.\nThe constraining\nprinciple\nis that the retrieval\ncapabilities\nof the system are measured\nby what had been classified\nand incorporated\ninto the\nsystem through\ninterpretation.\nThe cognitive\nmodel was added to the design in an attempt\nto\nincrease\nthe system\'s\ninterpretive\ncapabilities.\nICT technology\nis distinguished\nby its behindthe-scenes\nemployment\nof a sententially\noriented\nrepresentation\nlanguage\nand a specialized\ninterpreter\nthat reads the language\nand builds an optimized\nKB from input.\nICT starts with a\ndomain\nof objects and develops\na KB for it over which an optimized\nsearch can be conducted.\nAs objects are classified,\nthe inferencing\ncomponent\nprompts the human\nclassifier\nfor additional\ninput in an attempt\nto maximize\nthe semantic\ndepth of the classificatory\ndescriptions\nprovided.\nThe prompters,\nwith the help of the inference engine, generate\nappropriate\nsentential\ndescriptions\nand pass them to the interpreter.\nThe representation\nlanguage\nin which the descriptions\nare\nexpressed\nare formally\nstructured\nto enable the interpreter\nto cast descriptive\ncontent into a KB\nspecially\ndesigned\nto accommodate\nanalytical\npaths mapped\nout in query/search.\nSignificant\nprogress\nwas made in the first year towards\naddressing\nthe problem\nof imprecision\nin expression.\nThe plan is to employ\na defeasible\nscheme\nof inference\nthat accommodates\nmultiple\nperspectives.\nThe finding\nwas that to capture\nthe meaning\nof textual\nobjects being\nclassified,\nthe system as currently\ndesigned\nwould be required\nto perform\nsome of its operations\nin the epistemic\nand modal realms.\nThis is not to say that the system would be required\nto have\nfully developed\nepistemic\nand modal logics available to operate, only that these kinds of operations\nmust be given interpretations\nwithin an SMS/ICT\nenvironment.\nThe point can be illustrated\nby\nsimple example\nusing the assertions:\n(1) An eagle is in the tree; and\n(2) John saw an eagle in the tree.\nThe interpretation\nof the first assertion,\nsay represented\nin SL as "<eagle v-l-in tree>" would\ndiffer significantly\nfrom the interpretation\nof "<john saw <eagle v-l-in tree>>," which is an SL\nrepresentation\nof the second assertion.\nThe second assertion\ncontains\nthe perception verb "saw"\nand must be given a special,\nepistemically\noriented\ninterpretation.\nFor an ICT system\nto\n"understand"\nthis assertion\nin depth, it must access a cognitive\nmodel in order to generate\na\nbase of information\nfrom which to respond\nto queries\nand perhaps\ndo a bit of SMS-styled\nepistemic\nreasoning.\nThe investigators\nhave developed\na preliminary\nversion\nof a cognitive\nmodel that traces an act of perception\nfrom the initial sensory\nexperience\nto its interpretation\nand storage in memory.\nThe model is quite elaborate,\nbut, for expository\nconvenience,\nit will be\ngiven only a brief and partial description\nhere. The reader should keep in mind that the SMS\ninterpreter\nwould be attempting\nto build internal\nrepresentations\nof the meaning\nof sentences\n\n5\n\nsuch as assertion\n(2) above.\nThe investigators\nhave defined a number of special operators\n(cognitive\nfunctions in SMS) to give the system this capability, among them noting*, interpreting*,\nassigning*,\naccepting*,\naccessing*,\nactivating*,\napplying*,\nevaluating*,\nabstracting*,\nmarking*,\nassociating*,\nstoring*, comparing*,\nrecognizing*,\nand remembering*.\nThe general scheme\nfor acts of perception\nby sight is for the sensory image to be noted,\ninterpreted,\nmarked or copied, and then stored as a point of reference\nthat is assigned\nan\nuncertain degree of accessibility,\ngiving it a human-oriented\nlimitation.\nA diagram of a simple,\nsensory component\nof the model is given below.\n\nr\nWorld\nCogitator/Perceiver\n\n1@\n\nPerceived\n\nObje_.t\n\nAbstracting/Marking")\n\n[ Ddata Structure\n\nThis represents\nthe idea of a cogitator\nperceiving\nan object of the world, noting\na less than\nperfect image of it in his or her horizon, interpreting\nit, and then entering it into memory as a\npoint-of-reference\ndata structure by means of defined processes\nof abstraction,\nmarking and\nstorage. The configuration\nrepresented\nis drawn from the sensory horizon of the general cognitive\nmodel. These processes, including\nthe construction,\nstorage and accessing of the point-of-reference\ndata structure,\nare specially\ndefined and related to enable them to be represented\nin SL, the\nrepresentation\nlanguage of the system.\nClassification\nas defined in SMS enters the picture at the noting* phase when an object is\nnoted as a "some-thing,"\nto use SL terminology.\nTraditional\nclassification\noccurs when a label is\nassigned\nto the object sensed\nor experienced.\nIn SMS, the entire process is represented\nin\naccessible\nform.\nMuch of the effort in the first year was spent on developing\na theory of\ncognition\nfor ICT technology.\nThe development\nof a theory to cover perception\nand stored\npoints of reference\nposed important\nrepresentation\nissues.\nThe investigators\ndetermined\nthat\nperception statements,\nfor instance, must be interpreted\nfrom multiple perspective,\nincluding:\na) the perspective\nb) the perspective\n\nof SMS; and\nof the perceiver\n\nmentioned\n\nin the SL assertion.\n\nIn addition,\nthe points of reference\nproduced\nduring the process of interpretation\nmust be\nrelated\nto one another\nin a way that will enable the system to handle imprecise expression.\nThe\ninvestigators\ndeveloped\nan approach\nby which the KB of SMS can be treated as points of\nreference\ncreated by the SMS interpreter.\nIn this respect, SMS itself is taken as a cognitive\nmodel (see deBessonet,\n1995). Points of reference\ncreated in conformity\nwith the special cognitive\nmodel defined for individual\nperceivers are represented\nin a special SL vocabulary that employs\ncognitive\noperators\nand terms, including\nthe operators listed previously.\nThus, two general\nperspectives\nbecome appreciable\n- that of SMS and those of individual,\ncogitating objects within\nSMS. Findings of the first year indicate that two perspectives\ncan be kept distinct and that SL\nnotation can be enhanced to handle the simultaneous\nencoding of both perspectives,\nat least to a\nlarge extent.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nReturning\nto the example about John seeing the eagle, !he multiple\nperspective\napproach\nwould enable the codifier to assert that indeed John saw an eagle but would allow the encoder\nto avoid making a direct assertion about how \'john interpreted\nwhat he saw. If the system were\nto be queried about whether \'john saw an \'eagle, for instance, it would be in a position to give an\n6\n\nunqualified, affirmative\n\nresponse,\nbut if asked whether\n\'john believed\nit was an eagle, the\nsystem could generate\nan appropriately\nqualified\nresponse\n(a penumbral\nresponse\nin SMS\nterminology).\nThe findings were that this capability is contingent upon the detailed representation\nof the processes\nthat take place within the cognitive\nmodel specified\nfor individuals,\nincluding\nthe creation,\nstoring\nand accessin_\nof points of reference,\nand upon an elaborate\nsystem\nof\ndefaults especially\ndesigned\nfor the environment\nin which multiple\nperspectives\nwould be\nencoded simultaneously.\nThe system is being designed\nto operate in an object-oriented,\nCLOS-based\nprogramming\nenvironment.\nThis environment\nwas chosen because of the direct compatibility\nbetween\nLisp\nfunctions\nand the cognitive\nfunctions being defined for the system.\nReadily understandable\nexamples\nwould be that EVAL and APPLY of Lisp correspond\nto the applying* and evaluating*\nfunctions of SMS. SMS interprets sentential input and builds a knowledge\nbase (K\'B) from the\nresults. The KB has a carefully specified structure that is optimized for accessibility and efficiency.\nBasically,\nthe components\nof interpreted\nsentences\nare marked\nand cast into a massive\nconfiguration\nof objects related\nto one another through pointer/links,\nall of which may be\nlikened to a detailed concept map.\nDrawing\nupon techniques\ndesigned\nfor SMS concept map interpretation,\nthe system\nfor\nrelating\nconcepts and points of reference can be diagrammed\nto highlight the defeasible\nnature\nof objects and relations that SMS considers to be tainted or uncertain.\nFrom a formal perspective,\nthe general ideas can be abstractly\ndescribed\nas follows.\nLet Q be the set of all quantifiers\nrecognized\nby the system, let C be the set of terms/concepts\n(referred\nto herein as "nodes") used\nas noun-type\ncomponents\nof SL sentences,\nlet R be the set of all relational\nterms used to relate\nnodes, and let V be the set of all values used to describe the presence (cf. truth; see deBessonet,\n1995) of objects and relations. The primary mapping would be defined as follows:\nLet A = {(c, q) I c e C, q e Q} and let B = A x A, the product set of A and A. Each member of B is\nthen paired with a relation simply by letting D = {(b, r) I b e B, r e R}. The primary mapping would\nthen be:\nf O-->\nThe general\nNumbers\n\nscheme\n\ncan be explained\n\nare attached\n\nto the letters\n\nV\n\ndiagrammatically\nto distinguish\n\nusing\n\nvariables\n\nGreek\n\nhaving\n\nover quantifiers,\nF over relations,\nand O over node concepts.\na segment of information\nencoded in SL.\n\nletters\n\nas special\n\nthe same range.\n\nThe configuration\n\nbelow\n\nvariables.\nLet \xc2\xa2 range\nrepresents\n\nQ-I\n\n@-3\n\n0i_5\n\n(where the arrows relate the nodes as described by the relation\narrows and where varying color reflects diversity.)\n\nsymbols\n\nto the right of the\n\nAssuming\nthat quantifiers\nwould have been omitted from the encoded\ninformation,\nthe first\nround of interpretation\nwould add quantifiers\nto the nodes, supplying\nthem on its own using\ndefault rules. The result can be schematically\ndiagrammed\nas follows:\n\n7\n\n(where "v" represents\nthrough 12)\n\ndisjunction\n\nand "?" represents\n\nunspecified\n\nnumbers\n\nranging\n\nover 1\n\nEach node is now accompanied\nby a disjunctive\nset of quantifiers that the system has generated\nas part of its nonstandard\noperations.\nSince the system must produce\nresults from what is not\nexplicitly given in the SL notation, the operations\nare clearly within what is called the penumbral\nrealm in SMS, which means that the conclusions\nreached are by no means valid in the traditional\ntruth-functional\nsense. The conclusions\nare nonetheless\nuseful (see deBessonet,\n1991). For the\nscheme to reflect this, values must be added to indicate that the conclusions\nare tainted in\nprecisely\ndefined ways.\nThis means that every quantifier\nadded in a conclusionary\nmanner\nmust be accompanied\nby a value that represents\nthe nature of its taintedness.\nThe result can be\nschematically\ndiagrammed\nas follows:\n\nvi }\nFr-1\nv...\n\n(where\narrows\n\ng ranges\nconnect\n\nv\n\nover values that indicate\nvarying\nthe values with quantifiers)\n\ntypes\n\nof taintedness\n\nand the upward\n\npointing\n\nAny tainted relation\nor object generated\nis defeasible,\nand reasoning\nover the objects is specified\nwith that in mind (see generally\ndeBessonet,\n1991).\nConclusions\nare qualified\naccordingly,\nincluding\nthose made with the scope of the cognitive\nmodel.\nThe findings\nthus far are that\npoints-of-reference\ndata structures\n(PRDSs) can be understood\nto be configured\nand related\nas\ndiagrammed\nabove for nodes and relations.\nThis is because\nthe cognitive\nmodel is being\nrepresented\ndirectly in SL, which means that SL assertions\nabout the creation and storage of\npoints of reference\nare also encoded\nand processed\nlike other SL statements.\nThe proposed\nresearch would investigate\nthe possibility of marking entire configurations\nof PRDSs and treating\n\n8\n\nthem as connecting\nmechanisms\nthat are accessible at multiple points from multiple perspectives.\nThe idea is to be able to handle concepts like "calling to mind" an event based on the thought of\nsomething\nsimilar to some aspect of the recalled event.\n5.0 Relation\n\nto Present\n\nState of Knowledge\n\nand to Work in Progress\n\nElsewhere\n\nThe work would significantly\nadvance current interactive\nclassification\ntechnologies.\nPerhaps\nthe most demanding\nfield in this area is the field of knowledge\nacquisition\n(KA). A fairly recent\ntheoretical\nadvance\nin KA proposed\nthat an explicit model of human cognitive\nprocesses\nbe\nused to guide the development\nof knowledge\nacquisition\ntools [Ford and Adams-Webber,\n1991].\n[Note: The proposed\nwork would employ a cognitive\nmodel, but a naively constructed\none\nspecially tailored for determined\ntasks.]\nDespite advances\nin KA technology,\na pressing need\npersists\nfor an intermediate\nsystem into which information\nelicited from an expert could be\nmapped. The specific need is for a system that can communicate\nwith the elicitation technology\nand perform inferencing\noperations\non the information\nit receives,\nand then feed back the\nresults\nto enable the elicitation\ncomponent\nto react appropriately\nin its interaction\nwith the\ndomain expert. ICT technology\nis being designed with these specifications\nin mind.\nAs to knowledge\nrepresentation\nand inferencing,\nthere are perhaps\nas many systems\nof\nknowledge\nrepresentation\n(KR) as there are KR researchers.\nSystems that use some derivative\nform of first-order\nlogic notation or employ some scheme of inference based on the first-order\npredicate\ncalculus have produced\npowerful\nresults\nin limited domains\nin which modal and\nepistemic\nrepresentation\nand reasoning\nis not required\n(see e.g. Genesereth\nand Nilsson,\n1987;\nMcDermott,\n1987; and Wos et al, 1984). Although\nsome progress has been made in the area of\nrepresentation\nand reasoning\ninvolving\nincomplete\ndomains, approximations,\nand fuzzy concepts\n(see generally\nYager et al, 1987), there is still no adequate\nscheme to represent\nand reason about\nepistemic\nand modal concepts,\nand the problem\nof incomplete\nknowledge\n(see e.g. Levesque,\n1984) continues\nto be quite formidable.\nQuestions\npersist about the suitability\nof using fuzzy set\ntheory and probabilistic\ntheory on a broad scale to ground\nsystems because of the unavailability\nof finely, graded\ndistributions,\nwhether\nof probability\nor possibility,\nin many situations.\nS_MS\ntheory is being designed\nto address\nthese issues on a broad scale by way of a unified approach\nto representation\nand inferencing,\nand ICT technology,\nis being developed\naccordingly,.\nThe proposed\nwork is intended\nto complement\na number of existing systems and technologies.\nThe capabilities\nof standard\nlogic as a knowledge\nrepresentation\nand inferencing\ntool are well\nknown\nand have widespread\napplication\nin AI and related\nfields (see e.g. Genesereth\nand\nNilsson,\n1987). Systems\nbased on fuzzy set theory have gained popularity\nis some circles in\nrecent years and have been used effectively\nto address\ncertain\nproblems\nof uncertainty\nor\nimprecision\n(see e.g. Zadeh, 1986; Yager et al, 1987). Probabi|ity\ntheory is, of course, also quite\nuseful in this area (e.g. see generally\nPearl, 1988; Rodder\nand Kern-Isberner,\n1997). Schmlkian\nconceptual\ndependent,\n(Schank,1975)\ncontinues\nto have its adherents\nand has been employed\nin a number\nof systems over the years. Like SL and SMS, conceptual\ngraph notation,\nwhich was\ndeveloped\nto bridge the gap between\nsystems based on formal logic and systems that employ\nmore informal\nmethods\n(see e.g. Sowa, 1984), is still being employed\nin some applications\n(e.g.\nDick, 1992). The importance\nof ontological\nconsiderations\nhas also attracted\nsome attention\nover\nthe years (e.g. Hobbs, 1985), and recently, special attention\nhas been given to ontological\nrealms\n(e.g. Hirst, 1991). SMS theory supports\nthe view that considerations\npertaining\nto realms and\ntheir ontological\nstatus should not be ignored\nin system design. Schemes of nonmonotonic\nand\ndefault reasoning\nhave been developed\nover the last couple of decades\nto deal with imprecision\nin the form of incomplete\nknowledge\n(e.g. McCarthy,\n1980, 1986; McDermott\nand Doyle, 1980;\nReiter, 1987), and researchers\ncontinue\nto strive to come up with adequate\nformal theories\nto\ndeal with epistemic\nreasoning\n(Hintikka,\n1962; Moore,\n1985). Recently,\nan attempt\nhas been\nmade to specify a formal framework\nfor reasoning\nabout knowledge,\nparticularly\nabout knowledge\nrequirements\nof tasks such as those performed\nin robotics\n(Brafman,\net al, 1998). Statistical\nclassifiers\nare being developed\nto use knowledge-based\ntechniques,\nincluding\ntopical context\nand local clues, to identify\nword senses (Leacock et al, 1998). Each of these approaches\nhas its\nusefulness.\nSMS theol,, borrows\nfeatures\nfrom these approaches\nand combines\nthem, along\nwith some new features, into a unified approach\ndesigned\nfor effective use in an ICT environment.\nHopefully,\nsignificant\nprogress\nwill be made bv others in classi_4ng\nword senses of machinereadable\ndictionaries\n(e.g. Chen and Chang,\n1"998) to enable\nthe investigators\nto employ\nthe\n\nresults\n\nin an ICT environment.\n\nAllowed\nspace does not permit a discussion\nof the details\nabout how SMS theory\nrelates\nto each of the disciplines\nmentioned\nabove,\nbut a general\nstatement\ncan be made\nthat describes\nthe essence\nof the relationship\nbetween\nSMS and these\nother systems.\nBasically,\nSMS theory\nhas\nits own way of approaching\nproblems\nin the areas mentioned,\nbut it draws\nupon these\nother\ndisciplines.\nIt extends\nand takes advantage\nof vivid\ndatabase\ntheory,\nfor instance,\nby taking\na\ndifferent\nepistemological\nview of the world\nthat allows\nmultiple\nlevels\nof varying\nvividness\nto\nbe recognized\nin the system\n(see deBessonet,\n1995). SMS theory\nleaves\nthe door open\nfor other\nsystems\nto be properly\nadjusted\nor adapted\nfor use in an SMS environment.\nIt recognizes,\nfor\nexample,\nthe power\nof truth-functional\nlogic systems,\nsuch as the predicate\ncalculus,\nand SMS is\nbeing\nspecially\ndesigned\nso that a truth preserving\ncapability\ncan be demonstrated\nfor it even\nthough\nit is not specified\nas a truth-functional\nsystem\n(see deBessonet,\n1991, Chapter\n6). An\nelaborate\nproof process\nis being designed\nfor the system\nto take advantage\nof certain\nfeatures\nof\nthe resolution\nprinciple\n(Robinson,\n1965) that is so often used in first-order\nlogic systems.\nThe\nsystem\ncan also be made to use probability\ndistributions\nand finely graded\nfuzzy distributions\nif\nthat kind of information\nis to be made\navailable\nto the system\n(see deBessonet,\n1991, section\n4.10).\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBrafman, R.
