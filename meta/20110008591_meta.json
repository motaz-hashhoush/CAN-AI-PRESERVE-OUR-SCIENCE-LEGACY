Among many radiation-induced lesions, DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are considered the key precursors of most early and late effects [1] leading to direct mutation or aberrant signal transduction processes. In response to damage, a flow of information is communicated to cells not directly hit by the radiation through signal transduction pathways [2]. Non-targeted effects (NTE), which includes bystander effects and genomic instability in the progeny of irradiated cells and tissues, may be particularly important for space radiation risk assessment [1], because astronauts are exposed to a low fluence of heavy ions and only a small fraction of cells are traversed by an ion. NTE may also have important consequences clinical radiotherapy [3]. In the recent years, new simulation tools and modeling approaches have become available to study the tissue response to radiation. The simulation of signal transduction pathways require many elements such as detailed track structure calculations, a tissue or cell culture model, knowledge of biochemical pathways and Brownian Dynamics (BD) propagators of the signaling molecules in their micro-environment. Recently, the Monte-Carlo simulation code of radiation track structure RITRACKS was used for micro and nano-dosimetry calculations [4]. RITRACKS will be used to calculate the fraction of cells traversed by an ion and delta-rays and the energy deposited in cells in a tissue model. RITRACKS also simulates the formation of chemical species by the radiolysis of water [5], notably the .OH radical. This molecule is implicated in DNA damage and in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF), a signaling molecule involved in NTE. BD algorithms for a particle near a membrane comprising receptors were also developed and will be used to simulate trajectories of signaling molecules in the micro-environment and characterize autocrine and paracrine cell communication and signal transduction.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Poland", "submissionId": 20110008591, "endDate": "2011-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Radiation Research Society", "location": "Lawrence, KS, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b7ab22b1c05f43a49053c2c975949244", "id": "519b3bbfb3f2466bab8e93a6988348de"}], "name": "57th Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society", "location": "Warsaw", "id": "b7ab22b1c05f43a49053c2c975949244", "startDate": "2011-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "Poland", "submissionId": 20110008591, "endDate": "2011-09-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Radiation Research Society", "location": "Lawrence, KS, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f16087677aca4777909d9cedebd55ed8", "id": "bebd1fcd73144228bb8bfc3624381342"}], "name": "14th International Congress of Radiation Research", "location": "Warsaw", "id": "f16087677aca4777909d9cedebd55ed8", "startDate": "2011-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008591, "id": "b18beacc034f4c41b5d1d00740407664", "publicationDate": "2011-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008591.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008591/downloads/20110008591.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008591/downloads/20110008591.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008591/downloads/20110008591.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
