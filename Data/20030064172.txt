Altair is the first\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to feature triple-redundant\nflight systems and avionics for increased reliability.\nThe slender-wing aircraft lifted off the runway at the\nGeneral Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI) flight test\nfacility at El Mirage, Calif. The purpose of the historic first\nflight was to evaluate the UAV\xe2\x80\x99s basic airworthiness and flight\ncontrols. After the successful test flight, Altair glided to a\nlanding on the remote desert runway. The entire flight was\nconducted at low altitude within a relatively short range of the\nEl Mirage flight test facility.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Glenn\nHamilton, Altair Project Manager at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Dryden Flight\nResearch Center (DFRC), Edwards, Calif. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can move\nforward with getting UAVs into the national airspace and\nconducting research,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nBuilt to performance specifications established by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEarth Science Enterprise, Altair is an extended-wing version of\nthe MQ-9 Predator B military UAV being developed under a\npartnership with GA-ASI. Altair is one of several UAVs\ndesigned for civil applications that have been developed or\nmatured under the Environmental Research Aircraft and\nSensor Technology (ERAST) program at DFRC.\nAfter initial airworthiness test flights, Altair will serve as\nthe avionics test aircraft for the production version of the MQ-9\nbefore being transferred to NASA. At DFRC, Altair will first\nbe used to evaluate various new control communications and\ncollision-avoidance technologies that are critical to enabling\nUAVs to fly safely in national airspace.\n\nNASA Virion\n\nEventually NASA will use Altair for a variety of environmental\nscience missions, such as volcanic observation, forest fire\nmonitoring and atmospheric sampling. The UAV may be ideal\nfor missions that are often too dangerous, difficult or lengthy\nfor manned aircraft. UAVs are uniquely positioned to perform\nlong missions that have repetitive routines.\nAltair is expected to be the first UAV to meet Federal\nAviation Administration requirements to operate from conventional airports, with piloted aircraft, in the national airspace.\nIn addition to triple-redundant avionics, Altair is configured\nwith a fault-tolerant, dual-architecture flight control system.\nThe UAV will be equipped with an automated collision-avoidance\nsystem and an air traffic control voice relay. The relay allows\nair-traffic controllers to talk to ground-based Altair pilots\nthrough the aircraft.\nCommand and control of the Altair, as well as research data\ngathered by the UAV, will be transmitted through an \xe2\x80\x9cover\nthe horizon\xe2\x80\x9d satellite link. The link will also allow scientists to\nreceive research information as soon as Altair obtains it.\nAltair has been designed to fly continuously for up to 32\nhours. It can reach an altitude of approximately 52,000 feet\nand has a maximum range of about 4,200 miles. Altair can\ncarry up to 750 pounds of sensors, radar, communications and\nimaging equipment in its forward fuselage. The Altair is 34\nfeet long, with a wingspan of 86 feet, 22 feet longer than\nPredator B.\nPhotos are available at:\nhttp:llwww.dfrc.nasa.~ov/~llery/Photo/Altair-PredatorB/index.\nhtrnl\n\nSummer Interns Join he NASATeam\nf\n\n(I to rl Brundi Huwkins, Jeressu Scoff,\nJerryme Mitchell, Sophio Qiun,\nKutrinu Thompson, louren Kulustein,\n\nJunu Juylos Errol Allen, loseph Adkins,\n\n1\n\nChurles Brooks, Murcus Bourn, und\nLurri Whitseff.
