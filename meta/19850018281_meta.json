These experiments are to be conducted on space shuttle flights. How weightlessness affects two body systems of primates are the prime concern. Thermoregulation and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis are the two systems concerned. The thermoregulation project will provide data on how body temperature and circadian rhythms are affected in a weightlessness environment and the homeostasis in fluids and electrolyte levels will address the problem of body fluid shifts.", "title": "Primate Experiments on SLS-1", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T15:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850018281, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aochi, J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "a58b13cb72c749c3bfb50c5556bf7ecb"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850018281, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850018281, "id": "128dcb33f5ce4feca5d118a4d9cbe196", "publicationName": "NASA Ames Summer High School Apprenticeship Res.
