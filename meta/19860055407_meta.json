Tropospheric methane concentrations in remote locations averaged a yearly world-wide increase of 0.018 + or - 0.002 parts per million by volume (ppmv). Average world-wide tropospheric concentration of methane in dry air was 1.625 ppmv at the end of 1983 measured against an NBS standard certified as 0.97 ppmv. Contributing to this steady increase in methane concentration are increases in the source strengths from cattle and rice fields, which in turn result from CO, CH4 and HO coupling. Among the physical and chemical effects is an increase in greenhouse warming of about 0.04 C per decade.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "4", "submissionId": 19860055407, "issn": "0167-7764", "id": "04624511827347cfa811117e2441a9f5", "publicationName": "Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry", "publicationDate": "1986-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
