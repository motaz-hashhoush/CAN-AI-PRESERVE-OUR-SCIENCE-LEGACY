Anderson\nOhio Aerospace Institute\nBrook Park, Ohio 44142\nScaling methods have been shown previously to work well for super cooled large droplet (SLD) main ice shapes.\nHowever, feather sizes for some conditions have not been well represented by scale tests. To determine if there are\nfundamental differences between the development of feathers for appendix C and SLD conditions, this study used\ntime-sequenced photographs, viewing along the span of the model during icing sprays. An airspeed of 100 kt, cloud\nwater drop MVDs of 30 and 140 \xce\xbcm, and stagnation freezing fractions of 0.30 and 0.50 were tested in the NASA\nGlenn Icing Research Tunnel using an unswept 91-cm-chord NACA0012 airfoil model mounted at 0\xc2\xb0 AOA. The\nphotos indicated that the feathers that developed in a distinct region downstream of the leading-edge ice determined\nthe horn location and angle. The angle at which feathers grew from the surface were also measured; results are\nshown for an airspeed of 150 kt, an MVD of 30 \xce\xbcm, and stagnation freezing fractions of 0.30 to 0.60. Feather angles\nwere found to depend strongly on the stagnation freezing fraction, and were independent of either chordwise\nposition on the model or time into the spray. Feather angles also correlated well with horn angles. For these tests,\nthere did not appear to be fundamental differences between the physics of SLD and appendix C icing; therefore, for\nthese conditions similarity parameters used for appendix C scaling appear to be valid for SLD scaling as well.\nFurther investigation into the cause for the large feather structures observed for some SLD conditions will continue.\n\nNomenclature\nAc\nb\nc\ncp\ncp,ws\nd\nhc\nhG\nK\nK0\nLWC\nMVD\nn\nn0\np\npw\npww\nr\nRe\nRe\xce\xb4\ns\ntf\nts\nt\nT\nV\nWeL\n\n\xce\xb1\n\nAccumulation parameter (Eq.

Introduction\nScaling methods for SLD conditions have been under development for several years at NASA Glenn (refs. 1\nand 2). These studies established that good simulations of SLD main ice shapes can be achieved at appendix C conditions using existing scaling methods. These methods match scale and reference values of the parameters n0 and\nWeL, the product \xce\xb20Ac and maintain \xce\xb20 within about 10 percent. Figure 1 gives some typical examples of such scaling. Figure 1(a) shows a good simulation of both main ice shape and feather region for a reference velocity of 100 kt\nwith model size scaled from 91 to 27 cm and MVD from 195 to 30 \xce\xbcm. The important similarity parameters were\nmatched within about 10 percent, although the difference in the scale and reference WeL was somewhat larger; apparently, these matches were adequate. In figure 1(b), a reference velocity of 150 kt was used with size scaled again\nfrom 91 to 27 cm and MVD from 195 to 30 \xce\xbcm. The main ice shapes matched fairly well, but the scale (appendix C)\nfeathers failed to simulate the large formations recorded in the SLD test. In each of the examples in figure 1 the \xce\xb20\nfor scale and reference differ by only about 4 to 6 percent.\nDue to the failure of scaling methods to produce adequate simulations of feather regions in some situations, a\nstudy of feather growth has been undertaken (ref. 3). An understanding of the physical phenomena behind feather\ndevelopment and the identification of possible new similarity parameters is important to the improvement of scaling\nmethods for SLD as well as appendix C conditions for at least three reasons. First, the large feather formations observed in some prior SLD studies need to be simulated accurately in scale tests at appendix C conditions. Second,\neven if feather characteristics for more normal-sized feather growth were not of particular interest in scaling, ice\nshape tracings indicate that feather and horn angle may be related. Thus, the same phenomena that determine feather\nangle may also regulate horn angle. Third, the same phenomena and similarity parameters governing straight-wing\nfeather growth probably also control swept-wing ice scallop formation.\nA first step in identifying any new similarity parameters for inclusion in scaling methods is to understand what\ndifferences there might be between SLD and appendix C feathers. In reference 3 the feather region was studied\nthrough close-up photographs to identify characteristics of feather appearance that might help to determine if there\nare differences between appendix C and SLD regimes. The authors were unable to determine any differences in the\nstructural appearance of feathers formed at the same freezing fraction under the two regimes. Some differences in\nSLD and appendix C feather angles were reported at a speed of 200 kt, but additional data are needed to confirm\nthese results and to cover a wider range of conditions.\nThis paper presents the latest results in the examination of feather formation. Icing tests were performed at a\nvelocity of 100 kt during which a sequence of still pictures were taken from an overhead camera every 10 sec to\nrecord both leading-edge and feather ice development. Drop MVDs were 30 and 140 \xce\xbcm and the stagnation freezing\nfractions were 0.30 and 0.50 for these studies. Feather-angle measurements will also be shown for a velocity of 150\nkt, an MVD of 30 \xce\xbcm and stagnation freezing fractions from 0.30 to 0.60. All tests were performed in the NASA\nGlenn IRT using a full-span, 91-cm-chord NACA 0012 straight-wing airfoil model mounted at 0\xc2\xb0 AOA.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n2\n\n0.08\n\ny/c\n\n0.04\n0.00\n-0.04\n-0.08\n-0.04\n\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n-0.04\n\n0.16\n\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\nx/c\n\nx/c\nc = 91 cm; MVD = 195 m (11-05-04/03)\nc = 27 cm; MVD = 30 m (08-28-04/03)\n\nc = 91 cm; MVD = 195 m (11-03-04/07)\nc = 27 cm; MVD = 35 m (02-15-02/08)\n\n(b) VR, 150 kt.\n\n(a) VR, 100 kt.\n\n(a) 11-05-04/03\n08-24-04/03\n\nc,\ncm\n91.4\n26.7\n\ntst,\n\xc2\xb0C\n-18\n-9\n\n(b) 11-03-04/07\n02-15-02/08\n\n91.4\n26.7\n\n-17\n-15\n\nMVD, LWC,\n\xcf\x84,\ng/m3 min\n\xce\xbcm\n195 1.46 11.0\n30 0.50\n4.6\n\nV,\nkt\n100\n200\n149\n276\n\nDate/Run\n\n0.08\n\n195\n35\n\n1.00\n0.64\n\n10.7\n2.7\n\n\xce\xb20,\n\n0.49\n0.53\n\nRe,\n104\n12.1\n6.4\n\nWeL,\n106\n1.18\n1.37\n\n0.50\n0.50\n\n17.7\n8.5\n\n2.61\n2.61\n\n%\n96.2\n90.1\n\nAc\n\n\xce\xb20Ac\n\nn0\n\n1.87\n1.84\n\n1.80\n1.66\n\n96.8\n93.0\n\n1.86\n1.89\n\n1.80\n1.76\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Examples of scaling from SLD to appendix C conditions (ref. 3).

Facility, Model and Procedures\nThe icing tests were performed in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). The IRT is a closed-loop,\nrefrigerated, sea-level tunnel with a 1.8 by 2.7 m rectangular test section. The icing cloud is generated by operating\n10 spray bars, a configuration in use since 1998.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n4\n\nThe IRT cloud calibrations for both appendix C and SLD conditions used for these tests was performed in the\nsummer of 2004. The LWC and MVD measurements were made using methods reported previously (ref. 12). However, drop-sizing instruments have been updated from past calibration work. Thus, the definition of MVD for a particular cloud may differ from interpretations previously reported, particularly for the SLD regime. For example, for\ngiven spray-bar pressures, the latest calibration gives MVDs of 85 to 95 percent of those obtained in a 2002 calibration. The MVDs reported in this paper are based on an analysis of the MVD calibration data completed in\nNovember, 2004.\nThe model was a 91.4-cm-chord fiberglass NACA 0012 airfoil mounted vertically on the tunnel turntable at 0\xc2\xb0\nangle of attack and 0\xc2\xb0 sweep. It is shown in figure 2 installed in the IRT test section. It extended from floor to ceiling (183-cm span). Horizontal lines at the leading edge were drawn at the tunnel vertical center (model mid span)\nand \xc2\xb12.5 cm from the center to locate ice-tracing templates. Vertical lines were also placed at increments of 2.5 cm\n(labeled in inches on the model), measured along the surface from the stagnation line. These marks helped to identify sites on the model for close-up photographs of feather structure details. Because of the quick-start capability of\nthe IRT spray system, no shielding of the models was required during the initiation of the spray.\nA digital camera was mounted on the third floor of the IRT to view the model from above (i.e., along the span)\nthrough transparent windows on the ceiling of the test section. Portions of both the horn and feather region of the\nlower surface were in the camera view. The shutter and an independent flash were remotely operated with an automatic signal to take a sequence of still images every 10 sec throughout the spray. Spray durations were 14 to 28 min\nfor these tests. The stills were later assembled into movies of the ice-accretion development.\nIn preparing for a test, the temperature and airspeed in the test section and the air and water pressures on the\nspray manifolds were set. When these conditions had stabilized, the spray nozzle valves were opened to initiate the\nspray. The spray was timed for the required duration, then turned off. The fan was brought to a full stop and the researchers entered the test section to document the ice shape with hand tracings. Close-up photographs were also\ntaken with a hand-held digital camera.\nTo record the ice shapes, a thin slice was first melted\nthrough the ice normal to the model surface. A cardboard\ntemplate was then placed into this slit and an outline of the\nice shape traced by pencil, giving a two-dimensional cross\nsection of the ice. Tracings were taken at the vertical center\nof the tunnel (91 cm from the floor) and at 2.5 cm above the\ncenter. The ice shapes so recorded were digitized using an\nautomated line-following feature in SigmaScan Pro (ref. 13)\nsoftware. Only tracings taken at the model midspan (tunnel\nvertical center) will be presented.\nAfter the ice tracings were obtained, the tracing template\nwas removed and a thin plate on which was printed an orthogonal grid was placed in the mid-span slit. Photographs\nof feathers in several chord-wise locations on both sides of\nthe model were taken with the hand-held camera looking\nspanwise along the airfoil surface with the grid in the background. The camera lens was placed as close to the model as\npossible to avoid distortion of the grid, although some distortion was inevitable. For each test three to five pictures\nwere taken altogether, including photos of both the lower\nsurface and upper surface feather regions. From these images, the feather angle was determined.\nThe results presented are from IRT test entries in\nFebruary 2005.\nB. Uncertainty Analysis\nEstimates of the uncertainty in the reported average conditions were made by considering inherent errors of instruments, temporal fluctuation and spatial variation of the\n02-11-05 40561\ninstrument readings in the test section, and uncertainty in\ntunnel calibration of MVD and LWC. Recorded air tempera- Figure 2.\xe2\x80\x9491.4-cm-chord, 183-cm-span fiberglass\nture was believed to be accurate to \xc2\xb10.5\xc2\xb0C, and the NACA 0012 airfoil models installed in IRT test\nuncertainty in air velocity was estimated to be \xc2\xb11m/s. For section.\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n5\n\nappendix C conditions the net uncertainty in MVD was estimated at \xc2\xb112 percent. For SLD conditions it may have\nbeen as much as \xc2\xb120 percent. These uncertainties are not referenced to an absolute value of MVD, which is unknown. Repeatability and scatter in the LWC calibration data suggests the uncertainty is about \xc2\xb112 percent for both\nappendix C and SLD conditions.\nThe test-parameter uncertainties were used to estimate the following uncertainties in the similarity parameters\nfor the appendix C tests: 9 percent in \xce\xb20, 12 percent in Ac, 13 percent in n0, 3 percent in Re, and 5 percent in WeL. For\nthe SLD tests the uncertainties were: 3 percent in \xce\xb20, 12 percent in Ac, 11 percent in n0, 3 percent in Re, and\n5 percent in WeL.\nFeather-angle uncertainties were due primarily to subjective determination of the direction of growth of a\nfeather. For very small feathers (e.g., early in a test or near the icing limit) the uncertainty may be as much as 10\xc2\xb0,\nand for large feathers, only 5\xc2\xb0. At the lowest stagnation freezing fraction tested (n0 = 0.30) glaze feathers were often\nnot as well defined as those for higher freezing fractions, leading to further uncertainty of perhaps 5\xc2\xb0 to 10\xc2\xb0. Independent analysis of a limited number of images by two researchers led to differences in average feather angle of 2\xc2\xb0\nto 4\xc2\xb0. It is estimated that additional errors of 5\xc2\xb0 to 10\xc2\xb0 could result from distortions of the grid used to calibrate the\ndistances in an image.\n\nIV.\n\nResults\n\nA. Feather and Ice-Shape Development\nPhotographs were taken every 10 sec with the overhead camera looking down along the span of the model. The\nview of this camera is shown in figure 3. The interpretations of ice development presented here are based on these\nphotographs. Only glaze accretions will be discussed.\nFeathers typically developed from a narrow base at the surface of the model, growing wider in the spanwise\ndirection with time. Thus, the resulting structure typically had a trapezoidal profile when viewed in the airflow\ndirection, but had a relatively uniform thickness in the chordwise direction. The height of the individual feathers and\nthe number of feathers diminished with distance from the leading edge, following the collection-efficiency decrease.\nMost feathers, particularly farther aft on the model, were very fragile, and sometimes little more than a touch was\nsufficient to break them loose. Feather shedding from time to time occurred during the ice accretion process, but\nonly a relatively small number were lost from the final accretion for the conditions of these tests. Nearer the leading\nedge, feathers were at such a density that they grew together to form large structures. The main-shape horns were\ntypically incorporated into these growths and indistinguishable from them.\nThe non-reflective surface of the fiberglass model is apparent from the image of figure 3. This photo was taken\nat the beginning of a test just before the spray actually wetted the model. A sampling of the sequence of photos that\nfollowed that of figure 3 is shown in figure 4. The conditions for the test of figure 4 included a velocity of 100 kt, an\nMVD of 140 \xce\xbcm and a stagnation freezing fraction of 0.30. Complete details of test conditions for figures 4 to 9 are\ngive in table I.\nThe first frame in figure 4 was taken just 3 sec after that of figure 3. By this time, the model was wet from the\nspray, as evidenced by the red reflection from the tunnel floor that appeared in the leading-edge surface. Approximately 30 sec later (2nd frame), discrete feathers were visible about 2.5 to 5 in. aft of the stagnation. Thus, almost\nimmediately, two separate areas of accretion became apparent: a leading-edge region in which the surface was covered with a film of water or ice, and a feather region characterized by discrete spikes of ice seeming to grow directly\nfrom the clean airfoil surface.\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Clean model before onset of spray.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n6\n\nSpray hits model.\n\n30 sec\n\n105 sec\n\n460 sec\n\n920 sec\n\nCenterline ice profile at end of spray.\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Ice accretion development for 140-\xce\xbcm MVD and n0 = 0.30. 02-11-05 Run 2. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt; \xce\xb20,\n94 percent; \xce\xb20Ac, 1.80.\nSeveral studies (refs. 14, 15, and 16) using high-magnification photography over the last 20 years have led to a\ndetailed description of the leading-edge region that was not examined in the present work. From these previous investigations, we know that for short accretion times, the leading-edge region can be subdivided into smooth and\nrough zones. The smooth zone extends aft from the stagnation line on both the lower and upper surfaces of the\nmodel, followed by transition to a rough zone. The rough zone is characterized by a distribution of small, hemispherical roughness elements over the surface (ref. 16). As accretion progresses the smooth-rough boundary moves\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n7\n\nTABLE I.\xe2\x80\x94TEST CONDITIONS FOR FIGURES 4 TO 9\nFigure\n\nDate/Run\n\n4, 5\n6, 7\n8, 9\n\n02-11-05/02\n02-11-05/05\n02-11-05/03\n\nc,\ncm\n91.4\n91.4\n91.4\n\ntst,\n\xc2\xb0C\n-9\n-15\n-9\n\nV,\nkt\n100\n100\n100\n\nMVD,\n\xce\xbcm\n140\n140\n30\n\nLWC,\ng/m3\n1.17\n1.17\n0.80\n\n\xcf\x84,\nmin\n14.0\n14.0\n28.0\n\n\xce\xb2 0,\n\n%\n94.4\n94.4\n68.9\n\nAc\n\n\xce\xb20Ac\n\nn0\n\n1.91\n1.91\n2.61\n\n1.80\n1.80\n1.80\n\n0.30\n0.50\n0.50\n\nupstream toward the stagnation. In figure 4, this narrowing of the smooth zone with time can be inferred from the\nshrinking of the width of the red reflection at the leading edge.\nAn abrupt transition took place from the leading-edge region to the feather region. The location of this transition\nwas determined when the local freezing fraction, increasing with distance from the stagnation, reached a value sufficiently high to permit rapid freezing. Because \xce\xb2 decreases with distance, those feathers at the transition grew the\nfastest and became the largest in the feather region. Feathers were also more dense in this location and tended to\nmerge together as they developed, forming a barrier. Unfrozen surface water moving aft in the leading-edge region\nwas prevented from further motion both by the physical obstruction of the feather structures at the transition site as\nwell as by the high rate of freezing there. Liquid water reaching this location would tend to flow into these merged\nfeathers, to fill voids in the feathers, and then to freeze to contribute to the structure. In this way, the ice horns\nformed.\nFigure 5 illustrates some of these features for the test of figure 4. It is a photograph of a portion of the feather region on the upper surface of the model taken at the completion of the test using the hand-held digital camera. The\nleading edge of the model is to the right in this picture,\nand during the spray, flow was from right to left. The discrete nature of the feathers is apparent, as is the fact that\nbetween the feathers there is no frozen water on the surface. On the right of the photograph, the largest feathers\ncan be seen. Beyond them and out of focus in the background is the aft plane of the upper-surface horn. On close\ninspection feather structures can be seen embedded into\nthe downstream surface of the horn.\nOther than the interaction at the transition, the two regions appeared to continue to develop independently. At\n105 sec in figure 4 the feathers were just discernible,\nwhile the rough zone of the leading-edge region has\nspread forward nearly to the stagnation line. At 460 sec\nthe largest feathers had reached a significant size, and in\nthe leading-edge region the rough zone now extended all\nthe way to the stagnation line. The frame at 920 sec was\ntaken just after the spray ended. The largest feathers continued to grow up to this point, but smaller feathers further aft ceased to develop after about 460 sec, presumably\nbecause they were shielded from the spray once the larger\nfeathers reached a certain size. The spanwise variation in\nthe width of the leading-edge ice from horn to horn is due\nto IRT cloud non-uniformities in LWC.\nThe two-dimensional profile of the final ice shape appears in the lower right panel of figure 4. The difference\nbetween the continuous-ice accretion within the leadingedge region and the discrete isolated structures of the\nfeather region is again apparent. At the transition between\n02-11-05/02 40581\nthe two regions, water has frozen over the upstream surfaces of the largest feathers to form a continuous spanwise Figure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Feather region and aft plane of horn on uphorn structure on both the pressure and suction sides of per surface at the completion of the spray of figure 4.\n02-11-05 run 2. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt; MVD, 140 \xce\xbcm;\nthe model.\n\xce\xb20, 94 percent; \xce\xb20Ac, 1.80; n0, 0.30.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n8\n\nFigure 6 presents a series of photographs taken during an accretion with only temperature changed from the test\nshown in figure 4. This change resulted in an increase in the stagnation freezing fraction from 0.30 to 0.50. Although\nthe collection efficiency was the same as for figure 4, the higher n0 for the case of figure 6 caused the location of the\ntransition from the leading-edge to the feather region to move forward. Because transition occurs when the local\nfreezing fraction is sufficiently high, this result is not surprising. Other than the narrower leading-edge region and\nwider feather region, the development of ice in the two regions appeared to progress much the same as it did in the\n\nSpray hits model.\n\n30 sec\n\n90 sec\n\n170 sec\n\n840 sec\n\nCenterline ice profile at end of spray.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Ice accretion development for 140-\xce\xbcm MVD and n0 = 0.50. 02-11-05 Run 5. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt;\n\xce\xb20, 94 percent; \xce\xb20Ac, 1.80.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n9\n\ncase of figure 4. Once again, the horn grew at the site of transition from continuous leading-edge ice to discrete\nfeather growth. The last frame of the figure, at the lower right, shows the ice profile traced at the completion of the\nspray.\nFigure 7 is a close-up photograph of the feathers on the lower surface, taken with the hand-held camera after the\nspray had ended. During the spray, the flow was from left to right. Compared to the feathers in figure 5, those in\nfigure 7 were characterized by fine branches that grew from the core. At the lower n0 of figure 5 water would have\ntaken longer to freeze on the feather, tending to fill in any branches. Measurement of feather angle also revealed that\nthe higher stagnation freezing fraction of figure 7 produced a smaller feather angle with respect to the chord line of\nthe model compared with that of figure 5. Thus, feather appearance and angle were both dependent on the freezing\nfraction.\nA third photographic sequence showing ice development is given in figure 8. The velocity and stagnation freezing fraction for this icing encounter are the same as for that of figure 6. However, the MVD has been reduced from\n140 to 30 \xce\xbcm to investigate possible differences between SLD and appendix C accretions. No change in the way\nappendix C and SLD feathers cover the surface initially and subsequently develop can be seen from the photos, except that the lower collection efficiency for the appendix C case resulted in a feather region that did not extend as far\naft as that of the SLD situation in figure 6. Due to the lower collection efficiency feathers did not grow as quickly\nfor the appendix C encounter.\nThe ice shape traced at the completion of the 30-\xce\xbcm test is shown in the last frame of figure 8. The profile is of a\nsimilar shape compared with the 140-\xce\xbcm test of figure 6, but both the horns and feathers were smaller. In order to\ncompare tests with the same velocity but different drop size, it was not possible to scale the conditions of figures 6\nand 8. In particular, \xce\xb20 could not be matched for the two tests. The differences in the profiles can be attributed to the\nreduced \xce\xb20 for the encounter of figure 8 compared with the conditions of figure 6. For scaling, clearly it is important\nto try to match the scale-test \xce\xb20 as closely to that determined by the reference conditions as possible.\nFigure 9 shows a portion of the lower surface feather region and the aft side of the lower horn as photographed in\nthe test section with the hand-held camera after the test of figure 8. The flow is from left to right in this picture. At\nthe left is the aft plane of the lower surface horn and some of the feathers can be seen imbedded into this surface.\nThe discrete nature of the feathers farther aft is apparent. The delicate branches and narrow base of these feathers,\nformed with a 30-\xce\xbcm spray, were also seen with the 140-\xce\xbcm-spray feathers documented in figure 7. Fundamental\ndifferences between appendix C and SLD feathers were not evident.\n\n02-11-05/05 40634\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Feather region and aft plane of horn on lower surface at the completion of the spray of figure 6. 02-11-05\nRun 5. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt; MVD, 140 \xce\xbcm; \xce\xb20, 94 percent; \xce\xb20Ac, 1.80; n0, 0.50.\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n10\n\nSpray hits model.\n\n73 sec\n\n241 sec\n\n881 sec\n\n1381 sec\n\nCenterline ice profile at end of spray.\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Ice accretion development for 30-\xce\xbcm MVD and n0 = 0.50. 02-11-05 Run 3. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt;\n\n\xce\xb20, 69 percent; \xce\xb20Ac, 1.80.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n11\n\n02-11-05/03 40594\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Lower surface horn aft plane and feather region at the completion of the spray\nof figure 8. 02-11-05 Run 3. c, 91.4 cm; V, 100 kt; MVD, 30 \xce\xbcm; \xce\xb20, 69 percent;\n\xce\xb20Ac, 1.80; n0, 0.50.\nB. Feather Angle\nThe angle at which the feathers grow relative to the chord line was introduced into the study of reference 3 as a\nquantitative characteristic to complement close-up photos of feather appearance. It was reasoned that if appendix C\nand SLD feathers showed markedly different angles, it might be logical to conclude that the processes controlling\nfeather growth were also different. While some differences were seen between the two regimes, they were small\nenough to conclude, at least tentatively, that the physics of formation were probably fundamentally the same. Data\nwere limited, however.\nFeather angles were measured again for the tests of this study to supplement the data of reference 3. The feather\nangle reported is that defined in figure 10 for both a lower-surface (fig. 10(a)) and an upper-surface feather\n(fig. 10(b)). In either case, angles were recorded as positive, and no distinction was made in reporting results to indicate which surface was analyzed.\nThe angle was determined by photographing the feather region of the accretion against a background of a dimensioned orthogonal grid. Figure 11 is an example of such a photo taken in the test section with the hand-held camera\nat the completion of one of the sprays. Some of the photographs taken during the spray from the overhead camera\nwere also used for angle measurements by digitally superimposing an orthogonal grid on the image. For images\nfrom both sources, the grid provided calibration information for both x and y dimensions. The angle was then found\nfrom the image using the angle-measuring capability of SigmaScan Pro software (ref. 13). The chordwise location of\nthe feather root and its angle were both recorded for well-defined feathers in each photograph. The angle was found\nto be independent of distance from stagnation; therefore, only ensemble average angles will be reported. Angles\nmeasured from different photos from the same test showed no significant differences within the scatter of data, and\ndata from all the photographs for a particular test were included in determining average values for that test.\nFor each test condition, feather-angle data were obtained from the overhead pictures taken during the test for times\nof approximately 12 and 100 percent of the total spray time. In figure 12 sample results from these within-spray photos\nare compared with angles measured from the after-test pictures taken within the test section. These tests used an MVD\nof 30 m at a velocity of 150 kt. Within the uncertainty of the data the feather angle did not change with time as the ice\naccreted and feathers grew. Furthermore, angles measured from the two photo sources were consistent. Although the\nlocal collection efficiency at a feather site must increase as the feather grows, the results of figure 12 suggest that the\nmechanism of feather formation that determines angle does not change significantly, it at all, from the time feather\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n12\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\xce\xb1\n\ny, cm\n\n8\n\n6\n\ny, cm\n\n8\n\n\xce\xb1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n-4 -2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-4 -2\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\nx, cm\n\nx, cm\n\n(a) Feather angle measured on lower surface.\n\n(b) Feather angle measured on upper surface.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Definition of feather angle. c, 36 in; V, 150 kt; MVD, 30 \xce\xbcm; n0, 0.30.\n90\n\nAngle with chord line, deg\n\n80\n70\n60\n\nSource of Photo\nOverhead, 12% Time\nOverhead, 100% Time\nTest Section, after Test\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n\n02-14-05/02 040705\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Feathers photographed against a grid for\nangle measurement.

The trend observed in reference 3, in which feather angle decreased with\nincreasing stagnation freezing fraction, is also apparent in this figure.\nThe horn angle was determined by averaging the horn upstream-surface angle and the horn aft-surface angle\nwith respect to the chord line. These angles were measured from the ice-profile tracings. Figure 13 illustrates the\nresulting horn angle. Horn angles are compared in figure 14 with those feather angles that were recorded after the\ntest. For this comparison, only the lower horn angle was used. The horn angle was always greater than the feather\nangle and showed the same decreasing trend with increasing stagnation freezing fraction. This result is consistent\nwith the mechanism of horn formation postulated above, in which the location and angle of those feathers nearest\nthe leading edge of the airfoil determine both horn location and angle.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n13\n\n90\n\n6\n\n80\n\n4\ny, cm\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-4 -2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\nAngle with chord line, deg\n\n8\n\nFeather Angle\nHorn Angle\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\nx, cm\n\n0\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94Definition of horn angle. c, 36 in; V,\n150 kt; MVD, 30 \xce\xbcm; n0, 0.30.\n\nStagnation Freezing Fraction, n0\n\nFigure 14.\xe2\x80\x94Comparison of horn angles with final\nfeather angles. c, 91.4 cm; V, 150 kt; MVD, 30 \xce\xbcm.\n\nV. Summary and Concluding Remarks\nIcing tests were performed using a 91-cm-chord NACA 0012 airfoil for both SLD and appendix C conditions\nwith the objective of identifying differences in feather formation for the two icing regimes. All tests were for glaze\nconditions, with stagnation freezing fractions of 0.30 to 0.50. Images taken 10 sec apart during the spray showed\ntwo major, distinct regions of ice growth from the time the spray first impacted the model: the leading-edge region,\nin which a thin film forms over the surface, and the feather region, in which small discrete feathers appeared, apparently from direct-impingement of drops in the spray cloud.\nThe feather region began some distance aft of the stagnation and extended to the impingement limit. The angle at\nwhich feathers grew relative to the chord line was found to be independent of time and position, but was a strong\nfunction of stagnation freezing fraction. Because the local collection efficiency decreases with distance from the\nstagnation line, feathers at the front of the feather region grew fastest and became the largest. Fairly soon into the\nspray, these upstream feathers grew together. The resulting structure would tend to form a barrier, preventing leading-edge-region surface water from flowing further aft. So blocked, this water would flow into and freeze onto the\nupstream face of the feather structure, producing glaze horns. This conclusion that feathers determine the location\nand angle of the horns in glaze icing encounters was substantiated by the fact that the horn angle was found to correlate with the feather angle. At some point, the larger upstream feathers captured cloud water droplets efficiently\nenough to shield the smaller downstream feathers from the cloud, and the latter ceased to grow. Analysis of photos\nand ice tracings taken at the completion of the spray showed that feather growth angle decreased with increasing\nstagnation freezing fraction.\nFor the limited conditions of this study, there was no evidence of any difference in the fundamental formation\nmechanisms of either feather growth or horn formation between SLD and appendix C conditions. This conclusion is\nconsistent with the findings of reference. However, SLD reference and appendix C scale tests performed in the past\nhave shown that while the main ice shape could be matched nondimensionally, relatively larger feathers occurred for\nthe SLD tests. Therefore, reasons for large feather formations other than unique physics of SLD icing need to be\ninvestigated. Potential causes of the feather-size differences for scaling tests include a mismatch of \xce\xb20 for some scaling tests, differences in shedding of feathers at the disparate model sizes and velocities required for scaling, and dissimilarities in the cloud MVD distributions for SLD and appendix C conditions. Each of these causes has a different\nimplication for scaling. If a better match of \xce\xb2o provides the feather agreement needed, the similarity parameters used\nin appendix C scaling methods can be used for SLD scaling as well. If feather shedding at the higher scale speeds\nexplains the smaller relative feather sizes for scale models, new similarity parameters will be needed to include\nshedding analysis in the scaling methodology. If the IRT nozzles generate cloud drop-size distributions that are\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942006-214127\n\n14\n\ndifferent for SLD and appendix C MVDs, ways to alter these distributions will need to be considered. Future\nresearch is being directed toward looking at each of these issues in order to resolve the feather-size issue and develop better SLD scaling methods.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n\nAnderson, David N., \xe2\x80\x9cA Preliminary Study of Ice-Accretion Scaling for SLD Conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA\xe2\x80\x932002\xe2\x80\x930521,\nJanuary 2002.\nAnderson, David N. and Tsao, J.C., \xe2\x80\x9cAdditional Results of Ice-Accretion Scaling at SLD Conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA\xe2\x80\x93\n2003\xe2\x80\x930390, January 2003.\nTsao, Jen-Ching and Anderson, David N., \xe2\x80\x9cFurther Assessment of MVD Effects in SLD Applications,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA\xe2\x80\x93\n2005\xe2\x80\x930072, January 2005.\nRuff, G.A., \xe2\x80\x9cAnalysis and Verification of the Icing Scaling Equations,\xe2\x80\x9d AEDC-TR-85-30, vol. 1 (rev),\nMarch 1986.\nAnderson, David N., \xe2\x80\x9cManual of Scaling Methods,\xe2\x80\x9d NASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212875, March 2004.\nAnderson, David N. and Tsao, J.C., \xe2\x80\x9cOverview of Icing Physics Relevant to Scaling,\xe2\x80\x9d FAA In-Flight\nIcing/Ground De-icing International Conference & Exhibition, SAE-2003-01-2130, June 16\xe2\x80\x9320, 2003.\nLangmuir, Irving and Blodgett, Katharine B. \xe2\x80\x9cA Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories,\xe2\x80\x9d\nArmy Air Forces Technical Report No. 5418, February 1946.\nAbbott, Ira H. and von Doenhoff, Albert E., Theory of Wing Sections, Dover, New York, 1959, pp. 114 and 321.\nMessinger, B.L., \xe2\x80\x9cEquilibrium Temperature of an Unheated Icing Surface as a Function of Airspeed,\xe2\x80\x9d J.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nScaling methods have been shown previously to work well for super cooled large droplet (SLD) main ice shapes. However,\nfeather sizes for some conditions have not been well represented by scale tests. To determine if there are fundamental\ndifferences between the development of feathers for appendix C and SLD conditions, this study used time-sequenced\nphotographs, viewing along the span of the model during icing sprays. An airspeed of 100 kt, cloud water drop MVDs of 30\nand 140 \xce\xbcm, and stagnation freezing fractions of 0.30 and 0.50 were tested in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel using\nan unswept 91-cm-chord NACA0012 airfoil model mounted at 0\xc2\xb0 AOA. The photos indicated that the feathers that\ndeveloped in a distinct region downstream of the leading-edge ice determined the horn location and angle. The angle at\nwhich feathers grew from the surface were also measured; results are shown for an airspeed of 150 kt, an MVD of 30 \xce\xbcm,\nand stagnation freezing fractions of 0.30 to 0.60. Feather angles were found to depend strongly on the stagnation freezing\nfraction, and were independent of either chordwise position on the model or time into the spray. Feather angles also\ncorrelated well with horn angles. For these tests, there did not appear to be fundamental differences between the physics of\nSLD and appendix C icing; therefore, for these conditions similarity parameters used for appendix C scaling appear to be\nvalid for SLD scaling as well. Further investigation into the cause for the large feather structures observed for some SLD\nconditions will continue.\n14. SUBJECT TERMS\n\n15.
