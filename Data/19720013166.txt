b'FINAL REPORT\nDISCRETE INPUT EQUIPMENT DESIGN STUDY\n\nPrepared for:\nGeorge C. Marshall Space Flight Center\nHuntsville, Alabama\nContract No. NAS8-27801\nContract for Study and Design Concepts\nfor a Discrete Input Equipment\n\nPrepared by:\nRCA\nElectromagnetic and Aviation Systems Division\nVan Nuys, California\n\nJanuary 1972\n\nSummary\nThis study effort verified that a Discrete Input Equipment (DIE)\ncould be built in accordance with all key items in the specification.\nNo specified parameters were identified that could not be met.\nThe study raised some questions about the desirability of some\nspecified parameters. The most significant of these is the scanning rate which seems to far exceed both extrapolations from\nSaturn experience and the capability of other equipment in the Saturn\ncomplex. Other items that should be re-examined by NASA include the\nspecified concept of a concentrated system versus the possibility\nof a distributed system, the possibility of considering changes to\nexisting data link and/or computer equipment in the existing\ncomplex, etc.\nThe effort on this study was performed during the period from\nJuly, 1971 through January, 1972 inclusive. With the exception of\na kickoff meeting and two design reviews, all work was performed at\nRCA\'s Van Nuys facility.\nOrganization of Report\nThis report is written using the Second Design Review presentation\nas a vehicle. The charts used in this presentation are included\nin their entirety as Appendix A. In cases where the charts are not\nself explanatory, additional narrative is included in the body of\nthe report.\nSpecification Interpretation\n\n(See A4)\n\nThe available funds and time changed dramatically from those available when the need for this study was first envisioned by MSFC.\nAs a result of these changes, it was mutually decided to emphasize\nsystem concepts as opposed to attempting a detailed design of what\nwould have to be limited areas of the DIE. Specifically excluded\nwere detailed logic designs in any area and power supply design.\nThe specification problem referred to is that of the very high\ntime resolution and data rates implied by the specified parameters.\nThis problem is discussed elsewhere in this report.\n\n-1-\n\nQuestions (See A5)\nThis chart elaborates on the specification problem referred to on\nA4. The specification requires that 3600 DI\'s must be scanned in a\ntime between 0.5 and 2 milliseconds depending on the number of changes.\nThe implications of this scan time and some of the questions it\ngenerates are discussed below.\nOne reason for specifying a high scan speed could be to provide good\ntime resolution and to provide an early report on any detected activity.\nSince the spec does not require time tagging of activity reports, permits\nthe scanning to stop temporarily if the data link can\'t keep up and\nsince the scan period is allowed to vary by a factor of 4 as a function\nof activity; it seems that the goal is neither early reports nor high\nresolution time tagging.\nAnother reason for the high scan speed could be to support accurate\nreports during high discrete activity periods. The best data we\ncould get on Saturn experience indicates that during peak discrete\nactivity periods there are approximately 10 discrete changes per\nsecond. The specified DIE scan rates can handle activity as high\nas 1,800,000 (3600 \xc2\xb1 .002) changes per second. It is improbable that\nthis increase in activity will be realized.\nAnother aspect of this requirement that should be considered is\nthe ability of the data link and computer to accept and process\nall of this information. A maximum discrete activity situation\nwith the specified scan rate would generate data at the rate of\n150,000 words per second. This figure becomes 300,000 words per\nsecond when special input activity is considered. This considerably\nexceeds the rate at which either the present or assumed data link\ncan transmit words (5,555 and 222,222 words respectively). It also\nfar exceeds the rate at which the computer can accept words.\nWe assume that the LCC computer must input the data, log it on tape,\nand process it for decision making, summary logging, summary printing,\nissuing of discrete outs, etc. At peak times, data input and logging\nonly would bit 600,000 transfers per second (1,800,000 if information\nis handled as 8 bit bytes). When processing and other I/O is added tq\n\n-2-\n\nthis, it represents a challenging load for any computer.\nAircraft Integrated Data Systems (AIDS) (See All through A15)\nThis information was included as part of the design review to\ndemonstrate a contrasting approach to a similar problem. In the\nparticular AIDS approach shown, the signal conditioners and\nconverters were distributed over the entire complex and interconnected with a party line. This approach as implemented traded\noff speed against cabling complexity, cabling weight, and a relatively large central system.\nMTBF Considerations (See A17)\nThe MTBF of a simplex system that meets the specified probability\nof success of .995 for a 20 hour mission is 4,000 hours. The\nfigures provided from the Saturn program are for reference. These\nfigures show that the specified reliability performance is in the\nballpark of that achieved for the Saturn DI\'s. Note that this is\nnot a completely fair comparison for two reasons.\nFirst, the DIE equipment includes more functions than the Saturn\nDI equipment. It handles more discretes at a higher rate, contains\nits own status memory, etc.\nSecond, the DIE replaces the entire 110A system except for the data\nlink and the DCE equipments. Thus in the proposed new system only the\nDIE, Data Link and DCE contribute to mission failure probability whereas in the present system the entire 110A system contributes to\nmission failure probability.\nThe MTBF for a Simplex DIE was estimated at 3360 hours which is\nequivalent to a probability of 20 hour mission success of slightly\nover .994 compared to the specified value of .995. Since the MTBF\ncalculation is based on several approximations, including the failure\nrate and a cursory logic count estimate, several values (ranging\nfrom 2500 to 4000 hours) are used for calculating the reliability\nof a TMR system in order to show a reliability range.\nThe MTBF of a TMR system varies as a function of time. A technique\nfor evaluating mission success criteria of redundant systems is that\nof computing the probability of mission success for the redundant\nsystem and then determining what MTBF a simplex system would be\nrequired to have to achieve an equivalent success probability. These\n-3-\n\nresults are listed under the TMR MTBF column.\nFor example, if a simplex equipment with an MTBF of 3,333- hours were\nbuilt 3 times, synchronized, and the outputs voted, it would have\nthe same probability of success for a 20 hour mission as a simplex\nequipment with an MTBF of 187,000 hours. The table below shows this\nsame information using probability of failure as the dependent variable.\nSIMPLEX\nMTBF\n4000\n3333\n2857\n2500\n\nSIMPLEX FAILURE\nPROBABILITY\n\n\'\n\n.005*\n.006\n.007\n.008\n*.005 is specified\n\nTMR FAILURE\nPROBABILITY\n.0000744\n.000107\n.000145\n.000189\nvalue.\n\nRA1IO\n67\n56\n48\n42\n\nThus it is seen that the proposed system easily meets the specified probability of success.\nThe figures below the table on A17 were included to show the\nconservative nature of the numbers in the table. For example, the\ntable assumes that the entire data link interface within the DIE\ncan be made TMR. The data link, however, is simplex. Therefore\nat some point within the DIE the logic will become simplex. If\nwe assume that the entire data link interface is simplex, the equivalent\nsimplex DIE equipment with the same probability of success would have\nan MTBF of 35,000 hours. The equivalent failure probability is\n.000671 which far exceeds the specification.\nThe other two values at the bottom of A17 show that the specification is easily met even if the logic count grows by a factor of 2\nand that the equipment as estimated will meet the reliability\nspecification even if the individual integrated circuit 7- increases\nby a factor of 7.\nMTBF Qualifications (See A18)\nThis information is included to indicate some of the uncertainties\nin the reliability calculations. We believe that the results described on A17 are quite conservative and these qualifications describe\nsome of the reasons.\nThe circuit MTBF figure was chosen on the basis of figures being used\non some high reliability programs in process at RCA. Our experience\n-4-\n\nhas shown that there is a great deal of uncertainty in available knowledge\nof integrated circuit failure rates. This uncertainty is very high\nin new technologies. General industry experience has been that the\ncomponents in any given technology improve as use of that technology\nbecomes more widespread. Experience has also been that each new\ntechnology that is reduced to practice exhibits improved reliability\ncharacteristics. The figures that we used on this study are believed\nto be true as of the present time. They should improve somewhat by\nthe time a DIE is actually built. (The failure rates used assume\nthat standard quality integrated circuits are used employing good\nparts control practices. We did not assume that special high reliability components would be used.)\nThe detailed circuit count was based on the block diagram (see A22).\nA cursory logic design was made for most blocks and used as a basis\nfor a component count. Other blocks were counted by ratioing from\nsimilar blocks. All of this was done in a conservative fashion.\nFor those blocks which have an analog in the existing Saturn equipment, the full circuit count from the existing design was translated\nto an integrated circuit count and used intact. This count is also\nvery conservative since functional elements that won\'t be needed in the\nDIE were included in several cases. Also no attempt was made to\noptimize the existing designs for the new technology.\nThe reliability equation used to evaluate the TMR approach is\npessimistic. It equates probability of success to the probability that\neither all three redundant channels are totally operational or that\nany two of the three channels are totally operational. In actuality\nthe TMR equipment will continue to provide correct results in a large\npercentage of the multiple failure situations. Thus the calculated\nMTBF figure should be considered a lower bound of the actual value.\nThe reliability equation was applied pessimistically since the\ncalculation assumed that voters were used only at the very output of\nthe DIE. In reality the design uses voters at several points\ninternally as well as at the output. In other words the expression\n2\n3\n3R - 2R was used to calculate the reliability whereas a less pessimistic\nexpression would be of the form 7T (3R. - 2R.).\nDIE Communication with Data Link (See A19 through A21)\nAs shown on A21, bilateral use will be made of both the data and\n-5-\n\ncommand channels of the data link. This makes it possible to use\nthe existing format for DO commands. With the exception of the DO\ncommands, all messages from the computer will be one word long. All\nmessages to the computer will be two words long. Some details of\nthe word format are discussed below.\nA19 shows the word formats for information from the computer. The\nDO Address and Data will not change from the formats used now. They\nwill not be discussed here. A description of the DI Command, Special\nCommand, and Mask Setup formats follows.\nBit 23 is used to distinguish between Mask Setup and the other commands.\nThe Mask Setup command is used to control the 300 mask bits that\nare used in some DI modes. Bits 19 through 22 of the Mask Setup\ncommand specify 16 different sets of mask bits. Bits 0 through 18\nof the Mask Setup command specify 19 actual mask bits.\nBit 22 of the DI Command and Special Command specify whether the\ncommand is for DI\'s or Special inputs (Si\'s). Each of these command\ntypes has a different format. They are described separately below.\nDI Command .\njit 21 specifies whether the mode should be Monitor or Scan.\nBit 20 specifies whether all DI\'s within the specified blocks\nshould be processed or whether only those DI\'s with their\nassociated mask bit set should be processed.\nBits 10 through 19 are used to specify which of the 19 blocks of\n16 DI words each should be processed. (Note that the last block\ncontains only 12 DI words.) As shown in the figure, the program\nwould specify the first block to be used and how many consecutive\nblocks following should be used.\nBit 2, DL Control Word, should be marked "unused" .\ngits 0 and 1 are used to control termination. As indicated one\nof these causes immediate termination, the other causes termination at the end of the current scan cycle. If the specified mode\nis Scan and the terminate bits are not set, at the end of one scan\nthe mode will change to Monitor.\n. SI Command\nj3its 20 and 21 specify which mode should be generated.\nBit 19 specifies whether the interrupt flag should be set in\nactivity reports which follow. It should be noted that SI activity\nreports use the data link command channel and therefore each\n-6-\n\nactivity report generates two computer interrupts independent of\nthis bit. It is possible that this bit could be used to generate\na special kind of interrupt. It is also possible that this bit\n- could be used to establish priority by virtue of software interpretation.\nBit 18 is used to define whether the command applies only to the\nSI group defined by the group number or whether it applies to all\nspecials.\nBits 6 through 14 specify the\'group. Since there are only 16 SI\ngroups, 4 bits could be used. However, nine"bits are used so that\naddresses for the Si\'s, DI\'s and any words used for control purposes can be made unique.\nBits 0 through 2 are the same as for DI Commands. In the case of\nthe Si\'s there is little, if any, significance to the difference\nbetween Terminate Now and Terminate at End of Scan.\nA20 shows the word formats for information sent to the computer. All\ninformation is sent to the computer in pairs of words. Each pair\nincludes one ID Word and one Value Word. The Value Word contains\nup to 24 bits of data and in general will convey the value of one DI\ngroup or one SI group. The Value Word will also convey information\nsuch as feedback of commands, status, disagreement detector state,\netc.\nThe ID word contains several "unused" bits. These may be used to\nprovide message sequence numbers. Current thinking is that time\ninformation will not be included with each report. Instead a 24\nbit time message will be generated at the end of each scan in which\nany activity occurs.\nBits 20 and 21 in the ID word define the mode in which the DIE is\noperating if the report is for DI or SI activity.\nBit 19 contains the Interrupt Flag if the report is for SI activity.\n(See the discussion under Bit 19 of the SI Command.)\nBit 18 contains the Mask Bit for the group in a DI report.\nBit 17 indicates whether a parity bit is associated with the group\nfor an SI report.\nBit 16 indicates good or bad parity and should not be interpreted\nunless bit 17 indicates that a parity bit is present.\nBit 15 is used to flag a word if the data link requests a repeat\ntransmission.\n-7-\n\nBits 6 through 14 provide the actual identification of the nature\nof the report. Nine bits as shown provide 512 combinations. Three\nhundred are used to identify DI groups and 16 are used to identify\nSI groups. The remaining 196 combinations are available for other\npurposes. A number would be used for disagreement detector reports,\nsome for identification of command reports that are fed back for\nverification, etc.\nBit 5 is used to report the state of a test bit. This will be\ndiscussed in some detail in the material under A26 and A27.\nDIE Block Diagram (See A22)\nAs indicated above in the reliability discussion, the reliability\nrequirement does not present a serious problem. Most probably a\ncareful simplex design could meet it. The fault tolerant requirements imposed by the specification, however, do require a redundant\nsystem independent of the reliability performance.\nBefore we realized the ease with which the reliability requirement\ncould be met, a brief literature survey was made in an attempt to\nlocate optimal redundancy approaches. Nothing more attractive\nthan classic TMR was located for this application.\nOne channel of the block diagram is shown on A22. The circles on\nthe block diagram indicate the location of voting points. A number,\nn, beside a circle indicates the number of voter points symbolized\nby the circle. Each voter point is made up of 3 voters and 9\ndisagreement detectors. Each voter may be considered to be a part\nof 1 TMR channel in that, although it receives an input from each\nof the 3 channels, its output drives only one channel. Three of the\nnine disagreement detectors are associated with each voter so that\nthe voter output can be compared with each input. This makes it\npossible to easily identify a failed channel or a failed voter.\nThe dashed lines on the block diagram represent the proposed\nimplementation of timing. One of the difficult problems to resolve\nin any redundant design is generation of central timing in such a\nfashion that it is fault tolerant. Because it is necessary to\nvote logic signals at various points in the system it is necessary\nto synchronize the different channels. Thus, if multiple clocks are\nused, they must be synchronized. There are serious questions about\n\n-8-\n\nthe desirability of synchronizing oscillators for this purpose.\nIt was decided that we would resolve this problem in the proposed\nDIE organization by providing three switchable timing systems such\nthat in normal operation of the system each would drive a different\nsection of the hardware. These sections have been named SI Timing,\nDI Timing, and Common Timing as indicated by dashed lines and titles\non A22.\nThe switching for the timing systems is manually controlled such\nthat timing can be distributed to the entire DIE as long as at\nleast one timing system is still operational. The different timing\nsections of the DIE were chosen in such a fashion that failure of\none of the timing systems would be easily detected. For example,\nif one of the DI\'s and one of the Si\'s were made to cycle at a low\nbut known rate, the failure of DI Timing or SI Timing would be\ndetected very early and the timing systems could be switched.\nThe general operation of the block diagram is fairly self evident.\nOnly certain fairly unique aspects of it will be discussed here.\nThese aspects are DlS\'s, status and selection of voter points.\nThe term DI5\'s represents a block of special-design LSI circuits.\nEach of these circuits can interface with 25 external signals such\nas DI\'s, Si\'s or DIE internal status signals. In the case of Si\'s\nand DI\'s, 24 of these signals would be one actual group; the 25th\nbit is for test purposes. There will be 150 or 300 of these circuits\nin the DI portion of the DIE. There will be 16 of these circuits\nin the Si section of the equipment. The operation of this circuit\nis described in more detail below. (See A26 and A27)\nThe Status section of the equipment is identical in organization to\nthe DI and SI section. Its purpose is to make status information\navailable to the LCC. Complete details of what this status will\ninclude must be worked out as a portion of the final design.\nExamples of the type of status that will be provided are operating\nmodes, current timing system switching arrangement, disagreement\ndetector values, etc.\nThree criteria should be used for selection of voter locations.\nThese are maximization of probability of mission success,\nresolution of "race-like" conditions that might otherwise occur in\nnormal operation, and maximizing the utility of the associated\n\ndisagreement detectors for fault isolation.\nnecessarily listed in order of importance.)\n\n(These items are not\n\nIt is believed impractical to do a good gob of voter location for\nfault isolation purposes until the design is much further along.\nTherefore, fault isolation by use of this technique has not yet\nbeen incorporated in the block diagram.\nFor purposes of maximizing success probability it. is desirable to\ndivide the system into equal sections from a failure rate perspective.\nFor the DIE, the simplex failure rate is in the range of 250 to\n300 failures per million hours. The contribution of the DlS\'s in\nthe DI section of the system is 150 failures per million hours which\nis close to optimal from a probability of success viewpoint. Symmetry would lead to.the placing of voters at equivalent points in the\nSI and Status sections; however, there is an even better reason\nwhich is described -immediately below.\nSince the DI5 circuit by definition of its application interfaces\nwith at least two sets of asynchronous signals, there .will be cases\nwhere the redundant circuits will legitimately interpret the same\nsignal differently at a given instant of time. The reasons for this\nare differences in wiring capacity, thresholds, etc. By voting at the\nthe DI5 circuit output disagreements of this kind will not propogate\ninto other sections of the DIE.\nVoter Quantity Considerations (See A23 and A24)\nAt first glance the proposed DIE organization appears to use\nrelatively few voters. It is probable that for reasons of enhanced\nfault isolation capabilities some voters would be added at appropriate points in the equipment. On the other hand there are reasons\nagainst adding voters. One reason is that the 9 disagreement\ndetector status bits would have to be monitored both as status bits\nand as indicators. (In some cases there is a desire to have several\nkinds of disagreement detector report from a particular voter point.)\nAnother reason for not adding voters is the need for complete testing\nof the system before each mission. The addition of each voter point\nadds to the complexity and execution time of this testing. Further,\nthe point can be reached where the failure rate of the voter can\nactually detract from the reliability of the system.\n-10-\n\nA24 shows a comparison of the voter quantity in the existing DCE\nequipment and in the proposed DIE (the DCE numbers are approximate).\nThe large voter count for the DCE is due to the parallel nature of\nmuch of the processing. One of these paths is over 2000 bits wide,\nseveral are 24 bits wide. On the other hand the DIE is predominantly\nserial. When this difference is\' taken into account the comparison\nis quite close.\nBuffer Size Considerations (See A25)\nAs discussed earlier in this report, the data rates that can be\ngenerated by the DIE exceed the capacity of the balance of the system.\nThe choice of a buffer size must be based on some assumptions\nabout the characteristics of peak data rate periods. This chart\nshows some numbers as a function of 3 possible different limiting\nsystem elements and assumed peak data rate (300,000 wps) periods of\n4 and 8 milliseconds. A25 assumes that no command word feedback or\nstatus word transmission takes place during peak transmission periods.\nDI5 Chip Design (See A26 and A27)\nThese sheets show the organization of the LSI chip design upon which\nthe proposed DIE is based. The chip would be packaged in a 40\npin package and could be built using any one of a number of technologies. A specific choice should not be made until the build\ndate is determined in order to retain flexibility.\nSheet A26 shows some of the address gating and control. The FR GATE\nsignal is used on A27 to sample the input signals each time that\nthe ADDRESS IN line is true and either SCAN + UNMASKED MODE or the\nMASK flip flop is set.\nThe ADDRESS SHIFT pulse shifts the ADDRESS IN bit into a flip flop\nwhich generates ADDRESS OUT and also permits SHIFT pulses to recirculate the registers on A27. The same flip flop enables the output\nof the SELECTED GROUP signal which is a function of the MASK flip flop.\nThe MASK flip flop is controlled by the MASK IN and SAMPLE IN signals\nwhich are decoded from the Setup Mask command word.\n\n-11-\n\nThe two registers on A27 are used to hold current and history\nvalues for the input data. The 25 "exclusive or" gates compare\nthis information and at the appropriate time the result of this\ncomparison is set into the CHANGE OUT flip flop. When the REG\nSHIFT pulses are generated, the first rank register which contains\ncurrent data is shifted off the chip where it is voted with the\nsimilar outputs of two identical chips wired to the same input\nsignals. The resultant information is transmitted to the data link\nand recirculated back into both the first and second rank registers\non the chip under discussion.\nThe chip logic will be made 25 bits wide instead of the required\n24 in order to facilitate various test operations. Stimulation\nof the 25th bit by external equipment or by special internal test\ncircuits automatically or under program control can be used to\ntest large portions of the DIE. The state of this bit is reported\nin bit 5 of the ID Word (See A20).\nTest Phases (See A28)\nThis sheet identifies the various test phases that a development\nof the new DIE capability will require. Probably the most\nsignificant thing to be noted is that DIE testing is most efficiently\nperformed at the vendor plant and will require either significant\nportions of the present ground computer system in close proximity\nor will require a significant investment in simulation equipment.\nThe phrase "add PB\'s" under "Pre Mission Validation" refers to the\nadmissibility of adding printed circuit boards for test purposes.\nTest (See A29)\nAny project to build a DIE should consider use of external equipment\nto facilitate test. A good example of this is the signal conditioner\nequipment. The existing equipment has limited, manually controlled\nability to control the inputs to the DIE. With the growth in quantity\nof DI\'s and availability of improved miniaturization of circuitry,\nserious consideration should be given toward including the signal\nconditioners in the programmable system test.\n\n-12-\n\nControl Panel Concepts (See A30 and A31)\nThe control panel cannot be intelligently designed until further\nsystem details are developed. However, an attempt was made to\nidentify some functions that should be considered for the control\npanel. Most of the items listed on A30 are self explanatory and\neasily accomplished. The first few are not so obvious and are\nshown in somewhat more detail on A31.\nThe top section of A31, Dynamic DD/Word Display, may be used to\nmonitor the overall operation of the DIE. The lights (L) are driven\nfrom points near the actual data link interface such that the display\nwill operate only if the system is essentially operational. The\nswitch(es) are used to control the operating mode of this section of\nthe panel. IN/OUT determines whether the panel should display data\nflowing to or from the data link. DO/OTHER determines which data link\nchannel should be monitored when data coming from the data link is\nbeing displayed. ANY/PARTICULAR determines whether every message should\nbe displayed or whether only information with a particular group number\nshould be displayed. In the latter case, the digiswitches (DS) are\nused to select the desired group number.\nThe matrix of 180 lights will display the disagreement detectors\nduring normal operation. The top 3 rows display the disagreement\ndetectors corresponding to .the detectors in the DI and SI section\nof the equipment. Since the actual group number for which the\ndisagreement occurred will be of interest, the 9 lights labelled GROUP\nNO./WORD DISP will display the appropriate group number. The 3\nunlabeled indicators identify which of the top three rows of the\nlight matrix was updated last and corresponds to the GROUP NO./\nWORD DISP.\nIn other modes of operation, 6 lights of the GROUP NO./WORD DISP in\nconjunction with the 18 lights in the top row of the large matrix\ndisplay a full 24 bit word. The WORD DISP in conjunction with the\nsecond row of the large matrix portrays a second 24 bit word.\nThe central section of the panel depicted on A31 is labelled DI5\nSIMULATOR/DL COMMAND INSERTION. In the DI5 simulator mode these\n\n-13-\n\nswitches can be used to insert manually originated data into the\nsystem as if the data originated via a DI5. The BLOCK SELECT\nswitches make it possible to select which block the DI5 simulator\nshould work with. In the command insertion mode, any command can\nbe manually generated such that the DIE will treat it as if it were\nreceived from the data link.\nThe bottom portion of A31, labelled VOTER/DD TESTING, consists of\n3 position switches that are used to control logic circuits of the\nform shown on A32. The concept is that circuits of this type would\nbe packaged on special test boards. The DIE would be wired such that\neach channel segment would provide for insertion of this circuit at\nits output to a voter point. Approximately 19 of these circuits could\nbe packaged on one plug in. (Test plug ins of this nature would be\nreplaced by boards with printed jumpers during normal operation.)\nWhen the test circuits are in place, the switches indicated on A31\ncould be used to force any combination of 1\'s and O\'s to the voter\ninputs. Through the use of various combinations of these switches\nthe operability of every channel segment, every voter, and every\ndisagreement detector can be verified. When the test is completed\nthe jumper boards will be reinserted. The integrity of the jumper\nboards can be verified by inspection of the disagreement detector\nlights after reinserting the jumper boards.\nPackaging (See A33 and A34)\nPer mutual agreement very little effort was spent in studying packaging.\nSheets A33 and A34 show views of a packaging technique now being used\nfor RCA supplied electronic equipment for use on naval destroyers.\nThis package meets or exceeds all specified environmental parameters.\nThe electronics needed for DIE can be housed in one of these bays\nfor 3600 DI\'s and in 1% of these bays for 7200 DI\'s. There appear\nto be several ways in which the "guts" of this package can be\nmounted inside the specified NASA console and meet all requirements.\nA brief description of the currently favored approach follows:\nEach console would contain two sliding frames. Each frame would\nhouse two racks. One of these racks can swing out when the sliding\nframe is in the extended position. Access to the nest wiring would be\navailable in this fashion. (A33 shows the cabinet with the wiring\n\n-14-\n\nin two racks exposed.)\nThe favored approach would differ from that pictured in that the\nsliding frames and their racks would be shortened in depth such\nthat they would occupy only the front half of the console in their\nnormal position. This would leave the entire back half of the\nconsole for dealing with the control panel and the large quantity\nof interface connectors needed for this application. The control\npanel would be a swing out panel near the top of the console. A\nvertical panel with sloping surfaces would be mounted about half\nway back in the console. All external cable connectors would be\nplugged into this panel. Ribbon cables as shown on A34 would\ninterconnect between this connector interface panel and the racks\nin the sliding frames.\nThe complete DIE would be housed in two or three consoles as\ndescribed above depending oh the number of DI\'s handled by the\nsystem. One of these two or three consoles would have a control\npanel in the rear. The other console(s) would have a blank panel in\nthe rear.\nIn the normal secured operating position the rear of each console would\nbe closed with swinging panels. The control panel would be mounted\non one of these panels in one of the consoles.\nRecommendations (See A35 and A36)\nThe important recommendations fall into two categories. One of these\nis that more effort should be exerted to take maximal advantage of\n"know how" that has been developed to date on the Saturn project. As\nmany aspects as practical should be considered. Many of these are\nmentioned on A35 and A36.\nThe second recommendation involves the desire to make maximal use of\nadvanced technology. Advances are being made so quickly that it\nwould be desirable to reduce the DIE to practice via a multiphase\nproject, scheduled in advance so that full advantage can be taken of\nthen current capabilities.\n\n-15-\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nSECOND DESIGN REVIEW\nFOR\nDISCRETE INPUT EQUIPMENT DESIGN STUDY\n\nPrepared for:\nGeorge C.
