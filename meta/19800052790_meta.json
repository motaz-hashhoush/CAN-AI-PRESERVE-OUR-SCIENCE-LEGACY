Many Spacelab science and applications programs have been identified for the 1980s. These include the Solar Optical Telescope, the Chemical Release Module, a variety of materials processing facilities, the Atmospheric Cloud Physics Laboratory, and the Spacelab Infrared Telescope Facility. Experiments carried out by these payloads will range from passive observation of remote astronomical sources to in situ active probing of the earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere to the examination of the processing of materials in space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19800052790, "name": "Shuttle to the next space age", "location": "Huntsville, Ala", "id": "477830461c014366aab16911ad4a6c85"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800052790, "id": "778d74e2ea6b40769ae0477f16cdb410", "publicationDate": "1979-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
