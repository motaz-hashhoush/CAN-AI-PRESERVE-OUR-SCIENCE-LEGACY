O\xe2\x80\x99Kane, Friendswood, Tex., assignor to the\nUnited States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space 5\nAdministration\nFiled Apr. 7,1964, Ser. No. 358,127\n12 CEainas. (a.\n2-2.1)\nThe invention described herein may be manufactured\nand used by or for the government of the United States\nof America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.\nThis invention relates generally to pulley-type tightening devices and more particularly to a helmet and torso\ntiedown mechanism for pressure suits.\nWith the exception of the helmet, which is conventionally a type of hard plastic, pressure suits designed for\nuse by aviators and astronauts are generally fabricated\nfrom a flexible air-impermeable material, such as rubberized stretchable fabric. It is therefore a characteristic\nof pressure suits that upon inflation to standard pressures\nof 3.4 to 5.0 p.s.i.a. the suit tends to increase in over-all\nlength due to the difference between the internal gas pressure of the suit and the atmospheric pressure or space\nvacuum environment external to the suit. This lengthening of the suit clauses the helmet and shoulders of the suit\nto ride up on the person wearing the suit with consequent\nincreased discomfiture and impairment of his mobility.\nIn addition, the resulting upward movement of the helmet\ncauses displacement of communication devices within the\nhelmet from their normal operating positions and thereby\nhinders their effective use. The movement of the helmet\nalso displaces the helment visor to a position where the\nangles of visibility through the visor are decreased and\nvisibility reduced.\nAnother problem characteristically associated with pressure suits is the difficulty in sitting or bending at the waist\ndue to the internal suit pressure which tends to maintain\nthe suit in rigid configuration. Sitting or bending at the\nwaist also results in hhe suit lifting up on the torso and\nexerting an upward pull on the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s head since the person, in effect, sits down within the suit and his head moves\ndownward into the neck part of the suit.\nVarious devices have been used in an attempt to alleviate these problems. One such device is a suspender\nbuilt within the suit with its ends fastened to the trousers\npart and the loops or bights passed over @heshoulders.\nThis suspender device cannot be adjusted after the suit is\ninflated and is dficult to adjust once the suit is\ndonned. It is also ineffectual in keeping the helmet\nfrom rising up on the wearer since it does not attach to\nthe helmet.\nAnother type of pressure suit tiedown system, disclosed\nin U.S. Patent No. 2,973,521, uses external cinch belt\narrangements located in the front and back of the suit.\nThe cinch belts can be adjusted only by the person wearing the suit when the suit is unpressurized and do not\nprovide for any mechanical advantage in operation.\nAlso, for any adjustment of the suit after pressurization,\ncaution must be exercised to insure that the tiedown mechanism is in a securely locked condition before releasing\nin order to avoid possible injury. Other tiedown systems have been used which are similar to the cinch-belt\ntype but whioh incorporate pulleys to provide mechanical\nadvantage when making adjustments. These systems,\nhowever, require the use of cords which are so long that\nthey easily become fouled or snarled. They also require\nthe safeguard of making certain that the mechanism is\nsecurely locked before releasing.\nThe pressure suit tiedown mechanism of this invention\nwhiclh has been devised to overcome attendant disad-\n\n1Q\n\n16\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\nvantages of the prior art requires little effort on the part\nof the suit wearer to operate and it possesses the added\nadvantages of relisability and safety. The mechanism is\npositioned in the front of the suit and attached thereto\nby cables fastened to opposite sides of a rigid neck ring\nof the suit on which the helmet is removably secured, or\nthey may alternatively be attaohed to opposite sides of\nthe helmet itself. The mechanism is also secured by\nflexible cords to one end of a crotch belt which is\nsecured at its other end to the suit in the vicinity of the\ncrotch, or alternatively, is passed under the crotch and\nattached to the back of @he\nsuit. The mechanism includes\na pulley block assembly on which are mounted a pair of\nrollers or pulleys for supporting a pair of the cords, each\nof which is reeved over one of the pulleys and attached\nat its ends to the crotch belt. Each of the cords is adapted\nfor free movement in one direction and is precluded from\nmovement in reverse direction by ,a pivotal olamp which\nis normally in frictional engagement with hhe cord and\nclamps the cord when the cord is pulled in the direction\nopposed to its direction of free movement. As arranged,\nthe direction of free movement for each cord is opposite\nthe direction of free movement of the other.\nOperation of the mechanism to shorten the suit involves\ngrasping the two movable cords with both hands and\npulling in the directions opposed to their directions of\nfree movement to spread the cords in front of the chest.\nSince the cords are held clamped during this action, forces\nare exerted on the crotch belt and the neck ring which\ndraw the two together and effectively shorten the suit\nand hold down the helmet. Further, since the pull on\nthe cords by the hands is directed substantially perpendicular, a practically infinite mechanical advantage is\ninitially attained which decreases as the cords are spread\nbut nevertheless insures that little effort is required to\noperate the mechanism.\nThe cord pair are also each provided with an elastic\nsection which maintains the cord taut while permitting\nvariation in its length. The elastic section exerts a constant pull on the cord in the direction of its free movement whereby when the cords are released by the hands\ntheir elastic sections pull the cords over the pulleys and\ncause the cord clamps to release. However, the adjustment which has been made in the length of the suit by\nspreading of the cord pair is maintained when the cords\nare released by the hands by a restraining means comprising a restraining cord.\nThe restraining cord, like the other cords, is reeved\nover a pulley carried by the mechanism and fastened at\nits ends to the crotch belt. It is also permitted free movement in one direction but is limited in reverse movement\nby a pivotal clamp which is normally in frictional engagement with the cord. As the suit is shortened by spreading\nof the cord pair, an elastic section of the restraining cord\nkeeps the restraining cord taut and pulls it in free movement over its associated pulley as the cord becomes\nshorter. However, when the cord pair are released by\nthe hands the internal pressure of the suit causes an\ninitial lengthening of the suit and the restraining cord\nwhich moves a limited distance over its pulley in the\ndirection opposed to its direction of free movement until\nit is clamped by pivotal movement of its associated\nclamp. This clamping action prevents any further movement of the restraining cord or lengthening of the suit\nand thereby maintains most of the adjustment made in\nthe length of the suit by spreading of the cord pair. To\nfurther shorten the suit the cinching process of pulling\noutward on the cord pair and then releasing them is repeated as many times as is required.\nThe tiedown mechanism of this invention also comprises a pair of release devices for relaxing the hold\nby the tiedown mechanism on the suit as would be neces-\n\n3,286,274\n\n4\nblock assembly and each includes a section of elastic\nsary, for instance, for resuming an erect stance from a\nrubber 31a, 32a, and 33a, respectively, the function of\nsitting or bending over position. One of the release\ndevices is operable to render the restraining cord clamp\nwhich will hereinafter be described.\ninoperative and the other release is operable to remove\nThe pulley block assembly 16 comprises a pair of\n1\nthe clamps from frictional engagement with the other 5 bracket members 41 and 42 which support the pulleys\ncords. If desired, the two release devices may be operof the assembly.

The web\nin alternate fashion and permit a step-by-step release of\nthe tiedown mechanism and a gradual lengthening of the\n43 of bracket 41 is provided at its lower end with an\naperture 49 for receiving a bolt 50 which supports a\nsuit.\npair of rollers or pulleys 51 and 52.

Consequently,\n1\na simple and efficient means of disengaging the tiedown\nthe cord 31 is adapted to move freely over the pulley 51\nbut in the direction opposite to the direction of free movemechanism from the suit.\nThe pulley block assembly 16 is also connected by\nmerit for the cord 32. Movement of the cord 31 to the\nnylon cords 31, 32, and 33 to an adapter 34 on one end 70 right causes the eccentric 61 to pivot clockwise wherein\nit will be disposed in unclamped relation to the cord 31\nof a strap 35 as best shown in FIG. 2. The strap 35 is\nalthough in frictional engagement with the cord. As\nsecured at its other end to the suit in the vicinity of the\ncrotch, but alternatively may be passed under the crotch\nshown in FIG. 7, however, movement of the cord 31 to\nthe left causes pivotal movement of the eccentric 41 in\nand attached to the back of the pressure suit. The cords\n31, 32, and 33 are each reeved over pulleys in the pulley 75 the counterclockwise direction which causes the eccentric\n\nto clamp the cord tightly against the pulley 51 and prevent further movement of the cord in this direction.\nTo insure that the eccentrics will be pivotally moved\nwhenever there is movement of the cords over the rollers,\neach eccentric is biased into strong frictional engagement\nwith its associated cord by a leaf spring, 69 and 70,\nrespectively. The spring 69 is attached at one end to the\nwall of the bracket web 43 and engages the top edge\nof the eccentric 61 to which it applies a biasing torque\nin the counterclockwise direction as seen in FIG. 6. In\nlike manner, the eccentric 62 is biased by a constant\ntorque in the clockwise direction as applied by the spring\n70 shown in FIG. 5 which is attached at one end to the\nweb section 46 of bracket 42 and engages the top edge\nof the eccentric 62.\nIt is to be understood, of course, that means other than\nthe leaf springs 69 and 70 might be employed for biasing\nthe eccentrics into frictional engagement with the cords.\nFor one example, an expansible single coil spring might\nbe utilized wherein the coil would lie constrained in a loop\nencircling the shank of the bolt 54 with one end of the\nspring attached near the peripheral margin of the eccentric\nwhich is of greatest radius and its other end to the wall of\nthe adjacent web structure. By its tendency to expand, the\nspring would exert a torque on the eccentric in the direction which would urge it into clamping engagement with\nthe cord.\nIt will therefore be seen, as is illustrated in FIG. 1\nthat by grasping the two cords 31 and 32 with the hands\nand spreading the cords in front of the chest, the two\ncords are pulled in the directions opposed to their directions of Iree movement. The cords will therefore be held\nclamped by the action of their associated eccentric clamps\nand an upward pull exerted on the crotch belt 35 and a\ndownward pull exerted on the rigid neck ring 14 which\ndraws the two together and thereby effectively shortens\nthe suit. Since the pull on the cords by the hands is\ndirected substantially perpendicularly to the extended\ncords, practically an infinite mechanical advantage is\ninitially attained which decreases as the cords are spread\nbut insures that little effort is required to operate the\nmechanism. This is particularly true in view of the fact\nthat the effort to spread the cords takes advantage of the\ntendency of the inflated suit to force the astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s arms\noutwardly in spread-eagle fashion from the body.\nIn fitting the tiedown mechanism to the suit, the cords\n31 and 32 are placed in tension whereby the elastic\nsections 31a and 32a of cords 31 and 32, respectively,\nfunction to maintain the cords taut while permitting variation in length. In each cord the elastic section is included\nnear one end adjacent the adapter 34 and is so located\nby the reeving arrangement of the cord over the pulley\nthat the constant pull which the elastic section exerts\non the cord is in the direction of its free movement over\nthe pulley. Hence, when the cords are released by the\nhands their elastic sections pull the cords over the pulleys\nand cause the cord-clamping eccentrics to pivot to their\nnon-clamping positions as shown in FIG. 6. When the\ncords are released, however, means in the form of a\nrestraining cord 33 is provided for maintaining the adjustment which has been made in the length of the suit by\nthe spreading of the cord pair.\nThe restraining cord 33 is reeved over a pulley 71 carried by the bracket 42 and is fastened at its ends to the\nadapter 34 of the crotch belt. The pulley 71 is adapted\nto rotate freely on the shank of a bolt 72 which extends\nthrough aligned apertures 73 and 74 in the sides of the\nbracket. Like the cords 31 and 32, the cord 33 is also\npermitted free movement in one direction over the pulley\nbut is limited in reverse movement by an associated\npivotal eccentric 76 which is normally maintained in frictional engagement with the cord.\nThe eccentric 76 which is identical in shape to the eccentrics 61 and 62, although slightly larger, is adapted\nto pivot on the shank of the bolt 77 which extends\n\n5\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n75\n\nthrough aligned elongate slots 78 and 79 in the bracket\nsides 47 and 48 and is supported directly above the pulley 71 but spaced a sufficient distance therefrom to permit\nthe passage of the cord 33 over the pulley. The eccentric\nis limited in its pivotal movement by a stop member 80\nwhich is secured to the flat edge of the eccentric in\ntransverse relation thereto and engages the edges 47a and\n48a of the bracket sides 47 and 48 for two pivotal positions of the eccentric. It is also biased into frictional engagement with the cord 33 by a resilient appendage 83\nwhich is attached to the eccentric and engages the edge\n47a of the bracket side 47.\nThe cord 33 is adapted to move freely over the pulley\n71 in the left direction as seen in FIG. 4. Movement\nof the cord 33 to the right, however, causes eccentric 76\nto pivot clockwise wherein it will be disposed to clamp\nthe cord tightly against the pulley and prevent further\nmovement of the cord in this direction. As the snit is\nshortened by spreading of the cords 31 and 32, the elastic\nsection 33a keeps the restraining cord taut and pulls it\nin free movement over the pulley 71 as the cord becomes\nshorter. However, when the cords 39 and 32 are released by the hands, the internal pressure of the inflated\nsuit causes an initial lengthening of the suit and the restraining cord which moves a limited distance over the\npulley 71 in the direction opposed to its direction of free\nmovement until it is clamped by pivotal movement of\nthe eccentric 76. This clamping action prevents any\nfurther movement of the restraining cord and lengthening of the suit and thereby maintains most of the adjustment made in the length of the suit by spreading of\nthe cords 31 and 32. To further shorten the suit, the\ncinching process of pulling outward on the cords 31 and\n32 and then releasing them is repeated as many times\nas is required.\nThe tiedown mechanism 12 also comprises a pair of\nrelease devices 91 and 92 which are operable to release\nor relax the hold by the tiedown mechanism on the suit.\nThis would be desirable, for instance, in order to resume\nan erect stance from a sitting or bending position. The\nrelease device 91 which is adapted to release the hold\nby cords 31 and 32 is a U-shaped member comprising\na central web section 93 with parallel extending arms 94\nand 95. The arms 94 and 99 are adapted to slide in\ngrooves 96 and 97 which are formed respectively in the\nweb sections 43 and 46 of the brackets 41 and 42. The\narms 94 and 95 are provided with caming surfaces 98\nand 99, respectively, which normally engage the shank\nof the bolt 54 as shown in FIG. 8 and hold the bolt in\nthe lower ends of the slots 53 and 63. In this position\nof the bolt the eccentrics 61 and 62 are maintained in\nstrong frictional engagement with the cords 31 and 32\nand will move pivotally in response to movement of the\ncords over the pulleys.\nThe release arms 94 and 95 are also provided with\nelongate grooves 101 and 102 formed in their upper surfaces in which coiled springs 103 and 104 are seated,\nrespectively. One end of the spring 103 engages a stop\nscrew 1Q5 which is threaded from the top surface of the\nbracket 41 to project downwardly into the groove 101.\nIn like manner a stop screw 106 is threaded from the top\nsurface of the eye 24 of the bracket 42 to project downwardly into the groove 102 where it is engageable by\nthe end of the spring 104. It will therefore be seen that\nthe release device 91 is biased outwardly of the pulley\nblock assembly by the action of the coiled springs 103\nand 104 against the stop screws 105 and 104 in which\nposition of the release device the bolt 54 is held cammed\nin the lower part of the slots 53 and 63. The stop screws\nare also engageable by the end walls PMa and 802a of\nthe grooves and thereby secure the release device to the\npulley block assembly. An ear 107 which protrudes from\nthe side of the bracket 41 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 7\nprovides support for the release 91 when it is in its normally biased extended position.\n\na\n\n,274\n3,286,\n\nThe arms 94 and 95 are also provided with notches\n\nor recesses 108 and 109 respectively in their lower surfaces adjacent the camming surfaces 98 and 99. Thus,\nby positioning the release 91 inwardly in the position\nshown in FIG. 9, the bolt 54 will move upwardly due 5\nto the expansion of the cords 31 and 32 into the recesses\nin the parallel arms whereby the eccentrics 61 and 62\nare either removed from engagement with the cords or so\nlightly engage the cords that they are rendered inoperative\nand will not pivot in response to movement of the cords. lo\nThe cords 31 and 32 are thereby adapted to move freely\nin both directions over the pulleys.\nThe release 92 which provides a means for releasing\nthe hold on the suit by the restraining cord 33 is in the\nform of a U-shaped member comprising a central web 15\nsection I11 and parallel arms 112 and 813. The arms\n112 and 113 are slidably seated in grooves 114 and\nI15 which are formed in the exterior walls of the sides\nof bracket 42. The release 92 is biased outwardly of the\npulley block assembly by means of a coiled spring 116 20\nsleeved within a pair of telescoping cylinders 117 and\n118. The cylinder 117 is provided with a screw 119 at\none end for attachment to the web section 46 of bracket\n42 and the cylinder 118 is similarly provided with a\nscrew 120 at one end for perpendicular attachment to 25\nthe central section 111 of the release 92. In the position of the release as biased by the spring 116, the shank\nof the bolt 72 and held in the lower ends of the slots 78\nand 79 by projecting camming surfaces 121 and I22 on\nthe undersides of the arms 112 and 113 as shown in 30\nFIG. 4. The release is secured to the pulley block assembly by stop screws 123 and 124 which are threaded\ninto bracket sides 47 and 48 and extend from their top\nsurfaces into the bracket grooves 114 and 115 where they\nare engageable by the end walls of grooves 125 and 126 35\nformed in the top surfaces of the release arms 112 and\n113, respectively.\nWhen the release is pushed inwardly, however, against\nthe action of the coiled spring 114, the shank of bolt 72\nis disengaged from the camming surfaces and due to 40\nthe expansion of the cord 33 moves upwardly in the slots\n78 and 79 into the recessed areas formed by the cut-away\nlower surfaces of the release arms 1112 and 113. In this\nposition of the bolt 72 the eccentric 76 is either removed\nfrom frictional engagement with the restraining cord 45\n33 or so lightly engages the cord that it will not pivot\nin response to movement of the cord which is then\nadapted to move freely over the pulley 71 in either direction.\nIt will therefore be seen that by operation of the re- 5o\nlease devices 91 and 92 the hold exercised by the tiedown\nmechanism on the suit may be relaxed. If desired, the\ntwo release devices may be operated simultaneously to\nrelease all of the cord clamping eccentrics and permit\nthe full lengthening of the inflated suit in only one opera- 55\ntion.\nIn most instances, however, for purposes of safety\nit would generally be desired to operate the two releases\nin alternate fashion. In this manner, for example, pushing the release 91 inwardly into the pulley block as- 6o\nsembly while leaving the release 92 in its normally\nbiased outward position, the cords 31 and 32 will be released for free movement, while the restraining cord\nwill be pulled over the pulley 71 by its elastic section 33a\nfor a limited distance until such time as the pivotal ec- 65\ncentric 76 clamps the cord against the pulley and prevents its further movement. By then permitting the\nrelease 91 to be biased to its normally outward position wherein the eccentrics 61 and 62 are again in operative condition and then releasing the restraining cord 33 *in\nI W\nby forcing the release 92 inwardly of the blockassembly,\nthe hold exerted by the tiedown mechanism will be released by a limited amount determined by the distance\nof movement of the cords 36. and 32 over their associated pulleys until clamped by the action of the eccentrics 75\n\n61 and 42. By repeating the process of alternately moving the release devices 98 and 92 inwardly of the pulley\nblock assembly, the hold exercised by the tiedown mechanism on suit will be be relaxed in a step by step manner.\nIt will therefore be seen that a novel pressure suit tiedown mechanism which may be operated by only a minimum effort of the suit wearer is described herein. The\nmechanism constitutes a reliable and safe means for preventing helmet rise when the suit is bent to conform to a\nsitting position and provides means for adjusting the torso\nlength of an inflated pressure suit to relieve the suit wearer\nof strain when in a position other than standing. Although the mechanism has been herein illustrated in operation with pressure suits and in particular a pressure\nsuit designed for astronauts, it may be used with other\ninflatable pressure suits such as those used by aviators and\nin other applications where it is desired to draw spaced\nobjects together. A variety of materials may, of course,\nbe used in the make-up of the components of the mechanism.
