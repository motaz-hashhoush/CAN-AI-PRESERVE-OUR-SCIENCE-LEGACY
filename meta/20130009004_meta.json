The reason, he explains, originates with a unique NASA mission from the late 1990s. In 1998, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft launched from Kennedy Space Center to test a dozen different space technologies, including SCARLET, or the Solar Concentrator Array with Refractive Linear Element Technology. As a solar array that focused sunlight on a smaller solar cell to generate electric power, SCARLET not only powered Deep Space 1 s instruments but also powered its ion engine, which propelled the spacecraft throughout its journey. Deep Space 1 was the first spacecraft powered by a refractive concentrator design like SCARLET, and also utilized multi-junction solar cells, or cells made of multiple layers of different materials. For the duration of its 38-month mission, SCARLET performed flawlessly, even as Deep Space 1 flew by Comet Borrelly and Asteroid Braille. \"Everyone remembers the ion engine on Deep Space 1, but they tend to forget that the SCARLET array powered it,\" says Piszczor. \"Not only did both technologies work as designed, but the synergy between the two, solar power and propulsion together, is really the important aspect of this technology demonstration mission. It was the first successful use of solar electric propulsion for primary propulsion.\" More than a decade later, NASA is keenly interested in using solar electric propulsion (SEP) for future space missions. A key issue is cost, and SEP has the potential to substantially reduce cost compared to conventional chemical propulsion technology. \"SEP allows you to use spacecraft that are smaller, lighter, and less costly,\" says Piszczor. \"Even though it might take longer to get somewhere using SEP, if you are willing to trade time for cost and smaller vehicles, it s a good trade.\" Potentially, SEP could be used on future science missions in orbit around the Earth or Moon, to planets or asteroids, on deep space science missions, and even on exploration missions. In fact, electric propulsion is already being used on Earth-orbiting satellites for positioning.", "title": "Concentrators Enhance Solar Power Systems", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-27T11:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20130009004, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009004, "id": "45f677bdc74c48c7a480a1180e8a681a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2012", "publicationDate": "2013-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130009003, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130009004.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130009004/downloads/20130009004.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130009004/downloads/20130009004.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130009004/downloads/20130009004.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
