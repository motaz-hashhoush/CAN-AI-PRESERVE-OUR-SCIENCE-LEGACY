The lithium-ion cell\ncharge-control unit will be useful to anyone who performs testing of battery cells\nfor aerospace and non-aerospace uses\nand to anyone who manufacturers battery test equipment. This technology reduces the quantity of costly power supplies and independent channels that are\nneeded for test programs in which multiple cells are tested. The cost savings\nthat were achieved in a test program are\nshown in Figure 1. Battery test equipment manufacturers can integrate the\ntechnology into their battery test equipment as a method to manage charging\nof multiple cells in series.\nThe unit manages a complex scheme\nthat is required for charging Li-ion cells\nelectrically connected in series. The unit\nmakes it possible to evaluate cells together as a pack using a single primary\ntest channel, while also making it possible to charge each cell individually.\nHence, inherent cell-to-cell variations in\na series string of cells can be addressed,\nand yet the cost of testing is reduced substantially below the cost of testing each\ncell as a separate entity.\nIn the original aerospace application,\nlife-test data on Li-ion cells is critical in\norder to assess their performances and\ncapabilities relevant to NASA missions\nand exploration goals. For example, for\nmany NASA missions that involve flight\nin low orbits around the Earth, batteries\nare required to endure more than\n30,000 charge/discharge cycles, and Liion batteries are relatively new to this\ntype of application. The scheme required for charging Li-ion cells is more\ncomplex than that typically required for\ncharging the alkaline cells that the Liion cells may supplant. This scheme includes the establishment and enforcement of strict cell voltage limits to\nensure safe, long operation.\nSo that this requirement could be addressed in laboratory testing, the present charge-control unit was developed\nto manage the current through each\n\n2.8\n2.5\n\n70\n\nTime, Minutes\n\n\xe2\x80\x9310\n\xe2\x80\x9315\n\xe2\x80\x9320\n\xe2\x80\x9325\n\xe2\x80\x9330\n\xe2\x80\x9335\n\xe2\x80\x9340\n\xe2\x80\x9345\n\xe2\x80\x9350\n\nFigure 2.

By use of this\nunit, multiple Li-ion cells connected in\nseries within a battery pack can be\ncharged from a single current source,\nand yet the charging of each cell is controlled independently of the other\ncells. More specifically, by use of\nthis unit:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Each cell in the series string is charged\nat full current until the cell voltage\nreaches the limit;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Once the voltage of a given cell\nreaches the limit, the voltage is held at\nthat limit and the current through that\ncell is tapered off so that the cell continues to gain some charge without becoming overcharged; and\n\nPage 6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Even after some cells have reached\nvoltage limit, other cells that are at\nlower states of charge continue to be\ncharged at full current until they reach\nthe voltage limit (see Figure 2).\nThe unit consists of electronic circuits\nand thermal-management devices\nhoused in a common package. It also includes isolated annunciators to signal\nwhen the cells are being actively bypassed. These annunciators can be used\nby external charge managers or can be\nconnected in series to signal that all cells\nhave reached maximum charge. The\ncharge-control circuitry for each cell\namounts to regulator circuitry and is\npowered by that cell, eliminating the\nneed for an external power source or\n\ncontroller. A 110-VAC source of electricity is required to power the thermalmanagement portion of the unit. A\nsmall direct-current source can be used\nto supply power for an annunciator signal, if desired.\nThis work was done by Concha M. Reid,\nMichelle A. Manzo, and Robert M.

Refer to\nLEW-17703-1.\n\nMeasuring Positions of Objects Using Two or More Cameras\nThis method could determine the causes of accidents.\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAn improved method of computing\npositions of objects from digitized images\nacquired by two or more cameras (see figure) has been developed for use in tracking debris shed by a spacecraft during\nand shortly after launch. The method is\nalso readily adaptable to such applications as (1) tracking moving and possibly\ninteracting objects in other settings in\norder to determine causes of accidents\nand (2) measuring positions of stationary\nobjects, as in surveying. Images acquired\nby cameras fixed to the ground and/or\ncameras mounted on tracking telescopes\ncan be used in this method.\nIn this method, processing of image\ndata starts with creation of detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models of the\nobjects to be tracked. By rotating, translating, resizing, and overlaying the models\nwith digitized camera images, parameters\nthat characterize the position and orientation of the camera can be determined.\nThe final position error depends on how\nwell the centroids of the objects in the images are measured; how accurately the\ncentroids are interpolated for synchronization of cameras; and how effectively\nmatches are made to determine rotation,\nscaling, and translation parameters.\nThe method involves use of the perspective camera model (also denoted\nthe point camera model), which is one\nof several mathematical models developed over the years to represent the relationships between external coordinates of objects and the coordinates of\n\n6\n\nKnown\nObject\n\nUnknown\nObject\n\ny\n\nz\nx\n\nCamera 2\nCamera 1\n\nTwo Cameras Are Aimed at a pair of possibly moving objects, at least one of which is known. The positions and orientations of the cameras relative to the known object need not be known initially: instead, they are determined by means of photogrammetric computations.\nK\n\nthe objects as they appear on the image\nplane in a camera. The point camera\nmodel is implemented in a commercially available software system for threedimensional graphics and animation\nused in television, film, industrial design, architecture, and medical imaging.\nThe method also involves extensive use\nof the affine camera model, in which the\ndistance from the camera to an object (or\n\nto a small feature on an object) is assumed to be much greater than the size\nof the object (or feature), resulting in a\ntruly two-dimensional image. Using a\ntechnique common in photogrammetry\nas practiced in aerial surveying, depth information is obtained from a combination of image data acquired from two or\nmore cameras. Synchronized image data\nfrom two or more cameras are combined\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nfollowing an error-minimization approach. Precise measurements are obtained by synchronizing data by use of linear interpolation and a dual-camera\ntrajectory solution. Velocities of objects\nare also estimated in this model.\nThe affine camera model does not require advance knowledge of the positions and orientations of the cameras.\nThis is because ultimately, positions and\norientations of the cameras and of all\n\nPage 7\n\nobjects are computed in a coordinate\nsystem attached to one object as defined\nin its CAD model.\nInitially, the software developed to solve\nthe equations of the affine camera model\nimplemented a gradient-descent algorithm for finding a solution of a matrix .\nvector equation that minimizes an error\nfunction. Whereas photogrammetric\nanalyses typically entailed weeks of measurements and computations to obtain ac-\n\ncurate results from a given set of images,\nthis software yielded solutions in times of\nthe order of minutes. A more recent version of the software solves the affine-camera-model equations directly by means of\na matrix inversion in a typical computation time of the order of a second.\nThis work was done by Steve Klinko, John\nLane, and Christopher Nelson of ASRC\nAerospace for Kennedy Space Center.\nKSC-12665/3/705\n\nLidar System for Airborne Measurement of Clouds and Aerosols\nThis is an eye-safe, rugged, all-solid-state system.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThe figure schematically depicts a lidar\nsystem for measuring optical properties\nof clouds and aerosols at three wavelengths. The system is designed to be operated aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft,\nwhich typically cruises at an altitude of\nabout 20 km \xe2\x80\x94 above about 94 percent\nof the mass of the atmosphere. The sys-\n\ntem can also be operated aboard several\nother aircraft, and a version for use on\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is\npresently under construction. In addition\nto the requirement for fully autonomous\noperation in a demanding airborne environment, three other main requirements\nhave governed the design: (1) to make\n\nthe system eye-safe at the operating altitude; (2) to make the system as lightweight as possible, yet rugged; and (3) to\nuse solid-state photon-counting detectors\nfiber-coupled to the receiver.\nThe laser transmitter is based on a\nNd:YVO4 laser crystal pumped by light\ncoupled to the crystal via optical fibers\n\nOff-Axis\nParaboloidal\nMirror\n\nMirror\n\nIntegrating\nSphere\nLenses\nLaser\n\nFiber Optic to\n355-nm Photodetector\nMirror\nHalf-Wave\nPlate\n\nDichroic\nMirrors\nLenses\n\nMirror\n\nFiber Optic to\nPolarizing\n1064-nm Photodetector\nBeam Splitters\nfor Perpendicular\nPolarization\n\nInterference\nFilters\nFiber Optic to\n1064-nm Photodetector\nfor Parallel Polarization\n\nMirror\n\nFiber Optic to\n532-nm Photodetector\n\nThis Simplified Optical Layout (not to scale) shows the main optical components of a lidar system designed for measuring selected optical properties of\nclouds and aerosols at three wavelengths.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\n7\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nfrom laser diodes that are located away\nfrom the crystal to aid in dissipating the\nheat generated in the diodes and their\ndrive circuits. The output of the\nNd:YVO4 crystal has a wavelength of\n1064 nm, and is made to pass through\nfrequency-doubling and frequencytripling crystals. As a result, the net laser\noutput is a collinear superposition of\nbeams at wavelengths of 1064, 532, and\n355 nm.\nThe laser operates at a pulse-repetition rate of 5 kHz, emitting per-pulse energies of 50 \xc2\xb5J at 1064 nm, 25 \xc2\xb5J at 532\nnm, and 50 \xc2\xb5J at 355 nm. The transmitted laser beam and the returning laser\nlight backscattered from atmospheric\naerosols and molecules pass through a\ntelescope, the primary optical element\nof which is an off-axis parabolic mirror\nhaving an aperture diameter of 20 cm.\nThe combination of the off-axis arrangement and other features is such that\nnone of the transmitting aperture is obscured and only about 20 percent of the\nreceiving aperture is obscured.\nThe returning light collected by the\ntelescope is separated into wavelength\ncomponents by use of dichroics and nar-\n\nPage 8\n\nrowband interference filters suppress\nsolar background. The 1064-nm signal is\nfurther separated into parallel and perpendicular polarization components. A\nhalf-wave plate is inserted in the 1064nm path to enable calibration of the parallel- and perpendicular-polarization\nchannels. Each resulting output wavelength component is coupled via an optical fiber to a photodetector.\nAn important feature of this system is\nan integrating sphere located between\nthe laser output and the laser beam expander lenses. The integrating sphere collects light scattered from the lenses.\nThree energy-monitor detectors are located at ports inside the integrating\nsphere. Each of these detectors is\nequipped with filters such that the laser\noutput energy is measured independently\nfor each wavelength. The laser output energy is measured on each pulse to enable\nthe most accurate calibration possible.\nThe 1064-nm and 532-nm photodetectors are, more specifically, singlephoton-counting modules (SPCMs).\nWhen used at 1064 nm, these detectors\nhave approximately 3 percent quantum\nefficiency and low thermal noise (fewer\n\nthan 200 counts per second). When\nused at 532 nm, the SPCMs have quantum efficiency of about 60 percent. The\nphotodetector for the 355-nm channel\nis a photon-counting photomultiplier\ntube having a quantum efficiency of\nabout 20 percent.\nThe use of photon-counting detectors\nis made feasible by the low laser pulse\nenergy. The main advantage of photoncounting (in contradistinction to processing of analog photodetector outputs) is ease of inversion of data without\nneed for complicated calibration\nschemes like those necessary for analog\ndetectors. The disadvantage of photoncounting detectors is that they inherently have narrow dynamic ranges. However, by using photon-counting\ndetectors along with a high-repetitionrate laser, it is possible to obtain wide dynamic range through accumulation of\ncounts over many pulses.\nThis work was done by Matthew McGill\nand V.

GSC-14985-1\n\nRadiation-Insensitive Inverse Majority Gates\nThese gates would be implemented as microscopic vacuum electronic devices.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nTo help satisfy a need for high-density\nlogic circuits insensitive to radiation, it\nhas been proposed to realize inverse majority gates as microscopic vacuum electronic devices. In comparison with solidstate electronic devices ordinarily used\nin logic circuits, vacuum electronic devices are inherently much less adversely\naffected by radiation and extreme temperatures.\nThe proposed development would involve state-of-the-art micromachining\nand recent advances in the fabrication\nof carbon-nanotube-based field emitters.\nA representative three-input inverse majority gate (see figure) would be a monolithic, integrated structure that would include three gate electrodes, six bundles\nof carbon nanotubes (serving as electron emitters) at suitable positions between the gate electrodes, and an overhanging anode. The bundles of carbon\nnanotubes would be grown on degenerately doped silicon substrates that would\nbe parts of the monolithic structure.\nThe gate electrodes would be fabricated\n\n8\n\nAnode\n\nBundles of\nCarbon Nanotubes\n\nGate\nElectrode 1\n\nGate\nElectrode 3\nGate\nElectrode 2\n\nA Three-Input Inverse Majority Gate as proposed would be a microscopic vacuum electronic device\ncontaining bundles of carbon nanotubes positioned between gate electrodes to obtain controlled\nfield emission of electrons from the bundles. In the presence of a fixed positive bias potential on the\nanode, the application of suitable (possibly smaller) bias potential to any two or all three gate electrodes would divert all the electron current from the anode.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nas parts of the monolithic structure by\nmeans of a double-silicon-on-insulator\nprocess developed at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The tops of the bundles\nof carbon nanotubes would lie below the\nplane of the tops of the gate electrodes.\nThe particular choice of shapes, dimensions, and relative positions of the electrodes and bundles of carbon nanotubes\nwould provide for both field emission of\nelectrons from the bundles of carbon\nnanotubes and control of the electron\ncurrent to obtain the inverse majority\nfunction, as described next.\nThe application of a positive bias potential to the anode would cause emission of electrons from the bundles of\ncarbon nanotubes and, if no bias potential were applied to the gate electrodes,\nthe electrons would travel to the anode,\ngiving rise to an anode current. Relative\nto the anode, the gate electrodes would\nbe much closer to the bundles of carbon\nnanotubes, such that the application of a\nsmaller positive bias potential to a gate\n\nPage 9\n\nelectrode would suffice to divert, to that\nelectrode, the electrons emitted by the\nadjacent bundles of carbon nanotubes.\nIf the positive bias potential were not\napplied to another gate electrode, then\nthe anode would continue to draw an\nelectron current from the bundles of\ncarbon nanotubes not adjacent to the\npositively biased gate electrode. However, if the positive bias potential were\napplied to any two or all three of the\ngate electrodes, then all of the electrons\nemitted by all the bundles of carbon\nnanotubes would be diverted to the positively biased gate electrodes, causing\nthe anode current to fall to zero. In\nterms of binary logic, if one regards\nnonzero anode current as representing\noutput state 1, zero anode current as\nrepresenting output state 0, positive\ngate-electrode bias as representing\ninput state 1, and zero gate-electrode\nbias as representing input state 0, then\nlogical 0 inputs to two or all three of\ngate terminals would result in output of\n\nlogical 1, and logical 1 inputs to two or\nall three of the gate terminals would result in output of logical 0. This relationship among input and output states constitutes a NAND and a NOR gate\ncombination. This is the inverse majority function.\nThis work was done by Harish Manohara\nand Mohammad Mojarradi of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

As used here, \xe2\x80\x9crelative measurements\xe2\x80\x9d signifies measurements that\nyield information on the relationship between a later and an earlier state of the\nsystem. An important example of relative measurements arises in computer vision: Information on relative motion is\nextracted by comparing images taken at\ntwo different times.\nRelative measurements do not directly\nfit into standard Kalman filter theory, in\nwhich measurements are restricted to\nthose indicative of only the current state\nof the system. One approach heretofore\nfollowed in utilizing relative measurements in Kalman filtering, denoted state\naugmentation, involves augmenting the\nstate of the system at the earlier of two\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\ntime instants and then propagating the\nstate to the later time instant. While state\naugmentation is conceptually simple, it\ncan also be computationally prohibitive\nbecause it doubles the number of states\nin the Kalman filter.\nIn many practical applications, relative measurements are not functions of\nentire earlier states but rather may be a\nfunction of only a subset of elements of\nthe earlier state. A relative measurement that can be thus characterized is\ndenoted a partial relative measurement. For example, in computer vision,\nrelative-measurement information is\nusually a function of position rather\nthan velocity, acceleration, or other elements of the state.\nWhen processing a relative measurement, if one were to follow the stateaugmentation approach as practiced\nheretofore, one would find it necessary\nto propagate the full augmented state\n\nKalman filter from the earlier time to\nthe later time and then select out the\nreduced-order components. The main\nresult of the study reported here is\nproof of a property called reducedorder equivalence (ROE). The main\nconsequence of ROE is that it is not\nnecessary to augment with the full state,\nbut, rather, only the portion of the state\nthat is explicitly used in the partial relative measurement.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAn improved self-validating thermocouple (SVT) instrumentation system\nnot only acquires readings from a thermocouple but is also capable of detecting deterioration and a variety of discrete faults in the thermocouple and its\nlead wires. Prime examples of detectable\ndiscrete faults and deterioration include\nopen- and short-circuit conditions and\ndebonding of the thermocouple junction from the object, the temperature of\nwhich one seeks to measure. Debonding\nis the most common cause of errors in\nthermocouple measurements, but most\nprior SVT instrumentation systems have\nnot been capable of detecting debonding.\nThe improved SVT instrumentation\nsystem includes power circuitry, a coldjunction compensator, signal-conditioning circuitry, pulse-width-modulation\n(PWM) thermocouple-excitation circuitry, an analog-to-digital converter\n(ADC), a digital data processor, and a\nuniversal serial bus (USB) interface.

The characteristic time or rate of\nincrease in temperature during the excitation is analyzed by the processor as an\nindication of the integrity of the thermocouple.

Traditionally, the\nRGB color-separation problem in an\nelectronic camera has been solved by\nuse of either (1) fixed color filters over\nthree separate image detectors; (2) a filter wheel that repeatedly imposes a red,\nthen a green, then a blue filter over a\nsingle image detector; or (3) different\n\nfixed color filters over adjacent pixels.\nThe use of separate image detectors necessitates precise registration of the detectors and the use of complicated optics; filter wheels are expensive and add\nconsiderably to the bulk of the camera;\nand fixed pixelated color filters reduce\nspatial resolution and introduce coloraliasing effects. The proposed chromatic\nmodulator would not exhibit any of\nthese shortcomings.\nThe proposed chromatic modulator\nwould be an electromechanical device\nfabricated by micromachining.

At each filter position, each detector pixel would thus acquire information on the local brightness in the momentarily selected color. The frequency\nof actuation of the comb drive would be\nthree times the frame rate of the camera, so that over one frame period, each\npixel would acquire full color information.

Short\nbackfire antennas are widely used in\nmobile/satellite\ncommunications,\n\ntracking, telemetry, and wireless local\narea networks because of their compactness and excellent radiation characteristics.\nA typical prior short backfire antenna\ncontains a half-wavelength dipole excitation element for linear polarization\nor crossed half-wavelength dipole eleSubreflector Disk\n\nCup\n\nSix-Post Polarizer\n(Posts Oriented at 45\xc2\xb0\nto Page, at Diametrically\nOpposite Locations)\nCoaxial\nPort 1\n\nSeptum Plate\nCoaxial\nPort 2\n\nThe Cup Cylindrical Waveguide Antenna features a compact combination of a polarizer and an orthomode transducer with two coaxial ports integrated into a circular waveguide.\n\n14\n\nments for circular polarization. In\norder to achieve simultaneous dual circular polarization, it would be necessary to integrate, into the antenna feed\nstructure, a network of hybrid components, which would introduce significant losses. The CCWA embodies an alternate approach that entails relatively\nlow losses and affords the additional advantage of compactness.\nThe CCWA (see figure) includes a circular cylindrical cup, a circular disk subreflector, and a circular waveguide that\nserves as the excitation element. The\ncomponents that make it possible to obtain simultaneous dual circular polarization are integrated into the circular\nwaveguide. These components are a sixpost polarizer and an orthomode transducer (OMT) with two orthogonal coaxial ports. The overall length of the OMT\nand polarizer (for the nominal middle\ndesign frequency of 2.25 GHz) is about\n11 in.

Prior to this automated tool,\nthis analysis was done manually with\nExcel and the UNIX command line. In\ntotal, the process would take approximately 30 minutes for each analysis. The\ncurrent automated analysis takes less\nthan 30 seconds.\nThis tool resides on the flight machine and uses a PHP interface that does\nthe entire analysis of the input files and\ntakes into account one-way light time\nfrom another input file. Input flies are\ncopied over to the proper directories\nand are dynamically read into the tool\xe2\x80\x99s\ninterface. The user can then choose the\ncorresponding input files based on the\ntime frame desired for analysis. After\nsubmission of the Web form, the tool\nmerges the two files into a single, timeordered listing of events for both spacecraft. The times are converted to the\nsame reference time (Earth Transmit\nTime) by reading in a light time file and\nperforming the calculations necessary to\nshift the time formats. The program also\nhas the ability to vary the size of the\nkeep-out window on the main page of\nthe analysis tool by inputting a custom\ntime for padding each MRO event time.\nThe parameters on the form are read in\n\n16\n\nPage 16\n\nand passed to the second page for analysis. Everything is fully coded in PHP and\ncan be accessed by anyone with access to\nthe machine via Web page.\nThis uplink tool will continue to be\nused for the duration of the MER mission\xe2\x80\x99s needs for X-band uplinks. Future\nmissions also can use the tools to check\noverflight times as well as potential site\nobservation times.

The software is written\nin Matlab and interfaces with G-OPT, a\nJPL-developed optimization package written in C that provides G-Guidance with\nguaranteed convergence to a solution in a\nfinite computation time with a prescribed\naccuracy. The resulting program is computationally efficient and is a prototype of an\nonboard, real-time algorithm for autonomous guidance and control.\nTwo thruster firing schemes are available in G-Guidance, allowing tailoring of\nthe software for specific mission maneuvers. For example, descent, landing, or\nrendezvous benefit from a thruster firing\nat the maneuver termination to mitigate\nvelocity errors. Conversely, ascent or separation maneuvers benefit from an immediate firing to avoid potential drift toward\na second body. The guidance portion of\nthis software explicitly enforces user-defined control constraints and thruster silence times while minimizing total fuel\nusage.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nThis program is currently specialized\nto small-body proximity operations, but\nthe underlying method can be generalized to other applications.\nThis program was written by Beh\xc3\xa7et\nA\xc3\xa7ikmese, John Carson, and Linh Phan of\n\xc2\xb8\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

It allows\nclients to issue scheduling, conflict identification, conflict resolution, and status\nrequests in XML over a Java Message\nService interface. The scheduling requests may include new requirements\nthat represent a set of tracks to be scheduled under some constraints. This program uses a heuristic local search to\nschedule a variety of schedule requirements, and is being infused into the Service Scheduling Assembly, a mixed-initiative scheduling application.\nThe engine resolves conflicting schedules of resource allocation according to a\nrange of existing and possible requirement\nspecifications, including optional antennas;\nstart of track and track duration ranges; periodic tracks; locks on track start, duration,\nand allocated antenna; MSPA (multiple\nspacecraft per aperture); arraying/VLBI\n(very long baseline interferometry)/delta\nDOR (differential one-way ranging); continuous tracks; segmented tracks; gap-totrack ratio; and override or block-out of requirements. The scheduling models now\ninclude conflict identification for SOA (start\nof activity), BOT (beginning of track), RFI\n(radio frequency interference), and equipment constraints. This software will search\nthrough all possible allocations while providing a best-effort solution at any time.\nThe engine reschedules to accommodate individual emergency tracks in 0.2\nsecond, and emergency antenna downtime in 0.2 second. The software handles\ndoubling of one mission\xe2\x80\x99s track requests\nover one week (to 42 total) in 2.7 seconds.\nFurther tests will be performed in the context of actual schedules.\nThis program was written by Bradley Clement,\nMark Johnston, Allan Wax, and Caroline\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nPage 17\n\nChouinard of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

What makes\nthis possible is a micromachining process\nthat involves the use of microlithographic\ntechniques. This micromachining process\nsupplants a prior machine-shop process.\nIn the specific application that gave rise\nto this development, there is a requirement\nto make imaging-spectrometer slits 27 \xc2\xb5m\nwide and 1.7 cm long. In the prior machineshop process, the slits were formed by electrical-discharge machining (EDM). The slit\nwidths could not be maintained accurate to\nwithin less than about 12 \xc2\xb5m, and there was\nsome long-range drift over the 1.7-cm slit\nlengths. The present micromachining\nprocess affords about 100\xc3\x97 the precision of\nthe EDM process, with corresponding reductions in the tolerances for slit-width\nerror and long-range drift.\n\nAn overview of the micromachining\nprocess for fabricating slits consists of\nthe following steps:\n1. Grow low-stress silicon nitride via lowpressure chemical vapor deposition\n(LPCVD) on both sides of a silicon wafer.\n2. In a photolithographic subprocess,\nspin the front-side silicon nitride\ncoated wafer with a photoresist, expose the photoresist through an optical mask to define the opening to be\nformed, and develop the photoresist\nto transfer the pattern into the resist.\n3. Transfer the photoresist pattern via a\ndry etch, such as a reactive ion etcher\n(RIE), through the exposed nitride.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 on the backside\nof the wafer with a pattern to define\nthe opening for the nitride window.\n5. Etch through the exposed silicon\nusing an aqueous solution of potas-\n\nsium hydroxide or another suitable\nstrong base.\n6. Deposit an opaque, low-stress layer of\na suitable metal (e.g., titanium/gold)\non both sides.\nThis work was done by Daniel Wilson,\nJames Kenny, and Victor White of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

This process is expected to be a\nbasis for development of other, similar\nnanofabrication processes for relatively inexpensive mass production of nanometerscale optical, optoelectronic, electronic,\nand magnetic devices.\nAlumina nanopore templates are self-organized structures that result from anodization of aluminum under appropriate conditions. Alumina nanopore templates have\nbeen regarded as attractive for use in fabricating the devices mentioned above, but\nprior efforts to use alumina nanopore templates for this purpose have not been suc-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\ncessful. One reason for the lack of success is\nthat the aspect ratios (ratios between depth\nand diameter) of the pores have been too\nlarge: large aspect ratios can result in blockage of deposition and/or can prevent successful lift-off. The development of the\npresent process was motivated partly by a\nrequirement to reduce aspect ratios to values (of the order of 10) for which there is\nlittle or no blockage of deposition and attempts at lift-off are more likely to be successful.\nThe process consists mainly of the following steps:\n1. The substrate is cleaned by use of solvents and acids in a subprocess known\nin the art as Shiraki cleaning.\n2. By use of electron-beam evaporation at\na deposition rate of 0.5 nm/s, a layer of\nchromium is deposited to a thickness of\n5 nm thick on a silicon substrate and\nthen an aluminum layer 0.4 \xc2\xb5m thick,\nconsisting of grains smaller than 0.1\n\n\xc2\xb5m, is deposited on the chromium\nlayer. Smallness of the aluminum grains\nis essential for success.\n3. The aluminum layer is anodized at a\npotential of 10 V in sulfuric acid at a\nconcentration of 0.1 M. The potential\nof 10 V is considered to be low in the\nanodization art and results in slow anodization, but the slowness of the anodization is also essential for success.\n4. Pores are widened and alumina barrier\nlayers removed by use of phosphoric acid\nat a concentration of 5 volume percent.\n5. The nanodot material is deposited by\nuse of electron-beam evaporation.\n6. The alumina template is lifted off by\nuse of a solution of sodium hydroxide\nat a concentration of 1 M.\nThis work was done by Eui-Hyeok Yang,\nChristopher R. Ramsey, Youngsam Bae, and\nDaniel S.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA method for automated fabrication of\nflexible, electrically conductive patterns\non cloth substrates has been demonstrated. Products developed using this\nmethod, or related prior methods, are instances of a technology known as \xe2\x80\x9ce-textiles,\xe2\x80\x9d in which electrically conductive patterns are formed in, and on, textiles. For\nmany applications, including high-speed\ndigital circuits, antennas, and radio frequency (RF) circuits, an e-textile method\nshould be capable of providing high surface conductivity, tight tolerances for control of characteristic impedances, and geometrically complex conductive patterns.\nUnlike prior methods, the present\nmethod satisfies all three of these criteria.\nTypical patterns can include such circuit\nstructures as RF transmission lines, antennas, filters, and other conductive patterns\nequivalent to those of conventional\nprinted circuits.\nE-textiles of various forms have previously been demonstrated, but have typically been hindered by one or more\nshortfalls. For example, geometrically\ncomplex antennas have revealed performance levels that are indistinguish-\n\n20\n\nable from identical designs on conventional materials. However, construction\nof the complex geometrical patterns has\noften been laborious, involving handstitching. Another automated method\nfor e-textiles circuit construction uses\nconductive threads in an embroidery\nprocess. However, the embroidered\nconductive threads do not provide sufficient surface conductivity for many\nhigh-speed digital and RF applications.\nFurthermore, some studies have indicated that the conductive embroidery\nthreads are more subject to breaking\nthan conventional non-conductive embroidery thread.\nThe present method overcomes the\nlimitations of the prior methods for\nforming the equivalent of printed circuits on cloth. A typical fabrication\nprocess according to the present\nmethod involves selecting the appropriate conductive and non-conductive fabric layers to build the e-textile circuit.\nThe present method uses commercially\navailable woven conductive cloth with established surface conductivity specifications. Dielectric constant, loss tangent,\n\nand thickness are some of the parameters to be considered for the non-conductive fabric layers. The circuit design\nof the conductive woven fabric is secured onto a non-conductive fabric layer\nusing sewing, embroidery, and/or adhesive means. The portion of the conductive fabric that is not part of the circuit is\nnext cut from the desired circuit using\nan automated machine such as a\nprinted-circuit-board milling machine\nor a laser cutting machine. Fiducials can\nbe used to align the circuit and the cutting machine. Multilayer circuits can be\nbuilt starting with the inner layer and\nusing conductive thread to make electrical connections between layers.\nThis work was done by Andrew Chu, Patrick\nW.

Most previously reported SO2 sensors cannot detect SO2 at concentrations\nbelow tens of ppm; only a few can detect\nSO2 at 1 ppm. Most of the sensory materials\nused in those sensors (especially inorganic\nones that include solid oxide electrolytes,\nmetal oxides, and cadmium sulfide) must\nbe used under relatively harsh conditions\nthat include operation and regeneration at\ntemperatures >100 \xc2\xb0C. In contrast, the present films can be used to detect 1 ppm of\nSO2 at typical operating temperatures between 28 and 32 \xc2\xb0C and can be regenerated\nat temperatures between 36 and 40 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe basic concept of making sensing\nfilms from polymer/carbon composites\nis not new. The novelty of the present\nfamily of polymer/carbon composites\nlies in formulating the polymer components of these composites specifically to\noptimize their properties for detecting\nSO2. First-principles quantum-mechanical calculations of the energies of binding of SO2 molecules to various polymer functionalities are used as a guide\nfor selecting polymers and understanding the role of polymer functionalities\nin sensing.\n\nCH2\n\nCH\n\nn\n\nCH2\n\nCH\n+\n\nm\nN\n\nCH2-CH2-CH2-NH2\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nCI\n\nThis Copolymer is a member of the family of polymers suitable for use as components of polymer/carbon\ncomposite films for sensing SO2. The integers m and n can be chosen by formulation to be in a desired\nratio: a typical ratio for the molecular structure shown here is n/m = 3/7.\n\nThe polymer used in the polymer-carbon composite is a copolymer of styrene\nderivative units with vinyl pyridine or\nsubstituted vinyl pyridine derivative\nunits (see figure). To make a substituted\nvinyl pyridine for use in synthesizing\nsuch a polymer, poly(2-vinyl pyridine)\nthat has been dissolved in methanol is\nreacted with 3-chloropropylamine that\nhas been dissolved in a solution of\nmethanol.

Nickel alloy 718 is the most widely\nused superalloy. It has excellent strength\nand resistance to corrosion as well as acceptably high ductility, and is recognized as\nthe best alloy for many high-temperature\napplications. However, nickel alloy 718 is\nsusceptible to embrittlement by hydrogen\nand to delayed failure and reduced tensile\nproperties in gaseous hydrogen.

Such passivation could en-\n\nable the construction and operation of\nhigh-performance, long-life lithiumbased rechargeable electrochemical\ncells containing metallic lithium anodes.\nThe advantage of this approach, in com-\n\nparison with a possible alternative approach utilizing lithium-ion graphitic\nanodes, is that metallic lithium anodes\ncould afford significantly greater energystorage densities.\n\nThe Dark Strip in the Upper Photograph is the product of the chemical reaction of a deposited lithium film and an underlying solid-electrolyte plate. The\ncorresponding somewhat shiny strip in the lower photograph is a lithium film deposited on a solid-electrolyte plate coated with LiPON. The dark spots in\nthe Li film contain the reaction product formed at pinholes in the LiPON, where the Li film came into contact with the underlying solid electrolyte. This illustrates the importance of depositing pinhole-free LiPON films to protect solid-electrolyte plates.\n\n22\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nA major impediment to the development of such cells has been the fact\nthat the available solid electrolytes having the requisite high Li+-ion conductivity are too highly chemically reactive\nwith metallic lithium to be useful, while\nthose solid electrolytes that do not\nreact excessively with metallic lithium\nhave conductivities too low to be useful. The present passivation method exploits the best features of both extremes\nof\nthe\nsolid-electrolyte\nspectrum. The basic idea is to coat a\nhigher-conductivity, higher-reactivity\nsolid electrolyte with a lower-conductivity, lower-reactivity solid electrolyte.\nOne can then safely deposit metallic\nlithium in contact with the lower-reactivity solid electrolyte without incurring\nthe undesired chemical reactions. The\nthickness of the lower-reactivity electrolyte must be great enough to afford\nthe desired passivation but not so great\nas to contribute excessively to the electrical resistance of the cell.\n\nPage 23\n\nThe feasibility of this method was\ndemonstrated in experiments on plates of\na commercial high-performance solid Li+conducting electrolyte, the composition of\nwhich was not disclosed at the time of reporting the information for this article.\nThe lower-conductivity, lower-reactivity\nsolid electrolyte used for passivation was\nlithium phosphorus oxynitride (commonly abbreviated \xe2\x80\x9cLiPON\xe2\x80\x9d but more precisely abbreviated LixPOyNz, where x, y,\nand z denote numbers that can differ from\n1). The solid-electrolyte plates were 50.8mm square with a thickness of 0.47 mm.\nFilms of Li3.3PO3.8N0.22 having thicknesses\nof the order of 1 \xc2\xb5m were deposited on\nthe plates by radio-frequency magnetron\nsputtering from an Li3PO4 target in an atmosphere of N2. Pt and Cu electrodes\nwere sputtered through a metal shadow\nmask, and the active lithium anode material was deposited by thermal evaporation\nthrough the same mask.\nFor comparison, some plates were\nnot coated with LiPON and Li was de-\n\nposited directly on them. In those\ncases, the deposited Li metal reacted\nimmediately with the plates to form\ndark nonmetallic layers (see upper part\nof figure) that were electrically nonconductive. In contrast, for the plates that\nwere first coated with LiPON and then\nwith Li, films retained their metallic luster (see lower part of figure) and remained electrically conductive. Test\ncells containing Li anodes on LiPONcoated plates were constructed and\ntested by electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.\nThe coated solid-electrolyte plates were\nfound to support electrochemical plating and stripping of Li metal.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nOrganic/inorganic polymeric composite materials have been invented\nwith significant reduction in heat-transfer properties. Measured decreases of\n20\xe2\x80\x9350 percent in thermal conductivity\nversus that of the unmodified polymer\nmatrix have been attained. These novel\ncomposite materials also maintain mechanical properties of the unmodified\npolymer matrix. The present embodiments are applicable, but not limited\nto: racing applications, aerospace applications, textile industry, electronic applications, military hardware improve-\n\nments, and even food service industries.\nOne specific application of the polymeric composition is for use in tanks,\npipes, valves, structural supports, and\ncomponents for hot or cold fluid\nprocess systems where heat flow\nthrough materials is problematic and\nnot desired.\nWith respect to thermal conductivity\nand physical properties, these materials\nare superior alternatives to prior composite materials. These materials may\nprove useful as substitutes for metals in\nsome cryogenic applications.\n\nA material of this type can be made\nfrom a blend of thermoplastics, elastomers, and appropriate additives and\nprocessed on normal polymer processing equipment.

However, both capabilities are\nneeded in robotic, standby-power, and\nother applications that involve duty cy-\n\ncles that include long-duration, lowpower portions and short-duration,\nhigh-power portions.\nThe electrochemically active ingredients\nof the present developmental composite\ncathode materials are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Carbon-coated LiFePO4, which has a spe-\n\n23\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\ncific charge capacity of about 160 mA\xc2\xb7h/g\nand has been used heretofore as a highdischarge-rate cathode material; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Li[Li0.17Mn0.58Ni0.25]O2, which has a specific charge capacity of about 240\nmA\xc2\xb7h/g and has been used heretofore as\na high-energy-density cathode material.\nIn preparation for fabricating a composite-material cathode in the approach followed thus far in this development effort, the aforementioned\nelectrochemically active ingredients are\nincorporated into two sub-composites:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A mixture comprising 10 weight percent of poly(vinylidene fluoride)\n\n24\n\nPage 24\n\n[PVDF], 10 weight percent of carbon,\nand 80 weight percent of carboncoated LiFePO4 and,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A mixture comprising 10 weight percent of PVDF, 10 weight percent of carbon, and 80 weight percent of\nLi[Li0.17Mn0.58Ni0.25]O2.\nIn the fabrication process, these mixtures are spray-deposited onto an aluminum current collector. While the two\nmixtures could be spray-deposited simultaneously on the same current-collector area to obtain a single layer comprising a mixture of two sub-composites,\nelectrochemical tests performed thus far\n\nhave shown that better charge/\ndischarge performance is obtained\nwhen either (1) each mixture is sprayed\non a separate area of the current collector or (2) the mixtures are deposited sequentially (in contradistinction to simultaneously) on the same current-collector\narea so that the resulting composite\ncathode material consists of two different sub-composite layers.\nThis work was done by Jay Whitacre,\nWilliam West, and Ratnakumar Bugga of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).

Like other such\nmechanisms, this mechanism can be used\nas a braking or shock-absorbing device for\nany of a variety of purposes \xe2\x80\x94 for example,\nenabling a person to descend from an\nupper floor of a burning building at a safe\nspeed, capturing and slowing a moving vehicle, or limiting the shock load generated by\nopening of a parachute. Whereas other\nsuch mechanisms operate at payout speeds\nthat vary with the length of payout, this\nmechanism operates at approximately constant payout speed, regardless of the length\nof cord that has already been paid out.\nIn a prior mechanism of this type, a\ncord is paid out from a spool on a shaft\nconnected to a centrifugal brake. Because\nthe payout radius on the spool decreases\nas cord is paid out, the speed decreases by\na corresponding amount.\nThe present mechanism (see figure)\nincludes a spool, a capstan assembly, and\ncentrifugal brakes. The spool is used to\nstore the cord and, unlike in the prior\nmechanism, is not involved in the primary braking function. That is, the\nspool operates in such a way that the\ncord is unwound from the spool at low\n\nCapstan\n\nCord From Spool\n\nCord Paid Out\n\nThe Cord Is Paid Out at Constant Radius from\nthe capstan, which is connected to the centrifugal brake.\n\ntension. The spool is connected to the\nrest of the mechanism through a constant-torque slip clutch. The clutch must\nslip in order to pay out the cord.\nAs the cord leaves the spool, it passes\ninto the capstan assembly, wherein its direction is changed by use of the first of\nthree idler sheaves and it is then routed\ninto the first of three grooves on a capstan. After completing less than a full circle in the first groove, the cord passes\nover the second idler sheave, which is\npositioned to enable the cord to make\n\nthe transition to the second groove on\nthe capstan. Similarly, a third idler\nsheave enables the cord to make the\ntransition to the third groove on the capstan. After traveling less than a full circle\nin the third groove, the cord leaves the\ncapstan along the payout path. The total\nwrap angle afforded by this capstan-andidler arrangement is large enough to\nprevent slippage between the cord and\nthe capstan.\nThe capstan is connected to a shaft\nthat, in turn, is connected to a centrifugal brake. Hence, the effective payout\nradius, for purposes of braking, is not\nthe varying radius of the remaining\ncord on the spool but, rather, the constant radius of the grooves in the capstan. The payout speed is determined\nprimarily by this radius and by the characteristics of the centrifugal brake.\nTherefore, the payout speed is more\nnearly constant in this mechanism than\nin the prior mechanism.\nThis work was done by Tommaso P. Rivellini,\nDonald B. Bickler, Bradford Swenson, John\nGallon, and Jack Ingle of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1). NPO-40109\n\nAlignment-Insensitive Lower-Cost Telescope Architecture\nThis next-generation architecture enables construction of very large telescopes.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThis architecture features an active\nwavefront sensing and control scheme\nalong with methods for measuring the\nrelative positions of the primary to aft\noptics, such as the secondary mirror, and\nshould enable larger and cheaper telescope architectures needed for future\napplications. This design overcomes the\nstability requirements of large telescope\nprimary mirrors.\nA wavefront source/sensor is placed at\nthe center of curvature of the primary\nmirror. The system provides continuous\nlight onto a primary mirror that is retroreflected onto itself. This allows the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nwavefront controller to constantly update the positions of the primary mirror\nsegments (or deformable mirror actuators). For spherical primaries (where\nreplicated mirrors can be used), a spherical source is used. For aspheric primaries, a null is used. The return beam can\nbe analyzed through focus by using established wavefront sensing and control\ntechniques, including prisms for coarse\nalignment, multi-wavelength interferometry, or phase retrieval. The light can\nbe monochromatic or white light. This\nsame source and sensor can also be used\nto check out the system during assembly.\n\nAnother function of this innovation\ninvolves using a concave mirror on the\nback of the secondary mirror (or other\naft optic) that has the same center-ofcurvature location (in defocus) as the\nprimary mirror. The two return beams\ncan be aligned next to each other on a\ndetector, or radially on top of each\nother. This provides a means with which\nto measure the relative position of the\nprimary to the secondary (or other aft\noptics), thus allowing for the removal of\nmisalignment of the center-of-curvature\nsource/sensor (meaning it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need\nprecision placement) and also provides\n\n25\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\na means with which to monitor the relative alignment over time.\nThis innovation does not require extremely good thermal stability on the primary mirror and can thus be used in any\nthermal environment and with cheaper\nmaterials. This factor could be critical in\nenabling the construction of very large\ntelescopes, and provides a means for test-\n\nPage 26\n\ning a very large telescope as it is being assembled. In addition to this, the architecture lets one phase (or align) the primary mirror independent of whether a\nstar or scene is in the field. The segmented, spherical primary allows for\ncost-effective three-meter class (e.g.\nMidex and Discovery) missions as well as\nenabling 30-meter telescope solutions\n\nthat can be manufactured in a reasonable amount of time. The continuous\nwavefront sensing and control architecture enables missions for low-Earth-orbit.\nThis work was done by Lee Feinberg, John\nHagopian, Bruce Dean, and Joe Howard for\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

The essential feature of this invention is a gas-carrying tube surrounding a\ncentral heating element. The propellant\nis flashed into vapor and then passes\nthrough a narrow annulus between the\ntube and the heater where it is cracked\n(in the case of methanol, into CO and\n\nH2) before being discharged through a de\nLaval nozzle to produce thrust.\nA multi-layer radiation shield around\nthe gas tube minimizes heat loss. Also, if\nmethanol is used as the propellant, the\nsimultaneous heating and cracking does\nnot need an additional device. This unit\nwould be especially useful for small satellites, with mass up to 100 kg, and for\ndelta v up to 500 m/sec, and is suited for\nuse with \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d methanol as the propellant where a specific impulse of 220 seconds is expected. Noble metal alloys are\n\nthe optimal materials of construction.\nWhile the microresistojet is especially\nsuited to methanol, many other propellants may be used such as water or, in the\ncase of de-orbiting, many other residual\nliquids onboard the vehicle.\nThis work was done by Thomas Brogan,\nMike Robin, Mary Delichatsios, John Duggan, Kurt Hohman, and Vlad Hruby of\nBusek Co.

GSC-15053-1\n\nUsing Piezoelectric Devices To Transmit Power Through Walls\nIt would not be necessary to make holes in walls for wires.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method denoted wireless acousticelectric feed-through (WAEF) has been\nconceived for transmitting power and/or\ndata signals through walls or other solid\nobjects made of a variety of elastic materials that could be electrically conductive\nor nonconductive. WAEF would make it\nunnecessary to use wires, optical fibers,\ntubes, or other discrete wall-penetrating\nsignal-transmitting components, thereby\neliminating the potential for structural\nweakening or leakage at such penetrations. Avoidance of such penetrations\ncould be essential in some applications\nin which maintenance of pressure, vacuum, or chemical or biological isolation\nis required.\nIn a basic WAEF setup (see figure), a\ntransmitting piezoelectric transducer on\none side of a wall would be driven at resonance to excite ultrasonic vibrations in\nthe wall. A receiving piezoelectric transducer on the opposite side of the wall\nwould convert the vibrations back to an\nultrasonic AC electric signal, which\nwould then be detected and otherwise\n\n26\n\nWall\n\nTransmitting\nPiezoelectric Transducer\n\nReceiving\nPiezoelectric Transducer\n\nTo Power- or Data-SignalProcessing Circuits\nDriver\n\nUltrasonic Vibrations\nPropagating Through Wall\n\nUltrasonic Waves would be used to transmit a power or data signal through a wall.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nprocessed in a manner that would depend on the modulation (if any) applied\nto the signal and whether the signal was\nused to transmit power, data, or both.\nThe basic WAEF concept admits of\nvariations. In one potentially important\nclass of variations, different frequencies\n(in particular, those of lower- and higherorder resonances) would be used to\ntransmit different signals through a wall\nin the same direction or in opposite directions. For example, an exterior ultrasonic transducer on a vessel could be excited at the fundamental resonance\nfrequency to transmit power through the\nwall to an interior ultrasonic transducer\nto activate instrumentation inside the ves-\n\nPage 27\n\nsel, while the interior ultrasonic transducer could be excited at the frequency\nof a higher-order resonance to transmit\ndata signals from the interior instrumentation to an external computer.\nAn\nelectromechanical-network\nmodel has been derived as a computationally efficient means of analyzing\nand designing a WAEF system. This\nmodel is a variant of a prior model,\nknown in the piezoelectric-transducer\nart as Mason\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent-circuit model,\nin which the electrical and mechanical\ndynamics, including electromechanical\ncouplings, are expressed as electrical\ncircuit elements that can include inductors, capacitors, and lumped-parameter\n\ncomplex impedances. The real parts of\nthe complex impedances are used to account for dielectric, mechanical, and\ncoupling losses in all components (including all piezoelectric-transducer,\nwall, and intermediate material layers).\nIn an application to a three-layer piezoelectric structure, this model was shown\nto yield the same results as do solutions\nof the wave equations of piezoelectricity\nand acoustic propagation in their full\ncomplexity.\nThis work was done by Stewart Sherrit, Yoseph\nBar-Cohen, and Xiaoqi Bao of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The\nvalve (see figure) includes a poppet\nthat is moved into or out of contact\nwith a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing\npairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their\ntransition temperature: heated wires\ncontract to their \xe2\x80\x9cremembered\xe2\x80\x9d\nlength, applying tension to pull the\npoppet toward or away from the seat.\nA latch consisting mainly of a bistable\nBelleville washer (a conical spring)\nmade of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions\ncorresponding to the fully closed or\nfully open state, holding the poppet\nin one of these positions when power\nis not applied to either pair of\nSMA wires.\nThe reason for using SMA wires is\nthat in comparison with other linear\nactuators of the same mass and size,\nSMA wires produce more work output.\nThe light weight and compactness of\nthe SMA-wire actuators and the\nBelleville-washer latch make it possible\nfor this valve to be smaller and less\nmassive than are prior valves of comparable performance.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\n0.450 in.\n\nFerrule\n\nSMA\nWires\n\n1.96 in.\n\nBelleville\nWasher\n\nBellows\nPoppet\nSeat\n\n0.795 in.\nThe Miniature Latching Valve, shown here in the open\nstate, is actuated between the open and closed states\nby means of the SMA wires and the Belleville washer.\n\nTo obtain maximum actuation force\nand displacement, the SMA wires must\nbe kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit\nthe fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier\ndesign provided for each wire to be\ncrimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the\nopening to produce a large, uniformly\ndistributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical\nferrule depicted in the figure.\nA major problem in designing the\nvalve was to protect the SMA wires\nfrom a bake-out temperature of 300\n\xc2\xb0C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in\nplace by miniature clip rings.\nThis work was done by A.

(Thereafter, the liquids can be dispensed, in controlled volumes, into scientific instruments for\nanalysis of the contaminants.) The swab\ndevice is designed so as not to introduce\nadditional contamination and to facilitate, simplify, and systematize the dispensing of controlled volumes of liquid\ninto analytical instruments.\nThe use of currently commercially\navailable contamination-sampling devices involves significant mechanical\nmanipulation of samples and liquids,\nand there is no provision for systematic\ndispensing of controlled volumes of liquid into analytical instruments: A typical\nuse involves wiping a surface of interest\nwith a standard implement resembling a\ncotton swab. The implement is then\nplaced into a volume containing the liquid in which the sample is to be suspended. Ultimately, the liquid must be\nextracted from this volume and dispensed into an analytical instrument by\nuse of a pipette. The swab device is a single apparatus into which are combined\n\nall the equipment and materials needed\nfor sampling surface contamination.\nThe swab device contains disposable\ncomponents stacked together on a nondisposable dispensing head. One of the\ndisposable components is a supply cartridge holding a sufficient volume of liquid for one complete set of samples.\n(The liquid could be clean water or another suitable solvent, depending on\nthe application.) This supply of liquid is\nsealed by Luer valves.\nAt the beginning of a sampling\nprocess, the user tears open a sealed bag\ncontaining the supply cartridge. A tip on\nthe nondisposable dispensing head is\nengaged with a Luer valve on one end of\nthe supply cartridge and rotated, locking the supply cartridge on the dispensing head and opening the valve. A bag\ncontaining a disposable swab tip is\nopened, and the end of the supply cartridge opposite the aforementioned end\nis engaged with the swab tip and rotated,\nopening a valve.\nThe swab tip includes a fabric swab\nthat is wiped across the surface of interest to acquire a sample. A sealed bag\ncontaining a disposable dispensing tip\n(not to be confused with the non-dispos-\n\nable dispensing head) is then opened,\nand the swab tip is pushed into the dispensing tip until seated. The dispensing\nhead contains a piston that passes\nthrough a spring-loaded lip seal. The air\nvolume displaced by this piston forces\nthe liquid out of the supply cartridge,\nover the swab, and into the dispensing\ntip. The piston is manually cycled to enforce oscillation of the air volume and\nthereby to cause water to flow to wash\ncontaminants from the swab and cause\nthe resulting liquid suspension of contaminants to flow into the dispensing\ntip. After cycling several times to ensure\nadequate mixing, liquid containing the\nsuspended contaminant sample is dispensed through the dispensing tip in 25\xc2\xb5L increments into an analytical instrument. The disposable components are\nthen removed from the dispensing\nhead. Thereafter, the dispensing head\ncan be reused with a fresh set of disposable components.\nThis work was done by Mark Wells of\nUAH for Marshall Space Flight Center.

The apparatus is also\ndesigned for deposition of particles\nother than bacterial spores, including\nfungal spores, viruses, bacteriophages,\nand standard micron-sized beads.

Sun photometer\nmeasurements at various wavelengths can\nbe analyzed to estimate molecular scattering, aerosol extinction, and columnar concentrations of water vapor, ozone, and\ntrace gases in the atmosphere.\nAccurate sun photometer calibration is\ncritical to properly measure the solar irradiance and characterize the atmosphere.\nTraditional sun photometer calibration requires solar observations over several\nhours. This approach can be impractical\nand inadequate, particularly in places\nwhere the atmosphere is harsh and/or its\noptical characteristics are variable. In contrast, the procedures for operating this\nphotometer entail less data acquisition\ntime and embody a more direct approach\nto calibration. The scientific value of the\nmeasurement data produced by this instrument is not adversely affected by at-\n\nmospheric instability. In addition, this instrument yields hyperspectral data covering a large spectral range (350\xe2\x80\x932,500 nm)\nnot available from most traditional sun\nphotometers.\nThe hyperspectral sun photometer\ncomponents include (1) a commercially\navailable spectroradiometer that has been\ncalibrated in a laboratory according to\nstandards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and (2)\na commercially available reflectance standard panel that exhibits nearly Lambertian 99-percent reflectance. The spectroradiometer is positioned above, and aimed\ndownward at, the panel. The procedure\nfor operating this instrument calls for a series of measurements: one in which the\npanel is fully illuminated by the sun, one\nin which a shade is positioned between the\npanel and the sun, and two in which the\nshade is positioned to cast a shadow to either side of the panel. The total sequence\nof measurements can be performed in less\nthan a minute.\nFrom these measurements, the total\nradiance, the diffuse radiance, and the\ndirect solar radiance are calculated. The\ndirect solar irradiance is calculated from\nthe direct solar radiance and the known\nreflectance factor of the panel as a func-\n\ntion of the solar zenith angle. Atmospheric characteristics are estimated\nfrom the optical depth at various wavelengths calculated from (1) the direct\nsolar irradiance obtained as described\nabove, (2) the air mass along a column\nfrom the measurement position to the\nSun, and (3) the top-of-atmosphere\nsolar irradiance.\nThe instrumentation used to implement\nthe sun photometer is the same as that\nused to characterize targets used in radiometric vicarious calibrations. Utilizing this\ntype of sun photometer thus reduces the\namount of instrumentation and labor required to perform these studies.\nThis work was done by Mary Pagnutti,\nRobert Ryan, and Kara Holekamp of Science\nSystems and Applications, Inc. for Stennis\nSpace Center.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention should be addressed to:\nScience Systems and Applications, Inc.\nStennis Space Center\nBuilding 1105\nStennis Space Center, MS 39529\n(228) 688-2135\nE-mail: Mary.

The system would establish a\nhigh-speed, low-latency, deterministic loop\ncommunication path connecting all the\nspacecraft in a cluster. The system would\nbe a wireless version of a ring bus that\ncomplies with the Institute of Electrical\nand Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 1393 (which pertains to a spaceborne\nfiber-optic data bus enhancement to the\nIEEE standard developed at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory). Every spacecraft\nin the cluster would be equipped with a\nring-bus radio transceiver. The identity of\na spacecraft would be established upon\nconnection into the ring bus, and the\nspacecraft could be at any location in the\nring communication sequence.\nIn the event of failure of a spacecraft,\nthe ring bus would reconfigure itself, bypassing a failed spacecraft. Similarly, the\nring bus would reconfigure itself to accommodate a spacecraft newly added to the\ncluster or newly enabled or re-enabled.\nThus, the ring bus would be scalable and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nA document discusses a multi-objective,\ngenetic algorithm designed to optimize\nLyapunov feedback control law (Q-law)\nparameters in order to efficiently find\nPareto-optimal solutions for low-thrust\ntrajectories for electronic propulsion systems. These would be propellant-optimal\nsolutions for a given flight time, or flight\ntime optimal solutions for a given propellant requirement. The approximate solutions are used as good initial solutions for\nhigh-fidelity optimization tools. When the\ngood initial solutions are used, the high-fidelity optimization tools quickly converge\nto a locally optimal solution near the initial solution.\nQ-law control parameters are represented as real-valued genes in the genetic algorithm. The performances of\nthe Q-law control parameters are evaluated in the multi-objective space (flight\ntime vs. propellant mass) and sorted by\nthe non-dominated sorting method that\nassigns a better fitness value to the solutions that are dominated by a fewer\nnumber of other solutions. With the\nranking result, the genetic algorithm encourages the solutions with higher fitness values to participate in the reproduction process, improving the\n\nsolutions in the evolution process. The\npopulation of solutions converges to the\nPareto front that is permitted within the\nQ-law control parameter space.\nThis work was done by Seungwon Lee, Paul\nvon Allmen, Anastassios Petropoulos, and\nRichard Terrile of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The low-impact\nmating system is fully androgynous: it\nmates with a copy of itself, i.e., all spacecraft and other objects to be mated are to\nbe equipped with identical copies of the\nsystem. This aspect of the design helps to\nminimize the number of unique parts and\nto standardize and facilitate mating operations. The system includes a closed-loop\nfeedback control subsystem that actively\naccommodates misalignments between\nmating spacecraft, thereby attenuating\nspacecraft dynamics and mitigating the\nneed for precise advance positioning of\nthe spacecraft.\nThe operational characteristics of the\nmating system can be easily configured in\nsoftware, during operation, to enable mating of spacecraft having various masses,\ncenter-of-gravity offsets, and closing velocities. The system design provides multifault tolerance for critical operations: for\nexample, to ensure unmating at a critical\ntime, a redundant unlatching mechanism\nand two independent pyrotechnic release\nsubsystems are included.\nThis work was done by James L.

This\nmethod can be used in air, and is\nportable for field use. This method operates in reflectance, absorbance, and luminescence modes.\nThe ultraviolet source is used to illuminate a composite surface of interest. In reflectance mode, the reflected response is\nacquired via the imaging system or via the\nspectrometer. The spectra are analyzed for\norganic compounds (conjugated organics) and inorganic compounds (semiconducting band-edge states; luminescing defect states such as silicates, used as\nadhesives for composite aerospace applications; and metal oxides commonly used\nas thermal coating paints on a wide range\nof spacecraft). The spectra are compared\nwith a database for variation in conjugation, substitution, or length of molecule\n(in the case of organics) or band edge position (in the case of inorganics).\nThis approach is useful in the understanding of material quality. It lacks the\nprecision in defining the exact chemical structure that is found in other materials analysis techniques, but it is advantageous over methods such as\nnuclear magnetic resonance, infrared\nspectroscopy, and chromatography in\nthat it can be used in the field to assess\nsignificant changes in chemical structure that may be linked to concerns associated with weaknesses or variations\nin structural integrity, without disassembly of or destruction to the structure of\ninterest.\n\n34\n\nPage 34\n\nThis work was done by Betsy Pugel of Goddard Space Flight Center.

This unique sensor combines the diversity of polymer sensors for chemical\nsensing with their response to a wide variety\nof analytes with the specificity of a gold sensor that shows strong reaction/binding\nwith selected analyte types, such as mercury\nor sulfur.\nThis work was done by Kenneth Manatt of\nSanta Barbara Research and Margie Homer,\nMargaret Ryan, Adam Kisor, Abhijit Shevade, April Jewell, and Hanying Zhou of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

The model is represented by\na modified Madelung equation in which\nthe quantum potential is replaced by different, specially chosen \xe2\x80\x9ccomputational\xe2\x80\x9d\npotential. As a result, the dynamics attains both quantum and classical properties: it preserves superposition and entanglement of random solutions, while\nallowing one to measure its state variables, using classical methods. Such optimal combination of characteristics is a\nperfect match for quantum-inspired\ncomputing. As an application, an algorithm for global maximum of an arbitrary integrable function is proposed.\nThe idea of the proposed algorithm is\nvery simple: based upon the Quantuminspired Maximizer (QIM), introduce a\npositive function to be maximized as the\nprobability density to which the solution\nis attracted. Then the larger value of this\nfunction will have the higher probability\nto appear.\nSpecial attention is paid to simulation\nof integer programming and NP-complete problems. It is demonstrated that\nthe problem of global maximum of an\nintegrable function can be found in polynomial time by using the proposed quantum-classical hybrid. The result is extended to a constrained maximum with\napplications to integer programming\nand TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem).\nThis work was done by Michail Zak of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nNPO-45458\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2008\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nPage 35\n\nNTB GPO_0608.qxp:Layout 1\n\n5/29/08\n\n12:46 PM\n\nPage 36\n\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\n'
