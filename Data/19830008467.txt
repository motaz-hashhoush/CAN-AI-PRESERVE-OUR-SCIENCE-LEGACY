Scientists were intrigued by the idea of converting the high energy density of the nuclear reactor directly into a laser beam\nproduce an extremely high-power laser. Initial research to demonstrate such a laser\nwas meager because of limited funding and reactor availability. As an outgrowth of\nprograms to develop the nuclear-powered rocket and gas core nuclear reactor, NASA\nsupported (during the 1970\'s) a rather broad programresearch in direct nuclearof\npumped lasers. NASA was interested in the nuclear-pumped laser for several reasons:\n1.

Considerable success was obtained\nwith both approaches.\nResearch in nuclear-pumped lasers was also supported by the Energy Research\nDevelopment Administration (the forerunner of the Department of Energy), . the\nU.S\nArmy, and Sandia Laboratories. The emphasis in this paper, however, on the prois\nNASA.\ngram supported by\n\nPHYSICS OF NUCLEAR-PUMPED\n\na\n\nLASERS\n\nRapid development of nuclear-pumped lasers came about only after the expenditure\nof much effort to understand nuclear-induced plasmas. was realized at the outset\nIt\nthat plasmas produced by direct interaction\nof nuclear fission products with a lasing\ngas would be inherently different from plasmas produced by other means. A major\ncharacteristic of the fission fragments was their extremely large amount of kinetic\n.energy (of the order 106 times that of electrically produced plasmas). Much\nof\ninformation about the interactions of energetic heavy particles with gases was av\nable from previous research radiation effects in the upper atmosphere,\non\non the\nphysics of nuclear detectors, nuclear ionization enhancement in plasma devices,\non\nand on radiation-induced luminescence. Research on ionization chambers had determined the stopping distances of nuclear particles of the orderof centimeters\nto be\nof\nin gasesat pressures of 100 kPa. Therefore a large portion the kinetic energy of\nthese particles would\nbe absorbed in the laser medium at high pressures. Howonly\never, low gas pressures were considered at that time to be more favorable to\n2\n\naction. An early conclusion\nwas that nuclear-pumped gas lasers would have to operate\nat high pressures, and consequently the excitation mechanisms producing a population\ninversion might differ from those in other laser systems-. When a high-energy fission\nfragment is absorbed in a gas, its kinetic energy is lost by inelastic collisions\nresulting in ionization and excitation\nof the medium. The free electrons produced\nin\nthe first few collisions also have considerable kinetic energy and, as a result,\nW\ntribute to the ionization and excitation processes. The average energy required\nto produce an ion pair is given by\n\nwhere\n\nEi\n\n= 1.06Vi\n\nionization\n\n-\n\npotential\n\nof\n\nthe\n\natom\n\naverage energy expended in atomic excitation,\n0.85Vi\n\nEX\n\n-\n\naverage\nkinetic\nenergy subexcitation\nof\nelectrons,\n0.31Vi\n\nE\n\nNX\n\nnumber\n\nof\n\nNi\n\nnumber of\n\natoms\natoms\n\nexcited\nionized\n\nThe numbers of atoms involved, Nx and Ni, are related by\n\nSince there is no external means heating the free electrons, thermalization\nof\nat near room temperature would result.

The first investigation to consider some detail the formation\n)\nin\nof excited states due to the recombination\nof thermal electrons and the associated\nradiative and collisional decay\nof these states was carried out by Russell 5).\n(ref.\nHe considered pure Ar excited by fission fragments from a thin uranium the\non coating\nend walls of acavity. Rate equations were developed describing the atomic ion Ar+,\nthe molecular ionr, and the excited atomic states in a gas having a degree of\nA;\nionization of the order of\nand an electron temperature less than 2000 K. These\nequations were solved for a range of thermal neutral flux\n4 from 1.8 X 10l8 to\n3.0 x 10l8 n/m2-s and electron densities Ne from4 X 10l8 to 6 X 10l8 electrons/m3.\nRussell assumed that the excited atomic states could be formed by\n(1) recombination\nof thermal electrons with atomic ions, inelastic collisions between excited atoms\n(2)\nand thermal electrons, (3) radiative transitions,\n(4) direct excitation due to\nfission fragments and high-energy secondary electrons, (5) the products of disand\nsociative recombinationof diatomic ions. The results of this investigation indicated that a direct nuclear-pumped laser utilizing the 4d-5p transition array in\nwas achievable.\n\nSchneider (ref. 6 ) studied the kinetic processes involved in the interaction\nof\nnuclear radiation fission fragments with helium. In particular, this work was\ndirected toward the study excitation of the atomic helium states by direct impa\nof\nby fission fragments and impact by high-energy secondary electrons. Experiments\n(refs. 7 and 8) carried out in a training reactor indicated that direct excitation\nfission fragments dominated at low pressures, while excitation by secondary elect\ndominated at high pressure. These experiments also indicated that the fission fragment excitation in a gas could not be described with an equilibrium model.\nOne area that received considerable theoretical attention was the distribution\nof\nthe free electrons in a radiation-produced plasma. and Miley (ref.9 ) studied the\nLo\nproblem with an integral balance technique applied to a helium plasma produced\nboron-coated tube. They assumed thatat the pressures considered(>2.7 kPa), excitation of the neutral atoms was produced predominantly by secondary electrons being\nslowed down by collision with the neutral gas (i.e., Coulomb collisions with other\nelectrons and ions were neglected). The ionization fraction was restricted to a\nvalue approximately less than and thermal neutron fluxes were restricted to less\nthan 10l8 n/m2-s. These investigations showed that the electron energy distribution\nfunction decreased rapidly at high energies because\nof the large rate of energy loss\nby inelastic collision. The high-energy secondary electrons, however, contributed\nsignificantly to the "high-energy tail" of the distribution,\nso that the function\nwas non-Maxwellian. Values of W (energy required to produce ion pair) calcuan\nlated from this distribution agreed relatively well with measured values.\n10)\nHassan and Deese (ref. used a Boltzmann equation formulation to study the\nelectron distribution in a helium plasma produced by fission fragments from a\ncoating. This formulation took into account the effects ambipolar diffusion,\nof\n\n4\n\nelastic and inelastic collisions, two- and three-body recombination, and ionization.\nSince the primary electrons generated by the fission fragments were not monoenergeti\nthe formulation allowed for a source\nof primary electrons whose distribution was\ncalculated by Guyot et al. (ref.)\n1 . Calculations were carried out for neutron\n1\nfluxes 4 from 3 8 X 1015 to 7.6 X 10l8 n/m2-s, a temperature T of 300 K, and\n.\npressures p from 13.3 to 100 kPa. Figure 2 shows the calculated distribution\na\nfunction. These calculations showed that large fraction of the energy of the primary electrons was transferred into excited states.\n\nIO8\nRecombination\nregion\n\n1\n,\n\nlo4\n\nI\n\nm\n\n5\n0\nL\n\n100\n\nc\n\nu\nW\nW\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n1\n10\nElectron\nenergy, e V\n\nFigure 2 - Calculated electron energy distribution function\n.\nF\n,\nin a nuclear-induced He plasma. p = 13.3 kpa; T = 300 K;\n@ = lo2\' n/m2-s.\nDeese and Hassan (ref. 12) carried out a detailed of anuclear-induced\nstudy\nplasma to investigate gain and excited-state populations in the medium. The kinetic\nmodel developed in the study treated particles in different quantum states as different species and used the multifluid conservation equations\nof mass, momentum, and\nenergy to describe the resulting system. The model also took into account ionization, excitation and deexcitation, radiative recombination, spontaneous emission,\nassociative ionization, and dissociative and collisional recombination. Simultaneous\neffects of electrons and heavy particles in producing the plasma were considered.\nCalculated values of helium excited-state densities in a plasma produced by wall\ncoatings agreed well with experimental values obtained by Walters 7). Com(ref.\nparisons were also made with the model developed by Thiess and Miley (ref. 13).\nDuring extensive kinetic modeling a He-N2-C02-UF6 system, Hassan (ref.\nof\n14)\nconsidered charge exchange, Penning ionization, recombination, attachment, mutual\nneutralization, vibrational-vibrational and vibrational-translational energy transfer,\nand direct electron impact excitation for the various atomic and molecular species\ninvolved.

An expression for the energy\nin\ndensity as a function position within the tube, tube radius, operating pressure\nof\nand neutron fluence was derived. In this investigation, the maximum energy density\nwithin the optical cavity was achieved when the tube radius a (in meters) was\ngiven by a = 3260/p where p was the operating pressure in pascals.

The investigation showed that maximum\npower couldbe deposited in a laser tube when the tube radius wasas large\nat least\nas the range the fission fragments. The maximum power was deposited\nof\nin the helium\ngas when the tube radius equaled the fission fragment range and of 235UF6\nthe ratio\npartial pressure to total pressure o -15, corresponding to a 235UF6-He mixing\nwas\nratio of approximately\n1:6.\nAlthough these various investigations added much to the knowledge of kinetic\nprocesses in radiation-induced plasmas, they should generally be regarded as a first\neffort. Because of the high pressures and various gas mixtures employed in nuclearpumped lasers, many poorly understood reactions take place, although the dominant\nexcitation processes are now known for the 3He and noble gas systems. Furthermore,\nthe upper laser level may be populated by a of processes depending the\nvariety\non\nparticular laser,so that each laser should be studied in detail to understand the\nparticular processes involved. Consequently, much more research is required to better\nunderstand the many processes possible in nuclear-pumped lasers. Until these various\nprocesses are understood, scaling of nuclear-pumped lasers to higher efficiency and\npower will be severely restricted.\n\nNEUTRON\n\nSOURCES\n\nEarly theoretical studies (ref. 18) indicated that thermal neutron fluxes up to\nn/m2-s might be required to reach lasing threshold in a gas laser powered\nentirely by nuclear reactions. This result precluded the possibility of any source\nother than a reactor for actual experiments. fact, many existing reactors (parIn\nticularly steady-state reactors) did not provide sufficient thermal flux to achieve\nthis threshold. Reactors available to research groups were classified into two cate\ngories according to the type neutrons available to the experiment: thermal\nof\nreactors and fast-burst reactors.\n\nlo2\'\n\nThermal\n\nReactors\n\nThermal reactors normally provided thermal neutrons for experiments, although\nfast neutrons were available. These facilities were quite large, since the actual\ncore was surrounded by a moderator (graphite, heavy water, etc.), reflector, and\nshielding and also required provisions for cooling the core. One particular of\nclass\nthermal reactors available several universities, the TRIGA (training, research,\nat\nisotope production, and general atomic) reactor, provided adequate neutron fluxes for\nmany experiments. Unlike most thermal reactors, the TRIGA reactor could be operated\nX\nin a\npulsed mode, peak fluxes up to 5 1019 n/m2-s being produced in a pulse with\nof\nof\nfull widthat half-maximum (FWHM) of 12 ms. The TRIGA had the added advantagea\n3 pulses per hour).\nfairly high repetition rate (about\nThe major disadvantage of thermal reactors for nuclear-pumped laser research\nhaving to place the experiment into a beam port for neutron irradiation. This\nrequired that all adjustments to the experiment be made remotely because the\n7\n\nwa\n\nexperiment was no longer accessible to the researcher was placedin the\nit once\nreactor. Furthermore, since the entire experiment was exposed to the thermal flux,\nactivation of the assembly occurred and resultedlong decay times before research\nin\npersonnel could handle the assembly.\n\nFast-Burst\n\nReactors\n\nFast-burst reactors were unshielded and uncooled and, as a result, were very\nsmall. They produced peak neutron fluxes up to X2 1021 n/m2-s in a 200-us (FWHM)\npulse. Because of their small\nsize, these reactors were portable and could be place\nnext to the experiment. After a pulse, they could removed,so that the experiment\nbe\nwas accessible in a relatively short time. Since these reactors produced fast neutrons, it was necessary to use a moderator around the experiment to thermalize the\nneutrons.\nThese reactors produced the highest fluxes available and also allowed fairly\neasy access to the experiment. Their major disadvantage was the long time required\nfor the core to cool, normally about\n2 hours after a high-yield pulse, that the\nso\nrepetition rate was low.\n\nHISTORICAL\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nThe first comprehensive study of the possibility of powering a gas laser by\ndirect nuclear excitation was carried in 1964 by Herwig (refs. 1, 18, and 19).\nout\nHerwig recognized that solid-state lasers were susceptible to radiation damage and\nalso demonstrated that threshold requirements for He-Ne mixtures were theoretically\nwithin the reach of some existing reactors. This study also pointed\nout that a\nlarge-diameter He-Ne laser might be possible because\nof the inherently low electron\ntemperature in the radiation-induced plasma.\n\nAfter Herwig\'s study, DeShong\nin 1965 (ref. 2) carried out more detailed calculations for a He-Ne system. DeShong showed that if a high-pressure large-diameter\nlaser were feasible, direct excitation might be considerably more efficient than\nconventional pump cycle. In 1967, DeShongl undertook a series of experiments to\nverify the feasibility\nof direct nuclear pumping. While his earlier report concentrated on the He-Ne system, these experiments were carried a C 0 2 laser, most\nout on\nprobably because of the much higher efficiency of this system. These experiments\nshowed an initial decrease in the electrical threshold of the laser with increasi\nthermal neutron flux up 5 x 10l2 n/m2-s and then\nto\nan increase in the threshold\nuntil it exceeded the threshold value zero flux. This occurred at 2 X 1014 n/m2-s.\nat\nDeShong concluded that radiation-induced dissociation C02 was responsible for this\nof\nreversal at higher fluxes.\nDuring this time period\n(1966 to 1968), experiments were also in progress by\n3,\nEerkens et al. (refs. 20, and 21) at Northrop Laboratories using a pulsed TRIGA\nreactor. This research used \'B and 235U coatings and several different gases.\nO\nExperiments on Ne-02 mixtures showed radiation power outputs W, but no conof 50\nclusive evidence of lasing.

Experiments were also carried\nout in He-N2-C02 mixtures with inconclusive\nresults. The studies on the noble gases resulted in some evidence that lasing had\nbeen achieved. Although impressive, this evidence was all indirect was based on\nand\nthe observation that emission wavelengths that were known to lase in electrical\nat\ndischarges was favored over emission at normally strong fluorescent lines. The\nemission at the lasing wavelength required a minimum threshold reactor power\n(although this was not investigated for all the different gases used) and the pea\nemission was shifted relative to the reactor peak power. These two characteristics\nwould be expected for a lasing system.\nExperiments using a TRIGA reactor were also underway during this time\nthe University of Illinois (ref.22). These investigations concentrated He-Ne\non\nmixtures and resulted in a measured of up to 15 percent 3.39 pm.\ngain\nat\n\nperiod\n\nEffects of radiation electricaliy driven C02 lasers were studied by Allario\non\net al. (ref. 23) and Andriakhin et al. (ref. 24). Allario et al. observed a small\nenhancement in the output a C02 laser when the 4He was replaced by 3He and the\nof\ndevice was exposed to a thermal neutron flux of less than 10l2 n/m2-s. More dramatic was the report by Andriakhin et al. of a twofold to threefold enhancement\nof\nthe output of an electrically drivenlaser when exposed to a proton beam.\nC02\n\n4,\nEarly experiments using nuclear radiation to power solid-state lasers (refs.\n25, and 26) were also carried out. These experiments proved that nuclear radiation\nwould suppress, rather than enhance, lasing action in solids. This phenomenon was\nnot clearly understood, but was generally attributed to effects of radiation damag\n\nMost major advances in direct nuclear-pumped laser research occurred after 1970\nwhen these systems were better understood. Much of the work prior to 1970 was devo\nto studies directed toward nuclear enhancement of electrical lasers with some researc\ninto direct nuclear pumping. The results this early research (up to 1970) are\nof\nlisted in table I. Successful demonstrations of nuclear-pumped lasers in the mid1970\'s (refs. 27 through 29) gave increased momentum to nuclear-pumped laser\nresearch. Most of this early research was discussed in the review papers by Thom\nand Schneider (ref. 30). The majority of research after\n1970 can be divided into two\ncategories: studies employing 3He and 235UF6 as the excitation method and studies\nemploying 235U or l0B coatings the tube walls for excitation.\non\nAt the initiation of the nuclear-pumped laser program\nat NASA Langley Research\nCenter, the research group was required to make several decisions.

Excitation of gases by nuclear reactions was known to produce mostly ion\ntion, so that electron-ion recombination seemed a likely method of obtaining a population inversion.\n\n4. Noble gases, from argon to xenon, had inverted energy levels in many of t\nknown lasing transitions (i-e., the 1n level lies lower in energy than\n+\nthe n level). It appeared therefore that radiative recombination, which\nscales as n-3 for hydrogenic levels, could lead to a population inversio\nThis suggested that argon or a heavier noble gas be chosen, since the\nmechanism would not produce an inversion in a lighter gas such as neon.\n5. Many\n\ncontinuously operating laser transitions had been observed in noble\ngases. Consequently, filling the lower laser level would not be a major\nproblem.\n\n6. The atomic and molecular processes that might occur in a radiation-induced\nplasma were known to have short relaxation times,\nso that even if\nit were\nnecessary to carry\nout experiments with a pulsed reactor, it would still be\npossible to demonstrate continuous lasing long as the laser output\nso\nexceeded the various relaxation times the relevant processes. In the\nof\nexperiments described in this report, the above definition\nis meant when\n"continuous lasing" is mentioned.\n\n10\n\n7. The\n\nthree nuclear-pumped lasers that had been demonstrated required fairly\nhigh neutron fluxes to achieve lasing; a fast-burst reactor (with its\nhence\nhigher yields) was chosen for the experimental program.\n\nIn the following sections, the unique reactor experiments\nindividual experiments using 3He pumping are discussed.\n\nLASERS USING\nNUCLEAR-PUMPED\n\nDIRECT\nrole\n\nTHE\n\n3He\n\n(n,p)\n\n3H\n\nare\n\ndescribed\n\n+ n\n\n+\n\np(0.57 MeV)\n\n+\n\nth\n\nREACTION\n\nA class of particularly successful nuclear-pumped lasers, which played\nin achieving the NASA program goals, was excited by the reaction,\n\n3He\n\nand\n\na\n\nmajor\n\n3H(0.19 MeV)\n\nwhere n represents the thermal neutron and p represents the proton.\n\nThe use of 3He as the fissioning material utilizes the large cross section o\n3He for thermal neutron capture (5.3 X\nm2). It also offered the advantage of\nbeing agas, which readily mixed with a lasant gas to form a homogeneous mixture\nso\nthat uniform volume excitation resulted. Furthermore, since many electrically pumped\ngas lasers used helium (some required it) as a buffer itappeared reasonable to\ngas,\nreplace the helium in these systems with 3He in order to convert an electrical dis\ncharge laser to a nuclear-pumped laser. De Young et al. (ref. 31) first attempted to\nuse 3He as afissioning source for a purely nuclear-pumped laser. They used a\n1019 n/m2-s.\n3He-Ne-02 mixture in their laser and a thermal neutron flux X of 2.5\nAlthough lasing was not achieved in this experiment, a gain\nof approximately\n0 9 percent/m at 0.8446 pm (01) was measured.

A fast-burst reactor was used as a source of fast neutrons, which were\nthermalized by the polyethylene moderator. After thermalization, the neutrons were\nscattered into the laser cell containing a mixture3He and a lasant gas. The\nof\nresulting nuclear reactions produced a proton (p) and a tritium ion These\n(3H+)\nions produced many secondary electrons (by ionizing collisions) which produced\nfurther ionization and excitation of the laser medium. These processes led to a\npopulation inversion and subsequently to lasing.\n\n.\n\nA\n\ntypical\n\nexperimental setup the reactor (used by the Langley research team)\nat\nThe polyethylene moderator used in these experiments was\nwith annular thickness of\nan\n0.05 m. The laser cell normally\nconsisted of 0.025-m 0.d. quartz tubing about\n0.80 m long with Brewster angle windows\nat each end. For many of the experiments, these windows were of quartz, although\nor sodium\nother materials such potassium fluoride (IF), barium chloride (BaCl),\nas\nchloride (NaC1) were used becausetheir transmission properties certain waveof\nat\nlengths. The optical cavity was formed by dielectric-coated mirrors 0.025 m in diameter or, in some cases, by metallic (Ge, Au, Al, Ag) mirrors.

In the wavelength range from 1.2 pm um, 3.8\nto\nInAs detectors were employed. These varied from single-element to 13-element arrays\nin a cross configuration which were used to obtain the intensity distribution in\n1.5 pm to 6.0 pm, a single-element InSb detector\nlaser beam. In the range from\ncooled to 77 K was used: and beyond . pm, a GeAu detector cooled to was used.\n60\nK 77\nBoth the InAs and the InSb detectors were relatively insensitive to the y-ray and\nfast neutron flux and could be placed as close as 2 m from theOnreactor.\nthe other\nhand, the GeAu detector was extremely sensitive to the y-ray and fast neutron fiel\nand could be used only if it was well shielded and in a concert maze about\nplaced\n30 m from the reactor. This arrangement required two mirrors to direct the laser\nbeam to the detector. The detector signals were recorded on oscilloscopes. The\nInAs and InSb detectors were calibrated with a He-Ne at 3.39 urn.\nlaser\nThe visible portion of the emission was transmitted through the back mirror\n(when the dielectric mirrors were used in the optical cavity) and was focused\non the\nentrance slitof a 0.3-m monochromater equipped with a vidicon optical multichannel\nanalyzer. The optical multichannel analyzer output was fed into a desk-top computer\nwhere the spectral data were storedtape and plotted. Dataon lasing and optical\non\nemission were obtained simultaneously during each reactor pulse.\n\'He-Ar System\nLasing was observed from the 3He-Ar system at two different wavelengths,\n0\n0\n1.79 um (ArI, 3d[1/2I1- 4p[3/2I2 or 3d[1/2I0 - 4p[3/2I1) and 1.27 pm (ArI,\n0\n\n)\n3d\' 13/21 - 4p\' [1/2]1 (ref. 32). Figure 6 shows a typical oscilloscope recording\nOf the laser output.\nFast neutrons from the fast-burst reactor were moderated by the\npolyethylene moderator, which broadened the pulse shape to that shown in the middle\ntrace. The thermal neutrons produce 3He (n,p) 3H reactions in the laser cell which\nionizing and exciting the gas produce a population inversion and subsequent lasing\nin Ar. The laser output is shown in the bottom of figure 6. Lasing was\ntrace\ninitiated with a sharp threshold, a characteristic of all gas lasers, and laser ou\nput continued to follow the thermal neutron pulse rather than the fast neutron\ndemonstrating thatit was actually the thermal neutrons which were responsible for\npumping the laser. The durationof laser output was long compared with the relaxation timeof the various atomic and molecular processes occurring in the gas, and\ntherefore the laser can be considered steady state.\n\n13\n\nNeutroi\n\nflux\n\nI\n\nv\nFast-neutron\nreactor pulse\n\nThermal neutron\n\nh\n\n1.79-1.1 rn laseroutput\n\nt\nlaser\noutput\n\nFigure 6.- Oscilloscope\n\nrecording\n\nof\n\n3He-Ar\n\nlaser\n\noutput.\n\nIn figure 7, the laser output at 1.79 m (ArI) is shown as a function of total\n!l\n.\n3He-Ar pressure for a fixed 1-percent Ar concentration and a thermal neutron flu\nof 1021 n/m2-s.

The output\nof\nmirror, 0.05 m in diameter with a 10-m radius of curvature, was dielectric coated\na reflectanceof 95.0 percent at 2.63 pm. The two front surface mirrors were used to\nof\ndeflect the output beam of the oscillator 180\xc2\xb0 and along the centerline\nthrough\nthe amplifier tube. The system was aligned with a small He-Ne laser. Initial\nCW\nexperiments were carried out a 3He-Xe (5 percent Xe) mixture at\non\n80 kPa. Lasing\noccurred on the 2.63-pm XeI transition, which had been previously studied. The gain\nof the oscillator was measured, as previously described, by inserting neutral den\nAll\nfilters into the cavity until lasing stopped. other parameters (Xe concentration,\ntotal pressure, and thermal neutron flux) were held constant.

A power amplification of a factor 5of\nwas obtained for\nthis system (ref. 44). These results verified that nuclear-pumped amplifiers are a\nuseful approach to the development high-power nuclear-pumped lasers.\nof\n\nOther\n\nSystems\n\nInvestigated\n\nSeveral other systems were investigated, although lasing was achieved in only\none. Initial reactor experiments were carried\nout with a 3He-Ne-02 mixture which\nlases (electrically) at0.8446 pm (01). Gain had been measured in this system when\nit was exposed to a thermal neutron of 2 5 X 1019 n/m2-s (ref. 31) but no eviflux\n.\n,\ndence of lasing was detected in the reactor experiments.\n\nA second system, investigated extensively by several different groups, was the\n3He-C02 laser. The high power output and high efficiency of this system when electrically pumped made\nit a most attractive candidate for nuclear-pumped experiments.\n\n30\n\nThe first experiments nuclear pumping of 3He-C02 were done with a hybrid\non\nsystem employing both electrical and nuclear excitement. Allario et al. (ref.\n23)\nobserved an enhancement of the laser output when it was placed\nin a\nthermal neutron\nflux of approximately 1 0 l 2 n/m2-s. Andriakhin et al. (ref. 24) used a proton beam\nas an ionization source for a 3He-N2-C02 laser system and observed a considerabl\nincrease in laser power output. Excitation by the proton beam alone did not produce\nlasing. Using a pulsed reactor, Batyrbekov al. (refs. 45 and 4 6 ) carried out\net\nexperiments with a 3He-N2-C02 laser atmospheric pressure. They observed lasing\nat\nwhen the system, with a non-self-sustaining electrical discharge, was exposed to a\nneutron flux of X5 1020 n/m2-s. McArthur et al. (ref. 47) measured a small signal\natmospheric pressure 3He-B32-C02 amplifier with a fast\ngain of4.0 percent/m in an\nn/m2-s. Gain was observed only when an elecneutron flux of approximately4 X\ntrical sustainer field was applied.\n\nExperiments were carried\nout over period of 2 years in an attempt to produce a\na\n3He-C02 laser excited only by nuclear reaction. experimental evidence to indicate\nNo\nC02 laser as aprobe to study\nlasing was found. In experiments (ref. 48) using a CW\nthe nuclear-induced plasma, Jalufka concluded that the lower laser level was probab\npopulated by electron impact in these devices. This result indicated that direct\nnuclear pumpingof a C02\nlaser was not feasible.\nExperiments on a\'He-Cd system were carried out to study the feasibility of\ncharge exchange lasers as candidates for direct nuclear pumping. This laser operated\non the charge exchange reaction:\n4\n\nHe+ + Cd\n\n-f\n\nHe + Cd+\n\nThe electrically pumped system lased two lines, at 0.5337 Um and 0.5378 um.

Experiments over of pressures\na range\n10\n(up to80 kPa) , concentrations (up to percent N F 3 ) , and thermal neutron flux (up\nto 1.5 X 1021 n/m2-s) produced no evidence of lasing.\n\nH\nExperiments using a mixture 1 percent Xe,1 percent NF3, and 98 percent \'e\nof\nat a total pressure 200 kPa were carried out with a mirror set dielectric coated\nof\nfor 0.3550 pm. This was\nan attemptto study a nuclear-pumped XeF excimer laser. NO\nlasing was observed, although strong fluoresence was observed.\n\nSummary\n\nof\n\n3He\n\nExperiments\n\nThe use of 3He as a volumetric excitation source resulted in the successful\ndemonstration of several nuclear-pumped lasers. These successes led to a better\nunderstanding of the many atomic and molecular processes occurring in a radiationinduced plasma and also demonstrated that a high-power laser excited only by nucle\n31\n\nreactions was achievable. Most the lasers that were demonstrated were recombinaof\ntion lasers, which have a low quantum efficiency and are not the best candidate\na high-power, high-efficiency space-based laser system. Much more research is\nrequired in this area to determine the best candidate for scaling to higher pow\nThis will require extensive studies of the many atomic and molecular processes\nin the\nplasma in order to decide which population inversion mechanisms will produce mor\nefficient lasers. Until these questions are resolved, scaling these systems to\nof\nhigher powers does not appear to be reasonable.\n\nDIRECT\n\nNUCLEAR-PUMPED\n\nLASERS\n\nUSING\n\nFISSIONABLE\n\nWALL\n\nCOATINGS\n\nAnother class of direct nuclear-pumped lasers which were successfully demonstrated reliedon a coatingof fissionable material such as uranium or on the\nboron\ninside of the laser tube. When these systems were exposed to a thermal neutron flux,\nthe reaction\n\n+\n\n\'B\nO\n\nn\n\n-f\n\na(1.46 MeV) + 7Li(0.84 MeV)\n\nor\n235U\n\n+\n\nn + FF (265\n\nMeV) ff (z97 MeV)\n+\n\ntakes place. In these reactions, n is a thermal neutron,\ncx is an alpha particle,\nFF is a heavy fission fragment, and ff\nis a light fission fragment. The coatedtube technique was based surface emission of energetic particles; thus, highon\npressure operation was limited because the stopping distance of the energetic\nparticles became too small relation to the laser tube diameter. This technique\nin\ndid have the advantage allowing gases to be tested without the addition and\nof\nHe, of\nbecause of the higher energy of the fission fragments, adequate energy deposition\ncould be obtained lower neutron fluxes and gas pressures.

In these experiments, pure at 77K was\nCO\nexcited by fission fragments produced by a 235u308 coating that had been exposed\nthe moderated neutron flux produced by a fast-burst reactor.

Of\nall the nuclear-pumped\nlasers demonstrated, this one had the shortest wavelength. The mechanism by which\nthe upper laser level populated was not definitely known, but was thought to be\nwas\ncharge exchange of Hg with the He+ ion.\nEarlier reports of lasing in mercury have been reported by Andriakhin et\n(ref. 53).

The wall coating\nof U02F2 and UF4 was\nformed on the inner laser cell wall by electrically pulsing gaseous at\n235UF6\n0 6 kPa, which dissociated it into 235U0$?2 and 235UF4. This coating was deposited\n.7\ninhomogeneously on the cell wall and resulted in nonuniform excitation of the las\nmedium. This is apparent from the erratic lasing shown in figureA fast35.\nresponse pressure transducer was mounted at\none end of the laser cell to measure the\nshock-wave pressure produced after a reactor pulse. These data allowed the mean\npower deposited per cubic meter to be calculated. For a mixture of (3 percent\nAr-Xe\nXe) , a total pressure of kPa, and a peak thermal flux 7.7 X 1020 n/m2-sI the\n800\nof\npower deposited in the laser medium by the wall coating was\n18 MW/m3. With 235UF6\nadded to the mixture a partial pressure 0.4 kPa, the power deposited increased\nat\nof\n2\nby 38 percent to 25 MW/m The laser output, however, did not increase with additional pumping by the gaseous 235UF6, probably because of quenching of Xe+ recom\ntion by F- ions. Formation ofF- ions depleted the free electron population and thus\nseverely reduced the recombination rate. Collisional deexcitation of the upper laser\nlevels by UF6 and its products may also have occurred. However, it was possible to\nadd up to\n0.4 kPa of gaseous 235uF6 to the laser medium without seriously quenchi\nthe laser output. The addition of 0.67 kPa of 235uF6 resulted in total quenching a\nno laser output was observed. It may be possible eventually to eliminate the wall\ncoating and achieve lasing with only gaseous 235UF6 if a suitable lasant can be\nfound. This experiment was the first to achieve partial pumping of the laser medi\nby gaseous 235uF6.\n\n.\n\nSYSTEM\n\nSTUDY\n\nA major goal of the direct nuclear-pumped laser program was to determine wh\nlasers were a feasible method extracting energy from a gas core reactor. These\nof\ntwo research programs were basic in natureitand\nwas only after successful demonstration of direct nuclear-pumped lasers and a gas core reactor that studies were ca\nout to determine the compatibility of the two systems. An excellent review article\nof the progress made in both gas core reactor research and nuclear-pumped laser\nresearch was published by Thom and Schneider (ref.\n30).\n\nRodgers (ref. 59) performed an analytical study a self-critical nuclearof\npumped laser system concept. The emphasis in this study on a reactor concept that\nwas\nwould use 235UF6 as the fissioning material. The reference configuration for this\nstudy had a lasing volume 3of m3 asthe reactor core. Rodgers concluded from this\n.2\nstudy that a self-critical direct nuclear-pumped laser-reactor could be a very\nattractive candidate for a very high-power laser system if a few important technic\nquestions could be resolved. Foremost among these questions was the identification\nof potential lasing systems that could function in a UF6 environment. If a suitabl\ncandidate couldbe found, it would be possible to produce a gas core reactor-lase\nsystem which would be self-critical and would have the potential\nof multimegawatt\ncontinuous power output.\nSeveral other approaches\npaper by Miley (ref.\n60).\n\n40\n\nto\n\na\n\nlaser-reactor\n\nsystem\n\nare\n\ndiscussed\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nrevi\n\nmLATED THEORY\n\nAND\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nA fully time-dependent numerical model characterizing proton beam-pumped laser\nchemistry was developed by Fisher and Lim (ref. This model was used to investi61).\ngate an Ar-Kr-F2 and a He-CO mixture aid to direct nuclear-pumped simulation\nan as\nexperiments. These systems represented typical excimer and infrared laser systems\nfor which substantial information existed. Major features of the model included the\ndeposition of energy by fast protons or electrons, characterization of transient\nelectron energy distributions, time-dependent and neutral chemistry, and multilevel\nenergy transfer processes.\nIn the excimer system (Ar-Kr-F2) was demonstrated that under low energy\n, it\ndeposition rates, the formation of KrF* was dominated by\nan excited-state mechanism,\nwhile under the high-energy deposition rates anticipated for direct nuclear-pumped\noperation, an ion recombination mechanism dominated the formation of KrF*. No conclusion was made concerning the feasibility of producing a direct nuclear-pumped\nexcimer laser.\nFor the infrared active He-CO system, some fundamental difficulties appeared\nwhich suggested a limitation for direct nuclear-pumped operation. Although high\nelectron densities were produced under high energy deposition rates, the large lowenergy vibrational cross sections led to rather low mean electron temperature. This\ncondition strongly favored superelastic deactivation of the vibrational levels associated with lasing. The successful demonstration a direct nuclear-pumped laser\nof\nCO\n(ref. 27) was shown to be consistent with a pumping mechanism involving electronic\nquenching and ion recombination processes.No conditions were found in this study\nfor which direct nuclear pumping the CO laser system achieved the efficiency of\nof\nthe electrical-discharge sustainer system. This conclusion appeared to be applicable\nto other infrared molecular laser systems.\n\nDavis (ref. 62) studied optical emission from Ar and Ar-N2 mixtures excited by\nfission fragments from a 235U02 coating excited by the University of Florida traini\nreactor. This investigation was directed toward a better understanding of the methods\nby which fission fragment energy was deposited into a gas. The system was modeled to\ndetermine excited-state populations of the various species. Calculated values were\n10\nwithin a factor of of the experimental values, and the model adequately predicted\nthe relative change in magnitude of the measured populations as a function of nit\n86\nconcentration. Davis found that approximately percent of the excitation produced\nwent into the formation nitrogen molecules in the A3TU state. Since this was a\nof\nmetastable state, it served as an efficient energy storage medium.\n\nZapata-Casares (ref. 63) studied the collisional formation, lifetime, and\nquenching parameters of XeF*(B) produced by direct fission fragment excitation. He\nused a 252Cf source and time-resolved spectroscopy to study the emission XeF*\nof the\nexcimer (B-tX transition) produced by the passage a single fission fragment. Qualiof\nK r to\ntative measurements using different gases showed be the best buffer gas at\npressures below 100 kPa. A kinetic model was developed to study the processes\ninvolved in the formation and quenching of the XeF*(B) state. Zapata concluded that\n100 kPa,\nfor the conditions of his experiment and at pressures below the XeF*(B) state\nwas formed predominantly by collisions between the Xe metastable atom and the fluo\ndonating molecule. In his experiment, NF3 was used as the fluorine donor. Formation\nrate coefficients, inverse lifetimes, and quenching rate coefficients were determined\nfor XeF*,KIF*, and Ar2*.\n\n41\n\nDe Young and Weaver (ref.\n64) investigated the visible spectra emitted from a\n3He(n,p) 3H nuclear-induced plasma generated under high thermal neutron flux and\nconditions. Spectra from mixturesof 3He and Ar, Xe, Ne, C12,F2, and N2 were\nKr,\nrecorded with low resolution. Comparison\nof these spectra with those obtained from\nthe afterglow of a high-pressure electrically pulsed plasma produced in the same\ngas\nmixtures indicated little difference in the emission. Excimer emission from XeF*\nand KrF* was also observed under 3He nuclear excitation, but the data were inadequ\nto estimate densities. Adding 235UF6 to He and Ar to excite the gas caused strong\nquenching of the line emission for mixtures percent UF6 and percent He.\n10 of\n90\nThese experiments pointed out the usefulness of high-pressure discharge experiments\nin the laboratory\nas away of investigating candidate systems for nuclear-pumped\nlasing.\n\n1\nZediker et al. (ref. 65) studied the production 02( A) by nuclear pumping to.\nof\ndetermine whether it was possible to produce\nan iodine laser by energy transfer from\nthe 02 (IA) to 12. These experiments used a mixture Ar at a partial pressure of\nof\n13.3 kPa and 02 at apartial pressure of 0.27\nkPa; alpha particles fromO a coating\n\'B\nexcited the mixture. Neutrons were provided by a TRIGA reactor, and steady-state as\nwell as pulsed experiments were carried out. Results these experiments indicate\nof\nthat 02 ( l a ) was produced in quantities in excess of those predicted from direct e\ntron impact excitation. It was concluded that additional mechanisms such recombias\nnation of atomic oxygen may have been a significant contributor to the 02(1A) p\ntion under these conditions.\n\nWalters et al. (ref.\n66) carried out experiments to investigate the rare-gas\nhalide lasers using a nuclear-pumped flash lamp. They studied, in detail, the production of XeF* produced by the photolysis of XeF2 by Xe2* excimer emission. In\nthese experiments, energy transfer efficiency from nuclear reaction to optical emis\nsion was measured to 67 ? 20 percent. The emission appeared in the Xe2 band\nbe\ncentered at 0.172 um. No atomic emission lines were observed the presence of the\nin\nexcimer fluorescence. Modeling of this system suggested that higher neutron fluxes\nmight be successful in achieving lasing the XeF*(C+A) transition. An experimental\non\nlaser and gain cell was constructed based\non this model and tested in a fast-burst\nreactor. The data collected were limited and therefore inconclusive.\n\nLorents et al. (ref. 67) studied in detail the performance limits of fissionfragment-excited laser systems radiating in the near ultraviolet and visible regions.\nTheir studies indicate that extremely high energy outputs appear feasible with pul\nreactors. They concluded that transverse dimensions greater than 1 m were practiof\ncal and that high-density gas phase media containing homogeneously integrated fissile\nmaterial were superior to foil configurations. They also pointed out that the use of\nfissile materials with large fission cross sections, particularly in the epithermal\nrange, increased the medium size and relaxed the kinetic and optical constraints. It\nwas also shown that simulation the conditions produced by fission fragment excitaof\ntion could be achieved over most of the relevant parameter space by studies of c\ndate media using electron beams.\n\nDlabal et al. (ref.\n68) investigated various atoms and molecules that appeared\nattractive as potential nuclear-pumped lasers. Much of their research was directed\ntoward the study of the IF* molecule. Using electron beam excitation, they identified the IF* blue-green emission the E+A3T1 transition. A radiative lifetime\nas\nof\napproximately 15 ns was determined for the upper state\nof the transition and the\nkinetic formation chain for IF* was determined. These results suggested that IF* was\na very attractive candidate for a laser to be pumped by a gas core reactor, bu\nexperiments were carried out in this area.\n42\n\nExperiments using the afterglow an electrically pulsed laser were carried\nof\nout\nby De Young et al. (ref. 0 ) . These experiments showed the value using the after4\nof\nglow to study potential nuclear-pumped laser candidates. Systems that lased strongly\nin the afterglow consistently achieved lasing with direct nuclear pumping, because\nboth the electrically pulsed afterglow and the nuclear-induced plasma were dominated\nby collisional-radiative recombination.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn 1980, the program goals the NASA nuclear-pumped laser program had been\nof\nachieved in that a direct nuclear-pumped laser operating kilowatt power level\nat the\nhad been demonstrated and the first steps toward a gas core laser-reactor using\n235UF6 as fuel had been taken. l l known nuclear-pumped lasers, as 1981, are\nA\nof\nlisted in the following table:\n\nWavelength,\n\nReaction\n\nN S Langley:\nAA\n3He-C0\n3He-Ar\n3He-Ar\n\nr\n\nPeak laser o u t p u t\n\n235\nuF6 ( n , f f ) F F\n\n?ressuret\nkPa\n\nPower ,\n\n200\n200\n300\n80\n200\n300\n26.6\n80\n\n200\n4\n1012\n0.1\n200\n0.001\n4.6\n\n13.3\n\n100\n\n26.6\n77\n40\n1.1, 0..53\n\n0.01\n0.5\nI . 00001\n100\n\n20\n80\n6.7-80\n6.7-80\n\n0.001\n0.001\n\n1.45\n\n3 H e ( n ,p ) 3H\n\n3He-C1\n\n3He-Xe\n3He-Xe\n3He-Kr\nAr-Xe\n\nMinimum\nlasing\nthreshold,\nn/m\xe2\x80\x99-s\n\n2.397, 1.19, 1.15\n2.63,\n2.48\n2.52\n0.5337, 0.5378\n\n200\n400-500\n100\n53\n\n30\n2000\n10\n\num\n\n5.00\n1 . 7 91 . 2 7\n,\n1.79\n1.586\n3.508,\n2.027,\n3.652\n2.63\n2.19,\n2.52\n2.65\n\nW\n\n<lo\n\nSandia Labs. :\n\nco\nL s A l a m o s and\no\nU n i v .o fF l o r i d a :\n4He-Xe\n3He-Xe\n3He-Ne\nHe-N2-C02\n\nUniv. of I l l i n o i s :\nNe-Nz\n\xe2\x80\x98He-Hg\n~ H ~ - C O\n\n5.1-5.6\n\n235U(n,ff)FF\n3 H e ( n , p ) 3H\n3He ( n , p ) 3H\nTransfer\n\n\xe2\x80\x99OB ( n , a ) 7 ~ i\n\n0.863,\n0.939\n0.615\n\n1.45\n\n~ H ~ - c o ~\nSovietUnion:\n\xe2\x80\x98He-Ar\n4He-Xe\n4He-Kr\n3He-Cd\n\n3.51\n2.027, 3.65\n3.5,\n0.6328\n10.6\n\n3He ( n , p ) 3H\n\n0.1\n\n43\n\nMuch\n\nmore\n\nwas\n\naccomplished\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nnuclear-pumped\n\nlaser\n\n1.

Abstract\n\nThe development of direct nuclear-pumped lasers is reviewed from the earliest know\nstudies to the present. Theoretical and experimental investigationsvarious\nof\nmethods of converting the energy of nuclear fission fragments to laser power ar\nsummarized. After initial successes in the\nmid-1970\'~~\nthe development of direct\nnuclear-pumped lasers proceeded rapidly and several nuclear-pumped lasers were\nachieved. Much of the research in this area did not produce a direct nuclearpumped laser, but this was not always the intent, since the research was done\norder to understand the basic processes involved in the production\nof a plasma by\nnuclear radiation. Significant progress was accomplished in this area and a large\namount of basic data on plasma formation and atomic and molecular processes le\ning to population inversions is now available.\n\n~\n\n17.
