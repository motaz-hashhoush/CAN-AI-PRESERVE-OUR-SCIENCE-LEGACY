This battery operated service robot\nwas designed specifically\nfor health care institutions.\nApplications\nfor the\nAIV include\ndistribution\nof clinical\nlab samples,\npharmacy\ndrugs,\nadministrative records, x-ray distribution, meal tray delivery, and certain\nemergency room applications.\nThe first AIV was installed at Lahey Clinic\nin Burlington,\nMass.

The Polaroid transducer was not available yet.\nThe speakers have a natural resonance of 5 KHZ and when set in an array\nof four speakers\n)vith a backing plate, it provided a beam width of 36\ndegrees. An eight bit 16K OSI computer provides all the computing power_\nWhile crude by today\'s standard, it indicated that the approach had promise.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nDuring the past 18 months, Cyberotics\nembarked upon a program that\nallows for manufacturing cost reduction, expanded intelligence,\nnavigation\nenhancement,\nand improved appearance.\nThis resulted in Cyber V, the\nlatest achievement\nin a technology\nwhich represents over 10 years of\nresearch and development.\n\nThe vehicle\'s motion and steering is\ndifferential wheel drive.

It is completely flexible\nand can be programmed\nto navigate a defined delivery route_ It is capable\nof accepting\ninstructions,\nmanually through the control panel keyboard, or\nthrough a digital radio communications\nlink.

An\n\nopen loop wheel drive, a natural language processor, and a video screen was\nused.\nThe control\nsoftware\nwas based on behavior\nreaction.\nIt was\nfunctional,\nbut hard to add new behaviors,\nbecause the control parameter\nwas embedded\nAssembly\nCode\n\nOPERATION:\n\nInfrared beacons\n\nOne particular\nproblem to overcome is in the acoustic vision.\nof false echoes, mirror effects and cross talk were of particular\n\nin the main body of\nand Basic was used.\n\nthe software.\n\nA\n\ncombination\n\nof\n\n\xc2\xa2vber II\nThis design was to be the answer to the personal robot craze of the 1980s,\nbut was too late and too expensive for the hobbyist and experimenter.\nThe\ncircular transducer array proved to be a viable concept)\nIt provided\na\ngeometry that all but eliminates\nthe specular\neffects, by insuring that a\ntransducer\nwas always perpendicular\nto a vertical surface.\nThe Polaroid transducers were now available.\nThis provided\na more\nefficient\nway of collecting\nrange information.\nRunning at 50 KHZ with a\n22 degree beam width, it allowed\nfor a higher resolution sensing of the\nenvironment.\nA pulsing pattern was devised to help eliminate false echoes.\nThe transducer density, however, was not sufficient\nenough to eliminate\nblind spots in its vision. It operated quite well for the experimental\nuse, but\nwas not reliable for practical\napplications.\nA new programming\nconcept\nwas developed\n\n- behavioral\n\ninduction.\n\nIn behavioral\ninduction,\na model of behavior\nis provided.\nThe model\nconsists of a set of co-efficient\nin a data base, that are selected to set the\nparameters\nof a fixed function.\nThe model is compared\nwith real world\ndata. A difference\nor error representation\nis derived.\nA set of heuristic\nrules evaluates\nthe error and specifies\nappropriate\nwheel\nresponses.\nDifferent\nfunctions,\ncoefficients,\nrules, and responses\nare capable\nof\nproducing a wide range of behavior types. Automatic and fixed selection\nof behavior\ntypes, allow\nthe vehicle\nto move\nfreely\nthrough\nthe\nenvironment.\n\nOF\nRZSERVED.\n\nw,\n\n405\n\nThe\nability\n\nto behave and to react to the environment, does not necessarily\ngive the vehicle a useful purpose.\nThe ability to go from point A to point\nB, requires navigation and command input to give it direction.\nA reference position system was added that provided information to the\nvehicle when it reached key locations.\nThe system cbhsisted of an ultra\nsonic ranging transducer which measured the height of an object overhead.\nStations were built with dimensions\nof specific heights_ When height was\ndetccted, that location was fixed, e.g.: ceiling heights, doorways, stations.\nA command\nat the keyboard would\nbe mapped to a location having a\nspecific height, thereby, fixing the robot at that location.\nThis system was\nconvenient to implement, but not meant to be practical.\nIt\'s use was to\nassist in developing\nthe navigational\nsoftware.\n\nCvb_V\nWhile\n\nCyber V required\n\nhowever,\nbecoming\n\nloop velocity controlled serve drive was added.\nof\n255 speeds.\nThe motion of the vehicle\nfor a smooth response.\n\nThis provided a\ncould now be\n\nThe acoustic overhead detector was replaced by an infrared beacon system.\nThe basic navigation\nconcept\nremains the same.\nThe infrared beacons\nprovide a positive method of location without ambiguity.\nIt also provides\ndirectional information.\nThe navigation\nalgorithm is goal seeking.\nAt each beacon, the vehicle path\nis compared with its intended\ndestination.\nIf a correction\nin path is\nrequired, the navigation\nalgorithm reevaluates\nand chooses a new path.\nCyber IlI contained a total of 60 Polaroid transducers.\nThis provided for\nhigher resolution for the vision system, but introduces\nacoustic problems.\nTransducers\nare now closer together and isolation becomes a problem.\nA\nbaffle was added to serve several purposes,\nit isolates the output of one\ntransducer\nfrom the input of another.\nIt reduces the problem of false echo\narrivals by limiting angular\nby the transducers?\n\nreception.\n\nIt also eliminates\n\nEnhancement:\n\nfeatures\n\nthat were added\n\nI)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n\ndifference\n\nin\n\nterms\n\nParticular\nattention has been placed on the human robot social interaction.\nThe vehicle operates in the same space that people do. While people have\ndeveloped\na protocol for working in small spaces, they demand equal access\nand respect. Robot vehicles must do the same. They must be perceived as\nimportant contributors\nin the work environment.\nA timid robot vehicle will\nnot gain respect,\ne.g.: When elevators were first introduced,\npeople would\nhold the doors open, denying use to users on other floors. This presented\nan operational\nproblem to elevator manufacturers.\nA solution to the problem was to modify the elevator door controls so that\nthey would automatically\nclose after a prescribed\namount of time. More\naggressive\ndoors would actually push people out of the way. The publics\ninitial reaction\nto this modification\nwas annoyance,\nbut soon gained\nacceptance\nas a necessary\nbehavior\nmodification.\nWe have found that\nadjusting the behavior of the robot vehicle to politely approach,\nbut come\nvery close to people blocking\nhallways,\nsoon gained respect for the robot\nvehicle\n\nand people\n\nnow, automatically,\n\nmove out of its way.\n\nWe believe that Cyber V is now ready for the market place and are now\ninstalling\nCyber V systems in various applications.\nWe expect that new\nproblems may arise and solutions must be found. This technology\nis now\nready for the commercial\nmarket place and are now shipping\nsystems to\ncustomers and licen_d\nOEM dealers.\n\nare:\n\nBattery gage\nKey lock on - off switch\nBattery removal cart\n\nr_m RS_\nCybcr\n\nIV was developed\n\nas an Autonomous\n\nIntelligent\n\nVehicle\n\n-\n\nc\'am_\n\nv\n\n(AIV), for\n\nthe hospital\nmarket;\nand beta tested (i991)\nat the Lahcy Clinic\nof\nBurlington,\nMass., where it was promptly and affectionately\nnamed "Lab\nRover."\nAfter beta\nremain "in service"\nvarious labs, proving\nand cost effective.\n\nof\n\ncosts.\n\nSmart bumpers\nEmergency shut down switch\nGo - No go button\nServe disable switch\n\n5)\n6)\n7)\n\ntesting was completed,\nLab Rover has continucd to\nfor over two years, delivering biological\nsamples to\nthat a system based on this technology\ncan be reliable\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\n406\n\na range of enhancements,\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis model was intended to be product ready, requiring all of the mundane,\nbut necessary, features to make it practical.\nAs an addition\nto the goal\noriented navigation,\nan error correction\nsystem was found to be necessary.\nOccasionally,\nthe vehicle would be diverted from its defined operating area\nand wander down the hallway\nwhere no navigation\nbeacon\nexists.\nTo\nalleviate this problem, an error correction\nsystem was devised by utilizing\nperipheral\nbeacons specifically\nfor recovery purposes.\nThese beacons are\nplaced at edges of the defined work environment, in areas where the vehicle\nis not aIlowed to go.
