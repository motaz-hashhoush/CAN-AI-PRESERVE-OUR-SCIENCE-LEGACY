Analysis of the IRAS data shows that the mass-loss rates from RV Tau stars have apparently significantly decreased during the past 500 yr. It seems likely that these stars have just evolved from the phase of rapid mass loss, characteristic of the last stages of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The birthrate of RV Tau stars in the solar neighborhood is about a tenth of the birthrate of all planetary nebulae, and this is consistent with the view that we are witnessing the subset of stars undergoing post-AGB evolution that are low mass and at least in some cases of low metallicity.", "title": "RV Tauri stars as post-asymptotic giant branch objects", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870033327, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jura, M."}, "organization": {"name": "California, University", "location": "Los Angeles, United States"}}, "id": "dd11dc4b2a8b4ccb8228f4927555f90c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870033327, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/164642", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "309", "submissionId": 19870033327, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "1b707fe35bf444e290919a6201c3f0af", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1986-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
