The primary science activity was investigation of silicate dust mineralogy in comets, particularly comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Determination of the dust mineralogy permits us to address an important astrophysical question of relevance to the origins and evolution of solar systems, \"Do comets contain relic interstellar dust grains? Since, comets represent the frozen reservoirs of primitive proto-solar dust and ice, we can gain insight into the problem of understanding the formation of protoplanetesimals in the. early solar nebula. Mid-infrared spectrophotometry (7 - 14 micron, R approx. = 180 - 360) of Hale-Bopp was obtained with the NASA/Ames HIFOGS at four distinct epochs pre- and post- perihelion ion from 1996 October through 1997 June. These observations were conducted at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, and were supported by funds from this training grant. The emission at mid-IR wavelengths in cometary comae arises from carbon grains, and small silicate grains which produce resonance features. Hale-Bopp had the strongest silicate feature observed from any comet to date. Theoretical calculations utilizing Mie Scattering Theory were employed to construct Synthetic cometary spectra to fit with the observed HIFOGS 10 microns spectral feature of Hale-Bopp. Our analysis suggests that the observed spectra can be modeled with the Hanner grain size distribution peaked at alpha((sub p) = 0.2 microns of fractal porous grains with porosity parameter D = 2.5. This model spectrum also fits photometry points in the 3 - 5 microns region. Comparison with the ISO SWS spectrum of Hale-Bopp obtained 1996 October reveals that the crystalline olivine grains must be at it temperature hotter than computed from Mie theory.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000021020, "id": "678d4dc15b7e475f8d262a7a490dc5bf", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
