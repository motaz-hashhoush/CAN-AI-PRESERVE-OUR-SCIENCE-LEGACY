This study is concerned with all prospective Tug-payload interfaces, including detailed analysis of low-earth orbit, geosynchronous, and interplanetary missions. Tug payload requirements are discussed and summarized as to operational requirements, structural/mechanical interface, avionics interfaces, fluids interface, and environment. The shuttle impacts created by Tug/payload interfaces are examined and presented in tabular form. Major conclusions are that all payloads in the mission model can be suitably and inexpensively accommodated by the Tug and the Shuttle if standardized  integration equipment is employed, that multiple payloads pose no significant integration challenge, and that a relatively small inventory of integration equipment is required to support all prospective payloads.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760029833, "endDate": "1975-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS, AIAA, IEEE, ORSA, and IMS,"}}, "meetingId": "f1550f35bda14b4baac5e54a2f1c3ab6", "id": "0eef50e3789349fba97bffb214811735"}], "name": "Meeting on Space Shuttle Missions of the 80''s", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "f1550f35bda14b4baac5e54a2f1c3ab6", "startDate": "1975-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760029833, "id": "1de018b944fd471fb2344c51d40ef192", "publicationDate": "1975-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
