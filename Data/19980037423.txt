The\nsystem 10 includes an ultrasonic transducer assembly 12\nwhich is shown in greater detail in F G 2, and comprises an\nI.\nultrasonic transducer 14. a parabolic collecting horn 16 and 5\na preamp circuit 18. The ultrasonic transducer 14 can be any\nconventional ultrasonic transducer such as those manufactured by Panasonic or American Piezo Ceramics. for\nexample. One preferred transducer is the 40R16A, which is\na 40 kHz ultrasonic receiver made by American Piezo io\nCeramics, and has very favorable sensitivity and noise\ncharacteristics that make it particularly suitable for use in\ndetecting low level ultrasonic vibrations as are typically\ngenerated by s m a l l leaks.\nThe transducer assembly 12 is removably connected by 15\nmeans of a shielded electrical cable 20 and a plug connector\n22 to electronic circuitry contained in a processing circuit\nhousing 24 (see also FIG. 3). The housing 24 is preferably\nportable with dimensions that permit it to be carried in an\noperator\'s pocket. Preferable dimensions for the housing 24 20\nare a length of 5.50 inches, a width of 2.25 inches and a\nheight of 0.90 inches. An odoffswitch 26 is disposed in one\nend of the housing 24 for controlling power to the system 10.\nA tether 28 and a belt clip (not shown) can also be provided\nfor facilitating convenient handling of the housing 24.\n25\n\'Avo devices are employed for providing visual and\naudible indications of the ultrasonic vibrations detected by\nthe transducer 14. These include a pair of headphones 30\nwhich are removably connected by means of an electrical\ncable 32 and a connector plug 34 to the circuitry i n the 3o\nhousing 24. A conventional multimeter 36 can also be\nremovably connected to the circuitry in the housing 24 by\nmeans of a pair of removable leads 38 and associated jacks\n39 as illustrated in FIG. 3. The headphones 30 generate an 35\naudible sound which is proportionalto the magnitude of the\ndetected ultrasonic vibrations, while the multimeter 36 displays a DC voltage value which is proportional to the\nmagnitude of the detected ultrasonic vibrations.\nI.\nTurning now to F G 2, the ultrasonic transducer assembly 4o\n12 is shown in greater detail. The parabolic collecting horn\n16 is removably attached by screw threads to a metal\n(preferably aluminum) base housing 50 which contains the\ntransducer 14, including its own housing 52. and the preamp\ncircuit 18. The reason that the collecting horn 16 is remov- 45\nably attached to the base housing 50 is to enable use of the\ntransducer assembly 12 for detecting leaks in close proximity to a particular portion of a vessel or a container, such as\na weld seam for example.\nAlternatively, the base housing 50 can be cut off flush with 50\nthe front of the transducer housing 52 as indicated by the\ndashed lines at 54, and the collecting horn 16 can be deleted\nso that the transducer housing 52 can be held directly in\ncontact with the material to be tested. This is particularly\nadvantageous for applicationswhere ultrasonic vibrations in 55\nor under the mat& are to be detected. In this case. the\ntransducer housing 52 is preferably formed from stainless\nsteel which, when pressed against a metal container, vessel\nor housing to be tested. allows good detection of ultrasonic\nsignals generated within the container, etc. The aluminum 60\nbase housing 50 permits hand pressed contact of the transducer assembly 12 against the material to be tested If the\nmaterial is ferrous, a magnetic attachment means 56 can be\noptionally provided to hold the transducer assembly 12 in\nplace against it.\n65\nThe purpose of the collecting horn 16 is to provide both\nincreased sensitivity and directionality. Preferably, the horn\n\n4\n16 has an inner surface in the shape of a parabola defined by\nthe equation Y=3X2 with a focal point F at which the\ntransducer 14 is positioned approximately \'/I of an inch from\nthe bottom of the horn. The horn 16 has a length of\napproximately 6 inches, and a front opening 58 with a\ndiameter of approximately 3 inches. With this arrangement.\nthe field of view of the transducer 14 is limited to a s m a l l\nrange, preferably on the order of approximately 4\'. The field\nof view is important because if it is too large. as is the case\nwith omnidirectional transducers, then it is very dillicult to\nlocate the source of the detected ultrasonic vibrations. On\nthe other hand, if the field of view is too small, then it\nbecomes too difficult to scan the surface to be tested fully\nand accurately. Ekperiments indicate that the parabolic collecting horn 16 increases the detection sensitivity of the\ntransducer 14 by a factor of approximately 6.\nPreferably, the collecting horn 16 is formed from a stiff\nmaterial, such as plastic, aluminum or fiberglass, for\nexample. The horn 16 has a wall thickness of approximately\n1/16 inch along most of its length, but this thickness increases\nat a base portion 60 where it connects to the base housing 50\nto facilitate a sturdy mounting between the base housing 50\nand the horn 16.\nTurning now to FTG. 3, the processing circuit housing 24\nincludes a first compartment 70 for reception of a two inch\nsquare circuit board 72. A second compartment 74 is provided for reception of first and second 9 volt batteries 76\nwhich provide power to the system 10.\nA block diagram of the operational circuitry for the\nI.\nsystem 10 is illustrated in F G 4, and this includes a\nprocessing circuit 100 disposed on the circuit board 72 for\nprocessing the signal generated by the transducer 14. The\ntransducer 14 generates a low current voltage signal whose\nmagnitude is proportional to the magnitude of incident\nultrasonic waves in the range of approximately 38 to 42 kHz\n(centered at 40 kHz). The transducer signal is immediately\npassed through the preamp 18 which preferably has a gain\nof approximately 50, and generates enough current to drive\nthe amplified signal through the cable 20 to a differential\namplifier 102 in the processing circuit 100. This further\namplifies the incoming signal by a factor of approximately\n30, and also serves to reject any noise in the signal that may\n)\nbe picked up by the cable u .\nThe amplified output signal from the differential amplifier\n102 is added to a 36 kHz square wave signal generated by\na local oscillator 104 @referably a 555 t m r , and is\nie)\ndirected to a summing amplifier 106 which generates the\nweighted s u m of these two signals. The output from the\nsumming amplifier 106 is directed to a mixing circuit 108.\nThis contains elements which effectively combine the oscillator and transducer signals in such a way that the resulting\nsignal has a frequency which is the difFerence between the\nfrequency of the transducer signal and the frequency of the\noscillator signal, and is thus in the audio frequency range of\napproximately 2 4 kHz. Details of how the mixing circuit\n108 is specifically configured are provided below in conI.\njunction with the description of F G 7.\nThe audio frequency output signal from the mixing circuit\n108 is fed through a low pass filter 110 and a high pass filter\n112, both of which combine to reject any noise or unwanted\nsignals below or above the 2-6 kHz range. Finally, the\nfiltered signal is fed through a volume adjusting circuit 113\nand an audio amplifier 114 for driving the headphones 30. In\naddition, the signal can also be fed through a DC rectifier\ncircuit 116 that converts the signal to a DC voltage having\na magnitude which is proportional to the total magnitude of\n\n5,710,377\n5\n\n6\n\nthe signal generated by the transducer 14, and this is fed\nThe combined signals from the differential amplifier 102\nthrough a low pass filter 118 to drive the multimeter 36.\nand the oscillator 104 are AC coupled through a capacitor\nand resistor pair 166 to the input of the summing amplifier\nThe details of the operational curcuiiry are illustrated in\n106.

It is important,however,\nthe negative input of the op amp so that the op amp\xe2\x80\x99s gain\nthat the LT10007 op amp 120 be positioned in close proxis small.

The audio frequency\nrange signal can be used to drive a pair of headphones worn\nby an operator. A diode rectifier based mixing circuit provides a simple, inexpensive way to mix the transducer signal\nwith a square wave signal generated by an oscillator, and\nthereby generate the audio frequency signal. The sensitivity\nof the system is greatly increased through proper selection\nand matching of the system components, and the use of\nnoise rejection filters and elements. In addition, a parabolic\ncollecting horn is preferably employed which is mounted on\nthe transducer assembly housing. The collecting horn\nincreases sensitivity of the system by amplifying the\nreceived signals, and provides directionality which facilitates easier location of an ultrasonic vibration source.\n\nn\n\n38\n\n3\n\nO\n\nUS 5,710,377 C1\n1\n2\nincluding an output for transmitting a transducer sigEX PARTE\nnal generated thereby;\nREEXAMINATION CERTIFICATE\nc) a parabolic collecting horn attached to said housing\nand positioned for collecting and focusing said ultraISSUED UNDER 35 U.S.C. 307\n\nsonic vibrations onto said transduce5 said parabolic\ncollecting horn having a front end defined by a front\nopening and a base end opposite said front end and\nattached to said housing, wherein said transducer is\nMatter enclosed in heavy brackets [ ] appeared in the\npositioned in said collecting horn adjacent said base\npatent, but has been deleted and is no longer a part of the\nend and facing said front opening to receive ultrasonic\npatent; matter printed in italics indicates additions made\nvibrations entering said front opening and being\nto the patent.\ndirected by said horn toward said base end; and\nd a processing circuit electrically connected to said\n)\nAS A RESULT OF REEXAMINATION, IT HAS BEEN\noutput of said transducer for converting said transDETERMINED THAT\n1s\nducer signal into an audio frequency signal having a\nmagnitude proportional to a magnitude of said transThe patentability of claims 1-20 is confirmed.\nducer signal.\n22.
