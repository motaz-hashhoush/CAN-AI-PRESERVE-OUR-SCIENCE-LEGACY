Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe figure shows a prototype of a relatively inexpensive electronic monitoring apparatus that measures and records\nselected parameters of lightning-induced transient voltages on communication and power cables. The selected parameters, listed below, are those most\nrelevant to the ability of lightning-induced transients to damage electronic\nequipment.\nThis apparatus bridges a gap between\nsome traditional transient-voltage\nrecorders that record complete waveforms and other traditional transientvoltage recorders that record only peak\nvalues: By recording the most relevant\nparameters \xe2\x80\x94 and only those parameters \xe2\x80\x94 this apparatus yields more useful\ninformation than does a traditional\npeak-value (only) recorder while imposing much smaller data-storage and datatransmission burdens than does a traditional complete-waveform recorder.\nAlso, relative to a complete-waveform\n\nrecorder, this apparatus is more reliable\nand can be built at lower cost because it\ncontains fewer electronic components.\nThe transients generated by sources\nother than lightning tend to have frequency components well below 1 MHz.\nMost commercial transient recorders\ncan detect and record such transients,\nbut cannot respond rapidly enough for\nrecording lightning-induced transient\nvoltage peaks, which can rise from 10 to\n90 percent of maximum amplitude in a\nfraction of a microsecond. Moreover,\ncommercial transient recorders cannot\nrearm themselves rapidly enough to respond to the multiple transients that\noccur within milliseconds of each other\non some lightning strikes.\nOne transient recorder, designed for\nKennedy Space Center earlier [\xe2\x80\x9cFast\nTransient-Voltage Recorder\xe2\x80\x9d (KSC11991), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23, No. 10,\npage 6a (October 1999)], is capable of\nsampling transient voltages at peak val-\n\nThis Prototype Transient-Voltage Recorder offers high performance, yet the estimated cost of its electronic components is no more than $200 at 2003 prices.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nues up to 50 V in four channels at a rate\nof 20 MHz. That recorder contains a\ntrigger circuit that continuously compares the amplitudes of the signals on\nfour channels to a preset triggering\nthreshold. When a trigger signal is received, a volatile memory is filled with\ndata for a total time of 200 ms. After the\ndata are transferred to nonvolatile\nmemory, the recorder rearms itself\nwithin 400 ms to enable recording of\nsubsequent transients. Unfortunately,\nthe recorded data must be retrieved\nthrough a serial communication link.\nDepending on the amount of data\nrecorded, the memory can be filled before retrieval is completed. Although\nlarge amounts of data are recorded and\nretrieved, only a small part of the information (the selected parameters) is usually required.\nThe present transient-voltage recorder\nprovides the required information, without incurring the overhead associated\nwith the recording, storage, and retrieval\nof complete transient-waveform data. In\noperation, this apparatus processes transient voltage waveforms in real time to\nextract and record the selected parameters. An analog-to-digital converter that\noperates at a speed of as much as 100\nmegasamples per second is used to sample a transient waveform. A real-time\ncomparator and peak detector are implemented by use of fast field-programmable gate arrays.\nThe parameters extracted from the\nsamples and recorded are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Peak voltage;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Duration of each transient at 75 percent of peak voltage, in increments of\n10 ns;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Duration of each transient at 50 percent of peak voltage, in increments of\n10 ns;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Duration of rise from 10 to 90 percent\nof peak voltage;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Duration of fall from 90 to 10 percent\nof peak voltage; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Energy content of each transient\npulse.\nUnlike a traditional complete-waveform recorder, which typically records\nseveral thousand bytes per waveform,\n\n5\n\nthis apparatus stores fewer than 20 bytes\nper waveform. The bandwidth needed\nto transmit the data to a remote recording or control station is reduced correspondingly. In addition, the dead time\nbetween subsequent triggers of this apparatus is only about 0.1 ms \xe2\x80\x94 less than\na hundredth of that of the prior transient recorder.\nThis transient-voltage recorder can be\nconfigured for different input voltage\nranges to accommodate the expected\nmagnitudes of the transients to be monitored. Typical input ranges include \xc2\xb110\nV, \xc2\xb150 V, and \xc2\xb1100 V. The input termination can be either single-ended or differential and selectable among impedances\nof 50, 120, or 10 kilohms. Either a positive or a negative transient can trigger\n\nsampling, real-time processing, and\nrecording. Depending on the specific\nsetup, data in multiple channels could\nbe analyzed simultaneously, triggered by\nsignal from any one of the channels.\nA clock circuit is included to enable\naccurate time-stamping of any recorded\nwaveform. Time stamping is necessary if\na transient measured by this apparatus is\nto be correlated with measurements by\nsuch other apparatuses as a lightning-location system.\nThe power supply of the transient-voltage recorder includes backup batteries\nthat can maintain operation for as long\nas 15 days when main AC power is lost.\nDuring normal operation when AC\npower is available, the batteries are\ncharged automatically.\n\nThis work was done by Pedro Medelius of\nASRC Aerospace Corp. for Kennedy Space\nCenter.

Refer\nto KSC-12494.\n\nMeasuring Humidity in Sealed Glass Encasements\nThis noninvasive technique helps in the preservation of valuable documents.\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nA technique has been devised for\nmeasuring the relative humidity levels\nin the protective helium/water vapor\natmosphere in which the Declaration of\nIndependence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are encased behind glass panels on display at\nthe National Archives in Washington,\nDC. The technique is noninvasive: it\ndoes not involve penetrating the encasements (thereby risking contamination or damage to the priceless documents) to acquire samples of the\natmosphere. The technique could also\nbe applied to similar glass encasements\nused to protect and display important\ndocuments and other precious objects\nin museums.\nThe basic principle of the technique is\nstraightforward: An encasement is maintained at its normal display or operating\ntemperature (e.g., room temperature)\nwhile a portion of its glass front panel is\n\nchilled (see Figure 1) until condensed\nwater droplets become visible on the inside of the panel. The relative humidity\nof the enclosed atmosphere can then be\ndetermined as a known function of the\ndew point, the temperature below which\n\nFigure 1. A Thermoelectric Device rests on the\nencasement.\n\nFigure 2. A Thermoelectric Cooler assembly and instrumentation has seven thermocouples to measure\ntemperatures at different locations.\n\n6\n\nthe droplets condense.\nNotwithstanding the straightforwardness of the basic principle, careful attention to detail is necessary to enable accurate determination of the dew point. In\nthe initial application, the affected por-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\ntion of the glass panel was cooled by contact with an aluminum plate that was\ncooled by a thermoelectric module, the\nexhaust heat of which was dissipated by a\nheat sink cooled by a fan. A thermocouple was used to measure the interior\ntemperature of the aluminum plate, and\nsix other thermocouples were used to\nmeasure the temperatures at six locations on the cooled outer surface of the\nglass panel (see Figure 2). Thermal\ngrease was applied to the aluminum\nplate and the thermocouples to ensure\nclose thermal contact.\nPower was supplied to the thermoelec-\n\ntric module in small increments, based\non previous laboratory tests. A small\nflashlight and a magnifying glass were\nused to look for water droplets condensing on the inner surface of the glass. The\ntemperature readings of the thermocouples were taken during cool-down and\nupon observing condensation.\nIn determining the dew point, it was\nnecessary to make a correction for the\ndifferences between the temperatures\nmeasured on the chilled outer surface\nof the glass and the temperature of the\ninner surface, where the condensation\ntook place. The correction was derived\n\nfrom a laboratory test on a measurement setup that was nearly identical,\nexcept that the dew location on the\ninner surface was also instrumented\nwith a thermocouple. The test showed\nthat the temperature at the dew location on the inner surface of the glass\npanel was 0.9 C\xc2\xb0 above the temperature\ndetermined from the measurements on\nthe chilled outer surface of the panel.\nThis work was done by James W. West, Cecil\nG. Burkett, and Joel S. Levine of Langley Research Center.

As they age, they become susceptible to system malfunctions and fatigue. Unlike future aircraft that will\ninclude health-monitoring capabilities\nas integral parts in their designs, older\naircraft have not been so equipped.\nThe Adaptable Vehicle Health and\nUsage Monitoring System is designed to\nbe retrofitted into a preexisting fleet of\nmilitary and commercial aircraft, ships,\nor ground vehicles to provide them with\nstate-of-the-art health- and usage-monitoring capabilities. The monitoring system is self-contained, and the integration\nof it into existing systems entails limited\nintrusion. In essence, it has \xe2\x80\x9cbolt-on/\nbolt-off\xe2\x80\x9d simplicity that makes it easy to\ninstall on any preexisting vehicle or structure. Because the system is completely\n\nRDAU1\n\nRDAU2\n\nindependent of the vehicle, it can be certified for airworthiness as an independent system.\nThe purpose served by the health-monitoring system is to reduce vehicle operating costs and to increase safety and reliability. The monitoring system is a means to\nidentify damage to, or deterioration of, vehicle subsystems, before such damage or\ndeterioration becomes costly and/or disastrous. Frequent monitoring of a vehicle\nenables identification of the embryonic\nstages of damage or deterioration. The\nknowledge thus gained can be used to correct anomalies while they are still somewhat minor. Maintenance can be performed as needed, instead of having the\nneed for maintenance identified during\ncyclic inspections that take vehicles off\nduty even when there are no maintenance\nproblems. Measurements and analyses ac-\n\nRDAUn\n\nRDAU1\n\nRDAU2\n\nquired by the health-monitoring system\nalso can be used to analyze mishaps. Overall, vehicles can be made more reliable\nand kept on duty for longer times.\nFigure 1 schematically depicts the\nsystem as applied to a fleet of n vehicles. The system has three operational\nlevels. All communication between system components is by use of wireless\ntransceivers operating at frequencies\nnear 433 MHz. Electromagnetic-interference tests have demonstrated that\nthe radio-frequency emissions from the\ntransceivers do not influence civilian\n\nRDAUn\n\nLeft Main Landing Gear With RDAU\n\nVehicle 1\n\nCCU1\n\nCCUn\n\nVehicle n\n\nTCU\n\nMaintenance\nPersonnel\n\nOperations\nPersonnel\n\nManufacturers\n\nOthers\n\nFigure 1. The Adaptable Vehicle Health and Usage Monitoring System is characterized by three levels\nof operation and analysis.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nRDAU Mounted on Tow Fitting of\nLanding Gear\n\nFigure 2. An RDAU Mounted on a Landing Gear\nwas used to perform a rigorous test of the system.\n\n7\n\naircraft communication and navigation\nsystems.\nThe first level of the system includes\none or more remote data-acquisition\nunits (RDAUs) placed at different locations within each aircraft or other vehicle. An RDAU acquires, stores, and analyzes sensor data. The user has the\ncapability to define the number of inputs, type of sensors, sensor input characteristics, aggregate sampling rate, and\nacquisition period duration. This information is used to configure the sampling\ninterface and its associated multiplexed\neight-channel analog-to-digital converter. An RDAU can analyze measurements from each channel individually or\nfrom all channels fused together. Programmable data-acquisition circuitry\nand expert-system software trained to\nperformance baselines in each RDAU\nmake it possible to adapt the system to\nmany types of vehicles and structures.\nThe RDAU has been tested at temperatures from \xe2\x80\x9350 to +55 \xc2\xb0C. Pressure testing has verified that RDAUs could be\nused in non-environmentally-controlled\nspaces on aircraft at altitudes up to\n50,000 ft (15.24 km). Vibration tests\nhave verified that RDAUs can operate\nduring vibrations representative of those\nof commercial aircraft. The final vibrations used in the tests had an amplitude\nof 20 times normal Earth gravitational\nacceleration and a frequency of 2 kHz.\nThe second level of the system includes a\ncommand-and-control unit (CCU) in each\n\nvehicle. The CCU regulates the healthmonitoring activities in the vehicle. The\nCCU is a computer-based subsystem that\ncontrols communications to and from all\nRDAUs; regulates all RDAU measurement, collection, and analysis; and retrieves the results of all data-collection and\nanalysis performed by the RDAUs.\nThe third level of the system is a terminal collection unit (TCU). The TCU\nprovides the means to autonomously retrieve vehicle analysis results from all the\nCCUs or RDAUs of all vehicles. The\nTCU analyzes all results collected from\nall vehicles to identify any fleet-wide\nanomalies (e.g., all aircraft have the\nsame faulty bearing at a similar location). The TCU is used to develop the\nfinal summary of the vehicle health. The\nsummary is routed to the appropriate\nusers (e.g., maintenance workers and\nairline operations personnel).\nThe system can also serve as an infrastructure for performing tributary analyses: NASA Langley Research Center has\ndeveloped a parameterized fuzzy expertsystem algorithm that can be trained to\na user\xe2\x80\x99s subjective analysis of data. The\nexpert-system algorithm and other\nanalysis algorithms can be used at each\noperational level. The measurements\ncollected at the lowest level can be analyzed at that level. Analysis results are\nforwarded to next operational level, and\nthen all results are analyzed to ascertain\nglobal trends or anomalies for the prior\nlevel. This is repeated until all analyses\n\nare combined at the hierarchically highest level (e.g., the third level).\nThe trainable parameterized fuzzy expert system, the wireless communication\nbetween components, and the programmable digital interface make the healthmonitoring hardware and software infrastructure adaptable to many vehicles and\nstructures. Performing analysis at each\nlevel eliminates the need for transmitting and storing large volumes of collected measurements.\nThe RDAU hardware and the non-analytical portion of the software of the system have been flight-tested on the landing gear of Langley Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nBoeing 757 airplane (see Figure 2) \xe2\x8e\xaf the\nmost severe location on that airplane for\nmounting a health-monitoring device.\nDuring test flights, the CCU was located\nin the passenger section of the airplane.\nA portable TCU equipped with the\nnon-analytical capabilities of the TCU\nwas shown to function as intended in\ndownloading of data after flights.\nThis work was done by Stanley E. Woodart,\nKeith L. Woodman, and Neil C. Coffey of\nLangley Research Center and Bryant D.\nTaylor of Swales Corp. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1).\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

Refer to\nLAR-16516.\n\nMiniature Focusing Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer\nResolution is retained despite the reduction in size.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn improved miniature time-of-flight\nmass spectrometer has been developed\nin a continuing effort to minimize the\nsizes, weights, power demands, and\ncosts of mass spectrometers for such diverse applications as measurement of\nconcentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere, detecting poisonous gases\nin mines, and analyzing exhaust gases\nof automobiles. Advantageous characteristics of this mass spectrometer include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is simple and rugged.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relative to prior mass spectrometers, it\nis inexpensive to build.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is no need for precise alignment\nof its components.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Its mass range is practically unlimited.\n\n8\n\nPulsed\nElectron\nGun\n\nStream of Gas\nMoving Out of Page\n\nCharged-Particle\nDetector, Amplifier,\nand Counting Circuit\n\nTo\nComputer\n\nCylindrical Electrostatic Lenses\nPulsed\nElectron Beam\n\nFigure 1. This Miniature Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer utilizes charged-particle optics in conjunction with ion speeds smaller than those of similar prior instruments.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nMass Spectrum of Room Air\n\nCounting Rate\n\nN2\n\nO2\nAr\nCO2\nTime of Flight\nFigure 2. This Uncalibrated Mass Spectrum of air was acquired by use of the improved TOF-MS.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relative to prior mass spectrometers, it\noffers high sensitivity (ability to measure relative concentrations as small as\nparts per billion).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Its resolution is one dalton (one\natomic mass unit).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An entire mass spectrum is recorded in\na single pulse. (In a conventional mass\n\nspectrometer, a spectrum is recorded\nmass by mass.) The data-acquisition\nprocess takes only seconds.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is a lightweight, low-power, portable\ninstrument.\nAlthough time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs) have been miniaturized previously, their performances\n\nhave not been completely satisfactory.\nAn inherent adverse effect of miniaturization of a TOF-MS is a loss of resolution caused by reduction of the length\nof its flight tube. In the present improved TOF-MS, the adverse effect of\nshortening the flight tube is counteracted by (1) using charged-particle optics to constrain ion trajectories to the\nflight-tube axis while (2) reducing ion\nvelocities to increase ion flight times.\nIn the present improved TOF-MS, a\nstream of gas is generated by use of a hypodermic needle. The stream of gas is\ncrossed by an energy-selected, pulsed\nbeam of electrons (see Figure 1). The\nions generated by impingement of the\nelectrons on the gas atoms are then focused by three cylindrical electrostatic\nlenses, which constitute a segmented\nflight tube. After traveling along the\nflight tube, the ions enter a charged-particle detector. The output of the detector\nis fed to a counting circuit to obtain data\non the counting rate as a function of\ntime. Inasmuch as time of flight is directly proportional to the ion mass, a\nplot of the counting rate versus time of\nflight is equivalent to a mass spectrum\n(see Figure 2).\nThis work was done by Isik Kanik and Santosh Srivastava of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1)\nNPO-30611\n\nCryogenic High-Sensitivity Magnetometer\nSensitivity would be about a million times that of a flux-gate magnetometer.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA proposed magnetometer for use in a\ncryogenic environment would be sensitive enough to measure a magnetic-flux\ndensity as small as a picogauss (10-16\nTesla). In contrast, a typical conventional flux-gate magnetometer cannot\nmeasure a magnetic-flux density smaller\nthat about 1 microgauss (10-10 Tesla).\nOne version of this device, for operation near the low end of the cryogenic\ntemperature range, would include a\npiece of a paramagnetic material on a\nplatform, the temperature of which\nwould be controlled with a periodic variation. The variation in temperature\nwould be measured by use of a conventional germanium resistance thermometer. A superconducting coil would be\nwound around the paramagnetic material and coupled to a superconducting\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nquantum interference device (SQUID)\nmagnetometer.\nThe SQUID magnetometer would be\nused to measure the change in current in\nthe coil as a result of the change in temperature measured by the germanium resistance thermometer. The ratio between\nthe current change and the temperature\nchange would be computed, then used to\ninfer the ambient magnetic field. This inference would be drawn from a lookup\ntable established by prior calibration\nmeasurements performed at the same\nmean operating temperature.\nIn an alternative version of this magnetometer, for operation at a temperature near the high end of the cryogenic\nrange, the coil and the SQUID magnetometer would be made from a hightemperature superconductor and the\n\ncoil would be in the form of a thin film\ndeposited on the same substrate as that\nof the SQUID. The paramagnetic material would be inserted in a hole at the\ncenter of the coil. The temperature of\nthe whole substrate would then be modulated during measurements of the type\ndescribed above.\nBecause of the oscillatory temperature\nexcitation, this magnetometer would exhibit very little drift. The highest sensitivity and the lowest noise would be\nachieved by careful selection of the paramagnetic material and operating near\nthe Curie temperature of that material.\nAlthough the SQUID magnetometer\nand the superconducting coil must be\nkept cold, it would be possible to measure the magnetic field of a warm environment. For this purpose, the magne-\n\n9\n\ntometer could be kept at the required\nlow temperature in a nonmagnetic\nDewar flask, which could be brought to\nthe warm measurement location.\nWhile conventional SQUID magnetometers are routinely used to measure\nthe change in magnetic flux density with\nsimilar sensitivity, the proposed implementation allows the full sensitivity of\n\nSQUID to be used to measure a small\nstatic magnetic flux density. Another implementation method involves flipping\nthe pickup coil of a SQUID to measure\nthe ambient static field. Although such a\nmethod had been used before, it involves cumbersome mechanical actuators to flip the coil at cryogenic temperatures and the wire of the coil can work\n\nharden and break after repeated flipping. Because of the absence of moving\nparts in the proposed magnetometer, reliability is improved.\nThis work was done by Peter Day, Talso\nChui, and David Goodstein of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nTwo documents describe a prototype\nsystem of electrometers for measuring\nelectrostatic fields and electrostatic responses of soils on Mars and the Moon.\nThe electrodes of this electrometer are\nembedded in a wheel of an exploratory\nrobotic vehicle, utilizing the wheel motion to bring the electrodes into proximity or contact with the soil. Each electrode resides in one of two types of\nsensor modules: electric-field (ELF) or\ntriboelectric (TRIBO). In either type,\nwhat is measured is simply the electric\n\n10\n\ncharge induced on the electrode by exposure to the external distribution of\nelectrostatic charge. In an ELF module,\nthe electrode is bare and recessed radially from the wheel surface. The ELF sensor provides a measure of the charge on\na small patch of undisturbed soil as the\nwheel rolls forward. In a TRIBO module,\nthe electrode is only slightly recessed and\ncovered with a polymeric insulator flush\nwith the wheel surface. Through contact\nelectrification, the insulator exchanges\ncharge with the soil. There are five\n\nTRIBO sensors, each containing an insulator made of a different polymer. The\ncharge data gathered by the five TRIBO\nsensors can be used to determine how\nthe soil fits into a triboelectric series.\nThis work was done by Carlos I.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThin, transparent layers comprising\nmats of carbon nanotubes have been proposed for providing lateral (that is, inplane) electrical conductivities for collecting electric currents from the front\nsurfaces of the emitter layers of thin-film\nsolar photovoltaic cells. Traditionally,\nthin, semitransparent films of other electrically conductive materials (usually, indium tin oxide, zinc oxide, or cadmium\nsulfide) have been used for this purpose.\nAs in the cases of the traditional semitransparent conductive films, the currents collected by the nanotube layers\nwould, in turn, be further collected by\nfront metal contact stripes.\nDepending on details of a specific\nsolar-cell design, the layer of carbon\nnanotubes would be deposited in addition to, or instead of, a semitransparent\nlayer of one of these traditional conductive materials (see figure). The proposal\nis expected to afford the following advantages:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The electrical conductivity of the carbon-nanotube layer would exceed that\nof the corresponding semitransparent\nlayer of traditional electrically conductive material.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The greater electrical conductivity of\nthe carbon-nanotube layer would\nmake it possible to retain adequate lateral electrical conductivity while reducing the thickness of, or eliminating\nentirely, the traditional semitransparent conductive layer. As a consequence of thinning or elimination of\nthe traditional semitransparent conductive layer, less light would be absorbed, so that more of the incident\nlight would be available for photovoltaic conversion.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The greater electrical conductivity of\nthe carbon-nanotube layer would make\nit possible to increase the distance between front metal contact stripes, in addition to (or instead of) thinning or\neliminating the layer of traditional\nsemitransparent conductive material.\nConsequently, the fraction of solar-cell\narea shadowed by front metal contact\nstripes would be reduced \xe2\x80\x94 again,\nmaking more of the incident light available for photovoltaic conversion.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nA Layer of Carbon Nanotubes \xe2\x80\x94 instead of a traditional layer of indium tin oxide, zinc oxide, or cadmium sulfide \xe2\x80\x94 would conduct electric current from the front surface of the emitter layer to the front\nmetal contact stripe.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The electrical conductivities of individual carbon nanotubes can be so\nhigh that the mat of carbon nanotubes could be made sparse enough\nto be adequately transparent while affording adequate lateral electrical\nconductivity of the mat as a whole.\nThe thickness of the nanotube layer\nwould be chosen so that the layer\nwould contribute significant lateral\nelectrical conductivity, yet would be as\nnearly transparent as possible to incident light. A typical thickness for satisfying these competing requirements is\nexpected to lie between 50 and 100\nnm. The optimum thickness must be\ncalculated by comparing the lateral\nelectrical conductivity, the distance\nbetween front metal stripes, and the\namount of light lost by absorption in\nthe nanotube layer.\nThe diameters of carbon nanotubes\n\xe2\x80\x94 of the order of 10 nm \xe2\x80\x94 are smaller\nthan the typical wavelengths of the light\nabsorbed by solar cells. Carbon nanotubes can be made in either highly\nconductive \xe2\x80\x9cmetallic\xe2\x80\x9d form or in a semiconducting form; for the present purpose, the highly conductive form would\n\nbe best. Most preferable would be single-wall carbon nanotubes, which have\nthe smallest diameters. It would also be\npreferable to align all the carbon nanotubes parallel to the desired direction\nof conduction, but such alignment may\nbe difficult to achieve at low cost. Even\nwithout such alignment, it should be\npossible to attain adequate lateral electrical conductivity.\nDuring fabrication, the layer of carbon nanotubes could be deposited\n(e.g., from a liquid suspension) onto either the front surface of the solar-cell\nemitter layer or on the glass cover prior\nto attachment of the cover by use of an\nadhesive. In either case the carbon nanotubes would adhere to the deposition\nsurface by means of van der Waals\nforces.\nThis work was done by Geoffrey A. Landis\nof Glenn Research Center.

As a consequence of the unequal-arm aperture design, the antenna could be made smaller\nin one dimension, relative to a typical\nprior CP antenna that comprises a nearly\nsquare patch fed via an equal-crossed-arm\naperture. Hence, in designing a phased\narray of such antennas, the antennas\ncould be packed together more closely\nalong one dimension, making it possible\nto scan the beam radiated by the antenna\nover a wider angular range in a plane that\nincludes that dimension. Alternatively or\nin addition, one could lay out transmission lines in the extra spaces created by\nthe shortening in one dimension.\nIn designing a rectangular-patch CP antenna, one chooses the dimensions of the\npatch and of the crossed arms of the aperture to introduce a 90\xc2\xb0 phase shift between\nthe two orthogonal electromagnetic modes\nof the patch. In the case of a conventional\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cnearly square\xe2\x80\x9d design, the aperture arms\nare constrained to have equal dimensions,\nit is assumed that the value of the resonance quality factor (Q) is the same for\nboth modes, and the effects of the electromagnetic modes of the crossed aperture\narms are neglected. In designing an antenna according to the proposal, one allows the aperture arms to have unequal dimensions and does not assume equal Q\nvalues. Instead, one explicitly includes the\naperture modes in the calculations and assesses the overall effects (including possibly\nunequal Q values) on the patch modes and\nthe characteristics of the radiation.\nThe decision to allow unequal dimensions of both the patch and the aperture\narms gives the designer more degrees of\nfreedom than could be utilized to optimize the antenna. Among other things\nthat one seeks to do in optimization is to\nobtain an axial ratio as close to 1 as possible and an axial-ratio bandwidth as large\nas possible. (As used here, \xe2\x80\x9caxial ratio\xe2\x80\x9d\nsignifies the ratio between the radiated\npower polarized along one axis of symmetry of the antenna and the radiated\npower polarized along the other, perpen-\n\ndicular axis of symmetry of the antenna.\nAn axial ratio of exactly 1 corresponds to\nperfectly circular polarization. \xe2\x80\x9cAxialratio bandwidth\xe2\x80\x9d signifies the width of\nthe frequency band over which the axial\nratio is acceptably close to 1.)\nIn designing an antenna as proposed,\nto compensate for an axial ratio that deviates from 1 by an unacceptably large\namount, the dimensions of the aperture\narms along one direction could be adjusted in tandem with the corresponding\northogonal patch dimension. For example, if the vertical dimension of the patch\nwere modified, then the horizontal dimensions of the aperture arms would be\nadjusted accordingly. Consequently, an\nadditional benefit of the proposed design\napproach would be that the axial ratio of\nan antenna would be closer to 1, and the\naxial-ratio bandwidth would be greater,\nrelative to the corresponding parameters\nof the prior \xe2\x80\x9cnearly square\xe2\x80\x9d antenna.\nThis work was done by Larry Epp of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nNPO-30508\n\nLC Circuits for Diagnosing Embedded Piezoelectric Devices\nFailures are readily identified through changes in resonance frequencies.\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nA recently invented method of nonintrusively detecting faults in piezoelectric devices involves measurement of\nthe resonance frequencies of inductorcapacitor (LC) resonant circuits. The\nmethod is intended especially to enable diagnosis of piezoelectric sensors,\nactuators, and sensor/actuators that\nare embedded in structures and/or are\ncomponents of multilayer compositematerial structures.\nIn this method, a small induction\ncoil is connected to each piezoelectric\ncomponent that is embedded in the affected structure, composite material,\nor component by way of the electrical\nleads used for the basic sensor/actuator function. This connection is made\nmanually or remotely during diagnosis\nof the piezoelectric component. Thus,\nwhat is formed, in addition to the basic\n\n12\n\nsensor/actuator circuit, is an LC resonant circuit, in which the piezoelectric\ncomponent acts as the capacitor. The\ninductance of the coil does not vary\nappreciably under most conditions,\nbut the capacitance (and, hence, the\nresonance frequency) changes significantly if the piezoelectric device fails.\nHence, a significant change in the resonance frequency can be taken as an\nindication of a failure of the piezoelectric device.\nThe resonance frequency can be\nmeasured in a conventional manner, either by induction or by direct connection via electrical leads. If a structure\ncontains multiple embedded piezoelectric devices and the LC circuit of each\npiezoelectric device has a unique assigned resonance frequency, then one\ncan rapidly and easily interrogate all\n\nthe devices in a spectral scan over the\nrange of assigned resonance frequencies. In the resulting spectral plot, a significant deviation of any of the resonance peaks from its assigned\nfrequency indicates the failure of the\ncorresponding piezoelectric device.\nThis work was done by Richard L.

The development\nof nanowire-based thermoelectric de-\n\nvices could lead to novel power-generating, cooling, and sensing devices that\noperate at relatively low currents and\nhigh voltages.\nRecent work on the theory of thermoelectric devices has led to the expectation that the performance of such a device could be enhanced if the diameter\nof the wires could be reduced to a point\n\nFigure 1. Thermoelectric Nanowires of n-Type Bi2Te3 with a diameter of 10 nm and length of 40 \xce\xbcm\nwere grown in an alumina template. The thermoelectric material was allowed to grow onto the top of\nthe template, forming caps that make contact with each other. In a production version, the overgrowth\nand part of the template would be polished away and metal contacts deposited as in Figure 2.\n\nMetal Contact for Series Connection of Two Bundles\n\nBundles of Nanowires Grown in Alumina\nTemplate:\nn-Type\np-Type\n\nMetallic Layer for Electrochemical Growth\nand for Series Connection of Bundles.\nAlumina Template\nFigure 2. Bundles of Nanowires would be grown electrochemically in an alumina template. The\nnanowires in each bundle would be electrically connected in parallel and the bundles electrically connected in series by metal contacts grown electrochemically on the ends of the bundles.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nwhere quantum confinement effects increase charge-carrier mobility (thereby\nincreasing the Seebeck coefficient) and\nreduce thermal conductivity. In addition, even in the absence of these effects, the large aspect ratios (length of\nthe order of tens of microns \xc3\xb7 diameter\nof the order of tens of nanometers) of\nnanowires would be conducive to the\nmaintenance of large temperature differences at small heat fluxes. The predicted net effect of reducing diameters\nto the order of tens of nanometers\nwould be to increase its efficiency by a\nfactor of \xe2\x89\x883.\nNanowires made of thermoelectric materials and devices that comprise arrays of\nsuch nanowires can be fabricated by electrochemical growth of the thermoelectric\nmaterials in templates that contain suitably dimensioned pores (10 to 100 nm in\ndiameter and 1 to 100 \xce\xbcm long). The\nnanowires can then be contacted in bundles to form devices that look similar to\nconventional thermoelectric devices, except that a production version may contain nearly a billion elements (wires) per\nsquare centimeter, instead of fewer than a\nhundred as in a conventional bulk thermoelectric device or fewer than 100,000 as\nin a microdevice.\nIt is not yet possible to form contacts\nwith individual nanowires. Therefore,\nin fabricating a nanowire thermoelectric device, one forms contacts on\nnanowires in bundles of the order of\n10-\xce\xbcm wide. The fill factor for the\ncross-section of a typical bundle is\nabout 1/2. Nanowires have been grown\nin alumina templates with pore diameters of 100 and 40 nm. To ensure that\nevery pore in a template is filled with a\nnanowire, one allows the thermoelectric material to grow onto the top of\nthe template (see Figure 1), then polishes the template back to a level where\nevery pore is filled.\nAfter polishing, contacts on bundles\nof nanowires can be made by electrochemical deposition of nickel or another\nsuitable metal. Figure 2 depicts a proposed configuration for growing bundles of n- and p-type nanowires, electrically connecting the wires of each\nbundle in parallel, and electrically connecting successive bundles in series to\nmake a thermoelectric device. The bundles would be suitably masked to allow\n\n13\n\nelectrochemical growth only in the desired areas. For a given bundle, the\nmetal caps would be made to electrochemically grow out from the exposed\nends of the nanowires, eventually merging to form one metal contact.\nThis work was done by Alexander Borshchevsky, Jean-Pierre Fleurial, Jennifer Herman, and Margaret Ryan of Caltech for\n\n14\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A specific application is for Stirling-cycle/linear-alternator electric-power systems coupled to radioisotope general-purpose\nheat sources. GPHRAD affords capabilities and options to account for thermophysical properties (thermal conductivity, density) of either metal-alloy\nor composite radiator materials.\nGPHRAD also enables specification of\na heat-pipe radiator design with a radial location of the embedded heatpipe condenser section determined numerically so that minimum radiator\narea is obtained. Alternatively, the user\ncan specify a radial location of the heatpipe condenser section for easier assembly with other components. In this\ncase, GPHRAD determines the tradeoff\ncost in increased radiator area for this\nchoice. A third option is to design a radiator without heat pipes, with heat\nflowing radially outward from the cylindrical cold section of the Stirling power\nsystem. A major subroutine, TSCALC,\ncalculates an equilibrium sink temperature for a radiator, taking account of\nthe solar absorptivity and thermal emissivity of the radiator surface, the spacecraft-to-Sun distance expressed in astronomical units (AU), the angle at\nwhich solar radiation is incident on the\nradiator surface, and the view factor to\nspace of the radiator surface and the\ninfrared absorptivity-to-emissivity ratio\nfor planetary thermal radiation, if any.\nThe sink temperature, along with the\nheat-source temperature and properties of the radiator material, serve as inputs to the GPHRAD code, which then\ncalculates dimensions of, and temperature distribution within the radiator for\na required heat-rejection load at given\nheat-rejection source temperature,\nsuch as the Stirling power system \xe2\x80\x9ccold\xe2\x80\x9d\nside temperature.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nMulticomponent, rare-earth-doped,\nperovskite-type thermal-barrier coating\nmaterials have been developed in an effort\nto obtain lower thermal conductivity,\ngreater phase stability, and greater hightemperature capability, relative to those of\nthe prior thermal-barrier coating material\nof choice, which is yttria-partially stabilized\nzirconia. As used here, \xe2\x80\x9cthermal-barrier\ncoatings\xe2\x80\x9d (TBCs) denotes thin ceramic layers used to insulate air-cooled metallic\ncomponents of heat engines (e.g., gas turbines) from hot gases. These layers are\ngenerally fabricated by plasma spraying or\nphysical vapor deposition of the TBC materials onto the metal components.\nA TBC as deposited has some porosity,\nwhich is desirable in that it reduces the\nthermal conductivity below the intrinsic\nthermal conductivity of the fully dense\nform of the material. Undesirably, the\nthermal conductivity gradually increases\nbecause the porosity gradually decreases as\na consequence of sintering during hightemperature service. Because of these and\nother considerations such as phase transformations, the maximum allowable service temperature for yttria-partially stabilized zirconia TBCs lies in the range of\nabout 1,200 to 1,300 \xc2\xb0C. In contrast, the\npresent multicomponent, rare-earthdoped, perovskite-type TBCs can withstand higher temperatures.\nA material of this type comprises the following ingredients:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The base material is a high-melting-temperature perovskite oxide \xe2\x80\x94 a compound having the chemical formula\nABO3, where A is a metal cation having a\nvalence of +2 and B is a metal cation hav-\n\ning a valence of +4. Examples of A include Sr, Ba, Ca, and variable valence\nrare-earth and transition metals; examples of B include Zr and Hf.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The base material is doped with a pair\nor multiple pairs of highly stable oxides\nof general chemical formula M2O3,\nwhere M is a metal cation of valence +3.\nThe pairing of the oxides is such that\nthey are related as electron donor and\nacceptor, respectively. The paired oxides can be divided into two groups, denoted I and II. Group I comprises scandia and ytterbia. The radii of their\ntrivalent cations are smaller than those\nof zirconia and hafnia. The group-I\ncations are believed to typically become\nincorporated into B sites, where they\nare further believed to act as electron\nacceptors.\nGroup II comprises\nneodymia, samaria, gadolinia, and lanthania. The radii of their trivalent\ncations are larger than that of yttria.\nThe group-II cations are believed to\ntypically become incorporated into A\nsites, where they are further believed to\nact as electron donors. The incorporation of the dopant trivalent cations into\nA and B sites enhances the stability of\nthe base material phase and promotes\nthe formation of significantly higher\nconcentrations of immobile extended\ndefects and clusters of defects, thereby\ngreatly reducing the intrinsic thermal\nconductivity and the rate of sintering.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Yttria can be included as a phase stabilizer in addition to, or instead of, the\naforementioned dopant oxides.\nIn a preferred composition, the total\nconcentration of yttria and/or the other\n\nphase-stabilizing oxides lies between 4\nand 30 mole percent. Ytterbia is favored\nover scandia as the group-I oxide because of the high cost of scandia. Alternatively, scandia in a concentration of as\nmuch as 20 percent of that of yttria can\nbe employed to overdope the group-I\noxide. Other alternative formulations\nare also possible.\nCompositions tested to date include\nSrZrO3 + yttria (up to 6 mole percent) +\ngroup-I oxide (ytterbia) up to 2 mole\npercent + group-II oxide (gadolinia) up\nto 2 mole percent. Pre-sintering thermal\nconductivities, as determined by a laser\nheat-flux test at an initial surface temperature of about 3,000 \xc2\xb0F (about 1,650 \xc2\xb0C),\nhave ranged between 0.6 and 0.8 W/m\xe2\x8b\x85K.\nTest data have also indicated that sintering essentially ceases after 20 hours. The\nthermal conductivities in the cases of\ncompositions that include the paired\ndoping oxides have been found to range\nfrom about a third to half of the thermal\nconductivities of undoped SrZrO3 and of\nSrZrO3 doped with yttria only.

The additives can be incorporated in different\nforms:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A solution of an amide acid or an\nimide of a PERA can be added to a\n\nsolution of phenylethynyl-containing\noligomer, polymer, co-oligomer, or\ncopolymer; or\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An imide powder of a PERA can be\nmixed with a dry powder of a phenyl-\n\n17\n\nethynyl-containing oligomer, polymer,\nco-oligomer, or copolymer.\nThe effect of a given PERA on the\nprocessability and other properties of the\nresin system depends on whether the\nPERA is used in the amide acid or an\nimide form. With proper formulation,\nthe PERA reduces the melt viscosity of the\nresin and thereby reduces the\nprocessing pressures needed to form the\nadhesive bonds, consolidate filled or unfilled moldings, or fabricate fiber-reinforced composite laminates. During thermal cure, a PERA reacts with itself as well\nas with the phenylethynyl-containing host\nresin and thereby becomes chemically incorporated into the resin system.\n\nThe effects of the PERA on mechanical properties, relative to those of the\nhost resin, depend on the amount of\nPERA used. Typically, the incorporation\nof the PERA results in (1) increases in\nthe glass-transition temperature (Tg),\nmodulus of elasticity, and parameters\nthat characterize behavior under compression, and (2) greater retention of\nthe aforementioned mechanical properties at elevated temperatures without (3)\nsignificant reduction of toughness or\ndamage tolerance.\nOf the formulations tested thus far,\nthe ones found to yield the best overall\nresults were those for which the host\nresin was the amide acid form of a\n\nO\n\nO\nH2N\n\nNH2\n\n+\n\n+\n\nO\n\nC\n\nO\n\nC\n\nPE\nO\n\nO\nNMP\n23 \xc2\xb0C\nN2\n\nGlacial\nAcetic Acid\n\nMixture of Amide Acid Products\n\nReflux\n\nNMP/Toluene\nReflux\nN2\n\nO\nWhere PE = 5-\n\nMixture of Imide Products\n(PERA\xe2\x80\x931)\nC\n\nC\nC\n\nor 4-\n\nC\n\nO\n\n, 4-\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\nPERA-1 Is a Mixture of either amide acids or imides, depending upon which synthesis route is followed.\n\n18\n\nphenylethynyl-terminated imide (PETI)\nco-oligomer having a molecular weight\nof 5,000 g/mole [hence, designated\nPETI-5] and a PERA denoted as PERA-1.\nPETI-5 was made from 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2,4\xe2\x80\xb24\xe2\x80\xb2-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride, 3,4\xe2\x80\xb2-oxydianiline\n(3,4\xe2\x80\xb2-ODA),\n1,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy) benzene (1,3-APB), and\n4-phenylethynylphthalic\nanhydride\n(PEPA). PERA-1 was made from 3,5-diamino-4\xe2\x80\xb2-phenylethynylbenzophenon\nand equimolar amounts of phthalic anhydride and PEPA.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nShapes different from the traditional\nones have been proposed for face worm\ngears and for conical and cylindrical\nworms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes are based on the concept\nof generating a face worm gear surface\nby use of a tilted head cutter instead of\nby the traditional use of a hob. (As used\n\nhere, \xe2\x80\x9chead cutter\xe2\x80\x9d is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.)\nThe gear-surface-generation equipment\nwould be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In\ncomparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted head cutter according to the proposal would be larger,\n\nFace Worm Gear\n\nCylindrical Worm\n\nFACE WORM GEAR DRIVE\n\nRotation of\nCradle\n\nWorm\nRotation of\nWorm\n\nCradle\n\nTilted\nHead Cutter\nRotation of\nHead Cutter\nSIDE VIEW OF GEOMETRY OF GENERATION OF WORM\n\nCradle\n\nRotation of\nHead Cutter\n\nTilted\nHead Cutter\n\nFace\nWorm Gear\n\nSIDE VIEW OF GEOMETRY OF GENERATION OF FACE WORM GEAR\n\nA Face Worm Gear and a Cylindrical Worm that meshes with it would be fabricated by use of tilted\nhead cutters.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\ncould be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation\nof gear surfaces with greater precision\nand greater productivity.\nA face worm gear would be generated\n(see figure) by use of a tilted head cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of\nwhich would have straight-line profiles.\nThe tilt of the head cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to\nthe groove being cut or ground.\nA worm to mesh with the face worm\ngear would be generated by use of a\ntilted head cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades\nor grinding surfaces of the head cutter\nwould have a parabolic profile and\nwould deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm\ngear. The shortest distance between the\nworm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide\na parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive.\nThe small mismatch between the\nprofiles of the face-worm-gear and\nworm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in\nthe worm gear drive. The parabolic\nfunction of transmission errors could\nabsorb discontinuous linear functions\nof transmission errors caused by errors\nof alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are\nmain sources of noise and vibration in\ngear drives.\nThe main advantage of using tilted\nhead cutters is that cutting speeds are\nindependent of the shape-generation\nprocesses, making it possible to choose\ncutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of\nfinished parts.\nThe profile of the cutting or grinding\nsurface and the machine-tool settings for\nthe position and orientation of a head\ncutter would be derived from the theoretical shape generated by a hob. The\nderivation would be effected by use of an\nalgorithm that takes account of the\ntilted-head-cutter geometry and enforces\n\n19\n\nthe requirements for meshing and noninterference.\nA tooth-contact-analysis computer\nprogram has been developed for simulation of meshing and contact of the\nproposed worms and face worm gears.\nIn a test case, the program showed that,\nas desired, the function of transmission\nerrors would be a parabolic function of\nlow magnitude, the contact would be localized, and the path of contact would\n\nbe longitudinal in the sense that it\nwould lie along the gear-tooth surfaces.\nThe program also showed that the bearing contact region would be free of\nareas of severe contact stresses and that\nthe contact ratio would be larger than 3\n(signifying that at any given instant,\nthere would be at least 3 pairs of teeth\nin contact).\nThis work was done by Faydor L.

The method would be applicable\nto robots that include rigid, semirigid, or\nflexible inflated shells, including those\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cbeach-ball rover\xe2\x80\x9d type, variants of\nwhich have been described in several\nprevious NASA Tech Briefs articles.\nA prior method, to which the method\nnow proposed would be an alternative,\nwas described in \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Beach-Ball\xe2\x80\x99 Robotic\nRovers\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-19272), NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 19, No. 11 (November 1995), page\n83. To recapitulate: Three diametral\ntethers approximately perpendicular to\neach other would be attached to the\nshell, effectively defining an approximate Cartesian coordinate system within\nthe shell. A control box containing motors and power and control circuits\nwould move itself along the tethers and\nadjust the lengths of the tethers in a coordinated fashion to shift the center of\ngravity and thereby cause the shell to roll\nin a desired direction.\nThe method now proposed calls for\nsuspending a payload by use of four or\nmore cables that would be anchored to\nthe inner surface of the sphere. In this\nmethod, the anchor points would not be\ndiametrally opposite points defining\nCartesian axes. The payload, which includes the functional analog of the\naforementioned control box, would contain winches that would shorten or\nlengthen the cables in a coordinated\nmanner to shift the position of the payload within the shell.\nIn a typical case, the locomotion system would include four cables an-\n\n20\n\nSpherical Shell\n\nPayload\n\nCable Anchor (One of Four)\n\nSupporting Cable\n(One of Four)\n\nThe Payload Would Contain Winches that would extend some cables while retracting others to move\nitself to a specified position within the spherical shell.\n\nchored at approximately the corners of\na regular tetrahedron (see figure). Optionally, one could use more than four\ncables for redundancy against potential\nfailure and/or as a means of distributing the weight of the payload to multiple anchor points to reduce localized\nstress on the spherical shell. The\narrangement of anchor points would\nnot be critical as long as they defined at\nleast three different axes of motion in\nat least two different planes; hence, the\nproposed method would afford robustness of motion control in the face of deformation of the spherical shell.\nSimple wires could be used to connect\nthe payload to any sensors mounted on\nthe outer or inner surface of the shell.\nThe wires would have to be long enough\nto reach the maximum distance, and\nwould have to hang slack when the distance was less. Because there would be\nlittle rotation between the payload and\nthe spherical shell, it is unlikely that the\nwires would become tangled; however,\none might wish to include spring-loaded\n\nretractors to minimize the probability of\nentanglement.\nIn the case of a flexible shell, all the\ncables supporting the payload could be\nretracted or extended to some extent to\nincrease or decrease, respectively, the\npressure of gas inside the shell. Another\noption would be to include springloaded supporting cables not connected\nto winches, in addition to those that\nwere connected to winches; this option\nmay make it possible to reduce the number of winches while obtaining an adequate range of motion.\nYet another option would be to use\nrigid rods and linear actuators instead of\ncables and winches. However, rods and\nlinear actuators would probably weigh\nmore than would cables and winches.\nMoreover, this option would not be compatible with a flexible shell.\nThis work was done by James Lux of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Although Parylene C cannot be\npatterned lithographically like photoresists, it nevertheless extends the range of\nprocessing options by offering a set of\nproperties that are suitable for microfabrication and are complementary to\nthose of photoresists. The compatibility\nof Parylene C with several microfabrication processes was demonstrated in experiments in which a thin film of Parylene C was deposited on a silicon wafer,\nthen several thin metal films were deposited and successfully patterned, utilizing the Parylene C pads as a sacrificial\nlayer.\n\nThe term \xe2\x80\x9cparylene\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a contraction of\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoly(para-xylene)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 denotes a family of\nvapor-deposited polymers.

Heretofore,\nparylenes have been used as conformal\ncoating materials in diverse applications.\nThe unique combinations of processing properties of Parylene C that make it\nsuitable for use in microfabrication are\nthe following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can be deposited to uniform sub-micron thickness.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is highly resistant to solvents and,\ntherefore, able to survive wet processing.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It can easily be patterned or removed\nby use of oxygen plasma.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Because it cannot be easily patterned\nor removed by means other than oxygen plasma, it can withstand many dry\netching processes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It has little or no outgassing and is fully\nfunctional at cryogenic temperatures.\nThis work was done by Michael Beamesderfer\nof Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

The wires fabricated by this method could be used as simple electrical conductors or as transducers\nin sensors. Depending upon electrodeposition conditions and the compositions of\nthe electroplating solutions in specific applications, the wires could be made of\nmetals, alloys, metal oxides, semiconductors, or electrically conductive polymers.\nIn this method, one uses fabrication\nprocesses that are standard in the semiconductor industry. These include cleaning, dry etching, low-pressure chemical\nvapor deposition, lithography, dielectric\ndeposition, electron-beam lithography,\nand metallization processes as well as the\nelectrochemical deposition process used\nto form the wires. In a typical case of fabrication of a circuit that includes electrodes between which microscopic wires\nare to be formed on a silicon substrate,\n\n21\n\nthe fabrication processes follow a standard\nsequence until just before the fabrication\nof the microscopic wires.\nThen, by use of a thermal SiO-deposition technique, the electrodes and the\nsubstrate surface areas in the gaps between them are covered with SiO. Next,\nthe SiO is electron-beam patterned, then\nreactive-ion etched to form channels having specified widths (typically about 1 \xce\xbcm\nor less) that define the widths of the wires\nto be formed. Drops of an electroplating\nsolution are placed on the substrate in\nthe regions containing the channels thus\n\nformed, then the wires are electrodeposited from the solution onto the exposed portions of the electrodes and into\nthe channels. The electrodeposition is a\nroom-temperature, atmospheric-pressure process.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe phrase, \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-layered architecture for semiconductor silicon carbide\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cCLASSiC\xe2\x80\x9d) denotes a method of\nbatch fabrication of microelectromechanical and semiconductor devices\nfrom bulk silicon carbide. CLASSiC is\nthe latest in a series of related methods\ndeveloped in recent years in continuing\nefforts to standardize SiC-fabrication\nSiC Pressure Sensors\n\nprocesses. CLASSiC encompasses both\ninstitutional and technological innovations that can be exploited separately or\nin combination to make the manufacture of SiC devices more economical. Examples of such devices are piezoresistive\npressure sensors, strain gauges, vibration\nsensors, and turbulence-intensity sensors\nfor use in harsh environments (e.g.,\nSiC Inertia Sensors\n\nhigh-temperature, high-pressure, corrosive atmospheres).\nThe institutional innovation is to\nmanufacture devices for different customers (individuals, companies, and/or\nother entities) simultaneously in the\nsame batch. This innovation is based on\nutilization of the capability for fabrication, on the same substrate, of multiple\n\nSiC Anemometer\n\nP-type SiC Cantilever beam\nDiaphragm\nMetallization\n\nInertial Mass\nPiezoresistors\nMetallization\n\nPiezoresistors\n\nP-type Substrate\nN-type Piezoresistors\nContact Metallization\nOxide\n\nTwo Pressure Sensors, Two Accelerometers, and an Anemometer were fabricated on the same SiC substrate to demonstrate the capability for simultaneous\nbatch fabrication of devices that perform different functions. Cross-sectional views of devices are also shown.\n\n22\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nSiC devices having different functionalities (see figure). Multiple customers\ncan purchase shares of the area on the\nsame substrate, each customer\xe2\x80\x99s share\nbeing apportioned according to the\ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s production-volume requirement. This makes it possible for multiple customers to share costs in a common foundry, so that the capital\nequipment cost per customer in the inherently low-volume SiC-product market can be reduced significantly.\nOne of the technological innovations\nis a five-mask process that is based on an\nestablished set of process design rules.\nThe rules provide for standardization of\nthe fabrication process, yet are flexible\nenough to enable multiple customers to\nlay out masks for their portions of the\nSiC substrate to provide for simultaneous batch fabrication of their various\ndevices. In a related prior method, denoted multi-user fabrication in silicon\ncarbide (MUSiC), the fabrication\nprocess is based largely on surface micromachining of poly SiC. However, in\nMUSiC one cannot exploit the superior\nsensing, thermomechanical, and elec-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\ntrical properties of single-crystal 6H-SiC\nor 4H-SiC. As a complement to MUSiC,\nthe CLASSiC five-mask process can be\nutilized to fabricate multiple devices in\nbulk single-crystal SiC of any polytype.\nThe five-mask process makes fabrication less complex because it eliminates\nthe need for large-area deposition and\nremoval of sacrificial material.\nOther innovations in CLASSiC pertain to selective etching of indium tin\noxide and aluminum in connection\nwith multilayer metallization. One\nmajor characteristic of bulk micromachined microelectromechanical devices\nis the presence of three-dimensional\n(3D) structures. Any 3D recesses that already exist at a given step in a fabrication process usually make it difficult to\napply a planar coat of photoresist for\nmetallization and other subsequent\nprocess steps. To overcome this difficulty, the CLASSiC process includes a\nreversal of part of the conventional\nflow: Metallization is performed before\nthe recesses are etched.\nThe metallization is followed by the\ndeposition and lift-off of aluminum\n\nand indium tin oxide etch masks on the\nentire planar SiC substrate surface except where the recesses are to be created. After etching of the recesses, the\naluminum and indium tin oxide etch\nmasks are selectively etched to leave a\nstack of underlying metals (example, titanium, tantalum silicide, and platinum). Thus, the aluminum and indium tin oxide serve as protective\nlayers for the metallization while also\nfunctioning as etch masks during deep\nreactive-ion etching to create the desired 3D structures. After removal of\nthe aluminum and indium tin oxide,\nwires can be bonded onto the top platinum layer to provide for transition of\nelectrical signals to/from the device.\nThis work was done by Robert S. Okojie of\nGlenn Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nMicrowave ablation in the form of microwave energy applied to a heart muscle\nby a coaxial catheter inserted in a vein in\nthe groin area can be used to heat and kill\ndiseased heart cells. A microwave catheter\nhas been developed to provide deep myocardial ablation to treat ventricular\ntachycardia by restoring appropriate electrical activity within the heart and eliminating irregular heartbeats. The resulting\nmicrowave catheter design, which is now\nbeing developed for commercial use in\ntreating ventricular tachycardia, can be\nmodified to treat prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Inasmuch as the occurrence of BPH is increasing \xe2\x80\x94 currently 350,000 operations per\nyear are performed in the United States\nalone to treat this condition \xe2\x80\x94 this microwave catheter has significant commercial potential.\nThe microwave operating frequency\naffects the heating depth. An electrophysiologist will be able to take advantage of the physics of depth of penetration (in particular, the variations of\nconductivity and permittivity of tissue\nwith frequency) to focus the microwave\nbeam. The power level and delivery time\nalso affect the balance between the increase in heat (due to the absorption of\nmicrowave energy) and the loss of heat\n(due to conduction away from targeted\ncells). A computer program that simulates the heating profile has been written\nto assist in determining the balance\nneeded to necrose targeted cells while\nsaving non-targeted cells.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nThere are several variations of microwave\nradiators suitable for treating specific regions of the prostate or the prostate as a\nwhole. The following three configurations\nare suitable for treating specific conditions\nand specific locations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Single Antenna Within the Urethra\nA single antenna radiates within the\nurethra. A urethra catheter can be made\nto include a phase-change material surrounding the radiation tip to prevent a\nsignificant temperature rise without need\nfor a water cooling system. The phasechange material must, of course, be\nnearly transparent to the microwave radiation. This material provides localized\ncooling to protect the urethra from damage, but permits microwave heating to\noccur beyond the urethra, into the\nprostate. For treatment over the entire\nprostate, or over large regions of the\nprostate, it may be necessary to use several throwaway catheters because one\nmay not contain sufficient phase-change\nmaterial. Calculations have shown the\nfeasibility of this approach, provided that\na phase-change material that has the desired characteristics can be found.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple Colon Antennas\nMultiple colon catheter antennas can\nbe phased and directed toward the\nprostate to provide localized temperature gradients in the regions of the\nprostate located near the colon. Cooling\nmust be provided to protect the colon\nand the intervening tissue. Prostate cancer often begins in the prostate near the\ncolon and should be treatable with this\n\ntechnique. Computer simulations show\nthat by adjusting the locations of the microwave radiators and the phases of their\nmicrowave signals, the heating centers in\nthe prostate can be adjusted to necrose\ncritical regions only.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Single Urethra Antenna and Two Colon\nAntennas\nCombinations of urethra and colon\nmicrowave radiators can be used to provide treatment appropriate to specific\nproblems. Generally, one microwave\ncatheter in the urethra, when working\ntogether with one or more catheters in\nthe colon, can provide localized heating to satisfy most requirements. By adjustment of frequency, phase, directionality, and duration of the microwave\nradiation, one can select from among a\nwide array of heating profiles in the\nprostate. Computer simulations indicate that these three antennas can be\nproperly phased together for focusing\nthe heated region.\nLaboratory tests of the single urethra\nantenna and two colon antennas are\nnow underway, using phantom material\nto represent the prostate gland.\nThis work was done by G. Dickey Arndt\nand Phong Ngo of Johnson Space Center,\nJ. R.

Refer to MSC-23049.\n\n25\n\nPhysical Sciences\nFerroelectric Devices Emit Charged Particles and Radiation\nCompact, lightweight, low-power sources could be useful in numerous applications.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nDevices called \xe2\x80\x9csolid-state ferroelectric-based sources\xe2\x80\x9d (SSFBSs) are under\ndevelopment as sources of electrons,\nions, ultraviolet light, and x-rays for diverse applications in characterization\nand processing of materials. Whereas\nheretofore it has been necessary to use a\ndifferent device to generate each of the\naforementioned species of charged particles or radiation, a single SSFBS can be\nconfigured and operated to selectively\ngenerate any of the species as needed\nusing a single source. Relative to comparable prior sources based, variously, on\nfield emission, thermionic emission, and\ngaseous discharge plasmas, SSFBSs demand less power, and are compact and\nlightweight.\nAn SSFBS exploits the unique physical\ncharacteristics of a ferroelectric material\nin the presence of a high-frequency\npulsed electric field. The basic building\nblock of an SSFBS is a ferroelectric cathode \xe2\x80\x94 a ferroelectric wafer with a solid\nelectrode covering its rear face and a\ngrid electrode on its front face (see figure). The application of a voltage pulse\n\xe2\x80\x94 typically having amplitude of several\nkilovolts and duration of several\nnanoseconds \xe2\x80\x94 causes dense surface\nplasma to form near the grid wires on\nthe front surface.\nThe shape of the applied voltage waveform determines the characteristics of\nthe emitted charged particles and radiation and can be tailored to maximize the\nyield of electrons or ions.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA dusty-plasma apparatus is being investigated as means of accelerating\nnanometer- and micrometer-sized particles. Applications for the dusty-plasma\nparticle accelerators fall into two classes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simulation of a variety of rapidly moving dust particles and micrometeoroids in outer-space environments\nthat include micrometeoroid streams,\ncomet tails, planetary rings, and nebulae and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deposition or implantation of nanoparticles on substrates for diverse industrial\npurposes that could include hardening,\nincreasing thermal insulation, altering\noptical properties, and/or increasing\npermittivities of substrate materials.\nRelative to prior apparatuses used for\nsimilar applications, dusty-plasma particle accelerators offer such potential advantages as smaller size, lower cost, less\ncomplexity, and increased particle flux\ndensities.\nA dusty-plasma particle accelerator\nexploits the fact that an isolated particle\nimmersed in plasma acquires a net electric charge that depends on the relative\nmobilities of electrons and ions. Typically, a particle that is immersed in a\nlow-temperature, partially ionized gas,\nwherein the average kinetic energy of\nelectrons exceeds that of ions, causes\nthe particle to become negatively\ncharged. The particle can then be accelerated by applying an appropriate electric field. A dusty-plasma particle accelerator (see figure) includes a plasma\nsource such as a radio-frequency induction discharge apparatus containing (1)\na shallow cup with a biasable electrode\nto hold the particles to be accelerated\nand (2) a holder for the substrate on\nwhich the particles are to impinge. Depending on the specific design, a pair of\nelectrostatic-acceleration grids between\nthe substrate and discharge plasma can\nbe used to both collimate and further\n\n28\n\nSubstrate\n\nHigh-Energy Microparticle or Nanoparticle Beam\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\n\nAcceleration\nGrids\n\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\nPlasma Source\n\nPlasma\nMicroparticles or\nNanoparticles\n\n(Magnetic Grid)\nCurrent Carry\nRods To Generate\nMagnetic Field To\nFilter Electrons\n(Prevent Electron\nExtraction)\n\nCup\n\nChamber\nBias Plate\n\nTo High-Voltage\nPower Supply\n\nIn a Dusty-Plasma Particle Accelerator, microparticles or nanoparticles in a cup exposed to a plasma\nbecome electrically charged and are then accelerated by applying a pulsed electric field.\n\naccelerate particles exiting the particle\nholder.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA frozen-plug technique has been\nconceived as a means of temporarily\nblocking the flow of liquid oxygen or its\nvapor through a tube or pipe. The technique makes it possible to perform\nmaintenance, repair, or other work on\ndownstream parts of the cryogenic system in which the oxygen is used, without\nhaving to empty an upstream liquid-oxygen reservoir and, hence, without wasting the stored liquid oxygen and without\nsubjecting the reservoir to the stresses of\nthermal cycling.\nThe present frozen-plug technique\nwas inspired by an older frozen-plug\ntechnique used by plumbers on water\npipes in situations in which the expansion of water ice can be tolerated. In a\ntypical application of the older technique, the affected section of pipe is\ncooled by use of carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen, causing the water in the affected section of pipe to freeze.\nIn the present frozen-plug technique,\nthe section of pipe to be plugged is\nwrapped with a tube or vessel that can\nbe filled with a suitable cryogen. A sec-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\nondary fluid that is compatible with\noxygen and that has a freezing temperature higher than that of oxygen is\npumped into the pipe under pressure,\ncompletely filling the affected section.\nThe higher freezing temperature of the\nsecondary fluid makes it easier and\nsafer to use the secondary fluid than to\nfill the pipe with liquid oxygen. In the\ninitial application for which the technique was conceived, an oxygen-compatible cleaning solvent was chosen as\nsecondary fluid because of an application-specific requirement to maintain\ncleanliness in the cryogenic system.\nOther secondary fluids may be suitable\nin other applications.\nThe cryogen is pumped into the tube\nor vessel wrapped around the pipe. The\ncryogen (typically, liquid nitrogen) is\nchosen to have a temperature lower\nthan the freezing temperature of the\nsecondary fluid. Therefore, the pipe\nand its contents become chilled below\nthe freezing temperature of the secondary fluid, so that a plug of frozen secondary fluid forms in the pipe. The\n\nplug can withstand the upstream and\ndownstream pressures and the differential pressure between them.\nThe present frozen-plug technique is\nadaptable to systems containing fluids\nother than the liquid oxygen of its original application, and to the use of secondary fluids that are not cleaning solvents. Moreover, the choice of cryogen\nin this technique is not limited to liquid\nnitrogen. The technique can also be\nadapted to non-cryogenic systems. In systems in which freezing of the commodity\nfluids (perhaps some food products, for\nexample) can be tolerated, there may be\nno need to use secondary fluids. In cases\nof some commodities, it may be necessary to perform research to identify any\npotential hazards posed by freezing.\nThis work was done by C.

The mathematical model of the BEC in this study is a\nnonlinear Schroedinger equation\n(NLSE) in which (1) the role of the\nwave function of a single particle in the\ntraditional Schroedinger equation is\nplayed by a space- and time-dependent\ncomplex order parameter \xcf\x88(x,t) proportional to the square root of the density of atoms and (2) the atoms engage\nin a repulsive interaction characterized\nby a potential proportional to |\xcf\x88(x,t)|2.\nEquations that describe macroscopic\nperturbations of the BEC at zero temperature are derived from the NLSE\nand simplifying assumptions are made,\nleading to equations for the propagation of sound waves and the transformation of sound waves into shock waves.\nEquations for the speeds of shock waves\nand the relationships between jumps of\nvelocity and density across shock fronts\nare derived. Similarities and differences\nbetween this theory and the classical\ntheory of sound waves and shocks in ordinary gases are noted. The present theory is illustrated by solving the equations\nfor the example of a shock wave propagating in a cigar-shaped BEC.\nThis work was done by Igor Kulikov and\nMichail Zak of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

To recapitulate: One of\nthe oscillators would be deemed to be a\nreference oscillator, its frequency would\nbe offset by an amount (100 Hz) much\ngreater than the desired data rate, and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2005\n\neach of the other oscillators would be\ncompared with the frequency-offset signal by operation of a combination of\nhardware and software.

The system would effect a combination of interpolation and averaging\nto process the time tags into low-rate\nphase residuals at the desired grid\ntimes.

The focus of the\ndiscussion is on the desirability of chemically modifying carbon nanotubes to overcome their inherent chemical nonreactivity and thereby enable the formation of\nstrong chemical bonds between nanotubes and epoxies (or other polymeric\nmatrix materials or their monomeric precursors). The chemical modification is effected in a process in which discrete functional groups are covalently attached to\nthe nanotube surfaces. The functionalization process was proposed by the company and demonstrated in practice for the\nfirst time during this development effort.\nThe covalently attached functional groups\nare capable of reacting with the epoxy or\nother matrix resin to form covalent\nbonds. Furthermore, the company uses\nthis process to chemically modify the nanotube surfaces, affording \xe2\x80\x9ctunable\xe2\x80\x9d adhesion to polymers and solubility in select\nsolvents. Flat-sheet composites containing\nfunctionalized nanotubes demonstrate\nsignificantly improved mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties.\nThis work was done by Thomas A.\nReynolds of ReyTech Corp. for Johnson\n\nSpace Center.

The purpose is to overcome two\nlimitations of using visible images: (1) at\nlarge Earth phase angles, the light from\nthe Earth is too faint; and (2) performance is degraded by large albedo variations associated with weather changes. In\nparticular, it is proposed to use images in\nthe wavelength band of 8 to 13 \xce\xbcm,\nwherein the appearance of the Earth is\nsubstantially independent of the Earth\nphase angle and emissivity variations are\nsmall. The report addresses tracking requirements for optical and Ka-band communications, selection of the wavelength\nband, available signal level versus phase\nangle, background noise, and signal-tonoise ratio. Tracking errors are estimated\nfor several conceptual systems employing\ncurrently available infrared image sensors. It is found that at Mars range, it\nshould be possible to locate the centroid\nof the Earth image within a noise equivalent angle (a random angular error) between 10 and 150 nanoradians at a bias\nerror of no more than 80 nanoradians.\nThis work was done by Gerardo Ortiz and\nShinhak Lee of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The first report\ndiscusses\nchamber\ndesign\nmodifications made as results of hot-fire\ntests and post-test characterization. The\n\n31\n\nmodifications were intended to serve a\nvariety of purposes, including improving fabrication, reducing thermal-expansion mismatch stresses, increasing\nstrength-to-weight ratios of some components, and improving cooling of\nsome components. The second report\ndiscusses (1) the origin of stress in the\nmismatch between the thermal expansions of the Ir/Re liner and a niobium\nsleeve and flange attached to the carbon/carbon shell and (2) a modification intended to relieve the stress. The\nmodification involves the redesign of an\ninlet connection to incorporate a compressible seal between the Ir/Re liner\nand the Nb flange. A nickel alloy was selected as the seal material on the basis\nof its thermal-expansion properties and\nits ability to withstand the anticipated\nstresses, including the greatest stresses\ncaused by the high temperatures to be\nused in brazing during fabrication.\nThis work was done by Brian E.

Three of the programs \xe2\x8e\xaf\nTEAMS, L2, and RODON \xe2\x8e\xaf are\nmodel-based reasoning (or diagnostic)\nprograms. The other two programs \xe2\x8e\xaf\nICS and IMS \xe2\x8e\xaf do not attempt to isolate\nthe causes of failures but can be used for\ndetecting faults. In the study, qualitative\nmodels (in TEAMS and L2) and quantitative models (in RODON) having varying scope and completeness were created. Each of the models captured the\nstructure and behavior of the HCF as a\nphysical system. It was noted that in the\ncases of the qualitative models, the temporal aspects of the behavior of the HCF\nand the abstraction of sensor data are\nhandled outside of the models, and it is\nnecessary to develop additional code for\nthis purpose. A need for additional code\nwas also noted in the case of the quantitative model, though the amount of development effort needed was found to be\nless than that for the qualitative models.\nThis work was done by Scott Poll, David\nIverson, Jeremy Ou, Dwight Sanderfer, and\nAnn Patterson-Hine of Ames Research\nCenter.

The advantages of such a cluster, relative to a single larger antenna of equivalent EIRP, would include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The cluster would have less mass and\nvolume.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Power densities in amplifiers, waveguides, and other transmitting components feeding the antennas would be\nlower. Therefore, problems of preventing overheating and high-voltage breakdown would be less severe.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phases could be made electronically adjustable for beam steering to increase\npointing accuracy.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Failure of one antenna or its feed system\nwould reduce the EIRP but would not\ndisable the entire transmitting system.\nBeam-steering capability would remain\nas long as at least three antennas (and\ntheir feed systems) in a triangular\narrangement remained functional.\nThe documents summarize the applicable basic principles of antenna design and\nrequirements that would govern the design\nof an antenna cluster for a specific proposed mission [the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO)]. Candidate design concepts\nfor realizing the aforementioned and\nother advantages for JIMO are analyzed.\nThis work was done by Robert Clauss,\nRichard Lovick, Narayan Mysoor, and John\nZitzelberger of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
