Robotic missions are capable of conducting science, but only humans can explore and discover. The challenge is to build an affordable exploration program. This can be done by aggressively evolving our current systems, developing high payoff technologies, leveraging off commercial and other agencies' programs, and developing a set of core capabilities to be used to explore a variety of destinations. NASA has a Strategic Roadmap based on detailed mission studies to develop these core technologies and capabilities to allow human space exploration. Advances in human support, launch vehicle. improvements, development of in-space transportation systems, efficient power generation and distribution, and In-Situ Resource Utilization are all required to meet the exploration challenge. The groundwork today will provide the technology and tools needed to conduct safe, affordable, and efficient exploration to the moon, asteroids, deep space observatories and Mars.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20110000005, "endDate": "2000-09-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "16th Day of Space Flight", "location": "Neubrandenburg", "id": "afee54a3ba4046c1a689664e5290cf6e", "startDate": "2000-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110000005, "id": "f9ce60c7e7ab496ba221153acd9da3ff", "publicationDate": "2000-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110000005.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110000005/downloads/20110000005.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110000005/downloads/20110000005.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110000005/downloads/20110000005.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
