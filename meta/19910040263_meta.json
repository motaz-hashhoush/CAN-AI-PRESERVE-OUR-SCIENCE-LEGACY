Lifetime-limiting mechanisms are identified and addressed. Two energy loadings of 15 and 44 Joules were selected for the initial accelerated life testing. A fluorescence-efficiency test station was used for measuring the useful-light output degradation of the lamps. The design characteristics meeting NASA specifications are outlined. Attention is focused on the physical properties of tungsten-matrix cathodes, the chemistry of dispenser cathodes, and anode degradation. It is reported that out of the total 83 lamps tested in the program, 4 lamps reached a billion shots and one lamp is beyond 1.7 billion shots, while at 44 Joules, 4 lamps went beyond 100 million shots and one lamp reached 500 million shots.", "title": "Billion shot flashlamp for spaceborne lasers", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T18:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910040263, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Richter, Linda"}, "organization": {"name": "ILC Technology, Inc.", "location": "Sunnyvale, CA, United States"}}, "id": "6ef4035a011f48e6925c0f3689904c07"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910040263, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schuda, Felix"}, "organization": {"name": "ILC Technology, Inc.", "location": "Sunnyvale, CA, United States"}}, "id": "8a215885c08d4c73a3335a115b86dfc9"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19910040263, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Degnan, John"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "f54eeb5b27f04fdcbd80c2b237802192"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910040263, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910040263, "id": "31ef4139a59145d49b77f0755b0b18d0", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
