They are issued to encourage\ncommercial application. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the National Technical Information\nService, Springfield, Virginia 22151.

Films of dust, oil, and\nother contaminants can be subtle enough to evade\ndetection by the naked eye, and yet, significantly affect\nthe operation of sophisticated devices that depend upon\nsensitive optical components. When continuous detection\nof such optical errors is required, as is the case with\nspacecraft instruments or as might be desirable with\nastronomical telescopes and during the production of\nmany kinds of optical devices, the design of a suitable\nmonitoring system becomes an even more complex\ntask.\n\nThe solution:\nA newly developed instrument can measure optical\ntransmission, reflectance, and scattering. This information can then be used to identify changes in optical\nproperties or deviations from required optical standards.\nThis device consists primarily of a monochromatic\nsource, a photo detector, a transfer mirror, and a hemiellipsoid. The system is currently designed for laboratory\nuse, but will ultimately be automated for unattended\nuse in other environments.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe intensity of a transmitted or reflected beam of\nlight is measured for each sample. The transmittance,\nreflectance, or scattering is then determined by comparison with the incident beam as in conventional\nspectroscopy. The optical design of the instrument is\nshown in the figure (overleaf).\n\nMonochromatic light is focused on the sample by a\ntoroidal mirror. Light reflected from the sample comes\nto a focus at the surface of the hemi-ellipsoid. This\nallows the aperture through which the light passes to be\nas small as possible. The reflected light is measured by\na phototube, placed as shown in position A.\nTo measure scattering, the phototube is moved to\nposition B. In position C, the phototube is placed\nbehind the sample to measure the transmitted light.\nWhen the sample is removed, and with the phototube\nin position C, the incident intensity of the light can be\nmeasured.\nThe ultraviolet, monochromatic light sources used\nin this version of the system are obtained from RF\nexcited krypton and mercury lamps (1236 and 1849 A,\nrespectively). The photo detector system uses a commercially available photomultiplier with a magnesium fluoride window, a cesium iodide cathode, and 18 stages of\namplification. This system may also be equipped with\nquartz crystal microbalance gages to determine the\nquantity of contaminant deposited on the sample\nsurface.\n\nNotes:\n1. In thin film technology this system might be used to\nmeasure optical properties of the film and correlate\nthem with the film mass, or to monitor film thickness.\n2.
