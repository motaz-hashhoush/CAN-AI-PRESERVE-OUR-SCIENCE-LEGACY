The former would provide the cockpit with access to\nappropriate information via a high-bandwidth internet-like\nconnection. The latter would use those same transmissions to\nderive three-dimensional position of the terminal\xe2\x80\x94position\nthat could then be broadcast via the same data link to provide\nall users with situational awareness on the airport surface.\nAdding simple transmitters to other surface-movement\nvehicles would allow for the development of a high-fidelity\ncomplete picture of the airport surface environment.\xe2\x80\x9d ANLE\nwas proposed for the under-utilized 5091 to 5150 MHz band,\nwhich was allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation\nservice (ARNS) for implementation of Microwave Landing\nSystem (MLS), but for which no MLS channels had yet been\nassigned. The 5091 to 5150 MHz band, also referred to as the\nMLS Extension Band, also contains an allocation to fixedsatellite service (FSS) for use by non-geostationary (nonGSO) mobile-satellite service (MSS) feeder uplinks. MITRECAASD performed initial analyses of the sharing of the MLS\nExtension Band between the MSS feeder links and the ANLE\nsystem as reported in Reference 3, to validate the feasibility of\nsharing this band between the two systems. This supported the\naddition of an aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S)\nallocation to the MLS Extension Band that could support the\nANLE system at the World Radiocommunication Conference\n(WRC) 2007. Analysis of the compatibility between the\nairport surface wireless network and MSS feeder links has\ncontinued in order to establish the AeroMACS power\ntransmission limits which will ensure, including work by both\nMITRE-CAASD and NASA Glenn Research Center (Refs. 4\nand 5).\nIn 2002, the NASA Glenn Research Center considered\npossible communications, navigation and surveillance\nrequirements for the airport surface in formulating a new\nresearch project eventually called Space-Based Technologies\n(SBT). At the Second Integrated Communications, Navigation\nand Surveillance (ICNS) Conference in April 2002, the\nrecommendation was made to identify and address research\nefforts where current work is inadequate or underfunded\nregarding integration of multiple applications on the ground,\nthe CNS performance requirements of integrated applications,\nand the data networking implications of this integration\n(Ref. 6). As a result, the SBT Project included a major effort\nin airport surface communications.\n\nAbstract\nThis The Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications\nSystem (AeroMACS) is being developed to provide a new\nbroadband wireless communications capability for safety\ncritical communications in the airport surface domain,\nproviding connectivity to aircraft and other ground vehicles as\nwell as connections between other critical airport fixed assets.\nAeroMACS development has progressed from requirements\ndefinition through technology definition, prototype\ndeployment and testing, and now into national and\ninternational standards development. The first prototype\nAeroMACS system has been deployed at the Cleveland\nHopkins International Airport (CLE) and the adjacent NASA\nGlenn Research Center (GRC). During the past 3 years,\nextensive technical testing has taken place to characterize the\nperformance of the AeroMACS prototype and provide\ntechnical support for the standards development process. The\ntesting has characterized AeroMACS link and network\nperformance over a variety of conditions for both fixed and\nmobile data transmission and has included basic system\nperformance testing and fixed and mobile applications testing.\nThis paper provides a summary of the AeroMACS\nperformance testing and the status of standardization activities\nthat the testing supports.\n\n1.0\n\nIntroduction\n\nWireless communications for airport surface safety critical\naviation applications has been considered since the late 1990s.\nThe German Aerospace Center (DLR) researched the\napplication of multicarrier code division multiple access to\nenable an Advanced Airport Data Link (ADL) to fulfill the\ncommunications requirements of the Advanced Surface\nMovement Guidance and Control System (Ref. 1). ADL\naimed to provide data communications between air traffic\ncontrollers, airport authorities, and airline companies and\naircraft on the airport surface. The possible use of 5000 to\n5150 MHz band for the ADL system was considered at that time.\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Aviation Administration\n(FAA) in conjunction with MITRE-CAASD began developing\nthe Airport Network and Location Equipment (ANLE)\nconcept. In (Ref. 2), ANLE is described as a \xe2\x80\x9chigh integrity,\n\xe2\x80\x9csafety rated\xe2\x80\x9d wireless local area network (LAN) for the\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\n1\n\nThe SBT Project studied communications requirements on\nthe airport surface and potential system architectures through inhouse and contracted efforts. The results of these studies\n(Refs. 7 and 8) helped establish the basis for what became the\nAeroMACS system. Further studies by MITRE-CAASD\n(Ref. 9) built upon the SBT Project requirements studies and\nother analyses enabled the estimate of spectrum requirements\nsupporting the MLS Extension Band AM(R)S spectrum\nallocation approved at WRC 2007.\nBy 2007, the FAA and Eurocontrol had completed a joint\nstudy called the Future Communications Study, investigating\nthe future communications requirements for aviation. Among\nmany outputs, this study concluded that the IEEE 802.16e\nstandard was the preferred technology for an airport surface\nwireless communications network, thereby establishing an\ninternational consensus that enabled AeroMACS standardization to proceed.\nUnder the SBT Project, NASA Glenn Research Center\nentered into a cooperative agreement with Sensis Corporation\nwhich resulted in the establishment of what eventually came to\nbe known as the NASA-CLE CNS testbed, located at the NASA\nGlenn Research Center (GRC) and adjacent Cleveland Hopkins\ninternational Airport (CLE). In this testbed, the feasibility of\nusing wireless communications networks for integration of\nsurface surveillance was established by interconnecting several\nAirport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-X) sensor units\nand transmitting sensor data to a central processing station\n(Ref. 10). Prior to the availability of IEEE 802.16e equipment,\nthe surface wireless network was implemented using 802.11\nequipment operating in the MLS Extension Band.\nThe SBT Project also developed a measurement campaign to\ncharacterize the MLS Extension Band propagation channel in\nthe airport environment. Under a cooperative agreement with\nOhio University, channel propagation measurements were made\nat several large, medium and small airports in the United States\n(Ref. 11). The test results enabled the development of path loss\nand airport channel models valid for the 5091 to 5150 MHz\nband that enabled the development of detailed simulations of\n802.16e performance for the airport surface application.\nIn 2009, under a cooperative agreement with ITT-Exelis and\nwith funding provided by the FAA, the first AeroMACS\nprototype was established within the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed.\nWith the availability of 802.16e equipment, including base\nstations and subscriber units, tuned to the MLS Extension band\nnow allocated for the AeroMACS service, testing was initiated\nto provide technical results upon which national and\ninternational standards for AeroMACS could be established. A\ndescription of the AeroMACS system development can be\nfound in Reference 12.\nDuring the past 3 years, extensive technical testing has\ntaken place to characterize the performance of the AeroMACS\nprototype and provide technical support for the standards\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\ndevelopment process. This testing has characterized\nAeroMACS link and network performance over a variety of\nconditions for both fixed and mobile data transmission.\nDuring 2012, the first two practical AeroMACS\ndemonstrations have taken place, demonstrating both the fixed\nand mobile aspects of AeroMACS. The first demonstration\nutilized a Boeing corporation 737 jet equipped with an\nAeroMACS antenna and subscriber station, enabling the\nevaluation of the AeroMACS performance in bringing safety\ncritical flight information to the cockpit. This event marked\nthe first use of an aircraft involved in AeroMACS testing,\naugmenting previous mobile testing which utilized a ground\nvehicle offering speeds and reception characteristics which\ndiffer greatly from the commercial aircraft.\nThe second demonstration involved the suitability of\nAeroMACS to transmit live safety critical data between fixed\nassets. Live radar data from an Airport Surveillance Radar\nmodel 9 (ASR-9) was transmitted from the ASR-9 site to the\nair traffic control tower at CLE. This was the first\ndemonstration of broadband transmission of live safety critical\ndata over AeroMACS, and has established the potential for\nAeroMACS to be applied to many airport fixed asset\ncommunications requirements.\nIn the following sections, the AeroMACS prototype as\ninstantiated in the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed is described,\nfollowed by a summary of AeroMACS performance testing.\nThe focus of the paper will be on describing the most recent\nAeroMACS testing results, including the Boeing 737 aircraft\nmobility testing and the fixed safety critical data transmission\ntesting. The status of AeroMACS standardization activities\nwill also be provided.\n\n2.0\n\nAeroMACS Testbed Description\n\nOne of the primary goals of the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed\nas initially established was to enable testing of the\ninterconnection of ASDE-X sensors via an airport surface\nwireless communications network (Ref. 13). The testbed\nincluded assets at three different airports, including CLE,\nCleveland Burke Lakefront Airport, and Lorain County\nRegional Airport to allow testing of wide area multilateration,\nremotely staffed virtual air traffic control, assessment of 4D\narrival and departure trajectories, and advanced integrated\nsurveillance. The installation of an ASDE-X system for testing\nrequired the placement of eight multilateration sensors at CLE\nin order to achieve full airport surface coverage. The use of an\ninitial IEEE 802.11 wireless network enabled the fixed ASDEX sensors to be interconnected to the ASDE-X processor,\nallowing real-time airport surface surveillance to be established.\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94AeroMACS prototype testbed.\n\nFigure 1 shows a diagram of the current AeroMACS\nprototype testbed. Before the ASDE-X tests were completed,\nthe prototype AeroMACS system was installed. This system\nconsisted of two base stations and fixed and mobile subscriber\nstations. The fixed subscriber stations (denoted by \xe2\x80\x9cSS\xe2\x80\x9d in\nFig. 1) were placed coincident with the ASDE-X sensors,\nallowing a final set of tests with the ASDE-X system using the\nAeroMACS prototype instead of the 802.11 network. These\ntests proved that AeroMACS provided equivalent performance\nin support of the ASDE-X system. After these tests the\nASDE-X test system was removed, but the AeroMACS\nsubscriber units remained at the same locations.\nThe location of the two base stations (BS-1 and BS-2 in\nFig. 1) covers the majority of the airport surface of CLE. The\nbase stations communicate with subscriber stations that are\nwithin their coverage. They also communicate with each other\nthrough a microwave backhaul link. This arrangement enables\ntesting of handoffs between base stations that is required for\nmobile AeroMACS connectivity as well as for handling cases of\ntemporary obstructions of fixed subscriber stations.\nThe AeroMACS testbed also includes a mobile element,\ncalled the Aeronautical Research Vehicle (ARV) as shown in\nFigure 2. The ARC consists of a ground vehicle fully equipped\nwith a subscriber stations, test and measurement systems, and\nvideo camera. The ARV enables testing of many mobile\naspects of AeroMACS without the cost and difficulty of using\naircraft. However the ARV is limited in terms of size, speed\nand access compared to an actual aircraft, hence the testing\ndescribed below was essential in demonstrating AeroMACS\nperformance for real aeronautical mobile applications.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Aeronautical Research Vehicle (ARV) for\nAeroMACS testing.\n\n3.0\n\nAeroMACS Prototype Testing\n\nThe primary AeroMACS prototype testing took place\nduring 2010 and 2011 (Refs. 14 and 15). With the\nconfiguration described in the previous section, static testing\nof the AeroMACS network using the fixed subscriber stations\nhas been ongoing since the establishment of AeroMACS\nequipment in 2009. However the mobility requirement for\nAeroMACS is the critical and most difficult one, hence the\nARV was used extensively for these tests. The ARV often\noperated around the perimeter of CLE so as not to interfere\nwith airport operations. Some critical testing also took place\non the airport taxiways and runways when no aircraft\noperations were taking place. These various areas allowed\n\n3\n\nboth line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)\nbetween the base stations and the mobile subscriber station.\nThe AeroMACS testing consisted of AeroMACS mobility\ntesting; testing of Multiple antenna configurations (multipleinput/multiple output, or MIMO) on the vehicle; and testing of\nvehicle speed effects.\nFor all of this testing, the AeroMACS prototype network\nparameters are as described in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\nTesting was performed for three mobile subscriber station\nantenna configurations: single antenna; two antennas\nseparated by one wavelength; and two antennas separated by\n10 wavelengths.\nBase station transmit power was set to 25, 50 or 100 mW.\nThe vehicle speed was set to 13, 26 or 40 kn.\nIn general the AeroMACS mobility testing showed robust\nperformance, producing throughput rates ranging from\napproximately 0.5 to 4.5 Mbps, depending primarily on the\ndistance of the vehicle from the base station as well as\nLOS/NLOS condition. This performance was seen in the\nseveral airport surface test regions: Runways (low multipath,\nhigh speed); Terminal areas (High multipath and LOS/\nNLOS)); and Service road (Long range, variable multipath,\nLOS/NLOS).\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Average throughput rate for the service road drive\ntest.\n\nThe MIMO testing validated the use of use of MIMO for the\nsubscriber station receive antenna as it showed improved\nreceiver performance and lower base station transmit power\nrequirements, enabling deployment of additional airport\ninstallations while still remaining below the mobile satellite\nservice feeder link interference threshold.\nFigure 3 shows the results of the service road test. The\nMIMO configuration outperformed the single antenna case,\nand the two antenna 10 wavelength spacing outperformed the\none wavelength spacing. The one wavelength antenna spacing\n(2.3 in., 5.9 cm) performed the same as the single antenna case\nwith reduced base station transmit power, verifying that the\nMIMO installation enables a reduction of base station transmit\npower and potentially more airport installations.\nThe measured data throughput as a function of vehicle\nvelocity showed negligible difference up to 40 kt velocity.\nAdditional velocity test results are presented in the next\nsection.\n\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94BASE STATION PARAMETERS\nTransmit power\n21 dBm maximum\nChannel bandwidth\n5 MHz\nMaximum antenna gain\n15 dBi\nAntenna beamwidth\n90\xc2\xb0 azimuth by 8\xc2\xb0 elevation\nAntenna mode\n2\xef\x82\xb42 MIMO (2Rx, 2Tx)\nMatrix A, MRC\nMaximum transmission unit\n1440 bytes\nDownlink/Uplink ratio\n60/40\nHybrid automatic repeat request\nEnabled\n(HARQ)\nAAA server\nEnabled\nPKMv2, EAP-TTLS security\nEnabled\nAES-128 air link encryption\nEnabled\n\n4.0\n\nThe first mobile applications testing of AeroMACS was\nperformed using a Boeing 737-700 that was provided by Boeing\nfrom their corporate fleet. These activities constituted the first\nuse of AeroMACS using an actual aircraft, including use of an\nantenna designed for aircraft use (Refs. 14 and 16). The aircraft\ntests also differed from the ARV testing by offering\nsignificantly greater antenna height placement and vehicle\nvelocities. The activities demonstrated the first two-way\nAeroMACS data link service providing flight critical data.\nThe aircraft was fitted with a Sensor Systems S65-5366-720\n5 GHz antenna, temporarily replacing the standard VHF blade\nantenna as shown in Figure 4. The ARV\xe2\x80\x99s subscriber unit, a\nprototype AeroMACS unit with external antenna leads was\ninstalled in the aircraft and connected to the 5 GHz antenna.\nUnited Airlines provided hangar facilities for making the\nnecessary onboard modifications.\n\nTABLE 2.\xe2\x80\x94MOBILE SUBSCRIBER STATION PARAMETERS\nTransmit power\nAdaptable: 21 dBm\nmaximum\nMaximum antenna gain\n8 dBi\nAntenna beamwidth\nOmindirectional on\nhorizon\nAntenna mode\n2\xef\x82\xb42 MIMO (2Rx, 1Tx)\nTABLE 3.\xe2\x80\x94COMMON BASE STATION AND SUBSCRIBER\nSTATION PARAMETERS\nModulation\nAdaptive:\nQPSK, QAM-16, QAM-64\nForward error correction\nAdaptive:\nCTC 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\nMobile Application Testing\n\n4\n\nTABLE 4.\xe2\x80\x94AVERAGE THROUGHPUT AS A FUNCTION OF\nVEHICLE SPEED\nSpeed,\nVehicle\nAverage throughput,\nkt\nMbps\n40\nARV\n4.7\n40\nBoeing 737\n4.8\n60\nBoeing 737\n4.2\n80\nBoeing 737\n3.9\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Boeing 737-700 aircraft used for AeroMACS\nmobility testing showing location of AeroMACS antenna.\n\nThe AeroMACS subscriber station onboard the Boeing 737700 was configured to associate with base station sector 2-3 of\nthe base station located at the ARFF facility on the eastern\nside of CLE (Fig. 1). The sector offers 60\xef\x82\xb0 of LOS coverage to\nthe north and south of the sectors 270\xef\x82\xb0 heading.\nTwo activities were performed using this configuration. The\nfirst activity consisted of characterizing the performance of\nAeroMACS onboard a Boeing 737-700 by repeating a subset\nof the drive test scenarios previously conducted with the ARV\nfor the AeroMACS baseline tests described in the previous\nsection. Tests were performed using similar airport surface\nand runway routes at velocities up to 80 kt. The second\nactivity further validated the performance of AeroMACS by\ndemonstrating the successful use of safety critical aeronautical\nmobile applications using AeroMACS as the application data\nlink. For both activities, the aircraft remained on the ground in\ntaxi mode in the gate, terminal and taxi areas and on Runway\n24 L (Fig. 1) as are appropriate for an aircraft using\nAeroMACS.\nThe Boeing 737-700 performance characterization resulted\nin the collection of AeroMACS performance data enabling a\ncomparison with the baseline ARV test data. This comparison\nrevealed that the Boeing 737-700 installed AeroMACS system\nhad performance characteristics similar to the results obtained\nduring the ARC testing. Of interest are the aircraft taxi tests as\na function of velocity. A small throughput performance\ndependency with vehicle velocity was measured as aircraft\nspeeds increased above 40 kt. Table 4 shows the average\nthroughput as a function of velocity. Figure 5 shows the\neffects of vehicle velocity as the aircraft travelled down\nRunway 24 L. The effects of proximity to the base station are\nvisible in this figure as well, with the base station location\napproximately one-third of the distance from the northeast end\nof Runway 24 L (Fig. 1). These test results indicate that\nAeroMACS can achieve good performance up to 50 kt as\nrequired by AeroMACS Profile (Section 6.0).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Effects of vehicle velocity on throughput from\nrunway 24 L taxi tests.\n\nThe AeroMACS validation activity required a suitable air\ntraffic control or air traffic services application over\nAeroMACS to the Boeing 737-700 as it taxied across the\nairport surface. This effectively demonstrated the performance\nand feasibility of AeroMACS for safety critical mobility\napplications. The selection of an appropriate application was\ninfluenced by operational continuity considerations, including\nFAA plans to implement early data communications\ncapabilities over VDL Mode 2 as part of the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s\nDataComm Program. Other considerations included the\nmaturity of the data link service definition, the service\navailability (whether or not the service currently exists or can\nbe suitably emulated), and hardware and software integration\nconsiderations.\nThe application chosen to validate the AeroMACS\ntechnology was a navAero T-1000 Electronic Flight Bag\n(EFB) system hosting a weather applications from WSI\nCorporation known as InFlight, capable of presenting cockpit\nstaff with critical en-route meteorological data such as\nAirmen\xe2\x80\x99s Meteorological Information (AIRMETs), Significant\nMeteorological Information (SIGMETs), and terminal\nconditions through Meteorological Aerodrome Reports\n(METARS). Figure 6 illustrates WSI\xe2\x80\x99s EFB showing a\nregional radar graphic with textual METARs inset for CLE.\nThe Inflight system typically consists of a stand-alone\nSIRIUS satellite radio receiver which utilizes a 100BaseT\nEthernet connection to interface the unit to an EFB or\nmultifunction display (MFD). The system is normally meant\n\n5\n\nIn preparation for testing in a relevant environment,\ncommunications equipment was obtained to conduct initial\nequipment setup and testing at a NASA GRC laboratory.\nLaboratory equipment configuration and layout was designed\nto replicate surveillance communications requirements at\nASR-9 radar facilities. Laboratory equipment consisted of\nAeroMACS subscriber stations, Codex 3600 modems,\nNewbridge 3624 Channel bank systems and media converter\nequipment. The scope of the laboratory test was to configure\nmodems and channel bank systems to transport information at\nthe correct data rates while adhering to communication\nprotocols in use. AeroMACS uses Transmission Control\nProtocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for communications\nexchange. The communications interface in use by\ntelecommunications equipment commonly use T1 or DS-0\nlevels (1.544 Mbps). To enable the exchange of information\nbetween the T1 channel bank system interface and IP interface\nprovided by AeroMACS, a media converter system was used.\nThe media converter unit was able to packetize T1 channels\nand provide timing signals for end-to-end channel bank\noperation. In laboratory testing, the AeroMACS system was\nable to transport 24 channels of a T1 system. Error free endto-end bit error rate tests were conducted and the laboratory\nsystem configuration was successfully tested under different\ndata rate load configurations and with different modem\nparameters.\nStarting in April of 2012, NASA and FAA personnel\nproceeded to install AeroMACS equipment at the ASR-9\nsurveillance facility and ATCT. The AeroMACS subscriber\nstation was deployed at the radar tower structure and the\nPower Over Ethernet (POE) system and Newbridge Channel\nBank were installed in the radar building. The POE and\nAeroMACS SS were connected using Ethernet cabling. At the\nATCT, an AeroMACS subscriber station was installed on top\nof the Mezzanine building and cabled to the FAA equipment\nroom where the Newbridge Channel Bank and POE where\ndeployed. The wireless configuration utilized the base station\nto connect the subscriber station deployed at the ATCT and\nsubscriber station deployed at ASR facility as shown in\nFigure 7. Although an actual National Airspace System\ndeployment will not utilize a two-hop configuration, the\nNASA test bed AeroMACS prototype system did not offer a\nsingle hop architecture option. Bit error rate tests were\nconducted employing loading and configurations used in the\nearlier laboratory tests, showing zero bit errors generated\nduring the data transmission.\nThe new surveillance system in Cleveland was\ncommissioned in July 2012, thus freeing up the old radar\nsystem for AeroMACS testing. At the ASR-9 location, the\nAeroMACS subscriber station was interfaced to the ASR-9\nRacal modem systems through the existing Data Probe\nswitching system. At the ATCT the AeroMACS subscriber\nstation was interfaced to the corresponding modem systems as\nshown in Figure 8. To monitor the performance of the\ncommunications system, a radar analysis tool (WRTADS) was\nused to display and record system performance. The analysis\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94A sample weather screen showing radar (with\nimpending rain) and a current METAR for CLE.\n\nto be used onboard an individual aircraft, however the\nintended demonstration consisted of interfacing the satellite\nreceiver unit into the AeroMACS testbed and utilizing the\nwireless data link to provide \xe2\x80\x9clast mile\xe2\x80\x9d services to the\ncockpit. Due to a satellite receiver failure, the configuration\nwas further altered to utilize AeroMACS to connect to WSI\ndemonstration system connected to the internet.\nWSI\xe2\x80\x99s InFlight EFB weather application caches the\npacketized information broadcast over the Sirius satellite\nsystem. For timely information, the entire system, from\nreceiver to EFB, should be on receiving broadcast updates.\nWith SIRIUS data rates confined to 64 kbps and below, the\n4 Mbps average throughput of the AeroMACS system\xe2\x80\x99s\nwireless data link component to aircraft, or even the\n1.44 Mbps interface to the Internet, had no negative impact\nupon the demonstration application.\n\n5.0\n\nSafety Critical Fixed Asset Testing\n\nThe opportunity to test AeroMACS using an actual critical\nfixed application was presented when Cleveland FAA initiated\nplans for the construction of a new Air Traffic Control Tower\n(ATCT) facility. The optimal location for construction of the\nnew ATCT facility was determined to be in close proximity to\nthe ASR-9 system. As a consequence of the new ATCT\nconstruction location, the existing radar sensor was scheduled\nfor displacement to a location north of the airport. To enable\nseamless air traffic operations, the FAA operates an existing\nsurveillance facility until a new radar system is built,\noptimized and thoroughly tested. The scheduled change of\nsurveillance systems at Cleveland airport gave rise to the\nopportunity for testing AeroMACS utilizing the radar system\nscheduled for removal. With the approval and cooperation\nfrom FAA CLE Radar System Support Center (SSC), a plan\nwas formulated to integrate AeroMACS into the\ncommunications infrastructure at Cleveland airport, interface\nit with the surveillance system and subsystems and conduct\ntesting.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\n6\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Wireless configuration for ASR-9 safety critical fixed asset tests.\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94AeroMACS-ATCT-ASR-9 interfaces.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\n7\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94AeroMACS-ASR-9 test voice grade line performance.\n\ntool was deployed at both the ASR-9 and ATCT locations. At\nthe ASR-9 location, the radar analysis tool was connected to\nthe Communications Radar Interface Box where tracks\nproduced by the radar system could be recorded for post\nprocessing. At the ATCT, the radar analysis tool was\nconnected to the Serial Communications Interface Panel where\nreceived radar tracks were recorded for post processing and\ncomparison with recordings at the sensor location. The testing\nindicated that the AeroMACS system was successfully able to\ntransport critical radar information from the radar source to the\nATCT. Figure 9 illustrates the performance of the voice grade\nline performance. The loss performance from 400 to 3000 Hz\nis negligible and illustrates the signal quality being provided to\nthe modem system.\nFuture AeroMACS evaluations will include testing of\nsystem performance utilizing a single hop wireless\nconfiguration. This configuration would enable the evaluation\nof system latency under high communications demand loading\nusing shared services configuration. The fixed asset testing\nsuccessfully demonstrated that AeroMACS is able to meet the\nrequirements for transporting critical surveillance data in a\nreliable and efficient way.\n\n6.0\n\n223 is working in the development of Minimum Operational\nPerformance Standards (MOPS) and the WiMAX Forum has\nestablished a working group to address aviation interests. In\nEurope standardization efforts are being accomplished through\nEUROCAE Working Group (WG)-82 in developing MOPS\nand MASPS. The International Civil Aviation Organization\n(ICAO) is working in the development of Standards and\nRecommended Practices (SARPS) and Concept of Operations\n(ConOps). Common AeroMACS standards development in the\nU.S. and Europe has been requested by ICAO in response to\nthe ANC-11 recommendation for global interoperability and to\nhelp expedite ICAO approval of international AeroMACS\nstandards. The following sections provide information on\nongoing standardization efforts by these organizations.\n\n6.1\n\nRTCA is an organization that through consensus develops\nCommunications, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS) and Air\nTraffic Management (ATM) recommended standards for the\nUnited States Aviation. In 2009 a technology standardization\neffort for AeroMACS to support future mobile and fixed data\ncommunication applications and services for both ground/air\nand ground/ground communications services on the airport\nsurface was proposed to RTCA\xe2\x80\x99s Project Management\nCommittee (PMC). On the seventh of August 2009, RTCA\nPMC approved the Terms of Reference (TOR) document to\nproceed with AeroMACS standards development. The TOR\ndocument specified the delivery of the following products:\nAviation System Profiles for Airport Mobile Access\nCommunications Network and MOPS for Airport Surface\nWireless Mobile Access Communications Network.\n\nAeroMACS Standards Development\n\nWorldwide interoperability is a critical element in the design\nof AeroMACS technology. AeroMACS will be required to\nprovide seamless worldwide communications services while\nmeeting the needs of many different users. Collaborative efforts\nto standardize AeroMACS are concurrently taking place in the\nUnited States and Europe. In the United States Radio Technical\nCommission for Aeronautics (RTCA) Special Committee (SC)\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\nRTCA Standards Development\n\n8\n\n6.2\n\nand Airborne equipment MOPS documents are jointly\ndeveloped by RTCA and EUROCAE and the System level\nMASPS and Ground Equipment MOPS documents are\ndeveloped only by EUROCAE. European WG-82\nstandardization support includes participation from\nEUROCONTROL, ANSPs (AENA, DSNA, DFS), Industry\n(INDRA, SELEXELSAG, THALES, SAAB, COBHAM,\nHITACHI) and Industry Forums (WMF). WG-82 is scheduled\nto deliver its document at the end of 2013.\n\nRTCA SC-223\n\nThe RTCA Special Committee on Airport Surface Wireless\nCommunications, SC-223, was established in August 2009 to\ndevelop the AeroMACS profile and MOPS. With support from\nindustry, government, EUROCONTROL and WG-82 the U.S.\nfinal draft profile was completed at the end of 2010. The\nAeroMACS profile is a joint RTCA and EUROCAE\ndevelopment effort based on the WIMAX document, WiMAX\nRelease 1 System Profile. This airport wireless communications\ntechnology has been developed based on a specific WiMAX\nForum profile of the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard. Use of an\nestablished IEEE standard enables the aviation community to\nleverage extensive international standards collaboration and\ncommercially provided components and services. The profile\ndocument specifies the use of selected 802.16-2009 technical\nparameters that best serve the aviation needs. Parameters have\nbeen selected to meet mobile station requirements considering\ndifferent users, varied environments and operational uses. The\nAeroMACS profile closely follows the format of profiles\ndeveloped by the WiMAX Forum for commercial and industrial\nuse and is expected to be incorporated as one of several\nWiMAX Forum Certified profiles. Airborne MOPS\ndevelopment started in 2011 and is scheduled to conclude in late\n2012. MOPS objectives are to develop standards for both\nAirborne Component and Ground Based base station\ncomponents of AeroMACS.\n\n6.3\n\n6.5\n\nICAO is a special agency of the United Nations responsible\nfor the adoption of standards and recommended practices\nconcerning air navigation. The development of Aviation\nStandards and Recommended Practices is done under the\ndirection of the Air Navigation Commission (ANC) through\nthe formal process of ICAO working group panels. The ANC\nis the ICAO technical body. In March of 2012 the first\nAeronautical Communications Panel (ACP) Working Group S\nmeeting convened in Montreal, Canada to commence\nstandardization of airport Wireless Communications. The\nTerms of Reference document for Working Group S defines\nthe following objectives for the group:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Develop ICAO SARPs and Technical Manuals for\nAeroMACS.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Define and describe AeroMACS security framework for\nworldwide interoperability.\n\xef\x82\xb7 AeroMACS addressing and discovery mechanism that is\nconsistent with ATN/IPS for global interoperability\nwhile permits local implementation flexibility.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Coordination with international technical\nstandardization bodies.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Provide input to development of frequency planning\ncriteria.\n\nWiMAX Forum\n\nThe WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit\norganization that certifies and promotes the compatibility and\ninteroperability of broadband wireless products based upon\nIEEE Standard 802.16. The WiMAX Forum has created the\nAviation Working Group. The Working Group acts as a focal\npoint for Worldwide Aviation Industry interest in WIMAX as a\ntechnology for Aviation Applications, and promotes WiMAX as\nthe premiere technology for Aviation Applications on a global\nbasis. In August of 2010, an ad-hoc joint committee was formed\nbetween RTCA SC-223 and the WiMAX Forum to facilitate\ndevelopment of an AeroMACS profile.\n\n6.4\n\nICAO SARPS\n\nAt the writing of this paper the development of SARP\ndocument outline is completed and work to define the standard\nis progressing with support from different states and industry.\nAdditionally, a Concept of Use document is being developed\nto serve guide the development of requirements.\n\nEUROCAE Working Group 82 (WG-82)\n\n7.0\n\nThe European Commission and EUROCONTROL have\nsponsored work projects under SESAR (Single European Sky\nATM Research) Joint Undertaking (SJU) to progress the\ndesign and assessment of all future air/ground data link.\nEUROCAE assigned WG-82 to develop airport surface\nwireless communication standards in Europe. The group\nstarted in January 2010 with the purpose to develop the\nappropriate standards relative to new air-ground data link\ntechnologies including those associated with airport surface,\nand\nenroute/TMA\nusing\nterrestrial\nand\nsatellite\ncommunications (1). The working group is tasked with\ndelivering a total of four documents. The AeroMACS Profile\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942013-216497\n\nSummary\n\nThe need for an integrated wireless communications network\ncapability for the airport surface has been recognized since the\n1990s, and several research and study efforts have advanced the\nconcept. Requirements analyses provided the airport surface\ncommunications spectrum requirements, and interference and\nspectrum sharing studies proved the feasibility of adding an\nAM(R)S allocation to the 5091 to 5150 MHz MLS Extension\nBand to accommodate the airport surface wireless\ncommunications system, which was accomplished at WRC\n2007. The FAA-Eurocontrol Future Communications Study\n\n9\n\nverified that the IEEE 802.16e standard is appropriate for the\nAeroMACS system. As this standard supports the well-known\nWIMAX implementation, an aviation profile based on WIMAX\nhas been developed by RTCA and EUROCAE, and the name\nAeroMACS has been accepted to refer to the emerging airport\nwireless communications network. Channel propagation\nmeasurements have been performed at several airports,\nproviding data for the development of channel models used for\nsimulations of the AeroMACS profile. The availability in 2009\nof IEEE 802.16e equipment tuned to the MLS Extension Band\nenabled the deployment of the first AeroMACS prototype as\npart of the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed located at the NASA\nGlenn Research Center and adjacent Cleveland Hopkins\nInternational Airport.\nThis paper has focused on the results of testing of the\nAeroMACS prototype from 2009 through 2012 at the NASACLE CNS Testbed, and has also provided the status of the\nAeroMACS standardization process. Testing of the mobile\naspect of AeroMACS was performed first using a ground\nvehicle equipped with an AeroMACS mobile subscriber\nstation. A second series of tests used a Boeing 737-700\nequipped with an AeroMACS mobile subscriber station and a\nC-Band aircraft antenna to repeat some of the ground vehicle\ntests and also to demonstrate transmission of a real weather\napplication representative of safety critical service application.\nA third set of tests demonstrated the transmission of high rate\nsafety critical radar data over AeroMACS. From these results,\nit can be concluded that the performance of AeroMACS in\nsupporting safety critical aviation communications for both\nfixed and mobile applications will be sufficient to enable the\ndeployment of AeroMACS. The standards required to support\nfuture deployments and ensure international compatibility are\nadvancing toward completion. Although AeroMACS testing\nand demonstration will continue while standards are finalized,\nAeroMACS is poised for operational deployment in the near\nfuture.\n\n4.
