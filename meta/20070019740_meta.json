Higher costs and limited supply of fuels common to the industry are predicted, so poultry producers are seeking ways to reduce energy expenditure. NASA is providing assistance to Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc., an association of some 4,000 growers and suppliers in one of the nation's largest poultry production areas. Delmarva is the East Coast peninsula that includes Delaware and parts of Maryland and Virginia. The upper right photo shows a weather station in the Delmarva area (wind indicator on the pole, other instruments in the elevated box). The station is located at the University of Maryland's Broiler Sub-station, Salisbury; Maryland, where the university conducts research on poultry production and processing. The sub-station is investigating ways of conserving energy in broiler production and also exploring the potential of solar collectors as an alternative energy source. For these studies, it is essential that researchers have continuous data on temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, solar intensity and cloud cover. Equipment to acquire such data was loaned and installed by NASA's Wallops Flight Center, Wallops Island, Virginia.", "title": "Poultry Industry Energy Research", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019740, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019740, "id": "2418528c8b03496199c8c533061f69e3", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019740.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019740/downloads/20070019740.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019740/downloads/20070019740.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019740/downloads/20070019740.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
