We conclude that key lines necessary\nfor an interstellar glycine identification have not yet been found. We identify several\ncommon molecular candidates that should be examined further as more likely carriers of\nthe lines reported as glycine.

Recently, Kuan et al. (2003) reported the identification\nof interstellar glycine (NH2CH2COOH) in the direction of the hot molecular cores Sgr B2(N-LMH),\nOrion KL, and W51 el/e2.\nWe note several unusual aspects about the Kuan et al. (2003) reported glycine results. First,\ntheir glycine report was based on the detection of 27 spectral line features in the sources Orion KL,\nW51 el/e2, and Sgr Bz(N-LMH). They used the NRA07 12 m radio telescope operating in the range\nof 130 to 242 GHz. The sheer number of 27 independent spectral line features detected in 3 different\nsources appears to suggest overwhelming evidence. Certainly the detection of the same ensemble\nof spectral lines in multiple sources is a characteristic of interstellar molecules with structural\ncomponents similar to glycine, such as formic acid (HCOOH) and acetic acid (CH3COOH)(see,\nfor example, Liu, Mehringer, & Snyder 2001; Remijan et al. 2002). However, each of the three\nglycine sources was observed to contain no more than 13 to 16 of the 27 independent spectral\nlines features and only 3 of the 27 spectral line features were found to be common to all 3 sources.\nSecond, 16 of the 27 reported glycine features are not the four-fold degenerate rotational transitions\nthat should be the most likely to be detected for R-branch asymmetric rotor transitions. Third,\nthe glycine rest frequencies used in their observations were based on a Hamiltonian calculation\nwhich was extrapolated over 100 GHz. This method can yield potentially large uncertainties in the\nfrequency predictions. Fourth, the glycine column densities derived from rotational temperature\ndiagrams were surprisingly high and of the same order as previously found for structurally similar,\nbut simpler, molecules in these sources (Liu et al. 2001). In fact, Orion KL was reported to have\nthe highest glycine column density, but the interstellar molecule with structure closest to glycine,\nacetic acid, has never been detected there (Remijan et al. 2003).\nIn this paper, we investigate the above concerns by starting from new laboratory measurements of glycine that improve the Hamiltonian fit and thereby result in highly reliable interpolated\nfrequency predictions which provide the foundation for our discussion. We list and explain the\nessential criteria for identifying a new interstellar molecule such as glycine. Then we use these\ncriteria on key glycine spectral lines reported by Kuan et al. (2003) to interpret independent observational data for Orion KL, W51 el/e2, and Sgr B2(N-LMH), and show that their key lines fail\nthe tests required for a correct glycine identification. In investigating alternative identifications,\nwe find that the carriers of several important spectral lines which have been assigned to glycine\nare more logically assigned to other, more common species. Finally, we find that random choices\nof unidentified spectral lines can be used to generate reasonable rotational temperature diagrams\n7The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated\nunder cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\nn\n\n-3-\n\nsimilar to those published by Kuan et al. (2003).\n\n2.\n\nGLYCINE SPECTRAL LINE ANALYSIS AND PREDICTED REST\nFREQUENCIES\n\nThe microwave spectrum of conformer I of glycine was first recorded by Suenram & Lovas\n(1980) from 82 GHz to 113 GHz in a heated parallel plate Stark cell. This study provided the\nrotational analysis and rough dipole moment determination. Further measurements of the 14N\nquadrupole coupling hyperfine structure and Stark effect on low J transitions between 16 GHz and\n24.5 GHz were subsequently reported by Lovas et al. (1995). While these literature data provided\na firm basis for predicting transitions up to about 150 GHz for guiding past interstellar searches,\nthe 2 CT (standard deviation) uncertainties\' ranged from 1.5 MHz at 206 GHz to 2.8 MHz at 240\nGHz for the main interstellar transitions reported by Kuan et al. (2003). Recently, at Kharkow a\nheated quartz absorption cell was used to provide new measurements between 75 GHz and 260 GHz\nutilizing an automated synthesizer-based spectrometer described by Ilyushin et al. (2001). New\nglycine search frequencies could then be predicted by incorporating both the previously reported\ntransitions and the new measurements into a rotational analysis which employed the Watson Areduction Hamiltonian with quartic centrifugal distortion terms included (Watson 1977). The\ndetails of these laboratory measurements and Hamiltonian calculations will be reported in a future\npaper. For this paper, it is important to note that for the majority of the calculated transitions the\nuncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 10 or more from those used by Kuan et al. (2003).\nThus, we are starting our analysis with highly accurate glycine rest frequency predictions.\nTable 1 summarizes the reported glycine line detections in the direction of the hot molecular\ncores Sgr B2(N-LMH), Orion KL, and W51 el/e2. The first column lists a number that Kuan\net al. (2003) introduced to represent a particular glycine line. For the convenience of the reader,\nwe adopt this shorthand notation hereafter referred to as the "glycine line number". The second\ncolumn gives the rotational quantum numbers of the associated transitions, and the third identifies\neach reported transition as an a-type or a b-type. The fourth column lists our newly calculated\nglycine rest frequencies, and the fifth and sixth columns give the associated line strengths and\nupper energy levels. The final six columns in Table 1 list the observed LSR velocity and brightness\ntemperature of each glycine line reported for each source. We have listed in boldface the LSR\nvelocity and brightness temperature values for the lines that were displayed by Kuan et al. (2003).\n\'Unless otherwise noted, all uncertainties quoted in this paper are 2\nTaylor & Kuyatt (1994).\n\nc7\n\nor coverage factor k = 2 as described by\n\n-4-\n\n3 ESSENTIAL CRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHING THE IDENTIFICATION OF\n.\nA NEW INTERSTELLAR MOLECULE\nThe task of establishing the identification of a new interstellar molecule in a dense interstellar\nclouds is made more complicated by high spectral line densities. For example, at 3 mm wavelength\nSgr B2(N-LMH) has a spectral line density of 6.06 lines per 100 MHz, half of which are unidentified\n(F\'riedel et al. 2004). This is the highest reported line density in radio astronomy. Hence, the\ndetection of spectral lines with frequencies close to a new species is not in itself sufficient evidence\nfor a correct assignment. Consequently, there are several criteria to consider in securing the correct\nidentification of a new interstellar molecule such as glycine.\nRest Fkquencies: The most important criterion for establishing the identification of a new\ninterstellar molecule is that the rest frequencies must be established to a high degree of accuracy. Preferably, the spectral line astronomical rest frequencies to be used in the interstellar search\nshould have been directly measured in the laboratory. If such direct measurements are not available,\ninterpolation fitting of the available laboratory data from other frequencies should allow construction of a high precision Hamiltonian model which can be used to predict search frequencies with\nuncertainties on the order of 1 part in 10 million.\nFkquency Agreement: There must be frequency agreement among all detected transitions.\nThis means that an accurate astronomical rest frequency of the assigned transition must be in reasonable agreement with the frequency corresponding to the LSR velocity of the source. Variations\nin the LSR velocity of a given molecular species can occur when regions with different kinematics\ncontribute to the emission or absorption spectrum. However, it is evident that emission lines from\na given molecular species which emanate from a region with no large kinematic variance will have\na well-defined velocity field. Examples are the VLA measurements of the kinematics of methyl formate (HCOOCH3) toward OMC-1 by Hollis et al. (2003a) and ethyl cyanide (CH3CHzCN) toward\nSgr BB(N-LMH) by Hollis et al. (2003b). If there is a source velocity gradient, as established from\nobserved transitions of known molecules, it cannot be a random function of transition frequency or\nenergy level.\nFurthermore, it is not uncommon to have an interstellar spectral line from one species blend\nwith another line of either the same or another species. In order to correctly assign or confirm a\nline identification, a common standard is that the lines should be at least resolved by the Rayleigh\ncriterion. That is, the minimum distance between two spectral lines in frequency space must be such\nthat the maximum intensity of one line falls on the first null of the other (see, for example, Jenkins &\nWhite 1957; Sommerfeld 1964). This is approximately equivalent to requiring that overlapping lines\nbe separated by their full line width at half maximum intensity (assuming identical line profiles).\nIn practice, a more stringent criterion based on the signal-to-noise ratio is often needed whereby\ntwo overlapping lines can be considered resolved if they are at least separated at half-maximum\nintensity of the weakest line.\n\nBeam Dilution: Suppose one uses a singleelement radio telescope with circular aperture of\n\n-5diameter D (such as the NRAO 12 m) to observe separate transitions of some molecule at 50 GHz,\n100 GHz, and 150 GHz. The full half-power beam width (HPBW) of the telescope is approximately\ngiven by 1.22 X/D rad (Born & Wolf 1980; see also Rohlfs & Wilson 2000), so in this case the\ntelescope HPBW changes by a factor of 3 over the range of observations. As we will discuss,\nbeam dilution scales with source size squared and beam size squared. To examine the required\ncorrection for beam dilution, we can start with < NT >, the beam-averaged molecular column\ndensity determined from the integrated intensity of a rotation transition observed by a single\nelement radio telescope. In autocorrelation mode, with the assumptions of LTE and low optical\ndepthg (see, for example, Snyder et al. 2001; Dickens et al. 1997), < NT > is given by\n\n< NT >=\n\n1.67 W, 2 eEUITrot\nsp2u\n\n1014\n\ncm-2.\n\nIn equation (l),WT = ~ T dv in K km s-l, where TR is the radiation temperature of the source\nR\nand dv is the FWHM line width. T R is related to the measured antenna temperature T; (corrected\nfor atmospheric attenuation, rear spillover, blockage, ohmic losses, and forward spillover) by TR =\nT;/qc, where qc is the sourcebeam coupling efficiency (Kutner & Ulich 1981). Other terms in\nequation (1) are 2, the rotational partition function, E,, the upper rotational energy level, Trot,\nthe rotational temperature, S, the line strength, p 2 , the square of the dipole moment in Debye2,\nand u, the frequency in GHz. If the source is comparable to or smaller than the main beam, qc\n= q& B, where q& is the corrected main beam efficiency and is the fraction of power in the main\nbeam relative to the power in the main beam plus error beam (Jewel1 1990). B is the geometric\ncoupling efficiency between the main beam and the source, and is often called the beam filling\nfactor. Note that q& is related to the phase errors of the reflector surface and is thus a function\nof frequency. For example, for the NRAO 12 m, q& = 0.83 at 113 GHz and 0.45 at 240 GHz. The\nabove formalism is applicable to sources with angular extent smaller than or on the order of the\nmain beam. Highly extended sources may couple with some or all of the error beam and require a\ndifferent sourcebeam convolution.\nFor a circular Gaussian telescope beam size e b centered on the peak of a circular Gaussian\nsource of size e,,the resulting convolution yields a beam filling factor B given by (e.g., see equation\n(28) of Ulich & Haas 1976)\n\n\'The corrections to apply when the optical depth is not low and when the excitation is subthermal have been\ndiscussed by Goldsmith & Langer (1999), and the aspects of maser excitation have been examined by Reid & Moran\n(1988). Because we are following the assumptions of Kuan et al. (2003) that their reported glycine lines are optically\nthin and in LTE, we will confine our discussion to this particular case.\n\n-6-\n\nIf 8,>> e&,,\nB\n\nN\n\n1. When 8,\n\nN\n\nB\n\nN\n\n3.\n\n0.5, but if 8,<< 8b)\nB\n\nRelative Intensities: Once several molecular transition assignments have been made, their\nrelative intensities must be tested for consistency. For a source comparable to or smaller in angular\nsize than the main beam of the telescope, the relative intensity of two single lines is determined by\nthe corrected beam efficiencies, beam filling factors, dipole moments, line strengths, frequencies,\nenergy levels, and rotational temperature according to equation (1) a\ns\n\nConformer I glycine has an a-type dipole moment, pa = 0.911(6) D (3.039(20) x\nC m), and\nc m) ( L o w et d. 1995). Therefore, for a given\na b-type, pb = 0.697(10) D (2.325(34) x\nfrequency, the product Sp2 dictates that a-type transitions are stronger than b-type when S values\nare comparable.\n\nA typical property of prolate asymmetric rotors such a glycine is that two low K-1 &type and\ns\ntwo b-type transitions become degenerate as the transition frequencies increase. In this four-fold\ndegeneracy, all four transitions have the same rest frequency and energy levels, but different line\nstrengths for the a-type and the b-type. This effect begins at\n107 GHz for glycine and it is\nimportant because the lines with this degeneracy are the most likely to be detected. The total\nintensity of a four-fold degenerate line at frequency vi is given by the sum of the four individual\nN\n\nunresolved components,\n\n(2\n\nTi(k)), and the ratio of the ith degenerate line to the jth degenerate\na\n\nline is given by equation (1) as\n\nSimilar expressions can be derived for comparing the intensity of a single glycine line to either\na twc+fold or a four-fold degenerate glycine line.\n\nConfirming Bansitions: Once a candidate line is assigned, the assumption of optical thinness\nunder LTE conditions allows predictions of intensities of additional confirming transitions unless\nline self-absorption, maser activity, or some other mitigating effect is evident. Hence, a key test of\nthe correctness of the assignment of a transition is that any other transitions connected by favorable\ntransition probabilities must also be present if the relative intensity predictions lead to detectable\nsignal levels.\n\n-7The maximum line strength for a-type asymmetric rotor R-branch transitions of a molecule\nlike glycine occurs when S approaches J\xe2\x80\x99, the upper level value of J. For a-type transitions, this\nmeans that the strongest transitions in a series will be those for which J\xe2\x80\x99K~,,K; K - ~ , = J\xe2\x80\x98o,J!-J\nK~\nJ\xe2\x80\x99-lo,J!-l or 5\xe2\x80\x991,~\xe2\x80\x99 J\xe2\x80\x99-11,~!-1. The next strongest in this series will be J\xe2\x80\x991,Jt-l - J1-11,Jt-2 or J \xe2\x80\x99 ~ , J , - ~\n- J\xe2\x80\x99-12,~!-2. For b-type transitions, the maximum line strength occurs when S approaches J\xe2\x80\x99-1.\nHere the strongest transitions will be those for which J\xe2\x80\x99o,J!- J\xe2\x80\x99-11,~!-1or J\xe2\x80\x99~,J!

(2003) state that their 27 glycine lines (Table 1) are detected in one or more\nhot molecular cores (HMCs). We note that HMCs are compact objects where interferometric\nmeasurements have shown that structurally similar but simpler large molecules are concentrated\nwith diameters < 10\xe2\x80\x9d. For example, the HMC of one of their sources, Sgr B2(N-LMH), is 4\xe2\x80\x9d as\nmeasured in ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2CN) and vinyl cyanide (CH2CHCN) by Liu & Snyder (1999).\nOn the other hand, Kuan et al. (2003) assume that their HMC glycine lines are optically thin\nand in LTE and do not correct for beam dilution in their rotational temperature diagrams- a tacit\nassumption that their glycine sources are extended enough to at least fill their beam. In the case of\nOrion KL, they speculated that the glycine emission is extended because the rotational temperature\ndiagram has a \xe2\x80\x9dtight fit\xe2\x80\x9d and, in addition, perhaps the emission is not perfectly centered at the\nnominal compact ridge position. They used this scenario to reject the Orion glycine negative results\nfound by Combes et al. (1996) with the IRAM 30 m telescope because the narrower 30 m beam\nmight have missed a significant portion of the glycine emission observed by the wider NRAO 12 m\nbeam. The widest 12 m beam used for the Kuan et al. (2003) observations is 45\xe2\x80\x9d at the lowest\nreported frequency in Table 1, 130,346.775 MHz, which corresponds to glycine line 1.\n\n-\n\nIn the following, we will apply the criteria from $3 to examine available observational data\nfor the possibility that the spectral lines assigned to glycine have been misidentified. In order to\naddress the ambiguities introduced by the glycine source sizes, we will assume two cases: (1) the\nglycine emission sources are HMCs with core diameters typically < 10\xe2\x80\x9d; or (2) glycine fills the beam\nof the 12 rn t.e!escopa and hence is extended over at least 45\xe2\x80\x9d in each source. For our analysis we\nwill use our newly determined astronomical rest frequencies listed in Table 1.\n\n-84.1.\n\nVLA Searches for Glycine in Compact Sources: Orion and Sgr BB(N-LMH)\n\nIn 2001, Hollis et al. (2003b) conducted a deep Q-band (A -7 mm) search with the Very Large\nArray (VLA) toward OMC-1 in four rotational transitions of conformer I glycine. The 52000.0\nphase center for their observations was a = 5h35m148.25and 6 = -5\xe2\x80\x9922\xe2\x80\x9935\xe2\x80\x9d.5, which is midway\nbetween the Orion hot core source and the peak formic acid position of Liu et al. (2002). The\nKuan et al. (2003) pointing position precessed from B1950.0 to 52000.0 was cr = 5h35m14s.48 and\n6 = -5\xe2\x80\x9922/36\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.6 toward Orion KL. The average 12 m telescope half-power beam width (HPBW)\nfor the Orion observations of Kuan et al. (2003) was N 41\xe2\x80\x9d and the VLA primary beam N 45\xe2\x80\x9d, so\nthe difference in pointing positions is not significant. The best VLA upper limits of Hollis et al.\n(2003b) were for the 7 0 , ~ 60,6 transition at 47,753.841(28) MHz with S = 6.851, E, = 8.657 K,\nand synthesized telescope beam size \xe2\x82\xac3* = 6\xe2\x80\x9d: < NT > < 8.0 x 1014 cm-2 for Trot = 43 K; and\n< NT > < 25.2 x 1014 cm-2 for Trot 100 K. Kuan et al. (2003) found < NT > = 4.37 x 1014\n=\ncm-2 for T o = 141 K, which is below the upper limits of Hollis et al. (2003b) only if there is no\nrt\nsignificant beam dilution in the 12 m results for Orion KL. However, if the glycine source size is\n6\xe2\x80\x9d in diameter (suggested by Hollis et al. 2003b), then the 12 m glycine column density < NT >\nbecomes 2.08 x 10l6 cm-2, which is far above the VLA upper limits.\nIn 2003, Hollis et al. (2003a) repeated their VLA Q-band glycine search toward Sgr B2(NLMH). Again the results were negative, and the best upper limits were for the 7 0 , ~ 60,s transition\nobserved with synthesized beam 1.N5x1.ff4 the direction of the K2 position. They reached an\nin\nupper limit of < NT > < 1.4 x 1017 cm-2 for Trot 170 K. In this same source, Kuan et al. (2003)\n=\nreported < NT > = 4.16 x 1014 cm-2 for T o= 76 K, from observations with an average HPBW\nrt\nof 38\xe2\x80\x9d. If the glycine source size is comparable to the VLA synthesized beam, then the 12 m glycine\ncolumn density < NT > becomes 2.67 x 1017 cm-2, which is again above the VLA upper limits.\nIn summary, the VLA glycine negative results (Hollis et al. 2003b; 2003a) contradict the glycine\ndetection reports only if the Orion glycine sources in Orion and Sgr B2(N-LMH) are compact.\nHowever, as discussed previously, Kuan et al. (2003) assumed that their glycine emission sources are\nextended and at least 45\xe2\x80\x9d in diameter. In the following sections, we will examine this assumption.\n\n4.2.\n\nSearch for Glycine in Extended Sources: Orion KL\n\nA direct way to examine the assumption of Kuan et al. (2003) that their reported glycine\nline sources are extended is to use their reported results to generate predicted intensities for other\nglycine lines that they did not observe. These predictions can be checked against other single\nelement telescope observations that would be sensitive to glycine emission from extended sources.\nIn particular, we observed interstellar acetone [(CH3)2CO] in 1995 March with the NRAO 12 m\nradio telescope toward Sgr B2(N) (Snyder et al. 2002). During Orion time, we searched for the\nnearly four-fold degenerate 5 = 19-18 glycine transitions around 113,336 MHz. Our Orion KL\npointing position was essentially identical to that used by Kuan et al. (2003): exactly the same\n\n-9right ascension and within 9\xe2\x80\x9d in declination. The NRAO 3 mm singlesideband SIS receiver had\nsideband rejection 2 25 db and effective system temperature (referenced to above the atmosphere\nand including rear and forward spillover efficiencies) of 300 K. Chopper calibration corrected for\natmospheric extinction and telescope losses and the resultant data are on the T;Z temperature scale\n(Kutner and Ulich 1981). Data were taken while position switching 30\xe2\x80\x99 in azimuth, while Kuan et\nal. (2003) switched by 20\xe2\x80\x99. The half power beam width (FWHM) was -56\xe2\x80\x9d at 113.3 GHz. The\nspectrometer consisted of the NRAO Hybrid Spectrometer with two 256 channel filter banks used\nas a backup. The Hybrid Spectrometer was operated with two polarization IFs in parallel, with 300\nMHz bandwidth and 768 Hanning-smoothed channels per IF, giving an effective spectral resolution\nof 0.781 MHz. The filter banks were operated with two IFs in parallel, with 250 kHz resolution in\none bank and 500 kHz in the other. Therefore, this system was exactly the same as that used by\nKuan et al. (2003) except that they chose to use wider filters for their observations. The NRAO\n12 m data were reduced using the NRAO data reduction package UniPOPS (Salter, Maddalena, &\nGarwood 1995) lo.\nN\n\nThe Kuan et al. (2003) pointing position toward Orion KL was a(B1950.0) = 5h32m47s.0and\nh(B1950.0) = -5\xe2\x80\x9924\xe2\x80\x9930\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.0. Our pointing position was a(B1950.0) = 5h32m47s.0 and h(B1950.0) =\n-5\xe2\x80\x9924\xe2\x80\x9921\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.0, which in our N 56\xe2\x80\x9d beam was only a negligible 9\xe2\x80\x9d difference. Table 2 summarizes our\nOrion KL search frequencies for the J = 19-18 glycine transitions and for the test lines used to\ncheck the operation of the system. The first column lists rest frequencies; the second and third\nlist molecular identifications (when known) and rotational quantum numbers; the fourth, fifth, and\nsixth columns give the transition types, line strengths, and upper energy levels; and the next two\ncolumns give intensities and line widths for Orion KL. Figure 1 shows the Orion KL spectra from\n113,323 to 113,354 MHz (centered at 113,339 MHz) observed with the Hybrid Spectrometer on the\nNRAO 12 m. The spectral positions of the negative results for the nearly four-fold degenerate J\n= 19-18 glycine lines (listed in Table 2) are marked by the four vertical lines. The unidentified\nline U113.226 is on the left, and the 61-60 E1 transition of CH30D is on the right; these two lines\nserved as system checks.\nKuan et al.(2003) reported the detection of 15 optically thin glycine lines in the direction of\nOrion KL. If they were glycine, lines 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 25 in Table 1 would\nbe single transitions. Lines 11, 21, 24, and 26 would be four-fold degenerate. Of these 15 lines,\nnone contained connecting confirming transitions, which would be a key test of the correctness of\nthe glycine assignment as discussed in $3. Among these, we note that lines 5, 14, 15, 16, and 26\nmarginally meet the Rayleigh criterion for spectral resolution. By applying the discussion in 53\nand adapting equation 4 to each of the reported Orion glycine lines, we can use each reported line\nto make an independent prediction of the intensity of the nearly four-fold degenerate J = 19-18\nglycine lines that we did not detect, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the range of predicted\nintensities that we should have observed with the NRAO 12 m telescope for each of the 15 of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cUniPOPS information i available at http://www.gb.nrao.edu/-rmaddale/140ft/unipops/unipops~toc.html.\ns\n\n- 10 -\n\nreported Orion glycine transitions emanating from a 45\xe2\x80\x9d extended source. For each prediction,\nthree different points are labeled to denote the Kuan et al. (2003) rotational temperature and its\nuncertainties, Trot = 141+:$ K. The uncertainties for each rotational temperature point are based\non the rms noise level given for each reported glycine line by Kuan et al. (2003) (see Table 1). The\ndotted line in Figure 2 shows the 3.7 mK noise level from Figure 1. For example, Orion line 21\nhas a peak intensity TR* = 230f 10.0 mK as observed with a 30\xe2\x80\x9d beam. In Table 1, it is assigned\nas a degenerate quartet of two a-type and two b-type glycine lines at 206,468 MHz: 350,35-340,34;\nand\n~\n351,35-341,~;\n350,35-341,~; 3 5 1 ~ 5 - 3 4 0 , If .line 21 is an optically thin glycine line in LTE with\na rotational temperature of 141 K, then the nearly blended J = 19 - 18 quartet would appear in\nFigure 1 with peak intensity TR* 143 mK f 7 mK for an extended source size of 0, = 45\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAll of the predictions plotted in Figure 2 are above the 3.7 mK noise level from Figure 1. Hence,\nif the Orion reported glycine detection were correct, we should have detected a blended line with\nintensity 5 mK 5 Tk I 205 mK for the J = 19 - 18 glycine quartet. Since we did not, we conclude\nthat glycine has not been detected in an extended source in Orion KL. In 54.1, we ruled out the\ndetection of glycine in a compact source in Orion. Consequently, we conclude that the presence of\ninterstellar glycine has not been verified in Orion KL.\nN\n\n4.3.\n\nSearch for Glycine in Extended Sources: W51\n\nDuring the 1995 March observations with the NRAO 12 m, we also searched for the fourfold nearly degenerate J = 19 - 18 glycine transitions in the direction of W51. The Kuan et\nal. (2003) pointing position toward W51 el/e2 was (r(B1950.0) = 1gh21m26\xe2\x80\x99.3 and S(B1950.0)\n= +14O24\xe2\x80\x9939\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.0. Our W51 pointing position was a(B1950.0) = 1gh21m26\xe2\x80\x99.3 and S(B1950.0) =\n+14O24\xe2\x80\x9943\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.0, which in our 56\xe2\x80\x9d beam was only a negligible 4\xe2\x80\x9d difference. As with the Orion KL\nobservations, our W51 data were taken while position switching 30\xe2\x80\x99 in azimuth, while Kuan et\nal. (2003) switched 20\xe2\x80\x99. Again, the system was exactly the same as that used by Kuan et al.\n(2003) except that they used wider filters. In Table 2, the last two columns give intensities and\nline widths for the W51 search frequencies for the J = 19-18 glycine transitions and for the test\nlines used to check the operation of the system; they are the same transitions used for the Orion\nKL search. Figure 3 shows the W51 spectra from 113,323 to 113,354 MHz (centered at 113,339\nMHz) observed with the Hybrid Spectrometer on the NRAO 12 m. As in the case of Orion KL, the\nspectral positions of the negative results for the nearly four-fold degenerate J = 19-18 glycine lines\n(listed in Table 2) are marked by the four vertical lines centered at 113,336 MHz. As in Figure 1,\nthe system checks are the unidentified line U113.226 on the left, and the weak 61-60 E1 transition\nof CH30D on the right.\nN\n\nKuan et al.(2003) reported the detection of 16 optically thin glycine lines in the direction of\nW51. If these lines were glycine, lines 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, and 25 in Table 1 would be single\ntransitions. Line 12 would be two-fold degenerate and lines 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, and 27 would be\nfour-fold degenerate. Of these 16 lines, none contained connecting confirming transitions, which\n\n-\n\n11 -\n\nwould be a key test of the correctness of the glycine assignment as discussed in 53. Among the\ndisplayed spectra, line 27 does not meet the Rayleigh criterion for spectral resolution. As with\nthe Orion KL data, we can use the intensity of each of the reported glycine lines to independently\npredict the intensity of the nearly four-fold degenerate J = 19-18 glycine lines at 113,366 MHz that\nwe did not detect, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the range of predicted intensities that\nwe should have observed with the NRAO 12 m telescope for each of the 16 reported W51 glycine\ntransitions emanating from a 45\xe2\x80\x9d extended source. As in Figure 2, three different points are labeled\nfor each prediction to denote the Kuan et al. (2003) rotational temperature and its uncertainties,\nTrot = 1212;; K. The uncertainties for each rotational temperature point are based on the rms\nnoise level given for each reported glycine line by Kuan et al. (2003) (see Table 1). The dotted line\nin Figure 4 shows the 6.4 mK noise level from Figure 3. All of the predictions plotted in Figure\n4, except those from line 19, are above the this noise level. Hence, the intensities of 15 out of 16\nglycine lines predict that we should have detected a blended J = 19 - 18 glycine line quartet with\nintensity 10 mK 5 Tk 5 105 mK if the reported W51 glycine detection is correct. Since we did\nnot, we conclude that the presence of interstellar glycine has not been verified in W51.\n\n4.4.\n\nSearch for Glycine in Extended Sources: Sgr B2(N-LMH)\n\nKuan et al.(2003) assigned glycine transitions to 13 emission lines in the direction of Sgr B2(NLMH) at a(B1950.0) = 17h44m10s.20 and b(B1950.0) = -28\xe2\x80\x9d21\xe2\x80\x9915\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99.0. Their rest frequencies were\ncalculated with respect to V L ~ R 64 km s-\xe2\x80\x99. Their emission lines 1, 2, 6, and 7 in Table 1 were\n=\nassigned to single glycine transitions. Line 10 would have a fivefold degeneracy and line 12 a t w e\nfold if they were glycine. Lines 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 26 would be four-fold degenerate. Of these\n13 lines, only lines 21 and 22 would contain connecting confirming transitions, a key test of the\ncorrectness of the assignment as discussed in $3. Only lines 19, 20, 21, 23, and 26 were displayed by\nKuan et al. (2003); of these, lines 19, 21, and 23 marginally meet the Rayleigh criterion for spectral\nresolution. Fortunately, Nummelin et al. (1998) surveyed Sgr B2(N) in the direction a(B1950.0) =\n17h44m108.10\nand 6(B1950.0) = -28\xe2\x80\x9d21\xe2\x80\x9917\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.0between 218.3 and 263.55 GHz with the 15 m Swedish\nESO-Submillimetre Telescope (SEST). Their position coincided with the Sgr B2(N-LMH) position\nused by Kuan et al. (2003). Their beam width was\n20\xe2\x80\x9d (adequate for extended sources), and\ntheir frequency range covered several important glycine transitions, which we will discuss. Their\nrest frequencies were calculated with respect to VLSR 62 km s-\xe2\x80\x99.\n=\nN\n\nBy applying the discussion in 53 to predict the expected glycine intensities, it is straightforward\nto use the Nummelin et al. (1998) data to examine the Sgr B2(N-LMH) glycine assignments of\nKuan et al. (2003). If lines 26 and 27 were glycine, for any reasonable temperature their line\nstrengths would make them the the two strongest glycine lines in Table 1. Line 26 was observed\nby Kuan et al. (2003) with the NRAO 12m telescope to have T k = 94 mK. It was assigned to\na degenerate glycine quartet consisting of two &type and two btype transitions with J = 40 39, K-1 = 1 or 2 at 240,899.5 MHz. Nummelin et al. (1998) detected this line with SEST; it\n\n-\n\n12 -\n\nhas a main beam brightness temperature Tmb = 300 mK. Kuan et al. (2003) assigned line 27 to\na degenerate glycine quartet with J = 41 - 40, K-1 = 0 or 1 at 241,373.3 MHz. While line 27\nwould be expected to be slightly stronger than line 26, it was reported by Kuan et al. (2003) to be\nmasked by unidentified interlopers in their Sgr BS(N-LMH) 12m data and the spectrum was not\ndisplayed. However, this interloper masking argument is not supported by the data of Nummelin\net al. (1998), which show not only that the line 27 frequency falls in a relatively clear spectral\nregion in Sgr BZ(N-LMH), but also that line 27 was not detected (as we will discuss).\nNummelin et al. (1998) reported all of their data in units of K on the main beam brightness\ntemperature ( T m b ) scale. Hence, &, the main beam efficiency has already been taken into account,\nand equation 4 may be used for intensity predictions with T d substituted for T&/&. To conduct\nour analysis, we used the T d = 300 mK intensity (with an estimated 50 mK rms noise level\nuncertainty) of line 26 from Nummelin et al. (2003) as a basis for predicting the intensities of those\nK-1 = 1 or 2 degenerate glycine quartet lines connected to line 26 via two a-type and two b-type\ntransitions. By confining our predictions to the Nummelin et al. (1998) data set, we eliminated any\nproblems caused by calibration differences between the NRAO 12 m and SEST telescopes. Table\n3 lists all of the K-1 = 1 or 2 degenerate glycine lines that fall in the 218.3 - 263.55 GHz range of\nthe Nummelin et al. (1998) survey that would be radiatively connected to line 26 if its assignment\nto the degenerate glycine quartet of two a-type and two b-type transitions with J = 40 - 39, K-1\n= 1 or 2, were correct. The first column lists the individual quantum numbers of each degenerate\nfrequency group, the second lists the transition type, and the third lists the rest frequency of each\ndegenerate glycine line. Note that the line quartets are arranged in descending order of frequency.\nThe top transition in each degenerate quartet feeds directly into the top transition in the next\nlower frequency degenerate quartet, the second transition in each degenerate quartet feeds directly\ninto the second transition in the next lower degenerate quartet, etc. The fourth column in Table\n3 gives the line strengths and the fifth the upper state energy levels. The next column gives the\npredicted values of T m b for each line if the assignment of line 26 to the J = 40 - 39, K-1 = 1 or 2,\ndegenerate glycine transition at 240,899.5 MHz were correct. These predicted T m b values (as well\nas the values for the upper and lower error bars) were calculated for a gas rotational temperature\nof 75 K with an uncertainty ranging from 59 K to 104 K (Kuan et al. 2003) in addition to the 50\nmK rms noise level uncertainty for line 26. The next column lists what was observed by Nummelin\net al. (1998) at each frequency: the peak Tmb value for any clearly resolved line; the upper limit\nto the noise level if no line is present; or the notation ... indicating that the line is masked by the\nwings of an interloper line. The final column in Table 3 lists relevant comments, if any, for each\nobserved frequency. Table 4 follows the format of Table 3 for the stronger K-1 = 0 or 1 degenerate\nglycine lines that fall in the same range of the Nummelin et al. (1998) survey. Again, the predicted\nintensities in Table 4 are based on the observed intensity of Tmb = 300 mK for line 26 (with an\nestimated 50 mK rms noise level uncertainty) and the assumption that it can be assigned to glycine.\nExamination of Table 3 shows that the K-1 = 1 or 2 frequencies of the degenerate glycine\nquartets J = 43 - 42, 38 - 37, and 37 - 36 are obscured by the wings of lines previously identified by\n\n-\n\n13 -\n\nNummelin et al. (1998). U235.085 at 235,085 MHz would be a possible candidate for the J = 39\n\n- 38, K-1 = 1 or 2, degenerate glycine transition at 235,084.8 MHz, but the peak intensity is low.\nFinally, the glycine lines missing from the Nummelin et al. (1998) data at the 100 mK level are\nthe K-1 = 1 or 2 frequencies of the degenerate glycine quartets J = 42 - 41 at 252,531.295 MHz\nand 41 - 40 at 246,716.164 MHz. The data for these missing lines and for line 26 at 240,900.647\nMHz are shown in Figures 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c), adapted from the Sgr B2(N) data and molecular\nassignments of Nummelin et al. (1998).\nN\n\nTable 4 shows that the K-1 = 0 or 1 frequencies of the degenerate glycine quartets J = 40\n\n- 39, 39 - 38, and 38 - 37 are obscured by the wings of lines previously identified by Nummelin\net al. (1998). In addition, the spectral region around the degenerate glycine transition J = 44 43 at 258,820.597 MHz is dominated by what appears to be narrow, weak interference spikes in\nthe Nummelin et al. (1998) data for Sgr B2(N), Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(NW). The K-1 = 0 or 1\nglycine lines missing from the Nummelin et d. (1998) data at the 50 mK level are the J = 43\n- 42 degenerate quartet at 253,005.255 MHz. Furthermore, the J = 42 - 41 degenerate quartet at\n247,189.500 MHz and the J = 41 - 40 degenerate quartet at 241,373.340 MHz (line 27 of Kuan et\nal. 2003) are missing at the 100 mK level. The data for these missing lines are shown in Figures\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5(d), 5(e), and 5(f).\nBecause of the five missing key quartets summarized in Tables 3 and 4 and shown in Figure\n5, we conclude that glycine has not been detected in an extended source in Sgr B2(N). In $4.1, we\nruled out the detection of glycine in a compact source in Sgr B2(N-LMH). Thus, we conclude that\nthe presence of interstellar glycine has not been verified in Sgr B2(N).\n\n4.5.\n\nAlternative Identifications\n\nNow that we have shown that the carriers of key spectral lines assigned to glycine by Kuan\net al. (2003) can not be verified as interstellar glycine, in this section, we suggest some logical\nassignments to other, more common species. Our proposed carriers are listed in Table 5. The\nfirst and second columns list the line number and rest frequency reported by Kuan et al. (2003).\nThe third, fourth, and fifth columns list the possible molecular candidates, the quantum numbers,\nand rest frequencies of their transitions. The last column gives the sources where the lines were\nreported. Our proposed carriers are presented to underline the growing impact of line confusion\non the difficult problem of identifying new interstellar species. In the following, we discuss the\nsuggested identifications in Table 5 with the caveat that they will have to be substantiated by\nfurther observational work.\nIn $1,we pointed out that one of the peculiarities in the glycine detection report of Kuan et\nal. (2003) was that each of their three glycine sources (Orion, W51 el/e2, and Sgr B2(N-LMH))\nwas observed to contain no more than 13 to 16 of the 27 independent spectral lines features and\nonly 3 of the 27 spectral line features were found to be common to all three sources: lines 21,\n\n- 14 -\n\n24, and 26 in Table 1. Consequently, we will begin with a discussion of lines 21 and 24. Line\n21 was observed with the NRAO 12 m telescope with a 30" beam, and was misassigned to the\nfour-fold degenerate glycine quartet 350,35-341,34, 351,35-341,~,350,35-340,~,\nand 351,35-340,34 at\n206,468 MHz. In all 3 sources, line 21 is anomalously strong relative to all other purported glycine\ntransitions that were observed. This suggests that even in the unlikely event that all the other\nlines reported by Kuan et al. (2003) belong to the same species, then line 21 most likely belongs\nto another molecular species altogether. We propose that a likely carrier of line 21 is vibrationally\nexcited ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2CN) which has recently been shown to be a common constituent of\nSgr B2(N-LMH) (Mehringer et al. 2004). The 236,lS - 226~7 and E and 236~7 226~6 and E\nA\nA\ntransitions of vibrationally excited ethyl cyanide (ub=l) span the range of 206,466.6 to 206,467.3\nMHz (J. C. Pearson, private communication) and would be a logical assignment for line 21. Line\n24 was misassigned to the nearly four-fold degenerate glycine quartet 3633-354~2,364~3-354~2,\n363~3-353~2, 364,33-353,32 at an average observed frequency of 228,418.8 MHz. Kuan et al.\nand\n(2003) dismissed the frequency coincidence of the J = 24 - 23, K = l l transition doublet of vinyl\ncyanide (CH2CHCN) at 228,418.1 MHz as an "unlikely" u=2 state of the molecule. However, these\ntransitions are actually in the v15=l state, which Nummelin & Bergman (1999) have shown to be\ncommon for vinyl cyanide emission as observed with the SEST 15m telescope in SgrBZ(N). Thus,\nline 24 is most likely 4 5 = l vinyl cyanide, a common constituent of interstellar clouds. Finally, we\nnote that the third key line, line 26, has the same flux ( w 6 Jy) in the 20" beam of Nummelin\net al. (1998) as it has in the 26" beam of Kuan et al. (2003). This suggests that the carrier of\nline 26 will also be a constituent of a somewhat compact source, such as a hot molecular core.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nIn addition to lines 21 and 24, we have examined potential carriers for 7 other reported glycine\nlines that were detected in only one or two of the three glycine sources. These will be discussed\nin order of frequency as they are listed in Table 5. Line 6 is very close to a favorable transition of\nHCOOCH3 (methyl formate"), a molecule found in abundance in both Sgr B2(N) and Orion. Line\n7 is near favorable transitions of CH2CDCN (deuterated vinyl cyanide") and H2CCCC (butadiynyl\nradical). Line 8 is near c-CI3CCH2 (cyclopropenylidene"). Line 10 is almost coincident with gCH3CHzOH (gauche ethanol) in the ground state. Kuan et al. (2003) misidentified this as a u\n= 1 vibrationally excited state of ethanol. The frequency of line 12 agrees almost exactly with\na likely transition of CH2DCH2CN". Line 13 is almost coincident with transitions of both ethyl\ncyanide12 and acetone ((CH3)2CO). The ethyl cyanide line is actually in the v15=l state, not u=2\nas noted by Kuan et al. (2003). Finally, the frequency of line 16 agrees almost perfectly with the\n2 listed transitions of acetone12. In summary, there are good alternative candidates for 9 of the\nlines reported as glycine that are more likely to be detectable than glycine. These alternatives can\neasily be checked by further observational work.\n"Also noted by Kuan et a . (2003)as a possible line carrier candidate, but dismissed without further consideration.\nl\n"Listed a "unlikely" by Kuan et al. (2003),but should still be considered as a line carrier candidate unless ruled\ns\nout by further observations.\n\n-\n\n5.\n\n15 -\n\nGLYCINE ROTATIONAL TEMPERATURE DIAGRAMS\n\nKuan et al. (2003) used rotation temperature diagrams constructed from Sgr B2(N-LMH),\nOrion KL, and W51 el/e2 data to bolster their arguments for the identification of glycine. In\nAppendix A, we have noted that rotational temperature diagrams can not be used as independent\ntools to verify interstellar spectral line identifications because the frequency parameter in equation\nA4 or A5 will dominate the integrated intensity, line strength, and dipole moment terms for typical\nspectral line data in the millimeter or submillimeter range. In the following discussion, we illustrate\nthis important point with two molecular examples: chlorine nitrate (35C10N02), a molecule which\nis unlikely to be detected in the interstellar medium with current telescopes, and glycine. The\nchlorine nitrate rest frequencies were calculated from the data of Suenram & L o w (1984). As\na data base, we used the 123 unidentified (U) lines detected with the BIMA Array by Friedel et\nal. (2004) toward Sgr B2(N-LMH) at 3 mm wavelength. We searched this U line data base for\napparent transitions of chlorine nitrate and glycine with the following criteria for matching lines:\n1. The 2 0 frequency uncertainty of each calculated chlorine nitrate and glycine transition had\nto be less than 2.82 MHz (equivalent to twice the largest la uncertainty from Kuan et al.\n2003). This uncertainty turned out to be less than 1.04 MHz for chlorine nitrate and less\nthan 1.84 MHz for glycine.\n\n2. Fkiedel et al. (2004) established the rest frequency of each U line by assuming a VLSR of 64\nkm s-\'. Kuan et al. (2003) allowed the velocity range of their reported glycine lines to range\nbetween 58 and 75 km s-l. Therefore, we allowed a tolerance in our U line frequencies which\ncorresponded to a VLSR of 6:\n4\'\n;\nkm s-l with an additional uncertainty of f 390 kHz due t o\nthe spectral resolution used by Fkiedel et al. (2004) for the U line observations.\n\n3. The width of each matched U line had to be between 2.8 and 12.7 km s-l, which is the\nspread in line widths from the data in Kuan et al. (2003) toward Sgr B2(N). There were 2\nexceptions to this with 35C10N02 and 2 with glycine, but the uncertainties easily reached\ninto this range.\n4. We selected only U lines whose intensity was not too great for the associated transition. If\nthe U line appeared to be a blend of transitions from several species, it was not used.\nTable 6 lists the chlorine nitrate, glycine, and U line frequencies that will be used in our discussion\nof rotational temperature diagrams. The first two columns list calculated rest frequencies and\nthe corresponding transitions. The third column lists U lines which were selected using the four\ncriteria listed above. The last column contains relevant comments. From our search, 8 U lines\nmatched 15 degenerate and nondegenerate chlorine nitrate transitions and 11 U lines matched\n13 degenerate and nondegenerate glycine transitions. These are the lines listed in Table 6 where\ncalculated frequencies of chlorine nitrate and glycine (first column) are paired with specific U lines\n(third column). Using these calculated frequencies in equation A4 and assuming no beam dilution, a\n\n- 16 -\n\nrotational temperature diagram was constructed for each species which gave rotational temperatures\nand total column densities. Figure 6 shows the rotational temperature diagram for chlorine nitrate\nwhich gives a total column density13, < NT >, of 2.5(6)x1Ol7 cm-2 and a rotational temperature of\n54(8) K. Figure 7 shows the rotational temperature diagram for glycine, which gives a total column\ndensity, < NT >, of 8.5(9)x1Ol6 cm-2 and a rotation temperature of 79(9) K. While these diagrams\nand rotation temperatures look reasonable, they do not signify detections, nor are they supporting\nevidence of detections. We can see how improbable the results are by examining the total column\ndensities. For chlorine nitrate, the total column density is far too large and nearly equivalent to\nthat of methanol (CH30H) in Sgr B2(N-LMH) found by Pei et al. (2000). For example, if we\nassume that the H2 column density is 1 - 8 ~ 1 0 ~ ~ Sagittarius B2(N) (Kuan, Mehringer, &\ntoward\nSnyder 1996; Lis et al. 1993), the chlorine nitrate column density gives a relative abundance of\n0.3-2.5~10-~.\nSchilke, Phillips, & Wang (1995) state that HC1 should contain 1/3 of the gas phase\nC1 and Zmuidzinas et al. (1995) give the relative abundance of HC1 toward Sagittarius B2(N) as\n-lo-\xe2\x80\x99. This would mean that if we believed our rotational temperature diagram results, chlorine\nnitrate would be 3-25 times more abundant than HC1, an obviously ludicrous conclusion. While\nthe rotational temperature for glycine derived from randomly coincident U lines may seem to agree\nwith Kuan et al. (2003), the total column density is more than two orders of magnitude greater.\nFinally, we note that in the frequency range that we searched, the rotational temperature\ndiagram results predicted several strong transitions of both chlorine nitrate and glycine that should\nhave been detected by Friedel et al.(2004), but were not. These lines are noted in Table 6 where the\nthird column lists \xe2\x80\x9dNone\xe2\x80\x9d to signify that no U line (which corresponded to either a chlorine nitrate\nor a glycine calculated frequency) was detected. For each of these lines, the notes give the minimum\nexpected intensity (in c)relative to the rms noise level of the spectral window in which each should\nappear. Each minimum expected intensity was calculated by taking the predicted total column\ndensity and rotation temperature for the appropriate species and calculating the column density\nof the upper state of the transition. From this the integrated line intensity (WI from equation\nA4) was found. This was then divided by 12.7 km s-\xe2\x80\x99 (the largest line width allowed) giving the\nminimum expected peak intensity in J y beam-\xe2\x80\x99. This peak intensity was then divided by the rms\nnoise level (assumed to be 1 c) in the appropriate spectral window to give the minimum expected\nintensity in units of c. These missing strong lines of chlorine nitrate and glycine reinforce the fact\nthat rotational temperature diagrams used without adequate spectroscopic evidence supporting the\nmolecular identification can lead to incorrect results.\nWe conclude that these rotational temperature diagrams can not provide reliable independent\nsupporting evidence for interstellar molecular identifications because, particularly for weak lines,\nequation A4 will be dominated by l/v3. Conversely, for any \xe2\x80\x9cforest\xe2\x80\x9d of weak lines spread across\na large enough frequency band, one can construct a reasonable looking rotation diagram for any\nspecies, even one as unlikely as interstellar chlorine nitrate.\n-\n\n13The column density and temperature uncertainties are la from the weighted least squares fit.\n\n-\n\n6.\n\n17-\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAs we discussed in 31, there are several pecularities if the lines reported by Kuan et al. (2003) in\nSgr B2 (N-LMH), Orion KL, and W51el/e2 belong to interstellar glycine. Therefore, we examined\ntheir assignments of key glycine transitions to the spectral lines listed in Table 1. We noted that\ntheir lack of correction for beam dilution amounted to the tacit assumption that their glycine\nsources have an extended source size with 8,1 45\xe2\x80\x9d. In Orion KL, we found that none of the 15\nglycine line assignments could be verified because the reported intensities of all 15 lines predict\nthat a major glycine quartet (J=19-18, K-1 = 0 or 1) should have been detected in our Orion data\nfrom the NRAO 12 m telescope (Figures 1 and 2). So we can conclude that the Orion spectral\nlines reported by Kuan et al. (2003) (column 8, Table 1) are not glycine. Previously, the VLA data\nof Hollis et al. (2003a) established upper limits in Orion for compact glycine sources. Therefore,\nglycine has not been verified in either extended or in compact sources in Orion. In W51el/e2, 16\nlines were assigned to glycine. Fifteen of the 16 line intensities lend to the predictions that the\nJ=19-18, K-1 = 0 or 1 glycine quartets should have been detected in our W51 data from the NRAO\n12 m telescope (Figures 3 and 4). Since our spectra show a negative result, we can conclude that\nthe reported W51 spectral lines are also not glycine (column 9, Table 1). In the direction of Sgr B2\n(N-LMH), only 13 lines were assigned to glycine but the situation is slightly more complicated by\nthe high spectral line density. However, it can be simplified by recognizing that, based on both line\nstrength values and intensity calculations, the two strongest glycine lines should be those assigned\nto lines 26 and 27 in column 7 of Table 1. Line 26 appears with a peak intensity of 300 mK in the\nSgr B2(N) band scan data of Nummelin et al. (1998), but the important connected lines, J=42-41\nand 41-40 in the K-1 =1 or 2 series, are missing altogether (Table 3). Furthermore, line 27 should\nbe stronger than line 26, but it too is missing, along with the connected J=43-42 and 42-41 lines in\nthe K-1 = 0 or 1 series (Table 4). All of these key glycine lines strongly connect major K-1 = 0,\n1, or 2 rotational levels, so their absence is not possible if the other Sgr BP(N-LMH) glycine lines\nare assigned correctly. Therefore, we conclude that the Sgr BP(N-LMH) spectral lines reported by\nKuan et al. (2003) (column 7, Table 1) are not glycine. Furthermore, the VLA data of Hollis et\nal. (2003) established upper limits for compact glycine sources in Sgr B2(N-LM). Consequently,\nglycine has not been verified in Sgr BZ(N-LMH) either in extended or in compact sources.\nIf the 27 lines reported by Kuan et al. (2003) in Orion KL, W51el/e2, and Sgr BS(N-LMH)\nare not glycine, what are they? Lines 21, 24, and 26 in Table 1 are the 3 lines reported to be\ncommon to all 3 sources. We have argued that vibrationally excited ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2CN)\nis a logical assignment for line 21, and vibrationally excited vinyl cyanide (CH2CHCN) for line\n24. The intensity of line 26 increases as the observational beam width narrows, so it could also\nbe a vibrationally excited transition of a common interstellar species. Seven other lines could be\npartially or completely assigned to be common species listed in Table 5. Beyond this, it is difficult\nto comment on other possible line carrier candidates because Kuan et al. (2003) only published\nsample spectra for 11 of their 27 lines. Finally, we have demonstrated that rotational temperature\ndiagrams can not by themselves be used to identify interstellar molecules.\n\n- 18 -\n\nWe are indebted to A.

However, this approach\nincorporates several assumptions. First, it is assumed that each region in the interstellar cloud has\nuniform physical conditions and that the populations of the energy levels can be characterized by\na Boltzmann distribution. Second, optically thin conditions are assumed but it may be possible to\ncorrect for this assumption later in the analysis. Third, if it is not possible to measure the source\nsize, it must be assumed the source fills the observational beam. So, if the population distribution\ncan be adaquately described by a single rotational temperature and if all the lines are optically thin,\nthe measured fluxes are proportional to the column densities in the upper levels of the transitions\nbeing observed.\nFor autocorrelation (singleelement telescope) observations, we can start with equation (1) in\n$3. For cross-correlation (interferometric array) observations, we can use (see, for example, Snyder\net a . 2001)\nl\n\n< NT >=\n\n2.04 WI Z eEuITrot\nx lo2\' cm-2\nB8,4,Sp2v3\n\nIn equation (Al), WI = I,dv in Jy beam-\' km s-l, and I is the flux density per beam. Z is the\n,\nrotational partition function, B is the beam filling factor, 8, and Ob are the FWHM synthesized\nbeam dimensions in arcsec, S is the linestrength, p2 the square of the dipole moment in Debye2,\nand v is the frequency in GHz. The beam-averaged upper level column density, < Nu >, is defined\nb\nY\n\n<Nu>\n\n--\n\n9u\n\n<NT>\n\n- -e\n\nz\n\n-%\n\nTrot,\n\nwhere g, is the statistical weight of the upper level (2J+1). A standard approach is to take the\nNaperian (base e) logarithm of equation (A2),\n\n-\n\n19 -\n\nThen for cross-correlation data, equations (Al) and (A3) give\n\nA linear least-squares fit to equation (A4) can be used to construct a rotational temperature diagram\nwhere the slope gives the negative reciprocal of the rotational temperature. T i temperature can\nhs\nbe used to estimate the total molecular column density < NT >. The rotational temperature\nwill be equal to the kinetic temperature only at sufficiently high densities. If the emission is not\noptically thin, the finite opacity produces an underestimate in the upper level column density of\nthe observed transition and it can also produce an error in the rotational temperature (Goldsmith\n& Langer 1999). If the opacity can be calculated, corrections can be made to the rotational\ntemperature and total column density. A similar approach can be followed with equations (1) and\n(A2) to construct a rotational temperature diagram from autocorrelation (single-element telescope)\ndata:\nI()\nn*\n\n= I n ( 1.67 wT1ol4) - -- +In(-).\nTrot\nE~\nBSp2u\n\nThere are two more important caveats about rotational temperature diagrams that must be\nnoted. First, if common (Briggsian) base 10 logarithms are used, the result is\n\nThis approach slightly complicates the rotational temperature term. However, it m k s the data\nae\nscatter appear to be smaller since loglo*\n= 0.434 I , .\nn*\nThe second important caveat is\nin either equations (A4) or equation (A5), the frequency parameter will dominate the integrated\nintensity, line strength, and dipole moment terms for typical spectral line data in the millimeter\nor submillimeter range. Hence, rotational temperature diagrams can not be used as independent\ntools to verify interstellar spectral line identifications. This point is illustrated in 55.\n\n-\n\n20 -\n\nREFERENCES\nBerulis, I. I., Winnewisser, G., Krasnov, V. V., & Sorochenko, R. L. 1985, Sov. Astron.
