Reference uniform Cartesian systems of points are used to achieve highly efficient domain connectivity, and form the basis for a future fully automated system. The Cartesian systems are used to approximate body surfaces and to map the computational space of component grids. By exploiting the characteristics of Cartesian systems, Chimera type hole-cutting and identification of donor elements for intergrid boundary points can be carried out very efficiently. The method is tested for a range of geometrically complex multiple-body overset grid systems. A dynamic hole expansion/contraction algorithm is also implemented to obtain optimum domain connectivity; however, it is tested only for geometry of generic shapes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960001941, "id": "f047c2e4e7894862bac676cec16b946c", "publicationDate": "1995-08-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960001941.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960001941/downloads/19960001941.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960001941/downloads/19960001941.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960001941/downloads/19960001941.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
