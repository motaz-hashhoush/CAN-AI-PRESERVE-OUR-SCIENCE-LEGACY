Many of the principal combustion diagnosticians from industry, academia, and government laboratories were assembled in the Diagnostics/Testing Subsection of this workshop to discuss the requirements and obstacles to the successful implementation of advanced diagnostic techniques to the test environment of the proposed AST combustor. The participants, who represented the major relevant areas of advanced diagnostic methods currently applied to combustion and related fields, first established the anticipated AST combustor flowfield conditions. Critical flow parameters were then examined and prioritized as to their importance to combustor/fuel injector design and manufacture, environmental concerns, and computational interests. Diagnostic techniques were then evaluated in terms of current status, merits and obstacles for each flow parameter. All evaluations are presented in tabular form and recommendations are made on the best-suited diagnostic method to implement for each flow parameter in order of applicability and intrinsic value.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970001580, "id": "faa10a9032f4429db36d6618cbc8d09b", "publicationDate": "1996-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970001580.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970001580/downloads/19970001580.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970001580/downloads/19970001580.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970001580/downloads/19970001580.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
