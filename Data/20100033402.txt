The purpose of this team is two-fold . The first is to identify, use, and develop\nsoftware applications, tools, and design processes that streamline and enhance a\ncollaborative engineering environment.\nThe second is to use this collaborative\nengineering environment to produce conceptual, system-Ievel-of-detail designs in a\nrelatively short turnaround time, using a standing team of systems and integration\nexperts. This includes running rapid trade studies on varying mission architectures, as\nwell as producing vehicle and/or subsystem designs. The standing core team is made up\nof experts from all of the relevant engineering divisions (e.g. Power, Thermal, Structures,\netc.) as well as representatives from Risk and Safety, Mission Operations, and Crew Life\nSciences among others. The Team works together during 2- hour sessions in the same\nspecially enhanced room to ensure real-time integration/identification of crossdisciplinary issues and solutions. All subsystem designs are collectively reviewed and\napproved during these same sessions. In addition there is an Information sub-team that\ncaptures and formats all data and makes it accessible for use by the following day. The\nresult is Team Expo : an Advanced Design Team that is leading the change from a\nphilosophy of "over the fence" design to one of collaborative engineering that pushes the\nenvelope to achieve the next-generation analysis and design environment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n'
