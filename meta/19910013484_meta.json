The same piece of knowledge might serve several uses. Given the quantity and complexity of the knowledge that must be stored, it is critical to maintain the knowledge in one repository, in one form. At the same time, because of quantity and complexity of knowledge that must be used in life cycle applications such as cost estimation, re-design, and diagnosis, it is critical to automate such knowledge uses. For each specific use, a knowledge base must be available and must be in a from that promotes the efficient performance of that knowledge base. However, without a single source knowledge repository, the cost of maintaining consistent knowledge between multiple knowledge bases increases dramatically; as facts and descriptions change, they must be updated in each individual knowledge base. A use-neutral representation of a hydraulic system for the F-111 aircraft was developed. The ability to derive portions of four different knowledge bases is demonstrated from this use-neutral representation: one knowledge base is for re-design of the device using a model-based reasoning problem solver; two knowledge bases, at different levels of abstraction, are for diagnosis using a model-based reasoning solver; and one knowledge base is for diagnosis using an associational reasoning problem solver. It was shown how updates issued against the single source use-neutral knowledge repository can be propagated to the underlying knowledge bases.", "title": "Knowledge repositories for multiple uses", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910013484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Williamson, Keith"}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Computer Services Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "bce1ce76a7814586ae4d1f51e3cc1a4a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910013484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Riddle, Patricia"}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Computer Services Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA, United States"}}, "id": "032e8a05d54d498cadce71335ddeffb2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910013484, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910013484, "id": "0eebcbbc6bb5423eae0fc941aa410d50", "publicationName": "NASA.
