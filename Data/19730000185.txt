But the only method that is currently\npractical on a large scale is through metallic conductors.\nAs evidenced by the "universal" distribution and use\nof electricity, this method has worked well enough in\nthe past. However, expanding demands for power are\nrequiring the development of power sources that are\nnew, and perhaps more "universal" in the literal sense\nof the word. Currently under consideration, for instance,\nare orbiting power stations which would beam power\ndown to the earth from miles out in space. Such a\nsystem would require development of an efficient power\nconverter for transforming electromagnetic radiation to\nuseful electrical power. In addition, such a converter\nin a more advanced form could potentially be used\n\nto convert energy from the largest available power\nsupply, the sun, permitting widespread terrestrial application of solar-electric converters. Such converters for\ncentralized or dispersed use, as on homes, would\ncapitalize on our only inexhaustible nonpolluting energy\nsource, the sun.\nThe solution:\nA proposed device converts incident electromagnetic\nwave energy into electric power through an array of\ninsulated absorber elements responsive to the electric\nfield of impinging electromagnetic radiation. This device\ncould also serve as a solar energy converter that is\npotentially less expensive and fragile than solar cells,\nyet substantially more efficient.\n\nRectifying\nNetwork\n\nAL\nEl\n(T\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nElectromagnetic wave energy converter for vertical,\nhorizontal, or randomly polarized waves\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from-the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nHow it\'s done:\nThe proposed device is shown in the illustration.\nWide band electromagnetic wave energy impinges on the\narray of tapered, metallic or dielectric, absorber elements\nthat are mutually insulated. For maximum energy conversion, each element is several wavelengths long in the\ndirection of propagation and spaced relatively close to\nits neighbors to enhance absorption of the wave. Thus,\nthe converter surface appears microscopically "rough".\nA voltage replica of the electric field variations\nabsorbed by each element pair is derived at its output.\nThese voltage variations are supplied to a rectifier for\nconversion to useful dc power.\nThe device, in principle, may convert wave energy\nfrom the microwave region through visible light and is\nideally suited for solar-to-electric energy conversion.\nIf it is used to absorb plane polarized waves (e.g., a\nlaser beam), the converter elements in the plane of\npolarization are aligned in pairs. For random or cirularly polarized radiation (e.g., from the sun), a twodimensional array would be used as shown.\nBecause the conversion process is based on the wave,\nrather than the quantum properties of radiation, it is\nexpected that conversion efficiencies will be substantially greater than existing solar cells. Further, because\nthe absorption and conversion means. are separate, each\ncan be individually optimized to more nearly match the\nincident electromagnetic power spectrum, thus maximizing conversion efficiency.\n\nB73-10185\t\n\nIt is interesting to observe that morphologically\nsimilar converters exist in nature in insects and mammals,\nbut have not previously been duplicated by man for\nuseful power converters.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nCode 207.1\nGreenbelt, Maryland 20771\nReference: B73-10185\n\nPatent status:\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a patent\napplication has been filed.
