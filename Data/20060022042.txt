b'Industrial Productivity/Manufacturing Technology\n\n100\n\nCost-Cutting Powdered Lubricant\nOriginating Technology/\nNASA Contribution\n\nS\n\ncientists at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center developed a high-temperature, solid lubricant coating\nmaterial that is saving the manufacturing industry\nmillions of dollars. The material came out of 3 decades\nof tribological research, work studying high-temperature\nfriction, lubrication, and the wearing of interacting surfaces that are in relative motion. It was developed as a\nshaft coating deposited by thermal spraying to protect foil\nair bearings used in oil-free turbomachinery, like gas turbines, and is meant to be part of a larger project: an oil-free\naircraft engine capable of operating at high temperatures\nwith increased reliability, lowered weight, reduced maintenance requirements, and increased power.\nThis advanced coating, PS300, is a self-lubricating\nbearing material containing chromium oxide, with additions of a low-temperature start up lubricant (silver) and a\nhigh-temperature lubricant, making it remarkably stable\nat high temperatures, and better suited than previously\navailable materials for high-stress conditions. It improves\nefficiency, lowers friction, reduces emissions, and has\nbeen used by NASA in advanced aeropropulsion engines,\nrefrigeration compressors, turbochargers, and hybrid electrical turbogenerators.\nPS300 is ideal in any application where lowered\nweight and reduced maintenance are desired, and hightemperature uses and heavy operating speeds are expected.\nIt has notable uses for the Space Agency, but it has even\nfurther-reaching potential for the industrial realm.\n\nPartnership\nThe Great Lakes Industrial Technology Center\n(GLITeC), a NASA technology incubator that helps small\nbusiness take advantage of available NASA technologies,\nassisted ADMA Products, Inc., in obtaining a license\nfor PS300.\n\nOil-free bushings coated in PS300 save companies thousands of dollars in repair costs. PS300 is a composite high-temperature,\nlubricating, chrome-oxide-based material that is embedded with compound particles that function as solid lubricants.\n\nADMA, based in Hudson, Ohio, specializes in powder\nmetallurgy products from titanium, zirconium, niobium,\nand other advanced materials and alloys. It had been\nusing PS200 for 8 years already when NASA developed\nthe more advanced PS300. Vladimir Moxson, ADMA\npresident, jumped at this new opportunity. GLITeC\nworked with company management to design a commercialization plan, and ADMA now holds the license\nfor PS300.\n\nThrough GLITeC, NASA continued to support\nADMA with the development and commercial application of PS300. Researchers worked closely to optimize the\nmanufacturing process and maximize yield. The result\nwas that, after the collaboration, ADMA was able to\nincrease yields of the key starting material from 5 percent\nto 45 percent. This improvement reduced the price of the\nPS300 composite, cut delivery times of the product, and\nincreased ADMA\xe2\x80\x99s profits.\n\nIndustrial Productivity/Manufacturing Technology\n\nADMA is now supplying the advanced PS300 at a\nreduced cost to thankful customers, who, in turn, are\nsaving hundreds of thousands of dollars from the use of\nthis space-age product.\n\nProduct Outcome\nPS300 starts as a powder, which ADMA can either\nmanufacture into a customized solution for a customer\xe2\x80\x99s\nspecific needs or apply directly as a coating, via thermal\nspraying techniques or standard powder metal application\nmethods, such as the press and sinter methods. In short,\nADMA can work this material to fit any needs.\nOne of ADMA\xe2\x80\x99s customers, Elliott Turbomachinery\nCompany, of Jeannette, Pennsylvania, has had resounding\nsuccess with PS304, a derivative of PS300 which is used\nfor coating by plasma spraying. Elliott is a designer and\nmanufacturer of air and gas compressors, steam turbines,\npower recovery turbines, and power-generating equipment. The company has heavy, moving machinery, called\nlift rods, that withstand an amazing amount of wear and\noperate in temperatures up to 1,005 \xc2\xb0F.\nADMA provided, through Hohman Plating and\nManufacturing Corporation, of Dayton, Ohio, PS300\npowdered lubricant-coated valve lift rods for Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s steam\nturbine compressors, with noteworthy economic benefits.\nElliott had previously replaced the rods every 2 years,\nbut projects that these new rods will last 8 years. It estimates that this will save at least $3 million in repair costs,\nnot including the additional advantage of not having to\nleave the equipment idle for days upon days during the\nactual repairs.\nADMA has provided another company with this\ndry lubricant and had similarly remarkable cost-saving\neffects. The Lincoln Electric Company, of Cleveland,\nOhio, designs, develops, and manufactures arc welding products, robotic welding systems, and plasma- and\noxygen-cutting equipment. Lincoln had the need to\nreplace a set of bronze bushings that were an integral part of a dryer oven used in a manufacturing line.\n\nThe current bushings were causing system failures,\nwhich led to downtime and frequent, costly repairs.\nADMA produced a set of PS300 bearings to address\nthe problem.\nLincoln found that these bearings showed such high\nreliability that the company decided to retrofit all of\nits sintering furnaces with them. This expenditure, the\ncompany estimates, will save an average of $200,000 per\n\n101\n\nfurnace per year, over an estimated lifespan of 10 to 20\nyears. Like Elliot, Lincoln is finding additional economic\nreturn, since the furnaces do not have to be shut down\nas often for maintenance and repairs. It refurbished a\nnumber of its furnaces and even its subsidiaries abroad are\nworking to replace their bronze bushings with the spaceage material. \xe2\x9d\x96\n\nThis red-hot machine\n(pictured here with\nthe door open) tests\nthe PS300 bearing\nmaterials under very\nhigh temperatures.\n\n'
