b'GREEN MONO PROPULSION\nACTIVITIES AT MSFC\nJoel W. Robinson\njoel.w.robinson@nasa.gov\nNational Aeronautics & Space Administration\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nUnited States of America\nABSTRACT\nIn 2012, the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) began the process of building an integrated technology roadmap, including both technology pull and technology push strategies. Technology Area 1 (TA-01) for Launch Propulsion Systems and\nTA-02 In-Space Propulsion are two of the fourteen TAs that provide recommendations for the overall\ntechnology investment strategy and prioritization of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s space technology activities. Identified within these documents are future needs of green propellant use. Green ionic liquid monopropellants and\npropulsion systems are beginning to be demonstrated in space flight environments. Starting in 2010 with\nthe flight of Prisma, a 1-N thruster system began on-orbit demonstrations operating on ammonium dinitramide based propellant. The NASA Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM) plans to demonstrate\nboth 1-N, and 22-N hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN)-based thrusters in a 2015 flight demonstration.\nIn addition, engineers at MSFC have been evaluating green propellant alternatives for both thrusters and\nauxiliary power units (APUs). This paper summarizes the status of these development/demonstration activities and investigates the potential for evolution of green propellants from small spacecraft and satellites to larger spacecraft systems, human exploration, and launch system auxiliary propulsion\napplications.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMSFC has a history of taking propulsion systems from mid-level technology readiness levels\n(TRL) to flight systems as shown by Figure 1.\nOf recent interest to the Agency is the development of green propulsion. Between 2004\xe2\x80\x932009,\nMSFC was instrumental in liquid oxygen/liquid\nmethane cryogenic green propulsion components, subsystems and systems.3,4 Following this\nactivity, focus moved into green mono propulsion applications to complement and perhaps\nreplace hydrazine use.\nHydrazine has an extensive >50-year history and\nis commonly used for reaction control system\n(RCS) thrusters, apogee thrusters and APUs.\nHowever, the propellant is toxic and requires\nhazardous operations procedures. Efforts in\nSweden and in the United States with the Air\nForce Research Laboratory (AFRL) have shown\nprogress in the development of green monopropellant alternatives to hydrazine.\nAssessing the green propellant applications and\ntechnology needs, MSFC has defined five different categories of pursuit: small thrusters (<1\n\nN), mid-sized thrusters (~22 N), large thrusters\n(~440 N), APUs, and advanced pressurization.\nThese categories are further explored in terms of\nthe space applications and will be discussed further. There is a separate paper during the Space\nPropulsion 2014 conference that is focused on\nAPU.5\nMSFC views the upper end of thrust class to be\n100 lbf (440 N) for hydrazine replacement and\n200 lbf (880 N) for bi-propellant replacement.\nThe Swedes are introducing a 200-N (~50-lbf)\nthruster soon for flight. Growth above this level\nwould enable competition with both existing\n100-lbf hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide\n(NTO)/monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) bipropellant 100-lbf thrusters. There have been\nover 320 engines built in the 50-lbf thrust class\nand another 50+ in the 100-lbf class with hydrazine. Although the Viking and Curiosity landers\nto Mars flew 700-lbf (3114-N) thrusters, that\nthrust application is extremely limited in use.\nThere are diminishing returns from a propulsion\nsystem trade perspective to go above 100 lbf due\nto NTO/MMH performance. However, there\nhave been over 800 R-4D thrusters built and an-\n\nFigure 1. MSFC has a long history with in-space propulsion, from Saturn V to current work on\nOrion and SLS.\n\nother 70+ Leros engines in the 100-lbf class.\nThere is an ample market for potential replacement of thrusters across a variety of spacecraft\napplications.\nNanosatellites, CubeSats, and small satellites are\nbeginning to show interest in use of green mono\npropulsion thrusters up to 1-N class. General\nspacecraft (<500 kg) lean more toward the 22-N\nto 50-N class for apogee engines and lower\nthrust classes for RCS applications. Larger\nspacecraft (>500 kg) and robotic exploration vehicles will be the upper end of thrust class (440\nN). Lastly, human exploration and launch systems would be interested in 440-N class thrusters from a human-rated spacecraft RCS and roll\ncontrol for launch vehicles.\nMSFC review of potential green propellants is\ncentered on 4 different options. First is the Swedish-developed ammonium dinitramide (ADN)based propellant known as LMP-103S. Second\nis the AFRL-developed HAN-based propellant\nknown as AF-M315E. Third is nitrous oxide fuel\nblend experimental (NOFBX) initially developed by Firestar Technologies. Lastly, a 90%\nconcentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is\nregaining consideration. The remainder of this\npaper will focus on MSFC efforts in these areas.\n\nEXISTING EFFORTS\nThe Prisma satellite is a project lead by the\nSwedish Space Corporation that consists of two\nsatellites (Mango and Tango) that fly in formation with a mother satellite. It was launched\nalong with the PICARD spacecraft on June 15,\n2010, on a Dnepr-1 in Russia. While the primary\nobjective is to test autonomous formation flying,\nthe mother spacecraft also carried 1-N hydrazine\nand LMP-103S thrusters to show an \xe2\x80\x9capples-toapples\xe2\x80\x9d comparison between the different propellants.\nECAPS, a subsidiary of the Swedish Space Corporation, has continued to expand the thrust\nclasses available with LMP-103S. They are now\nproviding multiple units to Skybox imaging constellation of cube satellites and are scheduled to\nfly a 200-N thruster soon on an ESA mission.\n\nhands-on experience. With emphasis being\nplaced on CubeSats, MSFC is investigating use\nof the 1-N thruster with smaller attitude control\nthrusters for implementation into a 3U-sized\nspacecraft. Further design evolutions will look at\nsub-1U if possible.\nMSFC has also procured a 22-N LMP-103S\nthruster for further checkout testing at the CDA.\nThe author participated in the acceptance testing\nof the thruster in Grindsjon, Sweden, in March\n2014. The hardware is scheduled to be shipped\nsoon and will be integrated into the CDA following the 1-N thruster testing currently planned.\n\nFigure 2. ATK/ECAPS 22-N thruster.\n\nAFRL, with the assistance of Aerojet, have recently conducted ground demonstrations for 1-N\nand 22-N AF-M315E thrusters. In 2015, Ball\nAerospace Corporation will be flying a small\nsatellite that uses these thrusters to demonstrate\non-orbit operations.\nIn March 2011, the team of Innovative Space\nPropulsion Systems and Firestar were selected to\ndevelop and perform a NOFBX flight experiment at the International Space Station (ISS) in\nlate 2012. Due to a variety of factors, the ISS\nProgram Control Board de-manifested the experiment from upcoming missions and awaits further test data before putting it back on the\nmanifest.\nMSFC IN-HOUSE EFFORTS\nCurrent activities at MSFC span from thruster to\npower generation to pressurization applications.\nMSFC has procured a 1-N AF-M315E thruster\nfrom a vendor located in Huntsville. The testing\nto be conducted at the MSFC Component Development Area (CDA) will include characterization testing and allows for support staff (tech(technical, programmatic, and safety) to get\n\nFigure 3. Test stand installation at CDA.\n\nConsideration has also been given to tri-gas (or\ntridyne) thruster maturation. MSFC has spent\nover 4 years evolving the catalyst material and\nthe subsequent thruster testing. Evaluation is also underway to consider tridyne as a propellant\ntank pressurant. Other warm gas alternatives,\nlike high-purity hydrogen peroxide and nitrous\noxide, are also being reevaluated for use as a\nspacecraft pressurant. Some amount of lowdollar MSFC independent research and development (IRAD) funds are being provided to address pressurization.\nMSFC also works with academia to examine\ntechnical issues that face green propulsion advancement into the mainstream. MSFC is mentoring a post-graduate intern from Utah State\nUniversity who is investigating ionic liquid igniter development. Likewise, MSFC is heavily\nengaged with small businesses that are investigating other ignition and catalyst enhancement\nwork.\n\nFigure 4. MSFC Green Propulsion Roadmap.\n\nLastly, MSFC has dedicated some IRAD dollars\nto invest in green propulsion for use in power\ngeneration systems. Shuttle heritage gas generators and auxiliary power units have been retrieved and stand ready for technology\ndevelopment activities. Surrogate hardware has\nbeen located to assess feasibility of green propellants with the existing Shell 405 catalyst, currently used for hydrazine systems, to determine\nreactivity and limitations of use.\nMSFC GREEN PROPULSION ROADMAP\nIn the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2014, MSFC began to develop a green propulsion roadmap. This\nconference is our first opportunity to roll out\nwhat MSFC views as the important next steps to\ntake and will be excited to coordinate international support to meet mutual goals. As was described in Section 4 on in-house efforts, the\nmajority of these efforts can be viewed as pilot\nprojects to obtain empirical data that can lead to\nmore detailed models to understand the catalysis, ignition and other performance and life issues.\n\nThe development of the MSFC roadmap focused\non the many questions yet to be answered or assumptions that lack confirmation. Examples include evaluating propellant formulation for\nmaximizing purity for spacecraft RCS propellant\nstability versus relaxation of purity for apogee\nusage (early mission use compared to prolonged\nsystem use) and evaluation of system cost implications. What are the decomposition temperature\nand stability of these different blends, especially\nconsidering the use in APU systems with lower\ntemperature limits for existing systems and\ncomponents?\nAdditional questions include: Are existing propellant tank bladder materials adequate for green\npropellants? Are there ways to minimize (or\neliminate) pre-heat requirements on catalyst\nbeds? What causes catalyst wash-outs with green\npropellants and can it be prevented? How can\ncatalyst life be extended and can we address\nfailure mechanisms and design to reduce or\neliminate them?\nFor consideration into applications for humanrated missions, extensive testing would be required for A/B ratings of materials. Are there\n\nalternative ignition options to catalytic? Lastly,\nwhat is the system robustness against deep thermal cycles and gradients? There appears to be a\nlack of demonstrations involving precipitating\nand re-dissolving the salts in green propellants.\n\noperational timeline (including soak back).\nEventually, model growth will include space\norientation (thruster facing the sun) and pulse\noperation. This will aid future mission design in\navoiding any potential thermal issues.\n\nMSFC envisions future efforts to concentrate in\nthese areas that can be summarized into three\ncategories: material compatibility, life, and\nscalability. Most notably, there have been concerns on previous testing of M&P characteristics\nby various DoD and industry counterparts.\nMSFC aims to re-evaluate and re-perform some\nof these tests to help mitigate the disagreements.\nWe believe we can make a broad infusion of\ntechnology advancements to the industry base,\nto the DoD personnel, and to our international\npartners.\nFigure 5. Pulsed thruster valve.\n\nExamples of the work MSFC plans to perform to\ncombat the issues identified in our roadmap include materials compatibilities, propellant properties, suitable propellant tank bladder materials,\nmechanical impact, friction, spark ignition, and\nthermal stability testing. MSFC would maintain\nthis data in our Materials and Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS) database,\nwhich has been used by multiple program and\nprojects including the International Space Station. The goal of MAPTIS is to provide a singlepoint source for materials properties for NASA\nand NASA-associated contractors and organizations. MAPTIS contains physical, mechanical,\nand environmental properties for metallic and\nnon-metallic materials.\n\nMSFC has also made improvements in advanced\nmanufacturing (AM) by producing propulsion\ncomponents eventually leading to integration\ninto system level assemblies. The use of AM\nwould enhance green propulsion with reduced\nmanufacturing costs, especially for quick turnaround hardware investigations. Lead times are\ncut an order of magnitude with repeatable manufacturing and the ability to construct complex\nflow passages. Current MSFC priorities are focused on propellant management devices, chamber/nozzles, and integrated system hardware.\nThis could also be coupled with other entities\nperforming similar work.\n\nMSFC will pursue an empirical approach in a\nlaboratory setting to evaluate reacting flows.\nCatalyst bed geometry is irregular and heterogeneous catalysis may require some simplifying\nassumptions. This effort would evolve into a\ncomputational fluid dynamics-based calibrated\nmodel for the catalyst bed flow eventually able\nto simulate with physical calculations. Recent\nadvancements in modeling surface reactions of\nsolid rocket motor ignition would be the starting\npoint for our activities.\n\nWith the goal of fostering collaboration with industry and/or international entities, MSFC could\ntest existing green propellant assets through\nSpace Act Agreements or Technical Assistance\nAgreements. Given limited vacuum test capability at MSFC, we could still place the injector\nsystem (head-end) into vacuum conditions to\nsimulate space-like environmental conditions or\nteam with other NASA Centers or international\npartners for larger facilities. However, the\ngrowth to 440-N thrust levels may require a\ndeeper\nbudget\ncommitment\nfrom\nNASA/international development efforts.\n\nCurrent valves are solenoid, but larger thrusters\nwill need variable position valves. MSFC will\nreview current green propellant formulations and\nopportunities to evolve them. Initial thermal\nmodeling will build simplified geometry/mesh\nand apply boundary conditions for a specified\n\nLooking at the last 5 years of NASA Science\nMission Directorate missions, the majority have\nrequired hydrazine propulsion for either apogee\nand/or RCS functions in the thrust class of 440\nN (100 lbf) or less. Beyond the use of green prop\n\nthrusters in these applications, there are recurring missions that could aid future infusion. For\ninstance, the NASA Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite (GOES) and Landsat\nspacecraft are prime examples of future constellations along with the transformation of existing\nbuses provided by industry.\nIn the coming years, there could be the opportunity to transform the NASA Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Mission Directorate\nby increasing the number of green propulsion\napplications. Besides the opportunity to replace\nhydrazine-fueled APUs for SLS booster nozzle\ngimballing, there is potential for replacing roll\ncontrol thrusters for launch vehicles, RCS for the\nOrion crew and service module, apogee/RCS on\ncommercial cargo/crew spacecraft (SpaceX\nDragon and OSC Cygnus) as well as the ISS resupply vessels HTV and ATV.\nCONCLUSIONS\nMSFC has a long-standing history of taking\nlower TRL hardware and maturing them into\nflight systems. With the SLS managed at\nMSFC, we aim to infuse green propellant into\nthe launch vehicle. Having ties into both\nHEOMD and SMD, MSFC also aims on replacing hydrazine and lower thrust bi-propellant systems for various applications. MSFC is at the\nhub of space transportation for the Agency and\ninvites international participation where there is\nmutual interest and opportunities to share the\nworkload.\nREFERENCES\n1.
