Exploration is a\ndifficult enterprise replete with risk, and we will occasionally have failures.\nHowever, we learn from our experiences, persevere, and ultimately succeed. We\nare proud that our mission is relevantto our Nation\'s needs. We perform in a\nresponsible manner--with integrity, we honor the trust placed in us by the\nAmerican people\xe2\x80\xa2 We work as a team because we are strong together, and we\nmaintain the excellence that is our trademark.\nIn this context, we have\ndeveloped a Strategic Plan for the Agency which will take a robust American\naerospace program proudly into the next century.\nThis NASA Strategic Plan presents our top-level strategy: it articulates what we\ndo and for whom; it differentiates between ends and means; it states where we\nare going and what we intend to do to get there. When we get there will be\ndependent upon priorities and funding decisions established by the\nAdministration\nand the Congress. This Plan is not a budget document, nor does\nit present priorities for current or future programs. Rather, it establishes a\nframework for shaping our activities and developing a balanced set of priorities\nacross the Agency. Such priorities will then be reflected in the NASA budget.\n\n%\n\nThe NASA Strategic Plan is a living document.\nIt provides far-reaching goals and\nobjectives to create stability for our efforts. However, we recognize that the\nconstantly changing national and international environment requires us to\nrespond\xe2\x80\xa2 The NASA Strategic Plan, therefore, will be updated annually to ensure\nthat it remains a useful guide for the Agency.\nNot only is the Plan a living document, but the process created to develop it is\nalso alive. OverTO00 employees pa_icipated in developing a statement of our\nVision, our Mission, and our Values. Using this statement as a starting point,\nNASA\'s Associate Administrators\nand Center Directors--our Senior Management\nTeam--participated\nin the strategic planning process. Under my leadership, the\nSenior Management Team will continue to be responsible for NASA\'s strategic\nplanning and for the strategic management decisions necessary to turn this Plan\ninto reality.\n\nT.\n\nThis document represents a significant step towards our reinvention of NASA. It\nunderlines our commitment to strategic management, to achieving more\ninnovative and efficient implementation\nof our programs, to focusing on our\ncustomers\' needs, and to institutionalizing\nequal opportunity and workforce\ndiversity\xe2\x80\xa2 ! am committed to working with the men and women of NASA to meet\nour goals and realize our vision.\n\n.\n\ni\n\n/\n-e\n\nAdministrator\n\n_\n\n=\n=\n\n....\n\nNASA STRATEGIC\n\nMay 1994\n\nPLAN\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVision, Mission, and Goals ...............................\nVision .....................................................\nMission ...................................................\nGoals ......................................................\nExtemal Environment .......................................\nAssessment ...........................................\nKey Assumptions ...................................\nConceptual Framework .....................................\nStrategic Enterprises ........................................\nMission to Planet Earth ..........................\nAeronautics ........ _ ..................................\n\n2\n2\n2\n3\n4\n4\n5\n6\n9\n9\n10\n\nHuman Exploration and\nDevelopment of Space ................ 11\nScientific Research ................................\n12\nSpace Technology .................................\n14\nSynergy ..................................................\n15\nStrategic Functions ...........................................\n16\nTransportation\nto Space .........................\n16\nSpace Communications\n.........................\n16\nHuman Resources .................................\n16\nPhysical Resources ...............................\n17\nValues and Operating Principles ......................\n18\nValues ....................................................\n18\nOperating Principles ...............................\n18\nImplementing Strategy ......................................\n22\nSenior Management Team Concurrence .......... 24\n\n2\n\nVISION, MISSION, AND GOALS\n\nVISION\n\nNASA is an investment in America\'s future. As explorers, pioneers, and\ninnovators, we boldly expand frontiers in air and space to inspire and serve\nAmerica and to benefit the quality of life on Earth.\n\nMISSION\n\nIt is NASA\'s\n\nmission to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Explore,\n\nuse, and enable the development\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advance\nSystem,\n\nscientific knowledge and understanding\nof the Earth, the Solar\nand the Universe and use the environment of space for research\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Research, develop, verify, and transfer\nrelated technologies\nIn fulfilling\n\nits mission,\n\nNASA contributes\n\nof space for human enterprise\n\nadvanced\n\nto America\'s\n\naeronautics,\n\nspace, and\n\ngoals in:\n\nEconomic Growth and Security. We conduct aeronautics and space\nresearch and develop technology in partnership with industry, academia,\nand other Federal agencies to keep America capable and competitive.\nPreserving the Environment.\nWe study the Earth as a planet and as a\nsystem to understand global change, enabling the world to address\nenvironmental\nissues.\nEducational Excellence.\nWe involve the educational community in our\nendeavors to inspire America\'s students, create learning opportunities,\nand\nenlighten inquisitive minds.\nPeaceful Exploration and Discovery.\nWe explore the Universe to enrich\nhuman life by stimulating intellectual curiosity, opening new worlds of\nopportunity, and uniting nations of the world in this quest.\n\n1\n\nGOALS\n\nWe will be at the forefront of exploration and science. We will develop and\ntransfer cutting-edge technologies in aeronautics and space. We will establish\npermanent human presence in space.\nAs we pursue our mission, we will enrich our Nation\'s society and economy.\nwill contribute to a better life for this and future generations.\n\na\n\nWe\n\nIn the longer term, it is our goal to undertake bold and noble challenges--exciting\nfuture programs, such as the return of humans to the Moon and human missions\nto Mars, which stir the imagination and fall within our and our international\npartners\' technical and financial grasp.\n\n-\n\n4\n\nEXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\nASSESSMENT\nOver the past few years, the environment in which NASA operates has changed\nsignificantly.\nThe Cold War has ended, but we find ourselves in the midst of\nvigorous global economic competition.\nThere are also increased domestic\ndemands on Federal resources. We have sought to understand the implications\nof these dramatic changes as we have developed our strategy.\nFour areas\ndeserve particular attention: foreign policy and national security concerns,\ndomestic policy priorities, political support, and public support.\nIn the post-Cold War era, the foreign policy aspect of the civil space program will\nfocus on a spirit of expanded cooperation with our traditional international\npartners and the forging of new partnerships.\nWe have been asked to play a\nmajor role in international ventures with Russia and the other former Soviet\nrepublics, in order to expand space exploration opportunities and also to promote\nthe peaceful uses of technology.\nThere are also increased opportunities for\ncooperation with developing countries. These new relationships,\nalong with\nstrengthened\nties to our traditional partners in Europe, Japan, and Canada, can\nhelp reinforce the economic and technological\nbonds in the new global society.\nDomestic policy priorities are being adjusted in light of large Federal deficits,\nconstrained budgets, and widespread concern over America\'s vitality and\ncompetitiveness.\nThe Administration\nhas placed a high priority on supporting and\npromoting high technology for economic growth. With increased emphasis on\npressing domestic needs, we will be required to ensure the relevance of our\nprograms to national technology priorities and also to other domestic goals in\nareas such as the environment,\nhealth, education, aviation, and fundamental\nscience.\nThe support of America\'s political leadership is vital to our success. The\nPresident has demonstrated\nhis support for NASA and has indicated that we will\nplay a significant role in the Administration\'s\nforeign policy initiatives and its\nscience and technology agenda, in the Congress, NASA continues to enjoy\nbipartisan support, but the margin of support is not as strong as it once was.\nContinued political support will depend on our ability to play a role in addressing\nbroad national needs and to deliver on our promises.\nPublic support for NASA\'s programs has been positive and generally stable\nthroughout our history. Recent public opinion polls continue to show support for\nU.S. endeavors in space. However, in polls which prioritize national programs,\nspace often does not fare as well as it has in years past. Continued public\nsupport will depend on our ability to satisfy the Nation\'s needs and to keep the\npublic fully informed about our activities and about their relevance.\n\n5\nKEY\n\nASSUMPTIONS\n\nIn developing this Strategic Plan, we have made certain assumptions about\ncritical factors in our external environment.\nSignificant changes in the external\nenvironment could force abrupt changes in our ability to implement this Plan.\nOur annual review of the NASA Strategic Plan will include an assessment of the\nexternal environment and a revalidation of our key assumptions.\nThis Plan is\nbased on the following key assumptions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA\'s budget will remain flat or decline,\nforeseeable future, except for allowances\n\nin real terms, for the\nfor new Presidential initiatives.\n\nUnderstanding\nthe environment and global change will continue to be an\nimportant issue requiring NASA\'s involvement in space observations and\nresearch.\nNASA will continue to have a leading role in developing aeronautics\ntechnology jointly with industry and will continue to support the safety\nand efficiency of the national air transportation\nsystem.\nThe International Space Station will be successfully developed,\ndeployed, operated, and used as a research platform through an\ninternational partnership involving the United States, Europe, Japan,\nCanada, and Russia.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Space Shuttle will be kept operational\nuntil a new launch system is developed.\nSpace science will continue\nof basic scientific research.\n\nto support\n\nto be an integral\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA\'s space technology will continue\nenhancing U.S. competitiveness.\n\nNASA missions\n\npart of the national\n\nto be valuable\n\nprogram\n\nto industry\n\nin\n\nNASA will be a primary participant in bringing about new capabilities\nlower cost, more reliable access to space to support civil, national\nsecurity, and commercial requirements.\n\nfor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 International commitments will be kept so that NASA will be seen as a\nviable, reliable international partner in all program areas.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There will continue to be a viable U.S. industrial\naeronautics and space activities.\n\nand academic\n\nbase for\n\nNASA will work closely with other Federal agencies to ensure\ncoordinated efforts in areas of space and aeronautics science and\ntechnology.\n\n6\n\nCONCEPTUAL\n\nFRAMEWORK\n\nThe National Aeronauti\xc2\xa2_ _a.nd\nSpace Act of 1958. This Act established NASA\nand laid the foundation for our mission. It directs NASA to conduct space\nactivities devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.\nWe are\nto preserve the leadership of the United States in aeronautics and space science\nand technology, and we are to expand knowledge of the Earth and space. We\nare to conduct human activities in space. We are to encourage the fullest\ncommercial use of space. Furthermore, we are to cooperate with other nations,\nand we are directed to communicate\nthe results of our efforts widely.\nExternal Cu_;tomers, The concept underlying the NASA Strategic Plan is our\ncommitment to satisfying our external customers.\nWe recognize that our\nrequirements cannot be self-generated.\nRather, we must meet our customers\'\nneeds and deal with changes in their needs over time. Our performance in\ncarrying out programs, i.e., our success as an agency, must be judged by our\ncustomers, not by ourselves.\nAs a Government agency, we see the following groups as our external customers\nand stakeholders:\nthe Administration\nand Congress which provide us the\nfinancial resources and policy direction to conduct our programs; the science and\neducation communities,\naerospace and non-aerospace\nindustries, Federal\nagencies, and other primary customers who receive our products directly and use\nthem for purposes which yield public benefit; and the public which is both our\nultimate resource provider and the ultimate beneficiary of our products. (See\nFigure.) We interact with the Administration,\nthe Congress, and our primary\ncustomers, all of whom shape and influence our programs and products. This\nshaping process ensures that we satisfy them, and thus it ensures that the public\nultimately benefits from its investment in NASA.\nStrategic Enterprises.\nThis NASA Strategic Plan establishes a framework for\nmaking management decisions by separating key Agency activities into the\ndistinctly different categories of extemally focused Strategic Enterprises and\ninternally focused Strategic Functions--ends\nand means. We implement our\nmission and satisfy the needs of our external customers through five Strategic\nEnterprises:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMission to Planet Earth\nAeronautics\nHuman Exploration and Development\nScientific Research\nSpace Technology\n\nof Space\n\nThese Enterprises are the heart of our strategy. They identify at the most\nfundamental level what we do and for whom. They focus us on the ends, not the\nmeans, of our endeavors.\n\nFigure:\n\nNASA Strategic Plan Conceptual\n\nFramework\n\n7\n\n...... !:iii ii!!iiiiiii ! !i!! u.............\nii\n............................. ii iiiii!i!iiiiiii\n....................\ni:iiiiiiiiiii!iiiii\n.....\n\nUltimate\nBeneficiary\n\nI!!i!iiiiii!iii iii iii!ii i;i_i!iiiiiiiiii_ii iiiiiiiiiiii_iliiiii i1\ni\niiii\niliiii_,i iii_i_iiiiiiiii;ii_il;i!iiii!iiiiiii\ni i i i!!i!iiiiii\nPolicy\nMakers\n\nAeronautlcs\nIndustry\n\nPublic\nSector\n\nScience and\nEducation\nCommunities\n\nAerospace and\nNon-Aerospace\nIndustry\n\nScience\nCommunlty\n\nOther U.S.\nGovernment\nAgencies\n\nCommerclal\nSector\n\nTechnology\nInnovators\n\nOther U:S.\nGovernment\nAgencies\n\nPrimary\nCustomers\n\n,:.:,:+:\n\n.:.:.::: :-:_\n\nr\n\n...............\n\n......................... i!i!\ni...................................\n_I_i!!i!!!!iiiiiiii\nI iiiiii_ii_sii:iiiii:iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii _!:!_:!:_,i,i,i,i_i,li_iii_ii_:ii:!!::!:\ni:_i!i_!i!!:!_!!!!!,!!!!!!!!!ii!!ili!!!iii!!_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransportation\nto Space\nFunction\n\n:_:i:i_::_:_!iiiii:i_ii!iiiiiill !!_!!:!:ili:i!_:i:_:_:\':_:_iiii!i{iiiiiiiili,\n!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiill\n:::!!::i::ii!i!iii_i!i!!_!:iiiii_!i!!!!!!!!\n\n....... ,.......... . !_\':2....................... !\n__\n...... ;......................\n\'\'_ , ......

The interleaving of these Enterprise priorities-the development\nof a balanced set of Agency priorities--will lay the groundwork\nfor the budget process.)\nStrategic Functions.\nNASA\'s Strategic Functions provide capabilities required\nthe Strategic Enterprises to meet their external customers\' needs. Our four\nStrategic Functions are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nby\n\nTransportation\nto Space\nSpace Communications\nHuman Resources\nPhysical Resources\n\nThese are Agency-level activities consolidated to serve multiple Enterprises and\nmaximize efficiencies in service delivery. These activities differ from the\nEnterprises in that their customers are primarily internal, not external. Unlike\nother Agency activities with internal customers, however, the strategies of the\nStrategic Functions are significantly driven by the Enterprise strategies.\n\n9\n\nSTRATEGIC\nTHE MISSION\n\nENTERPRISES\n\nTO PLANET EARTH ENTERPRISE\n\nNASA\'s Mission to Planet Earth is dedicated to understanding the total Earth\nsystem and the effects of humans on the global environment.\nThe Mission to\nPlanet Earth Enterprise is pioneering the study of Global Change; many of the\ncapabilities presently being developed will be needed indefinitely, and today\'s\nprogram is laying the foundation for long-term environment and climate\nmonitoring and prediction.\nTo preserve and improve the Earth\'s environment for future generations,\ngovernments\naround the world need policies based upon the strongest possible\nscientific understanding.\nThe unique vantage point of space provides information\nabout the Earth\'s land, atmosphere, ice, oceans, and biota that is obtainable in\nno other way. In concert with the global research community, the Mission to\nPlanet Earth Enterprise is developing the understanding\nneeded to support the\ncomplex environmental\npolicy decisions that lie ahead.\nThe purposes\n\nof the Mission to Planet Earth Enterprise\n\nare to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Increase understanding of the Earth as an integrated system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Observe and characterize the entire Earth system using satellites,\naircraft, and associated research systems\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Characterize and understand natural and human-induced\nchange on\nglobal and regional scales with an initial emphasis on climate change\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Help identify and predict the consequences\nof these changes for human\nhealth and welfare\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contribute to the creation of wise and timely environmental\npolicy\nTo accomplish these purposes,\nemploy the following strategy:\n\nthe Mission\n\nto Planet Earth Enterprise\n\nwill\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPromote extensive international collaboration\nCooperate with other Federal agencies\nContribute to national and international assessments of the environment\nStrengthen environmental\neducation and public awareness\nMake data, information, and understanding\nwidely available through the\nNational Information Infrastructure\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Seek or develop advanced technologies that lead to new science\ninvestigations\nor reduce program cost\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transfer relevant technologies to industry in order to strengthen\nAmerican economic competitiveness\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of Mission to Planet Earth are the present and future\ngenerations of the people on Earth. The primary customers of Mission to Planet\nEarth are those who use environmental information to make decisions, especially\nnational policy makers in the Administration and Congress and their international\n\n10\n\ncounterparts.\nThe world science community also uses Mission to Planet Earth\ndata and information--to\nproduce assessments,\nforecasts, and analysis and to\ndevelop new understanding.\nTHE\n\nAERONAUTICS\n\nENTERPRISE\n\nFor over 75 years, NASA and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee\nfor Aeronautics,\nhave worked closely with U.S. industry, universities, and other\nFederal agencies to give the United States a preeminent position in aeronautics.\nAeronautics\nplays a vital role in the economic health and national security of the\nNation, helping to generate almost one million high-quality jobs, over $40 billion\nin annual exports, and almost $30 billion in positive balance of trade. The U.S\nleadership position, however, is being challenged by aggressive international\ncompetition.\nFuture U.S. competitiveness\nin aeronautics, as well as the\ncontinued safety and productivity of the Nation\'s air transportation\nsystem, is\ndependent upon sustained NASA advances in aeronautics research and\ntechnology.\nNASA\'s Aeronautics\nEnterprise will pioneer the identification, development,\nverification, transfer, application, and commercialization\nof high-payoff\naeronautics technologies.\nIt seeks to promote economic growth and security and\nto enhance U.S. competitiveness\nthrough safe, superior, and environmentally\ncompatible U.S. civil and military aircraft and through a safe, efficient national\naviation system. The Enterprise will work closely with its aeronautics customers,\nincluding U.S. industry, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation\nAdministration,\nto ensure that its technology products and services add value, are\ntimely, and have been developed to the level where the customer can confidently\nmake decisions regarding the application of those technologies.\nThe purposes\n\nof the Aeronautics\n\nEnterprise are to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop high-payoff technologies for a new generation of\nenvironmentally\ncompatible, economic subsonic aircraft and a safe,\nhighly productive global air transportation system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop the technology base for an economically viable and\nenvironmentally\ncompatible high-speed civil transport\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop the technology options for new capabilities in high-performance\naircraft\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop and demonstrate hypersonic technologies for air-breathing,\nsingle-stage-to-orbit\nflight\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop advanced concepts, understanding of physical phenomena,\nand\ntheoretical, experimental, and computational\ntools--including\nHigh\nPerformance Computing and Communications\ntechnologies--for\nadvanced aerospace systems\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop, maintain, and operate critical national facilities for aeronautical\nresearch and for support of its customers and other NASA programs\nIn implementing these purposes, the Aeronautics Enterprise will employ a\nstrategy that emphasizes customer involvement in the planning and conduct of its\n\n11\n\nprograms, reengineers the internal operations of NASA\'s research centers to\nensure maximum cost-effectiveness,\nand increases its emphasis on technology\ntransfer to both aerospace and non-aerospace\ncustomers.\n\nTHE HUMAN EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\nENTERPRISE\n\nOF SPACE\n\nHuman space flight provides direct and tangible benefits in science, technology,\nmedicine, education, and commerce.\nIt also provides important intangible\nbenefits:\nit expands knowledge, experience, and perspective; it inspires and\ngives hope; it promotes international cooperation and peace. Human space flight\nserves as a foundation for much that NASA does.\nThe Human Exploration and Development of Space Enterprise seeks to bring the\nfrontier of space fully within the sphere of human activity for the benefit of\nAmerica and all humankind in this and future generations.\nIt will open the space\nfrontier by exploring, using, and enabling the development of space. In exploring\nspace, its aim is to learn how to travel to a destination and to characterize\nand\nmap it. In using space, its aim is to learn how to live and work there, to take\nadvantage of its unique environment to conduct research and generate\ntechnology, and to make use of its resources.\nIn using space, the Enterprise\nprovides significant opportunity for the other Strategic Enterprises to pursue their\npurposes.\nIn enabling the development of space, the Enterprise seeks to serve\nas a catalyst to commerce ultimately to bring space fully within the sphere of\nhuman activity. With the commercial sector, it will identify and assess\nopportunities and will remove barriers and create incentives.\nIn all that it does,\nthe Enterprise embodies the evolutionary progression of human presence\nbeyond Earth.\nNASA\'s first steps in the human exploration and development of space (Mercury,\nGemini) involved developing the basic capability to get humans into space,\ndemonstrating\nthat they could survive, and beginning to get an understanding\nof\nhow humans could function and operate in this new environment.\nThe next step\n(Apollo) extended human presence beyond Earth orbit and, in so doing,\npioneered the human exploration of another world. These programs yielded new\ninsight into what humans could do in space and how space could be used for\nboth research and operations.\nThey were undertaken to meet an international\npolitical challenge; the primary external customer was the public sector. Further\nprogress, however, demanded a means for regular human access to space. The\ndevelopment\nof the Space Shuttle provided not only regular access to space, but\nalso dramatically expanded capabilities for research (particularly in the life and\nmicrogravity\nsciences) and provided new means for satellite servicing and repair\nand for space construction and operations.\nThe discoveries of Space Shuttle flights have set the stage for the development\nof the International Space Station. The availability of a long-duration laboratory\nwill, in turn, allow investigations\nof the limits of human performance, vastly\nexpand human experience in living and working in space, and provide the\ncapability to understand whether there are additional opportunities for the large-\n\n12\nscale commercial development of space. The experience and results obtained\nfrom use of the Intemational Space Station will guide the future direction of the\nEnterprise.\nInformation obtained from robotic missions to the Moon, near-Earth\nasteroids, and Mars will also play a crucial role in arriving at such a decision.\nPossibilities include the development and use of space resources, the\nestablishment\nof a long-term human presence on the Moon, and the initiation of\nhuman exploration of Mars.\nIn the long term, the purposes of the Enterprise are to enable routine operating\ncapability within the inner solar system, to explore this space regularly, and to\nenable the eventual establishment\nof permanent, self-sufficient\nsettlements in\nspace. In the near term, the Human Exploration and Development\nof Space\nEnterprise will employ the following strategy:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conduct missions and undertake programs that support the long-term\npurposes of the Enterprise\n--Provide safe, reliable, cost-effective\naccess to orbit with the Space\nShuttle; continue to reduce its cost and increase its reliability\n--Develop, maintain, and enhance the capability for humans to live\nand work continuously\nin space; fully utilize the Space Shuttle, the\nInternational Space Station, and other assets as an integrated\nresource\n--Explore the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and Mars; use Scientific\nResearch Enterprise robotic reconnaissance missions to pursue\nEnterprise purposes\n--Support commercial ventures that use the environment and/or\nresources of space; with the Space Technology Enterprise,\nenable access to low-Earth orbit at levels of cost and risk that will\nfurther enable commercial development of space\n--Conduct activities, with the other Enterprises where appropriate,\nto prepare for, shape, and enable future directions of the\nEnterprise\n--Cooperate with other nations to share the benefits and costs of\nexploring and using space\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Contribute to the national community; shape activities to return near-term\ndirect benefits in science, technology, medicine, education, and\ncommerce; communicate these benefits\nIn so doing, the Enterprise will preserve\nexplore and use space.\n\nTHE SCIENTIFIC\n\nfor future generations\n\nRESEARCH\n\nthe capability to\n\nENTERPRISE\n\nNASA contributes to the creation of new scientific knowledge by exploring the\nSolar System and the Universe beyond and by studying the space environment\nand its effects on biological and physical processes.\nIt does so to better\nunderstand who we are, how we got here, and where we are going. The\nScientific Research Enterprise maintains scientific leadership, excites and\ninspires our society, strengthens education and scientific literacy, develops and\n\n13\ntransfers technologies to promote U.S. competitiveness, fosters intemational\ncooperation to enhance programs and share their benefits, and sets the stage for\nfuture space ventures.\nThe purpose of the Scientific Research Enterprise is to seek answers to\nfundamental questions, such as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the origin of the Universe? What is the nature of the Big Bang\nand quasars? What is the origin of the Sun, the Solar System, and life?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How has the Universe evolved since the Big Bang? How has the Solar\nSystem evolved?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the ultimate fate of the Universe? Do dark matter and black\nholes play a crucial role?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Is the Solar System unique? Is the Earth unique in the Universe? Are\nthere planets around other stars?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How are conditions for life on Earth maintained? How does the solar\noutput vary? How does the Earth\'s magnetic field trap radiation and\nprotect the planet?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Did life ever arise on Mars or elsewhere in our Solar System? Is there\nlife or are there even civilizations around other stars?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can humans live and work in space? What are the physiological,\npsychological, and biological requirements for humans to explore space?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How do the biological and physical worlds work? Are the laws of physics\nthe same everywhere in the Universe? Do the laws of physics remain\nthe same at all times? What secrets of nature does weightlessness\nreveal?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What knowledge from space can improve the quality of life on Earth?\nThe Scientific Research Enterprise seeks these answers using space-based\ntelescopes to observe the Universe; space probes, orbiters, and landers to\nexplore the planets; Earth-orbiting satellites and deep space missions to study\nthe Sun and its influence on the Earth; and scientists in space laboratories to\nexamine how gravity and radiation affect human physiology and other biological\nand physical systems.\nThe Scientific Research Enterprise will accomplish\n\nits purposes by employing a\nstrategy that dramatically lowers mission costs while preserving, to the greatest\nextent possible, mission performance.\nTo do so, it will accept prudent risk,\nshorten development times, explore new conceptual approaches, streamline\nmanagement,\nand make other changes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.\nThese steps will strengthen the ability of the Enterprise to conduct smaller\nmissions more frequently, thus providing a continuous stream of scientific data.\nThe public is both an investor in this research and the ultimate customer and\nbeneficiary.\nIn conducting scientific research, NASA serves the needs of the\nscientific and educational communities,\nthe media, and industry--all of which play\nvital roles in bringing the benefits of its scientific research to the public. To\nenhance return to the public, the Scientific Research Enterprise will take care to\nclearly communicate\nits results and their excitement to the public, build\n\n14\neducational opportunities into scientific programs, encourage participating\nscientists to support national educational goals, and choose mission/program\ndesigns that maximize the development and dissemination of new technology\nrelevant to broader national needs.\nTHE\n\nSPACE\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nENTERPRISE\n\nTechnological\nadvances and their applications have been the engine behind U.S.\nproductivity growth since World War II. This growth depends not only on the\ncommercial use of existing technologies,\nbut also on a supply of new\ntechnologies\nmade readily available to industry and to the U.S. Govemment.\nThrough advanced technology development and transfer, the Space Technology\nEnterprise contributes significantly to the international competitiveness\nof U.S.\nindustries.\nThese contributions\nstimulate the economy by developing dual-use\nproducts and processes and by providing high-skill, high-wage American jobs.\nThe purposes\n\nof the Space Technology\n\nEnterprise\n\nare to:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Proactively transfer technology to aerospace and non-aerospace\nindustries in order to enhance U.S. competitiveness\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop new and innovative space technologies to improve the\nperformance and lower the cost of future space missions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop technology to revitalize access to space\nTo achieve these purposes,\nfollowing strategy:\n\nthe Space Technology\n\nEnterprise\n\nwill employ the\n\nThe Enterprise will work on jointly funded partnerships with commercial entities\nhaving a direct interest in utilizing NASA expertise, technologies,\nfacilities, or\nservices.\nRecognizing the timeliness requirements of the commercial world, the\nEnterprise will rapidly complete agreements and licensing arrangements\nto\nstimulate the development and commercialization\nof focused technology.\nThus\nthe Enterprise will help to enhance the vitality of established space industries and\nnurture emerging and potential space industries.\nThe Enterprise will assist NASA will in ensuring the transfer of its technology to\nthe commercial sector to promote U.S. industrial competitiveness.\nThe Space\nTechnology\nEnterprise will provide techniques and mechanisms to assist all\nEnterprises in their technology transfer efforts. The Enterprise will also seek and\nfacilitate technology "spin-in" from non-NASA sources.\nThe Enterprise will ensure program relevance and maintain a customer focus by\ninvolving its industry, Federal laboratory, and university customers, along with the\nother Enterprises, in program planning, review, and evaluation.\nThe Enterprise will nurture certain world-class capabilities that are critical to the\ndevelopment of space technologies and the education of future generations.\nFor\ninternal NASA customers, the Enterprise will develop mission-related\nadvanced\nconcepts and develop and verify relevant, cutting-edge technologies for future\n\n15\nspace missions and transportation systems. The development of technology that\nhas dual-use potential will be emphasized. Although the Space Technology\nEnterprise will develop technology for NASA mission applications, the final\nmaturation of specific technologies will usually be the responsibility of the\nrelevant Enterprise.\nA specific focus of this Enterprise will be to develop technology\nlaunch systems which will\nlarge payloads for human\ntechnology development.\nDefense, other appropriate\neconomical, safe, reliable,\ninfrastructure.\nSYNERGY\n\nleading to new\nmeet the future access to space needs of small to\nspace flight, national security, commerce, science, and\nNASA will work in partnership with the Department of\nFederal agencies, and U.S. industry to bring about an\nand operable national space transportation\n\nAMONG\n\nTHE\n\nENTERPRISES\n\nThe Strategic Enterprises comprise an integrated national effort. Synergism of\nbroad purposes, technology requirements, workforce skills, facilities, and many\nother dimensions was the basis for amalgamating these activities in NASA in the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act in 1958, and the benefits remain strong\ntoday.\nIn addition to the examples of synergies noted in the above Enterprise\ndescriptions, the Human Exploration and Development of Space Enterprise\nprovides the Scientific Research and Space Technology Enterprises the means\nto benefit from human presence in the unique environment of space.\nConversely,\nthe Scientific Research and Space Technology Enterprises provide\nthe foundation for the Human Exploration and Development\nof Space Enterprise\nby, among other things, undertaking precursor robotic missions and developing\nneeded knowledge and technology.\nThe Scientific Research Enterprise enriches\nthe Mission to Planet Earth Enterprise with its studies of the Sun, the other\nplanets, and the near-Earth environment for their relevance to our understanding\nof the Earth. The Aeronautics Enterprise and the Human Exploration and\nDevelopment\nof Space Enterprise are mutually supportive in high speed\naerodynamics,\nvehicle control systems, and crew accommodation\nresearch.\nThese are but a few examples of the mutually beneficial interactions among\nNASA\'s Strategic Enterprises.\n\n16\n\nSTRATEGIC\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nTO SPACE\n\nProviding transportation\nto space--getting\nfrom the Earth\'s surface into space and\nback--is a Strategic Function required by the Enterprises.\nThree current avenues\nexist to provide this function: purchase of commercial or Department of Defense\nlaunch services, use of the Space Shuttle, or use of international assets.\nIt is national policy for NASA to use U.S. commercial expendable launch vehicle\nservices to the maximum extent possible. Use of the Space Shuttle is limited to\nthose applications that require its unique capabilities:\ntransport of humans into\nspace; a platform for short-term orbital activities, especially those requiring crew\nparticipation or intervention; and return of large payloads to Earth. Use of\ninternational launch capabilities is considered as a part of joint or cooperative\nmissions.\n\nSPACE\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nLike transportation\nto space, electronic access to space is essential to the\nsuccess of all Agency missions. This vital function is accomplished using a costeffective combination of NASA assets and, where available, commercial, other\nU.S. Government,\nand international assets. Primary NASA assets are the\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite System and the Deep Space Network. The\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite System provides the only existing means of\ncontinuously communicating with orbiting spacecraft at high data rates, a\ncapability required by nearly all Earth-orbiting missions. The Deep Space\nNetwork provides the only communications link with missions in deep space.\nThe key purposes of the Space Communications\nStrategic Function include:\nensuring the continuity of communications\nrelay services by procuring\nreplenishment\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite System spacecraft; facilitating\nthe development\nof cost-effective\nend-to-end communications\narchitectures,\nincluding integrating value-added processing; reducing mission-unique\nsystems\nand engineering through standardization;\nand stimulating commercialization\nso\nthat future needs can be met by the marketplace.\nManagerial and technical\nexcellence will continue to be emphasized, providing integrated solutions to the\noperational communications\nand information management needs common to all\ncustomers.\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES\nNASA must develop policies, systems, and programs to assure that it plans,\nacquires, develops, and retains the human resources required to achieve its\nmission with innovation and excellence.\nThe face of NASA must reflect the face\nof America. Therefore, it is vital that all human resources plans and programs be\nachieved with a view towards expanding the cultural diversity of our workforce.\n\n17\nThe Human Resources Function provides stability for the Agency in an\nenvironment of change and readaptation. Downsizing, in particular, poses\nspecial challenges. The Agency must provide its managers and employees with\nthe tools necessary to ensure full utilization and development of our vital human\nresources.\nTo this end, the Human Resources Function will strive to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ensure that Agency recruitment and retention efforts provide NASA "the\nbest and the brightest," while increasing the participation of women,\nminorities, and individuals with disabilities in the Agency\'s programs and\nactivities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Institutionalize\nrecruitment and career development strategies and plans\nfor every critical NASA skill category\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduce administrative\nprocedures and processes that burden NASA\'s\nhuman resources management\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Manage NASA downsizing by analyzing and formulating appropriate\nratios of civil service/contractor\nworkforce composition for future NASA\nresearch, development, and operational environments\n\nPHYSICAL\nThe Agency\'s Physical\nbusinesslike approach\nfiscal constraints.\nThis\nnecessary real estate,\nperforming world class\n\nRESOURCES\n\nResources Strategic Function is based on an aggressive,\nto extract greater retum recognizing current and projected\napproach must concurrently assure the availability of the\nfacilities, equipment, aircraft, and information resources for\nresearch, development, and operations.\n\nNASA will employ a strategy that maximizes the use of existing infrastructure;\nconsolidates\nlike activities; disposes of unneeded assets; shares use of unique\nfacilities, equipment, and information systems of other organizations where\nfeasible; and develops only those additional assets necessary to support evolving\nprogram and mission requirements.\nApplication of this strategy demands:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recognition that NASA\'s performance depends heavily on the availability\nand accessibility of our unique physical resources\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sufficient maintenance to ensure key physical resources remain capable\nand reliable for govemment and industry use\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Customer orientation built on mutually developed approaches that take\nadvantage of partnerships and shared use of physical resources\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Adequate standards and policies that drive highly cost-effective\ndecisions\nwith minimal resources\n\n18\n\nVALUES\n\nAND OPERATING\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nIn all that we do, we will operate according to our values\nprinciples.\nThey form the bedrock of our efforts.\n\nand our operating\n\nVALUES\nExcellence is key to NASA\'s achievements.\nstrive to uphold these values:\n\nAs individuals\n\nand as a team, we\n\nOur greatest strength is our workforce.\nWe aggressively recruit a team of\nhighly qualified individuals from America\'s diverse cultures. We empower\nour employees, encouraging and rewarding creativity, initiative, and\nteamwork.\nWe provide training and valuable hands-on experience to\ndevelop our premier workforce.\nWe enable the highest employee\nproductivity through innovative practices that respond to employees\'\nabilities and needs.

We are bold but prudent in confronting challenges and accepting\nrisks. We work with integrity and are dedicated to fulfilling our vision.\n\nOPERATING\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nOur operating principles are pervasive. They will be reflected in the strategic\nplans of the operating organizations comprising the Agency and also in the\nindividual performance plans of NASA\'s managers and employees.\nThe entire\nAgency will be held accountable for embodying the following operating principles\n(listed alphabetically)\nin the way it does business:\nBudget and Financial Management.\nWe will be guided in budget development,\njustification, and execution by openness, candor, and critical self-analysis.\nWe\nwill relate our estimates of resource requirements to specific performance\nmeasures, and use the outcome to determine the value of continuing programs.\nThe preparation time and expense of developing budgets will be minimized\nwithout reducing the quality of the analysis. We will instill confidence in our\nprogram cost estimates by subjecting them to independent cost analysis reviews.\nIn financial management,\nwe will move aggressively to upgrade all of our funds\ncontrol and accounting systems and to perform functions uniformly across NASA.\nWe will meet all requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act and create a\npositive environment that encourages our financial managers to excel. NASA\n\n19\nprogram managers will be provided with the budgetary support, program\nanalysis, and fiscal information required for sound program execution.\nContinual Improvement.\nWe are committed to demonstrating\nand promoting\nexcellence and continually improving processes, products, and services to better\nsatisfy our customers\' needs and requirements.\nWe will utilize quality-focused\nleadership and management practices, as well as employee empowerment,\nto\nenable us to provide our customers excellent products and services in the most\ncost-effective\nand timely manner.\nEducation.\nWe will use NASA\'s inspiring mission, unique facilities, and\nspecialized workforce to promote excellence in America\'s educational system.\nSpecifically, we will work to enhance scientific and technical competence and\nliteracy. We will do this by capturing the educational potential of each NASA\nprogram and by conducting and facilitating education programs at all educational\nlevels. We will maximize the delivery and impact of our education programs by\nengaging our research and contractor communities in our educational efforts, by\nusing state-of-the-art\neducational technologies,\nand by developing partnerships\nwith the education community.\nWe seek to help the national education system to\nmeet civilian aerospace needs and the broader scientific and technological\nneeds\nof our Nation. Special emphasis will be placed on fostering historically\nunderrepresented\ngroups to pursue careers in science, mathematics,\nand\nengineering.\nEnvironmental\nStewardship.\nWe will conduct all of our activities recognizing our\nenvironmental\nresponsibilities.\nThe guiding principles for NASA\'s environmental\nprogram are compliance, restoration, prevention, and conservation.\nEqual Opportunity and Diversity. We will institutionalize\nequal opportunity,\nequity, and diversity in all that we do. Women, minorities, and individuals with\ndisabilities will be integrated into all occupational groups, grade levels, and\norganizational\nunits; they will hold significant project, program, and senior\nmanagement positions; and they will be in the pool of outstanding talent from\nwhich candidates are selected. Our work environment will be free of\ndiscrimination\nand fully accessible, and it will be perceived to be so by all\nemployees and applicants for employment.\nNASA will be a place where equity\nand diversity are essential parts of the management practices of the Agency, its\ncontractors, grantees, and other affiliated organizations.\nWomen, minorities,\nolder workers, and persons with disabilities will be fully involved in NASA\nprograms and activities and in the universities, companies, and other\norganizations\ndoing business with NASA.\nEthics and Standards of Conduct. NASA will foster an environment in which\nadherence to fundamental ethical principles and compliance with related laws\nand regulations flourish. We will do this not only because it is required, but\nbecause it is the proper and appropriate thing to do. Leadership by example,\nindividual awareness, and enlightened instruction will ensure that all NASA\n\n20\nemployees recognize and acknowledge the ethical bases and implications of\ntheir activities.\n\nIn this way, we will enhance\n\npublic trust in NASA\'s people and\n\nprograms.\nExtemal Review, We will seek advice from external communities both formally\nand informally.\nWe will employ mechanisms such as advisory committees,\nindependent program reviews, and informal discussions to hear from\nrepresentatives\nof the Congress, the Administration,\nother Federal agencies,\nindustry, the science community, and other relevant communities.\nWe will\nevaluate program merit and priorities on the basis of conflict-free peer review and\nadvice from committees broadly representative of our customers.\nIntemati0nal Cooperation.\nWe highly value intemational\ncooperation which has\nbeen, and will remain, an integral element of our Nation\'s civil space program.\nSuch cooperation spreads the cost burden of space activities, providing higher\nreturn on U.S. taxpayer dollars; it enhances mission capabilities through access\nto international capabilities; and it advances U.S. foreign policy goals. In\naddition, cooperation with other nations strengthens the bonds of peace shared\nby people everywhere.\nNASA will continue to pursue mutually beneficial\ncooperative activities in aeronautics and space with other nations, mindful of the\nneed to strengthen American competitiveness\nyet consistent with the National\nAeronautics\nand Space Act\'s directive to encourage peaceful international\ncooperation.\nNational and (_ommunitv Service. We will be responsible citizens by getting\ninvolved in national andcommunity\nservice. We will support and conduct\nactivities benefiting communities at the local, regional, and national levels. We\nwill identify opportunities for service and volunteer to address the pressing social\nneeds of our Nation.\nProcurement/Acquisition.\nWe will conduct all NASA acquisition activities with a\ncommitment to quality, integrity, efficiency, and teamwork, recognizing the\nimportance of these key factors in an effective acquisition process.

We will provide\nprompt, thorough, and accurate information to the media and the public. We will\nactively seek opportunities and pathways to disseminate information.\nWe will\ndevelop approaches to ensure that we convey the relevance of our programs in\nterms of both increased knowledge about Earth and the Universe and also\npractical benefits that will improve everyday life.\nSafety. and Mission Assurance.\nWe will conduct our programs so that we are\nrecognized as an international leader in safety, quality, and mission assurance\n\n21\nactivities. We will utilize a systematic and disciplined\nadvocacy,\n\noversight,\n\nand support to the technical\n\napproach involving\nrisk decision-making\nprocess.\n\nSmall and Small Disadvantaged\nBusiness Utilization. We will fully integrate small\nand small disadvantaged\nbusinesses into the competitive base of contractors\nfrom which NASA purchases goods and services and will urge NASA\'s prime\ncontractors to do the same in their subcontracting\nactivities. At a minimum, we\nwill meet, and we will urge our prime contractors to meet, small and small\ndisadvantaged\nbusiness utilization goals as established by Congress and as\nnegotiated with the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nIn contracting with small\nand small disadvantaged\nbusinesses, NASA will seek and urge its prime\ncontractors to mentor, nurture, and develop such firms so as to forge permanent,\nmutually beneficial business relationships with them, particularly in high\ntechnology areas.\n\n22\n\nIMPLEMENTING\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nWe seek to better satisfy our customers and to expand our horizons consistent\nwith our mission. Our ability to respond to future opportunities\nunder tight fiscal\nconstraints, however, requires that we increase our effectiveness and efficiency\nwhile achieving significant cost reductions in current and future programs. To\nthis end, we will pursue new ways of doing business. We will:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Accept prudent risk while striving for lower costs, shorter development\ntimes, and more frequent missions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Explore new conceptual approaches; stimulate and reward innovation\nand creativity\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Streamline management;\nmake decisions quickly; minimize reviews and\ndocumentation\nrequirements to those essential for safety and quality\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cut red tape; streamline administrative processes and reduce\nadministrative\ncosts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Increase institutional efficiency by consolidating programs and reducing\nfunctional overlaps\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Empower employees to do their jobs and managers to manage, while\nholding all accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ensure excellent intemal communications\nby keeping all employees\ninformed of activities and policies that affect them and by providing open,\nreceptive channels to communicate concerns and suggestions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use cutting edge technology; take advantage of external technology\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Seek to bring about improved space launch capabilities to reduce the\nfraction of the NASA budget allocated to space launch\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conduct reviews prior to program initiation and throughout program life to\nconfirm compliance with cost, schedule, and performance targets and to\ncontinually reaffirm relevance and contribution to our mission\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Minimize development cost growth by increasing pre-development\ninvestment and preparation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Work with other Federal agencies, other nations\' space agencies, and\nU.S. industry, relying on them to complement and support our activities\nwhere sensible and cost-effective\narrangements\ncan be made\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Emphasize research and development; transfer operational activities, as\nfeasible, to other Federal agencies or commercial operators\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Consider closing facilities that are duplicative, too expensive to maintain,\nor not tightly linked to mission requirements\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Terminate activities once they have produced desired results or ceased\nto be relevant to the Agency\'s mission or broader national needs\nAs we pursue the new ways of doing business above, we will follow decision\nrules which are consistent with our values and operating principles. We will:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In general:\n--Maintain\n\nexcellence\n\nin all that we do\n\n23\n--Forego activity in areas where we cannot maintain adequate\nsafety or robustness or a standard of excellence that would add\nvalue to the field\n--Institutionalize equal opportunity, equity, and diversity as an\nunderlying premise in all that we do\n--Ensure that NASA Centers are Centers of Excellence in their\nfields\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In selecting activities:\n--Evaluate and consider all costs (development, launch, operations,\netc.) before initiating activities\n--Undertake only those new programs which are consistent with our\nStrategic Plan and which have annual and life cycle costs\nconsistent with realistic budget expectations\n--Provide managers and employees the in-house research and\ndevelopment experience necessary to maintain expertise and to\nbe "smart buyers" in their oversight of contracts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In implementing activities:\n--Pursue our Strategic Enterprises aggressively\n--Eliminate, if necessary, the lowest priority programs within each\nStrategic Enterprise, rather than eliminating a whole Enterprise\n--Maintain the capabilities of the Strategic Functions at levels\nadequate to support the activities of the Strategic Enterprises\n--Maintain reasonable and adequate reserves throughout the life of\nall programs\n--Behave reliably; once we have made the decision to undertake an\nactivity, follow it through to completion\n--Honor our international agreements and commitments\n--Execute our mission with a sense of urgency; do what we say we\nwill do\nNext Steps. We seek to manage the affairs of the Agency effectively and\nefficiently in the context of a broad plan, recognizing political and budgetary\nrealities.
