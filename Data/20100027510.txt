A photovoitaic energy\nsource using the new cell could be\ncombined on a wafer with the circuit it\nis to power. For example, a computer\nmodule could be built on a silicon\nwafer with the energy for the internal\ninformation processing , and even\nreadouts , derived from an external\nlight source . The new cell consists of\nmany voltage-generating regions that\nare interconnected internally or externally to give the desired voltage-andcurrent combination .\n(See page 412 .)\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nGas-Laser Power Monitor\n\n4-Jw\n~~\n,\n\n!\n\nAttached to the front of a laser\nhousing , a gas-laser power monitor\nreads the power output continuously\nwhile the laser is in use. It is calibrated\nto read either the total power output of\nthe laser or the power generated in a\ntest volume . No modifications to the\nlaser are required the monitor\nsimply attaches to the laser end cap. It\nis fabricated from four black-anodized\naluminum parts . A piece of crown\nglass positioned at the Brewster angle\nreflects a small fraction of the beam\ninto a photodiode, which is calibrated\nfor an electrical output proportional to\nthe laser power.\n(See page 430.)\n\nNew Pressure-Sensitive\nSilicone Adhesive\nA new pressure-sensitive silicone\nadhesive for high or low temperatures\ndoes not stretch severely under load .\nThe blend of silicone tackifler and\ncured rubbery silicone is used without\nsolvents . It is produced by combining\nan intermediate-molecular-weight\npressure-sensitive silicone adhesive,\nwhich does not cure , with a silicone\nresin , which generally cures with a\ncatalyst to a rubbery tack-free state.\nThe ratio of silicone tackifier to\nsilicone resin is varied to obtain\ndifferent degrees of tack, creep\nresistance , and tensile strength.\n(See page 452.)\n\nCardiopulmonary DataAcquisition System\n\nA computerized cardiopulmonary\ndata-acquisition system controls and\nmonitors bicycle and treadmill cardiovascular stress tests . It acquires and\nreduces stress data and displays in\nreal time the heart rate , blood\npressure, workload, respiratory rate ,\nexhaled-gas composition , and other\nvariables . The data are printed on a\nhard-copy terminal every 30 seconds\nso that the operator can quickly\nrespond to the subject throughout the\ntest. The ergometer workload is\ncontrolled in real time according to the\nexperimental protocol, and the collected data are stored directly on tape\nIn analog form and on floppy disks in\ndigital form for posttest data processing .\n(See page 457 .)\n\nGage for Evaluating\nRheumatoid Hands\n\n".--\n\n........\n\n-\n\nA two-axis goniometer accurately\nmeasures the movements of the\nfingers about the knuckle jOints . It can\nhelp to diagnose hands that have\nstructurally changed because of\nrheumatoid arthiritis. The new goniometer measures lateral movement\nwhich is small in normal knuckle jOints\nbut Increases in diseased joints. The\ninstrument is basically two connected\nprotractors that simultaneously measure angles in perpendicular planes . Its\ndials are offset to clear the bony\nprotuberances that result from\nrheumatoid arthritis . Extension and\noffset adjustments span any hand\nsize .\n(See page 461.)\n\nCo pact Infrared Detector\nCompactness, high responsivity,\nand high noise immunity are among\nthe advantages of a new broadband IR\ndetector that could be Integrated into a\ncompact package for pollution monitoring and weather prediction. The\nsensing material is a transparent\nsheet, metalized with a reflecting\ncoating and then overcoated with a\n(continued on next page)\nAll\n\nCavity-Backed SplralSlot Antenna\n\nblack material on the same side . Each\npulse produced by chopping the\ninfrared source beam with a shutter\ncreates a transient "thermal lens"\nthat temporarily defocuses a reflected\nlaser-beam probe . The defocusing\nincreases as the infrared intensity\nincreases. A detector monitors the\nprobe beam , which weakens as the\ninfrared light becomes more intense .\n(See page 475.)\n\nImproved Microbe Detection\nin Water Samples\nRETAINER\nRING\n\nABSORBENT\n\nPAD~~::::===~!r\n\nHand-Held Coupler\nfor Arthroscope\n\nA new flush-mounted antenna can\nbe switched to give either a radiation\npeak or a null on the axis, with circular\npolarization in either case. It is\ncompact and can withstand severe\nmechanical and thermal loads . The\nradiating elements consist of two pairs\nof center-fed Interleaved spiral slots in\na conductive plane. Each slot in each\npair lies between the slots of the other\npair. At the center feedpoint of each\npair of slots, a balanced feed assembly drives the slot from a split-tube\ncoaxial balun.

Calculations\nshow that when the number of\nchoppers is increased to two, three, or\nmore, ripple and electromagnetic\ninterference (EMI) are substantially\nreduced and efficiency is improved.\nThe basic advantages of the boost\nchopper - compactness , high efficiency, and power factors approaching unity - are retained .\nThe elementry boost chopper has a\nbridge-based power circuit and a drive\ncircuit that adjusts the rate of charge\nin response to changes in key battery\nparameters . An inductor, a transistor,\nand a diode in the power circuit make\nup the chopper, which boosts the\nbridge output so that current is\ndelivered to the battery. The drive\ncircuit adjusts the chopper duty cycle\nto give a near-unity power factor.\nIn the n-phase chopper, diagramed\nIn the figure, each inductor carries\n1In of the current handled by the\ninductor of the analogous single-phase\ncircuit. A modulator controls the duty\ncycle of the transistors , making the\ninstantaneous current through the\ninductors proprtional to the instantaneous bridge output voltage . With this\nproportionality, the charger operates\nat a power factor near unity.\nBecause the ripple in the different\nchopper phases tends to cancel, the\nnet ripple is low, as is the EMI\nproduced by the charger. Switching\nspikes are lowered, because the\ncurrent steps are reduced below that\nof the single-phase chopper.\nFor example, a three-phase chopper reduces ripple to one-ninth its\nsingle-phase value. At the same time,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\n"-PHASE CHOPPER\n\nPHASE 1\nPHASE 2\n\nPOWER\nFROM\nBRIDGE\nCIRCUIT\n\nPHASE"\n\n-=-\n\nBATIERY\n\nCONTROL\nf----f\nSIGNAL C>-FROM\nBATIERY 0 - -+----1\nSENSORS\n\nDrive circuit of n-Ph.se Boost Chopper Incorporates an n-phase duty-cycle\ngenerator. Each chopper is composed of an inductor, a transistor, and a diode.\n\nthe ripple frequency is increased three\ntimes , and the ripple can therefore be\nmore easily filtered out by small\ninductors and capacitors. The value of\ncapacitance used to clamp switching\nspikes and protect the switching\ntransistors is reduced to one-ninth its\nsingle-phase value . Thus a smaller\nand less-expensive capacitor can be\nused .\nIn general, an n-phase chopper\nreduces the ripple magnitude by a\nfactor of n2 while increasing the ripple\nfundamental frequency n times . The\noutput capacitance is reduced by at\nleast 1 In. Although ripple theoretically\nfalls rapidly with increasing phases , It\nis probably not practical to increase n\nbeyond three or four, because the\ninductors must be more closely\nmatched as n increases, the transistor\n\ndrive signals must be more closely\nmatched , and the polyphase generator\nbecomes more expensive .\nThe charger can be operated by\nsingle-phase or three-phase alternating current, at 115 or 230 volts , for\nexample, or by direct current. With\ndc , It is possible for one electric\nvehicle to charge another in a road\nemergency.\nThis work was done by Wally E.\nRippel of Cal tech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Experimentation has\nconfirmed that a solar cell may be\ndivided into voltage-generating regions,\ncalled unit cells, which may be interconnected internally or externally to\nresult In desired voltage and current\noutput combination . The finding also\nopens up the field of usage in which\nphotovoltaic energy sources may be\ncombined on a wafer with the circuits\nthey are designed to power. For example, it can be speculated that it\nwould be possible to build a computer\nmodule upon a silicon wafer with the\nenergy for the internal information\nprocessing and even the readouts\nderived from an external light source.\nThe accompanying sketch details a\ntypical solar-cell structure of the new\nplanar multijunction (PMJ) high-voltage\ncell. The starting material for the cited\nexample is high-lifetime, single-crystal,\nCzochralski-grown silicon . As shown,\nthe device has a thickness of 3 to 4\nmils with a textured or planar surface\nand with an antireflection coating\napplied to the illuminated surface . In\nthis surface, divided into regions\nlocated over the unit voltage-generating unit cells, are implanted or\ndiffused dopants resulting in a frontsurface field or a front junction,\ndepending upon the chosen dopant\ntype . When p-type silicon of any\nresistivity from 1 to 20,000 ohm-cm is\nused for the base material, a front\njunction of n + dopant such as phosphorus or front surface field of p +\nmaterial such as boron or aluminum\nmay be used. Some benefit is derived\nfrom the use of high-resistivity and\nhigh-lifetime material for the base.\nIn any unit voltage-generating unit\ncell , as shown , a p + diffused or\nimplanted region approximately 25\nmicrometers wide is diffused Into a\njunction depth of 1 micrometer. Next to\nthis narrow band of dopant, an undoped\nband of the same width is left. Next to\nthe undoped region a wide band of n +\ndopant is inserted to a depth of 1\nmicrometer.

Each slot in each pair lies between the slots of the other pair.\nThe aperture plate is the top of a cavity that is a quarter-wavelength deep. At\nthe center feedpoint of each pair of\nslots, a balanced feed assembly drives\nthe slot from a split-tube coaxial balun .\nBoth baluns extend down through the\nbottom of the cavity to a four-port hy-\n\nbrid ; the input to the hybrid can be\nswitched to feed the pairs of slots either\nin a sum mode or a difference mode\n(Le ., in the same phase or 90\xc2\xb0 out of\nphase).\nThe arrayed spiral-slot elements radiate circularly polarized patterns of\nthe general shape shown in Figure 2.\nThe sum (E) mode radiation pattern has\na null on the axis, and the difference (.:1)\nmode has a pattern that peaks on the\naxis. The entire apparatus is reciprocal ,\nso these patterns represent received\nsignals as well as transmitted ones.\nThe length of the spiral trace of each\nhalf of a slot pair is approximately 3V2\nwavelengths, which yields a relatively\nlarge bandwidth.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn synchronized electronic systems ,\nsuch as the phased microwave antenna array a solar-power satellite would\nuse or the accurate clock-distribution\nsystems In avionics and computers,\nperformance depends critically on fixing the phase relationship between\nsystem components , or nodes. To\nmaintain synchronization , a master\ntiming signal at a fixed phase and\nfrequency must be available at each\nnode .\nSuch a timing signal is propagated\nwithout phase shift through an array of\nnodes by the master/slave returnable\ntiming system (MSRTS) . The MSRTS\nactively compensates for phase-shift\ndrift caused by changing transmission\ndelay between nodes .\nThe basic idea of the MSRTS is to\ncancel the transmission delay by\nreturning back to the master a sample\nof the signal received at the slave. The\nphase transmitted from the master is\nthen advanced until it leads the\noriginal phase by the same amount\nthat the returned signal lags behind\nthe original. Then, to the approximation that the transmission delays to\nand from the slave are identical, the\nphase of the signal received at the\nslave matches that of the original\nmaster signal.\nSince the phase of the master is\nregenerated at the slave node, the\nprocess can be repeated, with each\nslave serving as master for one or\nmore following nodes . As shown in the\nfigure , the nodes can be arranged in a\n\nSECONDLEVEL\nSLAVES\n\nNodes In the MSRTS are arranged as a tree, with each node serving as master for\nseveral slave nodes. As the signal at each slave Is synchronized with the original\nmaster, it can be used as a master to synchronize other slave nodes.\n\ntree , with each node transmitting to\nmore th~n one slave further along the\ntree .\nThe assumption that the forward\nand return paths have equal delays is\nan idealization. In practice, the\nhardware components in the path are\nnot perfect, and differences between\nthe transmit and receive paths must\nbe accounted for. This is done by a\nstatistical model that assumes the\ndelay imbalance is a random variable\nwith zero mean.\nAn MSRTS tree phase-distribution\nsystem is proposed for controlling the\nphasing of the transmitting antenna of\n\na geosynchronous solar-power satellite. It would use a phased antenna\narray about 0 .6 mi (1 km) in diameter\nand would transmit microwave energy\nto Earth from an altitude of 23,000\nmiles (37,000 km) .\nThis work was done by A. V.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA simple disk radiator mounted over\na conducting plane can be used as a\nflush-mounted microwave antenna.\nHowever, better antenna characteristics are achieved by placing another\n422\n\nconducting plane above the disk, connecting the top and bottom planes so\nthat the disk is enclosed in a cavity, and\ncutting a V-shaped slot in the top plane.\nThe cavity is excited by the microwave\n\nenergy from the disk and radiates from\nthe trislot aperture in the top plate.\nThe figure shows details of the trislotcavity antenna, including the arrangement for feeding the signal to the disk.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nThe three slots are 120 0 apart, are Ao/4\nlong (where Ao is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency of the\nmicrowave signal), and are Ao/40 wide .\nThe conductors that pass through the\ndielectric boards to connect the top\nand bottom metal planes are spaced\n30 0 apart, at a radius that is greater\nthan the slot length by the thickness of\nthe antenna.\nThe excitation disk has a radius of\n.10\'4\xc2\xa3; i.e., less than the slot length by a\nfactor equal to the dielectric constant \xc2\xa3\nof the construction boards. A conducting post connects the center of the disk\nto the bottom conducting plane. Two\nfeedpoints are located off-center and\ndriven by a quadrature hybrid RF circuit.\nThe radiation bandwidth (determined\nby a voltage standing-wave ratio below\n1.5:1) is 2 percent for the trislot-cavity\narrangement as compared to 0.5 percent for an unenclosed disk.

The light source, a hellumlneon laser, was selected for Its high Intensity and the ease with which It can be collimated . A\nmask with allned parallel slits Is mounted at the entrance to the prism stack.\n\nMany preCisely divergent beams are\ncreated from a single laser beam by a\nstack of prisms in a new optical\ninstrument. Each beam points in a\nslightly different direction with a\nprecise angular relationship to the\nothers . The multiprlsm collimator can\nbe used to measure angles in\nsurveyIng land and alining machine\nelements .\nUnlike many other devices for\nmeasuring angles , the multiprism\ncollimator is nearly immune to vibratid\'n , changes in gravitational force,\ntemperature variations, and mechanical distortion . It is accurate within 1\nmicroradian in its present form, and It\nwould be even more accurate If it were\nbuilt in larger sizes.\nAs shown in the figure , the beam\nfrom a helium/neon laser is expanded\nand collimated by a conventional\noptical collImator . The beam is then\ndirected onto a stack of prisms, so\nthat each prism intercepts a different\nportion of the wave front. The angles\nof the front and rear prism faces and\ntheir refractive indices are selected to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\ndivert the beam by a given amount,\ndifferent for each prism . The angle of\nthe emerging beam thus changes by\nincrements from one end of the prism\narray to the other. For example, the\ndirection may vary from + r to _7\xc2\xb0\nfrom one side of the array to the other,\nwith the prisms providing 1\xc2\xb0 increments and the deviation of the center\nwedge being 0\xc2\xb0 .\nThe prisms are mounted at their\npositions of minimum deviation . ThIs\nmeans that the angle of incident light\nis at the minimum of the deviation-vs.incidence-angle curve. In thIs regIon,\nthe dIrectIons of the emerging beams\nare least sensItIve to changes In\nincidence angle. The accuracy of the\ndeviation , therefore, is relatively unaffected by dimensional distortions.\nMechanical motion of the collimator\ncauses all the beams to shift in unison\nbut does not change the angular\nseparation between the beams.\nThe glass used for the prisms is\nselected for its low-temperature coefficIent of refractive index. This property ensures that the instrument\n\naccuracy is hardly affected by temperature changes .\nIn a collimator that has been built,\nthe prisms are 4.7 mm thick and 82 .5\nmm wide. A stack of 15 such prisms in\nthe mounting fixture provides a clear\naperture 70.7 mm high and slightly\nmore than 70 .7 mm wide .\nPrism arrays can be designed to\nproduce various increments and\nranges of deviation, since the parameters are determined chiefly by the\nangles of the entrance and exit faces\nfor a given index of refraction. The\nimportant constraint is that the deviation of an individual prism should\napproximate the minimum deviation .\nThis work was done by Peter O.\nMinott of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

Previously, the relatively high\npressures In such lasers precluded\nelectric-discharge excitation , and an\nelectron beam was usually considered\nas the primary energy source . However, electric-dlscharge circuits are\npreferred because they are potentially\nmore efficient, more compact , capable of high repetition rate , and less\nexpensive than an electron-beam\napparatus .\nSelf-sustained discharges in highpressure rare-gas mixtures are difficult to control because the gas tends\nto break down and form localized\narcs. In addition , high-voltage and\nhigh-energy charging circuits usually\nhave large inductances that reduce\nvoltage rise times below that required\nfor optimum gas excitation .\nThe proposed network compresses\nthe width of high-voltage pulses from a\nrelatively-slow rise-time voltage generator and gradually grades the circuit\nimpedance from the Inherent high\nimpedance of the generator to the low\nimpedance of the gas .\nAs shown in the block diagram\n(Figure 1) , the network consists of two\nsaturable Inductor switches, each with\na distributed-capacitance ene rgystorage device at its input.

The units accept radiation\nstrictly from the solar disk, eliminating\ncircumsolar radiation (radiation scattered by dust and the atmosphere). By\neliminating the circumsolar inputs,\nmore-precise measurements can be\nmade of energy captured by the\nreceiver apertures of highly-concentrating solar thermal-energy converters.\nVersion (a) field limiter, 16 in. (41 cm)\nlong, uses an achromatic objective lens\n(similar to those used in small refractor telescopes) to form an image of the\nSun at an aperture just ahead of the\nradiometer cavity. Version (b) is\nshorter, 7.4 in. (18.8 cm), and hence\nmore convenient. Its shorter-focallength achromatic objective forms a\nsmaller image that is magnified by\nanother lens and imaged onto an\naperture.\nThe diameter of the image at the\naperture (3.8 mm) is the same in both\nversions. Aperture diameter determines the instrument acceptance angie; i.e., the aperture is a field stop. An\naperture the same diameter as the\nsolar image would prevent circumsolar\nradiation from entering the radiometer\ncavity.\nConcentrating or focusing solar-energy collectors form an image of the\nSun on the collecting element. The Sun\nsubtends an angle of 32 arc minutes.\nPractical solar collectors accept radiation from a somewhat larger angle to\navoid having the intense solar image\nfall on anything but the collector element.

Measurements of radiation from the solar disk alone are\nalso needed for comparison. Either\ntype of measurement can be made by\nplacing an aperture of the proper diameter in the field limiter.\nEither version of the field limiter\nwould require calibration against a\n\nstandard radiometer because reflection and absorption losses in the lenses\nprevent accurate sensitivity calculations from geometry alone.

The target range is\ncomputed from the number of pulses\ntriggered in a precise period of time,\nsay 1 second .\nTypical optical radar for measuring\nlonger distances determines range by\nmeasuring the time of flight of a single\npulse .

One operating\nmode is used: The system turns on\nwhen the collector outlet temperature\nclimbs 25 0 F (14 0 C) above the\ntemperature of the water in the bottom\nof the preheat tank; it turns off when\nthis difference falls below 8 0 F (4 0 C).\nThe solar-heating system can supply\napproximately 75 percent of the domestic hot water needed for a singlefamily residence in Togus, Maine. The\neconomic payback period for the system at this site is estimated at 19 years.\nEconomic benefits from this solarenergy system depend primarily on two\nfactors: the maintenance or decrease\nof the initial investment required and\nthe continuing increase in the cost of\nconventional energy.

Its performance over a\n12-month period (from June 1979\nthrough May 1980) is described in a\nreport that is now available.\nControl failures, occurring most\nseverely in February, caused electrical strip heaters to turn on unnecessarily while solar heat was available.\nConsequently, almost 5 million Btu (5\nbillion joules) were wasted in 1 month.\nEven if the controls had operated\ncorrectly, fossil-fuel savings would not\nhave been impressive; much of the\nenergy accumulated by the solar\ncollectors was dissipated in losses\nthrough heat exchangers and ductwork, while operating-energy requirements for the many motors and\nlengths of tubing were high.\nFor this site and solar-energy\napplication, more net energy could\nhave been realized with a system\nutilizing only a direct space-heating\nmode or a hot-water-preheating\nmode. The most inefficient mode of\nthe tested system was the one in\nwhich heat pumps mingled alternatively storage or collector energy with\nelectric-heat-strip energy to satisfy the\nspace-heating demand.

During the reporting period\nfrom April 1979 to March 1980, the\nmeasured average outdoor ambient\ntemperature was 48\xc2\xb0 F (9\xc2\xb0 C). Solar\nenergy supplied 15 percent of the\nmeasured load for hot water and\nspace heating .\nThe Lansing installation uses 278\nsquare feet (25.8 square meters) of hotair flat-plate collectors, three 120-galIon (454-liter) meter storage tanks , a\nliquid/air heat exchanger , an energy\ntransport module, pumps, controls, and\ntransfer lines. The unusual combination\nof water storage with an air collecting\nmedium stores heat in about one-third\nthe space of a rock-bin system, but with\nconsequent loss of heat-exchanging efficiency.\nUnusual operating conditions during\nthe report period made it difficult to\nassess performance. A large amount of\nhot-water was consumed in the final 7\nmonths - generally over 225 gallons\n(852 liters) per day, and as a result\nalmost all the solar energy collected\nduring this period was used in support\nof the hot-water subsystem. Solar-energy support was greatly reduced for the\nspace-heating subsystem, contrary to\ndesign expectations. Nonetheless, net\nsavings were approximately 21 million\nBtu (22 billion joules).\nThis work was done by the Federal\nSystems Division of IBM Corp. for Mar\xc2\xb7\nshall Space Flight Center.

Heat is transferred to each of\nthree domestic-hot-water tanks by\ncirculating water from these tanks\nthrough the tube side and water from\nthe storage tank through the shell side\nof a tube-and-shell heat exchanger .\nThe parts and operation of this system\nare described, along with maintenance, performance, and warranty\ninformation , in a report that is available upon request.\nThe modular roof-mounted solarenergy collectors have copper absorber plates . They are painted flat black,\nglazed , and insulated on the back. The\ncollector array and piping are graded\nto drain into the storage tank whenever the collector circulating pump is\nnot operating. The storage tank is\nvented to the atmosphere, and two\nvacuum breakers for the collectors\nadmit air during draindown to speed\ndrainage and prevent vapor problems.\nWhen the absorber plate of one\ncollector becomes 12\xc2\xb0 F (7\xc2\xb0 C)\nwarmer than the bottom of the storage\ntank , the collector circulating pump\nturns on to fill all the collectors and\nbegin their operation . When the\ntemperature difference drops to a\npredetermined level, the pump turns\noff and the collectors drain back into\nstorage .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nIf the temperature at the top of the\nstorage tank is 30 0 F (17 0 C) greater\nthan the temperature at the bottom of\nany of the three DHW tanks, water\nfrom the cold tanks is circulated\nthrough the heat exchanger, along\nwith hot water from the storage tank .\nThis heat-exchanger system, operating independently of the solar-collector system, shuts off again when the\ntemperature differences decrease to\n15 0 F (8 0 C) .\nThis work was done by Day\'s Inn of\nAmerica, Inc. , for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

A recent report describes the\nequipment and its operation and\nmaintenance . The system is well\ntested, and at the Savannah installation no major problems were encountered with its operation .\nThe 1,OOO-gallon (3,780-liter) fiberglass storage tank contains two heat\nexchangers: One heats water in the\nstorage tank with fluid from the solar\ncollectors ; and the other preheats the\ncold-water supply as it passes through\nto the domestic hot-water heaters,\nwhich have electrical elements for\nsupplementing energy from the Sun .\n\nTemperature sensors are located in\nthe collector plates and in the storage\ntank , and controller pumps are turned\non or off according to the measured\ntemperature differential .\nCostly structural-steel mounting for\nthe solar collectors was bypassed by\nusing guy wires to secure the collector\narray to the roof . Although no roof\npenetrations were required over the\noccupied space, the mounting system\nis rated to withstand 120-mile-perhour (193-kilometer-per-hour) winds .\nThe solar-energy system provides an\naverage of 2,440 gallons (9,240 liters)\nof 140 0 F (60 0 C) water at the\ninstallation .\nThis work was done by Day\'s Inn of\nAmerica, Inc ., for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

The\nsystem uses flat-plate liquid collectors\ncirculating an antifreeze solution.\nEquipment specifications and modifications to existing building heating and\nhot-water systems are described\nalong with other information in a report\nthat is now available.\nFour rows of roof-mounted solar\ncollectors at the North Little Rock site\nare surrounded by an architectural\nscreen for an attractive building\nprofile . Solar-collector area was determined by optimizing building load,\n\ncollector output, and cost. Architectural considerations led to two of the\ncollectors being tilted at an angle of\nonly 25 0 , although the optimum is\ngreater; the performance penalty for\nthis modification is slight.\nBecause of the continual demand\nfor domestic hot water at the restaurant, storage is less important than at\nother sites; storage capacity is equal\nto the estimated daily hot-water\nrequirement . Two heat exchangers\nbetween the collector fluid and the\npotable hot-water supply prevent\nwater contamination from the antifreeze solution flowing through the\ncollectors . Water is pumped directly\nfrom storage through a coil for space\nheating.

The\nmetastable helium is sufficiently energetiC to ionize nearby atoms and\nmolecules (except neon), which are\ndetected by collecting the ion current\nat a charged electrode. The currentl\nvoltage response has a linear collection region at low voltage, a saturation\nregion where current is voltage-\n\nWhile it can be argued that the\nhelium ionization detector is theoretically ideal for gas chromatography, it is\nusually bypassed in favor of conventional flame-ionization and thermalconductivity detectors. Ironically, the\nsame features that make it advantageous - namely, its high sensitivity\nand responsiveness to nearly all atoms\nand molecules - are also responsible\nfor its shortcomings, which include\nhigh noise levels and oversensitivity to\nbackground and contamination .\nMany of the deficiencies can be\neliminated, however, by operating the\nhelium ionization detector in its "saturation " region , rather than its " multiplication " region as has been customary .\nWith this simple change, the detector\n\nindependent, and an exponential multiplication region at high voltage , resulting from the participation of secondary\nelectrons.\nConventionally, the detector is operated in the multiplication region, where\nresponse is high; but so too are\nbackground current and noise. To minimize background current induced by\natmospheric diffusion, some experimenters have even gone so far as to\noperate the entire chromatograph in a\nhelium atmosphere.\nIn contrast, when the detector is\noperated in its saturation region where its current output is independent\nof applied voltage, the result is low\nbackground current , low noise, high\nstability, and high sensitivity.

The technique, using platlnized TI0 2, produces halogen molecules\neasily and inexpensively, without using\nelectricity directly.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1980\n\nallows the oxidation / reduction reactions, which normally occur at very\nlow rates or which may be thermodynamically unfavorable, to occur at\nhigher rates in the presence of semiconductors and light. Platinized,\npowdered Ti02 can photocatalyze\nsome reactions that otherwise proceed slowly. Such powders are analogous to a system of many short-circuited photoelectrolysis cells; but the\npowder is less expensive than commercial electrodes, and it has a much\nhigher surface-area-to-weight ratio an important criterion for a good\ncatalyst.\nThe PtlTi02 powder is prepared by\nilluminating with ultraviolet radiation a\nsolution of 15 ml platinic acid\n(H2PtCIS), 15 ml glacial acetic acid,\nand 2 grams of Ti02 powder. The\npowder is of the anatase phase and\ncan be doped or undoped. In a typical\npreparation, the resulting catalytic\npowder is 1: 10 by weight of doped\nPt :Ti0 2\xc2\xb7\nTypically, 100 to 200 mg of this\ncatalyst are suspended in a solution\ncontaining 35 ml of 1-, Br-, or\nsalts\n(about 2M concentration) and irradiated with ultraviolet light from a 1,000watt high-pressure mercury lamp .\nAfter several hours of irradiation, the\ncolor typical of the halogen molecule\nof interest appears in the solution:\nbrown for 12; yellow-brown for Br2;\nyellow-green for C12.\n\nThe amount of halogen produced is\ndetermined by two methods. In the\nfi rst method, a known amount of As\n(III) is introduced into the halide\nsolution . After irradiation, the solution\nis titrated with iodine in the presence\nof starch . The difference in the\namount of As (III) before and after\nirradiation indicates the amount of\nhalogen produced . In the second\nmethod, the solution is first saturated\nwith 02 , and the reaction cell is\nclosed . After irradiation, the amount\nof halogen produced is determined by\ntitration in the presence of starch . (In\nthe cases of Br2 and C12. KI is added\nbefore titration .)\nThe rate of production of halogen is\nsummarized in the table . For comparison, the rate of production of halogen\nis also given in the presence of\nunplatinized Ti02 powders.\nThe reduction of 02 molecules\noccurs simultaneously with the halide\noxidation. While the halide oxidation\noccurs on the illuminated side of the\nparticle according to\n\ncr\n\n(where X is the halide ion) oxygen is\nbeing reduced on the "dark " side of\nthe particle according to\n\n1\n\'2\xc2\xb02\n\n+\n\n2e\n\n-\n\n+\n\n2H\n\n+\n\n-\n\nH20\n\n(2)\n\n(continued on next page)\n\n449\n\nThe overall reaction , therefore, is\n\n1\n2X- +2"02+ 2H +_\n\nX2 +H20\n\n(3)\n\nThe half reaction in equation (2)\ndetermines the overall rate of the\nreaction in equation (3) . The Pt on the\npowders affects the overall rate by\ndecreasing the overvoltage for oxygen\nreduction .\n\nOther useful reactions could possibly be photocatalyzed or photosynthesized effectively by the plantinized\nsemiconductor powders. The technique can use light, such as solar\nradiation, and a brine solution containing a suspension of platinized semiconductor powder to produce halogen\nmolecules; or it can be used to oxidize\nhazardous materials such as CN- in\nwastewater or to convert carbon monoxide to C02 .\n\nThis work was done by Benjamin\nReichman of Christopher Newport\nCol/ege and Charles E.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nDissolved Freon gas can be removed\nfrom hydraulic fluid by raising the temperature to 150 0 F (66 0 C) and bubbling\ndry-nitrogen gas through the fluid reservoir (see figure). The procedure can be\ncarried out while the fluid is circulating\nthrough the hydraulic system. Agitating\na liquid with piped-in gas is called\nsparging; the dry-nitrogen sparging of\nthe hydraulic fluid not only removes gas\nfaster than simple heating does but\nalso results in a lower final level of contamination.\nHydraulic fluid sometimes becomes\ncontaminated when component manufacturers use Freon gas during the\nmanufacture, assembly, and cleaning\nof parts. The presence of the fluorinated hydrocarbon along with air and\nwater causes hydraulic components to\ncorrode; moreover, it also produces a\nsludge that contaminates and clogs\nfilters.\n\n.-=--= __ DRY N2\n~\nGAS\n\n-_J~~ t\n\n--,\'l"\n\nHEATING COILS\n(IF NECESSARY)\n\n____\n,,---=--~\n\nHYDRAULIC FLUID\nAT150\'F\nIN RESERVOIR\n\nBubbling Dry\xc2\xb7Nltrogen Gas through hy\xc2\xb7\ndraulic fluid at 1500 F quickly removes\nFreon gas from the fluid.

A\nblending of silicone tackifier and cured\nrubbery silicone, the new adhesive\ncan be used without solvents.\nPressure-sensitive adhesives are\ntypically made from a polymer above\nits glassy transition temperature . The\npolymers usually have intermediate\nmolecular weight (if they were of lower\nmolecular weight, they would be\nliquid; and if of higher molecular\nweight, they would be solid with no\ntack). The adhesives are prepared\nfrom the tacky resins alone or from a\nblend with other polymers and/or\nfillers . For silicone systems, the only\navailable pressure-sensitive adhesives\nare those for which the tacky inter-\n\n452\n\nmediate-molecular-weight silicone is\nused alone or in conjunction with\nmineral fillers. Polymer binders other\nthan silicones have also been used.\nConventional pressure-sensitive silicone adhesives have a tendency to\ncreep or stretch severely when they\nare placed under a stress or load .\nOther polymeric binders can alleviate\nthis problem in some instances;\nhowever, no other polymer systems\nhave the unique properties of the\nsilicones when temperature extremes\n(between -115 0 and 250 0 C) are\nexperienced .\nThe new adhesive system is produced by blending an intermediatemolecular-weight pressure-sensitive\nsilicone adhesive , which does not\ncure , with a silicone resin, which\n\ngenerally cures with a catalyst to a\nrubbery tack-free state . The result is a\npressure-sensitive silicone adhesive\nthat can be used for structural or loadbearing applications without creeping .\nThe ratio of silicone tackifier to\nsilicone resin can be varied to obtain\ndifferent degrees of tack , creep\nresistance, and tensile strength. Various formulations were tested:\n-50 /50 (tackifier/cured resin) - tack\nremains for up to 48 hours, low\ncreepage under load;\n-75 /25 (tackifier /cured resin) - tack\nremains over 3 months , low creepage under load; and\n-80 /20 (tackifier / cured resin) - tack\nremains for over 3 months, creeps\nunder load .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nFlatwise tensile strengths of various\nformulations range from 10 to 19 psi\n(69x10 3 to 131x103 N/m2) at room\ntemperature .\nThe pressure-sensitive silicone adhesive has been successfully tested at\ntemperatures from -45 0 to 232 0 C with\n\nminimal creep under structural loading .

The bubbles\nmove to a region of lower surface tension. Since surface tension decreases\nwith increasing temperature in most\nmolten glasses, bubbles rise to the surface if the temperature of the melt increases from bottom to top. Although\ndeveloped by NASA for possible materials processing in space, the same\ntechnique should work for glasses and\nother liquids in normal gravity.\nTraditionally, bubbles have been removed by buoyant " fining," in which\nthe denser glass sinks, forc ing the bubbles to move to the surface and burst.\nIn chemical fining, also used to remove\nbubbles, chemicals are added to the\nmelt to dissolve the gas contained in\nthe bubbles so that they shrink and disappear.\nBuoyant fining can be exceedingly\nslow in viscous glasses. (It does not occur at all in the absence of gravity.)\nChemical fining is even slower, espe-\n\ncially for large bubbles, since a sizable\nvolume of gas must be absorbed.\nIn experiments to test the surfacetension-gradient method on simple borax glasses, 250-JLm bubbles have been\nmoved at rates as high as 30 JLm/s. A\nfew glasses have greater surface tension at higher temperatures, in which\ncase the bubbles migrate to a cooler\nregion . A few other glasses show hardly\nany variation in surface tension with\ntemperature, and a temperature gradient would be expected to have no effect.\nAlthough the requisite heat for the\nhigh-temperature part of the melt can\nbe furnished by stationary electrical or\nnatural-gas heaters, it may also be possible to use induction heating to create\na moving hot zone that sweeps through\nthe glass, driving bubbles before it,\nmuch as in zone refining of semiconductors. Laser heating is also a possibility, perhaps aiming the beam directly\nat a bubble to move it along.\nThe new method could remove the\ngases that are inevitably generated in\n\nglass processing and which reduce\nstrength and transparency. It may\ntherefore be useful in making glass-tometal and glass-to-ceramic seals in\nsuch devices as high-pressure lamps\nand cathode-ray tubes ; in "gassivating" integrated circuits that is,\ncoating them with a protective layer of\nglass ; and in applying porcelain\nenamels to metals . The method may\nhave even broader applications. For example, it may be adapted to removing\nunwanted bubbles in processes that involve conversions between liquid and\nsolid phases or for controlling bubble\nformation in flowing fluids to prevent\nturbulence.\nThis work was done by D.

While highly\n\nalkaline solutions are normally corrosive to aluminum, it was nevertheless\nobserved that the most effective\ninhibitor combinations contained trisodium phosphate and were alkaline.\nOne disadvantage of the successful\ninhibitor combinations is that each\nmust be formulated with the prescribed amounts of four to six of the\nchemicals mentioned above, with a\ntotal concentration of 500 to 1,000\nppm, whereas only 100 to 200 ppm of\nsodium chromate are required for\neffective inhibition.

The unit, successfully used in a stress-test facility for\nover a year, records heart rate via a\npreamplified, single-lead ECG input\nSignal and produces both digital and\nanalog heart-rate outputs, which can\nbe fed to other instruments or computers . [Also see " Cardiopulmonary\nData-Acquisition System " (MSC18783) on page 457 of this issue.] The\naccuracy of the unit is better than 2\npercent over the full range, 30 to 300\nbeats per minute, and is typically\nbetter than 1 percent up to 230 beats\nper minute.\nAnalog hardware, including a filter\nfor ECG noise rejection and an improved R-wave detector, processes the\nECG input signal, producing a 10-ms\npulse for each heartbeat.

When used alone,\nmembrane filtration requires at least\n24 hours for growth to appear, and an\noperator must be available to examine\nand count colonies. The electrochemical method, on the other hand, often\nmisses small numbers of cells in large\nvolumes . Moreover, an appreciable\nlag period elapses before the buildup\nof enough cells for a measurable\nresponse . The new technique combines the advantages of both methods\nwhile overcoming these disadvantages .\nIn electrochemical microbial detection, the time between challenge and\nRETAINER\n\nFigure 1. The experimental Apparatua\nfor the Combined Technique requires\nonly standard , commercially-available\nlaboratory Items.\n\n460\n\nthe initial increase in voltage is a\nfunction of the number of cells in the\ninoculum. For Escherichia coli, detection times for 105 and 101 cells/ml\nwere 4 and 8 hours , respectively. This\nlag time is dictated by the requirement\nfor a cell population of 106 to 107\ncells/ml at the time of response.\nWhen very low numbers of organisms\nare present, especially in large volumes, there is\' also an increased\nprobability of missing cells when using\nsamples of 1, 10, or even 50 ml.\nThe experimental setup for the\ncombined method is illustrated in\nFigure 1 . It consists of a 60- by 15-mm\npetri dish, two absorbent pads 47 mm\nin diameter, a standard membrane\nfilter of 0.45-lAm pore size, and two\nplatinum-wire electrodes in a length\nratio of 2: 1. Cells are collected by the\nfilter placed on an absorbent pad\nmoistened with 2.0 ml of Trypticase\nsoy broth (TSB, BBL); the electrodes\nare positioned on the surface of the\nfilter. The other pad, moistened with\nTSB, is placed on top of the electrodes\nand filter. A retainer ring at right\nangles to the electrodes maintains\nconstant pressure and close contact\nbetween pads, filter, and electrodes .\nThe dish is sealed with parafilm to\nreduce moisture loss .\nIn dose-response studies of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus,\nvolumes from a tenfold series were\nfiltered .

It can be used to help\ndiagnose hands that have structurally\nchanged because of rheumatoid arthritis. The new goniometer measures lateral movement of a knuckle joint when\nit is flexed 70 \xc2\xb0 to 90 o. This lateral movement is small in normal joints but increases in diseased joints.\nThe new diagnostic instrument, constructed of stainless steel and brass ,\nbasically consists of two connected\nprotractors that simultaneously measure angles in perpendicular planes.\nThe goniometer dials are offset to\nclear the bony protuberances that\nresult from rheumatoid arthritis . Extension and offset adjustments span\nany size hand. The pivots are friction\ndamped, so that readings are retained\neven if the goniometer is accidently\njostled. The unit weighs about 4.5\nounces (128 grams).\nThe movable arm of the goniometer\noperates in two mutually perpendicular\nplanes (see figure), a plane perpendicular to the back of the hand (dorsal-volar\nplane) and a plane through the bones of\nthe forearm (radio-ulnar plane). The\nmeasurement procedure begins by\ndrawing a line on the middle of the back\nsurface of each finger, along its axis.\nThe stationary platform arm of the\ngoniometer rests on the back of the\nhand in alinement with the bones between the knuckle and wrist of the fingers being measured. It\' is held in position by the measurer.\nThe knuckle jOint is flexed 70 \xc2\xb0 to 90 \xc2\xb0\nwith the movable goniometer arm\nalined with the line drawn on the finger.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1980\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nSTATIONARY\nARM\n\nMOVABLE\nARM\n\nThe Two\xc2\xb7Axis Goniometer measures flection in the radio\xc2\xb7ulnar plane (top view) and in\nthe dorsal\xc2\xb7volar plane (side view).

The image travels\nalong the flexible bundle and appears\nat the other cable end, where the image\nis recollimated by a lens. The image\nseen looking into this lens is the same\nas if looking directly into the arthroscope.\nThe arthroscope allows surgeons to\nexamine internal structures and organs\nthrough a small incision or natural\nopening in the body. Its output is a collimated image that is acceptable to the\nnormal eye. If a lens is placed at the\neyepiece, a real image is formed. Projection of the real image on a color-TV\ncamera increases the image size and\nmakes it easier to view, enhancing the\nsurgical procedure.\nMethods for directly coupling a TV\ncamera to the arthroscope have several problems. First, the camera is\nbulky and is awkward to handle in a surgical environment. Second, the time\ntaken to wrap the camera in sterile\ndrapings often exceeds the time required to perform the operation. Third,\nthe 6- to 1O-pound (3- to 5-kg) camera is\ndifficult to hold for long periods. Finally,\nsince the image size is only about onefifth the major dimension of the monitor\nscreen, the actual resolution of the system is less than optimal.\nIn the new system (see Figure 1), the\nimage intensity is reduced somewhat\nby the bulk losses in the fiber and the\nFresnel losses at the fiber ends. (The\noriented 1O-micron fibers are 3 meters\nin length.) With moderate quality fibers\nand short cable lengths, however, the\nlosses are not significant. The collimated output is directed into the lens of\nthe TV camera . The camera-lens focal\nlength is chosen so that the image will\nfill the monitor screen.\nThe hand-held portion of the coupler\nis shown in Figure 2.

In\nthe method, the grade of beef\ncarcasses Is determined by analysis of\nthe ultrasonic A-scan signatures from\nthe marbling within the muscle . Since\nthe reflections from within the muscle\nare determined primarily by the\nfat/muscle interface, the richness of\nsuch reflections is a direct Indication\nof the degree of marbling and quality.\nThe method is intended to replace the\npresent subjective method of sight and\nfeel of individual USDA graders and\nultimately to yield both the grade and\nyield of live cattle .\n\nThough no work has been done on\nlive animals , tests on butchered-beef\nspecimens indicate a definite trend\nbetween ultrasonic signatures and\ngrade . A typical scan of each grade is\nshown in Figure 1. The reflection\ncontent is seen to be greater for the\nbetter grades ; i.e., prime is richer in\nreflections than the other grades, am..\nthe reflection content of standard is\npoorer than the other grades .\nThe area studied was about 1 inch\n(2 .54 cm) below the surface of the\nsteak.

They\nare accurate if their reference junctions are held at a constant known temperature. When many reference junctions are mounted in an oven for stable\ntemperature control, temperature gradients in the oven or among the junctions may require special heating arrangements or special calibration\nmeasures.\nTo prevent non uniformity in junction\ntemperature, a compact, lightweight.\nmultijunction oven has been designed\nwith a symmetry of geometry, heating ,\nand thermocouple-junction location\n(see figure). The oven has a cylindrical\nwall made of a material that is a good\nthermal conductor, such as brass. Inside the cylinder is a cylindrical heating\ncoil, wound on a spool that is also made\nof brass. The end cap that closes the\ncylinder extends into the spool, with a\ntemperature-sensing element (shown\nhere as a control thermocouple). The\nsensor controls the power supplied to\nthe heating coils so as to maintain the\ncylinder wall at a constant temperature.\nNumerous holes are bored radially\ninto the cylinder wall , and the thermocouple junctions are inserted in these\nholes.

This system measures the\nsteady and vibratory forces generated\nby the rotor and isolates the transmission from the airframe so that rotor\nvibrations are substantially reduced.\nPreviously the transmission was isolated from the airframe either by\nsprings or by force-opposing devices\nthat create a displacement node at the\nmounting pOints. The force-opposing\ndevices are effective for only one\nfrequency of vibration; and since\nneither method includes measurement\nof the vibration forces from the rotor,\nstrain gages would have to be installed\nfor that purpose.\nWith the new mounting, the transmission is isolated over a range of\nfrequencies allowing the testing of a\nvariety of rotor configurations, and the\nrotor forces are measured at points\nwhere servocontrolled hydropneumatic units attach the gearbox to the\nairframe (see figure). The units have a\nfrequency-dependent load / displacement relationship that gives a statically rigid but dynamically soft support, lowering the vibration transferred\nto the helicopter. The units are the\nprimary load path between the rotor\nand the airframe; thus the loads\napplied to the airframe by the rotor are\ndetermined by measuring the loads in\nthe units .\nThe unit is "active " in that hydraulic\nfluid can be supplied under pressure to\nthe regions above or below the piston\nin the cylinder through the use of the\nservo. If the piston moves up, the\nlever arm activates the servo and lets\noil into the top region and lets oil out of\nthe lower region . High-pressure fluid\nis pumped into the top of the cylinder\nuntil the piston is recentered - hence\nthe static rigidity of the mounting . At\nfrequencies above about 2 Hz , however, too little fluid can be pumped in\nto change loads, so the air in the air\nreservoirs acts as a simple pneumatic\nspring - hence the dynamic softness.\nLoad is measured simply by meas-\n\n468\n\nMECHANICAL\nFEEDBACK\nDISPLACEMENT\nSERVO\n\nAIR\n\nRETURN\n\n-\n\nAIR\n\nSUPPLY\nPRESSURE\n\nF\nISOLATOR DETAil\n\nFour Vibration Isolators restrain the transmission support frame against In-plane\nmotion.

The\nbulk Impurity concentration is determined before and after annealing by\nmeasuring the recombination lifetime.\nThe method can be used to evaluate\nwafer-cleaning techniques, to qualify\n(continued on next page)\n471\n\nthe purity of chemicals and deionized\nwater used in these techniques , or to\nmonitor a production process.\nIn tests to evaluate cleaning procedures, specimens are cut from highresistivity silicon . Contacts are applied , and the surface is etched to\ncontrol the surface recombination\nvelocity . The initial recombination\nlifetime is measured by photoconductivity decay, using the standard\nlaser-excited apparatus shown in the\nfigure .\nNext, the contacts are removed,\nand the wafer surface is cleaned by\nthe technique to be evaluated .

The\nforces applied by the biaxial method\nare one-half the magnitude required by\nthe uniaxial method, reducing the transmitted force and consequently reducing pin deformations.\nIn the biaxial method, shown in Figure 1, a square sandwich specimen is\ninstalled in a very stiff fixture with\npinned corners . Equal tensile and compressive forces are applied along the\nframe diagonals through the corner\npins. The frame deformation, depicted\n\n472\n\nin Figure 2b, creates a parallelogram\nwith sides that are straight and unchanged in length. With the conventional, uniaxial method of loading, the sides\nare extended and bent, as shown in\nFigure 2a.\nThe deformation caused by the biaxial method is that required to subject\nthe test specimen to a uniform shear\nstrain. For orthotropic or isotropic materials, this is equivalent to subjecting\nthe material to a uniform shear stress.\nThe tensile load is applied vertically\nby a standard tensile-test machine, and\nthe compressive load is applied horizontally by a hydraulic cylinder, load\ncell, and tension bar.

Output from both load cells is\nrecorded electronically. A test machine\nwith biaxial load capability (tension and\ncompression) could also be used.\nTo quantify the difference between\nuniaxial and biaxial loading, four identical aluminum-faced sandwich specimens with aluminum honeycomb core\nwere fabricated and instrumented with\nstrain gages. Three of the specimens\nwere tested uniaxially to failure . The\nfourth was initially tested uniaxially in\nthe elastic range and then tested biaxially to failure. Results of these tests are\nshown in Figure 3, where the average\nvalue of the principal tensile-te-compressive strain ratio Ifthcl over the\nspecimen face is plotted as a function\nof total applied load.\nA specimen subjected to a uniform\nshearing deformation will exhibit equal\nprincipal tensile and compressive\nstrains, yielding a strain ratio of 1. The\nthree uniaxially tested specimens (date\nin shaded area) did not exhibit a uniform shear deformation, either in the\nelastic or inelastic range. The fourth\nspecimen (data denoted by squares)\nshowed similar behavior when tested\nuniaxially in the elastic range. However,\nwhen tested biaxially to failure, a uniform shearing deformation was\nachieved in both the elastic and inelastic regions (circles along Iftlfcl = 1).\nIn addition, tests showed that frictional effects in the shear frame and\nloading apparatus had a negligible effect on the experimental results.

Conventional turbine plants\nwork in a batch mode and operate at\n40 percent efficiency.\nThe compressor would utilize a reversible metal hydride reaction to supply hydrogen that would serve as the\nworking fluid. The hydrogen gas would\nbe compressed by cyclic absorption/\ndesorption in a metal hydride matrix\nembedded on a rotating drum (see figure). The absorption process would release heat, and the desorption process\nwould absorb low-grade heat.\nTwo thermal inputs could be used to\noperate the hydride compressor: a lowtemperature input (T ::: 100\xc2\xb0 C), supplied by low-grade solar, geothermal,\nor waste heat; and a cold low-pressure\ngas input. For a continuous-acting heat\npump that would replace a batch process, fixed locations for the heat would\nbe maintained, and the absorbent material would be moved on a drum from\none temperature region to the other\nand back. The compressed hot gas\nfrom the continuous-acting temperature-differential absorption/desorption\n\nLOW\xc2\xb7GRADE\nHEAT INPUT\nRUBBER\nSTRIP\n\nHOT HIGH\xc2\xb7\nPRESSURE GAS\n\n1/\n\nCOLD LOW\xc2\xb7\nPRESSURE GAS\n\nProposed Absorptlon/ Desorption\nCompressor would use a metal hydride\n\nmatrix on the outer surface of a rotating\ndrum to generate the working gas,\nhydrogen. The rolling valve seals would\nallow the compressor to work continuously. During operation, the gas would be\nabsorbed to release heat and desorbed by\nabsorbing low-grade heat.\ngas pump could then go to the turbine\nplant. The rotating drum, being in compreSSion, need not be thick and thus\nwould allow good heat exchange between its inner and outer surfaces.\n\nMetal hydrides are not the only substances that can be used on the rotating drum. Any reactant of the form:\nsolid\n\n~\n\nsolid\n\n+ gas\n\ncan be used. The choice of the reaction would be based on the speed of\nabsorption/desorption in the desired\ntemperature range and on the effectiveness of the roll seal used outside of\nthe drum.\nSome materials would not seal well.\nA gas leak would be tolerable but\nwould reduce efficiency. A possible\nsealing alternative would be to have\nthe roller in the form of a toothed star,\nas shown, that meshes with rubber\nseal strips on the drum. The active material on the drum would then be between the rubber strips.\nThe proposed concept promises to\nconserve nuclear and fossil fuels and\nto reduce powerplant capital and operating costs. When low-grade heat\nsources become abundant, existing\ngas-turbine powerplants can be modified to accommodate this process and\nthus increase the output by a factor of\n20r more.\nThis work was done by Charles G.\nMiller of Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The instrument includes a\ntracking mechanism so that one of the\nset of four solar cells always faces the\n\n474\n\nSun, while another set faces the four\nquarters of the sky. On an overcast\nday, the cloud-irradiance sensors\ngenerate as much short-circuit current\nas the sun-sensor cells do. As the\ncloud cover decreases, so does the\noutput of the cloud sensors.\n\nThe instrument is just past the concept stage, with preliminary data indicating that the basic prinCiple is\nsound; however, development still has\nto be done. Such factors as the effects\nof cloud reflection into the Sun sensors\nand erroneous readings caused by\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nSOLARIRRADIANCE\nSENSORS\nHORIZONTAL\nVIEW SHIELDS\n\nVERTICAL\nVIEW SHIELD\n\nCLOUD-IRRADIANCE\nSENSORS\n\nsmall clouds blocking the Sun remain to\nbe evaluated. Nonetheless, the sensor\nshows promise as a simple, inexpensive monitor of cloud cover.\nThe cloud-cover monitor is shown in\nthe figure. Its base is a truncated foursided pyramid, with a polar mount that\nrotates at 15 0 per hour to track the Sun\nacross the sky. Thus the Sun-sensing\nsolar cells on top of the truncated pyramid always face directly toward the\nSun.\nThe four sides of the pyramid are at\nan angle of approximately 60 0 to the\ncentral axis of the pyramid. Each side\nsupports one square silicon photovoltaic cell, with the electrical output of\neach cell connected in series. These\ncloud-irradiance sensors are loaded so\nthat 100 mW I cm 2 (normal incidence)\nproduce an output of 25 mV on each\ncell. The solar-irradiance sensor, on\ntop of the truncated pyramid, consists\nof four smaller, square solar cells,\nalso connected In series and also\nloaded so that 100 mW/cm 2 produce\nan output of 25 mV on each cell. Cloud\ncover is obtained by dividing the total\n\nseries voltage obtained from the\ncloud-irradiance cells by the total\nseries voltage obtained from the\nsolar-irradiance cells .\nView-limiting shields separate the\nfields of view of the two sets of solar\ncells. The nearly vertical limiters shield\nthe solar-irradiance sensors from infrared radiation reflected by the clouds,\nwhile the horizontal limiters shield the\ncloud-irradiance sensors from direct or\nreflected solar irradiance. Horizontal\nlimiters may aiso be needed near the\nbottom edges of the cloud-irradiance\nsensors to shield them from energy\nreflected from the ground.\nThis work was done by Eric G.

The reflecting coating can\nbe either silver or aluminum, and the\nblack coating can be either gold black\nor platinum black. The spectral range of\nthe radiation detected depends only on\nthe absorptivity of the black coating .\nThe infrared light passes through a\nshutter, which chops the light into\npulses. The light strikes the black coating on the plastic sheet, where it is absorbed and transmitted to the plastic\n(see figure). Each pulse thus creates a\ntransient region of hot material with an\naltered index of refraction in the plastic\nmicrovolume.\n\nA beam of laser light is directed into\nthe sensing material from a direction\nopposite to that of the infrared light. The\nlaser beam is reflected by the metal\ncoating under the black infrared-absorptive coating and is directed by a\nbeam splitter into a detector.\nThe hot transient region generated\nby an infrared pulse acts as a lens that\ndefocuses the laser beam . The defocusing increases as the infrared\nintensity increases . Thus the detector\nmonitors a probe beam that weakens\nas the infrared light becomes more\n(continued on next page)\n475\n\nintense . The detector could be a point\ndetector such as a photomultiplier or\nan area detector such as a vidicon or a\ncharge-coupled device. For the area\ndetector, a two-dimensional profile of\nthe IR beam is imaged . It is possible to\npack a 20by20 matrix within a 1-cm2\narea detector.\nBecause the black absorbent layer\non the sensing material absorbs equally\nwell over a wide range of wavelengths,\nthe infrared meter is sensitive over a\nbroad band. Electrical noise is virtually\neliminated because the sensor is nonelectronic, except for the last stage.\nNoise is also reduced because the infrared light is chopped and its transient\nrather than steady-state effects are\nmeasured.\nThe responsivity of the tested\ndetector - the volts produced per unit\nflux is 2x10 9 V /W / cm 2 for a\ndetector 0 .1 mm on a side .

Inside is a\nstainless-steel arterial or spiral-groove\nwick . Sodium or other liquid metal is\nthe working fluid .\nThe cooling jacket transfers heat\nisothermally to an area of lower\ntemperature where it is rejected by\nconventional methods, such as radiation and/or free convection. Heat is\nabsorbed by the evaporation of the\nworking fluid In the portion of the\nprobe that is in the high-temperature\nenvi ronment. The heated vapor flows\nto the finned condenser where it\ncondenses and rejects heat. From\nthere , the liquid condensate flows\nback to the evaporator region by the\naction of gravity and by the capillary\naction of the wick .\nThe system is self-contained, passive , and has no moving parts, unlike\nconventional air- and water-cooled\nprobes . An alternate wick configuration consists of narrow spiral grooves\nrunning the length of the internal\nsurface of the pipe .

The heat-\n\npipe sandwich panel concept retains\nthis feature, yet it can also operate as\na thermal diode . The sandwich is an\ninsulating barrier when the heat pipes\nare not operating, and it is a thermally\nconducting panel that transfers heat\nefficiently from one face to the other\nwhen the heat pipes are operating .\nThe panel consists of a metallic\nhoneycomb core , two facesheets, and\na working fluid .

A linear approximation to a nonlinear system can be obtained at a selected operating point and used for\nsmall excursions about that point. For\nan aircraft turbine engine, a typical o~\nerating pOint would be a particular equilibrium condition of power setting and\nflight condition .\nFor a system as complex as an aircraft engine, the linear description\nusually consists of a number of coupled\nlinear algebraic and differential equations.

At an operating\npoint, the linear model is fully described\nby the set of matrices, commonly designated as: a system matrix A, a control\nmatrix B, an output matrix C, and a\nfeed-forward matrix D.

The designer is\nseldom required to create a structure\nthat will only serve its primary function .\nInstead, the design is usually expected\nto meet such objectives as minimum\nweight and cost.\nThe DESAP1 program synthesizes\nlinear elastio structures under static\nloads. Its design objective is to find the\nelement sizes that minimize the total\nweight without changing the layout of\nthe structure. The primary constraints\nin the synthesis algorithm are upper\nlimits on stresses and displacements.\nThese stress limits are prescribed as\nyield criteria and local instability criteria. DESAP1 also allows secondary\nconstraints consisting of minimum allowable element sizes and size-proportion constraints.\nAn iterative process is used in the\nsynthesis, with each iterative step conSisting of three parts: First, the current\nstructure is analyzed. Next, the results\nof that analysis are evaluated in terms\nof structure optimization. Finally, the\n\nresults of the evaluation are used to redesign the structure.\nThe classical stress-ratio method is\nemployed in the redesign with respect\nto stress constraints. This procedure\ndrives the final design to the fully\nstressed design, which may not coincide with the design having minimum\nweight. For the displacement constraints, the redesign formula is ot>tained from the minimum-weight criterion with element sizes being driven\ntoward a design having optimal weight.\nIn the presence of both stress and displacement constraints, each iterative\nredesign operation first determines the\nelement sizes from the stress-ratio\nmethod. These results are then used as\nminimum-size constraints during the\napplication of the displacement-constrained redesign formulas. The result\nof the synthesis is a minimum-weight\nstructure adhering to the prescribed\nconstraints.\nInputs to DESAP1 consist of an\ninitial finite-element model of the\nstructure and a set of constraints.\nBasic structural elements available in\nDESAP1 include three-dimensional\nbars, three-dimensional beams, quadrilateral shear panels, anisotropic\nplane-stress quadrilaterals and triangles, and anisotropic quadrilateral\nand triangular plates .\nA set of boundary elements is included to represent elastic supports\nand to apply constraints. The design\nprocedure assumes that the loading is\nindependent of element sizes. Allowances have been made for such sizedependent loads as thermal stresses\nand gravity loading. Outputs from\nDESAP1 consist of a redesign history,\nthe final structural weight, and the redesigned element sizes .\nThe DESAP1 program is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on an IBM 360\ncomputer with a central memory requirement of approximately 300K of\n8-bit bytes.

The minimum configuration includes half a megabyte of\ncentral memory and 50 megabytes of\ndisk space. A recommended configuration incldes 4 megabytes of central\nmemory, two 256-megabyte disk\ndrives, two 1 ,600-bpi tape drives, and\nthe optional floating-point accelerator.\nDeveloped in the mid-1960\'s,\nNASTRAN is a general-purpose finiteelement computer program for structural analysis. Besides being efficient,\nversatile, and convenient to use,\nNASTRAN can be modified easily and\nexpanded to accommodate new problems and new computer cQJ1figurations\nwithout major redevelopment.\nApplications of NASTRAN extend to\nalmost every type of linear structure\nand construction. Structural elements\nprovide for the specific representation\nof the more-common types of construction, including rods , beams,\nshear panels, plates, and shells of\nrevolution. More general structures\nare analyzed by using combinations of\nthese elements and by the use of\n"general" elements. Control systems,\naerodynamic transfer functions , and\nother nonstructural features can be\nincorporated by the engineer into the\nstructural analysis problem . A complex structure can be represented as a\nset of substructures to decrease\nprocessing time . NASTRAN includes\nplotting interforces that permit the\ndisplay of structure and substructures\nwith or without deformations.\n. The range of analysis that can be\nperformed using NASTRAN includes :\nstatic response to concentrated or\ndistributed loads , thermal expansion,\nand enforced deformation ; dynamic\nresponse to transient loads , steadystate sinusoidal loads, and random\nexcitation ; the determination of real\nand complex eigenvalues for use in\nvibration analysis ; dynamic stability\nanalysis; and elastic stability analysis.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nThe program also includes a limited\ncapability for the solution of nonlinear\nproblems , including piecewise linear\nanalysis of nonlinear static response\nand transient analysis of nonlinear\ndynamic response .\nNASTRAN has been specifically\ndesigned to treat and solve efficiently\nlarge problems with many degrees of\nfreedom. The only limitations on\nproblem size are those imposed by the\npractical considerations of computer\nrun time and by the ultimate capacity\nof auxiliary storage devices . To reduce\nthe central memory requirements on\nthe VAX computer, NASTRAN is\norganized into 16 sections called links.\nOne of these links is a control program\nthat pulls the other links into core only\nas they are needed . This structure\nallows NASTRAN to offer the user a\nlarge selection of capabilities while\nrequiring only a moderate amount of\ncore resources .\nTwo new NASTRAN features are\navailable in the VAX version . The\nprogram can be executed from a\nterminal in a manner that permits use\nof the VAX interactive debugger , and\nany link can be interactively restarted\nas often as desired by making a copy\nof all NASTRAN work files before\nexecuting that link for the first time .\nThis program was written by Lloyd\nPurves of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

The\nprinted output, containing the coordinates, slopes, curvatures, and other\nfeatures of the entire nozzle surface, is\nplaced in a disk file. An initial screening\nof candidate nozzles can be made\nfrom the printout from this stage of the\ncomputation .\nUsing the results of SCIRCL as input,\nplus desired pOints of output, 24Y\ngenerates simple two-dimensional\nbasic potential-flow solutions for both\non-body and off-body points. The\nvelocity fields are placed on disk files\nfor use as input to NOZZLEC. Since a\nfull three-dimensional nozzle analysis\ndoes not now exist, the simpler but\nmore approximate methods of 24 Y\nwere developed to analyze real nozzles.\nEven though actual nozzles are threedimensional , there are sections of the\nnozzles for which a two-dimensional\nanalysis is an informative approximation .\nThe final routine, NOZZLEC, combines the basic solutions from 24Y into\nsolutions of interest having specified\nvalues of nozzle mass flow and, if\ndesired, free-stream velocity and angle\nof attack. NOZZLEC output includes\nvelocities, pressures, flow angles, and\nmach numbers. If desired, compressibility corrections are also applied .\nThe program group is written in\nFORTRAN V and has been implemented\non a UNIVAC 1100/42 . It requires a\nmemory having approximately 52K of\n36-bit bytes. The program was completed in 1979.\nThis program was written by J.\nDennis Hawk and Norbert 0. Stockman\nof Lewis Research Center.

Boundary-layer\ntheory can be applied to the flow about\nan airfoil in two ways . First, the\n\n481\n\nboundary-layer development can be\ndetermined for a given potential-flow\nvelocity distribution. This is the di rect ,\nor analysis, problem . Second , the\npotential-flow field, or at least some of\nits properties , can be determined for a\ngiven boundary-layer development.\nThis is the inverse , or design,\nproblem. Soth the direct and inverse\nproblems are solved by the program\nPROFILE.\nA conformal-mapping method for\nthe design of airfoils with prescribed\nvelocity-distribution characteristics, a\npanel method for the analysis of the\npotential flow about given airfoils, and\na boundary-layer method are combined in the PROFILE program. The\nconformal-mapping method, similar to\nthat of Lighthill, solves most multipoint\ndesign problems very simply. The\npotential-flow analysis method is required for comparison with windtunnel tests of given airfoils and for\nanalyses of airfoils generated by the\ndesign method and then modified by a\nflap deflection .

It can reduce the design cost\nand improve the performance of\nhigh-speed aircraft.\nThe transonic flow field is characterized by mixed subsonic and supersonic regions, shock waves, and\ncomplicated viscous effects . The\ncomplexity of such flow often makes a\npurely experimental approach impractical for solving aircraft design problems in this regime . WISCO obtains a\nnumerical finite-difference solution of\na modified (extended) smaIl-disturbance flow equation on a multiple\nembedded mesh system . This approach gives high computational resolution and coordinate-system flexibility\nfor treating complex realistic aircraft\nshapes .\nThe WISCO flow equation is a\nmodified extension of the classical\ntransonic small-disturbance equation.\nThis modification includes crossflow\nterms for resolving shock waves with\nlarge sweep angles . The computational space used in solving the flow\nequation is divided into a global crude\ngrid and embedded fine grids about\nthe wing and body where the gradients\nare large and the details are important.\nThe simplicity of the approximate\nflow equation and planar boundary\nconditions permit the use of Cartesian\ncoordinates for all grids . The resulting\n\nnumerical efficiency permits a very\ndense computational mesh, a benefit\nIn both the resolution of shock waves\nand the calculation of configuration\nforces and moments . The embedded\nmeshes are independent and optimized for a particular geometric\ncomponent, facilitating applications to\ncomplex configurations. The flow-field\nequation is of mixed type for supercritical flow and is solved using a\ntype-dependent finite-difference approximation with planar boundary\nconditions. A successive-line overrelaxation method is used where\nvertical columns of mesh points are\nrelaxed starting at the first line (plane)\nupstream and ending at the last line\n(plane) downstream in each grid\nsystem.\nInputs to WISCO consist of ambient\nflow conditions and geometric configuration data, the grid control and\nrelaxation parameters are internally\nset .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nCompressed air is used in industrial\nplants, shops, and laboratories for operating production equipment, spraying\npaint and lubricants, cleaning, drying,\nand moving liquids. It is also used for\nactivating valves in high-pressure systems and for pressurizing refrigeration\nsystems.\nA new portable pneumatic supply\nthat is analogous to the electric-power\nsupplies used throughout industry simplifies these operations. It connects to\na standard hi~h-pressure air line (120\npsi, or 8.3X10 N/m2) and has two or\nmore outputs at pressures that can be\nadjusted from 20 to 100 psi (1.4X1 05 to\n6.9X10 5 N/m 2).\nA portable pneumatic supply with\ntwo adjustable outputs is shown in the\nfigure.

(15 cm) in\ndiameter, 15 in . (37 .5 cm) deep, to\nextract oil trapped in the adjacent\nstrata . A common drive mechanism\nturns several penetrators at once to\ncut multiple holes simultaneously. The\npenetrators are more efficient than the\nmore-commonly-used armor-piercing\nbullets and shaped explosive charges ,\nnone of which pierces the sidewalls as\ndeeply.\nEach penetrator drill bit is turned by\na flexible shaft. The shaft, made from\na spiraling cable , rotates and thrusts\nsimultaneously through a rigid curvilinear guide tube forcing the bit\nthrough the well casing and Into the\nstrata .\nThe shaft is driven by a series of\ninterlocking thrust segments confined\nin the tube and connected to a drive\nmotor at the mouth of the well . Each\nsegment contains a rotatable hollow\nsleeve that interlocks with the next\none . Drilling fluid feeding through\nthese sleeves flows through ports in\nthe drill bit to cool and lubricate the\ncutting teeth and to flush chips and\ndebris from the drilled hole . When the\ndrill is retracted , the sleeves disconnect.\nPower is applied to the thrust\nsegments via a feeding mechanism\ncoupled to the drive motor .

Each master cylinder controls diagonally opposing sets of wheels . If one braking\nsystem fails, the other stops the car by\nbraking the two wheels it controls.\nEach master cylinder applies braking power to all four wheels in an\nimproved dual-braking system. Thus,\neven if one system fails because of the\nloss of fluid, the other stops the car by\nbraking all four wheels.\n/!..s shown in the figure , opposing\nbrake cylinders at each wheel are\nconnected by holes drilled through a\nblock. Each pair of opposing brake\ncylinders is connected hydraulically to\none of the master cylinders. The mechanism consists of two sets of rightangle links pinned together. The brakeshoes are pinned to the right-angle\ncorners of the links. Standard automotive design techniques are used to\nplace the studs that lock the shoes\nagainst rotation . Compression springs\nreturn the mechanism and brakeshoes\nto their neutral positions.\nWith both systems operating, all four\nbrakeshoes are forced outward\nagainst the drum. If one system fails,\nthe mechanism still forces all four\nshoes against the drum, although at\nhalf the force. Nevertheless, all shoes\noperate in all four wheels whether one\nor both brake systems are operational.\nThis work was done by Howard B.\nEdwards of Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available.\nLAR-12687\n\nBRAKE\nCYLINDER\n(10F4)\n\nSECTION A\xc2\xb7A\nOpposing Brake Cylinders are connected to each other by a hole drilled through the\n\nblock.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn a hydraulic actuator, a rod is thrust\nout from a cylinder or is retracted into\nthe cylinder. As long as hydraulic pressure is maintained, the actuator holds\nthe rod at the desired extension. When\npower Is removed, however, the rod\ncan move under the load.\nA pair of clamps developed for hydraulic actuators on the Space Shuttle\nengines prevents the unwanted movement. The clamps are fastened to the\nrod and cylinder and are then locked together with bolts. Besides preventing\nthe travel of deenergized actuators, the\nclamps might also serve as a temporary rigid link in a hydraulic system under repair.\nA prototype of the locking device is\nshown in the figure. Both the rod and\ncylinder are threaded. Each clamp consists of two threaded halves that are assembled around the rod and cylinder\nthreads . The two clamps are then fastened together by bolts that prevent\nboth retraction and extension of the\nrod. An important feature of the mechanism is that the spacing between the\nclamps is adjustable through use of the\nbolts. Thus the actuator can be locked\nat any rod extension.\nThe clamps can lock an actuator to\nbe used as a mechanical support or\nlinkage - for example , to support a\nplatform . The mechanism may also be\nuseful as a fail-safe device in case of\nloss of hydraulic pressure . Potential\napplications include manufacturing\nprocesses and specialized handling\nand holding devices .\nThis work was done by Robert H.\nWood of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Johnson Space Center.

The new arresting line, in\ncontrast, absorbs energy at a nearly\nconstant rate , reducing the maximum\narresting load and minimizing rebounding. Possible applications cf the wirecable arrester include passenger restra int in air and land vehicles, parachute risers, and ground snatch by\naircraft.\nThe new energy arrester (see\nFigure 1) consists of a wire cable\nsurrounded by a tubular braided\nsheath of polyester cloth that is longer\nthan the cable. To arrest the moving\nbody, the wire cable elongates to\napproximately 90 percent of its potential while absorbing all the energy of\nmotion . To be efficient , the cable\nelongates to near its breaking pOint.\nShould it break prematurely, the\nbraided sheath absorbs the remaining\nenergy.\nOne possible cable material is type\n302 stainless steel , which when properly annealed elongates by as much as\n40 percent with only a 50-percent loss\nin strength. The wire cable is routed\nthrough the longer tubular suspension\nline to prevent chafing against adjacent structures during elongation and\nto prevent a catastrophic failure should\nthe wire cable break. Figure 2\ncompares the maximum shock loads\nimparted to the arrested body by the\nelongating cable and by typical elastic\narresters, for equivalent energy absorption .\nThis work was done by Reid A.

It could\nbe used to contain not only the debris\nproduced by explosive-nut detonations\nbut also that from safety tests.\nThe material for the bag is woven\naramid (a multifilament polyamide)\nfabric.

Accurate\nassessment of geometry-induced roller\npreload is possible for various outerring and housing configurations. The\nanalysis considers a flexible outer ring\nand housing and treats cases where\nthe outer-ring outer surface is not in\ncontact with the housing around its\nentire perimeter. This would be the\ncase when a two- or three-point out-ofround ring is pressed into a circular\nmounting hole in the housing.\nCYBEAN is structured for the coordinated execution of modules that perform specific analytic tasks. It initiates\na computation with geometry, lubricant,\nand material definitions. To economize\non computation, constants are evalu-\n\nated in structure locations external to\niterative calculations .\nA repetitive loop is used that addresses the computation of geometry\nfits. Arbitrary housing and outer-ring\nprofile interactions are considered .\nRolling-element load distribution is obtained for the mode of bearing preload\ndefined by the user. Interference-fit\neffects, including rotation, temperature,\nand roller-load-induced ring displacements, are evaluated and used to\ncompute the operating diametral clearance. The field-equation set is evaluated\nfor the bearing, which can contain up\nto 50 rollers . The set of values for the\nindependent variables that satisfies all\n(continued on next page)\n\n491\n\n0\n\nthe equations of equilibrium simultaneously is considered to be a solution .\nAn accurate initial guess of the\nvariable values can save considerable\nexecution time. However, the nonlinear\ncoupling of the large set of unknowns\nwithin a typical physical system makes\nit difficult to guess accurately. This\nproblem is overcome by first solving\nthe simpler elastic case. The set of\nvariables that satisfy the equilibrium of\nelastic forces is then used as an initial\nguess for the more complicated solution, which includes friction . This initial\nelastic solution is also used to determine the equilibrium load distribution\nthat defines housing-fit pressures.\nThe general field-equation set is\npartitioned before it is solved. Independent variables describing the inner-ring\nposition and roller radial position are\n\n492\n\naddressed in conjunction with field\nequations governing ring and roller\nradial equilibrium . Equation cross\ncoupling is established through the\nroller radial position. This subset is\nbrought to equilibrium by NewtonRaphson iteration.\nOnce inner-ring equilibrium is satisfied, the field-equation set is again\npartitioned to include roller axial, radial,\nskew, and tilt moment equations of\nequilibrium . Coupling is maintained\nthrough the associated displacement\nvariables. At this portion of the analysis,\nroller end-flange contact forces are\nequilibrated with raceway-induced\nloading.\nA final partition is made such that\nthe field equations defining force equilibrium in the direction tangent to the\npitch circle, moments about the roller\n\naxis, and radial cage equilibrium are\nconsidered . Associated variables are:\nradial position, rotational and orbital\nspeeds, and cage displacements. The\nset of values of independent variables\nthat simultaneously satisfy these equations is considered a solution.\nSatisfactory convergence of the iterative procedure allows the definition of\nresults of a specific temperature. The\nremaining program structure addresses\nthe computation of steady state and\nthe time-transient system thermal performance .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nV for use on the UNIVAC 1100/40\ncomputer .\nThis program was written by R.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe technique selected for strengthening the Space Shuttle surfacetilelsubstrate bond could be applied to\nsimilar ceramic-tHe-attachment prot>lems in other applications. The "densiflcation" process strengthens the surface where the tile attaches to a\nfelt strain-Isolator pad, redistributing\nstresses and preventing failures at that\npoint. Those Interested In the technology of bonding delicate ceramics to nonrigid materials should also consider the\nShuttle backup tile-strengthening technique, described in the following\narticle, "Tile Denslficatlon With\nTEOS" (MSC-18737).\nThe reusable surface-insulation tiles\nthat protect the orbiter from repeated\nhigh-temperature plunges through the\natmosphere are susceptible to failure\nwhere they are bonded to felt pads\nthat separate them from the Shuttle\nframe . In densification, a binder\nmixture impregnates the bottom of the\nfibrous ceramic tiles to form a\nhigh-strength skin . The platelike layer\nmore than doubles the strength of the\ntile-to-felt-pad bond. In tests, tiles that\nwere densified did not fracture until\nthey were stressed to the limit of the\nbulk material (see figure). Undensified\ntiles, in comparison, fractured at the\nbond interface and at much lower\nstresses .\nThe process uses an aqueous mixture of colloidal silica as a cement and\nbali-milled silica particles, which - like\nsand in concrete - act as a reinforcement. Brushing forces the mixture into\nthe Interstices of the tile. The depth of\n\nOen,lfled and Unden\'lfled Tile, fall at different locations and at ~Ifferent stresses. The\n\nundenslfled specimen (left) failed at about 11 psi (7.5 x 104 N/m ) at Its Interface with\nthe stre~s.lsol~tlon pad. The denslfled tile (right) failed at a much higher stress, 23 psi\n(1.6 x 10 N/m), and the break occurred In the bulk material.\n\ndensification is 0.06 to 0.11 inch (1 .5 to\n2.8 mm), depending on the original tile\ndensity. The outer 0.035 inch (0.9 mm)\nof densified tile are three to six times as\nstrong as the bulk material. The densified layer is still porous and allows volatile materials to escape as the Shuttle\nheats up in the atmosphere.\nThe first step in densification is an\napplication of isopropyl alcohol to the\nbottom (unglazed) surface of the tile.\nThe alcohol allows the densifying\nagents to wet and penetrate the\nwater-repellent treatment on the tile.\nThe slurry of colloidal silica and silica\npowder, with a small amount of\npigment added, is painted on the tile .\nThe pigment, an inert ceramic (tetraboron silicide), makes the slurry\neasier to see and aids in an even\napplication.\n\nAfter air-drying for 24 hours and\noven-drying at 150 0 F (66 0 C) for 2\nhours, the tile is weighed to determine\nthe amount of material that has been\nadded. Usually the amount is about\n0.5 glin. 2 (0.078 g/cm 2 ) of surface\narea. Finally , the tile is rewaterproofed by exposure to vapors or\nmethyltrimethoxysilane and acetic\nacid (a catalyst) at 350 0 F (1 .77 0 C).\nThe tile is then ready for installation.\nThis work was done by Robert L.\nDotts of Johnson Space Center and\nJack W.

When applied to the tHe surface,\nTEOS is absorbed and deposits a\nrelatively pure form of silica within the\n\ntile . The thermal expansion of the\ndeposit matches that of the tile\nclosely; and the surface tension of\nTEOS liquid is low enough that it\n(continued on next page)\n495\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nreadily penetrates into the tile, even if\nthe tile has been waterproofed. A\nTEOS-densified layer in the tile, about\n0.2 inch (0.5 cm) deep with a\nminimum density of 2.5 g/in.3 (0.15\ng/cm 3), strengthens the tile/pad\ncombination to a level consistent with\nthe full strength of the tile alone.\nThe liquid is generally applied and\ncured in three steps, after which the\ntile is allowed to cool and is weighed.\nThe weight increase will usually\naverage 0.15 g per square centimeter .\nThe TEOS liquid is prepared by mixing TEOS with 0.05N hydrochloric acid\nin the correct volume ratio. A dye\nadded to the mixture helps to determine when the constituents are fully\n\nmixed; it also makes the TEOS easier\nto see when it is applied to the tile. The\nliquid should be used within 48 hours\nafter preparation .\nThe TEOS liquid can be applied by\nbrush, spray, or any other means that\nwill ensure an even coating . If the area\nto be densified is less than the total\narea of the tile base , the boundary\nmay be marked by a soft pencil (for\nbrush application) or masked (for\nspraying) .\nThe versatility of TEOS gives it a\nwide range of applications . Selected\nareas of tile can be densified to\nprovide stiffer and stronger tile properties; also, a more durable surface is\nprovided for additional coatings. The\n\npenetration of TEOS into a tile can be\nadjusted from full penetration (saturation) to a controlled localized densification. There is no surface buildup\nfrom the use of TEOS; thus, there are\nno dimensional changes when dens ifying.\nThis work was done by Glenn M.\nEcord and Calvin Schomburg of John\xc2\xb7\nson Space Center.

Now\nundergoing laboratory development,\nthe apparatus generates only dense\nsilicon particles (no powder) from\n(SiF2)x polymer feedstock . It shows\npromise as a more economical , higher\nvolume alternative to previous batchprocessing methods .\nThe apparatus , as shown in the\nfigure , includes a fluid-bed vaporizer ,\nconsisting of silicon particles ranging\nfrom 1/2-in . (13-mm) to 5-mesh, with\na (SiF2)x polymer feed , and a SiF4\ninlet. The temperature of the vaporizer\nis maintained between 200 0 and 400 0\nC by controlling the temperature of the\ninlet SiF4 . At these temperatures the\n(SiF2)x is in equilibrium with SixFy\nhomologs that distill out of the\nvaporizer. SixFy exits the vaporizer\nand contacts 5-to-80-mesh silicon in\nheaters at 500 0 to 1,000 0 C in the\nfluidized bed or riser bed . The flow\nrate and diameter of the reactor tube\ndetermine the mode of operation\n(fluidized or riser) . On contacting the\nhot silicon , the SixFy homologs disproportionate Into sificon (which deposits on the hot silicon) and SiF4 .\nThe pure silicon is separated from\nthe SixFy in a cyclone separator, and\nthe SiF4 is recycled after cooling to\n250 0 C. Part of the SiF4 is stored , and\nthe balance Is recycled .\nThe addition of SiF4 is regulated in\nthe vaporizer to ensure that the partial\npressure of SixFy in the fluidized bed\nis less than 7 torr . At this low\npressure , no silicon powder forms .\nThe (SiF2)x polymer can be introduced into the duplex vaporizer/\nharvester by several methods. It could\nbe formed in a heat exchanger/condenser and scraped into a displacement pump, which would force-feed\nthe (SiF2)x polymer into the vaporizer.\nAlternatively , the polymer could be\nscraped into a storage hopper and\nthen added to the vaporizer .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1980\n\nSIF4 RECYCLE\n\nSILICON\nHARVESTER\n\nTO STORAGE\n\nREACTOR/\nTUBE\n(RISER\nOPERATION)\n\nFEEO\n\nBLOWER\n\nSemlconductor\xc2\xb7Grade Silicon Chunks, roughly 1 cm in diameter, are produced\ncontinuously in a process based on the vaporization of feedstock, chemical vapor\ndeposition In a fluidized bed , the extraction of silicon chunks , and the recycling of\n\nSiF4.\n\nThe product fluidized-bed particles\nare approximately 0.03 to 0.5 cm in\ndiameter; and the harvested chunks ,\nextracted in a cyclone separator, are\nabout 0.5 to 1.3 cm in diameter.

Part of their time is spent\nlistening to lectures and watching\nvideo-tape demonstrations, but most of\ntheir time is devoted to performing\nstep-by-step procedures under the\nguidance of an instructor.\nTopics covered include:\n- Hand Soldering;\n- Wire and Component-Lead\nPreparation ;\n-Eyelet, Hook, Bifurcated , and TUrret\nTerminal Soldering ;\n-Soldering of Flat and Round\nConductors ;\n-Wire Routing ; and\n-Component Installation.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nIn addition to learning how to assemble\nnew circuits, the students learn how to\nrework printed-wiring boards, to replace parts, and to make circuit\nchanges by cutting traces, changing\nwiring, and adding terminals. The students are taught the benefits of using\napproved and calibrated instruments\nand tools and of performing the operations at properly-equipped and grounded work stations, particularly for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor\n(CMOS) integrated circuits .\nThe Instructor demonstrates - and\nthe students practice - the use of\nflux; cleaning before and after SOldering ; joint inspection; soldering-iron\ncare, maintenance, and calibration;\nand wire stripping and forming . The\nprocedures and practices are organized as lesson plans, each plan consisting of step-by-step instructions for a\ncomplete assembly or disassembly operation.\n\nFor example, one lesson plan\ncovers the removal of an integratedcircuit flat pack.

However, the procedure shown In views 3 through 7\nInverts the colis and then returns them to their original position so that the coli gap disappears.\n\nOrdinarily, the split-ring wire coils\nused to tether objects to a cable or\nrope have a wire diameter greater\nthan some minimum determined by\nthe cable diameter. Below this thickness , the elastic limit of the wire will\nbe exceeded when its coils are opened\nwide enough to pass over the cable .\nThe coils then will not snap together\nafter they have passed over the cable ,\nbut will remain expanded, with a gap\nbetween adjacent coils . In this condition, the ring is not a reliable fastener .\n\n500\n\nA simple method of attaching\nsplit-ring coils to cables prevents such\ngaps from forming. The method makes\nit possible to use thinner coils without\ngaps forming and thus saves cost and\nweight. In the method, a ring is\ninverted before it is installed and\nreturned to its original position after it\nis installed .\nThe coil installation is shown in the\nfigure . The installer inverts the ends of\nthe ring with a small pair of pliers,\npulling one end through the ring and\n\nallowing the coils to follow. The coils\nare spread, and the ring slides over\nthe cable . This procedure expands the\ninverted ring, leaving gaps between\nthe coils . Finally, the installer reverses\nthe inversion, pulling one end through\nthe ring so that the coils follow it. The\nring is then in its original orientation,\nand the coils are tightly compressed.\nThis work was done by Richard W.\nGould of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Johnson Space Center.

This passivation layer\nof tungsten allows the use of steel as\nan inexpensive conducting substrate\nfor thin-film solar cells; the tungsten is\ndeposited on top of the steel, and then\nthe solar cell is fabricated on top of the\ntungsten passivation layer (see\nfigure).\nIn the thin-film solar cell, germanium (Ge) is deposited and recrystallized on the substrate. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is then formed by\nchemical vapor deposition over the\ngermanium. Subsequently, a thin\noxide and thin metal film are formed\nover the GaAs layer. A conducting grid\ncontact and a top antireflection\ncoating are added to complete the\nsolar cell.\nAn inexpensive conducting substrate such as steel makes these solar\ncells less expensive . However, without a passivation layer, the substrate\ncan alloy with the germanium or\ndiffuse into the germanium and gallium arsenide .\nThe characteristics desired in a\npassivation layer are :\n- thermal and electrical conduction,\n- low contact resistance with the\nadjacent materials,\n- strong adhesion to the adjacent\nmaterials,\n- low interdiffusion of the substrate and\nGe/GaAs through the passivation\nlayer, and\n- low loss of the passivating material\ninto the adjacent materials.\nBecause Ge bonds , wets, and crystal-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1980\n\nGRID\nCONTACT\nANTIREFLECTION\nCOATING (600 Al\nTHIN trlETAL,\n\n",60 X\n\nOXID~LAYER,\n\n",301\'.\nCHEMICAL\xc2\xb7VAPORDEPOSITED\nGALLIUM ARSENIDE\n\nA Tungsten PassIvation Layer prevents constituents of steel from Interacting with\nthe semiconductor materials In this MOS thin-film solar cell.

The steel was\nfirst plated with a thin nickel coating to\nimprove the bonding of the tungsten\nlayer.\nStudies with various growth temperatures and power levels for the laserbeam recrystallization of the germanium show no evidence of nickel or\niron contamination of the Ge/GaAs .\nAlso, the studies show that the high\nbackground temperatures and longduration laser pulses used to melt and\nrecrystallize the germanium cause\n\nsmall clumps of tungsten to appear in\nthe upper regions of the germanium .\nThe appearance of the tungsten\nclumps, however, is not expected to\naffect the electrical performance of\nthe cells . The clumps could be\nprevented by using lower background\ntemperatures\nand\nhigher-powerdensity, intermittent laser pulses to\nmelt and recrystallize the germanium .\nThis work was done by Richard J.\nStirn and Yea-Chuan M.

Their\ncosts run about 15 percent of the total\nsolar-concentrator costs. The cost,\nhowever, is reduced by constructing a\nparabolic reflector from many flat rectangular mirrors . Each mirror (see\nfigure) is elastically deformed in one\ndimension . Several such mirrors\nplaced adjacent to each other along a\nparabolic curve form an inexpensive\nmirror suitable for solar application .\nEach reflecting facet is elastically\ndeformed in one direction by a pair of\nedge supports so that incident solar\nrays form a short line image. When two\nadjacent facets are positioned at a\nslight tilt with respect to each other,\ntheir line images overlap.

By this principle, many facets can be assembled to\nform a concentrating mirror approximating a parabolic reflector.\nThis Simple , low-cost reflector may\nbe fabricated from commercially available flat stock.

Seal pressure loads between\n500 psig (3.45 X 106 N/m2) and 2,500\npsig (17.23 X 103 N/m2) are applied.\nFabricated from 25 percent glass-filled\nTeflon (or equivalent) material formed\ninto a continuous strip gasket, the seal\ncan be " active " (be opened and\nclosed), or it can be permanent. It is\n502\n\nmade from just one component , requires no encapsulant, and can be\neasily produced with self-locking or\nother features.\nThe seal is made by skiving a thin\ncontinuous strip from the circumference of a disk of the glass-filled\nmaterial. The disk is prepared by\nplaning both surfaces to a smooth,\nparallel finish. When machining the\nstrip, a lathe turns the disk, and the\nlathe crossfeed is adjusted to give the\n\nrequired thickness to the skived strip.\nThe seal is installed in a groove\nmachined into one of the flange surfaces by wrapping successive turns of\nthe strip spirally until the groove is\nfilled . The th ickness of the disk is the\nheight of the seal , part of which\nprotrudes above the groove. Closing\nthe joint compresses the gasket, forming a tight seal. Figure 1 shows two\nconcentric seals, and Figure 2 shows a\ncross section of a self-locking seal.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nThe new strip seal eliminates several design weaknesses of largediameter cryogenic pressure seals.\nSince it is not fabricated to its final\ndiameter by the manufacturer, as are\nconventional gaskets, problems of\nshipping and storage ,are minimized.\nFurthermore, because the seal is so\nsmall before installation, access to its\nlocation can be limited (relative to the\nseal final diameter), eliminating overdesign and unnecessary cost.\nIn contrast to large-diameter segmented seals, the new strip seal does\nnot have radial leak paths. With the\ncontinuous strip, the potential leakpath length between the spiral windings is several times the circumference; thus, the chance for leakage is\nonly a fraction of that of a conventional\nsegmented seal. In addition, the seal\nallows for the relief of thermal stresses, and cracking would not necessarily\ncause the seal to fail.\nA variation of the basic seal has an\nadhesive between the strips, resulting\nin a bonded solid piece of material.\nOther forms are a tubular strip with\nends that allow for pressurization after\nassembly and a thermally controlled\nseal with a heated wire embedded in\nthe strip.

Arc spraying can be\nautomated and integrated with encapsulation, eliminating hand tabbing ,\nimproving reliability, and reducing\ncost.\nIn an arc sprayer, two wi res of the\nmetal being sprayed are fed through\nhollow electrodes. An electric arc\nbetween the wires melts the metal ;\ncompressed air sprays the molten\nmetal toward the surface being\ncoated .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\nAdhesion tests of various metals arc\nsprayed on glass showed that aluminum adheres strongly but that copper\ncan be peeled off. On the other hand,\ncopper solders easily, but aluminum\ndoes not.\nThus, the key to making firmlyadhered solderable tabs is strongly\nbonding aluminum and copper so that\nboth metals can be used . Copper and\naluminum have different thermal expansion properties ; the copper must\nbe sprayed lightly, or the tab will curl\nlike a bimetallic strip and warp. Good\nadhesion is obtained by spraying\ncopper for only 2 to 3 seconds at\nminimum feed rate .\nAfter soldering a tab to the copper,\nadhesion was tested by pulling on the\n\ntab at a 45 0 angle . It took a force of\nabout 0.4 Ib (2N) or more to pull a tab\noff. The tabs did not peel off the glass;\nrather, the glass beneath the tab\nfractured .\nThe excellent adhesion is believed\ndue to a chemical reaction between\nthe glass and the aluminum : Glass is\nprimarily silicon dioxide, and aluminum bonds readily to oxygen .

A persistent problem\nwith this method has been making\nelectrical contact with the back\nsurface of the silicon layer - the\nsurface next to the substrate .\nA new substrate configuration ,\ncontaining narrow grooves, exposes\npart of the back surface so that a\ndopant can be diffused into it and\nelectrical contact can be made without weakening the substrate . When\nthe substrate is coated first with\ncarbon and then with molten silicon ,\nsilicon bridges form, leaving open\nchannels in the grooves (see figure) .\nLiquid silicon containing a high\nconcentration of boron is injected into\nthe grooves. The liquid diffuses p +\ndopant (that is, a large quantity of\nboron ions) into the silicon. The p +-\n\nBACK SURFACE\n\nPolycrystailine-Sillcon Bridges form\nover grooves In a ceramic substrate to\nexpose the back surface of a solar cell.\nThe back surface can be Impregnated\nwith dopants and can be contacted\nelectrically.

Contacts to the front surface\nare made by conventional methods.\nFor best adhesion, the substrate\ngrooves should run perpendicular to\nthe direction in which the liquid-silicon\nlayer is applied.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe weight of insulating blankets is\nreduced 40 percent by interleaving\ngold-metalized films of plastic between\nthe layers of fibrous material. Use of\nthe lighter weight material with the\n" goldized" film in the Space Shuttle orbiter has saved approximately 710\npounds (320 kg) . It should also be useful\nin commercial aircraft to reduce weight\nand increase cargo space.\nPreviously, thermal conductivity was\nreduced in fibrous-batting insulation\nblankets by increasing their density\n(and thus increasing their weight). However, the new insulation design (see\nfigure) reduces density and weight\nwhile maintaining equivalent thermal\nconductivity. Development tests indicate that insulation with a density of 1\nIb/ft3 (17 kg/m 3), plus reflectors of\ngoldized film spaced between the layers of insulation, has a thermal conductivity comparable to that of 2 Iblft3 (34\nkg/m 3) insulation without the films.\nThis work was done by James O.\nCole, Edward O.

The concept requires recirculating liquid nitrogen in a\nthin cooling jacket, but it does away\nwith the evacuated insulating spaces\nnormally required.

Since\nthe design saves weight, it reduces\nfuel consumption (at the expense of increased consumption of liquid nitrogen).\n\nThe proposed design is shown in the\nfigure, where the thickness of the outer\nshell has been exaggerated for clarity.\nThe actual thickness is only about 5\nmils (0.13 mm) or less. The inner shell,\nwhich holds the primary cryogenic\nfluid, is of conventional design.\nThe thin wall of the outer shell is possible because it contains recirculating\nliquid nitrogen at only a slight positive\n(continued on next page)\n\nill\n\n505\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1980\n\ni\n\n- - - - . - - - --\n\nJ\n\nl\n\npressure .

The tower\ngeometry (see figure) causes the air to\naccelerate downward at 1 g.\nDrop towers have long been used to\nmake lead shot. Drops of molten material released at the top of the air-filled\ntower cool and solidify as they fall.\nHowever, aerodynamic drag tends to\ndistort the drops, preventing them from\nassuming the spherical shape that\nwould result from surface tension.\nThe drag-free tower was tested with\nhollow waterdrops. The time of fall was\n0.7 second . Photographs confirm that\nthe drops are more nearly spherical\nand the bubbles within more concentric\nthan when drag is present.\n\nA full-scale drop tower is planned\nfor making spherical fuel capsules for\nthermonuclear fusion reactors . The\ntower must be taller than one with drag\nbecause the spheres continue to accelerate rather than approach a limiting\nvelocity. Thus they fall farther in a given\ntime interval. The spheres also cool\nmore slowly because the surrounding\nair moves with them, lowering the heattransfer rate.\nThis work was done by James M.\nKendall, Jr., of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Heavier doping\nproduces a higher density of larger\nclumps. However, in polycrystals the\nNi precipitates along the grain boundaries without forming large clumps.\nIf the nickel-doped silicon is used for\na solar cell (by the diffusion of a donor\nmaterial into a wafer of the silicon, to\nform a pn junction), the clumps of\nprecipitated Ni degrade the performance of the cell. The larger the size\nof the preCipitate clumps, the more the\n\nconversion efficiency of the cell is\ndegraded. However, a grain boundary\naround the effective area of the cell\nacts as a gettering center for the\nprecipitates and impurities and improves the efficiency.\nThese effects in Ni-doped Si are\ndescribed in a report that is available\non request. Three crystals were grown\n(by the Czochralski method) with successively greater Ni concentration.\nThe first, a single crystal, was doped\nat 5x1 0 14 atoms / cm 3 ; the second,\nalso single, at 4x10 15 atoms/cm 3 ;\nand the third, which was polycrystalline, at 8x10 15 atoms/cm 3 . The\nexamination of wafers cut from the\ncrystals showed that the first had 400\nprecipitation clumps per cm 2, with an\naverage size of 12 j.lm. The second had\n1,500 clumps per cm 2, with an average size of 17 j.lm. However, in wafers\nof the third, the polycrystal, the precipitates were alined along grain boundaries and had an average size of only 5\n14m.\n\nSolar cells were made from wafers\nof each crystal by diffusing phosphorus\ninto the top surface to form an n +\nregion. The qualities of the n + p junctions were determined by measurements of the electrical properties of\nthe cells.\n\nData on open-circuit voltage, shortcircuit current, maximum power, and\nconversion efficiency for the illuminated cells were compared with values\nfor baseline (undoped) cells. The\nefficiencies of the solar cells made\nfrom the Ni-doped SI were lower than\nthose of the baseline cells, with the\nheavier-doped single crystal degraded\nthe most.\nDark forward current versus voltage\nwas also measured for the cells made\nfrom the three different crystals.

NTRAN input\nconsists of either a Place, Route, and\nFold (PRF) or a Place-and-Route-inTwo-Dimensions (PR2D) layout data\ndeck. Output consists of either a Test\nPattern Generator (TPG) or Logic-Simulation (LOGSIM) logic-circuitry data\ndeck.\nNTRAN reduces the workload of the\nintegrated-circuit designer. Instead of\nhaving to build both the cell-net-data\ncircuit description and the logic-gatemodel circuit description, the designer\nneeds only to build the former. Both describe the same circuit, and NTRAN\nacts as a translator. Thus, once the layout cell-net data are developed, they\n\nare translated and used as inputs for\nlogic simulation and test pattern generation.\nNTRAN is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor batch execution and has been\nimplemented on a Xerox Sigma V\ncomputer.

Compression routines available include adaptive differential-pulse-code modulation,\ntwo-dimensional transforms, clustering, vector reduction , and picture\nsegmentation .\nThe classification of image data\ninvolves analyzing the uncompressed\nor compressed image data to produce\ninventories and maps of areas of\nsimilar spectral properties within a\nscene . The classification routines\ninclude a sequential linear technique\nand a maximum-likelihood technique .\nThe choice of the appropriate\nevaluation criteria is quite important in\nevaluating the Image-processing functions.

For the image reconstruction\nprocesses of registration and compression, the expected results are\nusually the original data or some\nselected characteristics of the original\ndata .

FLOWCHARTER is\n"universal" because it produces flow\ncharts and concordances for any program written in any language that can\nbe described according to a defined set\nof rules. Because the generated flow\ncharts are presented in a concise treelike format appropriate for representing\nthe flow of control in a structured program, FLOWCHARTER is termed a\n"structured-deslgn diagramer."\nTo flow-chart a program, the user\nprovides FLOWCHARTER with a description of the programing-language\ngrammar. Three sets of rules are needed: The first is a list of syntax rules in\nBackus-Naur form (BNF). These rewrite\nrules allow FLOWCHARTER to do a bottom-up parse of the input program. The\nnext set is a list of semantic rules, in\none-to-one correspondence with the\nsyntactic rules, which specify how a\nparticular construct is to be diagramed.\nLast is a set of concordance rules,\nagain in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the syntactic rules, which are used\nto isolate positions where identifiers\nmay appear and to classify these identifiers as variables or as procedure\nnames. Preparing this list is not trivial;\n(continued on next page)\n513\n\n@\n\nhowever, the list is only prepared once\nfor each language. (A grammar description for PASCAL is included with\nthe FLOWCHARTER package.)\nOnce the grammar is described, the\nuser supplies only the source code of\nthe program to be diagramed. FLOWCHARTER automatically produces a\nflow diagram and a concordance . The\ndiagram is quite different from traditional flow charts. The structured-design\n\n514\n\ndiagram represents the main flow of\nthe program in the top-down format,\nwith increasing levels of detail explicitly\nindicated. This structured-design diagram approach is particularly appropriate for languages with higher level constructs, such as case, iterative loops, or\nlogical dependent execution blocks.\nThe source code for FLOWCHARTER is written for the PASCAL Release\n2 compiler, as distributed by the Univer-\n\nsity of Minnesota. FLOWCHARTER is\nintended for batch execution and has\nbeen implemented on a CDC 6000-series computer with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 100K\n(octal) of 60-bit words.FLOWCHARTER was developed in 1979.\nThis program was written by Higher\nOrder Software, Inc., for Langley Re\xc2\xb7\nsearch Center.
