The necessary shift of Ops Planners\u2019 complete management of scheduling and planning to provide flexibility for crew to manage their own schedule in real-time requires significant research and investigation in evaluation of concepts of operations, of software tools to support tasks, and of crew performance to complete scheduling tasks. Our research objective is to characterize the human performance envelope for the task of planning and scheduling (crew self-scheduling), develop countermeasures to mitigate adverse performance effects due to plan complexity, and inform performance standards and guidelines based on research results.\nIn our efforts to understand and characterize scheduling performance of crew members, we have conducted subject matter expert interviews to obtain feedback on scheduling plan complexity drivers and plan goodness. Following the pilot study conducted last year, we designed a study and have begun remote human subject testing to evaluate non-expert human performance, workload, and situational awareness for the task of planning and scheduling. This study investigates the effects of the number and type of constraints on human performance, and the differences in scheduling metrics between scheduling and rescheduling tasks. Subject testing is currently in progress, and we aim to collect data from approximately thirty subjects. We will summarize the methods used and impacts of the number and type of scheduling constraints. We will also present lessons learned as well as relevant results of the study.\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210000727, "endDate": "2021-02-04T08:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d28afa4e55ea4867840029aaecaa597d", "id": "75ba6a528a0e4f94873669d697c180e3"}], "name": "Human Resource Program (HRP) Investigators' Workshop (IWS) 2021", "location": "Virtual", "id": "d28afa4e55ea4867840029aaecaa597d", "url": "https://web.cvent.com/event/ddb36a0a-6937-49ba-8eca-086ce232d767/summary", "startDate": "2021-02-01T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "1676MarquezIWS.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210000727/downloads/1676MarquezIWS.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210000727/downloads/1676MarquezIWS.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210000727/downloads/1676MarquezIWS.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
