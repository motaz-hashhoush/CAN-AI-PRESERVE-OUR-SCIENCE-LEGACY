The discussion of advanced technologies in spacecraft design includes power subsystem sized to satisfy all near-term spacecraft power needs, spacecraft bus provides test-bed for maturing technologies, and no insurmountable technical hurdles. The discussion of space solar power primary payload options examines large envelope with standard interfaces reserved for high-power payload. The discussion of modular spacecraft design includes upgrade opportunities, capability for mission tailoring, and bus qualified for most launch vehicles. This discussion of spacecraft compatible with medium ELV performance includes mass capability to ISS orbit and fairing capability for large payloads on the bus.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050009896, "endDate": "2004-11-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2004 JUSTSAP Workshop", "location": "Kona, HI", "id": "3c1109bf7e1a4684a0906cf9d2ceac43", "startDate": "2004-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20050009896, "endDate": "2004-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "55th IAC", "location": "Vancouver, British Columbia", "id": "0fd83cca9f62461282a1e0773498c75c", "startDate": "2004-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050009896, "id": "9e9dc0b7ed1344aabaa9f51e26327aaf", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050009896.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050009896/downloads/20050009896.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050009896/downloads/20050009896.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050009896/downloads/20050009896.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
