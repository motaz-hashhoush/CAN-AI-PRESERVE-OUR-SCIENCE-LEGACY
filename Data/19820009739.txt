(Removal of the assumption that all\ncomponents within a system have lifetimes commensurate with the system lifetime.)\n(4) Explicit treatment of variations in system performance with time.\n(5) Explicit treatment of tax incentives, including use of the investment as a tax shelter. Tax incentives incorporated include investment tax credits, solar tax credits, property tax rates, accelerated depreciation, and\ncapital gains.\n(6) Incorporation of financial benefits of usable thermal energy, utility buy-back (in parallel or simultaneous\nmode) of excess electricity generated, capacity displacement and fuel savings credits, and, where appropriate, roof credits.\nThe net present value of the system, viewed as an investment, is determined by consideration of all financial\nbenefits and costs (including a specified return on investment). Along the way, life cycle costs, life cycle revenues,\nand residual system values are obtained. Break-even values of system parameters are estimated by setting the net\npresent value to zero. While the model was designed for photovoltaic generators with a possible thermal energy\nbyproduct, its applicability is not limited to such systems.\nThe resulting Owner-dependent Methodology for Energy Generation system Assessment (OMEGA) consists of\na few equations that can be evaluated without the aid of a highspeed computer.\nThis report is published in two volumes. Volume 1 is a self-contained summary, and can be thought of as a\nuser\'s guide to the application of OMEGA. Volume H gives the complete derivation.\n\niii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe methodology presented in this report is a derivative of the Utility-owned Solar Electric Systems (USES)\nmodel [Doane 19761 created by Dr. James W. Dow of Science Applications Incorporated, Golden, CO, and Dr.\nRichard P. OToole of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It has also benefitted from the development of the Solar\nArray Manufacturing Industry Costing Standards (SAMICS) [Chamberlain 19791 methodology, which was based on\nthe USES approach; discussions with Robot W. Aster, Dr. James W. Dome, Chester S. Borden, and Dr. Richard B.\nDwis were particularly relevant and helpful.

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME 11\n\nCue was taken in preparing this document to separate the OMEGA algorithm from its rather lengthy derivation\nand the detailed discussion of issues, assumptions, and approximations which led to it.\nThe algorithm is given in Volume I, along with enough dentitions and accompanying material to facilitate its\nuse. This volume contains the background analyses and discussions. It is anticipated that the primary audiences of\nthe two volumes will be quite different.\n\nU\xe2\x80\xa21\n\n2. NET PRESENT VALUE\n2.1 Devinkbm\n\nThe foundation of this methodology is the concept of the net po t tyre of the system under consideration.\nEqual cash flows at different times do not have the same worth to the supplier (or re ildent) of the cash flow; the\npresent value operation adjusts for timing differences so that the worths can be compared. The net present value is\nobtained by subtracting the sum of the present values of all coats from the sum of the present values of all !hernial\nbenefits.\nDefinition: The present value of a cast flow of an amount A occurring at time t is the amount of money which, if\ninvested at a time arbitrarily called the present (to simplify notation, the present in this analysis is taken to be the\n\ntime at which the system first slam producing usable energy; all times are measured relative to that time, hence:\nt - 0 at the start of usable energy production), earning interest compounded every period at the discount rote (see\nSection 4.4.1.3, I1-37 for a discussion of tho selection of a numerical value), would be worth A at time t. (If the\ncast flow occurs before the present the definition does not change \xe2\x80\x94 the investment is for a negative number at\nperiods. An equivalent interpretation which may be easier to accept is that the amount A, earning interest compounded every period at the discount rate, would be worth the present value at the present.)\nNot only does worth depend on the timing of cash flows, but the amount of money associated with a particular\namount of worth also changes with time due to inflation and escalation.\nDefinition: /n Elation is a\n\nchange in the value of a given number of dollars, as approximated by the Implicit Price\n\nDeflator published by the Department of Commerce.\nAli values are expressed in terns of bole yeardoliers, eenoted i e . The value of a dollar at time t is assumed\nto be equal to the ratio of the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) at time Ye , where Ys is the base year, to its value at\ntime t. The IPD is published quarterly; interpolation w finer resolution is not recommended \xe2\x80\x94 use of the IPD for\nthe last quarter completed prior to the date of interest is preferred.\nNote: The base year, Ys , is not necessarily the present. (By way of illustration. a cost of A dollars on July 13,\n1978, would be worth A X 121.60/150.98 $1975 because the IPD for the fourth quarter of 1974 is 121.60 and the\nIPD for the second quarter of 1978 is 150.98. It may be noted from this illustration that the symbol $ r is used to\ndenote year t dollars and that the start of the year is to be assumed if no further information is given.)\nLet\nof IPD for\n4\xe2\x96\xbas - Inflation factor from the bane you. Y p , to the start of system operation at t - 0; the ratio\nt - 0 to IPD for t corresponding to Ye . Note that \xe2\x80\xa2: will normally be greater than unity if the base\nyear precedes the start of system operations.\n\nThe present value computation is given by\nA r\t\nPV (A) =\t\n41s\n\n(1)\n\n(1 +k)t\n\n11.2\n\n\t\n\nwhere\'\nPV (A t) =\n\nPresent value of a cast flow of A t (expressed in !t) occurring at tints t, expressed in $6.\n\nk\t\n\nThe discount rate, a Wowd in 96 (per year). (Note that percentages must always be convened to\nfractions (by dividing by 100%) before use in computations.)\n\nThe division by ( J + k )r produces the present value of the cash flow (as of t = 0, the prewnt^ The division by 4=\ndeflates (or perhaps inflates) that present value to base year dollars, ae.\nThe IPD measures \'he change in the purchas i ng power of the dollar averaged over the entire grow national\nproduct. Prices of iLtdividual goods and services change at different rates. In addition, the amounts of ,Dods and\nservices required to achieve a givers result may change. The combined effect of these two phenomena is called\nescalation. The following three escalation factors will be used later:\n\n4e = Eacalation factor for the price of electrical energy from the base you to the start of system operation.\n(The ratio of the price of electrical energy to the prospective user of the system under consideration\nat time t = 0 to the price at Ya.)\n\nOc = Escalation factor for the prig of capital goods from the base year to the start of system operation.\nob. = Escalation factor for operating and maintenance expenaat from the base year to the start of system\noperation.\nIn addition to these factors, which can incorporate non-constant percentage dianges from year to year, the relate)\n\nescalation rates, assumed to be constant from t = 0 on ( snd in some cases before t = 0) for the sake of simplicity,\nwill be used:\nge = Electrical energy retail price escalation rate, expressed in % (per year).\ng^ = Capital cost escalation rate, expressed in % (per year).\n\ngx = Operating and maintenance expense escalation rate, expressed in % (per year).\ngs = Evslation rate for energy sold back to the electrical utility, expressed in % (per year). This rate maybe\ndifferent from that for the retall price of electrical energy, ge , as a result of changing penetration into\nthe grid.\n2.2 The .VPV Equation,\nThe net present value of the system is given by Equation 2.\n\t\nNPV s m. .\'\xe2\x80\x94\'IT - COST\nu\n\n(-)\n\nt in this document, symbuis used are r.omplrteby dented when tint introduced, usually irnarsdutely after art equation.

In fact, break-even values of any\nof the system paranseters are defined on the same basis:\n\nTi>r break-even value of a system parameter is that value, if any, for -which the present value of all\nfinancial benefits is exactly equal to the present value of all costs (including a \'"\'Cmnablc" return on\nL equity).\n\nInvestment decisions will require consideration of additional information, such as the tffects of intemctions2\nbetween the system considered and other hardware already in place or scheduled, the relationship of this investment\nto the investor\'s total investment portfolio, and nondinoncLi bensfits and costs (such as energy independence,\nreduction of pollutant production, improvement of employees\' working conditions. system aesthetics. and to on)\nrelative to the competitive alternatives. The net present value itself is one of the most uaefut figures of merit available to the potential investor. and provides a measure in which the size of the systerc hz rot been tlicninated.\n2.4.

In the USES methodology, it is assumed that the end of\nthe system lifetime (t =N) is a satisfactory planning horizon, and that either the present value\ncomputation (see Equation (1),11-2) reduces any benefits or costs that occur after t = N to insignificance or that the system is decommissioned at t = N. The use of BBEC as a measure of\nthe normative system energy price in USES led to the restriction that all systems to be compared had to have the same system lifetime, because the price BBEC does not show the effects\nof inflation on benefits. (The effects of inflation are fully accounted for in the USES determination of BBECo.) The restriction that all systems compared must have the saute lifetime\nhas been removed in OMEGA; in fact, the system lifetime need not even be related to the\nreplacement lifetimes of any of the system components. In OMEGA, the system lifetime is\nrather arbitrary \xe2\x80\x94 it marks the dividing line between life cycle costs (and revenues) and the\nresidual system value. If the system is resold for capital gains, it is sold at the end of the\nsystem lifetime \xe2\x80\x94 in that context, N should be considered to be the investment lifetime.\nPV\t\n\n= Present value function defined by Equation (1), U-2.\n\nThe careful reader will note in the following pages that although all the explanations are written in terms of\nannual cash flows, there is little in the mathematics to preclude the use of shorter time periods, such as months.\nAnyone willing to bear the additional computational burden can use the model with appropriately adjusted rates and\nlifetimes.\nThe first summation in both Equations (3) and (4), addresses the time period from the first system-resultant\ncash flow (which is very likely to occur before the start of system operations at t = 0, but much later than t =\nnegative infinity, so the lower limit of the summation can be replaced by If, the time of that first cash flow) to the\nend of the system lifetime.\nThe present value operation causes the terms in the second summation in Equations (3) and (4), to be relatie-.ly wnali 3 . Furthermore, if the system under consideration is assumed to be a finite-lived project, then the last\nsystem-resultant cash flow occurs at or near the end of the system lifetime, so that there are no terms in the second\nsummation. These arguments constitute the rationale for omitting the second summation altogether, as was done in\nUSES. For calculation of the financial contribution to capital budgeting decisions, these conditions are usually met\nand the second summations can indeed be omitted.\n\n3From Equation ( 1). 11-2, if k a 10% and N a 30 years, a cash flow of $1 at t =N+ 1 contributes only $0.05 to the present value.\nU-5\n\n\t\n\nHowever, this methodology has other 4 applications, and the necessary conditions are not always met. The con\xe2\x80\xa2\ncept of residual system mine has been introduced to extend the methodology\'s applicability to situations in which\ncomponent lifetimes are not necessarily submultiples of the system lifetime.\n\n2.S. Life Cycle Revenue and Coat and Residual System Value\nFor convenience, associate names and symbols with the four summations in Equations (3) and (4),114:\nN\n\nREV\n\n(S)\n\n= E PV (Benefit,)\t\nt=tf\n\nwhere\nREV\n\n= Life cycle revenues; the sum of the present values of all financial benefits (not just revenues)\t\nresulting from system operation during the system lifetime, expressed in $b.\n\nt f\t\n\nl\n\n= Time of the first system-resultant cash flow, expressed in years after the start of system operation.\n(Thus, t f will normally be negative.)\nr\nN\n\nLCC\n\n= 1: PV (Cost,)\t\n\n(6)\n\nt=t f\n\nwhere\nLCC\t\n\n= Life cycle cost; the sum of the present values of all costs resulting from system operation during\nthe system lifetime, expressed in $b .\n\nPV (Benefit,)\t\n\nRSB =\t\n\n(7)\n\nt=N+1\n\nwhere\nRSB\t\n\n= Benefit part of residual system value; the sum of the present values of all system-resultant financial\nbenefits that occur after the end of the system lifetime, expressed in $b*\t\n\nt\n\na\n\nRUC =\t\n\nPV (Cost,)\t\n\n(8)\n\nt =N+ i\ni\n40ne of the most interesting uses of this methodology, for example, is the determination of the effect of component lifetimes on\nsystem energy price. Omission of the second summations can cause peculiar jumps in system energy price as the component lifep p system the system illustration, suppose\ntime is variedast submulti lea of the stem lifetime. By way oflifetime is 30 years and array\nlifetimes of 29 and 31 years are considered. The 29-year array must be replaced at t - 29 in order to keep the system operational\nfor 30 years. the 31-year array need not be replaced. The benefits from operating the system with the 2SO -year array for 27 more\nyears than with the 31-year array would be ignored, but a major contributor to the cost of providing that capability would not be.\n\nH-6\n\nS\n\n\t\n\nWhere\nRSC\t\n\nCost part of residual system value; the sum of the present values of all system-resultant costs that\noccur after the end of the system lifetime, expressed in $b -\n\nThe net residual system value is of interest as well:\n(9)\n\nRSV = RSB -RSC\t\n\nwhere\nRSV\t\n\nresidual system value; the net present value of all system-resultant benefits and costs that\noccur after the end of the system lifetime, expressed in $b.\n\n= (Net)\n\nEvaluation of the four terms defined by Equations (5), through (8)11-6, requires consideration of what would\nreally be done with the system at the end of the system lifetime. If the system were a `wonderful one-boss shay"\',\nthere would be no further benefits or costs to be considered, and the residual system value would be zero. The same\nwould be the case if, the system were resold, because the revenues from resale are (arbitrarily) treated as a reduction\nin life cycle cost, rather than as a residual value. (See Section 43.2.2, 11.5 1.) If the system is decommissioned, on\nthe other hand, the sum of the salvage values of the components, taking into account the fact that they may have\ndifferent ages, should be used as the resale revenue, and the present value of the costs of system removal and site\nrestoration should be inserted as the (negative) residual system value.\n4\n\n1\n\nIn many cases, the system, having been kept in good repair, would still have considerable value if maintenance\nand use were to be continued, or if those components that are still in good condition were to be used in other but\nsimilar systems. In these cases, it is the value remaining in the system that should be used. One way to estimate this\nvalue would be to sum the depreciated values of all of the system components. Depreciation, however, is merely a\nlegally-approved approximation to that value and was designed to meet other objectives. A better way to estimate\nthe residual system value in these cases is to assume, for the purpose of this calculation, that the system will be\nmaintained and operated in perpetuity .7 The discounting that often makes the system lifetime a satisfactory planning horizon will greatly reduce the impact of ignoring the fact that obsolescence will eventually make continued\noperation uneconomic. The effect of this treatment is to move the planning horizon considerably farther into the\nfuture.\nStrictly speaking, the summations in the definitions of REV and LCC should include all benefit and cost cash\nflows resulting from installation of the system and operation of it during the system lifetime, and the summations in\nthe definitions of RSV should include all benefit and cost cash flows resulting either from removal, salvage, and restoration or from continuation of system operation beyond the specified lifetime. The distinction between "costs\n\nS In Oliver Wendell Holmes\' classic poem \'The Deacon\'s Masterpiece or The Wonderful One\xe2\x80\xa2Hoss Shay", the deacon designed and\nbuilt a horse-drawn .arr:age so exquisitely that no maintenance or repairs were ever required. After exactly 100 years of daily\noperation, the cariiag,: was wom out \xe2\x80\x94 but so uniformly that it suddenly became "a heap or mound, as if it had been to the mill\nand ground".\n6Tax depreciation rules are designed to encourage certain types of investment. Book depreciation conventions are sometimes designed to provide protection against some kinds of uncertainties and sometimes designed to estimate resale (i.e. salvage) values.\nNeither tax nor book depreciation usually accounts for inflation.\nl it may be noted that extending the planning horizon to the least common multiple of all of the component lifetimes (and the\nsystem life) will give the same result. That, however, would be a little more cumbersome mathematically, and no more satisfactory\nfrom a philosophical point of view.\n\nll-7\n\nduring the system lifetime" and "coats resulting from operation during the lifetime" is primarily of theoretical, not\npractical, importance: The timing of actual cash flows may not coincide exactl y with the model of system operations, anyway. For example, receipt of payments for utility bills usually occurs a month or two after the electricity\nis delivered. There has been no attempt to model the real world to that level of detail.\n\n11.8\n\n3. BENEFITS\nFinancial benefits considered here come from three sources, which are of different relative importance to the\ndifferent kinds of owners. The three sources are:\n(1) Electrical energy generated by the syrkem and used by the system owner. The normative system energy\nprice is an estimate of the cost of producing this energy \xe2\x80\x94 it Is analogous to the busbar energy cost (BBEC)\ndetermined by USES.\n(2) Thermal energy generated by the system and used by the system owner. In the present context, thermal\nenergy is treated as a byproduct of system operation. Its value (per unit of energy) is determined exogenously (by the user of OMEGA) from consideration of displacement of thermal energy purchases (e.g., fuel\noil, coal, natural gas, etc.) and, possibly, from consideration of other effects on the owner \'s operations\n(e.g., more \xe2\x80\x94 or less \xe2\x80\x94 comfortable working conditions, reductions \xe2\x80\x94 or increases \xe2\x80\x94 in manufacturing process time, and so on).\n(3) Electrical energy generated by the system and sold to the electrical utility. The price at which it is sold is\ndetermined by the combined effect of all such "cogenerators" on the utility (FERC 1980 1. If all of the\nelectrical energy generated by the system is sold to the utility, the system energy price is not meaningful;\nthe break-even seilback price is their the estimate of the cost of producing this energy.\nDisplaced expenditures for purchased electrical energy are considered to be in the first category of financial benefits.\nDisplaced expenditures for energy generation capacity, for fuel, and for maintenance or other operating expenses\nare treated here as cost reductions, not as financial benefits. Any tax benefits are also treated as cost reductions.\nThus, for all kinds of owners,\n\nBenefit, _ (1 - a t ) Pr Er + at pt Er + a t ^ E,\t\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\na, =\n\nFraction of the electrical energy produced by the system during year t which is :old to the electrical\nutility.

When estimating the net present value of the system, P, should be set to the\naverage price of electrical energy obtained from alternative sources (e\n.g., the electrical grid). When\ndetermining the normative system energy price (this term is meaningful only if at is not identically\nequal to unity), Pt is the value of that variable in year t.\nEt =\n\nElectrical energy (delivered to the "busbar" or to the meter) generated by the system during year t,\nexpressed in kWh.\n\nat = Value of system -produced thermal energy in year t, expressed as a fraction of the value that the systemproduced electrical energy would have at the grid price of electricity. This parameter can be expressed\nas the product of a price fraction and an energy fraction:\nar fir\n\nE\n\n\t\n(11)\n\nr = (al r pr ) X (a2r Er)\n\nPt = Average retail price of electrical energy obtained from the utility grid in year t, expressed in $,/kWh.\n119\n\nor value) of thermal energy in year t, expressed as a fraction of the price of electrical energy\na1 t \'Z (\nobtained from the grid.

Whta estimating the net present value of the system, V, should be set to the\naverage sellback price for electrical energy (which must be determined exogenously). When determining the break-even sellback price (this term is only meaningful if o, is not identically equal to zero),\n&t is the value of that variable in year t.\n3.1 The Price Of Energy\nEnergy prices are assumed to escalate uniformly, but not necessarily at equal rates:\nPt = P (b e (1 +ge)t -112\n\n\t\n(i +ge)t-1/2\nPt = P 4\n9 _ ^r 4,\t\n\n(12)\n\n+g)t -112\n-1/2\n\nwhere\nP = System energy price, the marginal cost of electrical energy produced by the system or the price of\nsystem-supplied electrical energy used by the system owner at the start of system operations (t = 0),\nexpressed in $b/kWh.\np = Price of electrical energy obtained from the utility grid at the start of system operations (t = 0), ex-\n\npressed in $b/kWh.\n= Sellback price for electrical energy produced by the system and sold to the utility at the start of system operations (t = 0), expressed in $b/kWh s\nStrictly speaking, the averaging of energy prices called for by the definitions of Pr , p,, and ^P, should be\nweighted by energy production over the year, rather than merely being taken at the middle of the year, as is implied\nby the "- 1/2" in the exponents in Equation (12). However, the caor of approximation introduced by the assumption of uniform escalation, is probably more severe than that caused by failing to weight the average. Furthermore,\nthe error of approximation due to assuming that the escalation rate is known is probably larger than either. (Ignoring\nescalation, on the other hand, would be tantamount to awuming that it is zero, which would lead to much poorer\nestimates.)\n\n*"\t\nr\t\n\naA slight adjustment may be needed to account far * ransmission losses ( or the lack thereof) if the system is installed on a residence\nSee also Footnote 11,11-11.\n\nr\nI1.10\n\n3.2 The Amount Of Net Electrical EneW\nThe net electrical energy produced by the system comes first from an initial period of building up to capacity ;9\nthen, after the plant has reached capacity, energy production is assumed to vary over a definable interval in a pre.\ndictable way. If the system is assumed 10 to be "revitalized" by a block replacement of the energy collection components (i.e., the arrays), then the pattern of energy production during the first interval repeats itself until the system\nis decommissioned.\nDetermination of the predicted performance of the system is beyond the scope of this analysis; it is not a trivial\ntask for weather dependent systems or for those that degrade with time. An hourly simulation over both the buildup\nperiod (called the increment to capacity period in [Borden 19801) and the first of the repetitive system energy production cycles may be necessary. The following discussion is given to aid in the use of the results of such simulations; much of it would not be needed for weather independent systems which do not experience performance\ndegradation.\nThe net electrical energy is thus assumed to vary with time as follows:\nE et\t\n\nfor t < to\n\nE t1m\t\n\nfor t > to + 1\n\n( 13)\n\nEt =\t\n\nwhere\nto\n\n= Time at which the system starts full capacity operation. (Note that to could be zero if there were no\nincrements to capacity, or it could be very large if there were no repetitive energy generation cycle.)\n\nE = Net electrical energy produced by the system" during the first year of capacity opemttrm, expressed\nin kWh. (If the possibility of "revitalization" is to be ignored, so that to is very large, some other year\n\ncould be used to characterize the system\'s nominal output. Development of this approach is left as an\nexercise for the interested reader.)\net\n\n=\n\nNet electrical energy produced by the system in year t during the period of building up to capacity\noperation, expressed as a fraction of initial full-capacity output, E.\n\ntlm = Relative performance, the net electrical energy produced by the system during the m-th year into a\n\nrepetition of the full-capacity system energy production cycle, expressed as a fraction (or multiple) of\nthe initial full-capacity output, E.\n\nThe index m is defined by the w.uation\nm = G X frac [(t - to )/G J\n\n\t\n\n(14)\n\n9This period of building up to capacity could, of course, be absent.\n\nI O lt is recognized that the actual replacement scenario may not match this assumption. This scenario, however, should give a reasonably accurate formulation, and introduces the system revitalization period explicitly into the model. The effects of changes in the\nexpected value of the energy collection component lifetime may be readily assessed by this scenario. The model does not depend\non the validity of this scenario \xe2\x80\x94 the user may, if he wishes to supply sufficient data, define a system revitalisation period so\nlarge that even the residual system value is unaffected by "revitalization" of the system.\n\nt t It should be noted, both here and particularly in the calculation of the value of electrical energy sold back to the grid, that transmission losses should be considered properly. "Proper consideration" depends upon how this analysis is being used.\n\nII-11\n\n\t\n\nwhere\nfrac (A) = The fracdonol part of A.\n\nSystem "revitalization\' period, the length of the repetitive energy production cycle, expressed in\n\nL\t\n\nYears.\nThe annual energy produced by a solar energy system depends upon the local intensity of solar radiation, the\ninstalled area of solar collectors, and the "am efficiency. Solar radiation depends upon location, time of year, and\nweather. The collector area depends upon how much of the system has been installed and is operating. System\nefficiency depends upon array pointing, cell temperatures, performance degradation (due to such factors as dirt\naccumulation, encapsulant yellowing, cell cracking, etc.), electrical losses, parasitic power requirements, replacement\npolicies, and so on.\nThe annual net energy produced by a solar electric system can be estimated by Equation (15):\nEt = S r Z t n;\n\n\t\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\nSt = Total solar energy incident on the system during year t, expressed in kWh/kWp (which reduces to the\n\nrather obscure \xe2\x80\x94 in this context \xe2\x80\x94 unit hours). It should be noted that the value of this datum depends\non the system design, as well as on location, because systems differ in their ability to use diffuse\ninsulation (in addition to direct insolation). The value does not, however, depend on the area or the\nefficiency of the system.\nZt = Average nameplate size of the system in year t, expressed in kWp. It may be noted that the use of the\nproduct of St and Z t to represent the solar energy input to the system allows the system size to be\nexpressed in terms of nameplate capacity, rather than area, imposing only the constraint that the same\n(perhaps rather arbitrary) definition of the insolation level required to produce one Wp be applied in\ndetermining both quantities.\nn; = Average system efficiency, due to the combined effect of all factors, in year t.\nComparison of Equations (13), I1-11, and (15) shows that\ner\n\n= St\n\nZ t r!;/E for t < to\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nE = SZi?\n\n% = (S t fir)/(S rl) for to + 1 < t < to +L\t\n\nm = t - to\n\nwhere\nS = Total solar energy incident on the system in year\n\nt = 0, expressed in kWh/kWp.\n\nZ = Nameplate size of the system at capacity, expressed in kWp.\n11.12\n\n(18)\n\n\t\n\ng = Average system efficiency (g;) during the first year of full-capacity operation (that is, for t in the range\n\nto<t4to+1).\nNote that Equation ( 18) places a constraint on application of the methodology with monthly resolution: If the\nrevitalization period does not correspond to an integral number of years, the degradation pattern would get out of\nsynchronization with the insolation pattern. This lack of synchronization does not occur until t reaches t o +L + 1;\neven then the impact on estimated energy production should not be large.\n3.3 We Cycle Revenues and Residual System Benefit\nThe year-by-year financial benefits from the system can be obtained by substituting the energy price equations\n(Equations ( 12), II-10) and the energy production equations (Equations ( 13), 11-11) into the benefit equation\n(Equation ( 10),11 -9). The result of these substitutions is:\nBenefit, = I [(1 - a t ) P +a l p] ( 1 +ge )t - 1 /2 + at JP (1 +gs y-1 /2 1 fie E e t\n\nfor t < to\t\n\n(19)\n\nBenef:t t = {[( 1- at)P+atpl (1 +ge ) r-1/2 +a tjP(I +gd) t - 1/2 1 4^e Egm fort > ro\t(20)\nwhere m is defined by Equation ( 14), II-11.\nThese benefit equations may now be substituted into the life cycle revenue Equation ( 5),11 .6, and the benefit\npart of the residual system value Equation ( 7),1I.6, to obtain, after defining some summary variables,\n\n\t\n\nREV\t\n\n= [(1 - a)\n\nP spin + a p tpm + o.Vbpm [ E\n\nRSB\t\n\n= [(1 - a)\n\nP rspin + a p rtpm + a.P rbpm [ E\n\n(21)\n\n\t\n\nBENEFIT = REV + RSB = [(1-a)Pspm\xe2\x80\x9e+aptpm,+a,*bpm V I E\n\n(22)\n\n\t\n(23)\n\nwhere\na = Fraction of system -produced electrical energy which is sold back to the utility in the\nfirst year of full capacity operation (to < t < to + 1).

COSTS\nSystem costs are of five basic types:\n(1) Repayment of capital used to purchase capital goods.\n\' 1\t\n\ni\n\n1\t\n\nWt - Amount of equity principal returned in you t, expressed in $t.\n\n^\n\nPDR, = Amount of debt retired in you t, expressed in $t.\n(2) Payment of a reasonable return on investment:\nEQR t - Amount of return paid to holders of equity in year t, expressed in $t.\nINT, = Amount of interest paid on debt in year t, expressed in $t.\n\n(3) Payment of increased (or decreased) income taxes:\nTAXI = Amount of additional (over those which would be paid without the system under consideration)\nstate and federal income taxes paid in year t, expressed in $,.\nRSL t =Gain from resales 3 of the system in year t, expressed in $,. This gain enters the cost equation as a\nnegative term. because it results from selling the system at market value at the end of the\ninvestment lifetime, and produces a receipt.\n(4) Payment of expenses that result from the presence of capital goods:\nOT.Y t = Other ( than income) taxes (primarily property taxes) in year t, expressed in $t.\n\nINS, = Insurance premiums for year t, expressed is $r.\n(S) Payment of expenses for operations, maintenance, fuel, etc.:\nX t\t= Operating expenses in year t, expressed in $,.\nAdding up all of these costs gives the following expression for the annual cost:\nCost, = Rt:Pt + PDR t + EQR t + We + TAX t - RSL t + OTX t + INS ( + X t\t\n\n(38)\n\nIt should be noted that the actual putrchaw costs of capital goods are not explicitly included in Equation (38). It\nis assumed that capitr; goods are purchased with funds from equity investment and debt financing- Financial\nbenefits (that is, explicit or implicit revenues) are not required to purchase capital goods, but they must cover equity\nand debt repayment ( as well as return on equity and interest on debt), in addition to the costs of operating the\n13 A case could be made for calling RSL t a ffnenciel benefit, rather than a cost. The rationale for considering it as a negative ant is\nthat it is not a result of what the system is designed to do, but that it is the result of a financial manipulation involving the system.\nIt u included as a cost of type ( 3), along with income taxes, because it is primarily the deductibility of depreciation (especially\naaxierated depreciation) that may make mask financially desirable. ( inflation increases its desirability.)\n\n11.20\n\nsystem. Thus, from the point of view of an investor, investment in the system under consideration may be thought\nof as a "financial machine" which convects investment cash flow streams into repayment ash flow streams. As will\nbe seen in later sections, most of the coat components do depend on the amount of capital investment.\nBy way of comparison, the USES model includes capital investment as a cost (negative cash flow) and balances\nthis by including equity investment (stock sales) and debt financing (bond sales) sa benefits (positive cash flows),\nThis is equivalent to the current model. because USES assumes that the amount of investment is equal (in a present\nvalue sense) to the combined revenue from stock sales and bond sales.\n4.1. Capacity Credits and Fuel SavLys Credits\nEquation (38) allows for a reduction in costs that might occur when the proposed system reduces the need for\nconventional or alternative energy generation. The cost reductions are in the form of displaced or deferred capital\ninvestment (capacity credit) and avoided system operating expenses. The avoided operating expenses can include\nfuel (fuel savings credlt^ operations, maintenance, eta\nCredits for avoided operating expenses can be entered into the model as negative expenses through the X t term\nin Equation (38).\nCapacity credits can be viewed as negative capital investments. To include a capacity credit in the model, the\nfull effect of a negative capital investment on cost must be entered. To do this, the method of financing and the\nbook and tax depreciation schedules that would have been used must be detailed. Then the appropriate capital cost\nmultipliers can be calculated for the displaced capital investments.\nThe capacity credits and fuel savings credits resulting from the displacement of expenditures on alternative\nenergy generation equipment apply only if the system under consideration is evaluated by itself. If the alternative\nsystem design is also to be evaluated, and the resultant energy prices are to be compared, then these credits are not\nrelevant, as they are intended to account for the difference. Then credits would also not be relevant if there is no\nalternative system, Three examples to illustrate these points follow:\nFirst example: Suppose a utility is considering adding capacity to its present plant to provide additional\ncapacity in the face of a growing demand. One alternative might be to add 100 MWe of coal buming generators; the\nsolar electric option might be 10 MWe of gas turbines plus 150 MWp of photovoltaics. ( To make the comparison\n\nmeaningful, both alternatives must be sited to provide the same level of service, which might be measured by the\n"loss of load probability" or by some other figure of merit.) Then, if the solar (plus gas turbine) system is priced by\nitself, the capital required for the 100 MWe coal plant may be taken as a <wpaci!\xe2\x96\xba, credit, and the cost of the coal\nthat that plant would use may be taken as a fuel sov/ngs crft it. The resultant price would be compared to the price\nof energy from the utility \' s current plant. a lower price for the solar system would indicatc that the " solar plus gas\nturbine plus existing" option is cheaper than the "coal plus existing" option. On the other hand, the analyst may\ncalculate a price for "solar plus gas p l us existing" and a price for "coal plus existing"; in this case, the capacity credit\nand fuel savings credit would be " .Pi,uble counted" if they were included.\nSecond example: A solar (sub)system might be added to an existing plant, allowing the decommicsionh* of\nsome existing equipment ( while still providing the same performance) and/or allowing the utility to utilize less fuel.\nThen the capital that can be recovered by the decommissioning (if any) provides the capacity crMt, and the\nreduction ( if any) in fuel utilized provides the fuel savlW credit.\n\n11-21\n\ns\n\nThird example: Suppose a company is considering installing a photovoltaic system to supply part of its electrical\nand thermal energy needs. The photovoltaic system will not be connected to the grid, so no electricity will be sold\nback to the utility. However, any needs that the photovoltaic system cannot meet will be purchased from the\nelectric and gas utilities. In this scenario, the cWacity credit and either the fuel sayings credit or the thermal credit\n(but not both) would be zero. Any effects that the company \'s reduced demand would have on retail electricity and\ngas prices would have to be dealt with exogenously or by modeling the larger system that includes the utilities.\n4.2. Capital Investment\nFunds for capital investment are assumed to be supplied by equity investment and debt financing, not by\nrevenue from system energy generation. However, this statement, while true, can be misleading, for almost all of the\ncost components in Equation (38),11-20, are directly dependent on capital expenditures.\nIt is assumed that each kind of capital good has a known, deterministic lifetime, L1, at the end of which it is\nreplaced. Furthermore, some of the capital must be supplied quite a while before the start of system operation.\nCapital costs are assumed to grow at the rate of capital escalation. In some cases, replacement costs will be different\nthan initial costs due to significant installation differences, and, possibly, due to differences in construction\ncontingency allowances that must be made. Thus,\n\nerr = Y-j cjtr\n\n\t\n\n(39)\n\nCj4\'.\'(1+g\')i\t\n\nfir =\t\n\nfor t - tj\n\nCj 4^, (1+ge)t (1+dj)\t\n\nfor t=tj+Lj,tj+2Lj,...\n\n(40)\n\nwhere\n\nCie = Capital investment at time t, expressed in $f.\nUjr = Capital investment at time t in capital goods of type j, expressed in $ t . The upper expression in\nEquation (40) applies to the initial installation, which occurs at t = tj . The lower expression applies\neach time that capital good is replaced, which occurs at intervals of Li.\n\nCj = Purchase cost of capital goods of type j, expressed in $b . This cost includes any allowance for\nconstruction contingencies that may be necessary ( perhaps due partially to unfamiliarity among the\nconstruction trades with special handling required for this particular kind of hardware).\nbj = Additional cost of replacement of capital goods of type j, expressed as a fraction of the capital cost at\ninitial installation. This difference may be positive as might be the case if roof credits (see below) were\nclaimed during initial installation, or it might be negative, as would be the case if the initial installation\nincluded a significant allowance for contingency costs. (Zero is also an acceptable value.)\n\nj\n\ntj = Time at which funds for capital goods of type must first be expended, expressed in years.\nLj\n\na Lifetime (i.e., replacement period) of capital goods of type j, expressed in years.\n\nU-22\n\n\t\n\n4.2.1. Roof Credits\nIf any of the system components are designed to be part of some capital structure that would he built even if\nthe system under consideration were not, then only the addtttaW cost due to installation of the system should be\ncharged to the system. (For example, if the energy collection components also serve as a residential roof covering,\nthe appropriate cost to use is any excess over the cost of the conventional roof that would have been installed\ninstead.) If the system component has the same lifetime as the structure that it supplants, the Cj in Equation (40)\nshould simply be reduced in magnitude. If lifetimes are different, however, a capital category should be created for\nthe supplanted capital good, and it should be included in the summation of Equation (39) with a negative capital\ncost\n\n(9.\n\n4.2.2. Initial Capital\nThe initial cost of the system is somewhat difficult to define precisely, since the capital requirements may occur\nat different times. The liquidity requirement, discussed in Section 7.2, 11.67, is a more meaningful measure of the\nfunding that the owner must have in order to pursue the investment opportunity.\nNevertheless, the initial capital cost can be a useful measure of the state of the art, particularly if a broadened\ndefinition of "operations and maintenance" cost is added to the presentation. For this purpose, the simplest\ndefinition is\nK = E1 Cj/Z\t\n\n(41)\n\nwhere\nK = initial system capital, expressed in base year dollars Fer unit of nameplate size (that is, in ,Se; kWp).\nZ = Nameplate size of the system at full capacity, expressed in peak kilowatts 11 -12.\nThe broadened operations and maintenance cost is defined so that it accounts for everything else. This is,\nNPV = (K t K) Z\t\n\n(42)\n\nwhere\nNPV = Net present value of the system, expressed in base year dollars 11.3.\n\n1l\t\n\n= Equivalent initial system non-capital cost, expressed in base year dollars per unit of nameplate size\n(that is, kWp). This is the broadened operations and maintenance cost term.\n\nUquatiun (42) may be easily solved to give\n\ni\nK = N F - K\t\n\nU-23\ni\n\n(43)\n\n\t\n\nt\n\nj\n\nE\n\nAnother definition of initial capital cost may be needed for tax purposes (note the similarity to, but difference\nfrom, Equation (39),11-22):\n(44)\n\nPUR -; a,.rt\t\nwhere\nPUR -\n\nPurchase price of the system, eyrussed in non" dollars of mixed vintage.\n\n4.2.3. Capital Valuation and Depreciation\nThe value of capital goods changes over time as a result of wear-out, obsolescence, inflation, and other factors.\nThese changes are approximated by use of deprecktton schedules. Often, two, sometimes three, legally acceptable\nsets of books are kept, side by side: one for investors\' aceountiy, two for tax purposes. All of the analytically\ntractable schedules can also be expressed by equations, as is done in Appendix C. Us relationship between capital\ninvestment and valuation is given by\nVALi r = Gtr sch(T - t, DLL ,1^, 6,) for T = t, t t 1, t t 2, ...\t\n\n(45)\n\nwhere\nVAL .\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xbaT\n\n= investors\' accounting book value (BVAL j r) or tax book value based on accelerated\ndepredation (TVAL IT) or tax book value based on straight line depreciation (STVAL iT ) at\ntime T, expressed in $T, of capital goods of type j, purchased at time t. These values are often\nquite different due to the use of shortened tax lives and accelerated depredation methods.\n\nsch(A,DL,\xc2\xb5,B) = Schedule function for the depreciating value of capital of age A when the depreciable life is\nDL, the depredation method is \xc2\xb5, and the salvage value fraction is 9, expressed as a fraction of\n\nthe initial value. Schedule functions and related quantities are discussed in detail in Appendix B.\nDLj\n\n= Depreciable lifetime of capital goods of type /, expressed in years. Lifetimes used in the tax\nbooks may be shorter than those used in the investors\' accounting books, which will normally\nbe equal to LJ , the expected useful life.\n= Depreciation method to be used for capital goods of type ! (Appendix B), which may be\ndifferent for the accounting books than for the tax books.\n\n0 i\tSalvage value of goods of type / at the and of their lifetime, expressed as a fraction of\npurchase cost (that is, in a r per $r).\n\ne\n\nTwo characteristics of depreciation are of interest: ( 1) current value, and (2) change in value during the\npreceding year. The first is needed for use in computation of expenses that depend on depreciated value, such as\nproperty taxes and return on equity. The second is needed to determine the legally acceptable estimate of the\ndepreciation "expense" that can be deducted from taxable revenue on the system owner \'s income tax return, and to\ndetermine the payments for return of equity principal.\n\ns.\nt\n11.24\nr\n\nThe schedule function defined above gives the current value of capital goods for each year in the lifetime of the\ngoods. The change in value from year to year is described by the depredation function. The depreciation function\nfor a capital asset can be defined in terms of the schedule function for each year after the initial purchase as:\ndep(A, L. p, 0) - sch(A - 1, L, /t, 9) - sch(A, L, p, 9)\n\n\t\n\n(46)\n\nwhere\ndep(A, L, A, 8) = Depreciation function, the changeIn value of capital during the preceding year, where the\ncapital good is of age A out of a depreciable life of L, the depreciation method is \xc2\xb5, and the\nsalvage value fraction is 9, expressed as a fraction of the initial value. Depreciation functions\n\nand related quantities are discussed in detail in Appendix B.\nThen,\nDEPIt = Qlt dep(T - t, DLI , 1 1 , ^,) for T = t + 1, t + 2, .. . \t\n\n(47)\n\nwhere\nDEPIT = Book depreciation (BDEPIT) or tax depreciation (TDEPIT) during year T, expressed in $T , of capital\ngoods of type J purchased at time t. Book and tax depreciation are often quite different due to use of\n\nshortened tax lives and "accelerated" depreciation methods. ( Appendix B.)\nTotal system values and depreciations are obtained by summation over the different kinds of capital goods:\n\n(48)\n\nBVAL r = EI BVAL/r\t\n\nSTVAL t = Xi STVALir\t(49)\n\nTVALt = E, TVALit\t\n\n(50)\n\nBDEPr = E/ BDEPit\t\n\n(51)\n\nTDEP, = E/ TDEPi,\t\n\n(52)\n\nIt should be noted that if the owner of the system is a utility, current laws require that the same tax lives\nand depreciation methods be used for the tax and accounting books. This fact has not been built into the\ncurrent model as a constraint in order to allow the option of evaluating alternative laws. The user of the\nmethodology, however, should take care to satisfy the constraint when it is applicable.\nThe price for which the system can be sold will be needed in the evaluation of the use of investment in the\nsystem as a tax shelter. Since that price is a market-determined number, and therefore subject to such unmodelable\nfactors as fashion, the uncertainty in any model must be large. It is recommended that the user of OMEGA specify\nits value:\n\nRSL J -N = exogenous.\t\n\n(53)\n\nU-25\n\n\t\n\nwhere\nRSL; - The price at which the system could be resold at time t, expressed in $r.\n\nIf, however, the user would rather not do so, a reasonable estimate can be provided by assuming book depreciation\nInflated by the rate of general inflation:\n-r \t\nRSL r = ; BVALtr ( 1 +g$ )r /\n\n(54)\n\nMother reasonable estimate could be provided by assuming that the system can be resold for its residual system\nvalue:\nRSL;_ N = RSV\t\n\n(55)\n\nWhether the resale price is obtained from Equation (53), (54), or (55), the resale revenue is defined by\nRS4 if t = N\nRSL r =\t\n\n(56)\n0\t\n\nif t # N\n\nwhere\nRSL r = Revenue from resale of the system at time t, expressed in ar.\n4.3 INCOME TAXES\n\nThe income tax term can be eliminated from Equation (38),11-20. by expressing it in terms of revenues and\ncosts. First, note that\nTAXI _ rSTlt -ITCt -STCr\t\n\n(57)\n\nwhere\nr\t\n\n= System owner\'s mar;iW tax rate, which is assumed to be unaffected by investment in the system under\nconsideration, expressed as a fraction of taxable income.\n\nSTI, = System-resultant effect on the owner\'s taxable income in you t, expressed in $r.\nITCt = Investment tax credit available to the system owner due to initial and replacement capital investments in\n\nsystem components in year t, expressed in $,.\nST1Ct - Special solar tax credit available to the system owner due to initial (but not replacement) capital\n\ninvestments in solar energy system components In year t, expressed in $r.\nThe effect of system ownership on taxable income depends on the owner\'s financial environment, and is\ndiscussed in the next three subsections.\n\n11.26\n\n4.3.1 Resale Of The System - A Possible Tax Shelter\nIf depreciation is deductible, which is allowable to whatever fraction of the system\'s operation contributes to\ntaxable income, and the system owner sells the system for an amount which exceeds its depredated value, the\ndifference between the selling price and the depreciated value is subject to taxation.\nThe way in which this difference contributes to taxable income, S77t, however, is quite complicated: part of it\nis considered to be ordbwy Income; the rest of it, if any, is considered to be a oapftel guln, which is taxed as if it\nwere a smaller amount of ordinary income. The system owner benefits considerably from the deductibility of\ndepredation, but he benefits from the portion of the resale gain that is taxed as ordinary income only due to the\ntime value of money - that is, income tax on the "recovered" portion of depreciation is deferred from the time it is\ntaken as depredation until the time the system is sold. The system owner benefits from the portion taxed as a\ncapital gain in that way and, more importantly, by the fact that taxes on the untaxed portion of the capital gain are\ndeferred forever! To illustrate the significance of these points, consider the following three examples.\nCommon to all three examples: Suppose an investor buys a solar energy system for $10,100 in 1980. Suppose\nthe resale value of that system decreases linearly to $100 in 1990 when expressed in 1980 dollars, but that 10%\ninflation increases the resale value when expressed in nominal dollars. Suppose further that the investor\'s discount\nrate is 13% per year and his marginal income tax rate is 3596. The following table shows the year by year resale\nvalues (and summarizes the results of the three examples):\n\nYear\n\nResale Value\nIn 1980 $\t\nIn Nominal $\n\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n\n10,100.00\n9,100.00\n8,100.00\n7,100.00\n6,100.00\n5,100.00\n4,100.00\n3,100.00\n2,100.00\n11100.00\n100.00\n\n10,100.00\n10,010.00\n9,801.00\n9,450.10\n8,931.01\n8,213.60\n7,263.40\n6,041.02\n4,501.54\n2,593.74\n259.37\n\nExample 1\n0.00\n-1,241.59\n-2,424.38\n-3,550.61\n-4,622.44\n-5,641.99\n-6,611.25\n-7,732.20\n-8,406.70\n-9.236.58\n-10,023.59\n\n(partial) Net Present Value\nExample 2\t\nExample 3\nimprovement\t\nImprovement\nover Example 1\t\nover.

The net present value\nof the investment (ignoring the financial benefits and all expenses that are common to all of the scenarios in these\nexamples,- that is, considering only the effects of resale, depreciation, and capital gains) with resale in year r is\nsimply the discounted value of the resale price minus the initial purchase price, and is shown in the above table. (In\nan analysis of all benefits and costs, these negative values are balanced, at least to some extent, by the system energy\nproduction. The full complexity is omitted here to illustrate the tax shelter effect.)\nExample 2: Depreciation but no capital gains. If the investor sells all of the energy produced, he may deduct\ndepreciation (of $1000 each year if he using the "straight-line" method) from his taxable income, thereby saving\n$350 each year. However, when he sells the system, he must pay 35% of the difference between the resale price and\n\n11.27\n\ni\n\nthe depreciated value.

Suppose further that the fraction of capita gains which is added to\ntaxable income is one-ludf. 14 Then the two right-hand columns in the previous table would be halved, which\nproduces the "Example 3" column in the table before that.\nIn these examples the benefits of depredation seem to outweigh the benefits of the capital gains tax shelter, so\nthat the "smart investor" would retain the "an if the investment were properly described by the chosen\nnumerical values of parameters. This is not necessarily the case, however, for the investor could use the resale\nrevenues to purchase another system. It is not the intent of this analysis to investigate the optimal investment\nstrategy; it does however, provide the information necessary to such an investigation.\nThe contribution of resale revenues to taxable income is described by the following equation:\nTOGr +OIr if t-N\n(58)\n\nRTIt =\t\n0\t\n\nif\n\nt#N\n\nwhere\nRTIr a\n\nr\t\n\nContribution of revenues from resale of the system to taxable income in year t, expressed in $r.\n\n- Capital gains fraction, the fraction of capital gains which is added to taxable intone.\n\n14 "One-halt" is used for simplicity in exposition. Currently, a consumer would be Used on 40% of the apical pin; a company\nwould pay 28% of the capital pin as (feAenl) income tax. Since Companies with taxable income in exosa of $100,000 pay a 46%\nmarSinal (Wetal) income tax rate, the effective friction is 28%/46% s 61%.

"Section 1245 property" is depreciable property which has been held more than 12 months and "which is...\nused as an integral part of ... i the I...furnishina of ... electrical energy" 1Tax Guide 1980, paragraph 9891. "Section 1250\nproperty" is all other depreciable property her.: -ore than 12 months 1Tax Guide 1980, paragraph 9901.\nWhile it is difficult to we how a system of the type under consideration in this document could be classified as anything other\nthan "Section 1245 property," classification as "Section 1250 property" would increase the attractiveness of investment, perhaps\nconsiderably. Such a classification. then, might be trade to provide an investment incentive.\nca lf the property is held longer than 100 months. some of the amount that would be treated as ordinary income will be treated as\ncapital gains. This refinement is ignored.\nU-29\n\nOnce the "ordinary incams" portion has been duwmbled. the test is "cap W piaWs ,:\ncu t = M4 - TVAL t -\xe2\x80\xa2 Olt\t\n\n(62)\n\n431 A Compeny-Owrled System\n\nIf a utility owns the system, afi of the financial benefits contribute to taxable income. Electrical energy\nproduced by the system Is sold (at the Well prim, riot the nonnative system energy price) to the utility\'s automats,\nthereby generating taxable revenues. Usable thermal energy reduces deductible expenses (perhaps by heating or\ncooling the control bud&& perhaps by e preheating the water in the utility\'s conventional stern turbines, etc.),\nthereby increasing the taxable income. The "nellback" revenue term Is retained because any "excess" energy right\nbe sold ("wheeled," in utility jargon) to another utility (in which can, the sellback p4ce e7 ,iV, should be based on\nan analysis of both utilities), stored for later use (in which cane, the seilback price Is the product of the retail price\nand all of the storagedestorage efficiendes), or dumped (in which sue the sdibak prke is zero \xe2\x80\x94 or perhaps even\nnegative if dumping of excess electrical energy is not free).\nIf a non-utility business owns the system, the effect on taxable income is the same, because utilities and businesses face the same t n tax environment (that which applies to corporation). The electrical energy produced by\nthe system does not necessarily create revenues, but it reduces deductible expenses, which has the same effect.\n\nThe effect on taxable income also includes allowable deductions and the possible gain from resale of the system.\nThus, from the financial benefit Equation (10), 11-9, deductible components from the annual cost Equation (38).\n11 .20, the resale contribution to taxable income, and the tax depreciation, the system-resultant effect on taxable\nincome is giver. by:\nST/r = [(1- at) pr+ arpt+or44t)b\'t +RTlr-(TDRPt+1NTr+OTXt+INSr+Xt)\t\n\n(63)\n\nwhere all of the terms have already been defined.\nUsing the income tax Equation (57),11 .26, and Equatior. (63\'1 for the effect on taxable income, the TAX, term\nmay be removed from the annual cost Equation (38), 11 .20, to give the year by year cost for a company-owned\nsystem:\nCosts = EQR t +r [(1 - at) p t +ar pr +ot\'Vt 1 Er+ [REPt +PDR s - RSL t - r(TDEPs - R Ti t )1\n- (17r;t\n\n+ STCd + 0 -\n\nt)\n\n[1NTt\n\n+ OTXt +\n\nINSt + X1 1\t\n\n(64)\n\nInspection of this equation reveals that the cost is the sum of\n(1) A return to the equity investors (that is, the stockholders) for the use of their money, EQR t .

All electrical and thermal energy that is\nsupplied directly to the consumer, without being sold to the utility, (I - o,)E,, reduces the electric bill (and possibly\nthe gas, fuel oil, and/or coal bill, as well) but has no effect on taxable income, since these expenses are not\ndeductible on personal income tax returna. Any sellback revenues are taxable, but all expenses, including\ndepreciation associated with producing the tastable income are deductible.

In addition, the system mud provida a reasonable rate of return on equity and pay the required\ninterest on debt. However. the (discounted) coat of equity and debt repayment. return on equity. and interest on\ndebt depend on the time schedule for the payments. For instance, in the usual cane where a system owner \'s cost of\ncapital is less than his rate of return on e9tity. but treater than the interest rate on debt. it would increase the net\npresent value of the system to mpay the equity investment as soon as possible and to delay debt repayment as long\nas possible.

The variation in debt value is determined by the capital\ninvestments and the loan repayment schedule, which is discussed for different kinds of owners in the next two\nsubsections. The information required for these calculations is obtained exogenously, so Equation ( 68) can be solved\nto obtain the equity portion of the total value:\nEVALt = BVALt -DVALr\t(70)\nFurthermore, Equation (69) can be solved to obtain the annual return of equity principal:\nREPt = BDEPt - PDR t\t(71)\nIn addition to repayment of loans and compensation for reductions in the value of equity, a reasonable 23\n(exogenously specified) return on investment must be paid to creditors and investors as \'long as their capital is in use.\n\n200ne purpose of this accounting convention is to provide a realistic measure of the market value of the equity-owned share of the\nassets. To the extent that the book valuation is designed to serve other purposes and to the extent that it does not amount for\ninflation or for speculation, it does not achieve this purpose.\n\n2 1 It is assumed that there are no "intangible" assets, such as "customer good -will," associated with the system under consideration.\n"The sinking fund approach of USES does not satisfy Equation (69).\n23 There is relatively little difficulty in determining an appropriate numerical value for the debt interest rate, but an appropriate\nnumerical value for the rate of return on equity is more difficult to come by. For companies, the weighted average of reasonable\nrates of return associated with the various kinds of stock offered will suffice.

The Discount Rate\n\nThe disawnt rate, denoted in this document by the symbol k, expresses the way in which the tuning of a cash\nflow affects the value of that cash flow, and is essential to the calculation of present values.\nDetermination of an appropriate value to use in a particular context may require a great deal of subtle analysis.\nIn the present context of determining a normative price, the task is much simpler: only a reasonable estimate of the\ndiscount rate a.)nsistent with the other numerical values used is required, rather than an estimate of the discount rate\nthat various kinds of owners either would or should 28 use. A reasonable, consistent estimate can be obtained for the\nkinds of owners cwnsidered here from financial parameters already introduced.\n26 11\n\nmay be noted that the basis for determination of the discount rate for deciding whether or not to invest in a particular\nsystem, for all types of owners, is the opportunity cost - the return that could be obtained if the funds were invested elsewhere.\nThe two major difficulties in making such a determination are in measwing the returns (because non-financial benefits should also\n\nbe considered) and in measuring and accounting for the uncertainties. Even identifying the best alternative can be very difficult.\n\n11-37\n\nFirst, when the owner is a regulated utility, we may note that one of the objectives of the regulatory bodies is to\nmaintain equivalence between the utility\'s internal rate of return and the weighted average after-tax opportunity\ncost of investment. if it is assumed that the company has enough other projects (besides the system under consideration) to obtain or deposit funds to cover any temporary imbalances between current revenues and current expenses\ndue to the project within the company (cf [Doane 1976, p. B-2) ), then the discount rate \xe2\x80\x94 on the average \xe2\x80\x94 is the\ncompany\'s internal rate of return. Hence, for a regulated utility as owner of the system under consideration (cf\n[Doane 1976, Equation (B.1), p. B -21 ),\n\nk = (1 - r) (k a 1\n\t\n\ni\n\nt\n\n(96)\n\n(a / r\t\n\nA municipally-owned utility has no income tax liability, and capitalization is typically by debt only (that is.\nA = \xe2\x80\x94). Consequently, unless the munic4ullyowned udfity makes \' payments in deu of taxes ", the discount rate is\nsimply the cost of debt to the public borrower (cf [Doane 1976, Equation (8.1 ), p. B-31),\n(97)\n\nk = i\t\n\nIn a non -regulated company, a realistic estimate of the discount rate that should be used could be obtained by\nconsidering the expected internal rate cf return of the best investments available to the company other than the\nsystem under consideration but of comparable size, taking into account the risk associated with those alternatives.\nHowever, while obtaining the discount rate in that manner would be appropriate to a venture analysis, it would not\nbe appropriate in the context of normative pricing. Instead, the objective is very similar to that of the agencies\nresponsible for setting prices for regulated utilities. Thus, Equation (96) gives the discount rate for all corporate\nowners, whether regulated or not.\nThe appropriate discount rate for consumers may be approximated by what it costs to obtain money. 29 There\nare, in general, two possible sources: savings ( that is, bank deposits or the foregoing of other investment\nopportunities) and loans. Hence, for a private individual,\n(98)\n\nk = the larger of (I - T) r or (1 - 7) i\t\n\nThe multiplications by (1 - r) are due to the facts that interest revenues are taxable and interest payments are\ndeductible on individual tax returns.\n4.4.2. Other (than Income) Taxes\nNon-income taxes consist primarily of property (ad valorem) taxes, which are a constant fraction of the taxable\nvalue of goods. It is assumed that non-capital goods have negligible value and that taxes are paid on the current\nvalue:\n\nOTX t =\n\nR t TVAL t\t\n\n(99)\n\n29 `ery peculiar results can be obtained if the discount rate, as calculated by tquation (96) OF any other means, comes out to be\nthan or even equal to the largest escalation rate. Specifically, suppose the discount rate chosen is less than the general rate of\ninflation. Then, the investor is theoretically indifferent between receipt of a given amount of money now (say 1.00 $ 199D in\n1980) and a smaller amount of money After (say 0.98 Slyyi^pp which is, say, 1.06 S\t\nin 1981). This is not realistic. The discount\nlc%%\n\nrate used must be at least as high as the genetal rate o[ innuim; perhaps it shod be at least as high as the largest escalation rate\nfaced by the investor.\n11.38\n\nwhere\nP, - "Other" (non4ncome) tax rate, expressed as a fraction (per year) of taxable value.\nThe taxable value of capital, TVALt , is given by Equation (SO), Il-2S, and depends upon the tax environment\nof the system owner:\n(1) If a utUtty owns the system, the taxable value of capital is normally equal (11-25) to the accounting book\nvalue, and is also known as the "ate base."\n\n,t\t\n\n(2) If a non-wNty business owns the system, its tax books and accounting books may legally be different, due\nto differences between tax lives and accounting lives of apital goods and due to differences in depreciation\nmethods used.\n(3) The cvnsfana\'s taxable value of capital might vary only by reassessment, since the system is likely to be\nconsidered as part of the house.\n4.4.3. Insurance Premiums\nThe cost of insurance is based on replacement values, rather than depreciated values. Hence, cf. Equations (391\nand (40),11.22.\nINStr\n\n= 0 2 C1 01 (1 + 6d (1 +gd t for\n\nINSt\n\n=\n\n(100)\n\nt > t/\t\n\n(101)\n\nX/ INS/t\t\n\nwhere\n[i2\n4.4.4\n\n= Insurance rate, expressed in % (per year).\n\nInvestment and Solar Tax Credits\n\nInvestment tax credits are available as a rather complicated function 30 (see [Chamberlain 1979, pp. 32 to 331 )\nthe tax life of the capital goods purchased. For simplicity, it is assumed here that all capital goods have a\nsufficiently long tax life to obtain the full investment tax credit rate. Thus,\nof\n\nac,\n\n(102)\n\n= p3 a,\t\n\nwhere\n0 3 = Investment tax credit rate,J0 expressed as a fraction of capital investment.\n\nJe Aceording to current law, a tax life of 7 or more years will allow a credit of 10% (1176 if certain profit sharing poficics are\nfollowed in a company). A tax life between S and 7 years &lbws 2/3 of the full rate. A tax fife between 3 and S years allows 113.\nNo credit is allowed if the tax life is less than 3 years. A user of this methodology may modify the value of A 3 to account for these\nfractions, if desired.\n\nU-39\n\nThe investment tax credits can be taken (to the extent that the investment be used to,ererate taxable revenues)\nwhenever a capital investment is made, whether for initial purchase or for replacement of hardware.\nin sonic locations and under some eircurnstanees, additional tax credits are available to encourage investment in\nsolar energy systems. When those credits can be obtained for replacement purchases, as well as for initial purchase,\nthe tax credit rate should be included in 03 and Equation (102) should be used.\n\nE\n\'\t\n\nSome solar tax credits, however, are available only for initial purchase. Thus,\n\nS7Ct - a4 E\nall / such\nthat t--ti\n\n(103)\n\nC11 \t\n\nwhere\n\n31\n\nS4 = Solar (one-time only ) tax credit rate, expressed as a fraction of capital investment.\n"One-time only" tax benefits do not usually have to be taken as soon as possible, as is assumed by Equation (103).\nThe APSEAM computer model [Davis 19801 does not make this simplification.\n\n4.4.5. Expanses\nExpenses include operations, maintenance, fuel, and so on. Expenses for operations consist mostly of labor.\nMaintenance expenses consist of a mixture of labor, supplies, and materials, but do not include the costs of\nreplacement components, for these are assumed to be capital expenditures. These different kinds of expenses may\nhave significantly different escalation rates, in which case the expense term should be replaced by a suitable\nsummation.\nEach kind of expense is assumed to increase with time at a constant escalation rate and to be proportional to\nthe nameplate size of the systems:\nXb\nXt =\t\n\n`tX (1 +gX\n\nXb I\n\n) r (Z1Z)+x t \'V - (1 +gX )t\n\nt .

Life Cycle Coat and Residual System Coat\nNow that expressions for all of the cost components in the cost Equation (67),11-32, are available, that equation may be used to determine life cycle cost from Equation (6), 11 .6, and the cost part of the residual system\nvalue from Equation (8),11-6.

Capital Recovery\nCapital recovery coats consist of the repayment of Investment and of the payLAM of a normative return on\nreturn\ninvestment. The fbmciai environment of the owner affects the submodel for the\non investment, so it is\nconvenient to express these two cost components separately:\nLCCC - LMop +LCCON\n\n\t\n\n(115)\n\nwhere\nLCCoF - Sum of the present values of all provisions for the return of equity principal and for debt retirement\n\nduring the system lifetime, expressed in 3e.\nLOCON - Sum of the present values of the net (after taxes) costs of providing the normative (that is.\n\nexogenously specified as "reasonable\') return on equity and interest on debt. expressed in ,1p.\nThus, from Equation (108). 1142,\nN\n\nLCCoF -\n\nE\n\nPV {REP, +PDR, - RSL, }\t\n\n(116)\n\nt=tf\nN\n\nLCCoN\n\n= F,\n\n\t (EQR, + (I - r) INT, )\t\n\n(117)\n\nt=tf\n\t Investment\n\n4.5.1.1 Return\n\nEquation (116) can be expressed in terns of the capital investments as follows.

If this occurs, it is appropriate, because the investors rust be repaid their investments even if\nthe system is decommissioned or sold. If the system is sold, the resale revenues provide some or all of the funds for\nthe repayment; if it is decommissioned. financial bandits from operation of the system will have to provide all of\nthe funds needed.\nThe summation over T can be evaluated explicitly if the depredation method is known.

Strictly\nspeaking, the fraction of that excess that would be recovered is not given by a t unless the sell-back fraction, o r, is\nconstant for t = 1, ... , N. The fraction recovered should be the weighted average of a t over that period, but the\nadditional complexity required to account for this nuance has been purposely omitted from this 33 model. A conservative result (conservative in the sense that It may slightly overestimate the effect on cost) can be obtained by\nusing the sell - back fraction for the first year, a. Now, obtaining the contribution to taxable income, RTIr, from\nEquation ( 58), II.28, and using the definition of present value Equation ( 1), II-2, Equation ( 155),1I-50, may be\nrewritten as;\n\nLCCRt = 4^s(i+k (YCGN + OIN )\t\n\n(160)\n\nFrom Equation (61),11.29, the ordinary income is given by\nOIN = RF { min [RSL r , p PVR + (1 - p) STVAL N ] - TV. 4L N }\t\n\n(161)\n\nand, from Equation (62),11-30, the capital gains income is given by\n\nC1GN = RSL N -TVAL N -OIN\t(162)\nSince resale of the system, if it occurs at all, takes place at the end of the system lifetime, there is no\ncontribution to residual cost. Further, the total cost is calculated as if the system is never resold, so there is no\ncontribution to it either.\nThus, from Equation ( 153), I1-49, and its unstated residual and total cost analogues,\n\nO\n\nLCCD . p = Ei CI LCC J tdepLcic j sl,s (I + k)N (Y CGN + 01N)\n\n(163)\n\nRSCDE _ \'"j\n\n(164)\n\nCIRSC,i tdepRSC,j\n\nCOSTDEP = Ej CI vj tdep,,j\n\n(165)\n\n4.5.3 Investment Tax Credits\nInvestment tax credits are a simple multiple of capital investments, but investments that are made precisely at\ncontribute to residual system cost, rather than life cycle cost. Consequently, combining Equation (102),11.39,\nand Equation ( 110), 11-42,\nt=N\n\n32 The effect on capital gains income of a market price below the depreciated value of the system is ignored here.

NET PRESENT VALUE RECAPrML.AIM\n\nIt is now possible to evaluate the net present value of the system under consideration, which was defined in\nEquation (2),113.\nThe net present value includes consideration of all benefits and costs resulting from Insta lit and operating the\nsystem. If thr svitem Is resold or decommissioned, those benefits and costs atop (from the point of view of the\ninvestor) abrurt:y. The net p:esaa! values in these two soantriol (\' " or "nestle") we presented separately\nin the next two subsections, partly because doing so reduces the complexity of the resuita.it equations, but mainly\nbecause it is anticipated that most users will find only one of the two stxnatios relevant.\n5.1. Without Resale Of The System (A - 0)\nIf the system is not resold, the net present value can be obtained by substituting Equations (23),11 . 13, and\n(209),11.58, directly into Equation (2),11-3, which produces\n\nNPV - ((1- o)(P- rwp)spm v +a(1 -tw)ptpm\xe2\x80\x9e\n+a (1 - r)& bpnt j E - E, Gv! cMW\t\n\n(21\'-)\n\nXsV\nOf course, unless the systtmn owner can realize a different value for energy produced by this system (but not sold\nback to the grid) than the grid price. the numerical value of P should be the grid price (p) in all calculations except\n\nwhen the normative system energy price is the desired result of the computation.\n5.2. With Resale Of The System (A - 1)\nIf the system is resold, Equation (2). 11 .3, cannot be used d rectly. instead the definitions of Equations (3).\ni\nU-4. through (9),11 .7, may be used in Equation (2}. to obtain\nNPV -REV - LCC + RSV\n\n\t\n\n(213)\n\nwhere. in this tvintext.

BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS\nThe term "break-even" is often used to mean that the benefits obtained from the system just equal the costs\nincurred. The general idea here is the same, except that\n(1) a "reasonable" profit is considered to be one of the costs that must be recovered, so that "breaking-even"\nimplies making the specified rate of return on equity, and\n(2) the time value of money, due to both inflation and discounting, is taken into account, rather than ignored,\nso that an investment of D dollars must be repaid by more than D dollars to "break-even".\nExplicitly, as discussed in Section 2.3, the system is considered to be a break- even investment if the net present value\nis zero.\nThe following subsections provide solutions or solution procedures for the values of various parameters that\nsatisfy the equation NPV = 0. In some cases, it will be seen that there is no realizable solution (as, for example,\nwhen a break-even price comes out to be negative). The symbol "^" is used to indicate break-even values.\n6.1. Normative System Energy Prices\nThe nonnative system energy price is hereby defused as the average inflating marginal price of energy produced\nby the system, assuming the system owner continues to own, maintain, and operate the system for an indefinitely\nlong period of time. Thus, it corresponds to the Busbar Energy Cost levelized in real terms (BBEC) of USES, not the\nBusbar Energy Cost levelized in nominal terms ( IM. In this definition:\n"Average" implies a "flat-rate" pricing structure. "Inflating" implies increases with time at the rate of energy price\nescalation. "Marginal" implies that, although the effect of the system on other operations is charged (or credited) to\nthe system, system costs and benefits are not averaged with those of other operations. "Price" is used instead of\n"cost" because profit -- and other "general and administrative" expenses \xe2\x80\x94 are included.\nSetting Equation (212), 11-60, to zero and solving for P gives the following expression for the normative system\nenergy price:\n\n^\nP\t 1;/\n\nC1 viccmVf + Xs xpm^\n+ [r w - (1 - r) a tpn,^] p - a (1 - z) bpm^\n\n0 - o) E spmV\n\n(216)\n\nThe break-even sellback price fulfills the same role as the normative system energy price if a major portion of\nthe energy generated is sold to the utility. Since the PURPA regulations [ FERC 19801 require the utility to pay a\nprice that reflects its net avoided cost, that price could be considerably higher than the grid energy price, particularly\nif the system under consideration tends to produce energy at times when the utility \'s marginal cost of generation is\nhigh.\n\nII-62\n\n\t\n\nAgain setting Equation (212),11 .60, to zero, and replacing P by p, then solving for the break-even seAback price\n\ngives:\n\nE/ a,,/ ccm,./ + Xs xpm , (1 - a) (1 - r w) spm , + (1 - r w) a tpm\xe2\x80\x9e\np\na (1 - r) E bpm V\ta (1 - r) bpm,\t\n\n(217)\n\nResale of the system could affect these break-even prices.

Initial System Capital\nThe net present value Equation (212), 1160, contains a weighted sum of component prices, rather than the\nunweighted sum implied by Equation (41),11-23:\nC = Ei Ci\t\n\n(228)\n\nwhere\nC = Initial system capital, expressed in $b.\nIf we assume, however, that component prices are exogenously known fractions35 of the total price \xe2\x80\x94 that is:\n\n(229)\n\nCi = fi C\t\n\ni\n\nwhere\n\nfi = Price of capital goods of type j, expressed as a fraction of the initial system capital,\n\nOne possible source for values of those fractions is the goals of the research and development program.\n11.64\n\ni\n\nthen Equation (212),11-60, after P is replaced by p and NPV is set to zero, may be rewritten and solved for C to give\nthe bmak-even initial system capital:\nC = ( { [(1 - a) (1- r w) spm. + ( 1- r) a tpm\xe2\x80\x9e] p + a (1- r).* bpm\xe2\x80\x9e ) E - X. xpm,)l El f ccM V/\t\n\n(230)\n\nThe component prices associated with the break-even initial system capital are obtained by applying Equation (229),\nU-65:\n\nCl = fl\n\nC\t\n\n(231)\n\nfor all/\t\n\nNote that the C, given by Equation (224), 11-64, requires component J to provide all of the savings needed (if any);\nthe Cj given here shares the "burden" among all of the components.\n6.4. Other Exogenous Variables\nBreak-even values of other exogenous variables, such as component lifetimes (one of which may determine the\nsystem revitalization period enter Equation (212), 11-60, in a complex fashion. (it is not valid, for example, to\nobtain Lj by solving Equation (224),11-64, for L f , because Li enters into cem^i as well.) They can be determined by\nmultiple evaluations of Equation (212), 11.60, starting from scratch each time, using an appropriate procedure for\nselecting successive values of the parameter of interest, until the computed value of NPV is sufficiently close to zero.\n(in performing these calculations, note that P should be set equal to p.)\n\n.\n\nU-65\n\n7. OTHER FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThe net present value of a potential investment is one of the most important financial estimates available to a\nventure capitalist. Its components \xe2\x80\x93 the life cycle revenues, the life cycle costs, and the residual system value \xe2\x80\x93 are\nalso of considerable interest. These are not, however, the only criteria on which investment decisions are based. The\nliquidity requirement \xe2\x80\x93 the maximum cumulative negative cash flow (that is, how "deep in the hole" the investment\ngets before it starts paying off), or the present value of the liquidity required (the equivalent amount that would\nhave to be in the bank at some point in time) \xe2\x80\x93 is also crucial. Non-quantitative criteria \xe2\x80\x93 such as the esthetic appeal\nof the system \xe2\x80\x93 are also relevant. Risk and uncertainty have been assumed in the present analysis to be accounted\nfor by the numerical values of the required rate of return on equity and the debt interest rate; a venture capitalist\nwould be more comfortable if these factors were explicit.\nThe normative system energy price is one of the most important financial estimates available for assessing the\nstate of the art. The total initial cost of the system is also very important.\nThese issues, and others, are discussed in the remainder of this section.\n7.1. Working Capital\nOne of the kinds of capital required is working capital, the amount of capital which must be injected into the\nsystem to get it operating once it exists. Working capital may be modeled as follows:\nC. = Ei s- Ci + 1 OAR\t\n\n(232)\n\nwhere the summation on j covers all kinds of capital goods except working capital, and\ns = Spares fraction fcr capital goods of type j, expressed in dollars per dollar (a dimensionless number in\ncomputation). The numerical value depends on the specific system design; a small system will often\nhave no spares.\nOperating period coverage fraction, the fraction (of a year) for which the system owner must be able to\ncover operating expenses out of working capital. The numerical value of this factor is determined by\nthe "lumpiness" of revenue and cost cash flows and by the differences in their timing. If the owner has\nsufficient flexibility to defer payment of costs, without penalties, the numerical value could be iero.\nOPR =\n\nNet annual operating expenses of the system under consideration, expressed in base year dollars (per\nyear). Equation (233) approximates its value in terms of more fundamental parameters.\n\nThe net annual operating expense can be approximated by multiplying the non-capital portions of\nEquation (216), 11 .62, which gives the marginal cost of energy generation and takes into account the effect of the\nsystem on other expenses that the owner might have, by the annual amount of energy produced:\nX b zpm\n\nOPR =\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nP +(\n\n(l - a)spmy\n\nirw-(1-r)atpm.ip-a(1-r)bpm \xe2\x96\xba,)E\t\n\n1166\n\n(233)\n\nIt should be noted that working capital does not depreciate, but that the amount required does increase with\ntime due to inflation. Thus,\n\nDLW\n\n= 00\n\n\t\n\n(234)\n\n\xc2\xb5w = "RA" with g = g$\t\n\n(235)\n\n6\t\n\nwhere\n\nDLW , \xc2\xb5w = Parameters DLl and p/ (see II.24) for capital goods of type j = w (working capital).\n"RA"\t\n\n= Depreciation method "reassessment". (See Appendix B.)\n\ng\t\n\n= Growth rate parameter associated with the "reassessment" depreciation method.\n\ngs\t= General inflation rate, expressed in % (per year).\n7.2. Liquidity Requirement\nThe owner of the system incurs costs before starting to receive revenues. This fact implies that the owner must\nbe able to survive a deficit of some amount for an investment in the system to be financially viable. The maximum\nsize of that deficit is the liquidity requirement.\nr\n\nQt\n\n=E\n\n(236)\n\n(CostT - Bene/1\n1Y\t\n\nT<tf\n\nwhere\nQ t\t= Liquidity requirement at time t, expressed in year t dollars.\n\nCostT\t\n\n= Cost in year T, expressed in year T dollars. (See Equation (67),11.32.)\n\nBenefit = Financial benefit in year T, expressed in year T dollars. (See Equations (19) and (20), I1-13.)\nNote that Equation (236) contains the assumption that all financial benefits reduce liquidity requirements. (If it did\nnot contain that assumption, the resultant liquidity requirements would be likely to grow without bound.) It also\nassumes that costs and benefits occur at the times called for by their submodels. If this assumption provides too\ncoarse an estimate in a particular application of the present model, the user is hereby directed to [Davis 19801.\nApplication of the current model with monthly resolution (see 11 .5) rather than yearly resolution could reduce that\ncoarseness considerably.\n\n11.67\n\n1\n\nThe maximum liquidity requirement is obtained from the liquidity requirement at time t by finding that time,\nsay t\', for which Qt takes on its largest value. \'Thus,\nQmdX = max r Q t\n\n(237)\n\n- Qt,\t\n\nwhere\nQm\'U = Maximum liquidity requirement, expressed in year t* dollars.\nA more meaningful definition of the initial capital requhvnient than that provided in Section 4.2.2,11 .23, and\nused in Section 6.3, 11-65, is the funding that the owner would need at the time of the first cash flow, tr, so that his\nfunds in hand would never be entirely gone. Its value could be determined by finding that value of Qf in the follow-\n\ning equation that makes the minimum value of BALt equal to zero.\nr\n\nBAL t\n\n= Q f (1 + k)t +\t\n\n( 238)\n\n(BenefrtT - COSY X (1 + k) t-T\t\n\nT= rf\n\nwhere\nBAL I = Balance in a hypothetical investment account that eams at the discount rate and is used to meet all\ncosts and receive all financial benefits, expressed in year tdollars.\nQ\n\n= Initial capital requirement, the amount that must be put into that hypothetical investment account\njust before the first cash flow at time t f so as to have that account never go negative, expressed in year\nt f dollars.\n\nDetermination of the value of Q. requires a search over all values of t in the range tf\nimplies Q f is likely to be closer to t" than to if.\n\n< t < t*. the value of t ilia[\n\n7.3. Time-Variable Rates\nAll of the analyses presented here assume constant inflation, escalation, interest, and required return on equity\nrates. It is likely that these rates will actually change with time. To the extent that they all change in exact\nsynchronism with the rate of general inflation, such variations will have no effect on the results 36 . To the extent\nthat they vary independently, the model will give less accurate results.\n\n36 This is due to the tact that results are stated in (base year) constant dollars and that none of the costs or benefits are non-linear\nwith the value of a dollar. If the income tax model had not assumed a fixed marginal tax rate, this would not have been true.\n\nIl."\n\n8. SIMPLIFICATION AND SYNTHESIS\nFinally, everything needed to determine normative system energy prices, net present values, break-even\nparameter values, etc. has been delineated. All that remains is to put it together into a usable computational\nalgorithm. Even if that were done next, however, the result would be so formidable that few of the intended users\nwould bother with it, so that .,ome simplification is required before proceeding (back) to Volume 1.\nThe following simplifications will be made before synthesizing the algorithm:\n(1) The sellback fraction and thermal energy value will be assumed constant:\nor = o and at = a for all t > 0\t\n\n(239)\n\n(2) The system will be assumed to be a quickly constructed, "turn-key" installation:\n(240)\n\nto = 0 and t f = 0\t\n(3) Only "straight line" depreciation will be considered.\n\xc2\xb5/ =\n\n"SL" for all % if the owner is a company\t\n\n(241)\n\n(4) Possible resale of the system will be ignored.\nA=O\n\t\n\n(242)\n\nThe general a,gorithm in Appendix A of Volume I was developed by following the same approach as in this section\nbut without these simplifying assumptions.\n8.1.

It would not be correct, however, to conclude that the residc::d\nsystem value is being ignored. On the contrary, exclusion of the residual system value from the definition of the net\npresent value would have contributed significantly to the complexity of its calculation.\nThe starting point for a calculation of the residual system value would be Equation (215),11-61.\n\n11.76\n\nI\n\n8.3. SimpliRed Normative System Energy Prices\nFrom this point on it gets considerably easier because there is only one new endogenous element and only three\nnew exogenous elements to be required. That is, everything else (except the hdtial system capital) can be calculated\nfrom information already available in this section.\nThe normative system energy price is given by Equation (216), U-62:\nE, a. ccm ^^ + Xb xpm 1\ncmq spm^\t\n\n+ [r w - (1 - 7) a tpm^, ] p - a (1 - r)d* bpm. \t\n\n(269)\n\nTim is also the marginal price of system electrical energy generation (averaged \xe2\x80\x94 with discounting \xe2\x80\x94 over time), and\ncorresponds to the constant (in cons. nt energy dollars) busbar energy price (BBEC.) of USES.\nThe break-even sellback price is given by Equation ( 217),11.63,\n\nVi CCM V/ +Xb xpm.\' (1 - a) (I - r w) Wtn V +(1 - r) a tpmV\np\t\na 0 - r) bpm,\t\na (1 - r) E bpm\xe2\x80\x9e\t\n\nE C1\n\ni\n\n=\t\n\n(270)\n\n8.4.

DEPRECIATION\nAs noted in the body of the text in Section 4.2.3,11-24, on capital valuation, the change in value of capital\ngoods with time can be represented, as in Equation (45),11 .24, by a function. That is,\ni\nk\t\n\nVALA\t\n\nVAL sch(A,DL,\xc2\xb5,B)\t\n\n(B\xe2\x80\xa21)\n\n5\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwhere\nVAL A\t=\n\nValue of capital goods of age A, expressed in nominal dollars.\n\nVAL\t\n\n= Purchase price of the capital goods, expressed in nominal dollars.\n\nA\t\n\n= Age of the capital goods, expressed in years.\n\nDL\t\n\n= Depreciable lifetime of the capital goods, expressed in years.\n\n\xc2\xb5\t\n\n= Depreciation method to be used.\n\n8\t\n\n= Salvage value, expressed as a fraction of the purchase price.\n\nsch (A, DL, \xc2\xb5, 8) = Schedule function for capital goods of age A when the depreciable life is DL, the\ndepreciation method is \xc2\xb5, and the salvage value fraction is 8. This function expresses the\nvalue of the capital goods as a fraction of the purchase price, and is identically equal to\nzero if the age is negative (because the capital goods have not yet been purchased.)\nAs pointed out in the discussion leading to Equation (46), 11-25, depreciation is the change in capital value from\none year to the next:\nDEPA = VAL A-1 - VAL A\t(B-2)\nwhere\nDEPA\n\n= Depreciation of capital goods now of age A. expressed in nominal dollars.\n\nBy substituting Equation (B-1) into Equation (B-2), we have\n\nDEPA = VAL [sch(A-1, DL,\xc2\xb5,0)-sch(A,DL,\xc2\xb5,0)1\t\n\n(8-3)\n\nReplacing the content of the brackets by the depreciation junction, we have\n\nDEPA = VAL dep (A, DL,\xc2\xb5, 8)\t\n\n(B-4)\n\nwhere\n\ndep(A,DL,\xc2\xb5,0) = sch(A-1,DL,\xc2\xb5,B)-sch(A,DL,\xc2\xb5,B) \t\nH-B-1\n\n(8-5)\n\nLl. Straight Une Depreciation\n\n\'\t\nR\t\n}\t\n\nThe simplest model of decrease in value b called "ttraisht line". This model assumes that value decreases lin\xe2\x80\xa2\nearly over its lifetime from an initial fraction of unity to the final salvage value fraction S. This model accurately\ndescribes the amount of usefulness left in the capital goods if that usefulness occurs uniformly over time.

Sum Of The Years\' DWts Depreciation\n"Accelerated" depreciation methods correspond to the r sumption that value decreases more rapidly at first\nthan it does later.

Double Dwlb tg Blame Depreciation\nMother class of accelerated depreciation methods has an exponential schedule function: the depreciation each\nyear is a fraction of the current deprectited value ( \' he "dedining balame"). The fraction taken must be between one\nand two times that which would be taken if the straight L \'ne method were used. The greatest shift in timing is\nobtained b y using the factor of two (hence, "double"). When the age reaches half the lifetime, however, straight line\ndepreciation of the remaining depreciable value would give a large: depredation deduction than continuing to use\nthe same fraction of the declining balance.

Reassessment (and No) Depreciation\nSome capital goods, such as land and working capital ( and the entire energy generation system if owned by a\nconsumer who derives no taxable income from its operation - that is, who sells no energy back to the utility),\nare not depreciable. but they are subject to property taxation.
