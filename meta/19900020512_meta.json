Research conducted over the past several years on 3-D spatial instruments has shown that perspective displays, even when viewed from the correct viewpoint, are subject to systematic viewer biases. These biases interfere with correct spatial judgements of the presented pictorial information. The design of spatial instruments may not only require the introduction of compensatory distortions to remove the naturally occurring biases but also may significantly benefit from the introduction of artificial distortions which enhance performance. However, these image manipulations can cause a loss of visual-vestibular coordination and induce motion sickness. Consequently, the design of head-mounted spatial instruments will require an understanding of the tolerable limits of visual-vestibular discord.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Belgium*United States", "submissionId": 19900020512, "endDate": "1987-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AGARD Meeting of the Aerospace Medicine Panel", "location": "Brussels", "id": "e85ecc5173174be6880eecb6b5eaf174", "startDate": "1987-09-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900020512, "id": "7a239c2805ef4b7394a5f68ed18ec157", "publicationName": "JPL, California Inst. of Tech., Proceedings of the NASA Conference on Space Telerobotics, Volume 3", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900020512.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900020512/downloads/19900020512.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900020512/downloads/19900020512.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900020512/downloads/19900020512.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
