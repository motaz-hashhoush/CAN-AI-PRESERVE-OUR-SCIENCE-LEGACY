As a craftsman, he distinguished himself as one of the foremost builders of clocks. He also built magnetic compasses and surveying instruments. The finest examples of his craftsmanship are considered two orreries, mechanical solar systems. In terms of astronomical observations, his best-known contribution was his observation of the transit of Venus in 1769. Rittenhouse constructed the first diffraction grating. Working as Treasurer of Pennsylvania throughout the Revolution, he became the first director of the Mint in 1792. Astronomical observations in later life included charting the position of Uranus after its discovery.", "title": "America's foremost early astronomer", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T23:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950055754, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rubincam, David Parry"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "55d5687df6614ff1b774b73b68f58a6e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950055754, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rubincam, Milton, II"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "196c4b5eaec64809843636db2f22d5ba"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950055754, "publications": [{"volume": "89", "submissionId": 19950055754, "issue": "5", "issn": "0037-6604", "id": "a9508352fd674420a13c90f38d8e4e3b", "publicationName": "Sky & Telescope", "publicationDate": "1995-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
