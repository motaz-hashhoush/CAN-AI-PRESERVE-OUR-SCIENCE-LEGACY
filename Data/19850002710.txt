b'OPPORTUNITIES\n\nFOR SPACE BIOPROCESSING\n\nMilan Bier\nBiophysics Technology Laboratory\nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona 85721\n\nABSTRACT\nSpace bioprocessing has been thrust into an unexpected limelight as a result of the\npioneering McDonnell Douglas/Johnson & Johnson experiments in continuous flow electrophoresis. Thus, there is an urgent need to reassessthe opportunities and pitfalls in this area\nof space commercialization.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s program of space bioprocessing may become the unwitting beneficiary of equally\nrevolutionary recent ground-based developments in genetic engineering and other allied areas of\napplied biology. As a result of these advances, a number of important new biologicals have\nbecome available in unlimited quantities, subject only to the proviso that adequate purification\nmethods can be devised. It is not an exaggeration to state that the need for ultimate purity is\na major bottleneck in this emerging industry. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s space bioprocessing program may become\na key factor, as mandated by ever increasing needs for sophistication in purification technologies.\nOur process of recycling isoelectric focusing is characterized by very high purity of final\nproducts. A key question is whether space provides sufficient advantages over our ground-based\nprocess. A first pilot experiment is planned for STS 11, scheduled for January 29th. While\nprimarily an experiment in basic science, it was designed to provide crucial information on the\nlikely performance of focusing in a microgravity environment.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is a pleasure to participate in this Symposium on Space Industrialization.\nThe opportunity to do so is particularly appreciated in view of the successful McDonnell Douglas/Johnson\n& Johnson space electrophoresis experiments. They have suddenly thrust us into a radically new\nera of industrialization of space. With it, they have imposed on us, the other space-concerned\nbiotechnologists, the need to reassessthe opportunities and pitfalls of operations in space.\nIn this context, I will address the following points: (1) The need for improved purification technologies; (2) the role of electrophoresis; and (3) isoelectric focusing.\n\nPURIFICATION\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nWe are in the midst of a revolution in applied biology due to advances in genetic\nengineering and the allied fields of monoclonal antibodies, synthesis or isolation of individual\n\n60\n\ngenes and solid phase synthesis of peptide hormones. The social and economic impacts of this\nnew biotechnology have been amply covered in the scientific as well as lay press, including an\nauthoritative review by the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress (1).\nThese technologies have rendered possible the production of virtually unlimited quantities of important new biologics, which were previously available only in minute quantities.\nInterferon, human growth hormone, a foot and mouth disease vaccine, are but a few of such\npharmaceuticals which can be cited as examples.\nIt should be emphasized that these biologics are often fast obtained in the form of\ncrude extracts, heavily contaminated by extraneous matter. For example, in recombinant DNA,\na gene, coding for the desired pharmaceutical, is implanted into bacteria or yeast, thereby\n\xe2\x80\x9cengineering\xe2\x80\x9d the microorganism to produce a protein which it normally does not synthesize.\nThe new protein has to be separated from the myriad of other proteins native to the microorganism. Similarly, monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybrid cells, obtained through the\nfusion of an antibody-producing lymphocyte and a cancerous cell. It is the cancerous moiety\nwhich confers to the hybrid its ability to rapidly reproduce. Again, the monoclonal antibodies\nneed to be separated from the other proteins of the hybrid cell. The magnitude of the problem\ncan best be visualized if one realizes that the host cells, the modified microorganism or the\nhybrid, may contain well over 5,000 different proteins, only one of which is the desired active\nprinciple.\nThe utmost in purity is essential for any of these products to be administered to a\npatient. Present purification technology is as much an art as a science, and is often a major\nbottleneck in production. It mostly involves a series of purification steps, artfully sequenced\nuntil the required purity is obtained. Chromatography is the main workhorse, and the whole\nprocess is costly and inefficient - at times only a minute fraction of total material synthesized\nis obtained in purified form.\nWe are only at the beginning of this revolution in biology. Modified plants and animals\nare on the horizon. It is indisputable that these advances will require ever increasing sophistication in the art of separation and purification. Thus, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s program is the unwitting beneficiary of these new developments and may become of crucial importance for future biotechnology.\nMany of the biologics are in a price range which could justify space processing. Their\nunit value may exceed millions or tens of millions of dollars per kilogram. On the other hand,\ntotal demand may be only a few kilograms annually. Any new separation process has to have\nhigh resolution and high yield, that is, isolate the desired product in high purity and with\nminimal losses.\nELECTROPHORESIS\nElectrophoresis is a most elegant technique for the separation of complex mixtures of\nbiological origin. Because of its unique usefulness, a great variety of instruments have been\ndeveloped and these are used in literally thousands of laboratories the world over. Most of this\nusage, however, is confined to analytical applications only, and is of little relevance to the task\nat hand, namely the purification of pharmaceuticals on an industrial scale.\n\n61\n\nAt present, a paradoxical situation prevails. Analytical electrophoresis,., m-particular the\nso-called two-dimensional ele.ctrophoresis, offers the highest resolution of :any separative -technique and is routinely utilized for quality control in the production of biologicals., Nevertheless,.\nno form of electrophoresis is utilized for the actual production of ,these compounds. In the past\nthe requisite instruments may not have been available, but this is no longer true., It should be\nemphasized, however, that no single technique, chromatographic or: electrophoretic, can be a\npanacea for all separation problems. Instead, they all should be considered as components of an\nincreasingly more complex armamentarium of purification methods, to be integrated in an overall\nproduction scheme.\nThree electrophoretic instruments are presently available for large scale processing:\n1. The McDonnell Douglas continuous flow electrophoresis apparatus.- T-his type of\ninstrument was pioneered by Prof. Hannig of Germany. In ground-based operation, Hannig\xe2\x80\x99s\ninstruments were characterized by rather limited resolution and throughput. Thus, it was rarely\nused for separation of proteins, its main application being in research with living cells.\nThe McDonnell Douglas apparatus was superbly engineered and performed well in the\nmicrogravity environment. This was certainly no mean achievement. Most important is their\nclaim of greatly increased throughput, rather than high purity.\n2. For the past ten to fifteen years, Dr. Thompson at the Harwell Atomic Energy\nEstablishment in England has been developing a centrifugal electrophoresis apparatus of a\nradically new design, first proposed by Prof. Philpot, some 40 years ago. It is an impressive\nmachine, for which large throughputs are claimed. It is marketed under the tradename\nBIOSTREAM by John Brown Limited of Portsmouth, U.K., but has become available only quite\nrecently. As a result, its actual performance in daily usage is still largely undocumented.\n3. The Recycling Isoelectric Focusing Apparatus (RIEF), developed in my laboratory\nunder NASA\xe2\x80\x99s sponsorship. The RIEF was first proposed for operation in microgravity, but it\nproved to be quite effective in its ground-based operation. Schering Corporation, and Ely Lilly\nLaboratories, two leading companies in the genetic engineering field, as well as Ionics, Inc., an\nengineering company, have already acquired the apparatus. We anticipate that its resolution\nmay be further improved in microgravity.\nA brief comparison of these instruments may be in order. The Harwell and the\nMcDonnell Douglas instruments separate materials on the basis of differences in electrophoretic\nmobilities of components, this separating principle is technically known as zone electrophoresis.\nThe RIEF apparatus separates components on the basis of differences in their isoelectric point.\nMoreover, the first two instruments are both. adapted to continuous flow, the RIEF being a\nbatch apparatus.\nThe Harwell apparatus has a very high throughput, but I suspect it has the lowest resolution of the three instruments. The RIEF apparatus is of modular design and,:at least in\nprinciple, it could be scaled to any desired capacity. The McDonnell Douglas apparatus takes\nadvantage of microgravity to achieve the desired throughput. Even so, a battery of such instruments will be required for actual commercial production.\nUnfortunately, there was as yet no opportunity to compare directly the resolving power\nof the three instruments, which is a crucial factor. In analytical applications, isoelectric\n\n62\n\n:\n\n..\n:\n\nfocusing is characterized .by. very high resolution, and I expect that we have some advantages in\nthis regard also in our RIEF. On the other hand, focusing imposes more drastic conditions on\ntreated materials than continuous flow electrophoresis. Thus, the McDonnell Douglas apparatus\nis gentler and is applicable to a wider range of products. Of specific importance, it can separate\nliving cells, which.cannot \xe2\x80\x98be treated in the RIEF. In general, I expect that each of the three\ninstruments will find its own niche, and that they should be viewed as complementary rather\nthan competitive. :\nISOELECTRIC\n\nFOCUSING\n\nIsoelectric focusing is a particularly powerful variant of electrophoresis in which separation is carried out in a pH gradient. The proteins migrate, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d to the pH region\ncorresponding to. their isoelectric point, where they become immobilized due to zero net charge.\nThe isoelectric point of a protein is a rather characteristic parameter, accounting for the\nexquisite resolution obtainable. The pH gradient is established by the actual effect of the\nelectric current on the appropriately chosen buffer.\nThe RIEF apparatus was designed to adapt isoelectric focusing to large scale industrial\ncapacities. Due to the fact that proteins focus to a stationary point, a novel recycling principle\ncould be adopted. Fluid stabilization is accomplished by a parallel array of filter elements,\nwhich assure laminarity of flow. Monotilament nylon screens of fine mesh porosity are used for\nthis purpose. Several reports describe the details of instrument design (2) and performance (3).\nWe expect a substantial improvement in the resolution of the RIEF when operated in a\nmicrogravity environment. The absence of terrestrial gravity could permit the elimination of the\nscreen elements, essential for the RIEF ground-based operation. In principle, such an apparatus\nwould combine some of the advantages of the McDonnell Douglas apparatus with the sharpness\nof resolution achievable by recycling in a pH gradient.\nThe shuttle is potentially a vehicle for the industrialization of space. At the present\ntime it is even more important to consider it as a unique national research facility, capable of\nproviding specific data not obtainable otherwise. In electrophoretic separations, fluid disturbances can arise from two causes: gravity-dependent convection and gravity-independent electroosmosis. Electroosmosis is the streaming of fluid induced by the electric field itself and it is\ncaused by the residual electric charge of the walls of the vessels. In the case of focusing, it is\nimpossible to distinguish between these two effects in ground-based operation. In space, gravity\neffects will be abolished, permitting a clear assessment of the effects of electroosmosis alone.\nWe are presently preparing an experimental package comprising eight focusing columns\nintegrated in a middeck locker of the shuttle orbiter. These columns, of varying internal configuration, will be filled with a mixture of two colored proteins, the red hemoglobin and the\nblue-stained human serum albumin. The separation of the two proteins will be recorded\nphotographically, with pictures taken every 3 minutes over a 90 minute interval. In groundbased operation, only one of these columns permits clear focusing of the proteins, both gravity\nand electroosmosis being simultaneously abolished by screen elements. All the other cells fail\nto focus. Operation in space should provide a clear-cut answer to the cause of failure, whether\ngravity-dependent or gravity-independent. The results will greatly influence our design efforts\nfor a space RIEF and we are most anxious to see the results of the experiment, scheduled to fly\nJanuary 29th.\n\n63\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nOffice of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress: \xe2\x80\x9cImpacts of Applied Genetics - Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n2.\n\nM.
