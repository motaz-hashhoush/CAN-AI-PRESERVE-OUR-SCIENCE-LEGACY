Technology has advanced to the point where images generated on a computer can easily be recorded on a VCR and used as a video tutorial. This transfer can be as simple as pointing a video camera at the screen and recording the image. For more clarity and professional results, a board may be inserted into a computer which will convert the signals directly to the TV standard. Using a computer program that generates movies one can animate various principles which would normally be impossible to show or would require time-lapse photography. For example, you might show the change in shape of grains as a piece of metal is cold worked and then show the recrystallization and grain growth as heat is applied. More imaginative titles and graphics are also possible using this technique. Remedial help may also be offered via computer to those who find a specific concept difficult. A printout of specific data, details of the theory or equipment set-up can be offered. Programs are now available that will help as well as test the student in specific areas so that a Keller type approach can be used with each student to insure each knows the subject before going on to the next topic. A computer can serve as an information source and contain the microstructures, physical data and availability of each material tested in the lab. With this source present unknowns can be evaluated and various tests simulated to create a simple or complex case study lab assignment.", "title": "Demo of three ways to use a computer to assist in lab", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900015048, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Neville, J.
