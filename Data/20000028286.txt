This year, the topics focused on human\nexploration of Mars, including considerations\narchitecture to very detailed considerations\nof\nundergraduate\nprojects and four graduate level\ncountry. Over 200 students participated on the\n\nranging from systems analysis of the transportation\nand surface\nsurface elements such as greenhouses,\nrovers, and EVA suits. Ten\nprojects were presented with a total of 13 universities from around the\nstudy teams and nearly 100 students attended the forum meeting. The\n\nt_\n\noverall quality of reports and presentations\nwas extremely high, with most projects requiting that the students dig into\nspace systems concepts, designs, and technologies\nin detail. University team outreach projects also reached\napproximately\n1500 people through articles and Web sites developed by the students. Several of the teams had NASA\nor industry mentors and included visits to NASA centers as part of their class activities.\n\nw\n\nw\nn\n\nAwards were made to the three top undergraduate\nteams and the top team of graduate\nwent to a team from Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas.

Pressurized rovers, such as the one illustrated here, will be used for a variety of tasks both\nclose to and distant from the pressurized habitat. These rovers will have the capability to allow the crew to\nconduct EVAs, as required, in the vicinity of the rover. These pressurized rovers and teleoperated robots\nwill allow the crew to explore regions well beyond "walk back" distances from their landing site.\n\nForum\n\n3\n\n4\n\nLPI Contribtaion\n\nNo. 979\n\nA Martian\n\nField\n\nCamp\n\nm\nm\n\nI\n\n!\nw\n\n=\n\nM\nm\n\nJ\n\n|\n\nm\nm\n\ni\n\nProviding the systems necessary to set up and operate a remote field camp makes possible another means\nfor extending\n\nthe exploration\n\nrange\n\nof the Mars\n\ncrew.\n\nCrews\n\noperating\n\nfrom\n\na field\n\ncamp\n\nwill\n\nallow\n!\n\ninteresting\n\nsites\n\nto be explored\n\nin more\n\ndetail\n\nthan\n\nwouldbe-pos_blei-f\n\ntlaeEVA\n\nWere staged\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nlanding site.\n\n[]\nA Laboratory\n- --,- -Z\'Z:\' ....

The goals of Mars exploration focus mainly on the presence\nof water and the geologic features associated with it. To explore the feasibility of a manned mission, a field analog\n\xe2\x80\xa2\no, *.t\n,,\nproject was conducted.\nThe project began by examining a series of aerial photographs representing,\ndescent\nspace\ncraft images. From the photographs,\nlocal and regional geology of the two "landing" sites was determined\nand\nseveral "targets of interest" were chosen. The targets were prioritized based on relevance to achieving the goals of\nthe project and Mars exploration.\nTraverses to each target, as well as measurements\nand sample collections\nwere.\nplanned, and a timeline for the exercise was created. From this it was found that for any mission to be successful, a\nbalance must be discovered between keeping to the planned timeline schedule, and impromptu revision of the\nmission to allow for conflicts, problems and other adjustments necessary due to greater information\ngathered upon\narrival at the landing site. At the conclusion of the field exercise, it was determined that a valuable resource for\nmission planning is high resolution remote sensing of the landing area. This led us to conduct a study to determine\nwhat ranges of resolution are necessary to observe geology features important to achieving the goals of Mars\nexploration.\nThe procedure\nused involved de_ading\na set of images to differing resolutions, which were then\nexamined to determine what features could be seen and interpreted.\nThe features were rated for recognizability,\nthe\nresults were tabulated, and a minimum necessary resolution was determined.\nOur study found that for the streams,\nboulders, bedrock, and volcanic features that we observed, a resolution of at least I meter/pixel is necessary.\nWe\nnote though that this resolution depends on the size of the feature being observed, and thus for Mars the resolution\nmay be lower due to the larger size of some features. With this new information, we then examined the highest\nresolution images taken to date by the Mars Orbital Camera on board the Mars G!oba! Surveyor, and planned a\nmanned mission.\nWe chose our site keeping in mind the goals for Mars exploration, then determined\nthe local and\nregional geology of the "landing" area. Prioritization\nwas then done on the geologic features seen and traverses\nplanned to various "targets of interest".\nA schedule for each traverse stop, including what measurements\nand\nsamples were to be taken, and a timeline for the mission was then created with ample time allowed for revisions\nplans, new discoveries,\nand possible complications.\n\nwere\nof\n\n1. Introduction\n\nU\n\nW\n\nF\n\nE\n\nThe intensive study of Mars through exploration by humans is a long-term goal of the United States space program,\nalthough a definite schedule has not been established for this to take place. The cost of a human mission to Mars\nwill be very high - certainly billions of dollars. The mission must therefore be very efficient in achieving the goals\nfor Martian exploration.\nThe primary goals, as prescribed by NASA (McCleese 1998), encompass many issues from\nscientific to human exploration,\nand are summarized as follows; the search for water (when, where, form, and\namount), the search for life (extinct or extant), the examination of climate (weather processes and history), and the\nexploration\nof resources (environment and its possible usefulness to future missions). The question of the\navailability of water on the surface of Mars is relevant t9 all the objectives.\nThe possibility of the development of\nlife, whether past or present, and how water has shaped the geologic and climatologic histories of the planet are both\ndependent on the presence of liquid water. The history of Mars and the corresP9nding implications of the potential\nfor life could be useful in the study of how life evolved on Earth and interacted with its primeval surroundings.\nThe\nlatter goal is concerned with the availability and feasibility of exploiting in situ resources for future missions.\nIn situ\nresources would greatly diminish the cost of exploration\nby providing the raw materials for fuel synthesis,\nconstruction of settlements,\nand the ability to initiate and maintain closed, self-sustaining\nlife support systems.\nIn order to ensure\nand practiced\n\nthe success\n\nand efficiency\n\nin detail with simulations\n\nof a human\n\non Earth.\n\nmission\n\nThis approach\n\nto Mars, it is essential\nwill provide\n\nastronauts\n\nthat the mission\nrigorous\n\nbe planned\n\ntraining\n\nthat will\n\nForum\n\n17\n\n18 LPI\n\nContribution No. 979\n\nI\n\nmake routine activities time effective.\nAt the same time, the simulation should help identify potential unexpected\nconditions and hazards, as well as assist astronauts in responding effectively to these conditions.\nSimulations\non\nEarth also permit testing of equipment and procedures,\nand enable subsequent\nmodifications\nat a small relative cost.\nEarth can provide an excellent analog environment,\nbecause its geology approximates\nsome of that expected to be\nfound on Mars.\n\nI\n\nIn this report, we discuss our involvement in a Mars Field Analog Project conducted\nin October and November\nof\n1998. We briefly explain our methods used in this exercise, as well as our results and conclusions\nderived from the\ninformation\ngathered in the field. We also discuss the procedure and results collected from a resolution study, which\nstemmed from our findings in the Field Analog Project.\nThe third section of this report summarizes our planning of\na manned mission to Mars using the information\ngained from the field exercise and the resolution study. We explain\nthe procedures used as well as our reasoning behind our methods.\n2. Field Analog\n\nm\nI\n\nProject\nJ\n\n2.1 Project Objectives\nThe Field Analog Project was created to allow students to experience\nall aspects involved in sending humans to\nMars, including planning, executing and examining the data gaflaered from a manned mission. The project not only\nexplores what goes into planning and executing a mission, but also what problems can occur and what steps are\nnecessary to plan, correct and/or adjust for those problems.\nThe objectives of this project were to become more\nfamiliarized with Mars and its geoto_,\ntO be ab le to use and interpret remote sensing data, to plan and run a field\nexercise, and to analyze the results from that exercise.\n2.2 Approach\nBy taking into consideration\nthe goals stated for Mars exploration,\na simulated manned mission was co_nducted using\ntwo teams of geologists at two locations in northern Arizona, to study the feasibility of such a mission to Mars. One\nstipulation of the exercise was to have no prior knowledge of the site other than aerial photographs,\ntaken at different\nscales, which simulated a Sequence of space craft descent pictures. These pictures were used to plan and execute a\nmanned mission as if on Mars. The locai and regional geology of the two areas were determined\nand several "targets\nof interest" were chosen and prioritized based on their relevance to achieving the goals of the mission.\nTraverses\nwere planned to each site and a timeline for the intire mission was created.\nThe benefits of a manned mission over\nrobotic missions were addressed including the problem-solving\nabilities of humans versus the programmability,\nexpendability,\nand environmental\ntolerances of rob0tsl Robotic missions, although expendable,\nare inherently less\nefficient due to the communications\nlag times between Earth and Mars that are involved.\nThe use of experienced\nhumans allows split-second,\non site decision-making.\nThe ability of communicating\nrapidly is useful in coping with\npotential uncertainties or problems encountered by a robotic mission.\n2.3 Procedure\nThe first step in planning for the field exercise was the analysis of four or five photos of each respective landing\nThese photographs\nsimulated the increase in image resolutions that would be collected during the descent of a\nvehicle landing on Mars, in addition to the orbital images that are typically utilized in actual mission planning.\nGeologic features were identified according to the Mars exploration goals (McCleese\n1998). Topography\nwas\nestimated from the shadow lengths of features and the time of day of the photography.\n\nu\n\ng\n\nU\n\n[]\n\narea.\n\nAfter key geologic targets were identified, preliminary\ngeologic maps and histories of each site were developed.\nGiven the perspective that precise landing sites are rarely known until it occurs, prioritization\nof features was based\non perceived accessibility\nand scientific value. Possible traverse routes and schedules for the six-hour exercise were\ndevised. Prioritization\nwas based on relevance to the Mars exploration goals, as stated above, accessibility\nto the\nfeatures based on calculated topography and traverse length, and mission length or how much total time was\navailable.\nTherefore, features that encompassed\nmore than one objective were given a higher priority over other\nfeatures. Alternate and contingency traverses for time or environmentally\nrestricted mission profiles were also\nplanned according to the prioritization\n"collection" of rock and soil samples,\n\nm\n\nused above. Time was also added into the schedule for the possible\nas well as atmospheric content samples and temperature\nreadings.\n\nm\n\ni\n\nE\nI\n\nmW\n\nm\ng\n\nUpon arrival at the simulated landing site, one member of each team was chosen as the _,eolo_,_st , another as the\n"backup geologist", and the third as CAPCOM.\nThe geologist was required to wear a heavy frame backpack, large\nheavy-duty outdoor gloves, and a plexiglassvis0r\nto simulate the life support system (space suit) that the astronauts\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n!\n\nSecond HEDS- UP Forum\n\n=\nr\nm\n\nwould be required to wear during their traverses.\nOnce in the field, the first problem addressed was orientation to the\nsurroundings.\nAlthough the true landing points were only off by tens of meters, no one \'landed" precisely where\ntheir traverses were planned to begin, and revisions were hastily devised according to the alternate prioritizations.\nAdditionally,\nactually surveying the terrain predicated some traverse alterations solely for safety concerns. Initial\nobservations\nin the field also prompted radical reworking of target prioritization\nin most cases. Over the course of\nthe exercise innumerable\n\'targets of opportunity\'\nthat had not been foreseen in the preliminary remote sensing arose\nas well as emergency situations, which placed time constraints on the project. Final analysis invariably resulted in\nrevised site geologic histories and maps, and the formulation\nof laboratory analyses of proposed returned field\nsamples. The actual collecting of samples was precluded by the property owners, the Navajo Nation.\n2.4 Geology of the Landing Sites\n2.4. I\nSite A Sedimentology\nand Structures\nThe geology of Site A based on the remote sensing showed some specific dominant features. The lowest resolution\nimage showed that the general geologic context of the area as predominantly\nfiat-lying terrain with little or no change\nin relief. Wind streaks, soil variations, and some larger channels were the dominant features at this scale, but many\nof the more detailed features were not identifiable.\nChannel structures could be traced through the field area on the\n\n[uj\n\n=_\nm\n\nhigher resolution photos, and the shading and texture of the surface suggested relatively recent debris from running\nwater. Most of the area between the channels seemed to be flat but strewn with cobbles of various sizes. A few of\nthese cobbles seemed to have a wood-like texture. Near the western edge of the area, a large hill or possibly a butte\ndominated the terrain. Its summit showed signs of weathering\nin the broken nature of the boulders, which were\ninterpreted to be volcanic. The areas between the hill and the channels seemed have a substantial, fine soil cover\nindicated by half-buried clasts and mud cracks. The shading of the main surface material changed over the entire\narea from the channels to the hill, which could indicate differences in composition or differences in weathering\nand/or soil formation.\n4.2.1\nSite A Igneous Petrology\nIf indeed the hill was volcanic in nature,\n\nrr=_\n\nthen most of the rocks in the area should have compositions\n\nthat fit with this\n\nhypothesis.\nThe soils were thus assumed to be clays and muds directly associated with the weathering of volcanics.\nThe specific types of weathering products from different types of extrusive igneous rocks are well defined based on\nstarting composition\nof the source rock (Blatt & Tracy, 1996). By determining\nthe types of volcanics that the hill is\ncomprised of, the nature and composition\nof the soils, clays and muds could then be inferred and tested. The change\nin color of the soil material may reflect the compositional\ndifferences from the weather of the hill material as uposed\nto other sources.\nThe fractures observed in the photos should have also been consistent with known jointing patterns\nof the appropriate volcanic rocks, such as columnar jointing in basalts. Together with these attributes, the albedo or\ncoloring of the rocks at the site should have also been appropriate for the type of rocks.\n\n====\n\nmlw\n\n2.4.3\nPlanning the Site A Traverses\nPrioritization\nof features to examine in the area was completed after the preliminary photogeologic\nanalyses. The\nmain goal for Site A was to visit the channels that were probable locales for the preservation of water related\nstructures.\nAdhering once again to the main mission goals for Martian exploration,\nthe presence of water-sculpted\nlandforms was the first step to detecting the possible existence of liquid water at the surface. This in turn could\nindicatethat\npaleoclimatic\nconditions were once warm enough to support life. The traverse from the landing site to\nthemain channel would be the most important for these reasons.\nThe second most important goal involved\ndetermining\nthe composition\nof the hill. Was it indeed volcanic or was it something else? The final area of interest\nwas the soil and its formation.\nCould the weathering be traced through the differences in the soil types? Many\nlocales across the field area were chosen as alternates for the various priorities since accessibility to these sites would\nbe limited\n\nliW\n\ng\n\nili\n\nby time and landing\n\nlocation.\n\n2.4.4\nActual Site A Geology in the Field\nThe geology of the site provided some unexpected\nsurprises when compared to the photogeologic\nstudy. The first\nobservations\nwere of the actual landing site, where the clasts that were observed on the photos were identified.\nThe\nsoil had a hard, reddish covering and was strewn by pieces of petrified wood, sandstone, and jasper. There was no\nreal distinction between particles of different sizes, indicating the sorting was poor. Mud cracks were nearly\nubiquitous.\nThe channels provided a look at the sediment being carried downstream. The middle of the channels\nwas coated in a fine-grained\ngray sediment that seemed to match the layers seen in the distance near the hill (Figures\n2.3, 2.4). The size of these sediments was a fine grained to silty sand.

In the largest\n\n19\n\n20 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\ni\n\nchannel there was a cut bank where the stratigraphy could easily be seen (Figure 2.5). At this locale the red surface\nsoil was measured to be 13.5 cm thick. It appeared to be an oxidized zone with a slight fining upward sequence in\nthe distribution\nof the coarser grained particles, although the sorting was still poor. Below this layer was a\npredominately\ngreenish-gray\nlayer approximately\n30-35 cm thick. The sorting in this layer was better developed and\nalso contained possible root casts that were filled with red sediment from the above layer (Figure 2.3). The hill in\nthe field area that appeared to be volcanic rock was actually a sandstone layer lying on top of softer shale or\nmudstone layers. The less resistant layers were eroding causing the upper, more resistant sandstone\nlayers to\nfracture.\nThe result was the creation of fairly large sandstone boulders, some of which could be found on the plain\nwhere the channels were located. In general, thetopo_aphy\nand geologic features found at the site were visible and\nidentifiable on the "descent" images. The one main difficulty d!scovered was determining\nthe compositional\nnature\nof the hill and surrounding\nareas. Other discrepancies\nmainly occurred with the size of the features seen. Smaller\nfeatures, such as the stratigraphy\nwithin the large channel were not as visible in the images due to the resolution\nused.\nAnother discrepancy\nwe found dealt with estimating the topography of the area from the "descent" sequences.

The region appeared to dip SSW to SW at a low\n\nangle, and displayed evidence of aeNian erosion from a SE direction based on wind shadows present behind\noutcrops and other obstructions.\nOne region to flaenorth of the proposed landing site had several large boulders of\npossible granitic composition\non a small plateau. It was hoped that these were transported\nfeatures that Would offer\ninsight into regions well beyond the travel constraints of the mission. Numerous small, shallow tributaries crossed\nthe relatively flat surface to "feed" into the larger streambeds.\nThese tributary paths were faint, but branched several\ntimes, possibly indicating that whatever amount of water presen t at the sit e was drained out of the region. The large\nnumber of tributaries seemed to indicate that the transport volume of each stream was very low. These features led\nto the hypothesis\n\nthat the region was the modern\n\nremnant\n\nm\n\nm\n\ni\n\ng\n\nm\n\nIll\n\nof an ancient floodplain.\nm\n\n2.4.6\nIgneous Petr0Iogy\nIf the boulders located to the north edge of the site location were granitic in composition,\nit would explain their\ngreater resistance to weathering than the surrounding\nsedimentary units. The boulders also have a very rounded\nappearance,\nconsistent with the spheroidal exfoliation weathering pattern of granite. Quartz and feldspars would\nthen be assumed to be present, due to the extent of weathering of the boulders, and soil samples were planned to be\ncollected at and near that location (Blatt & Tracy, 1996). Also, the sandstones seemed to be darker in color\n(possibly red) which may indicate a more arkosic composition.\nThis would agree with the granitic composition\nof\nthe boulders since they could then become the source of the feldspars necessary for the arkose sandstones.\n\ni\n=\nI\n\nJ\n\nu\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\n=\n\nM\n\n2.4.7\nPlanning the Site B Traverses\nPrioritization\nof features to examine in the field was completed after the preliminary photogeologic\nanalyses. It was\ndecided that the main points of interest were the large channel to the south of the photos as well as the boulder region\nto the north. The large channel, being the most likely source of liquid water, was chosen as a high priority to look\nfor evidence of life, as well as give clues to the climatological\nhistory of the area. The boulder region was chosen as\na priority in order to determine if they were the same composition\nas the fiat sediments, if they were an intrusive\nigneous body, thus creating the possibility of hydrothermal\nenvironments\nfor life, or if they were transported from\nanother location.\nWith these areas in mind, several traverses were planned according to possible landing locations\nand differing\n\nm\nw\n\nl\n\ntime constraints.\n\n2.4.8\nActual Site B Geology in the Field\nUpon the preliminary observations\nfrom the landing site the\nthe boulders to the north were not transported\nfrom another\nstreambed to the south would thus be the most likely source\ntraverse plans starting in the eastern region of the study area\nthe large southeastern\noutflow channel, the upper end of the\nobservations\nof the boulder-filled\nnorthern region.\n\noriginal traverses were altered.

Some of the\nsandstones contained carbonate materiai weathered from the rocks in the form of weathered out holes (Figure 2.7),\nand solution pits on the exposed surfaces.\nThe general reddish color of all of the rocks of the region indicated an\noxidizing environment\ntypical of a deltaic system. Samples documented\nat the site included extensive transported\nchert from the southeastern\noutflow channel, and small pieces of coal and petrified wood from the southwestern\nchannel system. Evidence of recent fluvial activity in the region included ripple marks (Figure 2.6), puddles of water\nin the bases of some streambeds\n(Figure 2.8), and mud cracks in other streambeds where water has seeped into the\nground or evaporated.\nVegetation and signs of animal life were observed at the site, and vegetation growth patterns\nwere found to coincide with a regional vertical joint set oriented towards the NW_ Again, the topography and\ngeologic features found at the site were visible and identifiable on the "descent" images.

A major\nsuccess was the ability to identify large scale geologic structures such as fluvial systems or sedimentary\nstrata in their\nstudy areas with only minor difficulties.\nAlso, relatively precise planning of preliminary\ntransit routes and traverse\ntiming resulted from accurately mapped horizontal distances in each of the study areas. One discovery made during\nthe exercise was the necessary balance between keeping to the planned timeline schedule, and impromptu\nrevision of\nthe planned mission to allow for conflicts and problems.\nA good deal of planning needed to be done before arrival in\nthe field, not only of the traverses, but also of what experiments we wanted to conduct, and samples we wanted to\ntake. Once in the field however, many of these plans needed to be corrected, due to the _eater amount of.\ninformation\ngathered about the area from field observations.\nMany areas of interest that were discovered\nupon\nlanding at the site were not visible in the \'descent\' photos due to the resolution of the images, and thus could not be\nplanned for, causing minor alterations to the planned traverses. (It should be noted that the photographic\nresolution is\nonly limited by _ain size or the emoltion of the film used.) Also, some areas turned out to be of more scientific\nvalue than originally thought and thus, due to time constraints,\nother areas had to be cut from the schedule.\nThese\ndecisions could only be made upon arrival, and thus any planned mission must allow for these types of changes in its\nschedule.\nThe people involved should be qualified and able to make the decisions necessary to compensate\nfor these\nunforeseen discoveries.\n2.5.2\nComplications\nExperienced\nDuring Field Exercise\nNumerous problems occurred during the exercise, many of which remained completely unforeseen during planning.\nMost notable amongst the failures was the unreliable estimation of topography based on shadows in the\nreconnaissance\nphotos. In most cases distinction of shadow from equally dark features was very difficult, making\naccurate measurement\nof shadow lengths very nearly impossible.\nIn some instances, solar geometry in the photos\ncompletely concealed topography that at other times would have been clearly visible. These two factors combined to\nproduce gross underestimates\nof vertical transit possibilities at both study areas.\n\n23\n\n24 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nm\n\nField documentation\nproved cumbersome\nthroughout the exercise.\nMaintalning\nthe analog environment\nof the\nproject, the actual field geologist on Mars would be in an environmental\nsuit with bulky gloves and a visor; precise,\ndelicate movements would be severely limited. Two different methods of taking field notes were utilized; the use of\nstrictly audio-recorded\nnotes compared to that of traditional\nwritten field notes. The use of written field\ndocumentation,\nsuch as those methods acceptable\nin traditional field geology prove to be far too time consuming in\nthe restricted EVA environment.\nOne way around this shortcoming\nwas to include photo documented\nsamples that\nwould have been collected and returned to a laboratory environment.\nBy voice annotating the samples and photos,, a\nvery clear picture of the collection environment could be maintained\nwithout the use of notes.\nwere not allowed to be taken from the study areas as required by the landowners.\n\ni\n\nRock and soil samples\n\nProper spatial orientation at any given time also proved to be an onerous issue\xe2\x80\xa2 Orientation\nfor site documentation\npurposes was done using the descent photogaphs,\nand was an experience that consumed the attention of all present.\nThe final accuracy of these impromptu map reading sessions was usually highly questionable;\nat a minimum, teams\nbecame slightly disoriented, but perhaps most problematic\nwas the inference of local geology to regional geology.\nBy not knowing exact locations, the field observations\nallowed only cautious conclusions\nconcerning the macrogeology on a regional scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers.\n2.5.3\nProposed Field Mission Revisions\n_\n: .....\n:::; _;-- 2\nMission planners should make extensive accommodations\nfor time management\nin field operaiions. _From a\ntechnological\nstandpoint this should include mission specific implements\nsuch as specialized\ngeologic tools.

During the field exercise, the "astronaut geoloNst" was injured, thus making field operations difficult. The\nother team participants had to then try and assume a major portion of the role of "geologist"\nthat could not be\nperformed by the injured person. Having the astronauts trained in a variety of disciplines insures that under such\nconditions, mission activities would continue with little to no loss of time or resources\xe2\x80\xa2\nCurrently in manned space exploration,\nthe only information\navailable to the astronauts for mission planning is the\nimages taken by remote spacecraft.\nThus, the remote sensing should be of the highest resolution possible in order to\nobtain the greatest amount of information about the landing site. Due to weight, size and cost limitations in\nspacecraft designs, the equipment used to produce the highest resolution imagery is not always chosen. With this in\nmind, it is necessary to determine the lowest resolution\nneeded to view the regional and local geologic features that\npertain to the objectives of Mars exploration\nwith enough accuracy to adequately plan a manned mission. Therefore\nan in-depth study was done to quantify the resolution limitations of a variety of specific geologic features important\nto this type of mission.\n-\n\n!\nl\n\n|\nII\n\nI\nN\n\na\n!\ni\n\n3.\n\nImage\n\nResolution\n\nStudy\n\n3.1 Objective\nFrom our experiences\nduring the Field Analog Project, we discovered\nthat the one piece of information\nmost useful\nto us were the \'descent lma_,es of the proposed landing sites. However, the resolution of these images (3mm/pixel),\nthough much higher than those used in current space exploration\n(not including the most recent Mars Orbital Camera\n(MOC) images), were not as adequate as we would have liked for determining\nthe local geology of the site. The\nmain reason for this section of research was to determine what resolution was necessary to view geologic features of\ndiffering\n\nsize Scales, which are important\n\nto achieving\n\nW\n\nI\n\nthe main goals for Mars exploration.\n\n3.2Approach\n.....................................................\nFor this study, we took a set of images and degraded each of them to differing resolutions, creating a resolution\nsequence.\nThe sequences were then examined to try and determine what geologic features could be detected or\ninterpreted at each resolution within the sequence.\nEach geologic feature was rated, from 1 to 10, as to its visibility\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nII\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\nm\n\nor recognizibility\nresolution\ncould\n\nat each resolution\nbe determined.\n\nstage.\n\nThe\n\nresults\n\nwere\n\nthen tabulated\n\nwith\n\nthe hopes\n\nthat\n\na minimum\n\nnecessary\n\n3.3 Procedure\nThe\n\nmethod\n\nField\n\nimplemented\n\nAnalog\n\nStudy\n\nflatbed\n\nscanner\n\n5.0.

type of environment\nthat is just recently bec\'oming better understood on\nEarth. Hydrothermal\nsettings would be good places to look for life on Mars because they are local areas of\nspecialized temperature, pressure, and chemical composition.\nLocations on Earth that fit this description include\nplaces like the hot springs in Yellowstone National Park or black smokers at vents at the bottom of the Ocean. These\nlocales have the unique property that their extreme compositions\nand temperature\nand pressure regimes actually\nserve to protect organisms from surrounding hostile conditions.\nIn the case of the black smokers, the heat and gases\nprovide a region around the vent that is habitable for certain types of organisms\nthat normally could not survive at\nthe extreme high pressures and low temperatures\nof the sea floor. Regions such as the hot springs in Yellowstone\ncould easily exist on Mars around thermal vents or volcanic settings.\nGeothermal\nheat and sulfides would be perfect\nfor anaerobic microorganisms\nto thrive, much like they do on Earth (Farmer 1996). The mineral concretions\nformed\nin these settings have the ability to entomb any organisms providing a potential good fossil record (Cady and Farmer\n\nm\n\nI\n\nm\nB\n\n!\n\n1996).\nThe third potential area of interest would be anywhere where there is substantial amounts of ice. Places that would\ninclude this are presently limited to the polar ice caps. However, there are a couple of other areas that are possible\nlocations of ice. Some of the water that once was on the surface has been hypothesized\nto have migrated to\nsubterranean\nreservoirs.\nHere under the surface, reaping the benefits of some lithostatic pressure from the rocks\nabove, ice could theoretically\nexist. Ice of this nature could potentially provide protection for the remains of\norganisms that were carried there by liquid water originally and then frozen in the subsurface.\nAnother possibility\nfor finding evidence of life is that of glacial landforms.\nPlaces where ice moving in the form of glaciers could have\ncarried life with it and then deposited it in the fine-_ained\ntill material left after the glacier had vanished (Kargel and\nStrom\n\nm\n\nm\nl\n\n1992).\n\nGeologic features that are found in these settings would most likely be important indicators of the presence of water\nand/or other potentially important resources.\nSome places that are indicative of water can then be possible locales\nfor preservation of extinct life. By using the results of the Image Resolution\nStudy, limitations can be placed on the\ntypes of imaging systems needed for the detection of these geologic features.\nMinimal resolutions for the positive\nidentification\nof most moderately\nsized features have been determined\nto be around 1 meter/pixel.\nThis estimate is\ndependent\nfeatures.\n\non the magnitude\n\nof the features\n\nbeing examined\n\nand is therefore\n\nbiased\n\nagainst\n\nmoderate\n\nand smaller\n\nIt is likely that MOC or MOC variants will be the standard of manned-mission\nplanning data, because the highest\nresolution of the instrument corresponds\nwell to the experimentally\ndetermined\nresolution limitations of the\nimportant geologic features, although, better resolution is still needed to adequately\nview features on the surface.\nTransporting\nsignificantly more robust imaging systems to Mars that are larger and thus capable of higher,\nmultispectral resolutions, however, is not a realistic option given the cost and payload constraints of Discovery-class\nmissions and the marginal benefits such an instrument would provide.\nConstraints\non landing site selection can be\nbetter accomplished\nbecause the mapping resolution of MOC is higher than that necessary to identify geologic\nfeatures. This increased resolution makes observation of higher order features possible, which allows for better\nprioritization\n\nof possible\n\n4.\n\na Mars Mission\n\nPlanning\n\nlanding\n\nw\n\nII\n\nI\n\nm\n\nsites and traverses.\nm\nm\n\n4.1 Introduction\nThe goals for Mars exploration, as stated earlier, include the search for water, the search for extant and extinct life,\nand the exploration of resources for use in future missions. In achieving these goals, it is believed that manned\nmissions would be more useful and more successful than robotic missions for several reasons. One benefit Of\nsending humans over robots is the problem solving ability and reasoning skills versus the programmability\nand\nautonomy.\nRobotic missions, although more expendable,\nare less efficient when dealing with time constraints\ndue to\ncommunication\ntag times between Earth and Mars. The ability of rapid communication\nis extremely useful in coping\nwith potential uncertainties\nor problems and split-second\nand on site decision making could reduce damages to both\nthe people and equipment\n\ni\n\ng\n\nI\n\ninvolved.\nU\n\nI\nm\n\nI\n\nII\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\nL\n\n_\n\nR\n\n!\n\n4.2 Approach\nThis section of research was conducted to simulate the planning and initial exploration phase of a Mars Manned\nMission using actual Mars data and images taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and the Mars Orbital Camera\n(MOC). In this exercise, we attempted to perform all the steps involved in planning, preparing for and executing a\nhuman mission, including examining images for possible landing locations, determining\nlocal geology from MOC\nimages of landing area, prioritizing\npossible sample collecting\nsites and geologic features, planning traverses, and\ncreating plausible timelines for planned activities.\n4.3 Procedure\n\nW\n\ni\n\nB\n\nU\n\nU\nm\n\nIll\n\nU\nW\n\nm_\n\nThe first step of this exercise was to look through the images of the surface of Mars taken by the Mars Orbital\nCamera (MOC) which were located on the JPL Photojournal\nwebsite. These images were taken at 1.5 meterslpixel.\nWe chose our site, a small crater within the larger Alexey Tolstoy crater, keeping in mind the goals for Mars\nexploration.\nWe wanted an area that a spacecraft would be capable of landing at, that showed some evidence of\nliquid water in the area, and that had local geology that could potentially harbor life. Once the site was chosen,\nMOC photos of the site, as well as regional photos taken by Viking 1 were examined for local and regional geology\nof the area, and preliminary climatological\nand geological histories were constructed.\nFor Alexey Tolstoy crater,\nthere are breaks in the crater wall which resemble places where channels might have eroded through the wall,\nallowing water to flow into the crater itself. This main crater is large, about 94 kilometers,\nwhich implies that it\nshould be very deep. The observed floor of the crater is not much deeper than the rim, suggesting significant\namounts of fill material. With evidence of possible channels and significant deposition of material in the crater,\nAlexey Tolstoy could be a good place for the preservation\nof fossil life forms. Looking at the smaller crater\ncontained with in the walls of Alexey Tolstoy, this gives a natural window into the stratigraphy of the crater fill\nmaterial.\nOnce the local geology was determined,\nthe next step was to prioritize the geologic features seen in terms of meeting\nthe goals and objectives of the mission. Features that would possibly give information about the sedimentary\nand\naeolian materials within the crater floor were chosen for sample collection and other measurements\nto be conducted.\nTraverses were then planned to the various features discovered\nand locations for measurement\nand sample\ncollections were determined.\nA schedule for each traverse stop and a timeline for the mission were constructed,\nwith\nample time allowed for revisions of plans, new discoveries\nand possible problems or complications.\n4.4 Results and Discussion\n4.4.1\nRegional Geology\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nAlexey Tolstoy crater is located at approximately\n47\xc2\xb0S latitude, 235\xc2\xb0W longitude, is 94 kilometers\nin diameter, and\nis situated in Promethei Terra on the boundary between the southern highlands and the northern lowlands.\nLooking\nat the crater area in the Viking 1 orbiter image, the region consists mostly of cratered terrains believed to be volcanic\nin origin. There is a gradation from young to old craters, but the classification\nis based more on morphology than\nsuperposition/chronology.\nThe oldest craters are very irregular in shape, subdued, have very eroded and degraded\nrims, and lack visible ejecta blankets, while the younger craters are more circular in shape, have good rims and small\nejecta blankets. Many of the larger craters have slump material from the crater wails into the interior floor, possibly\ncovering up any evidence of a central peak structure.\nIn several places along the rim of Alexey Tolstoy, there\nappears to be areas where the rim has been down cut by some process, possibly by water. These small channels\ncould have supplied water and sediment into the crater, filling it in and evening out the topography on the crater\nfloor. A majority of these craters have accumulated\naeolian material on their floors, creating a flatter appearance.\nThere are several large scarps and wrinkle ridges trending northeast and a few edges of large ejecta blankets can be\ntraced out along the landscape.\nIn the west and southwest there are numerous knobs that rise approximately\n5-10\nkilometers above the local topography,\nand possess debris aprons around their bases. These knobs may be either\nremnants of basement material, emplaced by fracturing or faulting, which is currently being eroded and covered by\naeolian material.\n4.4.2\nLocal Geology\nThe image taken by the MOC, is a close up of the interior "o f.Alexey Tolstoy crater. The area seems to have two\nmaterial units: a darker, rougher, more knobby material lOCated in the upper ieg, lonof the image, and a lighter,\nsmoother material located in the lower region. It appears that the lighter material has been eroded back, exposing\nboth the darker underlying material an d a sm_all crater, appr_2ximately 850 meters in diameter, within the floor of\nAlexey Tolstoy. A majority of the ejecta blanket from this small, unnamed crater is visible, except the lower right\n\n27\n\n28\n\nLPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\ni\nportion,\n\nand the center\n\nof the crater\n\nit seems to be slightly\neroded,\nsmall crater.\nThere\nare a few\nthe smooth\n\nnature\n\nbut slightly\n\n4.4.3\n\nMapping\n\nIn the Viking\n\nhaving\nsmaller,\n\nof the lighter\n\nin color\n\nis completely\n\nrougher\n\nfilled\n\nin with\n\nsome breaks\nacross\npossibly\nsecondary\n\nmaterial.\n\nThere\n\nin texture\n\nthan\n\nUnits\n\nthe lighter\n\nimage,\n\nis a smaller\n\nsection\n\nthe rest of the light\n\nthe slightly\n\nrough\n\nThe\n\nrim\n\nis partially\n\nexposed,\n\nand\n\nit, possibly\nindicating\ncut channels\ninto the floor of the\nimpact\ncraters in the area, but they are notas\nvisible\ndue to\nin the lower\n\ncolored\n\n":2i=\n=-2=:.i=:_=---=\n-;_\n\nI Orbiter\n\nmaterial.\n\nleft corner\n\nof the image\n\nthat\n\nm\n\nis light\n\nu\n\nmaterial.\n\n,::\n\nmaterial\n\nfrom\n\nwhich\n\nthe majority\n\nof the knobs\n\npenetrate\n\ng\n\nwas\n\nmapped\nSmooth\n\nas Old Knobby\nTerrain,\nOld Terrain.\nThese two\n\nmapped\nblankets\n\naccording\nto relative\nage based on superposition\nof units.\nCrater floor material,\nslump material\nand ejecta\nwere assigned\nto each crater when possible\n(see Figure\n4.1).

The Mars Society Mission (MSM) was created to\nimprove upon the safety, cost, and political viability of previous plans, with emphasis on the NASA Reference Mission 3.0\n(RM 3.0). The Mars Society Mission is a complete description of a possible 5-human expedition to the Red Planet targeted\nat the 2011 (cargo) and 2014 (crew) launch opportunities.\nAll components\nare capable of performing in any succeeding\nlaunch windows.\nThe Mars Society Mission features:\ni.\nIncreased\nredundancy\nof design for reduced development.\nFor instance, the Mars Society Mission\'s\nMars Ascent\nVehicle (MAV) and Earth Return Vehicle (ERV) derive from a common Crew Return Vehicle (CRV, distinct from that\n2.\n\nm\n\nForum\n\nA New Plan for Sending Humans to Mars:\nThe Mars Society Mission\n\nN\n\n7.,_.\n\nHEDS-UP\n\n4.\n\nplanned for the International\nSpace Station).\nIncreased\nredundancy\nfor maximum\nsafety. A CRV will accompany the outbound habitat module, and in the event of\nhabitat failure would be able to support the crew until arrival on Mars or Earth. After a 612-day surface stay, both the\nMAV and ERV will accompany\nthe crew during the return to Earth. If either ERV or MAV fails, or Mars orbital\nrendezvous\ndoes not take place, either component could return the crew.\nThe Qahira\nInterplanetary\nTransportation\nSystem (QITS, pronounced "Keats").\nQITS is based on the Qahira launch\nvehicle, a Delta-IV inspired heavy lifter with only two new components, the Qahira Booster Core (QBC) with 4 RS-68\nengines, and the Qahira Upper Stage (QUS), with 1 RD0120 engine. The maximum configuration,\nthe Q3041, is capable\nof sending 55 MT trans-Mars.\nDetailed and improved\ntrajectories,\nincluding a 3/2 Hohmann transfer orbit for the ERV that minimizes propellant\nboil-off and reduces launch facility strain, as well as optimal trajectories for cargo, free-return, and return from Mars\nsurface.\n\n5.\n"Piggyback"\npayload capabilities\nto reduce launch costs and encourage additional planetary science missions.\n6.

A Q1310 configuration\nwill launch Payload 0E),\nCrew in CRV, also in January, 2014. Extensive computer programming\nand simulation were used to design launch vehicles\nand trajectories.\nComparative\nrisk analysis indicates that the Mars Society Mission has significantly\nless risk of failure than\nthe Reference Mission 3.0 or Mars Direct.\n\nm\n\nimll\n\ni\nm\n\nira!\n\nm\nm\nm\ni\nW\n\nI\n\n1. Motivation\nFor Design\nAmong the requirements\nlisted by Goldin for the commencement\nof a human Mars mission is "an affordable\nmission scenario\nthat can be accomplished\nin about one decade. \'\'_ Recent adoption of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and other costlowering technologies\nhave come close to achieving this, but a politically and scientifically\nviable mission with unified\nsupport has yet to be realized.\nThe Mars Society Mission resolves this problem by addressing the safety and scientific\nshortcomings\nof the Reference Mission 3.0 and Mars Direct.\n2.\nApproach to Mission Design\nThe Mars Society Mission was designed with the final goal of a complete and workable human Mars mission, with the\nconstraints of: (1) technological\nsimplicity, with few new technologies\nrequired; maximization\nof (2) crew survival options\nand (3) science return; and minimization\nof (4) politically sensitive technologies\nwithout significant increase in cost. The\nteam achieved this goal through computer simulation, spreadsheet,and\nin-depth final system selection.\n2.1. Computer\nsimulation\nThree computer simulations\nwere designed using the C programming\nlanguage to address trajectory, launch capability, and\naerocapture.\n\n35\n\n36\n\nLPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\n2.1.1.\nTrajectory\nProgram\n.....\nThe trajectory program analyzed mean Keplerian orbital elements of Earth and Mars and assumed a heliocentric\nconic section\ntransfer orbit. Within these approximations,\ntrajectories were calculated exactly. The program was validated by comparison\nto previous interplanetary\nprobes, z\'3 Table 2.1.1. displays this validation,\nusing C3 as the benchmark\ntrajectory feature. After\nestablishing\nthis small absolute error in C3 for recentMars\n_ajectories,\nthe program was deemed valid for calculations\nused in\ndesigning\n\nthe Mars Society\n\nTable 2.1.1.

Within these\napproximations,\nthe payload capacity to low-Earth orbit (LEO) was calculated exactly. The Space Shuttle was used as a test\ncase for the launch vehicle program, which predicted a payload capacity of 28.442 MT to LEO, as opposed to an actual 29.5\nMT, 4 an error of 3.59%. Given that the error is expected to be _eatest for vehicles where the payload is a smali fraction of\nthe mass at burnout (such as the Shuttle, and not the Qahira launch vehicles proposed in Section 3.2.), this program was\nconsidered valid for use in designing the mission architecture.\n2.1.3.\nAerocapture\nProgram\n_ ...........\nThe Mars aerocapture\nphase of the mission was investigated\nusing a computer model Of the habitat module with aerosheH\nentering the Mars atmosphere\nat speeds of 8 to 13 km/s. Although it could not produce data on the thermal and aerodynamic\nissues, as it simply assumed lift and drag coefficients,\nit was useful in determining\nthe deceleration\nloads on the crew and liftto-drag ratio required for a successful aerocapture.\n2.2. Spreadsheets\nMicrosoft Excel was used to create spreadsheets\nto calculate mass and power budgets, ISRU requirements,\nhealth effects,\nrisk, and trans-Earth\ninjection.\nThe trans-Earth injection (TED spreadsheet\nwas the most complicated;\nit accepted data from\nprogram\n\nI\n\nMission.\n\nProbe\n\nthe trajectory\nburns.\n\nID\n\nand returned\n\nthe parameters\n\nof TEI such as the required\n\nchange\n\nin velocity\n\n(AV) and direction\n\nof\n\nm\nm\n\nU\n\nm\n\nU\n\nI\nm\nill\n\n3.\nHow the Mars Society Mission Will Send the First Humans to Mars\nA step-by-step\ndescription of the MSM is provided below. Further details on each system\n\nu\n\nand mission\n\nphase are given in the\n\nappropriate sub-section.\n2011: On July 1,2011 a Q3041 Launch Vehicle, part of the Qahira Interplanetary Transportation System, will send an Earth\nReturn Vehicle on a 3/2-orbit, low energy trans-Mars trajectory. The Earth Return Vehicle consists of a Crew Return\nVehicle and a methane-oxygen\nrocket stage. A second Q3041 launch on October 27,2011\nsends to Mars a cargo vehicle\nwith surface mobility containing liquid hydrogen feedstock, a 160-kWe nuclear reactor, and science equipment.\nA third\nQ3041 launches the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) on November 11,2011.\nThe MAV consists of a CRV and methane-oxygen\nrocket stage, identical to that on the ERV, with attached first stage and ISRU unit.\n2012: On August 24, 2012, the cargo payload aerobrakes into Mars orbit, then aerobrakes again to reach the Martian surface\nonce satisfactory\nconditions have been ascertained. After a quick preliminary\nscout, it will deploy the nuclear reactor, and\nplace a radio beacon at a site appropriate for the landing of the MAV, which will join the landed cargo on September 7, 2012.\nThe ISRU unit aboard the MAV will activate and be connected to the nuclear reactor and hydrogen feedstock, and begin\nmaking necessary methane, oxygen, and life support reserves.\n2013: The Earth Return Vehicle aerobrakes into a Mars orbit of slightly less than C3=0 and of period 3 sols on July 15, 2013.\nOn November 20, 2013, a second MAV intended for the 2016 mission and including a large science payload departs Earth on\na Q3041, followed by a Q3041 cargo launch containing liquid hydrogen for the 2016 mission and the pressurized\nrover to be\nused by both the 2014 and 2016 missions: ___ : - ::_:-:::\n2014: By early January, the ISRU unit\'s propellant manufacture\nis complete and it\nBack on Earth, verification\nthat the ISRU has succeeded is followed by the launch\nmodule aboard a Q3041.

On May 25, the hab and CRV reach Mars. The CRV will be reused and returns to Earth on a free\nreturn trajectory, while the habitat with the crew lands on the Martian surface after aerobraking,\nseveral orbits of Mars, and\nfinally descent to the surface. On July 4, the 2016 Mission cargo payload with pressurized\nrover and hydrogen arrives. The\n2016 mission MAV lands on September 15.\n\nm\nm\n\nII\n\nt\nIlll\n\n!\ni\n\nI\n\nIll\n\n=.-Z\nm\nIll\n\nm\n\nIt\nllll\n\nSecond\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nForum\n\nI\n\n2016: In January 2016, the 2014 Mission crew board the MAV, which launches them to rendezvous\nwith the ERV parked in\nMars orbit. Then, on January 27, firing first the ERV\'s and then the MAV\'s engines, both ERV and MAV accompany the\ncrew back to Earth. On December 25, 2015, the CRV that escorted the 2014 Mission returns on its free return trajectory from\nMars and aerobrakes into a C3=0 parking orbit, where it awaits the launch of the 2016 Mission crew in a stripped down\n("ghost") CRV aboard a Q1010. The 2016 Mission crew and hab launch aboard a Q 1010 and Q3041, respectively.\nThe crew\ntransfers to the hab after docking, after which the ghost CRV\'s QUS propels hab and ghost CRV partway to C3=0 for the\nrendezvous with the free-returned,\nfully functional 2014 CRV.

The two configurations\nused for the first Mars\nSociety Mission are the Q1310 and Q3041, with the Q1010 and Q3041 used on\nsucceeding missions.\n3.2.2.1.\nTerminology\nThe terminology\nfor the various QITS configurations\nis as follows: in the fourdigit code, the I st digit represents the number of QBCs on the 1 st stage; the 2 nd\ndigit represents the number of solid boosters; the 3_d digit represents the\nnumber of engines on the 2_d stage; and the 4 _ digit represents the number of\nengines on the 3 _dstage. For example, the Q3041 is composed of a 3-QBC 1st\nstage, 0 solid boosters, a 4-engine 2 _d stage, and a I-engine 3_d stage.\n3.2.2.2. Q3041 Configuration\nThis configuration\nconsists of a three QBC 1_tstage, a single QBC 2 _ stage,\nand a single QUS as the 3 _dstage. This configuration\nwill be used for all\nlaunches except the CRV/Crew\npayload, because it provides maximum lift\ncapability to Mars, 55 metric tons on a cargo trajectory.\nThe total mass at takeoff (including payload) is 2500 MT. Figure 3.2.2.2 depicts the Q3041.\n3,2.2.3.\nQ1310 Configuration\nThis configuration\nconsists of a single QBC 1st stage and a QUS 2 _d stage, with\nthree already-existing\nCastor-120 solid rocket boosters attached to the 1 st stage.\nIts purpose is to launch payloads which are heavier than what current launch\nvehicles such as the Proton can handle, but are so light that to place them on a\nQ3041 would be wasteful. In the MSM, the only use of the Q1310 is to lift the\n\n2014 CRV/Crew\npayload. A solid-propelled\nLaunch Escape System (LES) similar to that used for the Apollo and Soyuz\nprograms is provided through first stage burnout so that the crew can be recovered in the event of a launch failure.

Combined with the development costs\nof the new technology, this argues against nuclear propulgion as an option for human Mars missions possible within a decade.\nvelocities\n\nIll\n\nthe hab\n\nof the hab module\n\nMission\n\nwill\n\nwith\n\n-\n\nTrans\n\noptions.\n\nthe\n\naeroshell\n\nthe QUS,\n\npackaging\n\nrockets\n\nand other Launch\nOptions\nand its smaller\nsiblings,\nthe Q 1310\n\nMars\n\ninto\n\nthe Reference\n\nretro\n\n3.2.5.\nComparisons\nwith Magnum,\nNTR,\nThe MSM uses the Q3041 heavy lift vehicle,\n\nlaunch\n\nThis\n\nIt prevented\n\nthe hab\'s\n\ndown\n\noutbound\n\nMission\n\non top .....\n\norbit:\n\nfairing.\n\nas occurs\n\nthe hab module\'s\n\naccompany\n\ndifficulties.\n\nin low-Earth\n\nthese\n\nm\ni\n\nII!\n2--\n\nW\n\nrejected.\n\n,i :2 =\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\n_- _\n\nSecond\n\nTable 3.2.5.\n\nPropulsion\nMethod\n\nStorable (N2OJhydrazine)\nCryogenic (LOX/Hydrogen)\nNuclear Thermal\nIon\n\nLaunch\n\n20 MT Proton\n7\n5,7\nI, 7\n3, 7\n\nVehicle Rationale\nLaunch Vehicle with payload\n41 MT Q1010\n2\n6\n1\n3\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nForum\n\nto LEO\n151 MT Q3041\n\n80 MT Magnum\n2,4\n4\n1,4\n3,4\n\n1\n3\n\n1.

A 90-m high tower was designed for QITS. This tower is high enough to refuel the\nQ304 l\'s QUS; it is not necessary to have a walkway for crew to Q304 l\'s payload, as only the Q 1310 and Q 1010 will carry\ncrew, for which a walkway is provided.\n3.2.7\nTimeline of Earth Ascent\nThe description of launch events from T+0:00.0 to TMI for the MSM launches is provided in the following sections.\n3.2.7.1\nQ3041 Earth Ascent Timeline\nfor ERV, MAV/ISRU,\nand Cargo Launches\nTable 3.2.7.1 describes the path of the ERV, MAVflSRU,\nand Cargo launches into LEO.\nTable 3.2.7.1.\nCar ,,oTrajector\n-Type Ascent of 03041\nEvent\nTime\nX/km\nY/km\nVelocity\nZ-Vert.\n\nE\n\nw\n\nw\n\nm\n\nE\n\nm\nE\n\nE\n\nim\n\nT+0:00.0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(kin/s)\n0\n\n(o)\n0\n\nLiftoff @ 1.4 g\nClear tower\nT+0:06.5\n0\n.09\n.028\n0\nT+0:52.0\n1.8\n7.1\n.331\n25\nSpeed of Sound/Mach\n1\n67\nT+2:31.0\n94\n2.33\n68\nStage 1 separation\n@ 3.9 g\n163\n5.74\n86\nT+5:02.0\n646\nStage 2 separation\n@ 4.1 g\n90\n199\n7.39\nT+8:09.0\n1860\nStage 3 shut down @ 1.1 g/enter LEO\nThe TMI burn is calculated to C3=15 km2/s z, to reach up to 1.77 AU aphelion in the plane of Earth\'s orbit and sufficient to\nreach Mars with a wide launch window in any opportunity.\nTMi for the 2014 Mission launches of 2011 lasts 3 min 57 s for a\nchange in velocity AV = 3.91 km/s.

Upon the Stage 3 QUS shutdown, the Hab gets ready to dock with the CRV\ncontaining the crew.

The docking occurs in an orbit of 360 krn at velocity 7.69\nkm/s with period 1 hr 32 min. The fully assembled TMI vehicle then has a mass 239 MT, of which 140 MT is propellant.\nOf the two QUS stages at each end of the vehicle, with the hub and CRV sandwiched\nbetween, the QI310-launched\nQUS fires first. It fires for I rain 24 s, providing 0.75 km/s AV and raising the orbit to 360x3830 km with a period of 2 hr 10\nmin.

Mars Direct specifies the same two-year free return trajectory used by the MSM habitat, but gives a transit time to\nMars of 180 days, 18 whereas the actual two-year free return trajectory takes a maximum of 154 days. The importance\nof free\nreturn trajectory data for appropriate determination\nof payload capacity and crew safety called for extensive scrutiny of free\nreturn options for the Mars Society Mission.\nOf the different free return trajectories available, the fastest--lasting\ntwo years\nafter Mars flyby--was\nselected for its hastening of crew return in the event of an emergency.\n(Actually, faster returns to\nEarth are possible on trajectories\nusing a Venus flyby on the outbound transit; however, such trajectories\nare not available in\nall launch opportunities.)\nThe free return trajectory chosen for the crew launches on January 11, 2014; encounters\nMars on\nMay 25, 2014; and returns to Earth on December 25, 2015. Free return trajectories were also important to the MSM for\nreturning to Earth the CRV that escorts the 2014 habitat on the way to Mars.

The habitat, being sent on a much faster trajectory and entering the Mars atmosphere\nat 12.2 km/s, must have a\ndifferent aeroshell optimized for these higher velocities.\nComputer simulations of the aerocapture\nsuggested that lift-to-drag\nratios of 0.6-0.7 are sufficient for\nthe habitat entry, producing\ndecelerations\nthat peak around 67 g.

Table 3.5.1. itemizes the ERV mass\nbudget of the Reference Mission 2t and the ERV\nand MAV mass budgets of the Mars Society\nMission. The MSM CRV is conical with a base\n\n43\n\n44 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\ndiameter of 6.5 m and a height of 5.5 m. The ratio of the surface area of the Reference Mission ERV to that of the MSM\nCRV is 0.4295, and this figure was used to linearly scale several mass budget items from the RM to the MSM. Several\ndevices, such as the Reference Mission life-support\nsystem, were not scaled down from a RM crew of six to an MSM crew of\nfive, which can be approximated\nas a 20% margin for the MSM. The "CRV Earth Entry" column describes the mass budget\nof the CRV immediately\nprior to re-entering the Earth atmosphere\nwith the crew, the importance\nof which lay in calculating\nthe aerosheli necessary for returning to Earth. The "CRV Earth Capture" column describes the mass budget of the CRV that\nwill enter a C3=0 parking orbit immediately\nafter its aerobraking\nfor use in later missions.\nTable 3.5.1.

The hab power requirement\nof under 25 kWe is justified in section 3.7.2. The\nMAV will be primarily in utility mode during its stay on the Mars surface, requiring around 5 kWe of power. 23 ASP- 100 =\ntype nuclear reactor capable of 160 kWe and massing 9.3 MT, is more than able to meet these power needs, z4 With the\naddition of the hab 30 kWe nuclear reactor, a total of 190 kWe is available, providing a surplus of around 37 kWe to. recharge\nthe rover (see Section 3.8) and power science equipment.\nThe nuclear reactor aboard the cargo flight will be deployed using\nthe cargo lander mobility.\n3.6.2.\nLiquid Hydrogen\nFor an ISRU unit to create 30.67 MT of methane\n\nand 23 MT of water,\n\n10.22 MT of feedstock\n\nhydrogen\n\nare needed.\n\nm\n\nII\n\nlie\n\nTo\ni\n\nprovide for losses of 15% in the ISRU plant and through boiloff, the MSM sends 11.76 MT of liquid hydrogen in the cargo\nlander.

This is obviously not desirable.\nCountermeasures\nto freefall are suggested as a means of solving this problem, but are not very effective at present. Unless a\nset of countermeasures\nthat can reduce physiological\ndegadation\nin microgravity\nto acceptable levels is developed, the only\nreal alternatives to a vehicle that spins for artificial gravity are futuristic spacecraft that can accelerate (and then decelerate)\nfast enough to reach Mars in weeks, not months. To save on mass, the MSM uses an artificial gravity system with the habitat\ncounterbalanced\nby a burned-out QUS, as in Mars Direct.\n3.7.2.1. Rationale For Truss System\nIf 3 rpm is taken as the maximum rotational rate that we may subject humans to for long-duration missions, and Mars gravity\n(which is easier to provide than Earth gravity, but will of course condition the crew for the gravitational environment\nof their\ndestination) is desired, the distance between the spacecraft and its burned-out\nupper stage is calculated to be 125 meters. The\nmass of an aluminum truss was calculated according to the equation M = (6grnlp)/st, where the number 6 is for margin,\ndeployment mechanism, and cross-struts, g is the desired acceleration, m is the mass at one end of the truss which\nexperiences this acceleration, I is the length of the truss, p is the density of the truss material (in this case aluminum, 2,700\nk_m3), and s, is the tensile strength of the truss material (for aluminum 220,000 N/m2). "26 Oscillation was not deemed\nproblematic\nbecause the oscillation frequencies of the truss in all cases were much higher than the frequency of the system\'s\nrotation.\nA truss connection between the hab and burnt-out QUS was chosen over a tether because the truss had (1) a much\nlower risk of failure when impacted by a micrometeorite;\n(2) no risk of snag; (3) less energy stored in the tension of the\nconnecting structure which could be potentially damaging if released. An artificial acceleration due to gravity of 3.7 m/s 2\nwas chosen as a compromise between desired fitness of the crew and mass and mass budget concerns stemming from a larger\ntruss. The final mass budgeted to the artificial gravity system is enough for a truss system capable of bearing 6 times the\nexpected load.\n3.7.2.2.\nArtificial Gravity, CRV Escort, and Reaction Control\nAfter trans-Mars injection and transfer of the crew from the CRV escort in which they launched to the hab, the hab will\nseparate from the CRV, which will use its reaction control system to move a short distance away from the hab/QUS and out\nof the system\'s plane of rotation, to guarantee the CRV\'s safety in the unlikely event of truss failure. In case of emergency\nrequiring relocation to the CRV, the hab will have to spin down and dock. With modern technology, this process could be\nautomated.\n3.7.2.2.1.\nReaction Control System (RCS) Propellant\nNeeds\nIn addition to hydrazine reaction control propellant already needed for guidance and maneuvering,\nthe artificial gravity\nsystem introduces the requirement\nof RCS propellant for spin up, spin down, and turning of the entire system to allow the\nsolar panels to face the sun continuously.\nThe figure for necessary RCS propellant produced by this reasoning was increased\n\nI\n\ni\n\n47\n\n48 LPI Contribution No. 979\n\nby 20% so that the mission could still be carried out if one of the six RCS tanks was destroyed.\nThe total propellant need for\na normal mission was 1282 kg (646 kg for the artificial gravity system), so 1666 kg was budgeted for reaction control. In the\ncase of the free return trajectory,\nthe habitat\'s RCS propellant budget is pushed closer to the total amount available.\nHowever, in this case the CRV used to escort the hab to Mars could provide some of the reaction control needs.\n3.7.2.2.2.\nCRV Escort\n_:\nThe CRV is tagging along with the habitat on the trip to Mars to provide the crew with a backup spacecraft which can keep\nthem alive in the event a critical system on the habitat fails. One instance in which the CRV would be used is failure of the\nhabitat life support.\nThe hab life support system was designed with surpluses for 98% closed loop operation.\nThis means\nthat for up to 2% of the 900-day potential operational\nlifetime--I\n8 days total--the\nhab life support system can malfunction\nwithout endangering\nthe crew. If the malfunction\ncannot be repaired, the 18 day allowance grants ample time to spin down"\nthe hab, dock with the CRV, and transfer the crew.\nIn the unlikely event of unrepairable\nhabitat breach, the critical factor is the length of time it takes the crew to don\ntheir spacesuits.\nEven if no artificial gravity were present and the CRV and hab had remained docked, the port between the\ntwo would be closed to prevent a single breach from robbing air from both components.\nContinuing the explanation of why\nthe freefall situation is not necessarily\nsafer than the artificial gravity situation, the crew in both cases would perform a brief\n\nI\n\ni\n\nI\n\nm\n\nl\n\nEVA traveling between the airlocks of each vehicle in order to minimize further air loss (the docking port is not an airlock; it\nis meant to contain the air pressure of its respective vehicle while closed, and allow travel between two pressurized vehicles\nwhen open). True, the crew of the hab with artificial gravity would have the added complication\nof de-spinning\nand docking\nwith the CRV, but once in spacesuits the operational\nlifetimes of the suits would provide more than ample time for the\nautomated despinning\nand docking procedure.\nFinally, the likeliest form of hab breach is one that is small and repairable,\nand if the breach is not repairable,\nit is likely to be at least slow enough to allow adequate time for spacesuits, despin, and\n\nm\n\nn\n\nII\n\ndocking.\n3.7.3.\nHab power systems .............\nThe habitat module will use solar panels during its transit to Mars, regenerative fuel cells during power disruptions due to\nevents such as aerobraking,\nand nuclear power during the Mars surface mission.\nThe NASA Reference Mission version 1.0\nspecified a 29.4 kWe power need for the habitatZ7; however, the life support power requirements\nhave been reduced from 12\nkW to 5831 watts. 2s This reduces the total power requirement\nto below the 25 kWe level assumed for normal habitat\noperation.\n3.7.3.1.\nEn route power\nThe Habitat module has two identical\n\nsets of solar panels,\n\nwhich are identical\n\nto those of RM 3.0 including\n\nl\ni\n\ni\n\nI\n\ntheir power\n\nJ\n\noutput of 30kWe. The first is deployed at as an attachment to the center of the artificial gravity truss between the hab and\nQUS. It was decided to abandon this power along with the truss prior to Mars aerobraking\nbecause (1) the mass of an\nadditional set of solar panels should the hab need to remain in orbit was considered negligible, (2) a system to retrieve the\nfirst solar array would be complex, and (3) the mass of the retrieval system would cancel any mass benefit from not needing\nsecond solar array. After detachment\nof the truss and its solar array, the hab will most likely aerocapture directly to Mars\nsurface. However, if a dust storm or other complication\nprecludes direct aerocapture, the hab will deploy its second set of\n\ni\n\na\n\nsolar panels upon leaving the atmosphere\nand attaining parking orbit, subsisting on its regenerative\nfuel cells during\naerobraking and passage over the nighttime hemisphere\nof Mars.\n3.7.3.2.\nSurface power and deployment\nUpon reaching the Mars surface, the habitat will deploy a 30 kWe nuclear reactor which will be deposited by a robotic rover\nin a crater or similar shielded area. A nuclear power source w.as chosen as superior to solar panels or RFC\'s on the Martian\nsurface. Solar arrays are not efficient on the Mars surface where full sunlight is 485 W/m z at aphelion, and low angles of the\nsun, night, and atmospheric\ndust reduce the amount of light reaching solar arrays even further, causing the mass of the\nsurface solar power system to become prohibitive, z9 RFC\'s were rejected for hab contingency power because the lifetime of\nthe mass of RFC\'s budgeted for the Reference Mission is less than 24 hours, which requires that the crew tap into the existing\nMartian power grid in an unreasonably\nshort amount of time. This would be problematic in the event of hab landing farther\nthan 1 km from the target. Furthermore,\nlonger lasting RFC\'s would have too large a mass penalty. Use of a small nuclear\nreactor as in the Mars Society Mission provides virtually unlimited time to complete surface rendezvous.\nIf future\ndevelopment\nof solar arrays allows the substitution\nof solar for nuclear power on the surface, then such a substitution\nshould\nbe made.\n3.7.4.\nHabitat descent system\nThe habitat will decelerate to a soft landing\n\non the Martian\n\nsurface by (1) aerobraldng\n\nwith its aerosheil,\n\n(2) deploying\n\nthree\n\n50-m diameter parachutes,\nand (3) firing its four RL-10M engines to produce 80,000 pounds of thrust during the landing.\nThe propellant masses were calculated to produce 632 meters per second of AV required during the landing. 3\xc2\xb0 The habitat is\ndesigned with six landing legs (as are all landed components)\nrather than three or four so that it can still land if one of the\nlegs fails to deploy.\nThis would prevent it from suffering the fate of the DC-XA experimental\nsingle stage rocket, which\ntipped over in t996 and was destroyed during a vertical-landing\nattempt when one of its four legs did not deploy properly. 3_\n\n\'i\n\n!\n\ni\n\nH\nI\n\nJ\n\nm\n\nB\nm\n\nI\n\nSecond\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nForum\n\nLZ\nm\n\n3.7.5.\nHabitat in-situ resource utilization\nThe habitat carries 211 kg of liquid hydrogen to the Mars surface for use in life support in-situ resource utilization.\nAlthough\nit is not essential for the mission, inclusion of this hydrogen and a small ISRU plant for generating oxygen and water is an\nimportant safety feature, as it allows the crew to produce 1.9 MT of water and 0.1 MT of oxygen, sufficient for the crew to\nsurvive for 19 days on the surface of Mars running on open-loop life support, even if they do not land next to their MAV and\nm\n\ncargo lander. The water and oxygen produced could also be used to support the crew on the Mars surface\nevent that the life support system loses efficiency and can only achieve 97% closure for water and oxygen\n3.7.6.\nHabitat mass budget\nThe MSM habitat module launched\n\nin 2014 and its successors\n\nconsist of a 4.1 m tall cylinder\n\nfor 630 days in the\nloops.\n\n6.5 m in diameter\n\ncapped\n\non\n\ntop and bottom by hemi-ellipsoids\nthat increase the total height to 6.5 m. The ratio of the surface area of the MSM hab to\nthat of the Reference Mission is .7511, and this figure was used to linearly scale several mass budget items from RM to\nMSM. Several devices, such as the Reference Mission life-support\nsystem, were not scaled down from a RM crew of six to\nan MSM crew of five, which can be approximated\nas a 20% margin for the MSM.

The DIPS radiation level compares poorly to the combined\nlaunch pad radiation levels of the 30 and 160 kWe nuclear reactors; even though the SP-100 type reactors generate substantial\npenetrating\n13-and y-particle radiation upon activation on the Mars surface, their launch pad levels of < 1 Ci make them less\nthreatening\nto the public. The c\xc2\xa2-particles emitted by the DIPS 238pu are easy to shield, but given the recent experience\nof\nCassini, the 71 kg of 238pu required for a DIPS rover should not be made a prerequisite\nto human exploration\nof Mars.\nUnfortunately,\nthe RFC-powered\nrover has a limited range because it must return to the nuclear reactor for\nrecharging.\nThe mass available for RFCs on our rover is 7.387 MT, greater than the 6.5 ST 34 estimated to be necessary for\nthe rover to travel 500 km from its base and return. Therefore, the MSM rover is suitable for use in regional exploration.\n3.8.1.2.\nRover Mass Budget\nThe Reference Mission 1.0 assigns 16.5 MT rover to the pressurized rover, with 1.1 MT for DIPS. 35 The Mars Society\nMission\'s\nCRV-derived\nrover improves upon the structural mass of the rover by using a modified CRV, but the use of a\n\n49\n\n50 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nheavier power system, RFC\'s, raises the total rover mass to 19.536 MT.

The mass of the wheels, carriage, and other mobility requirements\nwas taken as 20% of the landed mass.\n3.8.2. Science and Exploration\nEquipment\nThe crew of the first human Mars mission will be on Mars for 612 days. During this time, they will conduct scientific\ninvestigations\nof Mars and perform experiments\nthat pave the way for the construction\nof a Mars base. To do so, they will\nmake use of the 13.7 MT of science equipment\nsent to Mars on the 2014 cargo and 2016 MAV flights. The 13.7 MT figure is\ndictated by the amount of space that arises naturally since the MSM vehicles are not all the same size and the launch system\nis designed to deliver the largest one. It was not chosen due to a desire to include that much payload.\nNevertheless,\nthis payload space is there and it would be foolish to waste it. Therefore, it was devoted to science\nequipment.\nThe NASA Reference Mission version 3.0 budgets 1.77 MT for scientific equipment including a field geology\npackage, geoscience laboratory,\nexobiology\nlaboratory,\ntraverse geophysical\ninstruments,\ngeophysical/meteorology\ninstruments, a !0-meter drill, meterology\nballoons, and a biomedical/biosciences\nlab. In addition it allots 600 kg of\ninstrumentation\nfor cruise science (space physics, solar studies, and astronomy).\nSuch instrumentation\ncould be included on\nthe ERV, which weighs 5 MT less than the Q3041 payload capacity; however, it should be noted that sending such\ninstruments into Mars orbit and then bringing them back onto a trans-Earth\ntrajectory is wasteful of propellant.\nIt might be\nbetter tO piggyback a robotic vehicle with this equipment\non the ERV flight. This is especially true since, unlike geological\ninvestigations\non Mars, cruise science can be automated.\nFor the MSM, the 13.7 MT of surface science equipment can include a 9 MT drill (capable of reaching hundreds of\nmeters depth), and 4.7 MT of other equipment.\nThis can include the 1114 kg of exobiological,\ngeological, and\nmeteorological\nequipment specified by the MERLIN study36; the 1770 kg science package in the NASA Reference Mission\n(which provides some overlap with the MERLIN equipment)37; and the 1000 kg advanced meteorology\nlaboratpry planned\nfor the Reference Mission\'s third crew. 38 After this, there are still 800 kg left over for discretionary\nscience.\n3.9. Risk analysis\nWhen sending humans to Mars, it is desirable to know the level of risk to human life in each plan. In this case, risk\nestimation is an inexact science that is made even more rough by the fact that many of the relevant systems do not yet exist.\nWhat is needed is a means of comparing mission architectures.\nThe best means of doing this are different for theoutbound,\nsurface, and return phases.\nSince the outbound and surface phases of the mission are similar among the Mars Direct, Reference Mission, and\nMSM proposals, we did not study them extensively.\nHowever, there is good reason to believe that the MSM is the safest\nduring these phases. The CRV escort provides backup to the habitat in many critical functions during the outbound transit,\nand can completely replace the hab in the event of hab failure; also, the launch vehicle is equipped with an Apollo-style\nLaunch Escape System, which is not the case in either Mars Direct or the Reference Mission.\nFinally, a serious question\nabout the Reference Mission\'s safety is surface power, which the habitat cannot provide. If the Mars surface rendezvous\nfails, even by a few kilometers, the habitat would be stuck on another planet without power. The crew, incapacitated by\nmonths of microgavity,\nwould likely perish.\nThe main safety drawbacks of the MSM are that the crew is placed on a new launch vehicle, and that the Mars\naerocapture is performed at high speed. Unfortunately,\nat the present time, we can say very little about the reliability of\nplanetary aerocapture\nfifteen years in the future; any numerical estimates would be very speculative.\nPartial answers to these\n\nD\n\nZ\nB\n\nI\n\nw\n\nm\n\nu\n\nm\n\nI\n\nw\n\nI\n\nI\n\nu\n\n.\n\nL_\n\nw\n\nSecond\n\n__=\nm\n\nINN\nw\n\nB\ni\n\nm\n\nI!!\n\nForum\n\nissues are that the presence of an escape tower and the use of all-proven engines on the Q 1310 might outweigh the "new\nlaunch vehicle" issue, and that a free return trajectory and fast transit time are worth the slightly riskier aerocapture.\nIt should be emphasized\nthat the risk analysis shown below was comparative.\nAn absolute estimation would require\nknowledge of the exact systems to be used; since a mission architecture\ndoes not include such specific components,\na\nbottoms-up\nrisk analysis of this kind was impossible.\nAbsolute risk estimation would also require analysis of factors such as\nradiation, which do not vary appreciably between the three architectures\nevaluated here, although it should be noted, the\nMSM CRV provides approximately\n13 Jcm z of shielding, the hab, 17 ffcm 2. To compare mission architectures,\nit is\nappropriate to model the risk instead based on failures at the level of spacecraft, rocket engines, and the tasks which these are\ne_pected to perform.\nIt was decided to estimate the probability of losing the crew during Earth return (that is, the inbound phase) as a\nfunction of six parameters:\nthe probability per engine of a rocket engine having to be shut down, r; the probability\nper engine\nof a rocket stage exploding when fired, R; the probability of a Mars orbit rendezvous failing, f; the probability of a CRV or\nCRV-type capsule failing, p; the probability of a habitat failing, q; and the probability of losing the crew during Earth\naeroentry,\n\nw\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nK.

However, a variety of other possibilities\nwere examined, as\nseen in Table 3.9.B.\nTable 3.9.B.

Several times, our team considered removing it from the plan. However, since it cuts the return risk by\napproximately\nhalf, and also provides a CRV to accompany the next outbound crew, the ERV was left in the mission plan.\n\nW\n\nm\n\nB\nW\n\nE.....\n\ni\n\n3.10.\nBeyond the First Mission\nThe flexibility of many Mars Society Mission aspects allows for a number of options for the 2016 and later missions.\n3.10.1.\nIncorporation\nof Future Technologies\ninto QITS\nWhile the LOX/Hydrogen\nbased QITS is all that is needed for the Mars Society Mission plan, and is the MSM\'s\nrecommended launch system, it would be fully compatible with upgrades such as Magnum-style\nliquid flyback boosters\n(LFBB\'s), which in any case require a core stage such as the QBC and QUS. One such configuration,\nplayfully dubbed the\nFatCat, could use two pairs of LFBB\'s arranged in two catamarans on both sides of a QBC as its 1st stage, a second QBC as\nits 2 "d stage, and a single QUS as its 3_ stage to send 73 MT trans-Mars on a single launch. However, it should be\nemphasized\nthat upgrades such as the FatCat\'s LFBB\'s are neither necessary nor directly planned for by MSM, and thus\nshould not be included in calculating the MSM\'s development cost. A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) as a fourth stage could\nincrease the Q3041 lift capability to Mars to approximately\n70 MT.\n" .....\n3.10.2.\nCrewed Launches of 2016 and Later\nThis section is designed to explore additional possibilities for later crewed launches using QITS.\nWhile it is possible to launch the crews of succeeding missions in the same manner as the 2014 Mission, a more economical\noption is to launch crews aboard a lightweight, "ghost" CRV stripped of life support and food, all of which will not be\nnecessary during the brief transit from Earth to the orbiting hab. Instead, the same reserves that allow 3.8 days of open loop\noperation during a CRV\'s return from Mars provide ample life support ascent to the hab. This lighter vehicle allows for the\nuse of a Q 1010 and elimination\nof the Castor-120 solid rocket boosters.\n\n51\n\n52 LPI Contribution\n3.10.2.1.\n\nNo. 979\n\nGhost\n\nCRV\n\nThe ghost CRV is identical to the fully functional CRV\'s used elsewhere\nin the Mars Society Mission (see Section 3.5.) but\nwithout food or a recycling life support system, giving it a mass of 11.088 MT as opposed to 15.951 MT for a fully functional\nCRV.\n3.10.2.2, Q1010 Earth Ascent Timeline for 2016 Ghost CRV with Crew and LES Launch\nThe 2016 crew launch involves first a Q3041 launch with a habitat, as in the 2014 crew launch. However, the crew launches\nin an 11.088 MT ghost CRV that is light enough to be launched by a Q1010 - that is, a Q1310 without the solid boosters.\nAfter the initial QUS shutdown, orbit circularization\noccurs at 360 km and lasts 1.3 seconds, for a change in velocity AV =\n0.04 km/s. The 63.6 MT vehicle is now ready to rendezvous\nwith the habitat. Its mass breaks down into the 11.1 MT CRV\nand the 18.0 MT dry QUS with 34.5 MT propellant.\nThe smaller vehicle--that\nis, that launched by the Q1010 consisting of ghost CRV, crew, and QUS---carries\nout up\nto 130 rrgs of rendezvous\nmaneuvers using 2 MT propellant and leaving 32.5 MT. The docking occurs in an orbit of 360 km\n\nm\n\niNi\ng\n\nW\n\nm\n\nI\n\nat velocity 7.69 km/s with period 1 hr 32 min. The fully assembled TMI vehicle then has mass 229.6 MT, of which 135.5\nMT is propellant.\n3.10.2.3.\nTrans-Mars\nInjection of 2016 Hab_tatwith\nCrew and 2_014 CRV\nOf the two QUS stages at each end of the vehicle, with the hab and ghost CRV sandwiched\nbetween, the Q 1010-launched\nQUS fires first. It fires for 1 rain 14 s, providing 0.68 krrds AV and raising the orbit to 360x3410 krn with a period of 2 hr 5\nmin. The crew transfers to the hab and the QUS and its ghost CRV are then released. The Q3041-1aunched\npayload (QUS\n"and hab) is then accelerated by the QUS\'s single RD0120 engine. This fires for 2 rain 44 s, providing 2.51 k_s Deita V and\nraising the orbit to C3=0. Here the crew can dock with the CRV left behind at that energy by a previous mission, using up to\n130 m/s of AV for rendezvous maneuvers. After docking, the vehicle consists of a QUS (18 MT dry with 28 MT propellant),\n47 MT hab, and 16 MT full CRV. The QUS then fires its engine again for 1 rain 4 sec, burning all its remaining propellant to\nprovide AV=l.32 km/sec. As the ghost CRV is designed to carry the crew back to the Earth\'s surface intact, there is no\nreason not to land the ghost CRV intact even without crew. When the ghost CRV\'s QUS burns out and the CRV jettisoned,\nthe perigee of its orbit is only 360 km. If the ghost CRV\'s orbit is allowed to decay in a controlled manner, it can be\nrecovered, refurbished (ne_cessary only for the aeroshel!), and reused to launch the 2018 and succeeding crews.\n3.10.3. Additional Applications\nof the CRV\nThe redundancy of the CRV used by the Mars Society Mission is the basis for additional applications unrelated or merely\nincidental to sending hum_a_nst_oMars.\n3.10.3.1.Lifetime\nof a Typical CRY\nThe availability of CRV\'s for additional applications\nis exemplified\nby the CRV that accompanies\nthe crew on the 1st mission\nin 2014. On December 25, 2015, the CRV returns on a free return trajectory from its mission as an escort to the outbound\n2014 crew. It is then available to act as escort again for the 2016 crew. After free-returning\nto Earth and aerobraking a\nsecond time, its aeroshell is likely to have ablated to where it cannot aerobrake again. Two such CRV\'s will be produced by\nthe I st mission: the aforementioned\noutbound escort to be used by the 2014 and 2016 outbound crews, and the inbound escort\nfrom the 2014 mission (of the ERV and MAV, whichever is not used to land the crew on Earth), which will be used as an\noutbound escort by the 2018 mission. Starting with the 2016 mission, one re-usable CRV will be produced per mission, each\nto be used by the mission four years later. After the second aerobraking\nat Earth, the CRV can be used for other pUrpoSes.\n3.10.3.2.\nSpace Station\nCRV\'s retired from interplanetary\nspace could augment the International\nSpace Station. Forevery\nCRV added, the ISS\nbenefits from increased (I) crew capacity by five, (2) power by 81 kWe (the same array that produces 30 kWe at Mars\naphelion produced 81 kWe at Earth aphelion), and (3) volume by 55 m3 minus space already taken up by equipment.\nCompared to the planned capabilities of the ISS, a single CRV would increase the crew capacity, power, and volume of the\nISS by 71%, 88%, and 5% respectively. 39\n3.10.3.3.\nIncreased\ncrew capacity\nThe aeroshells of twice-aerobraked\nCRV\'s could be refurbished\nfor additional Earth aerobraking.\nThe CRV\'s could then be\nused to expand future Mars missions by sending additional crew, possibly by launching crew in fully functional (instead of\nghost) CRV\'s aboard Q1310\'s.\nAs 0niy the hab isequipped\ntO land on Mars With people, the crew would spend the time in\ntransit in the CRV, then transfer to the hab briefly to aerobrake to Mars surface while the CRV free-returns\nto Earth.

As with any humans-to-Mars\nmission design, the specifics of all components\nare being\ncontinuously\nimproved upon, for instance, we are designing the exact fuel tank configuration\nof the QBC, QUS, and MAV\nstages, and considering\nnew launch vehicle and Mars ascent ideas. We are also determining\nthe applicability of MSM\ncomponents\nto human and robotic missions to Luna, Saturn, and the asteroids, and will plan new components.\n6.\nOutreach\nEfforts\nAs members of an organization\ndedicated to furthering the robotic and human exploration of Mars, our team has done\nconsiderable public outreach, and will continue these in the future.

We have sent telemetrycontrolled robots to the far reaches of our solar system as our hands, eyes and ears. We will gain further knowledge\nm\n\nabout our past and the nature of the universe by sending a human mission to Mars. To accomplish\nthe scientific\nobjectives\nthat help achieve this goal, a human must interact with the Mars surface in real time. This requires an\nExtravehicular\nMobility Unit (EMU) that will ensure the safe and comfortable\nsurvival of the human during\nExtravehicular\nActivities (EVAs).\nKey parameters\nin designing systems for use on a Mars EMU include the planned length of the mission, the\nnumber of EVAs per EMU, and the indigenous\nresources and physical limitations of Mars. The required EVA\nduration from the HEDS Reference Mission is 4 hrs, with a goal of 8 hrs. Assuming a 6 person crew, a 500 day max\nsurface stay [1], and that each astronaut performs two EVAs every three days on average (0.66 EVAs per day per\nperson), this leads to 2000 total individual EVAs. If each person has one suit, it will have to withstand use on 333\nEVAs.

The oxygen required for 4 hr to 8 hr\nEVAs varies from .092 kg to 1.816 kg depending on EVA length and activity level. Here 0.595kg O2 is used to\nsupply an 8 hr EVA with average exertion. [3] High-pressure oxygen storage parameters are compared with\ncryogenic oxygen storage.\n.................\nHigh-pressure oxygen gas storage on the current space shuttle EMU can be modified for the Martian\nenvironment. The current system contains high-pressure canisters for the storage of oxygen in the Primary Life\nSupport System (PLSS). Two rechargeable primary tanks contain all oxygen needed for the astronaut to breathe\nduring an 8 hr EVA at 6.2Mpa (900psia). In the event of primary system failure, two smaller tanks charged to 41.4\nMPa (6000 psia) are backup.\nThese provide oxygen to the\nastronaut at a much higher\nrate in purge mode for up to\n30 minutes. These are not\nrechargeable,\nthe equipment\nto re-pressurize them with the\nnecessary amount of oxygen\nis prohibitively heavy. (For\n60-minute backup, the mass\nwould be at 2.38kg and\nvolume at around 5.10L at\n6000psia.)\nThis storage system has\nlimitations. The thick walls\nnecessary to contain the high\npressures, while not a concern\nin micro-gravity,\nare too\nmassive to use on Mars. The\nlife support system must be\nphysically small, requiring a\nmore volume-efficient method\nof storing oxygen.

Leakage and bursting\nare dangers due to the explosiveness of the pressure as well as the flame-enhancing characteristics of oxygen.\nA second proposed method of oxygen storage uses cryogenic tanks to store liquid oxygen. Such a system could\nuse a single oxygen storage device for an 8 hr EVA as well as the 30 minutes of backup. Because it requires too\n\nForum\n\n57\n\n58 LPI Contribution No. 979\n\nmuch energy to warm a large quantity of supercritical\noxygen passing through the suit during a purge situation,\nsecondary oxygen tanks like those used in current EMUs should provide backup supply. For rechargeability,\nthe\nsecondary canisters may be modified to be filled with liquid oxygen and then warmed to ambient temperature,\nat\nwhich the oxygen will boil, pressurizing the tank.\nThe proposed tank design is adapted from one suggested by Lockheed\nMartin for the space shuttle EMU. [3]\nThis consists of an inner tank containing\ncryogenicliquid\nsurrounded\nby a liquid-cooled\nshield (LCS) (Figure 1).\nThis is in turn surrounded\nby multi-layer\ninsulation\n(MLI) and a vacuum jacket.\nThis system is designed\nto\nminimize heat flow into the liquid so that little vapor venting is required to relieve boiloff pressure. The LCS is key.\nOutflow liquid oxygen from the bottom of the tank is routed around the LCS to cool it to subcritical\ntemperatures\nand absorb any heat transferred into the system before it can warm the fluid within. This design reduces heat input to\nalmost zero, and relies on a liquid positioning\ndevice (LPD) to keep the cryogenic oxygen over the outlet at the\nbottom, however, Mars gravity makes this precaution unnecessary.\nUpon exiting the LCS, the oxygen is warmed to\nbreathing temperature through heat exchange with the power source and liquid cooling ventilation garment (LCVG)\nexplained below.\nThis cryogenic system addresses the concerns of a portable oxygen supply system in a Martian EVA suit.\nUsing a cryogenic storage method reduces both tank mass and volume over traditional high-pressure\nsystems.\nThis\nallows for the expansion of the system to carry more oxygen if a longer EVA is desired.\nBoth the cryogenic\nand\nhigh pressure systems can satisfy the life support oxygen flow rate, pressure, and partial pressure requirements,\nbut\nthe cryogenic system can do so with less mass and more oxygen.\nTable 5: Comparison\n\nHigh Pressure 02\nSystem\n4 Tanks total\n\nData for two different oxygen sto rage sTstems.\nPrimary System\nPrimary System\nTotal System\nVolume\nVolume\nMass(empty)\n16.88 L\n19.83 L\n4.4 kg\n\n7.87 L\n\n4.0 kg\n\n10.82 L\n\ni\n\nI\n\ni\n\nm\n\n[]\n\nz\ni\nPrimary Tank\n02 Mass/Mass\n0.125\n\nPrimary Tank\nPressure\n6.2 MPa\n900 psia\n\nCryogenic\nOxygen System\n3 Tanks total\n\nIi\n\n0.149\n\n< 930 kPa\n< 135 psia\n\nI\n\ni\n\na\n\nw\n\nm\n\nFor subsequent missions, a self-contained\noxygen production\natmosphere\nis desirable to produce breathable oxygen dynamically\nthis is solid oxide electrolysis.

Eventually,\nfurther miniaturization\nand insulation advances may allow\nthe unit to become a standard component in the EMU life support system.\nGlow discharge and permeation\nis another way to produce oxygen from the Mars atmosphere.\nA reaction\nchamber heats gas from the Martian atmosphere to 450\xc2\xb0C. A glow discharge is generated from a silver electrode that\ndisassociates\ncarbon dioxide into carbon monoxide\nand atomic oxygen.\nOxygen is separated\nusing a silver\nmembrane.\nA silver lattice structure is selectively permeable\nto the atomic oxygen, allowing it to pass across the\nmembrane\nand recombine\nto molecular oxygen on the other side, where it can be accumulated\nand used for the\nastronaut\'s\nneeds. Carbon monoxide is vented to the atmosphere\n[6]. The system is at a low level of technological\nreadiness and currently requires 2 kW to produce lkg of usable oxygen in one day. However, the system does not\nbring with it any complications\ninvolving dust collection and CO2 pumping, and operates at significantly\nlower\ntemperatures than solid oxide electrolysis. The system\'s current status implies that this technology\nwill someday be\ncompetitive\nwith other oxygen production techniques for Martian exploration\n[7].\nSeveral methods exist to remove carbon dioxide. Lithium hydroxide scrubbers have been used extensively\non\nnuclear\nsubmarines\nand past\nspontaneously\nand exothermically\n\nspace missions\nincluding\nthe Apollo\nprogram.\nLithium\nhydroxide\n(LiOH)\nreacts with carbon dioxide (COz) to produce solid lithium carbonate (Li2CO3).\n2LiOH(_) + 2H20_)\n2 LiOH-H20(_)\n2LiOHeH20(s) + CO2(g)\nLi2CO3(s) + 3HzO(g_\n= -25.2kcal/mol\n\nW\n\nThis system has been successfully used to capture exhaled CO2 and convert it into solid Li2CO3 on past space\nflights.\nHowever, the reaction chemistry causes regenerating\nLiOH to be difficult, making LiOH scrubbers nonreusable. The technique is less than ideal for a prolonged mission where scrubbers for hundreds of EVAs would\nhave to be brought from Earth.\nMetal oxides have also been used in past missions. This system relies on the reaction chemistry\nof metals to\ntake carbon dioxide out of the system. While metal oxide canisters are reusable, the heavy metal substrates cause\n\nlif\n\nE\nm\nP\n\nm\n\nB\nW\n\nm\n\nw\n\nsignificant\nincreases in system mass and volume. This problem can be ignored when the system is deployed in\nmicro-gravity,\nbut it makes the system impractical in environments\nwhere mass is a limiting factor. [12]\nThe DARA system, a carbon dioxide removal technique that utilizes Solid amines, is the better option. This\nsystem, co-developed by the European Space Agency and the German National Space Agency, uses a porous resin\nas a carrier for series of weak basic amine groups. The mechanism of reaction is:\n(3)(R-NH2)\n+ CO2 +H20\n(R-NH3\n\xc3\xb7 + HCO3")\nThe Solid amine matrix (type DOR\'SA-028),\nproduced\nby Bayer A.G. is composed\nof a extremely\nporous\npolystyrene.\nParticle size ranges from 0.5-to 1.2 ram, and it is regenerative.- When CO2 load capacity has been\nreached, 38.1 kg of CO2 per kilogram\nof amine at 4kPa partial pressure,\nthe carbon dioxide\nbonded to the\npolystyrene\nmatrix can be released by altering the equilibrium\nof the reaction through a change in pressure or the\naddition of heat.

This would satisfy the life support requirement\nto\nfilter out humidity: ......................\n2_;:::_ =- == _ ..............\nA critical life support consideration\nis maintaining\na thermal balance within the Mars EMU. Current space suits\nare designed to function in a vacuum. However,\nfor the Mars EMU, convective\nheat loss through the atmosphere\nmust be considered.\nThe range of temperatures\ncomfortably\ntolerated by humans is about 18\xc2\xb0C to 27\xc2\xb0C [ 18].\nCurrent EM\'U\'s consist of a Liquid Cooling and__V_e_nti!_atignGarment (LCVG) and insulating materials [19].\nCold water, fed through the LCVG tubes, picks up heat as it circulates throughout the body [87]. The LCVG then\nseparates into two streams, one directed to a sublimator and the other directed to a contaminant\ncontrol system [24].\nThe sublimator convects heat and water vapor to the atmosphere\n[87]. The insulating materials consist of aluminized\nMylar plastic, unwoven Dacron, and Orthofabric;\nthese symhetics can protect from a temperature range of-129\xc2\xb0C\nto\n148\xc2\xb0C, which is sufficient for the Mars temperatures.\nChallenges\nin developing\na Mars EMU include heat convection\nto the Mars atmosphere\nand EMU thermal\naccumulation\n[18]. The E_\nheatsources\nan_ heat sinks are listed as follows.\n\nill\n\ni\nm\n\nII\n\n|\ni\n\nTable 6: EMU Heat Sources and Sinks\nHeat Sources\n\nHeat Losses\n!\n\nBody Heat\nFuel Cell\nSolar Heat\n\n0 - 560 W\n0 - 150 W\n0 - 120 Wm 2 + 20%\n\nWind\n\n300 -730 W\n\nCryogenics\nBoots\n\n7-15 W\nMinimized\n\nTotal Range\n\n0 - 850 W\n\nTotal Range\n\nm\n\n300 - 750 W\n\nm\ni\n\nSolar heat on Mars is nominally 590 Wm -2 with +20% variation due to the perihelion-aphelionposifi0ns.\nThe\nwhite exterior of the suit will absorb only an estimated 25% of the heat, reducing the solar effect. The EMU power\nsupply (here a fuel cell) generates excess heat that must be relieved for efficient operation. Convection\nheat losses\ndue to atmosphere\nthrough the EMU surface can range from 300 W to 725 W [23]. Oxygen from cryogenic storage\nmust be heated to breathe. In response to the cold martian temperatures,\nthe solution proposed by Hamilton Standard\nis the creation of an external thermal garment.\nHowever, for thennal]ns_ation\nto be effective on M_ii_iye_ng\nUp\nto four inches thick will be required [23].\nAccording\nto Hamilton\nStandard, the solution to thermal regulation in the suit is passive heat rejection: EMU\ninsulation is minimized\nand allows heat to escape to the Mars atmosphere.\nIf heat loss is too great, a thermal\novergarment,\nstored on the EMU support cart, can be donned. Hamilton Standard conducted tests demonstrating\nthe\nease of donning and doffing the external thermal garments [23] but thick garments hamper mobility. If the LCVG\nunit is to be used as needed on the Mars EMU, a sublimator\ncannot be used as there is a problem with its heat\nexchange mechanics\nOn Nlm\'s. tg7] Wind _s_peed may not dissipate\nSufficient heai, _requ_ng an atix]li_y cooling\ndevice.

It is designed for a vacuum and the atmospheric pressure\non Mars, 1% of Earth pressure, will inhibit sublimation\n[87]. A sublimator also vents valuable water, preventing the\nMars EMU from remaining a closed system. A convection\nradiator is another alternative,\nwarm water from the\nLCVG\ncirculates\nthrough\na finned radiator\non the EMU backpack.\nThe radiator convects\nheat to the Mars\natmosphere\n\nbut requires\n\na large finned radiator\n\narray.\n\n.\n\ni\n\nw\n\ni\n\nI\n\nM\n\nm\ni\n\nI\n\n..........\n\nB\nTable 7: Sample\n\nMetal\n\nDimensions\nRadiative\nM\n\nSurface\n\nArea\n\nreouired\n\nHeat Pump\n\nSystem (MHHP)\nHCI Tests\n\n0.305 m x 0.610 m x 0.914\n1.49 m2\n112.2 kg\n56\xc2\xb0C\n440 W\n\naK_\n\nRadiator"temperature\nHeat Radiation\nDuration\nPower\n\nHydride\n\n20 W with -10%\n\nMars Mission Requirements\n0.305 m x 0.457 m x 0.080 m\n0.261 m 2\n\n=- i i\n\nJ\n\n7.35 kg\n80\xc2\xb0C\n125 W\n\n4hrs\n(approx.)\n\nm\n\n4hrs, replacement\nefficiency\n\n20 W with -10%\n\nin cart\nefficiency\nm\n\nu\n\nB\n\nIR\n\nSecond\n\nr_\nw\n\nIt\n\ni\nw\nI\n\nm\nm_\n\nI\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nA Regenerable\nNonventing\nThermal Sink (RNTS) as proposed by Hydrogen\nConsultants,\nInc (HCI) is a\npractical option\xe2\x80\xa2 The system uses Metal Hydride Heat Pumps (MHHP) and a blackbody-type\nradiator [89]. The low\ntemperatures\non Mars would facilitate heat radiation to the ambient atmosphere.\nMars heat radiation requirements\nare lower because the bulk of EMU cooling is from atmospheric\nconvection.\nThe amount of heat that the MHHP can dissipate varies with the ambient temperature\non Mars and the temperature\nof the radiator surface.\nThe following figure illustrates different radiator temperatures\nwith corresponding\nheat\ndissipation. The MHHP can replace sublimator as the cooling mechanism for the LCVG.\nThe MHHP consists of an\naluminum\nradiator lined with tubes of hydride A (Lat.lNi4.6Sn0.4) [89]. Tubes of hyrdride B (MM Ni4.sA10.5) are\nplaced in the radiator cavity. Warm water from the LCVG runs over the hydride B tubes and heats the metal\nhydrides, causing the release of hydrogen.\nThis hydrogen is fed into the hydride A tubes and is deposited\nonto\nhydride A, increasing radiator surface temperature which dissipates heat to the Mars atmosphere\n[89]. Hydride B is\nthe cooling source and hence its temperature be kept just above 273 K to prevent the cooling water from freezing.\nUsing two containers with hydrides A and B eliminates venting; the containers\ncan also be recharged at the base\n[89]. Compared to the current EMU, the LCVG configuration\nwill remain unchanged.\nThe only major change is\nusing the MHHP in place of the water-fed sublimator.\nThus a solution to thermal regulation to stay well within the required temperature\nrange of 9.85\xc2\xb0C to 43.85\xc2\xb0C\ninvolves utilizing the environment\nas well as implementing\nan active auxiliary thermal control system. Areas of\ncontinued research include other sources of heat loss, MHHP power requirements,\nand effectiveness\nof multiple\ninsulative layers.\nThe radiation environment\non the surface of Mars is more difficult to deal with than for previous manned\nmissions for two reasons. First, the radiation that astronauts will be exposed to will be of a different variety than was\npreviously\nencountered.\nAlso, the energies and fluxes of the radiation will be much higher than designers have had\nto previously\nconsider. Complicating\nthis fact is the extended duration of the mission.\nMissions to Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) or to the surface of the moon were of short enough duration that weight savings on radiation insulation could\nbe justified by the brevity of the mission. [2] There are three kinds of radiation on Mars:\nUltraviolet\n\nradiation\n\nconsists of high frequency\n\nelectromagnetic\n\nwaves\n\ntraveling\n\nthrough\n\nspace\n\nat the speed of\n\nlight. The fact that this type of radiation is composed entirely of energy (and therefore has no mass) makes it\nrelatively easy to counteract. This type of radiation is a familiar concern on Earth, and significant research has\nbeen done into inexpensive and effective methods of blocking it.\nAnother type of radiation is solar particles, mostly protons, and due to their particulate\nnature these particles\nwill be inherently more difficult to block. On Earth, much of this radiation is deflected by the magnetic field protons have a charge, and are deflected by the large field produced by the Earth. Mars does not have any\nappreciable\nmagnetic field. Solar Particle Events (SPEs), when the sun periodically\nreleases high concentrations\nof high-energy\nparticles in the form of solar flares and solar storms, are the real danger.\nVery high-energy\nCosmic Radiation\ndoses fluctuate in\nvice versa. These\nradiation; however,\nthese particles are\nlevels.\n\nheavy particles coming from neighboring\ngalaxies are commonly\nreferred to as Galactic\n(GCR). Although this radiation spreads throughout\nthe universe at a constant rate, surface\nresponse to solar activity, solar minimums corresponding\nto the highest levels of GCR and\nparticles will not be detected in large quantities when compared to the normal flux of solar\ntheir extremely high velocity and larger mass make them a serious consideration.\nAgain,\nnot a concern on Earth, as the magnetic field and thick atmosphere\ndeflect most dangerous\n\nTable 8: _\nNASA radiation\nExposure Interval\n30 Days\n1 Year\nCareer\n\nexposure limitsfor LEO missions _5]\nBlood Forming organs\nOcular Lens\n25\n50\n100-400\n\n100\n200\n400\n\nSkin\n150\n300\n600\n\nm__\n\nThe normal\n\nm\n\n[]\nI\n\ni\n\nbackground\n\nradiation\n\nexposure\n\non Earth is about\n\n0.4 rem/yr.\n\nThe occupational\n\nlimit for high risk\n\njobs is 5 rem/yr.

[3] NASA has also set limits for radiation exposure for missions into low earth orbit (LEO).\n\nForum\n\n61\n\n62\n\nLPI Contribution No. 979\n\nm\nAlthough no limits have been set for a Mars mission, reasonable estimates can be derived, assuming an overall\ndosage maximum of 100 rem for the entire mission, of which, 5-10 rem will come from exposure during EVAs.\nTechnology\nfor blocking\nultraviolet\nradiation\nalready has been developed\nto a relatively high degree.\nQuality\nplastics are good enough to stop even the high levels of UV radiation on Mars, and protective coatings can be\napplied to almost any surface.\nBackground\nsolar radiation, although dangerous\nif unshie!ded, _ is well blocked by relatively thin layers of shield\nmaterial. Taking SPEs into account complicates\nthe situation. It would not be practical to provide the astronauts with\nenough shielding to withstand\nadvance.\nAfter one is detected\n\nu\nz\n\nm\n\ng\n\nSPEs at all times.

The\nGCR component\nof the background\nradiation on Mars is too energetic to be shielded against without unacceptable\nquantities of material [7]. Moreover,\nthese fluxes are low enough to justify the omission of this extra mass. Solar\nparticle events can be protected against through the use of a storm shelter. By shielding against UV and background.\nsolar radiation, predicting SPEs, and calculating that the GCR radiation is not enough to be harmful, the requirement\nto protect the astronauts from radiation is satisfied.\n2.2 Communications\n.....\nIn the design of this extemal-to-EMU\ncommunications\nsystem, the assm:nption was made that there would be no\nexisting infrastructure\nfor communications\n(such as a satellite network or local area network) for the first manned\nmission.

If the astronaut is traveling at a quick clip of 5mph for 4 hrs (this is, for the goal\n8hr EVA = 4 hr out and 4hr back), that is only a distance of 20 miles or about 32krn.

In addition, it minimizes the power required for transmissions,\nallowing for\nhand-held\nsystems (or EMU systems) of a practical size and weight. There is no single point of failure since the\nRWN is organized in a flat configuration,\nall users with the same equipment rather than certain transmitters acting as\ncentralized relay points.\nCellular phones on Earth rely on being within range of a base station at all times. Because Mars is not yet\npopulated\nWith base stations at regular intervals, cellular networks Cannot be used. RWN can adapt to a changing\nnetwork topology. This involves adapting to roaming base stations as well as compensating\nif one or more of them\nshould fail. Haas and Tabrizi [2] propose having each mobile unit function also as a base station, negating the need\nfor mobiles to remain within a certain radius of a fixed base station. [35]\nThe use of mobile base stations presents another challenge. On Mars, this allows the astronauts to communicate\naround obstacles and even out of line-of-sight\nof the lander base. Because of this mobility, a more sophisticated\nrouting protocol that accounts for a changing network topology is required.\nThere are two general alternatives\nfor routing a protocol. Proactive protocols continuously\nevaluate the network\ntopology and update this information\nso that whenever a call needs to be made, the correct route can be immediately\ndetermined.\nReactive protocols do a global search for the correct route at the time the call is requested.\nClearly\nproactive protocols have a faster response time for calls that are made, yet require a constant flurry of information\nbeing sent to update the routes even when no calls are being made. Reactive protocols, because of their idleness, do\nnot tie up the transmission\nmedium until a call is required, yet may cause a significant delay in the establishment\nof\na call.\nFor RWN purposes, Haas and Tabrizi propose a hybrid of these two extremes - Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP).\nThis protocol performs proactive routing in the local neighborhood\nof a transmitter,\nbut uses reactive methods for\nany long-distance\ncommunications.\nThis limits the high traffic demands because the continual updates only occur in\na limited area (relative to each transmitter),\nand also avoids the big delays associated\nwith a purely reactive protocol.\nHaas [38] has tested this protocol in simulation by using a 10 by 10 mile _did.

Their scientific\nuses have proven especially\nviable in harsh\nconditions\nsuch as those found in Antarctica,\nwhere the ruggedness\nand isolation of the region make a robust\ncommunication\nnetwork necessary. [40] There are two general varieties of repeater stations: active and passive. For\nuse on Mars, an active station is best since passive stations tend to have high attenuation because it only reflects the\nsignal received instead of amplifying it before transmitting,\nas an active repeater does. Also, a repeater station with\nduplexing capabilities will be useful, as it will allow the Station to receive and transmit signals at the same time. [41]\nThe ideal repeater station will be lightweight and capable of being used for navigation.

[43] On Mars, a more\nrobust and reliable system is needed such as the MastrlII repeater station designed by General Electric.[44]\nSuch\nmodels are frequently used by military agencies because they guarantee not onlY a range of at least 10 km but are\nalso able to withstand\nharsh and unusual conditions.\n[43] Most commercial\nrepeater stations offer a variety of\nfrequency\n\nranges,\n\nin both UHF and VHF range.

[44] This can vary however, depending\non\nthe size of the station; the smaller, desktop models output 10 - 25 watts of power. [44] Through the use of a simple\nhigh-mounted\nantenna,\nthis power output can be\nalmost doubled. [43]\nThe drawback\nin using repeater\nstations\nis\nsimply a matter of mass. Reliable models used in\nscientific fieldwork\nand government\noperations\nare\nabout 60 kg each. [43] Setting up repeater stations\ncan be the first step to creating\nan entire relay\nnetwork\non\nMars.\nThis\napproach\nshould\nbe\nconsidered\nfirst-generation\nand\nonly\nnecessary\nbecause of the reliable backup it offers. The primary\nalternative,\nsatellites, are much more massive and not\neasily repaired. They cover a lot more area, but that\nmay not be necessary on a first manned mission.\nWhile the ground-based\nsystem we have proposed is\nideal for initia 1 mission constraints,\na satellite infra-\n\nm\n\n!\n!\n\nU\nm\n\nI} L.--Ironauts (-lO I\xc2\xa2.t_)\nA R_eal_t (10.20kin)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Base(10-20 k.m)\n\n-""....... _\n......\n\nIB\n\n,:\nr\n\nz\nm\n\nI!\n\nm\n%,.,\n\n_o\n\nFigure 6: Sample Network Scenario\nwith large obstacle\nstructure would extend the range of communications\nand navigation\nfunctions to the level required for the\nsignificant scientific exploration\nproposed for future missions.

In addition, the presence of surface obstacles requires the redirection of ground-based\ncommunication\nand\nnavigation\nsignals with even more repeater stations, in the longrunl\nrepeater stations add considerably\nto the mission payload, the necessary power support (since each station must be individually\npowered), and the groundwork\nrequired to establish the network_ ...............\n=\n,\n\nIii\n\nm\n\nIii\n\nmill\n\nB\n\n[]\ng\n\nl\n\n-\n\n"\n\n=\n\nSecondHEDS-UP\n\n:\n\nB\n|\n\nz\n\nThe current\n\n_4\nr_\n\nINN\n\nterrestrial\n\nGPS satelii{es\n\nweigh\n\n1667 kg each and employ\n\nDelta II rockets\n\nfor launch\n\nsupport\n\ninto\n\ngeosynchronous\nEarth orbit [68].

For the initial mission, with "roaming"\nexpeditions\nprobably\nlimited to within 10 km, this payload mass greatly exceeds the mass associated with the repeater stations and navigational beacons of the ground-based\narchitecture proposed.\nOne solution is a radical downsizing\nof the satellite components\nin order to provide navigation\nand satellite\ncommunications\nfrom GMO orbital altitudes without exceeding\nthe practical payload mass limits. This is the most\ntechnologically\ndemanding\nsystem proposed for Mars communications\nand navigation, requiring the most research\nand development\nfor realization.

The current space shuttle EVA suits used by NASA implement a communications\nsystem which consists of\nfive parts: a headpiece,\nor "Snoopy Cap," a helmet-mounted\nvideo camera, a biomedical\nmonitoring\nsystem, a\ncontrol pad, and an extravehicular\ncommunicator\nthat sits on top of the primary life-support\nsystem (PLSS). [45]\nThe Snoopy Cap is a fabric hood that can fit over the head of the astronaut during an EVA. The hood contains\nan earpiece and microphone as well as a link to an external video camera mounted on the helmet for one-way video\ntransmission\nfrom astronaut to base. The earpiece, microphone,\nand video camera are connected\nthrough the suit\'s\nhard upper torso (HUT) to the extravehicular\nCommunicator\nvia a pass-through.\n[45] The biomedical\nmonitoring\nsystem functions so that both the astronaut and the base may haonitor the astronaut\'s\nphysical status. Electrocardiographic\n(EKG) information\nis transmitted\nin the same manner as audio and visual information:\nthrough the\nextravehicular\ncommunicator\nmounted\natop the suit\'s PLSS.\n[45] Current\ndesigns\nfor the extravehicular\ncommunicator\nused on space shuttle EVA Suits are 30.4 cm long, 10.9 cm high, and 8.8 cm wide, with a mass of 3.9\nkg. [45] The communicator\nutilizes two single-channel\nUHF transmitters\nand three single-channel\nUHF receivers for\nradio communications.\nIn addition, the controls for the communications\nsystem are located on the front of the HUT\nin the suit\'s display and control module.\nHamilton Standard Space Systems International,\nInc., the company responsible\nfor the designs of the current\nspace shuttle EVA suits, recommends\nbase-lining\na communications\nsystem that is similar to the current space\nshuttle EVA suit communications\nsystem, but with the radio communications\ncomponents\nintegrated\ninto the HUT\n\nE\n\nE_\n\nOf the suit.

But to do better long-range exploring, a more curretat communications\nsupport system, including networking,\nlong-range\ncapabilities,\nand navigation\nis needed.

Simple\nnavigation\nand emergency-alert\nsystems can be deployed for backup. There are many available methods on Earth,\nfrom the Cospas-Sarsat\nPersonal Locator Beacon (PLB) [48,49] system to the avalanche beacons [50] which have\nbeen recommended\nby the International\nCommission\nfor Alpine Rescue (ICAR). [51] Because it is impractical\nto\nassume immediate\nsatellite coverage on Mars due to mass and cost restrictions, a light, simple, low-power\nhoming\nbeacon would be ideal. To achieve the best blend of beacon characteristics,\na combination\nof the Cospas-Sarsat\nand\navalanche beacons should be used.\nPLBs have a 406_\ndigitaior\n121.5MHz analog satellite Signal as well as a homing beacon.\nAlthough their\nefficiency would increase throughsatellite\nuse, 121.5MHz homing beacons are viable alone. They have a range of 35km, and, if necessary, can be sent in Morse code to include more information.\n[52] Avalanche beacons are light\n(230 grams), small (130 x 80 x 25 mm), and have a working life of about 250 hours on 3V batteries. They have\nhigh-impact\nstrength and shock resistant casing, can operate between -30\'(2 and 50"C, and can be connected to an\nearphone, allowing for audio ixans_ssionl\nHowever, avalanche beacons only have a range of 80m. [50]\nAn ideal beacon would combine the PLB homing beacon with an avalanche beacon. With this combination,\na 35 km radius Could be covered to locate an astronaut. In an emergency,\na rescue team would need to come within\n45m of the astronaut and then the avalanch q b e_acon could pinpoint his location with an accuracy of 70cm. [53] This\nsimple beacon could be triggered either manually or automatically\n(by shock), and would send a signal out which\ncould be received by both other astronauts and the base station. All EVA suites should have both a transmitter and a\nreceiver to allow the fastest possible astronaut rescue. An accompanying\nrover/cart should also have a receiver like\nthe Cospas-Sarsat\nRepeater Unit to relay the message back to the base.

With fuel cells, the logistics that\nare involved with using a hydrogen-oxygen\nfuel cell, namely the difficult provision and storage of the hydrogen,\nprohibit its use as an on-back portable power supply for this application. Batteries seem like a viable solution, with\nlithium-polymer\nor lithium-ion\nbatteries as practical choices. These would require electrical recharging, and if they\nare used as primary on-back power supplies, it would be difficult to get NASA approval for them because lithium is\nvolatile should it come in contact with water, and_the cel!s would b e in close contact with a water-based\nhuman. It\nwould be easier to get approval for a smaller lithium ion battery to be used as backup. The current silver-zinc (AgZn) battery is practical for use in a micro-gravity\nEMU, but to provide the additional primary power that would be\nneeded on a Mars EMU would significantly\nincrease its mass (at 283 A h/kg).\n\nl\n\nl\n\nR\n\nThe HEDS reference mission mentions batteries as a possible power supply for the EMU.

The electrons become the generated electricity.\nThis anode reaction produces carbon dioxide, which can\nbe collected or vented out of the system. The protons are then conducted through the membrane-electrode\nassembly\n(MEA), made of the anode, Proton Exchange Membrane,\n(PEM) and cathode, to the Cathode side, where they react\nwith the atomized oxygen and incoming electrons to form water. The water can then be recycled or stored for later\nuse. Each cell is separated by a bipolar plate that acts as both the anode for one cell and as the cathode for the\nneighboring\ncell. These plates have channels in their surface which distribute the reactants across the membrane\nassembly.

There are three main ways to accomplish\nthis: (1) increasing cell operating temperature,\n(2) using pure oxygen at the cell cathode, and (3) careful construction\nof the cell\'s membrane\nand electrode assemblies.\nTable\n\n17: Fuel Cell $ )eciflcations\n\nvs. EMU Needs\n\nFuel Cell Specs:*\nOutput Voltage:\nCurrent Density:\n\n0.6 V\n150 rnAlcm z\n\nEMU Needs:\nPower Req\'d:\nVoltage Req\'d:\n\n150 W\n18 V\n\nPower Densi_:\nOverall Efficiency:\n\n90 mW/cm 2\n35 %\n\nRequired Duration:\nGoal Duration:\n\n4 hours\n8 hours\n\n* At 60 \xc2\xb0C, operating\n\non Earth air at 20 psig and a flow rate 3 to 5 times stoichiometric.\n\n80\n\n]increasing\nthe cell operating temperature\nfrom 60_C to 90\xc2\xb0C can increase cell output voltage by almost 50%\nover the data given above.\nHowever,\nthere are three problems\nwith this approach. First, a higher operating\ntemperature increases the rate of reactant crossover in the fuel cell, resulting in a loss of output current and a drop in\n\n69\n\n70\n\nLPI\n\nContribution\n\nNo.\n\n979\n\nm\n\nI\nfuel cell efficiency.\n\n[80] The cold environment\n\non Mars will make\n\nit difficult\n\nto insulate\n\na cell and guarantee\n\nan\n\noperating\ntemperature\nof 90\xc2\xb0C. The most significant\nconcern is that a high operating\ntemperature\nincreases the\nthermal stress on fuel cell systems. This leads to early dehydration\nof each cell\'s PEM, rendering\nthe cells\ninoperative\nand useless. [79] Such failure compromises\ncrew safety and also requires\na large reserve stock of\nreplacement\nfuel cells.\nUsing pure oxygen at the cell cathode to reac t wit h methanol at the anode can increase cell voltage by 15% to\n20%. [84] On an EMU, pure oxygen would be used anyway. This method of increasing cell voltage is probably the\neasiest and presents no major problems. The DMLFFC was originally designed to react liquid methanol\nand pure\ngaseous oxygen directly, but scientists at JPL used a high-flow air supply to provide oxygen for fuel cell testing\nsince oxygen is present in Earth\'s atmosphere\nin significant\nquantities_ Careful preparation\nof the membrane\'\nelectrode\nassemblies\nwith catalyst material can also contribute\nanother\n15% to 20% increase\nin fuel cell\nperformance.\n[84] This is a fairly time-consuming\nprocess and increases fuel cell cost, but it need only be done once,\nbefore the cell is brought into operation for the first time.\nA combination\nof pure oxygen usage and catalyst preparation can thus provide an overall increase in cell output\nvoltage of 30% to 40% to about 0.63 V, which leads to a proportional\ndecrease in the number of cells required for\nthe EMU\'s power stack. In addition, increasing cell output voltage also leads to an increase in cell output power. To\nsatisfy the EMU power requirements,\nfuel cells are rated at 0.6V each at a power density of 150mW/cm\nIn addition to providing on\'back power for the EMU, a fuel cell stack can generate a significant\namount of\nwaste heat. With current DMLFFC efficiency, approximately\ntwo-thirds of the energy potential of the methanol is\nunused.\nHalf of this lost energy is dissipated in the form of electrochemical\nefficiencies\nand heat energy needed to\nmaintain cell Stack temperature.\nThe other half of the unused energy is dissipated\nas waste heat to prevent\nundesirable\nincreases in stack temperature and power fluctuations.\n[78, 86] The waste heat generation of the stack is\nthus roughly equal to its electrical power generation, or 150 W.\nThe fuel cell stack will be insulated against the Mars environment\nto maintain its temperature\nand the waste heat\nmust be actively transferred\nout of the stack to prevent a heat buildup. Because the EMU will operate in a cold\nenvironment,\nthe DMLFFC waste heat can be recycled inside the EMU to provide an auxiliary heat source for the\n\nz\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nI\n\ng\n\nE\ni\n\ni\n\n|\n\nastronaut. A heat exchanger may be used to transfer the waste heat to the liquid cooli_n_g/heating ventilation garment.\nThis heat exchanger can be made of aluminum and will conduct heat to feedwater from the LCVG, thus increasing\nthe water temperature\nand adding heat to the astronaut\'s\nbody. Having an in-suit active heat source will reduce the\nneed to don and doff thermal insulative overgarments\nintended to reduce heat loss. This will give astronauts greater\nmobility in surface activities since these garments are very bulky, reaching up to four inches thick. [23]\nDMLFFC reactions wili consume methanol and oxygen to produce usable electric power. The amount of the\nreactants consumed is dependent on the duration of the EVA and the average power produced on the EVA. These\ntwo factors can be combined and expressed in terms of energy with units of watt-hours. In general, an average EVA\nduration of four hours will require 600-800Whr,\nwith an eight hour EVA requiring 1200-1600Whr.\nIn order to determine the amount of reactants consumed in producing these amounts of power, the baseline of a\n\nz\n\nm\n\ni\nm\nm\ni\n\nm\n\ncurrent DMLFFC developed\nat Giner, Inc is used as reference.\nAt Giner, with the stack operating conditions\nof\n0.45V/cell,\n100 mA/cm 2 and 60_C, a 0.5 M meth_anol solution has been shown to maximize efficiency. Under these\nconditions,\nDMLFFCs\nwill consume methanol at a rate of 1.4x10 2 moles per watt-hour\nand oxygen at a rate of\n2.1 x 10 .2 moles per watt-hour [57]. In addition, the stack inefficiency known as "cross-over"\nwill consume additional\nmethanol and oxygen at rates approximately\n30% of those listed above. Finally, due to imperfect reactant utilization,\nincreased oxygen flow rates oxygen will require quantities on the order of two times those given below.\nTo maintain maximum reactant utilization and efficiency with a 0.5 M methanol\nsolution while meeting the\npower requirements\nof the EMU (including cross-over),\nEVAs will require the amounts\nintroduced to the closed loop anod e supply evenly over the dura_on of the EVA_\nTable 18: Reactant\nEVA Duration\n4 hr\n8 hr\n\nConsumption\n\nAmounts\nMethanol Consumed\n0.40-0.54 L\n0.81-1.08 L\n\nof methanol\n\ni\ni\n\nlisted below\n\n|\n\n02 ,Consumed\n\nNote that while the stack operating conditions may vary between those listed above and those used on Mars, the\ninterdependence\nbetween the reactant consumption\nrates and the operating conditions is stable enough that the rates\ngiven above would not change radically.\nThe goal here is instead to show that only moderate amounts of methanol\nand oxygen are required in producing the required power.\n\nfur\n\ni\n\nm\n\ni\n\n=\n\ngll\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\nIn addition to making sure that the fuel cell is reusable and can meet average power needs, it is necessary to\nmake sure that the fuel cell design does not continuously\ntax the fuel cell at maximum - this creates great stress on\nthe system to be continuously\nproviding peak power. A small, nontoxic battery used in parallel with the fuel cell will\nhelp get the cell heated up to start as well as provide peak power requirements\nso that the fuel cell is not operating at\n\nmax stress.\nA stack of 30 cells with area 9.00 x 5.25 cm 2 is required\nmass and volume was estimated\ngiven densities of DuPont\'s\n\nto achieve the 150W and 18V requirement.\nSystem\nNation for PEM, platinum-ruthenium\nfor the anode\n\ncatalyst and platinum for the cathode catalyst.

The "waste" heat generated by the fuel\ncell can be harnessed to perform the functional task of warming the EMU. The use of methanol, a non-toxic easily\ngenerated mission resource in small amounts as power makes use of Mars resources and reduces the amount of mass\nto be transported from Earth.\nFuture research in designing an electrical power system for an EMU with application on Mars, many of which\nare funded by the drive to utilize DMLFFCs in the automotive\nindustry, would include developing the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nAn efficient means of producing methanol from methane at lower temperatures\non Mars.\n=\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nImproved membranes\n(JPL & USC) in an effort to improve\nreducing cross=over within theDMLFFC.\nEven lighter and cheaper materials for use in the DMLFFC\nPEM, MEA and plates.\nA method for maintaining\nthe correct CH3OH concentration\n\nboth reactant\nby optimizing\nat the anode.\n\nutilization\n\nand efficiency\n\nthe fabrication\n\nprocess\n\nwhile\nof the\n\n71\n\n72 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nm\n\nI\nAn improved\nA complete\nA prototype\n3.4 Meeting\n\nheat exchanger\n\nfor transfer of heat from DMLFFC.\n\nmodel of the DMLFFC and power distribution system.\nfor field testing undersimulated\nMartian conditions.\n\nFunctional\n\nI\n\nRequirements\n\nTable 20: System functional\nEMU System Component\n\nrequirements\nchecklist and mass tally\nProposed Solution\n\nGas Exchange\n\nMeets\n\nHeat Exchanger\nNo additional mass necessary\nReconfigurable\nWireless Network\n\nInternal Communications\nBackup Communications\nPrimary Power System\nBackup Power System\n\nSystem\nSystem\nSystem\n\nbattery\n\nCBE Mass\n4.6 kg\n6.4 kg\n2.9 kg\n7.35 kg\n\n,/\n\nm\n\nI\n\ng\n\nVirtual Retinal Display\nHybrid Beacon\nDirect Methanol Liquid Fee d Fuel Cell\nLithium-ion\n\nFunctional\n\nRequirements\n7,\n\xc2\xa2,\n\xc2\xa2,\n\nCryogenic Oxygen Storage System\nBack Up Oxygen Tanks\nSolid Amine Desorbed System\n\nThermal Regulation\nRadiation Protection\nExternal Communications\n\ntl\n\n\'\n\n\xc2\xa2\xc2\xa2,\n\xc2\xa2,\n,/\n\xc2\xa2,\n\n2 kg\n3 kg\n0.25 kg\n3.75 kg\n\nTOTAL\n\nMASS\n\n[]\n\nO.3 kg\n30.55 kg\n\nl\n\nm\nCombining\nthe system components\nanalyzed above with their current best estimate masses (margin included)\nputs us only 2.55kg over the allocated mass.

However, the time scale for the development\nand testing of most of the above\ntechnologies\nis in step with the desire to send humans to Mars within the next 10-20 years.

INTRODUCTION\nCurrent\n\nthinking\n\non Mars\n\nseems\n\nlimited\n\nin examining\n\nmm\n\nTO THE STUDY\nthe links between\n\nthe depth\n\nof available\n\n=z\n=\nm\n\ntransportation\n\nvehicles with a breadth of future scenarios. Analyses such as NASA\'s Design Reference Mission (DRAM)or the\nMars Direct Mission can only be used as starting points. In trying to send the initial human mission to Mars,\nthese\n\nconcepts\n\nhave not appropriated\n\na long-term\n\nphilosophy.\n\nThese visions\n\ncannot\n\nadequately\n\nm\n\ndeal with the\n\ninherent problems of transportation systems that are to be used repeatedly in the next millenium. These designs\navoid examining the possible synergies between how often a society demands to go to Mars and the\ntransportation\n\nmethods\n\navailable\n\nto implement\n\nm\n\nm\n\nthat demand.\n\nThe inquiry presented here looks into the bimodal shipping arrangement inherent in the Mars transportation\nmarket: from Earth-to-orbit (ETO) and from Earth orbit to Mars. A conceptual design method is created that can\nintegrate all aspects of the space transportation infrastructure for going to Mars. Planning space transportation\nsystems for the future in the conceptual design phase requires a method to evaluate how each envisioned future\n\nm\n\nchanges the final design.\nIn each imagined future it should be possible to see how cargo requirements\nactually\nchange the development\ncycle of the transportation\nsystem itself. Specifically, how does cargo demanded affect\nthe payload capability of the "truck" that will be developed to transport that cargo.\n\nm\n\nII. PROBLEM\n\nm\n\nAPPROACH\n\nA new design approach to address [he deficiency defined above is b_ed on Mars Scenario-Based Visioning\n(SBV). SBV is a philosophy tlaat tries to define the future according to various drivers. In essence, visions of\nthe future\n\nhelp drive\n\none to obtain\n\nspecific\n\nscenarios.\n\nA process\n\nis developed\n\nthat can utilize\n\nI\n\nthese envisioned\n\nscenarios, along with availability projections of future launch vehicles and Mars transfer vehicles (MTVs), to\ndetermine the cost-conscious combination of such vehicles to meet that scenario requirement.\nLarge cargo delivery to another planet such as Mars is a problem of transportation\n\nlogistics.\n\nm\nz\n\nPrevious studies\nm\n\nindicate that more than 40% of the total cost associated\nwith going to Mars stems from th_e Earth-to-orbit\nand\nTMI phases, with the rest of the cost coming from habitation, operations\nand a smail-percentage\nfor Eartff return.\nThis study focuses only on the one-way transportation\nproblem to Mars, specifically\nup to trans-Mars\ninjection\n\nam\n\n(TMI). The payload at TMI must contain its own equipment for orb!t caPtur.i.ng at Mars and for all post-TMI\ntransportation, therefore the costs calculated in this study are only for the transportation segment to TM].\n\nm\n\nThe timeframe examined in this study spans from 2011 to 2031. Since optimum orbital alignment does not\noccur for 2.1 years between Mars and Earth the cargo is sent only in those ten launch opportunity years between\n2011 and 2031 (2011, 2013/4, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028, and 2030/I).\n\ni\nm\n\nWith all of these assumptions in mind a process is designed to simulate and optimize a bimodal transportation\nsystem to Mars (see Figure 1). At the center of the figure is a new simulation tool called M-SAT (Mars Scenario\nAnalysis Tool), specifically designed for this study. M-SAT is a spreadsheet-based simulation that utilizes\n\n[]\n\ninputs of scenario forecasting,\nETO vehicle databases, and MTV databases.\nInternally M-SAT contains modules\nto calculate the following:\nvehicle flight rate combinations,\nvehicle transportation\ncosts, and in-space operations\ncosts. Attached to these modules is a contracted genetic algorithm optimization routine that selects the optimum\n\ncombination\n\ni\n\nof ETO vehicles and MTVs per year to reduce overall life cycle cost (LCC) of the transportation\n\nsystem.\nlug\n\ni\n\nu\n\nm\n\nd\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\nForum\n\nm\n\nI\nI\n\nEnvisioned Scenario\n3\n\n(\n\n4\n\nMTV Database\n\n\'_\n\n._\n\ncost_:_>\n\n_\n\nMinimize\n\nm\n\nMars Scenario Analysis Tool (M-SAT)\n\nETO Database\n\n_\'\n\nr\nE\n\nFigure\nH.1 Scenario\n\nm\n\nThe foundation\n\nm\n\nand Populating\n\nDefinition\n\nthe future of Mars transportation\nsystems, therefore\nthese scenarios and populating the databases is then\n\nand Visioning\n\nof Scen\xc2\xa3rio-Based\n\nVisioning\n\nas applied\n\nin this examination\n\ncan be seen in Figure\n\n2.\n\nThe\n\nhorizontal axis represents !ncreasing social an d political will of going to Mars and the vertical represents reduced\ntransportatiori\ncosts.\nIn a scenario where the social and political will is iowone\ncan imagine a future in which\nonly robotic exploratory\nmissions would be developed.\nIn a future where social and political will for going to\nMars is high, and yet high space transportation\ncosts exist, only a limited one-time manned mission might be\nadvanced, called "Flags and Footprints."\nIn another vision of the future where these particular costs have been\nreduced, missions\nmighf increase tO point near or slightly above those enVisaged\nby NASA in the Design\nReference\nMissi0ri (DRM)\'.\nColonization\nmay be _t likely future ifboth:the\ncollective\nwill to go to Mars\nincreases and transportation\ncosts decrease.\nReduced Transportation\n\nHuman _cientifie\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n=7\n\nVisualized\n\nthe Input Databases\n\nW\n\n|3\n\nOverview\n\nMission scenarios and available\nvehicles are what defines\nthese are the inputs to the M-SAT simulation.\nEnvisioning\nthe first step towards creating a valuable simulation tool.\nH.I.1 Scenario\n\nw\n\nVisioning\n\n1: Process\n\n_\n\nExploration\n(Extended DRM)\n_ W_\n\nCosts\n\nColonization &\nEventual Terraforming\n\n_\nSocial & Political Will To Go To Mars\n\nW\n\nRobotic Exploration\n\nFigure\n\nm\n\nL=__a\n\nm\n\nM\nw\n\nw\n\n_]\n\n"Nags and Footprints"\n\n2: Scenario\'Based\n\nVisionsing\n\nfor Going\n\nto Mars\n\nPayload requirements\nin metric tons for each Mars launch opportunity\n(approximately\nevery 2.1 years) are\nassigned for each scenario (see Figure 3).

Any vehicles\ndeemed important to a Mars transportation\nsystem can be input into the database.\nEach database contains inputs\nthat describe the vehicle type, availability,\nreusability, payload capacity, weight, and cost.\n- -.....\n\nEach of the inputs has a different effect on the scenario envisioned.\nsimulator whether certain vehicles are derivatives\nof one another.\n\nFor instance, vehicle type indicates\nThis is useful in obtaining\nlearning\n\nto the\ncurve\n\neffects from production\nof similar vehicles.\nBoth availability\nand payload\ncapacity\nare input , for_ each\nopportunity\nto simulate possible performance upgrades and operational\nimprovements\nin a vehicle, which can be\nsignificant\nover a twenty-year period. Reusability is important to the MTV database because a reusable vehicle\nwill be able to repeat its mission at the next opportunity with only marginal refurbishment.\nThe ETO and MTV\ndatabases\ncontain a maximum of eight and three vehicles, respectively.\nThe databases\nare populated\nwith both\nexisting designs and conceptual designs. The conceptual designs used for the databases are in-house designs.\nCreating these in-house designs requires the use of very intensive design processes\noptimizing\nfor min!mum\ncost. Detailed designs are necessary because specific values are needed in order to estimate the input parameters\nto the database.\nAn example of this is occurs in vehicle cost estimation,\nwhich involves relationships\nthat are\ndependent\non the particular weight of vehicle components.\nThese next two sections will chronicle the designs\nand design processes\nin the databases\nand introduce information\nthat is useful for deciding\non .the input\nparameters in each database.\nThese designs are not meant to be a result of this study, designing them is merely\npart of the process of generating the inputs.\nII.1.2.1\n\nEarth-to-Orbit\n\nVehicle\n\nDatabase\n\nDefinition\n\nThe task of the ETO transportation\ndesigns is to populate a database of vehicles to be used as inputs to the MSAT simulation.\nIn order to fully explore the possibilities for ETO transportation,\nan array of vehicles spanning\na wide payload spectrum is needed.\nBy compiling this spectrum the question of what is the "best" way of\nlaunching\na Mars transfer vehicle can be answered with more confidence.\nThese ETO designs use existing,\ninterim, and future designs to meet the demands of exploring low cost options for a variety of payloads to low\nEarth orbit or LEO (400 km x 400 km).\n\ni\n\ni\n\nm\n\nm\n\ni\nm\n\n|\n\nThe purpose of the database for the ETO team is two-fold.\nFirst, it is intended to serve as a test for the trial runs\nof the scenario vision; second, it is intended for future users who do not have their own vehicle designs.\nThe\nbeauty of the database lies in the fact that it is easily amendable.\nIf a new design is created, it can be placed in\nthe database\nand accessed as an ETO transportation\noption.\nIntroduced\nbelow are possible launch vehicle\n\n_J\n\nm\n\nSecond\n\ncandidates\n4).\n\ncome from existing,\n\ninterim,\n\nand future vehicles\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nthat can launch more than 10 MT to LEO (see Figure\n\n11o\n1oo\n90\nm\n\n80\n/\nw\n\n70\n\n/\n\n\\\nm\n\n60\nu\n\n\\\n\nm\n\n50\ntl-\n\n40\n30\n\n,\n\n/\n20\n\n\\\n...... \\\n?\n\nm\n\n2" ,i\n\nm\n\n__\n\nm\n\n1o\n_/-/\nn\nD\nm\nm\nm\n\n!t d!I"T"I-i-FTT\'q\n\np\'.\'_ i i\n\nVentureStar\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nw\n\nm\nw\n\n_hrrd_\n\no\nSpace Shuttle\n\nFigure\n\nB\n\n"\'_\n\nExisting\n\n4: Selected\n\nDelta IV-H\n\nHeavy Argus\n\nEarth-to-Orbit\n\nVehicle\n\nSaturn V\n\nOlympus 601801120\n\nComparison\n\nVehicles\n\nThe Proton is a standard Russian heavy-lifter,\nhaving been used to launch all Russian space station components\nfor the last thirty years.

The larger the expansion ratio the\nhigher the specific impulse of the engine, which decreases the amount of propellant used, but increases the\nnozzle weight. The optimal expansion ratio for minimum IMLEO was found to be 180 (specific impulse = 935\ns). After the expansion ratio was determined the remaining engine properties: were calculated. The \xe2\x80\xa2 V of 4,198\nm/s plus the additional 3.5% for losses was then used to determine the mass ratio (MR) of the vehicle. This mass\nratio (MR) was used to determine the amount of propellant needed by the vehicle. The propellant losses assumed\nin the weight breakdown structure consisted of boiloff (1.6% of total propellant, sized for 1 month of losses),\nreserves (1.0% of total propellant), and residuals propellant (0.5% of total propellant).

For human missions the crew is sent out to the orbiting SEP\nvehicle using a crew taxi that consists of a crew capsule with an attached chemical propulsion\nstage.

In-Space\n\nAssembly\n\nof MTV Pieces\n\nL\n\nThe cost of in-space assembly is heavily dependent on the total number of ETO flights. A simple relationship\nexists between in-space operational complexity\nand the number of ETO flights. This relationship is the number\nof assemblies\nis equal to the number of ETO flights minus one.\nIf there are less than five ETO flights\nautonomous docking is used for in-space assembly. Robots are used exclusively if there are more than five ETO\nflights.\nThe in-space operations module has the capability to use several different types of robots. Each robot is mission\nspecific and designed, developed, tested and evaluated before the beginning of each mission. This non-recurring\ncost is dispersed evenly over 5 years prior to the initial launch. Learning curves are added into the simulation\nfor\nthe development of the robots.\nSpace platforms for the robots are also modeled.\nThese space platforms are small "robot space stations" of ten\nmetric tons with lifespans of six years. The robots can keep necessary tools, power, and communication\nsystems\non board these platforms. The number of space platforms needed is determined by the total number of robots to\nbe in orbit during assembly. Each can sustain only twenty robots at any given time.\nH.2.3 Cost Module\nCosts are determined\nseparately\nfor the ETO\ncosts are calculated\nfor each MTV.\nSelected\ndeveloped\n\nexclusively\n\nand MTV transportation\nsegments.\nRecurring\nETO launch vehicles are sunk cost programs\n\nand non-recurring\nwhereas others are\n\nfor these scenarios.\n\nThe non-recurring and recurring costs of each type of MTV are determined\nthrough the use of cost-estimating\nrelationships\nor specific costs.\nThe NTR, SEP, and chemical MTV architectures\neach have varying nonrecurring costs (as seen in Table 4 for the 40, 80 and 160 MT payload class vehicles).\nThe non-recurring\ncost of\nthe NTR is the highest of the three, while SEP has the highest recurring cost. This is due to the fact that the SEP\nis an architecture\nmade up of many small components.\n\nE\n\nm\n\n91\n\n92 LPI Contribution No. 979\n\nm\nTable 4: Non-Recurring\nand Recurring Costs of MTV\nArchitectures\nfor Various Payload Classes (19995M)\n\nArchitecture\n\nType\n\nNTR\nNon-Recurring\nCost\nRecurring Cost\nSEP\nNon-Recurring\nCost\nRecurring Cost\nCHEM\nNon-Recurring\nCost\nRecurring Cost\n\nPayload\n40\'MT\n\nCapability\n80 MT\n\n- Class\n160 MT\n\n$4,291 M\n$829 M\n\n$4,547\n\nM\n\n$!,441\n\nM\n\n$5,059M\n$2,662M\n\n$1,892 M\n$1,368 M\n\n$2,236\n$2,261\n\nM\nM\n\n$2,911M\n$4,175M\n\n$1,231 M\n$273 M\n\n$1,323M\n$281M\n\n!IB\n\n$1,472M\n$293M\n\nThe ETO launch vehicle cost analysis is handled in two ways.\nFor those launch vehicles\nwhose design,\ndevelopment,\ntesting, and evaluation (DDT&E) costs are sunk or already accounted for, such as the VentureStar\nor Ariane 5, only a constant recurring price per flight is charged to the MTV launch customer.\nFor those\nvehicles which are developed just to handle these Mars payload missions, such as a new heavy lift launch vehicle\n(Olympus),\nthe costs for those vehicle developments\nas well as the recurring cost per flight is included in the\ntransportation\ncost (see Table 5).\nTable 5: Non-Recurring\nand Recurring\nArchitectures\nfor Various Payload\n\nArchitecture\n\nType\n\nOlympus\nNon-Recurring\nCost\nRecurring Cost\n\nPayload\n60 MT\n\nCosts of ETO Vehicle\nClasses (19995M)\nCapability\n80 MT\n\nl\n\nIll\n\nm\n\n- Class\n120MT\n\nii1\n$2,464M\n$507M\n\n$2,813M\n$577M\n\n$3,483M\n$713M\n\nm\nm\n\nThe cost module of the M-SAT simulation accepts the DDT&E (non-recurring)\nand TFU (theoretical\nfirst unit)\ncosts of each transportation\nvehicle, MTV or ETO. These costs are taken in conjunction\nwith the flight rates of\neach of the transportation\narchitectures\nto determine the life cycle transportation\ncosts.\nLearning\ncurves are\nincluded for the DDT&E and TFU costs. The DDT&E is applied starting five years before the construction\nof\nthe first unit with the DDT&E amount spread out evenly over those five years.\nA DDT&E learning curve of\n85% and a TFU leaning curve of 90% are included in the analysis.\nThe cost module has built-in logic which\ninstructs the module to build the lowest payload class vehicle first if multiple payload class vehicles are built in\n\nm\n\nI\n\nII1\n\nthe same year. With this logic the learning curve effect is applied to the larger payload class vehicle, which is\nthe vehicle with the larger DDT&E cost. With these learning curve effects the cost module is robust enough to\nhandle\n\nmultiple\n\narchitectures.\nN\n\nH.3 Optimization\n\nProcess\n\nNow that the inputs and modules have been introduced the problem statement is redefined in terms of the newly\ndesignated parameters.\nThis statement is, "For a given scenario and database find the minimum total life cycle\ncost by changing the vehicle flight rates of the MTVs and ETO vehicles." In order to find the minimum cost, an\noptimizer\n\nmust be incorporated\n\nwith the databases.\n\nThe decision of which type of optimizer to use is facilitated by characterizing\nthe design\nvariables in the design space are the vehicle flight rate sets. Because the flight rate sets are\nopportunity\nand for both MTV and ETO vehicles there are twenty independent\nvariables.\nthe problem is not a continuous function because it is undefined\nwhen vehicle flight rat\nintegers.\nTotal LCC is the objective function.\nThe problem is also multi-modal,\ncontaining\n\n_\nspace.\nIndependent\ndetermined\nfor each\nThe design space of\nset guesses are not\nmore than one local\n\nm\n\nI\n\nwI\n\nI\n\nIll\n\n" _\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\nForum\n\nL_\n\nw\n\nm\ni\nlib\n\nminimum for the objective function.\nFinally, the size of the space is defined as possible values of each of the\ntwenty independent\nvariables multiplied by each other. Therefore if there is an average of 8 MTV sets and 6,000\nETO sets for a given scenario the total number of possible combinations\nis approximately\n1 x 105\xc2\xb0. The first two\ncharacteristics\nof the problem lead one to choose a stochastic optimizer.\nThe large number of possible flight rate\ncombinations\nmakes a random grid search unreasonable\nso a \'smart\' stochastic search must be done.\nThe\nstochastic optimizer chosen for this problem is a spreadsheet\nbased contracted genetic algorithm (GA) program.\nGAs incorporate\nthe idea of survival\nof the fittest and use binary digits to represent the \'genes\'\nof the\nindependent\nvariables.\nThere are of course problems\nwith GA, the main problem being that GAs do not\nnecessarily generate the optimal solution, but usually approach a near optimal solution.\nA schematic\nof the genetic algorithm\nintegrated\nwith the entire process is shown in Figure 17. Once the\ndatabase, scenario, and flight rate sets have been created the progam\nis initiated.\nThe inputs to the GA are the\nupper and lower bounds of each design variable and the value of the objective function, namely total LCC. The\noptimization\nbegins by first initializing a random \'generation\' of independent\nvariables.\nA generation consists of\na specific number (50-100) number of candidate designs.\nThis generation\nis evaluated and the cost is returned\ninto the optimizer and three \'biological\'\nprocesses performed.\nThe first is replication of good designs.\nNext is\ncrossover,\nwhere \'parents\'\nare combined\nto diversify the next \'generation\'.\nLastly, random mutation occurs,\nwhich adds diversity to the design pool.. These new \'fitter\' variables are placed back into the simulation\nand\nthen the process continues.\nA fourth process called restart is sometimes implemented\nif the generation\nbecome_\ninbred.\nThe optimization\nis stopped when the desired number of iterations is complete, however there is no\nmathematical\nproof that the optimized answer has been obtained.\n\nw\n\nI[GA\n\nFinds\n\n\'fitter\'\n\nOptimizer\n\nL_\n\n---_\n\ncombination\n\nof vehicles\n\nI\n\n!\n\nTotal life cycle\n\nM-SAT\n\ncost\n\n]]\n\nm\n\nFigure\nm\nI\n!\n\nAlgorithm\n\nOptimizing\n\nfor Minimum\n\nCost\n\nHI. RESULTS\nIII.1 Scenario\n\nm\nm\n\n17: Genetic\n\nForecasts\n\nEach of the three mission scenarios is designed to test and evaluate different aspects of the simulation.\n"Flags\nand Footprints",\nwhich represents\na simple exploratory\nmission to Mars was used as a test case of the\nsimulation\'s\naccuracy.\nThis simple scenario was chosen because the optimal answer could be ascertained\nwithout running the simulation.\nFor the "Flags and Footprints"\nmission, all eight launch vehicles slots were\nused.\nThey were Heavy Argus, the Proton M, EELV, Ariane 5, the Venture Star, and three classes of the\nOlympus HLLV.\nThe inclusion of all the vehicles gave the simulator the full range of launch vehicle choices\nneeded to determine\nif it was functioning\ncorrectly.\nThis scenario, as well as the others, were each run using\nthree MTV propulsion types. These sets were all SEP, all NTR and all chemical transfer vehicles.\nThe second scenario analyzed was a DRM based exploratory\nmission.\nFor this mission, the choice being tested\nwas whether to use HLLVs to place the MTVs in orbit. Ideally, every launch vehicle choice would have been\nincluded in this scenario.\nHowever, because of thei-arge-arn:bunfsOf\ntonnage that needed to be placed in orbit,\nthe number of ETO sets generated using all available launch vehicles was too large to allow efficient analysis of\nthe problem.\nFor this reason, the Ariane 5 and the Proton M were not included in the ETO sets. However, the\nflight rates of the remaining\nnon-HLLVs\nin the database were increased to allow the simulation\nthe choice of\nbeing able to launch the entire payload without using a HLL-VI\nThe third scenario, colonization,\nwas used to determine the characteristics\nof the simulation\'s\nHLLV selection.\nFor this scenario, all three Olympus class vehicles, along with the VentureStar,\nwere included in the ETO sets.\nThe VentureStar\'s\nflight rates were limited to two per year. These two flight rates were to allow for the insertion\nof small amounts of payload left over after the Heavy Lift launches.\nThe main goal of this concept was to\n\n93\n\n94\n\nLPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\ndetermine\nvarious\n\nwhich\nclasses\n\nclasses\n\nof Heavy\n\nof HLLVs\n\nwould\n\nbe built first and how\n\nthe payload\n\nwould\n\nbe divided\n\nbetween\n\nthe\n\ng\n\nLifts.\n\n111.2 Results\nEach of the results are representative\nof the simulators ability to evaluate different scenarios\non the assumptions\nmade foreach\nsimulati00_--The tot_i_Durnber of GA iterations\nfor each\nthree restarts.\nThis dependence\non the initial assumptions\nof the launch vehicles and MTVs\napplicable\nonly to the specific cases discussed here.\nThe main result of this simulation\nprocess itself.

Trends were also noticeable for the specific MTV classes chosen.\nFor the NTR\nand SEP MTVs, the predominate\nchoice was the 80MT class, the chemical MTV predominantly\nchose the\n160MT class. This consistency\nof choosing the same payload class of MTV for each specific vehicle type was\nexpected because of cost benefits associated with repeatedly producing the same class of vehicle.\n12- "__\n\nI\n\nm\n\nl\n\nU\n\nI\nW\n\nFlight Rate per 1____\n\nYear\n\nlallllllllltIl\n\n5\n4-\n\n!\nm\n\nN\n\n32.\nI\n0-\n\n120\n\nII\n\n13/4\n\n16\n\n18 \' 20\n\nMars La_unch Opportunity\n\nFigure\n\n18: HLLV\n\nETO\n\nTraffic\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\ni-28\n\nMT\n\nm\n\n30\n--L-_6OMTS0MT\n\nYear\n\nRate for Colonization\n\nw\n\nScenario\n\nof Chemical\n\nMTV\n\nThe final scenario analyzed was colonization (see Figure 18), taking two hours to ruin through the process.

The answer given by M-SAT was\na cost of $19.2B. These same trades were also performed on the colonization\nmission. For the NTR MTV a cost\nreduction of 30% yields a new total mission price of $58B.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis study developed\nthe M-SAT simulation that can take launch vehicles, MTVs, and payload demand for a\ntwenty-year\nperiod to give the user the optimum manifest of launch vehicles and MTVs for the most costconscious\nsolution.\nInteresting\npatterns can be seen as far as the development\nof MTVs or heavy lift launch\nvehicles for particular scenarios.\nThe simulation is an amalgamation\nof various modules: ETO launch vehicle\'s,\nMTVs, in-space ops model, a cost module, and an optimizer.\nThe power of the simulation lies in the directions it\nindicates for future transportation\narchitecture\ndevelopments.\nOne can add substitute vehicles to the database or\nexamine already existing fleets.\nThe simulation\nis a new tool that can be used to examine the dual phase\ntransportation\nproblem, from E\'arth-to-orbit and then from Earth orbit to Mars\nV. FUTURE\n\n.a_\\\n\n5\n\nSTUDIES\n\nMost of the elements of future work involve improving the M-SAT simulation,\nwhich can be expanded\nin both\ncapability\nand the types of architectures\nexamined.\nIncreasing\nthe speed and ease of use will expand the\ncapabilities\nof the simulation.\nThe most readily available means of increasing the speed is to reevaluate\nthe logic\nplanning within the code.\nImproving\nthe vehicle set generation\nmodule may also increase\nspeed. Another\n\n95\n\n96 LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nspecific example of possible expansion is in the operations\nmodule.\nOur thinking is to develop a more robust\nsystem that can handle different types of assemblies\nsuch as combinations\nof astronauts and the existing robotic\nassembly.\nAnother concept under study is to create a web-based\ninterface where the user can input the type of\nscenario they would like to explore and then one hour later results would be e-mailed for review.\n\nm\n\nm\n\nVI. OUTREACH\nOutreach was accomplished\nby trying to bring this problem to the attention of the entire School of Aerospace\nEngineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.\nIncentives\nwere given for introductory\naerospace students in the\nSchool to attend the final presentation.\nMany of the introductory\nstudents did attend and were rewarded with an\ninteresting\nglimpse into what may await them in their future deign careers.\nIn addition, a web presence\nwas\ndeveloped\nthat not only describes the work performed\nin this study and eventually allows one to obtain the MSAT simulation.\nAn overarching\nphilosophy\nin this study was to allow users to examine their own scenarios\nwithin the confines of the simulation.\nBy allowing\nthe general community\nto obtain the simulation,\nthe\ncommunal\nresult\nwill\nallow\nboth\ngreater\naccess\nand\nimprovement\nin\nthe\nsimulation\n(see\n\nD\nmw\n\nW\n\nm\nm\n\nhttp://atlas.cad.gatech.edu/-ksorensen/msbv.html).\nVH.

The\nMADEX then is lowered five meters and the data collection stage repeats.\nBecause of the limited knowledge regarding Mars\' cliff walls, it is difficult to imagine how rugged\nthey may be. It is therefore necessary for the unit to have the ability to maneuver itself around obstacles in\nits path. Sonars placed on the front and back of the MADEX will constantly take readings of the obstacles\nin its path.\nThus, a basic map of the cliff wall can be created.\nUsing this map, the computer system\nsituated within the base decides the path to take in order to avoid such obstacles.\nThe CCUs are used to\nmaneuver MADEX around them.\nWith the CCUs 60m from each other MADEX may descend approximately\n250m. As mentioned,\nthe gravitational\nforce is used to descend the cliff wall. The CCUs use friction to brake the descent of\nMADEX.\nThe unit will make a total of 50 stops along the cliff wall (approximately\nevery 5m) to collect\nsamples\n\nand data.\nWe have located a cliff wall nearby the landing site proposed by NASA. NASA has proposed to\nland near the region between East and West Candor (Figure 1.2). The cliff wall on the\' northern end of East\nCandor is a preferred setting for the MADEX.\nThis cliff works toward the mission\'s advantage because it\nis near NASA\'s\nlanding site and it appears to contain multiple, detailed layers.\nMADEX\nwill be stationed\nand secured near this cliff wall by the human crew.\nDue to its\nrelatively small size, the entire _unit c6uld be transported\nto the desired _iocafion from the habitai by a rover.\nThe base will be set up 50m fromthe edge of the cliff with the CCUs extended 75m in each direction from\nthe base along the cliff wall. C6mmunications\ntables are attached between the CCUs and the base, and\nbetween the MADEX andthe_ b__e_:__C.ables from the CCUs are then c0nnected to the MADEX.\n\nN\n\nm\n\nN\n\nI\n\nm\nm\nm\n\nm\nm\n\nm\n\nFigure\n\n!\nD\nm\n\nz\n\n1.2\n\nProposed\n\nLanding\n\nSites\n\nA test run will be made before the astronauts\nleave the system.\nMADEX\nwill descend\napproximately\n20m, take data, and then-return ]lie data and samples.\nIf there are problems, they will be\nassessed and fixed.\nWhen the system is functioning\nproperly, it will be programmed\nto run and the\nastronauts\nWill leave.

While\nthere, the system will be checked and inspected io discover any problems, core samples that were returned\nto the base will be taken to the habitat.\nThis sequence will be repeated until the full 250 meter depth has\n\nForum\n\n99\n\n100\n\nLP1 Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nI\n\nbeen achieved.\nAt this point, the MADEX will be returned to the top of the cliff by the CCUs operating on\nreturn mode. The unit will be lifted to the top of the cliff. The small motor on the MADEX will then move\nit the final 50m to the base.\n\n2.\n\nMADEX\n\nDesign\n\nZ\nU\n\n2.1\n\nMADEX Unit\nMADEX has been designed to use minimal power to descend the cliff wall and collect data. It allows\nfor gravity to lower the unit. In the event that the unit reaches a ledge on the wall, there is one small motor\nattached to its tread system so that the unit may continue its descent.\nThis motor is used to move MADEX\natop the cliff wall when it moves the 50m distance between the base and the cliff wall.\n2.1.1\n\nInterior Layout\nVertically through the center of the MADEX unit will be the drilling cylinder.\nThis cylinder will\nconsist of two main partsi a storage ring and the drilling ring. The storage ring will be the lower 18 cm of\nthe cylinder.\nIt will contain eighteen cylindrical holes placed uniformly\naround the outer edge of the\ncylinder.\nEach hole will have a 3 cm diameter.\nThe upper cylinder will have two holes that match up with\nthe outermost holes on the lower cylinder. Through these holes penetrate the two core sampling drills\xe2\x80\xa2 The\nupper cylinder is immobile relative to the MADEX, unlike the lower cylinder which can be rotated about\nits center axis.\n_\n:\nSituated to the front of the drill cylinder will be the M6ssbauer Spectrometer and the Miniature\nThermal Emission Spectrometer.\nBecause the outermost holes on the cylinder are the only holes that\ninteract outside the MADEX, a digital camera will be situated between the cylinder and the cliff wall.\nAttached to the front wheels on the treads is a small motor which controls the unit\'s motion when atop the\ncliff. One small sonar will be placed at the front, and one at the back of the unit. A small computer which\ntranslates commands sent by the base and data to be sent to the base will be placed near the back of the\nunit. At each of the four corners of the unit will be a small, low output motor that drives its respective\n\nJ\n\ni\n\nm\n\nl\n\nl\ni\n\nI\n\nl\n\nu\n\nIlr\n\nsupport leg.\n2.1.2\n\nExterior Layout\nThe dimensions\nof the MADEX will be 120 cm x 120 cm x 100 cm. Much of the volume within\nthese dimensions\nis empty space, however. For instance, the top of the unit will be cut away to save overall\nvolume of the unii_- ........................\nOn each side of the unit will be a tread system which primarily rolls freely _t=h the motion of the\nunit, but drives the unit when atop the cliff. Each tread will extend beyond the front and back of the unit by\napproximately\n35 cm. The width of each tread will be 40 cm, approximately\n1/3of the total width of the\nMADEX.\nFor added support when the unit is stopped for data collection and drilling, the MADEX will be\nequipped with four legs (one on each corner of the uniii. To the front and back, the sonar lenses will be\nvisible through a grate-like shield. The back of the MADEX will be the same as the front except that it will\nhave two eyeholes for connections to each CCU and one port for the communication/power\ncable. Viewing\nthe top of the unit, one would see the drill cylinder centered,\nNo holes are visible from the top, though two\nholes (those through which the drills penetrate) are visible from the underside of the unit.\n\nw\n\ng\n\nl\n\ng\n\ni\n\nUl\n\n2.1.3\n\nTread system\nThe tread system planned for MADEX Unit is somewhat unique (Figure 2.1.3.1).\nIt is different than\ntread patterns on common tanks where each wheel is on its own frame. MADEX will use only three frames\nfor the wheels. This results in fewer moving parts required.\nThe system will allow for a relatively smooth\nride.\nAs the treads touch a protrusion, the middle wheel pushes against the cliff and the front wheel will rise.\nAs the protrusion reaches the middle wheel, it is raised and the outer wheels are lowered.\nThe front wheel\nis thus in contact with the wall again sooner than it would without this design. __A the unit passes over the\ns\nprotrusion,\nthe treads slowly return to their "relaxed" state. This smoother ride will help-ensure-ifi_it-the\ncore samples remain intact and that the electronic equipment on board the MADEX is kept undamaged.\n\nIll\n\nllW\n\nm\ni\ni\n\nw\nm\nm\nI\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\n=\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConnected to MADEX\n\nFigure 2.1.3.1\n\nMADEX\n\nTread Design\n\nN\nw\n\n2.2\n\nBase\nThe base will be situated\nstorage space for the mission.\n\nm\n!\n\nB\n\nat the top of the cliff 50 meters from the edge.\nIt stores the power, samples, and data collected.\n\nIt serves\n\nas the brain and the\n\n2.2. l\nComputer\nThe computer\nthat the base will be equipped with will run the entire mission.\nStored within the\ncomputer are spectrometry\ndata, photographs,\ndetailed records of progress, and maps of the cliff.\nThe\ncomputer must tell the CCUs when and how rapidly to release slack or to pull the MADEX back up to the\ntop of the cliff. How quickly to release slack depends upon what obstacles lie ahead in its path.\nThe\ncomputer thus must calculate what the best route to avoid such obstacles would be. Once the descent of the\nunit is halted, the computer must tell the MADEX to take data: first spectroscopy\ndata, then photographs,\nthen core samples.\n\n[]\n2.2.2\n\nBattery Storage\nThe batteries which store the energy necessary to run the MADEX and all of its components\nwill be\nstored within the base. In order tO minimize the weight of the unit itself, thus minimizing\nthe work\nrequired\nto raise it to the top of the Cliff, all power necessary\nto run the MADEX\nunit itself will be\ntransferred\nfrom the batteries to the unit through the communication/power\ncable.\n\n2.2.3\n\nSample Storage\nAfter samples are taken from the MADEX to the base, the samples will be removed from the cylinder,\npackaged safely, labeled, and stored within the base. The system ejects the sample from the cylinder into a\nsmall bag made of Mylar. The labels are then labeled with the depth from which the samples were taken\nand the date of sampling. The sample is then stored in the base until it is retrieved by astronauts.\n2.2.4\n\nMechaniCal\n\nArm\n\nWhen the MADEX reaches the top of the ciiff after loading the cylinder completely\n(eighteen\ntotal\nsamples), the unit moves to the base to unload the samples (Figure 2.2.1). The base is shaped to funnel the\nMADEX into the correct location for unloading.\nOnce in this position, a mechanical\narm attached to the\nbase grabs the cylinder and pulls it out of the MADEX.\nContained\nwithin this cylinder are the drills, drill\nmotors, and the samples.\nOnce the cylinder has been removed from the unit, a new cylinder, containing\ndrills and motors is placed into the unit so that more samples can be taken immediately.\nThe MADEX then\nmoves back down the cliff to continue its research. While more samples are being taken, the base removes\nthe samples\n\nfrom the used cylinder.\n\nForum\n\nI01\n\n102\n\nLPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\n..,\n\nl\n\nW\n\nIB\n\nm\n\nl\n\nm\n\nm\n\nI\n\nm\n\nW\nFigure\n\n2.3\n\nCable\n\nControl\n\nAtop\n1)\n\nwall\n\nspool,\n\napproximately\n\n2)\n\nand separated\n\nfriction\n\n350\nThe\n\nascent\n\nthe brake\n\n2.4\n\nThe\n\nwill\n\nthis\n\nsonar\n\nreadings\nslack,\n\n3.\n\nwhen\n\nreturn\n\nbe\n\nwill\n\nThe\n\nthe\n\nbe situated.\n\ncable\nstage\n\nentirely\n\nby\n\nas the winch\n\npulls\n\nEach\n\nspool\n\ndescent\n\ncontrolled\n\nimages,\n\nbank in the base\n\nthat\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nthe unit\n\nmust\nthe\n\nunit\nbe\n\nwill\n\nfriction\n\nhave\n\nlarge\n\nMADEX,\nbrake.\n\nto the top\n\nfrom\n\nand MADEX\nthe batteries\n\nas to when\n\nto drill,\n\nspectroscopy\n\nthrough\n\ndata\n\nthis cable\n\nthree\n\nenough\nthe\n\nwinch\n\nLikewise,\n\nparts:\n\nto\n\nhold\n\nwill\nduring\n\nJ\n\nthe\n\nto return\n\nit must\n\nin the base\n\nwill\n\npictures,\n\ntaken\n\nby\n\nBecause\n\nsend\n\na single\n\nthe\n\ncane.\n\nbe delivered\n\nand collect\nMADEX\n\nto the\n\nCCUs\n\nspool\n\nwill\n\nof\n\nto MADEX\n\nspectroscopy\nbe\n\nthe map of the cliff\n\nsignals\n\nThe\n\nmade\n\nas to when\n\nof failure,\n\nto\n\nU\n\nthe\n\nby sonar\nto release\n\nI1\xc2\xa2\n\nit to the top of the cliff.\n\n,\nour\n\nstay\n\nof the Martian\nfrom\n\nlow\n\n!\n\ndata.\n\nsent\n\nthe\n\nsurface\n\non Mars\nplanet\n\nwe\n\ndrili\n\nto Earth\n\nto 250m\n\nbelow\n\ncore\n\nsamples.\n\nfor further\nthe\n\nWith\n\nanalysis.\n\nsurface\n\nof\n\nThe\nMars.\n\nthese\n\nsamples,\n\nsamples\nThis\n\nwill\n\nthat\n\nit will\n\nbe\n\nmass,\n\nminimum\n\npower\n\nconsumption,\n\nbut high\n\nquality\n\nl\n\nI\n\nthe MADEX\n\nallow\n\nsufficient\n\nknowledge\nof the planet\'s\nhistory\nand composition\nfor future studies\nto be designed\nspecifically\nfor certain\nareas of research.\nThis task is not easy,\nand our goal was to design\na system\nthat would\nallow for low\nprobability\n\n!\n\nbe\n\nof the cliff.\n\nis through\n\ntake\n\nas well.\n\nin the base,\n\nand when\n\nduring\n\npieces\n\nthe base\n\nPower\n\nand\n\nthe computer\n\nthe unit,\n\nrange\n\nbetween\n\ninstructions\n\n=\n\nwill\n\nwill\n\nCCUs\n\nwinch.\n\nDuring\n\nin the base.\n\ndigital\n\nwithin\n\nto stop\n\nto return\n\n3)\n\nl\n\nwith\n\nDrills\n\npossible\n\ncable.\n\nand data\n\nalong\n\nmemory\nis held\n\nand\n\nbe inoperative\n\nbe stored\n\ncable,\n\nIt is essential\n\nwill\n\nwill\n\nof power\n\nreadings,\n\ncomputer\n\nBase\n\nDevices\n\ntransfer\n\ncable\n\nthrough\n\nof\n\nof descent\n\nCommunication\nThe\n\nextra\n\nrate\n\nby 60 m, two\n\nbrake,\n\nmeters\n\ninoperative.\nstage,\n\nMADEX\n\nUnits\n\nthe cliff\n\ncable\n\n2.2.1\n\nI\n\nsamples.\nI\n\nleg\n\nSecond\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nV\n\nV\n\nm\n\nB\n\nm\nw\n\nL\nD\nm\n\nl\n\nq_\nFigure 3.

The drill bits we will use with this drill are diamond\nbit, and have an inner diameter of about 2.5 cm. The samples will be 15 cm in length.\nThe drill may be\nattached\nto a computer system that wilI "tell" the drill motor how fast to drill depending\non what the\nspectrometer\nreadings are. The motor may drill into the surface from 0.0825 to 0.49 cm/min.\nThis results\nin the samples taking from 30 to 180 minutes to drill.\nAt each level that drilling will take place, two samples will be taken.\nThis will be done using two\nseparate drills situated opposite each other within the drill cylinder.\nTwo samples will be taken in case one\nbecomes damaged.\nThis will also allow two separate samples to be analyzed more carefully once returned\nto Earth.\n\nv\n\n3.2\n\nI\nm\nE\n\nm\nm\n\nSample Return\nAs the drills pull the sample into the cylinder, the sample will remain within its respective\nhole as the\ndrill bit pulls out into the upper portion of the cylinder.\nWith the top portion of the cylinder immobile,\nthe\nlower portion turns 20 degrees, thus positioning the next two holes beneath the drills.\nThis cycle repeats\nitself until 18 samples have been taken.

Using the highest quality laser spectrometer\ntechnology,\nthis spectrometer\nseemed to be\nthe best in its field. However, due to its physical and power requirements,\nwe found that it was impractical\nfor the MADEX.\nTGA analysis of samples taken by the MADEX is desirable.\nIt may be practical for the\nTGA to be at the habitat or on Earth rather than at the cliff, itself.\nTwo other spectrometers\n_that we found to be more practical for MADEX were the Mini-TES and the\nM6ssbauer Spectrometer.\nBoth are practical due to size and mass.

HART will allow the crew to perform the many necessary hours\nof exercise to maintain muscular strength.\nIn addition, HART will provide power to operate MADEX and\nits subsystems.\nHART will also satisfy the goal of using available resources.\nWithout a system similar to\nHART, the valuable energy expended during!he crew\'s exercises would be wasted.\nThe need for exercise in a low-g environment\nis strongly supported by human experience\naboard the\nMIR Space Station.\nThe cosmonauts,\nwho did not do their exercises regularly,\nrequired stretchers upon\nreturn to Earth, whereas the American\nAstronaut Shannon Lucid walked away by her own power.\nShe\nfollowed her exercise routine daily. This physical activity, likewise, is needed to help astronauts keep their\nstrength on their journey to Mars so they are productive upon arrival.\nThe micro-g during space travel is\nreplaced by a 3.8-g environment\non Mars. Human exercise is a key part of the daily life on Mars. HART\nsimply uses the energy for a meaningful and desired purpose.\n5.2.1\n\nHealth Benefits\nHART offers both mental and physical health benefits to the crew.\nThe system will train both the\nupper and lower body, by means of pedals and a pair of reciprocating\n............\nhandlebars_: in the form of an exercise\nbicycle. An alternator and flywheel assembly will provide resistance for the astronauts.\nThe mental health of the astronaut will also benefit from HART.\nThe astronauts will tend to feel that\nthey are more in control of the fate of the mission.\nWithout\nthis motivation,\nthey may become\noverwhelmed\nby work and ignore their physical needs. The trainer will force them to use the equipment\nin\norder to power one of the critical pieces of scientific equipment.\nExercise has also been proven to relieve\nstress.

If not so lucky, we will know how deep to look for possible\nfossils. We will know much more about Mars than we know today.\n\nI\n\nh\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nMADEX is a design which we believe has great potential.\nWhile in its conceptual\nstage there are still\na number of issues to be explored and resolved.\nPrimarily stability while on the cliff face with regard to\noverturning\ndue to wind and the lack of normal force desired to overcome the drill force reactions.\nWe\nbelieve that the former has been sufficiently addressed by the use of outriggers previously\nmentioned.\nThe\nlatter case could be resolved by the use of pitons fired into the rock wall and then anchored to for drilling,\nor perhaps an auger system that screws itself into softer mediums.\nIn either case once the drilling at the\nparticular\nlevel is completed the anchor is releas_ed or unscrewed\nand the MADEX\nis moved to the new\nlocation.\n-Additional areas of further research are listed in Figure A. Any and all of our proposals\nwill be fully\ntested and modified when NASA adopts the design.\n\nm\n\nm\n\nU\n\nm\n\n-Tabie T.i_ADEX\nPart; quantity\nDrill; 2\nDrill Bit;2\nDrill Cylinder;\nM6ssbauer;\n1\nMini-TES;\n1\n\n1\n\nMass (per) (kg)\n2.2\nTBD\nTBD\n0.4\n1.9\n\nComputer; 1\nSonar; 2\nTread Motor; 2\n\nTBD\n\nLeg Motor; 4\nSum of Known Parts\n\nTBD\n6.7\n\nTBD\n\nSpecifications-\n\nPower Required\n20\nN/A\nNegotiable\n0.6\n4.4\nTBD\nNegotiable\nTBD\nTBD\n45\n\n(per) (W)\n\nVolume (cm \')\nTBD\nN/A\n-24,000\n147.6\n11,520\nTBD\nTBD\nTBD\nTBD\n35,667.6\n\nW\n\nm\n\ni\n\nW\n\nJ\n\nu\n22\n\nII\n\nl\n\ni\nI\n\n_\n\n[\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\n.-\n\nFuture\n\nStudies\n\n1.\n\nExploration\nof DifferenLLocations\nBy exploring more locations (Figure A) with the MADEX, we will create a more general\nMars.\nWe will then know approximately\nwhere to find different layers at various positions\nMartian planet.\n\nSite\n\nFigure A Landing Sites For Future MADEX Missions\nLocation\nLandform\nReason for Interest\n\nBoreale\n\nProblems\n\nWith\n\nfor\nthe\n\nSite\n\n85 N, ll0W\n\nCanyon in polar\nregions; between the\nresidual ice cap and\nlayered Martian\nterrain\n\nConducting\nclimatic studies;\nfurther analysis of\nice caps\n\nHigh latitude may\ncause difficulty in\nutilizing human\ninteraction\n\n10S, 45W\n\nCanyon in Valles\nMarineris\n\nStudy debris from\nlarge landslide and\nmore analysis of\ncliff layers\n\nN/A\n\n6S, 75W\n\nCanyon in VaIles\nMarineris\n\nFurther analysis of\nlayering on Mars\n\nDifficult terrain; the\nproposed site is 50\nkm from canyon\nwall\n\ni1\'\n\nChasma\n\ntimeline\naround\n\nE\n\nw\n\nGanges\n\nChasma\n\nW\n\nWest Candor\nregion (primary\nsite selected for\nSIMM manned\n\n_m\nW\n\nmission)\nm\nm\n\ni\n\nm\nm\nm\nm\n\nW\n\n2.\n\nB\n\n.......\n\nStudies exploring\nwhat materials best suit the MADEX\nunit are necessary.\nCost, weight,\nand\ncoefficient\nof expansion are all important factors that must be considered.\nThe MADEX\nframe, treads,\nlubricants, and cables.\n3.\n\nW\n\nMaterials\n\nTesting\n\nOnce the first MADEX unit is created, tests must be run to ensure the reliability of the unit.

Wind energy extraction is proven terrestrial technology which can offset\nthe duststorm (and night-time) reductions. A multi-phase project is underway to assess the\nfeasibility and drive the develo_)ment of wind energy extraction systems for Mars. This project\nhas specifically addressed the design of a Darrieus-style Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT).\nThe project assumed that wind energy extraction would be a secondary production system to the\nphotovoltaic array. Energy production of 300 kW-hr per Martian day is required for this\napplication. The wind turbine is designed by iteratively stepping through the following tasks:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nChoose a blade shape;\nCalculate the aerodynamic loads (primarily to estimate performance);\nDesign the guy cables;\nDesign the blades;\nDesign the tower; and\nChoose support equipment.\n\nN\nn_\nu\n\nW\n\nThe resulting system was estimated at 944 kg. Based on the feasibility assessment mentioned\nabove, a wind speed of 28 m/s or higher must be seen for at least an hour each day. This wind\nspeed is in the realm of possibility as the expected slope winds on Mars will likely be this high or\nhigher. In order to meet this feasibility, the following design trends were seen: low pre-tension\nguy wires; ultraiight blades; and thin lightweight towers. This work also found that if 25 to 35 m/s\nwinds are available for at least one hour during a Martian day (during a dust storm), then wind\nenergy extraction can be expected to be at least as mass-efficient as solar arrays (during a dust\nstorm). Significant issues such as structural dynamics, thermal expansion/contraction,\nfatigue,\nblade struts, deployability, and maintainability were not considered at this time.\n\nForum\n\n131\n\n132\n\nLPI\n\nContribution\n\nNo.\n\n979\n\nm\n\nI\n\nIntroduction\nThe objective of the project was to produce the conceptual design of a power generating system\nfor Mars, which combines solar and wind energy. The design of the wind power generating\nsystem was of primary concern. The wind and solar power generating systems are excellent\nmethods for the utilization of the available natural resources on Mars. However, these energy\nsources are highly variable. The production of energy through solar arrays is dependent on the\navailability of sunlight. Similarly, the production of energy through wind turbines is dependent on\nfavorable wind conditions.\nWith an atmospheric density 1/75 of the Earth, Mars would at first\nappear to be an unlikely candidate for wind energy. However, the extraction potential of power\nfrom the wind is a function of velocity cubed and only proportional to density. Therefore, high\nwinds can make-up for low density. Fortunately, some models suggest that Mars is subjected to\nregular high velocity winds in some locations. Additionally, these winds are expected to operate\nat night and during dust storms (times when solar energy is ineffective). A study of the wind\nenergy option has been initiated and is currently underway with input from a variety of\norganizations including the University of Houston, NASA-JSC, Sandia National Laboratories, the\nTexas Space Grant Consortium, and ETM, Inc. (James, et. al., 1999). The overall project\nincludes several phases:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nan initial assessment of the solar and w!nd resources,\nan assessment of the energy needs for various applicationsl\n"\na conceptual design of a traditional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT),\na conceptual design of a traditional Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT),\ndevelopment of novel construction and wind turbine design concepts,\na feasibility assessment of power generation using a solar/wind hybrid system, and\nthe specific development of Martian as well as terrestrial systems.\n\nm\n\nI\n\nm\n\nM\n\nm\n\nI\nm\nm\n\nThe immediate objective of this work is to provide mission planners with sufficient information to\nconsider the inclusion of wind energy in Mars mission planning and to target precursor mission\nobjectives. The design work presented in this report primarily addresses phase four of the above\nlist. However, aspects of the other topics listed above will be discussed as they relate to primary\nobjectives of this work. The final design will be used to drive feasibility studies of the solar/wind\nproduction concept as well as to drive the development of novel construction/design concepts\nthat will further enhance the feasibility of in-situ Martian power-production systems.\n\nl\n\nW\n\n|\nI\n\nSupporting\n\nInformation\n\nInitial Assessment of Solar and Wind Resources\n\nm\n\nJ\n\nMartian Solar Energy Resources\nJ\nSolar power will make an essential contribution to the success of Martian missions\' Solar]_Ower\nis abundant, cheap, and does not involve safety concerns. More importantly, proven technology\nfor its application in space missions already exists. The use of solar arrays made up of\nphotovoltaic cells is the most ideal solar power generating system for Mars since photovottaic\ncells do not depend on a single point light source. In spite of all these positives, Mars is farther\nfrom Sun, has an atmosphere, prone to seasonal dust storms and dust accumulation, and Mars\'\norbital eccentricity make solar power a highly variable source. These factors must be carefully\nconsidered in designing a solar power generating system for Mars.\n\nI\n\nm\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe incident radiation on Mars (irradiation), S is given by\n--\n\nW\n\n2\n\n(I)\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\nwhere p. is the cosine of the solar zenith angle, So = 590\n\nW/m 2\n\niS the solar irradiance at Mars\'\n\nmean distance r from Sun (Haberle, et. ai. 1993). This solar irradiance is subject to high\nseasonal variations due to Mars\' high orbital eccentricity relative to that of earth. The maximum\navailable irradiance at perihelion (point of orbit nearest to Sun) is 717 W/m 2, whereas at aphelion\n(point of orbit farthest from Sun) the maximum available irradiance drops down to 493 W/m 2\n(Haberle, et.al. 1993). The daily average insolation S is describedb_::_e_o]|owing\n\nequation:\n\n-\'2\n_=\n\n_\xc2\xb0 tr/\n\n(cosScos0sinH\n\n(2)\n\n+ HsinSsin0)\n\n=\n:=\n\nwhere 0 and 8 are latitude and solar declination and H is the half day length. According to\nHaberle et al the least variation is observed at low latitudes of northern hemisphere and most\nvariation is observed at high latitudes of southern hemisphere (Haberle, et. al., 1993). The\n....................\namount of solar radiatbn availabli_-is also impacted by the Martian af_no-__-ere as it allows\nradiation only with wavelengths greater than 200 nm to pass through. The dust particles\nsuspended in the atmosphere scatter the incident radiation and cause a major degradation in the\navailability of solar power. Figure 1 illustrates the effects listed above. The Viking 2 lander data\nwas used in this example (James, et. al., 1998). The upper left hand plot provides the estimated\nsolar insolation calculated above the Viking 2 lander site. The effects of orbital eccentricity and\nsolar zenith angle variations are seen. Although, this calculation did not depend on measured\ndata, the drop-out regions correspond to times during which the Viking 2 lander was not providing\ndata. The data represents approximately 1.3 Martian years. The upper right hand plot provides\nthe optical depth data as measured by the Viking 2 lander. The higher optical depth values\ndenote times of a dust laden atmosphere, The normalized net irradiance function estimates the\nsolar energy reaching the surface. The instantaneous power, which would have been produced\nby an 1850 m2 photovoltaic array with 20% efficiency, is provided in the lower right hand plot.\n\n=\n\nIn addition to the atmospheric conditions impacting the availability of sunlight for use in\nphotovoltaic cells, other factors also effect the performance of solar arrays. The solar cells give\nthe best output at temperature ranges of 150 K to 200 K (Haberle, et. al., 1993). Large solar\narrays must be able to withstand wind loads under high winds and wind-blown dust can cause\nabrasion on the surface of the cells. Dust accumulation resulting from dust storms is one of the\nmajor concerns in the use of solar arrays. The performance of the solar cells will undergo\nsignificant decline if several monolayers of dust are deposited on the surface. The estimated\ndecline for a two year period is 77 percent (Landis, 1997). Therefore, adequate provisions for\ndust removal are necessary to harness maximum results from the use of solar arrays.\nMartian Wind Energy Resources\nWind results from the motions of the air in the atmosphere which is caused by the variable\nheating of air from the sun. The wind speed at the surface is zero, it increases with height rapidly\nwhen close to the surface, and the rate of increase declines with greater height. The variation of\nthe wind speed with height can be estimated using a power exponent function\n\nv(z)=\n\n(3)\n\nwhere z is height above the surface, V_ is the wind speed at the reference height z_above\nsurface, V(z) is the wind speed at height z, and c_is an exponent which depends on the\nroughness of the terrain. Therefore, the above equation can be used for estimation of the mean\nwind velocity at a certain height, if the mean wind velocity at a reference height is known (Walker\nand Jenkins, 1997). This relationship is demonstrated in Figure 2.\n\nForum\n\n133\n\n134\n\nLPI\n\nContribution\n\nNo.\n\n979\n\nD\n\nSolar Insolation\n\nOptical Depth-\n\n- Viking 2\n\nViking 2\n\n3\n\n6OO\nEE\nE3-\n\nrole\n\n_2\n\n4OO\n\n\xc2\xa33\n\nO4\n\nE\n\nJ\n\nIm\n\n200\n(3\n0\n\ni\n\n200\n\n0\n\nNormalized\n\n400\n\n0\n\n600\n\ni\n\n200\nInstantaneous\n\nNet Irradiance\n\n600\n\n400\nPower\n\n2OO\n\n0.8\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n0,6\n\n-150\n\nc\n\ni\n\n-- O.4\n\ntoo\n\nI\n\n63\n\n__ 5o\n\n0.2\n\ni\ni\n\n0\n\n0\n\n200\n\nTime (orbital\n\n400\nposition-\n\n0\n\n600\ndegrees)\n\nI\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nTime (orbital position - degrees)\ni\n\nFigure 1.

These winds are predicted to have velocities of 25 to\n33 m/s at 25 meters above the surface.\nThese winds have been analytically\nreproduced\nusing\ndata generated from measurements\nmade by the Viking 1 lander (James, et. al., 1998). There\nare also suggestions\nthat large diameter craters may produce an increase in wind velocity above\nthe ambient flow (Haslach, 1989).\nNote that Figure 2 also includes (for comparison)\na schematic\nof a 25 meter tall VAWT positioned five meters off of the ground.\n\nw\n\n.\n\n-7\n\n_t=_=\nm\n\nIn order to design a wind turbine we must also focus on two fundamental\nConcepts\nenergy,\npower, or energy per unit time.

The type and design of a power\ngenerating system is interrelated with specific mission scenario considered. However, the\nfollowing three energy needs are assumed for a Mars mission: baseline life support,\nscience/exploration activities (such as rover operations or drilling), and ascent vehicle propellant\nproduction. The relative requirements and timing of these_ne.eds w!l[ determine the niche wind\nenergy will fill. As such, the following niches for wind energy generation in the manned Mars\nmission planning and implementation are assumed:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nas a tertiary power supply in a primarily nuclear mission to enhance the safety and reliability\nas well as limiting abort-to-orbit scenarios;\nas a secondary power supply in an all-solar mission to lessen the effects of dust-storm power\nreductions;\nas a primary power supply in an early Martian settlement with rudimentary in-situ construction\ncapabilities;\nas a mobile power supply option to enhance and/or enable long-distance rover operations;\nand\nas a cooperative power supply to enable non-nuclear unmanned precursor mission of\nextended surface duration.\n\nThis project will consider only scenario number 2 listed above.\n\ni\n\nli\n\nII\n\ni\n\nIIIi\n\nW\n\nIII\n\nlib\n\nSecond\n\nHEDS-UP\n\n=\n\nEnergy Needs for an All-Solar Mission\nThe current estimates of energy needs for an all-solar mission call for an energy budget of 17 kW\ncontinuous energy during the day and 9 kW continuous energy during the night for clear\nconditions (George, 1999). This includes 1 kW continuous energy during the day for rover\noperations. During dust storm conditions, the daytime utilization needs drop to 16 kW\ncontinuous, as rover operations will be curtailed. Hence, the baseline energy needs for an initial\noutpost are assumed to be 16 + 9 = 25 kW continuous during daylight hours (assuming no energy\nstorage losses). Hence, if a Martian day is assumed to be 12 hrs per day, the daily energy needs\nare 25 x 12 = 300 kW-hr. Therefore, for 600 Martian days, total baseline energy requirement is\n600 x 300 / 1000 = 180 MW-hr.\n\nm\n\nm\n\nHowever, due to losses during dust-storms (radiation reaching the array may drop to 15% of clear\ncondition values), an all-solar mission must utilize a solar array eight times larger than needed for\nthe baseline requirements during clear conditions. Given this requirement, the daily solar power\nproduced during clear conditions is 8 x 300 = 2400 kW-hr. Assuming that dust storms could\noperate for up to 150 Martian days, the total energy production over 600 Martian days with such a\nproduction system would be: (450 x 2400 + 150 x 300) / 1000 = 1,125 MW-hr.\nAdditionally, daily rover operation requirements during a clear 12 hour day equals 12 kW-hr.\nOver the course of 450 clear Martian days, the total rover energy requirement is 5 MW-hr.\n\nIW\n\nAlso, (Baker and Zubrin, 1990) and (Zubrin, et. al. 1991) propose that 107 tons of\nmethane/oxygen propellant (for ascent and Earth-return) can be produced on Mars from 5.7 tons\nof hydrogen brought from earth arid carbon dioxide from Martian atmosphere. The energy needs\nfor this activity are 370 MW-hr over the 600 clay mission.- There is expected to be sufficient\nexcess energy production during clear conditions to meet these needs.\nm\n\nJ\n\nD\nB\n\nIw\n\nHence total energy needs for the entire 600 day mission is 180 + 5 + 370 =-555 MW-hr.\nTherefore, the excess energy production is 1,125 - 555 = 570 MW-hr. The utility of wind energy\nproduction systems in an all-solar mission would be to allow the reduction of mass (and therefore\ncost) of the solar arrays needed to meet dust storm conditions.\nDesign of a Horizontal Wind Turbine\n\nN\n\nWind turbine designs can be categorized into two different groups - turbines that depend on\naerodynamic lift and turbines that utilize aerodynamic drag. For the same swept area the power\nproduced by lift type turbines far exceeds the powergenerated by drag type turbines. Therefore,\ndue to size constraints on the wind turbine design for Mars, the lift type turbines are preferable.\nSome of the other important features of the two t]tpes that need to be considered in a Martian\nwind turbine design are listed below:\n\nz\nm\n\nDrag Type Turbines:\n.......\n\'.............\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nmainly low speed devices driven by drag forces acting on the rotor\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nmove slgwer than.the wind, and their motion reduces power extract!on\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ntorque at the rotor shaft is relatively high\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nexamples include traditional windmills and pumping devices\n\nm\n\nw\n\nB\n\nLift Type Turbines:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nmainly high speed devices driven by lift forces on the blades\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nlinear speed of blades is generally faster than the wind speed\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ntorque on the rotor shaft is relatively lower\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nexamples include modern electrical power producing turbines\n(Walker and Jenkins, 1997).\n\nForum\n\n137\n\n138\n\nLPI\n\nContribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nThe wind turbines can be further classified into horizontal axis and vertical axis machines. The\nhorizontal axis or propeller type turbines are more abundant and this technology is highly\ndeveloped. The previous work by (Ferrell, et. al., 1998) considered an 18 meter diameter\nHorizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) which would produce 2.5 kW in a wind speed of 13 m/s.\nAlternatively, a 30 meter diameter turbine in a 25 m/s wind would produce 28 kW. This design\neffort suggested that wind turbines with sizes approaching large utility scale terrestrial wind\nturbines would be required. However, the chord lengths would be three times the values for\nsimilar turbines on Earth. Likewise, the thickness to chord ratio could be expected to be 1.5 times\nthat of terrestrial turbines. Also, the power output (and imposed torque values) would be 1/10 the\nvalues seen on terrestrial turbines of a similar size.\n\niB\n\ni\n\nIB\n\nBB\n\nDesign Approach\n\nand Results\n\nDesign of a Vertica|\' Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)\n\n_\n\nThis project will design a Darrieus type Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) for energy production\non Mars. There are some specific advantages associated with the vertical-axis machines,\nespecially the Darrieus type, making the design concept potentially more suitable for a Martian\napplication:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ntheir symmetry about the vertical axis a lows them to operate independent of the wind\ndirection, so a yawning mechanism is not required\n........\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nheavy gearboxes and generators may be situated at ground level permitting easier\nmaintenance, a low support platform, and easier deployment\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nthe device is shaped such that centrifugal loads are balanced by pre tension forces in the\nblades, thus avoiding bending moments; thus, the turbine shaft carries axial and torque loads\nonly\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nthe blades do not suffer fatigue stresses from gravitational forces during rotation\n(Walker and Jenkins, 1997).\nAdditionally, the Darrieus VAWT may be much more amenable to a deployable installation.\nIn spite of the many advantages associated with the DarrieuStype vertical axis wind turbine,\nsome of the accompanying drawbacks listed below cannot be overlooked because\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ntheyare not self-starting\nthe torque fluctuates during each revolution as the blades move into and out of the wind\nspeed regulation at high wind speeds can be difficult.\n\nThe next secti0n+discuSsesthe\n\nm\n\nI\n\nII\nm\nI\n\nm\n\nIB\n\nI\nII\nII\n\nm\n\nJ\n\nsteps used in the turbine design.\n\nTypical Darrieus VAWT Configuration\nThe rotor subsystem consists of two curved blades whose ends are attached to fixed upper and\nlower hubs. The hubs are attached to the rotor column or the tower. The blades are symmetrical\nin cross-section and they have a troposkien shape that results in a minimal internal bending\nstress The rotor height is usually 15% to 30% larger than the rotor diameter. The power train\nsubsystem consists of mechanical and electrical equipment to convert the rotor\'s mechan ca\npower into electrical power. The essential power train components are a turbine shaft, a gearbox\nto enhance speed, a generator drive shaft, a rotor brake, and an electrical generator. All these\ncomponents are located close to the ground thereby permitting convenient maintenance and :\ndeployment. The proximity of the components to the ground also leads to a low support platform.\nThe support structure subsystem consists of a support stand, three structural cables, and the\nupper and lower rotor bearings. The support cables connect the top of the tower to the ground\nanchors at an angle of elevation ranging in between 30 to 40 degrees thereby providing stability\nto the tower by restraining the movement of its center of the mass (Spera, 94). The cable tension\nresults in a downward thrust load on upper rotor bearing which is ultimately transferred to the\n\nII\niii\n\nI\n\nW\n\n11111\n\nJ\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\n__J\n\nsystem foundation through the rotor column, lower rotor bearing, and the support stand. The\nheight of the support stand is such that it provides sufficient ground clearance for the rotating\nblades.\nWind Turbine\n\nDesign Process\n\nOverview\n\n_==u.\n\nThe wind turbine design process utilized in this work is based on a series of performance analysis\nsteps covering the major a.spects of the wind turbine design. These steps include defining the\nblade shape, Calculating the aerodynamic loads (pfim_irily used to-estimate conversion\nefficiency), design of the guy cables, calculating the axial blade loads, tower design, and\nestimation of support system mass. As with most design exercises, these steps were performed\niterat!ve!Y,. However, the process and the results will be discussed sequentially in this section.\nBlade Shape\nDarrieus-style VAWTs typically- utiliZe blades shaped to minimize bending stesses (Eggars,\n1991). The shape of the blade excluding the effects of gravity is:\n\n(8)\n\nR = cos(y / "_/--Rce\n)\nw\n\nwhere R is the blade radius, y is the height along the tower, and RCEis the radius of curvature at\nthe equator.\nFigure 5 shows a typical Darrieus-style VAWT with two blades shaped using the above equation.\nN\n\nVertical Axis Wind Turbine\n3O\n\n25\n\nw\n\n10\n\nN\n0\n\nI\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n0\n. - Width (m)\n\nFigure 5.

Multi-streamtube modeling considers\nthe volume represented by the revolution of the rotor as a series of adjacent, aerodynamically\nindependent stream tubes. The torque and normal forces generated by aerodynamic lift and drag\nforces are estimated and used to calculate overal! turbine performance. It should be noted that\nthe procedure was limited to small set of airfoils designed for terrestrial conditions. Also, the lift\nand drag coefficients that were calculated for these airfoils may not be completely accurate for\nMartian conditions. And finally, the doubie-muitipie Streamtube model is most appropropriate for\nlow solidity turbines (solidity is the ratio of blade chord to total swept area). This may have\ncaused some inaccuracies in the results as the final design had a relatively high solidity.\nThe performance of the wind turbine was determined using SLICEIT computerg\xc2\xa3d_ as\ndeveloped and provided by Sandia National Laboratories (Berg and Rumsey, 1991 and Berg,\n1992). The computer program is in FORTRAN consisting of a main program and several text\nfiles which store airfoil and input data fields. The program allows a model to be created based on\nexisting data by evaluating number of blade sections and interpolating as a function of the\nReynolds number and the angle of attack. The program also uses Martian parameters such as\nthe viscosity, and atmospheric and gravitational data !o createa model. Several different airfoil\nfamilies were included and evaluated by trail runs with the program SLICEIT. These airfoils had\nbeen specifically designed for terrestrial vertical axis wind turbines. These include the SNLA\n0021/50, SNLA 0018/50, and the SNLA 0118/50. These airfoils were the first to be examined\nusing the SLICEIT.\n\nW\n\nm\nW\n\nn\n\ng\n\nm\n\nl\n\ng\n\nn\nThe calculations were made at 5 mph increments from 20 to a maximum of 100 mph wind speed.\nThe program takes into account the effect of the boundary layer on the velocity profile by a user\ninput of the empirical wind shear exponent. This was ignored in preliminary test cases but was\nadded in later cases. A single airfoil type was used for the entire blade length on initial trial runs.\nHowever, the most efficient earth-based wind turbines use two or three different airfoils types\nalong the length of the blade. After unimpressive results, a multiple airfoil type model was quickly\nadopted. The SNLA 21/50 and the SNLA 0018/50, located along the equatorial region and near\nthe tower respectively, produced the largest power outputs. A chord length to radius ratio as a\nrequired input was determined through experimentation and correlating earth based wind turbine\nparameters. This ratio was also allowed to vary along the blade. The power extraction is\nobviously higher with three blades as opposed to two, but the added power output is often not\nworth the weight gain associated with the extra blade.\nThe final design included the two airfoil shapes (SNLA 0018/50 near the tower and SNLA 21/50\nat the equator) and three chord lengths (3.2 m, 2.8m, and 1.8 m) along the blade. The turbine\nwas chosen to rotate at 75 rpm. The turbine height was 30.5 meters and had a diameter of 19\nmeters. The turbine had a maximum coefficient of power of .59 and produced 14.1 kW in a 25\nm/s wind.\n\nU\n\nm\n\nJ\n\nU\n\nI\nz\nm\n\nU\n\nm\n\nGuy Cable Design\nThe proper design of guy cables is complicated and highly dependent on tower design, structural\ndynamics, static loads, and temperature cycling. However, (Sullivan,1979) provides some\nguidelines for an initial guy cable design. The main purpose of this system is to offset\naerodynamic loads. Since these loads are an order-of-magnitude less than the corresponding\nloads on a similar-sized turbine on Earth, the suggested cable tension values were also\ndecreased by an order-of-magnitude.\nIt should be noted that this analysis did not include the\ncritical issues of structural dynamics or thermal changes.\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nU\n\n[]\nI\n\nu\n\nSecond\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nThe final guy cables were chosen as aluminum (although no detailed materials selection process\nwas performed). For this size turbine, (Sullivan, 1979) suggested 15,000 Ibs of pretension.\nHowever, it was pointed out that the suggested values were conservative and successful\napplications existed with V2of the suggested tension. Hence, 7,500 Ibs was chosen as the\nappropriate value of tension for a terrestrial turbine. Since the aerodynamic loads on Mars are\nexpected to be 1/10 of the terrestrial values, 750 lbs was chosen as the pretension value. Three\ncables were chosen with a 30 degree angle. A .004 meter radius was chosen. The resulting\nmass of the cable system was assumed to be 24 kg. An additional 50 kg was added for\nanchoring systems such as augers.\nAxial Load on Blade\nThe calculations of the axial loads on the blades are examined as presented by (Eggars,1991).\nThe initial calculation of axial loads on the turbine blades can be made without considering the\naerodynamic forces normal to the turbine blade as the inertial forces tend to dominate. Equation\n9 was used to estimate axial loads:\n5_ =\n\nF = mgy+lma\n\n2\n\n2[R_\n\n_ R 2]+ mReRce\n\nf2 2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(9)\n\n[]\nIj\nL_\n=\n\n=\n\nm\n\nR\n\nL.I\n\nwhere m is the mass per unit length of the blade, g is the acceleration due to gravity, .Qis the\nrotation rate, and R is the radius at height y, RE is the radius at the equator, and RCE is the Radius\nof curvature at the equator. Investigations of the effects of gravitational and inertial forces acting\non the blades reveal that the effects of gravity on the blade are also modest in comparison to the\ninertial forces. To completely examine the effects of gravity and centrifugal loading, the mass\ndistribution needs to be known. A force to mass per unit length ratio was assumed constant\nbased on a requirement that the local stresses on the beam element are constant everywhere.\nThis assumption allows a simplified model to be developed for the wind turbine to assess the\neffects of gravity and inertia. It should be noted that axial loads only were used to design the\nblade (material properties and wall thickness). Aerodynamic loads were not considered at this\ntime. Structural dynamics issues were not addressed either.\nIt was quickly determined that an ultralight blade design was required in order to approach mass\nfeasibility. Hence, the final design resulted in a thickness of .0005 m and a material density of\n1100 kg/m^3. This material could be met with a variety of synthetic materials including nylon,\nrubber, neoprene, or polystyrene. It should be noted that such a design would invariably need to\nbe inflated and supported with an internal frame or external strut. The next design iteration would\nnecessarily include these structures. The mass of the blades was therefore 284 kg.\nTower Design\n\nU\n\nThe parameters needed to define the tower include the optimal tower diameter, its wall\nthickness, the material, and the imposed axial load. The relationships, which take into, account\nthe critical buckling loads, compressive stresses, and shear stresses, are found in (Sullivan, 1979\nand Beer and Johnston, 1981). Neither, structural dynamics nor thermal changes were\nconsidered in the design. The final design was a .3 m diameter aluminum tube with a .002 inch\nwall thickness. Approaching mass feasibility was the primary driving factor in this design. The\nfinal design was 435 kg.\nTotal Mass\n\nit::::::a\n\nAn additional 150 kg was added for support equipment such as the generator, gearbox, bearings,\nand brakes. Therefore the total mass of the system was found to be 944 kg upon summing the\nestimated masses from the above sections.\n\nForum\n\n141\n\n142\n\nLPI\n\nContribution\n\nNo.\n\n979\n\nm\n\nFeasibility Verification\nThe feasibility of the initial design was evaluated using the energy to mass ratio of solar cells\nduring dust storm conditions. The resulting solar array size for the scenario listed in the previous\nsection is expected to be six to seven thousand square meters (George, 1999). The mass of\nsuch a system is estimated to be 11 to 13 m_\netric tons. One half of this mass results from the\nsolar cells and the support structure. Assuming a 12 metric ton system, this would suggest six\nmetric tons of solar array. The remaining six metric tons would be dedicated to fuel cells and\npower conditioning equipment. Therefore, energy output for these arrays per unit mass during\ndust storms = 300/6 = 50 kW-hr per metric ton. For comparison, on a clear day the energy output\nper unit mass = 2400/6 = 400 kW-hr per metric ton. Hence the following relationship will be used\nto define feasibility of the initial design:\n\ni\n\n2\n\ni\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\nm\n\nI\n\nMw (metric ton) _<(1/50) Ew (kW-hr) = .02 Ew\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Mw is the mass of the wind turbine, and Ew is the energy produced in one day. The\nenergy produced by the wind turbine would be estimated as the integrated value of power\nproduced over a Martian day. A typical approximation is to define this energy based on the\nmaximum wind speed the turbine sees for at least one hour in a given Martian day. Figure 6\nshows the variation in the minimum sustained wind speed of 28 m/s needed to assure feasibility\nof the turbine design described above. It should be noted that this value falls in the range of the\nexpected slope winds on the planet.\nFeasiblity\n\n5\n\ni\n\n4"5\n\nof Case #102\n\ni\n\ni\n\n- Cp=.59,\n\n_\n\nA=375m\n\nIf\n\nII\n\n2, S=.02\n\ni\n\nm\n\ni\n\ni\n\n/_\n\n/1\n\nt\n\n4\n\nm\n\ni\n\ng3.5\nlID\ne-\n\nJ\n\nc\n\n"6 2.5\nm\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n0.5\n\n0\n10\n\n15\n\ni\n20\n\n1\n25\nMaximum\n\nWind\n\n_]\n30\nSpeed Active\n\n3_5\n\n410\n\nI\n45\n\n_0\n\nfor 1 Hour (m/s)\n\nFigure 6.

An increase in the length of on-site times over previous manned missions allows for greater\nscientific\nand exploratory\nflexibility.\nWith this flexibility\ncomes new opportunities\nfor increasing\nour\nunderstanding\nof the solar system in which weklive.\nTo take advantage of these opportunities\nrequires the\ndevelopment\nof new long-range\ntransportation\nsystems.\nSuch systems must be able to operate in adverse\nenvironments\nwith minimal\ninvestment\nin infrastructure\nwhile providing\na high scientific\nreturn on\ninvestment.\n\nm\n\nI\n\nI\nAn aerial research\nvehicle provides\na great deal of mobility in selecting specific sites to explore. Recent\ndevelopments\nin the space community\nhave recognized the need to explore beyond the limited scope offered\nby a stationary base camp or even a land rover. An airborne research vehicle provides the mobility to explore\nareas of interest that lie at great distances from the base site. Long distance missions requires the crew to\nhave a great deal of discretion in selecting destinations based on information not available before the mission.\nAirships have the flexibility to travel to sites without prior knowledge of the site\'s conditions.\nThe selection\nof an airship as the primary mode of transl_ortation\nmaximizes the crew\'s ability to act on "local decisions"\nwhich in turn increase the mission\'s scientific return.\n\nm\nB\n\ng\n\nm\n\nm\n[]\ni\n\n2.0 Reference\n\nMission\n\nAs a starting point, the class was given the NASA Mars Reference\nthe following URL: http://www-sn.jsc.nasa.gov/marsref/contents.html.\n\nMission.\n\nThis document\n\nis available\n\nfrom\n\nm\nm\n\n3.0 Design\n\nIll\n\nConstraints\n\nThe Mars Reference\nMission provided\na base set of: design criteria from which ou r other criteria were\ncreated. Project requirements\nfor distance and total trip time also played a large part in the determination\nof\nthe final vehicle configuration.\nMARV must be capable of safely transporting\nat least three people and the\nrequisite life support and scientific equipment to virtually any point on Mars within a pre-determined\namount\nof time. The base camp, located in Western\nDaedalia Planum, will serve as an operational\nbase for all\nmission sorties and at times as a communications\nrelay for contact with Earth.\n\nm\n\nm\nI\n\nm\n\nI\n\n4.0 Why a Lighter-Than-Air\nSeveral possible\nballistic vehicle,\ndeveloped\n\ndesigns were originally\nand a lighter-than-air\n\nVehicle?\nconsidered.\nThree designs were explored in depth, an airplane, a\nvehicle. From these three a final configuration\nwas selected and\n\nI\n\nfurther.\nm\n\n4.1 Airplane\nSeveral\n\nvariations\n\nof the Mars plane configuration\n\nwere studied,\n\nall of which entailed\n\nvery large wings\n\nspans\n\nU\n\nand many structural difficulties.\nA length of 65m and a wingspan of 155m posed the greatest challenges\nto\nthe airplane concept. Stowing the vehicle inside the descent lander\'s\n19m long payload shroud requires the\nwings and the fuselage to fold at multiple points, thus making assembly on Mars difficult and uncertain.\nFinally through the requirements,\nthe plane has to be capable of landing at unimproved\nlanding sites. With\nsuch a large wing span, the possibility\nof landing at any unimproved\nsites is very uncertain and difficult at\nbest. The combination\nof these problems led to the search for a better solution.\nR\n\n=__\nI\n\n-\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\n=\n\n=\n\n4.2 Ballistic\n\n=\n\n=\n\nSub-orbital\nflight was originally considered\nas a viable option because of the high velocities and short trip\ntimes (M hour) inherent in ballistic vehicles.\nDriving the design were the requirements\nfor antipodal range\nand in-situ resource utilizatlon\n(iSRU).\nCarbon Dioxide and Liquid Oxygen were chosen as the vehicle\'s\npropellant combination\nsince both CO2 and LOX can be extracted from the Martian Atmosphere.\nRound trip\nantipodal flight on Mars requires at least 11.4 km/s AV. Using CO2/LOX,\nwith an Isp of 300 sec, the vehicle\ncan only produce a maximum of 6.9 krrds AV. Extracting the necessary 622 mt of propellant at a rate of 21\nmt/sol requires 829 mt of equipment\nand 25 MW of power. Manufacturing\nsufficient quantities of propellant\nwould have necessitated\nmore time, power, and support equipment than were available within the scope of\nthe Mars Reference Mission and the Design Constraints.\n\n!\n\n4.3 Lighter-Than-Air\n\n-\n\n:\n\nU\n\n[]\n\nE-B\n\no\n\nA lighter-than-air\nvehicle with a volume of 2.3 million cubic meters would be capable of lifting the required\nstructure and payload.\nLanding on unimproved\nterrain can be accomplished,\nand final approach can be done\nvisually due to the slow speed. The Vehicle has the advantage of high definition mapping and exploring any\nsights of interest while en-route. The proposed non-rigid design can be stored compactly for transportation\nto\nMars. Solar generated electric power could provide for both propulsion needs during flight and equipment\npower on-site. The power produced\nand thus the speed varies throughout the day. The system was planned\naround 12.5 meters per second average velocity.\n\n4.4 Conclusion\n=\n\nU\nit:i_\n\nOf the three configurations\nevaluated the lighter-than-air\nvehicle was deemed most viable. Both the airplane\nand ballistic vehicles suffered logistics problems resulting from structural complexity\nor resource availability.\nA lighter-than-air\nvehicle, while very large, is able to circumvent\nthese obstacles through\nits inherent\nsimplicity of design, construction,\nand assembly.\n\n5.0 Missions\nSortie mission sites, as well as the base site, have been determined\nas part of our mission requirements.\nMARV and the crew are required to land, perform scientific experiments\nat site, gather scientific samples\nfrom site and return to base camp. Western Daedalia Planum, base site, is located at 19\xc2\xb0S, 144\xc2\xb0W. The site\nis located at an altitude of 3 km. The terrain is a relatively smooth, flat plain.

mixture.\nThis suggests that the climate in this area has been this way for a long\ntime.\nAn important\ngoal is to measure the water and C02 content of the ice. Seismology,\ngeology and\natmospheric\nsciences will be studied here. Since there is ice present at this site, exobiological\nexperiments\nwill be performed on certain samples.\n\nw\n\n6.4 Maja\n\nValles\n\nand Candor\n\nw\n\nI\n\nm\n\n=\n\nThis sortie is knows as "The Triangle Mission" because two sites will be visited and the path from base camp\nto Maja Valles to Candor and back to base camp makes a triangle.\nMaja Valles lies in an outflow channel.\nFrom this site information\nabout Martian morphoi0gy,\nOutflow dynam_s,-s_ratigraphy\ncan be collected.\nImportant\nsamples\nthat can be collected\nare sediments\nfrom channels-and\nfan-deltas\nand lake deposit.\nAncient crustal material, crater ejecta, and exposed strata will also be studied at this site. As with most of the\nother sites, atmospheric\nsamples will be collected and studied. There is also remote chance that ground ice\nmay exist at this site. If so, it will be studied and exobiological\nexperiments will be performed.\nThe second site on the sortie is Candor. It is believed that Candor was a locus of ground water discharge on\nMars. Because of this, there could be microbial minerals precipitated\nby iron bacteria located at the heads of\nchannels, sapping sites, and in lake sediments.\nOne of the main objectives at this site is to collect samples of\niron ore from red and black ground patches to examine the morphology\nof iron and magnesium\noxides that\nmay have been precipitated\nby ancient iron bacteria.\n\nw\n\n6.5 Upper\n\nMangala\n\nValles\n\nMost of the scientific work done here will include taking samples of Hespian-age and Nochian-age\nAlso, nearby crater ejecta will be collected and studied.\nMeteorological\nexperiments will also be\nto study the atmosphere.\nNo equipment for studying exobiology will be taken to this site, as this\nbelieved to have any significance\nas far as life is concerned.\nHowever, exobiological\nexperiments\nperformed at base-camp on samples that have been collected.\n\n6.6 Sinus\n\nSabaeus\n\nmaterials.\nperformed\narea is not\ncan still be\n\nNortheast\n\nThis site is located on a smooth plain known as the Plateau Sequence. Of major interest on this site is a\nmound known as "White Rock" which is in a crater on the plain. It is believed that this rock made up of\nplaya deposits composed of chemically precipitated\nevaporite minerals. These types of formations are\nimportant to study because they have the potential to for preservation of organisms and biomolecules.\nAlso\nof interest are channels that flow into the crater, which resemble terrestrial dendritic drainage systems.\n\n6. 7 Scientific\n\nEquipment\n\nIn order to satisfy the scientific objectives, EVAs will be performed on a regular basis to collect samples and\nperform experiments.\nMost of the samples collected will be in the form of rocks, dust, or samples obtained\nfrom the subsurface by drilling.\nThe vehicle\'s\nlaboratory will be able to perform tests to determine the age\nand composition\nof the samples, as well as detect water or any volatiles that may be present in the sample.\nMeteorological\nexperiments\nwill be performed\nto determine\nproperties\nof the air, such as aerosol content,\nwind speed, pressure, and temperature.\nExobiological\nequipment\nwill be taken on some of the sorties that\nappear to have biological\nsignificance.\nThis equipment will allow for the detection of organic materials and\nthe determination\nof whether they are of Martian0rigin\nor the resuk of contamination\nfrom

The internal pressure of the gas creates the\ngreatest amount of stress, which is in the hoop direction.\nThe longitudinal\nstress of 17 MPa is about half the\namount of the stress in the hoop direction.\nThe lifting gas imparts a bending moment of 976,000 N-re. This\nmoment is a result of the super-pressure\ncreated, which causes the ends of the envelope to bend downward\nthereby, creating stress on the top of the envelope.

Kevlar was chosen because it is twice as strong as Nylon-66 and 50% stronger than Eglass. Kevlar also has a high tear resistance. The inner hull will consist of 0.012mm thick Mylar, which will\nbe used to contain the lifting gas. Mylar was chosen because of its low permeability to hydrogen. Ballonets\nconstructed of Mylar will occupy the lower half of the envelope and provide trim control.\n\nBB\n\n[]\n\n[]\n8.4 Pressure\n\nVessel\n\nDesign\n\nm\n\nu\n\n8.4.1 Assumptions\n\n=\nThe analysis for the minimum wall thickness was based on the hoop stress of a cylinder with hemispherical\nendcaps.

Furthermore,\nthis is also taking into consideration\nthe factor that the operating\ntemperature\non Mars is much lower than that of an Earth-based\nsatellite.\nThe Ultra Flex Array Design was\nchosen as the anticipated array design because it provides the type of flexibility that will be needed to mount\nthe solar array on the blimp\'s envelope.\nThe solar flux is approximately\n22% of that received in Earth orbit\nbecause of atmospheric\nlosses and Mars\' greater distance from the Sun. Furthermore,\ndust storm conditions\ncharacteristic\nof the Martian environment\ndrop this percentage to roughly 6.5%, or approximately\n86.9 W/m 2.\nPower at the beginning\nof life, Pbol, is a function of cell efficiency\nand solar flux. Power required by the\nsolar array, Psa, is a function of the power necessary to conduct day and night operations. Power required at\nthe end of life, Peol, is a function of lifetime degradation\nand Pbol. Lifetime of the solar array system was\nestimated at one year for the primary purpose of attempting to reduce the overall mass of the system.\n\nm\n\n--___=\n\nThe power storage system will consist of nickel-hydrogen\n(NiH2) batteries.

It is assumed that EVAs occur only during daylight hours, are conducted\nby two astronauts,\nhave\nmaximum\nduration of four hours, and do not exceed\n6-km\n\ne-=--1\n\nradius\n\nfrom\n\nthe base\n\nsatellite\nimages of the\nthe crew for EVA site\nresolution\nworthy\nto\nautonomous\nEVAs.

It is also assumed that one\ncomponent of a human Mars mission is to deploy small,\npermanent,\nscientific packages,\nor Deployable\nInstrument Packages\n(DIPs), on the surface of Mars.\nIt is\nassumed that these self-contained\npackages may contain\ninstruments\nsuch as barometers,\nanemometers,\nthermometers,\nor seismometers\nwith a mass of 20 kg and\ndimensions\nof 40 centimeters\n(cm) by 40 cm by 20 cm.\nThe rover also carries a 7 degree-of-freedom\n(DOF)\ndexterous\nmanipulator\nfor geological\nsampling, which\nis provided\nas a pre-integrated\npayload but depends\nupon the vehicle to provide\npower and intelligence.\nFinally, the size and mass of the rover is such that it\nmeets functional\nrequirements\nfor scientific and carrying capabilities\nand yet is limited to accommodate\nsmall\nstorage space, both on the transit spacecraft and at the\nbase camp.\nA target vehicle mass and size of 300 kg\nand 2 cubic meters are set with the consideration\nthat,\nin the event of a tumble, the astronaut\nis capable of\nrighting\n\nthe vehicle.\n\nperiod of time, it must be easily repaired\nand maintained.

The following\nare samples of detailed design scenarios\nused to illustrate\nthe range of\nrover applications as well as depict expected worst-case\nsituations\nfor various aspects\nof the rover.

Of that three hours, one hour\nof travel is spent traversing\n+/- 3 degree slope terrain\n(30 minutes at +3 degrees, 30 minutes at -3 degrees),\nand a minimum of 20 minutes are spent on +/- 20 degree sloped terrain (10 minutes at +20 de_ees,\n10 minutes at -20 degees)\nat a maximum speed of 4.8 km/hr.\nThe remainder\nof the travel time is spent traversing\nlevel ground.

Each of the re-supply landers\nwill provide human necessities along with scientific and monitoring equipment to be used for the duration of the traverse,\nExperiments\nwill be performed to analyze the Martian soil using the Deep Driller which will be capable of drilling down to\n100 meters in 3-5 days. Safety is a major issue for the VLTV crew. For this reason an emergency rover concept for\nrescuing the VLTV crew in an emergency is being studied.

Adobe construction\nand use plays a vital\nrole in this base camp mission architecture\nand in the eventual development\nand self-sufficiency\nof humans on the surface of\nMars. The Adobe exterior serves as a shell to house the pressurized\nmembrane;\nnot as the structural\nsupport to mold and\ncontain the 9 psi environment\nwithin the habitat.\nan Adobe shell to house the inflatable membrane\n\nTo compare\ndramatically\n\nit with the reference Transhab technology for perspective,\nreduces the overall mass of a Transhab type of structure\n\nusing\non the\n\nsurface of Mars. The layers for GCR radiation and MMOD impact protection would no longer be needed, and the insulation\nlayer thickness would be greatly reduced. Water shielding and most typical types (AI) of radiation shielding material are useful\nagainst UV and SPE radiation, but have minor reduction against highly energetic galactic cosmic rays. Metal radiation shields\ncan even endanger the crew due to the harmful secondary electron production that results when impacted by GCR\'s. Galactic\nCosmic rays can only be stopped by a large, dense spatial distribution\nof material; for example Martian Regolith.\nThe Adobe habitat Construction\nrelies on the regolith drill/pump,\nISRU brick baker, plastic superadobe\nbags to hold\nsoil, an inflatable half cylinder membrane\n(smaller radius of curvature on the bottom), and a Plexiglass\nsheet supply on the\nsurface. The brick baker is a simple device, which pours Martian regolith into a mild Compression mold, bakes it in a small\nfurnace,\n\nand produces\n\na brick in the shape of the mold.\n\nMolds\n\nused in the base camp construction\n\ninclude\n\nquarter\n\nili\n\ni"\n-,,,\n\nw\n\nand half\nm\nW\n\ni\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\nw\n\n185\n\narches, flat square panes, and rectangular\nbricks. Heat for the furnace is provided by the nuclear reactor. Experiments\nwill also\nbe carried out using solar concentrators\nto bake the bricks into the desired shapes. The habitat wall structure is created using\ncoil and rectangular\nbags filled with the free supply of regolith. Each layer is formed directly on top of the other layer and\nhardened due to compression\nof the layers above it. A plastic brace is used to support the construction\nof the walls. Specific\nspaces (arches)\nare built into the wall structure\nfor the placement\npower and gas lines, Plexiglas\nwindows,\nand airlock\njunctions.\nThe roof of the habitat is constructed\nusing the "leaning arch" technique.\nArches are laid from both ends of the\nstructure in an inclined position gaining support from the previous arch until both sides meet. Quarter and half arches are\nplaced on a movable hard plastic arch track supported by struts and moved on rollers. As each inclined arch is laid in place, the\narch track is moved to the next position\nand the process\nis repeated from both sides until the roof is complete.\nCrew\ninvolvement\nin the construction\nof the habitat includes measuring and triangulation\nof the site, placement\nof the empty bags\n\nm\n\non each successive\nlayer, connecting\ntheir open end to the regolith pump, and operating/guiding\nthe servo-operated\nthree\npulley system to place the arch fragments\non the track. The 1000 kg capacity crane on the VLTV can also be used as a\nconstruction\naid if needed. The three-pulley\nsystem raises the arch segments vertically, horizontally, and laterally over the arch\ntrack, with a crew member on a platform guiding each arch segment into place. The pulley is operated by a servo located on\nthe ground. The inflatable,\nhalf-cylinder,\npolymer membrane\nprovides the pressurized environment\nof the habitat.\nThe\ninflatable has one main space qualified airlock, and two smaller internal airlocks. It is fitted with built in plumbing and powe_\nconnections\naccessed from inside and out for easy checkout and assembly. After the habitat exterior is constructed,\nthe crew\nwill lay down the base floor matting,\nand then bring in the inflatable\nto match up its airlocks\nwith the wall openings\n\nm\n\nn\n\nm\n\nm\n\nB\nU\n\nm\nm\n\nM\n!\n\nm\n\naccordingly\n(significant\nmargin is built into\nlocations). Gas and power line connections\nare\nthen inflated with oxygen and required buffer\ninitial inflation,\nthe crew will affix the base\n\nthe wall openings\nto provide easy match up with the membrane\nairlock\nmade between the membrane and ISRU facility by the crew. The membrane is\ngases at a regulated 9 psi supply pressure from the ISRU facility. After some\nof the membrane\nto the Martian surface to line up the permanent\nairlock\n\njunctions. The membrane\ninflation is completed when the internal pressure reaches 9 psi. Two inflatable tunnel airlocks (IT)\nare attached\nto the habitat,\nwith one joining\nthe lander to the habitat (IT 1), and the other joining\nthe habitat to the\nagriculture-life\nscience (LS) module (IT 2). Each IT has a seal at each end. The inner seal of IT 1 is connected to the habitat\nand opened to pressurize\nit and the habitat to 9 psi. The outer seal is then opened and the crew can walk freely out of the\nlander and into the hab. Due to the automated construction\nof the habitat, wall construction\nis expected to take 2 weeks, roof\nconstruction\n2 weeks, and membrane\ndeployment\nand integration\n1.5 weeks. A margin of two weeks is added to account for\nany delays. During the construction\nperiod, the crew will use the lander coupled with the VLTV to provide additional living\nspace. Internal supplies, furniture,\nand equipment\nwill be brought in after inflation. Some room partitions are built into the\ninflatable design, but shelves and hard walls need to be assembled after inflation. The habitat module is divided into two parts:\nthe living/recreation\narea and the work area. The work area has science laboratories,\na workshop, exercise room and a clinic.\nEquipment\nin the science laboratories\nfocuses on analyzing the radiation and geological environment\nof Mars. Laboratory\ncapabilities\nand equipment\nincludes stereo microscopes,\nSEM, TEM, EDS machine, X-Ray diffraction,\nchemical analyzers,\nsmall furnace, wet-chem lab, and computer stations for analysis. Radiation monitoring and testing equipment will be housed\nin the C&C lander module. The clinic will be used to provide crew checkups and to monitor the effects of the low gravity\nenvironment\non the human body. Some primary care is possible including minor surgery and dentistry The living space has\nthree bedrooms (with two beds per room), toilet / washroom, meeting area, eating area, and pantry to store additional food and\nsupplies. The habitat can house all six crew members, but will be occupied\nfor the majority of the mission,\nby the base\ncamp crew of three. The ECS system of the habitat sends waste water, food, and CO2 to the LS module where it is processed\nand recycled as part of the bio-regenerative\nCELSS experiment.\nAdditional backup recycling units are also found within the\nhabitat and lander modules in case of LS module failure.\n4.4\n\nLife\n\nScience\n\nModule\n\nArchitecture\n\nand\n\nConstruction\n\nThe life science (LS) module is a 9 psi pressurized\nair environment.\nIt is connected\nto the main habitat via an internal IT\nairlock. The outer structure\nof the LS module is a prefabricated\npolycarbonate\nhoneycomb\nstructure\nwith square\nshaped\n\nm\n\nIm\n\nopenings. The honeycomb\nis folded out by the crew and fixed into place (in relation to the main habitat) by hammering stakes\nthrough tabs at the base of the honeycomb\ninto the ground. Additional Martian soil bags can be added to the base if needed.\nThe LS module will experiment\nwith growing plants in natural and artificial light; therefore, part of the LS module will be\ntransparent and part opaque. 60% of the honeycomb\nwill be filled with Plexiglas\nsquares treated with a Cerous\n3\npolymethacrylate\n(CPMA)\nUV [Yen 1979] resistant coating,\nand the remaining\n40% filled with solar cells mounted on\nMartian bricks. The crew will be responsible\nfor slotting these pieces into place as part of the construction\nphase. The inner\nstructure of the LS module is a bi-layered polyethylene\ninflatable (transparent)\nsimilar to the habitat membrane with only one\n\n186LPI Contribution\n\nminor\n\nNo. 979\n\nairlock.\n\nPolyethylene\n\nPolycarbonate\n\nand CMPA\n\nand Adobe materials\n\nwere chosen\n\nwere chosen for their UV radiation\n\nfor their GCR radiation\n\nresistance\n\nshielding\n\nproperties\n\n[Wilson\n\n1997].\n\nel\n\nproperties.\n\nThe inner membrane\nenvironment\nis equivalent to the habitat / lander environment.\nThe second layer of the inflatable is a ,,,\ndense layer of Martian CO2 pumped in from outside. This layer enhances the greenhouse heating and provides additional GCR\nradiation protection. The greenhouse heating of the LS module is used (in conjunction\nwith electric power heaters) to heat the\nmain habitat using fans and cross flow heat exchanger\nlines to re-circulate\nthe warm air. After the bi-layer\ninflation\nis\ncomplete, IT 2 is connected\nto the LS and main habitat module. When the LS module is pressurized\nand heated, the seals of u\nthe tunnel will be opened allowing\nfull access between all modules. The biomass recycling/production\nchamber\nis then\nbrought into the complex to bring the CELSS online. LS module research labs include Martian soil growth experiments\nwith\n(non)genetically\nengineered\nplants in natural and artificial light, hydroponics\ngrowth laboratory,\nand an Extremophile\nlaboratory where plants are genetically engineered to thrive in a low temperature\nand pressure CO2 environment\nfor eventual\ngrowth on the surface. CO2, O2, and H20 recycling units will also be placed in the LS module to accompany\nthe biomass\nrecycling\nunits. The LS module functions as the chemi/bio-regenerative\nCELSS experiment.\nWaste water is recycled using\nfiltration for urine, baking of feces, and Zeolite Sieves to recapture water vapor produced by perspiration\nand plant\ntranspiration.\nPlant photosynthesis\nand carbon molecular\nCO2. The waste CO2 is then returned to the ISRU facility\n\nsieves located in the LS and habitat modules remove the excess\nto be re-entered into the Sabatier reaction for H20, O2, and CH4\n\nproduction.\n4.5\n\nSite\n\n-\n\nI\nDevelopment\n_j\n\nThe Mars Base camp development continues beyond the main adobe habitat and LS module construction,\nthe 600 day stay on the surface. Adobe construction\ntechniques will continue with the base camp crew\nrobotic devices\nairiocks,\n\nto develop\n\na simple\n\nelliptical\n\nroad network\n\naround base camp.\n\nThe road network\n\nover the course of\nworking with camp\n\nwill connect\n\nthe main\n\nhabitat ISRU facility, storage locations, and the MAV liftoff pad. The road network development\nconsists of clearing paths\nand using solar light concentrators\n(parabolic\nlenses) to bake the surface of the path. The crew will build Adobe storage\nhouses to store equipment,\nsupplies, and surface mobility vehicles and construct an adobe liftoff shield to protect base camp\nfrom debris\n\nbrought\n\nup during\n\ni\n\n,m\n\nliftoff and future landings.\nwff\n\n4.6\n\nCommunications\nL\n\nHigh data rate communication\nbetween Mars and Earth is accomplished\nat Ka-band directly from the surface of Mars. This\napproach allows high rate (20 Mbps) communications\nby exploiting the mission\'s nuclear power source, and the presence of\nastronauts on the surface allows the construction of a relatively large antenna compared to what might be feasible on a Mars-\n\nnl\n\norbiting spacecraft. In addition, unlike a satellite system, the ground-based\nsystem can be maintained or repaired by astronauts\nif necessary. This high rate ground system, however, provides communications\nfor less than half of the Martian day because\nof line-of-sight\n\nobstructions.\n\nThe other key elements of the communications\nplan are a pair of areostationary\nsatellites. These satellites provide a moderate\nrate (I00 kbps each) X-band link between Mars and Earth, and also provide a communications\nrelay between astronauts at the\nsurface base station and those on long-term on exploration expeditions. The use of two areostationary\nsatellites provides\nredundancy\nin case of failure. Other backup options were considered, such as the use of surface relay stations,\nstations would be complex, time consuming to assemble, and difficult to power and maintain.\n\nbut such\n--,\n\nBy separating the satellites 19 degrees or more, we can maintain constant contact with Earth (a single satellite would\nexperience daily communication\nlosses of up to 71 minutes per sol due to eclipses when Mars blocks the line-of-sight\nbetween the satellite and Earth). The satellites Could also provide aerial photographs\nwhich could provide advance warning of\ndust storms.\n\nLaunching\n\nthe satellites\n\nwell in advance of the crewed\n\nmission\n\nwould\n\nprovide\n\na communication\n\n_,\n"\n\n__\n\nlink for\n\npreceding robotic missions. Because the satellites are supporting modest data rates compared to the surface-based\nKa-band\nthe satellites can be powered using solar arrays, avoiding the political objections to additional launches of nuclear power\n\nlink,\nmr\n\nsources.\ni\n\nwg\n\nm\n\n!\n\n_\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\n187\n\nF--\n\nPlanetary geometry has significant impact on communications\nbetween Mars and Earth. If the data rate is adjusted to maintain\na constant bit-error probability, then the sustainable bit rate varies by approximately\na factor of 20 over the mission duration.\nIn addition, communication\nis disrupted for a brief period from solar scintillation effects when the Sun-Earth-Mars\nangle\nbecomes sufficiently small. Providing a reliable link during such events might be accomplished\nby the use of an additional\nsatellite in Solar orbit at about 1 AU (perhaps at the Earth-Sun libration point) which would provide a communications\npath\n_----,\n\nthat didn\'t require a small Sun-Earth-Mars\nangle. This solution is deemed unjustifiably\nexpensive.\nUnder any communications\nscenario, the value of the Earth-Mars link is significantly\naugmented by exploiting data\ncompression\nand buffering. For example, such technologies\ncould allow daily transmission\nof brief high-definition\ntelevision\n(HDTV) clips which could significantly\nincrease public involvement.\nFurther development\nof optical communications\ntechnology\ncould also significantly\nenhance data return from a human mission to Mars, and provide mass and power savings\n.[Hemmati97,\nHall90]. We have not selected such a system as our baseline because, while the development\nof optical deep\nspace optical\n\nm\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 available\n4.7\n\nlinks would significantly\n\nenhance the mission,\n\ncommunications\n\nneeds could be supported\n\nwith currently\n\ntechnology.\n\nPower\n\nSystem\n\nAn initial source\n\nof large-scale\n\npower for the base camp will come from the same power\n\nsource\n\nused to fuel the ISRU\n\nE\n\nII\n\nw\n\nlil\n\nproduction of methane and oxygen for the Earth Return Vehicle. A 4 ton, 100kW nuclear reactor manufactured\non Earth can\nprovide a continuous source of power for 7 - 10 years which is more than enough power for the base operations of the first\nhuman mission. Although compact in size, this unit will require at least 12 tons of shielding in order to be medically safe for\nthe crew. The reactor will most likely be located away from the base camp, preferably in an ancient impact crater whose walls\nwould\n\nW\n\nprovide\n\nshielding.\n\nTransmission\nof electrical power will require the use of high voltage power lines buried at least one meter below the soil.\nPower can be distributed to batteries and electric motors that power the habitat, agricultural,\nand science modules. This will be\nthe beginning\n\nof a power infrastructure\n\nwhose electric distribution\n\nnetwork\n\ncan be expanded\n\nto meet the needs of a growing\n\nm\n\nbase camp.\n\n!\n\nSolar power arrays as a primary source of power for the base camp will be infeasible for the first mission since it would\nrequire approximately\n25,000 kg of material from Earth to manufacture\nsolar panels that are capable of providing the same\npower output as the reactor. Smaller solar arrays can be used for the generation of power at a much smaller scale that can be\nused for various sub-systems.\nOne consideration could be kinetic flywheels that whose electric motors are powered by solar\n\nw\n\nenergy. These 2-3m flywheels can then be used to generate electric power. This power source will not be considered as a\nsource of power for the mission, but can be a technology demonstration\nof future power systems that can be utilized on the\nsurface.\nThe reference mission also calls for the recycling of water from organic wastes. These same waste products also naturally\nrelease methane, which can be used as a source of fuel for space heating and cooking. The process, known as pyrolysis of\nbiomass, occurs when organic wastes are placed under high temperature and pressure to decompose\norganic material. During\ni_\n\nthis process,\n4.8\n\nseveral\n\nISRU/ISRP\n\ngases are released,\nTechnology\n\nincluding hydrogen,\n\nwhich can be used in fuel cells.\n\n& Application\n\nISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization)\nand ISRP (In-Situ Resource Processing) are two very important concepts to be used to\nmake human presence on Mars possible. The concept would be to take a raw resource,\nsuch as the atmosphere\nor soil, and\nthen using a sequence of processes, create useful commodities\nsuch as Oxygen from the atmosphere\nor Iron from the soil. In\ngeneral, there is a_eement\nthat ISRU can significantly reduce the cost of exploration, especially\nfor extended duration\nmissions.\nIf the concept ISRU is applied as part of the initial mission design for a human Mars mission, it will provide\nsubstantial mass savings and reduce mission risk because the amount of consumables\nthat will need to be taken. This will in\nturn, have considerable\nimpact on the overall mission size. The ability to automate the production\nof propellant,\nconsumables\nand other materials from available resources from Mars will allow a higher level of mission feasibility and\nreliability.\nFor example, the overall mission robustness of certain surface systems would be increased.\nThis would be\nbecause caches of consumables,\nsuch as surface vehicle fuels, and Mars Accent Vehicle fuels can be maintained and kept at\npeak levels.\n\n188LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nI\nThe sources for ISRU on Mars will come from two primary sources, the Martian atmosphere\nand soil. The atmosphere of\nMars is much thinner than that of Earth, with a surface pressure averaging lll00th\nthat at the surface of the Earth. Surface\ntemperatures\nrange from -133\xc2\xb0C at the winter pole to 23 \xc2\xb0 C on the dayside during summer.\nThe soil and atmosphere\ncomposition\nis shown in the following chart and table and is only based upon previous Mars Mission data.\nMars atmospheric\ncomposition\n(%): (CO2) Carbon Dioxide, 95.32; (N2) Nitrogen, 2.7; (Ar) Argon, 1.6; (O2) Oxygen, 0.13;\n(CO) Carbon Monoxide, 0.08; (H20) Water, 0.0325; (NO) Nitrogen Oxide, 0.1547; (Ne) Neon,\n0.00039; (Kr) Krypton,\n0.0000464;\n(Xe) Xenon, 0.0000124.\n\n"\n\nFuture missions and exploration\nwill expand this list of resources, and could provide even more options for future mission\nplanning.\nOne such option would be the significant presence of water that could be easily obtained and utilized. This\nresource would be the most valuable to any type of human presence.\nUntil such future resources are determined and verified,\nmining and then processing the Martian atmosphere\nand soil for known substances,\nwill provide several key materials for\nManned mission success. Future mining and processing of the surface materials listed here will require equipment,\nwhich\nwill probably not be included in early Mars missions.\nWith processing "Air mining" could yield Water, Oxygen, Nitrogen,\nCarbon Monoxlde, Methane, and Ammonia, wh-ile \'+Surface mining" could yield Water, Sulfur, Iron, Titanium, Aluminum,\nmagnesium,\nceramics, glass, and other building materials\nFor the first series of Manned Mars Missions,\nmanufacturing\nwill be Oxygen and propellant\n\nt\n\nIw\n,\n\n=\nm\n\nthe primary needs from ISRU will be the manufacture\nof consumables.\nSuch\nin the form of Methane (CH4). Other important resources that can be extracted\n\n-L\n\'ll\n\nfrom the Mars atmosphere are buffer gases. Nitrogen and Argon make up a significant\nvolume percent of the Martian\natmosphere.\nWhen they are separated from the predominantly\ncarbon dioxide atmosphere,\nthese gases have a variety of\napplications\nranging from their use as carrier and sweep gases for scientific instruments to buffer gas for human life support.\nOther applications\ninclude using compressed\ngases to deploy inflatable structures and drive pneumatic tools. Such tooling\ncould be designed\nuse techniques.\n\nto be powered\n\nby several\n\ndifferent\n\nmodes of power\n\ninput (electric,\n\ncombustion,\n\nor gas pressure)\n\nusing dualg\n\nThe process for the production of Oxygen and propellant will make use of the chemical processes as shown in the figure. The\nproduction of Oxygen will either be by the electrolysis\nof Water, or the extraction from the Martian atmosphere\nusing a Solid\nOxide Electrolysis\nCell, which involves the direct dissociation\nof carbon di oxide into Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen gas.\nThe other, known as "Sabatier-Electrolysis",\nby combining hydrogen with Martian carbon dioxide in the presence of a nickel\nor ruthenium catalyst yields methane and water. The methane is stored and the water electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and\noxygen. The oxygen is stored, and the hydrogen reacted with Martian carbon dioxide to produce more methane and water.\nThere are also several other approaches and that could be used to create a form of a Martian produced energy economy. Each\napproach has it\'s own advantages and disadvantages.\nCurrently the Solid Oxide Electrolysis\nCell technology has been a\nproven process on Earth, and at this time it is currently going to be flown and tested on the Mars 2001 lander.\nMethane/Oxygen\nCombustion has abouiS0 percent of hydrogen/oxygen\'s\nspecific impu|se, yet it is easier to store than\nhydrogen.\nThus it is a more attractive choice for the Mars Ascent Vehicle fuel since the long time period that will be spent\non the Martian surface. Another process to make Water and Carbon Monoxide is from a reverse water gas shift process as\nwell as an output from the Solid Oxide Electrolysis.\nThe Carbon Monoxide that is processed in these reactions could also be\nused as a fuel, but since it has low specific-impulse\n(30 percent of hydrogen/oxygen)\nand high burning temperatures,\nit would\n\nIm\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbe better suited for other operations such as in ground and surface equipment than rocket engine propellant.\nA potential\nsystem to make use of all of these systems in a reaction would be as shown in the figure to the figure to the right. Oxygen\nwould be produced by this system along with Carbon Monoxide.\nOther types of ISRU methods that could be used on the first\nhuman Mars missions would involve a more low tech approach.\nThey would entail using the Martian soil for construction\npurposes.\n\nThe manufacture\n\n0fbricks\n\nor Other building\n\nconstruction\n\nmaterials\n\nas described\n\nin an earlier section.\n\n__\nn\nU\n\n4.9\n\nSystem\n\nand\n\nEquipment\n\nReuse\n\nMuch of the systems and equipment mass that has been used on previous Manned Missions (Apollo), and much of the same\ng\nmass represented\nin the designs of future projected human Mars missions all have used a similar design approach.\nThis\napproach has the systems equipment only performing\none function and then becoming inert mass with only a limited role as a\nstructural function.\nFor instance using an Apollo example, the LM had a decent engine, stage hardware, system equipment\n\nI\n\n.\n\n!\n\nSecondHEDS-UPForum\n\nand structure.\nit performed\n\nOn this mission\nthat function\n\nit was only used once for the primary\n\nit became just inert structure,\n\nfunction\n\nonly providing\n\nof landing\n\na base or platform\n\nsafely on the Lunar\n\nsurface.\n\nfor the return launch\n\n189\n\nAfter\n\nand some of\n\nthe surface operations.\nThe current philosophy is to approach a human Mars mission in the same manner.\nThe design\nphilosophy\nhas expanded somewhat by trying to make use of ISRU techniques for the production of propellants\nand\nconsumables,\nbut with equipment and mass that we bring to the surface we are still using the previous philosophy.\nThis\ngives us a tremendous\nopportunity.\nWith the ISRU philosophy\nwe are trying to make some changes in the design to obtain\nmission advantages and benefits by using some very raw materials that we hope to find there. However, we seem to not\nconsider much of the "\'resources" that we have brought to the surface with us and then are not using after their one time use.\n\nt_\n\nIf we used the same type of creative design methods and philosophy as we do for ISRU and apply it to the design of our own\nequipment.\nLets call this philosophy DRU (Design Resource Utilization).\nIf we applied DRU, to the design of for instance\n\' \' the same typeofexample\nas the Apollo mission.\nThe LM could possibly have used the same stage to land and then take off\nagain after shedding some of the landing structure. This would have been a mass savings of a considerable\nmargin, especially\n__ if you backtrack it all the way back the initial launch. There would have been some trade-offs that would have to be\nconsidered\nbut it would have been an option. More options would have been with for instance with structural components\non\nthe LM. They were only used once for the landing and then had little secondary use. IfDRU was applied you could come up\nwith a number of design scenarios.\nSuch as if you designed a structural member on the leg of the LM to then be used for a\nstructural member on the lunar rover giving it a second life. This would have r_duced the mass that you would have had to\n\nI\n\nbring as primary equipment.\nAnother example would be to use part of the footpad, if it was designed with this in mind, to\ndetach and then connect to a structural member from another part of the vehicle, and thus creating a shovel, one of the most\nbasic of tools. This number of feasible dual-use designs is significant, and is a function of time of construction.\nThe Apollo\n!\n\ntype mission is limited, because of the time scales involved.\nBut for a human Mars mission, with a much longer duration\ntime, the complexity\nof systems and number of potential dual-use systems would be enormous an only limited by our\ncreativity.\nSuch designs could also be applied to secondary or back up systems, increasing mission safety and reducing risk.\nThe type and number of systems that could be devised, and the potential\nit would be a favorable to apply DRU techniques for the future planning\n\nB\n\n4.10\n\nAstronaut\n\nSurface\n\nMobility\n\nbenefits in safety, mass savings, mission\nof Mars and other human missions.\n\nreliability,\n\nSystems\n\nm\n\nR\n\nThe objective of the Astronaut Surface Mobility System (ASMS) is to provide transportation\nof one or two space suited\nastronauts (one pilot and one passenger) within short range (5 km radius of operation) from base camp or main rover in a\n\nm\n\nshort and effective\n\nm\n\nmanner.\n\nThe system will be simple, lightweight,\n\nand quite frugal in power\n\nBecause\n\nthe\n\nastronauts\nwill spend only a short period of time to conduct a mission within this short range, the system will be totally\nunpressurized.\nIn this short mission duration, the EVA spacesuits will be expected to handle all of the hazards of the Mars\nenvironment.\nThe following are the candidates for ASMS:\n1. Mars Stilts - Due to rough and dusty terrain on Mars, it may prove difficult\n\nE\n\nconsumption.\n\nfor astronauts\n\nto walk around\n\nand conduct\n\ngeological exploration\nin certain interesting regions. The lightweight, collapsible,\ntelescopic stilts that operate using\ncompressed\ngas will occupy only a very small footprint on the surface. They may be carried along with the geology backpack\nkit and deployed as neededl On difficult terrain, it may be possible for the astronaut to take much larger strides wearing this\nsystem (and hence cover larger exploration areas) and because astronauts will be at a higher elevation from the surface, they\ncould also appreciate the surface topography from a better vantage point.\n2.Jet Pack - The acceleration\ndue to gravity on Mars\'s surface is about 40% of that on Earth.\n\nA jet pack with a simple,\n\ncold\n\ngas pressure vessel gas tank will provide a good lifting force on Mars. Astronauts will be able to travel relatively fast in an\nemergency situation. The gas tank can be re-pressurized at the base camp or main rover with the abundant CO2 from Mars\'s\natmosphere\n\nm_\nF\nm\n\n(See Fig. 2).\n\n190LPI\n\nContribution No. 979\n\nm\n\n/\n\nFigure21\n\n3. Hang Glider - Astronauts\nwhile before approaching\n\nSurface\n\nMobility\n\nConcepts\n\ncould ride the hang glider after they are lifted up by the jet pack. They will remain in the air for a\nsurface again and then they can re-fire the jet pack to lift themselves\nto the air again. However, since\n\nthe atmospheric density is only one hundredth that of Earth\'s at sea level, very large wingspans/surface\nareas that need to be\neffectively deployed during this mission still need more investigation.\n4. Blimp - An aerodynamically\nshaped blimp with large aspect ratio and a small engine could fly an astronaut pretty fast with\nlittle fuel. The blimp could be equipped with solar arrays to generate some power. The engine could be a regular\ngasoline/methane\nengine with Oxygen/CO2.\nThe Methane could be from in situ resource utilization. The radiation heat\ngenerated during operation will keep the engine warm enough to operate and the water by product could be collected and used.\n5. Hot Air Balloon - The hot air balloon could be easily deployed by heating up the gas in Mars atmosphere.\nIt could attach\nsolar arrays and turbines, which run by solar power to help generate lift and thrust.\n6. Cable Cars - The temporary cable car could be use to transport astronauts just like at the ski resort. It could run by man\npower or solar power. This system could transport crew and cargo between chasms, gorges and large gullies that are hard to\nget across using conventional\nmeans.\n7. Parachute - In Mars canyon surveying, particularly in the shallow sloped hills, Astronauts could use controlled\nparachutes/parafoils\nto speed down hill with their feet only 2-3 feet above the surface.\nthey will be able to control their movement\nin the air.\n8. Ski - In some parts of Mars canyon and surface,\n\nthe soil may be mainly\n\ncomposed\n\nThe parachute\n\nof sand and dust accumulation\n\nRover - Due to the rough terrain on Mars, four wheeled\n\nvehicles\n\nwould experience\n\nit would be difficult to maneuver through the rocky terrain. A two wheeled rover or motorcycle\nover this kind of terrain and h01d its track to the smoother surface (See Fig. 2).\n\n--\n\nwill slow them down and\ndue to the\n\nvigorous aeolic activity presenting a very smooth topography\nakin to sand dunes and quick sand pits. Astronauts could use\nskis and graviiy to move around in this environment.\n9. Small Helicopter/Gyrocopter\n- A small, lightweight helicopter/gyrocopter\nwith counter-rotating\nturbines to diminish\nresidual angular momentum, small engine, and open structu_re could be an alternative to the blimp. These piloted vehicles\ncould hover over areas of interest and fly in and out of tight spaces such as would be encountered\nin canyon and valley floor\nexploration.\n10.Two Wheeled\n\n___\nb\n\na lot of vibration\n\ncould easily\n\nmaneuver\n\n_\n\n__\n\nbecause\nitself\n\ni\n\nI\n\n_\n\nSecond\n\n5.\n\nE-I\n\n5.1\n\nThe\nIt::= _\n\nThe\n\nVery\n\nLong\n\nSites\n\nLanding\n\nlanding\n\nsite\n\ninteresting\n\nChasma\n\nregion,\n\nfulfilled\n\nare defined\n\nlaboratory\nareas\n\nand a drilling\n\n,l=:::::r\n\naround\n\nfrom\n\nPlains\n\nthan\n\n(See\n\nlong\n\nareas\n\n(NP),\n\nLava\n\nrange\n\napproaches\n\nFlow\n\nfrom\n\nto be able\n\n150 days,\n\nover\n\ntraverses\n\nof more\n\na separate\n\nworkshop\n\nanalyses,\n\nduring\n\norbiting\n\nits planned\n\ncargo\n\nbus,\n\n3-5 day\n\nthe tall\n\nThe\n\nlanding\n\nvolcanoes\n\nreach\n\nChannel\n\nTerrain\n\nis to\nsite\n\nof the Tharsis\n\n(CT).\n\n(VLTV)\n\nconcept\n\nto operate\nthan\n\n5000\n\narea\n\nincluding\n\nof this\n\n(See\n\nFig.\n\nindependently\nkm.

On Earth, the amount of research dollars pouring into alternative\nfuels\ntechnology for transportation\nis being driven by the onslaught of deregulation\nin the natural gas and electric industry. State\npoliticians wishing to provide alternative electricity suppliers with a fair chance in the new competitive\nUS energy market\n:while addressing the needs of environmental lobbyists are encouraging the advancement of green power generating\ntechnologies\nthrough legislation and government subsidies. For example, California State Senate Bill 90, enacted on October\n12, 1997 placed the $540 million of the renewable energies program, the aim of which is to subsidize the cost of alternative\nfuel research. Advances in natural gas (methane) and hydrogen fuel cells for vehicle transportation\nare offering viable\nalternatives\nto enable surface mobility of crewed vehicles on Mars.\n\n= =:\n\n5.2.2\n\nMethane\n\nCombustion\n\non Mars\n\nThe current reference mission calls for the on-site production of methane and oxygen to fuel the Earth Return Vehicle. Six\ntons of liquid hydrogen brought from Earth will react with the carbon dioxide rich atmosphere of Mars to produce water and\nmethane (methanation).\nElectrolysis will strip the hydrogen atoms from the water molecules to be re-used in the chemical\nprocess. The result in 10 months of production will be 108 tons of methane-oxygen\npropellant.\nAssuming that the ERV will\nrequire 96 tons for the trip back home, this leaves 12 tons for the VLTV [Exploration99,\np. 47].\nThe VLTV\'s primary power source will be two 6.8L dedicated methane engines, one operational\nand the other standby (See\nFig. 6). An internal combustion of 10% methane, 70% oxygen, and 20% carbon dioxide (replaces nitrogen as expander gas in\nEarth-based combustion\nengines) will provide 225 lip (168 kW) of power per unit. A turbocharger\nwill be needed to compress\n\ni\n\nthe Martian atmosphere\nprior to induction into the engine cylinders given that the outside atmospheric\npressure is only 1%\nthat of Earth. Assuming the VLTV travels an average speed of 24 km/hr, this engine will consume approximately\n.37 kg of\nmethane/oxygen\nfuel for every kilometer traveled. Given that one liter of methane/oxygen\nfuel weighs .95 kg and the engine\nis able to push the VLTV 2.55 km per liter of fuel consumed, a 4800 km trip will require approximately\ntwo tons of fuel.\nLiquid methane and oxygen produced by the ISRU plant can be transferred to storage tanks on-board the VLTV. The fuel\nstorage capacity with 6 methane tanks and two oxygen tanks can give the VLTV a range (before refueling) of 1800 km. The\nfollowing drawing shows the VLTV chassis with the engine and storage tank configuration.\n5.2.3\n\nRegenerative\n\nSince the methane\n\nHydrogen\n\nengine\n\nwill provide\n\nFuel\n\nCeils\n\nand\n\nElectric\n\nelectric power through\n\nMotors\n\na belt driven alternator\n\nwhen the VLTV\n\nis in transit,\n\nthe need\n\nfor power arises during the times when the VLTV is at rest. Also, a back up propulsion system will be needed in the event of\nengine failure. An alkali cell, fueled by 50 kg of liquid methane can provide 70 kW of power at 70% efficiency.\nTwo of these\npower plants with a combined weight of 544 kg would provide sufficient electric generating capability\nto run independent AC\nmotors on each of the wheels, enough power would remain for on-board VLTV systems. The alkali ceil also produces water\nvapor as part of the reaction, which can either be condensed for crew consumption or stripped of hydrogen to be used in the\ncell (remaining oxygen to be pumped into the oxygen tanks).\n\n:\n\nOne major drawback of this technology is that the potassium hydroxide electrolyte reacts with carbon dioxide to form\npotassium carbonate, which not only gradually degrades the electrolyte, but also precipitates\nout and clogs up the pores of the\nelectrodes. Since carbon dioxide is abundant in Mars\'s atmosphere, this is a major problem, though one European company\n(Zevco) claims to have overcome this limitation, and is producing alkali fuel cells for vehicles on Earth [Fuel00].\nIf this\ntechnical problem has already been solved today, given the rapid advances in fuel cell technology,\nthe alkali cell will be a\npractical power source in five years time.\n5.2.4\n\nlm\n\nRisks/Benefits\n\nMethane combustion\n\nof Methane\nengines\n\nTechnology\n\nfor Mars\n\nand fuel cells provide an:efficient,\n\nExploration\n\ncost-effective\n\nsource of power.\n\nThe health concerns\n\nof the\n\npower systems are non-existent when compared to nuclear power as an alternative to powering a mobile system. Methane\ncombustion\nengines have been tested and are currently in use in Arctic environments\nwhose operating conditions differ from\nthat of Mars only slightly. Theseengines\ncan be tested in a vacuum chamber simulating the atmospheric pressure of Mars in\norder to verify the feasibility of this power source.\n\n196LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\n,,.\n\nAny vehicle powered by internal combustion will contain numerous moving parts. Lubricants and other fluids will need to be\ndeveloped that can be effective on the Mars surface environment.\nSpare parts such as hoses, filters, and drive belts will have to\nbe brought along also. The power systems presented here are also entirely dependent on the success of ISRU methane/oxygen\nproduction,\nas is the successful return to Earth. Given 5 years of further research, the size, weight, and power output of\nmethane combustion\nengines and fuel cells will be more than sufficient to meet the power needs of any mobile mission\narchitecture for the surface exploration of Mars.\n\nm\n\n,.,\n\nJ\n5.3\n\nScience\n\nOn\n\nMars\n\nDoes Mars have the necessary geophysical,\nambition to settle there?

This tether has built in nanotechnoIogy\nsensors that can detect and monitor\nvariables including pressure, temperature, wind direction and speed, moisture, vibration, magnetic measurements,\ndust, and\nSolar radiation.\nThese nanotechnology\n\nsensors\n\nconnected\n\nto a fiber optic data cable are integrated\n\nwith the tether. The tether system may be\n\ndeployed by a spacecraft lander on the top of a volcano, or by using a tow missile from the surface. Once deployed, the\nsensors will relay data to the lander/tow missile launcher. From there the data may be transmitted\nto a Mars orbiting satellite.\nOver a period of several\n\nyears, it might be possible\n\n-_.._\n\nto build up a model of the Mars atmospheric\n\nprofile.\n\nJ\n\ne\n\nII\n5.4\n\nMars\n\nDrilling\n\nOperations\n=\n\nThe Mars Deep Driller. (See Fig 7) is a drilling system that will initially reach depths of 100 meters using an air dust\ndrilling method (schematic shown below). With this method, compressed\nair (COz) will travel down the shaft of the drill rod,\nblowing the dust and debris out of the weiibore. The compressed\nair also Serves as a lubricant. Most types of Terrestrial deep\ndrilling systems\n\nuse water saturated\n\nmud as!ubricant\n\ninstead.\n\n..........\n\nThe deep drill system consists of compressor\ncomponents\nand drill components.\nThe proposed Compressor\nsystem has the\nfollowing specifications:\n2500 CFM (cubic feet per minute) average while filling, 2500 cm 3 tank capable of holding liquid\nCO2, valves will release gaseous CO2 at 100 CFMI heaters tokeep tank/valves\nabove -60 \xc2\xb0 F, and a 30 HP (22.4 kW) pump.\nThe drill system can be characterized\nas follows.

Mass excluding drill rods for the system is t 300\nkg, and the mass of the required liquid COz 150 kg. The system is capable of drilling to depths of 3 km.\n\nr_\n\n_ SUl_,Ine\n\nE\'lrll\n\nl\n\n-&\n\nrT\n\nL_\n\nIFI\n\nm\n\n--\n\ni\n\nFigure\n\n_l_\n\nw\n\n_1\'.4"- w,_,_\n\ns,o,,,\xc2\xae\n\nltltl\n\nii_;5;\n\n7: The Mars Deep Driller\n\nSince the probing depth of the Deep Driller will only be 100 meters for the first roving mission, the best spots to drill will\nbe at the low lying terrains for finding water or ice. The bottom of any river channel such as the bottom of Valles Marineris,\nor any dried up lake bed will be a prime spot. However, it will also be useful to drill to smaller depths of only 10 meters\nalong the route to map out the characteristics\nof the soil over the entire general regions. Using software to monitor and record\nthe composition\nof the dust in the various areas will aid further in determining\nthe best possible sites to drill.\nThe Deep Driller is mounted on a 4-wheeled\nVLTV, or at various sites around the habitat\n\ntrailer for maximum\narea.\n\nportability.\n\nThe drill can be used in conjunction\n\nwith the\n\nw\n!\n\n=\n\nw\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Deep Driller will have its trailer connected to the VLTV for towing along the route. Wlaen the VLTV has stopped at a\ndrilling site, the drill can be automatically\ndisconnected\nfrom the VLTV (except for the power and data cables) and guided to a\ndrill spot at maximum 500 feet away. There will be a connecting\npower/data line to the drill to perform the initial set-up\nsequencel\n\nm\n\n11\n\n:\n\nB\nE\n\nThere are two different scenarios in which the Deep Driller will operate. The first is at the base camp. Before and after roving\nmissions, there will be ample time to perform drilling operations.\nThe second is along with the VLTV while exploring the\nsurface. When the VLTV begins its operation, the compressor\nwill also be running to fill the CO_ tank. Power is limited\nwith the Driller; therefore it will drill in bursts. Once there is enough CO_, a momentum\nwheel will power up to assist with\nthe torque required for drilling. Once the drill rig ts operating, EVA may be required to assist the robotics in adding the drill\nrods at which time core samples can also be gathered for analysis within the VLTV. All information will be recorded\nincluding the amount of ice and the mineral composition\nat the depth it was drilled. Drill rates of up to 12.5 meters per hour\nare achievable.\nThis is much better than most conventional\ndrill methods used currently on Earth.\n\ng\n\nContinuous\nB\n\nair drilling\n\ncan get to substantial\n\ndepths\n\nin a short period of time.\n\nThe limitation\n\nfor the first mission\n\nis the\n\nweight and volume of the drill rods. The thin air on the surface also requires more time to fill up the compressor.\nFuture\nmissions will continue to bring additional drill rods increasing probe depths to 3 km, depending on subsurface layer content.\nFor the first few missions, it will take about 30 days to pump enough CO_ to drill for 12 hrs (up to 150m). The Driller will\nbe working intermittently,\ntaking up to five days to deplete the 30-day supply. The system is electrically driven which works\nwell given the VLTV and base camp will be providing electricity.\nHowever it restricts the distance at which the Driller can\n\nE\n\n198 LPI Contribution No. 979\n\nbe from its electrical power source.

Therefore, the Emergency\nRescue System is an integral part\nThere are various alternatives to emergency or rescue operations, and each one of them\nand effects that we envision. Our Mission Plan focuses on the VLTV for terrain\n\nexploration.\nThis VLTV would cover long distances and any one traverse would take 150 days. On such long duration traverse\ncrew safety would be essential in the event that the VLTV systems fail. For such failures we have a rescue rover that would\nbe positioned\nat Base Camp and would set on the rescue mission when summoned.\nThis rover might take as long as 6 days\n\nI\n\nto get to the VLTV and depending on the type of emergency this may not always be a viable solution.\nAnother alternative\nis\nto have a "rocket hopper" which would be a sub orbital vehicle stationed at the base camp. The rocket would be loaded with\nthe necessary supplies to sustain the crew and then launched to the location of the VLTV. Landing would take place by\nparachute and the ISRU station would supply the fuel. This would be a one-time use vehicle and would provide immediate\nassistance to the stranded VLTV crew until the rescue team gets there.

As an onsite laboratory, there will be a requirement for\nfrequent access to and from the Martian surface. The concept of a suitport has been around for sometime.\nAhhough it has not been used in spacecraft prior to the presen_t .time, it is the most efficient means yet\ndevised to conserve precious atmospheric gases when astronauts exit and enter a space vehicle. The\nconcept involves a suit mounted on the exterior of a craft. The astronaut enters the posterior of the suit\nthrough a portal, which is then closed behind him/her. The suit then separates from the wall of the craft\nand minimal atmosphere is lost_ In :addition, the introduction of contaminants would be minimized by such\na system. This concept is illustrated in figure 5.3. This concept seems highly appropriate for the IHM as\nfrequent\n\nexcursions\n\nto the planet\n\nsurface\n\nare expected\n\nilw\n\nI1\n\nI\n\nto be the norm.\n\ng\n\nm\n\n[\n\n_/(\n\nIB\n\nU\nI\n\nt\ng\n\nFig. 5.4.\n\nSuitport\n\nconcept\nI\n\nCombining\nefficient.\nThe\n\nairlock,\n\nIn case\n\nthe suitport\nconcept\nwith\nFor routine\nuse, the airlock\nin general,\n\nwill\n\nof a decompression\n\npressurized\n\nwith\n\nno external\n\nserve\n\na standard\nairlock\ncreates\na system\nthat is both highly safe and highly\nwould remain\nunpressurized\nthroughout\nthe egress/ingress\nprocess.\n\nas a failsafe\n\nor catastrophic\nloss\n\nagainst\n\nfailure\n\nof atmosphere.\n\nmalfunctions\n\nof the suit/suitport,\nIn addition,\n\nof either\n\nthe port\n\nthe airlock\n\nthe airlock\n\nprovides\n\ncould\n\nseal or the suit itself.\nI\n\nbe rapidly\n\na storage\n\nfacility\n\nfor the\n\nm\n\niD\n\nSecond\n\nw\n\nHEDS-UP\n\nsuits that is protected from the damaging effects of the external environment.\nFinally, the airlock could be\npressurized\nfor routine or unexpected\nmaintenance\nof the suits and suitport as required.\n\nLJ\n\nCabin\n\nm\nw\n\nAir\nLock\n\nFig. 5.5.\n5.1.1.4\n\nm\nn\n\nAirlock\n\nand suitport combination.\n\nIHM DEPLOYMENT\n\nThe IHM will be deployed remotely from the exterior surface of the landing module, with a panel of the\nexterior surface of the landing craft forming the underside of the IHM. In its uninflated state, the IHM will\noccupy minimal volume on the trip from the Earth to the planet surface. Upon landing, the IHM will fold\ndown from the side of the landing craft, probably onto support legs that deploy on the underside of the\nIHM. The IHM will be contiguous with the internal cabin environment\nvia the airlock, and inflation will\noccur through the process of pressurizing\nthe IHM to normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nr_\nW\n\n[]\nm\n\nm\n\n5.1.1.5\n\nm\n\nM\n\nFigure 5.6.

A simplified control structure is described in Fig. 7.1. A program schedule of the truck\'s travel\nitinerary is fed into the vehicle\'s navigation computer.\nThese signals are amplified and sent to the truck\'s\nactuators such as the drive motors and steering mechanisms\nto provide the desired mobility to satisfy the\nvehicle\'s next position.

This section will instead concentrate\non ionizing radiation.\nIonizing radiation consists of highenergy particles that exert their deleterious effects by stripping electrons from matter through which they\npass. These particles possess energies on the order of tens to hundreds of MeV. Ionizing radiation poses\nsignificant dangers to a manned mission to the surface of Mars, and an understanding\nof these dangers is\nessential in the design of habitable structures.\nThis sectiofi will review what is currently known about the\nradiation risks of the Mars surface and what the implications\nwill be to personnel on the surface. Shielding\nconsiderations\nwill be reviewed, and recommendations\nmade for both design considerations\nand for further\nresearch into the problem.\nAn assessment is made as to the feasibility of shielding against the various\ncomponent radiations and what the mass and design implications\nare of attempting such shielding.\nNote: Measurement\nof radiation in SI is generally expressed in terms of grays (Gy) for absorbed dose and\nsieverts (Sv) for dose equivalents.\nDose equivalents\nare calculated by adjusting radiation dosages to better\ncompare for effects such as cancer.\nAbsorbed dose:\nI gray = 1Gy = i joule/kilo_am\nDose equivalent:\n\nB\n\n= 100 rads = 10000 ergs/gram\n\nI sievert = 1 Sv = 1 joule/kilogram\n\n= 100 rems = 10000 ergs/kilogram\n\n222LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\n8.1.1.1\n\nCOSMIC\n\nCosmic\n\nradiation,\n\notherwise\n\nN\n\nRADIAITION\nknown\n\nas Galactic\n\nCosmic\n\nRays (GCR),\n\nis radiation\n\nof galactic\n\norigin.\n\nComprised\nof ionized atomic particles ranging from hydrogen to heavier particles such as carbon (C) and\niron (Fe), these particles are extremely energetic on the order of tens to millions of electron volts. The\npenetration\nof these highly energized particles into the inner solar system is limited somewhat by the solar\nmagnetosphere.\nPenetration\nof these particles to the surface of the Earth is further limited by both the\nEarth\'s magnetosphere\nand by the Earth\'s atmosphere,\nresulting in the observation that cosmic rays of little\nserious concern to living organisms on this planet. On Mars, however, the reduced strength of that planet\'s\nmagnetic fields and the relative absence of an atmosphere\nresult in GCR flux that poses a risk to living\nsystems (Wilson, 1993). These risks are discussed below.\n8.1.1.2\n\nSOLAR\n\nby these high intensity\nHEALTH\n\nIII\n\nRADIATION\n\nSolar radiation, otherwise known as Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) is of solar origin, as the name suggests.\nSEP consist largely of ionized hydrogen nuclei (protons), and are of lower energy than GCR (1ETAW,\n1997). As is the case for GCR, SEPs are shield from Earth\'s surface by the Earth\'s magnetosphere\nand pose\nlittle risk to living organisms on Earth. under normal circumstances,\nSolar radiation poses little risk to\nastronauts either in space or (presumably)\non the Martian surface. Large bursts of SEP occur periodically\nwith sunspots and solar flares, and these bursts do pose a significant threat to living organisms.\nThese\nbursts can be enormous and do pose tremendous threat to all living organisms.\nOn Earth, the Van Allen\nRadiation Belts and the Earth\'s atmospfiereafford\nadequate pr0tection from these events. At the present\ntime, observed sunspot activity affords only several hours of advance warning of such events. The danger\nposed to astronauts by these infrequent SEP events is severe enough to necessitate consideration\nof\nshielding and mission timing in the planning of any piloted mission to Mars (Simonsen, 1993). Unless a\ncrew has access to a safe haven, or is able to return to their shielded home base in several hours, they would\nhave to rely upon adequate shielding capability in the design of their mobile craft. The specific risks posed\n\n8.1.1\n\nIll\n\nradiation\n\nbursts are discussed\n\nbelow.\n\nil\n\ni\n\n=\n\nu\n\n[]\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nThese two types of radiation, GCR and SEP will pose significant, though different, risks to human life on a\nmission to Mars. Mission design requires an appreciation\nof these risks, and solutions to this problem\nrequire consideration\nof shielding materials, mission timing, and an assessment of acceptable risk. A\ncomplete discussion of radiation concerns for deep space missions is beyond the scope of this report.\nThorough discussions\nof this problem can be found in the reference section of this. What follows is a brief\noverview of the problem faced by the design team.\nThe health implications\nfrom radiation exposure are divided into stochastic effects and deterministic\neffects. The main stochastic effect of importance\nis cancer, and exposure is calculated in terms of total\ndose and in terms of lifetime risk for developing cancer. Deterministic\neffects include prodromal response\n(radiation sickness), temporary\nsterility and optic lens opacity (Letaw, t997).\n\nm\n\nu\n\nGalactic\ninvolve\nmust be\nderived\n\ncosmic rays are of primary concern in stochastic effects. A two or three year mission to Mars will\na significant cumulative exposure to cosmic rays, and implications\nfor long term risk of cancer are\nconsidered.\nCurrent recommendations\nfor safe exposure to heavy particle radiation are largely\nfrom the nuclear industry.\nSuch recommendations\nare based on the somewhat arbitrary level of an\n\nacceptable\n\nrisk increase\n\nof 3 percent\n\nof a fatal cancer\n\nover the lifetime\n\nof an individual\n\n(Curtis,\n\n1998).\n\nSolar radiation, arriving as it does in large bursts, is of concern primarily for deterministic\neffects. The\nmost severe deterministic\neffect of radiation is death from acute radiation sickness. Health effects of acute\nradiation exposure are probabilistic\nin nature and vary somewhat from individual to individual.\nIn high\ndoses, radiation affects primarily rapidly dividing cells and symptoms result accordingly.\nIn human beings,\nthese cells are found largely in the bone marrow (the source of new blood and immune cells), the intestinal\nlinin_ the skin, and ocular lens.

During the period of solar maximum,\nGCR penetration to the inner solar system is minimal due to the improved protective\' influence of the of the\nsolar magnetosphere. Solar maximum occurs at the midpoint of the solar cycle, approximately between\nyears 4 and 9. Unfortunately, the occurrence of increased sunspot activity and therefore of SEP activity is\nalso increased at this time. This relationship is shown in figure 8.2.\nSolar Proton\nEvents\n\nGCR\n\nf\nI\n!\nm\ng\n\nm\ni\n\n.>_\n\nm\nm\n\n[z,,\n\nSEP\nm\n\nw\n\n\',oI_\n:l_n-_num\n\nSolar\nlVEr_rn_Q\'n\n\nm\n\nD\n\nI l-\'Year\n\nSolar\n\nCycle\n\nFig. 8.2 Timing of GCR and SEP with respect to solar cycle - note, fluxes are not comparable in\nu\n\nm\nm\ni\nD\n\nmagnitude.\n\nForum\n\n223\n\n224\n\nLPI Contribution No. 979\n\nm\nm\n\nIdeally, the design team should have knowledge of when in the solar cycle a mission to the planet surface\nwould be launched.\nIn the absence of such information,\nthe design must allow for the worst case scenarios\n\n[]\n\nfor both GCR and SEP exposure.\nI\n\n8.1.4 SHIELDING\nShielding presents a difficult problem, particularly because of the two types of radiation involved.\nIn\ngeneral, GCR is too energetic to shield against, whereas shielding against SEP events will be required\nperiodically.\nFurther complicating\nthe issue is the effect of nuclear spallation of GCR. Spallation is the\nprocess by which the heavy and highly charged cosmic rays impact the shielding materials, causing a\ncascade of less energetic but equally damaging atomic particles.\nCalculations\nby Letaw (1997) and others\ndemonstrate\nthat with materials such as aluminum, even 30 cm of solid shield does little to lessen the\ndamaging effect of GCR. Furthermore,\nsome theorists have demonstrated\nthat shielding with heavy\nelements such as metals actually produces an increase in radiation dosing. This would suggest that when\nnot protecting against the less energetic SEP radiation, astronauts would be best served by being minimally\nshielded from the background radiation of the Mars surface. An exception to this problem occurs with\nhydrogen\n\nshielding,\n\nas the atoms of hydrogen\n\nare unable\n\nto be broken down\n\ninto smaller\n\nI\n\nm\n\nparticles.\nM\n\n8.1.5 DESIGN\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough hydrogen is\nprecludes an effective\nby stored consumables\nof a shielded chamber\n\na safe shielding material to use against GCR, the sheer amount of hydrogen required\nshield on a mobile habitati-Such-is\nnot the Case for SEP, and the protection provided\nand the laboratory equipment should provide sufficient cover to allow construction\nfor the astronauts located on the bottom of the habitat module.\n\nII\n\nW\n(include\n8.2\n\nshielding\n\ncalculations\n\nLIFE SUPPORT\n\nfor maximum\n\nSEP dosing)\n\nSYSTEM\nI\n\nSince the design assuflaptions for the MSTS include a fully functioning home base, the generation and\nrecycling of life supportive materials is not a design requirement of this system. The IHM must include the\ncapacity to store oxygen, water, and food for the two crew members for periods up to four weeks, along\nwith a reserve in event of loss or unexpected delay in return to home base. CO2 scrubbing and\nenvironmental\ncontrol should be easily accomplished with systems similar to those devised for Skylab,\n\nl\n\nU\n\nSoyuz, Mir, Shuttle, and the International Space Station (ISS).\nl\n9.0\n\nWORK\n\nThe following\n\nREMAINING\nis a list of areas that represent\n\nincomplete\n\nanalysis\n\nby the design\n\nteam at the time of this\n\nm\n\ni\n\nreport.\ni)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n\nSizing and mass estimates.\nStress analysis of inflatable materials.\nPower requirements.\nSolutions for dust accumulation\nproblems.\nSuspension system desi__-=\n- ....\nTraction calculations in reduced gravity.\nExplore Transhab work for conversion to this project\n\n10.0\n\n....\n\nill\n"\n\n_!2221\n\n2_\n\n::..\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nl)\nHighly effective radiation shielding at a home base increases the safety margin for a poorly shielded\nexcursion on the planet\'s surface. Consideration\nshould be given to construction\nof a maximally\nshielded\nhome base (regolith protection, etc.) for two reasons: 1) A complete picture of the radiation risk does not\nyet exist on the Martian surface, and 2) Increased protection at a home base will compensate\nsomewhat for\nunexpected dosing either in transit to and from Mars or while on the Martian surface.\n\nii\n\nl\n\nSecond HEDS-UP\n\nE\n\n,=\n\nw\n\n3) Consideration\nshould be given to landing and expeditionary\nmission within a Martian canyon.\nAdvantages\nwould include a lowered dose of continual background\nradiation as a result of natural\nshielding, and the possibility of using the canyon wails as a safe haven in the event of a solar event.\n\nw\n\nREFERENCES\n\nH\n\n=\n\n2)\nConsideration\nshould be giving to launching a prolonged surface mission to the moon prior to a Mars\nmission. The general consensus from many sources is that the uncertainty\nof both the deep space radiation\nenvironment\nand the effect of that environment\non living organisms poses an unacceptable\nrisk to an\nastronaut crew. A lack of firm data on this subject also leads to extreme difficulty in the design of safe and\nadequately shielded mission components.\n\n.\n\nAnonymous,\n\nLunar\n\nRover\n\nNavigation\n\n1996 - System\n\nArchitecture\n\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/-lri/architecture.shtm]\n\nLast updated in Nov.\n\n1996\n\nCurtis, S.B., Vazquez, M.E., Wilson, J.W., Kim, M.Y., 1998, Cosmic Ray Hits in the Central Nervous\nSystem at Solar Maximum,\n32 na COSPAR Scientific Assembly, Nagoya, Japan, July 12-19, 1998\nChurchill,\nPublishing\nKim\n\nSuzanne E, Fundamentals\nof Space\nCompany, Malabar, Florida, 1997\n\nM.-H.,\n\nLocal\n\nJ.

LIFE SUPPORT\n\nREQUIREMENT\n\nHuman Consumption\nRequirements:\nThe daily needs for a human, based on an average metabolic rate of\n4898 calories per person per day are: oxygen, 0.84 kg; food solids, 0,62 kg, and water, 57.28 kg. The\neffluents per person per day are carbon dioxide, 1.00 kg; water, 291487 kg, and 0.109 kg. [ la]\nHuman\nNutrient\nRequirements:\nHuman Nutrient requirements\nwill be met by a combination\nof plant\ngrowth on Mars, and dietary supplements.\nThe crops were chosen to meet U.S. RDA (Recommended\nDaily\nAllowance)\nand NASA Space Requirements\nfor nutrition. The long-term\neffects on plant and human\nphysiology\nhave not been analyzed\nunder Martian gravitational\nconditions.\nDietary supplements\nallow\nNASA doctors to respond to potential physiological\nchanges in the crews due to the diet. [2]\nHuman Atmosphere\nRequirements:\nLife exists in a narrow range of atmospheric\noxygen and carbon\ndioxide pressure.\nAt sea level the partial pressure of oxygen is 21.21 kPa, and carbon dioxide partial\npressure is 0.0318 kPa. The minimum partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) Which a human can tolerate for\nextended periods is 19 kPa. Lower partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) can be tolerated for a short duration.\nHowever, there are side effects to lower pressure. Altitude sickness occurs after 8 to l0 hours of ppO2 at\n13.75 kPa. The maximum ppQ humans can withstand is 32.4 kPa, however lung irritation occurs after 12\nto 72 hours at this level. Humans can tolerate ppCOz levels as high as 1.01 kPa for short periods (several\ndays),\n\nand\n\nppCO2\n\nlevels\n\nof\n\n1.59\n\nkPa\n\nfor very\n\nshort\n\nperiods\n\nkPa can be tolerated\nfor long periods.

These\nvolumes\nare designed\nto meet the needs of a six-person\ncrew for two-year\nperiod\n(avg. 4898\ncal/person/day).\nThe starter solution will be given to the plants at the beginning of their growth. Plants will\ninitially\ntake up nutrients\nand Store them within their tissues. The nutrient\nconcentration\nwill drop\nsignificantly\nat this time. it is not necessary to add nutrients until the Vegetative _owth stage.

GREENHOUSE\n\nW\n\npercentages\npercentages\n\nARCHITECTURAL\n\nLAYOUT\n\nGeneral Approach:\nThe primary function of the Mars greenhouse structure is to provide an adequate\nenvironment\nto grow and process food. The structure should be pressurized,\nbe easily constructed,\nand be\neasily maintained.\nThe challenges\nthat need to be addressed are maximizing\nthe use of available\nspace,\nproviding\na simple, modular\nconstruction\nscheme,\nand providing\naccess for automated\nsystems.\nThe\nstructural layout is provided in figure 3-1.

Vertical configuration\nutilizes available\nv61ume\nbetter than the horizontal\nconfiguration.\nThe horizontal configuration\npresented hindrances\nto a modular\nshelving system because of the dimensional\nlayout of the structure. The floor area of each level in the\nvertical configuration\nis identical therefore simplifying\nthe use of a modular shelving system. In order to\nmeet a crop requirement\nof 600 square meters [ 1 a] five horizontal configurations\nwould be needed whereas\nthe vertical configuration\nwould fulfill this requirement\nwith four structures. The need to maximize plant\ngrowth area within a limited space makes the vertical configuration\nthe logical choice. As indicated in\nTable 3-1, the better solution would be to choose the vertical inflatable cylinder. A single vertical inflatable\ncylinder provides 544m _ of growth area. This would meet mission requirements.\nHowever, for the purposes\nof this study we used a baseline vertical rigid cylinder per the reference mission.\nl\n\n231\n\n232\n\nLPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nL\nmm\n\nTable 3-1 Greenhouse Dimensional Analysis\n\nIll\n\nOverall Dimensions\n(m)\nLength Of Cylinder\n(m)\nPlant Growth Capacity\n(m z) 0.5m / 0.75 m\nshelf spacing\n\n4.6\n\n4.6\n\n7.5\nm\n\n259 / 185\n\n205 / 143\n\n715 / 455\n\nTwo evolutionary phases are envisioned fofthffMars\ngreenhouse.

Figure 3-1 shows a single unit from the selected Phase I\nlayout based on the use of rigid cylinders.\nModular Shelf System: The vertical configuration uses a modular shelving system. The shelving systems\nconsist of lighting, air circulation, hydroponics and plant trays. As indicated in Figure 3-1, the modular\nshelving system is arranged into four concentric circular segments with plant trays that can be moved into\nthe elevator opening for harvesting, cleaning and reseeding.\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nFigure\n\n3-2:\n\nModular\n\nShelf\n\nSystem\n\n_-:n_,-_._\xc2\xa2_.\n\nPlant Tray\n\n_\'__/__._\'_)/\n\nstation during\n\nto Robot\n\nHabitat oute:_\n\nJ\n\noperation)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,_,\n\n\\\nView A - A\n\nRoller\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHydroponic Tray\n(fixed in place)\n\nm\nm\n!\nm\n\n!\n\ng\ntop\n\nView\n\nSpace Allocation: Four vertical structures are required to obtain 600 m 2 of gowth area. [la] Each crop\ngrowth level will accommodate 37 m 2 of crops. Two structures will contain five levels with 0.75 m of\nvertical spacing. The remaining two structures will contain six levels with 0.50 m of vertical spacing. Each\nstructure uses approximately 65% of the total 250 m 3 of volume for crop growth. The remaining 35% (87\nm3) is allocated for the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHydroponic fluid storage\nAutomated controls\nUseable plant material\nHarvesting Equipment\nAtmospheric Controls\n\nThe structure provides compact and efficient use of space while maintaining\nautomated and human operations.\n\nm\n\nIlI\n\nI\n\nm\n\nsufficient\n\nspace for both\nIJ\n\nSupport Overview: The exterior of the structure is an expended Mars cargo vessel. The framing will use a\ngraphite-reinforced epoxy-material [11]. The supports for the shelving can be fixed to the sides of the\nstructure before or after arriving on the Mars surface. Connections can be bolted pinned or welded as\nnecessary. A rigid support frame for the structures should be used. The support frame would be assembled\non the Martian surface. These frames will serve multiple purposes. First, the frame minimizes greenhouse\nheat loss by limiting direct contact with the Martian surface.

A second purpose\nfor the frames will be to maintain the greenhouse\nlevel. An auto-leveling\nsystem should be built into the\nframe. This is easily accomplished\nwith electronic\nsensing devices and adjustable\nsupports built into the\nframe itself.\nThe individual greenhouses\nwill be connected\ntogether by tubular tunnels with airlocks at each entrance.\nThese tunnels should be between two and three meters in diameter,\nallowing for equipment\naccessibility.\nThese connecting tunnels will also be used to house control systems,\nand harvesting\ndevices for the\ngreenhouses.\nInflatable\nTechnology:\nInflatable technology is currently under research for use on future NASA missions.\nAn inflatable structure will provide significantly\nmore space with only a minimal increase in dimensions.\nA\n9.5-meter diameter structure, similar to the current TransHab\nmodule,\nwould yield 570 cubic meters of\nvolume\n\n[13]. This is a huge benefit in payload\n\nsize and weight,\n\nwhich leads to an overall cost reduction.\n\nThe inflatable structure would use a similar support technology\nas the rigid structures. The frame could be\nstored in the "central structural core" removed,\nand setup prior to inflating the module [13]. This design\nrequires longer setup times than its rigid counter part. However,\nthe significant\nincrease in growth space\nprovides a more economical\nsystem than the rigid cylinders. Further research in this area should reveal this\nthe better option for plant growth.\nFig. 3-3: Structural\n\nCross-Section\n\n.=__\n\n4.

Maintaining\na suitable atmosphere\nrequires the regulation\nof oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gasses. A system that can generate oxygen on demand,\nfilter out carbon dioxide and replace or remove nitrogen is required. Oxygen and nitrogen separators are\ncommercially\navailable and are easy to integrate into an atmospheric control system.\n\nU\n=\n\nII\n\nW\n\nOxygen and the other atmospheric\ngasses will be lost to the Martian atmosphere through inevitable leakage\nat an assumed rate of 1% of the chamber volume each day. A self-sustained\nsystem minimizes the\nnecessity for transport from earth. This loss comes to 0.013 kg of oxygen, 0.0i 1 kg of carbon dioxide and\n0.011 kg of nitrogen each day. Replacement\noxygen can be provided from two sources. First, oxygen is a\nbyproduct of photosynthesis.\nPreviously,\nwe have determined\nthat 0.63 kg/day of oxygen can be obtained\nfrom 25 m 2 of plant area. If there are 300 m2 in production\nat any given time, then 7.56 kg of oxygen will\nbe produced each day. If the attendants collectively\nuse 5.04 kffday the greenhouse will experience a net\noxygen production\nof 2.51 kg/day. Excess gas can then be separated using a commercial separator and\nstored for future use. The second method of obtaining oxygen involves separating elemental oxygen from\n\nm\n\nbearing gasses in the Martian atmosphere.\nThe Mars Surveyor 2001 lander, scheduled for launch on April\n10, 2001, will demonstrate\nthe viability of an oxygen generation system.

Working in small teams, as part of a larger team, with common\ngoals requires\nan effective, reliable system of communication\namong the members and the individual\nteams. Ideally, this system should be in place before even the first design parameter is established. This\nreduces the number of redundant tasks being performed and ensures that everyone understands what is\nrequired\n\nof them.\n\nA constantly updated\n\ninteractive web site can assist in this communication.\n\n11. OUTREACH\n!\nm\nm\n\nm\nm\nm\n\nSeveral actions were taken to ensure exposure of MAGIC to the community at large, so that others may\nlearn from the challenges encountered during the project. Following\nthe conference\nat the Lunar and\nPlanetary Institute, a newsletter circulated at UTSA as well as the student newspaper will publish articles\nabout MAGIC. In addition, a local television station may cover the project. The posters that were\ndeveloped for the conference will be on display for high school students and parents during "Engineering\nWeek", hosted by engineering students at the university.\nFinally, the World Wide Web site, which was\ndeveloped for intercommunication\namong the MAGIC design teams, will become a permanent part of the\nUTSA division of engineering web site. This will allow material to be accessed and referenced\nby those\nworking on further aspects of the design, or on similar projects.\n12. CONCLUSION\nMAGIC addressed the prospect of developing a food production facility on Mars by implementing\na twophase, expanding approach. Each individual design challenge involved varying levels of trade off analyses,\nprojections,\nand assumptions.\nAs further information\nis gained on the nature of the Martian atmosphere,\nsoil, and climate - designs can be refined and finalized. Furthermore,\nadvances in gas production\nand water\nproduction technology, as well as advances in robotic autonomy, will improve the design of each individual\nsubsystem. Like the original pioneers of the American frontier, future astronauts will need to learn how to\n"live off the land" as they venture further away from home. MAGIC is the first bold step in that direction.\n\n245\n\n246LPI Contribution\n\nNo. 979\n\nREFERENCES\nL--\n\nla.\nlb.\n2.\n.\n\nReference Report\nMars Reference Mission.\n\nNASA.\n\nWhitney, Eleanor Noss, et al.

A pressurized rover seems fitted for the task.\nour team of nine students undertook the conceptual design ofsuch a rover, as a requirement\nfor a two-semester\ndesign class\nState University.\nAs additional challenges, the team decided to participate in the HEDSUP competition and build a I/8 th-\n\nscale model of the rover to use in an outreach\nI. 1\n\nprogram.\n\nMission\nThe MARtian\n\nVehicular\n\nINvestigator\'s\n\n(MARVIN\'s)\n\nmission\n\nwill be twofold.\n\nFirst, as an exploratory\n\nvehicle, it will be used\n\nto collect, photograph and analyze samples from the Martian surface. Secondly, it will provide the unique opportunity to study human\nbehavior in an unfamiliar and inhospitable environment.\nThis paper deals only with the exploratory\naspect of MARVIN\'s\nmission,\nMARVIN will carry a crew of two to three people over 1500 km, during a two-week mission.\nAt an average speed of 15 to 20 krn/h,\n\n....\nm\n\nthe crew will be driving approximately\n6 hours per day ....................\n_\nThe design of MARVIN was based on several assumptions.\nFirst, fuel was assumed to be readily available on Mars upon arrival of a\nmanned mission. This would be done by producing large amounts of oxygen, hydrogen, water, and other fuels such as methane in\nsitu. The in situ fuel production process will have started several years before the arrival of man on Mars. It was also assumed that\nthe infrastructures\nnecessary to partially assemble the rover would be available on Mars. In addition, no provisions were made for\ntransport to Mars except to assume that the rover could be delivered to the Martian surface in a nearly assembled state,\nThe MARVIN rover Project was undertaken strictly as a conceptual\nproject. No detailed design or analysis, nor a cost\n\nm\nw\n\nanalysis\n\nDesign\n\ni\n\nwas performed.\n\n1.2\n\nCriteria\n\nMost of the design criteria are dictated by the hostile nature of the Martian environment\nand by the autonomy required in a\nplace millions of kilometers away from home. Hence a Martian rover has to be rugged, lightweight,\nand have redundant systems.\nMars presents several unique design challenges.\nFirst, Mars\'s atmosphere\nis composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, which is\ntoxic to humans and renders all surface operations all the more difficult.\nAlso, very fine (=lmicron)\nsurface dust is carried about by\nsurface winds and has the potential to foul electronics,\nwindows, filters, and moving parts. Temperatures\non the surface vary widely\nbetween day and night and also vary widely over short vertical distances above the surface. These variations have the potential to\ncause material failures and necessitate careful material selection during design.\nTransporting\nthe rover from Earth to Mars also imposes its own constraints\non the design. The rover must be both compact and\nlightweight due to launch cost and volume limitations.\nTo meet the volume constraint, the rover was designed to be partially\nassembled on Mars. Advanced materials such as composites\nand titanium were used to satisfy the mass requirements.\nIn the following\n2\n\nPressure\n\n2.1\n\ni\n\nsections,\n\nour solutions\n\nto these unique constraints\n\nare presented\n\n-- = " "\nconsists\n\n__\n\nII\n\nDimensions\n\nThe rover structure\n\nU\n\nand explained.\n\nVessel Structure\n\nGeneral\n\n-_\n\nof a pressure\n\nvessel with a cylindrical\n\n_\nmid-section\n\nand two semi-spherical\n\nend-caps.\n\nThe\n\nj\n\ncylindrical mid-section has an outside diameter of 2.5 meters, the two semi-spherical\nend caps have an outside radius of 1.25 meters\neach, and the overall length of the vessel is 6 meters. The thickness of the walls is approximately\n3 cm. The rear end cap will be\npartitioned for use as an air lock, and the front-end cap will contain the cockpit and controls.\ndome windows on the top of the cylindrical section will aid in natural interior lighting.\n2.2\n\nPressure\n\nVessel Materials\n\nIn addition\n\nto a windshield\n\nin front,\n\nand Structure\nW\n\n2.2.1\n\nComposite Vessel Materials\nAdvanced composite materials are well suited for space structures due to their high strength and stiffness, light weight and\nlow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).

An automated\n\nstructure with a honeycomb\ncore. Filament winding\nfiber placement machine uses a mandrel similar to\n\nfilament winding, but will allow for a more detailed lay-up in complex areas such as those around the windows and at the bottom\ncradle attachment area.\nThe laminate will be symmetric about the mid-plane to avoid bending and twisting due to in-plane loads. Since Kevlar plies\nwill be used on the outside of the structure, the same Kevlar lay-up will also be used on the inside walls. In addition to creating\nsym/fietry, the inside Kevlar plies will separate the C_b0n plies from metal support brackets, which will prevent galvanic corrosion.\nComposite plies will exist in pairs of opposite orientation to avoid shear distortions due to normal loads. Since Kevlar is nonconductive, fine aluminum filaments will be woven in the outer fabric to dissipate electrostatic\nenergy generated by high winds.\nThese filaments, along with a metallic clear-coat,\nwill also serve to reflect ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to the\ndecomposition\nof Kevlar. The basic lay-up configuration\nof the pressure vessel is shown in Figure 2.1.\nm\n\nm\ni\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\n:\n\nm\nW\n\ni"\n\n=\n_\'_\n\n____\n\nFigure\n\n2.3\n\nloads.\n\n"_\nm\n\nW\n\nConfiguration\n\nBetween the carbon layers, a fiberglass reinforced phenolic honeycomb will be bonded to the carbon with film adhesive.\nThis material has excellent thermal stability and has been used from -423\xc2\xb0F up to 400\xc2\xb0F. The honeycomb increases the structure\'s\nrigidity, its ability to withstand bending and shear loads, and has good strength to weight and stiffness to weight ratios. It provides\nacoustic absorption, radio frequency shielding, and it is an extremely effective mechanical energy absorber.\nThe faces of a sandwich\npanel act similarly to the flanges of an I-beam by taking the bending loads. The core corresponds\nto the web, resisting the shear loads\nand increasing the stiffness of the structure.\nUnlike the I-beam\'s web, it gives continuous support to the facings. The adhesive joins\nthe components and allows them to act as one unit with high torsional rigidity.\nThe honeycomb at the lower portion of the vessel will be filled with potting compound to distribute localized loads. This\ntype of compound has a typical density of 0.189 g/in 3 and a compressive\nstrength of 17 ksi. Since the average surface temperature on\nthe Martian surface is -65\xc2\xb0C, the remainder of the honeycomb\nwill be filled as necessary to aid in internal thermal equilibrium to\nmaintain a "shirt sleeve" environment.\nPolyethylene\nis chosen to fill the core since it also pi\'ovides radiation protection.\nIt also will\naid in core stabilizationistiffening\nand core crush reinforcement.\n_ .....\n\n_\'\n\n_1\n\n2.1: Lay-up\n\nLay-up\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe pressure vessel will need to be able to contain the pressure differential\nand to withstand the stresses due to the internal\nThe ply-stacking\nconfiguration\nwill be designed to allow fibers orientated\nin the axial and hoop directions, as well as off axis\n\nlayers to provide some circumferential\nand torsional stiffness and to hold the load carrying\nThe critical stress resultant can be calculated using a form of Hooke\'s Law:\nNxx = Exx-Exx.n.tp\nwhere\nN_x= the critical stress resultant\nE_= the longitudinal\nmodulus\nE_= the allowable strain\nn = the number of plies\ntp= the thickness of each ply\n\nof the material\n\nlayers together.\n\n249\n\n250 LPI Contribution No. 979\n\nUsing a maximum strain allowable of 0.003 and a carbon unitape with a longitudinal\ntensile modulus of 18 Msi, 2.5 plies\nwith fibers in the hoop direction are necessary to withstand the hoop stress due to the pressure loads.\nAs a starting point, a factor of safety of 5 is applied. As a result there are 12 plies with fibers in the hoop direction, 6 plies in\nthe axial direction, and 4 plies are added off-axis to provide torsional stiffness.\nThe plies are arranged symmetrically\nwithout grouping\nthe same oriented plies. When plies of the same orientation are grouped together, there are higher interlaminar stresses.\nEight Kevlar\nplies are added for impact resistance.\nTable 2.1 shows the initial lay-up configuration.\nTable\nNumber\n\nof Plies\n\n2.1: Composite\nThickness\n\nLayup\n\nIIw\nOrientation\n\nper Ply (cm)\n\n4\n\n0.0254\n\nCarbon\n\n11\n\nHoneycomb\nCarbon\n\n11\n\n0.0127\n2.5\n0.0127\n0.0254\n\nKevlar\n\ncriteria,\n\nKevlar\nThe configuration\nwas put In a classical lamination\nall plies have a factor of safety of 7.4 to 11.5.\n\n2.4\n\nSequence\n\n0/+45/-45/90\n0/9010/+45/0/90/0/-45/0/90/0\n\nI\n\n1 layer\n0/90/0/-45/0/90/0/+45/0/90/0\n90/-45/+4510\n\nMass Calculations\n\nprogram\n\nI\n\nwith the pressure\n\nloads applied.\n\nUsing the Tsai-Wu\n\nfailure\n\nn\n\nUsing the dimensions\nof the pressure vessel and ply thicknesses of 0.0254\na honey comb thickness of 2.5 cm, the following mass table was generated.\n\ncm for the Kevlar,\n\n0.0127\n\nfor carbon\n\nunitape, and\n\nTable 2.2: Mass Calculations\nMaterial\n\nOuter Radius\n(cm)\n125.00\n124.90\n124.76\n122.26\n122.12\n..........\n\nKevlar\nCarbon\nHoneycomb\nCarbon\nKevlar\nTotal\n2.5\n\nRadiation\n\nShielding\n\nInner\n\nRadius\n(cm)\n124.90\n124.76\n122.26\n122.12\n122.02\n\nPanel\nThickness (cm)\n0.102\n0.140\n2.500\n0.140\n\nVolume\n(cm 3)\n47850\n65700\n1158000\n\nDensity\n\n46300\n\nMass\n\n(kg)\n\n1.33\n1.54\n0.048\n1.54\n\n63750\n\n0.102\n\n(g/cm _)\n\n,_\n\n63.64\n101.20\n55.60\n98.17\n\n1.33\n\n61.58\n380.19\n\nfor MARVIN\n\nStudies have shown that in order to achieve necessary radiation shielding for a maximum exposure of 20 mSv/year,\nO. 15cm\nof aluminum or 0.3-cm protection of Polyethylene\nis needed.

Therefore, during the 14day mission, the fuel cell will produce around 900 kg of water. About half of it will be used as potable supply. Some of it will be\nexhausted as water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and the rest, in liquid form, will be used as a coolant. Some of the vapor is\nreleased into the atmosphere and the rest goes through a condenser.\nThe resulting warm liquid water is used in a heat exchanger that\nregulates hydrogen and oxygen temperatures\nand in the humidifier.\nThe cold liquid water is then distributed between an electrolysis\ntank, the potable supply and the fuel cell cooling system. Water is produced by the fuel cell only as the rover is running.\nTherefore,\nthere will need to be an initial amount of water in MARVIN\'s\ntank upon departure for a new

According to previous data gathered on Mars\'s ionosphere,\nsuch a radio would operate at about 4 MHz during the\nday and 700 kHz at night. The latter figure is too low to transmit images or engage in other kinds of high data rate transmission,\nbut it\nis more than adequate for engineering telemetry or voice communication.\nIn addition to maintaining communication\nwith the home base, Mars\'s explorers will also need to navigate. While good maps\nof Mars are available from orbital imaging, the essential problem for a Mars rover crew will be deiermining\ntheir own location. A\nradio beacon at the base could help a crew find its way home, but its range would reach at most only to the nearby horizon (just 40\nkilometers away). Upon approaching\nthe limits of the base beacon\'s range, a departing rover crew could station a second beacon on a\nhilltop, and then another, and another, and another, to mark a return path. Such techniques are(however,\nquite limiting, and as in the\nstory about the bread-crumb\ntrail being eaten by birds, are subject to catastrophic\nfailure if one of the beacons composing the trail\nshould cease functioning.\nInertial navigation and the use of navigation\nsatellites are two other options\n+ +\nThe table shows the total weight for the different instruments\nandth_ seats in the cockpit.\n:\nTable 6.1: Total Weight\n\nu\n\nlighting\n\nTotal Mass (kg)\n30\n21\n\nM\n\n21\n48\n50\n100\n270\n\nand 1 kW for the external\n\nIll\n\nm\n\ncameras,\n\nwhich add\n\nup to 7kW.\n7\n\nInterior Living Quarters\nL--\n\n7.1\n\nMIS Units\n\nAdequate supplies must be carried on MARVIN\nwhile leaving storage space for scientific equipment.\nSince MARVIN\'s\nmission objectives will vary, cargo storage with modularity, accessibility\nand functionality\nis ideal. MIS (Multipurpose\nInterior\nStorage) Units have been developed to accommodate each of MARVIN\'s\nmissions. The MIS Units are capable of storing all the\nnecessary perishable and expendable items such as water, food, clothing as well as the food preparation\nequipment.\nAdditionally,\nthere is plenty of storage space available to carry scientific equipment.\nThe MIS units are located on both sides of the fuselage in the living quarters. (See Figure 7.1) The right MIS unit is 2.97\nmeters long and runs from the back of the cockpit to the front of the waste management system. The left (not shown} MiS Unit is\nidentical to the right MIS Unit except that it extends the full length of the living quarters, 2.97 meters, from the cockpit to the airlock\npressure bulkhead because of the absence of the Waste Management\nSystem (See Figure 7.1). Note the person standing inside is 1.83\nm, or six feet tall.\n\nn\n\nII\nH\nJ\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nII\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nSecond HEDS-UP Forum\n\n259\n\n2\n.\n_.===a\n\n6,000\n\n=L t_50\n\n8970\n\n---1.780\n\n======================================\n\nW\n\nI\n\nI\n--\n\nosoo\n4e--,-P-;.:<:ii::% 2soo\n\nI\n\n1,"\'=I.....\n:\nq. _, ,\n["\n1\n\n!\n\nt\n\nq\n\n_\n\nI=-==-+-----\n\n!\n\n-I\ni\n\nMa_\nW_ste\n_sys\n\nCoc_<pi_:\n\nAir[oc\n/\n\n/\n\nj---0,330\nmm\n\n[]\n\nFigure\n\n7.1: Front and Right\n\nSide Cross-section\n\nView of MARVIN\n\nIF\n\n7. I. 1\n\nPotable and Waste Water Storage\nThe fuel cells that power MARVIN will produce approximately\n900 kg of water on the two-week mission.\nThe 3-person\ncrew will use approximately\n420 kg of this water, based on a 10 kg per person per day. At any one time, enough potable water will be\nstored in MARVIN to safely bring the crew back to base should a problem arise. Upon return to the base, the majority of the water\nstored in the MIS Units would be wastewater. This water can then transferred to the base for reclamation\nof potable water.\n7.1.2\n\nB\n\nFire Suppression\nand Lighting\nThe top portion of the MIS Units is where the Fire Extinguishing\n\n(FE) and Interior\n\nLighting\n\n(IL) Systems\n\nare located..\n\nA\n\nHALON\xc2\xae or a FE-241(chlorotetrafluoroethane)\nFE system will be employed on MARVIN.\n....\nThe IL system will be used to light MARVIN in low light conditions such as a sandstorm or at dusk. Additionally,\nthe IL\nsystem will be capable of supporting MARVIN during nighttime missions by illuminating the cabin with red light. It is estimated that\nthis system will require about .25 kW of peak continuous power and. 10 kW of power at normal operating conditions.\n7.1.3\n\nm\nm\n\nl\n\nModular Storage Capabilities\nThe MIS units are designed to be very modular since MARVIN\'s\nmission will be likely different on each excursion.\nBoth\nthe left and the right MIS units are six drawers high, minus the bottom layer for water storage, with the inner four layers being\ncompletely\ninterchangeable.\nBecause of MARVIN\'s\ngeometry, the top and bottom drawer layers are not interchangeable\nand are used\nfor more permanent\nequipment such as food preparation equipment, the crew\'s personal items, etc .... A variety of drawer\ncombinations\ncan be used within these four inner layers. Each inner drawer is .330 meters wide, .250 meters high and .500 meters\ndeep. This gives each inner drawer approximately\nthe ones used on the Space Shuttle which employ\nMARVIN\n\nis approximately\n2 kg.\nHowever, it is conceivable\n\nthat different\n\n.041m 3 of storage space.\na Kevlar-Epoxy\nsandwich\nmissions\n\nwill require\n\nCurrently\nstructure.\n\ndifferent\n\neach drawer is fabricated in the same manner\nThe resultant empty mass each drawer on\n\nsize equipment\n\nand so one(I)\n\ndouble\n\nhigh drawer\n\nas\n\ncan\n\nreplace two(2) single high drawers or one(I) triple high drawer can replace three(3) single high drawers and so on. Electrical\nconnections\nare provided behind each of the MIS Units for providing power to the scientific, hygiene and food preparation\nequip3ment.\nThe overall storage capacity, minus water storage, of the left MIS Unit is ~2.16 m3 while the right MIS Unit is - 1.68 m and\nis slightly smaller because of the presence of the Waste Management\nSystem. This gives MARVIN a total internal storage capacity of\n-3.84 m 3.\n7.2\n\nLife Support\n\nand Environmental\n\nEquipment\n\nThe Cabin Air Conditioning\n(CAC) system and the Pressure Regulation (PR) system are necessary to keep MARVIN\'s cabin\nair clean, cool and semi-humid\nas well as pressurized. Below the main floor is where the CAC and PR systems are located. Raising\npanels located in the floor can access these systems.\nThe CAC controls the environment\ninside MARVIN\n\nto approximately\n\n20 \xc2\xb0C with 25 to 50% relative humidity.\n\nHydroxide filters in the CAC clean the air of deadly carbon dioxide and other airborne contaniments\nthe air through MARVIN.\n\nLithium\n\nwhile fans and ducting circulate\n\n260\n\nLPI Contribution No. 979\nw\n\nm\n\n7.3\n\nSleeping\n\ni\n\nArrangements\n\nThe shape of MARVIN was predetermined\nbefore serious work and research began on the interior of MARVIN.\nSleeping\narrangements\nhad to be ultimately developed without compromising\nthe MIS Units and the limited space left inside MARVIN.\nThis\nwas accomplished\nby using a conventional\nbed system that could be broken down and stored during the daytime when not in use.\nFigure 7.2 shows a cross section of the Sleeping Bunks (SB) in place for a three-person\ncrew.\n\nu\n\n1ira\n\nm\n\nm\nb\n\nb\n\nMa,_\nSys.\n\npit\n\n16\n\nAir[o\n\n-.-----2.310-----\n\nFigure 7.2: Front and Right-side\n\nView of the Sleeping\n\nBunks\n\nfor a Three-person\n\ni\n\nCrew.\n\nCushioning and bedding are stored in the MIS Units during the daytime.\nThis arrangement\nallows for approximately\n0.316\nmeters of clearance on the side so the crew can still walk by without too much restriction.\nIt also gives the top two crewmembers\na\nsleeping area of- 1.75 m2 and the bottom crew member -1.41 m2 of sleeping area. Figure 7.2 shows the side view of the SB in place\nalong the right side of MARVIN.\nIn the daytime the SB can be broken down and stored on the floor.
