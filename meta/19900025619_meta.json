The particle growth model of Heymsfield embedded in a kinematic flow field representative of the Sierra barrier was used to study the ice particle growth by diffusion, accretion and subsequent fall trajectories. The particles observed by the aircraft were classified into habits. The growth of observed particles were compared with the model predicted evolution. Using the aggregation model of Heymsfield, the observation of formation of aggregates is less than 10 minutes was verified. The key findings of this study are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "28", "submissionId": 19900025619, "issn": "0894-8763", "id": "044f81bf8aad463687433c54b1aaa1f9", "publicationName": "Journal of Applied Meteorology", "publicationDate": "1989-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
