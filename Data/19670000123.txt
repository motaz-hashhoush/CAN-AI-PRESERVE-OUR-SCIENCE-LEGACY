The\nmagnitude of parts, plus the requirement that all\nsmoothly operate simultaneously to achieve the\ndesired separation, comprise a system often unreliable.\nThe solution:\nA mechanism that locks and unlocks through an\ninternal collet device that is locked and released by\nthe action of a single reciprocating shaft. The appreciable reduction in the number of parts required to\noperate the mechanism results in a level of reliability\nhigher than in previous systems.\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\n\t\n\nPneumatic Force \'B"\n\nPlate\n\nHow it\'s done:\nThe mechanism, in the locked position, joins the\nvehicle and the ground umbilical plate. Prior to disconnect, a pneumatic force "B" is applied to preload\nthe push-off foot, which preload is withheld from the\nvehicle by a series of pins that engage the foot shaft.\nUpon command to unlock, either a pneumatic force\n"A" or a mechanical force "C" is applied to the actuator shaft. As the shaft is forced to the right, the fingers\ncollapse toward the centerline of the mechanism,\nallowing the ground umbilical plate to be unlocked\nfrom the vehicle. Upon completion of the unlocking\nfunction, the pins begin to ride down the ramp of the\nactuator shaft. When they reach a predetermined\npoint, the push-off foot is released and its preload\nforces it against the vehicle, thus separating vehicle\nand ground umbilical plate.\n(continued overleal)\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights,\n\n\t\n\nNote:\t\nInquiries concerning this invention may be di- \t\nrected to:\t\nTechnology Utilization Officer\t\nMarshall Space Flight Center\t\nHuntsville, Alabama 35812 \t\nReference: B67-10123\t\n\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to NASA, Code\nGP, Washington, D.C. 20546.\nSource: Charles E.
