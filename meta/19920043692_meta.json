Planned unpiloted missions are discussed including the Mars Orbital Mapping Mission, the Mars Rover Sample Return, the Mars Aeronomy Orbiter, and the Mars Environmental Survey. General features relevant to the missions are mentioned including launch opportunities, manned-mission phases, and propulsion options. The four mission architectures are set forth and are made up of: (1) the Mars-exploration infrastructures; (2) science emphasis for the moon and Mars; (3) the moon to stay and Mars exploration; and (4) space resource utilization. The possibility of robotic missions to the moon and Mars is touched upon and are concluded to be possible by the end of the century. The ramifications of a Mars base are discussed with specific reference to habitability and base activities, and the human missions are shown to require a heavy-lift launcher and either chemical/aerobrake or nuclear-thermal propulsion system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920043692, "id": "42263904a57b4f299f48054f5d3f175a", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
