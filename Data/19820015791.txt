b'SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF ADD-ON PRICE ESTIMATE FOR SELECT SILICON\nWAFERING TECHNOLOGIES\nAnant R. Mokashi\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nPasadena, California\n\nABSTRACT\nSilicon sheet technology is being developed for the Low-Cost Solar\nArray (LSA) Project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. One way of\nproducing silicon sheet is to grow ingots from polysilicon, either by the\nCzochralski (Cz) process or by casting, and slicing the ingots into wafers.\nIn order to achieve the LSA price goal of f0.70/~ , the price allocation for Cz ingot growth plus slicing is $27.4/m for crrcular wafers.\nThe price allocation for cast ingot plus slicing is $36.3/m2 for square or\nrectangular wafers. The cost of producing wafers from silicon ingots is a\nmajor component of the add-on price of silicon sheet. Wafering technology\n~\ntherefore needs considerable impruvement in o r t ? ~to meet the price goals.\nPresently, internal-diameter (ID) sawing, multiblade slurry (MBS) sawing and fixed-abrasive slicing technique (FAST) are the three wafering\nmethods being developed by the LSA Project.\nEconomic analyses of the add-on price estimates and their sensitivity\nfor the ID, MBS, and FAST processes are presented. Interim Price Estimation\nGuidelines (IPEG) are used for estimating a process add-on price. Sensitivity analysis of price is performed with respect to cost parameters such as\nequipment, space, direct labor, materials (blade life) and utilities, and\nthe production parameters such as slicing rate, slices per centimeter and\nprocess yield, using a computer program specifically developed to do sensitivity analysis with IPEG. The results aid in identifying the important\ncost parameters and assist in deciding the direction of technology development efforts.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Low-Cost Solar Array (LSA) Project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, is developing the technology for manufacturing photovoltaic\nmodules. Project goals are to achieve technical readiness by 1982 and commercial readiness by 1986, by producing modu\'es at the price of $0.70/wp\n(1980$).\nDeveloping the technology for producing large-area silicon sheets\n(LASS) is one of the project tasks. One approach is to grow molten polysilicon as ingots, using the Czochralski (Cz) method or casting processes such\nas the heat-exchanger method (HEM) with directional solidification, and to\nslice the ingots into wafers. The three wafering techniques that are being\ndeveloped by the LASS Task are: (1) internal-diameter slicing by ID saw,\n\n(2) the multiblade slurry (MBS) technique and (3) multiple-wire fixedabrasive slicing technique (FAST). The economic analysis of the add-on\nprice estimates for these wafering techniques, in the light of the LSA Project goals, is of particular interest in this study.\nIn order ro achieve the module price goal, the price allocation for Cz\ningot growth plus the slicing process is $27.4/m2 for circular wafers, and the\nprice allocation for cast-ingot growth plus slicing is $36.3/m2 for square or\nrectangular wafers (Reference 1 . Distributing the allocation equ lly between\n)\nS\nthe two processes, the growth cost will be $14.m2 for Cz and $181111 for cast\ningot. Assuming wafering at the rate of 25 slices/cm, the allocation for\ngrowth is $14/kg for Cz ingot and $18/kg for cast ingot, as the conversion\nfactor for $/m2 to $/kg is 1 for 25 slices/cm. However, it appears that\nfor 15-cm-dia ingots the wafering rate may be as low as 17 slices/cm. The\ngrowth cost of $14/kg would amount o $20.2/m2 for wafering of 17 slices/cm,\nleaving only $27.4 - $20.2\n$7.2/m2 for wafering. Taking into account the\nincreased silicon utilization of thicker wafers, the allocation for wafering\nwould be less than $7.2/m2 for 15-cm-dia ingots. For smaller-diameter\ningots the growth cost will be more than that for 15-cm-dia ingots\n(Reference 2); hcwever, the slices per centimeter can be increased. For\nsquare ingots, the allocation for wafering at 25 slices/cm would be $36.3\n$18.0 = $18.3/m2.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nThe price estimation method used is described below. The add-on price\nfor each of the three wafering processes is computed and the important cost\nparameters are identified. Based on the sensitivity analyses of the key\nparameters, conclusions are drawn suggesting the direction of technology\ndevelopment.\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING IPEG (SAIPEG)\nThe add-on price for a process is estimated using the Interim Price\nEstimation guidelines (IPEG) (Reference 3. Tne price is estimated by using\n)\nthe following equations from IPEG 2 (the improved version of IPEG)\n(Reference 4).\nAMC = 0.52 x EQPT\n\n+ 109.0\n\nx AREA\n\n+\n\n2.8 x DLAB\n\n+\n\n1.2 x (MATS\n\n+ UTIL)\n\nPRICE ($/m2) = AMC ($/~~)/QTYPYR\n(m21yr)\n\n(1)\n\n(2\n\nwhere\nAMC\n\n= Annual manufacturing cost ($/yr).\n\nEQPT = Total installed cost of equipment ($). Coefficient 0.52\ncorresponds to equipment life of 10 years.\nA M = Area required by the process equipment and its operators (ft2 ).\n\nDLAB\nMATS\n\nCoefficient 2 8 is used if\n.\nthe fringe benefits are not included in DLAB.\n\n= Annual cost of direct labor ($/yr).\n\n-\n\nAnnual cost of materials and supplies ($Iyr).\n\nUTIL\n\n= Annual cost of utilities ($/yr).\n\nQTYPYR = Quantity of wafers produced (m21yr).\nThe input data for the base case of a process for the production parameters and the cost parameters are obtained by projections based or* experience and judgment.\nSAIPEG is a computer program for doing sensitivity analysis using IPEG.\nThe sensitivity analysis of a process add-on price is performed by SAIPEG\nwith respect either to the production rate or to any cost parameters varied\none at a time with the remaining data held constant. The production rate\nand the cost parameters in turn are varied by changing some of the base-case\ninput parameters.\nSAIPEG RESULTS OF WAFERING PROCESSES\nThe sensitivity analysis of the add-on price is performed for each of\nthe three wafering techniques. The sensitivity of the key parameters and\ntheir impact on the price are discussed in detail below.\nMultiple Ingot Wafering With ID Saw\nAn earlier study of wafering 15-cm ingots individually by ID saw has\nshown that it is hard to meet the price goals of $7.20/m2; it requires a\n)\nplunge rate of 12 to 15 cm/min, which is not practicable (Reference 5. One\nof the ways of improving the throughput of ID wafering is to build a machine\ncapable of handling multiple ingots simultaneously. The ID saw considered in\nthis analysis is suitable for slicing three 15-cm-dia ingots simultaneously.\nThe input data for the base case is given in Table 1. QTYPYR, AMC, the price\nand the price breakdown in terms of cost parameters are presented in Table 2.\nEach machine will produce 6139 m2 of wafers annually at a cost of $93,673,\ngiving a price of $15.26/m2. The price breakdown reveals that utilities\nand area-related costs are negligible. Cost of EQPT, DLAB and MATS are distributed fairly equally, amounting to 25%, 32%, and 37X, respectively.\nEffect of production variation in terms of the plunge rate and the blade\nlife is shown in Figure 1. The base-case data assume a blade life of 1530\nslices (3 ingots x 30 cm long x 17 qliceslcm), requiring a new blade for each\nrun. The price is reduced to $10/m by increasing the blade life to 4000\nslices and the plunge rate to 5 cm/min. This requires improvements in the\nquality of ;he blade. It may be noticed in Figure 1 that for a given plunge\nrate the decrease in price with blade life beyond 2500-3000 slices or more is\nnot significant. To achieve the price goal, a plunge rate of 5 cm/min or\nmore and a blade life of 4000 slices may be required.\nThe effect of varying DLAB in terms of machines per operator (MPO) and\nlabor pay rate is shown in Figure 2. By increasing MPO from 6 to 12, the\nprice is reduced from $15.26/m2 to $12.85/m2. Due to the asymptotic nature\nof the curves, there is no signiffcant saving in increasing MPO beyond 12.\n\nTable 1.\n\nBase-Caw Dath For\nID wafer in^ Process\n\nINGOTS CUT PER RUN\nINGOT LENGTH (CM)\nINGOT DIAMETER (CM)\nSLICES PER (CM)\nPLUNGE RATE (CMIMINI\nINGOT SET UP T I M (HRSI\nSiil;; SET U P TIME (HOURS)\nBLADE LIFE (SLICES)\nNON PRODUCTIVE TIMENR (DAYS)\nPROCESS YIELD\nMACHINE COST ($/EACH)\nMACHINE LIFE T I M (YEARS)\n\nTable 2.\n\nPrice Estimation Results of\nthe ID Wafering Process\nUsing Base-Case Data\n\n3.00\n\n15.00\n\nl3. &7\n7\n0.50\na%\n1530.00\n\na00\n0.95\n45000. 00\n\nPRODUCTION PER YEAR l\nANNllAL COSTS ($)\n\nADD-ON PRICE ($1~\')\nPRICE BREAKDOWN\n\n~\n\n~\n=\n\nl 6,138.83\n\n=\n\n93,672.52\n\n15.26\nPERCENT\n\nEQU IPMENT\n\n10.00\nAREA\n\nAREA PER MACHINE (F?)\n\nLABOR PAY RATE ($lHRI\nMACH INES PER OPERATOR\nBLADE PRICE ($/EACH)\nOTHER CONSUMABLES ($/RUN)\nPOWER CONSUMPTION (KWI EACH)\nENERGY RATE ($/KWH)\n\nFig. 1.\n\n50.00\n\n100.00\n20.00\nL 50\n0.05\n\nAdd-on Price vs Production\nRate for Wafering 15-cm-Dia\nSilicon Ingots (17 elices/cm)\nWith ID Saw\n\nDIRECT LABOR\n\n31.69\n\nM A I Z R IALS\n\n6.58\n\n36.74\n\nUTILITIES\nTOTAL\n\nFig. 2.\n\nAdd-on Price vs Direct\nLabor Cost for Wafering\n15-cm-Dia Silicon Ingots\n(17 slices/cm) With ID Saw\n\nBy i n c r e a s i n g the blade cost from $100 t o $140, the p r i c e is increased\nfrom $15.26/m2 t o $17.23/m2.
