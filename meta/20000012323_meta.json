This paper contributes to these goals by examining speed guidance profiles to aid a pilot in decelerating along the runway to an exit. A speed profile essentially tells the pilot what the airplane's speed should be as a function of where the airplane is on the runway. While it is important to get off the runway as soon as possible (when striving to minimize runway occupancy time), the deceleration along a speed profile should be constrained by passenger comfort. Several speed profiles are examined with respect to their maximum decelerations and times to reach exit speed. One profile varies speed linearly with distance; another has constant deceleration; and two related nonlinear profiles delay maximum deceleration (braking) to reduce time spent on the runway.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000012323, "id": "2868d7f7dddb4c649fbe4021e377a47d", "publicationDate": "1999-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000012323.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000012323/downloads/20000012323.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000012323/downloads/20000012323.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000012323/downloads/20000012323.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
