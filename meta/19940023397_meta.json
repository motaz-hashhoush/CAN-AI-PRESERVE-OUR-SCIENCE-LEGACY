Unfortunately, cyclic stress-strain deformation alters the microstructure of the material. These structural changes can lead to fatigue damage and ultimately service failure. Therefore, in order to assess the integrity of the alloy, a correlation between fatigue damage and a measurable microstructural property is needed. Aluminum 2024-T3, a commonly used commercial alloy, contains many grains (individual crystals) of various orientations. The sizes and orientations of these grains are known to affect the strength, hardness, and magnetic permeability of polycrystalline alloys and metals; therefore, perhaps a relationship between a grain property and the fatigue state can be established. Tension-compression cycling in aluminum alloys can also induce changes in their dislocation densities. These changes can be studied from measurements of the electrical resistivities of the materials. Consequently, the goals of this investigation were: to study the grain orientation of aluminum 2024-T3 and to seek a correlation between the grain orientation and the fatigue state of the material; and to measure the electrical resistivities of fatigued samples of aluminum 2024-T3 and to interpret the findings.", "title": "An experimental investigation of fatigue damage in aluminum 2024-T3 alloys", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940023397, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ferguson, Milton W."}, "organization": {"name": "Norfolk State Univ.", "location": "VA, United States"}}, "id": "82e528ef815c4fcb8b0d3c13913d4570"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940023397, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940023397, "id": "01f53dc3d9d64bb3800068ca19fc28d0", "publicationName": "Old Dominion Univ., The 1993 NASA-ODU American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "1993-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940023397.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940023397/downloads/19940023397.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940023397/downloads/19940023397.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940023397/downloads/19940023397.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
