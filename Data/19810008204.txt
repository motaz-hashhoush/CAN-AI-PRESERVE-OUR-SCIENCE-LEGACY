Meanwhile, it is known that a person can by volitional effort produce additional muscle tension at any time, in any\nconditions and in any body position, with movemont or without it. I nvestigations have shown that by the method of isometric muscular exertion it is possible, without leavii.; one\'s work place and without Interrupting labor operations, to activate various muscle groups with\n...\t\n..^\nc of Vii4 -_ v\t\nc;a t;iii\t the ti06\t\nno negative eia]\n\nf\n_ __dY\xe2\x96\xba _t^\n\n[2\n\nAt the same time the absence of data on the effect of isometric muscular\nexertion; on the human body complicates the development, planning and\n\np \xc2\xb0a , ttcal use of such exercises.\nThe present study was conducted to determine the effect of isometric muscular exertion on the human body. In the first series the\nexercises included movements that are most frequently encountered in\nthe process of active life, that are easily done and that involve basic\nmuscle groups: flection and extension of the elbows, knees and ankles,\nand raising and lowering of the shoulders. The movements were performed with one and two extremities in a sitting position, in the conventional maxu?er and with additional muscular tension, at first with\na force of SO a of the maximum # and then with the maximum S and 10 times\n(movement cycle--2 sec).\n\nOn the basis of the fact that by volitional effort it is possible\nto produce and sustain muscle tension even without novement and that\nin industrial conditions this form of increasing muscular activity is\n*Numbers in the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n1\n\nP\n\nr\n\nthe most rational (for the purpose of preventing hypodynamia), in the\nnext experiment exertion of the same muscles was produced and sustained,\nbut in isometric conditions. The pulse, arterial pressure, skin temperature, respiratory rate, minute respiratory volume (MRV), and\nelectrical activity (EA) of the biceps and triceps muscles of the\nshoulder, the femoral quadriceps, the gastrocnemius, the tibia and\nthe trapezoid were recorded. The skin temperature was measured with\na TPEI-1 thermometer over the working muscles for 2 minutes. The\nrespiratory rate and the MRV were recorded with the help of an oxyspirograph (M yeTA 1-25B). An lysis of the results indicates that\nperformance of tho, exercises in the conventional manner by one or two\nextremities for 10 sec does not cause significant changes in the\nrecorded body systems (with the exception of the muscular EA). In\nall cases the changes were statistically Insignificant. On performance\nof the exercises for 20 sec the MRV increased by 3.1 1 (124 0t), p {\n/\n0.05, and the remaining changes were statistically insignificant.\nPerformance of the exercises with additional isometric muscular exertion equal to 50% of the maximum for 10 sec was accompanied by reliable\nchanges in the ptilse and the MRV (in all cases p t 0.05). On performance of the exercises for 20 sec the pulse sped up by 9.4 beaus (113%)t\nthe MRV increased by 8.4 1 (1570), p < O.Ol, respiratory rate--by 1.3,\nsystolic pressure increased by 6.1, and diastolic by 0.7 mm Hg (105\nand 102;0. The greatest skin temperature increase (+0.54 0 ) was observed over the tibial muscle, p > 0.1. On performance of the exercises with maximum muscular exertion for 20 sec the greatest shif ts\nof the recorded indices were noted (on the average for all the execcises)s the pulse sped up by 12.1 beats, the systolic pressure increased by 7.5 and the diastolic by 1.9 mm Hg, the r espiratory rate\nincreased by 0.4, the MRV--by 10.4 1, and the skin temperature over\nthe muscles increased by 0.42-0.58 0 . Performance of the exercises\nwithout movement was accompanied by approximately the same shifts in\nthe recorded indices.\nIn evaluating the results of this series of experiments in planning\nto use similar exercises for the prevention of hypodynamia in industrial\nconditions, it may be stated that the performance of individual short\n\n2\n^^i\n\nmovements of local character in the conventional manner does not\nbring about substantial changez in the body systems and can be equated\nwith tho rea.tion caused by the postural tone activity of musales that\nprovide the minimal level of functional activity of the body systems.\nThe performance of exercises by the method of isometric muscular exertion with force equal to 50% of the maximum, with movement and without\nmovement, is accompanied by an .increase in the functional shifts in the\nbody systems and from the viewpoint of dominant inertia it has a significantly more marked aftereffect. The functional shifts with this\nreach optimal values, which may be considered a positive factor in\nthe prevention of hypodynamia. The pe g,-formance of exercises with the\nmaximum isometric muscular exertion is accompanied by disruption of\nindividual functions of the organism (trembling of the extremities and\nthe entire body, change in skin color, disruption of the respiratory\nrhythm, delay and strain) and also by concentration of attention on\nthe way the exercises are performed, and in connection with this it\ncannot be recommended for use as industrial exercises for the prevention of hypodynam ia .\nm\nOn the basis of the accumulated data we developed a series of\nexercises of volitional gymnastics to fit the conditions of sitting work.\n1. Raise the feet off the floor, tense the muscles, move the\nfeet in various directions.\n2. Press the heels against the chair legs and tense the muscles.\n3. Straighten the legs at the knees and tense the leg muscles.\nif conditions do not allow straightening of the legs, grasp the chair\nlegs with the toes of the shoes and tense the muscles.\n4. Tensing the muscles of the shoulder girdle, move the shoulders\nin various directions.\n\n5.\n\nTensing the back muscles,. bend.\n\n6. Move the abdomens forward--inhalation, backward--exhalation.\n\n3\n\n7.\n\nTense the buttocks muscles and the muscles of the pelvic floor.\n\n8. Tensing the muscles of the trunk, bend and turn in various\ndirections.\n9. Tensing the neck muscles, move the head.\n10.. Tense all the Muscles of the body.\nAfter a preliminary trial the first group of subjects performed\nthe series of exercises 1-3 times in a row= each exercise was done for\n10 sec with a force 50% of the maximum. Because in industrial conditions with mass performance of the exercises maintenance of dosed\nmuscle exertion with EMG control of their activity is not possible,\nthe second group performed the exercises without an additional control,\njust with the instruction: "Perform the exercises with muscular exertion\nthat is equal to half the maximum. force." For the purpose of a comparir;on of the indices with the performance of the conventional series\nof industrial gymnastics [la in different ways the third group performed it First traditionally and then with isometric muscular exertion equal to 50% of the maximum (time - 1 min 40 sec).\nAnalysis of the results (Table 1) shows that a single execution \t\n/40\nof the series is accompanied by changes in the recorded indices, which,\nhaving reached certain values, in the next 2 -3 repetitions of the series\nchange insignificantly.\nPerformance of the exercises without additional control of the\nmuscular activity by EMG was accompanied by a significant variation\nin the muscular exertion, although its average value was maintained at\nthe level of 30-40 of the maximum force, which brought a moderate\nreaction in the organism. On performance of the conventional series\nin the traditional manner and with isometric muscular exertion (Table\n2) sharply expressed differences were detected. Since the most important thing for the prevention of hypodynamia ii: industrial conditions\nis increase of the muscular, activity of the basic muscular groups to\n4\n\nn\n\nTABLE 1.
