In this paper we demonstrate how this ability can be exploited by an attacker to distribute his/her attack, in particular SQL injection attacks, in such a way that an intrusion detection system (IDS) could fail to identify this attack. To demonstrate this, we set up a small private cloud, established a vulnerable website in one instance, and placed an IDS within the cloud to monitor the network traffic. We found that an attacker could quite easily defeat the IDS by periodically altering its IP address. To detect such an attacker, we propose to use multi-agent plan recognition, where the multiple source IPs are considered as different agents who are mounting a collaborative attack. We show that such a formulation of this problem yields a more sophisticated approach to detecting SQL injection attacks within a cloud computing environment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011364, "endDate": "2013-07-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "SAM 2013 International Conference on Security and Management", "location": "Las Vegas, NV", "id": "7dfac4820d87473aae4ca7b19f74d99e", "startDate": "2013-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011364, "id": "004da51556e54946836d229fda994bbe", "publicationDate": "2013-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011364.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011364/downloads/20130011364.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011364/downloads/20130011364.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011364/downloads/20130011364.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
