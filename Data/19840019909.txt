The hardware chosen as the test bed for this evaluation was the hybrids\nand modules manufactured by Rockwell International for the MSFC Flight Accelerometer\nSafety Cut-Of f System (FASCOS) . Three potentially low cost packaging and interconnection alternates were selected for evaluation.\n\'\nThis study was performed in three phases: hardware fabrication and testing,\ncost comparison, and reliability evaluation. Phase I included developing the technology for adhesive sealing and delidding FASCOS hybrid packages, fabrication/assembling\nand testing 32 FASCOS hybrids, designing a multiwire board functionally equivalent to\nthe present multilayer board, and assembling and testing 2 FASCOS modules. Phase II\nconsisted of identifying the important cost factors and ascertaining the corresponding\ncost deltas for the FASCOS hybrids and modules attributable to the packaging and\ninterconnection alternates, implemented. Phase III involved electrically testing\nadhesive sealed FASCOS hybrids after exposure to the 10-day moisture resistance test\nand the 1000-hour life test to determine their functional reliability, and performing\nmass spectrometric analyses on these and other adhesive sealed FASCOS hybrids to\ndetermine the composition of their internal atmospheres.\n\n17.\n\n18. .

L. Perkins\nJ. J. Licari\nABSTRACT\n\nThe use of adhesive package sealing instead of seam welding,\nnickel-plated Kovar packages rather than gold-plated Kovar packages,\nand multiwire boards instead of multilayer boards was evaluated to\ndetermine their potential for reducing the cost of hybrid systems\nwithout degrading reliability. The evaluation was made by manufacturing specific NASA/MSFC hardware, FASCOS (Flight Accelerometer\nSafety Cut-Off System) hybrids and board assemblies, using the new\ntechniques, subjecting these hybrids and board assemblies to normal\nscreen and functional testing to determine their performance, and\ncomparing their costs with those of the same hardware fabricated\nusing the conventional techniques.\nEffort included developing the technology for adhesive sealing\nand delidding FASCOS packages, fabricating/assembling and testing\nFASCOS hybrids, designing a multiwire board functionally equivalent\nto the present FASCOS multilayer board, assembling and testing multiwire board assemblies, identifying the important cost factors and\ndetermining the cost deltas due to the implemented changes, exposing\nadhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids to the ten-day moisture resistance\ntest and the 1000 hour life test, and functionally testing these\nhybrids and analyzing their internal atmospheres after these exposures.\nThe major conclusions of the study were that nickel-plated Kovar\npackages are recommended as a replacement for gold-plated Kovar packages,\nand multiwire boards are recommended as a replacement for multilayer\nboards, but adhesive package sealing is not recommended as a replacement\nfor seam welding.\nviii\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n1.1\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE\n\nThe objective of this study was to develop selected potentially\nlow cost, alternate packaging and interconnection techniques, implement them in the manufacture of specific NASA/MSFC hardware, and\ndetermine the actual cost savings achieved by their use. The hardware chosen as the test bed for this evaluation was the hybrids and\nmodules manufactured by Rockwell International for the MSFC Flight\nAccelerometer Safety Cut-Off System (FASCOS). Three potentially\nlow cost packaging and interconnection alternates were selected\nfor evaluation. These were:\n1) adhesive package sealing instead of metallurgical\npackage sealing (seam-welding),\n2) nickel-plated rather than gold-plated Kovar\npackages and lids, and\n3) multiwire boards instead of multilayer boards.\n1.2 STUDY SCOPE\n\nThis study was performed in three phases: hardware fabrication and testing, cost comparison, and reliability evaluation. Phase I\nincluded developing the technology for adhesive sealing and delidding\nFASCOS hybrid packages, fabricating/assembling and testing 32 FASCOS\nhybrids, designing a multiwire board functionally equivalent to the\npresent multilayer board, and assembling and testing 2 FASCOS modules.\nPhase II consisted of identifying the important cost factors and\nascertaining the corresponding cost deltas for the FASCOS hybrids\nand modules attributable to the packaging and interconnection\nalternates implemented. Phase III involved electrically testing\nadhesive sealed FASCOS hybrids after exposure to the 10-day moisture\n\nresistance test and the 1000-hour life test to determine their\nfunctional reliability, and performing mass spectrometric analyses\non these and other adhesive sealed FASCOS hybrids to determine the\ncomposition of their internal atmospheres.\n\n2.0 TECHNICAL DISCUSSION\n2.1 PHASE I - HARDWARE FABRICATION AND TESTING\n\nThis phase of the study involved developing the technology for\nadhesive sealing and delidding FASCOS hybrids; fabricating, assembling, and testing 32 FASCOS hybrids using nickel-plated Kovar\npackages and lids and adhesive sealing; designing a multiwire\nboard functionally equivalent to the present FASCOS multilayer\nboard; and assembling two FASCOS modules using multiwire boards\nand functionally testing them in the present FASCOS engineering\nsystem. Delidding and reworking the FASCOS hybrids and reworking,\nthe FASCOS modules was allowed as required. This effort is discussed in detail in the following sections.\n2.1.1\n\nTechnology for Adhesive Sealing and Delidding FASCOS Hybrids\n\n2.1.1.1 Selection of Package Sealing Adhesive\n2.1.1.1.1 Candidate Adhesives\nTwo adhesives were selected for evaluation for sealing the\nFASCOS hybrids \xe2\x80\x94 Ablefilm 507 and Ablefilm 552./ Ablefilm 507\nconsists of a D6EBA (diglycidal ether of bisphenol A) resin and\na dicyandiamide curing agent. This adhesive was one of the first\nfilm adhesives produced by Ablestik Laboratories and is still\nwidely used for sealing packages. Ablefilm 552 is relatively,\nnew and was developed expressly as an improved adhesive for\nsealing gold-plated Kovar packages. It is a hybrid of Ablefilm\n550 and Ablefilm 529, reputedly combining the best characteristics\nof these adhesives, and was highly recommended by Ablestik\nLaboratories personnel. It consists of the nitrile modified\nDGEBA resin developed for Ablefilm 550 and the diaminodiphenylsulfone curing agent used in Ablefilm 529.\n, .\n\nFilm adhesives were selected rather than paste adhesives\nbecause they are easier to apply and do not run out during assembly,\nand cure. The specific film adhesives, Ablefilm 507 and Ablefilm\n552,were selected for the following reasons. Ablefilm 507 was\npreviously evaluated under Contract NAS8-31992 and was found to\nbe one of the four best of the ten adhesives evaluated and one of\nonly two adhesives (the other was Ablebond 789-1) that sealed\n2.54 cm (1 inch) square gold-plated Kovar packages adequately to\npass the seal test after ten days exposure to 85\xc2\xb0C/85% RH.\nAblefilm 552 was selected because it contains the same resin\nsystem as Ablebond 789-1 which was also previously evaluated\nunder Contract NAS 8-31992 and was found to be the best of the\nten adhesives evaluated.\n2.1.1.1.2\n\nAdhesive Preforms\n\nAdhesive preforms six mils thick with a two-mil thick\nfiberglass supporting fabric were selected for this study.\nThese preforms have outside dimensions of 0.990 by 1.990 inches\nand inside dimensions of 0.890 by 1.890 inches, giving a sealing\nsurface 50 mils wide.\n2.1.1.1.3 Adhesive Evaluation and Selection\nEight empty FASCOS packages were sealed using 10-mil thick\nflat gold-plated Kovar lids. (15-mil thick nickel-plated\nKovar lids were not available at the time.) Five were sealed with\nAblefilm 552 and three with Ablefilm 507. Initially two packages\nwere sealed with Ablefilm 552 and seal tested in accordance with\nMethod 1014.2 of MIL-STD-883. The packages were bombed in\nhelium for three hours at 30 psig and then fine and gross leak\ntested. Both packages, were found to be gross leakers. Three\nadditional packages were then sealed with Ablefilm 552 and a\ntest performed to determine if the packages were gross leakers\nas sealed or if the helium bombing at 30 psig oil-cans the 10mil lids and causes the packages to be gross leakers. These\n\npackages were gross leak tested after sealing prior to helium\nbombing and found to pass. They were then bombed in helium for\nthree hours at 30 psig and again gross leak tested. Two of the\nthree packages were found to be gross leakers. The one good\npackage was then fine leak tested and found to have a measured\nleak rate of 1.0 x 10-7 atm cc/sec helium or 3.7 x 10 8 atm\ncc/sec air equivalent. After fine leak testing, this package\nwas again gross leak tested and passed.\nThree packages were then sealed with Ablefilm 507 and the\nsame procedure was followed. All three packages passed the\ninitial gross leak test. After bombing in helium for three\nhours at 30 psig^ one of the packages failed the gross leak .\ntest and two passed. Fine leak testing of these two packages\nQ\nshowed leak rates of 1.6 and 2.5 x 10 atm cc/sec helium or\n\'\n6.0 and 9.3 x 10 9 atm cc/sec air equivalent. After fine leak,\ntesting, these packages also were again gross leak tested and\npassed.\nThese results show that the adhesive-sealed packages were\ngood after sealing but that helium bombing at 30 psig damaged\nthe seals. This is believed to be due to oil-canning of the\n10-mil lids under the helium pressure.\nThese results also indicate that Ablefilm 507 performs\nbetter as a packa-ge sealant than Ablefilm 552. Only one of\nthree packages sealed with Ablefilm 507 was a gross leaker\nafter helium bombing while four of five packages sealed with*\nAblefilm 552 were gross leakers.\n\nSix empty FASCOS packages also were sealed using 15-mil thick\nnickel-plated Kovar lids\xe2\x80\x94three with Ablefilm 552 and three with\nAblefilm 507. These packages were then leak tested following the\nsame procedure previously used for the packages sealed with the\n10-mil thick lids; that is, gross leak tested after sealing prior\nto helium bombing, gross leak tested immediately after helium\nbombing for three hours at 30 psig, fine leak tested, and then gross\nleak tested again. All packages passed all gross leak tests. The\nmeasured fine leak rates were as shown in Table 1 .\nTable 1. Leak Rates of FASCOS Packages Adhesive Sealed\nwith 15-Mil Thick Nickel-Plated Kovar Lids\nMeasured Fine Leak Rate\n(atm cc/sec)\nPackage\nHelium\nAir Equivalent\nAblefilm 552\n\n#1\n#2\n#3\n\n4.3 x 10"8\n1.4 x 10"7\n2.7 x 10"7\n\n1.6 x 10-8\n5.2 x 10-8\n1.0 x 10"7\n\nAblefilm 507\n-\n\n#1\n#2\n#3 >\n\n1.4 x 10"8\n4.0 x 10"8\n2.7 x 10"8\n\n5.2 x 10"9\n1.5 x 10"8\n1.0 x 10"8\n\nThese results show that adhesive seals passing the MIL-STD-883\nSeal Test can be obtained for the FASCOS packages when the thicker\n(15-mil thick) lids are used. This also substantiates the validity\nof the speculation that the thinner (10-mil thick) lids were oilcanning under the 30 psig helium bombing pressure and damaging the\nseals.\nThese results also further indicate that Ablefilm 507 performs\nbetter as a package sealant than Ablefilm 552. As shown, the fine\nleak rates measured for the packages sealed with Ablefilm 507 are an\norder of magnitude less than those measured for the packages sealed\nwith Ablefilm 552.\n\nBased on these results, Able-film 507 was selected as the\npackage sealing adhesive to be used for the FASCOS hybrid build\nfor this study. Also, 15-mil thick lids were selected for use.\n2.1.1.2 Selection of Type of Lids\nBoth stepped and flat lids were considered for the present\napplication. Stepped lids have the advantage that the step\nserves as \\a guide to ensure proper alignment ofithe adhesive\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni\npreforms during package assembly and restricts the flow of the\nadhesive during cure, but the step interferes with all .conceivable delidding methods. Flat lids have the advantage that they\nare about 40% less expensive than stepped lids and considerably\nless fragile. The edges of the stepped lids are only approximately 5-mils thick and are easily bent during handling. The\nflatness and greater thickness of the edges of the flat lids\nnot only simplifies delidding but makes it possible to salvage\nthe lids for reuse if desired.\nBased on these considerations, flat lids were chosen for\nthe present application. The lids selected are made of 15-mil\nthick Kovar and have a nickel plating 200 to 300 microinches\nthick.\n2.1.1.3 Development of Method for Adhesive Sealing FASCOS Packages\n2.1.1.3.1 Design and Fabrication o;f Tooling Required^ for Adhesive\nSealing Packages\nIn order to successfully adhesive seal packages, pressure\nmust be applied while the adhesive is being cured. The amount\nof pressure is not particularly critical, but it must be adequate to bring the parts in intimate contact and should be\nuniform over the sealing area. Also, in the case of adhesive\npreforms, the performs must be aligned and tacked in place on\neither the package lid or case. This is especially true for\nlarger-sized preforms. The larger the preform, the flimsier,\nit is, and the more it is distorted from its intended shape.\n\nFor example, no matter how carefully the 6 mil thick, 50 mil\nwide, approximately 1 x 2 inch preforms required for the\nFASCOS hybrids are stored and handled, they are not rectangular as they should be to fit on the lids, but are slightly\nbowed\xe2\x80\x94especially along the two-inch dimension.\nThree types of tooling are essential for adhesive sealing\nthe FASCOS packages. One to align the preform with the lid\nand tack it in place, another to align the lid/preform and\nthe package case with each other, and a third to clamp the\nlid preform and package case together and hold them in alignment during curing.\nTooling meeting these requirements was designed and fabricated. This tooling consists of a lid/preform alignment fixture\nfor aligning the preforms on the lids and tacking them in\nplace, clamping plates and clips for clamping the package\ncases and lids/preforms together and holding them in alignment during cure, and a package assembly/ alignment fixture\nf\nfor assembling the clamping plates, package cases, and\nlids/preforms and aligning them with each other while they\nare clipped together. Photographs of this tooling are\ngiven in Figures 1 through 3. Note that the clamping plates\nare recessed on the bottom side (the side shown in the photograph)\nso that they only contact the outer edges of the package\nlids and cases. This is to ensure that they uniformly distribute the pressure and do not distort (bend) the lids.\n\nFigure 1. Lid/Preform Alignment Fixture\n\nFigure 2. Clamping Plates and Clips\n9\n\nFigure 3. Package Assembly/Alignment Fixture\n\n10\n\n2.1.1.3.2 Procedure for Assembling Packages\nThe procedure for assembling the packages is as follows:\na) The lids are placed in the lid/preform alignment fixture,\nadhesive preforms are aligned on them, and then the fixture\nis placed on a hot plate at approximately 100\xc2\xb0C for a few\nminutes to tack the preforms to the lids. The fixture is\nthen removed from the hot plate and allowed to cool to\nroom temperature.\nb) The packages are then assembled in the package assembly/\nalignment fixture as shown in the series of photographs\nof Figure 4.\nStep 1 - A clamping plate is placed in the fixture with\nthe bottom side (the side that is recessed) up.\nStep 2 - A lid with attached preform is placed in the\nfixture with the side to which the preform is attached up.\nStep 3 - A package case is placed in the fixture with the\nbottom side up.\nStep 4 - A clamping plate is placed in the fixture top side up.\nSteps 5 and 6 - This assembly is then lightly tapped to\nensure that all parts are aligned and held together tightly\nwhile the clips are installed on the ends of the clamping\nplates.\nAll of the assembly procedure except aligning and tacking the\npreforms on the lids must be performed in the sealing chamber (nitrogen\ndry box with attached vacuum oven). The lid/preform alignment fixture\nis placed in the sealing chamber and the lids with attached preforms\nare removed from it and placed in the package assembly/alignment\nfixture using a vacuum pickup tool.\n\n11\n\na) Step 1\n\nb) Step 2\n\nc) Step\n\nd) Step 4\n\nf\n\na) Step 5\n\n> Step 6\n\nFigured Procedure for Assembling Packages\n\n12\n\nPhotographs of an assembled package in the package assembly/\nalignment fixture and in an oven tray are given in Figures 5 and 6.\nNote that the oven tray is designed so that the package assembly\ndoes not rest on the edges of the clips.\n2.1.1.3.3 Development of Adhesive Sealing Procedure\n2.1.1.3.3.1 Evaluation and Modification of Available Sealing Facility\nA dry run was made at completely processing packages in the sealing\nchamber (nitrogen dry box with attached vacuum oven) to reveal unanticipated problems before starting to seal the FASCOS hybrids. The complete\nprocedure that must be performed in this chamber is as follows:\n1) Bake out unlidded packages in vacuum (at <50 ym) for 4 hours\nat 150\xc2\xb0C.\n2) Transfer packages to attached nitrogen dry box, let cool, and\nassemble packages (cases, lids and adhesive preforms) in\nclamping fixtures.\n3) Cure clamped packages in the attached oven in nitrogen for 1-1/2\nhours at 165\xc2\xb0C.\nThe following problems were encountered:\n1) The vacuum oven must be used for both the vacuum bake-out and\nthe nitrogen cure. While the oven is equipped for backfilling\nwith nitrogen, minor modifications were required to provide the\nproper nitrogen flow rate to maintain a nitrogen atmosphere\nduring adhesive cure.\n2) During the course of this modification, it was realized that\nthe location of the thermocouple provided with the oven is\nimproper for the present application. This thermocouple simply\nhangs down from the top of the oven and measures the temperature established by radiation within the oven. The oven\ncontains two trays which sit on brackets attached to the oven\nwalls. Since, in the present case, the packages or the clamps\n\n13\n\nFigure 5. Assembled Package in Assembly/\nAlignment Fixture\n\nFigure 6. Assembled Package in Oven Tray\nReady for Cure\n14\n\nholding the packages are in intimate contact with the trays,\nthe major transfer of heat is by conduction through the\ntrays; so a thermocouple was attached to the center of an\naluminum strip spanning the oven between the brackets holding\nthe top tray. This thermocouple is almost exactly in the\ncenter of the oven, and the top tray sits on top of the\naluminum strip.\n(3) Also, it was found that the trays provided with the oven were\nslightly undersized and were too small to hold two assembled\npackages. Since it is desirable to process as many packages\nas possible at a time, new trays, each capable of holding\ntwo assembled packages, were fabricated. These trays were\nmade of aluminum to provide good thermal conduction, and\nhave a strip protruding from the bottom of their front end\nso that they can be firmly gripped with tongs since they are\nheavy when loaded and must be handled while hot. Photographs\nof one of the trays empty and with two assembled packages in\nit are shown in Figure 7.\nDuring this evaluation, it was realized that the two trays and\nfour assembled packages constitute considerable mass for the small\noven being used, so tests were run to determine the proper oven\ntemperature-controller set-points for baking-out unlidded packages\nin vacuum for 4 hours at 150\xc2\xb0C and for curing assembled packages in\nnitrogen for 1-1/2 hours at 165\xc2\xb0C. Since the oven is only six inches\nin diameter and 8 inches long, and consequently has a volume of only\n0.13 cubic feet, the nitrogen flow through the oven during cure was\nselected to be about 0.5 SCFH (standard cubic feet per hour).\n2.1.1.3.3.2 Selected Sealing Procedure\nThe bake-out and curing procedures selected as a result of these\ntests are as follows:\n1) Oven Preconditioning - The oven temperature-controller setpoint is always set at 175\xc2\xb0C with the oven empty and nitrogen\nflowing through it at about 0.5 SCFH. At this setting, the\noven stabilizes at a temperature of 170 to 172\xc2\xb0C.\n\n15\n\na) Empty\n\nb) With Two Assembled Packages\nFigure 7. Oven Tray\n16\n\n2) Vacuum Bake-Out - After the trays containing the unlidded\npackages are put in the oven and the oven evacuated , the\ntemperature drops to around 85\xc2\xb0C. The oven temperaturecontroller set-point is then raised to 200\xc2\xb0C and left there\nuntil the oven temperature reaches 148\xc2\xb0C. (This takes\napproximately one hour.) At this time, the oven temperaturecontroller set-point is lowered to 175\xc2\xb0C. (This set-point\nis adequate to maintain the oven temperature at 148 to 152\xc2\xb0C\nduring the 4 hour bake-out at a vacuum of less than 10 Torr.)\n3) Adhesive Cure - After the trays containing the clamped\nassembled packages are put in the oven, the temperature drops\nto around 75 C. The oven temperature-controller set-point\nis then raised to 200\xc2\xb0C and left there until the oven temperature reaches 163\xc2\xb0C. (This takes approximately 35 minutes.)\nAt this time, the oven temperature-controller set-point is\nlowered to 175 C. (This set-point is adequate to maintain\nthe oven temperature at 164 to 166\xc2\xb0C during the 1 1/2 hour\ncure with a nitrogen flow rate of about 0.5 (0.4 to 0.6) SCFH.)\n2.1.1.3.3.3 Verification of Selected Sealing Procedure\nEight empty nickel-plated Kovar packages were processed in the sealing\nchamber to verify the adequacy of the above procedures and to develop proper\nhandling techniques in preparation for baking-out and sealing the FASCOS\nhybrids. Processing proceeded smoothly and all packages passed the fine\nand gross leak tests. The measured fine leak rates were as shown in\nTable 2.. As can be seen, the leak rates of all packages were appreciably\nless than the 3 x 10 atm cc/sec air equivalent maximum leak rate specified\nfor the FASCOS hybrids.\n\n17\n\nTable 2.

These tests\nwere performed using a Thermal Mechanical Analyzer (TMA). In these tests,\na probe with a small tip was loaded with a 10 gram weight (corresponding\nto a force of approximately 22 psi) and placed on the surface of cured\nfilm-laminates. The laminate was 36 mils thick in the case of Ablefilm\n507 and 40 mils thick in the case of Ablefilm 552. The laminates were\ncured using the same curing schedules as those used for sealing packages\n(i.e., 1-1/2 hours at 165\xc2\xb0C for Ablefilm 507 and two hours at 150\xc2\xb0C\nfor Ablefilm 552). The temperature was then increased at a rate of\n10\xc2\xb0C/minute and recordings made of both the temperature and the vertical displacement of the probe as a function of time. Results are\ngiven in Figures 8 and 9.\nThe glass transition temperatures were found to be 83\xc2\xb0C for Ablefilm\n507 and 92\xc2\xb0C for Ablefilm 552. At these temperatures, the adhesives\nbegan to soften and the probe began to penetrate the laminate. The chart\nspeed was 10 mm/minute and since the heating rate was 10\xc2\xb0C/minute, 10 mm\non the horizontal axis also corresponds to 10\xc2\xb0C. Scaling from the Tg\nvalues, it is seen that the maximum displacement occurred around 110 or\n115 C for both adhesives. The subsequent reduction in the vertical\ndisplacement of the probe as the temperature was further increased does\nnot mean that the probe was not sinking farther into the adhesive, but\nrather that the adhesive laminate was expanding at a faster rate than\nthe probe was sinking into it. The results of these tests indicate that\ntemperatures of 100 to 150\xc2\xb0C would be optimum delidding temperatures.\nSince it would be much more convenient to delid the packages at\nroom temperature rather than at the elevated temperatures determined\nabove, tests were also made to determine its practicability. Two packages,\none sealed with each of the adhesives, were delidded. This was done by\nholding the package on end and carefully positioning a razor blade along\n\n19\n\nIT\n-t-"**\xe2\x80\xa2!-\n\n4.\n\n</>\nOJ\n\nc\no\n\n01\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2M\n\nl^> LO\n0 WD\nIf) r-\n\n/\n\nLI\n\n<O\n< S\n\nUJ\n\nJD O\nS- CSJ\n\n.o ^~\n\nI\xe2\x80\x94 <1J\nO TD\n\xe2\x80\xa2^~\n\n^J\n\n^ -C\nn3 (J\n4->\n\n(1) o\n\na. si\n\nd) VO\n\na: co\nCO\n\n2\n\nlN3W30VldSIQ\n\n20\n\nl/i\n\nin\n\nO)\n4->\n1\n0\n\ne\\j\n\nin. \xe2\x80\x94.\nin o\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 in\ni\xe2\x80\x94 (O\njQ\n\n<: w\nS- 3\nO O\n\n-\xc2\xbb-> eg\nt/\xc2\xbb\n0)\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\x94 <u\nc "3\no -o\n(O O\nS. l^\n\xe2\x80\xa24->\n(U CD\n\nc c\n\nO) -rO.

The razor blade\nwas then tilted at an angle of 30 to 45 while maintained in\nline with the adhesive bond-line and firmly pressed down. With\nthe razor blade correctly positioned, penetration of the adhesive\nseal was fairly easy, and the package was then delidded by simply\nrunning the razor blade down along the rim of the package. The\nadhesive adhering to the rim of the package and to the lid was also\nremoved at room temperature using a razor blade.\nIn removing the adhesive adhering to the rim of the package\nand to the lid, it was found that it was much more difficult to\nremove the Ablefilm 507 than it was to remove the Ablefilm 552.\nThis supports the conclusion reached in Section 2.1.1.1.3 that\n:Ablefilm 507 is a better package sealant than Ablefilm 552.\nHand delidding and adhesive removal as performed is not proposed\nas the delidding method. It not only is dangerous, but holding the\nrazor blade in precise alignment to avoid scraping the edge of the\npackage rim and generating metallic debris is much too difficult\nfor a hand operation. However, this effort did establish the\nfeasibility of delidding adhesive-sealed packages at room temperature\nand the desirableness of designing tooling to implement this method\nin a precisely-controlled manner.\n2.1.1.4.2 Design and Fabrication of Delidding Tool\n\nA tool for delidding packages at room temperature was designed\nand fabricated. The basic component is a manually operated precision\nslide mechanism as shown in Figure 10. This component and a high\nprecision micrometer were purchased. All other parts were fabricated\nin-house. A photograph of this tool with a partially delidded\npackage in it is shown in Figure 11. During delidding the package\nis held firmly in place in a vacuum chuck. The edge of the blade\nis accurately positioned on the adhesive bond line by adjusting the\nblade height using the high precision micrometer while viewing the\n\n22\n\nFigure 10. Manually Operated Precision Slide Mechanism for\nDelidding Tooling\n\n23\n\nFigure 11. Delidding Tool With Partially Delidded Package\n\n24\n\noperation with an ordinary stereo microscope. The force exerted\nby the drive mechanism of the delidding tool is sufficient to del id\nadhesive sealed packages at room temperature. Photographs showing\nclose-up views of the vacuum chuck and a partially delidded package\nare given in Figures 12 and 13.\nInitially, a double beveled cutting edge blade (i.e., a blade\nbeveled on both sides) was used in this tool. This blade worked\nsatisfactory for delidding packages sealed with Ablefilm 552 but\nnot for packages sealed with Ablefilm 507. It was determined that\nthis was due to the fact that after initial penetration of the\nadhesive at the corner of the package, the bevel on the bottom side\nof the blade caused the height of the cutting edge of the blade to\nincrease as it rode up on the rim of the package. This was not of\nconsequence in the case of packages sealed with Ablefilm 552\nbecause the seal apparently was weak enough that the flexing of\nthe lid exerted adequate force to break the adhesive bond all the\nway across the package. However, in the case of packages sealed\nwith Ablefilm 507, this was not so. The seal was strong enough\nthat the adhesive bond had to be cut, and as the height of the edge\nof the blade increased as it rode up on the rim of the package,\nthe blade cut into the package lid instead of the adhesive.\nThis problem was solved by using a single beveled cutting edge\nblade (i.e., a blade that is beveled only on one side and flat on\nthe other) with the beveled side up so that the blade does not ride\nup on the rim of the package. Fortunately, these blades were\nmanufactured by the same vendor from whom the double beveled blades\nwere obtained and were available in the same length.\nThis tool has reduced the delidding of adhesive sealed packages\nto a simple process. However, it is incapable of removing the cured\nadhesive that remains on the rims of the packages. Consideration\nshows that this should be expected. Design of a good delidding\ntool requires that the cutting edge of the blade must be essentially\n\n25\n\nFigure 12. Close-Up View of Vacuum Chuck In Which Package Is Held During Delidding\n\nFigure 13. Close-Up View of Partially Delidded Package\n26\n\nparallel with the bonded surfaces (i.e., the contact angle with the\npackage lid and rim surfaces must be essentially zero). Under this\ncircumstance, particularly since both sides of the blade are honed,\nthe cutting edge of the blade cannot directly contact either package\nsurface (the lid or the rim) and consequently tries to split the\nadhesive. While this occurs in some cases, in general, in the case\nof a film adhesive, the tendency is for the adhesive to tear loose\nfrom the surface to which it is more weakly bonded in any particular\narea. Thus, in general, when a package is delidded, it should be\nexpected that some of the adhesive will remain on the lid and some\nwill remain on the package rim.\n2.1.1.4.3 Removal of Cured Adhesive from Package Rims\nAn attempt was made to make a tool capable of removing the\ncured adhesive from the package rims. This tool has a rigidly\nsupported blade and was designed to provide a fairly large, adjustable\ncontact angle between the blade and the package rim. Since the\ncutting edge of the blade is honed on both sides (blades honed only\non one side are not available), the contact angle of the blade must\nbe adjusted so that the honed surface on the trailing edge of the\nblade is just parallel with the package rim. The optimum contact\nangle for removing the adhesive also appears to exist when this condition is just met. In this position, the blade just skims the\npackage rim and removes the adhesive without cutting into the rim.\nThis tool was designed to be used with the delidding tool. As\nshown in Figure 14, the delidding blade is removed and this tool is\nattached in its place. A close-up view of this tool removing Ablefilm 552 from the rim of a package is shown in Figure 15.\nThis tool was very successful in removing Ablefilm 552 from\npackage rims but was in general incapable of removing Ablefilm 507\nbecause of its much greater adhesion.\nThe method finally selected for removing cured Ablefilm 507\n\n27\n\nFigure 14. Delidding Tool With Adhesive-RemovalKnife Attachment\n\nFigure 15. Close-Up View Of Adhesive-Removal-\n\nKnife Attachment Removing Cured Adhesive\nFrom Package Rim\n28\n\nfrom the package rims was to lightly sand them using a very fine\ngrit (400 or 600) paper or crocus cloth. Due to the hardness of\nthe nickel plating, if the sanding is done carefully, only the cured\nadhesive is removed.\n2.1.2\n\nFabrication/Assembly and Testing of FASCOS^ Hybrids\n\n2.1.2.1 FASCOS Hybrid Fabrication/Assembly\nA revised version of the FASCOS assembly specification (VL 70033)\nwas written to reflect changes pertinent to the present study. This\nspecification (VL 70044) calls out the use of nickel-plated Kovar\npackage cases and lids and adhesive sealing, and permits delidding.\nAlso, the MO\'s (Manufacturing Orders) for the four different circuit\ntypes detailing the manufacturing processing and screen testing steps\nwere revised to include the required changes in the production procedures. In conjunction with this and in order to avoid possible\nconfusion with the production FASCOS circuits, new dash numbers were\nassigned to the circuits to be produced for this study. The part\nnumbers assigned were as follows:\nBite Control - Part No. 10090-516-21\nAnalog Bite - Part No. 10091-516-21\nSignal Conditioner #1 - Part No. 10092-516-21\nSignal Conditioner #2 - Part No. 10093-516-21\nLayouts for these hybrids are given in Figures 16 through 19 and the\nparts list is given in Table 3.\nThirty-two hybrids (8 of each of the 4 different types) were\nfabricated/assembled, tested, and reworked as required. Prior to\nsealing, the hybrids were functionally tested and visually inspected.\nAfter sealing, the hybrids were screen tested and functionally tested.\nA record of all operations performed including delidding and rework\nwas kept on individual record cards (travelers).\n\n29\n\ni\no\nen\no\no\n\n4-J\n\nO\n\nO\nO\nO)\n\nOJ\n01\n\n30\n\nCM\n\nLT>\n\n<T>\n\nra\n\nn.\nen\nen\no\n\nea\n\n31\n\nCVJ\n\nCTv\nO\nO\n\nrg=r-,=-.--^-,-\\\n\n.

During testing,\none hybrid failed the FIND test (one 10093) and six failed final\nfunctional (one 10090, one 10091, three 10092\'s, and one 10093).\n2.1.2.3 Adhesive Sealing and Seal Testing\nThe 32 FASCOS hybrids were baked-out and sealed with Ablefilm\n507 in accordance with the procedures described in Section 2.1.1.3.3.2.\nThese hybrids were then gross leak tested by immersing them for 30\nseconds in FC-40 maintained at 125 +_ 5\xc2\xb0C and checking for streams of\nbubbles as specified in Operation Number 47 of the MO\'s (Manufacturing\nOrders). All 32 hybrids passed this test (i.e., none of the hybrids\nwere gross leakers).\nAt this point, it was decided to perform a complete seal test\n(both fine and gross leak tests) before proceeding to the other screen\ntests. Testing was performed in accordance with Operation Number 72\nof the MO\'s. The hybrids were bombed in helium for 6 hours at 15 psig\nand then fine and gross leak tested. Nine hybrids failed the fine\nleak test (i.e., were found to have leak rates greater than 3 x 10"\natm cc/sec air equivalent), and these and 5 others failed the gross\nleak test. Thus, a total of 14 of the 32 FASCOS hybrids failed the\n36\n\nseal test. This result was certainly unexpected since 14 empty\nnickel-plated Kovar packages had previously been adhesive-sealed\nand all passed both the fine and gross leak tests (see sections\n2.1.1.1.3 and 2.1.1.3.3.3). Six of these (those of Section 2.1.1.1.3)\nwere even bombed at a higher pressure\xe2\x80\x9430 psig.\nIt was suspected that the explanation for the difference in\nthese results was the difference in the cleaning methods used in\nthe two cases. The empty packages had been sprayed with acetone,\nisopropyl alcohol, and Freon TF, and then cleaned with Freon TF in\nthe Branson cleaning console with ultrasonic agitation. The FASCOS\nhybrids (cases containing circuits) were simply cleaned with Freon TF\nin the Branson cleaning console without ultrasonic agitation, and\nthe lids were cleaned with deionized water and with Freon TF in the\nBranson cleaning console with ultrasonic agitation. Since acetone\nis a very polar solvent, it removes contaminants such as greases\nthat may get on the package rims by inadvertently touching them with\nthe fingers during fabrication/assembly and/or pre-seal functional\ntesting and visual inspection.\nWhen the 14 hybrids that failed the seal test were delidded,\nalmost all of the adhesive remained on the lids in all cases. This\nwas also the case for the hybrid that failed the PIND test. However,\nfor the hybrid that failed final functional, the adhesive was\ndistributed about 50/50 between the lid and package rim. This\nsupported the speculation that the seal test failures were due to\nthe fact that the package rims were inadvertently contaminated and\nthat the packages were not cleaned adequately prior to sealing.\nAs a result, the following improved cleaning procedure was\nselected and used for the 16 hybrids that had to be resealed:\na) Lids\n\n1. Cleaned in deionized water with ultrasonic agitation\n2. Rinsed in acetone\n37\n\n3. Rinsed in isopropyl alcohol\n4. Cleaned in Freon TF in the Branson cleaning console\nwith ultrasonic agitation.\nb)\n\nPackages\n1. Rims wiped with cotton swab dipped in acetone\n2. Rims wiped with cotton swab dipped in isopropyl\nalcohol\n3. Cleaned in Freon TF in the Branson cleaning console\nwithout ultrasonic agitation.\n\nAfter sealing, these packages were bombed in helium for 6 hours at\n15 psig and fine and gross leak tested. All 16 packages passed both\nthe fine and gross leak tests. Measured fine leak rates ranged from\n1.1 x 10-8 to 1.7 x 10-7 atm cc/sec air equivalent, which is well\nbelow the 3 x 10" atm cc/sec air equivalent requirement specified.\nThe 100% sealing yield obtained was very encouraging and indicated\nthat the new cleaning procedure had solved the sealing problem.\nHowever, after all hybrids were completed, two sets of hybrids\n(8 hybrids\xe2\x80\x942 each of the 4 different types) selected for assembly on\nthe multiwire boards were final seal tested (i.e., both fine and gross\nleak tested) as required prior to final acceptance. Five of these\n8 hybrids failed. Four failed the fine leak test (could not be pumped\ndown), and three of these and one that passed the fine leak test,\nfailed the gross leak test. Since these hybrids had passed the gross\nleak test after lead forming, and had simply been stored at room\nambient prior to seal testing, it was concluded that the failures\nwere caused by the stresses imposed during fine leak testing.\nThis result was unexpected and disappointing since these hybrids\n(and all other hybrids) had passed both fine and gross leak tests\nimmediately after sealing. Since it is felt that the hybrids are\nbeing cleaned and sealed as well as they can be, it must be concluded\nthat adhesive sealed packages of this size ( 1 x 2 inches) cannot\nwithstand the stresses imposed during the fine leak test, even at a\nbombing pressure of only 15 psig.\n38\n\nA review of the fine leak test procedure shows that the\nstresses exerted on the adhesive seal are substantial even for\nthis condition (bombing at 15 psig). Initially, the hybrids are\nplaced in a chamber that is rapidly pressurized with helium to\n15 psig and then vented to the atmosphere several times (at least\nthree) to fill it with essentially pure helium at 30 psia (15 psig).\nThis causes relatively rapid flexing of the package lids and exerts\npeel-tensile stresses alternately on the outer and inner edges of\nthe adhesive seal. The hybrids are then maintained at this condition (i.e., pressurized at 15 psig helium) for 6 hours. This causes\na sustained peel-tensile stress on the outer edge of the adhesive\nseal and forces helium into the hybrid package. The chamber is\nthen vented to atmospheric pressure, and the hybrids are removed\nand their leak rates measured. This consists of placing the hybrid\npackages in a chamber and evacuating it. This causes a peel-tensile\nstress on the inner edge of the adhesive seal proportional to the\ninternal pressure of the hybrid package. The internal pressure is\natmospheric pressure plus a delta due to the helium forced into\nthe package during the 6 hour bombing period.\nApparently, in many cases, one or another of these stresses\nor the combination of all of them is adequate to weaken and finally\ndestroy the integrity of the adhesive seals of the relatively large\n1 x 2 inch packages being used in this study.\nAs a result of this fact and since adhesive sealed packages\nare not hermetic in any case, it is recommended that the fine leak\ntest requirement be eliminated for adhesive sealed packages of this\nsize and require only that they pass the gross leak test. This\nrequirement is adequate to ensure that the hybrids are protected\nfrom liquid and particulate contaminants.\n2.1.2.4 Summary of Test Failuresand Rework Performed\nThe failures that occurred during production of the 32 adhesivesealed FASCOS hybrids are shown in Table 4.\n39\n\nTable 4.\n\nHybrids\nManufactured\n\nSummary of Test Failures\nfor Adhesive-Sealed Hybrids\n\nPIND\n\nFinal\nFunctional\n\nTest\n\nInitial\nSeal Test\n\nTest\n\nFinal\nFunctional\n, Seal Test\nTest\nFinal\n\n(After Rework)\n10090-516-21-01E\n-02E*\n-03E\n-04E\n-05E\n-06E\n-07E\n-08E\n\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\nF\nF\n\nF\nF\nF\n\n10091-516-21-01E\n-02E*\n-03E\n-04E\n-05E\n-06E*\n-07E\n-08E\n\n.1\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nF\n\nF\n\n10092-516-21-01E*\n-02E\n-03E\n-04E\n-05E\n-06E\n-07E\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF (Repeat)\n\nF\nF\nI\ni\n\nF\nF\n\nF\n\nF\nF\nF\n\ni;\nF\n\n-08E*\n\nF\n\n10093-516-21-01E*\n\nF\n\nF\nF\n\n-02E*\n-03E\n-04E\n-05E\n-06E\n-07E\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\nF\n\n-08E\n\n!\n\nindicates those hybrids that had to be reprocessed (reworked) twice,\n40\n\nF\n\nAs discussed in the previous section (Section 2.1.2.3), all\n32 hybrids initially passed the gross leak test as required, but\n14 (those listed in Column 2 of Table 4) subsequently failed after\nbeing bombed in helium for 6 hours at 15 psig. These hybrids were\nreprocessed (i.e., delidded, cleaned, visually inspected, and\nrelidded) and reseal tested. All passed.\nAll 32 hybrids were then screen, final functional, and final\nseal tested. One failed the PINO test, four failed the final\nfunctional test, and ten failed the final seal test as shown in\nColumns 3, 4, and 5 respectively of Table 4. These hybrids were\ndelidded, reworked as required, relidded, and retested. As shown\nin Column 6 of Table 4, three failed final functional. All passed\nthe final seal test (gross leak test only).\nA review of Table 4 shows that 22 of the 32 hybrids had to\nbe reworked, and that 7 of them had to be reworked twice (those\nindicated by an asterisk). Of these required reworks, all but 5\n(1 PIND test failure and 4 final functional test failures) were\ndue to failure of the adhesive seals as discussed in Section\n2.1.2.3. The 3 hybrids that failed the final functional test\nafter being reworked (listed in Column 6 of Table 4) were not\nreworked again, so only 29 of the 32 FASCOS hybrids produced were\nfunctionally good.\n\n41\n\n2.1.3\n2.1.3.1\n\nFabrication and Testing of FASCOS Modules\nBrief Description of Multiwire^Technology\n\nBasically the Multiwire process consists of writing the circuit on\na dielectric substrate with insulated magnet wire. The writing is done\nprecisely with a numerically-controlled machine. A typical Multiwire\nmachine with computer numerical control units is shown in Figure 20\nand a closeup view of a Multiwire machine head writing a circuit by\nlaying down insulated wire on an adhesive coated substrate is shown\nin Figure 21. The wire used is NEMA No. 34 AWG Class 220 Polyimide\nHeavy Coated magnet wire (i.e., copper wire approximately 7 mils in\ndiameter with 0.6 mil thick polyimide insulation). This wire is electrically equivalent to a 12-mil wide line of 2-ounce copper or a 24-mil\nwide line of 1-ounce copper. Since the wire is insulated, direct\ncrossovers can be made without fear of shorting. A magnified view\nof a cross section of a typical wire crossover is shown in Figure 22.\nThe essentially 1-mil polyimide insulation separating the wires has\na minimum breakdown voltage in excess of 2000 volts. Although only\nsingle crossovers are all that are required on typical multiwire boards,\nthe number of crossovers allowed is essentially unlimited.\nThe six steps involved in producing multiwire boards are shown\nin Figure 23 and are as follows:\nStep 1. Using standard printed circuit techniques, etch\ncopper-clad epoxy glass laminate to form power and\nground plane and contact fingers as desired.\nStep 2. Apply partially cured layer of thermosetting adhesive\nto board. Do not cover contact fingers and card-guide\nareas.\nStep 3. Place the board on the computer controlled Multiwire\nwiring machine and put down wire pattern. (Each wire\nbegins and ends at a hole location and may intersect\nany number of hole locations making up the net.)\n*This information and the photographs were taken from the Multiwire\nReference Guide issued by the Multiwire Division of Kollmorgan\nCorporation.\n\n42\n\nFigure 20.\n\nFigure 21.\n\nTypical Multiwire Machine with\nComputer Numerical Control Units\n\nClose-Up View of Multiwire Machine\nWriting a Circuit\n43\n\nFigure 22.\n\nMagnified View of Cross Section of\nof Typical Wire Crossover\n\n44\n\nStep 1.

Fabricate Board\nWires, Drill\nin Holes\nHoles\nFigure 23.\n\nProcess for Producing Multiwire Boards\n\n45\n\nStep 4. Cover the board with a thin epoxy prepeg, press the\nwires into the adhesive, and cure the adhesive to\nencapsulate the circuit. Then drill the component\nholes on the computer controlled machine.\nStep 5. Deposit copper in holes by electroless additive plating\nprocess. This process bonds each wire end to the wall\nof the hole.\nStep 6. Fabricate board using routine printed circuit manufacturing methods.\nThe Multiwire boards are then tested for opens using a chemical\ndischarge tester as shown in Figure 24. This test consists of placing\na specially sensitized paper on the board and applying a voltage to\nthe first hole in each wire net. If no opens exist, an image of the\ncomplete circuit will be reproduced on the paper. If an open exists\nin any wire net, an image of the portion of that wire net after the\nopen will not be reproduced.\nAt the present time, there are three practical limitations\nassociated with Multiwire board technology that impact the present\napplication (i.e., replacing the present FASCOS multilayer board\nwith a Multiwire board.) These are:\n1) All components must be attached by inserting the leads\nin through holes. The adhesion of free standing conductor pads is insufficient for lead attachment.\n2) Components can be mounted on only one side of the boards.\n3) While smaller spacing is permissible, the manufacturer\n(Multiwire/West) recommends that holes be placed on 100-mil\ncenters.\n2.1.3.2 Design and Fabrication of Multiwire Boards\nSince components are mounted on both sides of the present FASCOS\nmultilayer board and can only be mounted on one side of a multiwire\n46\n\nFigure 24. Chemical Discharge Tester\n\n47\n\nboard, the present multilayer board constituting a FASCOS Module\ncannot simply be duplicated as a multiwire board.\nThe present multilayer board contains eight hybrids (two each of the four\ndifferent types) and the additional components required to comprise\ntwo control channels. The hybrids are symmetrically distributed\nbetween the two sides of the board (i.e., one hybrid of each of the\nfour different types is mounted on each side of the board) but the\nadditional components are not. Also, some interconnections between\nthe hybrids are made through the multilayer board. Because of these\nfacts, the multilayer board cannot simply be divided into two multiwire boards where one board duplicates one of its sides and the other\nboard duplicates the other. Instead, the multilayer board had to be\nessentially completely redesigned. This involved relocating some\ncomponents and rerouting some interconnections to divide the present\nmultilayer board into two identical multiwire boards containing four\nhybrids (one each of the four different types) and the additional\ncomponents required to comprise a single control channel.\nThe schematic for the multiwire boards is given in Figure 25.\nThese boards are identical in size with the present multilayer board\nas required and two of them can be interconnected to provide the\nsame function. The fabrication drawing showing the board dimensions\nis given in Figure 26 and the layout of the board showing the hole\nlocations on the component side is given in Figure 27. Redesign of\nthe board also required redesign of the power and ground plane as\nshown in Figure 28, and generation of a new list (X-Y interconnect\ndata).\nAll necessary information for fabricating the multiwire boards\n[fabrication drawing, board layout, power and ground plane artwork\n(IX), net list (X-Y interconnect data), and hole coordinate drill\ntape] was delivered to Multiwire West.\nA photograph of the finished FASCOS multiwire board as received\nfrom Multiwire West is shown in Figure 29.\n\n48\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \'**\xe2\x80\xa2*\xc2\xbb\n*\n\nMXLM\xc2\xbb4.rm\nM.o.t,.\n\nuir\nC\n\n4,\'\n\n4_*?4\xe2\x80\x94 *ccv.m\xc2\xbb*T\xc2\xab\nfill n\xc2\xbbe.lu>i\n\n***\n\n~*t\n\n^\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n1\n\n* \\\n\n/rH\n\nM\n\n\'o*\n\nT\n\n*\n\ni\n\nJ\n*\n\nrow.\n\nr * c\xc2\xab\n\n> =\n=\n\n<"\xc2\xbb\n\n\'\xc2\xa3\xc2\xbb\n1\n\n1" !\xc2\xbb\'\n\n< *l\n\n<\n\nN[\n\n1 i\n\n~V\n\n\xc2\xab-*\n\n*\n\nJ\nx-\n\n\'*\'\'\'\n\n<\n\n\'4\n\nM\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n\xe2\x82\xac\n\ni\n\n\'5*\n\nI <#\xc2\xbb\n; J\n\n\' \'?\n\n\'?\n\n"\n\nIL\n\n1$\n\nenu\n\n^<x\xc2\xbb\n\n\xc2\xabY A\n\n\xc2\xbb:T| C O N T X X\n\n"*\n\n>tr\n\nPAKTOFPI\n\' rrfl\n\n~\n\n"^ ~~^\n\n_^\n\nU9J,\n\nf\n\nx\n\nr\n\n<j\xc2\xbb-*-\n\ni\n\n1-4*\n\nJ-T-l-\n\n. 67\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HI\n\nI\n\nMT1XO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'/\xe2\x80\xa21\n*\xc2\xab\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94^\n\nU7\n\n*\n\n\xc2\xab4I\n\nU9\n\nirrn\n\nMI\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n3\n]\n\nplS\xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xabM\xc2\xab4-\xc2\xbb\n\n!\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab>\nJL\xc2\xbb\n\nJ^\n\n-IJ\xc2\xabOC\n\n^Tt^T\n\n.voe\n^.a.\n\n^.JV.\n( \xc2\xbb\'\n\n-1\n\n1*\xc2\xab0\xc2\xab\n\nf,l\n\n..-.,\xc2\xbb\xc2\xab\nLf .-L c\xc2\xbb\n\nilKOW JS\n\n\xc2\xab\xc2\xab\n\n^\n\nl\n\nI\'M\n\nA\xe2\x80\x94-^^\n\n_M\n\n1104\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nfp\xe2\x80\x94^\nK- ^\n\n"\'*\n\nf\xc2\xabT\njcoofxiu\n\n< ** 1\n\nV\n\n-\n\n;\n\n-11\n\n1\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94 </W*\n\n\xc2\xbbt\xc2\xbbOC\n\n^\n\ncs-L .\n_!l\n\n<" 1\n\n*\n\n\xc2\xab*\n\n4J\n\n1\n\n:\n\n. 30 i\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr\xc2\xbb\xc2\xab\xc2\xab\n\nr\n\nOCTIM\n\nVW\n\n*ts\n\n*VV\n\n*ur\n\nWV\n\nvJ^\xe2\x80\x94V&\n\n_U\n\n\xc2\xabMC\n\n*S\xc2\xabK\n\nl(\n\n\xc2\xbb<JSL^i_\n\n1\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n, !\n\nc\xc2\xbb\n\n\xc2\xabcJ if\n\n-i-\n\n11\n\n\'-\'\n\n\xc2\xabsvcx;\n\nUIT 1\n\nJ\n\n4\n\nJ0_\n\nV ^~~\n\n/\n\n^S,\n\n*T^\n\nfJl\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr-V&\n\n_*__! iji/\'t >o*\n\n1*\n\n;\n\nr-^A^\n\nX\n\n*z>\n\n_J\n-S\n\nM\n\nen\n\n, Tf4\n1 ..J^\'O*\n\n\'\nn\n\n\' "\n\nI*\n\nNC\n\nS *\'*\n\n1\n\nJ\n\ns\n\n>- * ~\n>\n1 r\\^\n\nCi_L_ i RI0\n\n/77\n\nIU-O\nT tx\n\nS4JS\xc2\xbb|M|*_ja\n\nm<\n\n->-\n\nV\n\nC1B\n51O\n\xe2\x80\xa2 IAOC\n\n-OVOC\n\n|t\xc2\xbb\n\njo\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 UVDC\n\nuq\n\n|\xc2\xab\n\n-ItVOC\n\n*\xc2\xabVDC\n\n14\n\n|is\n\n.

FASCOS Multiwire Board\n53\n\n2.1.3.3 Design and Fabrication_of Lead Forming_Too1\nA tool to form the leads of the FASCOS hybrid packages as\nrequired so that they can be inserted in the multiwire boards was\ndesigned and fabricated. An expanded view of this tool and a 74\nlead FASCOS package is shown in Figure 30. This tool was designed\nfor use with both the 38 lead and the 74 lead FASCOS packages.\nThe leads of the 38 lead packages are on 100 mil centers while\nthose of the 74 lead packages are on 50 mil centers. The multiwire\nboard was designed with holes on 100 mil centers as recommended by\nthe manufacturer (Multiwire West). All that is required to form\nthe leads of the 38 lead packages is that the packages be clamped\nin the fixture and the leads bent over as shown in Figure 31. For\nthe 74 lead packages, the leads must be staggered to give two rows\nof leads on 100 mil centers. This is done as shown in Figure 32.\nFirst, the tool is used as for the 38 lead packages and every other\nlead is bent over as shown in Figure 32a. Then the side plates of\nthe tool are added and the remaining leads are bent over as shown in\nFigure 32b.\n2.1.3.4 Assembly^and Testing of Multiwire Boards\nTwo multiwire boards were assembled and tested. Component\nplacement is shown in the assembly aid given in Figure 33 and the\ncomponents are identified in the parts list (Table 5). A photograph\nof one of the assembled multiwire boards is shown in Figure 34.\nA special wiring harness was fabricated to interconnect the\ntwo multiwire boards so that they functionally duplicated a FASCOS\nmultilayer board and could be tested in the FASCOS engineering system.\nA photograph of the two multiwire boards connected together by the\nwiring harness is shown in Figure 35, and a photograph of the boards\nbeing tested on the ADIT Console (Analog-Digital Tester) is shown in\nFigure 36.\n\n54\n\nFigure 30.

Multiwire Boards Being\nFunctionally Tested on\nADIT Console\n\n60\n\nInitial testing revealed that one of the boards had a high\nresistance short on the fuel cutoff (FCO) line. After correcting\nthis problem by simply cutting the board wire and soldering in an\nexternal wire, the multiwire boards passed the complete functional\ntest with all parameters well within the specified tolerances.\nThe engineer performing the testing indicated that the multiwire boards were much easier to troubleshoot and repair than the\nmultilayer boards.\n\n61\n\n2.2 PHASE II - COST COMPARISON\n\n\'\n\nThe hybrid-packaging approach investigated in this study\nusing adhesive package sealing, nickel-plated Kovar packages and\nlids, and multiwire boards was compared to the conventional hybridpackaging approach using metallurgical package sealing (seam welding),\ngold-plated Kovar packages and lids, and multilayer boards to determine\nthe cost savings achieved. Separate comparisons were made for the\nFASCOS hybrids and for the FASCOS modules. In these comparisons, no\nattempt was made to determine the total costs but only to identify\nthe potentially important cost factors and to ascertain the corresponding\ncost deltas attributable to these three specific changes. For the\nFASCOS hybrids, the potentially important cost factors were identified\nto be (1) the packages and lids, (2) the sealing procedure, (3) sealing\nyields, and (4) delidding/relidding. For the FASCOS modules, the\npotentially important cost factors were identified to be (1) ;design and\nboard costs, (2) implementation of design changes, and (3) board rework/\nrepair. These cost factors are discussed below.\n2.2.1 FASCOS Hybrids\n2.2.1.1 Packages and Lids .\nCurrent prices (June 1981) for the types of packages and\nlids used for the FASCOS hybrids were obtained from Isotronics\nfor two different quantities (25 to 49 and 100 to 249). Prices\nfor the two package types (IP-1620A-1 and IP-1620A-2) are given in\nTable 6, and prices for both stepped and flat lids (15 mils thick)\nare given in Table 7. Prices are given for both gold-plated and\nnickel-plated Kovar packages and lids. In the case of packages,\n"selective plated" means that the package cases are nickel plated\nand the leads are gold plated.\nIsotronics quotes their prices by giving the base price\nand a factor for gold over $500/oz.

The\npackage cases containing the hybrid circuits and the lids are vacuum\nbaked overnight (16 hours) at 150\xc2\xb0C and then transferred to an\nattached nitrogen dry box and seam welded using a Solid-State\nEquipment Corporation seam sealer. The time required to seal a >\npackage varies, depending on the size of the package, but is\ncertainly no more than three to six minutes. Moisture/gas analysis\nof the internal atmospheres of the sealed packages shows that they\nare very clean and dry.\nThe procedure required for adhesive sealing packages is more\ncomplex, takes longer, requires special fixturing, and is more labor\nintensive. The procedure used in this study is as follows:\n(a) The adhesive preforms are aligned on the lids in a\nspecial fixture and heated on a hot plate at approximately\n100PC for a few minutes to tack them in place. This\nprocedure is unnecessary for small packages ( 1 x 1 inch or\nless) but is essential for larger packages such as those\nused for the FASCOS hybrids ( 1 x 2 inches).\n65\n\n(b) The lids with attached adhesive preforms are then placed\nin the nitrogen dry box attached to the oven in which\nthe package cases containing the hybrid circuits are\nbeing vacuum baked.\n(c) After the package cases have completed vacuum bake and\ncooled, the packages are assembled in a fixture to ensure\nalignment of the package cases and lids and then clamped\ntogether to hold them in alignment during adhesive cure.\n(d) The clamped packages are then returned to the oven and\nbaked in a nitrogen atmosphere at 165\xc2\xb0C for 90 minutes\nto cure the adhesive.\nMoisture/gas analysis of the internal atmospheres of the sealed\npackages immediately after sealing shows that, while they contain\napproximately 93-percent nitrogen, they also contain large amounts\nof hydrogen, methane, water vapor, carbon dioxide, acetone, xand MEK,\nand small amounts of oxygen and methanol.\nAs is obvious from this discussion, it is very difficult to\ndetermine the exact cost difference between seam welding and\nadhesive sealing the FASCOS hybrids, but adhesive sealing is certainly\nmore labor intensive and, consequently, at least as costly as seam\nsealing. Other factors may justify the use of adhesive sealing in\nparticular applications, but reduction of the cost of sealing does not.\n2.2.1.3 Sealing Yields\nThe sealing yield during FASCOS hybrid production using seam\nwelding was approximately 92 percent. Since delidding/relidding was\nnot allowed, this contributed an increase of approximately 9 percent\nto the cost of the FASCOS hybrids.\nFor the first group of adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids, 14 of\n32 failed the seal test immediately after sealing after being bombed\nin helium for six hours at 15 psig. Thus, the sealing yield was only\napproximately 56 percent. As a result of this very disappointing\nexperience, an improved method of cleaning the lids and the rims of\n66\n\nthe package cases prior to sealing was developed, and 16 hybrids\nwere resealed and seal tested immediately after sealing. A 100percent sealing yield was obtained; that is, all .16 of these hybrids\npassed both fine and gross leak tests after being bombed in helium\nfor six hours at 15 psig. Consequently, it was assumed that the\nsealing problem had been solved. However, after screen testing,\nthe eight hybrids (two each of the four different types) selected\nfor assembly on the multiwire boards were final seal tested. Five\nof these eight hybrids failed, giving a yield of only 37.5 percent.\nOf the five hybrids that failed, two had been resealed using\nthe improved cleaning method, and-three had been sealed using the\noriginal cleaning method. Of the three hybrids that passed, two\nhad been sealed using the original cleaning method, and one\nhad been sealed using the improved cleaning method. So the failure\nrate was three of five (60 percent) for the hybrids sealed using\nthe original cleaning method and two of three (67 percent) for the\nhybrids sealed using the improved cleaning method. This showed\nthat the cleaning method was not the important factor that it was\noriginally thought to be.\nSince it is felt that the hybrids are being cleaned and sealed\nas well as they can be, it must be concluded that, due to their\nsize (1 x 2 inches), adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids are unable to\nwithstand the stresses imposed during the fine leak test, even\nfor a bombing pressure of only 15 psig. As a result of this fact,\nand since adhesive-sealed packages are not hermetic in any case, it\nis suggested that the fine leak test requirement for adhesive-sealed\npackages of this size be eliminated and that only the gross leak\n* test be required. Experience indicates that, under this condition,\nessentially a 100-percent sealing yield can be expected.\n2.2.1.4 Deliddinq/Relidding\nData for the FASCOS production hybrids and the yields obtained\nare given in Table 8.\nThe yields in percent are calculated by\ndividing the number delivered by the sum of the number delivered\nand the number scrapped and multiplying by 100. Due to the\ncomplexity of the hybrids and the fact that they cannot be delidded\nand reworked, the yields are low as shown.\n67\n\nOJ\n\nc\n\nen\nCM\n\nCO\n\no\no\n\nco\nen\no\no\n\nl\xc2\xa3>\n\nCM\n\nen\n\nUD\n\nco\nco\n\n1\n0\n\nCM\nLf>\n\nen\n\no\n\nco\n\n-o\n-Q\nCM\n\nc\no\n\ncn\no\ni- o\n\nCO\n\nen\n\nO\n\nco\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\nO\n\n-a\no\nS-\n\na.\n\ns_\n\nco\no\no\nco\n\nQ- en\no\no\n\n(O\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\no\n\nLO\n\nLO\n\no\n1\n10\n\no\nen\no\no\n\nen\n<\xc2\xa3>\n\nco\n\n10\n\na>\n\nS0)\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\neu\n\ni/)\na>\n\nTJ\n\nO)\n\ns_\n>\n\n(U\n\n(U\nQ\n\nex\nQ.\n\n>\n\ns_\nU\nCO\n\n68\n\nT3\n\nOJ\n(U\nQ\n\nProduction Operations personnel feel that if only one\ndelidding and rework were allowed, the scrap rate could be reduced\nby approximately 70 percent. If this is true, then the yields\nwould be increased from 67 to 90 percent for Part No. 10090, from\n75 to 92 percent for Part No. 10091, from 59 to 88 percent for Part\nNos. 10092 and 10093, and the combined yield would be increased from\n64 to 89 percent. Assuming that delidding, reworking, relidding,\nand retesting the hybrids would cost only approximately 25 percent\nof making new hybrids, the cost savings if only one delidding were\nallowed would be approximately 21 percent. Further savings would .\nbe achieved if more than one delidding and rework were allowed.\nFor example, if the same assumptions are made as previously, allowing\ntwo deliddings would increase the combined yield to 97 percent and\nresult in a cost savings of approximately 26 percent.\nEssentially, this same cost savings would be achieved if the\nFASCOS packages were adhesive sealed and delidding were allowed.\nDelidding adhesive-sealed packages and cleaning the adhesive from\nthe rims of the package cases require essentially the same effort\nas delidding seam-sealed packages and refinishing the rims of the\npackage cases.\nAs shown in the above discussion, allowing delidding of the\nFASCOS hybrids would result in substantial savings\xe2\x80\x94reducing the\ncost by 21 to 26 percent. If the present average cost of a FASCOS\nhybrid is $1,000, allowing delidding would reduce the cost to $740\nto $790. Based on these results and the present level of success\nachieved in delidding seam-welded packages, the permissibility of\ndelidding seam-welded FASCOS packages should be reconsidered.\n2.2.2\n\nFASCOS Modules\n\n2.2.2.1 Design and Board Costs\nThe multilayer version of the FASCOS Signal Conditioner/Logic\nControl board was designed by Algorex Corporation (Syosset, New\nYork) and fabricated by Cirtel, Inc. (Irvine, California). During\nthe design phase, close liaison was maintained between Rockwell\n69\n\nengineering personnel and Algorex design personnel, and drawings\nwere checked by Rockwell engineering personnel at various stages\nof the design to ensure that the final board would meet Rockwell\nrequirements. This effort required approximately 160 man-hours ,\nof Rockwell engineering time, and charges by Algorex totaled\napproximately $12,500 of which approximately half ($6,000) was\ndue to Rockwell-initiated design changes. Initial fabrication\nof seven prototype boards by Cirtel cost approximately $10,500\nincluding a nonrecurring charge of approximately $1,000 and\n$1,350 each for the boards. The fabrication of 14 heat sinks\n(two per board) costing approximately $100 each was included\nin this charge. Subsequent charge for 24 production .boards was\napproximately $800 each.\nThe multiwire version of this board was designed by Rockwell\nengineering personnel. The total effort required was approximately 120 man-hours. Two boards were fabricated by Multiwire/\nWest for\\a total cost of $1,185. This cost included a nonrecurring charge of $785 for digital and graphic tooling and $200\neach for the boards. For a production run of 48 boards (which\nis equivalent to the production run of 24 multilayer boards\nsince two multiwire boards are required to perform the same\nfunction as one multilayer board), Multiwire/West quoted a\n:\nprice of approximately $70 per board.\nThe above cost information for the design and fabrication\nof the multilayer and multiwire boards is summarized in Table 9\nfor convenient reference. In both cases (i.e., for both the\nmultilayer and the multiwire boards), it was assumed that the\ncircuit schematic and parts list were available and their\ngeneration is not included in the design costs.\nAs is evident from this discussion, the design and\nfabrication costs are much less for the multiwire board than\nfor the multilayer board. This is generally true, just as\nit is true that a single-sided printed circuit board is less\nexpensive than a double-sided printed circuit board and that\n70\n\nTable 9.

It is a generally accepted \\fact\n.*\n- . \'\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\nthat multilayer boards are expensive; however, it also is a\ngenerally accepted fact that, in spite of this, total system\nrequirements sometimes dictate their use. For example, in\nthe present case, it has been shown that the FASCOS Signal\nConditioner/Logic Control board which is presently an expensive eight-layer multilayer board with components mounted on\nboth sides can be replaced by two inexpensive multiwire boards\nwith components mounted oh only one side. This apparently\nwould result in considerable cost savings. However,,before\nthis conclusion is established as fact, the compatibility of\nsuch a change with the size, weight, and performance\'(reliability ) requirements of the FASCOS system should be determined.\nIn conclusion of this discussion, it is apparent that\nmultiwire boards are a highly competitive alternate to multilayer boards and probably also to most double-sided printed\ncircuit boards and should be seriously considered as a-substitute for them to reduce overall system cost and improve system\nreliability.\n2.2.2.2 Implementation of Design Changes\nDesign changes that do not affect the power and ground\nplane are easily made for multiwire boards. All that is\nrequired is that appropriate changes be made in the computer\nprograms that control the wiring head and drilling machine.\nDesign changes are much more difficult to make and are substantially more expensive for multilayer boards. Changes\nmust be made on the master drawings and new artwork generated.\nEven changes that appear to be relatively minor may require\nextensive changes in interconnection routing on the various\nlayers to avoid crossovers.\nThe ease with which design changes can be made is\nunquestionably the greatest advantage of multiwire technology\nover multilayer technology. Any wire routing change can be\n\n72\n\nmade with minimum effort and is of no concern since the wires\nused are insulated and may cross over each other without fear\nof shorting. In multilayer technology, changes in interconnection\nrouting must be carefully considered and can entail substantial\neffort and expense.\n2.2.2.3 Board Rework/Repair\nIn general, two types of rework/repair problems occur: 1)\nthe removal and replacement of a failed component and 2) the\nrerouting or replacement of a wire (interconnection). Both of\nthese types of rework/repair are more easily performed on a\nmultiwire board than on a multilayer board.\nSince the component leads are attached in plated-through\nholes on the multiwire boards, components can be removed by\nunsoldering their leads just as is done for a two-sided printed\ncircuit board. The plated-through holes of the multiwire board\ncan tolerate this procedure just as well as the plated-through\nholes of regular printed circuit boards. For multilayer boards\nwhen a soldering iron is applied to remove a lead from a surface\nmounted pad, the pad often is detached from the board and a more\ndifficult repair problem is created.\nWire rerouting or replacement can also be performed more\neasily on a multiwire board than on a multilayer board since\nall the wires are visible on a multiwire board. The wire\n.that is to be rerouted/replaced is simply cut with an X-acto\nknife and a very small section removed. A small wire is then\nsoldered between the desired terminals to complete the correction.\nWhile a repair of this type is not allowed on deliverable boards,\nit is a valuable feature and can result in substantial cost and\ntime savings during the prototype system stages.\n\n73\n\n2.3\n\nPHASE.Ill - RELIABILITY,EVALUATION\n\nDuring this phase of the study, the reliability of the adhesivesealed FASCOS hybrids was evaluated by subjecting them to the ten-day\nmoisture resistance test and the 1000-hour life test and then electrically testing them to determine if their functional performance\nwas within specification. Mass spectrometric analyses were also\nperformed on these hybrids and others to determine the composition\nof their internal atmospheres. The results of these tests follow.\n2.3.1\n\nReliability of Adhesive-Sealed FASCOS Hybrids\n\n2.3.1.1 Ten-Day Moisture Resistance Test\nFour adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids were subjected to the tenday moisture resistance test per Method 1004.2 of MIL-STD-883 to\ndetermine the effect of high temperature/humidity on their functional\nperformance. One hybrid of each of the four different types were\ntested (Part Nos. 10090-516-21-03E, 10091-516-21-03E, 10092-516-21-07E,\nand 10093-516-21-07E). After exposure, all four hybrids passed the\nelectrical functional performance requirements well within specified\ntolerance at both test temperatures (0\xc2\xb0C and 60\xc2\xb0C) and the continuity\nand isolation test at 25\xc2\xb0C.\n2.3.1.2\n\n1000-Hour Life Test\n\nEight adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids (two of each of the four\ndifferent types) were life tested for 1000 hours at 125\xc2\xb0C \xc2\xb1 5\xc2\xb0C with\nsteady-state power applied to them as specified in the Functional\nTest Specifications (VL00257, VL00258, VL00259, and VL00260) and as\nshown in Figure 37. Part Numbers of the hybrids used for this test\nwere as follows: 10090-516-21-04E, 10090-516-21-06E, 10091-516-21-01E,\n10091-516-21-06E, 10092-516-21-01E, 10092-516-21-02E, 10093-516-21-01E,\nand 10093-516-21-06E.\nAfter life testing, six of the hybrids passed functional testing\nand two failed. Functional testing was performed at two different\ntemperatures, 0\xc2\xb0C (+0, -5\xc2\xb0C)and 60\xc2\xb0C (+5, -0\xc2\xb0C), and a continuity\n\n74\n\nU\n\n"2\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\xe2\x80\xa2 i\no\nes!\n\nirt\n\nr-D>\n\nA\n\nCVJ\n\no\no\n\ns<a\nQ.\n\nto\n\nO\n\nC7)\n\nC\n\n(U\n\nV\n\nV\n\no\nto\n\no\nCVJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nU\n<U\n\nc\no\no\n\nCNJ\n\nen\ncsi\n\nto\no\ncrv\no\no\n\no\ns_\n\nro\n0)\n3\n\na>\ns0\na.\n\n<M\n\xc2\xab?\n.\'\n\n75\n\no\nCM\n\nCVJ\n\nI\nVD\n\nLf)\n\nCO\nG\\\nO\nO\n\ns\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n<U\n\n3\n\nC\nO\nO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\xe2\x80\x94\nt-\n\nQ-\n\nin\n\n\xc2\xbb\n\n-\n\nr>^\n\nu>\n*\xe2\x80\x94\n\nCO\n\no\no\noo\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2"\nH\n\n->\'\n\n<>\n\n^\n>\n<)\n\nt>\nCM\n\n^\nCM\n\no\n\no\nu>\n\nCxj\n\n<u\n\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\xe2\x80\xa2!\n\no\n\nr-rt>\n\nV)\n\n(SJ\n\no\n\no\nat\nCM\n\nc\\j\ni\n10\n\no\n\nLO\nCM\nOT\nO\nO\n\nro\nS-\n\ni<a\na.\n\nCM\nO\n\nCM\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\x94\nI\n\n76\n\nand isolation test was performed at 25\xc2\xb0C (*5\xc2\xb0C). The two hybrids\nthat failed were Part Nos. 10092-516-21-02E and 10093-516-21-01E.\nBoth of these hybrids are signal conditioners; 10092 processes the\naccelerometer signals and 10093 processes the telemetering signals.\nThe failures were as follows: the output of the first op-amp of the\n10092 was saturated, and the output of the rms-to-dc-converter portion\nof the 10093 was essentially zero. Previous experience with\nmetallurgically sealed (seam-welded) FASCOS hybrids of these types\nhas shown that these are commonly occurring failure modes after only\n168-hour burn-in. Consequently, it is felt that these failures were\nnot attributable to the fact that these hybrids were adhesive-sealed\nand contained larger amounts of water vapor.\n2.3.2\n\nMass Spectrometric Analyses of the Internal Atmospheres of FASCOS\nHybrids\n\n2.3.2.1 Immediately After Adhesive Sealing\nMass spectrometric analyses were made of the internal atmospheres\nof four empty nickel-plated Kovar FASCOS packages and two FASCOS\nhybrids immediately after adhesive sealing. Results are given in\nTables 10 and 11, respectively.\nAs shown in Tables 10 and 11, the packages arid hybrids were\nremoved from the nitrogen dry box and installed in the mass spectrometer carrousel for overnight pumpdown, in preparation for moisture/gas\nanalysis the next^day, either on the same day they were sealed or on\nthe day after. This is indicated by the "0" or "1" entries under "Days\nStored (Dry Nitrogen)." In either case, the only exposure of the\npackages to room air was for the brief interval of time it took to\nmove them from the nitrogen dry box and install them in the mass\nspectrometer carrousel (approximately 15 minutes). As expected,\ncomparison of the data for packages stored for 0 or 1 day in dry\nnitrogen certainly does not indicate that this made any difference.\nThese empty packages and hybrids and all other adhesive-sealed\nFASCOS hybrids were sealed in a dry-nitrogen atmosphere (approximately\n760 Torr) at 165\xc2\xb0C and punctured in a high vacuum at 100\xc2\xb0C.

P(165\xc2\xb0C)\nT(100\xc2\xb0C)/T(165\xc2\xb0C) shows that P(100\xc2\xb0C), the puncture pressure of the\npackage, should be approximately 647 Torr. As shown in Tables 10\nand 11 , the puncture pressures are substantially higher, indicating\nthat the sealing adhesive continues to outgas substantially after it\nhas cured adequately to seal the packages.\nThe results given in Tables 10 and 11 show that all packages\ncontained very substantial amounts of water vapor; large amounts of\nhydrogen, carbon dioxide, acetone, and MEK; very large amounts of\nmethane; small amounts of an unidentified alcohol (probably methanol);\nfairly Targe amounts of some constituent with an AMU=of 40 (probably\nhydrocarbon fragments resulting from interactions due to the large\namounts of acetone and MEK present, not argon); and very small amounts\nof oxygen.\n.When the method used to lid the packages is considered, all of\nthe constituents detected during the analysis of their internal\natmospheres are expected. The package case, adhesive preform, and\nlid are clamped together in a dry-nitrogen environment and then\nplaced in a nitrogen oven to cure the adhesive. Since there is no\nvent hole in the lid, a portion of the solvents outgassed from the\nadhesive (methanol, acetone, and MEK), and the various products\nreleased by the adhesive during cure (hydrogen, methane, carbon\ndioxide, and water vapor) will be retained inside the package.\nThe only major difference between the results obtained for the\nadhesive-sealed empty nickel-plated Kovar packages and the hybrids\nis that the hybrids contained somewhat more water vapor. This could\nbe due to desorption of water vapor from the ceramic substrate or\nmounting adhesive, indicating that the pre-seal vacuum bake-out\nfor four hours at 100\xc2\xb0C is inadequate, particularly since the packages\nare subsequently sealed at 165\xc2\xb0C.\n\n80\n\nIn conclusion of this section, due to the fact that undesired\nconstituents such as acetone and MEK are outgassed by the adhesive\nduring cure, it is recommended that lids containing a small vent\nhole be used. After lidding, the packages should be baked out as\nrequired and a very small amount of adhesive used to seal the\nsmall vent hole.\n2.3.2.2 After Extended Storage at Room Ambient\nMass spectrometric analyses were made of the internal atmospheres\nof four adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids that had simply been stored\nat room ambient after screen and functional testing. One hybrid of\neach of the four,different types was used for these analyses (Part Nos,\n10090-516-21-02E, 10091-516-21-02E, 10092-516-21-08E, and 10093-516-2103E). Results are given in Table 12.\nComparison of these results with those obtained for the hybrids\nanalyzed immediately after adhesive sealing shows that they are much\nthe same. The major difference is that these hybrids contained\nsubstantially more water vapor and perhaps a little more carbon\ndioxide.\nThe presence of the larger quantities of water vapor and carbon\ndioxide was not surprising, considering the history of these hybrids.\nThey not only were stored at room ambient for extended intervals of\ntime, but also were subjected to a stabilization bake at 150\xc2\xb0C for\n24 hours and a burn-in at 125\xc2\xb0C for at least 160 hours. Certainly\nthese high temperature exposures could account for the higher carbon\ndioxide content and some increase in the water-vapor content, and\npermeation during extended storage at room ambient could account for\nthe rest of the increase in the water-vapor content. What was\nsurprising was the lack of oxygen in the hybrids. It was expected\nthat oxygen would also permeate into the hybrids during extended\nstorage at room ambient. This obviously was not the case.\n\n81\n\nLU\nCO\nmO\n\nS\n\n\xc2\xa7CM\n\n2\n\nJ^\n\nt\xe2\x80\x941\n\ncf\n\xc2\xab3-\n\nt~\\\n\nZ.\n\nO\n\nCM\n\n^f\nCO\nCM\n\nCO\n\nf^^\nCTl\n\nO\n^H\n\nto\nto\n\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xc2\xab3CO\n\n00\n\nco\nCO\n\no\n\nCM\nO\nO\n\nI\nD\n\nO\n\n0\n\nr-.\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCM\nO\n00\n\nCO\nCO\n\xc2\xab*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nCM\n\nrH\n\nr^\n\no\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nJo\n\no\nto\n\n0\n\nCM\n\nvo\nJ^\n\ny,^\n\n10\nLU\n00\n\n^\xe2\x80\x94\n\nrtJ\nC\n\nT^T\n\n&. ^\nOl O)\n\n1\n\n^} 1-^\n\n00\nO\n^^\n\n^ C\\J\n\nQ i\n^o\nt\xe2\x80\x94i\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2u \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb->\n\nC <t-\n\n*\xe2\x80\x94*\n\n^^\n\n^\n\nO\n\nQ\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nz.\n\nCsJ\nLO\n00\n\nCO\ni\xe2\x80\x94I\n^f\n\nCO\nCO\n\nCM\n\n\xc2\xab\xc2\xb1\n\nCTi\nCO\n\nLO\ntO\nO\nLf>\nO\nCM\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCM\nID\n\nf\xc2\xabS^\n\np^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nco\n\no\no\n^^\n\ni\xe2\x80\x941\nO\n\no\n\nto\n\nCTl\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*\n\no\n\n0\n\nco\nto\nto\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xab3r^\nto\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nS-\n\ns_\no\n\nCM\n^^\n\nY\xe2\x80\x94l\n\ni-H\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nrH\n\n;y \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xc2\xab\n\nCO\nCM\n\nO\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\n^^\n\n^o\n\nf\xe2\x80\x941\nCM\n00\n\nLT>\n\nOl tO\n\n-c: -o\ns_\n\nLU\nCM\n\n\xc2\xab4- -0\nO >>\nI\nE\n\nf-^\n\n|\nO[* f\xe2\x80\x94f\n^r C\\l\n^^\n1-1 1\n*""\'\n\nto\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r- CO\ntO O\n>> C_}\n\nto\n\n(O <f.\nC.

L. Perkins, 7 December 1959).\n"As in the case of gas-glass systems, the results of\nexperimental investigations show that in general the\npermeation of gases through polymers is due to nonspecific\nactivated diffusion. The permeation rate, \xc2\xab7, is therefore\ngiven by the following equation.\nP\n2 - Pl\nJ = KA. , I\n\nwith K = KQe~ \' T. The qualification of the diffusion process\nas being of nonspecific activation means that every gas of\nsufficiently small molecular dimensions will diffuse and that\ndiffusion occurs as a molecular process. This is in contra- .\ndistinction to the diffusion of gases through metals which occurs\nas an atomic process and is specific to certain gases and\ncertain metals with which the gas can react chemically or\nform an alloy.\n"Since the permeation of gases through polymers is a\ndiffusion-associated process of nonspecific activation, the\nprocesses of major importance in such systems are those of\nabsorption or solution of the gas in the polymer and diffusion\nof the gas through the polymer. The nature of the diffusion\nprocess and a qualitative discussion of the peculiarities of\nthe solubility process as pertains to gas-polymer systems will\nnow be given.\n"Motion of the gas molecules through the bulk material of\nthe polymer occurs as a result of the kinetic energy of the\ngas molecules and the molecules of the polymer. Those gas\nmolecules possessing an energy corresponding to the activation\nenergy, which has to be supplied to separate the molecular\nchains of the polymer a sufficient distance, will move through\nthe polymer. As expected from the fact that larger openings\n\n83\n\nshould be required for the diffusion of larger gas\nmolecules, requiring that the polymer molecules be\nseparated a greater distance and over a greater length;\nit is found that the required activation energy is greater,\nthe larger the gas molecule. Also, as expected, the\nactivation energy depends on the nature of the polymer.\nIt is found that the stronger the secondary valences by\nwhich the polymer molecules are interlinked, the greater\nis the required activation energy.\n"The solubility of a gas in a polymer is also\' dependent\non the nature of the gas and the polymer. Experiment shows\nthat the solubility of a gas in a polymer is larger, the\nhigher the critical temperature or boiling point of the gas.\nIt is also found that the presence of polar groups in a\npolymer reduces the solubility of a nonpolar gas, and that\npolar gas molecules will dissolve more readily in a polymer\nwith polar molecules than in a polymer without polar molecules.\nThis is due to the fact that two polar molecules have greater\nmutual attraction than a polar and a nonpolar molecule, and,\nas a result, the nonpolar molecule is more or less expelled\nfrom the polymer."\nApplying this information to the present case of oxygen, water\nvapor, and an epoxy adhesive, it is seen that water vapor should\nreadily permeate (diffuse) through the epoxy adhesive and oxygen\nshould not. The solubility of water vapor in the epoxy adhesive is\nmuch greater than oxygen for two reasons.

No analysis was made for this\nhybrid since the composition of the remaining sample cannot be\nrepresentative of the original internal atmosphere.\nComparison of the results obtained for these three hybrids with\nthose previously obtained for the four hybrids that had simply been\nstored at room ambient shows that they are much the same except for\nthe much larger water-vapor contents of the present hybrids. Note\nthat while considerable water vapor permeated into the hybrids\nduring this test, oxygen did not.\n2.3.2.4 After 1000-Hour Life Testing\nMass spectrometric analyses were made of the internal atmospheres\nof seven of the eight FASCOS hybrids subjected to the 1000-hour life\ntest (Section 2.3.1.2). Results are given in Table 14. One hybrid\n(Part No. 10092-516-21-01E) was not analyzed because its puncture\npressure was only approximately 76 Torr, indicating that it was a\ngross leaker and its internal atmosphere was essentially exhausted\nduring overnight pumpdown. The composition of the remaining sample\ncannot be representative of the original internal atmosphere.\nReview of the data for the seven hybrids indicates that their\nwater-vapor content increased with the length of time that they were\nstored at room ambient before they were analyzed after life testing.\nThe hybrids that were analyzed after only one or two days storage\ncontained between 2 and 2.5 percent water vapor, essentially the\nsame as that previously found for hybrids analyzed immediately after\nadhesive sealing. The hybrids that were analyzed after nine days\nstorage contained slightly more water vapor (approximately 2.7 and\n3.3 percent), and those that were analyzed after 22 days storage\ncontained approximately 5 percent.

This\nindicates that water vapor permeates out of the hybrids through\nthe adhesive seal during the 1000-hour life test at 125\xc2\xb0C and\nsubsequently permeates back into them during exposure at room\nambient.\nFurther comparison of the results obtained for these hybrids\nwith those obtained for the hybrids that were simply stored at\nroom ambient for extended periods of time after screen and functional\ntesting and those that were analyzed immediately;after sealing shows\nthat the major difference is that these hybrids contained substantially\nmore carbon dioxide. This indicates that substantial further outgassing\nof the adhesive (due either to further curing or slow decomposition)\noccurred during the 1000-hour exposure at 125\xc2\xb0C. Also, these hybrids\ncontained slightly less hydrogen and no MEK, but the concentrations\nof the other constituents were essentially the same.\n\n89\n\n3.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this study, three alternate hybrid packaging and interconnection\ntechniques were evaluated to determine their potential for reducing the\ncost of hybrid systems without degrading reliability. These were the\nuse of 1) adhesive package sealing instead of metallurgical package sealing\n(seam welding), 2) nickel-plated Kovar package cases and lids rather than\ngold-plated Kovar package cases and lids, and 3) multiwire boards instead\nof multilayer boards. The evaluation was performed by manufacturing\nFASCOS (Flight Accelerometer Safety Cut-Off Systems) hybrids and board\nassemblies using these alternate techniques, subjecting them to normal\nscreen and functional testing to evaluate their performance, and comparing their costs with those of similar hybrids and board assemblies\nfabricated using conventional techniques.\nThe study was performed in three phases: 1) hardware fabrication\nand testing, 2) cost comparison, and 3) reliability evaluation. The\nfirst phase included developing the technology for adhesive sealing and\ndelidding FASCOS hybrids, fabricating/assembling and testing 32 FASCOS\nhybrids using nickel-plated Kovar package cases and lids and adhesive\nsealing, designing a multiwire board functionally equivalent to the\npresent FASCOS multilayer board, and assembling two FASCOS modules\nusing the multiwire boards and functionally testing them in the present\nFASCOS engineering system. The second phase consisted of identifying\nthe important cost factors related to the implementation of the new\ntechniques and ascertaining the corresponding cost deltas for both the\nFASCOS hybrids and the FASCOS modules. The third phase involved\nelectrical testing of the adhesive-sealed hybrids to determine their\nfunctional performance after they were subjected to the ten-day moisture\nresistance test and the 1000-hour life test, and performing mass spectrometric analyses of these and other hybrids to determine the composition\nof their internal atmospheres.\nThe major conclusions of this study are:\n\n90\n\n1. Nickel-plated Kovar packages are a desirable\nreplacement for gold-plated Kovar packages.\nSelective-plated cases (i.e., package cases\nwith nickel-plated case bodies and gold-plated\nleads) should be used. For FASCOS packages\n( 1 x 2 inches), the cost of nickel-plated\npackages is 35 percent less than the cost of\ngold-plated packages.\n2. Adhesive package sealing is not recommended as\na replacement for metallurgical package sealing\n(seam welding). Adhesive-sealed packages are\nnot hermetic, and, at least for FASCOS packages\n( 1 x 2 inches), adhesive sealing does not result\nin a cost savings either for sealing the packages\nor delidding them.\n3. Multiwire boards are a desirable replacement for\nmultilayer boards, especially for small quantity\napplications. Design costs are substantially\nlower, boards are less expensive, design changes\nare much easier to make and less expensive, and\nboard rework/repair is simpler. Design costs\nfor the FASCOS multiwire board were approximately\n25 percent of those for the multilayer board. The\ncost of the two multiwire boards required to replace\na multilayer board was only approximately 35 percent\nof the cost of the multilayer board for the prototype boards and would be less than 20 percent of\nthe cost of the multilayer board in small quantity\nproduction (24 multilayer boards and 48 multiwire\nboards) as required for the FASCOS build.\nAdditional results and conclusions or recommendations are:\n1. Nickel-plated Kovar packages can be adhesive\nsealed; however, adhesive sealing the large\n91\n\n(1 x 2 inch) FASCOS packages is more labor intensive\nthan seam welding them.\n2. Adhesive-sealed FASCOS packages cannot withstand\nthe stresses imposed during the fine leak test,\neven for a bombing pressure of only 15 psig. Since,\nthe packages are being cleaned and sealed as well\nas they can be, it is felt that this is due to--their\nrelatively large size (1 x 2 inches). As a result,\nsince adhesive-sealed packages are not hermetic in\nany case, it is recommended that, if adhesive sealing\nis used, the requirement for fine leak testing be\neliminated for packages of this size or larger and\nit be required only that they pass the old C-j gross\nleak test. This test is adequate to ensure that the\nhybrid circuits are protected from the direct intrusion\nof liquid and particulate contaminants.\n3. A tool was developed during this study that makes the\ndelidding of adhesive-sealed packages a very simple\nprocess; however, this tool cannot remove the cured\nadhesive that remains on the rims of the package\ncases. Attempts to develop a tool for this purpose \xe2\x80\xa2\nwere unsuccessful. The method finally selected for\nremoving the cured adhesive from the package rims\nwas to invert the package cases and lightly rub them\non a very fine grit paper or crocus cloth. Due to\nthe hardness of the nickel plating, if this sanding\nis done carefully, only the cured adhesive is removed.\n4. Delidding adhesive-sealed packages and removing the\ncured adhesive from the rims of the package cases\nrequire essentially the same effort as delidding\nseam-welded packages and refinishing the rims of the\npackage cases.\n\n92\n\nAllowing delidding of the FASCOS hybrids could result\nin substantial savings\xe2\x80\x94reducing their cost by 20 to\n25 percent. Based on this fact and the present level\nof success achieved in delidding seam-welded packages,\nit is recommended that delidding be allowed.\nMass spectrometric analysis of the internal atmospheres\nof adhesive-sealed FASCOS packages performed immediately\nafter sealing showed that,while they contained approximately 93 percent nitrogen, they also contained other\nconstituents such as solvents outgassed from the sealing\nadhesive (methanol, acetone, and MEK) and products\nreleased during curing of the sealing adhesive (hydrogen,\nmethane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor). As a result,\nsince some of these constituents are undesirable, it is\nrecommended that, if packages are adhesive sealed, the\nlids contain a small vent hole and that, after sealing,\nthe packages be baked-out to remove these constituents\nand then the vent holes be sealed using a very small\namount of adhesive.\nThe adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids that were subjected\nto the ten-day moisture resistance test passed electrical\nfunctional testing with all parameters well within the\nspecified tolerances even though subsequent mass spectrometric analysis showed that they contained the various\nconstituents listed above and a substantial amount of\nwater vapor (around 12 percent or 120,000 PPM.,).\nSix of eight adhesive-sealed FASCOS hybrids subjected\nto the 1000 hour steady-state life test passed electrical\nfunctional testing and two failed. The two hybrids that\nfailed were signal conditioners. Based on previous\nexperience with seam-welded hybrids of this type, it\nis felt that these failures were not due to the fact\n\n93\n\nthat these hybrids were adhesive sealed and contained\nlarger amounts of water vapor than the seam-welded\nhybrids.\n9. The FASCOS Signal Conditioner/Logic Control board\nwhich presently is an expensive eight-layer multilayer board with components mounted on both sides\ncan be replaced by two inexpensive multiwire boards\nwith components mounted on only one side. This\napparently results in considerable cost savings.\nHowever, before this conclusion is accepted as fact,\nthe compatibility,of such a change with the size,\nweight, and performance (reliability) requirements\nof the: FASCOS system should be determined.\nIn summary, from a cost reduction standpoint, this study showed\nthe following for the FASCOS system:\n1. Nickel-plated Kovar packages cost 35 percent less than\ngold-plated Kovar packages.\n2. Adhesive sealing does not reduce either package sealing\nor delidding costs.\n3. Design of the multiwire board cost only approximately\n25 percent as much as that of the multilayer board.\n4. In small quantity production, the 2 multiwire boards\nrequired to replace the multilayer board cost less\nthan 20 percent as much as the multilayer board.\n5. Allowing delidding would reduce the cost of the FASCOS\nhybrids by 20 to 25 percent.\n\n94\nU.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1982-546-071/149 REGION NO. 4\n\n'
