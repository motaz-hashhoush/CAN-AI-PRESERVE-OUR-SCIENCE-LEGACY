The requested subject is microbial risk assessment considering changes in the human immune system during flight and microbial diversity of environmental samples aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The presentation will begin with an introduction discussing the goals and limitations of microbial risk assessment during flight. The main portion of the presentation will include changes in the immune system that have been published, historical data from microbial analyses, and initial modeling of the environmental flora aboard ISS. The presentation will conclude with future goals and techniques to enhance our ability to perform microbial risk assessment on long duration missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Mexico", "submissionId": 20060020241, "endDate": "2004-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "10th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology", "location": "Cancun", "id": "8932ac2122274840baa172bf00fc6558", "startDate": "2004-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060020241, "id": "f38ad68ec2d34b9ba77f98cd35525b23", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
