Sawatzky and Keenan Lee\nDepartment of Geology\nColorado School of Mines\nGolden, Colorado\nABSTRACT\nShadow enhancement of topographic linears in\nphotographic or scanner images is a valuable tool\nfor interpretation of geologic structures.\nWhether\nlinears will be enhanced or subdued depends on sun\nangle and azimuth. The relationship of the sun\'s\nattitude to topographic slopes determines which\ntrends are available for interpretation in existing\nimagery, and it can be used to select the time of\nday, surface properties, and film and filter\ncharacteristics in planning aircraft flights or\nsatellite orbital passes.\nThe technique of selective shadow enhancement can be applied to all\nphotographic or imaging experiments, but is best\nfor snow-covered scenes, side-looking radar images,\nand painted relief models.\nINTRODUCTION\nD.U. Wise (1969) discussed the enhancement of\ntopographic linears produced by low-angle illumination of relief maps from various directions.\nThe\ntechnique reveals sets of linears often noticeably\naligned within 30 degrees of the illumination\ndirection. Many of these linears are anomalous in\nthat they are unrelated to obvious geologic structural trends and transect major features of different tectonic style.\nThis paper attempts to explain selective\nshadow enhancement by developing and extending the\n1\n\nD.L. SAWATZKY AND K. LEE\nideas of Wise. The theory of selective shadow enhancement is shown to be useful in the interpretation of linear trends on imagery and photographs,\nand useful in planning experiments that selectively\nenhance certain trends.\nShadow enhancement is defined as the exaggeration of topographic linears or alignments of such\nlinears by shadows formed within or along them.\nThe topographic linears may or may not be obvious.\nEnhancement can be produced by a linear shadow\nmargin or by an elongated shaded area.\nThe shadow is the result of low irradiance on\nthe area, and is distinguished from illuminated\nIn much imagery and\nareas of low reflectance.\nphotography the distinction between the two is not\nWhile both types of dark areas may\nalways obvious.\nhave strong geologic controls, the shape of a\nshadow is strongly controlled by the illumination\nattitude (elevation and direction).\nNumerous techniques have been developed to\nexaggerate linears in imagery and photographs. On\nthe spectrum of enhancement techniques, image\nenhancement techniques are ternary. Shadow\nenhancement is secondary, and geomorphic processes,\nImage\nwhile not under our control, are primary.\nenhancement operates only on the linears available\nin the image, which are only a subset of all the\nShadow enhancement is\nlinears in the object scene.\nresult of topography and illumination at the\nthe\ntime of exposure or scanning. However, it operates\nvariably upon topographic linears, depending on\nslope attitudes, and may subdue them as well as\nTherefore, there will\nenhance them (Fig. 1, [A]).\nalways be some linear features unavailable for\nenhancement.\nAlignment of several linear segments is a\npuzzling phenomenon that may have psychophysical\nLittle seems to be known about it,\naspects to it.\nand long-winded speculations will not be made here.\nThe phenomenon is puzzling for two reasons.\nFirst,\nvery long linear features are often composed of\n2\n\nfA\n\nFigure 1:\n\nV\n\nHigh contrast photographs of a relief model of the Leadville,\n\nColorado, map (original scale\nthe illumination direction.\n\n=\n\nArrows indicate\n\n1:250,000).\n\nThe elevation\n\nis\n\n27 degrees.\n\nD.L.

LEE\nseveral segments.\nThey cross major tectonic\nfeatures without apparent relationship to the tectonic trends.\nSecond, the alignments are near\nperfect at some illumination directions, but become\nangular or even non-existent at other directions\n(Fig. 1, [B]).\nIn our experience, the physical\norigin of short linears or individual segments can\nbe determined with great probability, but the origin\nof many of the long alignments cannot be.\nSome\npreliminary results of plots of random linears\nindicate that apparent trends will exist (Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2:\n\nPlot of lines whose position, azimuth,\nand length have been generated randomly.\n\n4\n\nNEW USES OF SHADOW ENHANCEMENT\nUnless such alignments can be identified, they\nshould be considered seriously to be fortuitous\nalignments.\nApplications of shadow enhancement can be made\nto many types of imagery and photography and relief\nmodels. The latter are most effective when painted\na uniform light color. Side-looking radar imagery\nis also effective because of the high contrasts\nbetween the illuminated and shaded areas.\nPhotography that has high contrasts can also be effective, for example, a black-and-white positive of a\nsnow-covered scene (Fig. 3).\nBlack-and-white ERTS\nimages or Skylab photographs display abundant\nlinears, many of which are shadow enhanced. In\nsuch images, areas of low reflectance are as\nabundant as shadows and may compete with or enhance\nshadow trends.\n\nBASIS OF SHADOW ENHANCEMENT\nWise (1969, Fig. 4) reasoned that effective\nenhancement of linears occurs when the angle between the normal to the slope and the illumination\nvector is 90 degrees (Fig. 4).\nUnder this condition\nthe slope is shaded, and the distal margin of the\nshadow (the margin away from the source) lies at\nthe foot of the slope, which could be a valley\nfloor. If the valley floor is a linear feature, it\nis enhanced by the shadow margin. Thus the condition defined by Wise can account for the enhancement of linears. However, a study of shadows on\nrelief maps reveals that this condition occurs for\nonly a small percentage of shadows, and, under\nother conditions of shadowing, sets of linears also\nappear (Fig. 1, [C]).\nThe equation of Wise can be extended to include\nall conditions of shadowing. In this general case,\nthe angle between the unit source vector S and the\nunit slope normal N is equal to or greater than 90\ndegrees or, in vector notation, the vector scalar\nproduct\n\n5\n\nD.L.

The simplest experiment, designed\nfor illumination at fixed elevation and azimuth,\ncuts off all slopes less than the elevation and\nselectively cuts off slopes of smaller angle at\nsmaller deviations (Figs. 1,3,7).\nIt is possible\nto look for linear trends at low deviations to the\nsun azimuth. These trends will be the straightest\nones associated with the steepest slopes.\nSeveral\nexperiments could be planned that would enhance\ntrends at several ranges of azimuth.\nLow sun-angle photography is included is this\nsimple experiment. The low sun elevation defines a\nbroad pass band for slopes, and therefore, most\nstructurally controlled topography is enhanced\n(Fig. 7).\nThe low angle also defines a broad pass\nband for all deviations, and selective passing of\nvery steep slopes occurs at only very small deviations.\nLow sun elevation also produces broader\nshadows, which aid discrimination. On the other\nhand, high sun-angle photography has a narrower,\nand more selective, slope pass band, but shadows\nare narrower and discrimination is decreased.\nThis could be overcome by changing the vertical\nlook direction to a high-oblique look direction\ndirectly toward the source of illumination.\nMore complicated experiments involve two\nillumination directions (Fig. 8).\nBy the following\nformula,\n\nTAN(elevation)\'CTN(slope angle)=SIN(deviation),\n\n(5)\n\ncombinations of azimuth and elevation can be determined to selectively shadow enhance slopes in any\ndesired ranges of slope angle and deviation.\nDesired deviation and slope-angle cut-ons are\ndetermined by inspection of Fig. 9, and the optimum\nsun elevation is calculated from (5).\nThe result\nis a filter combination as shown in Fig. 10.\nThe\nband of deviations between the peaks is a slope12\n\n0\n\nFigure 8:\n\nImages of painted relief model taken at two illumination azimuths,\nshown by arrows.

A useful technique that enhances\nshadows in snow-free ERTS images, where they are\nconfused with areas of low reflectance, involves\ncolor reconstitution. A color composite is made\nwith Band 4 in green, Band 5 in red, and negative\nBand 6 in blue.\n(6) It is possible to plan photography in\nwhich selective shadow enhancement is optimized to\nstudy one or more selected trends.\n(7) Optimum enhancement is dependent on the\ntopography. For low sun-angle photography, the sun\nelevation should be a few degrees less than the\npredominant slope angle. For mountainous areas,\nelevations of 10 to 15 degrees seem to be optimum,\n16\n\nNEW USES OF SHADOW ENHANCEMENT\nwhile for gentler terrain approximately 5 degrees\nElevations of 22 to 27 degrees seem to\nseems best.\nbe optimum for relief models of mountainous terrain\nwith a vertical exaggeration of 2.
