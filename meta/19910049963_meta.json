Papers presented are on complications in determining trends in the stratosphere, changes in characteristics of planetary waves at 80-100 km over central and southern Europe since 1980, the 30-yr trend of observed greenhouse clouds over the tropical oceans, possible causes of enhanced greeenhouse effect as due to natural and anthropogenic phenomena, and advances in modeling ocean primary production and its role in the global carbon cycle. Attention is also given to a climatological analysis of rainfall for the wet pampa and northwest of the Buenos Aires province; the use of thermal IR remote sensing for water budget studies; hydrometeorological, oceanographic, and earth-resources satellite systems operated by USSR, and the NASA ocean data system at the JPL.", "title": "Global change and relevant space observations; Proceedings of Symposium 1 of the COSPAR 28th Plenary Meeting, The Hague, Netherlands, June 25-July 6, 1990", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T21:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910049963, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fellous, J.
