By using both chemical and electric propulsion systems\nwhere they are most beneficial and maintaining as much orbital\nenergy as possible, the Hybrid spaceship that carries crew\nround trip to Mars is pre-integrated before launch and can be\ndelivered to orbit by a single launch. After check-out on the way\nto cis-lunar space, it is refueled and can travel round trip to\nMars in less than 1100 days, with a minimum of 300 days in\nMars vicinity (opportunity dependent). The entire spaceship is\nrecaptured into cis-lunar space and can be reused. The\nspaceship consists of a habitat for 4 crew attached to the Hybrid\npropulsion stage which uses long duration electric and chemical\nin-space propulsion technologies that are in use today. The\nhybrid architecture\xe2\x80\x99s con-ops has no in-space assembly of the\ncrew transfer vehicle and requires only rendezvous of crew in a\nhighly elliptical Earth orbit for arrival at and departure from\nthe spaceship. The crew transfer vehicle does not travel to Mars\nso it only needs be able to last in space for weeks and re-enter at\nlunar velocities. The spaceship can be refueled and resupplied\nfor multiple trips to Mars (every other opportunity). The\nhybrid propulsion stage for crewed transits can also be utilized\nfor cargo delivery to Mars every other opportunity in a reusable\nmanner to pre-deploy infrastructure required for Mars vicinity\noperations. Finally, the Hybrid architecture provides evolution\noptions for mitigating key long-duration space exploration\nrisks, including crew microgravity and radiation exposure.\n\nMin Qu\nAMA, Inc.\n21 Enterprise\nParkway Suite 300\nHampton, VA 23666\n757-864-9737\nM.Qu-1@nasa.gov\n\nNoble Hatten\nUniversity of Texas \xe2\x80\x93 Austin\n5701 Cougar Drive, Unit C\nAustin, TX 78745\n512-657-2450\nNoble.Hatten@gmail.com\n\n1.

NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Exploration and\nOperations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) must maintain\nand operate the ISS while pursuing Human spaceflight inspace capability development for future missions.\nInfrastructure and operations costs must be lowered for\nNASA to expand capabilities with near term buying power.\nNASA must move from operating a logistics infrastructure\nfor a location 400 miles away from Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface to\noperating one that services multiple assets hundreds of\nthousands of miles to millions of miles from Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\n\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright\n\n1\n\ntrials\xe2\x80\x9d and shake downs. The Orion chemical propulsion\nsystem is long duration storable, re-startable, and has heritage\nwith the Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS).\nThe Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission is developing Solar\nElectric Propulsion (SEP) capabilities and magnetically\nshielded Hall Thrusters in the tens of kilowatt range that will\nbe rated for many years of service by the end of the mission.\nIt is possible to use a combination of Chemical Propulsion\n(CP) and Electric Propulsion (EP) at these performance\npoints to enable transportation of humans to Mars orbit.\nUsing these existing investments and capabilities, NASA can\nminimize the uncertainty and improve the sustainability of an\ninner solar system human presence.\n\nIn order to field any human Mars mission a set of at least 5\ncapabilities must be developed into future spacecraft. These\ncapabilities are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nCrew and cargo space access to space\nLong duration beyond Earth crew support\nLong duration in-space transportation\nDestination access\nDestination systems\n\nThis list can be shortened to only the first three capabilities\nfor initial missions defined in the Flexible Path for\nexploration [2] through Mars orbit access and the exploration\nof Phobos and Deimos. This allows phasing of Mars surface\nsystems while continuing a cadence of compelling missions.\n\nThis paper presents a Hybrid architecture, the EMC element\nconcepts being developed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human exploration\nArchitecture Team (HAT) and the resulting mission design\nfor transit of crew and cargo to Mars.\n\nCapability 1 exists for access to Low Earth Orbit (LEO),\nhowever access to cis-lunar space near the edge of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nsphere of influence provides an aggregation and departure\nlocation that reduces the Earth Departure stage size\ndramatically and allows for inexpensive recapture of systems\nfrom heliocentric space. NASA is developing the Space\nLaunch System (SLS) and Orion vehicles for this purpose.\nCommercial or International ISS access vehicles also\nrepresent capabilities that could be extended to enable cislunar crew and cargo capabilities.\n\n2. A HYBRID ARCHITECTURE\nOnly a few combined low thrust and high thrust Human\nmissions have been proposed recently. Missions to NEAs\nand Mars previously developed by the authors [7,8] as part\nof the Electric Path [9] only used the CP component of the\nmission for Earth departure from a high elliptical orbit.\nConversely the Mars mission described by Mercer et al. [10]\nonly uses the CP component for Mars orbit arrival and\ndeparture from an elliptical 1-sol Mars orbit.\n\nSeveral potential cis-lunar orbits have been identified\nincluding some that are long-term stable while others are\nloosely bound and require constant upkeep. These orbits are\nthe next logical destination for long term Human presence.\nThey are all very similar in orbital energy and a spacecraft\ncan maneuver between them for small velocity increments\n(\xe2\x88\x86V) given enough time. Transfers from Earth to these orbits\ncan be accomplished quickly for crew access. Cis-lunar space\nis also the easiest location to reach to beyond the Van-Allen\nbelts and the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment\naround Earth. A ballet of ballistic transfers leveraging solar\nperturbations [3] and Lunar Gravity effects [4] far from the\nEarth can now be leveraged to perform transfers and Earth\ndepartures or captures. Even very large masses, such as small\nasteroids can be captured from near Earth Space with very\nlow \xe2\x88\x86V and small amounts of force applied over long periods\nof time.[5]\n\nThis new Hybrid architecture includes three key strategies\nthat guide mission design decisions.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUse celestial energy resources to save propellant\nwhere time allows\nMaintain maximum orbital energy for the crew\ntransport spaceship\nRe-use in-space architecture elements as much as\npossible\n\nThese strategies were used to design a crew architecture that\nis comparable to a conjunction class Mars mission (<1100\nday total duration >300 day Mars vicinity), but can be\naccomplished without staging any component of the vehicle\nor need to rendezvous with additional elements or fuel. The\nHybrid Mars crewed round trip mission can be described by\na set of phases (Figure 1).\n\nCapability 2, long duration beyond Earth crew support\nsystems, can be tested in a location where the Earth and\nMoons gravity interacts. The concept of an outpost or Cislunar Base Camp [6] can be used to develop the capabilities\nand the confidence in them required to extend human\npresence beyond Earth into the inner solar system. Trips for\ncrew to and from cis-lunar space are on the order of ten to\ntwelve days and allow for abort to Earth in the event of a\ncritical system failure.\n\nA common theme for human deep space missions is\naggregation and assembly of propulsion and crew support\nelements. The ability to launch an entire spaceship that is\npre-integrated and able to fly round trip to Mars has only been\npossible with very large launch vehicles. One of the Hybrid\narchitecture\xe2\x80\x99s objectives is to enable launch of an integrated\nvehicle that only needs to be re-fueled and maintained in\norder to enable multiple trips from cis-lunar space to Mars.\nEach hybrid propulsion stage can enable one conjunction\nclass trip to Mars every other opportunity (4 2/7 years).\n\nFinally capability 3, long duration in-space transportation\nsystems, provide mobility for crew and destination systems.\nInitially crew elements are transported to and maintained in\ncis-lunar space. The in-space propulsion system can facilitate\ntransits around Earth \xe2\x80\x93 Moon and Sun \xe2\x80\x93 Earth Space for \xe2\x80\x9csea2\n\nIn order to minimize the spaceship size, orbital energy is\nmaximized and propellant required is minimized across\ntrajectories from cis-lunar space to and from Mars by\nutilizing a combination of Lunar Gravity Assists (LGA),\nsolar perturbation loops, and high energy elliptical parking\norbits. Earth departure is via a LGA from a high elliptical\norbit. Crew rendezvous with the Mars spaceship in the high\nelliptical orbit to enable quick propellant-less Earth\ndeparture. The crew return to Earth and rendezvous with\ntheir return capsule using the same maneuvers performed in\nreverse. EP is used during the transit to and from Mars, where\na high energy elliptical parking orbit is used with period\nbetween 5 and 10 sol.\n\nCommercial launch vehicle fleet including Delta IV Heavy\nand Falcon Heavy: Delivers cargo to LDRO or LDHEO\nCrew Launch and Earth Entry Vehicle\nOrion: Supports crew transit to and return from LDRO or\nLDHEO on fast transits of no more than 12 days one way.\nLong Duration Crew Support Systems\nDeep Space Habitat: 40 t fully outfitted and has a dry mass of\n22 t without logistics or spares and supports a crew of 4 for\nup to 1100 days in deep space. 32 t fully outfitted for a crew\nof 4 for 600 days [12]\nPhobos Exploration and Crew Support\nHabitat for multiple Phobos stays (approximately 500 days\ntotal duration with delivered logistics).

Hybrid Architecture Mission Phases\n\nMars Surface Access\n\nIn order to venture in space for years at a time we must\neventually mitigate long duration effects of leaving Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nsurface. Crew support hardware that mitigates radiation and\nmicro-gravity effects on humans is more massive than the\nsystem described in Section 3. The Hybrid architecture\nprovides evolution paths for much heavier vehicles at similar\npower and thrust levels through a ballistic cycler architecture\nso that future pioneers need not be exposed to the same\ndetrimental deep space environmental influences that initial\nexplorers endure.\n\nMars Landers pre-deploy the required surface assets and\nascent stage. Currently two designs are being evaluated, one\nis 59 t at Mars arrival and delivers 26 t of payload and the\nother is 43 t at Mars arrival and delivers 18 t of payload to the\nsurface.\n\n3.

They are launched by a SLS 2 to an\nelliptical orbit (200 km x 20,000 km) where the SEP is\ndeployed and thrusts for approximately one year to reach a\nLunar Gravity Assist (LGA), from there the trip to stable cislunar space takes approximately 6 months. Upon arrival in a\nLDRO and rendezvous with the existing infrastructure\nadditional SLS is launched to LDRO with all the fuel and\nadditional logistics required for the Mars mission. A crew can\nvisit the Mars spaceship and perform habitat checkout and\noutfitting if necessary. The advantage of the LDRO in that it\nis stable, other locations in cis-lunar space must be\nmaintained via small maneuvers weekly or bi-weekly.\n\nThe fast transit described is used to help minimize crew\nduration in space if the crew rendezvoused with the Mars\nspaceship in the LDRO and used a CP departure like other\narchitectures that are aggregated in cis-lunar space. There is\nanother class of transfer from an LDRO to LDHEO that is <\n70 m/s \xe2\x88\x86V however it takes nearly 6 months to complete the\ntransfer in a manner similar to the Hybrid Spaceship\ndeployment to LDRO. After departure from the LDRO the\nMars spaceship transfers to LDHEO via a solar perturbation\nloop and a pair of LGAs (Fig. 4). Mars crew rendezvous with\nthe Mars spaceship in LDHEO after these maneuvers so they\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have to be onboard during the long transit from LDRO\nto LDHEO. From LDHEO a LGA propels the Mars\nspaceship with crew onboard to a characteristic energy (C3)\nof 2 km2/s2. The total Earth departure \xe2\x88\x86V for Hybrid is < 70\nm/s and is accomplished at 3000s ISP by the EP system. If a\nhigher C3 is required a powered LGA or ECA that use the\nHPS CP system can be used.\n\nFast Transits to LDRO\n\nEP to Mars and CP for capture\n\nCrew transfers to and from the LDRO have been developed\nwith 10-12 day transits from Earth for the Asteroid Redirect\nCrewed Mission (ARCM) [14]. These transits include 3\nmaneuvers to leave the LDRO, an initial departure of ~ 20\nm/s, a targeting maneuver approximately 3 days later to target\na lunar close approach of ~ 110 m/s and a powered lunar\nswing-by approximately 4 days later of ~ 180m/s. The total\n\xe2\x88\x86V for a crew arriving or departing is ~ 310 m/s. If an all\nchemical Mars transit vehicle uses these maneuvers before\nTrans Mars Injection (TMI) between 470 and 900 m/s \xe2\x88\x86V is\nrequired at Earth close approach to achieve the necessary\n\nAfter Earth departure the EP system thrusts for much of the\noutbound trajectory to increase the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s orbital energy to\nnearly that of Mars. The Mars spaceship arrives at Mars with\na low C3 of between 1 and 2 km2/s2 with the incoming\nhyperbola targeted for a Mars close approach at 150 km\naltitude. The CP component of the HPS performs the Mars\norbit insertion into a high elliptical Mars orbit with period of\n5-10 Sol. Using larger Mars orbits reduces the propulsion\nrequirement by more than 50 % compared to 1 Sol orbits for\nthese arrival velocities.\n\nDeployment to LDRO\n\nSolar Perturbations\n\nLGA Departure\n(after crew rendezvous)\n\nLGA 1\nLGA 2\n\nLDRO Departure\nFigure 4. LDRO to LDHEO transfer\n5\n\nmaneuvers reorient the orbit. The same \xe2\x88\x86V is required for recapture into the departure parking orbit. The 10 Sol transfer\nin Figure 7 is 110 m/s total \xe2\x88\x86V and 100 days for the transfer.\nOther opportunities have also been assessed to verify that the\ncrew vehicle can re-orient in time for departure. The duration\nof the butterfly maneuver varies and is up to 250 days,\nhowever the required \xe2\x88\x86V is nearly the same.\n\nCrew transfers to and from Phobos\nUpon arrival at Mars the pre-deployed taxi rendezvous with\nthe Mars spaceship to transport the crew to Phobos. The\ntransfer is approximately 3 days for a 5-sol orbit and 6 days\nfor a 10-sol orbit. Depending on the arrival orbit inclination\nrelative to Phobos larger orbits can be less \xe2\x88\x86V than a transfer\nfrom a smaller orbit like a 1-sol. Figure 5 is the round trip \xe2\x88\x86V\nto Phobos for varied total round trip plane change. Ascent\nfrom the surface of Mars is also a concern for larger orbits,\nhowever an addition of 0.18 km/s to a total ascent \xe2\x88\x86V of more\nthan 5 km/s is small. A greater concern to be assessed in the\nfuture is the risk posture for a crew ascent to a multi-day\nperiod orbit when the ascent module only supports one day\nof life support nominally.\n\nCP Mars departure and EP to LGA\nAfter a stay in the Mars sphere of influence of at least 300\ndays the CP component of the HPS performs a burn at perigee\nto boost the Mars spaceship to a C3 of approximately 1\nkm2/s2. From there the EP component uses its high I SP mode\nto transfer the vehicle back to Earth targeting an LGA with\nan incoming C3 of < 2 km2/s2.\nEarth Arrival and Crew return to Earth\nThe crewed Mars spaceship captures back into a LDHEO via\na LGA in a manner similar to Earth departure, but in reverse.\nAn SLS 2 launches Orion to rendezvous with the Mars\nspaceship and transfers fuel and logistics carried to the HPS\nbefore returning the crew to Earth.\nTransfer to LDRO\nThe Mars Spaceship transfers back to the LDRO after the\ncrew depart. Depending on Mars opportunity this transfer\nmay be sped up by using the propellant carried on the crew\nrendezvous to ensure adequate time in the LDRO for\nrefurbishment and refueling prior to the next Earth departure\nwindow to Mars.\n\nFigure 5: Crew taxi \xce\x94V for Mars elliptical orbit to Phobos\nround trip. Horizontal black line represents current split\ntransportation architecture taxi \xce\x94V budget.\n\nTable 1 is crewed durations for Mars Hybrid Missions. Note\nfor the 2033 opportunity the Mars stay is 432 days and for the\n2041 opportunity the lower limit of 300 days in the Mars\nsystem is reached. Table 2 is the total propellant and logistics\nneeds for these flights. The logistics can be delivered with\nthe crew on cis-lunar missions and when rendezvousing with\nthe Mars spaceship in LDHEO. Xenon and bi-prop can be\nlaunched to LDRO by an SLS 2 in a set of HPS tanks or by\ncommercially contracted fuel delivery.\n\nMars orbit reorientation\nWhile the larger Mars parking orbits reduce propulsion\nrequirements for insertion and departure they also pose a\nchallenge for reorientation from arrival orbit to departure\norbit. Larger orbits (5-10 sol) do not process as quickly as\nsmaller orbits (1 sol). That\nmeans it is less likely that a\nplane change maneuver can\nbe used to re-orient the orbit\nas the arrival and departure\norbits cross. For the Hybrid\nmission design a set of\nmaneuvers\ntermed\nthe\n\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly\xe2\x80\x9d (Figure 6) have\nbeen developed that use third\nbody effects and SEP\nthrusting near the edge of\nMars sphere of influence for\nalignment. The CP system\nprovides ~ 35 m/s \xe2\x88\x86V for 10\nsol parking orbits or ~ 65 m/s\nfor 5 sol parking orbits to\nreach the Mars sphere of\nFigure 6. 2037 Butterfly\ninfluence\nwhere\nsmall\n\nTable 1.

Additional use of the\nCP component for cargo delivery is an area for additional\nassessment.\n\n5. CARGO MISSION DESIGN\nThe HPS designed for the crewed mission is also used for\ncargo missions in the Hybrid architecture. The cargo\nmissions in this section are initial feasible options to prove\nHPS viability for Mars cargo delivery.\n\nMars Cargo Delivery with HPS reuse\nMars cargo delivery missions were assessed specifically for\ntwo conceptual lander sizes, but can also be used for delivery\nof additional payloads to Phobos for extended missions. The\ninitial cargo mission begins in a manner similar to the Phobos\ncargo delivery, except once near Mars the cargo to be\ndelivered is released and it captures itself while the HPS does\na Mars gravity assist and deadheads back to Earth for\nrecapture (Figure 9). The long duration of these cargo\n\nPhobos Cargo Delivery\nPhobos cargo delivery capability is limited by the Earth\ndeparture mass up to nearly 90 t. Two example cargo\ntrajectories were developed. The first is for a single Phobos\nvisit in 2033 (Figure 7) and the second delivers enough\nlogistics and propellant for two round trips from a parking\norbit to Phobos. The Crew taxi is delivered to Mars on the\nPhobos cargo flight, it detaches from the Phobos cargo stack\nbefore entering Mars sphere of influence and captures into a\nhigh elliptical phasing orbit while the HPS and Phobos\nhabitat spiral to Phobos. A comparison of the usable Phobos\npayload and the amount of propellant required to refuel the\nPhobos HPS is illustrated in Figure 8. There is nearly a 1 to\n1 relationship between additional mass needed in LDRO for\nearth departure. This mass can be logistics, fuel, or additional\nelements to be delivered to Phobos. Mass delivered to 5 sol\nin this graph is the Phobos taxi and is considered fixed with\nthe available payload at Phobos falling out. It should also be\nnoted that the CP component of the HPS is not used in the 0\n\xe2\x80\x93 18t additional mass needed cases, but is halfway fueled for\nthe 33t additional mass case to provide propellant for a\nsecond round trip. If the CP component is removed from the\n\nFigure 8. Additional Mass at LDRO vs. Phobos payloads\n7\n\nFigure 9: Mars Cargo delivery with HPS reuse\ntrajectories is a product of using fuel optimal trajectories that\nare 1.5 revolutions around the sun outbound and inbound.\nFaster transits in the class of the crew mission are possible as\nwell and are currently being studied. The duration of these\ntrajectories is so long that after capture into the LDHEO upon\narrival back at Earth there are only a few orbits prior to\ndeparture for refueling and rendezvous with the next payload\n(lander) that is launched to LDHEO by the SLS. If a cadence\nof refuel, inspection and cargo rendezvous is achieved then\neach cargo HPS can be reused to support a cadence of 1 Mars\nsurface mission every other opportunity. In other words, only\na few HPS need be operating (3 - 4) and re-used to support\nmultiple Mars surface missions. A replacement strategy for\nHPS is needed so that all the vehicles aren\xe2\x80\x99t replaced at the\nsame time.\n\nto a LDRO. This study initially assumed the maximum inert\nspaceship mass in a LDRO prior to Earth departure is 65 tons;\n75 tons is launched to an elliptical orbit by a SLS 2, and 10\ntons of SEP fuel (Xenon) is used to spiral the spaceship to the\nLDRO. By the end of the study the assumed SLS 2 launch\nmass to a similar elliptical orbit was only 63 tons with 55 tons\narriving in the LDRO. As long as the SLS 2 can deliver the\ninert vehicle with enough fuel to transit to LDRO the\narchitecture closes. Decreasing the inert mass of the\nintegrated stack reduces the amount of refueling and\nresupplying that must be accomplished by the crew launch\nand/or commercial cargo launch(es).\nSpaceship mass sensitivity is analyzed using the low-thrust\ntrajectory optimization tool MALTO [15,16]. Trajectories\nare generated for the Earth departure opportunities, minimum\npayload masses, and EP input powers shown in Figure 10.\nThe solar array output power at 1 AU is twice the SEP input\npower, rounded to the nearest 100 kW, and the spaceship is\nassumed to consume a constant 20 kW of the solar array\noutput power. The CP stage is characterized by a specific\nimpulse of 321s, consistent with a hypergolic stage using an\nAJ10-190 engine (Space Shuttle Orbital Main Engine). The\nCP stage is sized with a conservative propellant mass fraction\n(PMF) of 0.8, which is less than the 0.86 PMF of a Delta II\nupper stage that includes 6 t of usable propellant. The three\npayload mass levels represent three possibilities for crew\ntransportation mass assumptions: 32 tons approximates an\n\n6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES\nThrough these analyses, the hybrid architecture is shown to\nbe feasible and to exhibit several significant potential\nadvantages relative to existing Mars architectures. It is\nimportant to understand the sensitivity of the concept to\nvaried mission parameters.\nSpaceship Mass Sensitivity\nIn order for the hybrid architecture to utilize a pre-integrated\nspaceship, the inert mass of the spaceship must be small\nenough that a single SLS launch can place the craft on its way\n8\n\nFigure 10: Earth departure mass sensitivity to payload mass, SEP input power, and launch opportunity. Horizontal\nblack line represents maximum mass to LDRO via single SLS launch and SEP spiral.\naggressive estimate of a 4-crew, 600-day Deep Space Habitat\n(DSH); 40 tons approximates a 4-crew 1100 day DSH; and\n50 tons approximates an aggressive DSH and Mars crew taxi\nvehicle or a heavier DSH.\nFigure 10 displays a breakdown of the Earth departure mass\nfor each of the analyzed trajectories. At either 212 kW or 252\nkW of EP power, 32 tons of payload results in a spaceship\nwet mass at Earth departure less than 65 tons for 2033 and\n2037 Earth departures, and very nearly less than 65 tons for\nthe 2041 Earth departure. Thus, the additional mass that must\nbe brought by the crew or a commercial cargo launch is\nminimal. For the 40-ton payload case, significant refueling is\nrequired, but the inert mass of the spaceship is well below the\n65-ton limit for all cases. However, for 50 tons of payload,\nthe inert mass exceeds the 65-ton limit by up to three tons and\nwould require offloading of DSH logistics and spares.\n\nPredictably, as SEP input power decreases, the SEP fuel\nrequirement decreases, while the CP fuel requirement\nincreases. However, a second implication of the exponential\nnature of the rocket equation is the existence of a domain of\nEP input power over which the overall spaceship mass varies\nonly marginally. For instance, though the spaceship CP fuel\nrequirement increases when the SEP input power decreases\nfrom 252 kW to 212 kW, the inert spaceship mass remains\nnearly constant, and the maximum spaceship wet mass\nincreases by only about 3 tons. Keeping in mind that the 252\nkW SEP stage assumes an additional 100 kW of solar array\noutput power compared to the 212 kW SEP, the additional\nwet mass may be preferable to the complications introduced\nby increasing the solar array output by 25 percent.\nElliptical Mars Orbit Effect on Earth Departure Mass\n\nSpaceship Power Reduction Sensitivity\n\nOther NASA Mars architecture assumes a 250-km periapsis\naltitude, 1-sol arrival and departure orbit about Mars.\nAlternatively, the hybrid architecture assumes a 5-sol or10sol orbit with the same periapsis altitude. The larger 10-sol\norbit is selected to reduce the CP stage \xce\x94V required for Mars\nOrbit Insertion (MOI) and trans-Earth injection (TEI).\nHowever, Mars orbit selection has several other important\nimpacts on maneuvers within the Mars sphere of influence.\nFirst, it is generally unlikely that the Mars approach and\ndeparture asymptotes will be aligned such that the Mars\narrival orbit will evolve to become the necessary departure\norbit at the desired departure time. Therefore, one or more\nmaneuvers are required to align the spaceship for departure.\n\nAs the EP input power level decreases, the amount of\nacceleration the EP delivers to the spaceship decreases, as\nwell. Consequently, the CP stage must compensate for the\n\xce\x94V deficit. From the Tsialkovsky rocket equation, it is well\nknown that the fuel mass required to perform a nearly\nimpulsive chemical burn increases exponentially as \xce\x94V\nincreases linearly, a trend seen clearly in Figure 11. The 2033\nopportunity is more affected by the loss of SEP input power\nthan the 2037 opportunity over the plotted domain because\nthe optimal flight times for the 2033 opportunity are shorter\nthan for the 2037 opportunity. Thus, the SEP has less time to\nprovide incremental acceleration for the 2033 opportunity.\n9\n\nFigure 11: Earth departure mass sensitivity to SEP input power and launch opportunity (40-ton payload). Horizontal\nblack line represents maximum mass to LDRO via single SLS launch and SEP spiral.\nMultiple strategies exist for achieving this task. One singleedge of the Mars SOI. As the size of the arrival/departure\nmaneuver option called the apo-twist uses the natural\nelliptical orbit shrinks, the fuel cost grows dramatically, as\nprecession of the arrival orbit (primarily due to the oblateness\nshown in Figure 12.\nof Mars) and a plane-change chemical burn at apoapsis [17].\nHowever, initial analysis indicates the apo-twist may not be\nThe size of the Mars orbit also affects the fuel required to\nappropriate for the hybrid architecture. Reasons include (1)\nperform crew operations at Mars. For example, a Phobos\nthe relative lack of precession of the spaceship orbit due to\nsurface mission requires the spaceship to rendezvous with a\nthe shorter Mars stay time (and the possibility of the large 10crew taxi vehicle, which takes the crew to Phobos orbit and\nsol orbit) and (2) the relative orientation of the arrival and\nreturns the crew from Phobos orbit to the spaceship.

The primary fuel costs of the solarmaneuvers because of the low cost of plane changes far from\nperturbation method lie in reaching and returning from the\nMars.\n\nFigure 12: Earth departure mass sensitivity to Mars orbit and launch opportunity (40-ton payload, 252-kW EP).\nHorizontal black line represents maximum mass to LDRO via single SLS launch and SEP spiral.

The cost is an\nincrease in the in-plane \xce\x94V required of the Mars crew taxi\nvehicle. However, this disadvantage may be offset if the taxi\nis required to perform significant out-of-plane maneuvers to\nreach the target orbit and return to the spaceship. Further, the\ninert mass of the taxi is significantly smaller than that of the\nspaceship, which is likely to make minimization of spaceship\n\xce\x94V a higher mission priority than minimization of taxi \xce\x94V.\nFor Mars surface missions a similar taxi approach can be used\nto transport the crew between the high elliptical Mars parking\norbit and a much lower orbit for rendezvous with landers for\ndescent and ascent.\n\nAs the taxi payload mass is refined, the time spent by the crew\nin the taxi must be taken into account, as well. A one-way\ntransfer is likely to be on the order of half a period of the\nspaceship orbit. Thus, the taxi associated with a 5-sol or 10sol spaceship orbit requires more crew resources than the taxi\nassociated with a 1-sol spaceship orbit.\n\n7. EVOLVABILITY\nIn the context of the Evolvable Mars Campaign the Hybrid\narchitecture presents a unique opportunity; it can evolve as\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of long duration exposure to space\nbeyond LEO increases. The high powered SEP can be used\nto retrieve the resources from near Earth space needed to\nmanufacture structures that serve as both centrifuges and\nradiation protection. These massive spacecraft could have\nthe same deep space habitat and HPS needed by the Hybrid\nat their core, but operate in a different manner. If significant\nadditional mass is needed for crew protection the Hybrid can\nevolve into a ballistic cycler concept, thus never loosing\norbital energy once the E-M and M-E trajectories are set.\nHPS vehicles can serve as reusable cargo carriers to cycler\nvehicles and the crew taxi developed for Phobos access could\nbe used to perform hyperbolic rendezvous with a modest\nincrease in to use the full CP component of the HPS. This\napproach would take significantly longer to field for Mars\nmissions, but is clearly possible and likely necessary to\nmaintain crew health for pioneers in the long term if there are\nno major breakthroughs in in-space transportation\ntechnology.\n\nThe potential advantages of the hybrid architecture over other\nrecent Mars transportation architectures include (1) no\nmission critical rendezvous with return stage in the Mars\nsphere of influence, (2) the elimination of spaceship\nintegration before Earth departure, (3) an increased potential\nfor habitation and propulsion stage reuse for crew and cargo,\n(4) a significant reduction in the mass required to be launched\nfrom Earth, and (5) evolution paths to mitigate long duration\nspace effects on crew. Thus, the hybrid strategy is an\nattractive alternative to facilitate crew missions to Mars. It is\none of several potential Mars architecture options to be\nfurther assessed as part of the Evolvable Mars Campaign.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was carried out at the NASA Langley Research\nCenter and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\nof Technology (under a contract with NASA), in\ncollaboration with colleagues from NASA's Johnson Space\nCenter, Glenn Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight\nCenter as part of the NASA Evolvable Mars Campaign effort.\n\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nA new Hybrid transportation architecture is being developed\nfor the Evolvable Mars Campaign that utilizes a single stage\nreusable spaceship. This \xe2\x80\x9chybrid\xe2\x80\x9d approach uses both solar\nelectric and chemical propulsion \xe2\x80\x93 a differentiation from\ncurrent approaches, which use a single propulsion technology\nfor transportation of crew or cargo. The hybrid architecture is\nshown to have the potential to reduce the risk, complexity,\nand potentially cost of crewed Mars missions relative to other\nrecent architectures.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Crusan, J.
