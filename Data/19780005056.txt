WEICK\nCONSULTANT\nVERO BEACH, FLORIDA\nThere are stories\nof cotton fields\nhaving been dusted by airplane\nas\nearly as 1917 and 1918.\nThe first\nwell recorded use of an airplane\nin\nagriculture,\nhowever, appears to have been on August 3, 1921, when a\ngrove of catalpa\ntrees near Troy, Ohio, was treated\nwith arsenate of\nlead powder to combat an infestation\nof Catalpa Sphinx caterpillars.\nThe report,\nwhich appeared in National\nGeographic\n(Mar. 1922) magazine,\nsaid in parts:\n"The plane used was a Curtis\nJN6 (Hisso-Jenny)\nequipped with\na hopper for carrying\nand liberating\nthe poison powder.\n"Not a tree could be found, and many were climbed and examined,\nwhose leaves did not bear particles\nof the deadly poison which\nwere easily\ndetected\nby the unaided eye.\n"A careful\ninvestigation\ncent of the caterpillars\n\nrevealed the fact that not over\nremained alive on the trees.\n\n1 per-\n\n"When one considers\nthe success which attended the test,\nconducted as it was with crude apparatus\nand without\nthe aid of\na guiding experience\nin the manipulation\nof the machine, it\nseems certain\nthat the airplane\nwill\nbe used successfully\nin\nthe future\nto control\nforest\ninsects.\n"Whether it will\nbe possible\nto employ this method for the\ntreatment\nof cotton or other low growing crops or even large\nfruit\norchards which permit the economical\nuse of terrestrial\nmachines remains to be seen.\nIn the treatment\nof tall\ntrees\nin park and forest\nareas, the tremendous saving in time and\nlabor in which its use would result\nseem to indicate\nthat the\nmethod is wholly practicable."\nThe predictions\nof these men made 55 years ago have been borne out to\nan extent that is probably well beyond their\nanticipations,\nfor the activity is now well enough established\nin this country\nso that it touches\nall of us in our daily\nlives.\nCommercial aerial\ndusting\nactivity\ncommenced shortly\nthereafter.\nOne\ncompany which was started\nin 1923 later\nsprouted Delta Air Lines, and it\nremained in operation\nas a small duster division\nuntil\nthe recent death\nof Dr. Coad, its manager.\nFor many years they used the Huff-Daland\nduster, a plane that was reworked from an unsuccessful\nNavy trainer\ndesign\nThe dusting\nactivity\nand which served the purpose very well as a duster.\ngrew slowly at first,\nbut by 1930 there were 20 to 30 companies operating\nwith about 100 airplanes.\n5\n\nBy the start\nof World War II, there were still\nonly a few hundred airImmediately\nafter\nthe war, however, a\nplanes in agricultural\nwork.\nremarkably\nrapid expansion took place which was made possible\nby three\nthe development during the war years of more potent\nfactors : first,\nsuch as DDT; second, the large number of training\nagricultural\nchemicals,\nairplanes\nadaptable\nfor agricultural\nuse that became available\nas surplus\nequipment at very low prices;\nthird,\nthe large number of trained\npilots\nreleased from service\nwho had sufficient\nfunds to purchase an airplane\nor two and to get started\nin application\nwork.\nThe growth was rapid and steady up to the early 195Os, when more than\n5000 airplanes\nwere listed\nby the CAA as being used in agricultural\nwork.\nThe number of operating\ncompanies reached nearly 2000.\nThese\nnumbers dropped off somewhat during the following\nyears as some of the\nsurplus airplanes\nwere used up and the weaker businesses\nfell\nby the\nwayside,\nbut they picked up again as new specially\ndesigned airplanes\nbecame available.\nIn 1950, the airplanes\nused for agricultural\npurposes in this country\nvaried over a wide range from heavy WWII bombers to the lightest\nof\nlight\nairblanes.\nWhen classed as heavy, medium and light,\nonly 3 percent\nwere in the heavy category.\nThese were mainly Douglas DC-3, Boeing 247,\nand Ford Trimotor\nairplanes.\nNearly half of the planes were in the medium\nclass.\nMost of these were Boeing-Stearmans,\nwhich originally\nhad 220-hp\nradial\nengines some of which had been replaced\nby 450-hp radials.\nIn the\nmedium category\nthere were also a number of Navy N3N training\nplanes with\nengines ranging from 220 to 450 hp.\nBoth the Stearman and the N3N designs\nwere very rugged since they were built\nfor military\nstudent training,\nand they were well adapted to agricultural\nuse.\nOther airplanes\nin the\nmedium category\nincluded\na few Travel Airs,\nWacos, Pitcairns,\nCurtis\nRobins, BT 13s, etc.\nThe light\ncategory\nalso included\nnearly half of the airplanes.\nMost\nof these were Piper Cubs, from 65 hp up to 150 hp. The 135 and 150-hp\nSupercub models were fitted\nwith hoppers for agriculture\nuse by the\nfactory.\nThe rest of the light\nplanes were mostly Aeroncas, with a few\nLuscombs, Cessna 120s and 14Os, and a sprinkling\nof others.\nUp to 1950, substantially\nall these planes had to be converted\ncultural\nuse, usually\nby the operator\nhimself,\nwho also usually\nand built\nthe dusting\nand spraying\nequipment,\n\nfor agridesigned\n\nAIRCRAFT DESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR AERIAL APPLICATION - (Excerpts\nfrom previously\npublished\nmaterial)\nThe first\nairplane\ndesigned from the ground up for the purpose of distributing\nagricultural\nmaterials\nwas the experimental\nAg-1, which was\ndeveloped in 1949-1950 at the Texas A&M Aircraft\nResearch Center.\nThe\nproject\nwas initiated\nby the National\nFlying Farmers Association,\nand\nwas carried\nout under the sponsorship\nof the Civil\nAeronautics\nAdministration,\nthe U.

special\nslot-lip\nailerons,\nwhich together\nmade possible\nflight\nat exceptionally\nlow speed with rapid\nresponse to aileron\ncontrol.\nIt was fitted\nwith both a hopper in the\nfuselage\nfor dust (27 cubic feet)\nand tanks in the thick wing for spray\nfluid\n(150-gallon\ntotal)\nfor change from dust to spray without\nany loss\nof time.\nThe pilot\'s\nfield\nof view was exceptional\nand was considered\nadequate in every respect\nby the 500 pilots\nwho reported\non it.\nAt the\nsame time the pilot\nwas located to the rear of all loads and heavy masses,\nin a cockpit\ndesigned to protect\nhim, and with a long and substantial\nstructure\nahead of him designed to fail\nprogressively\nand reduce the\nshock in a nose-down crash.\nAs stated previously,\ninvestigations\nover the past ten years show that\nhuman beings can ordinarily\nwithstand\nlow-speed airplane\ncrashes without\ninjury\nif adequate support and protection\nare provided\n(references\n1 and\nIt is

seat belt for\nsuitable\nsupport in this regard.\nNearly all the fatal\naccidents\nthat have occurred\nin crop-control\nflying\nin this country have been associated\nwith either\nstalls\nor collisions\nwith\nobstructions\n(usually\nelectric\nwires or trees)\n(reference\n3).\nIn these\naccidents\nthe nose of the airplane\nusually\nstrikes\nthe ground at approximately\nthe minimum flying\nspeed of the airplane.\nBecause of the low\nspeed at contact,\nthis type of accident\nis definitely\nsurvivable.\nIt\nfollows,\nand it is now generally\naccepted,\nthat a large proportion\nof the\nserious and fatal\ninjuries\nassociated\nwith these crashes could be prevented by suitable\nairplane\ndesign coupled with the use of a suitable\nshoulder harness in addition\nto the seat belt.\nA novel arrangement combining the shoulder harness with the seat belt\nwas used in the Ag-1 airplane.\nThis arrangement\nhas been found to be\neasily\nand quickly\nfastened,\nand it allows the pilot\nfreedom of movement.\nIt thus appears to overcome the main objections\nof duster pilots\nto the\nuse of shoulder harness.\nIt has been tried\nand apparently\nfavorably\naccepted by the many pilots\nwho have flown the Ag-1 airplane\nfor the\npurpose of evaluating\nit.\nThe basis of the Ag-1 installation\nwas a standard Navy seat belt and\nshoulder harness (reference\n4) which is strong enough to support a 200pound man experiencing\nan acceleration\nof 40 g (or momentary load 40 times\nthe man\'s wei,ght, or 8000 pounds).\nIt has been demonstrated\nthat a man\ncan withstand\nmomentary acceleration\nof this order when properly\nsupported\n(references\n5 and 6).\nSince the indications\nfrom safety\nbelt failures\nare that accelerations\nof 15 to 25 g are likely\nto be obtained\nin crashes\nof the kind under consideration,\na harness capable of withstanding\na 40 g\nacceleration\nappears to be well warranted.\nAdequate support for this\nharness is, of course, necessary.\n\n10\n\nThe harness as originally\ninstalled\nhad the usual loop at the lower end\nof each shoulder strap which the pilot\nhad to slip over a portion\nof the\nThus there were four

shoulder\nharness even when it is available.\nThe only final\nchange made in the Ag-1 installation,\nafter\nconsiderable\nexperimentation,\nwas the permanent attachment\nof each shoulder\nstrap to\nEach attachment\nwas made by means\nits respective\nside of the seat belt.\nof a piece of l/8-inch\nflexible\nsteel cable, using a standard thimble\nin\nthe eye at each end and lapspliced\nby means of oval sleeves compressed\nwith a hand squeezing tool.\nThe overall\nlength was made as short as\nfeasible.\nAfter the harness has been disengaged,\nit has been found convenient\nfor\na pilot\nto rest each side on a hook on the fuselage\nwall.\nThere are no\nloose ends to hunt for.\nOn entering\nhe merely sits down and slips\neach\nside on. This is usually\nquicker\nand easier than locating\nand straightening\nout the ends of the ordinary\nseat belt alone.\nThe single\nfastening\nof the\nbelt is the.only\none that is made.\nIt was thought at first\nthat this arrangement of harness and belt might\nrequire\nslightly\nmore time to get out of following\na crash, but experience with it to date under ordinary\ncircumstances\nindicates\nthat the\ndifference\nin time probably would be negligible.\nAt the rear, the shoulder\nstraps slide over a tubular\nsupport and down\nto an inertia-locking\nreel mounted on the rear wall of the cockpit.\nThe\ntwo shoulder\nstraps are linked\ntogether\nby a whippletree\nand a single\ncable extends down to the inertia\nreel.\nThe reel itself\nis provided with\na light\nspring which tends to keep the cable wound up on it.\nUnder ordinary\nconditions\nthe pilot\nfreedom of movement is adequate for\ncockpit\nduties.\n\ncould lean forward easily.\nHis\ncomfort and attendance\nto ordinary\n\nIf the airplane\nis given a deceleration\nof 3 g or more, such as would\noccur in even a mild crash, the inertia\nreel locks the harness in the\nposition\nit has at the start.\nIt does this because the inertia\nof the\nreel itself,\nwhich is going forward with the airplane,\ncauses it to continue forward against\na light\nspring pressure and to engage with a ratchet\nwhich locks it in place.\nThus, the pilot\'s\nshoulders\nare restrained\nfrom\ngoing forward while the airplane\nis coming to a stop.\nAs soon as it has\ncome to a stop, the freedom of movement is available\nagain if he should\ndesire it.\nIf the pilot\nknows in advance that he may crash he can, if he desires,\nlock the shoulder\nharness in the rear position\nby moving a handle located\non the left\nside of his seat.\n11\n\nThe inertia\nreel has been found to be a great convenience,\nparticularly\nfor the duster pilot.\nHowever, the modification\nin which each shoulder\nstrap is fastened\npermanently\nto its respective\nside of the seat belt\ncan be used whether or not an inertia\nreel\' is incorporated.\nDemonstration\n\nTour of Ag-1 Airplane\n\nDuring 1951 the CAA took the Ag-1 airplane\non a demonstration\ntour throughAt each stop the airplane\nwas demonstrated\nby\nout most of the country.\na CAA pilot\nand then was flown and evaluated\nby other pilots,\nlargely\nduster and sprayer operators.\nIn all,\nover 650 pilots\nflew the airplane\nand approximately\n500 filled\nout forms indicating\ntheir\nevaluation\nof its\nSince it was a single-place\nairplane,\nthe pilqt\nvarious\ncharacteristics.\nhad no opportunity\nto receive dual control\ninstruction\nor to be checked\nout by a pilot\nfamiliar\nwith it.\nThe mere fact that the Ag-1 survived\nthis treatment\nand returned\nto College Station\nappears to be some vindication\nof both its handling\ncharacteristics\nand its ruggedness.\nIt is desirable\nto obtain a pilot\'s\nconsidered\njudgement of an airplane\nafter\nhe has become used to it and has had considerable\nexperience\nwith\nit.\nHis first\nimpression,\nsuch as was obtained\nin the one or two flights\npossible, for each pilot\nduring this tour,\nis often different\nfrom his\nopinion after\nhe is familiar\nwith the airplane.\nThe first\nimpressions\nof several\nhundred pilots\nhowever are of substantial\nvalue.\nIn an average\nof all the ratings,\n90 percent were "satisfactory"\nor better,\nwith 67\npercent "excellent."\nOverall,\n2 percent of the ratings\nwere "unsatisfactory.\'\nOf the 37 characteristics\nevaluated,\nthe two rated lowest were\nconsidered\nunsatisfactory\nby about one-seventh\nof the pilots\nwho checked\nthem.\nAfter two and one-half\nyears\ndemonstration\nflying,\nit was\nwell have greater\npower when\nMotors Corporation\nhas agreed\nmately 300 horsepower available\n\nof testing,\nspray pattern\nchecking,\nand\nagreed generally\nthat the airplane\ncould\noperating\nunder full\nload, and the Continental\nto donate a motor which would have approxifor take-off.\n\n12\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAccident\nSurvival\n- Airplane\nand Passenger Automobile.\n1.

of the acreage,\nis estimated\nto exceed 200 million.\nEstimates\non acres treated\nfor insect\ncontrol\nvary\nfrom 40 to 65 percent of the total.\nAerial\napplication\nprograms conducted\nby various\nfederal\nand state agencies normally\naverage from 30 to 40 million\nacres annually.\nAlthough these figures\nrepresent\nacreage treated\nby aerial\napplications,\ncredit\nshould also be given for the use of aircraft\nto release\nsterile\ninsects.\nThe areas over which sterile\ninsects\nare released\nalmost\ndaily\ninvolve\nthousands of square miles.\nSterile\n\nInsect\n\nReleases\n\nThe sterile\ninsect\nrelease technique\nwas first\nused successfully\nto eradicate\nthe screwworm from the United States during the 1950s.\nSterile\ninsects\nhave since been used to eradicate\nseveral\nspecies of flies\nfrom several\nislands\nin the Pacific.\nThe technique\nwas used to eradicate\nthe Mediterranean\nfruit\nfly from the Los Angeles area last winter.\nAircraft\nhave released\nsterile\npink bollworm moths in the\xe2\x80\x98lower\nSan Joaquin Valley of California,\nsix days\nper week, from May into November, annually\nsince 1968.\nAlthough a few wild\npink bollworm moths have been caught in that area, there is no known pink\nbollworm infestation\nin the San Joaquin Valley.\nTests have also been conducted\nwith aerial\nreleases\nof sterile\nboll weevil,\nCaribbean fruit\nfly,\nand codling\nmoth.\nTo use this technique\nrequires\na facility\nto rear millions\nof insects\nevery\nweek.\nIn most cases, the insects\nare made sterile\nby exposure to radiation.\nIn others,\nchemo-sterilants\nare used.\nWhen the insects\nare irradiated\nin the\npupal stage, it is necessary to have holding\nrooms in which temperature\nand\nThis provides\na control\nover the number of insects\nhumidity\ncan be controlled.\nthat must be released each day.\nWhenathe free release technique\nis used, it\nis necessary to have a walk-in\nrefrigerator\nfor loading\nthe insects\ninto the\nfree release machines.\nBefore beginning\nthe screwworm eradication\nprogram in the southeastern\nstates,\nthe technique\nwas proven by eradicating\nthe screwworm from the island\nof Curacao in the Caribbean Sea.\nFor that test,\nthe sterile\nflies\nwere\npackaged in small paper bags.\nA man, riding\nwith the pilot,\ntore the top off\neach bag as he tossed it out of the window.\nFor the program in Florida,\nand the first\nfew years out of Mission,\nTexas, the paper bag was replaced\nby\nboxes about 2 l/2 x 4 x 6 inches.\nA machine was designed for installation\nin\n\n17\n\nthe aircraft\nthat dispersed\nthe boxes at controlled\nintervals,\nopening each\nbox to release the flies\nas it left\nthe

into the dispersing\nmachine.\nWhen we first\nbegan releasing\nsterile\npink bollworm moths, they were packaged\nin paper cylinders\nabout 2 l/2 inches in diameter and 4 inches long.\nA measured\nTo

first\nit was believed\nthat some type of container\nwas necessary to protect\nthe insects\nfrom the sudden airblast\nas they were released\ninto the slipstream.\nHowever, numerous tests\nshowed that they could withstand\nreleases\nat speeds\nSince the insects\ncould be chilled\nup to 180 mph without\napparent injury.\nand held at cold temperatures\nfor some time, it was decided to use small\ndeep freezers\nto carry them in the aircraft,\ndevise a method to disperse\nthem,\nand thus eliminate\nall the small containers.\nA 6-cubic-foot\ndeep freeze will\nhold up to 1 l/2 million\ninsects.\nThe machine\ncan be loaded through the doors of a Cessna 172, 180, or 182.\nCargo doors are\nmore suitable\nbecause it is necessary to place the machine into the aircraft\nprior to each flight.\nThe inside mechanism is removable.\nIt consists\nof a\nframework that holds multiple\nflat\ntrays.\nInsects\nare placed on the trays\nto a depth of l/2 to 3/4 inch in a cold room.\nAt the bottom is a funnel into\nwhich the trays drop the insects.\nIt has a controllable\nspeed belt and an\nadjustable\norifice\nto control\nthe release rate.\nAn electric\neye in the funnel\nautomatically\ntriggers\nthe release of the trays,\nbeginning\nwith the bottom\ntrays and continuing\nupward, in sequence, to maintain\na supply of insects\nin\nthe funnel.\nFrom the funnel,\nthe insects\nfall\ninto a long tube that extends\nto the tail\nso they will\nfall\nclear of the aircraft.\nThe entire\noperation\nis automatic.\nThe pilot\nhas a small box that he can

today.\nCurrent models are available\nin two sizes,\nwith several\nscreen sizes,\nand\nWhen the ultra\nlow volume technique\nwas developed,\nadjustable\npitch propellers.\nsmall spinners\ncame into

through a\nspinner reduces its .speed.\nTheir rotational\nspeed is quite sensitive\nto\nchanges in airspeeds.\nThis led to the development of rheostat-controlled\nscreen, the Bals\nelectrically\ndriven spinners , such as the Fisher spinning\nspinning\ndiscs,\nand the Becomist.\nThe mistake commonly made with small\nspinners\nis the forcing\nof too much material\nthrough them, which destroys\ntheir\nperformance\nand the main purpose of their\nuse.\nSpinners,\nused properly,\nwill\nproduce more uniform droplets\nthan fixed\nnozzles.\nBut is this necessary?\nSeveral years ago, we equipped an aircraft\nwith flat\nfan nozzles,\nhollow cone nozzles,\nand several\ntypes of spinners.\nAn application\nrate was selected\nthat would provide only a partial\nkill\nof\nthe insects\non which the test was conducted.\nThe same rate per acre was\napplied\nthrough each device.\nThe intent\nwas to determine which of these\ndevices might give the best kill.\nThe tests were replicated\na number of times,\nchanging only the order in which each type of device was used during each\nmorning.\nWhen the results\nwere analyzed,\nthere was no detectable\ndifference\nin insect\nkill\nwith any of the devices.\nOne of the serious\nproblems at the moment is achieving\nof citrus\nleaves with insecticides.\nWe have a citrus\n20\n\ngood underleaf\ncoverage\nblackfly\ninfestation\n\nin Florida\nand another in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\nThis insect\nmoves very little\nand remains under the leaves.\nTests have been

JOHNSON\nAIR ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMy primary\nare on the\nwith those\nlook like\nmeeting.\n\nemphasis today will\nbe on the new breed of aircraft,\nthose which\nThese will\nbe compared with those of the past and\nmarket today.\nWe have no idea what the future\naircraft\nwill\nof the future.\nor how it will\nhandle.\nIts development\nis the purpose of this\n\nThere are 10 or 12 aircraft\ntypes on the market today which we call the new\nbreed-all\nare similar\nto the Ag Cat, Ag Wagon, Thrush, and Weatherly.\nIn\nspeaking today I will\nrefer\nto the average operator.\nThis average operator\nusing the new breed of planes covers somewhere between 75 to 150 acres per\nhour depending on the type of work he is doing.\nThis operator\ngrosses between $80 000 and $125 000 per aircraft\nper season.\nGenerally,\neach aircraft\nflies\nfrom 400 to 700 hours depending on the geographical\narea.\nTwenty years ago the average operator\ncovered from 40 to 60 acres per hour\nThe annual\nusing converted\nmilitary\nplanes,\nold Stearmans,\nCubs, etc.\ngross per aircraft\nwas $25 000 to $50 000 with 400 to 500 hours of flight\nThe pilots\nwere much more fatigued\nthan those of today, al,though we\ntime.\nnow fly as many or more hours.\nWhat we would like to see in the future\naircraft,\nalthough we may not get\nit,\nis one which would be capable of producing\n150 to 200 acres per hour.\nWe would like to turn over a gross of between $200 000 and $325 000 per\nNow that is not to say that we will\nbe able\naircraft\nper season or higher.\nbut it certainly\nwould be nice particularly\nin light\nto meet this figure,\nof the increased\ncost of the planes.\nIn\nI bought my first\nStearman for $5000, and that was high at the time.\nlater years we purchased Ag Cats for $30 000, and today we pay $70 000 for\nThe price per acre has gone up only 25 to 30 percent in the\nan Ag Cat.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nonly because of the higher production\nlast 20 years.\nWhy is that?\nWe are able to produce more acres per\ncapabilities\nof the newer planes.\nhour or, if you want to convert\nthat, more dollars\nper hour.\nThe performance\nparameters mentioned above (150 and 200 acres per hour with\na gross of $200 000 to $325 000 per aircraft\nper season) could be met by\nusing planes similar\nto those of today but with improved flying\ntechniques\nThis would be based on a use rate of beand different\nequipment designs.\ntween 500 and 700 hours per season, keeping in mind that this would be an\nAssuming that this plane\naverage for both short and 12-month seasons.\ncould be built\n(meeting these requirements\nas well as other demands) for\nbetween $150 000 and $350 000, I am certain\nthe industry\nwould find it\nacceptable.\n\n35\n\nA little\nhistory\nof my operations,\nI mentioned that the first\naircraft\nI\nI figured\nto pay it off in one year-which\nwe did.\nbought was a Stearman.\nAt that time we flew only about 400 hours per aircraft\nand sprayed some\nThis is again my operation;\n20 000 acres.\nnow we are up at 5 and 6 gallon/\nacre work.\nThis was 18 years ago.\' In 1967 I bought a 450 Ag Cat, sprayed\napproximately\n30 000 acres, and flew 450 hours, a very low hourly increase\nbut again a large increase\nin acreage.\nAnd I expected to pay that aircraft\noff in three years, which I did.\nLater I bought a 600 Ag Cat, flying\nan\naverage of 600 hours and spraying\nsomewhere near 40 000 acres per season.\nAlso I paid it off in three years.\nThe future\nbreed I would expect could\nbe paid off somewhere in five to six years.\nYou are getting\ninto more\nsophisticated\nequipment,\nand you are going to have different\npilots\nflying\nthem than you do today.\nThey are about the same pilots-just\na little\nsharper.\nA very serious\nconstraint\nwould be the length of season that an operator\nwould have.\nIf he is up in North Dakota and operating\nfor only two weeks\nor three weeks out of the year, there is no way in the world he is going to\nmake this airplane\npay for itself.\nBut the average operator\naround the\ncountry today works anywhere from six to nine months, and he should have a\nlong enough season to pay it off.\nThis is similar\nto my operation\nnow; we\nare operating\nroughly seven months out of the year, and I feel as though\nthese more expensive planes would be advantageous\nto us.\nOver the years our industry\nhas made improvements\non its own. As you heard\nearlier\nwhen Mr. Cobb was speaking,\noperators\nhave developed newer systems\nor they have improved the old ones over the years,\nbut basically\nwe are\nstill\noperating\non the same equipment that we operated 20 years ago.\nI am\ntalking\nabout spray dispersal\nequipment now. We have improved the airplane.\nThe boom that I had on my Stearman is about the same boom that is hanging\non the Ag Cat today.\nI am not saying that that is not doing a good job,\nbut I am sure there could be quite a few improvements made, not only on the\nboom but also nozzlingc\nand whatever goes with the boom. In the last 10 or\n12 years there has been very little\nimprovement made by the industry.\nThey\nhave improved what they have, but basically\nthere has been no new development.\nWe, as operators,\nare entirely\ntoo busy today to be developing\nnewer equipment.\nWe are trying\nto stay in business and also meet with the present requirements\nof the EPA and a few other regulatory\nagencies.\nThey are doing\nthe job they are supposed to, but some regulatory\npeople have a picture\nof\nour industry\nthat has been distorted\nsome. These pictures\nthat they\nhave were drawn 10, 15, or 20 years ago\xe2\x80\x98when we did have a lot of problems.\nI think operators\naround the country have improved their\nown operations\nenough to where a lot of regulations\nwe are being forced to live with today\nhave already been controlled.\nI am sure the regulations\nare aimed at the\noperators\nwho are not operating\nup to Hoyle and are operating\nin high winds,\nOf course,\na lot of this has\netc.,\nand these are the problem operators.\ncome from bad publicity\nover the years.\nThe papers do not print\nanything\ngood.\nThe people do not like to read it,\nI suppose.\nThe future\naircraft\n\n36\n\nbeing designed around our problem areas can stop further\nharrassing\nregulations and possibly\ncancel out some present ones.\nIf I had an ideal situation,\nI would like to perform my spraying\noperation\nbetween the hours of\nmidnight\nand 4:00 a.m. in the morning,\nfrom an altitude\nof 500 feet.\nI see\nI am sure you wonder why I feel that way.\nWell,\na lot of puzzled looks.\nas far as elimination\nof any further\nregulations,\nI feel that first,\nno one\nwould notice any spray drift.\nSecond, at 500 feet I would not hit anything.\nAnd third,\nno one would see me. And I think this is a lot of our problem.\nWe are too obvious out there.\nYou could put 20 ground sprayers on the same\nfarm, and nobody would complain at all about anything\nthey are doing, but\n(And we get the blame.)\nyou put one airplane,\nand everybody sees you.\nThat is a little\nfar fetched,\nbut I mean this is one way of trying\nto avoid\nhaving any more regulations\nthrown on us.\nAircraft\nmeeting the future\nrequirements\nshould eliminate\nmany regulations\nThe ground\nnow existing\nfor both the pilot\nand also ground crew personnel.\npersonnel\'s\nexposure would be shortened\ntremendously,\nbecause of shortened\nperiods of exposure of chemicals.\nMore than likely,\nthe newer type loading\nsystems meeting the future\nagricultural\naircraft\nrequirements\ncould be developed,\nsuch as closed systems, and preqmixed load systems.\nPilots\nof the future would have to spend more time keeping their\nskills\nGo through training\nsessharpened,\nbecoming more like an airline\npilot.\nsions,\ndoing less routine\nchores than he is today such as his maintenance\nMany operators\nand pilots\ntoday are doing more\nand his field\ncrop service.\nchores than flying.\nI think the pilot\nof the future\nis strictly\ngoing to\nbe a pilot.\nIn my operation\nhe has been that way for years.\nAnd I know of\nseveral operations\naround the country in which the pilot\ndoes nothing but\nfly.\nBut some operators\nhaven\'t\nbeen able to get this far advanced, but\nthey are going to have to have pilots\nthat are extremely\nsharp.\nAnother very serious\nconstraint\nwould be the lack of highly\nskilled\npilots.\nWe would have to look at improving\nour training\nfacilities.\nThe old type\n"Johnny crop duster"\nof 20 years ago certainly\nwould not fill\nthe bill\ntoday.\nHe is the.one that a lot of you people in Washington have had the\nimage of, the old guy sitting\nin the corner with a cloth helmet, goggles,\nand boots.\nThat was in the corner of a bar, too, by the way.\nAnd if you\nwanted him to go to work you knew where to find him-that\nwas his office.\nBut today that\'s\ndifferent,\nand we are trying\nto change this image.\nThat\nman certainly\nwould not fill\nthe bill\nfor current\nor future\naircraft.\nAlong with any new equipment that is developed,\nwe\'ve got to constantly\nHe must have comfort to reduce fatigue.\nThis has\nkeep in mind the pilot.\nbeen one of the biggest\nassets to the new breed of aircraft\nover the older\nbreed.\nI find that I can fly twice as many hours as I did 20 years .ago and\nMainly that has been because of reduced fatigue\ndue\nnot be near as tired.\nto enclosing\ncockpits,\ngetting\nrid of spray odors, and reducing\nthe noise\nfactor.\nAnother item I think we should be concerned with is the over reguAs I mentioned about flying\nat night at 500\nlation\nof what we face today.\nfeet,\nnoise would possibly\nbe eliminated\nalso.\nNoise is one thing that we\n\n37\n\nBuilding\naircraft\naround this problem,\nshould be looking\nat in the future.\nwhether it be turbine\npower, different\npropeller\ndesign, whatever-we\nI think in a sense we are making a big change in\nshould keep this in mind.\nnoise levels with the new turbine\ntype aircraft\nthat have been developed in\nthe last few years.\nThis is a problem area and always\nAnother factor\nto keep in mind is drift.\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ti sure many aspects can be looked at which would reduce\nhas been.\nInsect and disease control\ncan be changed, like utilizing\nvapor as\ndrift.\nWe are doing some of\na means of insect\ncontrol\ninstead of contact\nspray.\nin some insect\ncontrol.\nthis at the present time ; we do use vaporization\nBut maybe this will\nbe the complete answer of the future.\nThis way you\ncould apply a coarse spray which vaporizes\nand does its job instead of a\ndirect\ncontact\nspray trying\nto apply on the target.\nNow of course, this\nisn\'t\ngoing to cover every aspect of the industry,\nbut it could be a help.\nI don\'t know how you could vaporize\nand use herbicides\nsafely.\nI think\nthat is our problem now.\nWe need to develop an accurate\nswath marking system, as George showed you\nYou have a flagman that sits\nthis morning.\nSwath marking is important.\ndown on the job, and you will\nleave a streak.\nI did talk with the NASA\nand they already\nhave some ideas on what\npeople at the Washington meeting,\nthey can do, and I am sure it would be something that will\nbe looked at\nThis would also ease the pilot\nagain and take his mind\nfor the future.\noff watching\nhis last mark, which is a constant\nsource of strain,\nand\nIt would also assure and show our regulatory\npeople accurate\nfatigue.\nchemical placement.,\nThe future\naircraft\nshould still\nbe able to maneuver around trees and other\nI would say that its size would\nobjects\nand not be cumbersome and bulky.\nbe restricted,\nbut it still\nwould have to be able to land in unproved landing areas and also be able to take off out of the same area.\nYou want to\nlook at length of wing compared with boom length for drift\nelimination.\nThis is something some operators\nare already doing.\nBut I am sure this is\nsomething we would want to keep in mind for the future\naircraft.\nThese\nI was talkaircraft\nneed to be placed in a special\nmaintenance\ncategory.\ning to a fellow\nthis morning about a complete new category\njust for agricultural\naircraft.\nWe are under the restricted\ncategory\nat the present\ntime, but I think that agricultural\naircraft\nshould be almost in a category\nof its own.\nWe should be looking\nat ferry speed compared with application\nspeed.\nSatellite.runways\ncould be reduced by an ai:Icraft\'s\nferry\nspeed being increased.\nThe idea would be ferry\n200 and spray at 100. Again, I am asking\nfor a lot,\nbut I am giving you the far exception\nto the rule.\nMostly what\nI discussed\nhere today has been developed from problems of the past and\nareas that I feel we could improve on in the future.\n\n38\n\nOPERATIONAL MISSION ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION\nJ.

appropriate\nfor application,\nit is essential\nthat the regulations\nand procedures\npertinent\nto aircraft\ncertification\nbe current\nand, most important,\nbe realistically\nappropriate\nto agricultural\naviation.\nAt this time, it is not clear that all the requirements\nthat are being applied\nto agricultural\naviation\naircraft\nare appropriate.\nIf this is a correct\nassumption , and if the fruits\nof NASA agricultural\naviation\nprograms are to be realized,\nthen we must construct\na system in\nwhich it is conducive\nfor the results\nof research to be readily\napplied\nto the

observations\nand recommendations\nfor research and\ndevelopment.\nRegulatory\n\nBasis\n\nA regulatory\nbasis for aircraft\nthe past 50 years by a series\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\ncertification\nhas been developed over\nof acts by the U. S. Congress, namely:\n\nAir Commerce Act of 1926\nCivil\nAeronautics\nAct of 1938\nFederal Aviation\nAct of 1958.\n\nIn each of these\nregard to aircraft\n\nacts, the administrator\nhas had a clear mandate with\ncertification.\nMay I quote this mandate?\n-\n\n49\n\nIf the administrator\nfinds that such aircraft,\naircraft\nengine, propeller,\nor appliance\nis of proper design, material,\nconstruction,\nand performance\nfor safe operaspecification,\ntion and meets the minimum requirements,\nstandards,\nrules,\nand regulations\nprescribed\nby the administrator,\nhe shall\nissue a type certificate\nthereof.\nThat is the basis for the aircraft\ncertification\nsystem, and the Federal\nAviation\nAdministrator\nhas established\nstandards,\nrules,\nand regulations\npertinent\nto agricultural\naircraft\ncertification.\nThe regulations\nfrom\nwhich the certification\nbasis is established\nfor the agricultural\naircraft\nin production\nand operation\ntoday are as follows:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n\nCivil\nAir Regulations\n(CAR) Part 3\nCivil\nAir Regulations\n(CAR) Part 6\nCivil\nAir Regulations\n(CAR) Part 8\nCivil\nAeronautics\nManual (CAM) 8\nFederal Aviation\nRegulations\n(FAR) Part\nFederal Aviation\nRegulations\n(FAR) Part\nFederal Aviation\nRegulations\n(FAR) Part\n\n23 21 27 -\n\nAirplane\nAirworthiness\nRotorcraft\nAirworthiness\nRestricted\nCategory\nRestricted\nCategory\nAirplane\nAirworthiness\nProcedural\nRules\nRotorcraft\nAirworthiness\n\nMany of you may know that the Civil\nAir Regulations\n(CARS) were recodified in the early 1960s as Federal Aviation\nRegulations\n(FARs).\nCAR 3\nand CAR 6 were recodified\nto FAR 23 and FAR 27 for airplanes\nand rotorcraft,respectively,\nand CAR 8 was recodified\nto FAR 21.25, for restricted\ncategory\naircraft..\nAlthough\nthe CARS have been recodified,\nthey are\nstill\napplicable\nto those aircraft\ntypes for which the CARS are referenced on the type design data sheet as the certification\nbasis.\nWhen\nthese older aircraft\nare modified,\nit is done on the basis of the minimum standards\nspecified\nin the applicable\nCARS. However, an applicant\nwith the new type design must show compliance with the Federal Air Regulations\n(FARs).\nIn the past, CAR 8 and CAM 8 provided\na needed liberal\nbasis upon which to certificate\nan agricultural\naircraft.\nIn view of\nrecodification,\nthere seems to be some question\nas to whether CAM 8 is\nstill\npertinent\nand can be used as policy.\nIt can!\nFAA Advisory\nCircular 20-33B references\nthe older CAMS and states\nthat the policy material\ncontained\ntherein\nmay be used in conjunction\nwith specific\nsections\nof\nLet\'s review certification\nbasis for\nthe Federal Aviation\nRegulations.\nthe current\nproduction\nagricultural\nairplane\ntypes.\nA predominant\nnumber have been certificated\nin accordance with the standards\nof CAR 8 and\nCAM 8, Appendix B.

It is appropriate\ndures in mind as new technology\nis developed and applied\nto civil\nairindustry\nhas not readily\napcraft.\nIn the past, the general aviation\nplied the results\nof NASA\'s new technology\ndevelopments.\nPart of that\nproblem has been generated because the FAA has not been aggressive\nin\nrecognizing\nthese new technological\ndevelopments\nand in setting\nforth\nthe applicable\ncivil\nsafety\ncriteria\nfor the guidance of industry.\nWith\nindustry\ncan make plans to use the new technology\nsuch timely\nguidance,\nThis is an area\nand can determine what the certification\nrisks are.\nthat needs to be explored more progressively.\nAgricultural\n\nAircraft\n\nSafety\n\nFactors\n\nThe development of appropriate\nregulations\nfor new technology\nand the\nand the need for research and development\nis\ncertification\nprocedures,\nfrequently\nmotivated\nby the accident\nstatistics\nand factors.\nIt would\nappear appropriate\nthen to review the current\ninformation\non accident\nrecords for agricultural\naircraft\nfor 1974, those currently\navailable\n\n51\n\nfrom NTSB. Figure 1 shows total\naccident\nrates for 100 000 aircraft\nhours flown with the various\nkinds of general aviation\nflying\nin 1971\nthrough 1974.\nThe accident\nrate for aerial\napplication\nin 1974 is considerably\nabove, almost double in fact,\nthe general aviation\naverage\nrate and almost equal to that of pleasure\nflyfng.\nThis reflects,\nin\nmy opinion,\nthe nature of the business and the continuous\nexposure and\nrisk involved.\nA more discouraging\nsign, however, is the increasing\nrate in 1974 after\nseveral years of an improving\ntrend.\nFigure 2 shows\nthe fatal\naccident\nrate per 100 000 aircraft\nhours flown for the various\nkinds of general aviation\nflying\nfor 1971-1974.\nThe fatal\naccident\nrate\nfor aerial\napplication\nin 1974 is below that of the general aviation\naverage rate and is less than half that of pleasure\nflying.\nYou can\nobserve the contrast\nbetween total\naccidents\nand fatal\naccidents\nand\nthe favorable\nposition\nof the fatal\naccident\nrate in comparison.\nThis\nwould indicate\nthat even though the exposure is high and continuous,\nthe contact\nspeeds with the ground and objects\nare lower, crashworthiness designed provisions\nare contributing\nfavorably,\nand professional\npilots\ncan control\nthe aircraft\nmuch better\nin adverse situations.\nA\nsurvey was made of the accident\nfactors\ninvolved\nin 467 accidents.\n(See\nTable III.)\nStall/mush\nand the engine failure/malfunction\nare the most\nfrequent\ntype accident.\nThe swath run, procedure\nturn-around,\nand the\ninitial\nclimb are the operational\nphases in which agricultural\naircraft\naccidents\noccurred most frequently.\nIt is significant\nto note that\nonly 31 fatal\naccidents\noccurred during 1974 in aerial\napplication\noperations.\nEngine failure\nor malfunction\naccounted for 30 percent\n(139)\nof the total\nnumber of accidents.\nThe increasing\ntrend in aerial\napplication\naccident\nrate in 1974, together\nwith the high percentage\nof\ntotal\naccidents\ncaused by engine failure/malfunction,indicate\nthat a\nmore in-depth\nstudy of accident\ndata could identify\nareas where needed\nresearch could contribute\nto safety\nimprovement-particularly\nin the\noperational\nphases.\nSome Problem Areas\nThe proper utilization\nof the agricultural\naircraft\nis the worry of\nevery successful\nagricultural\noperator,\nand I am sure if he is unsuccessful,\nhe is worried\nabout that too, but he opts for higher payload\nand maximum acreage coverage per day.\nHe keeps safety\nin mind!\nHowever, higher payloads than normal reduce performance\nand quite often\nadversely\naffect\nthe aircraft\nhandling\ncharacteristics.\nHigh utilization per day has its effect\non pilot\nfatigue.\nThese areas quite often\nlead to problems.\nLet us take a look at just a few examples....\nStall\nwarning is a required\nsafety feature\nwhich advises the pilot\nof impending stall\nsufficiently\nabove the stall\nso the pilot\ncan take corrective\naction.\nYet some agricultural\nairplane\npilots\nare disconnecting\nthe\nstall\nwarning system to avoid the incessant\nnoise during the continuous\nspraying\nand maneuvering\noperations\nwhere they may be operating\nclose\nto stall.\nWith the new technology\nthat has been developed in recent\nyears in sensors and rate mechanisms, and new emphasis on the stall\n\n52\n\nspin research by NASA, hopefully\na new method can be found to provide\nstall\nwarning which can eliminate\nthe nerve-wracking\nconditions\nof\nnuisance noise that the agricultural\npilot\nmust now endure.\nMeeting the aircraft\'s\nstability\nrequirements\nin a given phase of flight\nor configuration\ncan introduce\npoor handling\nqualities\nin another phase\nof flight.\nThis can occur in the phase of flight\nin which most of the\nflying\nis done.\nSuch is the case with current\nagricultural\nairplanes.\nThe manufacturer\nhas taken steps to improve this condition,\nbut it is reported that the operators\nhave gone a step further.\nThey have altered\nthe aircraft\nand improved the handling\nqualities\nin the most used phase\nIt is quesof flight\nand the threshold\nof pilot\nfatigue\nhas improved.\ntionable\nnow, however, whether the airplane\nmeets specific\nFAA flight\nrequirements.\nBut is the operation\nnow safer for the agricultural\npilot\nwhen the pilot\nfatigue\nis considered\nas part of the equation?\nAnother\nquestion\nis asked:\nshould handling\nquality\nrequirements\nbe developed\nspecifically\nfor and tailored\nto agricultural\noperations?\nHigher operating\nweight approval\nhas been continuously\nsought by the\nagricultural\noperator\nsince the agricultural\noperations\nfirst\nbegan.\nThe maximum gross weight for the aircraft\ntype specified\nunder type\ndesign data. sheet has been determined\non the basis of FAA requirements\nfor performance,\nstructure,\nand flight\ncharacteristics.\nHigher operating\nweights were granted on the basis of flight\ndemonstration\nto the FAA\nfield\ninspectors.\nThese higher operating\nweights over the type design data sheet maximums\nhave not been recognized\nby some of the airworthiness\nauthorities\nin\nforeign\ncountries;\nthis condition\npresents difficulty\nin the export of\nthese aircraft.\nRecently,\nthe FAA has issued a policy\nwhereby the manufacturer\ncan demonstrate\nthis higher operating\nweight in the restricted\ncategory\nand incorporate\nthe specifics\nas a note on the aircraft\ntype\ndesign data sheet.\nThe note would appear on the aircraft\ntype design\ndata sheet when the demonstration\nhas been made by the aircraft\nmanufacturer.\n"These aircraft\nhave demonstrated\nsatisfactory\noperations\nin\nthe restricted\ncategory\nunder the following\nconditions..."\nand the applicant\nwould list\nthe weight,\nstandard altitude\nat which it was demonstrated\non\na standard day, the center-of-gravity\nrange, the maximum speed in that\nconfiguration\n, and some have identified\nthe increase\nin stall\nspeed.\nRecommendations\n\nfor\n\nResearch\n\nand Development\n\nIn summary, let us consider\nthe following\nfor research and development:\n(1)\n\nDevelop\n\nAgricultural\n\nOperation-Compatible\n\nobservations\nStall\n\nand recommendations\nWarning\n\nTechniques\n\nIf aircraft\ndesigns and systems meeting FAA

Also the drift\nof toxic\ncompounds\nThere is\nis a potential\nthreat\nto the general pollution\nof the biosphere.\nevidence that there can be a problem of pesticides\npassing through the food\nchain from one species to another and causing injury\nto a distant\nspecies.\nII.\n\nPrecise\n\nControl\n\nRequired\n\nPrecise control\nis necessary to keep environmental\npollution\nof pesticides\nbelow acceptable\ntolerance\nlevels.\nFor example, if only 0.1% of a chemical\napplication\nof 2 lb/ acre to a given treated\narea would drift\nand fall\non an\nadjacent\nalfalfa\nfield\nof equal size, the residue on the alfalfa\ncrop would\nbe about 0.5 ppm. Another similar\ncalculation\nshows that only one tablespoon of active\ningredient\nis enough to produce a contamination\nof 0.5 ppm\non 20 acres of alfalfa..\nIII.\n\nWhat is the\n\nsolution?\n\nThe problem will\nThere is no single\nsolution.\neffort\nof research,\ndevelopment,\nand education.\nnecessary to minimize the multitude\nof factors\nIV.\n\nBasic\n\ncauses\n\nof drift.\n\nState\n\nof the art\n\nrequire\na multidisciplinary\nA systems approach is\naffecting\ndrift.\nand research\n\nneeds.\n\nThere are several\nimportant\nforces affecting\nthe trajectories\nof spray\nparticles.\nSome of the major factors\naffecting\nthese forces are aircraft\ndesign and flight\ntechniques,\natomization\nsystem and rate of\nevaporation,\nand microweather.\nAircraft\n\ndesign\n\nand flight\n\ntechniques\n\nThe aircraft\ndesign,\nrelative\nlocation\nof atomizers,\nflight\noperating\nvariabl,es,\nand guidance all affect\nthe destiny\nof the particles.\nThere\nhave been numerous theoretical\nand experimental\nstudies\nconducted on the\nflow field\ncharacteristics\nof various\ntypes of aircraft.\nAlso, there\n61\n\nhave been some theoretical\nand experimental\nstudies\non movement of spray\nparticles\nreleased\nfrom agricultural\naircraft.\n(See studies\nby Wilmer Reed,\nM. Smith, P. Taylor,\nV. Young, and W. Yates).\nHowever, there has been\nvery little\ncoordination\nin designing\nagricultural\naircraft\nflow field\ncharacteristics\nto match different\napplication\nrequirements.\nThus, research\nshould be coordinated\nto provide aircraft\nwake parameters\nto match dispersal\nrequirements.\nFor example, by use of various\nflap configurations\nand opit may be possible\nto confine\nthe sprays to a very\nerating\nparameters,\nlimited\narea.\nAtomization\n\nsystem\n\nand rate\n\nof evaporation\n\nThe particle\nsize affects\nthe terminal\nvelocity\nand rate of evaporation\nwhich consequently\nhas a predominant\neffect\non the particle\ntrajectory.\nA major contributing\nfactor\nto the spray drift\nproblem is the inevitable\nproduction\nof a small percentage\nof fine particles\n(<IO0 urn) by conventional\natomizers.\nMost present conventional\natomization\nsystems can be\ngrouped into two types:\n(1) hydraulic\nnozzels with flat\nfan, hollow cone,\nand (2) rotary\natomizers\nwith disks,\ncylinders,\nsolid cone or jet patterns,\nMost all nozzles produce breakup by means of mechanical\nor brush elements.\nThe atomization\nand\nor air shear or an unstable\nliquid\nfilm or ligament.\nPresently\nthere are\nevaporation\nis\'also\naffected\nby the fluid\nproperties.\nsome adjuvants\nand solvents\nthat can be selected\nto alter\nthe drop size\nand evaporation\nby changing the surface tension,\nvapor pressure,\napparent\nHowever, most all drop size\nviscosity,\nand viscoelastic\nproperties.\nspectrums are skewed normal distributions\nwith a high peak of the finer\nThus, there is a real need to develop systems that can eliparticles.\nminate the production\nof fine particles.\nOne of the most promising\ndevelopments\nisthe use of low speed microjets.\nThe AMCHEM"Microfoil"\nsystem utilizes\na series of micro-tubes\nand is one\nof the lowest drift\nsystems available\ntoday.\nHowever, this unit is limited\nto use with helicopters\nat speeds less than 60 mph. Also, clogging\nof the\n0.013 inch tubes is a real operational\nproblem, and since the drop size is\nvery large (900 urn), the applications\nare effective\nfor only a few types\nof treatments.\nSeveral research groups are currently\nconducting\nresearch\non the development of pulsed-microjet\nnozzles for the production\nof uniform\nsize drops.\nThese units look very promising\nbut will\nprobably\nrequire\nthe\ndevelopment of special\nfiltering\nsystems to prevent clogging\nof the microjets.\nResearch\n\nis needed in several\n\nareas:\n\n(1)\n\nResearch needs to be accelerated\nin the development\nof new aerodynamic\ndesigned nozzles and the use of different\nfluid\nadjuvants\nin an effort\nto produce controlled\nuniform drops of selected\nsize from 20 urn to\n400 urn.\n\n(2)\n\nIt is important\nto coordinate\nresearch and development\nto design and\ndevelop complete systems to produce and introduce\nselected\nuniform\nsize drops into optimum locations\non the aircraft.\n\n62\n\n(3)\n\nResearch will\nbe required\nto accurately\nmeasure target\ndrift\nfrom improved atomization\nsystems.\n\nrecovery\n\nand\n\nMicroweather\nThe microweather\nconditions\nduring application\nare the basic transport\nand\ndiffusion\nforces that may move some spray particles\nout of the target\narea.\nA knowledge of the wind direction\nis very important\nsince it determines\nthe area where the spray drift\nmay occur.\nAt the present time aircraft\noperators\nfrequently\nutilize\na smoke column at the application\nsite to\nWith increased\nconcern\nindicate\nthe direction\nof spray drift\nmovement.\nover smoke pollution,\nit is necessary to have other low cost techniques\nto provide direct\ninformation\nto the pilot\non wind direction\nat the target\narea.\nAtmospheric\nturbulence\nis also an important\nparameter that affects\nA smoke column does provide qualitative\nspray drift\ncharacteristics.\ninformation\non possible\ntemperature\ninversion\nlayers and atmospheric\nturbulence.\nA number of research\ninstruments\nare available\nthat can quantitatively\nSome of the different\ntypes include\nmeasure atmospheric\nturbulence.\nof stability\nfrom the\na sigma meter for use with a bivane, calculation\ntemperature\nprofile,\nwind-velocity\nmeasurements,\nand use of three compoHowever, most\nnents and heated film sensors for turbulence\ncalculations.\nThus, it\nunits are expensive and require\nconsiderable\ninstallation\ntime.\nwould be desirable\nto develop a low-cost\nportable\nunit that could provide\nimmediate quantitative\ndata on the turbulence\nduring the application.\nThe complete system should record measurements of wind direction,\nturbulence,\nThus, records of weather\nwind velocity,\nand relative\nhumidity.\ntemperature,\ncould be filed\nwith other data from each spray application.\nA limited\namount of research information\nis available\nthat shows the effect\nAdditional\nof atmospheric\nturbulence\non spray drift\ncharacteristics.\ntheoretical\nand field\n,research is required\nto develop accurate\nmodels to\npredict\ndrift\nfrom a multitude\nof input variables.\nThe ultimate\ngoal\nwould be the development of a computer program for use with a small microcomputer that could be used by laymen in the field\nto predict\ndrift\nlevels\nfrom real-time\ninputs.\nIn this manner, "go" or "no go" decisions\ncould\nbe made during a given operation.\n\n63\n\nAIRCRAFT SYSTEMS FOR DISPERSING PESTICIDES,\nPLANT NUTRIENTS, SEEDS, AND BAITS\nNORMANB. AKESSON\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nThe research on and development of dispersal\nequipment to be used on fixed\nand rotary wing aircraft\nhas largely\nparalleled\nthat of the development of\naircraft\nairframes\nand power plants which have made possible\nthe load car?\nrying capacity\nand rugged durability\nrequired\nfor this type of work.\nThe\nburden of dispersal\nequipment development has fallen\nto (1) the aircraft\noperators,\n(2) a small group of specific\nmanufacturers\nand suppliers,\nand\n(3) Federal and State agricultural\nresearch groups.\nThe latter\nhave pro,\nvided the basic funding and continuing\nmanpower and the interface\nwith biological\naspects of these systems which has been a fundamental\naspect of\naircraft\nuse in the bio-aeronautics\narea.\nThus, aircraft\nused in conjunction\nwith biological\nsystems has of necessity\nmaintained\na largely\nbiologically\noriented\nresearch position\nsince,the\nbasic objectives\nof aircraft\nuse here are to aid in the production\nof food\nand fiber\nas well as protection\nagainst\nattacks\non man and animals by various vectors\ncarrying\ndiseases.\nThe aircraft\nused for these programs were\nthose made\' available\nfrom military\nor civilian\ndesigns,\nand until\nthe early\n196Os, no widespread\nimpact on the bio-aeronautics\nmarket was to be found\nfrom any specific\naircraft\ndesigned for this purpose.\nThe World War II\nStearman biplane and Boeing Kaydet (and a few Navy built\nN3Ns) with Pratt\nand Whitney R-985, 450-hp radial\nengines are still\nthe most numerous among\nagricultural\naircraft.in\nthe United States.\nHowever, as the industry\nhas\nstabilized\nand established\nits position\nas a responsible\nand enduring partner in food and fiber\nproduction,\na number of new and specially\ndesigned\nCommencing with Fred Weick\'s design series\n(later\naircraft\nhave appeared.\nto become part of the Piper line),\nCessna, North American Rockwell,\nand\nGrumman have all added new agricultural\ntypes to their\nline,\nand these airplanes have found wide acceptance\nin the industry.\nDuring this transition\nperiod,\nthe support for dispersal\nsystem design and\ncorrelation\nto these new aircraft\nrested with the agricultural\nresearch\npersonnel with increasing\nsupport coming from the suppliers\nof chemical\nplant nutrients\nand other pesticide\nformulations.\nBut very little\ninterface or support was to be found with aircraft\nmanufacturers,\nwhose position\nstill\nremained as a supplier\nof hardware rather than an active\nparticipant\nin bio-aeronautic\nresearch and development.\nCommunication between the largely\nphysical\naircraft,\ndispersal\nequipment\nand application,\nand the biological\nrequirements\nrelating\nto formulation,\nUp until\nabout 1970, the\ncrop plants , and pests has been uneasy at best.\nbasic communication\nwas at the local or state level,\nbetween agricultural\ninterests-farmers,\nagribusiness\n, and university\nagricultural\nexperiment\na new and highly\nstations-and\nthe aircraft\noperators.\nIn recent years,\n\n65\n\nvisible\nelement in the

which\nneither\nthe physical\nnor the biologically\noriented\ngroups can afford\nto\npursue if the bio-aeronautics\nmarriage\nis to develop and mature into a\nlasting\npartnership\nfor the good of food and fiber\nproduction\nand, hence,\nmankind the world over.\nThe introduction\nof the National\nAeronautics\nand Space Administration\n(NASA) as a factor\nin further\nbio-aeronautic\nresearch will\nundoubtedly\nhave\nfar reaching\neffects\non as well as responses from the agricultural,\nforestry, and vector control\nresearch and commercial\ninterests.\nThe injection\nof\nknowledge and organizational\nknow-how that NASA personnel\nhave accumulated\nand so ably demonstrated\nin general aviation\nas well as space research can\nonly be beneficial\nto agricultural\naviation.\nThe organizational\nrecognition of an essential\npartnership\nbetween NASA and the United States Department of Aqriculture\n(USDA) and Agricultural\nExperiment\nStation\npeople and\ntheir\nfacilities\nappears to be understood\nbut cannot be taken for granted.\nTraditional\nsources for biological\nresearch support must not be dried up in\nthe enthusiasm\ngenerated for association\nand support from NASA funding.\nIt\nwould be extremely\ndesirable\nthat an organizational\nguidance committee representing\nboth the physical\nand biological\naspects of research and development be formed at an early date to not only guide the future\ndevelopment\nand support of the proposed work but also to insure all the presently\nconcerned actively\nparticipating\ngroups that their\nvoices and needs will\nbe\nheard.\nAs agricultural\nengineers\nworking in federal\nand state supported biological\nresearch organizations,\nwe.have long had to carry the weight of machines\nand application\ntechnology\nto the biologists\nand try to make compatible\nthe\nlimitations\nas well as the opportunities\nthat exist\nbetween these two basic\ndisciplinary\nand professional\nareas.\nWe have frequently\nhad to act in a\ncoordinating\nrole to try and make compatible\nthe differing\nrequirements\nand\nneeds, services,\nand capabilities\nof the aircraft\npeople in relation\nto the\nbiological\ndemands.\nThat these are frequently\nincompatible\nshould be obvious to anyone remotely\nassociated\nor knowledgeable\nof the many regulations,\nfederal,\nstate,\nand county,\nthat have appeared in recent years as a result\nof the essentially\nlimiting\nrequirements\nand capabilities\nof pesticide\nuse.\nAircraft\nuse in food and fiber\nproduction\nhas been challenged\non many\nfronts\nby ecology-minded\ninterests,\nbut more importantly\nby the farmer\nusers as well.\nAlthough the days of cheap and consequently\nwidespread\noveruse of pesticide\nchemicals\nis hopefully\npast, there is no evidence to\nsuggest that pesticides\nand nutrients\nas an essential\nadjunct\nto crop production will\nbe any less used in the future.\nOn the contrary,\nthe\n\n66\n\nstatistical\nevidence for the past several years shows a good healthy\n9 percent per year growth in pesticide\nchemical use, which interestingly\nenough\nis paralleled\nby a similar\ngrowth in use of aircraft\nfor their\napplication.\nHowever, a notable difference\nis occurring\nwhich has both good and bad imThe materials\nbeing used are becoming\nplications\nfor

State Agricultural\nExperiment\nStation\nhave a highly\nsignificant position\nin relation\nto the development and ultimate\nacceptance of\naircraft\nand type of dispersal\nequipment in food and fiber\nproduction.\nSimilarly,\nthe chemical manufacturers\nand formulators,\nhaving to not only\nprove the production\nvalue of their\nproduct through field\nevaluations,\nmust\nalso show that the

specific\ninformation\non where these products eventually\nare\nfound to come to rest in the environment,\nor if,\nin fact,\nthey do degrade\nand convert to harmless products.\nThus, the

a form of ram-air\npowered spreader remains much the same today as\nVarious means have been attempted\nto\nit was when developed 30 years ago.\nWith fixed-wing\nobtain wider, more uniform applications\nof dry materials.\naircraft,\nthe ram-air device still\ndominates the scene, with wider (and\nhigher drag) units coming and going in popularity.\nPowered units utilizing\na blower to

advantages gained\nwere not sufficient\nto justify\nthe extra expense.\nIf swaths greater\nthan lOO-foot width,\nfor example, are to be applied with material\nrates\nof 200 to 300 pounds/acre,\nthe flow rates (66 pounds/second\nat 200 pounds/\nA, 100 mph and 100 foot swath) and total\nloads of the aircraft\nbecome\nunrealistic.\nThus for heavy rates of application\naircraft\ncapable of large\nloads of 2 to 5 tons, for example, may be found more useful,\nand the more\nimportant\ndirection\nin which to develop capabilities\nwould be in short\nlanding and take-off\nequipment,\nsuch as

use of dusts (ground to a 90 to 99 percent by weight under 25 urn particle size) has largely\nbeen supplanted\nby either\ngranular\nmaterials\nor\nliquid\nsprays.\nDusts are not only susceptible\nto airborne\ntransport\nlosses,\nbut are significantly\nless deposit\neffective.\nIt was customary\nto prescribe\n20 to 30 percent greater\ntoxicant\nin the dust application\nthan if applied\nin liquid\nform.\nGranular materials\nof from 30 to 60 USA\nmesh size (520-246 micrometers,\nurn) to larger\n8 to 16 mesh (2360-1000 urn)\nare used wherever this type formulation\nis compatible\nwith the biological requirements.\nObviously,\nlarge particle\nsize granules will\nnot adhere to plants and, thus, tend to pass through foliage,\nfor example,\ninto water, for such things as mosquito and water insect\ncontrol,\nor to\nthe ground for weed and insect type control.\nSeveral newer type rotary\nspreaders have been designed for applying\ngranular\nmaterials\n(particularly\nhelicopters)\nand have been shown to be superior\nto the ram-air\ntypes\ninsofar\nas swath uniformity\nis concerned.\nThe swath width is still\nbasically\na function\nof the width of the distribution\nsystem and the\n\n68\n\ninertial\nfunctions\nof the material\nbeing spread.\nThus, a centrally\nlocated spreader must displace\nmaterial\noutward 15 to 25 feet on each\nside of the aircraft.\nParticles\nbelow 500 urn size, and,of low density\nmaterials,\nwill\nnot be.capable\nof lateral\ndisplacement\nagainst\nthe\nforces of air resistance.\nThe aircraft\nshed vortex strength\nis insufficient\nto transport\nthese beyond the king or rotor tip of the aircraft.\nHence, although dusts are thus spread to 60 or 100 foot swaths, the granular materials\nare largely\nlimited\nto approximately\nthe wing or rotor\nspan.\nIn terms of airborne\nlosses,\nthe granular\nmaterials\nhave probably\nthe\nbest record for reduction\nof loss of any formulations.\nHowever, granulars are very limited\nin biological\neffectiveness;\nhence, their\nuse is\nlimited.\nLiquid formulations\noffer\na great variety\nof physical\nproperties\nas well\nas a range of atomization\nsize from small

If\nthe answer is yes, then no matter how good the equipment may appear to be\nit is useless in that function\nas it will\ndo nothing\nbut increase\nthe cost\nof the operation\nat a time when we are trying\nto decrease the costs of\nthe operation.\nThere seems to be much more uniformity\nof design in the equipment in\nhandling\ndry nontoxic\nmaterials\nsuch as seed and fertilizers.\nThis\nmay be because the application\nrequirements\nand weather factors\ndo not\naffect\nthese applications\nto the same extent that they do pesticide\napplications.\nGenerally,\ntwo pieces of equipment are needed; some sort of a\n\n73\n\nconveyor belt or its equivalent\nand the dump bucket\nwhich puts the load over the hopper of the airplane.\n\non the loader\n\ntruck\n\nThe liquid\nmixing and\'loading\nequipment present another story.\nYou can\nand you will\nsee 20 different\nvisit\n20 different\nagricultural\noperations,\nThey all accomplish\nthe same thing-getting\nthe\ndesigns and techniques.\nmixed material\ninto the hopper of the aircraft\nquickly\nand safely.\nOne\nof the major reasons for this nonstandardization\nof equipment is the fact\nthat the crops and crop pests vary from area to area, and the methods of\nAn example of this would be spraying\ncotton\ncombating these pests vary.\nboll worms in South Texas with a recommended chemical.at\nan application\nrate of 2 to 3 gallons\ntotal\nsolution\nper acre, and in the Sacramento\nValley of California\nthe same worm in a tomato field,\nthen called a\ntomato fruitworm,\nusing the same chemical at the same rate only in a\ntotal\nsolution\nof from 10 to 20 gallons\nper acre.\nAnother factor\nof increasing\nconcern is the tendency of the new chemicals\nbeing developed to be packaged in greater\nstrength\nor concentration.\nSome organophosphate\nmaterials\nare now being used at the rate of l/10\nOne 5 gallon container\nholds enough material\nto treat 400\npint per acre.\nBut a hypothetical\njob of 22 acres takes only 2.2 pints of this\nacres.\nmaterial.\nNow who has the equipment to safely\nand accurately\nmeasure those\n2.2 pints and then seal and store the remaining\nchemical until\nneeded again.\nThis problem is becoming a real problem in those states\nthat have enacted\nclosed mixing and loading\nsystems regulations.\nIt is becoming very apparent\nthat our industry\nneeds new ideas in handling\nthese toxic chemicals\nin\nsuch a way that we can get our mixers and loaders out of the "monkey suits"\nwe are now required\nto put them into every time they handle a class I or II\nJust how safe is that man on a 100\xe2\x80\x99 day wearing full\nsleeve\nchemical.\ncoveralls,\nrespirator,\ngauntlet\nrubber gloves,\nand rubber boots?\nThere\nare many claims that the discomfort\nof the safety equipment is more of an\ninducement to accidents\nthan a more climatically\ncomfortable\nuniform.\n\n74\n\nSESSION III\nEQUIPMENT DEMONSTRATIONAND DISPLAYS\n\nCHAIRMEN\nL.
