The chief danger was presented by globally distributed ejecta, which for very large impacts takes the form of transient thick rock vapor atmospheres; both planets suffered such impacts repeatedly. The exposed surface on both planets was sterilized when it was quickly heated to the temperature of condensed rock vapor by radiation and rock rain. Shallow water bodies were quickly evaporated and sterilized. Any surviving life must have been either in deep water or well below the surface.", "title": "Planetary Perspective on Life on Early Mars and the Early Earth", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T15:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970025398, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sleep, Norman H."}, "organization": {"name": "Stanford Univ.", "location": "Stanford, CA United States"}}, "id": "f1ec012b9e024adb9941fed0aba62588"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19970025398, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zahnle, Kevin"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "23c6e24d8f1346c9851918ee5d4baf9c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970025398, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970025398, "id": "144fb092f08c44bb87c6ae8c7219929c", "publicationName": "Astrobiology Workshop: Leadership in Astrobiology", "publicationDate": "1996-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970025374, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Astrobiology Workshop: Leadership in Astrobiology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
