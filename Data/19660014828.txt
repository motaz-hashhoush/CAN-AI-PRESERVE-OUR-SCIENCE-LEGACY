This is illustrated in Figure 6. Furthermore, there is\nalways one value of this sharing fraction which will pgovide the maximumexpected utility. (This is illustrated by\nthe dotted line, Figure 6). in other words, for every target cost greater than the expected cost, the sharing fraction\ncan ta;_ a large numberof values which wi|l make the gamble on the profit outcome of the incentive contract a\npreferable choice to the CPFF contract.\nThe model of contractor behavior was developed incorporating only one o, the several negotiated contract\nterms - the sharing fraction. It can readily be seen that the negotiation of the fee swings and the target fee, as\nwelJ as the xarget cost, will present additional opportunities for increasing the contractor\'s expected ,:ility; i.e.,\nthese additional contract arrangements all present opportunities for effectively accomplishing the sam.\', end as\nwould be achieved by increasing the target cost itself.\n\nThe succe_\n\nof the incentive contract formfor _,chieving\n\ngreater post facto utility (increased fee) will obviously depend upon the contractor\'s competence in cost estimation\nand negotiation. But given a schedule of probable cost outcomes (subjective cost density), the contractor has\nseveral paths by which to negotiate a fee arrangement more favorable than that offered by a CPFF contract - or a\ngreater expected utility. We have aLtemptedto illustrate the sensitivity of the expected utility to the various cost\nand contract parameters in Figures 7 and 8. The utility function assumed for this illustration is presented on\npage 18.\nWebelieve that this model of contractor behavior is both normative\', nd descriptive; it is not only _ model for\na\noptimumcontractor behavior, it describes present contractor behavior and the basis for the contractor\'s present\nsatisfaction with this contract form. We believe it is s formal description of the contractor\'s approach to contract\nnegotiations; it describes how the contractor can improve his situation with an incentive contract - not through\ncost efficiency efforts but through negotiations.\nIn a sense, the section discussing risk in incentive contracts Ceegiuning page 19) is somewhat redundant after\nthe discussion of contractor behavior in maximizing expected utility in incentive contracts; a contractor who operatee to maximise his expected utility has properly considered risk. However, there may be some who feel that\nutility moss urea of co-,tractor behavior remain somewhat esoteric for the pragmatic issues of government procuremeritand who prefer to consider risk an either the chance of an outright loss or as a measure of the expected\namount of that loss, If s loss occum. Using these latter two definitions of risk together with measures of uncertsinty interpreted fromthe contracting manuals, we have attempted to demonstrate through simple algebra that it\nwould be quite easy to _gotiate\n\na CPlF contract with more risk than a FFP contract, even with f_,irly small shar-\n\ning fractions. (This development has certain elements of obviosity except for the fact that there is a very strong\ninclination to forget the measure of cost uncertainty when considering risk in tee arrangements and measuring risk\nstrictly in terms of the sharing fraction). If the target costs are customarily negotiated close to the expected cost\noutcome, it is unlikely, on this basis ai,,ne, that incentive contracts will be negotiated with greater sharing fractions than are presently experienced.\n\nThe ft_hal section\n\nof the paper (beginning\n\non page 23) examines\n\nmarginal gain or increment that a given cost-plus\nheleaftet\no,\n\ncalled\n\nthe marginal fee expression\n\ned by a cost-plus\n\ncontract\n\nwhich was incurred\nassociated\nsituations\n\nwith the fee proper.\n\nThe manner of determining\n\ning on the other sales\nallocating\n\nsituations\n\nparties.\n\nmize the marginal\n\nfor overhead is determined\n\nby multiUnless\n\nis of the same proportion as that existwith the direct costs,\n\nthis method of\n\ncost\n\nnow being negotiated,\n\nthe ,contractor will usually\n\nfind it to\n\nrather than underr ins.\n\nfee function is the logic.a1 o,,e to _e\n\nevidence\n\ndoes not supfx rt an ascertion\n\nfor decLsion making _,_d evaluation\ndeveloped\n\nb\'_\n_\n\nsituations\n\nthat contractors\n\npurposes\n\nby\n\nassump_.ions, it\n\nalbeit a\xc2\xa2_,:.imate\n\nanswers\n\ncontrol _h_:; r -st outcomes\n\nwill\nto maxi-\n\n"-s that they are generally aware t_,a_ a ." :\'_siderable portion of\n\nin which the ,_.,giaal\nfee expression.\n\nunder spe_f_.,\n\nsit,rations,\n\nfrom the overhead cost re;,:,_\':ar_,emcnt.

[11, p\xe2\x80\xa2 7]\nOne can find many similar statements in the speeches of various responsible government officials\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe contract form, however, is by no means the sole explanation for cost overruns, lagging schedules, etc.\nSuch contracting\'innovations\n\nas the Program Definition\n\nPhase of DOD, etc. implicitly\n\nrecognize this fact.\n\nIn\n\nplaces the contracting manuals recognize this fact also:\nBut in another sense, recourse to this contract torm is itselt regarded as a symptom\nof a deeper problem.

The end objective, then, of a revitalized approach to research and\ndevelopment procurement is not just the elimination of a contract type, hut the\ncorrection of these fundamental deficiencies.\nIt is obvious that the same balance between cost, time and performance that characterizes DOD\'s program decisions must also be a motivating tactor in the behavior\nof Oovernment contractor._.

A bette_ one is given by Dr. Fred Moore [19, p. 42 and 48] who, it must he added, does not draw these\nconclusions (p.49).\nBy his data it is calculated that CPFF contracts have overruns about 55% of the time while\nCPIF contracts have cost underruas about 75% of the time. Case history data examined by Harvard Weapons\nAcquisition Research Project found a s_ilar frequency of undermns. [22, p. 224] also [23]. Data submitted to\nthe McClellan Committee hearings also substantiate these findings.\n[26, p. 674 and 818]. The Air Force presentatiun (p. 818) indicates that even when the total dollar value of incentive contracts (totaling more than $4 billion)\nis evaluated thelre is an underrua of 3.4%. Th,_:r comparison of total cost experience on CPFF contracts with\nthat of incentiv_ cuntrscta finds that the former run i0.6% greater than the latter. This apparently matches the\nestimate used by DOD in calculating "savings" attribut, ble to switching from CPFF to incentive contracts.\nAs of Dec. 31, 1964, only six incentive contracts had been completed for NASA for a total of $2.8 million.\n(This does n_t include award fee contracts.)\nThis experience represents about a 4% overrun, but it is insufficient for determining separate NASA experience on CPIF contracts.\nThe Contractor Performance Evaluation Program appears to be the only potential source of accurate information as to the causal factors for the cost experience.\nThis program, practically speaking, is just underway; it is\na primary endeavor to measure contractor performance. Such an evaluation demands some insight as to the factors\nmlderlying contract performanc\'_, and cost outcome. Despite the difficulties and ambiguities of such evaluations,\nan examination of the data generated by this program may establish the responsibility of the contract form to the\ncost outcome.\n4 See p. 12.\n5Moore [19] shows data on 130 CPIF contracts\n\nwhich indicate that 59% of them had sharing arrangements\n\nof 20% or\n\nless, while 96% had 25% sharing or less. Personal investigation of this experience with DOD contracting personnel indicates this experience i._ still fairly general. "In fixed price incentives we seem to be wedded to an\n$0/20 or 75/25 sharing." See speech by T.D. Morris (ASDIL) [21, p. 551.

[21, p. 54]\nA contractor\'s efficiency\n\nis not a matter of uncertainty or a phenomenon associated with risk; its level is at the\n\noption of the co_tractor.\n\nRisks, on the o\'_herhand, are associated with the cost uncertainties which any contrac-\n\ntoe, efficient or otherwise, cannot accurately predict.\n\nThe fee outcome, however, is a product of both the con_rac-\n\ntoe\'s actions and\'the cost umcertainties; the latter, under R&D and advanced systems procurement, probably\nexceeds the range of cost outcomes subject to the control of the contractor by a considerable multiple.\n\nIn view of\n\nthe extreme cost uncertainties associated with incentive contracts it is patently obvious that the contractor will\nnot likely welcome large participations\n\nin cost outcomes over which he has little control - assuming that the tap\n\nget cost is tightly negotiated.\n\nThe Oenersl Problem of l_stsblishing\n\nTsrget Costs\n\nThe cost outcome of a contract, therefore,\n\nis a function of both deterministic\n\nand random variables.\n\ntractor has a limited amount of control over the cost outcome through his own actions,\nvagaries associated\nsre recognized\n\nwhile at the same time the\n\nwith any cont.racting operation will affect cost outcome in an unknown manner.\n\nin the contracting\n\nmanuals.\n\n[ln[ortunately, no amount of preplanning or conscientious\nnegotiation can determine exactly ,\'hat tile cost outcome of a project will be . . . The target cost is,\nin fact, _n estimate, a prediction of future events. As such it will inevitably\ncontain some degree el uncertainty either large or small - some probability that\nz_t contract completion costs will be, for example, 10, 15, or 20 percent above or\nbelow target. Each procurement, then, is concerned not wilh _ single cost, but\nS\n\nThe con-\n\nBoth elements\n\nwith ,, band of possible cost outcomes.\nThe narrower this band, the more risk of\npertormance being shifted to the contractor by means ol firm tixed price or incentive contracts.\n(The negotiator) must formulate ,in estimate ol the amount by\nlrhich [inal costs might devb_te fro_ target.

Thereatter, the CPIF arrangement is appropriate, at least theoretically,\nregardless ot the deterioration of the confidence level.\n[20, p. 2011\nOn the other hand, the philosophy\n\nof incentive\n\ncontracting\n\nsupposes\n\nthat the contractor\n\nis in control\n\nof the\n\ncost outcomes.\nProfit and tee is thus tuned to the contractor\'s\ncontrol ot a variable\nskills can have a notice,hie\neltect.\n[20, p. 103]\n\non which his matmgement\n\nAt r/hat level should an incentive target cost be set?..,\nthe target cost should\nrepresent the best mutually determined estimate of what costs will actually be.\nwhen the work is complete.\nThe target cost should be set that the contractor, it\nhe perto,"m_ with more than usual etficiency, has a real chance to do the work tot\nless than tattler . . . these are the same criteria as used tor the CPFF or FFP\ncontracts.\nIn other wtmts, ditterences\n.in risk inherent in various contract types\nshould be retlecte(" not in the cost estimation process but in the establishment\nof profit (or fee) rates. [20, p. 202]\nFor obvious reasops contractor capabilities for predictinE cost outcomes are difficult\n\nto evaluate objectively.\n\nSomegeneral perspective of this matter is important to the evaluation of the contractor\'s decision process since\nthe average errors ic cost estimates could dominate any margin of control that the contractor may have over costs.\nSince this capability\n\nfor prediction would vary so greatly by contractor and contract the matter can only be exam-\n\nined in generalities.\nMarshall and Meckling [18] have presented data for a number of missile and aircraft models comparing the increases in the cumulative costs of production with the cost estimates.\n\nTheir investigation involved the preparation\n\nof adjusted ratios of the cumulative average cost of production of the mentioned items for comparison to the earliest\nof such cost estimates as were available.\n\nAs might he anticipated, the data leave much to be desired as to accur-\n\nacy and lack of ambiguity, [18, footnote 9, p. 468] and two sets of ratios were determined for each program because\nof the equivocality of the price level adjustments.\n\nUsing one set of facto=s (ratios subject to a given set of adjust-\n\nments), two of four cargo anti tanker aircraft programs experienced cost outcomes equal to the estimated costs,\nwhile the other two had 40% and 50% overruns. Using the second set of adjustments for the same programs, the\nresults were measured as an 80% and 90% underrun and a 50_ and 60% overrun. The other groups (fighters,\nbombers, missiles) indicatet_, much greater variations.\n\nIt was the authors\' conclusion that =The factors (the\n\nadjusted ratios) for (4 different) cargo and tanker aircraft (programs) probably represent an upper bound on the\ncurrently attainable level of accuracy in cost estimating. _ [18, p. 471] (The conclusion would obviously pertain\nto this type of procurement)\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n6\n\nAlchian [3] recently\n\nreported a study of the prognostic\n\ndata recently declassified;\n\nhe w_s interested\n\nknbwledge of past experience\n\nreliability\n\nof progress\n\n(or l_arning) curves bvsed upon\n\nin the accuracy to which direct labor costs could be predicted from\n\nwith the production of similar aircraft types.\n\nveloped from certain post war inquirie_ of RAND personnel\n\nProgress\n\nwho found a "log-log"\n\nor learning curves were de-\n\nrelationship\n\nbetween the direct\n\nlabor per pound of airframe and the nth airframe.

For the entire\noutput of any particular airframe model produced in one facility the error of prediction is also 25 percent. [3, p. 679]\nIf specific carves are fitted to the past performance of a particul_r manufacturing\nfacility in o\xc2\xa2_r to predict its [mare requirements,\nthe margins of error or prediction average about 20 percent.

This defines a situation similar to that described in the previously\ncited references (see footnote 21, and [20]). Also, to provide a better perspective, a second function will incorporate the antithesis cf assumption (3) and _ssume that the overhead increases proportionally to changes in the variable cost - the implicit assumption of incentive contracting. The true situation will be somewhere between these\ntwo extremes, but in most instances, probably much closer to the first.\nThe =fee" equation (incorporating assumption (3)) is now written to represent the net gain to be made on the\ncontract.

Lower values of the ra\' ;o c2/c 1 serve to reduce the overall levzl of this function, F*(x); but in the\ncaSes illustrated, the net gain on the contract will be comparatively lsrge in terms of the fee arrangement, i.e., the\nfee is comparatively unimportant. The fee swings convert the fee function from a CPIF contract to a CPFF contract\nfor values of the cos_ outcome exceeding those corresponding to the upper and lower fee swings. So long as an increase in the direct cost on the contract is not accompanied by a _roportional increase in the overhead cost, and\nunless all sales are cost-plus there is always a net gain from increasing the qosts on a CPFF contract. It is apparent that the existence of a fee swing would give the contractor faced with an overrun condition an option of\nincreasing his fee either by increasing the overrunor by cutting costs.\nFigures 10 and 11 also demosstrate that selection k -\'-k_ would produce a comparatively "flat n fee fur.,:tion\nand a probable i_llfference (on the contmctol"s part) as to the cost outcomes between the fee swings. This is\nmore noticeable when the cost-plus contracts form a smaller percentage of the fire\'s tgtal saleG. (See Figures 14\nand 15). The sharing arrangements must be quite high compared with those negotiated today for the fee function to\nhave an important increase associated with a decrease in cost between the defined limits of the fec swing. (See\nFigure 12). Once the fee swings are exceeded in either direction, hcwevar, the fee is more sensitive to the cost\noutcome, except for extreme values of k. On the premise that a given overrun is easier to attain than an underrun,\nit is msoashle\n\nto anticipate that if tb_-contractor elects to increase his fee by control of the cost outcome (v/hich\n\nhe is in a pus_tion to do later in the contract) he will most likely do so by overruns.\nChanging the btmien from a ratio of 2:1 to 1:1 changes the overall level of the fee, but it does not materially\naffect the shape of the curves and the previous observations.\n\nOn the other hand reducing the burden ratio decreases\n\nthe values of ko for any given value of cost outcome x. This is especially noticeable when the initial burden is\nlarge compared to that for the CPIF contract. Also increasing c2 will serve to increase the overall level d the fee\nfunction\xc2\xb0 ceteris paribus.\n\nContractor Deoinion l/sk/nE with lee(z)\nA contractor aware of his marginal costs could IosicaUy co,_sider the fee funct/on F*(x) in place of the traditional function, F(x), fordecision making under uncertainty.\n\nFurdamentally the contractor should consider the\n\ntransformaUon of this fee function into his utility function in the manner discussed earlier. It does not seem partlcularly useful to assume an\'_tber utility function as a basis for additional examples; rather, it would seem surf/cient to examine the fee fur,c\' ._ under certain parameter assumptions recognizing the importance of the utility\ntransformation (or subjectively wei_i:t/ng the probable loss versus the probable gain).\nMaximization of the function E[F*(x, k)] = _ F*(x, k)h (x)dx would occur where dE[F* (x, k)]/dk = 0 23 Since\n\n23 The optimumchoice of k with the function E[F*(x, k)] will change at a value of xo >p, as in contrast with the\nfunction ElF(x)], where the optimum choice changes at xo = p.\n29\n\nk .s independent\n\ncf x, the function under the integral can be differentiated.\n\nk, so the function\n\nwill either maximize for k = 0 or k = 1.0.\n\nutility function of fees,\n\nwhich is again assumed\n\nF(x) will rotate to a value of U(x)=consta_t\nabout xo as k changes,\nconcave\n\nthe utility function\n\nfunction of x monotonically\n\nAs before, the contractor\n\nto be concave.\n\nas k approaches\n\nwill base his decisions\n\nSince the fee function\n\na contract on the basis\n\nas he is in a reasonable\n\nposition\n\n(when k -- 0) to a strictly\n\nconcave\n\nflat for values of k approximately\n\nof F*(x) might, therefore, be expected\nto negotiat_\n\ngotiated\n\nis maximized at that cost value.\nexceeds\n\nthe sharing fractirm since,\n\nto stabilize\n\nat the value ko there would be every incentive\n\nthe values\n\nThe previous\n\nmonotonic_,lly decreasing\n\nan increasing\n\nof less interest to the contractor to negotiate\n\nthe contractor should negotiate\nswings acceptable\n\nto xo so long\n\ncost.\n\nCertainly,\n\nnegotiated\n\nif the k were r,e-\n\nin our examples,\n\nko+ considerably\n\nby 7a where x 1 = 0 and x2 = 0_.
