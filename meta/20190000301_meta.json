SCaN's current Space Network provides radio frequency (RF) relay services to near Earth space missions via Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). SCaN plans to offer a new generation of relay services beginning in 2025, including the addition of optical communications capabilities and enhanced RF capabilities. The primary drivers behind the development of these next generation relay network services are to enhance communication and navigation services with significantly reduced development and operational costs. Several approaches being considered for implementation of these services are through government owned capabilities, through commercial service providers, or a combination of the two. One approach receiving a great deal of attention is the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to develop and provide capabilities or services. Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships allows NASA and commercial entities to share the investment, standards, and risks of developing and testing new or enhanced capabilities which can benefit both NASA and the commercial space communication industry. The capabilities developed under the PPP can then be used to support the growth of the commercial satellite communications industry while simultaneously being introduced into NASA operations to provide service to future NASA missions as part of the NASA Next Generation Architecture. Partnerships formed for this purpose can also serve as the basis for further NASA acquisition activities where government and industry can continue to share the cost, risk, and benefits of space communications capability development and operations. This objective is consistent with the 2010 National Space Policy stated principles: \"The United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. commercial space sector that supports U.S. needs, is globally competitive, and advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship.\" [1]NASA has conducted several internal studies as well as externally funded studies with industry to define the next generation space communication architecture. NASA has approached the commercial industry through a Request for Information (RFI) to define further the next generation architecture and has conducted numerous internal and external studies. The results are promising and are shaping the approach to utilize Public Private Partnership to achieve NASA's objectives while reducing costs. The commercial satellite industry has begun to deploy high performance, high throughput global satellite constellations which have the potential to provide communication services to NASA Missions. Commercial satellite manufacturers have advanced their processes to rapidly design, build, and deliver, reliable communication satellites using minimum government oversight. In this paper, we will 1) describe the NASA Next Generation Architecture, Concept of Operations (ConOps), and salient characteristics; 2) Discuss the rational of Public-Private Partnerships to achieve NASA\u2019s next generation communication architecture; and 3) Summarize the preliminary analysis performed to date and describe the path forward.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20190000301, "endDate": "2018-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Cologne, Germany"}}, "meetingId": "82687a86ca794a729f52b2386183e6db", "id": "556d503809ac4079aa1cb3a3891508ce"}], "name": "International Communications Satellite Systems Conference (ICSSC)", "location": "Niagara Falls", "id": "82687a86ca794a729f52b2386183e6db", "startDate": "2018-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20190000301, "endDate": "2018-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Cologne, Germany"}}, "meetingId": "0ecd6abffc584098acceaf99f135b83c", "id": "311eb436a2574641aea93efbffe51d35"}], "name": "Ka and Broadband Communications Conference", "location": "Niagara Falls", "id": "0ecd6abffc584098acceaf99f135b83c", "startDate": "2018-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000301, "id": "f075047626ec4c2091959d7998a36e4e", "publicationDate": "2018-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000301.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000301/downloads/20190000301.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000301/downloads/20190000301.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000301/downloads/20190000301.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
