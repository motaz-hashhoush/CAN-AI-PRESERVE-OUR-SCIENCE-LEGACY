During this phase many authors were contacted\nvia telephone and/or personal visits.\n\nTask 2 identified those technologies which offer potential for present or\nfuture NASA memory applications. This task was delayed somewhat because\napplication data were not received as scheduled. Near (1982-1987) and long\n(1987-1992) term technology rankings in terms of NASA applications were a\nfurther result of Task 2.\n\nTask 3 produced conceptual designs of five (5) specific applications using\ntechnologies suggested or approved by the NASA personnel at GSFC.\n\nThis report is arranged along the same logical flow employed in conducting\nthe study. It is thus demonstrated that the statement of work was properly\naddressed and the tasks were stepping stones to the final report.\n\n1..\n\n1-2\n\nMCOONNELL OOidliLAB ASTRONAC/T/CS COMPANY-ST.

Current issues if appropriate periodicals, e.g., ELECTRONIC\nENGINEERING TIMES and ELECTRONICS provided additional relevant information.\nMany of the researchers provided copies of papers which were not revealed\nby the libary data bank searches. A bibliography ap p ears as an appendix to\nthis report.\n\nThe statement of work upon which this study is based includes a comment to\nthe effect that a literature search is not a sufficient basis for determination of the state of the art of memory technology because the literature\nlags the art by at least a year. While this is true, the effectiveness is\nfurther compounded by the fact that devices are often described two or\nthree years before even samples are available.\n\nAnother aifficulty exists because a majority of the papers describing\nresearch activity are highly theoretical treatments. These seldom offer any\nfirm data relative to the applicability of the technology to specific\nmemory applications. Some of these problems were overcome by personel contact with the authors.\n\nA memory technology assessment prepared in 1975 by James E. Partak at the\nWhite Oak Naval Surface Weapons Center in Silver Spring, Maryland identified\n24 memory technologies complete with 1975 characteristics and those projected\nfor 1980. This list, presented as Table 2-1, formed the basis of the study.\nNo technologies not included in the table appeared during the course of the\nstudy.\n\nTo establish a common basis of understanding between the author and the\nreaders of this report, the following terms and acronyms are defined.\n\n2-1\nMCOONNELL OOIJGiLAS ASTRONA6/T1CS COMPANYST.

By convention ROM\'s are mask programmed during wafer fabrication\nand it is not possible to alter the contents.\n\nProgrammable Read Only Memory (PROM): A ROM whose contents are inserted\nby the user after fabrication. Typically the devices are manufactured with\na binary "1" stored in each memory location. Fuse links are provided to\nallow the user to insert "O\'s" as desired. Reprogramming is limited because\n"1\'s" cannot be recreated. PROM\'s are typically less expensive than ROM\'s\nfor low volume applications.\n\nErasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM): A PROM in which information\nis stored I n charge packets which are isolated from direct leakage paths.\nAlteration of the conducting characterisitcs of one or more circuit element\nper memory cell represents the stared data. Application of ultra-violet\nlight to the charge packets dissipates the charge and returns all memory\ncells to a common state. Charge packets may be created individually in\ndesired cells by application of a sufficiently high voltage to produce the\nnecessary tunneling effect.\n\n2-2\nMCOOAINELL "Cp UaLAS A0TROA/AUr1CS COINF 1A1(0V-aT LO[!/S X2#V1 /OA/\n\n\t\n\nS\nX"\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nMemory Technology Survey\t\n\nElectrically Alterable Read Only Memqry (EAROM): Like the PROM, the EAROM\nmay be reprogrammed. The essential difference lies in the technique employed\nto erase the device. The EAROH may be erased by application of a voltage\n(of opposite polarity to that used for programm i ng) to the programming pins.\nTypically these are Metal-Nitride-Oxide Semiconductor (MVOS) devices.\n\nElectrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM): This device\nis similar to the EAROM. Organization is typically Byte (8 bits) wide\nwith a single Byte or entire chip erasure provided. The essential difference\nbetween EEPROM\'s and EAROM\'s appears to be in the storage medium; the\nsurface layer between nitride and oxide in the former, and a floating silicon\ngate in the latter.\nRandom Access Memory (RAM): The designation RAM is misleading but generally\naccepted terminology. It implies that ROM\'s are not random access. These\nshould be called Read Write Memories (RWM\'s). Information is stored in\nbistable circuit elements whose states may be altered by application of\nappropriate voltages during the write operation. Typically RAM\'s are\nvolatile storage devices, that is the stored information is lost if the\noperating voltage is removed.\n\nBlock Oriented Random Access Memory (BORAM): A RAM in which addressing may\nbe accomplished only to a block of data bits (typically from 32 to several\nthousand bits) as opposed to the individual bit addressability of RAMs.\n\nSerial Addressed Memo (SAM): Reading or writing may be accomplished only\nby addressing the initial location involved in the data transfer. Subsequent\ntransfers involve locations specified by the memory circuitry.\n\nTable 2-1 is subdivided into three technology classes; Semiconductor,\nMagnetic, and Other. These subdivisions are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless it is reasonable to group the technologies in sets whose members\nexhibit similar operating characteristics.\n\nr\na\n\n2-3\n\nMCOONNELL DOUGLAS ASTW\'ONAUT/CS COMPANY-ST.

LOUl3 ar1Vl\'SION \t\n\na,y\n\nE\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nMemory Technology Survey\n\nRecent research reported by Bhattacharyya et. al. of IBM has produced a\n64K bipolar RAM which is referred to as a 1/N device. This approach provides\nbipolar performance with density approaching that of FET devices.\n1\t\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nDesign goals for the 64K RAM are 100 ns cycle time with 500 mw power dissipation using a single 5 volt power supply. The chip size is 30 mm2.\n\nNational Semiconductor bipolar research is aimed at reducing the cycle\ntime. Mike Milhollan of National predicts a 4K ECL RAM in the 5 ns range\nbefore 1987. 16K bipolar static RAMs should be commonplace by the latter\npart of this time period.\nMOS DEVICES\nResearch in MOS devices will be directed toward increasing storage density,\nimproving yield, increasing speed, and reducing the cost of testing. Several\ncompanies have announced 64K RAMs. T y pically these large devices contain\nredundant rows of cells which can be used to replace rows containing\ndefective cells.\n\nBell Labs has recently announced an improved Xray lithography system which\nthey predict will lead to production of submicron channel length MOS devices.\nThey report a speed power product of 5 femtojoules at a toggle rate of 2.5 GHz.\n\nIf the promises are fulfilled MOS switching speeds will exceed those of\nECL and begin to challenge GaAs. It is difficult to predict whether or not\nthis technique will yield production devices by 1987, but based upon past\nperformance of the industry it is reasonable to assume that it will. The\nVHSII program should increase the probability of success of this technique.\n\nFairchild predicts a static 64K MOS RAM in production by 1985 with a 256K\nversion by 1987. The latter will be a prototype 0.5 micron device. They\nalso predict 256K DRAM and 1 Mbit CCD production units by 1987. Projected\ncost of the latter is 0.75 millicent per bit in 1980 dollars. Fairchild\nis attacking the radiation tolerance problem by developing cool package\n\t\ncircuitry. Cool package lids are made from materials which do not themselves emit alpha particles.\n3-a\n/NC\xc2\xaeONNELL OOU01-AS ASTRONAUTICS COMPANY-ST. LOUIS DIVISION\n\nf:\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nMemory Technology Survey\n\nRobert Dennard of IBM, Yorktown Heights, New York predicts that 0.5 micron\ntechnology will yield a 2 Mbit MOS RAM by 1987 or 1988. Threshold voltage\nscaling restrictions will probably limit storage density in MOS devices to\n2 M bits. He feels that radiation tolerance problems can be solved at\nthe 1 micron level by incorporating some processing modifications.\n\nOTHER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES\nPresent indications are that 4K GaAs RAMs will be in production by 1983\nor 1984. Hence it is reasonable to assume that 16K versions will be available by 1987. The suppliers might elect to proceed directly from 4K to\n64K devices because they have a bank of processing experience carried over\nfrom other technologies.\n\nNational Semiconductor predicts a 128K FAMOS E 2 PROM by 1987. Since Intel\nhas a 16K E 2 PROM in production now, it is reasonable to assume that they\ntoo will have a 128K device by 1987. These memories become viable at this\nstorage density because they represent an alternative to MNOS for nonvolatile\nRAMs.\n\nMAGNETIC MEMORY DEVICES\nThe near term time frame will see 9 mil magnetic cores in voume production.\nIntel Magnetics predicts 4 M bit bubble chips with 200 K bit data rate and\noperating temperature range of -20 0 to 85\xc2\xb0C. 16 M bit devices will probably\nuse current access in a bubble lattice configuration. These devices will\nprobably not be available by 1987.\n\nRCA has demonstrated 60 M bit per in\n\nstorage density on magnetic tape.\n\nLaboratory versions have successfully operated at a 600 M bit data rate\nwith 10 -6 bit error rate. Storage capacity on a 1" by 4800\' tape is 5.4 x\n10 11 , Production versions of this unit will require about 2 to 3 years.\nIf funding is committed this will be available during the 1982-1987 time\nperiod.\n\n3-5\nMCOONNELL XPOL/aLAS ASTRONAUTICS\t\n\nDIVISION \t\n\ndtj\n\nI\nMemory Technology Survey\t\n\n4=\n^ ^^^ ^{y ^\t\n\n13 FEBRUARY 981\n\nOPTICAL DISC MEMORIES\nIf sufficient development funds are provided this technology will provide\nproduction models with 1011 bits storage capacity on one 12" disc.

One technique is a bubble lattice\nstructure controlled by magnetic fields produced by current sheets. As\nindicated earlier, IBM has temporarily shelved this approach in favor of the\nconventional bubble devices. Bell Labs continue to investigate this technique. A great deal of time and money will be required to implement this\ntechnique.\n\nOptical discs which write and read with laser diodes on an erasable medium\nwill be available by 1992 with or without military funding. The tremendous\nconsumer and commercial markets provide the incentive to develop this technology. External Funding will be required if military and/or space qualified\nversions are desired. Even if optical disc memories are not destined to\nfly, the technology should be supported because it is an attractive approach\nto low cost archival storage.\n\nThe VHSIC program will no doubt produce breakthroughs in semiconductor\nprocessing which could conceivably produce 1 M bit or larger radiation\nhardened RAMs by 1992.

Each of the address counters is a\n16 bit device which will accommodate 64K by 1 RAMs when they .become available. The current maximum packet length is 32K bits, but this will increase\nto 512K bits wizen 64K by 1 RAMs are employed.\n\nIn this design Packet Data are stored in ROM, RAM, the source sequence\ncounter and the parity generating circuitry. Table 4-6 specifies the\ncontents and storage location of each byte of the Source Data Packet. Ll,\nthe length of the Secondary Header, is contained in ROM byte 4. This can be\nused to preset the RAM address counter just prior to storing source data.\nThe only other presetting required for this counter is clearing it at the\nstart of Ancillary Data Storage. Control signals supplied to the 8 bit 4\nto 1 multiplexer in the output section of Figure 4-2 must guarantee that\nthe order listed in Table 4-6 is maintained when the packet is read. When\nthe RAM address counter contains the address of the last byte location\nreserved for source data during a storage operation a Packet Ready signal is\ngenerated. This signal is used in the Priority Determing logic circuitry.\nMissing control signals in Figure 4-2 are considered beyond the scope of a\nconceptual design.\n\nThe 16 bit source sequence counter poses a special problem. It must maintain a count module 2 16 ) of the number of source packets generated by the\nspecific source assembly. For this reason provisions must be made to\nrestore its contents in case of loss thereof, or it must be made nonvolatile.\nBattery backup could be provided or each bit of the counter could be stored\nin a nonvolatile cell such as an MNOS device. For example, Xicor has\nannounced counters in which each cell is backed up by a nonvolatile shadow\ncell into which the counter contents are written when the operating\nvoltage drops below a specified value.\nr\n\nr4-9\n\nMCOONNtc^t 00(1GLAS ASTRONAl1T/CS COMPANY-Sir.

Table 4-7 is a comparison of power requirements for the\nfunctional elements which constitute the Packet Buffer. Since none of the\nGallium Arsenide devices currently exist power requirements assigned to\nthem are based upon 100 microwatts per gate. Research at McDonnell Douglas\nindicates that dissipation in GaAs at 10 MHz or less should be from 50 to\n100 microwatts per gate and 200 to 300 microwatts per package output buffer.\nThe fact that Gallium Arsenide requires more power than CMOS is not surprising considering the frequency of operation. At 10 MHz the GaAs dissipation\nwould not change, while that for CMOS would increase by about a factor of\nfive. Either approach should require about 45 dual in line packages which\ncan be mounted on one 6 by 8 inch PC board. Volume estimate (excluding\nshielding and enclosure) is 24 cubic inches.\n\nThe RAM power requirements listed in Table 4-7 represent maximum operating\npower at 2 MB/s.

CMOS byte wide RAMs are not as\nplentiful as the 4K by 1 devices. Because failures in RAMs tend to affect\nall bits in a package, error detection capability is enhanced by storing\nonly 1 bit of a data word in any single RAM package. Since 4K by 1 CMOS\nRAMs are currently available and Gallium Arsenide versions are projected by\n1983, 4K byte storage is provided by using 8 packages. The RAM address\ncounters are 16 bits wide to accommodate 64K by 1 RAMs when they become\navailable. This will expand the capacity of the Packet Buffer to 512K\nbits.\n\nConsistent with anticipated usage of the Packet Buffer it was decided that\nrandom access was not required. To incorporate this feature it would be\nnecessary to provide 12 address lines along with suitable decoding circuitry\nfor the present capacity. Naturally the address requirements will be compounded if larger capacity RAMs are employed.\n\nTotal dose radiation hardness of 10 5 Rads (Si) is reported for CMOS by\nJ. P.

The support chips and control\ncircuitry may require shielding.\n\nIntel reports the weight of the 1 M bit bubble chip to be 100 grams. Allowing 10 grams each for the support chips which are required (see Figure 4-6)\nyields 410 grams for the 41 pieces. Each 4 M bit section requires a 6 by\n8 inch printed circuit board which weighs about 180 grams. The two populated\n4 M bit boards should weigh a total of 1600 grams.\n\nThe control circuitry, input buffer, and output buffers should require no\nmore than 3 additional populated 6 by 8 inch cards at 250 grams each. Thus,\nthe total weight of the 5 cards is estimated at 2650 grams. Allowing 600\ngrams for housing and 100 grams for connectors, hardware, and wiring yields\na total weight of 3350 grams (7.37 pounds) excluding shielding and power\nsupply.\n\nEstimating the power required is difficult because the total number and\ntype of logic funct ,.ios are unknown.

For example, a\nrequirement exists for writing 600 thousand 32 bit words per second. The\ndata are transmitted to the Spacecraft Mass Data Storage via the spacecraft\nbus at a typical rate of 1 M bit per second, Since it is anticipated that\nthis buffer will also serve as auxiliary storage for on board data processors,\nrandom access by word is required. Table 4-3 lists the characteristics of\nthe Experiment Data Storage.\nThe combination of 3M bit capacity, 180 cu in volume, 4 pounds weight, and\nradiation hardening listed in the model EDSB strongly suggest hybrid memory\npackages. It is recognized that problems may exist regarding space qualifications, but the largest currently available CMOS RAM chip has 4K bit\ncapacity. For example, 3M bits composed of 4K devices mounted two per square\ninch of board space would require a volume of 192 cu in without any allowance\nfor interface and control circuits.\n\nFigure 4-9 depicts the suggested architecture of a 32K by 2 hybrid composed\nof sixteen 4K by 1 static RAMs. To satisfy power and radiation hardness\nguidelines CMOS and Gallium Arsenide versions will be compared.

In this manner 32,768 words can be stored on each board.

S-Ince the RAMs dissipate less power in the\nstandby mode than when they are active, total power requirements may be\neased by reducing the number of bits involved in each write operation. Memory write cycle time trust be consistent with the multiple operations involved,\nand addressing smaller groups of bits requires more complex decoding circuitry.\n\nThe minimulp address requirement is 17 bits, 12 of which are decoded on the\nindividual RAM chips. This assumes 32 bits written in parallel. For\nCMOS RAMS the operating/standby power requirements are 75 mw/0.4 mw and\nwrite cycle time is 600 ns. Writing two 16 bit segments for each input\nword would require 1200 of the 1667 ns available. RAM power requirements\nwould be reduced from 2.8 watts to 1.6 watts at the expense of decoding one\nextra address bit.\n\nAccording to Zuleeg GaAs RAMs will have a 12 ns write cycle time with\noperating/standby power dissipation of 100 mw/10 mw. Power reduction\nachieved by reducing the number of active chips is not as dramatic as with\nCMOS devices because of the relatively high standby power requirement.\nWriting 16 bit segments in GaAs reduces dissipation from 13.1 watts to\n11.7 watts. The 12 ns write cycle time would permit writing 16 two bit\nsegments per word. However, the 4M bit system would still dissipate 10.4\nwatts and it would be necessary to decode 9 address bits.\n\nThe upshot is that GaAs is not as attractive as CMOS in this application\nunless a premium is placed on the ii,reased radiation tolerance. However,\nthe scheme discussed in the preceding paragraph would facilitate writing\nfour million 32 bit words per second.\n\nBecause of the excessive power requirements GaAs is not suggested for this\napplication. The conceptual design is based upon 64K CMOS hybrids.\n\nReading is accomplished by transferring sixteen bits of data from the\nappropriate RAMS to a shift register driven by a 1 MHz clock.\n4-23\n\nMCOONNER.L.

Thus 8 memory chips are\ninvolved with each read or write operation. Twelve of the outputs of the\naddress counter are decoded on the RAM chips. The other two are decoded\nto produce four page address signals. The address counter is simply cleared\nat the beginning of a storage operation and then sequentially advanced by\nthe system clock. If the entire memory capacity is not utilized, the address\ncounter contents can be stored when the last byte is written. Subsequent\nread operations can then be terminated without involving unused byte\nlocations.\n\nGaAs memory devices will be TTL compatible. Thus the non storage circuit\nelements in the HDRP can be bipolar. No significant power penalty results\nfrom this approach because the memory devices far outnumber these packages.\nIn the near term time period (1982 to 1987) the non storage elements will\nhave to be bipolar or CMOS. The latter will not support the 25 megabyte\ndata transfer rate.\n\nTotal operating power requirements are 4.64 watts; 800 mw for 8 active\nRAMs, 240 mw for 24 RAMs in standby mode, and an estimated 3.6 watts for\nthe bipolar devices. Standby power is 3.92 watts because the RAM power\nrequirements are reduced by 720 mw.\n\nThe components can easily be mounted on two 6 by 8 inch cards requiring a\nvolume of 80 in\n\nexclusive of power supply. Estimated weight is 920 grams\n\n(2 pounds).\n\nIncreasing the capacity of the HDRP to\n\nMbit (128K bytes) can be accom-\n\nplished by using 128K RAMs and absorbing a minimal increase in control\ncircuitry. Estimated consequences are: operating/standby power requirements\n3,\nincreased to 7 watts/6.28 watts, volume increased to 160 in\nand weight\nincreased to 1450 grams (3.2 pounds).\n\nx\n\n4-27\t\nMCOONI1i,SLL OOU[iLAS A7STRONAIJTOCS COMPANY-ST LOU yS 0/V/S/ON\n\na\n\nMemory Technology Survey\t\n\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nA CMOS version of the HDRP can be designed using 2K by 8 RAMS. Since the\ncycle time of these devices is about 120 ns direct reading and writing cannot\nbe employed. Some form of interleaving is required.\n\nOne approach is to terminate each data input line at the input to an 8 bit\nshift register. When 8 bytes of input have been received the contents of\nthe shift registers can be transferred to 8 bit latches which serve as\nsources for the RAM input buses. Each 8 bit latch would communicate with\nthe 8 data input lines of 1 RAM, thus, the combination of eight 8 bit shift\nregisters, eight 8 bit latches, and eight 2K by 8 RAMs will accommodate\n16K bytes during the write operation. The latches and RAMs will operate\nwith 320 ns cycle time if the data rate is 25 M bytes per second. The\nshift registers and latches will have to be bipolar because CMOS cannot\noperate at 25 MHz. Similar latch and shift register combinations must be\nprovided for reading.\n\nThe capacity of this version can be expanded in integer multiples of 16K\nbytes by adding groups of eight 2K by 8 RAMs and increasing the complexity\nof the addressing and control circuitry.\n\nHitachi supplies a 2K by 8 CMOS RAM for which they report 120 ns cycle time\nand operating/standby power requirements of 400 mw/75 mw. NEC and Toshiba\nare listed as second sources.\n\nA 128K HDRP using CMOS storFge devices and a mixture of CMOS and bipolar\ncontrol and interface circuitry should require an operating power of about\n7.5 watts. Volume, weight, and development cost should not differ greatly\nfrom those of the GaAs version discussed above.\n\nRetrievable Buffer (RB): Table 4-5 lists the requirements for a retrievable \t\n\n-\n\nbuffer. The anticipated application of this device is the collection of\ndata which do not require a real time link to earth.

Unfortunately this is an emerging technology. Experimental\nmodels have demonstrated the required data rate and storage density, but\nno production units exist. RCA and Phillips are the major investigators of\nthis technology. Neither company has announced a reliable production version of a laser diode.\n\nReliable laser diodes are an absolute necessity if optical disc recorders\nare to be flown aboard spacecraft. The volume and power requirements of gas\nlasers make them totally unsuitable. Larry Miller of Phillips Laboratories\nfeels that the work being done at their Eindoven facility will lead to production units by 1983. Details of their laser diode operation are considered\nproprietary. Donald Herzog of RCA feels that laser diodes with lOK hour\nlifetime priced at about $1K each in small quantities will be available\nwithin two years.\n\nMuch of the impetus behind the research efforts by RCA and Phillips is\nthe potential market for commercial and consumer devices. If any flight\nqualified units are to be developed, considerable financial support will be\nrequired. For instance, Herzog feels that such a program would require\ntwo to three years.\n\nMark Goldberg of NSA has been working with an Optical Disc recorder which\nhas a 5\n\nPa\n\nbit data rate and 10 10 bit capacity.

LOU/3 DIVISION\n\n1\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nMemory Technology Survey\nAPPENDIX\n\nGENERAL DISCUSSION OF SELECTED MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR MEMORIES\n\nThe class of semiconductor memory devices may conveniently be further divided\ninto Bipolar, Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor, and Other Technologies. These will\nbe briefly discussed.\n\nBIPOLAR\nThe Bipolar subgroup includes Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL), Emitter\nCoupled Logic (ECL), and Integrated Injection Logic (I 2 L). Still another\nBipolar technology is the so called I 3 L which is actually a variation of\nI2L.\n\nBipolar memory devices include RAM\'s, ROM\'s, and PROM\'s. Because of difficulties in scaling the individual transistors, bit densities are less than\nthose of competing technologies such as MOS. TTL and ECL require the same\npower to store data as to alter their contents. This imposes a penalty on\nthe devices in applications where it is necessary to minimize operating\npower. The advantages of Bipolar memory devices are high speed operation\nand radiation tolerance.\n\nBipolar technology is mature. Little research effort is indicated in the\nliterature. Efforts to increase bit density will continue but research\nappears to be concentrated on ^, ncreasing operating speed. For example\nNational Semiconductor predicts a 64K static: RAM within 10 years and a 4K\n5ns device by 1987.\n\nDuring the IEEE Solid State Circuits Conference in 1979 IBM announced the\ndevelopment of a 64K (8K by 8) bipolar dynamic RAM. Cycle time was reported\nto be 200 ns. Using a 2.5 um lithography provides density comparable to\nMOS (315\n\num2\n\nper cell).\n5L.\n\nA-1\nMCOONNA LL DOVOLAB ASTOW0MAUTICS COMPANY-ST. Louis OlV/S/ON\n6^4\t\n\nk\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nMemory Technology Survey\nMOs\n\nThe Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) family of technologies includes P and\nN channel (PMOS and NMOS), complimentary MOS (CMOS), Metal-Nitride-Oxide\nSemiconductor (MNOS), Floating Gate, and Charge Coupled Devices (CCD). A\nmajority of the solid state memory devices currently available \xc2\xab. \xe2\x80\xa2e manufactured using the technologies of this family. Major research effort over\nthe past five years has been directed at increasing bit density, reducing\npower, and increasing speed. Apparently these efforts will continue along\nwith an attempt to improve the radiation tolerance. Limited radiatior\nhardness is the chief disadvantage of MOS devices ds they presently exist.\nA brief discussion of the current status of each MOS technology follows:\n\nPMOS and NMOS devices are unipolar, i.e., only one type of charge carrier is\ninvolved in the conduction process. For PMOS the charge carriers are holes,\nwhile electrons are the carriers in NMOS. NMOS devices are easier to interface to TTL logic levels, possess superior speed-power products, and require\nless silicon area (for a given operating speed) than PMOS. For these reasons\nresearch activity has concentrated on NMOS. Very few PMOS memory devices\nare available.\n\n16K NMOS RAM\'s are available from several sources. Cycle times as low as\n70 ns are reported. Power requirements are typically 0.2 mw per bit in the\noperating mode and 0.03 mw per bit in standby. This reduced power in stand-\n\nby mode is possible because operating voltage can be removed from the nonstorage circuit elements on the chip and the storage elements can maintain\ndata at reduced voltage. Full operating voltage is required only when the\ncontents are being read or altered. 64K Dynamic RAMs have been introduced\nby several suppliers including Texas Instruments. For example TI\'s TMS 4164\nis reported to have a cycle time of 250 ns and power requirement of 200 mw\n(3 liw per bit). The refresh period is 4 ms. 64K NMOS ROMs are also available.\nA\n\n1\n\nA-2\nMCOONNELL 97OUC1LAS ASTRONALrTOCS COMPANY-ST. LOU/S 0/V/S/ON\n\nMemory Technology Survey\t\n\nREPORT MDG E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nCMOs\nTwo CMOs technologies currently exist, bulk silicon and silicon-on-sapphire\n(SOS). SOS devices exhibit lower values of leakage current than their bulk\nsilicon counterparts because the area between devices acts like an insulator\nrat`fer than a reverse biased diode. SOS also promises greater packing density\nthan bulk silicon. The greatest advantage of SOS over bulk silicon is, however, a potential speed advantage resulting from the reduced parasitic\ncapacitance losses as a consequence of the insulating (sapphire) substrate.\nProcessing difficulties have prevented SOS devices from developing at the\nrate predicted in 1975. Most suppliers have discontinued or severely curtailed CMOs SOS activity.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Bulk silicon CMOs memory devices exhibiting total\ndose radiation tolerance of 10 6 Rads (Si) have been reported in the literature,\ntypical specifications for hardened CMOs memories (for example Harris\nHS-6551RH) indicate total dose tolerance of 2x10 4 Rads (Si). No radiation\nhardened CMOS/SOS memory devices are currently available.\n\nThe largest CMOs memory device available today is the Harris HM5-6564.\nIt is actually a hybrid of 16 4K by 1 memory chips which offers a choice\nof 8K by 8 or 16K by 4 organization. Access time is under 350 ns while\noperating and standb y power requirements are reportedly 300 mw and 5 mw\nrespectively. Harris also provides mask programmable CMOs ROM\'s with 64K\ncapacity and access time of 550 ns ovet the full military temperature range.\n\nMNOS\nMNOS transistors differ from the conventional MOS devices in that a layer\nof silicon nitride lies between the gate and the silicon dioxide gate dielectric material. With a sufficiently thin oxide layer, it is possible to\nelectrically insert or remove charge from traps in the nitride near the\nnitride-oxide interface. Stored charge is retained for long periods of\ntime in the absence of operating voltage. Thus the MNOS device is a nonvolatile storage cell. Stored information is represented by two distinct\nlevels of threshold voltage corresponding to the presence or absence of\nstored charge.\n\nA-3\nMCOONNELL VOUCLAS ASTRONAUTICS COMPANY-SL L.OZAS VIVISION\n\n\t\n\ni\n\nREPORT MDC E2:\n\nMemory Technology Survey\n\n13 FEBHUARY 19\n\nRepeated switching of an MNOS transistor affects its ability to store charge.\nThe "endurance" of an MNOS transistor is a parameter relating the number of\nerase-write cycles to the time during which data may be retained. Westinghouse claims that their QORAM 6008 MNOS memory chip will retain data for\nmore than 10 ,years with 10 7 accumulated erase-write cycles. The 6008 is\norganized as 256 words of 32 bits each.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of MNOS memory devices is the relatively slow speed\noperation. For example, the Westinghouse QORAM 6008 requires 200 us to\nerase (the entire chip or 128 cells), and 50 us to write 32 bits. The\t\n\n-\n\nmaximum rate at which data may be read is 200 K bits per second. Power\ndissipation is reported to be less than 400 mw.\n\nRadiation tolerance of the 6008 is 3x10 4 Rads (Si) total dose. Westinghouse\nreports that 10 5 Rads (Si) total dose tolerance has been demonstrated on\na device made using processing similar to that for the 6008..\n\nSeveral suppliers provide MHOS memory devices with capacities to 8K bits.\nMajor research activity is being directed towards increasing chip capacity,\nincreasing speed, reducing power requirements, and increasing the radiation\ntolerance. MNOS devices should be given serious consideration for applications where the operating speed can be tolerated. Their non-volatility makes\nthem a serious contender in those applications now served by magnetic tape\nrecorders.\n\nCHARGE COUPLED DEVICES\n\nCOD\'s are ccmposed of shift registers formed by strings of MOS capacitors.\nCharge storage and transferral occurs between potential wells at or near\nSi\xe2\x80\xa2ISi0 2 interfaces. Data must be constantly recirculated to achieve storage.\nA typical CCD memory chip contains several individually addressable shift\nregisters which have refresh amplifiers to prevent loss of data during\nrecirculation periods.\ni,\n\nA-4\nMCOONNAELL OOIJQLAS ASTRONAUTICS COMPANY-ST.

Internal organization is 16 randomly accessible shift\nregisters each 4096 bits long. Each of the 4K shift registers is implemented\nusing a serial-parallel-serial (SPS) architecture. Thirty two bit input and\noutput registers service 64 internal registers each of which is 63 bits \'long.\nThe input and output register cells each accommodate two of the internal\nregisters. The operating frequency range is 1 MHz to 5 MHz. Operating and\nstandby power requirements are 376 mw and 80 mw respectively.\n\nCCD\'s suffer the same limits of radiation tolerance as other MOS devices.\nResearch activity is aimed at improving the radiation tolerance by: reducing\nthe die sensitivity to radiation; coating the die; and providing on chip\nerror correcting circuitry.\n\nIn May 1980 IBM announced a 256K CCD Memory. Organization can be either\n256K by 1 or 64K by 4. The shift register building blocks are 4K (32 by 128)\nSPS devices. The chip has eight isolated 32K octar-ts to balance loading on\nclock drivers, reduce undesired coupling between different sections of\nmemory, and to permit use of fractionally good devices. Power dissipation\nis listed as 310 mw with operating voltages of +8.5, +5.0, and -2.2 volts.\nThe chip is laid out using a set of 2.0 um minimum feature size photolithographic design rules.\nFLOATING GATE DEVICES\nThe Floating Gate memory cell stores information by trapping charge on a\nfloating (isolated) polysilicon gate. Since charge storage occurs as a\nresult of avalanche injection of electrons, and since the device is basically\nan MOS structure, this technology is sometimes referred to as FAMOS\n(Floating-Avalanche-Metal-Oxide Semiconductor). Actually, PROM\'s which\nuse ultraviolet light for erasing are FAMOS devices.\n\nr\n9\n\nA-5\n\n\'\nMCDONNNLL DOUCLAS ASTRONAUTICS COMPANY-ST.

The slow writing speed also severely limits their usefulness\nwhere non-volatile RAM is required.\n\nOTHER SOLID STATE TECHNOLOGIES\nCRYOGENIC MEMORIES\nCryogenic memory cells are based upon circulating current in superconducting\nloops. The magnetic flux created and maintained by the circulating current\nmay be sensed to indicate the logic value of the stored data. Josephson\nJunctions are used to provide high speed switchinq of the circulating\ncurrents. Zero power is required to maintain data. This is somewhat overshadowed by the need to maintain the device at 4 degrees Kelvin. Approximately 3000 watts of refrigerator input power are required for each watt dissipated by cryogenic devices.\n\nLittle is known about the radiation tolerance of Cryogenic memory devices.\nThe technology is by no means mature.

The core is a torroid formed of a\nmixture of powdered ferrite and bonding materials. To be suitable as a\nstorage element the core must have a nearly rectangular hysterisis loop in\nits B-H curve. Figure A-1 depicts such a curve.\n\nThe indivi!^ual cores are threaded on wires to form memory arrays. As shown\nin Figure A-1 a threshold current (Is) exists such that the magnetomo,tive\nforce produced thereby will switch the core to the logicl 1 state. Since\nIs/2 will not switch the core, selection is accomplished by the coincidence\nof half select current in each of two wires passing through the cores.\n\na I\n\nFIGURE A-1 B-H CHARACTERISTIC OF A FERRITE CORE\ny.\n\nA-10\nMCDONNHLL DOVOLAS A\'STRONAV 1r1C3 COMPANY-ST.IL0U1S D1Vv9puN\n\nMemory Technology Survey\t\n\nREPORT MDC E2365\n13 FEBRUARY 1981\n\nReading is accomplished by writing a zero (clearing) the core and noting the\nmagnitude and time of occurrence of a voltage pulse inducers in a sense wire\nwhich passes through the core. After a group of cores has been read each\nof them is in the zero logic state. This is an example of destructive reading. It is necessary to rewrite the data if permanent storage is desired.\nWriting is also a double operation, i.e., the cores are all cleared and\nlogical 1\'s written in the appropriate locations.\n\nThe disadvantages of core memories include relatively slow speed operation,\nthe need for extensive address decoding circuitry, line drivers capable of\nsupplying 1 ampere or more for selection, and the relatively low bit density\nof the complete system. The advantages of core memo r ies during their heyday\nwere random access, nonvolatility, and radiation tolerance. The significance\nof the latter is diminished by the fact that the support electronics limits\nthe radiation tolerance of the system.\n\nThe present status of core memories is perhaps best described by the units\navailable from Ampex Corporation. They produce 36 billion cores per year\nof which 25 billion are delivered to military customers. Those destined\nfor military applications are 100 percent tested at -60 0 , 25 0 , and 110\xc2\xb0C.\nYield varies from 60 to 80 percent.\n\nCores with overall diameters of 18 mils and 13 mils with thickness of 1.5\nor 3.0 mils are in production. Output signal amplitudes are 20 my and 15 my\nrespectively. A 9 mil core with 10 m y output is under development. The\n13 mil cores can be packed such that the areal density is 1782 bits per\nsquare centimeter.\n\nA typical 32 megabit system requires 720 watts (22 ism per bit).

System bit density is\nabout 45 bits per CM 3 . Operating power is 75 watts for 16,384 36 bit words\n(0.13 mw per bit). Read and write cycle times are 500 ns and 750 ns\nrespectively. Note that the data rate is comparable to that of cores, the\noperating power per bit is much lower, but the bit density is lower by a\nfactor of five.\n\nSperry Univac proposed an 18 megabit system (which was never built) with a\ndensity of 366 bits per CM 3 , operational power of 11.1 pw per bit, cycle\ntime less than 1 lisec, and projected cost of less than 1 cent per bit. It\nshould be noted that the only military plated wire memory system which\nSperry Univac ever delivered cost about $2 per bit.\n\nPlated Wire memories did not replace cores in random access applications\ndue in some measure to difficulties encountered in fabrication. ThL major\nobstacle to their development, however, was the development of solid state\nRAMs.\n\nCLOSED FLUX MEMORY\nIn 1973 this planar counterpart of plated wire memories appeared very\npromising. The Navy awarded development contracts to Ampex Corporation,\nRedwood City, California f,\xc2\xb0om 1970 to 1973. According to John Mallinson\nof Ampex, funding was withdrawn in 1973.\n\nAmpex claimed that Closed Flux memories were 10 times faster than cores.\nApparently they were never mass produced because they could not compete\nwith solid state devices in critical areas such as bit density (155 bits/CM2),\nand power requirements (0.2 watt per bit while reading). Since production\nversions were apparently never made, realistic cost estimates are not available. In 1973 John Keenan of Ampex reported that to make this technology\ncost competitive with semiconductor memories would have required "a multimillion dollar plant and huge volume." Apparently the anticipated volume did\n\nF\t\ni\n\nnot justify the necessary investment.\n\nA-13\nPACOONNELL OCPMAZLAS ASTRONALITICS COMPANY-ST.

The memory elements are\nformed by a series of vacuum depositions on a glass substrate. Copper\nsense/digit lines enclosed by nickel-iron bit locations need only to be driven\nby word drive lines which bracket the storage strips at regular intervals.\nBit density in 1975 was 40 bits/CM2.\n\nThe read operation is destructive thus requiring a restoring cycle if stored\ninformation is to be maintained after reading. Partak reported a 750 ns\ncycle time in 1975.

It was intended as a BORAM device\nin which writing was accomplisiied by a combination of an electrical current\nand a sonic pulse. The memory element (Soniscan R ) was apparently developed\nby Sylvania.\n\nA 1.2 Mbit system proposed in Partak\'s document had a 14 MHz data rate.\nStorage was nonvolatile, readout was non destructive and bit density was\n120 bits per CM 3 .

Garnet is\ntypically used as the thin film material. The easy axis of magnetization\nof the garnet is perpendicular to the plane of the film. In the absence\nof external magnetic fields magnetic domains within the thin film are evenly\ndistributed and are alternately magnetized in opposite directions normal to\nthe plane of the film.\n\nA-15\nMCOONNELL OOU01-48 ASBTRONAUTICS COMPANY-ST.

When the bias field strength exceeds a critical\nvalue the shrinking domains (those with magnetic polarity opposite to the\napplied field) divide into small segments which then contract until they\nbecome minute cylinders. When viewed head on these cylinders resemble\t\n\n{\'\n\nbubbles on the surface of a liquid.\n\nNonuniformity in the external magnetic field causes the bubbles to drift\ntowards those areas of weakest field strength. This characteristic is\nexploited in Magnetic Bubble memory devices. Permalloy tracks which are\nvacuum deposited above the garnet film form shift registers in the presence\nof a constant bias field (normal to the plane of the film) and a rotating\nin-plane field. By suitable placement of the permalloy circuit elements\nand application of appropriate magnetic field components bubbles can be\ncreated (nucleated), moved along prescribed paths, duplicated, detected, and\nan11hi1ated.\n\nEarly MBM devices consisted of one single shift register with a "seed"\nbubble from which bubbles could be replicated when writing logical 11s.\nThe register contained one stable bubble location for each bit of storage\ncapacity. A replicator-detector at the output made non destructive reading\npossible. Storage was nonvolatile because the bias field was created by\npermanent magnets.\n\nThe single shift register approach suffers from two disadvantages. The\naccess time to a desired bit position may be excessive. Of more concern,\nhowever, is the fact that a single fault in the shift register structure\nrenders the device useless. In practice a serial-parallel-serial shift\nregister arrangement is u,ed.

Of the 136 storage\nloops in each half 128 are used for data storage, 7 for error correction bits,\nand 1 is a spare. Both halves share common drive coils.

An anisotropic field of about 4\n\n0\n\nis induced\n\nin the permalloy strips by this technique. According to Dr. L. J. Schwee\nof Naval Surface Weapons Center (NSWC), Silver Spring, Maryland the properties\nof the deposited permalloy do not change more than about 5 percent over a\ntemperature range of -50\xc2\xb0C to 100\xc2\xb0C.\n\nMagnetic phenomena known as Crossties and Bloch Lines can be nucleated and\nannihilated by a p plication of appropriate magnetic fields which are created\nby current pulses in conductors located near the permalloy strips. Serrations in the edges provide stable locations for crossties and Bloch lines.\nThese are the storage (bit) locations.\n\nIn permalloy with anisotropic field strength of 4 O e the maximum crosstie\n\'linear density is about 3,000 per CM. Since the crossties can be made to\npropagate down the strip in the presence of an appropriate magnetic field\nthe serrated permalloy strips serve as shift register tracks. Typical\nbit locations are 10 um apart (1000 locations per CM) to permit the use of\na 50 ns period in the shifting mode. Strip width is less than 45 pm at its\nwidest point.
