First, a simple methodology based on traffic passenger modelling is\ndeveloped, and then an empirical analysis is conducted using time series from four\nglobal strategic alliances (Wings, Star Alliance, oneworld and SkyTeam) and 124\nalliance routes. The analysis concludes that, all other things being equal, strategic\nalliances do lead to a 9.4%, on average, improvement in passenger volume.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the last years, strategic alliances have become extremely popular\namong airlines since major and smaller carriers have increasingly sought to\nextend their service network through alliance schemes in order to build\nglobal network and, therefore, to attract more passengers. It seems that\nstrategic alliances enable the carriers involved to expand, without investing\nnew resources, the reach of their network and services to many parts of the\nworld where it may be not be economical for stand-alone carriers to operate\non their own and/or where they are not authorized to operate because of\nregulatory constraints.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nKostas Iatrou holds an MBA from ESLSCA Business School, Paris and a PhD from Cranfield\nUniversity, UK.

It focuses exclusively on a\nquantitative analysis of the impact of alliances on passenger traffic, trying\nnot only to determine whether there is indeed any impact on traffic as a\nresult of alliances but also to quantify it. In this sense, its seeks to confirm\nthe results of previous empirical and theoretical studies, whose findings\nindicate that alliances do lead to a significant increase in passenger traffic.\nA two-step approach is used. In the first step, a specific methodology of\ndetermining and measuring the impact of alliances is developed. This\nmethodology is mainly inspired by that used by Iatrou (2004) and Bissessur\n(1996). It is based on a passenger traffic model which relates passenger\ntraffic to a limited set of exogenous variables: (a) the per capita gross\ndomestic product (GDP) expressed in real terms as an index of\nincome/economic activity and (b) a capacity index (available seats),\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and fares. The second step consists first\nof the econometric estimation of the above regression model using time\nseries data, and then of the isolation and quantification of the alliance\nimpact. This latter is derived from the comparison of the traffic variation\ninduced by non-alliance factors (real GDP) with the observed traffic\nvariation during the post-alliance period.\nThe work contains significant innovative elements both in relation to the\ntime period examined and to the sample of routes-airlines studied. Not only\ndoes the evaluation study extend to the 1990s covering the period 1982-2001\nso as to include even the most recent years, but it also covers 124 alliance\nroutes served by the four global strategic alliances actually in force at the\ntime of the study (Wings, Star Alliance, oneworld and SkyTeam).\nFurthermore, it does not concentrate exclusively on North Atlantic flights, on\nhub-hub routes, nor on major airlines, as most previous studies on traffic\nhave done. At the same time, a more innovative and functional definition of\nthe alliance date formation is proposed in order to correctly assess the\nalliance impact on passenger traffic.\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nThe available empirical studies that have attempted to identify and\nevaluate the potential impact of alliances on traffic volume (and load factor)\nare quite limited in scope and most of them have been carried out recently.\nIn their majority, they conclude that there is indeed a positive impact as far\nas alliance routes and complementary alliances are concerned, confirming\nthe theoretical predictions of previous works (Brueckner, 2001; Oum, Park\n& Zhang, 2000; Park, 1997; Park & Zhang, 1998).\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\n75\n\nA brief overview of previous empirical works is presented below giving\nemphasis to their qualitative conclusions.\nImprovement in connecting services and flight frequencies, which can\ngenerate increased traffic without having to expand networks, are among the\nmajor benefits airline alliances can bring to passengers. More particularly,\nYoussef and Hansen (1994) found in the particular case of the Swissair/SAS\nalliance a rise both in quantity and quality of Swissair/SAS connecting\nservices, with the change in quantity of services being derived from an\nincrease in the number of flights between the two carriers hubs, while the\nimproved quality was brought about by both flight increases and better\ncoordination under the alliance. In a search that attempts to measure the\neffect of alliances on passengers\xe2\x80\x99 schedule delay of three transatlantic\nalliances (KLM/Northwest Airlines, Lufthansa/United Airlines and Delta Air\nLines/Swissair/Sabena), Oum, Park and Zhang (2000) suggest that\ncomplementary alliances (where partners have non-overlapping routes)\nenable partners to offer higher flight frequency to those passengers who fly\nbeyond non-stop city-pair routes, as well as to the majority of connecting\npassengers. Parallel alliance partners (where partners have overlapping\nroutes) are also expected to increase flight frequencies.\nWhile there is some evidence of increases in flight frequencies and\nmarket share resulting from alliance agreements, this does not automatically\nmean that there are more users, that is, more passengers. However, these\nrather limited in scope studies tend to conclude that alliances do impact\npositively on passenger traffic especially as far as complementary alliance\nroutes are concerned.\nGellman Research Associates (1994), in a study/research conducted at\nthe request of the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT), measured\nthe impact of the codesharing agreements between British Airways/USAir\nand KLM/Northwest Airlines on market share and welfare. In this study,\nthey measured, using U.S. Origin and Destination Survey ticket sample data\nfor the first quarter 1994 and flight alternatives, the market share effect by\nrelating the estimation over a sample of city-pair markets of a discrete choice\neconometric model. This model relates market share to the attributes that\ncharacterizes the flights offered (such as fare, overall trip time, service\nquality, code share, online versus interline service, etc.). The results indicate\nsignificant impact across the KLM/Northwest Airlines and the British\nAirways/USAir code share markets in the sample: lower market share by\n8.0% points for the former and 11.2% points for the latter under the\ncounterfactual scenario (no code share).\nThe U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO, 1995) concluded, mainly\nbased on interviews with representatives from governments and airlines, that\nstrategic alliances between U.S and foreign airlines, which involve code\nshare on a vast number of routes so as to strategically link airlines\xe2\x80\x99 flight\n\n76\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nnetworks, have generated large gains for the participating carriers in terms of\npassengers and revenues. U.S. GAO indicated that British Airways/USAir,\nKLM/Northwest Airlines, and Lufthansa/United Airlines have increased\ntheir annual traffic on their alliance routes as a result of the formation of\nthose alliances and that these gains can be attributed to: (a) code sharing and\nblock-space sales agreements on numerous alliance routes covering a wide\ngeographical area the alliance routes and (b) a high degree of operating and\nmarketing integration.\nThere is also evidence that traffic gains can occur whether airlines realign their strategies or not. Dresner, Flicop and Windle (1995) studied the\noutcome of three equity alliances (1988-Continental Airlines/SAS, 1989Delta Air Lines/Swissair and 1989-KLM/Northwest Airlines) in order to see\nwhether they have led to changes in airline route structure or not and to\ndetermine whether they have been successful in generating traffic or\nincreasing market share on international routes. Using before and after\nalliance data for the years 1987-1991, the analysis indicated that in only one\nout of three agreement cases have the airlines increased their transatlantic\ntraffic volume and increased their load factors after realigning their route\nsystems to take advantage of the alliance. More precisely, it showed that\nalthough both KLM/Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines/SAS\nfollowed re-aligning strategies, only the former achieved some successes in\nterms of traffic increase. On the contrary, Delta Air Lines/Swissair managed\nto increase their traffic and load factors despite not having re-aligned their\nroute structure strategies. Whether these results can be generalised is\nuncertain because the study was limited only to equity alliances on the\ntransatlantic routes. The overall conclusion was that alliances do not appear\nto guarantee success in the very competitive North Atlantic environment.\nIn his attempt to evaluate alliances\xe2\x80\x99 impact on passenger traffic,\nBissessur (1996) estimated a traffic model over the 1982-1992 period with\ndata for 52 inter-hub routes and from six major alliances (European Quality\nAlliance, Global Excellence, British Airways/USAir, KLM/Northwest\nAirlines, Continental Airlines/SAS and Iberia/Aerolineas Argentinas/Viasa).\nBy comparing the traffic change induced by non-alliance factors (real GDP)\nwith the actual level of traffic change between the pre- and post-alliance\nperiods, he showed that major alliances lead to traffic increases on hub-hub\nroutes with the exception of two routes (Copenhangen-Zurich and ViennaGeneva). A further cross-section indicated that the main factors behind the\nalliances\xe2\x80\x99 operational success are: (a) the partners\xe2\x80\x99 network size and the\ncompatibility of these networks, (b) the frequency of service between the\nhubs of the partners, (c) the flight connection time at the hub, and (d) the\nlevel of competition on their networks.1\n1\n\nSee also Bissessur and Alamdari (1998).\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\n77\n\nPark and Zhang (1998) and Oum, Park and Zhang (2000) looked at the\neffects of an airline alliance on partner airlines\xe2\x80\x99 outputs by comparing traffic\nchanges on alliance routes with those on non-alliance routes for the period\n1992-1994. Using panel data of the four major alliances (British\nAirways/USAir, Delta Air Lines/Swissair/Sabena, KLM/Northwest Airlines\nand Lufthansa/United Airlines) operating non-stop routes on North Atlantic\nmarkets (19 alliance and 36 non-alliance routes) for the 1992-1994 period,\nthey found that most of the partners have recorded greater traffic increases\non their alliance routes than on their non-alliance routes. More specifically,\nthe alliance routes of the eight airlines studied showed traffic increases\nranging between 6.8% and 66.8% whereas non-alliance routes showed traffic\ndecreases of as much as 3.2% and increases of up to 9.1%.\nOum, Park and Zhang (2000) sought to empirically investigate the\neffects of alliances on air fares, passenger volume, and consumer surplus by\nstudying four major alliances operating on the transatlantic markets for the\nperiod 1990-1994. By estimating a system of demand and price equations\nusing a database consisting of seventeen transatlantic alliance routes, they\nconcluded, by comparing pre- and post-alliance outcomes, that the British\nAirways/USAir, KLM/Northwest Airlines and Lufthansa/United Airlines\nalliances, which can be considered as complementary alliances, increased\naggregate demand on their alliance routes during the post-alliance period,\nwhile the Delta Air Lines/Swissair/Sabena, which can be viewed as a parallel\nalliance, decreased aggregate demand on their alliance routes during the\npost-alliance period. In a separate analysis studying the effect of alliances on\nthe partners\xe2\x80\x99, the non-partners\xe2\x80\x99 and total traffic, they found that: (a)\ncomplementary alliances increase total output by an average of 11-17%,\nwhile parallel alliances decrease total output by an average of 11-15% and\n(b) the results for the non-partners\xe2\x80\x99 traffic are consistent with their\ntheoretical predictions, which indicate that complementary alliance adversely\naffect non-partners\xe2\x80\x99 output.\nFinally, Iatrou (2004) and Iatrou and Alamdari (2003) showed, through\na series of interviews and questionnaires with the executives of the alliance\ndepartment of airlines participating in the four global strategic alliances\n(Wings, Star Alliance, oneworld and SkyTeam), that alliances have indeed\nproduced the expected positive impact in terms of traffic.\nMETHODOLOGY AND DATA\nThe methodology used in order to measure the alliance impact relies on\na time series estimation of a traffic regression model. It is mainly based on\nthe comparison of traffic variation induced by non-alliance factors, that is,\nper capita GDP in constant prices (RGDPPC), with the observed traffic\nvariation during the post-alliance period.\n\n78\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nModelling the Airline Alliance Impact on Traffic\nA simple way, but not an exhaustive one, to model traffic demand is to\nrelate passenger traffic positively to real economic activity\xe2\x80\x94as this is\nreflected by the per capita GDP in constant prices (RGDPPC)\xe2\x80\x94and capacity\n(CAP) as a proxy of airline frequency, HHI for route specific competition\nand negatively to real fares (RY).2\nThus, the following multiplicative traffic model3 results:\nPASSijt = A RGDPPCjt b CAPijt c RYijt d 10(eHHIjt fD)\nwhere\n\n(1)\n\nPASSijt = Passenger Traffic for the airline pair i, route j\nand year t,\nRGDPPCjt = Real GDP per capita of the origin country for\nthe route j and year t expressed in local currency,\nCAPijt = Capacity for the airline pair i, route j and year t,\nRYijt = Real yield for pair i, route j and year t. As a proxy\nof real yield, the world nominal yield\xe2\x80\x94in United States\nDollar (USD)\xe2\x80\x94converted into local currency and deflated\nby national inflation rate is chosen, while local and\nnational refer to the origin country. The world passenger\nrevenue per passenger kilometre, in USD, is used as a\nmeasure of nominal yield,4\nHHIjt = Route specific competition for route j and year t,\nand\nD = A dummy variable which takes value one for the years\n1980-81 (Second oil shock), 1991 (Gulf war) and 2001\n(terrorist attacks on September 11) and value zero in all the\nother years;\n\n2 Of course, traffic for any given route tends to arise from the complex interaction of a much larger set of factors that\naffect the different market segments differentially. Two main categories of factors can be distinguished (Doganis,\n2002). The first one includes those factors affecting all markets (level of personal disposable income, supply\nconditions, convenience of air travel, level of economic activity/trade, population size and growth rate, social\nenvironment, attitudes to travel, etc.). The second one includes the factors that affect only particular routes but may be\ntotally absent on others (level of tourist attraction, exchange rate fluctuations, travel restrictions, historical/cultural\nlinks, earlier population movements, current labour flows, nature of economic activity, etc.).\n3 A major disadvantage of using load factor when measuring the alliance impact is that the alliance impact is highly\naffected by service frequency. Any alliance is usually accompanied by an increase in service frequency, as the partners\nattempt to integrate their networks and gain market share, which in turn will affect negatively load factors given that\ntraffic is likely to respond only gradually to any increasing frequencies.\n4 It is acknowledged that the use of a global measure of nominal yield could lead to a mis-estimation of the price\nvariable impact and thus increase the chances of finding a non-significant price impact.\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\n79\n\nwhich may alternatively be expressed as:\nLogPASSijt =\na + b LogRGDPPCjt + c LogCAPijt + d LogRYijt + e HHIjt + f D\nwhere\n\n(2)\n\nLog( ): log to the base 10,\na = LogA,\nb, c and e > 0,\nd < 0.\n\nDisposable income\nAny development in personal income affects the level of the purchasing\npower and the propensity to undertake leisure travel in general and air travel\nmore specifically. As income increases two things take place: First, a greater\npart of the disposable income is spent on non-necessary consumer goods\nincluding air travel. Second, air travel, which constitutes a more expensive\nbut also a more convenient means of transport for longer distances, becomes\nmore accessible and more competitive (Lansing & Blood, 1984). Therefore,\ngreater income results in an increase of expenditure on leisure traveling, but\nalso in air transport being favoured over other competitive and alternative\nmeans of transport, especially for longer destinations. Taking into account\nthat data concerning disposable income are not always available and that the\nway of measuring it differs from country to country, the use of GDP as a\nproxy measure is considered as essential.\nThe use of GDP is considered as the most appropriate measure for at\nleast two more reasons.5 First, it does constitute a measure index of national\nincome and wealth and is included among the major determinants of leisure\ntravel. As real GDP increases, people tend to have more income to consume\n(Kanafani, 1983) and at the same time the improvement of living standards\nleads to changes of consumer habits. These changes favour certain categories\nof goods and services, such as leisure activities, including travelling, which\npresent high demand/revenue elasticities. Second, it does constitute a\nmeasure index of business activity and therefore wealth, and is included\namong the major determinants of business traveling.6\nAny increase in population also leads to an increase in passenger traffic\nwith the exception of the less developed countries, for which this relation\n5 The choice of per capita GDP as an approximation of personal disposable income does entails certain risks and\nrestrictions as it assumes a homogeneous allocation of income among all classes and citizens.\n6 The demand for business travel is not directly related to the disposable income of the business travelers themselves\nbut to the needs of the businesses they work for. These needs are however directly related to the economic activity,\nand thus to national income and wealth.\n\n80\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\ndoes not apply in most cases, if at all; for the simple reason that a large part\nof the population simply cannot afford air travel.\nRGDPPC as an explanatory variable presents many advantages, given\nthat it is a composite variable that combines real GDP and population, two\nimportant explicative determinants of passenger traffic, as mentioned above,\nwhile it permits the avoidance of a third one, that of exports. Furthermore, it\ncan be considered as a variable totally independent of the alliance formation.\nCapacity\nThe use of seat kilometre available as an index measure of capacity\nand proxy of frequency entails a positive impact on passenger traffic for two\nreasons. First, any increase of available seats for any given level of demand\ncan lead to higher supply and to fares\xe2\x80\x99 decrease, which can boost passenger\ntraffic. Second, any increase in frequency can lead to the improvement of\nservice quantity, which in its turn enables airlines/alliances to attract more\npassengers and convince them to use airplanes over any alternative and\ncompetitive means of transport, especially in relation to short haul and\ndomestic flights, always provided of course that air fares remain affordable.\nIncreased service frequency can also stimulate traffic as more flights are\noffered at convenient times.7 At the level of specific airlines or routes, there\nis certainly an additional argument that renders frequency/capacity a\nsignificant parameter: increases in service frequency can increase the market\nshare of an airline in relation to that of its competitors; this principle has\nbeen conceptualised in the generally accepted S-curve variation of market\nshare with frequency (Taneja, 1981).\nIn a way, CAP can be considered as an index of the improvement of\nthe quantity of service and, contrary to RGDPPC, it can be indeed\n\n7 An implicit assumption of the traffic regression model is that the cause-and-effect relationship, if any, between\ntraffic and frequency/capacity is unidirectional: The explanatory variables are the cause and the dependent variable is\nthe effect. It seems however, that in the particular case of traffic and capacity, such a one-way cause-and-effect\nrelationship is not meaningful. This occurs because traffic is determined by frequency/capacity, and\nfrequency/capacity is, in its turn, partly determined by traffic. As a matter of fact, higher frequency/capacity can\nstimulate traffic, but at the same time, a rising demand resulting from an increase in GDP can lead to an increase in\nfrequency/capacity to accommodate the higher number of passengers, which makes the relationship a two-directional\none. In short, this simultaneous relationship renders any distinction between dependent and explanatory variables\ndubious, and the least-squares estimators are, in this case, not only biased but also inconsistent since the endogenous\nexplanatory variables become stochastic as they are correlated with the disturbance term of equation in which it\nappears as an explanatory variable (Gujarati, 1995). In order to overcome the problem of the simultaneous-equation\nbias, one could proceed to the estimation of a simultaneous two equations model, one for each of the jointly dependent\nvariables, but first, it is necessary first to test the hypothesis of the mutual dependency using, for example, the pair\nwise Granger causality test (Granger, 1969).\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\n81\n\nconsidered as an alliance factor since the formation of the airline alliance can\nchange dramatically the frequency of service (Youssef, 1992).\nFares\nApart from income and capacity, price is another variable that might\nhave a major impact on air travel demand. Obviously, air travel prices are\nexpected to have a negative impact, since price and demand usually move in\nopposite directions. If a fare goes up, demand is expected to fall, and vice\nversa. Given that low fares, or a limited change of fares, are likely to\nstimulate demand particularly in the leisure market,8 it is necessary to\ninclude them in the regression model. Moreover, it would be illogical not to\nascribe some part of the dynamic development of passenger traffic observed\nin recent years to the moderate evolution of nominal fares (Iatrou, 2004).\nPrevious studies on the issue of traffic have made use of airline yield as\na good approximation of fare levels (Bissesur 1996; Morrison & Winston\n1990). Airline yield indicates the passenger revenue per passenger-kilometre,\nthat is, the ratio revenue to passenger-kilometres.\nThe choice of yield instead of fares is due to the various problems that\nhave arisen from the use of ABC World Airways Guides that constitute the\nmost official and sole information source of fares. First, available data are\nnot very reliable in that they do not give the actual fares being paid. Indeed,\nowing to various unofficial discounts, the fares paid by consumers differ,\noften widely, from the published fares. In addition, the fare data are very\ncomplex with many different fare classes. Another restriction associated with\nthe use of fares is that the available guides do not list fares for all\ndestinations. The only fares that are consistently listed are those between the\nmajor hubs. On the whole, what characterizes all routes is the virtual nonavailability of data for fares, their relative unreliability, which resulted in a\ndifficult data processing to obtain the required complete and consistent time\nseries. For this reason, it was decided that fares should not used as a variable\nmeasuring air travel demand, and yield is used instead.\nIn any case, it becomes obvious that yield has to be adjusted for price\ninflation so as to establish the real cost of air travel in relation to other goods\nor services and hence to correctly assess the role of air travel prices.\nThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)\nCompetition is a key factor of traffic growth and is expected to influence\nit negatively. In order to take into account the competition impact the well8 Of course, fares are not expected to influence business and leisure travel in a uniform way. Since business travellers\ndo not pay for their own travel, their demand would be relatively insensitive to fare changes and their price elasticities\nwould be lower than those of leisure travellers. An examination of price elasticities in some studies shows this to be\ntrue (Straszheim, 1969).\n\n82\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nknow Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), is used. The HHI is used to\nmeasure the impact degree of competition and market concentration a certain\nmarket faces by investigating the market share of each firm. The HHI takes\ninto account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market and\napproaches zero when a market consists of a large number of firms of\nrelatively equal size. The HHI increases both as the number of firms in the\nmarket decreases and as the disparity in size between those firms increases.\nIt is intended to correct the possible misleading results guided only by the\nnumber of firms in the market. For example, an index of the number of firms\nwill consider a market with 100 firms as competitive without recognising\nthat two firms share 90% of the market, with the other 98 firms sharing only\nthe remaining 10%. To account for both the number of firms and their\nmarket shares, the HHI is defined as the sum of the squared market share of\neach firm in a market as expressed in following equations 3 and 4:\n\nAi =\n\nSi\n\n(3)\n\nn\n\n\xe2\x88\x91S\ni =1\n\ni\n\nn\n\nHHI =\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 (A )\ni =1\n\ni\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\ni\n: the i-th airlines in the market,\nn : the number of airlines in the market,\nS i : the annual volume of the i-th airlines,\n\nAi : the market share of the i-th airlines, and\nHHI: the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the market.\nAccording to the definition of the HHI, the greater the HHI the less the\ncompetition exists in the market. In the extreme cases, a monopolistic\nmarket has an HHI equivalent to 1, and the HHI of a market with a perfectly\ncompetitive structure is close to zero.\nTherefore, HHI is expected to have a positive sign since a lowcompetition environment will all others things being equal induce a higher\ntraffic growth.\nIsolation of the Alliance Impact by Separating Alliance and Non-alliance\nEffects\nGiven that traffic is explained by alliance and non-alliance factors,\nalliance impact can be deducted by neutralizing the influence of the latter. In\n\n83\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\nother words, the evaluation of the alliance impact relies on the isolation of\nthe RGDPPC effect, and therefore, on the comparison of the observed traffic\nvariation with the traffic variation induced by RGDPPC during the postalliance period.\nSuppose that passenger traffic is a function of RGDPPC according to the\nequation below:\nLogPASSt = a + b LogRGDPPCt\n\n(5)\n\nIt follows that parameter b represents the elasticity of traffic with respect\nto RGDPPC, given that the endogenous and the exogenous variables are\nexpressed in logarithmic terms:\nPASS t \xe2\x80\x93 PASS t-1\nPASS\n\nb=\n\nRGDPPC\n\nt\n\n(6)\n\nt-1\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 RGDPPC\n\nRGDPPC\n\n(6)\n\nt-1\n\nt-1\n\nIn the case of an autoregressive traffic regression model\xe2\x80\x94that is, one\nwhere the lagged value of the dependent variable appears as an explanatory\nvariable on the right-hand side of the equation\xe2\x80\x94b represents only the\nRGDPPC short term impact on traffic. Its long term or total impact is then\ngiven by:\n\nb\n\nLT\n\n=\n\nb\n(1-estimated coefficient of PASS\n\n(7)\nt-1\n\n)\n\nConsidering that the percentage variation in RGDPPC from alliance\nformation (t) to post-alliance period (t+) is g%, it follows that the passenger\ntraffic change induced by RGDPPC will be bg% (or bLTg%). If the observed\npercentage traffic variation during the given period is k%, then the\npercentage change in traffic brought about by the alliance formation can be\napproximated by (k-bg)% [or (k-bLTg)%]. An approximate value of the\nabsolute change in traffic that results from the alliance formation is then\ngiven by r[(k-bg)/100] or r[(k-bLTg)/100] where r indicates the passenger\ntraffic level at (t).\nBecause, as the airlines themselves have mentioned in the\naforementioned survey and interviews, any given impact on traffic is\ngenerally observed quite rapidly\xe2\x80\x94that is, within the first two years after\ntheir joining the alliance\xe2\x80\x94t+ is set arbitrarily to t+2 and k% is equal to:\n\n(7)\n\n84\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nk% =\n\nPASSt+2 - PASSt\n\n(8)\n\nPASS t\nOne of the main weaknesses of this methodology is that it assumes that\nthe alliance impact is equal to the observed variation in traffic volume, that\nis, k%, whenever the RGDPPC is found to be non-significant (b = 0). The\nreason is that RY and CAP are considered as alliance factors whereas\nRGDPPC as a non-alliance factor. This can lead to a misestimation of the\nalliance impact on passenger traffic insofar as fares and capacity do not\ndepend solely on alliance strategies; they are clearly influenced by a set of\nother factors independent of alliance formation9.\nESTIMATION METHOD AND DATA\nThe parameters will be determined by a time-series linear regression\nusing ordinary least squares (OLS) unless the detection of heteroskedasticity,\nautocorrelation or both, requires the use of generalized least squares (GLS)\nin order to obtain efficient estimators and to render the usual hypothesistesting procedure valid. In the case of heteroskedasticity, the White\xe2\x80\x99s\nheteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix is chosen in order to produce\nconsistent coefficient\xe2\x80\x99s standard errors. In the autocorrelation or both\nheteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, the estimated generalized least\nsquares (EGLS) is required; but one can also simply introduce the oneperiod lagged dependent variable among the explanatory variables.\nThe time span is the pre-alliance period (1982 to t) where t is defined as\nthe date when the two partners involved extended their bilateral agreement to\nthe route under consideration. Whenever the cooperation agreement entered\nin force in the first semester of year t, year t is considered as the alliance\nformation date. In case the cooperation began later in the year, In the\nopposite case, t+1 year is supposed to be the alliance formation date. One\nmajor problem which could not be overcome is that the pre-alliance period is\noften quite short to allow consistent econometric results. This is especially\ntrue for the partnerships that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nThe main tests used to assess the quality of the estimation are the\nadjusted R2 statistics, which gives a measure of the goodness of fit, and the F\n9 A fare and capacity model should have been estimated in order to quantify exactly the impact of an alliance on these\nvariables, that is, which part of their changes during the post alliance period is due to the alliance and which is not. If it\nis assumed that \xcf\x86 and \xcf\x89 indicate respectively the part of the variation of fare and capacity that is not due to an alliance\nthen the alliance impact is equal to (k-bg-\xcf\x86df-\xcf\x89cv)% when b \xe2\x89\xa0 0 or (k-\xcf\x86df-\xcf\x89cv)% when b = 0, where f% and v%\nrepresents respectively the variation of fares and capacity over the t+2 and t period. The approach used above supposes\nexplicitly that \xcf\x86 and \xcf\x89 are zero. It follows there is overestimation of the alliance impact on traffic whenever (\xcf\x86df)% >\n-(\xcf\x89cv)% and underestimation whenever (\xcf\x86df)% < -(\xcf\x89cv)%.\n\n(8)\n\n85\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\nstatistics, which constitutes a measure of the overall significance of the\nestimated regression (joint test that all the regression coefficients are zero).\nFurthermore, some additional tests will be used to check whether some\nimportant assumptions of the classical linear regression model are fulfilled.\nMore specifically, the hypothesis that disturbances are homoscedastic (White\ntest) and uncorrelated (Durbin-Watson test) has to be controlled for. In the\nparticular case the lagged dependent variable appears among the exogenous\nvariables, the h-Durbin test will be used to test the error serial\nautocorrelation of order one.\nIn all cases, the e-Views software package is used in parallel with SPSS.\nThe latter has been chosen in order to proceed to a step-wise regression\nwhich aims at determining which of all the explanatory variables is the most\nsignificant one.\nThe passenger and capacity data have been obtained by the series\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraffic by flight stage\xe2\x80\x9d published by International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO). When such data were missing, they were obtained\ndirectly from the airlines (Air Canada year 1997) and the US DOT\n(KLM/Northwest Airlines years 1999-2001, American Airlines/Finnair years\n1996-1997, Aeromexico/Delta Air Lines year 2000, Air France/Delta Air\nLines year 1997 and SAS-United Airlines year 1991). Since the US DOT\ndoes not publish data on a one-way basis but on a round trip basis, data for\nany specific year, for which data are missing, had to be split based on each\none-way route\xe2\x80\x99s past average percentage of total traffic.10 For five additional\nroutes, specific computation was needed in order to overcome the problem\nwith missing data in relation to traffic and capacity for some specific years.11\nIt should be stressed that in all cases, the estimation of non-available data,\nwhatever method is used, tends to exacerbate the problem of measurement\nerror, a phenomenon frequently met in econometrics.\nReal GDP per capita was obtained from the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) World Economic Outlook Database. All GDP series are\nexpressed in local currency.\nThe world passenger revenue per passenger kilometre (in USD) was\nobtained by ICAO Financial Data Commercial Airlines.

They include hub-hub, hub-non hub\nand non hub-non hub routes, all served by airlines which are members of the\nmajor four global airline alliances, that is, Wings, Star Alliance, oneworld\nand SkyTeam. Only routes with consistent and sufficient data are included in\nthe analysis since the aim of the data collection process was to minimize\npotential sources of measurement error bias, which could affect the\neconometric results and lead to misspecification problems. At any rate,\nspecial attention has been given to the selection of routes. The selection was\neffected in a way so as to retain the representative character of the sample\nregarding the degree of cooperation and the type of routes for each global\nstrategic alliance.\nThe sample, as it becomes clear from Table 1, is mainly dominated by\nhub-hub and hub-non hub routes, which represent 96.8% of the total number\nof routes analysed (43.6% and 53.2%, respectively) and 99.2% of the total\npassengers carried during the year 2001 (62.1% and 37.1%, respectively).\nMoreover, Star Alliance tends to be over-represented, while the other three\nmajor alliances are under-represented compared to their respective weights\nin the total traffic of the four global strategic alliances taken together. This\nfact is related mostly to: (a) the belated entry of certain airlines in a given\nalliance, (b) the late start date of cooperation between two airlines within a\ngiven alliance, (c) the late start of some flights which began during the\n2000s, and (d) the availability of relevant data.\n\n12 Digest of Statistics on the Traffic by Flight Stage Series arranged by flight stage are available since 1969, but for\nthe pre-1982 period, data were only published for the four selected months of March, June, September and December.\nSeries containing aggregate annual data are only available since 1982. This is the main reason why the observation\nperiod began in that year.\n\n87\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\nTable 1: Number of routes examined for traffic impact of alliances, by alliance, type of\nroutes and number of passengers in 2001\nHub-Hub\nWings\n\nHub-Non\n\nNon Hub-\n\nHub\n\nNon Hub\n\nTotal\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nNo of pass.\nStar Alliance\n\nNo of routes\n\n(0)\n\n(1,222,255)\n\n(0)\n\n(1,222,255)\n\noneworld\n\nNo of routes\n\n44\n\n46\n\n2\n\n92\n\nNo of pass.\n\n(8,240,293)\n\n(4,568,748)\n\n(91,796)\n\n(12,900,837)\n\nSkyTeam\n\nNo of routes\n\n4\n\n4\n\n0\n\n8\n\nNo of pass.\n\n(1,409,335)\n\n(316,727)\n\n(0)\n\n(1,726,062)\n\n6\n\n6\n\n2\n\n14\n\n(1,697,388)\n\n(663,506)\n\n(51,416)\n\n(2,412,310)\n\nNo of routes\n\n54\n\n66\n\n4\n\n124\n\nNo of pass.\n\nTotal\n\nNo of routes\nNo of pass.\n\n(11,347,016)\n\n(6,771,236)\n\n(143,212)\n\n(18,261,464)\n\nEMPIRICAL RESULTS\nThe econometric results tend to indicate that strategic alliances lead, on\naverage, to a clear improvement in passenger traffic.\nTraffic Model\nOverall, the estimated models on the route level are quite satisfactory,\nall having a high goodness of fit and consequently high explanatory powers,\nexcept for certain routes. In fact, the explained variance of passenger traffic\nrepresents more than 90% of total variance in 68.5% of the cases, while it\nexceeds the 70% level in 93.5% of the cases. Although, the stepwise\nregression method was used in order to obtain the best specification\xe2\x80\x94that is,\nthat which includes the most significant set of exogenous variables and\nguarantees the highest goodness of fit\xe2\x80\x94significant results could not be\nachieved for eight routes. For these routes the adjusted multiple coefficient\nof determination does not exceed 60%. One probable explanation for the low\nexplanation of these models could be the short observation period and the\nsmall number of data points upon which the regressions were based. In any\ncase, the conclusion reached is that for these routes, the selected set of\nexplicative variables cannot be considered as major and significant\ndeterminants of passenger traffic.\nFurther, the models also present high F-statistics ascertaining their\nvalidity and the significance of the retained exogenous variables, at least for\n96 routes. Independent variables all had high t-statistics implying that the\n\n88\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nprobability of them actually being zero is null at the 5% significance level.\nOn the other hand, the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that serial\nautocorrelation of first order of the disturbance was a serious problem for 68\nroutes. Thus, a correction was necessary, whether by introducing the lagged\ndependant variable (PASSt-1) in 23 cases or by estimating an Estimated\nGeneralized Least-Squares (EGLS) in 41 cases, supposing that the\ndisturbances follow an autoregressive error model (AR).\nIn all cases, the heteroskedasticity was not a major problem, but\nwhenever and wherever it was detected, it was automatically corrected by\nthe White method, namely by the estimation of a consistent covariance\nmatrix.\nAs expected, the CAP has been revealed as the most important factor in\nexplaining the variation in passenger numbers, since it appears in the\nmajority of the models (97.6%, i.e., 121 routes) and exhibits a high degree of\nstatistical significance,13 while the RGDPPC seems to have a more reduced\nimpact, being significant in less than half of the cases (49.2%, i.e., 61\nroutes). That tends to indicate that these markets\xe2\x80\x94the routes included are\nmostly non North-American originating\xe2\x80\x94have not yet reached maturity. At\nthe same time, RGDPPC is not significant for U.S. and Canadian originating\nroutes. The short-term elasticity of traffic to RGDPPC lies in a wide range\nfrom 0.16 to 3.72, while it varies between 0.5 and 2.0 in 65.6% of the routes\n(80.3% when one takes into account the long term elasticity as well). These\nvalues are satisfactory considering that Bissessur (1996) obtained a similar\nrange of values, but they exceed the values obtained previously for the\nincome elasticity of demand for international air travel traffic (0.9 to 1.1).\nFinally, it seems that for 50.8% of the selected routes the alliance impact is\nequal to the traffic variation observed during the post-alliance period, since\nthe methodology used supposed that whenever RGDPPC is found to be nonsignificant, any traffic variation induced by RGDPPC is null.\nAs indicated above, the capacity provided by the alliances is present in\nnearly all the models. This tends to demonstrate that any change in capacity\nintroduced by an alliance is very likely to affect the traffic carried by the\npartners and therefore the network economies which might result. In onethird of the cases, the coefficient is less than unity, which means that any\nchange in alliance capacity results in a lower than proportional increase in\ntraffic.\nAs far as the real yield is concerned, the results were quite disappointing\ngiven that the price variable does not appear in many regressions. This\nvariable seems to influence significantly the passenger traffic only in the\ncase of 16 routes (12.9% of the total routes). This contradicts previous\n13 One should indicate that the Granger causality test performed on the route level does not support the hypothesis of\na two-way relationship between CAP and PASS revealing that passenger traffic does not Granger-cause capacity.\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\n89\n\nfindings obtained by Iatrou (2004), which pointed to a negative and\nstatistically significant price elasticity of demand for international passenger\ntraffic. One possible reason is that the price variable retained is a global one,\nthat is, one which measures the world trend of fares. Even if the fares listed\nin the ABC World Airways Guide had been used, there would have many\nchances that the same problem would have appeared, as Bissessur (1996)\nhad already pointed out, since these fares are not the actual fares passengers\nare required to pay owing to the widespread practice of discounting. As for\nthe hub-hub routes, one additional reason is that often they do not represent\nthe passengers\xe2\x80\x99 final destination but an intermediary point to their final\ndestination. In that case, the fares paid are those of the origin country and not\nthose of the hub country. This is certainly valid also for the hub-non hub\nroutes but not for the non hub-non hub routes.\nThe HHI variable introduced to measure the route specific competition\neffect on traffic does not appear to be a major determinant of passenger\ntraffic since it is significant for only 22 routes (17.7%). The estimated\ncoefficient is positive in all cases and lies between 0.05 and 0.5 except for\none route where it exceeds 1 (1.322). The competition measure has therefore\nthe expected sign indicating that low competition positively affects allied\nairlines traffic. HHI limited impact could be due in some extent to the\nlimited degree of competition which characterized the routes of our samples.\nThe coefficient for the dummy introduced in order to capture and\nneutralize the consequences of war or/and recession have the expected\nnegative sign in all the models it appears (42 routes, i.e., 33.9%). On\naverage, the coefficient lies between -0.012 and -0.098: this means that\nadverse events reduced traffic from 2.7% to 27.2%.\nAlliance Impact\nAs stated earlier, the alliance impact is given by the traffic variation\nobserved during the post-alliance period, when such variation cannot be\nattributed to non-alliance factors. So it is necessary to remove the RGDPPC\neffect in order to obtain this impact at least for those routes which are\naffected by RGDPPC. In a total of 124 routes, 61 were affected by both\nalliance and non-alliance factors (GDP). For the rest however, it can be\nsafely concluded that the change in traffic is mainly due to alliance\nstrategies. Table 2 presents the results for each global strategic alliance\nseparately.\n\n90\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nGlobal Impact\nAll in all, the impact of global strategic alliances is, on average,\nsignificant and positive. The computation gives an estimated passenger\nincrease of 9.4%, which implies an additional traffic of 1.5 millions (Table\n2). The main part of this effect appears however, by the second year of the\nalliance formation since in the first one the traffic increase is just 2.3%\ncompared with 6.9% for the second year (Table 3).\nTable 2: Traffic impact of airline alliance, for four major global strategic alliances as\nobserved in the second year after the alliance formation in relation to the pre-alliance\nperiod\nAlliance\n\nAdditional traffic (vol.)\n\nTraffic increase (%)\n\nSkyTeam\n\n227,694\n\n11.0%\n\nOneworld\n\n-62,875\n\n-3.4%\n\n1,272,787\n\n11.7%\n\nWings\n\n43,327\n\n4.6%\n\nTotal\n\n1,480,933\n\n9.4%\n\nStar Alliance\n\nTable 3: Traffic impact of airline alliances, for four major global strategic alliances,\nduring the post-alliance period of each alliance.

The lower impact as far as the\nformer alliance is concerned can be explained by the fact that the given\nstrategic alliance is made up of only two airlines, which cover mainly the\ntransatlantic area, and also by the fact that the sample is exclusively\ncomposed of hub-non hub routes since the hub-hub routes cooperation\n(Amsterdam-Detroit, Amsterdam-Minneapolis and Amsterdam-Memphis)\nbegan quite early, with the alliance formation (1993). The positive impact\nfound in the case of Wings hub-non hub routes should be stressed; this\nfinding shows that the strategic alliance has positive benefits for the entire\nflight network, and not only for hub-hub routes, and that the existence of\nantitrust immunity acts in that way. The negative impact as far as oneworld\nis concerned is due to several reasons. Two of the major members, American\nAirlines and British Airways, have not managed to extend their cooperation\nas they would have wished, as their proposed strategic cooperation has not\nbeen granted antitrust immunity by the US DOT for anticompetitive reasons.\nThis has excluded the possibility of any code share cooperation on the\ntransatlantic routes and between U.S. and European hubs. Besides, these two\nairlines were late in developing code share practices on behind-beyond\nflights. These facts have obviously affected in the same adverse way the\nother alliance members, since American Airlines and British Airways\nconstitute the main alliance decision makers\xe2\x80\x94it should not be forgotten that\nthese two airlines have a 10% stake in Iberia.\nOn the opposite side, the high alliance impact observed for Star Alliance\nseems to be due the existence of an extended network in which 17 airlines\nparticipate (October 2003), and to the antitrust immunity enjoyed by of the\ntwo core members of the alliance (Lufthansa and United Airlines). The same\nseems to be true in the case of SkyTeam since it presents an extended and\ncomplementary network. The positive results of SkyTeam can be attributed\nto: (a) the worldwide geographical coverage which Air France and Delta Air\nLines, the core members, offer; (b) the participation of two of the most\nefficient hubs (in Europe and in United States) in terms of traffic and\nconnections provided (Charles de Gaulle and Atlanta); and (c) the tighter\ncooperation adopted in 1998 after the signing of a new bilateral agreement\nbetween France and the U.S. (which provided for more flights connecting\nthe two countries).\nImpact during the Post-alliance Period\nA more in depth analysis of the alliance impact per period, as presented\nin Table 2, reveals that alliances have led to a reduction in traffic for both\n\n92\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nSkyTeam and Wings during the first year of the post-alliance period. This\nnegative impact can be attributed to the fact that the selected routes sampled\ninclude airlines which can be characterized as founding members: Air\nFrance, Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico for SkyTeam; KLM and Northwest\nAirlines for Wings. This tends to show that the alliance needs time to\nproduce any positive benefits in terms of higher traffic. Further, Air France\nand Delta Air Lines used to cooperate with other airlines before setting up\nSkyTeam. Delta Air Lines was a member of Atlantic Excellence having a\npartnership with Swissair. Thus, some time was certainly needed not only to\novercome the change of partner, but also to achieve network harmonization,\nto transfer Delta Air Lines European hub activities from Zurich to Paris, and\nfor Delta Air Lines passengers to get familiarized with the new partnerships.\nAdditionally, it is commonly acknowledged that a strategic alliance needs\nmore time to produce positive results than a simpler type of cooperation.\nAs far as Wings is concerned, the negative results might be due to\nNorthwest Airlines facing financial situation in that particular period and to\nthe exclusive analysis of hub-non hub routes.\nBy contrast, Star Alliance, which seems to be the most successful global\nalliance among the four considered here, presents a positive and gradually\nincreasing impact during the two years following the alliance formation:\n3.8% for the first year and 7.6% for the second one.\nImpact by Type of Routes\nOne would expect that hub-hub routes would have shown a larger\nimpact as one of the very aims of alliances is to forward a greater percentage\nof the allied partners\xe2\x80\x99 traffic through hubs. It seems that this is not the case\nsince an equivalent positive impact for hub-hub and hub-non hub routes is\nfound: 9.3% and 9.4%, respectively.14 Two reasons can explain this\nunexpected result. First, it can be explained by the existence of a large\nnumber of U.S. (New York, Dallas, Boston and Chicago, for example) and\nEuropean final and non-hub destinations, which can be reached directly\nwithout necessarily passing through hubs. Secondly, it can also be due to the\nfact that the hub-hub system needs time to function efficiently. The creation\nof a common network, pricing and scheduling policy as well as the\nharmonization of terminals and technology systems (for example, Computer\nReservation Systems), that would enable the partners to forward behindbeyond destinations passengers through their hubs, require certain time to be\nimplemented. In addition, certain hubs such as London-Heathrow and\nFrankfurt were already important business centers and had therefore\n\n14 In absolute numbers of course, the impact for hub-hub is twice as large as that for hub-non hub given their larger\ntraffic.\n\n93\n\nIatrou and Skourias\n\nsignificant traffic. In addition, these airports are seriously congested with\nlittle space for expansion.\nThe non hub-non hub routes present a positive increase in traffic, an\nincrease directly attributable to the alliance formation, but this result cannot\nbe considered a significant one, given the very limited number of routes (4)\nincluded in the sample studied.\nTable 4: Traffic impact of airline alliances, by type of routes\n\nType of route\n\n%\n\nHub-Hub\n\n9.3%\n\nHub-Non Hub\n\n9.4%\n\nNon Hub-Non Hub\n\n11.6%\n\nAlliances seem to have important spill over effects as they influence\npositively the allied airlines\xe2\x80\x99 traffic on their entire network.\nImpact by Type of Cooperation\nThe greater impact by far is brought about by strategic alliances with\nand without antitrust immunity: 14.6% and 9.8%, respectively. A strategic\nalliance with antitrust immunity presents a higher increase, since it enables\npartners to follow a common scheduling/pricing policy and to coordinate\nnetworks. This result confirms that the simple joining of a given alliance is\nnot sufficient by itself to lead to traffic improvement and that the tighter the\ncooperation, the higher the benefits enjoyed in terms of traffic.\nA quite surprising result is that of code share since the estimated\nincrease in traffic brought about by this type of cooperation is almost\ninsignificant (1.3%) and well below that of frequent flyer programs (FFP),\nthe simplest type of cooperation. This is entirely due to the negative impact\non Star Alliance code shared routes (-2.1% versus 7.6% for oneworld the\nother alliance for which code share routes are considered in the selected\nsample). The more plausible reason for this paradox is that the sample under\nexamination included routes on which there is virtually no competition, and\ntherefore there was no additional traffic to gain over from other competitors.\nFFP on the other hand, tends to register a more significant increase since the\ncustomers gain more tangible and immediate benefits from FFPs, such as\nmileage, than from code share.\n\n94\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\nTable 5: Traffic impact of airline alliances, by type of cooperation\nType of cooperation\n\n%\n\nFrequent Flier Programs\n\n4.6%\n\nCode share\n\n1.3%\n\nStrategic alliance without antitrust immunity\n\n9.8%\n\nStrategic alliance with antitrust immunity\n\n14.6%\n\nIn comparison with FFP, which is a cost-free and quickly-producing\nresults-type of cooperation, strategic alliances seem to present a more\npronounced positive impact in the second year of the post-alliance period,\nsince they obviously need more time to produce their benefits. This\nconclusion agrees with Gallacher\xe2\x80\x99s statement (1997) that FFPs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to\ninfluence business class travelers has made them more important to global\nalliances than code share.\nImpact by Route Distance\nAs expected, the largest impact is observed on long haul flights in\ncomparison with short haul ones15 (11.8% versus 7.4%) since a larger part of\npassengers with behind-beyond destinations prefers to travel with allied\nairlines which offer better scheduling and connection times. Another reason\ncontributing to this result might be the limited competition, which\ncharacterizes these types of routes, given the cooperation between allied\nairlines.\nHowever, the short haul routes present\xe2\x80\x94in the short term, and more\nparticularly in the first year of the post-alliance period\xe2\x80\x94a greater increase in\ntraffic since they constitute in many cases the final destinations of the\ntravelers or tourist or/and business centers especially in the case of Europe\n(Paris, London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt). By contrast, the greater impact\nfor long haul routes is observed during the second year of the post-alliance\nperiod, as the positive effect of tighter cooperation in an increased number of\nbehind-beyond destinations, network harmonization and the entrance of new\nairlines into the alliance.\n\n15 Long haul routes are the intercontinental (from to continent to continent) ones while short haul routes are those\neffected within the same continent.\n\n95\n\nIatrou and Skourias\nTable 6: Traffic impact of airline alliances, by distances of routes\nRoute distance\n\n%\n\nLong haul\n\n11.8%\n\nShort haul\n\n7.4%\n\nShort haul routes register a smaller traffic increase because these routes\npresent more options in terms of fares, face increased competition from lowcost airlines and alternative means of transport. On long haul routes\nhowever, allied partners put an emphasis as customers seek more benefits in\nterms of mileage and quality of service.\nCONCLUSION\nOn average, it seems that strategic alliances lead to a significant increase\nof traffic on alliance routes.\nAs expected, the alliance impact has been higher in the case of hub-hub\nroutes given the airlines\xe2\x80\x99 increased interest to serve behind-beyond\ndestination passengers through their hubs by the creation of an efficient huband-spoke system. Equally important is the finding that a similar increase,\neven though slightly lower, was observed for hub-non hub routes. This\nmeans that alliances tend to influence positively airlines\xe2\x80\x99 extended networks\nand not only their hub-hub routes.\nThe more strategic the cooperation among the allied partners, the greater\nthe impact, as this type of cooperation with the tighter links provides for\ncommon scheduling, pricing policy, etc.\nFurther, long haul routes lead to better results in terms of additional\ntraffic since the competition on those routes tends to be limited or even nonexistent, and since the partners tend to offer a worldwide coverage.\nHowever, any alliance impact seems to become apparent within two years\nafter the alliance formation.\nFinally, it is the global strategic alliances, which can be characterized by\na greater number of allied airlines and thus an extended network, by the\nexistence of antitrust immunity, at least between the core members, and by\nan efficient and productive hub-and-spoke system (Star Alliance and\nSkyTeam, for example) are the ones that tend to take more advantage of the\nalliance formation.\nThe above conclusions confirm those drawn by the recent surveys\nconducted by Iatrou and Alamdari (2003) and Iatrou (2004), which\ninterviewed a large number of carriers\xe2\x80\x99 executives of the four alliances\ninvolved. A quick comparison shows that global strategic alliances lead to an\n\n96\n\nJournal of Air Transportation\n\nincrease in traffic, all others things being equal, within the first two years\nafter the alliance formation, since 64% of the interviewees answered that the\nalliance impact on traffic exceeded 6%, while 43% of them has indicated that\nthis effect was apparent within the first two years of the alliance formation.\nWhile the survey showed that 50% of the interviewed airlines believed that\nthe impact is of the same range for each of the first two years of the postalliance period, according to the econometric analysis, it is in the second\nyear of the post-alliance that the alliance impact on traffic reaches its peak\nand it is double that observed during the first year.\nObviously, the above research could be extended and completed in\nmany ways to get a more accurate assessment of airline alliance effects on\ntraffic. First, the hypothesis considering real fares and capacities as alliance\nfactors should be relaxed given that they cannot be considered as totally\ndependent of alliances, and this is especially true as far as fares are\nconcerned. Secondly, a more accurate fare measurement should be taken into\naccount in order to capture the price effect on traffic, since it has been\nshown, at least on a global level, that traffic volume is negatively correlated\nto real fares (Iatrou, 2004). More specifically, a route level measure should\nbe retained as it was done in the research by Bissessur (1996). Thirdly, in\ntheory, non-alliance routes could be used to benchmark the alliance impact\nin a attempt aiming to measure true alliance traffic impact, so as to reach a\nmore reliable assessment. But such a comparison will be possible only in the\nfuture when new routes are introduced because there are practically no data\nabout the non-alliance routes to use for benchmarking purposes. Most likely,\nany new routes introduced in the future will follow the alliance/code share\npractice. Since partner airlines tend to feed domestic traffic onto their\nalliance routes and or reroute it through their alliance routes (Oum, Park &\nZhang, 2000; Park & Zhang, 1998), non-alliance routes traffic could decline\nand as a result the alliance impact could be lesser than that estimated.\nFinally, one should extend the analysis of the effects of complementary and\nparallel airline alliances on partner airlines\xe2\x80\x99 outputs in order to confirm the\nconclusion drawn by Oum, Park and Zhang (2000) and Park and Zhang\n(1998) according to which complementary alliances lead to a increase in\npartners\xe2\x80\x99 output while parallel ones lead, on the contrary, to a decrease in\npartners\xe2\x80\x99 output.\nREFERENCES\nBissessur, A., & Alamdari, F.
