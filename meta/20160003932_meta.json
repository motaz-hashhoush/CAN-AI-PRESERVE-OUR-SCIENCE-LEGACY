At the gathering, the participants first made a brief self-introduction regarding their background and research interests. Then they formed five groups to work on manuscripts. Furthermore, each new awardee was recognized with a certificate at the conference luncheon on July 6. In addition, the awardees attended a \"Student/Mentor Lunch\" on July 8 when the awardees (and other students) met with leading scientists. The awardees also attended a workshop on telecoupling on July 5. The awardees had a great time and were very productive at the conference, and many are continuing to collaborate on preparing manuscripts after the conference and preparing presentations for next year's meeting of US-IALE.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160003932, "id": "6a399d93cac842ab83a67b6d3547949a", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160003932.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160003932/downloads/20160003932.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160003932/downloads/20160003932.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160003932/downloads/20160003932.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
