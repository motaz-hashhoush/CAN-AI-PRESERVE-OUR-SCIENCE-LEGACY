The OSP System,\nformulated through rigorous requirements definition\nand decomposition, consists of spacecraft and launch\nvehicle flight elements, ground processing facilities and\nexisting transportation, launch complex, range, mission\ncontrol, weather, navigation, communication and\ntracking infrastructure. The concept of operations,\nincluding procurement, mission planning, launch\npreparation, launch and mission operations and vehicle\nmaintenance, repair and turnaround, is structured to\nmaximize flexibility and mission availability and\nminimize program life cycle cost. The approach to\nhuman rating and crew safety utilizes simplicity,\nperformance margin, redundancy, abort modes and\nescape modes to mitigate credible hazards that cannot\nbe designed out of the system.\n\n. THE ROLE OF THE ORBITAL SPACE PLANE\nPROGRAM IN THE NATIONAL HUMAN SPACE\nFLIGHT VISION\nSpace continues to capture the imagination of\ngovernments, industry and all humanity. I t holds the\npromise of boundless scientific discovery, exploration,\neconomic expansion and military dominance. At this\nmoment an orbiting laboratory is awaiting completion\nand research operations, the next generation space\nThis work is unclassified and publicly available. It\nwas performed under Contract No. NAS8-0 1098 as part\nof NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orbital Space Plane Program. Presented at\nthe International Air & Space Symposium and\nExposition, Dayton, Ohio 14-17 July 2003.\nAIAA Member, OSP Spacecraft System Design\nLead\nAIAA Member, OSP Operations Manager\nAIAA Member, OSP Spacecraft Manager\nAIAA Member, OSP Deputy Program Manager\n\n1\n\ntelescope is in design, crewed missions to the Moon\nand Mars are being planned and entrepreneurs are\nvying for a future space tourism market. The\ncornerstone of these missions and those not yet\nconceived is safe, reliable, affordable transportation\nbetween terra firma and low earth orbit. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nOrbital Space Plane (OSP) program, intended initially\nto service the International Space Station (ISS) more\nquickly, more safely and more affordably than current\nspace transportation systems, is also the next step to the\ngoal of routine space access. Lockheed Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\nmodular OSP System satisfies the immediate need for\ncrew rescue and transfer for ISS and, through planned\nupgrades and strategic spiral development, provides a\ngrowth path for future systems that accommodate the\nNation\xe2\x80\x99s evolving space transportation needs, enabling\nthe realization of the national human space flight\nvision.\n\nOSP SYSTEM REOUIREMENTS AND\nFUNCTIONALITY\nDesigned to transfer up to four (4) crew to and\nfrom low earth orbit, the Lockheed Martin OSP System\nenables space station complete operations as soon as\npractical by assuring safe, reliable and affordable\nhuman access to ISS and providing crew rescue for the\nUS segment crew complement. The System is also\ncapable of delivering limited contingency cargo in lieu\nof crew. The OSP will be significantly safer than\ncurrent space transportation systems, managing risk\nthrough hazard elimination and mitigation, performance\nmargin, redundancy and crew escape. Designed for\nsimplicity, autonomous operations, robustness and\noperability the OSP system will require less time and\nresources to design, prepare for and execute a mission,\nminimizing training and operations costs and thus life\ncycle cost. The Lockheed Martin OSP System is\ncomposed of spacecraft and launch vehicle flight\nsegments, ground processing and launch facilities and\nexisting communication and navigation infrastructure\nthat maximize current mission flexibility and supplies\nthe building blocks for accommodating evol vcd\nmissions at an affordable price. Lockheed Martin has\nembraced the government\xe2\x80\x99s System Design Philosophy,\nimplementing rigorous System Engineering processes\nto decompose and mature functional requirement \\,\nminimize interfaces and optimize the entire system.\n\nOSP SYSTEM DEFINITION\nThe OSP System includes all of the elements\nrequired to accomplish the crew transfer and rescue\nmissions and that contribute to the lifecycle cost of\nthose missions from the moment it is an idea until it is\nretired. The elements can be categorized as heritage\nsystems (ISS, ELV, eastern range, TDRSS, etc.),\nphysical objects (spacecraft, manufacturing facilities,\nsoftware, flight simulators, thermal vacuum test\nchamber, ground support equipment, commodities,\nshipping containers, etc.), human resources (managers,\nmission analysts, technicians, information technology\nsupport, skills instructors, grounds maintenance crews,\netc.), processes (engineering releases processes,\nnonconforming material control, component\nrefurbishment process, etc.) and information (I-loads,\naerodynamics database, component historical\nperformance, etc.). The summary of the OSP System is\ndepicted in Figure 1.\nThe OSP Program boundary delineates\nbetween the OSP unique system elements that must be\ndesigned and acquired by the OSP Program and\nexisting elements or stand-alone systems that are\nutilized to accomplish the OSP mission.\n\nInternational Space Station Program\nThe ISS Program is the primary OSP System\ncustomer and the source for key functionality and\ninterface requirements. The ISS configuration is\nassumed to be Core Complete with Node 3. The ISS\nProgram will plan the visiting vehicle traffic model,\nOSP mission manifest and mated operations. During\nproximity operations the ISS crew will monitor the\napproach and departure and have abort command\ncapability. While mated, the ISS will provide\ncommunication, navigation, power, thermal control and\natmospheric revitalization services to the OSP. The\nSpace Station Processing Facility (SSPF) will process\nISS payload items and all flight crew equipment such\nas suits, mission related tools and personal provisions.\nOSP Spacecraft. Ground Processing Facility\nand Transportation\nThe OSP spacecraft, composed of both\nreusable and expendable elements, contains all the crew\nescape, thermal protection, mechanisms, propulsion,\nflight control, navigation, communication, power,\natmospheric pressurization and revitalization, thermal\ncontrol and crew subsystems required to support the\ncrew and perform nominal and contingency transfer and\nCustomer I User I Stakeholder\nCommunity\n\nSafety, Affordability &\nOperations Cost Constraints\n\nSystem\n\nSystem\n\nManufacturing\nProcessing\n\n~\n\nO\n\nS Program\nP\n\nMission\nPlanning\nOSP\n\nRecovery\nMission\n\n'mponent\\\\ Mission\n\nJIMMoD1 I\nTrackina\n\nBusiness\n\ntElements to be designed I\nacquired by OSP Program.Also\nincluded human resource, process\nand information elements.\n\nLicensing Agencies\n\nFigure 1 OSP System Elements\n2\nA m p r i r a n Inctihitp\n\nnf\n\nA~rnnaiitirc\nand A c t m n a i i t i r c\n\nrescue flight operations.\nThe Space Port Florida Reusable Launch\nVehicle (SPFRLV) hangar at KSC is the baseline\nprocessing facility for the OSP spacecraft. It is of\nadequate size to support turnaround processing, planned\nmaintenance and overhaul for multiple vehicles. The\nprocessing floor measures 185\xe2\x80\x99w x 200\xe2\x80\x99d with the\naverage height of 30\xe2\x80\x99. The maximum height at the\ncenter is 60\xe2\x80\x99. Presently it has no major services in place\nexcept lighting and HVAC. There are stubs for power\nand communications. Additional personnel and support\nfacilities are required to process the OSP fleet. This\nhangar is conveniently located on the Shuttle Orbiter\ntow way near the south end of the 15,000 ft. runway of\nthe Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and can receive the\nmajor OSP flight elements for checkout, integration and\nservicing. The RLV hangar will contain all the\nnecessary handling GSE, work stands, local control\ncheckout equipment, power and communications\ninterface equipment and the allowed servicing\nequipment to support turnaround processing. Additional\nheritage facilities such as the Payload Hazardous\nServicing Facility and the Parachute Refurbishment\nFacility and ground support equipment such OMS/RCS\nservicing system, portable purge units, portable\nPRSD/fuel cell service cart and portable power units\nwill be utilized as required.\nAll flight elements of the OSP are transported\nfrom the factory and recovery sites to the SLF via C5 or\nC17 aircraft. Transport cradle and dollies serve as\nportable work stands for each element and allow for\nelevation alignment and rotation to the vertical for\nservicing. Once servicing is complete the dollies\nfacilitate integration of the OSP elements. After\nintegration a strongback assembly is attached along the\nsides of the completed OSP assembly and hoisted onto\nthe transport trailer, where is held securely in place by\ntrunnions for transport to the launch vehicle integration\nfacility.\nLaunch Services\nThe OSP spacecraft will initially be launched\non existing medium and heavy lift expendable launch\nsystems. The Government will procure launch services\nfrom one or more domestic launch service providers.\nThe launch service providers, Lockheed\nMartin and Boeing, will perform launch mission\nanalysis, integrate the OSP to the launch vehicle,\nperform system tests, conduct launch readiness reviews,\nconduct launch pad operations and perform countdown\nand launch procedures. They will monitor launch\nvehicle performance and record telemetry for post flight\nanalysis.\nThe OSP program goal is to minimize impacts\nto the commercial launch system and to capitalize on\nthe financial benefits that come from leveraging the\n\ncommercial infrastructure. However, some vehicle,\nprocess and facility modifications are required for\nhuman flight. Examples include the addition of IVHM\nand crew escape sensors to the launch vehicle, flight\nsafety reviews to preflight operations and a crew access\ntower to the launch complex.\nLaunch Range\nThe OSP System will utilize the existing\ninfrastructure and personnel at the US Air Force\nEastern Range.\nBusiness Operations. Mission Planning & Training\nThe OSP System will utilize existing business\noperations and mission planning organizations, such as\nthe Astronaut and Flight Surgeon Offices and the Flight\nDynamics Branch at the Johnson Space Center in\nHouston. Many exist training facilities such as the\nNeutral Buoyancy Laboratory, Remote Manipulator\nArm Training Facility, International Space Station\nSimulator and Hypobaric Chamber will be used for\nastronaut skills and proficiency training. In, addition,\nnew, OSP unique facilities, such as the OSP Single\nSystems Simulators, OSP Cockpit and Crew Habitat\nSimulator and Space Operations Simulator will be\nconstructed.\nMission Control\nOSP mission control will be coordinated from\nthe Mission Control and ISS Mission Control Centers\nlocated at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.\nNominal. Rescue and Escape Recoverv Infrastructure\nRecovery and turnaround facilities consist of\nnominal and emergency landing site locations and\nfacilities supporting vehicle maintenance and\nturnaround operations.\nThe OSP primary and secondary landing sites\nsupport all phases of final tracking, approach and\nlanding operations. The landing sites provide personnel,\nsupport facilities, OSP handling and transport\nequipment, safing & de-servicing GSE, portable power,\nenvironmental purge, communications, landing aids\nand fire/rescuc and medical support.\nSea. air and land based crew recovery teams\nwill be stationed strategically at existing coast guard\nand military installations along the ascent flight path.\nWeather. Navigation. Tracking. Communication and\nMMOD Systems\nHeritage National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration ground and space based weather\nsensing infrastructure and the National Weather Service\nforecast service will provide current and outlook\nweather forecasts at the launch facility, along the ascent\nand decent flight paths and at the primary and\n\n3\nA m P r i r a n I n c t i h i t e nf A p m n a i i t i ~ c\nanrl\n\nA\n\nctrnn,iiiticc\n\nsecondary landing sites. In addition, the Eastern Range\nwill collect day of launch wind data.\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) will\nprovide navigational data to the OSP while in orbital\nfree flight. Precise navigation during ISS docking/\nberthing and landing will be accomplished with\ndifferential GPS, radar, lidar and radio navigational\naids. Both existing ground and new space based options\nare being considered for ascent range tracking.\nCommunication and telemetry will be routed\nbetween the OSP and the Mission Control Center via\nand S-band RF link with the existing NASCOM and\nTDRSS infrastructure. In addition, UHF is available for\ncommunication between the OSP spacecraft and ISS\nwhile in close proximity.\nThe North American Aerospace Defense\nCommand will perform micrometeoroid and orbital\ndebris tracking and orbit propagation.\n\nOSP OPERATIONS\nGround Operations\nProcurement\nConstraining OSP integration operations to\nexisting expendable launch vehicle processes and\ninfrastructure result in a nominal order to launch time\nof 9-15 months. This time spans from mission\nprocurement through launch. However, the order to\nlaunch process may be minimized through\nimplementation of operational strategies that include\nlaunch vehicle block buy, a dedicated OSP integration\nfacility or maintaining a flight ready OSP and launch\nvehicle stack.\nMission Planning and Analysis\nOnce the OSP mission is identified and\nprocurement begun, detailed mission unique planning\nand analysis is performed.\nTo the greatest degree practical, the OSP System\nwill utilize performance margin, class analysis, mission\nflexibility and robustness to minimize the required\nmission unique analysis.\nRecovery. Turnaround and Cargo 0perations\nOSP ground and cargo operations consist of\ntwo types of operations; standard OSP and cargo\nturnaround maintenance and unplanned maintenance\noperations. The standard OSP mission turnaround\nbegins at vehicle touchdown where safing and recovery\noperations begin at the landing site. Once the flight\ncrew egresses the vehicle, the ground crew completes\nsafing operations and prepares the vehicle for transport\nto the SPFRLV Hanger. With the vehicle in the\nprocessing facility in its support stand/transport trailer,\nplanned and unplanned maintenance operations are\nperformed on the OSP. This includes subsystem deservicing where required by safety, removal of\n\nexpendable hardware, consumable replacement,\ninspection of the thermal control System (TPS) and\nsatisfaction of rolling maintenance requirements, such\nas batteries and pyrotechnic removal & replacement.\nAny unplanned maintenance that the IVHM system has\nidentified is scheduled to fit seamlessly into the\nstandard turnaround maintenance plan and the\nappropriate work authorizing documents are produced\nand released to the processing area for work. When\ncargo is flown in lieu of flight crew any down cargo or\ncargo accommodations hardware is removed and\nreturned to the SSPF for customer disposition.\nOnce all vehicle subsystem planned and\nunplanned maintenance work is complete early prelaunch stowage and servicing operations commence.\nAllowable hazardous servicing operations are\nperformed in the RLV hangar, such as battery\ninstallation and high pressure gas servicing, and those\nthat can\xe2\x80\x99t be performed there are performed in the\nHPSF or other NASA approved facility. Once servicing\nof storable commodities is complete, for example\nhypergolic propellant, high pressure GN2 & GHe, and\npotable water, etc., the vehicle undergoes final\nintegration in the RLV hangar where the escape\nsystems and launch vehicle adapter are installed. With\nthe OSP in configuration for launch vehicle integration,\nfinal stowage of crew related equipment and planned\ncargo items are accomplished.\nWith final closeouts and rollout readiness\nverified the vehicle is rolled out to the launch complex\nfor integrated operations that include erection, stacking\nand final checkout and servicing.\nIntegration and Launch Operations\nIntegration operations for the OSP start when\nthe standalone operations have been completed in the\nOSP hangar and the vehicle is ready for integration to\nits launch vehicle. The OSP design enables it to be\nlaunched on either an Atlas V from launch complex 41\nor the Delta IV from launch complex 37.\nIntegration at the launch sites can start when\nthe launch vehicle is assembled and the Launch Vehicle\nReadiness Tests (LVRT) are successfully completed.\nThese tests verify that the launch vehicle ground and\nairborne systems are compatible and capable of proper\nintegrated system operation. The launch vehicle is then\nprepared to accept the OSP.\nOSP mating to the launch vehicle occurs about\none week prior to launch. After arrival at the launch\ncomplex, the OSP is positioned for hoisting onto the\nlaunch vehicle. Environmental conditioning is\ntransferred from the portable unit used during transport\nto the launch complex source and is available during\nhoisting operations. A hoisting sling is fastened to the\nOSP assembly-lifting fixture and tie-downs to the OSP\nground transport vehicle are released. The OSP is then\n\n4\nA m ~ r i r o n\nlnrtihitp nf A p r n n a i i t i r r a n d A r t r n n a i 1 t ; r r\n\nlifted onto the launch vehicle. After mechanical\nattachment of the OSP to the launch vehicle, the lifting\nfixture is removed. Electrical connections between the\nOSP and the launch vehicle and the OSP and ground\nare mated to complete the operation.\nThe inter-vehicle connections include, power,\ncommand and communications.\nThere are two OSP to ground umbilicals, a\npre-launch and T-0. The pre-launch umbilical, utilized\nfor fuel cell loading operations, is fully automated\ncapability of retracting prior to T-0 and re-mate in the\nevent of a launch abort.\nThe T-0 umbilical, used to supply ATCS cooling\nand environmental purge, is retracted upon launch\ncommit.\nOSP operations after integration to the launch\nvehicle involve final installations of ordnance, escape\nmodule final preparations and late cargo stowage. Late\ncargo stowage will occur prior to the start of launch\noperations and start no later than T- 16 hours.\nPrior to entering launch operation final\nordnance installation and checkout is completed all\nGSE removed. An Integrated Vehicle Test (IVT) will\nbe performed to provide a launch readiness verification\nof the OSP, launch vehicle, ground and airborne\nsystems.\nThe launch operations timeline is similar to a\ncommercial launch. However, unique operations such\nas OSP fuels cell reacting loading and crew ingress will\nbe inserted.\nFuel cell reactant loading occurs within the\nexisting launch vehicle loading operations. The ingress\nof the crew will occur after the propellant loading has\ntransitioned into a replenish phase.\nNominal Crew Transfer and Rescue Vehicle Exchange\nFlight ODerations\nThe flight operations profile for nominal\ntransfer and rescue vehicle exchange missions are\nsimilar. Both can be a flown with any complement of\ncrew and cargo.\nTerminal Count Down\nTerminal launch countdown begins once the\ncloseout crew has cleared the pad. Thc access platform\nis retracted and the OSP and the launch vehicle execute\nautomated system checks and are configured for launch.\nThe range, launch and mission control teams verify\nlaunch readiness status.\nLaunch\nAt launch commit, the launch conductor\nimitates the booster engine auto start sequence. Once\nonboard sensors indicate the engines have achieved full\nthrust, the launch vehicle propellant and power\n\n5\n\numbilicals are retracted and the hold down mechanism\nis released. The launch vehicle guidance flies a\npreprogrammed ascent trajectory, adjusting for off\nnominal wind conditions, while the OSP and mission\ncontrol passively monitor launch vehicle performance,\nattitude, rates and system status. Upon exhaustion of\nbooster propellants, the booster engines shut down, the\nbooster separates from the stack and the upper stage\nengine ignites. Once upper stage engine nominal steady\nstate operation is confirmed the launch escape solid\nrocket motors are jettisoned. The upper stage closed\nloop guidance then flies the OSP to the planned low\nearth orbit insertion point, performing multiple burns\nand coasts as required. After upper stage engine cutoff\nthe upper stage holds its attitude while the OSP initiates\nspacecraft separation and performs a collision\navoidance maneuver.\nOrbit Transfer and Phasing\nWhen clear of the upper stage the spacecraft\nperforms orbit transfer and ISS phasing maneuvers. The\nOSP subsystems are sized such that power and thermal\ncontrol maneuvers are not required. At the same time\nthe upper stage performs a disposal burn, reenters and\nbreaks up over an ocean. At a convenient point in the\nmission timeline, the crew can doff their launch entry\nsuits, eat and rest.\n\nISS Rendezvous and Arrival Proximitv\nOperations\nWithin 2 days of launch, the OSP rendezvous\nwith the ISS outside the Approach Ellipsoid (AE), such\nthat a free drift trajectory will not intercept the ISS\ntrajectory in fewer than 24 hours. Upon receiving\nauthorization from ISS crew, the OSP enters the AE,\nintercepting the preprogrammed approach corridor\ncentered on the dockingherthing port outside the Keep\nOut Sphere (KOS). The OSP then either docks to or is\ncaptured by the ISS Mobile Servicing System\n(ISSMSS) and berthed to ISS. Both the arriving and\ndeparting OSP will remain mated to ISS while the crew\nrotation and cargo exchange is completed.\nMated Operations\nAfter hard dock is established, the access\ntunnel is pressurized and a leak check is performed, the\nOSP and ISS hatches are opened. Communication,\ntelemetry, power, thermal control coolant loop and\natmosphere revitalization umbilicals are then\nconnected. Non-critical avionics, power and lifesupport systems are shut down and the OSP is\nconfigured in mated standby mode. OSP can remain\nquiescent mode for up to 180 days or until required for\ncrew\ne x c h a n g e or\nrescue\nfrom\nISS.\n\nI\n\n.\n\nCrew & Cargo Exchange\nISS cargo and crew personal effects are\ntransferred from the OSP and stored on Space Station.\nIn addition, scientific or high value cargo that is to\naccompany the ISS crew completing their deployment\nto earth is stowed on board the departing OSP. ISS\nchange of command and experiment responsibility\nhandoff occurs following a status briefing. Periodically,\nwhile attached to ISS, the OSP is powered up\ntemporarily for system diagnostic and checkout.\nOSP De-mate. Deoarture Proximity\nOperations and Deorbit\nUpon the decision to depart ISS the crew don\ntheir launch entry suits, ingress the OSP, shut the ISS\nand OSP hatches and perform hatch leak checks. The\nOSP crew then powers up the dormant systems, uploads\nfinal flight data package and landing site weather data,\nestablishes navigational state and communication links,\nconfigures vehicle for departure and performs system\nhealth checks. When ready, the access tunnel is\ndepressurized, the OSP separates and exits the approach\nellipsoid. Prior to reentry, while awaiting the alignment\nof the spacecraft ground track with the landing site, the\ncrew conducts thermal control procedures to cold soak\nthe radiators and thermal protection system. At the start\nof the reentry window, a direct deorbit bum is initiated.\nLanding and Recovery\nUpon entry interface the OSP performs a\nreentry and is recovered at the primary landing site\nwithin 24 hours of separation from ISS. Once the OSP\nis safed by the recovery team, the deconditioned crew\negress the vehicle via the access hatch and are attended\nto by recovery team physicians. Time critical payload is\nremoved and transported to the SSPF for post flight\nprocessing and returned to the payload principle\ninvestigator. The OSP is hoisted onto the transport\nfixture and trucked back to the SPFRLV hanger for\nrefurbishment.\nRescue. Abort and Escape Flight Operations\nIn general, the OSP system design philosophy\nof hazard elimination, performance margin, redundancy\nand graceful degradation mitigates the consequences of\nsystem failures. However, abort and escape options are\nprovided for all flight regimes that have credible failure\nmodes for which recovery is not possible.\nLaunch Pad Abort\nIn the event that a hazardous condition arises\nat the launch complex prior to launch commit, OSP\ncrew and launch vehicle closeout crew can\nexpeditiously evacuate the area via the launch complex\nemergency evacuation system. The launch vehicle and\nOSP are safed from the launch control center.\n\nLaunch Pad Escape\nIf the hazard arises after crew cabin closeout\nand the crew cannot exit the spacecraft safety a pad\nescape is commanded by the crew, mission control,\nlaunch control or the automated escape initiation\nsystem. The separation mechanism ensures positive\nclearance between the OSP and launch vehicle. After\nescape motor bum out and coast, parachutes and impact\nattenuation airbags deploy. Additionally, if wind\nconditions result in a water landing, float bags are\ninflated to ensure the OSP remains buoyant and floats\nupright. Fire and rescue crews respond immediately to\nrecover the crew. It is understood that execution of a\nlaunch pad escape may result in the destruction of the\nlaunch vehicle and launch complex.\nAscent Escape\nIf the launch vehicle does not impart enough\nenergy for the OSP to achieve orbit or ascent abort, or\nin the event a catastrophic launch vehicle structural\nfailure or loss of control an ascent escape is\ncommanded by the crew, mission control, launch\ncontrol or the automated escape initiation system. The\nevent timeline for ascent escape, initiated during boost\nphase, is similar to a launch pad escape. However, prior\nto separation the OSP commands thrust termination.\nAlso, dependent on OSP state at escape initiation, exoatmospheric coast and atmospheric reentry occur prior\nto drogue and main chute deployment. OSP escape\ninstantaneous impact point crosses the Atlantic Ocean,\nEurope, the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian Ocean.\nThe nearest sea, air or land based recovery team is\ndeployed to recover the crew. Survival equipment is\nprovided for the crew until the recovery team arrives.\n\nISS Approach Abort\nWhile inside the ISS AE, the OSP provides\nsystem status and relative state data to the ISS. OSP\ncrew, space station crew and mission control crew\nmonitors the approach and has the capability to\ncommand an abort. Collision Avoidance Maneuvers\n(CAM) initiated within the KOS will begin with by\nestablishing a positive opening rate and a CAM\ninitiated within the AE will exit the AE in fewer than\n90 minutes. If an approach abort is executed the OSP\nmoves to a predetermined safe hold point to await\nanomaly resolution and approach resumption. The OSP\nis capable of maintaining a contingency hold for up to\n34 hours. The OSP is capable of two approach\nattempts. After the second failure the OSP departs ISS\nand returns to the nominal landing site.\n\nISS Crew Rescue\nThere are two OSP crew rescue operational\nscenarios. The first requires immediate departure from\n\n6\nA m r r i r a n l n c t i t i i t p nf A m - n n a i i t i r r anrl A r t r n n a i i t i c c\n\nthe ISS, while the second requires timely, but not\nemergent return to earth. Example events that could\nprecipitate an immediate evacuation of ISS include\ncatastrophic station depressurization, atmospheric\ncontamination, fire or loss of control. In these scenarios\nthe ISS crew quickly enters the OSP and isolates its\nenvironment from that of the ISS. An abbreviated\npower up and departure checklist is performed and the\nOSP the separates from the ISS and maneuvers to a safe\nposition. While the ISS Mission Control Center\nattempts to reestablish a safe environment on ISS, the\nOSP crew can complete the departure sequence, system\nhealth checks, verify landing site availability and\nperform landing site phasing. If space station control is\nreestablished then the OSP can return the crew to ISS.\nOtherwise, the space station crew can abandon ISS and\nreturn to earth at the primary landing site or one.of the\ncontingency landing sites.\nExample events that require timely departure\nfrom ISS include crew illness or non-catastrophic, but\nnot recoverable ISS system failure. Crew rescue from\nISS system failures imply that the OSP must be able to\nperform the separation and departure without support\nfrom the International Space Station, including\nnavigational state information. In these scenarios, the\ndeparting ISS personnel don their launch injury suits,\ningress the OSP and begin the departure checklist. The\nOSP phases with the landing site while mated to ISS,\ninitiating separation as dictated by the return mission\ntime line, included in the flight data package upload.\nConsideration of contingency landing sites at\nEdwards, Minot and Malstrom Air Force bases i n\naddition to the primary landing site in Avon Park,\nFlorida assure crew rescue can be accomplished in\nsignificantly less than the required 24 hours.\nLandinP Site Weather Continpency\nThe Lockheed Martin OSP spacecraft includes\nadditional contingency power and atmospheric\nrevitalization consumables. The mission duration\nmargin enables more than one opportunity for landing\nat the primary recovery site to allow for unexpected\nweather changes before requiring the OSP return to a\ncontingency landing site.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Lockheed Martin OSP concept of\noperations and robust, comprehensive system design\nprovide safe, reliable and affordable access to the ISS\nand builds the space transportation foundation for\nfuture human space flight missions.\n\n7\nA m ~ r i r a n\nInrtihitp n f A ~ r n n a i i t i ra~ d\nn\n\nA\n\nctrnnaiiticr\n\n"
