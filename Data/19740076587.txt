Schade\n\nResearch\n\nCenter\n\nSUMMARY\nf\n\nL\n1\n\n4\n1\n\nA study has been made to determine the basic phenomena associated\nwith the ground interference effects for VTOL aircraft in an attempt to\narrive at some generalized conclusions regarding the effect of the\nground on the various types of VTOL aircraft.\n\n6\nThe results showed that helicopter and other rotor aircraft generally experience favorable ground effect.\nIn the case of propeller VTOL\naircraft the tilt-wing configurations\nwill usually experience a small\nfavorable ground effect.\nFor the deflected-slipstream\nconfigurations\na large detrimental\nground effect is experienced at low angles of attack\nof the thrust axis but little or no ground effect at angles of attack\nof 25 \xc2\xb0 or 30 \xc2\xb0. For buried-fan and Jet configurations\nthe ground effect\ncan be favorable or unfavorable\ndepending upon the geometry of the fans\nor Jets and the airframe.\nFor single-Jet configurations\nthe ground\neffects are detrimental\nand cannot be eliminated by fixes on the airplane.\nFor these cases, a perforated\nlanding platform appears to offer promise\nas a means of minimizing the adverse ground effect.\nGround effects\nexperienced\nin hovering flight tend to decrease with increasing forward\nspeed and are rather small at airspeeds that might be of interest for\nSTOL operation of the various VTOL configurations.\nThe qualitative\npredictions\nof the ground effect for various VTOL aircraft configurations can be made with a fair degree of confidence, but it appears at\nthe present time that the magnitude of the effect for specific configurations will usually have to be obtained from test data.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGround interference effects have not proved to be very significant\nfor conventional\nairplanes but they have assumed major importance for\nVTOL aircraft because the slipstream or Jet exhaust is directed straight\ndown for vertical take-off and landing.\nThese ground interference\neffects can be either favorable or unfavorable depending upon the\nconfiguration.\nIt is the purpose of this paper\nfor all types of VTOI, aircraft, with\n\nto cover ground interference effects\ndescriptions of the phenomena\n\nPreceding blank\npage\n\n88\n\ninvolved and indications of possible means\ninterference effects where they exist.\n\nof minimizing\n\nthe unfavorable\n\nIt should be pointed out that the term "ground interference effects"\nused in this paper refers to the effect of the ground on the aerodynamics\nof the aircraft.\nOther effects of the slipstream impingement, such as\nground erosion, recirculatlon\nof dust and debris, and effects on objects\nsurrounding the landing area are covered in the paper by Thomas C. 0\'Bryan.\nThe ground interference effects discussed in this paper can be\nbroken down into two parts:\nthe effect on the thrust of the propulsion\nsource itself and the effect on the airframe.\nBasic phenomena associated with these two kinds of interference are indicated and experimental data for various VTOL configurations\nare presented.\nSome indication of the particular\ninterference effect involved in each case is\ngiven.\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nD\n\ndiameter\n\nh\n\nheight\n\nL\n\nlift\n\nL_\n\nlift at infinite\n\nM_\n\nvariation\n\nof pitching\n\npropeller\n\nblade\n\neT\n\nangle\n\nof thrust\n\nGROUND\n\ndistance\n\nabove\n\nmoment\n\nground\n\nwith\n\nangle\n\nof attack\n\nangle\nline\n\nEFFECT\n\nON PROPULSION\n\nSOURCE\n\nFigure 1 shows the lift augmentation of propellers and rotors.\nThe\nsketch in the figure indicates that as the rotor approaches the ground\nthe slipstream fans out; the result is an increase in pressure and a\ndecrease in velocity in the slipstream.\nThis change causes the wellknown increase in lift on the rotor as it approaches the ground.\nA\ntypical variation of lift augmentation for a propeller or rotor is\nshown by the curve in figure 1. The term\nL/L_\nis the ratio of the\namount\nk_/\n\nof lift\n\nin ground\n\neffect\n\nto that out of ground\n\neffect.\n\n(Values\n\nL\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n6\n\nZ--.\n\n_\n\n-_\n\n89\n_..j\n\nabove 1.0 indicate favorable ground effect. ) The ratio\nheight above the ground divided by the diameter.\n\nh/D\n\nis the\n\nFor Jet engines there is a similar flow which also spreads out as\nthe ground is approachedj but in this case an increase in lift is not\nobtained.\nIn fact, a decrease in lift or thrust might be experienced\nbecause the increased pressure in the jet exhaust results in back pressure on the engine.\nHowever, this effect for a Jet is not a significant\none because the tail pipes of Jets are usually not very close to the\nground in terms of tail-plpe diameter.\nL\n1\n\n4\n1\n\n6\n\nFigure 2 shows the effect of the ground on a ducted fan with two\ndifferent blade angles.\nWhen the blade angle is set for optimum efficiency in hovering out of ground effect, there is a loss in lift as the\nground is approached.\nThis detrimental\nground effect is attributed to\nthe fact that the higher disk loadings associated with ducted fans\nrequire higher blade angles, and there is a tendency for the blades to\nstall as the ground is approached.\nThis stalling tendency can be reduced\nby using lower blade angles, and if the blade angle is reduced to a\nvery low value, a favorable ground effect can be obtained as indicated\nby the top curve.\nOf course, it must be realized that this change from\nan unfavorable to a favorable ground effect is accomplished at the expense\nof some hovering efficiency out of ground effect.\n\nEFFECT OF SLIPSTREAM\n\nTwo-Dimensional\n\nON AIRFRAME\n\nPatterns\n\nThe upper sketches of figure 3 illustrate the two basic flow patterns resulting from different arrangements of slipstreams with respect\nto airframe surfaces.\nThe two lower sketches show a vertical cross\nsection through the slipstream.\nThe induced pressures resulting from\nthe two flow patterns are shown by the symbols\n+ and\nindicating\npositive and negative changes in pressure, respectively.\nAt the lefthand side of the figure the case of a single slipstream emerging from\nthe bottom of a surface is shown.\nThere is an induced flow around the\nedges and under the surface as indicated by the broken lines; this\nflow results in a decreased pressure and therefore an unfavorable ground\neffect.\nAt the right-hand side the case of two slipstreams at the edge\nof a surface is shown. In this case the flow pattern is upward in the\nmiddle resulting in increased pressure on the surface between the slipstreams and thus in a favorable ground effect.\nWith actual airplane configurations,\nof course, there are variations and combinations of these two basic flow patterns.\nFor example,\nif two Jets are exhausting from some intermediate positions there will\n\n9O\n\nbe both positive\nand negative\ninduced\npressures,\ncan be either\nfavorable\nor adverse\ndepending\non\nsurface\n\narea\n\nis\n\nbetween\n\nthe\n\nand the\nhow much\n\nground\nof the\n\neffect\ntotal\n\nJets.\n\nThree-Dimensional\nFigure\n4 shows a three-dimensional\npropeller\ntilt-wing\nconfiguration\nwith\nthe slipstreams\nfrom the two propellers,\n\nPattern\nslipstream\npattern\nfor a twothe two columns,\nwhich\nrepresent\ncoming\ndown and striking\nthe\n\nground.\nThe lines with arrows\nindicate\nslipstream\nfilaments\nas they\nflow radially\noutward.\nBecause\nthere\nis an equal and opposite\nflow\nalong\nthe ground\nat the plane of symmetry,\nthe plane of symmetry\neffectively\nserves\nas a solid wall through\nwhich no flow can pass.\nSince\nthe slipstream\nfilaments\ncannot\nflow through\nthe plane of symmetry_\nthe\nslipstream\nmust flow upward.\nThis flow is straight\nupward\ndirectly\nbetween\nthe propellers\nbut goes upward\nat progressively\nsmaller\nangles\nat greater\ndistances\nahead of and behind\nthe propellers.\nThis causes\nground\neffect\nnot only on surfaces\nbetween\nsurfaces\nall along the plane of symmetry.\nthis discussion\nconcerns\nonly the idealized\nfectly\nsymmetrical\nand steady.\nrecirculation\nis likely\nto be\n\nOf\nboth\n\nlarly when flying\nin gusty air\naircraft\nis banked,\nthe upward\n\nthe propellers\nbut also\nIt should\nbe emphasized\ncase where the flow is\n\non\nthat\nper-\n\ncourse,\nin the practical\ncase the\nunsymmetrical\nand unsteady\nparticu-\n\nand over uneven\nflow instead\nof\n\nterrain.\nbeing\nin\n\nAlso, if\nthe plane\n\nthe\nof\n\nsymmetry\nas shown here moves\nout along the span in the direction\nof the\nupgoing\nwing.\nThe flow in these cases\nleads to random\ndisturbances\nof\nthe aircraft\nwhich\ncan result\nin poor handling\nqualities\nwhen the aircraft\nis flying\nnear the ground.\nThis effect\non handling\nqualities\nis\ndiscussed\nRobert\nJ.\n\nin the papers\nby John P.

For the case of the wing and fans alone there is a detrimental ground effect shownby the lower curve. This effect apparently\nresults from a negative pressure buildup under the outboard portion of the\nwing that is greater than the positive pressure buildup between the fans.\nThe magnitude of this effect will, of course, vary with wing and/fan\ngeometries. The upper curve shows that a beneficia/ effect can be\nobtained by adding a fuselage below the wing. In this case the effect\nis rather large at the low values of h/D because the fuselage is flat\nand is almost touching the ground. It may be noted that the reversal\nin the slope of the upper curve indicates an unstable variation of power\nwith height which would make it difficult\nfor a pilot to maintain constant altitude when flying at this height.\nOf course, this samesituation exists for all heights when the ground effect is adverse.\nMULTIPLE-JET\nCONFIGURATIONS\nShownin figure 9 is the effect of the ground on multiple-Jet configurations.\nFor the two-Jet arrangement there is a detrimental ground\neffect, shownbythe long-dashed line. When four vertical fences are\nplaced along the fuselage between the Jets to form an open-bottom box\nto trap the recirculated Jet exhaust, a beneficial ground effect is\nobtained but there is still\nsomeadverse ground effect at the intermediate heights.\nWith the four-Jet configuration there is only a small negative\nground effect.\nIn this case, more of the Jet exhaust is trapped between\nthe Jets resulting in a greater buildup of pressure in this region which\nalmost balances out the losses caused by negative pressure under the\nremainder of the airframe.\nIf this approach is followed to the extreme\nand if Jets are placed all around the perimeter of the airframe, it is\npossible to end up with a very beneficial ground effect as has been\nshown in work with ground-effect machines. Incidentally,\nan attempt is\nbeing madeto take advantage of this principle in the GETOL,groundeffect take-off and landing, machines currently being studied.\nSINGI_ JET CONFIGURATIONS\nIn figure i0 the effect of the ground on slngle-Jet conflgurationa\nis shown. For the research model as shown by the dashed curve there is\n\n[\n\nJM.\n\n93\n\nnegative\nground\neffect\nbecause\nof the negative\npressure\nproduced\nunder\nthe airframe\nby the s_ngle\njet.\nA similar\neffect\nwas obtained\non the\nBell X-14 as shown by the solid line.\nAttempts\nto minimize\nthis negative\neffect\nby fixes on the aircraft\nitself\nhave not been too successful.\nFor\n\n1\n\nthe Bell X-14,\nsome improvement\nwas obtained\nby lengthening\nthe landing\ngear and effectively\nmoving\nup along the curve.\nAnother\nmethod\nproposed\nfor minimizing\nthe adverse\nground\neffect\nof jet configurations\nis the use\nof a perforated\nlanding\nplatform\na short distance\nabove the ground.\nThe\nprincipal\neffect\nof the perforated\nplate\nis to provide\na bar_ier\nbetween\nthe high-energy\nJet exhaust\nwhich flows along the ground\nand the air above\nthat it tries to entrain.\nThis method\nreduces\nthe induced\nnegative\nlift.\nWith the use of this perforated\nplate on the research\nmodel the losses\n\n4\n\nare\n\nL\n\nreduced\n\nto\n\nalmost\n\nzero\n\nfor\n\nnormal\n\nlanding-gear\n\nheights.\n\n1\n\n6\nEFFECT\n\nThe\n\nOF\n\nFORWARD\n\nSo

deflected-Jet\nconfiguration\nwith\nits unfavorable\nground\neffect,\nand for a deflected-slipstream\nconfiguration in the condition\nin which\nit experiences\nthe most unfavorable\nground\neffect\n- that is, at an angle of the thrust\nline of 0 \xc2\xb0.\nAs discussed\npreviously,\nthis large unfavorable\nground\neffect\nwith the deflectedslipstream\nconfiguration\nin hovering\ncan be eliminated\nby increasing\nthe angle of the thrust\nline.\nThis case is used only to illustrate\nthe\neffect\nof forward\nspeed on a very large detrimental\nground\neffect.\nThe\ndata were obtained\nunder conditions\ncorresponding\nto a running\ntake-off\nthat is, with the wheels\non the ground.\nThis information\nis therefore\napplicable\nto short take-off\nand landing,\nor STOL, operation.\nThe main\npoint\nto be obtained\nfrom this figure\nis that the ground\neffects,\nboth\nfavorable\nand unfavorable,\ngenerally\ntend to disappear\nas forward\nspeed\nis increased\nand are rather\nsmall for airspeeds\nthat might be of interest\nfor STOL operation\nwith the various\nconfigurations.\n\nCONCLUDING\n\nthe\n\nFrom a study of ground\ninterference\nfollowing\nconclusions\nwere

propeller VTOL aircraft the tilt-wing configurations\nusually\nexperience a small favorable ground effect.\nFor th_ deflected-slipstream\nconfigurations\na large detrimental ground effect is experienced\nat low\nangles of the thrust line but little or no ground effect is experienced\nat angles of 2_\xc2\xb0 or 50 \xc2\xb0.\nFor buried-fan and Jet configurations\nthe ground effect can be\nfavorable or unfavorable depending upon the geometry of the fans or Jets\nand of the airframe,\nf\nFor single-Jet configurations\nthe ground effects are detrimental\nand\ncannot be eliminated by fixes on the airplane.\nFor this case, a perforated landing platform appears to offer promise as a means of minimizing\nthe adverse ground effect.\nGround effects experienced\nin hovering flight tend to decrease with\nincreasing forward speed and are rather small at airspeeds that might be\nof interest for STOL operation of the various VTOL configurations.\nAnd, finally, although the qualitative predictions of the ground\neffect for various VTOL aircraft configurations\ncan be made with a fair\ndegree of confidence,\nthe magnitude of the effect for a specific configuration will generally have to be obtained from test data.\n\nL\n1\n\n4\n1\n6\n\n15A\n\nLIFT\n\nAUGMENTATION\n\nOF
