Improved components are required to properly\nutilize the wide bandwidth allocated for IntersatelUte link applications\naround 60 GHz. IMPATT diodes offer the highest potential performance as solidstate power sources for a 60 GHz transmitter. Presently available devices do\nnot have the desired power and efficiency. High efficiency, high power IMPATT\ndiodes for IntersatelUte link applications are being developed by NASA and\nother government agencies. This paper describes the development of high effl.dency 60 GHz IMPATT diodes by NASA. These programs are cofunded by the U.S.\nAir Force, Space Division.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs satellite systems grow In capacity and complexity, IntersatelUte communication links are expected to play an Increasingly significant role. The\nNASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) has S-band and Ku-band\nIntersatelUte links with low earth orbiting spacecraft as part of Its operational capability. Future NASA, military, and commercial spacecraft will\nrequire high data rate systems. Nearly 10 GHz of bandwidth Is presently\nallocated around 60 GHz (V-band) for IntersatelUte link applications. In\norder to effectively utilize this resource, electronic components must be\ndeveloped for Integration Into systems. This paper addresses the development\nof one of those components, namely, an efficient solid-state source of rf power\nat 60 GHz.\nOf the presently known sol Id-state devices, the IMPATT diode Is the leader\n1n both theoretical and achieved power from 10 to 300 GHz. The output power\nvaries as 1/f at lower frequencies due to thermal limitations and then drops\noff as 1/f2 or faster at mm-wave frequencies. This may be seen In figure 1\nwhere recent results of Si and GaAs devices are compared (ref. 1). It Is seen\nthat GaAs has a performance advantage 1n both power and efficiency below 50\nGHz with Si having a large advantage at 94 GHz and above. The nature of the\ndegradation observed in GaAs at higher frequencies is uncertain and Is presently under debate. However, very recent work at 60 GHz has decreased the\nperformance difference and indicates that GaAs 1s likely to have higher power\nand efficiency than S1, notwithstanding ongoing work in Si technology. Work\nat 94 GHz should also be very Interesting with regard to the status of mm-wave\nperformance of GaAs.\nNASA Lewis is currently sponsoring two development contracts for a one\nwatt, 15 percent efficient, high reliability 60 GHz IMPATT diode as shown In\ntable 1. The contractors are Hughes Aircraft Company, Electron Dynamics\n\nDivision, Torrance, California, and M/A-COM, Gallium Arsenide Products Inc.,\nBurlington, Massachusetts. Each contractor has chosen GaAs as the active\nmaterial and Is utilizing large signal (nonlinear) computer design techniques.\nFor material growth, Hughes Is using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) whereas M/ACOM 1s using Organo-MetalUc Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). These advanced\nmaterial growth techniques are necessary due to the high frequency and high\nperformance goals of the program. Each contractor Is utilizing diamond heat\nsink (DHS) technology due to stringent thermal requirements. After a brief\nreview of IMPATT operation, the current status of these programs will be discussed In detail.\n60 GHz IMPATT OVERVIEW\n\nIMPATT oscillations were first discovered 1n 1965. The field 1s mature\nand also very active (ref. 2). Present work 1s largely Involved with Improvements In performance through refinements In design, material growth, and processing. The physical picture of the rf power generation 1s straightforward.\nA pn junction diode 1s reverse biased near breakdown. An rf voltage 1s\napplied to the diode. During the half cycle when the rf voltage adds to the\ndc voltage, electron-hole pairs are created by avalanche Impact lonlzatlon In\nthe avalanche region around the junction. Due to the mechanics of this generation process, the maximum charge pulse occurs when the rf voltage has decreased to zero. This Introduces a 90\xc2\xb0 phase delay between the rf voltage and\nthe pulse of charge. The charge pulses then drift toward the diode contact\nareas. The electrons drift In the n region and the holes 1n the p region,\nInducing an external current. During this portion of the rf cycle, the rf\nvoltage has the opposite sense to the dc voltage. If the diode Is designed so\nthat the time of transit of the charge pulses 1s equal to one-half of the rf\ncycle, an additional 90\xc2\xb0 phase delay 1s Introduced. The situation Is that\nthere Is nearly zero current during the positive half of the rf cycle and\npositive carrier flow against a negative rf voltage 1n the second half of the\ncycle, thus generating rf power. For high efficiency and high power, one needs\nto generate as large a charge pulse as possible while maintaining the proper\nphase relations between current and voltage and also achieving the necessary\nImpedance and thermal values.\nAn example of a 60 GHz GaAs IMPATT diode design will be given. This\ndesign was generated and analyzed by Mains and Haddad (ref. 3) of the University of Michigan through the use of their large signal (nonlinear) computer\nsimulation program. The doping profile Is shown 1n figure 2 and the physical\nand operating characteristics are listed In table 2. The profile shown Is a\nhybrid double-drift profile which means that both the p and n material\nhave drift regions and that the n material also has a higher doped region at\nthe pn junction to confine the avalanche. There are several features to be\nnoted. The doping profile requires several sharp changes In a distance of\nless than 1 ym. Nonabrupt doping changes and nonunlform doping within layers\nare known to degrade efficiency. Thus, stringent requirements are placed on\nthe material growth process. The physical size of the diode Is small and the\ncurrent density 1s large. This places demands on the entire processing and\nfabrication sequence. The thermal resistance 1s calculated assuming that a\ndiamond heat sink 1s used, that there 1s a minimum of material between the\njunction and the heat sink, and that there 1s no extra thermal resistance from\npoor processing. This means that a reliable diamond heat sink technology 1s\nnecessary. Finally, the negative resistance of 1 ohm and capacltlve reactance\n\nof 11 ohms are about the minimum values which may be matched Into rf circuitry.\nThis design was based on the drift-diffusion model of carrier transport 1n a\nsemiconductor. Using a more realistic energy and momentum relaxation model,\nrelaxation effects which occur on the picosecond time scale may be Important\nand may change the design features to some degree (ref. 4).\nHUGHES APPROACH\n\nIn order to achieve the goals listed 1n table 1, Hughes has chosen GaAs\nusing MBE as their primary material growth approach with conventional Vapor\nPhase Epitaxy (VPE) as a backup. The high frequency and high power goals\nrequire several sharp doping changes In a distance less than 1 pm. The high\nefficiency goal requires that these doping changes be sharp and that doping\nwithin each region be very uniform. From an analysis of large signal computer\nsimulations, Hughes has chosen the double-drift hybrid profile. A recent\nSecondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis of this profile which was grown\nusing MBE by Perkln-Elmer Corp. 1s shown In figure 3. The sharp transitions\nand excellent uniformity within the layers may be seen. The transitions from\none doping level to another take place 1n approximately 200 A distance and this\nshould be sufficient for this program. A portion of this apparent transition\nwidth 1s due to Instrumental rounding 1n the SIMS analysis. Double-drift flat\nprofiles have also been grown but have not performed as well. Single-drift\nprofiles using Schottky contacts were grown early 1n the program but suffered\nfrom large leakage and burn out at low bias. MBE material Is also being grown\nfor Hughes at Cornell University. Installation of a MBE machine at Hughes has\nrecently been completed and IMPATT material growth will begin soon. VPE growth\nhas also been done but has not been as successful. Future plans are to concentrate exclusively on MBE growth.\nAlthough the Initial diode design was performed using small signal analysis, Hughes has worked with UCLA and has set up their own program for large\nsignal computer analysis. This analysis Is essential for high performance due\nto the nonlinear nature of IMPATT operation. There are still questions to be\nanswered regarding the modelling of parameters which are critical to IMPATT\noperation. The most Important of these are; the lonlzatlon rate versus electric field, saturation velocity versus temperature, and diffusion constant\nversus electric field. Recent large signal results show excellent agreement\nwith experiment In power and efficiency.\nProcessing of the diodes Is a key step 1n the fabrication sequence. It\nwas predicted and experimentally verified that plated heat sink diodes would\nnot provide adequate heat removal from the junction. Hughes has developed a\npill diode process for thinning and metallizing the diodes for mounting on a\ndiamond heat sink. The pill process has an extra advantage In that the number\nof diodes 1s Increased by a factor of 5 over that from plated heat sink processing. This 1s especially Important due to the small area wafers which are\noften necessary 1n MBE machines. During the process, the p metallization\n(Au/Zn) 1s done followed by wafer thinning from 250 to 10 \\>m. The n metallization (Au/Ge/N1) 1s evaporated and alloyed, different size dots are defined\non p and n sides and the thinned wafer 1s etched through to form the pill\ndiodes. The metallization 1n this process 1s critical In that the p\nmetallization must be able to bond well to the metallized diamond without\nexcessive pressure or temperature. This process cured problems associated\n\nwith excessive bonding pressures which often lead to cracking of the GaAs\ndiode. A metallized diamond Is hot pressed Into a copper stud and the pill\ndiode 1s thermo-compresslon bonded to the diamond. These two steps determine\nthe thermal characteristics of the device and the quality and reproduclblHty\nmust be high. A metallized quartz ring and preformed ribbon are used to make\nelectrical connection and also to control the magnitude of the parasitic capacitance and Inductance. Finally, the diode 1s tested 1n a coaxlally-coupled\nreduced height waveguide cavity. This cavity was chosen for Its flexibility\n1n changing dimensions and Impedances and also the ease with which devices may\nbe Inserted and removed without disturbing the circuit.\nAlthough hampered somewhat by a lack of material, good progress Is being\nmade. The material problem was due to older MBE machines with very limited\ngrowth area per run, -1.5 cm^, and the fact that the difficult doping profile\nwas not easily achieved. New generation MBE machines which now have excellent\nuniformity over a 2 1n. wafer and also allow for multiple runs with one loading\nwill alleviate the first problem. Operator experience and Increased capability\nof the machines will make the realization of a particular profile easier to\naccomplish. Best results to date have been 1.0 W with 13 percent efficiency\nat 56 GHz. The noise characteristics will be measured later 1n the program.\nThermal resistance values are about 50\xc2\xb0 C/W and will have to Improve In order\nto achieve the desired performance.\nM/A-COM APPROACH\n\nFor their development of a 60 GHz IMPATT, M/A-COM has chosen GaAs with a\ndouble-drift hybrid Read design and diamond heat sink. The material 1s grown\nboth by conventional VPE methods and also by the MOCVO technique. The doping\nprofile has been obtained through use of the large signal program at the\nUniversity of Michigan. Several options for 60 GHz operation were analyzed\nand a double-drift hybrid Read design was chosen. The predicted performance\nwas 1.3 W output at 14 percent efficiency with a current density of 18\nkA/cm^ and required thermal resistance of 28\xc2\xb0 C/W as shown In table 2.\nThe material growth has proceeded well 1n both VPE and MOCVO. Olethyl\nzinc (DEZ) has been successfully used as a p dopant 1n the VPE growth with\ngood reprodudblllty. Also, thin layers and sharp transitions have been successfully demonstrated. The transition sharpness has been observed to be less\nthan 500 K using C-V measurements but this Is about the sensitivity of the C-V\ntechnique. Nevertheless, due to the rapid growth rate of the VPE technique,\n1t 1s difficult to execute the many doping changes and to maintain good uniformity within layers and sharp transitions between layers.\nMOCVO, on the other hand, has the potential to grow sharper profiles while\nmaintaining good uniformity. MOCVD growth takes place 1n a cold wall reactor\nby the Irreversible pyrolysls of an alkyl gallium compound and arslne.\nTrlmethyl gallium (TMG) Is the compound normally used. This pyrolysls takes\nplace 1n a single hot zone which 1s heated by rf Induction. Low substrate\ngrowth temperature, 650\xc2\xb0 C, and high gas flow rates permit rapid changes of\ndoping level and give this process the capability of producing complex structures with sharp transitions. The entire system has been automated for reproduclblllty. The dopants being used are sllane and dimethyl zinc (DMZ).\n\nAs a result of experiments with baffles and flow rates, uniformity of doping\nand thickness 1n the n layer Is \xc2\xb110 percent run to run and the n layer doping\n1s uniform to \xc2\xb110 percent across a 2" wafer. There 1s more uncertainty 1n the\np layer measurements and these values may be \xc2\xb120 percent. Work 1s continuing\n1n that area. It Is felt that the doping transitions are sharper than 200 A\nalthough this 1s below the sensitivity of the C-V measurements.\nThe rf testing Is accomplished using a "Top-Hat" circuit. This circuit\nwas chosen for Its broadband capability and for ease of Interchanging diodes.\nImpedance matching 1s accomplished by a variety of top-hats with different\ngeometries which are easily Interchanged and also by Interchangeable heat\nsinks of different sizes. This circuit has proven to be versatile In testing\ndiodes with widely varying characteristics. Best rf results to date have been\nwith VPE grown double-drift diodes. Highest power has been 300 mW with 11\npercent efficiency at 52 GHz. HOCVD results have been less than 10 mW with\nlow efficiency. The cause of this low output has not been determined and\nadditional experiments are being done to determine the causes. Plated heat\nsinks are being used for this Initial evaluation. The need for diamond heat\nsink to attain the 1 W level Is recognized and work Is 1n progress to develop\nthis technology for millimeter wave devices.\nRELATED 60 GHz IMPAT1 DIODE WORK\n\nDue to Interest 1n IntersatelUte link applications and secure terrestrial\nlinks, there are several 60 GHz IMPATT diode programs 1n progress. They are\nlisted 1n table 3. The Hughes-NASA/GSFC program 1s specifically designed to\nImprove the mature S1 technology through processing, fabrication, and design\noptimization. The Var1an-NRl program with InP has experienced problems with\nthe p-layer and the results have been less than expected. Additional work\nwill continue 1n order to explore the potential of InP for high efficiency.\nThe remaining four programs with LeRC and AFWAL all have similar goals with\nGaAs but utilize different approaches. These programs ought to clearly Indicate whether the knee In the curves of figure 1 Is above or below 60 GHz. The\ntrend of the results from Hughes and from Raytheon would Indicate that the\n1/f2 falloff 1s going to take place above 60 GHz. As part of the same program, Raytheon 1s also doing CW GaAs IMPATT work at 94 GHz and that data point\nfor the GaAs-S1 comparison will be significant.\nThe question of reliability Is, of course, extremely Important. Masse\nand Harper recently summarized the results of published reliability data on\nGaAs IMPATT devices (ref. 5). At a given junction temperature, say 250\xc2\xb0 C,\nthe median times to failure varied over 5 orders of magnitude, depending on\nthe metallization used and types of stress employed. The reliability of\nIMPATT devices depends basically on the operational junction temperature and\nthe metallization system used. Reliability testing will be done at the\nconclusion of the NASA programs and separate reliability programs may be\nnecessary. Most estimates Indicate, however, that a 10 year lifetime In space\nshould be achievable with junction temperatures below 250\xc2\xb0 C.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nFor the NASA Tracking and Data Acquisition System (TDAS) of the early\n1990\'s time frame, system studies Indicate that V-band 1ntersatell1te links\nwill require approximately 10 W of transmitter power. Table 4 shows recent\nand future 60 GHz amplifier developments. The new development will probably\nrequire 75-30 devices depending on the mode of operation chosen and the\ndevices available. Presently available devices are 1n the 0.8 M range with\n6-9 percent efficiency. With the higher power, higher efficiency devices under\ndevelopment, there will be substantial savings 1n amplifier complexity, weight,\nand prime power requirements. Weight and power may be reduced by 30-40 percent\nof values 1n table 4. This Is expected to have a strong Impact on the viability of the solid-state amplifier for IntersatelUte links.\nOptical and travelling wave tube (TWT) technology offer alternatives to\nthe solid-state amplifier described above. Work Is underway 1n both areas.\nAt the present time, the optical system weight 1s substantially higher than\nthat required for a 60 GHz solid-state system. TWT\'s offer substantially more\npower and efficiency than solid-state amplifiers. A 75 W TWT with 40 percent\nefficiency Is presently being developed at 60 GHz. However, at the power level\nof 10 W, an IHPATT based sol Id-state amplifier may be competitive with the\nTWT. Efficient devices and power combining schemes may bring the solid-state\namplifier weights down to comparable TWT values. Power supplies for\nsolid-state amplifiers are low voltage and less complex. Reliability of the\nIMPATTS 1s a key question which must be addressed.\nIn summary, the application of sophisticated computer design techniques,\nadvanced material growth techniques, and careful thermal considerations are\nexpected to lead to high efficiency high power IMPATT sources of power at 60\nGHz. These devices are expected to find use for IntersatelUte link transmitters in the 1990\'s.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nHleslmalr H., DeSantls C., and Wilson N., "State of the Art of Solld-State\nand Tube Transmitters," Microwave Journal.
