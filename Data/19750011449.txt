Amplifier 42 is\nsimilarly wired so as to receive a positive DC voltage\nthrough resistor 64 to an input power lead 66. Zener\ndiode 68 is coupled between the input power lead 66\nand the common junction 58 so as to provide a uniform\nvoltage for operating the amplifiers 40 and 42.\nThe output of amplifier 42 is coupled by means of\nlead 70 through a variable resistor 72, a voltage control\noscillator 30 to the oscillograph 32. The purpose of the 10\nvariable resistor 72 is to adjust the amplified voltage\nfrom amplifier 42 so as to match the voltage requirement of the oscillograph 32.\nThe output of amplifier 40 is fed through the output\nterminal 74 to a primary winding of isolation trans- 15\nformer 76. The output winding of the isolation transformer 76 is coupled by leads 78 and 80 to a full wave\nrectifier 82. The primary purpose of the isolation transformer 76 is to minimize the problems encountered\n20\nwith ground.\nThe output of the full wave rectifier 82 is coupled\nacross leads 84 and 86 to the portion of the trigger circuit which generates pulses when an over-voltage or\nunder-voltage condition occurs.\nThe rectified voltage appears between leads 84 and 25\n86 across resistors 88 and 90. Interposed between resistors 88 and 90 is a common lead 92 which extends\nthrough the .trigger circuit. This lead 92 may be referred to as negative relative to the positive direct voltage source coming in at the indicated points in the circuit. If there is an over-voltage produced by a transient\nvoltage, it appears across resistor 90 and is applied\nthrough resistor 94, variable resistor 96 to a control\nelectrode 98 of unijunctional transistor UJT1. This\nover-voltage signal charges a capacitor 100 coupled be- \xe2\x80\xa2}5\ntween junctions 102 interposed in lead 84 and junction\n104 interposed in lead 92. If the capacitor 100 charges\nabove a predetermined level, which is controlled by the\nvariable resistor 96, resistor 94 and a resistor 106 coupled between junction 102 and junction 104, then such 40\nturns on the unijunctional transistor UJT1. The capacitor 100 discharges through the unijunctional transistor\nUJT1 and resistor 116, and through diode 110 producing an output pulse 112 on output lead 114. The signals\nappearing on output lead 114 are in the form of pulses,\nsuch as shown in FIG. 2, and each time an over-voltage\ncondition occurs such causes the capacitor 100 to\ncharge and discharge through the unijunctional transistor UJT1 resistor 116 back to the common lead 104.\nThe purposes of resistors 106,108 and 96 are to bias 50\nthe unijunctional transistor UJT1 so that such is fired\nresponsive to a voltage rising above a predetermined\nlevel.\nIn order to produce output signals which are responsive to under-voltage -conditions, a unijunctional transistor UJT2 is provided for looking at the voltage developed across resistor 88. This under-voltage is applied\nacross a filter capacitor 118 to a capacitor 119 connected between junction 104 and a junction 120 interposed in lead 86. When the charge on capacitor 119 exceeds a predetermined level such discharges through\nthe unijunctional transistor UJT2 and resistor 122. Resistor 124 and variable resistor 126 interposed in lead\n86 in combination with resistors 128 and 130 bias the\nunijunctional transistor UJT2 to a level so that such is\nturned on responsive to the voltage level developed\nacross resistor 88 dropping below a predetermined\n\nvalue. When the unijunctional transistor UJT2,- which\nis connected in the lead extending between a common"\njunction 130 and a junction 132, which is coupled to a\npositive DC power supply is turned on by discharging\ncapacitor 119, a pulse is produced. This pulse 112 is\napplied through lead 134, diode 136, to the output lead\n114. In some particular embodiments, the resistors\n124, 126, 128, 130 and 122 are so selected that the\npulse appearing on the output lead 114 resulting from\nthe firing of unijunctional transistor UJT2 is different\nfrom the pulse produced by the over-voltage condition.\nHowever, it is to be understood that the pulses produced by the over-voltage unijunctional transistor\nUJT1, as well as the under-voltage unijunctional transistor UJT2 is sufficient to activate the circuit on the\nright of the drawing which includes a relay for turning\non the oscillograph 13. A Zener diode 138 is coupled\nbetween junction 104 and the common lead 92 to provide a regulated power supply to the unijunctional transistor UJT1. A Zener diode 140 is coupled between\njunction 132 and the common junction 92 for providing a uniform power supply to unijunctional transistor\nUJT2.\nThe output lead 114 is coupled to a control electrode\nof a Darlington transistor 142, through a resistor 144.\nA shunt capacitor and resistor 146 and 148 are coupled\nbetween lead 114 and common lead 92. A positive DC\npower supply is coupled to lead 148 and fed through a\ncontrol coil of a relay 150 to the Darlington transistor\n142. A Zener diode 152 is coupled between the lead\n148 and the common lead 92 for applying a uniform\npower supply to the relay 150 and Darlington transistor\n142. A suppressor diode 154 is connected in shunt with\nthe control coil of the relay 150. When the pulses 112\nappear on the output lead 114 as a result of the occurrence of either an over-voltage or under-voltage condition, such pulse turns on the Darlington transistor 142\nfor a predetermined duration controlled by capacitor\n146. When the Darlington transistor 142 is turned on\nsuch allows the positive voltage appearing on lead 148\nto energize relay 150. When relay 150 is energized its\ncontact 156 is closed connecting an alternating voltage\npower source 158 to the oscillograph by means of lead\n160 to turn on the oscillograph 32. The oscillograph 32\nwhen turned on records the voltage signals which include the transients coming out of the second output\nlead 70 of amplifier 42<\nIn summarizing the operation of the circuit, the leads\n16 are coupled to busbars 10 upon which the voltage\nthat is desired to be monitored is imposed. These voltages are reduced by any suitable conventional voltage\nreducing device so that such can be transmitted over\nconventional telephone lines to a central station. At the\ncentral station there is located an analyzing circuit 34\nwhich includes an amplifying means. This amplifying\nmeans includes a pair of amplifiers which amplifies the\nreduced signal. The output of the amplifier 42. is fed\ninto the oscillograph 32 for being recorded. It is not desired to operate an oscillograph continuously since the\npaper used therein is relatively expensive and normally\nit is desired to operate it at a relatively high rate of\nspeed. In order to turn on the oscillograph responsive\nto an over-voltage or under-voltage condition a trigger\ncircuit which incorporates an over-voltage unijunctional transistor UJT1 and an under-voltage unijunctional transistor UJT2 is provided. The output voltage\nfrom the amplifier 40 is fed through an isolation trans-\n\n3,869,667\nformer 76 and rectified by a full wave rectifier 82. Posirtoried across the output of the full wave rectifier 82 are\na pair of resistors 90 and 88. The voltage impressed\nacross the resistor 90 is looked at by the over-voltage\nunijunctional transistor UJT1 and when such exceeds\na predetermined level causes the unijunctional transistor UJT1 to turn on producing a pulse on the output\nlead 114.\nThe under-voltage condition is sensed by a unijunctional transistor UJT2 which looks at the voltage across\nresistor 88. When the under-voltage condition occurs\nthe unijunctional transistor UJT2 is turned on, also,\nproducing a pulse on the output lead 114. The pulses\n112 appearing on the output lead 114 are applied\nthrough various circuitry to turn on a Darlington transistor 142. Connected in series with the Darlington\ntransistor 142 is a control coil of a relay which closes\nits contacts 156 upon energization of the Darlington\ntransistor 142. When contacts 156 are closed power is\nsupplied by lead 160 to the oscillograph for turning on\nthe oscillograph for recording the voltage coming out\nof the amplifier 42. From analyzing these voltage signals such aids an operator in locating an identifying\ntransient voltage.\nWhile a preferred embodiment of the invention has\nbeen described using specific terms, such description is\nfor illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood\nthat changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.\nWhat is Claimed is:\n1.
