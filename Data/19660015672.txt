If this is t r u e , then the b e s t assignment may be defined as the\none that r e s u l t s in the l e a s t degradztion of s y s t e m reliability.\n\nIt i s\n\nrecognized that the maximum gain in reliability t o be realized solely\nthrough command assignment is small.\n\nHowever, the p a r t i c u l a r com-\n\nmand assignment actually used in a given s a t e l l i t e is m o r e o r l e s s a r b i t r a r y ; t h e r e f o r e , u s e of the most reliable assignment should involve\nno added increment of c o s t beyond the application of this memorandum.\nThe approach taken is f i r s t t o examine in d e t a i l the command subs y s t e m , the command function, and the assignment c r i t e r i a .\n\nThen, on\n\nthe b a s i s of t h i s analysis, a generalized assignment methodology will be\npresented and evaluated.\n\nThe GEOS A satellite will be used f o r illus-\n\nt r ative purposes throughout the memorandum.\n2.\n\nAnalysis\n\nA reliability a s s e s s m e n t f o r the GEOS A command subsyst e m , including a complete f i r s t - o r d e r f a i l u r e mode and effects analysis,\nh a s been completed and the r e s u l t s reported in Reference 1.\n\n1\n\nAlthough\n\n\'\n\nnot essential f o r an understanding of this TAM, s o m e r e s u l t s presented\nhave been derived in d e t a i l in Reference 1.\n\nIt a l s o will provide addi-\n\ntional background information f o r those unfamiliar with the GEOS A\ncommand sub system.\nThe objective of Reference 1 was t o a s s e s s the reliability of the\nGEOS A command subsystem.\nquite favorable.\n\nThe r e s u l t s of this a s s e s s m e n t w e r e\n\nHowever, two assumptions inherent in that a s s e s s m e n t\n\nw e r e that all 64 commands w e r e of equal value and that value l o s t was\nan additive function of commands lost.\n\nThus, s i m i l a r f a i l u r e effects\n\ncould be grouped; this simplified the analysis considerably.\n\nThe p r e s -\n\nence of extra o r wrong commands was e s s e n t i a l l y ignored t o f u r t h e r\nsimplify that analysis.\n\nThe objective of t h i s TAM is t o remove these\n\nassumptions and then t o d e r i v e a method f o r assigning the command functions to the m a t r i x intersections in a n optimal manner.\na.\n\nThe Command Subsystem\nExhibit 1 will s e r v e to define the m a j o r elements of\n\nthe GEOS A command subsystem.\n\nThe logic units and m a t r i x a r e of\n\np r i m a r y interest in this analysis since only t h e s e units give r i s e to\n1\ndegraded subsystem s t a t e s .\nIt is c l e a r that command assignment off e r s improvement only in the face of p a r t i a l s u b s y s t e m l o s s , f o r no\nassignment offers any advantage over another i f the command subsyst e m is perfectly operable o r totally failed.\nExhibit 2 p r e s e n t s a detailed s u m m a r y of the f i r s t - o r d e r failure\neffects f o r a single logic unit; Exhibit 3 does the s a m e f o r the m a t r i x\nunit.\n\nThe probability of observing each distinguishable effect is a l s o\n\npresented in these exhibits.\n\nEach effect is given a s t a t e n u m b e r , o r\n\nindex, f o r ease i n manipulation.\nto the state index.\n\nSimilar e f f e c t s a r e grouped according\n\nExhibits 1, 2, and 3 a r e d e r i v e d d i r e c t l y f r o m Ref-\n\ne r e n c e 1.\n\n\'The m a t r i x unit is defined a s extending to, but not including, the\nr e l a y s that a particular inter section actuates.\n\n2\n\n.\n\n.\n\n,\n\nEXHIBIT 2\n\nState\n\n- LOGIC UNIT STATES,\n\n?\n\nFAILURE E F F E C T S AND\nSTATE PROBABILITIES\n\nF a i l u r e Effect\n\nIndividual\nState Probability\n\n1\n\nP e r f e c t operation\n\n0.478 1\n\n2\n\nL o s e logic unit 1\n\n0.1284\n\n3\n\nLose e n t i r e subsystem\n\n0.0178\n\n4\n\nL o s e logic unit 2 (1)\n\n0.0083\n\nL o s e C1-C7\n\n0.0075\n\n5- 8\n\nC2-C8\nFl-F7\nF2-F8\nLose one column\n\n0.0041\n\n17-24\n\nL o s e one row\n\n0.0041\n\n25-28\n\nL o s e C1-C3 and C5-C7\n\n0.0038\n\n9-16\n\nC3-C8\nF l - F 3 and F 5 - F 7\n29-32\n\n-\n\nLose C l - C 4\n\n_ \'\n\n38\n\nC5-C8\n\nFl-F4\nF5-F8\n33-36\n\nLose one command tone\n\n0.0037\n\n37-62\n\nExecute wrong o r e x t r a commands ( 2 )\n\n0.0576\n\nHigher o r d e r f a i l u r e s (3)\n\n0.1690\n\n63\n\n4\n\nEXHIBIT 2 (Continued)\nL\n\nNotes: (1) This f a i l u r e effect i s such that, if any other logic unit in\nthe vicinity is a d d r e s s e d , the failed logic unit will treat the\nf i r s t m e s s a g e tone a s its a d d r e s s and will then accumulate\ns u c c e s s i v e m e s s a g e tone until it executes a command.

As such, it is somewhat m o r e difficult to m e a s u r e improvement,\n\nThe intuitive idea i s this: a single f a i l u r e effect of a given\n\nkind should be no m o r e detrimental to p r o p e r operation of the s p a c e c r a f t\nthan any other failure of the s a m e kind.\n\nI n t e r m s of the previous two-by-\n\ntwo m a t r i x example, all partial failure e f f e c t s a r e s i m i l a r ; i. e. , each\nThis c r i -\n\nc a u s e s the l o s s of two commands i n e i t h e r a row o r a column.\n\nterion would be completely satisfied i f the s u m s of the row and column\nl o s s e s were identical.\n\nDue to the integral nature of assigned values i n\n\nthis c a s e (and in g e n e r a l ) , exact equality i s not possible.\n\nThe c r i t e r i o n\n\ncould a l s o be satisfied, however, by minimizing the s u m of squared deviations from the theoretical mean l o s s of s i m i l a r failure effects.\n\nI n the\n\nsimple example the theoretical mean l o s s p e r failure is 0.5, since half\nthe m a t r i x i s l o s t in any event.\n\nThe s u m of squared deviations of the\n\nupper left m a t r i x assignment of Exhibit 8, f o r example, i s : (0.1 t 0.2\n2\n2\n-0.5)\nt (0.3 t 0.4 - 0.5)\n+ (0.1 t 0.3 - 0 . 5 ) 2 t (0.2 t 0.4 - 0 . 5 ) 2 = 0.10.\nThe assignment represented by the m a t r i x i n the last row and f i r s t column of Exhibit 8 has a similar sum of only 0.02, which can be shown to\nbe a minimum for this example.\n\nA g e n e r a l assignment method to satisfy\n\nthis criterion under the assumption of row o r column l o s s e s only h a s been\ndeveloped i n Reference 3 for m x n m a t r i c e s .\n\nWhere other failure e f -\n\nfects a r e prevalent, a s i n the GEOS A "tone l o s s " failure effect, the c r i terion is the s a m e ; i . e . , that assignment which m o s t n e a r l y equalizes\nthe l o s s e s due t o s i m i l a r failure effects is best.\n\nSection 3 will consider\n\nthe problems unique to the GEOS A regarding the application of this\ncriterion.\n(3)\n\nMinimum Loss of Group Commands\nThis l a s t of the t h r e e g e n e r a l c r i t e r i a i s probably\n\nthe most difficult to implement o r even to define adequately.\nf r o m the following considerations.\n\nIt a r i s e s\n\nSome command functions a r e related\n\nin such a way that the f a i l u r e to execute one of the commands significantly\nchanges the relative values of other commands.\n\n28\n\nThe c a s e i n which two\n\ncommand functions provide redundancy is an obvious example.\n\nThe five\n\ngroups of subsection 2.b provide another possible example, although the\ngrouping in this section w a s not done for this purpose.\n\nThe b e s t a s s i g n -\n\nment under this c r i t e r i o n would have essentially two c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s .\nFirst, i f a c r i t i c a l satellite function could be initiated by e i t h e r of two\n\ncommands, l o s s of both commands would be much m o r e s e v e r e than the\nl o s s of e i t h e r individually.\n\nHence, that assignment is b e s t which s e p a -\n\nr a t e s such command functions with r e s p e c t to failure effect.\n\nSecond,\n\na command that would be of sharply reduced utility upon the loss of a\nr e l a t e d command (the on/off p a i r s provide an immediate example)\nshould be combined with r e s p e c t to failure effects.\n\nThis m i n i m i z e s the\n\nnumber of command functions that will be degraded, given a p a r t i c u l a r\n\n10ss.\nTo r e v e r t to the simple example above, a s s u m e first that the\n\ncommands valued 0.1 and 0 . 3 a r e such that l o s s of both would be c a t a s trophic to the m i s s i o n , whereas the other two commands a r e independent of each other and of this pair.\n\nThen this c r i t e r i o n would n e c e s s i t a t e\n\nthat the r e l a t e d command be assigned on a diagonal of the m a t r i x s o t h a t\nboth command functions would not be l o s t upon the o c c u r r e n c e of a s i n gle failure.\n\nNext, a s s u m e that the commands valued 0.2 and 0.4 a r e\n\nsuch that, i f one is lost, the value of the other is essentially z e r o . Then\nthe c r i t e r i a would r e q u i r e that, wherever command 0.2 i s located, command 0.4 should be in the same row o r column.\n\nAgain, the application\n\nof this c r i t e r i o n to GEOS A will be discussed in Section 3.\n(4)\n\nCombination of C r i t e r i a\nIt should be quite evident at this point that indi-\n\nvidual application of the t h r e e c r i t e r i a d i s c u s s e d above would not, in\ngeneral, lead to the s a m e resultant command assignment.\n\nThis brings\n\nup the necessity of some priority scheme for the assignment c r i t e r i a .\nAgain, this would appear to be m o r e a m a t t e r f o r sound engineering\njudgment than for theoretical analysis.\n\nIn o r d e r to clarify the problem,\n\nhowever, consider once m o r e the example above.\n\nDesignate the four\n\ncommands and the associated values as a(O.l), b(0.2), c(0.3), and d(0.4),\n\n29\n\nand let the example of subsections 2 . c . ( l ) and 2.c.(2) d e s c r i b e the basic\nsituation. In addition, a s s u m e that commands a and c should not be lost\ntogether, that commands b and c should be lost together, and that c o m mand d i s entirely independent of the other three in a relative value\nsense.\n\nW h a t i s the best a s s i g n m e n t ? Exhibit 9 shows the assignments\n\nthat would be made under the various c r i t e r i a , considered singly.\nthe f i r s t c r i t e r i o n the r e s u l t s of subsection 2 . c .

This w i l l r e q u i r e further consideration of the command subsystem failure effects.\n\nExamination of Exhibits 2 through 6\n\nindicates that the m o s t probable p a r t i a l command l o s s type of failure r e s u l t s in losing complete rows or columns f r o m the command m a t r i x and,\nbecause of the m a t r i x failure effects, l o s s of r o w s i s slightly m o r e probable than l o s s of columns.\n\nTherefore, command p a i r s should be located\n\nin the s a m e rows of the matrix.\n\nIn addition to s t r i c t row/column l o s s e s\n\ni n the m a t r i x , t h e r e a r e those l o s s e s resulting f r o m tone l o s s , loss of a\nsingle command, and multiple f a i l u r e s among the t h r e e p r i m a r y command\ns u b s y s t e m units.\n\nSince many of the l a t t e r a r e row/column l o s s e s and\n\n33\n\nthe r e m a i n d e r a r e of v e r y low probability, these will be considered no\nfurther.\n\nSingle command l o s s e s offer no b a s i s for p a i r assignment,\n\nsince each is equally likely.\n\nFinally, the tone-loss effect would r e q u i r e\n\nthat the halves of each command p a i r differ by, a t m o s t , one tone.\n\nThis\n\nrequirement c a n a l s o be readily satisfied by assigning p a i r s to the s a m e\nrow in a r a t h e r l a r g e number of ways.\n\nExhibit 4 shows one way they c a n\n\nbe assigned.\nF r o m a consideration of Exhibits 2 and 3 , i t c a n be s e e n that extraneous commands a r e m o r e likely to occur in the left half of the m a t r i x\nthan in the right half.\n\nT h e r e f o r e , the optimal assignment not only would\n\na s s i g n command p a i r s to the s a m e row and to tone sequences differing\nby only one tone, but a l s o would a s s i g n them such that the normally "on"\nportion of the command would be assigned to the left half of the matrix.\nIf the "b" portion of the commands was the normally "on" portion of the\ncommands, the p r e s e n t assignment (shown in Exhibit 4) is admirably\nsuited t o assigning commands under the m i n i m u m - l o s s c r i t e r i a of\ncommand-pair groups.\n\nOtherwise, the a s s i g n m e n t should be a l t e r e d\n\ns o that the command half in which the dot a p p e a r s in Exhibit 4 a l s o\n\no c c u r s in the left half of the matrix.\nThe second c l a s s of grouped commands will now be d i s c u s s e d .\nThe c r i t e r i o n h e r e r e q u i r e s an assignment such that the command functions 2 7 and 2 8 o r 2 3 and 2 5 should not both be l o s t due to a single failure.\n\nA single failure should cause the fewest command functions f r o m\n\nthe 4, 5, 6 , 7 , and 8 groups to be lost. Finally, a single f a i l u r e e f f e c t\nshould not extraneously execute both commands 17b and 18a.\n\nConsider\n\nf i r s t those groups of commands whose simultaneous l o s s is to be avoided.\nBecause of the previous r e q u i r e m e n t t h a t both halves of a command\npair appear in the s a m e row, t h e r e a r e effectively four columns and\neight rows to which a given complete command function m a y be assigned.\nReference to Exhibits 2 through 6 indicates that a p p e a r a n c e of the grouped\ncommand functions in the s a m e rows o r columns should be avoided, since\na single m a t r i x l o s s , f o r example, could c a u s e both (all) such functions\nto be lost.\n\nCommand l o s s e s other than individual row /column l o s s e s with\nreasonable probabilities of occurrence a r e essentially those shown i n\nExhibit 2 .\n\nStates 5 through 8 of this exhibit put the f u r t h e r constraint\n\non the assignment that p a i r s of command functions should be assigned\nto the f i r s t and last rows of the m a t r i x to avoid simultaneous l o s s of two\ncommand functions.\n\nStates 25 through 28 place the added r e q u i r e m e n t\n\nof putting the command p a i r s in columns 1 and 4.\nthrough 36 imply u s e of different tones.\n\nFinally, s t a t e s 3 3\n\nBy placing commands 27 and\n\n28 i n matrix positions C1, F 1 and C4, F 8 , respectively, and commands\n23 and 25 i n positions C1, F8 and C4, F 1 , respectively, this c r i t e r i o n\nh a s been m e t for these command groups.\np r e s e n t a slightly m o r e difficult problem.\n\nThe 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 groups\nF i r s t , it is manifest that\n\ntwo of the command functions must fall in the s a m e column.\n\nStates 5\n\nthrough 8 suggest one command function i n the first row, F1, and one\nin F8.\n\nStates 25 through 28 suggest u s e of rows 1, 2 , 4, and 8 and\n\ncolumns 1, 2 , and 4.\n\nStates 29 through 32 imply a maximum division\n\nbetween the first four and l a s t four rows.\n\nFinally, s t a t e s 2 9 through 32\n\nimply maximum separation of command tones.\n\nPositions C1, F2; C2,\n\nF1; C3, F8; C4, F 7 ; and C1, F 6 a r e one possible assignment.\nA p e r u s a l of note 2 , Exhibit 2 , indicates that, to prevent the simul-\n\ntaneous execution of commands 17 and 18 f r o m one failure effect, the\ncommands should not be placed in the s a m e row.\n\nPlacing these corn-\n\nm a n d s in C2, F4 and C2, F 8 as shown in Exhibit 4 is satisfactory f r o m\nthe point of view of this criterion.\nb.\n\nEqual Expected Loss\nAssignment under this c r i t e r i o n can be reduced to a\n\ntypical " m a g i c - s q u a r e s " problem.\n\nThat i s , the problem is essentially\n\none of assigning the consecutive i n t e g e r s (1 t o mn) to an m x n matrix\nsuch that the column s u m s a r e identical and the row s u m s a r e identical.\nIf t h e r e a r e no other constraints on the problem, this can be done in a\n1\nv e r y l a r g e number of ways for a matrix of the s i z e considered h e r e .\n\n\'See, for example, the chapter on magic s q u a r e s i n W.

importance, and the decision to group o r not to group c e r t a i n\nfunctions i s i m m a t e r i a l to effective allocation.\n\nIt should be noted first\n\nthat all functions i n a specified group m u s t have the s a m e value.\nc o n v e r s e of this is not true!\n\nThe\n\nIn other words, two functions do not have\n\nto be placed in the s a m e group just because they s e e m to have the same\nvalue.\n\nHowever, t h e r e is one instance i n which it i s of g r e a t impor-\n\ntance to place functions i n the same group: i f two o r m o r e functions a r e\nso related that the l o s s of a l l the functions i s considerably m o r e damag-\n\n-\n\ni n g than the l o s s of j u s t one, they must be placed i n the s a m e group.\n\nThe purpose of placing functions in the s a m e group i s to maximize the\nprobability that they fall in distinct rows and columns.\n\nSuch functions\n\nshould be placed i n the s a m e group even i f the u s e r must "fudge" a little\nto proclaim that they have the same value.\n\nI t would generally appear\n\nthat functions that must be separated will, in fact, have the s a m e value.\nOnce the functions of the above type have been properly grouped, the\nr e m a i n d e r of the grouping task is relatively simple, p r i m a r i l y because\nthe effectiveness of the allocation will not be noticeably affected by the\nn a t u r e of the grouping.\n\nKeeping firmly i n mind that the functions in a\n\ngroup must have the same value, this l a t t e r portion of the grouping t a s k\n\n55\n\nshould be done i n such a way that the bookkeeping is a s simple a s possible.\n\nThe r e m a i n d e r of the allocation scheme will be simplified some-\n\nwhat i f the number of groups i s kept reasonably small.\n\nOn the other\n\nhand, t h e r e i s no real point in grouping a collection of functions i f they\nhave nothing in common except the s a m e value.\n\nC.\n\nAssignment of Group and Element Values\nThe problem of assigning values to the groups and e l e m e n t s is\n\nm o r e complex.\n\nThe valuation problem is i n no way unique to t h i s de-\n\nvice f o r allocation, but is a question that would have to be resolved in\no r d e r to evaluate the effectiveness of any proposed assignment of functions to the command matrix.\n\nIn a l a r g e r s e n s e , the valuation prob-\n\nl e m is encountered i n many situations when one needs t o a s s i g n a num e r i c value t o the contribution of a given object (component, s u b s y s t e m ,\netc.) to the total m i s s i o n ,\nIt would be d e s i r a b l e

f o r w a r d approach\nis feasible, The b e s t that can be done is t o p e r m i t a subjective a s s i g n -\n\nment of values by a p e r s o n who is intimately familiar with the s y s t e m\nand

that a knowledgeable individual might take to a valuation p r o b l e m will be discussed.\nIt m u s t be emphasized in the beginning that only r e l a t i v e values a r e im-\n\nportant.\n\nF o r
