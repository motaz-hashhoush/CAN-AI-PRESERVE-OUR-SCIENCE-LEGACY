Windhorst\nAbstract Text (610 words):\nConvective weather events have a disruptive impact on air traffic both in terminal area and in en-route\nairspaces. In order to make sure that the national air transportation system is safe and efficient, it is\nessential to respond to convective weather events effectively. Traffic flow control initiatives in response to\nconvective weather include ground delay, airborne delay, miles-in-trail restrictions as well as tactical and\nstrategic rerouting. The rerouting initiatives can potentially increase traffic density and complexity in\nregions neighboring the convective weather activity. There is a need to perform rerouting in an intelligent\nand efficient way such that the disruptive effects of rerouting are minimized. An important area of research\nis to study the interaction of in-flight rerouting with traffic congestion or complexity and developing\nmethods that quantitatively measure this interaction. Furthermore, it is necessary to find rerouting solutions\nthat account for uncertainties in weather forecasts. These are important steps toward managing complexity\nduring rerouting operations, and the paper is motivated by these research questions.\nAn automated system is developed for rerouting air traffic in order to avoid convective weather regions\nduring the 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour time horizon. Such a system is envisioned to work in concert with separation\nassurance (0 \xe2\x80\x93 20-minute time horizon), and longer term air traffic management (2-hours and beyond) to\nprovide a more comprehensive solution to complexity and safety management. In this study, weather is\ndynamic and uncertain; it is represented as regions of airspace that pilots are likely to avoid. Algorithms are\nimplemented in an air traffic simulation environment to support the research study. The algorithms used are\ndeterministic but periodically revise reroutes to account for weather forecast updates.\nIn contrast to previous studies, in this study convective weather is represented as regions of airspace\nthat pilots are likely to avoid. The automated system periodically updates forecasts and reassesses rerouting\ndecisions in order to account for changing weather predictions. The main objectives are to reroute flights to\navoid convective weather regions and determine the resulting complexity due to rerouting. The eventual\ngoal is to control and reduce complexity while rerouting flights during the 20 minute \xe2\x80\x93 2 hour planning\nperiod.\nA three-hour simulation is conducted using 4800 flights in the national airspace. The study compares\nseveral metrics against a baseline scenario using the same traffic and weather but with rerouting disabled.\nThe results show that rerouting can have a negative impact on congestion in some sectors, as expected. The\nrerouting system provides accurate measurements of the resulting complexity in the congested sectors.\nFurthermore, although rerouting is performed only in the 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour range, it results in a 30%\nreduction in encounters with nowcast weather polygons (100% being the ideal for perfectly predictable and\naccurate weather).\nIn the simulations, rerouting was performed for the 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour flight time horizon, and for the\nen-route segment of air traffic. The implementation uses CWAM, a set of polygons that represent\nprobabilities of pilot deviation around weather. The algorithms were implemented in a software-based air\ntraffic simulation system. Initial results of the system\xe2\x80\x99s performance and effectiveness were encouraging.\nSimulation results showed that when flights were rerouted in the 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour flight time horizon of\nair traffic, there were fewer weather encounters in the first 20 minutes than for flights that were not\nrerouted. Some preliminary results were also obtained that showed that rerouting will also increase\ncomplexity. More simulations will be conducted in order to report conclusive results on the effects of\nrerouting on complexity. Thus, the use of the 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour flight time horizon weather avoidance\ntechniques performed in the simulation is expected to provide benefits for short-term weather avoidance.\n\nComment [p1l : HYPHEN AND EMDASH USAGE ERROR.\nUsage notes:\nHyphen vs. dash. There are three hyphen-like\ncharacters: the hyphen itself, the en dash (\xe2\x80\x93)\nand the em dash\n(\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93). Here are the uses for each:\nHyphen\nUse the hyphen is when a multi-syllable word\nbreaks at the end of a line, to link compound\nmodifiers and other\nhyphenated words (e.g., 20-minute to 2-hour\ntime horizon), and for telephone numbers (e.g.\n800-555-1212). Do not put a space before or\nafter a hyphen\nEn Dash\nAn en dash, roughly the width of the letter \xe2\x80\x9cn,\xe2\x80\x9d\nis a little longer than a hyphen. Use it to\ndesignate periods of time when you might\notherwise use the word \xe2\x80\x9c to\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d For\nexample:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 20-minute \xe2\x80\x93 2-hour time horizon\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The years 2001\xe2\x80\x932003\nAn en dash is also used in place of a hyphen\nwhen combining open compounds. For\nexample:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 North Carolina\xe2\x80\x93Virginia border\nEm Dash\nAn em dash is the width of the letter \xe2\x80\x9cm. \xe2\x80\x9d m.\nUse an em dash sparingly in formal writing. In\ninformal writing, em dashes may replace\ncommas, semicolons, colons, and parentheses\nto indicate added emphasis, an interruption, or\nan abrupt change of thought. For example:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You are the friend\xe2\x80\x94the only friend\xe2\x80\x94who\noffered to help me.\nOPTIONAL: A space before and after the \xe2\x80\x93\n(en dash) and \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 (em dash) is optional. Just\nbe consistent.\n\n'
