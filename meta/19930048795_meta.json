To find a permutation on the bit positions for a given code that minimizes the state complexity of its minimal trellis diagram is an interesting and challenging problem. This permutation problem is related to the generalized Hamming weight hierarchy of a code, and is shown that for RM codes, the standard binary order of bit positions is optimum at every bit position with respect to the state complexity of a minimal trellis diagram by using a theorem due to Wei. The state complexity of trellis diagram for the extended and permuted (64, 24) BCH code is discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "39", "submissionId": 19930048795, "issue": "1", "issn": "0018-9448", "id": "bc6295adb3e24374a80ba9fdb3d6d02f", "publicationName": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
