As a result, increasingly stringent international constraints are being placed on aircraft companies to reduce this\nnoise. Aircraft noise is generally divided into two categories.\nThe first has to do with noise generated by the propulsion\nsystem, while the second is related to noise generated by the\ninteraction of mean flow over the airframe as it traverses\nthrough the air.\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nOne aspect of the present invention is a landing gear door of\nthe type that covers retractable landing gear of an aircraft\nwhen the landing gear is retracted during flight. The landing\ngear door shifts outwardly when the landing gear is deployed.\nThe landing gear door includes a door structure defining first\nand second opposite sides. The first and second opposite sides\nhave first and second opposite surfaces, respectively. The\ndoor structure further includes edge surfaces extending\nbetween the first and second sides, and the door structure\ndefines an internal structure disposed between the first and\nsecond opposite sides. The door structure defines a porous\nsurface on at least one of the first and second opposite side\nsurfaces, and the internal structure defines at least one internal\nacoustic chamber or passageway defining a first end that is\nacoustically connected to the porous surface such that at least\na substantial portion of sound entering the elongated acoustic\nchamber or passageway at the first end thereof is absorbed by\nthe internal structure of the landing gear door. The internal\nacoustic chambers or passageways may be elongated. The\nlanding gear door may include a plurality of internal acoustic\nchambers, each having the same length, or one or more of the\nchambers may have a different length than one or more of the\nother chambers. The internal chambers may be substantially\nlinear, or they may include angled portions that extend at\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFIG.1 is an isometric view of an aircraft including retractable landing gear and landing gear doors according to one\naspect of the present invention;\nFIG. 2 is a partially fragmentary enlarged view of the main\nlanding gear of the aircraft of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the landing gear door of\nFIG. 2 taken along the line III-III;\nFIG. 4 shows a landing gear door according to another\naspect of the present invention; and\nFIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the landing gear door of\nFIG. 4 taken along the line V-V.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\nFor purposes of description herein, the terms "upper,"\n"lower," "right," "left," "rear," "front," "vertical," "horizontal," and derivatives thereof shall be related to the invention as\noriented in FIG. 5. However, it is to be understood that the\ninvention may assume various alternative orientations, except\nwhere expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be\nunderstood that the specific devices and processes illustrated\nin the attached drawing, and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive\nconcepts defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, references to specific items or features (e.g. a wing structure,\nleading edge slat, and slat cove filler) shall not be construed as\nlimiting the item or feature to one-piece or multi-piece items\nor features. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical\ncharacteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein\nare not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims\nexpressly state otherwise.\nAn aircraft 1(FIG.1) includes a fuselage 2, wings 3, and a\npropulsion system such as jet engines 4. The primary aircraft\nstructure including the fuselage 2, wings 3, and engine 4 may\ncomprise a known design and these parts of aircraft 1 will not\ntherefore be described in detail herein.\nWith reference to FIG. 1, Aircraft 1 includes a retractable\nlanding gear system 10 including a nose assembly 12, and two\nmain assemblies 14. The main assemblies 14 include tires 15,\nstruts 16, and doors 20. During takeoff and landing, the landing gear is in a deployed position as shown in FIG. 1. During\nlevel flight, the landing gear is retracted such that the tires 15,\nstruts 16, and other related components are received in landing gear bays or cavities 18. When the main assemblies 14 are\nretracted, outer surfaces 22 of landing gear doors 20 are flush\n\nUS 8,708,272 B1\n3\nwith outer surfaces 6 of the fuselage 2 and/or wings 3. The\ntires 15, struts 16, and associated powered actuators (not\nshown) and other such components are generally known, and\nwill not therefore be described in detail herein.\nWith further reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, landing gear door 5\n20 includes a door structure 24 defining first and second\nopposite sides 26 and 28. The opposite sides 26 and 28\ninclude first and second opposite surfaces 30 and 32, respectively. Edge surfaces 34, 36, 38, and 40 extend between the\nfirst and second sides 26 and 28 of door structure 24. It will be io\nunderstood that the landing gear door 20 and door structure 24\nmay have a variety of different shapes and sizes as required\nfor a particular aircraft design.\nThe door structure 24 also defines an acoustic liner 8 comprising an internal structure or body 42 disposed between the 15\nfirst and second opposite sides 26 and 28. The door structure\n24 includes a porous surface 44 on at least one of the first and\nsecond opposite side surfaces 30 and 32. The internal structure 42 defines at least one internal acoustic chamber 50. The\ninternal acoustic chambers 50 have first ends 52 that are 20\nacoustically connected to the porous surface 44 such that at\nleast a substantial portion of sound entering the acoustic\nchambers 50 at the first end 52 is absorbed by the internal\nstructure 42 of the landing gear door 20.\nReferring again to FIG. 3, acoustic chambers 50 of acoustic 25\nliner 8 may include an outer end portion 54 that extends\nsubstantially transverse or perpendicular to porous surface\n44, and an inner end portion 56 that extends transverse to the\nouter end portion 54. The inner end portion 56 may extend\nsubstantially parallel to porous surface 44. The acoustic 30\nchambers 50 may have inner closed ends 58, such that openings 52 comprise the only openings that permit sound to enter\nthe acoustic chambers 50. Alternately, one or more of the\nacoustic chambers 50 may extend all the way through the\ninternal structure 42 to thereby form an internal passageway 35\nwith openings 52 and 60 on opposite sides 26 and 28, respectively, of door structure 42.\nThe internal chambers 50 may have circular cross-sectional shapes, and the cross-sectional area of the internal\nchambers 50 may be substantially constant along the length 40\nof the internal chambers 50. Alternately, the chambers 50 may\nhave non-circular cross-sectional shapes (e.g., quadrilateral\nshaped), and/or the cross-sectional area of the chambers 50\nmay vary.\nAlso, as shown in FIG. 3, different internal chambers 50 of 45\nacoustic liner 8 may have different lengths defined between\nends 52 and 58. The differences in lengths provide for absorption of sound at different frequencies. Thus, acoustic liner 8 of\ndoor 20 may be configured to absorb a broad spectrum of\nsound utilizing internal acoustic chambers 50 of different 50\nlengths and/or different shapes.\nPorous surface 44 of acoustic liner 8 may comprise a thin\nsheet of metal or other suitable material having a plurality of\nperforations therethrough. Alternately, porous surface 44\nmay comprise a mesh or the like, ortheporous surface44may 55\nbe formed by the internal structure 42 itself, Acoustic filler\nmaterial 48 such as foam or other suitable material may be\npositioned in one or more of the internal chambers 50, and the\nfiller material 48 may partially or completely fill the chambers 50. The internal structure 42 may comprise a metal 60\nmaterial, fiber composites, or other suitable material.\nWith further reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, a landing gear door\n20A according to another aspect of the present invention\nincludes an acoustic liner 8A having an internal structure\n42A, and a plurality of internal acoustic chambers 50A. Each 65\nchamber 50A has a first or outer end/opening 52A, and an\ninner end 36A that may optionally be open at the second\n\n4\nopposite side 28A of door 20A or at a different location on the\nsame side 26A or door 20A. Porous surface 44A of acoustic\nliner 8A comprises a sheet of material 46 having a plurality of\nperforations 47 such that the ends 52A of acoustic chambers\n50A are acoustically open at the surface 30A of door 20A.\nOne or more of the acoustic chambers 50A may include an\nopen end 60A on opposite side 28A of door 20A to thereby\nfoiin a passageway that permits sound to travel through the\ndoor 20A from first side 26A to second side 28A, and viceversa. One or more of the acoustic chambers 50A may alternatively include an open end on the same side 26A of door\n20A to thereby form a passageway that permits sound to\ntravel through the door 20A from first side 26A to another\nlocation on the same side. Similarly, one or more of the\nchambers may alternatively include two open ends within the\nsecond side 28A suchthat sound is permitted to travel through\nthe door 20A from one location to another on the second side\n28A.\nThe acoustic treatment embedded within the volume of the\nlanding gear doors 20 and 20A changes the boundary condition at the surface(s) 30 (and 32) such that sound is absorbed\nwithin the door 20 or 20A. The internal acoustic chambers\n50A and porous surface 44 of liners 8 and 8A also change the\nboundary conditions of the door 20 to inhibit the generation of\nnoise at the surface 30 and/or 32.\nAs discussed above, the lengths of internal acoustic chambers 50A of the liner 8A of door 20A (FIG. 5) are varied. If the\npartitions between adjacent internal chambers are impervious\nand sufficiently close together, this provides a local-reacting\nliner configuration, and each chamber in this embodiment\nbehaves as a quarter-wavelength resonator (sometimes called\nan organ-pipe resonator). In this embodiment, the different\nlengths of the chambers 50 are selected for optimal absorption of different frequencies. By proper selection of the combination of lengths of the chambers 50, a broadband sound\nabsorber can be achieved.\nIf the internal volume defined by chambers 50 is filled with\nfoam 48 or the like, sound that enters through the porous\nsurface 44 of the liner 8 of door 20 travels in multiple directions within the foam. If configured in this way, the sound can\ntravel in multiple directions, and exit the liner 8 of door 20 via\ndifferent portions of the porous surface 44. The chambers 50\nmay include openings at opposite ends at surface 30 and 32,\nor the acoustic chambers 50 may have multiple openings at\nsurface 30 or multiple openings at surface 32. Surface 32 may\nalso comprise a porous surface 44 having a sheet 46 with\nperforations 47.\nIt will be understood that the specific acoustic liner configurations and door geometries discussed above in connection with FIGS. 2-5 are examples of suitable geometries, but\nthe present invention is not limited to these configuration\nand/or geometries. There are many designs that could be used\nto achieve similar surface acoustic impedance boundary conditions. This can be done by suitably varying the geometry of\nthe internal cavities 50 and the surface face sheet 46.\nThe sound-absorbing liner and landing gear door discussed\nabove are utilized for main landing gear assemblies 14 (FIG.\n1). However, it will be understood that acoustic liners and\ndoors according to the present invention may be utilized in\nconnection with a variety of different retractable landing gear\nconfigurations. Thus, the shape and size of the acoustic liners\nand doors may therefore vary significantly when utilized for\ndifferent applications.\nIt is to be understood that variations and modifications can\nbe made on the aforementioned structure without departing\nfrom the concepts of the present invention, and further it is to\n\nUS 8,708,272 B1\n5\nbe understood that such concepts are intended to be covered\nby the following claims unless these claims by their language\nexpressly state otherwise,\nThe invention claimed is:\n1.
