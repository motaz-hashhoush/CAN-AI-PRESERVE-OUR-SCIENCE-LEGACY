As RPS have evolved throughout the years, there has also grown a desire for more efficient power systems, allowing NASA to serve as good stewards of the limited plutonium-238 (238Pu), while also supporting the ever-present need to minimize mass and potential impacts to the desired science measurements. In fact, the recent Nuclear Power Assessment Study (NPAS) released in April 2015 resulted in several key conclusion regarding RPS, including affirmation that RPS will be necessary well into the 2030s (at least) and that 238Pu is indeed a precious resource requiring efficient utilization and preservation. Stirling Radioisotope Generators (SRGs) combine a Stirling cycle engine powered by a radioisotope heater unit into a single generator system. Stirling engine technology has been under development at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE) since the 1970's. The most recent design, the 238Pu-fueled Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), was offered as part of the NASA Discovery 2010 Announcement of Opportunity (AO). The Step-2 selections for this AO included two ASRG-enabled concepts, the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) and the Comet Hopper (CHopper), although the only non-nuclear concept, InSight, was ultimately chosen. The DOE's ASRG contract was terminated in 2013. Given that SRGs utilize significantly less 238Pu than traditional Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) - approximately one quarter of the nuclear fuel, to produce similar electrical power output - they provide a technology worthy of consideration for meeting the aforementioned NASA objectives. NASA's RPS Program Office has recently investigated a new Stirling to Flight (S2F) initiative with the objective of developing a 100-500 We Stirling generator system. Additionally, a different approach is being devised for this initiative to avoid pitfalls of the past, and apply lessons learned from the recent ASRG experience. Two key aspects of this initiative are a Stirling System Technology Maturation Effort, and a Surrogate Mission Team (SMT) intended to provide clear mission pull and requirements context. The S2F project seeks to lead directly into a DOE flight system development of a new SRG. This paper will detail the proposed S2F initiative, and provide specifics on the key efforts designed to pave a forward path for bringing Stirling technology to flight.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160005320, "endDate": "2016-03-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4335489846d14f28a1386ff50a154f0b", "id": "a46d76b3f5324f4f9f562c1742691c02"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4335489846d14f28a1386ff50a154f0b", "id": "4ce73c4f934942ccbd6eb12e79439ec8"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "PHM Society", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4335489846d14f28a1386ff50a154f0b", "id": "6f96ccfd762f48c5b109d65b78260d96"}], "name": "IEEE Aerospace Conference 2016", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "4335489846d14f28a1386ff50a154f0b", "startDate": "2016-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005320, "id": "95e5995319f74cfebeef8e6ff8218fee", "publicationDate": "2016-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005320.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005320/downloads/20160005320.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005320/downloads/20160005320.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005320/downloads/20160005320.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
