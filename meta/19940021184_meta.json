The glass fiber will be produced from the lunar surface, with the machine and matrix being transported to the moon. The process is adaptable to the low gravity and near-vacuum environment of the moon through the use of a thermoplastic matrix in fiber form as it enters the pultrusion process. With a power consumption of 5 kW, the proposed machine will run unmanned continuously in fourteen-day cycles, matching the length of lunar days. A number of dies could be included that would allow the machine to produce rods of varying diameter, I-beams, angles, and other structural members. These members could then be used for construction on the lunar surface or transported for use in orbit. The benefits of this proposal are in the savings in weight of the cargo each lunar mission would carry. The supply of glass on the moon is effectively endless, so enough rods would have to be produced to justify its transportation, operation, and capital cost. This should not be difficult as weight on lunar mission is at a premium.", "title": "Lunar preform manufacturing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940021184, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Leong, Gregory N."}, "organization": {"name": "Georgia Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Atlanta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "9ead301adcec494ab6b67bdeaa874b2a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940021184, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nease, Sandra"}, "organization": {"name": "Georgia Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Atlanta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "217bfb945dd9480c86c4031eace2bcc6"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940021184, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lager, Vicky"}, "organization": {"name": "Georgia Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Atlanta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "3b5204276df741f3bbc9fd16c1ae8e20"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940021184, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yaghjian, Raffy"}, "organization": {"name": "Georgia Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Atlanta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "231edf63f60b42ce915f002f863250d9"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940021184, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Waller, Chris"}, "organization": {"name": "Georgia Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Atlanta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "a1c609d94ea84c429fa49c4058f6ff83"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940021184, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940021184, "id": "8b1a3898d7ae46e39c4f6283f5edd51f", "publicationName": "USRA, Proceedings of the 8th Annual Summer Conference: NASA(USRA Advanced Design Program", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940020711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "New Technologies for Space Avionics, 1993", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940021184.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940021184/downloads/19940021184.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940021184/downloads/19940021184.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940021184/downloads/19940021184.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
