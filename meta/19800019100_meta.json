Theoretical analyses were employed to establish a design window for the material parameters to maximize microwave performance. Single mesa devices yielded typically 2 to 3 W with 16 to 23% efficiency in waveguide oscillator test circuits. IMPATTs with high reliability Pt/TiW/Pt/Au metallizations were subjected to temperature stress, non-rf bias-temperature stress, and rf bias-temperature stress. Assuming that temperature is the driving force behind the dominant failure mechanism, a mean-time-to-failure considerably greater than 500,000 hours is indicated by the stress tests. A 15 GHz, 4W, 56 dB gain microstrip amplifier was realized using GaAs FETs and IMPATTs. Power combining using a 3 db Lange coupler is employed in the power output stage having an intrinsic power-added efficiency of 15.7%. Overall dc-to-rf efficiency of the amplifier is 10.8%. The amplifier has greater than a 250 MHz, 1 db bandwidth; operates over the 0 deg to 50 C (base plate) temperature range with less than 0.5 db change in the power output; weighs 444 grams; and has a volume of 220 cu cm.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800019100, "id": "dee80225aca6402390d2807bfa34b347", "publicationDate": "1979-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800019100.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800019100/downloads/19800019100.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800019100/downloads/19800019100.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800019100/downloads/19800019100.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
