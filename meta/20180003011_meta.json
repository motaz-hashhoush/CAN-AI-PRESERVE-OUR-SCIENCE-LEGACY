Likewise, propellant candidates that offer significant reduction in personnel hazards and shorter payload processing present a more attractive propulsion subsystem solution. Aiming to reduce risk to potential infusion missions and fully comprehend the alternative propellant performance, the work presented herein represents many years of development and collaborative efforts to successfully align higher performance, low toxicity hydrazine alternatives into NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) missions. The High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) technology is being considered for Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20180003011, "endDate": "2018-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "French Aeronautics and Space Society (3AF)", "location": "Paris, France"}}, "meetingId": "7aaa005c64f9417c8db30c17a28539b9", "id": "69b3875dce6544e1bfd518c9b91a58a7"}], "name": "3AF Space Propulsion Conference", "location": "Seville", "id": "7aaa005c64f9417c8db30c17a28539b9", "startDate": "2018-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180003011, "id": "62c3a17711a442618d26a8f76aa8ce08", "publicationDate": "2018-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180003011.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180003011/downloads/20180003011.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180003011/downloads/20180003011.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180003011/downloads/20180003011.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
