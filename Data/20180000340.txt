interest in the potential of airships for\ncargo transport\no Conducting vertical or near-vertical airlift of heavy, outsized freight with little or\nno ground infrastructure is an attractive cargo transport option\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 USTRANSCOM wanted to understand the principal issues that are holding\nback commercial development of airship transports\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA Ames Research Center was commissioned by USTRANSCOM to study\nthe airship industry\xe2\x80\x99s ability to design, develop, and operate cargo airships\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Principal study objectives were to identify:\no Current and near term state of the cargo airship industry\no Roadblocks hindering cargo airship development\no Steps needed to remove impediments to cargo airship deployment\n\n4\n\nDemand Side: Airships Missions and Users\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Interest in cargo airships greatest since the age of the great rigid airships\no Commercial airship transport ranges from tens of miles to a few hundred miles\n(highest demand), with a small number of long distance missions\no Threshold demand for airship transport of 10 to 15 tons, with a middle range\ndemand around 45 to 50 tons, rising to interest in 150 tons plus\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Principal commercial application supporting "resource extraction\xe2\x80\x9c\no Airship provides access to remote or difficult to access areas where conventional\ntransport is prohibitively expensive or environmentally restricted\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Particular interest in moving outsized or heavy \xe2\x80\x9cproject freight\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCanadian northern home

aerostats\no These were funded with full-time staff and currently offering airships, aerostats,\nor operating LTA systems (or able to do so)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Thirteen firms had some level of funding, some staff (mostly part-time)\no But did not yet have an ongoing business of supplying or operating LTA vehicles\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fourteen firms had some level of LTA design or development

Findings\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some tools have limited capability, but none are fully developed, validated models\no Several tools are outdated, have low fidelity, or lack depth of analytical insight\n\no Most provide sizing and assessments of design, mission, CONOPS, and mfg costs\no Only three tool sets had capabilities beyond airship sizing (CargoLifter had detailed analysis)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Costs and competitive secrecy are factors limiting creation of airship simulation tools\no No incentive for airship firms to create modeling and simulation tools useful to competitors\n\no Modeling tools

capability exists to develop cargo airships\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The airship industry is aging and fragmented among a few, small-sized companies\nand independent airship engineers\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The aerospace community offers a rich source of technologies and development\ntools useful to the airship industry\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNew materials, propulsion systems, and control software are available to enable the\nconstruction and operation of large modern airships\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An industry accepted airship engineering database has yet to be defined\no This knowledge is not collected or archived in a single authoritative location\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Group of potential airship users is expanding but commitment of funds for airship\nutilization constrained due to lack of assurance (confidence) in the viability of airship\ntechnologies and airship operational cost/effectiveness\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conundrum is that little investment in airship development is made available until a\nflight test prototype can be demonstrated to work\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Consequently, the money to design, build, and fly a prototype is dependent on\nassurances the vehicle will perform as intended\n25\n\nAirship Industry Study Conclusions (cont.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What\'s missing is an airship expert resource that can provide the comprehensive,\nvalidated analytical tools needed to aid airship developers in their decision-making\nabout proposed airship designs, technologies, and operations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This is a persistent obstacle that has kept the airship industry from breaking through\ninto sustainable production of capable airships for market segments that clearly wish\nto utilize them\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Today\'s potential airship users and investors also require technical and operational\ninsights that can provide them with a solid basis for making confident investment\ndecisions about particular airship concepts or operational proposals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 However, there is no independent entity that can provide analytical insights in\nsufficient detail to offer a credible response to questions from potential airship users\nor airship industry investors as to the technical viability of an airship design or its\nlikelihood of operational success.\n\n26\n\nRecommendations\nA complete and integrated set of airship modeling and simulation tools is\nneeded, based on a full understanding of fundamental airship properties\n\nAssemble an LTA Knowledge Base and Tool Set\n1. Collect LTA design and operations data in one searchable on-line repository\n2. Develop a design process tool set specifically for airship vehicles\n\n3. Establish validated set of modeling and simulation tools for use by airship firms\n4. Develop cost analysis tools for airship design, manufacture, and operations\n\n27\n\nRecommendations (cont.)\n\nUtilize the Tools and Knowledge Database\n1. Investigate critical LTA design concepts, structures, materials, or sub-systems\n2. Conduct operational analysis of LTA vehicles and CONOPS to identify challenges\n3. Conduct modeling and simulation studies of LTA mfg concepts and techniques\na) Reduce labor and assembly costs, improve airship maintenance in the field\n\n28\n\nRecommendations (cont.)\nPrivate-Public Airship program\no Government (USTRANSCOM) could provide leadership for a public-privatepartnership for research into cargo and UAS carrier missions\no NASA Ames can provide guidance for developing engineering tools for the\nairship transport industry\no Private-Public Airship program utilize commercial airship for development\nand validation of airship modeling and simulation tools\n\n29\n\nPresentation SUMMARY\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conducted NASA Industry Study for USTRANSCOM\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Surveyed publicly available information for Airship\nModeling and Simulation Tools\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Survey and GAP Analysis of Tools indicates:\no Tools are needed in the public domain for high-fidelity\nanalysis and design for modern airships\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recommendations :\no Assemble and Utilize an LTA Knowledge Base and Tool Set\nthat will be available in the public domain\no Establish a Private-Public Airship program to develop and\nvalidate tools to benefit the Airship Community\n\n30\n\nQuestions?\n\n31\n\nBackup Slides\n\n32\n\nConventional Airships vs Hybrid Lifting Bodies\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conventional hull is inherently more stable in pitch due to lower center of gravity\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conventional hull has less surface area than multi-lobed hybrid of same gas volume\n\xe2\x80\x93 Hybrid requires more fabric\n\xe2\x80\x93 Hybrid empty weight is heavier\n\xe2\x80\x93 Hybrid has greater drag, producing greater fuel consumption\n\nA lifting-body hybrid with three lobes\nseparated horizontally by half of the lobe\ndiameter will have a 6% greater surface\narea than a single-lobed airship of the same\ngas volume.
