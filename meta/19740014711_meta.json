Beam-squinting, by mechanical displacement and electrical phase gradient methods, is introduced together with the combination of these methods. In the case of dual parabolic cylinders there is also a discussion of surface-truncation, parametric representation of surface intersections, main-aperture blockage by the subsystem, and beam squinting. A few diffraction patterns are presented to illustrate the type of data available via a formulation equivalent to the complex-vector Kirchhoff-Kottler formulation. Main and cross-polarization components of the solution are available as they are inherently part of the field solution in the Cartesian coordinate system. A means of displaying main and cross-polarization components for arbitrary beam-scanning in space is outlined. Extensions to monopulse tracking with variable-beamwidth (zooming) capability are introduced.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740014711, "id": "832b9406b83946579ae00069d67257d7", "publicationDate": "1973-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740014711.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740014711/downloads/19740014711.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740014711/downloads/19740014711.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740014711/downloads/19740014711.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
