It is desirable in systems where\ncolor modulation of light is employed to transmit\nsignal information to provide a stationary color modulated output beam in order that the signal informa-\n\ntion may be utilized without compensating for output beam movement. One method of providing such a\nstationary output beam employs slitted apertures\nwhich compensate for the dispersion of light inherent\nin prismatic or grating light refraction. However, the\nsmall slitted apertures required in such systems limit\nthe intensity of the output beam of light too greatly\nfor many applications.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States \t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nThe solution:\nAn improved signal controlled system for the color\nmodulation of a beam of light in which the color\nshift for given signal variations is predetermined\nand may be varied as desired. A beam of light is\ndirected through litters of the desired color according\nto the position of an oscillating mirror from which\nthe beam is reflected.\nHow it's done;\nA beam from a concentrated white-light source is\nfocused onto a mirror that can be oscillated at any\ndesired modulation frequency. The light reflects from\nthis mirror to a set of colored filters so arranged that\nas the beam oscillates, it passes through the different\ncolors according to a predetermined modulation pattern. A concave mirror behind the filters returns the\nlight to the oscillating mirror, back to a beam divider\nand then to the output point.\n\nNotes:\nI. The feasibility of recording a beam of light which\nhas been color modulated by prismatic or grating\ntype refraction in conventional three color film is\ncomplicated by the color response of the film\nbeing incompatible with the color blending and\nthe color dispersion inherent in prismatic color\nmodulation. The color modulation acquired by the\npresented system can be compatible with any color\nfilm by employing color filters formed to provide\na color wedge having a color distribution compatible with the film's color sensitivity.\n2. This color modulator system may also be applicable for color separation work in the graphic arts.\nPatent status:\nTitle to this invention has been waived under the\nprovisions of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAct (42 U.S.C. 2457 (f)) to the Regents of the University of California, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley,\nCalifornia 94720.\nSource: William A.
